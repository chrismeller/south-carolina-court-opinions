CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529,\r\n  608 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent Harry Montgomery,\r\n  a railroad employee of petitioner CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSX), was injured while\r\n  using a manual track wrench to tighten a bolt\r\n  on a railroad track. Â Respondent brought a negligence action against CSX under\r\n  the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA).[1] Â CSX moved for summary judgment.Â  The evidence\r\n  presented included deposition testimony of respondent\r\n  and two of his CSX supervisors, as well as affidavits from two experts for\r\n  respondent.Â  After a hearing, the trial court granted CSX's motion.Â  On appeal,\r\n  the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial; Judge Goolsby dissented.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was injured on July 13, 1999.Â  At that time, he was\r\n  employed as a track inspector and had been working for CSX for over 22 years.Â \r\n  He attained the title of foreman in 1994.\r\nCSX owns and operates two mainline tracks north of Charleston:Â  the &quot;A-line&quot; and the &quot;S-line.&quot;Â  The A-line is made of &quot;welded\r\n  rail,&quot; which is continuous, quarter-mile rail sections welded together.Â  There\r\n  are &quot;connected joints&quot; on the A-line which means that bolts are put\r\n  in place temporarily to hold the quarter-mile sections together, but those are\r\n  later removed by a welding process.Â  The S-line, on the other hand, is made up\r\n  of &quot;jointed rail&quot; which is comprised of 39-foot rail sections held\r\n  together by &quot;rail joints.&quot;Â  In one mile, there are approximately 130\r\n  joints on each rail, with six track bolts per joint.Â  Given that there are two\r\n  rails on a track, there are about 1,560 track bolts per mile on the S-line.Â \r\n  The upshot is that there are many more track bolts on the S-line, and\r\n  comparatively very few on the A-line.Â   \r\nAdditionally, the A-line is a higher class line which handles more\r\n  active railroad traffic.Â  About 16 trains run per day on the A&#8209;line,\r\n  which includes a high-speed passenger train, while the S-line runs only six\r\n  trains per day, all local freight trains.Â   \r\nFor both the A-line and the S-line, there were two track\r\n  inspectors - respondent and a man named Ussery who had worked for CSX for two\r\n  years.Â  Respondent's immediate supervisor was roadmaster James Reed; Darrell\r\n  Crook was CSX's assistant\r\n  division engineer and Reed's supervisor.Â   \r\nRespondent explained that a track inspector's &quot;main purpose\r\n  is to look for anything that's unsafe and try to make it safe.&quot;Â  He further described his track duties as\r\n  including the following: Â tightening and replacing track bolts, replacing broken\r\n  joints and joint bars, and replacing anything else that might be broken or\r\n  defective on the track.Â  In addition, he was responsible for reporting anything\r\n  &quot;out of the ordinary that would â€¦ allow a piece of track to be unsafe.&quot;\r\nAccording to respondent, about a month before his injury, Crook\r\n  reassigned him from working primarily on the A-line to working solely on\r\n  the S-line:\r\n\r\n\tMr. Crook came up to me and Mr. Crook made a verbal agreement with\r\n  me and he says that a - that S Line was in bad shape and that he knew it and I\r\n  knew it and he came up to me and he made a verbal agreement with me, he says\r\n  that, &quot;If I were to get you a piece of machinery called a bolt machine and\r\n  put you out on this track, would you be able to do some work to get that track\r\n  a little better - in better shape?&quot;Â  And I agreed to, I said, &quot;Look,\r\n  Mr. Crook, I'll do the best that I can,&quot; and that's all I could have done.\r\n\r\nA bolt machine is a machine that loosens and tightens track bolts\r\n  and is used instead of a manual track wrench.Â  Respondent explained that\r\n  although he was provided with a bolt machine on the first day of his\r\n  reassignment, the machine was old and it failed.Â  It was neither fixed nor\r\n  replaced.Â  However, the other track inspector, Ussery, who had been assigned to\r\n  the A&#8209;line, had been provided with a state-of-the-art Matweld Unit which\r\n  was a power hydraulic system.Â  Among other things, this unit can run power\r\n  wrenches and a bolt tightening machine.Â   \r\nRespondent was responsible for the &quot;Andrews Subdivision&quot;\r\n  of the S&#8209;line, approximately 45 to 50 miles of track.Â  In his deposition\r\n  testimony, respondent stated that\r\n  although he would have preferred to work on the A&#8209;line, he felt as if his\r\n  job would be in danger if he had not taken the S-line assignment from Crook.Â  Respondent explained about the poor condition of the S-line\r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n\t[The] railroad track â€¦ was tore up and run down for\r\n  many years and you had to be there to see it.Â  It was - it was a bad railroad\r\n  track.Â  It was a bad piece of track.Â  It was rough, it was rugged, there was a\r\n  lot of work. Â I mean a whole lot more work to have been done on that piece of\r\n  railroad track than it was on the A Line.\r\n\r\nBecause\r\n  of the S-line's poor condition, a lot of &quot;slow orders&quot; were placed on\r\n  the S-line.Â  In addition, respondent stated there was &quot;talk among\r\n  employees&quot; that the S-line might have to be shut down because the &quot;tracks\r\n  were in bad shape.&quot;Â   \r\nAlthough he believed that the job assignment required more than\r\n  just one man, respondent worked without a crew on the S-line.Â  On the day of\r\n  the accident, respondent went out and was tightening loose bolts and replacing missing\r\n  bolts.Â  He was supposed to go as far on the line as his workday hours would\r\n  allow.Â  After about three and a half hours of working, respondent estimated he\r\n  had tightened 100 to 200 bolts.Â  As respondent was attempting to tighten a\r\n  particular bolt on a switch with the manual track wrench, the bolt &quot;froze;&quot;\r\n  after respondent applied &quot;a little more pressure than normal&quot; to the\r\n  bolt, it gave way which caused respondent to be thrown across the rail and\r\n  injured on his right side.[2]Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent did not claim there was any defect with the manual\r\n  track wrench, a tool he had used his entire career at CSX.Â  He did state that\r\n  the bolt was &quot;bad,&quot; i.e., faulty in some way.Â  As to whether he could\r\n  have gotten help if he had called for it, respondent stated it was &quot;very\r\n  doubtful&quot; he would have gotten any, especially given the shortage of\r\n  employees at the rail yard during that time.\r\nRespondent's roadmaster, Reed, testified in deposition that he\r\n  would expect a track man to tighten up to 24 bolts in a normal day's work.Â  He\r\n  further stated that if he knew an employee would be tightening as many as 100\r\n  bolts in a day, then he would give him a bolt tightening machine for the work.[3]Â  Reed confirmed that respondent had\r\n  not been charged with any violation of any rule.Â   \r\nCrook, the assistant division engineer, testified that he did not\r\n  remember a conversation with respondent where Crook asked respondent to get the\r\n  S-line in better shape with a bolt machine.Â  Crook acknowledged, however, that\r\n  the S-line &quot;had a lot of problems that â€¦ needed to get corrected,&quot;\r\n  such as &quot;a lot of bolts out, â€¦ broken bars ..., a good many weak ties and â€¦\r\n  some surface conditions.&quot;\r\nRespondent\r\n  presented two expert affidavits.Â  Don H.\r\n  Bowden, Sr., a railroad safety consultant and former roadmaster for CSX, offered\r\n  his opinions regarding reasonable work assignments and safety practices in the\r\n  railroad industry. Â In Bowden's opinion, respondent's assignment on the S&#8209;line\r\n  should not have been done by one worker alone:\r\n\r\n\tUnder common industry practice, this job should not be\r\n  done by one man alone. Â [Respondent] was assigned to the monumental task of\r\n  repairing the track by himself. Â While it is not uncommon for one man to be\r\n  assigned a task in inspecting a track, it is unreasonably hazardous to require\r\n  one man to not only inspect the track, but also perform the actual track\r\n  maintenance himself. Â A prudent and reasonable railroad would assign a gang of\r\n  men to do this type of job. Â To do otherwise, in my opinion, subjects the\r\n  employee to an unsafe workplace in the railroad industry because an accident is\r\n  bound to happen.\r\n\r\nBowden also opined it was\r\n  unreasonable for CSX to provide respondent with only a manual track wrench:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  unreasonable hazards to which [respondent] was exposed by working this track by\r\n  himself were greatly exacerbated and increased by CSX requiring him to replace\r\n  and/or tighten the track bolts with a manual track wrench. Â While it is not\r\n  uncommon for workers to use manual track wrenches to tighten sporadic loose\r\n  bolts on a stretch of track, this particular track was in such a state of\r\n  disrepair that the use of a track wrench was not only impracticable, it\r\n  unreasonably increased the likelihood of injury to [respondent].â€¦ Â In addition\r\n  to the sheer volume of bolts that [respondent] needed to replace and/or\r\n  tighten, the condition of the bolts and the track also made the manual track\r\n  wrench an unsuitable tool for this job.Â  This track had been neglected by CSX\r\n  for a long period of time.Â  As such, CSX should have known that the\r\n  bolts were very likely to be &quot;rusted-on,&quot; making them very difficult\r\n  to remove and/or tighten. Â Requiring Mr. Montgomery to work with a manual\r\n  wrench in these conditions\r\n  unreasonably multiplied his risk of injury. Â Mr.\r\n  Montgomery's description of the accident shows these hazards were present\r\n  because he was required to use a tremendous amount of leverage on the wrench to\r\n  break through the rust.Â  For all of these reasons, a prudent and reasonable\r\n  railroad would not have supplied just a track wrench to Mr. Montgomery to do\r\n  this job. Â A prudent and reasonable railroad would have provided\r\n  him with another bolt tightening machine when the first one became inoperable\r\n  or would have fixed the one assigned to him.\r\n\r\nRespondent\r\n  also offered the affidavit of Dr. Tyler A. Kress, a biomechanical engineer, who\r\n  stated as follows:\r\nIt is my\r\n  opinion that (1) the type of work [respondent] was performing daily and (2) the\r\n  tools he was given to perform that work created unreasonably dangerous\r\n  biomechanical risk factors to his body. Â It is my further opinion that these\r\n  risk factors are consistent with his fall and the injuries he sustained as a\r\n  result of his fall.\r\nApparently,\r\n  [respondent] was ordered to perform the repetitive motion of tightening and\r\n  untightening bolts with a manual track wrench. Â Proper use of the track wrench\r\n  requires the employee to keep the head of the wrench fixed on the nut that is\r\n  being tightened or untightened. Â Keeping the head of the wrench on the nut is\r\n  even more important when the bolts and nuts are rusted and susceptible to being\r\n  &quot;stuck.&quot; Â Sporadic use of the track wrench to tighten and untighten\r\n  nuts and bolts would not normally cause risk to the human body. Â However,\r\n  performing repetitive tasks daily - and specifically ones that require\r\n  push/pull forces of the upper extremity and upper body like the track wrench -\r\n  are widely associated with increased risk of injury because of the cumulative\r\n  effects of the repetition and fatigue. Â In [respondent's] work environment, his\r\n  use of the track wrench was not spora[d]ic because of the sheer number of bolts that were\r\n  evidentially [sic] in disrepair on this stretch of track. Â His fatigue from\r\n  this manual, repetitive motion was increased by the increased forces needed to\r\n  free the nuts and bolts from their rusted condition. Â With each repetitive use\r\n  of the wrench, it became more physically difficult for [respondent] to control\r\n  the wrench and its pivot point where the head is fastened to the nut. Â The probabilities\r\n  of both (1) the wrench slipping off of the nut and (2) an abrupt motion\r\n  occurring because of a nut breaking free are increased significantly due to the\r\n  repetitive and tiring nature of the assigned job. Â It is understandable that [respondent]\r\n  may fall if and when one of these events occur. Â Therefore, it is my opinion\r\n  that his fall is a natural result of the work environment imposed on him by\r\n  C.S.X.\r\nThe trial court\r\n  found the expert affidavits unpersuasive because respondent was not under any\r\n  time pressure by CSX to complete the S-line work.Â  Furthermore, the trial court\r\n  reasoned that respondent's task of tightening the track bolt was one that could\r\n  be safely performed by one person; therefore, additional workers would have\r\n  only meant the job would be finished more quickly.Â  The trial court also found\r\n  that the failure to provide a bolt tightening machine was not automatically\r\n  negligent.Â  Significantly, the trial court noted that &quot;[i]f the use of the\r\n  manual bolt wrench was safe and appropriate for use on one bolt, then it was\r\n  safe and appropriate for any number of bolts absent unreasonable performance\r\n  requirements imposed by&quot; CSX.Â  Since the wrench itself was not defective\r\n  and respondent was &quot;not on any schedule,&quot; the trial court found no\r\n  genuine issue of material fact as to CSX's negligence.Â   \r\nAs\r\n  stated above, the Court of Appeals reversed, with Judge Goolsby dissenting.Â \r\n  The majority opinion held that respondent had established genuine issues of\r\n  material fact as to whether: (1) CSX failed to provide respondent with\r\n  sufficient help to repair the S-line; and (2) CSX breached its duty to provide\r\n  respondent with safe and suitable equipment to do his job.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appeals further held that the railroad employer's conduct must be viewed as a\r\n  whole, and since CSX's alleged breaches could be combined to create an\r\n  unreasonably unsafe work environment, then negligence should be determined by a\r\n  jury.Â Â  Thus, the Court of Appeals reversed summary judgment and remanded the\r\n  case for a jury trial.Â  Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., supra.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in \r\n\t\t\tannouncing a relaxed standard of negligence for a FELA action?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in \r\n\t\t\tfinding the expert affidavits sufficiently created a genuine issue \r\n\t\t\tof material fact as to CSX's negligence?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in \r\n\t\t\tholding that, pursuant to Blair v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., 323 U.S.\r\n  600 (1945), the combined effect of respondent's two negligence theories\r\n  sufficiently raised an inference as to FELA negligence?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  ultimate issue in the instant case is whether the Court of Appeals erred in\r\n  reversing the grant of summary judgment.Â  Because this overall question\r\n  permeates the three discrete legal issues on certiorari, we begin our\r\n  discussion with general FELA law, including the legal standards governing\r\n  summary judgment review in a FELA case.\r\nTo\r\n  prevail on a FELA claim, the plaintiff must prove &quot;the traditional common law elements of negligence\r\n  (i.e., duty, breach, causation and damages) and that the employer's negligence 'contributed,\r\n  in whole or in part, to the worker's injury.'&quot;Â  Baggerly v. CSX\r\n    Transp., Inc., 370 S.C. 362, 369 n.5, 635 S.E.2d 97, 101 n.5&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (quoting Rogers v. Norfolk S. Corp., 356 S.C. 85, 93, 588 S.E.2d\r\n  87, 91 (2003)). Â \r\nIn Norton\r\n  v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 350 S.C. 473, 476, 567 S.E.2d 851, 853&nbsp;(2002), we\r\n  stated the following regarding FELA claims in state court:\r\n\r\n\tFELA is\r\n  a federal statute which provides the framework for handling the injury claims\r\n  of federal railroad workers. State courts have concurrent jurisdiction to hear\r\n  FELA claims.â€¦ Â A FELA action brought in state court is controlled by federal\r\n  substantive law and state procedural law. Â However, a form of practice may not\r\n  defeat a federal rightâ€¦.Â  It is firmly established that questions of\r\n  sufficiency of evidence for the jury in cases arising under FELA in state\r\n  courts are to be determined by federal rules.\r\n\r\n(Citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nThis\r\n  Court reviews the grant of a summary judgment motion under the same standard as\r\n  the trial court, pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP: Â summary judgment is proper\r\n  when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Â E.g., Burriss v. Anderson County Bd. of Educ., 369 S.C. 443, 633 S.E.2d 482 (2006); Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003).Â  When determining if any triable issues of\r\n  fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from\r\n  the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\r\n  Â Wilson v. Style Crest Products, Inc.,&nbsp;367 S.C. 653, 656,\r\n  627 S.E.2d 733, 735&nbsp;(2006).Â  Moreover, even if there is no dispute regarding\r\n  the evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn\r\n  from them, summary judgment should be denied. Â Id.\r\n1.Â  Did the Court of Appeals misstate the FELA standard\r\n  of negligence?\r\nCSX\r\n  argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding there is a &quot;relaxed&quot;\r\n  standard for proving FELA negligence, and by applying the relaxed standard it\r\n  improperly found issues of fact.Â  CSX specifically contends that although there\r\n  is a relaxed standard for the causation prong, the Court of Appeals erroneously\r\n  found the relaxed standard also applies to the duty/breach element.[4]Â \r\n  We agree with CSX that the Court of Appeals' language regarding the FELA\r\n  standards is problematic.Â  We do not agree, however, that the misstatements in\r\n  the opinion led to the wrong result.\r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  1 of FELA provides that:\r\n\tEvery\r\n  common carrier by railroad ... shall be liable in damages to any person suffering\r\n  injury while he is employed by such carrier ... for such injury or death\r\n  resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the\r\n  officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or\r\n  insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances,\r\n  machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.\r\n\r\n45 U.S.C. Â§ 51 (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Courts must construe FELA provisions liberally in favor of injured\r\n  railroad workers. Â E.g., Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512\r\n  U.S. 532, 542 (1994); Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 182 (1949).Â  Put simply, FELA imposes upon a railroad a non-delegable duty to provide its\r\n  employees with a reasonably safe place to work.Â  E.g., Brown v. CSX\r\n    Transp., Inc.,&nbsp;18 F.3d 245, 249&nbsp;(4th Cir. 1994); Rogers v. Norfolk S. Corp., 356 S.C. 85, 92, 588 S.E.2d 87, 90&nbsp;(2003), cert.\r\n      denied, 541 U.S. 1085 (2004).\r\nIn Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U.S. 500 (1957), the United States Supreme Court (USSC) stated the\r\n  following regarding causation in a FELA case:\r\n\r\n\tIt does not matter that, from the evidence, the jury may also with\r\n  reason, on grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causesâ€¦.Â \r\n  Judicial appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury question is presented\r\n\tis narrowly limited to the single inquiry whether, with reason, the\r\n  conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played any\r\n    part at all in the injury or death.\r\n\r\nId. at 506-07 (emphasis added, footnote\r\n  omitted).  \r\nMore recently, the USSC characterized Rogers as having established a &quot;relaxed&quot; causation standard:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e\r\n  held in Rogers [] that a relaxed standard of causation applies\r\n  under FELA. Â We stated that &quot;[u]nder this statute the test of a jury case\r\n  is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer\r\n  negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury\r\n  or death for which damages are sought.&quot; Â [Rogers, 352 U.S.] at 506.\r\n\r\nConsolidated Rail Corp. v.\r\n  Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 543 (1994) (emphasis added).Â   \r\nNonetheless,\r\n  the Gottshall Court also emphasized that FELA is not a workers'\r\n  compensation scheme and &quot;'does not make the employer the insurer of the\r\n  safety of his employees while they are on duty. Â The basis of his liability is\r\n  his negligence, not the fact that injuries occur.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Ellis v. Union Pacific R. Co., 329 U.S. 649, 653 (1947)).\r\nThere is a federal\r\n  circuit split as to whether the relaxed FELA standard applies only to\r\n  causation, or applies to the fault prong of FELA negligence as well.Â  The Fifth\r\n  Circuit, for example, expressly uses the lower standard only on the causation\r\n  element. Â See, e.g., Gautreaux v. Scurlock Marine, Inc.,\r\n  107 F.3d 331&nbsp;(5th Cir. 1997) (en banc). Â The Gautreaux court stated that the &quot;in whole or in part&quot; language of the FELA\r\n  statute &quot;modifies only the causation prong of the inquiry.Â  The phrase\r\n  does not also modify the word 'negligence.'&quot; Â Id. at 335.Â  The\r\n  Second Circuit, however, applies the relaxed standard to both the fault and the\r\n  causation prongs. Â See, e.g., Williams v. Long Island R.R. Co.,\r\n  196 F.3d 402, 406&nbsp;(2nd Cir. 1999) (where the court noted it has\r\n  &quot;explicitly stated&quot; it construes FELA &quot;as creating a relaxed\r\n  standard for negligence as well as causation&quot;) (citation and internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Fourth Circuit has noted that a Jones\r\n  Act claim, like a FELA claim, is based on negligence where &quot;the elements\r\n  of duty, breach, and injury draw on common law principles&quot; and only &quot;the\r\n  element of causation is relaxed.&quot; Â Hernandez\r\n    v. Trawler Miss Vertie Mae, Inc., 187 F.3d 432, 437&nbsp;(4th Cir.\r\n  1999).[5]Â   \r\nThe confusion on\r\n  this issue was clearly evidenced very recently in Norfolk Southern Ry. Co.\r\n    v. Sorrell, ___ U.S. ___,&nbsp; 127 S.Ct. 799 (2007).Â  There, the USSC\r\n  accepted the question of whether the Missouri courts erred in determining that the\r\n  causation standard for employee contributory negligence under FELA\r\n  differs from the causation standard for railroad negligence.Â  The USSC\r\n  answered this question in the affirmative, and held that under FELA, the\r\n  same causation standard applies to both a plaintiff's claim for negligence and\r\n  a defendant's affirmative defense of contributory negligence.Â   \r\nYet,\r\n  the Sorrell Court did not establish precisely what the FELA standard for\r\n  causation is.Â  Although the railroad had &quot;attempted to expand the question presented to encompass what the standard of causation under FELA should be, not simply whether the standard\r\n  should be the same for railroad negligence and employee contributory negligence,&quot;\r\n  the Court declined to answer that question.Â  Id. at&nbsp;803-04\r\n  (emphasis in original).Â  The majority opinion therefore did not address this\r\n  issue of a relaxed standard.\r\nIn a\r\n  concurring opinion, however, Justice Souter offered his own characterization of\r\n  the 1957 Rogers opinion:Â  &quot;Rogers did not address, much less\r\n  alter, existing law governing the degree of causation necessary for redressing\r\n  negligence as the cause of negligently inflicted harm; the case merely\r\n  instructed courts how to proceed when there are multiple cognizable causes of\r\n  an injury.&quot;Â  Id. at 809-10&nbsp;(Souter, J., concurring).  \r\nJustice\r\n  Ginsburg also wrote separately in Sorrell, but she believed the majority\r\n  opinion &quot;leaves in place precedent solidly establishing that the causation\r\n  standard in FELA actions is more 'relaxed' than in tort litigation generally.&quot;Â  Id. at 812 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment).Â  According to\r\n  Justice Ginsburg, &quot;Rogers describes the test for proximate\r\n  causation applicable in FELA suits. Â That test is whether 'employer negligence\r\n  played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which\r\n  damages are sought.'&quot;Â  Id. at 813 (quoting Rogers, 352 U.S. at 506).\r\nWe turn now to the\r\n  instant case and how the Court of Appeals set out the FELA standards.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals stated as follows:  \r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  plaintiff's burden in a FELA action is significantly lighter than it would be\r\n  in an ordinary South Carolina common law negligence case:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tFELA's] [history] has been said to\r\n      reduce the extent of the negligence required, as well as the quantum of proof\r\n      necessary to establish it, to the &quot;vanishing point.&quot; Â While it is\r\n        still undoubtedly true that there must be some shreds of proof both of\r\n        negligence and of causation, and that &quot;speculation, conjecture and\r\n      possibilities&quot; will not be enough, there appears to be little doubt that\r\n      under [FELA] jury verdicts for the plaintiff can be sustained upon evidence\r\n      which would not be sufficient in the ordinary negligence action.\r\n\t\r\n\tNorton\r\n  v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 341 S.C. 165, 533 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. 2000), rev'd\r\n    on other grounds, 350 S.C. 473, 567 S.E.2d 851 (2002) (citing W.\r\n  Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts Â§ 80, at 578 (5th ed. 1984)) (internal quotations omitted).\r\n\r\nMontgomery v. CSX Transp.,\r\n  Inc., 362 S.C. at 544-45, 608 S.E.2d at\r\n  448 (emphasis added).Â   \r\nHowever,\r\n  in this Court's opinion which reversed the Court of Appeals' Norton case (albeit on other grounds), we noted that the Court of Appeals had &quot;created\r\n  a relaxed standard of negligence in federal law where there is not one, at\r\n  least not in the Fourth Circuit.&quot;Â  Norton v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.,&nbsp;350\r\n  S.C. at 480 n.5, 567 S.E.2d at 855 n.5.\r\nLikewise,\r\n  we find here the Court of Appeals inappropriately stated that a relaxed\r\n  standard applies to the FELA negligence prong.Â  Put simply, federal law has not\r\n  conclusively established a relaxed standard of negligence (i.e., duty/breach)\r\n  in FELA cases.Â  See Norton v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 350 S.C. at 476,\r\n  567 S.E.2d at 853 (a FELA action heard in state court is controlled by federal\r\n  substantive law). Â Based on the USSC's statement in Gottshall, there is\r\n  a relaxed causation standard, but the USSC has never expressly stated\r\n  that anything other than the traditional federal common law standard applies to\r\n  the other elements of a FELA claim.[6]Â \r\n  Therefore, we agree with CSX that the Court of Appeals erred in lowering the\r\n  burden of proof on the duty/breach elements of a FELA negligence claim.\r\nWe reiterate\r\n  the general standard of proof in a FELA claim: the plaintiff must prove the traditional duty, breach, causation and damages elements\r\n  of negligence. Â Baggerly v. CSX Transp., Inc., 370 S.C. at 369 n.5, 635\r\n  S.E.2d at101 n.5.&nbsp; We further hold that under federal law, there is a\r\n  relaxed standard for the causation element.Â  See Gottshall, supra; Rogers, supra.Â  Accordingly, we modify the portion of the\r\n  Court of Appeals' opinion which inaccurately states there is a &quot;significantly\r\n  lighter&quot; burden of proof on both causation and negligence for a FELA\r\n  claim. Â Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. at 544-45, 608\r\n  S.E.2d at 448.Â Â   \r\n2. Did the Court of Appeals err in finding the\r\n  expert affidavits created a genuine issue of material fact?\r\nCSX next argues the\r\n  Court of Appeals erred in finding that the expert affidavits created genuine\r\n  issues of material fact.Â  Specifically, CSX maintains the affidavits merely\r\n  contain speculation and conclusory allegations and instead should have been\r\n  based on specific facts in the record.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nRule\r\n  56(e), SCRCP,Â  provides that for purposes of summary judgment, &quot;[s]upporting\r\n  and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth\r\n  such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively\r\n  that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.&quot;Â \r\n  This rule further states that &quot;an adverse party may not rest upon the mere\r\n  allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as\r\n  otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that\r\n  there is a genuine issue for trial.&quot;Â  Rule 56(e), SCRCP.\r\nCSX takes issue\r\n  with the experts' assumptions regarding the following:Â  (1) respondent's\r\n  difficulty in turning the track bolt was due to the fact that the bolt was &quot;rusted-on;&quot;\r\n  (2) respondent needed to use a &quot;tremendous amount of leverage on the\r\n  wrench;&quot; and (3) respondent was fatigued because of the repetitive nature\r\n  of his assignment.Â  CSX contends that these averments lack factual support in\r\n  the record.\r\nArguably, both\r\n  experts made a few assumptions that are not explicitly supported by respondent's\r\n  deposition testimony.Â  For example, respondent never discussed rust on the\r\n  bolts and did not say he suffered from fatigue.Â  Moreover, his exact words\r\n  regarding the leverage he used on the wrench - &quot;I tried to tighten it some\r\n  more, the bolt had froze, which allowed me to apply just a little more pressure\r\n  than normal, and the whole thing gave which â€¦ sent me across the rail&quot; -\r\n  did not unequivocally indicate he used &quot;tremendous&quot; leverage.\r\nNonetheless, the\r\n  evidence must be construed in the light most favorable to respondent.Â  See, e.g., Wilson v. Style Crest Products, Inc.,&nbsp;367 S.C. at\r\n  656, 627 S.E.2d at 735.&nbsp; Respondent did testify he had already tightened\r\n  between 100 and 200 bolts in less than four hours.Â  In our opinion, a\r\n  reasonable inference is that his job entailed repetitive motions with the large\r\n  manual track wrench.Â  Similarly, respondent was thrown across the rail when the\r\n  previously stuck bolt &quot;gave&quot; way.Â  We find a jury could reasonably\r\n  infer that respondent was applying quite a bit of pressure to the bolt in an\r\n  attempt to tighten it, which was exactly what his assignment entailed.  \r\nThis Court has\r\n  plainly stated that &quot;even when there is no dispute as to the evidentiary\r\n  facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them,\r\n  summary judgment should be denied.&quot; Â Id.Â  There appears to be no\r\n  real dispute to the following critical facts:Â  respondent was working alone on\r\n  the day of the accident, with a manual tool, on a 45-mile stretch of track that\r\n  was in very poor condition.Â  Respondent's negligence theories are that CSX\r\n  should have assigned more workers for the task and/or should have\r\n  provided him with a bolt tightening machine.Â  Both respondent's experts\r\n  confirmed that, in their opinion, CSX should have done both of these things and\r\n  the failure to do so was causally related to respondent's injury.Â  Thus, there\r\n  is evidence of duty, breach, causation and injury in respondent's favor.Â \r\n  Obviously, the parties vehemently dispute the inferences and conclusions to be\r\n  drawn from the undisputed facts, but that simply establishes that summary\r\n  judgment is not appropriate in this case.Â  Id.  \r\n\r\n\tA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a jury question\r\n  on whether CSX was negligent for failing to provide sufficient help to\r\n  respondent for the S-line repair?\r\n\r\nFELA negligence may\r\n  be predicated on the railroad's failure to furnish sufficient help if, but for\r\n  that failure, the injury would not have occurred.Â  E.g., Yawn v. Southern Ry. Co., 591 F.2d 312, 315&nbsp;(5th Cir.), cert.\r\n    denied, 442 U.S. 934 (1979); Deere v. Southern Pac. Co., 123 F.2d\r\n  438, 441&nbsp;(9th Cir. 1941), cert. denied, 315 U.S. 819 (1942); Lis v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co.,\r\n  12 Misc.2d 868, 869 (N.Y. City Ct. 1958).\r\nCSX\r\n  argues that providing more workers on the S-line would not have prevented\r\n  respondent's injury because tightening a bolt is generally a one&#8209;man\r\n  task. CSX relies heavily on McKennon v. CSX Transp., Inc., 897 F.Supp.\r\n  1024&nbsp;(M.D. Tenn.), aff'd, 56 F.3d 64 (6th\r\n  Cir. 1995), in support of its argument that summary judgment is\r\n  warranted in this case.Â   \r\nIn McKennon,\r\n  the plaintiff raised insufficient help as one of his negligence theories; the\r\n  district court granted summary judgment for CSX.Â  The plaintiff, a foreman, was\r\n  repairing a railroad switch after a derailment. Â This was a two-man job where\r\n  the plaintiff's partner would insert a tie under the tie plate and\r\n  position the plate on top of the tie; the plaintiff would then secure the plate\r\n  by driving a spike through it and into the tie. Â To drive the spikes, the plaintiff\r\n  used a &quot;spike maul,&quot; a nine-pound tool similar to a sledgehammer,\r\n  which he had been using for approximately 20 years. Â While swinging the spike\r\n  maul, the plaintiff injured his left shoulder.Â  Id. at\r\n  1025-26.\r\nAs\r\n  to the plaintiff's theory that he should have had more workers on the job, the\r\n  district court stated the following:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he fact\r\n  that Plaintiff's job would have been easier if there had been more workers does\r\n  not constitute negligence on the part of Defendant, nor does it create an\r\n  unreasonably unsafe work environment. Â Assuming arguendo that Defendant's\r\n  failure to supply more workers was a breach of its duty, Plaintiff still has\r\n  not shown how the absence of additional workers caused his injury.\r\n\r\nId. at 1027.\r\nAdmittedly,\r\n  the facts of McKennon are very similar to those of the instant case, and\r\n  it certainly is questionable whether CSX's failure to provide more workers on\r\n  the S-line proximately caused respondent's injury.Â  Respondent argues, however,\r\n  the instant case is distinguishable from McKennon.Â  Viewing the facts in\r\n  a light most favorable to respondent and taking into account the relaxed\r\n  standard of causation in a FELA case, we agree a jury question has been\r\n  presented.Â  Here, there are two experts who offered detailed affidavits as to\r\n  CSX's duty, breach, and causation which was absent in McKennon.[7]Â \r\n  Although the evidence on causation is not conclusive, the circumstances of this\r\n  case require that the claim be submitted to a jury.Â   \r\n\r\n\tB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a jury question\r\n  on whether CSX was negligent for failing to provide respondent with a\r\n  bolt-tightening machine?\r\n\r\nAs to the theory\r\n  regarding the bolt-tightening machine, CSX argues it was not required to\r\n  provide respondent with an automated machine.Â  We find, however, that respondent\r\n  presented a jury question on this issue as well.\r\nThe\r\n  proper inquiry in a FELA case is whether the work method prescribed by the\r\n  employer was reasonably safe, not whether the employer could have used a safer\r\n  alternative method for performing the task. Â Stillman v. Norfolk &amp; W.\r\n    Ry., 811 F.2d 834, 838 (4th Cir. 1987). Â Thus, the fact\r\n  that there may have been an automated or safer method of work does not\r\n  automatically render the chosen method negligent for purposes of FELA. Â Chicago R.I. &amp; Pac. R.R. v. Lint, 217 F.2d 279, 282-83 (8th Cir.\r\n  1954); see also Soto v. Southern Pac. Transp., 644 F.2d\r\n  1147, 1148 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 969 (1981) (&quot;That\r\n  there are other, arguably more advanced, methods in use by the defendant â€¦ is\r\n  of no significance where the method in use by [the employee] was not an\r\n  inherently unsafe one.&quot;); McKennon, 897 F.Supp. at 1027.\r\nThe\r\n  plaintiff in McKennon argued that CSX was negligent for failing to\r\n  provide an automated tool to drive in the spikes, but the district court\r\n  decided, as a matter of law, there was no negligence:\r\n\r\n\tPlaintiff\r\n  admits that he has used the spike maul safely for twenty years. Â Plaintiff\r\n  concedes that the maul he used was not defective in any way. Â He further\r\n  concedes that the spike maul is a safe and appropriate way to drive spikes.â€¦Â  That\r\n  easier, automated means were available is irrelevant to\r\n  the issue in this case. Â Based on the Plaintiff's own testimony, this Court\r\n  finds that Defendant's failure to allow the use of the machine did not\r\n  constitute negligence or create an unreasonably unsafe working condition.\r\n\r\nMcKennon, 897 F.Supp. at 1027.Â   \r\nOnce\r\n  again, although the McKennon facts are similar to those of the instant\r\n  case, we find McKennon distinguishable.Â  In this case, respondent\r\n  testified that when he was assigned to the S-line by Crook, he was, in essence,\r\n  offered a bolt-tightening machine.Â  That respondent's supervisor allegedly offered\r\n  him an automated method to fix a track which was &quot;in bad shape,&quot; is\r\n  evidence that arguably CSX believed this was the appropriate way for respondent\r\n  to handle the assignment.Â  Thus, the facts that (1) the machine failed, (2) it\r\n  was not fixed or replaced, and (3) respondent was required to use the manual\r\n  wrench, all weigh in favor of an inference that the manual method was not reasonably\r\n  safe.Â  Stillman, supra.Â  This inference is supported by Reed's\r\n  own testimony that he would expect a track man to\r\n  tighten only up to 24 bolts in a normal day's work, and if he knew an employee\r\n  would be tightening as many as 100 bolts in a day, he would give him a bolt\r\n  tightening machine.Â  Furthermore, respondent's experts both opined that a\r\n  manual track wrench was fine for sporadic tightening, but was, in Bowden's\r\n  words, &quot;an unsuitable tool for this job.&quot; Â \r\nGiven\r\n  this factual record, respondent has established there was a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact as to whether CSX negligently failed to provide him a\r\n  bolt-tightening machine.Â  Thus, as the Court of Appeals found, a jury should\r\n  decide the ultimate issue of whether the work method prescribed by CSX was\r\n  reasonably safe.Â  See Stillman, supra.\r\n3.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in its application\r\n  of Blair v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., 323 U.S. 600 (1945)?\r\nCSX argues that the Court of Appeals misinterpreted\r\n  the USSC's decision in Blair v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., 323 U.S. 600\r\n  (1945).Â  More specifically, CSX argues that because neither of respondent's\r\n  negligence theories should, on its own, reach the jury, Blair may not be\r\n  relied upon to send the case to the jury under a combined negligence theory.Â  We\r\n  disagree for two reasons.\r\nFirst, as discussed\r\n  above, it is our opinion respondent established there are jury questions presented\r\n  as to his two theories of negligence even if considered independently.Â  Second,\r\n  we find no error in the Court of Appeals' application of Blair.\r\nIn Blair,\r\n  the USSC stated that &quot;[t]he duty of the employer becomes more imperative\r\n  as the risk increases.&quot;Â  Id. at 604 (citations and internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).Â  Therefore, &quot;[t]he negligence of the employer\r\n  may be determined by viewing its conduct as a whole.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis added).Â  The USSC found this principle &quot;especially â€¦ true&quot;\r\n  under the facts of Blair &quot;where the several elements from which\r\n  negligence might be inferred are so closely interwoven as to form a single\r\n  pattern, and where each imparts character to the others.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In addition, the USSC noted that &quot;in close or\r\n  doubtful&quot; FELA cases, it was improper to deprive railroad workers of the\r\n  benefit of a jury trial. Â Id. at 602.\r\n\r\n\tThe Blair Court then applied these rules to the facts:\r\n\tThe nature of the duty\r\n  which the petitioner was commanded to undertake, the dangers of moving a greased,\r\n  1000 pound steel tube, 30 feet in length, on a 5 foot truck, the area over\r\n  which that truck was compelled to be moved,\r\n  the suitableness of the tools used in an extraordinary manner to accomplish a\r\n  novel purpose, the number of men assigned to assist him, their experience in\r\n  such work and their ability to perform the duties and the manner in which they\r\n  performed those duties - all of these raised questions appropriate for a\r\n    jury to appraise in considering whether or not the injury was the result of negligence\r\n    as alleged in the complaint. Â We cannot say as a matter of law that the\r\n  railroad complied with its duties in a reasonably careful manner under the\r\n  circumstances here, nor that the conduct which the\r\n  jury might have found to be negligent did not contribute to petitioner's injury\r\n  'in whole or in part.' Â Consequently we think the jury, and not the court\r\n  should finally determine these issues.\r\n\r\nId. at 604-05 (emphasis added).\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the Court of Appeals found that pursuant to Blair,\r\n  respondent was entitled to a jury trial:\r\n\r\n\tThe Blair case is controlling here.Â  To make [respondent] not only work on the entire\r\n  Andrews Subdivision of the S-line by himself all day, every day, until\r\n  completed, but also limiting his ability to make the numerous repairs by only\r\n  providing him with a manual track wrench is prima facie evidence of\r\n  negligence, if not negligence as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nMontgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. at 549, 608 S.E.2d at 451.[8]Â   \r\nWe find the Court\r\n  of Appeals correctly held that Blair supports the reversal of summary\r\n  judgment.[9]Â \r\n  The Blair Court expressly instructed that in a FELA case, the railroad's\r\n  conduct should be judged &quot;as a whole,&quot; especially when the\r\n  circumstances &quot;from which negligence might be inferred are so closely interwoven\r\n  as to form a single pattern, and where each imparts character to the others.&quot;\r\n  Â 323 U.S. at 604.Â  Clearly, this language should not be interpreted as meaning\r\n  that each theory of negligence must also stand on its own.Â  Such an interpretation\r\n  would negate the idea of looking at the employer's conduct as a whole and as\r\n  forming a pattern.\r\nWe are mindful of Blair's\r\n  admonition that &quot;[t]o deprive railroad workers of the benefit of a jury\r\n  trial in close or doubtful cases is to take away a goodly portion of the relief\r\n  which Congress has afforded them.&quot;Â  Id. at 602 (citation and\r\n  internal quotation marks omitted).Â  We believe this is such a close case where\r\n  negligence may be inferred from various circumstances in combination, i.e., by\r\n  evaluating CSX's conduct &quot;as a whole.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the Blair decision was appropriately relied upon to justify reversing summary judgment.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we affirm\r\n  as modified the Court of Appeals' opinion.Â  We affirm the Court of Appeals'\r\n  overall holding that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for CSX.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the case shall be remanded for trial. We hold, however, that in a FELA case, there is a relaxed standard of proof only on the causation element.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, J. and Acting Justice J.

Carter, of South Carolina Commission on\r\n  Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â Â Â Â  In\r\n  this case, the post-conviction relief (PCR) court granted partial relief to\r\n  Katherine Dangerfield (â€œRespondentâ€) finding that a magistrates courtâ€™s\r\n  imposition of a suspended sentence without a hearing did not afford Respondent\r\n  due process of law.Â  This Court granted certiorari to review the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  grant of relief, and we affirm.Â   \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nIn\r\n  July 2001, Respondent pled guilty to passing 110 fraudulent checks.Â  Pursuant\r\n  to a plea agreement between Respondent and the State, a magistrate sentenced\r\n  Respondent to thirty days imprisonment to be served consecutively (a total of\r\n  nine years) on each fraudulent check, but suspended the sentence conditioned\r\n  upon the payment of restitution plus court costs.Â  Respondent did not appeal\r\n  her conviction and proceeded to begin making restitution payments.\r\nThe\r\n  record reveals that Respondent ceased making restitution payments after\r\n  November 2001.Â  Thereafter, in February 2002, the magistrates court sent\r\n  Respondentâ€™s trial counsel a copy of the order reflecting the terms of the plea\r\n  agreement along with a memorandum advising counsel to contact the court or the\r\n  attorney for the State â€œif you have any questions before bench warrants are\r\n  issued.â€Â  Counsel had not been in contact with Respondent since her trial the\r\n  previous July, and counselâ€™s apparent attempts to contact Respondent regarding\r\n  this matter were unsuccessful.Â  In May 2003, the magistrate had bench warrants served\r\n  on Respondent.Â  Following Respondentâ€™s arrest, the magistrate imposed the\r\n  suspended sentence without a hearing.\r\nRespondent\r\n  filed a PCR application alleging ineffective assistance of counsel for\r\n  negotiating an unreasonable plea deal, failing to notify Respondent of the\r\n  bench warrants, and failing to request a hearing.Â  Respondent requested relief\r\n  in the form of a revised payment plan reflecting credit for time served and\r\n  credit for the checks on which she had already made restitution payments.Â  The\r\n  PCR court found that counselâ€™s conduct in negotiating a plea deal was not\r\n  objectively unreasonable; however, the court found that counselâ€™s failure to\r\n  notify Respondent of the bench warrants and to request a hearing amounted to\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel because it deprived Respondent of her due\r\n  process rights.Â  The PCR court did not vacate Respondentâ€™s guilty plea, but\r\n  ruled that Respondent was entitled to a hearing to determine whether she\r\n  willfully stopped making restitution payments.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted certiorari to review the PCR courtâ€™s decision, and the State\r\n  raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDoes the\r\n  imposition of a suspended sentence without a hearing violate a defendantâ€™s due\r\n  process rights?Â  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis\r\n  Court will uphold the findings of the PCR court when there is any evidence of\r\n  probative value to support them, and will reverse the decision of the PCR court\r\n  when it is controlled by an error&nbsp;of law.Â  Suber v. State, 371 S.C.\r\n  554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).Â   \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe\r\n  State argues that the PCR court erred in finding that the magistrateâ€™s\r\n  imposition of a suspended sentence without a hearing violated Respondentâ€™s due\r\n  process rights.Â Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nDue process considerations apply in\r\n  contested cases or hearings which affect an individualâ€™s property or liberty interests\r\n  as contemplated by the federal and state constitutions.Â  See U.S. Const.\r\n  amend. XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.Â  The procedural component of the\r\n  state and federal due process clauses requires the individual whose property or\r\n  liberty interests are affected to have received adequate notice of the proceeding, the\r\n  opportunity to be heard in person, the opportunity to introduce evidence, the\r\n  right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and the right to\r\n  meaningful judicial review.Â  See State v. Hill, 368 S.C.\r\n  649, 656, 630 S.E.2d 274, 278 (2006).\r\nIn Morrissey\r\n  v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), the United States Supreme Court confronted\r\n  procedural due process considerations as they pertained to the revocation of an\r\n  inmateâ€™s grant of parole.Â  Noting that parole does not arise until after the imposition\r\n  of a sentence, the Court found that â€œ[r]evocation [of parole] deprives an\r\n  individual, not of the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but\r\n  only of the conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special\r\n  parole restrictions.â€Â  Id. at 480.Â  The Court held that minimum\r\n  due process requirements afford a parolee the right to â€œan informal hearing\r\n  structured to assure the finding of a parole violation will be based on\r\n  verified facts and that the exercise of [the courtâ€™s] discretion will be\r\n  informed by an accurate knowledge of the paroleeâ€™s behavior.â€Â  Id. at 484.Â Â  Relying almost exclusively on the â€œconditional libertyâ€\r\n  interest described in Morrissey, the Supreme Court soon thereafter held\r\n  that due process also requires that a probationer be given a hearing before his\r\n  probation is revoked for a probation violation.Â  Gagnon v. Scarpelli,\r\n  411 U.S. 778 (1973).Â   \r\nThe State argues that the PCR\r\n  court improperly analogized the imposition of a suspended sentence to the\r\n  revocation of probation in the Morrissey/Gagnon line of cases because a\r\n  magistrate may not place a person on probation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  22-3-800 (2007) (â€œNothing in this section may be construed to give a magistrate\r\n  the right to place a person on probation.â€).Â  The State further contends that\r\n  because the statutory provisions governing Respondentâ€™s check fraud do not\r\n  expressly contain a notice and hearing requirement upon a defendantâ€™s alleged\r\n  failure to pay restitution, see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-800 and S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 34-11-90(c) (Supp. 2006), Respondent is not entitled to notice and\r\n  a hearing before a magistrate imposes a suspended sentence.Â  Though perhaps\r\n  correct as a matter of statute, the Stateâ€™s arguments completely bypass the\r\n  constitutional issues driving the federal courtsâ€™ due process jurisprudence.Â  \r\n \r\nThis\r\n  Court has interpreted Â§ 22-3-800 to prohibit a magistrates court from enforcing\r\n  substantive conditions as part of a suspended sentence where enforcement of the\r\n  conditions has the effect of placing the defendant on probation.Â  See Talley\r\n    v. State, 371 S.C. 535, 545, 640 S.E.2d 878, 883 (2007) (vacating a\r\n  magistrateâ€™s immediate suspension of the defendantâ€™s sentence on the condition\r\n  of six monthsâ€™ good behavior because the condition in effect placed the defendant\r\n  on probation).Â  In our view, the PCR courtâ€™s finding that the imposition of a\r\n  suspended sentence has the same constitutional effect as the revocation\r\n  of probation is clearly distinguishable from this Courtâ€™s finding that a\r\n  magistrateâ€™s conditional sentence has the same substantive effect as the\r\n  placement of a defendant on probation. See also Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 782\r\n  n.3 (â€œDespite the undoubted minor differences between probation and parole, the\r\n  . . . revocation of probation where sentence has been imposed previously is\r\n  constitutionally indistinguishable from the revocation of parole.â€).Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find that regardless of the statutory limitations on a magistrateâ€™s\r\n  authority in probation matters, the PCR court did not err in drawing an analogy\r\n  to the due process implications inherent in probation revocation.Â   \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we find that the PCR court correctly determined that the imposition of a\r\n  suspended sentence in this case is constitutionally equivalent to the\r\n  revocation of parole or probation.Â  The imposition of a suspended sentence,\r\n  like probation and parole revocation, arises after the court has sentenced a\r\n  defendant in a criminal prosecution.Â  Therefore, although the imposition of the\r\n  sentence does not deprive Respondent of the absolute liberty guaranteed a free\r\n  citizen, the imposition of the sentence does, in fact, deprive Respondent of\r\n  the conditional liberty dependent on her compliance with the restitution\r\n  payment plan in her plea agreement.Â  \r\nLike\r\n  that of parolees and probationers, the extent of Respondentâ€™s conditional\r\n  liberty interest encompasses many of the core values of absolute liberty.Â Â \r\n  Respondent may spend unlimited time with family and friends, take on gainful\r\n  employment, and participate in other hobbies and activities available to unincarcerated\r\n  members of society.Â  Although the Stateâ€™s governance of Respondentâ€™s financial\r\n  affairs in accordance with the strict terms of the restitution plan is not a\r\n  component of the absolute liberty afforded citizens who have never been\r\n  convicted of a crime, the condition that Respondent pay restitution is a far\r\n  cry from serving nine years in prison.Â  See Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 482 (discussing the liberty interest of a parolee).Â  Accordingly, we hold that the\r\n  PCR court properly determined that the imposition of a suspended sentence\r\n  implicated Respondentâ€™s due process rights.Â Â   \r\nIn\r\n  recognizing that parole and probation revocation proceedings must comply with\r\n  minimum due process requirements, this Court has held that probation may not be\r\n  revoked solely for failure to make required payments of fines or restitution.Â  Nichols\r\n    v. State, 308 S.C. 334, 337, 417 S.E.2d 860, 862 (1992).Â  Specifically, in\r\n  cases involving the failure to pay fines or restitution, we have held that due\r\n  process requires the court to first make a determination on the record that the\r\n  probationer willfully violated these terms of probation.Â  Id.Â  Because\r\n  we find no constitutional distinction between the payment of restitution as a\r\n  condition of suspended sentencing and the payment of restitution as a condition\r\n  of probation, the PCR court correctly determined that an issue to be explored\r\n  during Respondentâ€™s hearing is whether Respondentâ€™s failure to continue paying\r\n  restitution was a willful violation of her conditional sentence.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that the PCR court properly concluded that due process requires that\r\n  Respondent be afforded notice and a hearing on the willfulness of her alleged\r\n  failure to pay restitution before the imposition of a suspended sentence.\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  affirm the decision of the PCR court.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26413","title":"State v.

The Defendant agrees to provide complete and thorough cooperation to the .\r\n  . . solicitorâ€™s office and all involved law enforcement agencies, including\r\n  giving true and honest testimony at any appropriate judicial proceeding.Â  The Defendant\r\n  further agrees that his written statement dated June 27th, 2004, in\r\n  which he confessed to the murder . . . is true and accurate.\r\n\t. . . In the event that the Defendant does not comply\r\n  with the conditions of this plea agreement, the State shall move to have his\r\n  negotiated sentence vacated.Â  The Defendantâ€™s guilty plea would remain in\r\n  effect, and he would be subject to the full penalty of each charge in the\r\n  discretion of the Court. . . .\r\n\r\nIn March 2005,\r\n  appellant pled guilty.Â  The State placed the plea on the record and noted the\r\n  requirement that appellant had agreed to testify and cooperate fully.Â \r\n  Appellant informed the plea judge that he understood these requirements.Â  The\r\n  State noted on the record from the written plea agreement that if appellant\r\n  withdrew his cooperation, his pleas would remain and there would be a\r\n  re-sentencing.Â  Appellant stated he agreed with and understood that portion of\r\n  the agreement.Â  The plea judge then sentenced appellant consistently with the\r\n  agreement.\r\nWoodyâ€™s case went\r\n  to trial in May 2005.Â  A few days before the trial began, appellant changed his\r\n  story regarding how and why the crime had occurred.Â  The story was inconsistent\r\n  with the previous statement he gave police.Â  Appellantâ€™s attorney stated that\r\n  he advised appellant that if he did not testify and comply with the plea\r\n  agreement, he could be re-sentenced.Â  Appellant did not testify in Woodyâ€™s\r\n  trial and previous statements made by appellant were not admitted at the\r\n  trial.Â  At the conclusion of the trial, Woody received a sentence of life\r\n  imprisonment without parole.\r\nThe plea judge\r\n  presided over appellantâ€™s plea and Woodyâ€™s trial.Â  In August 2005, a hearing\r\n  was held in front of the plea judge on the Stateâ€™s motion to vacate appellantâ€™s\r\n  sentence due to noncompliance with the plea agreement.Â  Appellant stated he did\r\n  not refute the Stateâ€™s position regarding noncompliance; however, he argued the\r\n  plea judge did not have subject matter jurisdiction to re-sentence him.Â \r\n  Appellant contended that, pursuant to Rule 29, SCRCrimP, the State should have\r\n  filed a formal motion at the time of sentencing or within ten days after the\r\n  completion of Woodyâ€™s trial.Â  The State countered that no motion was required\r\n  because appellant was on notice that if he did not comply with the agreement,\r\n  then his sentence could be vacated.\r\nThe plea judge stated\r\n  appellantâ€™s sentence was a conditional sentence that was subject to change.Â \r\n  The judge found the State was entitled to the benefit of its bargain and that\r\n  the plea agreement should be enforced.Â  Appellant was re-sentenced to life\r\n  imprisonment without parole on the murder charge and the other sentences\r\n  remained the same.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid\r\n  the plea judge lack jurisdiction to grant the Stateâ€™s motion to re-sentence\r\n  appellant five months after his guilty plea and sentencing?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIt is a long-standing rule\r\n  of law that a trial judge is without jurisdiction to consider a criminal matter\r\n  once the term of court during which judgment was entered expires.Â  State v.\r\n    Hinson, 303 S.C. 92, 399 S.E.2d 422 (1990).Â  See also State v.\r\n      Best, 257 S.C. 361, 186 S.E.2d 272 (1972) (trial judge is without authority\r\n  to pursue a case after the term of court has adjourned).Â  Each week of court is\r\n  a separate term.Â  State v. Mixon, 275 S.C. 575, 274 S.E.2d 406 (1981).Â \r\n  The rule has two exceptions:Â  a timely post-trial motion and a motion for a new\r\n  trial based on after-discovered evidence. Â Rule 29, SCRCrimP.Â  Rule 29 states\r\n  that, except for motions for new trials based on after-discovered evidence,\r\n  post-trial motions shall be made within ten days after the imposition of the\r\n  sentence.[1]Â \r\n  Rule 29 further states that the courtâ€™s jurisdiction to hear the motion will\r\n  not expire with the term of court if the party has filed a timely motion.Â \r\n  However, if the motion is not made within ten days of sentencing, the court\r\n  will be without jurisdiction to entertain the motion.\r\nAppellantâ€™s issue\r\n  frames the term of court rule as a rule of subject matter jurisdiction;\r\n  however, this rule does not involve subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We have stated\r\n  that a trial court lacks jurisdiction over a matter once the term of court has\r\n  ended.Â  While we have used the â€œjurisdictionâ€ language, we have not stated that\r\n  the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction when the term of court ends.Â  See, e.g., State v. Hinson, supra; State v. Walker,\r\n  269 S.C. 349, 237 S.E.2d 583 (1976); State v. Best, supra.Â  When\r\n  we used the â€œlack of jurisdictionâ€ language, we meant that the trial court\r\n  simply no longer has the power to act in a particular manner because the term\r\n  of court has ended.Â  At least three Court of Appealsâ€™ cases have discussed or\r\n  mentioned the term of court rule as being a rule of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  See State v.

Rhinehart, 312 S.C. 36, 430\r\n  S.E.2d 536 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  However, framing the rule as a subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  rule is incorrect.\r\nIn State v.\r\n  Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005), we emphasized that subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the\r\n  general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  A circuit court judgeâ€™s\r\n  power to hear criminal cases is not eliminated once a term of court ends; the\r\n  power is lost only as to the particular criminal case that the judge heard\r\n  within a particular term of court.Â  Given Gentry, the term of court rule\r\n  is not a rule of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nPursuant to our case\r\n  law and Rule 29, the plea judge lacked authority to re-sentence appellant\r\n  because the State did not file a timely Rule 29 motion after appellantâ€™s\r\n  sentencing.Â  We note the typical procedure in this situation is that a\r\n  defendant pleads guilty pursuant to a plea agreement and then the defendantâ€™s\r\n  sentencing is held in abeyance until after the defendant has cooperated at the\r\n  co-defendantâ€™s trial.Â  Had the typical procedure occurred, the plea judge would\r\n  have had the authority to sentence appellant outside of his plea agreement\r\n  after he failed to testify at his co-defendantâ€™s trial.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the term of court rule does not\r\n  involve subject matter jurisdiction and is simply a rule involving the\r\n  authority of the court to hear a matter it heard in a previous term.Â  We find\r\n  the judge should not have entertained the Stateâ€™s motion to vacate appellantâ€™s\r\n  sentence given the State did not file a Rule 29 motion.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  ruling of the plea judge is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The State argues that its motion to vacate appellantâ€™s\r\n  sentence is akin to a motion based on after-discovered evidence which is not\r\n  bound by the ten-day time limit.Â  However, this situation is not what is\r\n  intended by the rule on after-discovered evidence.Â  See State v.\r\n    Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 508 S.E.2d 857 (1998) (to prevail on a motion for a\r\n  new trial based on after-discovered evidence, a defendant must\r\n  show (1) the evidence is such as will\r\n  probably change the result if a new trial is granted; (2) the evidence has been\r\n  discovered since the trial; (3) the evidence could not have been discovered prior to trial by the exercise of due diligence;\r\n  (4) the evidence is material; and (5) the evidence is not merely cumulative or\r\n  impeaching).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26414","title":"Kurschner v.

Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-350(B) (2004).Â  Additionally, the South Carolina Constitution prohibits\r\n  dual office holding.Â  See S.C. Const. art. III, Â§ 24 and art. VI, Â§ 3.Â  \r\n \r\nCommission member Laura Funderburk was elected to the House\r\n  of Representatives in a special election.Â  At the time of the hearing regarding\r\n  the Kurschnerâ€™s application, Funderburk had not yet taken the oath of office.Â  Pursuant\r\n  to Funderburkâ€™s inquiry, the House Legislative Ethics Committee (â€œethics committeeâ€)\r\n  issued an advisory letter opining that because there were no statutory or\r\n  constitutional provisions providing when the winner of a special election\r\n  begins her term of office, Funderburkâ€™s term would not begin until she took the\r\n  oath of office.Â  The ethics committee thus concluded that she was free to\r\n  exercise all of her duties as a member of the Commission.Â  The circuit court\r\n  adopted the ethics committeeâ€™s position and rejected the Kurschnerâ€™s argument\r\n  that the case should be remanded as a result of Funderburkâ€™s failure to recuse\r\n  herself.Â   \r\nWe hold\r\n  that Funderburk was not required to recuse herself from participating in the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s decision. Â There are no constitutional or statutory provisions\r\n  providing when the winner of a special election begins the term.Â  Thus, in the\r\n  absence of such authority, the most logical point at which a representative could\r\n  begin the term of office is upon taking the oath of office.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Const. art. III, Â§ 26 (providing that members of the legislature must take an\r\n  oath of office before exercising their duties of office).Â  However, even assuming\r\n  Funderburk was holding office, the Kurschners point to no authority indicating\r\n  that the decision is automatically void and cannot show that Funderburkâ€™s\r\n  participation violated their due process rights.Â  Specifically, the Kurschners cannot demonstrate that\r\n  they were prejudiced by Funderburkâ€™s participation because even without\r\n  Funderburkâ€™s vote, there remained six votes opposing the application, as the\r\n  Commission unanimously voted against approval.Â  See Tall Tower, Inc. v. S.C. Procurement Review\r\n    Panel, 294\r\n  S.C. 225, 233, 363 S.E.2d 683, 687 (1988)\r\n  (holding that a demonstration of substantial prejudice is required\r\n  to establish a due process claim).\r\nFor these reasons,\r\n  we hold that the Commissionâ€™s decision should not be reversed as a result of Funderburkâ€™s participation.\r\nII. Procedural Due Process\r\nThe Kurschners\r\n  present a two-pronged due process argument.Â  First, the Kurschners argue that\r\n  they were effectively deprived of due process at the hearing before the\r\n  Commission because the Commission did not inform them of the opposing evidence\r\n  prior to trial, considered hearsay evidence, deprived them of the opportunity\r\n  to cross-examine adverse witnesses, and failed to allow them to conduct voir\r\n    dire questioning of the members of the Commission.Â  Second, the Kurschners\r\n  argue that they were deprived of due process on appeal because the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s application of the any evidence standard of review amounted to no\r\n  judicial review. Â We disagree as to both arguments.\r\nProcedural due process imposes constraints on governmental\r\n  decisions which deprive individuals of liberty or property interests within the\r\n  meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment of the\r\n  United States Constitution.Â  Mathews\r\n    v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976).Â  The fundamental requirements of due process include notice, an\r\n  opportunity to be heard in a meaningful way, and judicial review. Â S.C. Const.\r\n  art. 1, Â§ 22; Stono River Envtl. Protection Assâ€™n v. S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Health and Envtl. Control, 305 S.C. 90, 94, 406 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1991).Â  Due process does not require a\r\n  trial-type hearing in every conceivable case of government impairment of a private\r\n  interest. Â First Fed.\r\n    Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n of Walterboro v. Bd. of Bank Control, 263\r\n  S.C. 59, 65, 207 S.E.2d 801, 804 (1974)\r\n  (quoting Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy,\r\n  367 U.S. 886, 894 (1961)). Â Rather, due process is flexible and calls for such\r\n  procedural protections as the particular situation demands.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 352\r\n  S.C. 445, 452, 574 S.E.2d 730, 733 (2002).\r\nIn our\r\n  view, due process does not require the full gamut of rules and procedures to\r\n  which the Kurschners claim they were entitled.Â  While due process may require a trial-type\r\n  hearing in fact-specific, adjudicatory decisions of an administrative body, the\r\n  power exercised by the Commission and the individual interests at stake in this\r\n  case are very different. Â See In re Vora, 354\r\n  S.C. 590, 582 S.E.2d 413 (2003) (involving the procedures\r\n  required in revocation of a doctorâ€™s clinical privileges after allegations of\r\n  deficient performance); Wilson, 352 S.C. at 456, 574 S.E.2d at\r\n  735 (requiring additional\r\n  procedural safeguards in a proceeding regarding child abuse allegations); Brown\r\n    v. S.C. State Bd. of Educ., 301 S.C. 326, 391 S.E.2d 866 (1990)\r\n  (addressing the procedures required in a proceeding concerning the revocation\r\n  of a teacherâ€™s license).Â  Specifically, the decision to deny the Kurcshnerâ€™s\r\n  application to subdivide their land was an exercise of discretionary authority,\r\n  as opposed to adjudicatory power.Â  The legislature expressly granted this\r\n  discretionary authority in the area of local planning to the Commission.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-340 (2005) (conferring municipal planning commissions\r\n  with the power to implement and to oversee the administration of regulations\r\n  for the growth and development of land).Â   \r\nRegarding the requested procedural safeguards in this case, the\r\n  Kurschners point to no authority for excluding hearsay evidence in planning\r\n  commission decisions, nor do they provide any authority holding that\r\n  individuals are entitled to conduct voir dire in land-use planning\r\n  hearings.Â  In our view, the additional procedures that the Kurschners request\r\n  would not aid the Commission in making its decision, but would greatly hinder its\r\n  ability to make an informed and reasoned decision, as well as intrude upon a\r\n  municipalityâ€™s statutorily-granted legislative authority.Â  Accordingly, we hold that due process does not require\r\n  the Commission to employ these rules and procedural safeguards in making these\r\n  types of discretionary decisions.Â  See Matthews, 424 U.S. at 335 (holding that in determining the\r\n  process which is due, a court will consider the private interest affected by\r\n  the proceeding, the risk of error created by the chosen procedure, and the\r\n  countervailing governmental interest supporting challenged procedure).Â   \r\nFurthermore, review of the procedures in this case reveals that\r\n  the Kurschners were afforded a meaningful opportunity to be heard.Â \r\n  Specifically, the Commission held a public hearing where the Kurschners submitted twenty-six exhibits to support their\r\n  application including tax information, three letters of support, title history,\r\n  and information regarding prior subdivisions of Sarsfield.Â  Additionally, the Commission did not preclude the Kurschners from\r\n  accessing the evidence in opposition to their application, which mostly\r\n  consisted of public information regarding the historical significance of\r\n  Sarsfield.Â  See Clear\r\n    Channel Outdoor v. City of Myrtle Beach, 372 S.C. 230, 642 S.E.2d 565 (2007)\r\n  (finding no procedural due process violation where the zoning board provided an\r\n  applicant a meaningful opportunity to be heard regarding whether the applicant\r\n  was entitled to a permit to replace a billboard).\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we believe that the Kurschnerâ€™s argument regarding judicial review is wholly\r\n  mistaken.Â  The Kurschnerâ€™s argue that the\r\n  trial court should have considered the substance of the evidence, and failing\r\n  to do so deprived them of a meaningful review of the decision.Â  In our view,\r\n  the Kurschners are essentially urging this Court to reject the any evidence\r\n  standard of appellate review that is consistently-utilized in these types of\r\n  cases and asking us to adopt an appellate review somewhere between a substantial\r\n  evidence and de novo in examining decisions of a planning commission.Â  We\r\n  decline to do so.Â   \r\nBy\r\n  statute, the trial court must uphold the Commissionâ€™s decision unless there is\r\n  no evidence to support it.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-840 (2005) (â€œThe findings of fact by the board of appeals must\r\n  be treated in the same manner as a finding of fact by a juryâ€); Townes\r\n    Assocâ€™s, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266\r\n  S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (holding that factual findings of the\r\n  jury will not be disturbed unless there is no evidence which reasonably\r\n  supports the juryâ€™s findings).Â  We refuse to apply a standard of\r\n  review different from the any evidence standard in this case, for any\r\n  other standard of review would be contrary to the legislatureâ€™s intent in\r\n  granting a planning commission broad discretion in this area.Â  Furthermore, this\r\n  standard of review does not violate the Kurschnerâ€™s due process rights.Â  Fairfield Ocean Ridge, Inc. v. Town of Edisto Beach, 294 S.C. 475, 480, 366 S.E.2d 15, 18 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988) (holding the any evidence standard of review in zoning decisions does not\r\n  violate procedural due process). [3]\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Commissionâ€™s decision did not violate\r\n  the Kurschnerâ€™s procedural due process rights.Â   \r\nIII. Whether the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s Decision is Affected by an Error of Law\r\nFinally,\r\n  the Kurschners argue that the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by the\r\n  evidence, controlled by an error of law, and resulted in a taking without just\r\n  compensation.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nA\r\n  decision of a zoning board will not be upheld where it is based on errors of\r\n  law, where there is no legal evidence to support it, where the board acts\r\n  arbitrarily or unreasonably, or where, in general, the board has abused its\r\n  discretion.Â  Peterson Outdoor Advertising v.\r\n    City of Myrtle Beach, 327 S.C. 230, 235, 489 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1997).\r\nIn\r\n  denying the Kurschnerâ€™s application to subdivide their property the\r\n  Commission relied on Â§\r\n  156.41(B)(2)(e) of the City of Camdenâ€™s Land Development Regulations, which provides\r\n  that historic sites â€œshall be preserved to the extent consistent with the\r\n  reasonable utilization of the site.â€Â  The Kurschners contend that this\r\n  regulation requires that the Commission perform a balancing test to determine\r\n  whether the proposed subdivision is an unreasonable use of the land and is\r\n  inconsistent with its preservation.Â  The Kurschners argue that\r\n  because the Commission failed to apply this balancing standard, the decision\r\n  was controlled by an error of law.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  our view, the Kurschners misinterpret this regulation.Â  The regulation merely\r\n  directs the Commission to determine whether subdividing the property will\r\n  negatively impact the historic value of the site.Â  The regulation does not\r\n  mandate that the Commission apply a balancing test.Â  Byerly v. Connor, 307 S.C. 441, 444, 415 S.E.2d\r\n  796, 799 (1992) (holding that the words of a\r\n  regulation must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to\r\n  subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the regulationâ€™s operation).Â  The\r\n  Commission found that subdividing Sarsfield would negatively impact the\r\n  historical value of the property, and evidence in the record supports this\r\n  finding.Â  Furthermore, in addition to Â§ 156.41(B)(2)(e), the Commission based\r\n  its decision on several other regulations, as well as the City of Camdenâ€™s Comprehensive Plan.Â  Thus, the Kurschnerâ€™s argument with respect to Â§\r\n  156.41(B)(2)(e) addresses only part of the Commissionâ€™s decision and cannot independently\r\n  require reversal. Â \r\nFinally,\r\n  any issues regarding whether this decision constituted a taking without just\r\n  compensation may not be considered at this time.Â  This is a direct appeal from a\r\n  decision regarding whether to uphold the Commissionâ€™s decision denying the\r\n  Kurschnerâ€™s application to subdivide their property.Â  Any resulting issues\r\n  raised by the operation of that decision would be not be ripe for judicial\r\n  review at this stage, and those issues should be litigated in a separate\r\n  action.Â  Waters\r\n    v. S.C. Land Resources Conservation Comâ€™n, 321 S.C. 219, 227, 467 S.E.2d\r\n  913, 917-18 (1996) (holding that a justiciable\r\n  controversy is a real and substantial controversy which is ripe\r\n  and appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from a contingent,\r\n  hypothetical or abstract dispute).Â   \r\nTherefore,\r\n  we uphold the Commissionâ€™s decision because it is not controlled by an error of\r\n  law and it is supported by evidence in the record.Â  See Â§ 6-29-840 (â€œIn determining the questions\r\n  presented by the appeal, the court must determine only whether the decision of\r\n  the board is correct as a matter of law.â€).\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Commissionâ€™s decision in\r\n  denying the Kurschnerâ€™s application to subdivide their property.Â   \r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Chestnut is the author of A Diary from Dixie, which she wrote while\r\n  living at Sarsfield.Â   \r\n[2] Pursuant to Rule 203(d)(1)(A)(ii), SCACR, a party may file a direct appeal in\r\n  this Court from â€œ[a]ny final judgment involving a challenge on state or federal\r\n  grounds to the constitutionality of a state law or county or municipal\r\n  ordinance where the principal issue is one of the constitutionality of the law\r\n  or ordinance.â€\r\n[3] The Kurschners filed a motion to argue against precedent and urge this Court to\r\n  revisit Fairfield Ocean Ridge and hold that the any evidence standard of\r\n  review violates procedural due process.Â  The Kurschners have failed to present\r\n  a compelling argument to overturn that case and we therefore decline to do so.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26415","title":"In the Matter of Jasper County Magistrate Donna D.

Â Respondent\r\n  informed the Chief Magistrate that she did not have the reconciliations because\r\n  her office assistant, Paula Willis, needed additional time to sort out some\r\n  discrepancies with the deposits to the civil and criminal magistrate court\r\n  accounts.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThereafter, the Chief Magistrate asked\r\n  another magistrate court employee, Nancy Grullon, to meet with respondent and\r\n  Ms. Willis to review the bank accounts and assist them with the\r\n  reconciliations.Â  When respondent informed Ms. Willis of the meeting to review\r\n  the bank accounts, Ms. Willis became irate, left for lunch, and never returned\r\n  to the office.Â  \r\nRespondent then personally reviewed the\r\n  court checking accounts and immediately realized that all deposits were not\r\n  being made into the accounts.Â Â  Respondent and Ms. Grullon discovered a bank\r\n  bag in Ms. Willisâ€™ desk drawer that contained cash in the amount of $1,322.00\r\n  and non-deposited checks in the amount of $4,410.00.Â  In addition, respondent\r\n  and Ms. Grullon found a $25.00 money order in an unopened envelope and one\r\n  check dated November 14, 2006 in the amount of $65.00 which had not been\r\n  deposited.Â  There was no identifying information to tie the cash to individual\r\n  defendants or cases.Â  \r\nAn examination by county staff of\r\n  respondentâ€™s magistrate court bank records revealed an approximate shortage of\r\n  $15,741.82 as of July 2007.Â  An investigation into the exact amount of the\r\n  shortage is ongoing.Â  \r\nOn or about June 23, 2007, Ms. Willis\r\n  gave a written statement to investigators in which she stated she had been employed\r\n  by the county for six or eight years and with the magistrateâ€™s office for the\r\n  last three years.Â  She further stated that, within the previous six to eight\r\n  months, she had become behind on her personal bills and, at some point, stopped\r\n  making deposits of cash money in the magistrate court accounts and began taking\r\n  sums from the court accounts to pay her bills.Â  Ms. Willis took full\r\n  responsibility for the missing money stating respondent had â€œnothing to do with\r\n  this.â€Â  \r\nFrom approximately August 2006 until June\r\n  2007, respondent had relied solely on Ms. Willis to handle court money and\r\n  reconcile bank statements.Â  Respondent admitted to investigators that had she\r\n  been reconciling the bank statements, this problem would have been discovered\r\n  sooner.Â  Further, respondent admitted that she had received training but had\r\n  not performed her duties as required.Â  Finally, respondent admitted she did not\r\n  properly supervise Ms. Willis and did not supervise or conduct reconciliations\r\n  of her official accounts. Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy her misconduct, respondent has\r\n  violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct:Â  \r\nCanon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the\r\n    appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and\r\n    comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public\r\n    confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 3 (judge\r\n    shall perform the duties of judicial office diligently); Canon 3(C)(1) (judge\r\n    shall diligently discharge her administrative responsibilities without bias or\r\n    prejudice and maintain professional competence in judicial administration and\r\n    should cooperate with other judges and court officials in the administration of\r\n    court business); and Canon 3(C)(2) (judge shall require staff to observe the\r\n    standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge).Â  Â Â \r\nBy violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent has\r\n  also violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement,\r\n  Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In addition, she violated Rule 7(a)(7), RJDE, by willfully\r\n  violating a valid court order issued by a court of this state.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants\r\n  a suspension from judicial duties.Â  We therefore accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent for ninety (90) days.Â  Within\r\n  thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs\r\n  incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the\r\n  Commission on Judicial Conduct.Â Â  Â \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26416","title":"In the Matter of John W.

Morris, Jr., of one count of engaging in a\r\n  scheme to commit securities fraud and twenty-two counts of securities\r\n  fraud.Â  On appeal, Morris questions the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s rulings as to his motion to dismiss the indictment, the\r\n  introduction of several pieces of testimony and evidence, and the law on\r\n  securities fraud charged to the jury.Â  Finding no error in the trial courtâ€™s decisions on these issues, we\r\n  affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThis\r\n  case involves criminal charges arising out of the collapse of Carolina Investors,\r\n  Inc., an investment company headquartered in\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  Pickens County,\r\n  \r\n  South Carolina.Â  Appellant Earle E. Morris, Jr.,\r\n  (â€œAppellantâ€), joined Carolina Investors in 1972 as a member of the companyâ€™s\r\n  board of directors, and eventually became chairman of the board.Â  Both prior to and during this time period,\r\n  Appellant maintained an active political life.[1]Â  Upon his retirement from state government in\r\n  1999, Appellant entered into an employment relationship with Carolina\r\n  Investors.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the business operations of Carolina Investors changed dramatically from the\r\n  companyâ€™s creation until it closed, the company raised capital for its\r\n  operations in roughly the same manner throughout its existence.Â  Carolina Investors operated much like an\r\n  uninsured savings and loan association, raising capital through the public sale\r\n  of debentures and other debt instruments.Â  Carolina Investors initially used the funds generated from these sales\r\n  to finance individual sales of cemetery plots.Â  The companyâ€™s services eventually expanded to include a variety of other\r\n  lending, primarily in the sub-prime market.Â   \r\nSince\r\n  the companyâ€™s creation, a hallmark of Carolina Investors was a feature known as\r\n  â€œthe fifteen minute rule.â€Â  This rule\r\n  operated to allow investors to redeem their debentures at any time prior to\r\n  maturity, but provided for a reduced rate of interest upon such\r\n  redemption.Â  According to the company, an\r\n  investor could redeem a debenture at any time and have their money â€œin fifteen\r\n  minutes.â€Â   \r\nIn\r\n  1991, Carolina Investors became a wholly owned subsidiary of National Railway\r\n  Utilization Corporation, which eventually became the company HomeGold,\r\n  Inc.Â  Roughly four years later, Carolina\r\n  Investors ceased its external lending activities.Â  Although the company continued to raise funds\r\n  by selling debentures, Carolina Investors simply transferred these funds\r\n  directly to HomeGold or its other subsidiaries.Â  HomeGold and its subsidiaries primarily used these funds to expand their\r\n  business operations and pay operating expenses.Â  Although the companies were profitable at one time, HomeGold began to\r\n  experience substantial operating losses in 1998.Â  These losses continued to mount, and when\r\n  HomeGold failed to transfer funds sufficient to cover investorsâ€™ requests to\r\n  withdraw the balance of their debentures from Carolina Investors, the\r\n  businesses closed.\r\nThe\r\n  criminal charges that form the basis of the instant case arose primarily out of\r\n  Appellantâ€™s conduct in the year immediately preceding the collapse of Carolina\r\n  Investors and HomeGold.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the State alleged that in the waning time period of Carolina Investorsâ€™\r\n  operation, Appellant had a great deal of information regarding the dire\r\n  financial condition of HomeGold and the growing probability that HomeGold would\r\n  never be able to repay its debt to Carolina Investors.Â  Rumors of the companiesâ€™ continued viability\r\n  began to surface with increasing regularity, and the State alleged that as\r\n  individual customers contacted Carolina Investors with concerns, either in\r\n  person or over the phone, Carolina Investors employees systematically referred\r\n  these investors to Appellant, who then misled the investors with false\r\n  assurances of current and future profitability.Â  The State also alleged that in some circumstances, customers were able\r\n  to redeem debentures without having first spoken with Appellant, and that\r\n  Appellant would thereafter personally contact these individuals and attempt to\r\n  persuade them to re-invest with Carolina Investors.Â  According to the State, Appellantâ€™s\r\n  misrepresentations caused investors to leave funds on deposit that they would\r\n  otherwise have withdrawn and persuaded investors to deposit additional funds or\r\n  re-invest withdrawn funds with the company.Â  The State alleged that Appellantâ€™s actions were in furtherance of a\r\n  scheme to keep a steady stream of money flowing to HomeGold.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Appellant asserted that his projections to investors were not\r\n  intentional misrepresentations, but were instead genuinely held sentiments\r\n  based upon projections received from executives at HomeGold or their\r\n  professional consultants.Â  Appellant\r\n  further argued that his position as chairman of Carolina Investorsâ€™ board of\r\n  directors was merely an illusory position, and that he was kept in the dark as\r\n  to the companyâ€™s bleak financial situation.Â  The jury ultimately convicted Appellant of one count of engaging in a\r\n  scheme to commit securities fraud and twenty-two individual counts of\r\n  securities fraud. Â The trial court\r\n  sentenced Appellant to forty-four months imprisonment, and this appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nThis\r\n  Court certified the case from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\n  SCACR, and Appellant presents multiple issues for this Courtâ€™s review:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tShould Appellant have been \r\n\t\t\tgranted immunity as a result of his pre-trial statement to \r\n\t\t\trepresentatives of the\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  South Carolina\r\n  securities commissioner?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tcharging the jury that criminal securities fraud could include \r\n\t\t\tconduct exhibiting â€œextreme recklessness,â€ â€œsevere recklessness,â€ \r\n\t\t\tand â€œextreme indifference?â€\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tallowing certain testimony from the Stateâ€™s corporations and \r\n\t\t\tsecurities law expert? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tdisallowing testimony from Appellantâ€™s legal ethics expert?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\texcluding the report prepared by the bankruptcy courtâ€™s examiner?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tdenying Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss the indictment?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tdenying Appellantâ€™s request for a continuance?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Immunity from Prosecution\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court should have granted him immunity as a result of his\r\n  pre-trial statement to representatives of the\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  South Carolina securities commissioner.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn State v.

I, Â§ 12 to require transactional\r\n  immunity for compelled testimony).Â  In Thrift, we addressed the question of\r\n  immunity in the context of compelled testimony before the State Grand\r\n  Jury.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id.\r\n  at 296, 440 S.E.2d at 349.Â  Although this\r\n  Court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision dismissing the indictments against\r\n  several defendants on a number of alternative grounds, we nevertheless held\r\n  that the then-applicable immunity statute providing simply for use immunity\r\n  failed to comport with the Constitutionâ€™s demands.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id. at 301,\r\n  440 S.E.2d at 351.\r\nAppellant\r\n  asserts Thrift requires that he be\r\n  granted immunity from prosecution in this case.Â  Specifically, Appellant argues that the Attorney General used his\r\n  statutory authority as securities commissioner to compel Appellant to offer self-incriminating\r\n  testimony.[2]Â  Though intriguing at first blush, this\r\n  argument is not supported by the facts of the instant case.\r\nThriftâ€™s\r\n  compulsion requirement supplies the first hurdle that Appellantâ€™s argument\r\n  cannot negotiate.Â  More specifically, Appellant\r\n  was not compelled to appear before the securities commissioner, nor was\r\n  Appellant compelled to answer any questions before the commissionerâ€™s\r\n  representatives.Â  The record instead reflects\r\n  that very shortly after the collapse of Carolina Investors and HomeGold, the\r\n  securities commissioner issued a subpoena duces\r\n    tecum requesting that Carolina Investors, the president of the company, and\r\n  the chairman of the board supply documents and records relating to the business.Â  We find it instructive that this subpoena was\r\n  not directed to any individuals, nor did it request any personal appearances.Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough\r\n  Appellant argued in testimony to the trial court that he was â€œcompelledâ€ to\r\n  attend the meeting with the representatives of the securities commissioner,\r\n  Appellant later testified that he advised a member of the securities\r\n  commissionerâ€™s staff that he desired to personally meet and discuss the\r\n  situation, as he and other representatives of the company had often done in the\r\n  past.Â  Appellant no doubt felt a strong\r\n  desire to appear before the securities commissioner to provide information and\r\n  be of assistance, but we think that a strong desire to provide assistance\r\n  cannot be the equivalent of compulsion.Â  See Thrift, 312 S.C. at 297, 440 S.E.2d\r\n  at 349 (speaking of compelled testimony as testimony wrung from a person by\r\n  force).Â  Because there is no evidence\r\n  that the securities commissioner compelled Appellantâ€™s testimony, Appellantâ€™s\r\n  argument based on Thrift is\r\n  inapposite.\r\nTo\r\n  achieve his desired result through an alternate route, Appellant makes the\r\n  novel argument that in order to avoid Thriftâ€™s\r\n  rule regarding immunity, the securities commissioner was required to inform\r\n  Appellant of his constitutional right against self-incrimination and obtain a valid\r\n  waiver of that right prior to questioning Appellant.Â  Again, we disagree.\r\nAppellantâ€™s\r\n  argument here presumes too much.Â  Essentially, Appellant argues that the securities commissioner may not\r\n  place a person under oath without advising the person of his constitutional\r\n  rights, and that the failure to do so should require a de facto finding of\r\n  compulsion.Â  Though the most prudent\r\n  practice in any investigative scenario would always be for law enforcement to\r\n  advise any person from whom information is sought of the individualâ€™s constitutional\r\n  rights, the Constitution does not require such prudence.Â  The law instead requires only that the government\r\n  apprise a person of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination when\r\n  the person is subjected to interrogation while in the custody of law\r\n  enforcement.Â  See e.g. State v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 583, 582 S.E.2d 407, 409-410\r\n  (2003) (citing Miranda v. Arizona,\r\n  384\r\n  \r\n        \r\n    U.S.\r\n  436, 444 (1966)).Â  Accordingly, we focus\r\n  our inquiry, as did the trial court, on whether Appellant was in custody when\r\n  he gave his statement to the securities commissionerâ€™s representatives.\r\nIn\r\n  our view, Appellant was not in custody when he gave his statement to\r\n  representatives of the securities commissioner.Â  The evidence illustrates that Appellant was not ordered to appear at the\r\n  meeting, there is no evidence that Appellant was a suspect of any crime at this\r\n  point, and there is no evidence that Appellant was prohibited from leaving at\r\n  any point.Â  Although the evidence\r\n  illustrates that the interview occurred at the securities division in the\r\n  Attorney Generalâ€™s office, there is no evidence as to who requested that the\r\n  meeting occur there, nor is there evidence that the purpose of this meeting was\r\n  to elicit incriminating statements from Appellant.Â  Because Appellant cannot point to any factors\r\n  demonstrating that he gave his statement while in the governmentâ€™s custody, the\r\n  securities commissioner was under no obligation to advise Appellant of his\r\n  constitutional rights.\r\nAs a\r\n  final immunity-based argument, Appellant argues that the State impermissibly\r\n  pursued criminal charges against him under the guise of the securities\r\n  commissionerâ€™s administrative investigation into the collapse of Carolina\r\n  Investors. We disagree.\r\nAppellant\r\n  draws on both this Courtâ€™s precedent and federal precedent in support of his\r\n  argument.Â  In State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000), the\r\n  trial court refused to disqualify a circuit solicitorâ€™s office from prosecuting\r\n  a defendant where several sheriffâ€™s officers and a deputy solicitor monitored\r\n  and recorded a privileged communication between the defendant and his\r\n  attorney.Â  This Court reversed, and in\r\n  doing so, the Court held that deliberate prosecutorial misconduct raises an\r\n  irrebuttable presumption of prejudice.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id.\r\n  at 449, 527 S.E.2d at 109.Â  The Court\r\n  noted that â€œ[t]he participation at trial of a prosecutor who has eavesdropped\r\n  on the accused and his attorney tarnishes us all.â€Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id.\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  in United States v. Kordel, 397\r\n  \r\n        \r\n    U.S.\r\n  1, 12-13\r\n  (1970), the United States Supreme Court rejected the argument that a\r\n  governmentâ€™s inquiry directed against a corporate defendant ought to per se\r\n  immunize a corporationâ€™s directors from subsequent criminal prosecution.Â  Speaking where the issue was parallel\r\n  investigations of a food company by the Food and Drug Administration and the\r\n  United States Attorneyâ€™s office, the court noted that while it is clear that\r\n  the government may not â€œuse evidence against a defendant in a criminal case\r\n  which has been coerced from him,â€ the occurrence of parallel civil and criminal\r\n  investigations does not, absent extraordinary circumstance, violate a\r\n  defendantâ€™s rights to due process.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id.\r\nWe\r\n  hold that both Quattlebaum and Kordel are totally inapplicable to the\r\n  instant case.Â  There has been absolutely\r\n  no showing of any prosecutorial misconduct in this matter, and Appellant has\r\n  not demonstrated that his prosecution is unconstitutional, improper, or that\r\n  the government pursued a civil action or investigation solely to obtain\r\n  evidence for a criminal prosecution.Â  Although\r\n  it is likely that information conveyed in the statement to the securities\r\n  commissionerâ€™s representatives ultimately assisted in the Stateâ€™s criminal\r\n  investigation, there is no evidence that the State contemplated a criminal\r\n  investigation of Appellant at the time of the meeting.[3]Â  It is not impossible for us to envision\r\n  circumstances that might raise concerns when combined with the fact that the\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  South Carolina official\r\n  vested with the power to institute civil investigations in securities matters\r\n  also serves as the Stateâ€™s chief criminal prosecuting officer.Â  But in this case, there is simply no support\r\n  for any analogy or purported similarity between the instant case and Quattlebaum or Kordel.\r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in determining that\r\n  Appellant is not entitled to immunity from prosecution.\r\nII.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Charges\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in charging the jury that criminal securities\r\n  fraud can include conduct exhibiting â€œextreme recklessness,â€ â€œsevere\r\n  recklessness,â€ and â€œextreme indifference.â€Â  More specifically, Appellant argues that a conviction for criminal\r\n  securities fraud requires a finding of scienter, and that the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  charges did not instruct the jury accordingly.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a\r\n  primary matter, Appellant is mistaken in his characterization of the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s charges.Â  In addition to charging\r\n  the jury that it could find that Appellant violated the securities laws if it\r\n  found that Appellant knowingly committed misconduct, the court charged the jury\r\n  that it could convict Appellant if it found that he engaged in conduct â€œwhich\r\n  presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to\r\n  [Appellant] or is so obvious that [Appellant] must have been aware of it.â€[4]Â  Stated differently, the court charged that in\r\n  order to support a conviction, the jury needed to find that Appellant\r\n  intentionally misled investors, or that Appellant knew that there was a danger\r\n  that his conduct would mislead investors.Â Â Â   \r\nThe\r\n  trial courtâ€™s charges accurately characterized the mental state required for a\r\n  criminal conviction for securities fraud in\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  South Carolina.Â  Where a statute does not specify that\r\n  criminal liability is to be imposed based upon graduated levels of intent, we\r\n  are extremely reluctant to draw such distinctions.Â  Furthermore, we believe that predicating\r\n  criminal liability on a stricter standard than this would unnecessarily\r\n  frustrate the purpose of the securities fraud statutes.Â  In S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 35-1-1210 and 35-1-1590 (Supp.\r\n  2004), the Legislature saw fit to criminalize the making of untrue or\r\n  misleading statements in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of securities,\r\n  and we can discern no reasonable basis for weakening this prohibition by not\r\n  imposing criminal liability in the situation where a person makes statements\r\n  that he or she knows presents a danger of misleading individual investors.Â  Prevention of this type of conduct strikes at\r\n  the heart of the intended purpose of the securities laws.[5]\r\nA\r\n  review of the evidence presented at trial is instructive.Â  The record reflects that HomeGold lost over\r\n  $300 million from 1998 until the companies closed.Â  During this same time, the record reflects\r\n  that HomeGoldâ€™s inter-company debt to Carolina Investors grew from about\r\n  $304,000 to over $275 million.Â  At trial,\r\n  the State introduced evidence that Appellant attended board meetings where\r\n  officers discussed HomeGoldâ€™s enormous losses and the tremendously increasing\r\n  inter-company debt.Â  The State introduced\r\n  evidence that Appellant attended meetings where auditors hired by the company discussed\r\n  the grave circumstances caused by the lack of positive cash flow to HomeGold\r\n  and the accompanying likelihood that HomeGold would never repay its debt to\r\n  Carolina Investors.Â  The State introduced\r\n  evidence that Appellant discussed these circumstances with his fellow board\r\n  members, and that Appellant attended meetings where the parties explored the\r\n  issues of bankruptcy or a convervatorship.Â  Finally, the State introduced evidence that despite being fully aware of\r\n  the dire situation of the company, Appellant used his reputation to aggressively\r\n  attract and retain customers for Carolina Investors, and that Appellant was\r\n  financially rewarded based upon his effectiveness in preventing massive\r\n  requests to redeem debentures.\r\nWitness\r\n  at trial testified that when confronted with specific questions regarding\r\n  individual investments and the financial situation of the company, Appellant\r\n  responded â€œI see the numbers and your money is safe,â€ that there was no way\r\n  that anyone was going to lose any money, and that there was a lawsuit against\r\n  another company for putting out false information about Carolina\r\n  Investors.Â  Additional witnesses\r\n  testified that Appellant told customers that Carolina Investors had been â€œsold\r\n  to a company in California,â€ that Carolina Investors was â€œas solid as the floor\r\n  weâ€™re standing on,â€ that the company was â€œas solid as the rock of Gibraltar,â€\r\n  and that â€œmoney here is as good as if it were gold.â€Â  This case was not, as Appellant suggests, an\r\n  example of looking backwards at his conduct through the often distorting lens\r\n  of hindsight.Â  Instead, the theory of the\r\n  Stateâ€™s case revolved around evidence showing what Appellant said to twenty-two\r\n  specific investors versus what Appellant knew to be the financial reality.Â  If the inclusion of the term recklessness,\r\n  despite the trial courtâ€™s detailed definition of the term, could have\r\n  introduced any ambiguity into the juryâ€™s understanding of the law, it had no\r\n  effect on this case.Â  The instant case\r\n  did not deal with reckless conduct.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that the trial court did not err in charging the jury as to the mental\r\n  state required for a criminal conviction of securities fraud.\r\nIII.&nbsp; The\r\n  Stateâ€™s Expert\r\nAt\r\n  trial, the State offered Gregory B. Adams as an expert in corporate and\r\n  securities laws.Â  Appellant argues that\r\n  Adams was not qualified to opine on issues of corporate and securities laws in\r\n  \r\n  South Carolina because Adams is not licensed to practice\r\n  law in\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  South Carolina.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  qualification of a witness as an expert is a matter largely within the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 255, 391 S.E.2d 551, 554 (1990).Â  Generally, defects in the amount and quality\r\n  of an expertâ€™s education or experience go to the weight to be accorded the\r\n  expertâ€™s testimony and not to its admissibility.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id.Â  In\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  South\r\n  \r\n  Carolina, expert\r\n  testimony is admissible where the testimony will assist the trier of fact in\r\n  understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue.Â  Rule 702, SCRE.\r\nDespite\r\n  Appellantâ€™s argument to the contrary, the status of\r\n  \r\n  Adamsâ€™ law license is completely irrelevant to his qualification as an expert. Â The evidentiary rule governing the\r\n  qualifications of experts says nothing about professional licensing\r\n  requirements, and a licensing requirement seems wholly incompatible with Rule\r\n  702â€™s operational framework.Â  At the time\r\n  of trial, Adams had been a law professor at the\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  University of\r\n  \r\n  South\r\n  Carolina for more than twenty-five years, with\r\n  experience teaching corporate and securities law classes.Â  Furthermore, the record reflects that Adams\r\n  served as one of the authors of the 1988 South Carolina Business Corporations\r\n  Act, and that\r\n  \r\n  Adams serves as one of the\r\n  co-authors of the primary practice manual on corporate law used in this\r\n  state.Â  In light of this evidence, the\r\n  trial court clearly did not abuse its discretion in qualifying\r\n  \r\n  Adams as an expert on corporate and securities laws. [6] \r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n  next contends that Adamsâ€™ testimony was contrary to the law of\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  South Carolina and\r\n  should have been excluded.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Adams testified that in certain contexts, statements that are often associated with\r\n  unactionable puffery can constitute fraudulent misstatements in violation of\r\n  the securities laws.Â  Although Appellant\r\n  may be correct that, in general, â€œprojections of future performance not worded\r\n  as guarantees are not actionable under securities laws,â€\r\n      \r\n  Adams\r\n  did not testify to the contrary.Â  Instead,\r\n  \r\n  Adams testified that\r\n  commercial puffery, by definition, excludes statements that are material to\r\n  investors, and that the atmosphere in which a statement is made bears on its\r\n  materiality.Â  Because Appellant does not\r\n  accurately describe\r\n  \r\n  Adamsâ€™ testimony,\r\n  Appellantâ€™s argument is unpersuasive.\r\nAs a\r\n  final point on this issue, Appellant argues that the trial court improperly\r\n  allowed\r\n  \r\n  Adams to opine on the ultimate issue\r\n  in this case, which is whether Appellant engaged in fraudulent conduct.Â  Again, we disagree.\r\nThis\r\n  Courtâ€™s rules provide that â€œ[t]estimony in the form of an opinion . . .\r\n  otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue\r\n  to be decided by the trier of fact.â€Â  Rule 704, SCRE.Â  In this case, the\r\n  State concluded its examination of\r\n  \r\n  Adams by\r\n  presenting a series of hypothetical situations and asking whether certain\r\n  actions in those hypotheticals would be illegal. Â Although this testimony arguably involved the\r\n  ultimate issue in the instant case, this case required the jury to analyze\r\n  facts and circumstances as they existed in a complex business environment, and\r\n  the trial court determined that expert testimony would assist the jury in\r\n  making its determinations.Â  For this\r\n  reason, this case differs substantially from the expert testimony cases upon\r\n  which Appellant relies.[7]\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding the\r\n  qualification of the Stateâ€™s corporate and securities law expert and the\r\n  admission of the expertâ€™s testimony.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Exclusion\r\n  of Appellantâ€™s Ethics Expert\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court improperly excluded the testimony of his expert in\r\n  legal ethics and conflicts of interest.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court, and the courtâ€™s decision will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564\r\n  S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).Â  An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s decision is based upon an error of law\r\n  or upon factual findings that are without evidentiary support. Â State v.\r\n    Irick, 344 S.C. 460, 464, 545 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001).\r\nAt trial, Appellant offered attorney Desa Ballard as an\r\n  expert in legal ethics and conflicts of interest.Â  Through Ballard, Appellant sought to offer\r\n  testimony as to the conflict of interest HomeGoldâ€™s officers and corporate\r\n  attorneys experienced by simultaneously representing Carolina Investors in\r\n  various capacities.[8]Â  Although the trial court qualified Ballard as\r\n  an expert, the court held that her testimony as to conflicts of interest was irrelevant,\r\n  and alternatively, that the testimony would confuse the issues in the case.\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding\r\n  Ballardâ€™s testimony.Â  This Court is concerned\r\n  by the apparent conflict of interest created by the fact that a single law firm\r\n  attempted to provide legal services to two companies whose relationship, given\r\n  the financial characteristics of the situation, was anything but symbiotic; and\r\n  additionally by the fact that a principal of the law firm served as an officer\r\n  on the board of the parent corporation.Â  But assuming, without deciding, that a conflict existed here, Appellant\r\n  cannot demonstrate how any attorneyâ€™s action or inaction caused him to believe\r\n  that it was advisable to mislead investors.Â  Similarly, Appellant points to no evidence indicating that any attorney\r\n  was knowledgeable of his conduct, particularly as to Appellantâ€™s statements to\r\n  individual investors.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that issue of a law firmâ€™s conflict\r\n  of interest was irrelevant and confusing with respect to the issues presented\r\n  in this case.Â   \r\nFor these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err\r\n  in excluding the testimony of Appellantâ€™s expert in legal ethics and conflicts\r\n  of interest.Â   \r\nV.&nbsp; Exclusion\r\n  of the Bankruptcy Examinerâ€™s Report\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court incorrectly excluded the report prepared by the\r\n  bankruptcy examiner in the federal bankruptcy litigation involving Carolina\r\n  Investors and HomeGold from evidence.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Appellant argues that the bankruptcy examinerâ€™s report was admissible under the\r\n  public records and reports exception to this Courtâ€™s general rule excluding\r\n  hearsay evidence.Â  See Rules 802 &amp; 803(8), SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellantâ€™s\r\n  argument regarding the public records or reports exception to the hearsay rule\r\n  is, in our view, misguided.Â  Rule 803(8),\r\n  SCRE, specifically provides that â€œinvestigative notes involving opinions,\r\n  judgments, or conclusions are not admissible.â€Â  An examination of the bankruptcy examinerâ€™s report reveals that the\r\n  report contains a great deal of investigative opinions, legal analysis, and\r\n  potential conclusions.[9]Â  For these reasons, we hold that the trial\r\n  court correctly concluded that the bankruptcy examinerâ€™s report was outside the\r\n  scope of the public records and reports exception.\r\nAppellant\r\n  makes a second argument that the â€œrule of completeness,â€ see Rule 106, SCRE, required the trial court to admit the\r\n  examinerâ€™s report into evidence, but we believe this argument is similarly\r\n  flawed.Â  As the trial court made clear, it\r\n  did not admit the examinerâ€™s report or any part of the examinerâ€™s report into\r\n  evidence. Â Furthermore, the State did not\r\n  offer any testimony, expert or otherwise, that drew from the examinerâ€™s report or\r\n  any part thereof.Â  Because the trial\r\n  court never admitted any portion of the examinerâ€™s report, Appellantâ€™s rule of\r\n  completeness argument is inapposite.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that the trial court did not err in excluding the bankruptcy examinerâ€™s\r\n  report.\r\nVI.&nbsp; Dismissal\r\n  of the Indictment as Defective\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court incorrectly denied his motion to dismiss the\r\n  indictment as defective.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Appellant argues that the conduct set forth in the indictment does not fall\r\n  within the purview of the criminal statutes the State charged him with\r\n  violating because all alleged misstatements regarding Carolina Investorsâ€™\r\n  financial health and business operations were to pre-existing customers and not\r\n  prospective customers.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellant\r\n  takes far too narrow a view of the statuteâ€™s application.Â  Specifically, Appellantâ€™s argument overlooks\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 35-1-20(13)(a) and (b) (Supp. 2004), providing that â€œsaleâ€\r\n  means every contract for the sale of, contract to sell, or contract for the\r\n  disposition of a security or interest in a security for value; and that an\r\n  â€œofferâ€ includes every attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation of an\r\n  offer to buy, a security or interest in a security for value.Â  Because Carolina Investors customers had the\r\n  option of disposing of their debentures prior to maturity, there is no\r\n  reasonable way to view Appellantâ€™s conversations with customers as not relating\r\n  to offers to dispose of securities.Â  In\r\n  fact, the only arguable purpose of Appellantâ€™s statements to customers was to\r\n  prevent the disposition of securities.\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying\r\n  Appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss the indictment as defective.\r\nVII.&nbsp; Appellantâ€™s\r\n  Request for a Continuance\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court incorrectly denied his request for a\r\n  continuance.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a continuance will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  State v. McMillian, 349 S.C.\r\n  17, 21, 561 S.E.2d 602, 604 (2002).Â  In\r\n  support of his argument that the trial court abused its discretion in denying\r\n  his request, Appellant argues that his trial was premature and that had the\r\n  court granted a continuance, Appellant would have been able to demonstrate that\r\n  he was a victim of an intentional campaign of deception by HomeGold executives.\r\n  Appellant asserts that he did not call several potential witnesses who would\r\n  have corroborated his theory of the case because these witnesses had criminal\r\n  trials pending and would have asserted their Fifth Amendment rights.\r\nAppellant\r\n  cannot demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice as a result of being forced\r\n  to proceed to trial rather than being granted a continuance.[10]Â  At trial, Appellant presented a great deal of\r\n  evidence, including his personal testimony, regarding what he alleged to be\r\n  evidence of HomeGoldâ€™s scheme to hide financial data from Carolina Investors\r\n  officials.Â  Furthermore, Appellant\r\n  presented the testimony of several co-workers to corroborate his â€œkept in the\r\n  darkâ€ defense.Â  Importantly, Appellant\r\n  cannot demonstrate that the grant of a continuance would have in any way\r\n  affected the Fifth Amendment considerations he raises in support of his\r\n  argument.Â  In our view, the grant of a\r\n  continuance would have generated no such effect.\r\nAs a\r\n  housekeeping matter on this issue, it is instructive to note that this Courtâ€™s\r\n  evidentiary rules speak to the subject of continuances in the context of\r\n  unavailable witnesses.Â  Rule 7(b),\r\n  SCRCrimP, provides:\r\n\r\n\tNo\r\n  motion for continuance of trial shall be granted on account of the absence of a\r\n  witness without the oath of the party, his counsel, or agent to the following\r\n  effect: the testimony of the witness is material to the support of the action\r\n  or defense of the party moving; the motion is not intended for delay, but is\r\n  made solely because he cannot go safely to trial without such testimony; and\r\n  has made use of due diligence to procure the testimony of the witness or of\r\n  such other circumstances as will satisfy the court that his motion is not\r\n  intended for delay.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Appellant did not\r\n  demonstrate any of the above-described hardships in support of his request for\r\n  a continuance.Â  Furthermore, in light of\r\n  the evidence introduced at trial, any testimony from unavailable witnesses or other\r\n  unavailable evidence would likely have been cumulative.Â  Accordingly, there is no indication that\r\n  Appellant would have been able to make a successful argument for a continuance\r\n  based upon Rule 7(b).\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in denying Appellantâ€™s request for a continuance.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm Appellantâ€™s conviction and sentence.[11]\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  MOORE, WALLER and\r\n    BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J.,\r\n    concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s\r\n  decision to affirm appellantâ€™s convictions and sentences, but write separately\r\n  because I view several of the issues differently than does the majority.Â  I have addressed the issues in the same\r\n  order.  \r\nI agree that appellant was not entitled to immunity because\r\n  he was not compelled to provide the State with self-incriminating\r\n  information.Â  State v. Thrift, 312\r\n  S.C. 282, 440 S.E.2d 341 (1994).Â  I do\r\n  not join that part of the majority opinion which advises investigators to\r\n  impart Miranda warnings where they are not otherwise required\r\nI agree that the jury instruction given in this case did\r\n  not misstate the scienter requirement in a securities fraud prosecution.Â  See State v. Thompkins, 263\r\n  S.C. 472, 211 S.E.2d 549 (1975)(knowingly means actual knowledge, but one can\r\n  not avoid â€œknowingâ€ by shutting oneâ€™s eyes to what would otherwise be\r\n  obvious).Â  Unlike the majority, I would\r\n  not find that a review of the evidence is in order.Â  As I view appellantâ€™s complaint, it is not\r\n  that the charge was not warranted by the evidence, but rather that it misstated\r\n  the scienter requirement.Â  Finally, I\r\n  would not engage in the harmless error analysis undertaken at the conclusion of\r\n  section II of the opinion, as I would find no error in the charge given.[12] \r\n \r\nAs to the testimony of the Stateâ€™s expert, I agree with the\r\n  majority that we should affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the expert was\r\n  qualified.Â  See Smith v.\r\n    Haynesworth, 322 S.C. 433, 472 S.E.2d 612 (1996).\r\nAs to appellantâ€™s contention that the trial court erred in\r\n  not permitting his expert to testify to a law firmâ€™s alleged conflict of\r\n  interest, I would affirm as the proffered testimony was simply not\r\n  relevant.Â  Rule 402, SCRE.\r\nI agree that the Bankruptcy Examinerâ€™s Report was properly\r\n  excluded from evidence.  \r\nI agree that the trial judge did not err in refusing to\r\n  dismiss the indictment, which is couched in the language of the statute. E.g., State v. Means, 367 S.C. 374, 626 S.E.2d 348 (2006) qualified on other grounds Talley v. State, 371 S.C. 535,\r\n  640 S.E.2d 878 (2007).Â  In my view,\r\n  appellantâ€™s contention that the evidence did not show a statutory violation is\r\n  one to be addressed at trial at the directed verdict stage, not a defect\r\n  apparent on the face of the indictment warranting the indictmentâ€™s dismissal.\r\nFinally, I agree with the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm the\r\n  denial of appellantâ€™s continuance request, and to affirm the denial of his\r\n  directed verdict motion.[13]\r\nFor the reasons given above, I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision\r\n  affirming appellantâ€™s convictions and sentences.\r\n\r\n[1] Appellant served in the South Carolina House\r\n  of Representatives from 1951-1955, in the South Carolina Senate from 1955-1970,\r\n  as the Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina from 1971-1975, and as Comptroller\r\n  General from 1976-1999.Â   \r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-20(1) (Supp. 2004) provides\r\n  that the Attorney General of South Carolina serves as the ex officio securities\r\n  commissioner.\r\nIn 2005, the Legislature comprehensively\r\n  amended\r\n  \r\n  South Carolinaâ€™s\r\n  securities laws.Â  See Act No. 110, 2005 S.C. Acts 681 (â€œthe\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  South Carolina Uniform Securities Act of\r\n  2005â€).Â  In doing so, the Legislature\r\n  reorganized a great deal of the statutes at issue here.Â  Though the definitional statute now appears\r\n  in a different code section, see S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-102(28) (Supp. 2006), this reorganization does not appear to\r\n  have substantially altered the relevant statutory language.\r\n[3] The meeting occurred roughly two weeks after\r\n  Carolina Investors closed, and the State Grand Jury indicted Appellant\r\n  approximately nine months later.\r\n[4] This latter portion of the charge\r\n  represents the trial courtâ€™s definition of the term recklessness.\r\n[5] In fact, the statutory scheme expressly forecloses Appellantâ€™s argument.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 35-1-501 cmt. 6 (Supp. 2006) (providing that the\r\n  culpability required to be pled and proven is addressed in the enforcement\r\n  statute); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  35-1-508 cmts. 2, 6 (Supp. 2006) (providing that both the current and former\r\n  versions of the Code impose criminal liability for securities fraud when a\r\n  person acts intentionally in the sense that the person is aware of what he or\r\n  she is doing and that â€œ[p]roof of evil motive or intent to violate the law or\r\n  knowledge that the law was violated is not requiredâ€).\r\n[6] Appellant relies in part on S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  40-22-20 (22) (Supp. 2006) to support his policy-based argument that an expert\r\n  on South Carolina law should be required to be licensed to practice law in this\r\n  state.Â  Although Appellant correctly\r\n  points out that Â§ 40-22-20(22) defines the practice of engineering to include\r\n  offering expert testimony, Appellant overlooks this Courtâ€™s decision in Baggerly v. CSX Transp., Inc., 370 S.C.\r\n  362, 374-75, 635 S.E.2d 97, 103-04 (2006), where this Court declined to interpret\r\n  the practice of engineering statute to preclude the offering of expert\r\n  testimony by a person not licensed as a professional engineer in South\r\n  Carolina.  \r\n[7] In Dawkins\r\n  v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003), this Court held that the\r\n  trial court properly refused to consider an expert affidavit filed in response\r\n  to a summary judgment motion where the affidavit largely contained only legal\r\n  opinions, conclusions, and no factual support.Â  Similarly, in Oâ€™Quinn v. Beach\r\n    Assocs., 272 S.C. 95, 249 S.E.2d 734 (1978), the trial court refused to\r\n  permit an expert to opine on whether an offer of commercial services would\r\n  constitute the offering of investment contracts under federal law.Â  Affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision, this\r\n  Court held that the testimony was offered to establish a conclusion of law\r\n  within the exclusive province of the court, and thus was properly\r\n  excluded.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id.\r\n  at 107, 249 S.E.2d at 740.Â   \r\n[8] The law firm Wyche, Burgess, Freeman, and\r\n  Parham served as HomeGoldâ€™s corporate counsel and also prepared Carolina\r\n  Investorsâ€™ annual prospectus for approval by the securities commissioner.Â  Attorney C. Thomas Wyche served as an officer\r\n  on HomeGoldâ€™s board of directors.Â   \r\n[9] By way of example, the report provides that\r\n  â€œ[m]anagement and its advisors knew that their investor customers would equate\r\n  [Carolina Investors] with a bank,â€ and â€œit is clear that the game plan was to\r\n  knowingly gamble the money of unsophisticated creditors.â€Â  The report also offers numerous conclusions\r\n  beginning with the preface â€œthere is sufficient evidence for a finder of fact\r\n  to conclude.â€Â  Additionally, the examiner\r\n  opines on the applicability of several potential legal defenses, and opines\r\n  specifically that the business judgment rule would not protect the officers and\r\n  directors of Carolina Investors.Â   \r\n[10] The State Grand Jury indicted Appellant in\r\n  January 2004, and Appellantâ€™s trial occurred during November 2004.Â   \r\n[11] As an eighth issue on appeal, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in\r\n  denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision on this issue pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following\r\n  authority: State v. Weston, 367 S.C.\r\n  279, 292-93, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006) (providing that a trial court examines\r\n  a request for a directed verdict based on the existence or nonexistence of\r\n  evidence, and that if there is any direct or substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt, the case must be submitted\r\n  to the jury).\r\n[12]This\r\n  is not to suggest that I would endorse the instruction as a model charge. \r\n \r\n[13] I\r\n  note that the directed verdict is contested not on the basis that the State\r\n  failed to prove in some counts that there was a â€œsaleâ€ of securities as defined\r\n  by the statute, but on the ground that the State failed to prove appellant\r\n  possessed the requisite intent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26419","title":"Linog v.

Â Because we hold that\r\n  no cause of action exists for medical battery in South Carolina, we affirm.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nAfter\r\n  several consultations, Dr. Yampolsky, a periodontist, recommended that\r\n  Appellant receive osseous gum surgery, a highly invasive dental procedure.Â  The\r\n  procedure was scheduled to last approximately four hours and include all four\r\n  quadrants of Appellantâ€™s mouth.Â  Due to her extraordinary fear of dentists,\r\n  Appellant elected to undergo the procedure with intravenous sedation.Â  Dr.\r\n  Bradham, an anesthesiologist, administered a combination of four anesthetic\r\n  agents prior to and during the procedure.Â  However, Dr. Bradhamâ€™s attempt to\r\n  sedate Appellant was not entirely successful, and the record reveals that\r\n  Appellant would turn her head and mumble throughout surgery.Â  As a result, Dr.\r\n  Yampolsky decided to terminate the procedure after three and a half hours and with\r\n  only one quadrant completed.Â   \r\nAppellant\r\n  filed a medical malpractice action against Drs. Yampolsky and Bradham, alleging\r\n  that she suffered a herniated disc during the procedure.Â  Discovery in the\r\n  action proceeded, and in depositions, both doctors testified that during the\r\n  procedure, Appellant continued to intermittently move her head and otherwise\r\n  disrupt the procedure, thereby making the surgery more difficult to complete.Â \r\n  Appellant then amended her complaint to include a cause\r\n  of action for medical battery, contending that the doctorsâ€™ deposition\r\n  testimonies showed that she withdrew her consent during the procedure.  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment as to both causes of action.Â  The\r\n  trial court granted the motion as to the medical malpractice claim based solely\r\n  on the fact that Appellant failed to identify an expert witness who would\r\n  testify to support her claim.Â  Additionally, the trial court granted summary\r\n  judgment as to the medical battery claim.Â  Specifically, the trial court found\r\n  no legal precedent in South Carolina allowing a claim for medical battery based\r\n  on a patientâ€™s withdrawal of consent.Â  The court alternatively held that even\r\n  if South Carolina recognized such a claim, Appellant failed to provide expert\r\n  testimony establishing the relevant standard of care and showing that Appellant\r\n  withdrew her consent.\r\nWe\r\n  certified this case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and Appellant raises the\r\n  following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  trial court err in granting summary judgment regarding Appellantâ€™s medical\r\n  battery claim?\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and\r\n  it is clear that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\r\n  Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist,\r\n  the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence\r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Â Koester\r\n    v. Carolina Rental Ctr., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994).Â  The\r\n  mere fact that a case involves a novel\r\n  issue does not render summary judgment inappropriate.Â  Houck\r\n    v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 366\r\n  S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329 (2005).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that South Carolina should recognize a medical battery claim based on\r\n  revocation of consent and that expert testimony should not necessarily be\r\n  required in proving such claim.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina courts have specifically\r\n  addressed issues involving informed consent in the context of medical care.Â  In Hook v. Rothstein, the court of appeals explicitly held that lack of\r\n  informed consent cases fall under the medical malpractice framework.Â  281 S.C. 541, 553, 316 S.E.2d 690, 698 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding a patient must\r\n  show that, based on expert testimony of the standard of care, the physician provided insufficient information to enable the\r\n  patient to make an intelligent and informed decision).Â  Additionally,\r\n  in Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 312, 566 S.E.2d 529, 534 (2002),\r\n  we held that South Carolina recognizes a medical malpractice claim stemming\r\n  from lack of informed consent.\r\nOn\r\n  the other hand, although not entirely foreign to South Carolina jurisprudence, our\r\n  courts have not explored medical battery as thoroughly. Â In Hook, \r\nthe court of appeals mentioned medical battery and explained â€œthe battery theory \r\nis applicable either where the physician performs a procedure to which the \r\npatient has not consented or where the patient gives permission to perform one \r\ntype of procedure and the physician performs another.â€Â  Hook, 281 S.C. at 558, 316 S.E.2d at 700-01. Â Similarly, in both Harvey\r\n    v. Strickland and Banks v.\r\n      Medical University of South Carolina, we reversed the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment as to the patientsâ€™ medical battery claims and noted that â€œwe have\r\n  recognized that there may be a viable cause of\r\n  action for medical battery as the result of failing to obtain proper consent.â€Â  Harvey, 350 S.C. at 312, 566\r\n  S.E.2d at 534 (citing Banks, 314 S.C. 376, 444 S.E.2d 519 (1994),).Â  \r\n \r\nTurning to the instant case, we must determine whether South Carolina should recognize a separate and independent cause of action for medical\r\n  battery, or whether such theories of liability are more properly analyzed under\r\n  alternative and well-established causes of action.Â   \r\nUnder\r\n  our jurisprudence, an injured patient may bring a medical malpractice claim\r\n  against a physician where the physicianâ€™s negligence in rendering medical care proximately\r\n  causes the patientâ€™s injury.Â  Guffey\r\n    v. Columbia/Colleton Regâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 364\r\n  S.C. 158, 163, 612 S.E.2d 695, 697 (2005).Â  A\r\n  patient alleging medical malpractice must provide evidence, through expert\r\n  testimony, showing (1) the generally recognized and accepted practices and\r\n  procedures that would be followed by average, competent practitioners in the physicianâ€™s\r\n  field of medicine under the same or similar circumstances, and (2) that the physician\r\n  departed from the recognized and generally accepted standards. David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 248, 626 S.E.2d 1,\r\n  4 (2006).\r\n  Â Alternatively,\r\n  it is possible that a patient might sustain an injury as a result of a\r\n  physicianâ€™s intentional acts that are unrelated to medical care.Â  In these\r\n  cases, a patient may bring a civil battery claim against a physician where\r\n  the physician commits an offensive touching outside of the medical scope.Â  Honea v. Prior, 295 S.C. 526, 369 S.E.2d 846 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988) (upholding a jury verdict for assault and battery against a physician who\r\n  sexually assaulted his patient). Â \r\nIn\r\n  light of the availability of a medical malpractice claim or a civil battery\r\n  claim to any patient that is injured by a physician, we believe medical battery\r\n  would constitute an unnecessary and superfluous cause of action.Â  We see little\r\n  need to recognize an additional cause of action related to tortious injuries\r\n  arising out of interactions with medical providers when the tort of medical\r\n  malpractice fully covers all acts performed in relation to medical services and\r\n  when the remaining area of private tort law applies to acts not related to\r\n  medical services.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  limit the holdings of Hook, Harvey, and Banks to the\r\n  extent that they indicate that our State recognizes medical battery and hold\r\n  that no independent cause of action for medical battery exists in South Carolina.Â  We further hold that in order for a patient to pursue a claim\r\n  stemming from a situation involving lack of or revocation of consent, a\r\n  physical touching within the medical context, and a resulting injury, the\r\n  patient must bring this claim under the medical malpractice framework.[1]Â  That is, a patient must show through expert testimony that the\r\n  physician deviated from the relevant standard of care in failing to obtain\r\n  proper consent, unless the subject matter lies within common knowledge. Â See David, 367\r\n  S.C. at 248, 626 S.E.2d at 4 (holding that a\r\n  plaintiff bringing a medical malpractice suit must provide expert testimony\r\n  unless the subject matter lies within the ambit of common knowledge).Â  It\r\n  is important to note that our holding in no way implies that a patient must\r\n  produce expert testimony in a civil battery claim where the touching occurs\r\n  outside of the medical context.Â  We believe courts are certainly able to\r\n  distinguish between a physicianâ€™s professional services\r\n  and acts that fall outside the medical scope.Â  See South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Ins. Joint Underwriting\r\n    Assâ€™n v. Ferry, 291\r\n  S.C. 460, 463, 354 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1987) (holding that the\r\n  scope of professional services does not include all forms of a physicianâ€™s\r\n  conduct simply because he is a physician).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, Appellant clearly sustained her alleged injuries while receiving treatment\r\n  within the medical context, and therefore, the trial court properly analyzed Appellantâ€™s\r\n  claim as a claim for medical malpractice.Â  Accordingly, because Appellant\r\n  failed to produce any expert testimony that Drs.

Goode, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26420\r\nHeard December 6, 2007 - Filed January 22,\r\n  2008\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tWilliam E. Booth III, of West Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tBlaney A.

Oswald, Op. No.\r\n  2005-UP-530 (S.C. Ct. App. filed September 16, 2005).Â  This Court granted certiorari to review the court of\r\n  appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nIn April 1998, Oswald Wholesale Lumber, Inc. (â€œOswald\r\n  Lumberâ€), of which Respondent is the president, purchased a large tract of land\r\n  from Petitionerâ€™s son.Â  In October 1998, Petitioner filed a conversion action\r\n  against Respondent alleging that Respondent refused to allow her to take\r\n  possession of seven automobiles and various pieces of furniture stored on the\r\n  property.Â  Respondent filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Oswald\r\n  Lumber, and not Respondent individually, owned the property.Â  The trial court\r\n  held that because Petitioner could not show that Respondent owned the property,\r\n  there was no evidence that Respondent converted Petitionerâ€™s personal property,\r\n  and Respondent was therefore entitled to summary judgment.Â  The court of\r\n  appeals affirmed, holding that there was no evidence to support Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  allegation that Respondent owned the property and that Petitioner presented no\r\n  admissible evidence that Respondent exercised control over her personal\r\n  property.\r\nThis Court granted\r\n  certiorari, and Petitioner presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  court of appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment\r\n  based on Petitionerâ€™s failure to produce evidence that Respondent owned the\r\n  land on which her personal property was stored?\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of\r\n  Review\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and\r\n  it is clear the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Â Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the\r\n  evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence\r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Â Koester\r\n    v. Carolina Rental Ctr., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994).Â  \r\n \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner argues that\r\n  the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary\r\n  judgment based on ownership of the real property on which Petitionerâ€™s personal\r\n  property is stored.Â  We agree.\r\nConversion is defined as the unauthorized\r\n  assumption in the exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal\r\n  chattels belonging to another to the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.Â  SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301\r\n  S.C. 493, 498, 392 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1990).Â  To establish the tort of conversion, the plaintiff must establish\r\n  either title to or right to the possession of the personal property.Â  Crane v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs., Inc., 313\r\n  S.C. 70, 72, 437 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1993) (superseded by statute on\r\n  other grounds).\r\nIn our view, the\r\n  courts below erred in hinging their decisions on the fact that Oswald Lumber,\r\n  and not Respondent individually, owns the property on which Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  chattels are stored.Â  While ownership of the real property may be relevant, a\r\n  conversion action does not depend on who owns the real property on which the automobiles\r\n  and other items are stored.Â  Rather, the issue in a conversion action is\r\n  whether Respondent exercised unauthorized control over Petitionerâ€™s personal\r\n  property.Â  See SSI Med. Servs., Inc. (holding that an action for conversion may arise by some\r\n  illegal use or misuse, or by illegal detention of anotherâ€™s chattel).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  the record reveals that there are several genuine issues of material fact\r\n  regarding Petitionerâ€™s conversion claim.Â  Specifically, Petitioner produced\r\n  evidence showing that she holds title to the automobiles and owns the\r\n  furniture, and Respondent testified in his deposition that he attempted to sell\r\n  one of the automobiles.Â  Furthermore, there is evidence that Respondent refused\r\n  to allow Petitioner to retrieve the automobiles and furniture from the\r\n  property.Â  Respondent argues that summary judgment is appropriate because a\r\n  careful review of the record shows that Petitionerâ€™s son demanded return of the\r\n  automobiles on behalf of Petitionerâ€™s husband and not on behalf of Petitioner\r\n  and that Petitioner has never specifically demanded the return of the items to\r\n  which she currently is referring.Â  We reject Respondentâ€™s argument.Â  Clearly,\r\n  Respondent is on notice of the items that Petitioner alleges belong to her.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we hold that the trial court erred in granting Respondentâ€™s motion for summary\r\n  judgment.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Alison Renee Lee, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26421","title":"Marquez v.

Armstrong, Family Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26421\r\nHeard November 14, 2007 - Filed January\r\n  22, 2008Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAnita\r\n  Ruth Floyd, of Conway, for appellant-respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tRandall\r\n  K.

Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(33) (Supp. 2006), Grandmother would be\r\n  allowed visitation with both Jason and Katie.Â  Â The court further\r\n  ruled that Grandmother must pay $25,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Stepfatherâ€™s attorney.Â \r\n  Finally, the court ruled that both Grandmother and Stepfather would equally divide the fees of the\r\n  guardians ad litem.Â  We\r\n  certified these appeals from the Court of Appeals.Â  We now affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nStepfather met Amy while she was pregnant with Jason.Â \r\n  He moved in with Amy a few months after Jasonâ€™s birth and they subsequently\r\n  married.Â  They had a rocky relationship and separated three times.Â  Amy filed\r\n  for divorce shortly after Katieâ€™s birth.Â  At that time, there was an agreement\r\n  for custody wherein Katie lived with Stepfather and Jason lived with Amy.Â  They\r\n  reconciled and then separated again in 2003.Â  Stepfather left on Amyâ€™s request\r\n  and filed for divorce and custody of the children.Â  At that time, there was an\r\n  agreement for joint custody.Â  While that order was in effect, Amy committed\r\n  suicide.Â   \r\nGrandmother\r\nGrandmother has a\r\n  history of depression.Â  She married her first husband at age 18 and had Amy and\r\n  another daughter, Jessica, within two years.Â  She had a miscarriage during this\r\n  first marriage.Â  She divorced her first husband and married her second husband\r\n  who adopted Amy and Jessica.Â  She then gave birth to Gina and, later, another\r\n  daughter.Â  Therefore, in six years, she had five pregnancies, four of which\r\n  resulted in live births.Â  After her youngest child was born in 1971, she became\r\n  depressed and attempted suicide.Â  She has periodically taken antidepressants.Â \r\n  She claims she has not been depressed since 1989 until the death of her\r\n  daughter in 2003.\r\nDuring her second\r\n  marriage, Grandmother left her children in Florida in the custody of her\r\n  husband while she attended college and law school in Maryland.Â  For three of\r\n  those years, her children were also in Maryland.Â  She saw and talked to her\r\n  children often while she was in school.Â  After school, all of her children\r\n  moved back in with her.\r\nGrandmother worked\r\n  as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C., and later entered into private practice.Â \r\n  She married twice more, with her last divorce occurring in 1996.Â  In 1999, she\r\n  moved to the state of Washington.Â  While in private practice, she started an\r\n  internet company that failed.Â  She had to file for bankruptcy in 2001 and\r\n  discharged $150,000 in liabilities.\r\nImmediately before\r\n  the family court hearing in 2005, Grandmother bought a single-family home in anticipation\r\n  of gaining custody of Jason.Â  She wanted to be near her family for support and\r\n  chose the home because it was in an excellent school district.Â  Grandmother has\r\n  a net yearly income of $45,600 and testified she could financially take care of\r\n  Jason.\r\nStepfather\r\nStepfather was in\r\n  the Air Force for over eleven years and was honorably discharged due to\r\n  anxiety.Â  He had one suicide attempt; however, he maintains that it was only an\r\n  attempt to attract attention during a divorce.Â  At the time of the hearing,\r\n  Stepfather was taking medication for anxiety.Â  He has previously taken other\r\n  medications and, at times, would carry medicine to assist him in the event he\r\n  had a panic attack.\r\nStepfather\r\n  testified that the only time he did not take his anxiety medicine was when it\r\n  was lost in the mail and he suffered withdrawal.Â  He then remained off the\r\n  medicine for two years because he felt fine.Â  He alleged his doctor was aware\r\n  of his failure to take the medicine.Â   \r\nSeveral years prior\r\n  to meeting Amy, Stepfather had a child of whom he relinquished custody.Â  He has\r\n  maintained contact with this child, who is now an adult.\r\nPrior to his\r\n  separation from Amy in 2003, Stepfather met another woman, Kim Darling, on an\r\n  adult website.Â  Within three or four months after Amyâ€™s suicide, Stepfather\r\n  moved Jason and Katie into his girlfriendâ€™s house.Â  The girlfriend has twin\r\n  boys that also live with them in the five bedroom home.Â  Jason and Katie call\r\n  the girlfriend Kim, although there were allegations Stepfather was attempting\r\n  to have the children call her Mom.Â  Stepfather and Kim have since married.Â  This\r\n  is his fourth marriage.Â  Stepfather testified that he felt it was appropriate\r\n  to move in with Kim because Kim helped Jason by giving him stability.Â  He admitted\r\n  the move could have been a mistake but that it has worked out.\r\nAt the time of the\r\n  hearing, Stepfather was working as a driver for Coca-Cola.Â  His financial\r\n  statement indicates that his net monthly income is $2,952.\r\nJasonJason has\r\n  consistently had behavioral problems.Â  He was first taken to counseling at the\r\n  age of four as a result of being expelled from four daycares in one year.Â  His\r\n  issues included kicking, biting, and hitting.Â  His behavior was allegedly the\r\n  result of his mother and Stepfather arguing in front of him.\r\nJason was admitted to\r\n  counseling again around age six for extreme behavior problems at school.Â  He\r\n  underwent school-based counseling and Jason indicated he had to get between Amy\r\n  and Stepfather when they fought.\r\nJasonâ€™s third admission\r\n  to counseling occurred at seven years of age and continued until 2002 when he\r\n  was about ten years of age.Â  This service was again initiated by Amy.Â  Jason\r\n  was in trouble at school for choking one child and pushing other children.Â \r\n  Jason was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and\r\n  placed on medication.Â  He was discharged from counseling.\r\nJasonâ€™s fourth\r\n  admission to counseling was initiated by Stepfather after Amyâ€™s death.Â  This\r\n  counseling occurred between October 2003 and March 2005.Â  Jason was accused of\r\n  destroying property and acting in a threatening manner toward others.Â  He also\r\n  had suicidal thoughts.Â  From the questionnaire, it appeared Stepfather did not\r\n  know a lot about Jasonâ€™s school life.Â  During the fourth counseling session, the\r\n  Department of Social Services was called by Jasonâ€™s school in March 2004\r\n  because Jason had been wearing the same clothes to school for a week.[2]\r\nIn October 2004, a\r\n  therapist met with Stepfather.Â  The therapist stated Jason had made great\r\n  progress, had less anger, and was taking Strattera for ADHD.Â  At this time,\r\n  Jason was living with Stepfather, Katie, and Kim and her two children. In March\r\n  2005, counseling for Jason ended because he was doing well but also mainly\r\n  because he was resistant to participating in counseling sessions.\r\nAt one point, Jason\r\n  was off his ADHD medication after Christmas 2004.Â  He had twelve incidents at\r\n  school while he was off the medication.\r\nThroughout the\r\n  fourth counseling session, Jason vacillated between wanting to live with\r\n  Grandmother and wanting to live with Stepfather.Â  Jason indicated that he loved\r\n  both of them and wanted to be with both of them and that it was a hard decision\r\n  for him.Â  He indicated that he enjoyed living with Kim and her children.Â  Jason\r\n  refers to Stepfather as â€œDadâ€ and Stepfather is the only father figure Jason\r\n  has ever known.Â  Grandmother admits Stepfather is a fit parent to both Jason\r\n  and Katie and that Jason and Stepfather have emotionally bonded as father and\r\n  son.Â  Amyâ€™s sister and other witnesses testified that the relationship of\r\n  Stepfather and Jason is as father and son and that Stepfather loves both Jason\r\n  and Katie.Â  The Guardians ad litem both testified that Stepfather is a\r\n  fit parent.\r\nStepfather\r\n  testified that he did not earlier seek to adopt Jason because, initially, Amy\r\n  was receiving child support from the biological father and she did not want\r\n  that support to stop.Â  When the support did stop, he testified they simply did\r\n  not discuss it anymore.\r\nA couple of months\r\n  before the hearing, Jason was in trouble at school for choking another child.Â \r\n  He had also indicated he was having suicidal thoughts again.Â  Jasonâ€™s school\r\n  records for 2005 indicated he was making Câ€™s, Dâ€™s, and Fâ€™s, and had 11 disturbing\r\n  school infractions and one physical altercation (the choking incident).Â \r\n  Stepfather testified he would seek more counseling for Jason.[3]Â \r\n  He testified, however, that he was told by the counselor that Jason would have\r\n  to be ready to receive counseling or it would not help him.\r\nThere was evidence that\r\n  Stepfather favored Katie over Jason.Â  One witness testified Stepfather and\r\n  Jasonâ€™s relationship was very reserved and cold on Stepfatherâ€™s part.Â  This\r\n  witness felt Jason attempted to get Stepfatherâ€™s attention.Â  A former co-worker\r\n  of Amy testified that Amy would often bring Jason to the convenience store where\r\n  she worked.Â  Amy indicated she had to bring Jason because she did not have\r\n  anyone to babysit him.Â  This co-worker testified that Katie stayed with her\r\n  paternal grandparents but Jason was not allowed to do so.  \r\nAmyâ€™s sister, Gina,\r\n  testified that when she went to retrieve Amyâ€™s remains for the funeral in Maryland, Jason and Katie were living with their paternal grandparents at the time.Â  None\r\n  of Jasonâ€™s belongings were inside the house because he was living outside in a\r\n  camper.Â  Katie, on the other hand, had a bedroom filled with toys and clothes\r\n  inside her grandparentsâ€™ house.Â  Gina further testified that Stepfather focuses\r\n  all of his attention on Katie and does not engage in any physical contact, such\r\n  as hugging, with Jason.Â  She mentioned that Stepfather told Jason he could not\r\n  cry at his motherâ€™s memorial service that was held in South Carolina.\r\nOn the other hand,\r\n  Stepfather presented two witnesses who stated Stepfather plays video games with\r\n  Jason, that Stepfather appropriately disciplines Jason, and that Stepfather\r\n  mostly took care of the children while Amy was alive.Â  Stepfather did most of\r\n  the cooking and feeding of the children.Â  One of Stepfatherâ€™s witnesses stated he\r\n  treats Katie â€œa little bit betterâ€ than Jason.\r\nGrandmother was\r\n  present at Jasonâ€™s birth and she saw Jason monthly until he was over 2 years\r\n  old.Â  She did not see him in 1995.Â  From 1996 to 1999, Grandmother saw Jason\r\n  about eleven times.Â  She did not see him in 2000.Â  From 2001 to 2003,\r\n  Grandmother allegedly saw Jason three times.[4]Â \r\n  After Amyâ€™s death, she did not see Jason again until September 2004.Â  As of the\r\n  hearing, she had seen Jason for five visits.\r\nKatie\r\nKatie was born in\r\n  1999 and she and Jason are seven years apart; however, they have a good\r\n  relationship.Â  Both Guardians testified that Jason and Katie should not be\r\n  divided.\r\nGrandmother was not\r\n  present at Katieâ€™s birth and saw Katie twice between 2001 and 2003.Â  She did\r\n  not see Katie again until after Amyâ€™s death. Â Grandmother testified that she\r\n  could not visit Katie due to financial restraints.Â  Amyâ€™s sister, Gina,\r\n  testified that she never visited Katie from her birth to Amyâ€™s death.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court,\r\n  the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its view\r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Strickland v. Strickland,&nbsp;375\r\n  S.C. 76, 650 S.E.2d 465 (2007). Â This broad scope\r\n  of review does not require the reviewing court to\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court;\r\n  appellate courts should be mindful that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, sits in a better\r\n  position to evaluate credibility and assign comparative weight to the\r\n  testimony.Â  Id.Â  Because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for\r\n  direct observation of the witnesses, it should accord great deference to trial\r\n  court findings where matters of credibility are involved.Â  Dodge v. Dodge,\r\n  332 S.C. 401, 505 S.E.2d 344 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nGRANDMOTHERâ€™S APPEAL\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tI.&nbsp;Did the family court err by\r\n  failing to award custody of Jason to Grandmother?\r\n\t\tII.&nbsp;Did the family court err by\r\n  awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Stepfather?\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Custody\r\nThe\r\n  family court found that both Grandmother and Stepfather would be fit parents.Â \r\n  The court found that Stepfather has played an important role in rearing Jason\r\n  and that, although he has not been the perfect father, he has been the only\r\n  father figure that Jason has ever known.Â  The court noted that the evidence\r\n  establishes a degree of attachment and psychological bonding as father and son.\r\nThe family court\r\n  found that, while Stepfather has shown poor judgment by living with his fiancÃ©e\r\n  and her two children prior to marriage, visiting pornographic websites, and not\r\n  always taking his medication, there was no evidence that this behavior has had\r\n  any detrimental effect on Jason.Â  The family court found that Stepfather has an\r\n  appropriate home for Jason.\r\nAs to Grandmother,\r\n  the family court found that she is fit to be a parent although she has had\r\n  problems, including depression.Â  The family court noted that Grandmother was\r\n  forced to declare bankruptcy at one point.Â  The court stated it â€œwas struck by\r\n  her cavalier attitude to this financial experience.â€\r\nThe\r\n  family court found that Grandmother did not have a great deal of contact with\r\n  Jason prior to Amyâ€™s death.Â  However, he noted that she and Jason love each\r\n  other and that Jason views her as his grandmother and not as a mother figure.\r\nThe family court\r\n  found that it is in Jasonâ€™s best interest to be in the custody of Stepfather\r\n  due to their relationship.Â  He also noted that he did not believe Jason should\r\n  be separated from Katie given both guardians recommend that the children remain\r\n  together.Â  The family court stated that Jason needs as much stability as\r\n  possible and that Jason would find this by remaining with the only father he\r\n  has ever known and his biological sister.\r\nThe family court\r\n  further found that, because Stepfather has custody of Jason, Stepfatherâ€™s\r\n  adoption of Jason should be approved.Â  The family court ordered the adoption\r\n  although Jasonâ€™s guardian did not advocate the adoption because the guardian\r\n  did not believe Stepfather would foster the relationship between Grandmother\r\n  and Jason.\r\nThe best interest\r\n  of the child is the primary and controlling consideration of the Court in all\r\n  child custody controversies.Â  Moore v. Moore, 300 S.C. 75, 386\r\n  S.E.2d 456 (1989).Â  There is a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best\r\n  interest of any child to be in the custody of its biological parent.Â  Id.Â  However, in this case we do not have a biological parent seeking custody of\r\n  Jason.Â  We have a biological maternal grandmother versus a stepfather who has\r\n  essentially raised Jason since birth.\r\nWe recognized the\r\n  notion of a psychological parent in Moore v. Moore, supra.Â  In Moore, a biological father attempted to regain custody of his child after a\r\n  temporary relinquishment due to hardships from third parties.Â  We stated that\r\n  even though there may exist a psychological parent-child relationship, the mere\r\n  existence of such a bond is an inadequate ground to justify awarding permanent\r\n  custody to the psychological parent.Â  We ruled that the child should be\r\n  returned to the biological father.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals mentioned the psychological parent doctrine in Dodge v. Dodge,\r\n  332 S.C. 401, 505 S.E.2d 344 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The Dodge court found\r\n  that although the subject children had a close and loving relationship with\r\n  their stepfather and grandparents, the level of attachment did not rise to the\r\n  level of a psychological parent-child relationship.Â  The Dodge court\r\n  found the family court should have awarded the biological father full custody.\r\nIn Middleton v.\r\n  Johnson, 369 S.C. 585, 633 S.E.2d 162 (Ct. App. 2006), the Court of Appeals\r\n  noted that, while both Moore and Dodge recognized the existence\r\n  of the psychological parent doctrine, neither case explored how a party\r\n  establishes that he or she is the psychological parent to a child of a fit,\r\n  legal parent.Â  The Court of Appeals fleshed out the meaning of a psychological\r\n  parent.Â  The court reviewed the law in other states and found that some states\r\n  define a psychological parent by breaking down parenthood to its fundamental\r\n  elements.Â  The court noted that in California, for example, a de facto parent is defined as a person who has been found by the court to have assumed,\r\n  on a day-to-day basis, the role of parent, fulfilling both the childâ€™s physical\r\n  and psychological needs for care and affection, and who has assumed that role\r\n  for a substantial period.Â  Middleton, 369 S.C. at 595, 633 S.E.2d at 168\r\n  (citations omitted).Â  The court noted that some states have expanded the\r\n  definition of psychological parent, and that Wisconsin has developed a\r\n  four-prong test for determining whether a person has become a psychological\r\n  parent.Â  Id. at 596-597, 633 S.E.2d at 168 (citations omitted).\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals chose to adopt the four-prong test, stating that this test provides a\r\n  good framework for determining whether a psychological parent-child\r\n  relationship exists and that the test would ensure that a nonparentâ€™s\r\n  eligibility for psychological parent status will be strictly limited.\r\nThe four-prong test\r\n  states that, in order to demonstrate the existence of a psychological\r\n  parent-child relationship, the petitioner must show:\r\n\r\n\t(1)&nbsp;that the biological or adoptive parent[s] consented to, and\r\n  fostered, the petitionerâ€™s formation and establishment of a parent-like\r\n  relationship with the child;\r\n\t(2) that the petitioner and the child lived together in the same\r\n  household;\r\n\t(3) that the petitioner assumed obligations of parenthood by taking\r\n  significant responsibility for the childâ€™s care, education and development,\r\n  including contributing towards the childâ€™s support, without expectation of\r\n  financial compensation; [and] \r\n\t(4)&nbsp;that the petitioner has been in a parental role for a length of\r\n  time sufficient to have established with the child a bonded, dependent\r\n  relationship parental in nature.\r\n\r\nMiddleton, supra (quoting In re Custody of H.S.H.-K., 533 N.W.2d\r\n  419, 435-36 (Wis. 1995)[5]).Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals discussed each prong of the test.\r\nRegarding the first\r\n  prong, the court noted the first factor is critical because it makes the\r\n  biological or adoptive parent a participant in the creation of the\r\n  psychological parentâ€™s relationship with the child.Â  This factor recognizes\r\n  that when a legal parent invites a third party into a childâ€™s life, and that\r\n  invitation alters a childâ€™s life by essentially providing him with another\r\n  parent, the legal parentâ€™s rights to unilaterally sever that relationship are\r\n  necessarily reduced.Â  Id. at 597, 633 S.E.2d at 168-169.\r\nRegarding the\r\n  second prong, the court stated the requirement that the psychological parent\r\n  and the child have lived together further protects the legal parent by\r\n  restricting the class of third parties seeking parental rights.Â  Id. at 598, 633 S.E.2d at 169.\r\nThe court stated\r\n  that the last two prongs are the most important because they ensure both that the psychological parent assumed the responsibilities of\r\n  parenthood and that there exists a parent-child bond between the psychological\r\n  parent and child.Â  The psychological parent must undertake the obligations of\r\n  parenthood by being affirmatively involved in the childâ€™s life.Â  The\r\n  psychological parent must assume caretaking duties and provide emotional\r\n  support for the child.Â  The Court of Appeals stated that these duties, however,\r\n  must be done for reasons other than financial gain, which guarantees that a\r\n  paid babysitter or nanny cannot qualify for psychological parent status.Â  The\r\n  court further noted that when both biological parents are involved in the\r\n  childâ€™s life, a third partyâ€™s relationship with the child could never rise to\r\n  the level of a psychological parent, as there is no parental void in the\r\n  childâ€™s life.Â  Id. at 598, 633 S.E.2d at 169 (citation omitted).\r\nWe find the Court\r\n  of Appealsâ€™ adoption of the four-prong psychological parent test is\r\n  appropriate.Â  It is a reasoned way to analyze situations such as the one\r\n  present in the Middleton case[6] and in the instant case.[7]Â \r\n  It is an appropriate extension of the Moore case.[8]Â \r\n  As the Court of Appeals noted, the test will limit the persons who may seek to\r\n  be considered a psychological parent, but it will assist those who are worthy\r\n  to be called such.\r\nUtilizing the\r\n  four-prong test, we find Stepfather has met the requirements of a psychological\r\n  parent.Â  The first prong is whether Amy, as the biological parent,\r\n  consented to, and fostered, Stepfatherâ€™s formation and establishment of a\r\n  parent-like relationship with Jason.Â  Shortly after Jasonâ€™s birth, Amy and\r\n  Stepfather moved in together and a few months later they married.Â  Amy did not\r\n  want Stepfather to adopt Jason because she would lose the child support she was\r\n  receiving from the biological father.Â  After that support ceased, the issue\r\n  either never arose again as Stepfather testified, or as the maternal family\r\n  suggested, Amy did not wish to have Stepfather adopt Jason.Â  In any event, at\r\n  the time of the final separation, Stepfather and Amy had agreed to joint\r\n  custody of Jason.Â  The evidence supports a finding that Stepfather has met this\r\n  element.\r\nStepfather has met\r\n  the second prong to determine whether he is a psychological parent.Â  He and\r\n  Jason have always lived together in the same household; that is, except for\r\n  times of separation between he and Amy.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  third prong is whether Stepfather has assumed obligations of parenthood by\r\n  taking significant responsibility for Jasonâ€™s care, education and development,\r\n  including contributing towards Jasonâ€™s support, without expectation of\r\n  financial compensation.Â  Since Amyâ€™s death, Stepfather has clearly met this\r\n  prong.Â  However, the evidence was not as clear as to whether he met this prong\r\n  prior to her death.Â  Some testimony indicated Stepfather preferred Katie to\r\n  Jason and spent his time with Katie instead of Jason.Â  The evidence also\r\n  indicated that before her death, Amy was the person who ensured Jason received\r\n  counseling and talked to his counselors.Â  However, other testimony indicated\r\n  Stepfather was the one in charge of both children; that he cooked for and fed\r\n  the children, and that he disciplined the children.Â  There is no indication in\r\n  the evidence regarding financial support; however, given both Stepfather and\r\n  Amy were employed, married, and all living in the same household, one can\r\n  assume that he has provided financial support for Jason throughout his life.Â  After\r\n  reviewing all the evidence, we find Stepfather has also met this prong.Â  \r\n \r\nThe fourth prong\r\n  is whether Stepfather has been in a parental role for a length of time\r\n  sufficient to have established with Jason a bonded, dependent, parental relationship.Â \r\n  The evidence that Stepfather meets this prong is clear.Â  Jason has always\r\n  referred to Stepfather as â€œDad,â€ and Stepfather is the only father figure Jason\r\n  has ever known.Â  Grandmother admitted that Stepfather and Jason have bonded as\r\n  father and son.Â  Therefore,\r\n  Stepfather has met the requirements to be considered a psychological parent to\r\n  Jason.\r\nGrandmother\r\n  cannot meet the test of whether she is a psychological parent because she does\r\n  not meet the prongs stated above.Â  It must be remembered that this is a custody\r\n  action between a stepfather and a grandmother.Â  A biological parent is not\r\n  involved; and therefore, there is no reason to recognize the superior rights of\r\n  a natural parent in this case.Â  Grandmother cannot step into her daughterâ€™s\r\n  place.Â  Although her daughter has died, Grandmother remains a third party\r\n  seeking custody.\r\nWhile\r\n  there was evidence indicating Stepfather is not perfect and sometimes shows bad\r\n  judgment, there is no requirement that a person be perfect in order for custody\r\n  to be granted.Â  Because Stepfather is Jasonâ€™s psychological parent and is, in\r\n  fact, the only father he has ever known, we find the family court appropriately\r\n  determined that it was in Jasonâ€™s best interest for Stepfather to have custody\r\n  of him.[9]\r\nII. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nThe\r\n  family court found that Stepfather prevailed on a majority of the issues in\r\n  this case, i.e. custody and adoption, and that he does not have the\r\n  ability to pay all of the attorneyâ€™s fees he has incurred.Â  On the other hand,\r\n  he found Grandmother, as a practicing attorney, has the ability to earn\r\n  substantial income and has sufficient assets which she can apply towards the\r\n  satisfaction of Stepfatherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nThe court found\r\n  that Stepfatherâ€™s attorney has been practicing law for approximately nineteen\r\n  years and devotes a substantial portion of his practice to domestic litigation\r\n  and that the fees he has charged are reasonable and within the norms of hourly\r\n  rates in Horry County.Â  After a review of the factors in Glasscock v.\r\n    Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991), the court ordered\r\n  Grandmother to pay Stepfather $25,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nThe decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  judge and the award will not be reversed on appeal absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Buckley v. Shealy,&nbsp;370\r\n  S.C. 317, 635 S.E.2d 76&nbsp;(2006).Â  The factors used to determine a\r\n  reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee are:Â  (1) the\r\n    nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to\r\n    the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of\r\n    compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; (6) customary legal fees for\r\n    similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock,&nbsp;supra.Â  While\r\n  â€œcontingency of compensationâ€ is an appropriate factor considered in awarding attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees, the contingency to be considered is whether the party on whose behalf the\r\n  services were rendered will be able to pay the attorneyâ€™s fee if an award is\r\n  not made.Â  Further, the factor â€œbeneficial results obtainedâ€ merely aids in\r\n  determining whether an award is appropriate when considering whether the\r\n  services of a lawyer facilitated a favorable result.Â  Id.\r\nWe find the family\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in requiring Grandmother to pay Stepfatherâ€™s\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family courtâ€™s findings are consistent with an\r\n  application of the Glasscock factors.Â  The family court properly noted\r\n  that Stepfather has prevailed on a majority of the issues and that he does not\r\n  have the ability to pay all of the attorneyâ€™s fees he has incurred.Â  Stepfatherâ€™s\r\n  financial statement showed that almost all of his paycheck is used to pay\r\n  bills.Â  He also testified that without his fatherâ€™s financial help he would\r\n  have been unable to afford the litigation.\r\nThe family court\r\n  properly found that Grandmother, as a practicing attorney, has the ability to\r\n  earn substantial income and has sufficient assets she can apply towards the\r\n  satisfaction of Stepfatherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court stated it had\r\n  reviewed the Glasscock factors and found an award should be made to\r\n  Stepfather.Â  The family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to Stepfather.[10]Â  See Patel v. Patel,&nbsp;359 S.C. 515, 599 S.E.2d 114&nbsp;(2004)\r\n  (an abuse of discretion occurs either when a court is controlled by some error\r\n  of law, or where the order is based upon findings of fact lacking evidentiary\r\n  support).\r\nSTEPFATHERâ€™S APPEAL\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tI.&nbsp;Did the family court err by\r\n  requiring a fit parent to proceed with specific grandparent visitation when the\r\n  statute utilized is unconstitutional or is unconstitutional as applied to\r\n  Stepfather?\r\n\tII. Did the family court err by\r\n  requiring Stepfather to be responsible for the payment of guardian ad litem fees?Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Grandparent Visitation\r\nThe\r\n  family court found that, because the adoption of Jason was approved, it would\r\n  analyze the visitation issue as if Stepfather is the biological father of both\r\n  children.Â  The family court found that, as we ruled in Camburn v. Smith,\r\n  355 S.C. 574, 586 S.E.2d 565 (2003), the grandparent visitation statute could be\r\n  applied constitutionally.Â  The family court found that, due to the particular\r\n  facts of this case, maintaining the ties between the motherâ€™s family and the\r\n  children present compelling and exceptional circumstances to justify ordering\r\n  visitation with Jason and Katie.Â  After reviewing what amount of visitation is\r\n  rationally related to achieve its stated goal of maintaining the motherâ€™s\r\n  memory and what is in the childrenâ€™s best interest, the court specified the\r\n  amount of visitation.Â  Grandmother was allowed two weeks of visitation during the summer\r\n  months and one week during the Christmas holidays.Â  Grandmother was to be\r\n  responsible for arranging all transportation and its related costs.  \r\nStepfather argues\r\n  that the grandparent visitation statute, S.C. Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(A)(33), is either\r\n  unconstitutional on its face, pursuant to Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S.\r\n  57 (2000), or as applied to the instant situation.Â  Section 20-7-420(A)(33)\r\n  provides that the family court has exclusive jurisdiction to:\r\n\r\n\torder periods of visitation for the grandparents of a minor child\r\n  where either or both parents of the minor child is or are deceased, or are\r\n  divorced, or are living separate and apart in different habitats regardless of\r\n  the existence of a court order or agreement, and upon a written finding that\r\n  the visitation rights would be in the best interests of the child and would not\r\n  interfere with the parent/child relationship.Â  In determining whether to order\r\n  visitation for the grandparents, the court shall consider the nature of the\r\n  relationship between the child and his grandparents prior to the filing of the\r\n  petition or complaint.\r\n\r\nWe addressed the\r\n  constitutionality of the grandparent visitation statute in Camburn v. Smith,\r\n  355 S.C. 574, 586 S.E.2d 565 (2003).Â  In Camburn, we stated that it is\r\n  well-settled that parents have a protected liberty interest in the care,\r\n  custody, and control of their children and that this is a fundamental right\r\n  protected by the Due Process Clause.Â  Id. at 579, 586 S.E.2d at 567\r\n  (citing Troxel, supra).Â  We noted that, under Troxel, the\r\n  court must give â€œspecial weightâ€ to a fit parentâ€™s decision regarding\r\n  visitation.Â  Id.Â  A court considering grandparentsâ€™\r\n  visitation over a parentâ€™s objection must allow a presumption that a fit\r\n  parentâ€™s decision is in the childâ€™s best interest:\r\n\r\n\t[S]o long as a parent adequately\r\n      cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no\r\n      reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to\r\n      further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions\r\n      concerning the rearing of that parentâ€™s children.\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  579, 586 S.E.2d at 567-568 (quoting Troxel, supra).Â  Parental\r\n  unfitness must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id. (citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  presumption that a fit parentâ€™s decision is in the best interest of the child\r\n  may be overcome only by showing compelling circumstances, such as significant\r\n  harm to the child, if visitation is not granted.Â  Id.Â  The fact\r\n  that a child may benefit from contact with the grandparent, or that the\r\n  parentâ€™s refusal is simply not reasonable in the courtâ€™s view, does not justify\r\n  government interference in the parental decision. Â Id. Â In Camburn,\r\n  we stated that, in sum, parents and grandparents are not on an equal footing in\r\n  a contest over visitation.Â  Before visitation may\r\n  be awarded over a parentâ€™s objection, one of two evidentiary hurdles must be\r\n  met:Â  the parent must be shown to be unfit by clear and convincing evidence, or\r\n  there must be evidence of compelling circumstances to overcome the presumption\r\n  that the parental decision is in the childâ€™s best interest.Â  Id. at\r\n  579-580, 586 S.E.2d at 568.Â  Accordingly, we have already ruled that the\r\n  grandparent visitation statute is not facially invalid because it can be\r\n  constitutionally applied in the appropriate circumstances.\r\nApplying the\r\n  statute and Camburn to the facts here, there has been no finding that\r\n  Stepfather is unfit; in fact, Grandmotherâ€™s attorneys conceded and the family\r\n  court found that Stepfather is a fit parent.[11]Â  We hold that a biological parentâ€™s death and an attempt to\r\n  maintain ties with that deceased parentâ€™s family may be compelling\r\n  circumstances justifying ordering visitation over a fit parentâ€™s objection.Â  We\r\n  find visitation here is in the childrenâ€™s best interest to further the\r\n  relationship between the children and the motherâ€™s family.Â  We further find the\r\n  visitation ordered by the family court would not excessively interfere in\r\n  Stepfatherâ€™s relationship with the children. Â Therefore, the family court did\r\n  not err by awarding Grandmother visitation.\r\nII. Guardian ad litem Fees\r\nThe\r\n  family court found that both of the guardians ad litem had properly\r\n  performed their services and were entitled to payment of their fees and\r\n  expenses.Â  The court ruled that each party would be equally responsible for the\r\n  balance of the fees owed to the guardians.Â  We find the family court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion by splitting the guardian fees between the parties.Â  SeeÂ  Shirley v. Shirley,&nbsp;342 S.C. 324, 536 S.E.2d 427 (Ct. App. 2000) (an award of guardian ad litem fees lies\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn conclusion, we\r\n  find Stepfather has met the requirements of being a psychological parent and,\r\n  as such, he was properly awarded custody of Jason.Â  We find the family court\r\n  did not err by ordering Grandmother to pay a portion of Stepfatherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and by ordering the parties to share equally the costs of the guardian\r\n  fees.Â  Finally, we find the family court appropriately awarded Grandmother\r\n  visitation of the children. Â Given our disposition of\r\n  the appeals, we find it is unnecessary to address Stepfatherâ€™s Issues V and\r\n  VI.Â  Cf. Whiteside\r\n    v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886\r\n  (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issue\r\n  when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).Â  Accordingly, the decision of\r\n  the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWALLER and\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a\r\n  separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â Â I agree with the majority by and large; however, I would reverse\r\n  the portion of the family courtâ€™s order awarding Stepfather $25,000 in\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees.Â   \r\nThis was an extremely close case, and although\r\n  Stepfather ultimately prevailed on the merits of the custody issue, the family\r\n  court awarded Grandmother significant visitation rights.Â  Grandmother has\r\n  incurred substantial expenses as a result of this litigation and, pursuant to\r\n  the family courtâ€™s order, is now responsible for visitation costs.Â  See E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307\r\n  S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992) (holding that in deciding whether\r\n  to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider the beneficial results\r\n  obtained by counsel, the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee, the respective\r\n  financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s\r\n  standard of living). In my opinion, it is instructive that the family\r\n  court ordered Stepfather and Grandmother to be equally responsible for the\r\n  guardian ad litem fees, and I would hold that the family court should\r\n  have applied this reasoning to the issue of attorneysâ€™ fees.\r\nAccordingly, I would reverse this portion of the\r\n  family courtâ€™s order and hold each party responsible for his and her own\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â   \r\nPLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]Although\r\n  respondent/appellant is the biological father of Katie, we will call him\r\n  Stepfather for purposes of these appeals.Â   \r\n[2]However,\r\n  all other testimony indicates Jason was always well-groomed, well-dressed, and\r\n  healthy.Â  Further, Stepfather testified that the allegations were deemed\r\n  unfounded by DSS.  \r\n[3]Unfortunately,\r\n  at oral argument, counsel indicated that Jason has not received the counseling\r\n  that he needs.  \r\n[4]Although\r\n  Grandmother indicated she saw Jason three times between 1999 and 2004, the\r\n  family court found she did not see Jason from 1999 until after Amyâ€™s death in\r\n  2003.  \r\n[5]Cert.\r\n  denied, Knott v. Holtzman, 516 U.S. 975 (1995).\r\n[6]In Middleton, an ex-boyfriend brought an action seeking visitation of his\r\n  ex-girlfriendâ€™s biological son based on the fact he had played a prominent role\r\n  in the childâ€™s life.Â  The Court of Appeals utilized the four-prong test to find\r\n  that Middleton was the childâ€™s psychological parent and that allowing him\r\n  visitation was in the childâ€™s best interest.\r\n[7]The Middleton court cautioned that its decision does not automatically give\r\n  a psychological parent the right to demand custody in a dispute between\r\n  the legal parent and psychological parent.Â  While Middleton was\r\n  concerned with visitation by a psychological parent, in the instant case, a\r\n  legal parent no longer exists.Â  In this situation, the Middleton analysis applies to a custody determination between an alleged psychological\r\n  parent and a third party.\r\n[8]The Moore line of cases do not apply in the instant case because Jason has\r\n  never lived outside of his stepfatherâ€™s and parentâ€™s home for a substantial\r\n  period of time.Â  The Moore case involves a natural parent versus a third\r\n  party who has had possession of and cared for the child.Â  In the instant case,\r\n  a natural parent is no longer involved and the third party, Grandmother, has\r\n  never possessed Jason and has only had visits with him.  \r\n[9]Regarding the family courtâ€™s decision to grant Stepfatherâ€™s\r\n  request to adopt Jason, the family court did not err by allowing the adoption\r\n  given the analysis above.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1820 (Supp. 2006)\r\n  (any person may adopt his spouseâ€™s child and the requirements for doing so are\r\n  lessened).  \r\n[10]Stepfather\r\n  argues the award was reasonable due to Grandmotherâ€™s dilatory tactics regarding\r\n  discovery.Â  Twice during the hearing, the family court stated that he should\r\n  impose sanctions given how untimely Grandmotherâ€™s responses were.  \r\n[11]Because\r\n  the family court properly allowed Stepfather to adopt Jason, we likewise\r\n  address this issue as if Stepfather is the parent of Jason.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26422","title":"In the Matter of W.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and C. Tex Davis, Jr., both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tKevin\r\n  M. Barth, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an attorney discipline case\r\n  involving an inappropriate sexual relationship between James Hoffmeyer\r\n  (respondent) and a client (Client). Â The Commission on Lawyer Conduct Full\r\n  Panel (Panel) adopted the report of the sub-panel, which recommended a public\r\n  reprimand.\r\nThe\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) appeals and asks for a harsher sanction,\r\n  contending the Panel erred in failing to find other instances of misconduct.Â \r\n  We agree and impose a nine month suspension.Â  In addition, respondent is to be\r\n  charged the costs of this disciplinary proceeding.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent is a\r\n  solo practitioner who mainly practices in the areas of criminal defense and\r\n  insurance defense, along with a small amount of family court work.Â  In\r\n  September 2003, Client retained respondent to represent her in a legal\r\n  separation and child custody action.Â  Client and her husband had been\r\n  negotiating terms without legal representation, and they were close to reaching\r\n  an agreement when Client retained respondent as her counsel. Client, who was\r\n  struggling with an eating disorder and depression, desired a prompt resolution\r\n  of her case because she was concerned her husband would use her health against\r\n  her on the issue of custody.\r\nAfter\r\n  respondent sent Clientâ€™s husband a letter enclosing proposed terms of an\r\n  agreement, Clientâ€™s husband retained counsel to represent him on October 2,\r\n  2003.Â  Respondent and Clientâ€™s husbandâ€™s attorney began exchanging proposals in\r\n  an attempt to finalize the separation agreement.\r\nAround this\r\n  point in time in early October 2003, respondent and Client started having\r\n  frequent telephone conversations and office visits, which were personal in\r\n  nature and unrelated to Clientâ€™s domestic case.Â  The increasing attraction\r\n  between respondent and Client resulted in a physical encounter on or about\r\n  October 10, 2003.Â  Although he admitted he should not have continued to\r\n  represent Client, respondent failed to withdraw as Clientâ€™s attorney after the\r\n  incident and continued to negotiate on her behalf because he believed a speedy\r\n  resolution was in Clientâ€™s best interest.\r\nOn October 14,\r\n  2003, respondent and Client engaged in sexual intercourse at respondentâ€™s\r\n  house.Â  Respondent discussed with Client that he should withdraw as her\r\n  counsel, but she asked him to continue representing her, again citing her\r\n  desire to obtain quickly an agreement in her favor.\r\nRespondent\r\n  continued to negotiate with Clientâ€™s husbandâ€™s counsel.Â  One of the proposed\r\n  provisions of Clientâ€™s settlement agreement was that Client be required to pay\r\n  her husband $3,500 for his share of the equity in the marital home.Â  Respondent\r\n  gave Client $3,500 from his personal funds to enable Client to reach a quick\r\n  resolution with her spouse.Â  Respondent admitted that in addition to concerns\r\n  over Clientâ€™s medical condition, he desired to reach a prompt settlement for\r\n  Client so there would be less of a problem spending time with Client.\r\nIn addition,\r\n  during the early part of October 2003, Clientâ€™s eating disorder worsened, and\r\n  her physicians recommended she be admitted to an in-patient facility in New Orleans, Louisiana.Â  Client was making plans to travel to New Orleans, and respondent\r\n  instructed his secretary to use respondentâ€™s office credit card to purchase a\r\n  plane ticket for Client to travel to the treatment center in New Orleans.Â \r\n  However, no plane ticket was purchased because the credit card had not been\r\n  activated.Â  In addition, respondent gave Client $100.00 in cash for her\r\n  personal use when she arrived in New Orleans.\r\nOn October 15,\r\n  2003, one day before Client was to travel to New Orleans, respondent allowed\r\n  Client to spend the night with him at his home.Â  Late that evening, Clientâ€™s\r\n  husband arrived at respondentâ€™s home and confronted Client and respondent regarding\r\n  their relationship.Â  Clientâ€™s husband took with him a tape recorder and recorded\r\n  the exchange.\r\nAfter the\r\n  confrontation with Clientâ€™s husband on October 15, 2003, respondent told Client\r\n  the next morning that he could not continue as her lawyer.Â  He provided her\r\n  with names of several lawyers who could handle her case and assured Client that\r\n  he would take care of her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Later that day, respondent\r\n  delivered Clientâ€™s file to another attorney, discussed Clientâ€™s case with him,\r\n  and also assured the attorney that respondent would be financially responsible\r\n  for Clientâ€™s legal fees.Â  Eventually, another local attorney agreed to represent\r\n  Client and respondent paid the retainer fee.\r\nOn October 17,\r\n  2003, respondent made a Self-Report to ODC.\r\nClientâ€™s\r\n  attorney negotiated a settlement agreement on behalf of Client, which was\r\n  approved by the family court in January 2004.Â  The agreement reached is very\r\n  similar to the one previously negotiated by respondent, and Client received\r\n  primary custody of the partiesâ€™ minor children.Â  Accordingly, the Panel\r\n  concluded that respondentâ€™s personal relationship with Client did not adversely\r\n  affect her domestic case.\r\nThe Panel did\r\n  find that respondent violated Rule 1.7(b) and Rule 1.16 by failing to withdraw\r\n  from representing Client as soon as it became clear that he and Client had\r\n  developed strong personal feelings for each other.Â  The Panel concluded that ODC failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence the remaining allegations\r\n  of misconduct in the formal charges.[1]Â \r\n  The only sanction recommended by the Panel was a public reprimand.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rule\r\n  1.14\r\nODC objects to\r\n  the Panelâ€™s failure to find that Client was under a disability as defined in\r\n  Rule 1.14, SCRPC, and that respondentâ€™s conduct constituted a violation of Rule\r\n  1.14.Â  We agree.\r\nRule 1.14(a)\r\n  states, â€œWhen a clientâ€™s capacity to make adequately considered decisions in\r\n  connection with a representation is diminished, whether because of minority,\r\n  mental impairment or for some other reason, the lawyer shall, as far as\r\n  reasonably possible, maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with the\r\n  client.â€\r\nWhen Client\r\n  first came to respondentâ€™s office, she was depressed, taking prescription\r\n  medication for anxiety, and showed signs of anorexia.Â  During respondentâ€™s\r\n  representation of Client, Client was hospitalized several times for treatment\r\n  of dehydration and malnutrition due to anorexia.Â  These physical problems,\r\n  coupled with the stress of going through a divorce, enhanced Clientâ€™s vulnerability.Â \r\n  Respondentâ€™s failure to maintain a normal relationship with his vulnerable\r\n  client constitutes a violation of Rule 1.14.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Rule\r\n  1.8\r\nODC argues that\r\n  the Panel erred by not finding a violation of Rule 1.8 because it deemed the\r\n  financial assistance given to Client by respondent was merely a gift.Â  We agree.\r\nRule 1.8(e)\r\n  prohibits a lawyer from providing â€œfinancial assistance to a client in connection\r\n  with pending or contemplated litigation.â€Â  The Panel determined that the $3,500\r\n  payment to aid Client in her divorce negotiations and the $100 cash, given by\r\n  respondent before he withdrew as her attorney, were not prohibited by Rule\r\n  1.8(e) because there was no expectation of repayment.\r\nThese payments,\r\n  whether deemed to be loans or gifts, are prohibited by Rule 1.8(e).Â  Rule\r\n  1.8(e) forbids an attorney from providing financial assistance in connection\r\n  with pending litigation.Â  The rule does not distinguish between loans and\r\n  gifts, and the term â€œfinancial assistanceâ€ is unambiguous and encompasses both\r\n  loans and gifts of money.Â  See In re Strait, 343 S.C. 312, 540\r\n  S.E.2d 460 (2000) (advancing money to client for his electric bill); In re\r\n    Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999) (providing money for mobile\r\n  home payments for client and providing loans to numerous clients); and In re\r\n    Mozingo, 330 S.C. 67, 497 S.E.2d 729 (1998) (furnishing money for a rental\r\n  car to a client).Â  Accordingly, respondent violated Rule 1.8(e) when he\r\n  provided financial assistance to Client while he represented her.\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Continued\r\n  legal representation\r\nODC argues that\r\n  respondent continued his legal representation of Client after he formally\r\n  withdrew and continued a sexual relationship with Client, thereby committing a\r\n  separate violation of Rule 1.7(b) and Rule 1.16. Â We agree.  \r\nThe record\r\n  reflects that after formally withdrawing from the domestic action and while he\r\n  and Client were still involved in a romantic relationship, respondent: a)\r\n  prepared several affidavits in Clientâ€™s domestic case in August 2004; and b)\r\n  prepared and filed a power of attorney for Client in January 2005.Â  Although\r\n  respondent did not continue to officially represent Client in her continuous\r\n  custody disputes with her ex-husband, we find that respondent continued to act\r\n  as Clientâ€™s attorney while they were still physically involved with each other.Â \r\n  Respondentâ€™s preparation of affidavits and a power of attorney on Clientâ€™s\r\n  behalf constitutes separate violations.\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Unfitness\r\n  to practice law/legal profession in disrepute\r\nODC contends\r\n  that respondent acted with an utter lack of judgment and demonstrated an\r\n  unfitness to practice law, which is a ground for sanctions under Rule 7(a)(5),\r\n  Rule 413, RLDE.Â  We agree.\r\nThe record is\r\n  replete with instances where respondent showed questionable judgment which\r\n  demonstrates an unfitness to practice law.\r\nFirst,\r\n  respondentâ€™s behavior during the confrontation with Clientâ€™s husband on the\r\n  night of October 15, 2003, causes us great concern.Â  Respondent belittled\r\n  Clientâ€™s husbandâ€™s actions in regards to the separation and divorce proceedings,\r\n  using information he obtained through his representation of Client.Â Â Â   \r\nAnother incident\r\n  that brings the legal profession into disrepute occurred when respondent and\r\n  Client, in anticipation of the issue arising in Clientâ€™s domestic litigation, drafted\r\n  a synopsis of events involving their relationship up until November 2003.Â  The\r\n  timeline trivializes certain events and makes vulgar references to Clientâ€™s private\r\n  affairs.Â  Respondent testified that the document was a result of two people\r\n  being â€œsilly,â€ but we believe the situation involving respondent and Client is\r\n  far from humorous and shows questionable judgment.\r\nAnother incident\r\n  involves an encounter between Client, respondent, and an acquaintance of\r\n  respondent named Gigi.Â  In December 2003, respondent came home to find Client\r\n  had intentionally cut her wrist with a knife, leaving a large gash.Â  Gigi was\r\n  also present at the home.Â  Although there are conflicting details of the events\r\n  of that night, a struggle ensued amongst all three, resulting in Gigi leaving\r\n  respondentâ€™s home with a broken nose.Â   \r\nAfter Gigi left\r\n  the home, respondent expressed concerned over Clientâ€™s wrist wound and\r\n  acknowledged the need for medical attention.Â  However, Client did not want this\r\n  incident to be used against her in future custody disputes, so she and\r\n  respondent avoided professional medical attention.Â  Instead of going to a\r\n  doctor, respondent sewed up Clientâ€™s wound with seven to eight stitches while\r\n  Client, a nurse, directed him.\r\nLater, Gigi\r\n  contacted respondent and informed him that she was holding him responsible for\r\n  her injuries.Â  Respondent drafted a document, styled as a â€œComplete and Full\r\n  Releaseâ€, which was typed by Client and provided a payment of $19,000 by\r\n  respondent to Gigi.Â  The document provided that Gigi would hold respondent\r\n  harmless from any liability, but it did not provide that protection to Client,\r\n  even though Client may have been responsible for the injuries.Â  Respondent also\r\n  failed to inform Client that she should seek independent legal advice in this\r\n  regard.\r\nFinally,\r\n  respondentâ€™s judgment is called into question for not only failing to inform\r\n  the family court of Clientâ€™s problems with substance abuse, eating disorders,\r\n  and other self-destructive behavior, but also for affirmatively supporting\r\n  Client in her custody dispute in August 2004 when he knew of her problems.Â  By\r\n  filing an affidavit in support of Client, respondent let his personal feelings\r\n  for Client get in the way of his responsibilities as an attorney and officer of\r\n  the court.Â  His decision to get involved in a legal matter to support Clientâ€™s\r\n  bid for custody of two small children despite her numerous problems demonstrates\r\n  that respondentâ€™s professional judgment was seriously hampered by his personal\r\n  feelings for Client.Â   \r\nAggravating and\r\n  mitigating circumstances\r\nThe Panel did\r\n  not make any findings of aggravating circumstances, but we believe the\r\n  vulnerability of Client should be considered.Â  Despite their mutual attraction,\r\n  respondent still should have recognized the vulnerability of Client.Â  She was\r\n  under the stress of pending divorce, had just ended a recent affair, and was\r\n  struggling with anxiety, depression, and anorexia.\r\nThe Panel found\r\n  numerous mitigating circumstances.Â  These included the fact that respondent had\r\n  no prior disciplinary action and self-reported, as well as the following\r\n  evidence that respondent: participated in local mock trials at schools, spoke\r\n  at career day, accepted numerous court appointments, participated in numerous\r\n  legal seminars, prepared wills for soldiers leaving for Iraq, was involved in\r\n  the Big Brother program, and donated and participated in over 16 charities and\r\n  local fundraisers.Â  Also, respondent offered evidence from 21 character\r\n  witnesses, who spoke in high regard of respondentâ€™s skills, diligence,\r\n  community service, and professionalism.Â  We also note that all of respondentâ€™s\r\n  disciplinary problems have arisen out of his relationship with Client, and\r\n  although the violations are quite serious, we do not feel that respondentâ€™s\r\n  behavior constitutes a continuing danger to the public.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe purpose of\r\n  disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public and the integrity of the\r\n  legal system.Â  In re Chastain, 340 S.C. 356, 532 S.E.2d 264 (2000).Â  In\r\n  light of our findings of additional instances of misconduct, we suspend\r\n  respondent from the practice of law for nine months.Â  In addition, within ninety\r\n  (90) days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall pay costs associated\r\n  with this proceeding.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the filing of this opinion,\r\n  respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has\r\n  complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We agree with the Panel that ODC did not prove by\r\n  clear and convincing evidence the allegations of misconduct regarding: (1)\r\n  respondentâ€™s allegedly false statements given to ODC; (2) respondentâ€™s alleged\r\n  settlement negotiations with Clientâ€™s husband during their confrontation; (3)\r\n  the manner in which respondent retained counsel for Client after he withdrew;\r\n  and (4) respondentâ€™s alleged attempt to obstruct justice by â€œcoachingâ€ Client\r\n  before her statements to ODC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial

Â \r\nBoth\r\n  parties eventually participated in a hearing before Judge Clyde N. Davis on June\r\n  29, 2006.Â  After the hearing, Judge Davis reversed and remanded the matter to\r\n  the magistrate court for trial.Â  Specifically, Judge Davis held the magistrate:Â \r\n  (1) erred in dismissing the case because Stoner was an arresting officer and\r\n  could have prosecuted the case; (2) erred in dismissing the case or directing a\r\n  verdict prior to the swearing of the jury or presentation of evidence; and (3)\r\n  could have granted a continuance to Stoner, despite his failure to use the word\r\n  â€œcontinuance,â€ because it was obvious what Stoner was requesting and having a\r\n  supervisor there would allow the case to proceed.Â  Rainwater appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRainwater\r\n  argues that the rule allowing police officers to prosecute magistrate level\r\n  cases should be narrowly construed to mean that an officer of one agency may\r\n  not assist another agency in the prosecution of the case.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nThree cases deal with the practice of officers prosecuting\r\n  magistrate level cases.Â  In State v. Messervy, 258 S.C. 110, 187 S.E.2d\r\n  524 (1972), this Court noted the impracticability of having prosecuting\r\n  attorneys present the Stateâ€™s case in the voluminous number of traffic court\r\n  cases, and it upheld the common law practice of allowing arresting officers to\r\n  act as prosecutors at the summary court level.Â  Messervy, 258 S.C. at\r\n  113, 187 S.E.2d at 525.Â  The Court noted that the officerâ€™s actions would be\r\n  subject to the magistrateâ€™s scrutiny to ensure proper conduct.Â  Id.Â  In State ex rel McLeod v. Seaborn, 270 S.C. 696, 244 S.E.2d 317 (1978),\r\n  the Court held the â€œprosecution of misdemeanor traffic violations in the magistratesâ€™\r\n  courts by either the arresting officer or a supervisory officer assisting the arresting\r\n  officer does not constitute the unlawful practice of law. . . .â€Â  Seaborn,\r\n  270 S.C. at 699, 244 S.E.2d at 319.Â   \r\nMore\r\n  recently, this Court declined to extend the holdings in Messervy and Seaborn.Â \r\n  In State v. Sossamon, 298 S.C. 72, 378 S.E.2d 259 (1989), a State\r\n  Highway Patrol trooper appeared at the scene where county sheriffâ€™s deputies\r\n  were arresting the Sossamons for D.U.I. and violating the open container law.Â \r\n  The trooper prosecuted the case, and this Court reversed the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  affirmance of the conviction.Â  Noting that it is practical to allow an\r\n  arresting officer to prosecute magistrate level traffic offenses and to allow a\r\n  supervisor to assist arresting officers, the Court found it was error to allow\r\n  the trooper to prosecute the case because he was neither the arresting officer\r\n  nor the supervisor of the arresting officers.Â  The Court limited the practice\r\n  of allowing an officer to act as a prosecutor to the arresting officer and his\r\n  supervisor.Â  Sossamon, 298 S.C. at 73, 378 S.E.2d at 260.Â   \r\nThe Sossamon court did not distinguish between the agencies, but it focused on the fact that\r\n  the trooper prosecuting the case was neither an arresting officer nor a\r\n  supervisor of the arresting officer.Â  By contrast, Deputy Stoner was the arresting\r\n  officer and the person able to testify regarding the events surrounding the\r\n  arrest.Â  Regardless of Deputy Stonerâ€™s decision to change law enforcement\r\n  agencies, we find it was appropriate for him to prosecute the matter.Â  Thus, we\r\n  find the circuit court correctly interpreted Sossamon as allowing Deputy\r\n  Stoner to prosecute the D.U.I.Â  Further, because Deputy Stoner was qualified to\r\n  prosecute the D.U.I. case, and the magistrateâ€™s decision to dismiss the matter\r\n  caught the State by surprise, it was an abuse of discretion for the magistrate\r\n  to deny Stonerâ€™s obvious request for a continuance in order to obtain an\r\n  alternate person to prosecute. Â See Morris v. State, 371 S.C.\r\n  278, 283, 639 S.E.2d 53, 56 (2006) (noting that although the reversal of the\r\n  denial of a continuance is rare, it was clearly an abuse of discretion to deny\r\n  the continuance because it resulted in prejudice to the appellant).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find the circuit court was correct in its decision to reverse the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s grant of relief and remand the matter to the magistrate for\r\n  trial.Â   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  Rainwater asserts the magistrate actually just dismissed the case, and there is\r\n  evidence at trial that Rainwater believed the case was dismissed.Â  However, the\r\n  oral pronouncement and the written return both state that the magistrate was granting\r\n  a directed verdict.Â  It would be improper for the\r\n  magistrate to grant a â€œdirected verdictâ€ based on the insufficiency of the\r\n  evidence when no evidence had yet been presented.Â  Accordingly, we interpret\r\n  the magistrateâ€™s order as one of dismissal.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26424","title":"State v.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26424\r\nHeard September 18, 2007 - Filed January\r\n  28, 2008Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tChief\r\n  Appellate Defender Joseph L. Savitz, III, and Appellate Defender Kathrine H.\r\n  Hudgins, both of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of\r\n  Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  GeneralÂ  Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh,\r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia, and John\r\n  Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Appellant was convicted\r\n  of murder, assault with intent to kill, resisting arrest with a deadly weapon,\r\n  and grand larceny.Â  He received a death sentence for murder, the jury finding\r\n  two statutory aggravating factors[1] and concurrent ten year sentences on the remaining three charges.Â  On appeal,\r\n  he contends[2] the trial court erred in refusing appellantâ€™s request that the jury be charged\r\n  voluntary manslaughter as a lesser offense of murder.Â  We agree, reverse\r\n  appellantâ€™s murder conviction and death sentence, and remand for further proceedings.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether\r\n  the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, entitled him to\r\n  a charge on voluntary manslaughter?\r\n\r\nFACTS/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œVoluntary\r\n  manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in sudden heat of passion\r\n  upon sufficient legal provocation.â€Â  State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 525\r\n  S.E.2d 511 (2000).Â  In determining whether voluntary manslaughter should be\r\n  charged as a lesser offense of murder, the court must view the evidence in the\r\n  light most favorable to the defendant.Â  The charge need not be given â€œwhere it\r\n  clearly appears that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the\r\n  crime from murder to manslaughter.â€Â  State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 144 (2007) (internal citation omitted).Â  We therefore review the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to appellant, mindful that the charge\r\n  request is properly rejected only where â€œthere is no evidence whatsoeverâ€ of\r\n  the lesser offense.\r\nShortly after\r\n  midnight on December 29, two automobiles pulled into a Dunkin Donuts parking\r\n  lot in Myrtle Beach.Â  Fred Halcomb was driving one car, which contained a\r\n  single passenger, his girlfriend Dianne.Â  Donnie Morgan was driving the second\r\n  car; in the front passengerâ€™s seat was Donnieâ€™s fiancÃ©e, sitting behind her was\r\n  appellant, and beside him in the back seat his girlfriend, Amber Counts.Â  At\r\n  the store, appellant, Fred, and Dianne went in while Donnie, Amber, and\r\n  Donnieâ€™s fiancÃ©e stayed in Donnieâ€™s car.Â  While appellant and his friends were\r\n  in the store, two police cars pulled into the lot, and the two officers entered\r\n  the Dunkin Donuts.Â  The officer/victim was in an excited state of mind, his\r\n  girlfriend having just accepted his marriage proposal.Â  As the officers\r\n  entered, appellant and his friends were talking with their acquaintance who\r\n  worked at the shop.Â  A Dunkin Donuts patron described appellant as loud but not\r\n  obnoxious, and testified the â€œguy behind the counter,â€ appellant, Fred, and\r\n  Dianne were laughing a lot, but not being annoying.\r\nWhen the officers\r\n  came in the store they did not get in line to make a purchase but rather,\r\n  according to the patron, â€œstood side by side in the entrance.â€Â  When Fred,\r\n  Dianne, and appellant left the Dunkin Donuts carrying coffee, the officers\r\n  followed them because, the surviving officer testified, the victim wanted to\r\n  ask appellant some questions.Â  Appellant followed Fred and Dianne to their car,\r\n  where he received a cup of coffee which he then took towards Donnieâ€™s car to\r\n  give to Amber.Â  As he walked between the cars, the victim asked appellant for\r\n  identification.Â  The other officer, who had gone to talk to Fred, observed this\r\n  exchange and testified that the victim and appellant â€œwere just engaged in a\r\n  regular conversation.Â  It seemed real laid back.â€Â  According to this officer,\r\n  appellant appeared friendly, not upset or agitated.Â  The victim then â€œcalled\r\n  inâ€ appellantâ€™s identifying information, and learned there were no warrants\r\n  outstanding for appellantâ€™s arrest.  \r\nAmber\r\n  testified she then observed appellant raise his hands, at which point the\r\n  victim pulled out his gun.Â  The victim, gun pulled, followed appellant to the\r\n  back of the car where, Amber testified, she heard what sounded like hands being\r\n  placed on the back of the car, followed by a single gun shot.Â  Other shots\r\n  followed.Â  Dianne observed much the same scene, but testified the victim was\r\n  yelling â€œfreezeâ€ as he pulled his gun on appellant.Â  Appellant then raised his\r\n  hands.Â  According to Dianne, the officer then holstered his gun and followed\r\n  appellant around the back of the car, grabbing appellant and getting â€œon his\r\n  back.â€Â  Dianne clarified that the victim jumped on appellantâ€™s back, and a\r\n  struggle ensued.Â  At this point, according to Dianne and the other officer,\r\n  appellant shot the victim in the face with a gun appellant had on his person.Â \r\n  The other officer on the scene testified that at the juncture when the victim\r\n  grabbed appellant from behind by the wrist and neck/shoulder area, appellant\r\n  was not under arrest but remained â€œfree to leave.â€Â  He also testified that he\r\n  heard the victim saying to appellant â€œShow me your handsâ€ as he followed\r\n  appellant towards the back of the car, but not all witnesses testified that\r\n  they heard this command.\r\nAfter the victim\r\n  was shot in the face at close range, the other officer and appellant exchanged\r\n  gunfire before appellant and Amber drove off in Donnieâ€™s car. Â Donnie and his\r\n  fiancÃ©e had escaped from the car when appellant jumped in after the shooting\r\n  began, and Amber had moved to the driverâ€™s seat.  \r\nThe\r\n  victim died from a combination of blood loss and a concussive injury to the\r\n  spinal cord which the pathologist testified â€œcould certainly cause immediate\r\n  incapacitation.â€Â  When appellant was arrested in Donnieâ€™s car later that night,\r\n  he was found to have been shot as well.Â  The victimâ€™s gun was recovered at the\r\n  scene, as was a cartridge from a bullet fired from that gun.Â  Based on the\r\n  pathologistâ€™s testimony that the bullet which killed the victim may have\r\n  rendered him instantly incapacitated, appellant contends that the jury could have\r\n  concluded that the victim was the first to fire his gun since, had appellant\r\n  shot him first, the victim would have lost the ability to operate his weapon.Â \r\n  At least two eyewitnesses, however, reported seeing appellant shoot first.\r\nAppellantâ€™s request\r\n  for a charge on voluntary manslaughter was predicated on this Courtâ€™s decision\r\n  in State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981), which held in\r\n  part â€œThe killing [of a law enforcement officer] may be only manslaughter where\r\n  a legal arrest is attempted in an unlawful manner, as when the passion of the\r\n  accused is aroused by employment of unnecessary violence.â€Â  All parties agreed\r\n  that the victim had the right to question appellant, and to ask for his\r\n  license.Â  All agreed, as well, that appellant had the right to refuse these\r\n  requests, a right which he did not exercise until after answering questions,\r\n  showing his identification, and raising his hands.Â   \r\nThe parties\r\n  and the judge disagree whether, after raising his hands as instructed by the\r\n  officer, appellant had the right to walk away as he did, or whether, as the\r\n  trial court ruled, at that point one must necessarily infer that the officer\r\n  saw appellantâ€™s gun tucked in his pants, and that this observation elevated the\r\n  officerâ€™s right to conduct a Terry stop into a basis for appellantâ€™s\r\n  arrest.Â  The defense argued there was no evidence from which a jury could infer\r\n  the officer had seen a gun, that is, the officer never said he saw a gun on\r\n  appellant, nor was there evidence that when appellant raised his arms, that the\r\n  waist of his pants (and the gun presumably tucked in it) was visible.Â \r\n  Appellant contended the court erred in assuming a fact not in evidence in order\r\n  to hold that the victim had probable cause to arrest appellant as he turned and\r\n  walked away.Â  Ultimately, the judge denied the voluntary manslaughter charge\r\n  based on Linderâ€™s holding that a â€œlawful arrest or detentionâ€ in a\r\n  â€œlawful mannerâ€ cannot constitute sufficient legal provocation.Â  He ruled that,\r\n  as a matter of law, the victim acted in a lawful manner in attempting to\r\n  effectuate the lawful arrest of appellant, whom it must be assumed the victim\r\n  knew to be armed.  \r\nAppellant contends\r\n  the trial court erred, and we agree.Â  It is certainly permissible to infer, as\r\n  did the trial judge, that the victim acted as he did because he observed a gun\r\n  in appellantâ€™s possession.Â  On the other hand, as the defense argues, an\r\n  alternative and reasonable inference was that the victim reacted in an\r\n  impermissibly aggressive manner, physically assaulting and then shootingÂ \r\n  appellant when he exercised his constitutional right to walk away.Â  Unlike the\r\n  trial judge, we do not find the evidence is susceptible of only one inference,\r\n  and we hold he erred by holding that, as a matter of law, the victim was effectuating\r\n  a lawful arrest in a lawful manner when he tackled appellant from behind.[3] The evidence in this case presented a jury\r\n  question whether the arrest was lawful but effectuated through the victimâ€™s\r\n  unnecessary use of violence, thereby entitling appellant to a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge under Lindler.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSince the evidence,\r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, warranted a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge, appellantâ€™s murder conviction and his death sentence are\r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER\r\n  AND BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would affirm Appellantâ€™s\r\n  conviction and hold that there is no evidence supporting a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge.Â   \r\nVoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in the sudden heat of\r\n  passion upon a sufficient legal provocation.Â  State v. Childers, 373 S.C. 367, 373, 645 S.E.2d\r\n  233, 236 (2007).Â  In cases involving the killing of a police\r\n  officer, the general rule is:\r\n\r\n\tA lawful arrest or detention in a lawful manner by an officer . .\r\n  . will not constitute an adequate provocation for heat of passion reducing the\r\n  grade of the homicide to manslaughter; nor will other lawful acts of officers\r\n  while in the discharge of their duties constitute adequate provocation . . . The killing [of a\r\n  police officer] may be only manslaughter where a legal arrest is attempted in\r\n  an unlawful manner, as when the passion of the accused is aroused by the\r\n  employment of unnecessary violence.\r\n\r\nState v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 308, 278 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1981)\r\n  (quoting 40\r\n  C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 116 (2007)). Â However,\r\n  â€œ[w]here there are no actions by the deceased to constitute legal provocation,\r\n  a charge on voluntary manslaughter is not required.â€Â  State v. Wood, 362\r\n  S.C. 135, 142, 607 S.E.2d 57, 60 (2004).\r\nIn my view, the majority errs in holding that the record\r\n  contained evidence of sufficient legal provocation entitling Appellant to a\r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  Specifically, I would hold that the trial court correctly ruled that there was no\r\n  evidence that the police officer shot Appellant first. Â While the pathologist\r\n  speculated that the bullet may have rendered the police officer\r\n  instantly incapacitated, the record reveals that the only evidence from the\r\n  witnesses was that Appellant fired the first shot.Â  Moreover, although Amber\r\n  testified that she saw the police officer draw his gun and follow Appellant\r\n  behind the car, she explicitly stated that she could not see if Appellant\r\n  pulled a gun or who fired the first shot.[4]Â \r\n  Accordingly, I would hold that there was no evidence of sufficient legal\r\n  provocation, and therefore, Appellant was not entitled to a voluntary\r\n  manslaughter charge.  \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, I would hold the trial court properly refused Appellantâ€™s\r\n  request for a voluntary manslaughter charge.  \r\n\r\n[1] (1) Knowingly creating a great risk of death to more than one person and (2)\r\n  murdering a police officer during the performance of his official duties.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(c)(3) and (7) (2003 and Supp. 2006).\r\n[2] Appellantâ€™s second argument, which he conceded at oral argument is irrelevant\r\n  to the merits of his appeal, is affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and State v.

Orderâ€).\r\nOn August 4, 2006, Birthmother filed a petition in Illinois circuit court to vacate her consent to adoption and have the baby returned to\r\n  her.Â  She alleged in an affidavit that she and Birthfather began dating in\r\n  January 2005 and were living together by September 2005.Â  In mid-October 2005,\r\n  she filed assault charges against Birthfather, and he was arrested.Â \r\n  Birthmother found out she was pregnant and contacted an adoption agency, which\r\n  put her in contact with appellants.Â  Thereafter, attorney Patton contacted her\r\n  to assist with the adoption and told Birthmother that appellants would be\r\n  paying Pattonâ€™s costs.Â   \r\nAccording to Birthmother, she signed the consent to adoption one\r\n  hour before 72 hours had elapsed from birth.[2]Â \r\n  She further stated that Patton told her if she did not list Birthfatherâ€™s name\r\n  on the adoption papers, then he would not need to be notified.Â  Finally, she\r\n  alleged Patton had a conflict of interest representing her.Â   \r\nOn September 8, 2006, the Illinois circuit court vacated ab\r\n  initio the June Illinois Order which appointed Patton temporary guardian of\r\n  Baby Girl. The Illinois court found that Birthmother intentionally failed to\r\n  disclose Birthfatherâ€™s identity and the failure to give notice to Birthfather\r\n  â€œdeprived the [Illinois] Court of the jurisdiction to have granted the\r\n  guardianship.â€Â  Additionally, the Illinois court ordered the return of Baby\r\n  Girl to Birthmother in Illinois.Â  Appellants were not named as parties\r\n  to this Illinois matter and were not referenced in the written order.[3]Â  (â€œSeptember Illinois Orderâ€).\r\nThereafter, Birthfather filed a motion in South Carolina family court to vacate the August S.C. Order which awarded appellants temporary\r\n  custody of Baby Girl.Â  A hearing was held in family court before Judge Jones on\r\n  October 20, 2006.Â  On December 15, 2006, Judge Jones issued an order which\r\n  found that Illinois â€œfirst exercised jurisdictionâ€ over Baby Girl at the June\r\n  19th proceedings and â€œexercised continuing jurisdictionâ€ by vacating\r\n  the June Illinois Order.Â  The family court further noted that a telephone\r\n  conference was held with the presiding Illinois judge and â€œa determination was\r\n  made that the State of Illinois is the â€˜home stateâ€™â€ of Baby Girl pursuant to South Carolinaâ€™s UCCJA. Â The order further stated that under the ICPC, S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-1980(5)(a) provides for a retention of jurisdiction.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  family court granted Birthfatherâ€™s motion to dismiss based on a lack of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction.Â  (â€œDecember S.C. Orderâ€).Â   \r\nMeanwhile,\r\n  Birthmother had filed a custody action in South Carolina family court on\r\n  December 7, 2006, that essentially asked the South Carolina court to enforce\r\n  the September Illinois Order which awarded Birthmother custody of Baby Girl.Â \r\n  Birthmother did not name Birthfather as a party in this action.Â  Appellants\r\n  answered and filed a counterclaim and a cross-claim, naming Birthfather as a\r\n  party.Â  After a hearing, Judge Jones issued an order on February 13, 2007, which:\r\n  Â (1) granted Birthmotherâ€™s request to enforce the September Illinois Order; and\r\n  (2) dismissed appellantsâ€™ counterclaim and cross-claim.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  family court commanded appellants to deliver Baby Girl to Birthmotherâ€™s counsel\r\n  no later than February 23, 2007, â€œunless the Illinois court says otherwise.â€Â  (â€œFebruary\r\n  S.C. Orderâ€).Â Â Â   \r\nAppellants\r\n  appealed both orders and petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of supersedeas to leave in force the August S.C. Order which granted appellants\r\n  temporary custody of Baby Girl.Â  Those petitions were denied.Â  It appears from\r\n  the record that on February 23, 2007, appellants surrendered custody Baby Girl,\r\n  who was then over eight months old.Â   \r\nAdditional\r\n  Procedural History\r\nApproximately\r\n  one month before the scheduled oral argument in this case, Birthfatherâ€™s South Carolina counsel requested to be relieved.Â  Birthfather joined in the request, and\r\n  both filed affidavits with this Court.Â  Counsel stated she believed she had\r\n  just cause to make the request because, inter alia, Birthfather had\r\n  failed to pay her as agreed.Â  Birthfather stated in his affidavit that he knew\r\n  of the hearing scheduled for November 15, 2007.Â  He then stated as follows:Â  â€œI\r\n  understand that if I do not hire replacement counsel, the Court may presume\r\n  that it is my intention to forfeit my rights in this matter.â€Â  The Court\r\n  granted the motion to be relieved.Â  Birthfather did not retain replacement\r\n  counsel and did not appear pro se at the oral argument.Â   \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court \r\n\t\t\terr in dismissing the adoption action based on a lack of \r\n\t\t\tjurisdiction?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court \r\n\t\t\terr in granting full faith and credit to the September Illinois \r\n\t\t\tOrder when the Illinois proceedings were held without proper notice \r\n\t\t\tto appellants and they were not named as parties?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBefore proceeding\r\n  to the full discussion of the legal issues, we note that this is a difficult\r\n  case.Â  It is complicated, both factually and legally, and of course, it is an\r\n  emotional issue for all the parties involved.Â  Most significantly, the ultimate\r\n  decision impacts the life of a very young child.Â   \r\nIn addition, Birthfather has forfeited his rights in this matter,\r\n  per his affidavit submitted to this Court.Â  Although he is the party who\r\n  petitioned the Illinois court to vacate its initial order, and he is the one\r\n  who requested that the South Carolina adoption matter be dismissed, he is no\r\n  longer legally asserting his rights at all in this matter.\r\n1.Â \r\n  Jurisdiction\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue that South Carolina is the appropriate jurisdiction to litigate the\r\n  custody and adoption of Baby Girl.Â  More specifically, appellants contend that\r\n  under applicable federal and state statutes, jurisdiction vested in South Carolina when the family court issued the August S.C. Order which gave temporary\r\n  custody of Baby Girl to appellants.Â  Therefore, the Illinois court should not\r\n  have issued its September Illinois Order which altered Baby Girlâ€™s custody\r\n  status, and the family court erred in concluding that Illinois was properly\r\n  exercising continuing jurisdiction over the custody matter.Â  We agree.\r\nAppellants first argue that a federal statute, the Parental Kidnapping Prevention\r\n  Act (PKPA), applies to this case and the family court\r\n  erred in not considering its effect.\r\nCongress\r\n  enacted the PKPA in 1980.Â  See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A (2000).Â  The primary purposes of the PKPA are to:Â  (1) promote cooperation between\r\n  State courts so that a determination of custody is rendered in the State which\r\n  can best decide the case in the interest of the child; (2) facilitate the enforcement of\r\n  custody decrees of sister States; (3) discourage continuing interstate controversies over child custody in the\r\n  interest of greater stability of home environment and of secure family\r\n  relationships for the child; and (4)\r\n  avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict between State courts in matters\r\n  of child custody which have in the past resulted in the shifting of children\r\n  from State to State with harmful effects on their well-being.Â  See PKPA,\r\n  Pub. L. No. 96-611, Â§7(c) (1980).\r\nThe\r\n  following relevant terms are defined by the PKPA:\r\n\r\n\t(3) â€œcustody determinationâ€ means a judgment, decree, or\r\n  other order of a court providing for the custody of a child, and includes\r\n  permanent and temporary orders, and initial orders and modifications;\r\n\tâ€¦\r\n\t(5) â€œmodificationâ€ and â€œmodifyâ€ refer to a custody or\r\n  visitation determination which modifies, replaces, supersedes, or otherwise is\r\n  made subsequent to, a prior custody or visitation determination concerning the\r\n  same child, whether made by the same court or not;\r\n\t(6) â€œperson acting as a\r\n  parentâ€ means a person, other than a parent, who has physical custody of a\r\n  child and who has either been awarded custody by a court or claims a right to\r\n  custody;\r\n\t(7) â€œphysical custodyâ€ means actual possession and\r\n  control of a child.\r\n\r\n28\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§ 1738A(b). Â In addition, â€œhome Stateâ€ under the PKPA is defined as:\r\n \r\n\r\n\tthe State in which,\r\n  immediately preceding the time involved, the child lived with his parents, a\r\n  parent, or a person acting as parent, for at least six consecutive months, and\r\n    in the case of a child less than six months old, the State in which the child\r\n    lived from birth with any of such persons. \r\n\r\n28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(b)(4)\r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nThe PKPA is primarily concerned with when full faith\r\n  and credit should be given to another Stateâ€™s custody determination.Â  The\r\n  statute directs a State to enforce, and not modify, any custody\r\n  determination made consistently with the provisions of this section by another\r\n  State court.Â  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(a).Â  A Stateâ€™s custody\r\n  determination is consistent with the PKPA if the State had jurisdiction under\r\n  its own law, and it was either the â€œhome Stateâ€ of child or,\r\n  if there is no â€œhome State,â€ it is in the best interest of the child that the\r\n  State assume jurisdiction.Â  See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(c).[4]Â   \r\nThe PKPA also provides when a State should not assume jurisdiction:\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  court of a State shall not exercise jurisdiction in any proceeding for a\r\n  custody or visitation determination commenced during the pendency of a\r\n  proceeding in a court of another State where such court of that other State\r\n    is exercising jurisdiction consistently with the provisions of this section to\r\n    make a custody or visitation determination.\r\n\r\n28\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(g) (emphasis added).\r\nIn\r\n  other words, when another state has already entered a custody determination\r\n  concerning this child, the inquiry is â€œwhether the first-in time courtâ€™s\r\n  exercise of jurisdiction was in accordance with the PKPA and whether that\r\n  jurisdiction continues.â€Â  People ex rel. A.J.C., 88 P.3d 599, 611&nbsp;(Colo. 2004). \r\n \r\nAppellantsâ€™\r\n  argument is that the August SC Order granting them temporary custody of Baby\r\n  Girl was consistent with the PKPA, and therefore, the September Illinois Order\r\n  was issued in contravention of the PKPA.Â  This begs the question of whether the\r\n  very first order issued in this case - the June Illinois Order - was a custody\r\n  order for PKPA purposes.Â  If it was, then arguably Illinois is the\r\n  â€œfirst-in-timeâ€ court, and the August SC Order should not have been issued.Â \r\n  However, in our opinion, the initial Illinois order was not a â€œcustody determinationâ€\r\n  as that term is used in the PKPA.\r\nFirst,\r\n  we note the record reveals no â€œpleadingsâ€ for the June Illinois proceedings.Â  Likewise,\r\n  there is no written order in the record.Â  The only evidence of the\r\n  proceedings is the June 19th transcript.Â  From this transcript, we\r\n  find that the purpose and result of the proceedings was a limited one - to name\r\n  attorney Patton temporary guardian for the purpose of facilitating both the interstate\r\n  transport of Baby Girl from Illinois to South Carolina and the subsequent South Carolina adoption.Â  Indeed, it appears that under Illinois law, such naming of a\r\n  guardian empowers the guardian to consent to adoption.Â  See 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann 405/3-30; see also 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann.50/1(F) (stating\r\n  that a child is available for adoption when a person authorized by law, other\r\n  than the parents, has consented).\r\nThe\r\n  PKPA clearly envisions physical custody determinations.Â  See 28 U.S.C.A.\r\n  Â§ 1738A(b)(7).Â  In the instant case, Baby Girl never â€œlived withâ€ Patton -\r\n  Patton simply never had physical custody of the baby.Â  Moreover, it is obvious\r\n  from the transcript that Patton was not named guardian for the purpose of her becoming\r\n  a â€œperson acting as a parent,â€ and Patton has never claimed a right to Baby\r\n  Girlâ€™s custody.Â  See Â§ 1738A(b)(6).Â  Â Consequently, we find the June\r\n  Illinois Order was not a â€œcustody determinationâ€ as that term is defined under\r\n  the PKPA.[5]Â   \r\nBecause\r\n  its initial order was not a custody determination, the Illinois courts simply did\r\n  not have jurisdiction over the custody of Baby Girl prior to the South Carolina courtâ€™s exercise of jurisdiction.Â  Additionally, Illinois could not have\r\n  â€œcontinuing jurisdictionâ€ if it never had initial jurisdiction over the custody\r\n  matter; therefore, the Illinois court also did not have jurisdiction under the\r\n  PKPA to issue its September Illinois Order.Â  See Â§ 1738A(d) (providing\r\n  for continuing jurisdiction only if the custody determination originally made\r\n  was consistent with the PKPA).Â Â   \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the South Carolina family court was, under the PKPA, the â€œfirst-in-timeâ€ court\r\n  to make a custody determination when it issued the August SC Order which granted temporary legal custody of Baby\r\n  Girl to appellants. Â People ex rel.\r\n    A.J.C., supra.Â  The next inquiry is whether this order was issued\r\n  properly under the PKPA.\r\nThe August\r\n  SC Order determining custody is consistent with the PKPA if the family court\r\n  had jurisdiction under South Carolina law, and: Â (1) South Carolina was the\r\n  home State under the PKPA, or (2) if no home State existed at the time, it was\r\n  in Baby Girlâ€™s best interest for South Carolina to assume jurisdiction.Â  See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(c).Â  Pursuant to the PKPA, the best\r\n  interest of the child is met when the child and at least one contestant have a\r\n  significant connection with the State assuming jurisdiction (other than mere\r\n  physical presence in the State), and there is substantial evidence concerning\r\n  the childâ€™s present or future care, protection, training, and personal\r\n  relationships in the State assuming jurisdiction.Â  28 U.S.C. Â§\r\n  1738A(c)(2)(B).\r\nWhen\r\n  the family court issued the August SC Order granting temporary custody to\r\n  appellants, Baby Girl had been living with appellants in South Carolina since\r\n  she was four days old, and appellants had filed an adoption action in South Carolina family court.Â  Because Baby Girl was born in Illinois and hence had not\r\n  lived in South Carolina from birth, we find South Carolina cannot be considered\r\n  Baby Girlâ€™s home State.[6]Â \r\n  We find, however, that it clearly was in Baby Girlâ€™s best interest to have\r\n  South Carolina assume jurisdiction because, at that time, she had a\r\n  significant connection to this State, and South Carolina was the only State in\r\n  which there was evidence concerning her care and personal relationships.Â  See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(c)(2)(B).Â  Accordingly, we hold the August SC Order granting\r\n  appellantsâ€™ temporary custody of Baby Girl was proper under the PKPA.\r\nIn\r\n  contrast, the September Illinois Order contravened the PKPA.Â  When the Illinois court granted Birthfatherâ€™s request to vacate the guardianship proceedings and\r\n  ordered the return of Baby Girl to Birthmother, there was already in place a South Carolina custody order.Â  Thus, we agree with appellants that the September Illinois\r\n  Order ran afoul of the PKPA. Â See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(a) (a State shall\r\n  not modify any custody determination made consistently with the provisions of\r\n  this section by another State court).Â  Furthermore, under 28\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(g),[7] the Illinois court should not have modified the custody arrangement because\r\n  there was an adoption action pending in South Carolina which was proceeding\r\n  properly under the PKPA.Â  Thus, we agree with appellants that the Illinois courtâ€™s exercise of jurisdiction which modified the custody arrangement violated\r\n  the PKPA.\r\nAppellants\r\n  next argue that under South Carolinaâ€™s Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act\r\n  (â€œUCCJAâ€), South Carolina is the â€œhome Stateâ€ of Baby Girl.Â  As stated above, however,\r\n  we find that South Carolina cannot be Baby Girlâ€™s â€œhome State.â€Â  Instead, we\r\n  find Baby Girl had no home state under either the PKPA or the UCCJA.\r\nThe Legislature passed the UCCJA in 1981.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-782 et seq. (1985).Â  The stated purposes of the legislation\r\n  are essentially the same as those listed above for the PKPA.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-784(a)(1)-(3).Â  The Court of Appeals\r\n  has held that because an adoption action\r\n  ultimately results in the termination of a natural parentâ€™s custody rights, an\r\n  adoption proceeding properly falls within the ambit of the UCCJA.Â  Clark v. Gordon, 313 S.C. 240, 242-43, 437 S.E.2d 144, 145-46&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  1993).\r\nSimilar to the PKPA, the UCCJA defines â€œhome Stateâ€ as:\r\n \r\n\r\n\tthe\r\n  state in which the child immediately preceding the time involved lived with his\r\n  parents, a parent, or a person acting as parent, for at least six consecutive\r\n  months, and in the case of a child less than six months old the state in which\r\n  the child lived from birth with any of the persons mentioned. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-786(5).Â  The UCCJA confers jurisdiction on the South Carolina family court\r\n  if South Carolina is the home State of the child at\r\n  the time of commencement of the proceeding.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-788(a)(1).Â Â  In the alternative, the UCCJA allows jurisdiction if it is in\r\n  the best interest of the child, defined similarly as in the PKPA. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788(a)(2).\r\nRegarding\r\n  the home State debate, courts in several jurisdictions have decided that when a\r\n  baby who is born in one State, but within days of birth is transported to\r\n  another State, the baby simply has no home State.Â  See, e.g., In re Zachariah K., 6 Cal.App.4th 1025 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992); Matter\r\n    of Adoption of Baby Girl B., 867 P.2d 1074, 1080&nbsp;(Kan. Ct. App. 1994); Matter of Adoption of Child by T.W.C., 636 A.2d 1083, 1088&nbsp;(N.J.\r\n  Super. Ct. 1994).Â  We agree with these jurisdictions and find that Baby Girl\r\n  has no home State under the UCCJA. Â \r\nFirst,\r\n  the express language of the home State definition precludes South Carolina from\r\n  being the home State of Baby Girl. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-786(5) (when the\r\n  child is less than six months old, the home State is the State in which the\r\n  child lived from birth).Â  Baby Girl was born in Illinois; she did not\r\n  live in South Carolina from birth. Â Second, because Baby Girl was born in Illinois, but only remained in that State for less than four days, Illinois cannot be\r\n  considered the home State of Baby Girl. Â Cf. In re D.S., 840\r\n  N.E.2d 1216, 1222&nbsp;(Ill. 2005) (where the Illinois Supreme Court stated\r\n  that â€œa temporary hospital stay incident to delivery is simply insufficient to\r\n  confer â€˜home stateâ€™ jurisdictionâ€ under the UCCJEA).Â  Accordingly, we find Baby\r\n  Girl had no home State at the time the orders on appeal were issued.\r\nWhen\r\n  the child has no home State, the court must â€œexamine whether a sufficiently\r\n  significant connection and substantial evidence exists to exercise jurisdiction.â€Â  In re Amberley D.,&nbsp;775 A.2d 1158, 1164&nbsp;(Me. 2001); see also 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(c)(2)(B) (jurisdiction vests if in best interest of child); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788(a)(2) (same).\r\nWe\r\n  find that under both the PKPA and the UCCJA, the South Carolina family court had\r\n  appropriately assumed jurisdiction when it issued the August SC Order.Â  See id.Â  Because jurisdiction was proper in South Carolina, Illinois inappropriately modified the custody determination in its September Illinois Order.\r\n  Â See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(g); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-794(a).Â  \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  sum, we hold the family court erred in dismissing appellantsâ€™ adoption case\r\n  based on a lack of jurisdiction.[8]Â \r\n  Under both federal and state law, the South Carolina family court had\r\n  jurisdiction to make the custody determination found in the August SC Order.Â  \r\n \r\n2.Â  Full\r\n  Faith and Credit\r\nAppellants\r\n  next argue the family court erred in its February SC Order when it accorded\r\n  full, faith and credit to the September Illinois Order.Â  Appellants maintain\r\n  the Illinois order is flawed because they were not named as parties to the Illinois actions and were not given proper notice and an opportunity to be heard.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nThe\r\n  PKPA requires that before a custody determination is made, reasonable notice and\r\n  opportunity to be heard shall be given to the contestants, any parent whose\r\n  parental rights have not been previously terminated, and any person who has\r\n  physical custody of a child.Â  28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(e); see also S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-790 (providing the same requirements under the UCCJA).  \r\n&nbsp;â€œThe purpose of the UCCJA requiring notice is to preserve the fairness of the hearing.â€Â  Clark v. Gordon, 313 S.C. 240, 246, 437 S.E.2d 144, 147&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â \r\n  Put simply, the family court must â€œâ€˜afford full faith and credit to custody\r\n  orders of other states only if those orders are competently entered in\r\n  accordance with standards set forth inâ€™â€ the UCCJA. Â Id. at 245, 437\r\n  S.E.2d at 147&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993) (quoting Purdie v. Smalls, 293\r\n  S.C. 216, 222, 359 S.E.2d 306, 309 (Ct. App. 1987)) (emphasis added).Â  In other\r\n  words, â€œjudgments obtained in violation of procedural\r\n  due process are not entitled to full faith and credit when sued upon in another\r\n  jurisdiction.â€ Â Purdie v. Smalls, 293 S.C. at 220, 359 S.E.2d at 308.\r\nHere,\r\n  it is clear from the face of the Illinois pleadings appellants were never named\r\n  as parties despite the fact that they had physical custody of Baby Girl.Â  This\r\n  is a patent violation of both federal and state law.Â  See 28 U.S.C. Â§\r\n  1738A(e); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-790.  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  although appellants received indirect notice of the Illinois hearing and\r\n  retained an attorney to enter a special appearance, they were never officially\r\n  served notice of the hearing and were not provided with copies of the\r\n  pleadings.Â  Respondents contend that because appellants admit they had actual\r\n  notice and made an appearance, their due process rights were protected.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  Where there is not even an attempt at service of process, the notice\r\n  requirements of the PKPA are not met, and actual notice is insufficient to\r\n  confer personal jurisdiction. Â See Ex parte D.B.,&nbsp;___ So.2d\r\n  ___, 2007 WL 1723618, *12-13 (Ala. 2007).\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, appellants were consistently excluded as parties from the Illinois pleadings filed by both Birthfather and Birthmother.Â  This was unfair to\r\n  appellants who, at the time, had physical custody of Baby Girl.Â  We find appellantsâ€™\r\n  due process rights were compromised in the resulting Illinois court proceedings,\r\n  and therefore, South Carolina is not bound by the September Illinois Order.Â  Clark v. Gordon, supra (judgments obtained\r\n  in violation of procedural due process are not entitled to full faith and\r\n  credit).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the family court erred in issuing its February SC Order which enforced\r\n  the September Illinois Order awarding custody to Birthmother.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons discussed above, we reverse the family court orders which dismissed\r\n  appellantsâ€™ adoption action and enforced the Illinois custody award to\r\n  Birthmother.Â  Accordingly, we reinstate: Â (1) the August SC Order awarding custody\r\n  of Baby Girl to appellants, and (2) appellantsâ€™ adoption action.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  we order Birthmother to return Baby Girl to appellants within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion.Â \r\n  This matter is remanded to the family court for further proceedings consistent\r\n  with our decision.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice J.\r\n  Ernest Kinard, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Birthfather had notice of this emergency hearing, but\r\n  his South Carolina counsel arrived too late to participate.Â  Counsel then filed\r\n  a Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider.Â  The family court denied the motion on\r\n  October 14, 2006, because appellants did not receive timely notice of the\r\n  motion.  \r\n[2] Birthmotherâ€™s allegation appears to be that Illinois law requires that 72 hours elapse prior to consenting to adoption.Â \r\n  At the June 19th hearing, however, Birthmother stated under oath\r\n  that she was consenting to adoption by a South Carolina couple, and also her\r\n  consent to that adoption was going to be memorialized as a consent under South Carolina law.Â  In the Consent to Jurisdiction that she signed on June 19th,\r\n  Birthmother stated the following:\r\nI\r\n  have been advised that under South Carolina law, my Relinquishment can be\r\n  signed anytime after the birth of the child and that my Relinquishment is\r\n  irrevocable upon signing.Â  I have been advised that I may challenge the\r\n  validity of my Relinquishment only by filing a petition in South Carolina\r\n  alleging fraud, coercion, duress, or that I did not sign the Relinquishment\r\n  voluntarily and that my childâ€™s best interest would be served by being removed\r\n  from the care of the adoptive parents.\r\nThis is an accurate\r\n  summary of the applicable South Carolina law, under which there is no waiting\r\n  period required prior to signing a relinquishment for purposes of adoption. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1700 through 1720 (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â   \r\n[3] According to Respondentsâ€™\r\n  brief, appellants received notice of the hearing and made a special appearance\r\n  to object to jurisdiction.Â  However, according to appellantsâ€™ brief, they\r\n  received only â€œindirect noticeâ€ of the Illinois proceedings.Â  While they\r\n  retained Illinois counsel to enter a special appearance to contest\r\n  jurisdiction, appellants claim they were never provided with copies of the\r\n  pleadings to vacate the guardianship.Â   \r\n[4] See also Greg Waller, Note, When\r\n  The Rules Donâ€™t Fit The Game:Â  Application Of The Uniform Child Custody\r\n  Jurisdiction Act And The Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act To Interstate\r\n  Adoption Proceedings, 33 Harv. J. on Legis. 271, 282&nbsp;(1996) (Under the\r\n  PKPA, preference is given to â€œhome stateâ€ jurisdiction, but â€œbest interestâ€\r\n  jurisdiction may be asserted when no other state qualifies as the childâ€™s â€œhome\r\n  stateâ€) (hereinafter â€œWhen The Rules Donâ€™t Fit The Gameâ€).\r\n[5] We recognize that many guardianship orders may indeed\r\n  be custody determinations subject to the PKPA, but only when those orders truly\r\n  confer custody of the child on the named guardian.Â  See, e.g., Jackson\r\n    v. Hendricks, 893 A.2d 292&nbsp;(Vt. 2005) (where the case involved a\r\n  Vermont family courtâ€™s modification of an existing custody determination which\r\n  was a Connecticut order awarding legal guardianship, i.e. custody, of the child\r\n  to his maternal grandmother).Â  It is clear, however, that the Illinois\r\n  â€œguardianshipâ€ in the instant case is distinct from a guardianship which awards\r\n  custody.  \r\n[6] The â€œhome Stateâ€ concept will be discussed more fully infra.\r\n[7] Section 1738A(g) states that a State court shall not exercise jurisdiction in any proceeding for\r\n  a custody determination that is â€œcommenced during the pendency of a proceeding\r\n  in a court of another State where such court of that other State is exercising\r\n  jurisdiction consistently withâ€ the PKPA.\r\n[8] We note the family court also erred in finding that\r\n  pursuant to the ICPC, Illinois had jurisdiction in this case.Â  While the ICPC\r\n  does state that the â€œsending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child\r\n  sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody â€¦ of the child\r\n  which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agencyâ€™s\r\n  state, until the child is adopted,â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1980 (1985), we find\r\n  this section was not meant to trump both the federal (PKPA) and state (UCCJA)\r\n  statutory sections more specifically related to conferring jurisdiction.Â  See When The Rules Donâ€™t Fit The Game, 33 Harv. J. on Legis. at 288 n.76&nbsp;(â€œSince a court is only one of many parties that may be a\r\n  â€˜sending agencyâ€™ under the ICPC, â€˜jurisdictionâ€™ arguably has a different\r\n  meaning under the ICPC than under the UCCJA and PKPA.â€).Â  Moreover, we note the\r\n  ICPC was designed to ensure that placements for children\r\n  across state lines are safe; it was not designed to protect the rights of the\r\n  birth parents.Â  In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, 701 A.2d 110, 121\r\n  (Md. 1997). Â Certainly, there was no evidence that Baby Girlâ€™s placement with\r\n  appellants had become unsafe in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26426","title":"In the Matter of O.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia; for the Office of Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tC. Rauch Wise, of Greenwood; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In\r\n  this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed\r\n  formal charges against respondent, O. Lee Sturkey, alleging misconduct in eight\r\n  different criminal matters.Â  Sturkey failed to answer, and he was found to be\r\n  in default.Â  After a hearing, both the sub-panel and the full panel of the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct recommended that respondent be sanctioned with: Â a\r\n  nine-month definite suspension; mandatory compliance with a law office\r\n  management assistance program as a condition of reinstatement; and payment of\r\n  costs of the proceedings.Â  We impose the recommended sanction.Â  However, we\r\n  address ODCâ€™s argument on appeal that the Commission erred in allowing certain\r\n  evidence to be considered in mitigation without giving ODC the opportunity to\r\n  present counter-testimony.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent, the part-time public defender\r\n  for McCormick, Edgefield, and Saluda counties, had a caseload averaging more\r\n  than 700 cases per year.Â  Eight complaints against him by clients or spouses of\r\n  clients were received by ODC.Â  Respondent failed to respond to the formal\r\n  charges, and he was held in default.Â  The factual allegations regarding the\r\n  eight matters, as admitted by virtue of respondentâ€™s default, are as follows:Â \r\n  (1) ODC received a complaint from Client A alleging respondent failed to\r\n  adequately represent him in a criminal matter; (2) ODC received a complaint\r\n  from Client B alleging respondent failed to adequately communicate with him\r\n  regarding a criminal matter and that he failed to appear in court; (3) ODC\r\n  received a complaint from Client C alleging respondent failed to pursue his\r\n  clientâ€™s objectives and failed to adequately communicate with him about his\r\n  criminal case; (4) ODC received a complaint from Client D alleging respondent\r\n  failed to pursue his objectives in his criminal matter; (5) ODC received a\r\n  complaint from Client E alleging respondent failed to provide him with\r\n  information and documents he requested relating to his criminal case; (6) ODC\r\n  received a complaint from Client F alleging respondent failed to adequately\r\n  communicate with him about his criminal case; (7) ODC received a complaint from\r\n  Client G alleging respondent failed to diligently pursue his criminal case and\r\n  failed to respond to his calls and letters; and (8) ODC received a complaint\r\n  from the husband of Client H, alleging respondent engaged in confidential\r\n  conversations with Client H in front of law enforcement officers and respondent\r\n  failed to provide her with competent and diligent representation.Â  Respondent\r\n  failed to: Â comply with ODCâ€™s initial requests to respond to the complaints of\r\n  Client A and Client B;Â  respond to the request for a written response in all\r\n  eight matters; and provide additional information requested by ODC, including\r\n  client files, in regard to Client A, Client B, Client F, and Client G.  \r\nThe Hearing\r\nBecause\r\n  respondent admitted the factual allegations by virtue of his default, a hearing\r\n  was held before the sub-panel solely for the purpose of recommending an\r\n  appropriate sanction.Â  Despite the fact that respondent only gave ODC notice of\r\n  witnesses via telephone two days before the hearing, ODC did not object to the\r\n  presentation of respondentâ€™s mitigation witnesses.Â  One of the witnesses was\r\n  Ervin Maye, the assistant solicitor in charge of McCormick, Edgefield, and Saluda counties.Â  In addition to testifying favorably about his observations of respondentâ€™s\r\n  skills as a trial lawyer and character, Maye began to testify regarding the favorable\r\n  disposition of some of the criminal matters against the complainants.Â  ODC\r\n  objected to any testimony regarding the underlying criminal matters, arguing\r\n  they were deemed admitted by default and any testimony regarding lack of harm\r\n  would have no bearing on the case.Â  The sub-panel allowed the testimony,\r\n  limited to whether a client was harmed, and denied ODCâ€™s request for a\r\n  continuance in order to call the complainants to testify to counter the\r\n  information.Â   \r\nAfter Mayeâ€™s testimony regarding the outcome of some of the\r\n  matters, ODC renewed its objection to the consideration of the outcome of the\r\n  clientsâ€™ cases in determining harm because they were not given notice of the\r\n  purpose of Mayeâ€™s testimony such that they could present counter testimony\r\n  regarding harm to clients.Â  The sub-panel ultimately denied the motion, stating\r\n  it considered all the matters from the complaint deemed admitted via\r\n  respondentâ€™s default.Â   \r\nAfter\r\n  presenting the testimony of another character witness, respondent testified.Â \r\n  Respondent stated he had a large caseload as a public defender, but he could\r\n  not explain his failure to respond to ODCâ€™s requests other than being\r\n  completely overwhelmed.Â  Over ODCâ€™s objections, respondent also testified\r\n  regarding the favorable outcomes of the cases involving Clients B, C, D, E, F,\r\n  and H.Â   \r\nAfter the hearing, the sub-panel found respondent engaged in\r\n  misconduct in violation of:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR (violating a Rule of Professional Conduct); Rule\r\n  7(a)(3) (willful failure to comply with a subpoena or knowing failure to\r\n  respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority); and Rule 7(a)(5)\r\n  (conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or bringing the legal\r\n  profession into disrepute).Â  With regard to the specific matters before the\r\n  sub-panel, it found respondent violated the following rules:\r\n\r\n\t(1) Rule 1.4, RPC (failure to communicate with a client) with\r\n  regard to Clients B, C, E, F, and G;\r\n\t(2) Rule 1.2, RPC (failure to pursue clientâ€™s objectives and scope\r\n  of representation) in the matters involving Clients C and D;\r\n\t(3) Rule 1.3, RPC (failure to represent with due diligence) with\r\n  regard to Clients G and H; and\r\n\t(4) Rule 1.1, RPC (competence), and Rule 1.6 (confidentiality)\r\n  with regard to Client H. \r\n\r\nThe sub-panel considered as aggravating factors:Â  (1) respondentâ€™s\r\n  prior disciplinary history and failure to comply with the requirement that he\r\n  change the way he ran his office; (2) his pattern of misconduct and multiple\r\n  offenses; (3) his failure to respond to or cooperate with ODC; and (4) his\r\n  substantial experience practicing law.Â  The sub-panel considered as mitigating\r\n  factors the evidence of respondentâ€™s good character and abilities as a trial\r\n  lawyer.Â  With regard to the evidence that there was no harm to clients, the sub-panel\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n\tWe recognize that client harm is a subjective factor difficult to\r\n  measure when clients plead guilty, but we do consider the apparent lack of harm\r\n  as a mitigating factor for which we give appropriate weight in our discretion\r\n  as a panel.Â  As a result of Respondentâ€™s failure to answer the formal charges,\r\n  it is undisputed that Respondent failed to adequately communicate with his\r\n  clients in the [Client B], [Client C], [Client E], [Client F], and [Client G]\r\n  matters; that he failed to adequately pursue his clientsâ€™ objectives in the [Client\r\n  C] and [Client D] matters; that he failed to diligently pursue his clientsâ€™\r\n  cases in the [Client G] and [Client H] matters, and, that he failed to\r\n  competently represent [Client H] and revealed confidential information in her\r\n  case.Â  The facts that these clients ultimately plead [sic] guilty to lesser\r\n  offenses than those with which they were originally charged and that the\r\n  solicitor believes these were good results are given slight consideration in\r\n  our recommendation, due to the difficulty in measuring harm under such\r\n  circumstances.Â  \r\n\r\nThe sub-panel gave some consideration to respondentâ€™s heavy\r\n  caseload and the systematic problems with the public defender system, but it\r\n  found respondent still had the obligation to only accept as many cases as he\r\n  could ethically handle.Â  The sub-panel noted that, at a minimum, respondent\r\n  should have adopted the case and office management systems introduced to him\r\n  during his participation in LOMAP pursuant to his 2000 disciplinary sanction.Â \r\n  Finally, the sub-panel noted respondentâ€™s large caseload and the lack of harm\r\n  to clients did not excuse his failure to respond to or communicate with his\r\n  clients.Â  After considering all of these matters, the sub-panel recommended respondent\r\n  be sanctioned with a definite suspension of nine months, required to\r\n  participate in a law office management assistance program, and pay the costs of\r\n  the proceedings.Â   \r\nOver ODCâ€™s objection that it was error for the sub-panel to\r\n  consider Mayeâ€™s testimony of a favorable result as evidence of no harm to\r\n  clients, the full panel adopted the sub-panelâ€™s report and recommendation.Â  ODC\r\n  appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nNeither ODC nor Sturkey complain about the recommended sanction. Â Sturkeyâ€™s failure to\r\n  communicate with his clients, failure to pursue their objectives, and failure\r\n  to respond to ODC inquiries and requests to answer or provide documentation\r\n  regarding the eight matters are serious offenses.Â  Considering Sturkeyâ€™s\r\n  failure to adequately communicate with his clients and complete disregard for\r\n  the disciplinary process, we agree with the Commission that Sturkey violated\r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct and, thus, there are grounds for discipline\r\n  in this case. Â See Rule\r\n  1.1, RPC (competence); Rule 1.2, RPC (failure to pursue clientâ€™s objectives and\r\n  scope of representation); Rule 1.3, RPC (failure to represent with due\r\n  diligence); Rule 1.4, RPC (failure to communicate with a client); and Rule 1.6\r\n  (confidentiality); Rule 7(a)(1), RLDE (violating a Rule of Professional\r\n  Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3), RLDE (willful failure to comply with a subpoena or\r\n  knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority);\r\n  and Rule 7(a)(5), RLDE (conduct tending to pollute the administration of\r\n  justice or bringing the legal profession into disrepute).Â   \r\nBecause of the seriousness of his offenses, we find the Commissionâ€™s\r\n  recommendation of a nine-month suspension, mandatory compliance with a law\r\n  office management assistance program, and payment of costs is appropriate.Â  See In re Strait, 343 S.C. 312, 540 S.E.2d 460 (2000) (sanctioning attorney\r\n  to a six-month and one day suspension for:Â  failing to act diligently; failing\r\n  to return client phone calls; failing to inform client of dismissal of case;\r\n  failing to return client materials; and failing to timely respond to ODC\r\n  correspondence); In re Shibley, 337 S.C. 50, 522 S.E.2d 812 (1999)\r\n  (sanctioning attorney to a two-year suspension for:Â  failing to represent\r\n  client diligently, promptly, and competently; failing to keep client informed\r\n  about the status of the case; terminating representation without taking steps\r\n  to protect clientâ€™s interest; violating a valid court order; and failing to\r\n  cooperate with the ODC investigation); In re Matson, 333 S.C. 242, 509\r\n  S.E.2d 263 (1998) (sanctioning attorney to a definite suspension for eighteen\r\n  months for:Â  neglect of legal matters; failure to communicate with clients;\r\n  failure to protect clientsâ€™ interests when terminating representation; and\r\n  failure to cooperate with ODC).Â  Â \r\nHowever, ODC complains that the Commission should not have considered the testimony\r\n  regarding the final disposition of the complainantsâ€™ cases as evidence of lack\r\n  of harm in mitigation without allowing ODC the opportunity to present\r\n  counter-evidence.Â  We agree.  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  parties to disciplinary proceedings are required to exchange witness lists\r\n  within twenty days of filing the answer.Â  Rule 25(a), RLDE.Â  The parties also\r\n  must exchange documents and witness statements to be presented at the hearing.Â \r\n  Rule 25(b)(1), RLDE.Â  Where a party fails to timely disclose witness names or\r\n  statements as required by the rules, the sub-panel or hearing officer may\r\n  â€œgrant a continuance of the hearing, preclude the party from calling the\r\n  witness or introducing the document, or take such other action as may be\r\n  appropriate.â€Â  Rule 25(g), RLDE.Â   \r\nODC did\r\n  not object to respondent presenting witnesses in mitigation, despite the fact\r\n  that he defaulted, failed to cooperate in general, and failed to give\r\n  sufficient prior notice of the witnesses.Â  Mayeâ€™s mitigating testimony\r\n  regarding the ultimate outcome of the complainantsâ€™ cases touched on more substantive\r\n  matters than the usual mitigation testimony regarding the respondentâ€™s\r\n  character and personal situation.Â  Lack of harm, similar to lack of prejudice,\r\n  may be considered as mitigating evidence in a disciplinary action.Â  In re\r\n    McFarland, 360 S.C. 101, 105, 600 S.E.2d 537, 539 (2004) (considering the\r\n  lack of prejudice to the clientâ€™s case as a mitigating factor).Â  However,\r\n  considering the surprise nature of the lack of harm evidence presented in this\r\n  default case, it should have been considered in conjunction with rebuttal\r\n  evidence showing actual harm.Â  Despite the Commissionâ€™s finding that it did not\r\n  give much weight to the lack of harm evidence, we find the Commission abused\r\n  its discretion in denying the continuance because it did not allow ODC the\r\n  opportunity to obtain and present evidence to rebut the surprise lack of harm\r\n  evidence.Â   \r\nWe agree with the parties that a nine-month suspension, with\r\n  participation in a law office management program and payment of costs, is the\r\n  appropriate sanction for respondent.Â  We caution the Commission in the future\r\n  to carefully weigh the continuance decision when, as in the present case, the\r\n  parties present surprise evidence without prior notice to the obvious\r\n  disadvantage of the other party.Â   \r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26427","title":"Layman v.

The State of South Carolina and The South\r\n    Carolina Retirement System, 368 S.C. 631, 630 S.E.2d 265 (2006)\r\n  [hereinafter Layman].Â  In Layman, five plaintiffs filed an action\r\n  in the circuit court against the State of South Carolina (&quot;Stateâ€) and the\r\n  South Carolina Retirement System (&quot;Retirement Systemâ€) in response to the\r\n  enactment of the State Retirement System Preservation and Investment Reform Act[1] (&quot;Act 153â€).Â  Act 153 amended the Teachers and Employee Retention Incentive\r\n  (TERI) program and the Working Retiree program by requiring TERI participants and\r\n  Working Retirees to make pay-period contributions of their salaries into the\r\n  Retirement System when the statutes codifying these programs did not previously\r\n  require them to do so.[2]Â  \r\n \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted the plaintiffsâ€™ petition for original jurisdiction and certified\r\n  a class consisting of Working Retirees and TERI participants who entered into\r\n  these programs prior to Act 153â€™s effective date.Â  In the order granting\r\n  original jurisdiction, the Court set forth a timeline on which the case was to\r\n  proceed and further ordered the Retirement System to deposit all contributions\r\n  made by members of the class into an interest-bearing escrow account until the\r\n  Court entered a final decision in the matter.Â  The parties briefed and argued\r\n  the case in this Court, and the Court ultimately held that Act 153 breached a\r\n  legislatively-created contract as to the class of TERI participants, but not necessarily\r\n  as to the class of Working Retirees.Â  The Court ordered the return of\r\n  contributions made by all TERI participants between the effective date of Act\r\n  153 and the date of the Courtâ€™s opinion, with interest, and held that the TERI\r\n  participants were no longer required to contribute money to the Retirement\r\n  System.[3]Â   \r\nFollowing\r\n  the Courtâ€™s opinion in Layman, counsel for the TERI plaintiffs requested\r\n  that the Court award attorneysâ€™ fees under one of two alternative theories:Â \r\n  (1) an award of attorneysâ€™ fees under the common fund doctrine, or (2) an award\r\n  of costs to include attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300\r\n  (2005) (&quot;the state action statuteâ€).Â  This Court denied counselâ€™s motion for\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees under the common fund doctrine and remanded the request for\r\n  costs to a circuit judge to determine whether counsel were entitled to\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action statute.Â  The Court further instructed\r\n  the circuit judge to determine the amount of any such fees &quot;based on the actual\r\n  amount of work performed, expenses incurred, and the benefit obtained for all\r\n  of the old TERI participants.â€Â  Layman v. State, S.C. Sup. Ct. Order\r\n  dated June 1, 2006 (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 21 at 18).Â  The Courtâ€™s order also\r\n  decertified the class of TERI plaintiffs.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  remand, the circuit judge determined that counsel were entitled to attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees under the state action statute, and that the language of the statute, read\r\n  in conjunction with this Courtâ€™s directive in the remand order, did not limit\r\n  an award of attorneysâ€™ fees to an amount based on the hourly fee of plaintiffsâ€™\r\n  counsel.Â Â  Rather, the judge determined that counsel were entitled to\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees based on a &quot;percentage of the benefits obtained in conjunction\r\n  with the amount of work performed in obtaining such results.â€Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  circuit judge awarded counsel all &quot;expenses incurredâ€ in litigating the\r\n  underlying case, as well as 21% of the &quot;immediate benefitâ€ recovered for all\r\n  TERI participants, and 1% of the projected &quot;future benefitâ€ provided by counsel\r\n  to all TERI participants.[4]Â \r\n  These figures resulted in an award of $8,665,297.50 in attorneysâ€™ fees to be\r\n  paid by the State and the Retirement System pursuant to the state action\r\n  statute.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  State and the Retirement System filed a notice of appeal, and counsel for TERI\r\n  plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal.Â  We certified the appeals to this Court\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  Â Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  partiesâ€™ dispute in this case essentially involves two issues. First, the State\r\n  and the Retirement System argue that the circuit judge erred in finding that\r\n  counsel were entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action statute, which\r\n  requires a finding that the State and the Retirement System acted without\r\n  &quot;substantial justificationâ€ in defending their claim.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-77-300.Â  As a second issue, all parties question the circuit judgeâ€™s method\r\n  of determining a reasonable fee.Â  The State and the Retirement System argue\r\n  that the circuit judge should not have determined an award of attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  based on a percentage of the TERI participantsâ€™ recovery, and that using this\r\n  method of calculation resulted in an unreasonably high award of attorneysâ€™ fees.Â \r\n  In the cross-appeal, counsel for the TERI plaintiffs argue that the circuit\r\n  judge correctly calculated the attorneysâ€™ fees as a percentage of the TERI participantsâ€™\r\n  recovery, but that the percentage used resulted in an unreasonably low fee\r\n  award.\r\nStandard\r\n  of review\r\nThe\r\n  decision to award or deny attorneyâ€™s fees under the state action statute will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion by the trial court in\r\n  considering the applicable factors set forth by the statute.Â  McMillan v.\r\n    S.C. Dept. of Agric., 364 S.C. 60, 76, 611 S.E.2d 323, 331 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court are\r\n  either controlled by an error of law or are\r\n  based on unsupported factual conclusions.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs.,\r\n  346 S.C. 580, 601, 553 S.E.2d 110, 121 (2001).Â  Similarly, the specific amount\r\n  of attorneysâ€™ fees awarded pursuant to a statute authorizing reasonable\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be\r\n  disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C.\r\n  289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997).Â  In this case, however, the issue of the amount\r\n  of attorneysâ€™ fees awarded hinges on the Courtâ€™s interpretation of &quot;reasonableâ€\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees as contained in the state action statute.Â  The interpretation\r\n  of a statute is a question of law, which this Court reviews de novo.Â  Catawba Indian Tribe v. State, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; &quot;Substantial justificationâ€\r\n  under the state action statute.\r\nThe\r\n  State and the Retirement System argue that the circuit judge erred in finding\r\n  that counsel were entitled to an award of attorneysâ€™ fees under the state\r\n  action statute.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  state action statute provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tIn any civil action brought by the State, any\r\n  political subdivision of the State or any party who is contesting state action,\r\n  unless the prevailing party is the State or any political subdivision of the\r\n  State, the court may allow the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees to be taxed as court costs against the appropriate agency if:\r\n\t(1)Â Â Â Â  The\r\n  court finds that the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing\r\n  its claim against the party; and\r\n\t(2)Â Â Â Â  The\r\n  court finds that there are no special circumstances that would make the award\r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees unjust.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300.Â  In\r\n  the instant case, the State and the Retirement System argue that the circuit\r\n  judge abused his discretion in finding that they acted without substantial\r\n  justification in pressing their claim and that the circuit judge therefore\r\n  erred in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action statute.Â   \r\nSubstantial\r\n  justification for purposes of the state action statute means &quot;justified to a\r\n  degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.â€Â  Heath v. County of Aiken,\r\n  302 S.C. 178, 183, 394 S.E.2d 709, 712 (1990) (quoting Pierce v. Underwood,\r\n  487 U.S. 552, 564 (1988)).Â  Therefore, in deciding whether a state agency acted\r\n  with substantial justification, the relevant question is whether the agencyâ€™s\r\n  position in litigating the case had a reasonable basis in law and in fact.Â  McDowell\r\n    v. S.C. Dept. of Soc. Servs., 304 S.C. 539, 542, 405 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1991).Â \r\n  Although an agencyâ€™s loss on the merits does not create a presumption that its\r\n  position was not substantially justified, Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v.\r\n    S.C. Dept. of Revenue, 358 S.C. 647, 650, 595 S.E.2d 890, 892 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004), the substance and outcome of the matter litigated is nevertheless\r\n  relevant to the determination of whether there was substantial justification in\r\n  pressing a claim.Â  Heath, 302 S.C. at 183, 394 S.E.2d at 712.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  State and the Retirement System initially argue that the state action statute\r\n  does not apply because the TERI plaintiffs brought this suit against the State\r\n  of South Carolina, with the state agency (the Retirement System) included\r\n  merely as a &quot;stakeholder.â€Â  The State and the Retirement System contend that\r\n  under this procedural framework, the actions of the Retirement System are\r\n  irrelevant.Â  From this premise, the State and the Retirement System argue that\r\n  the Stateâ€™s actions (through the General Assembly) in adopting Act 153 may not\r\n  be scrutinized under a statute that references agency action, and\r\n  furthermore, that an award of attorneysâ€™ fees based on a finding that the General\r\n  Assembly acted without substantial justification in taking a particular\r\n  legislative action violates separation of powers principles.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  State and the Retirement System argue that the terms of the state action\r\n  statute prevent either of them from being liable for attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nWe\r\n  first find the characterization of the Retirement System as merely a\r\n  stakeholder in this litigation to be wholly inaccurate.Â  While it is true that early\r\n  in the litigation, counsel for TERI plaintiffs stated to the trial court that\r\n  the only reason for including the Retirement System as a party to the suit was\r\n  because the agency was a &quot;stakeholderâ€ with respect to the employee\r\n  contributions at issue, and that their clientsâ€™ substantive claims were with\r\n  the State alone, the central focus of the litigation has been the actions of\r\n  both the State and the Retirement System, with the Court referring to these\r\n  entities jointly as &quot;the State.â€Â  See Layman, 368 S.C. 631, 630 S.E.2d\r\n  265.Â  The Retirement System is a named party in the caption of this case, and\r\n  moreover, the Court specified that both entities would be liable when it\r\n  directed the circuit judge to determine the issue of whether attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  were to be &quot;taxed as court costs against the State of South Carolina and the\r\n  South Carolina Retirement Systemâ€ under the state action statute.Â  Layman v.\r\n    State, S.C. Sup. Ct. Order dated June 1, 2006 (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 21 at\r\n  18).Â   \r\nIn our\r\n  view, separating the liability of the State and the Retirement System is simply\r\n  an attempt by these parties to bar any potential for a fee award, and this\r\n  Court refuses to compartmentalize the actions of the State and the Retirement\r\n  System in this manner.Â  Instead, we believe the overriding principle of the\r\n  state action statute is that as a state agency, the Retirement System is\r\n  obligated to carry out the instructions of the State.Â  Furthermore, as a\r\n  governing body, the State is ultimately responsible for the actions of its\r\n  agencies.Â  That the statute plainly recognizes this principle is exhibited by\r\n  the language purporting to apply to cases in which a party is &quot;contesting state\r\n  action.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300.Â  For this reason, we find the attempt to\r\n  parse the actions of the State and the Retirement System unpersuasive, and therefore\r\n  hold that either the State or the Retirement System may be liable for\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees under the statute.\r\nTurning\r\n  to the Stateâ€™s and the Retirement Systemâ€™s separation of powers argument, we\r\n  find that although a judicial holding that the legislature &quot;failedâ€ in some\r\n  legislative capacity might give rise to separation of powers concerns, this is\r\n  not what we held in Layman.Â  Instead, this Court held that the\r\n  collective actions of the State and the Retirement System breached a contract\r\n  with certain TERI participants.Â  In light of this holding, the relevant\r\n  question in a substantial justification inquiry in this case does not lie with\r\n  the wisdom behind the Stateâ€™s enactment of Act 153 in and of itself, nor does\r\n  it lie with the authority of the Retirement System to enforce the statute.Â \r\n  Rather, the substantial justification inquiry in this case is based solely on\r\n  the Stateâ€™s and the Retirement Systemâ€™s maintenance of litigation in which they\r\n  defended a breach of their contract with the TERI participants.Â  Accordingly, separation\r\n  of powers concerns are not implicated by an assessment of liability for\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees in this case.\r\nThe\r\n  State and the Retirement System next argue that the state action statute does\r\n  not allow an award of attorneysâ€™ fees because they were substantially justified\r\n  in pressing their claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  State and the Retirement System contend that their actions in Layman were\r\n  substantially justified under Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v. S.C. Dept. of\r\n    Revenue, 358 S.C. 647, 595 S.E.2d 890 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In that case, a\r\n  video gaming business sought attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action statute\r\n  after this Court ruled in the underlying litigation that a state statute\r\n  prohibiting the advertising of video poker machines was an unconstitutional\r\n  restriction on commercial speech.Â  See id. at 649, 595 S.E.2d at\r\n  891.Â  The court of appeals found no evidence that the Department of\r\n  Revenue acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim against\r\n  the gaming business, reasoning that &quot;[a]s an administrative agency, the\r\n  Department â€˜must follow the law as written until its constitutionality is\r\n  judicially determined.â€™â€Â  Id. at 652, 595 S.E.2d at 892 (quoting Beaufort County Bd. of Educ. v. Lighthouse Charter Sch. Comm., 335 S.C. 230, 241,\r\n  516 S.E.2d 655, 660-61 (1999)).Â  The court of appeals determined that the\r\n  Department of Revenue was substantially justified in maintaining its action\r\n  against the gaming business because the Department was &quot;merely enforcing [the\r\n  statute] as it was obligated to do until a proper court determined the statute\r\n  to be unconstitutional.â€Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the court of appeals\r\n  held that the video gaming business could not recover attorneysâ€™ fees under the\r\n  statute.\r\nWe\r\n  find the instant case distinguishable from Video Gaming.Â  Although the\r\n  separation of powers principles articulated by the court of appeals in Video\r\n    Gaming were correctly applied in light of the issue of the video poker\r\n  statuteâ€™s constitutionality in that case, these same principles are not equally\r\n  applicable to a finding of substantial justification in this case, in which\r\n  this Court declined to address the constitutionality of Act 153, but instead\r\n  decided Layman solely on whether Act 153 constituted a breach of\r\n  contract.[5]Â \r\n  In other words, the State and the Retirement System in Layman were not\r\n  defending the validity of an unconstitutional statute, but rather, were\r\n  defending the validity of a statute that constituted a breach of contract.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  although separation of powers principles may substantially justify a state\r\n  agencyâ€™s defense of an unconstitutional statute, these same principles will not\r\n  substantially justify the Stateâ€™s and the Retirement Systemâ€™s defense of what\r\n  we held to be an illegal act.Â   \r\nInstead,\r\n  we find Heath v. County of Aiken to be instructive in this matter. 302\r\n  S.C. 178, 394 S.E.2d 709 (1990).Â  In Heath, this Court determined in the\r\n  underlying litigation that the local county council violated a state statute\r\n  prohibiting county governing bodies from developing personnel polices and\r\n  procedures for employees under the direction of an elected official.Â  Id. at 181, 394 S.E.2d at 710.Â  In reviewing whether county council was substantially\r\n  justified in pressing its claim, this Court examined the &quot;substance and outcome\r\n  of the matter eventually litigated,â€ and found that the statute construed in\r\n  the underlying case was &quot;unambiguous.â€Â  Id. at 184, 394 S.E.2d at\r\n  712.Â  The Court reasoned that when coupled with the relevant precedent, this\r\n  clearly established that the Countyâ€™s claims did not have a reasonable basis in\r\n  law or in fact.Â  Accordingly, the Court held that an award of attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  was appropriate under the state action statute.Â  Id.\r\nTurning\r\n  to the instant case, this Court held in Layman that the language in the\r\n  TERI statute created an unambiguous contract between the State and TERI\r\n  participants who entered the program prior to the enactment of Act 153, and\r\n  that the Stateâ€™s unilateral alteration of this agreement by applying the requirements\r\n  of Act 153 to this class of TERI participants constituted a breach of\r\n  contract.Â  368 S.C. at 640, 630 S.E.2d at 270.Â  In our view, the Stateâ€™s and\r\n  the Retirement Systemâ€™s breach of an unambiguous contract with the TERI\r\n  participants is analogous to the Countyâ€™s violation of an unambiguous statute\r\n  in Heath.Â  In other words, we find that the State and the Retirement\r\n  System had no reasonable basis in law or in fact on which to defend the breach\r\n  of an unambiguous contract with certain TERI participants.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  hold that the State and the Retirement System were not substantially justified\r\n  in pressing their claim, and therefore, the circuit judge correctly concluded\r\n  that counsel for TERI plaintiffs were entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees under the state\r\n  action statute.Â  See also McDowell, 304 S.C. at 543, 405 S.E.2d at 833\r\n  (finding that in relying on an erroneous legal conclusion, &quot;DSSâ€™s litigation\r\n  position was not substantially justified because it had no reasonable basis in\r\n  law and factâ€).\r\nAlthough\r\n  we hold that the State and the Retirement System were not substantially\r\n  justified in pressing their claim in Layman, at the same time, we agree\r\n  with the Stateâ€™s and the Retirement Systemâ€™s assertion that the circuit judge\r\n  erred in his findings regarding substantial justification.Â  Specifically, the circuit\r\n  judge ruled that the Stateâ€™s failure to investigate the legality of Act 153\r\n  before its enactment and the subsequent passing of Act 153 into law had no\r\n  reasonable basis in law or in fact.Â  We find that the circuit judgeâ€™s reasoning\r\n  is flawed in several respects.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  deciding whether a state agency acted with substantial justification, courts\r\n  must only determine whether the agencyâ€™s position in litigating the case has a\r\n  reasonable basis in law and in fact.Â  Id. at 542, 405 S.E.2d at\r\n  832.Â  For this reason, the factual circumstances surrounding the enactment of\r\n  Act 153 are irrelevant in deciding whether substantial justification existed\r\n  for the Stateâ€™s and the Retirement Systemâ€™s defense of Act 153â€™s contractual\r\n  validity in the underlying litigation.Â  The circuit judgeâ€™s finding that the Stateâ€™s\r\n  enactment of Act 153 lacked substantial justification was not only completely unrelated\r\n  to the relevant inquiry in this case, it also unnecessarily implicated separation\r\n  of powers principles which recognize that the authority to carry out the legislative\r\n  process rests exclusively with the legislature.Â  Although a court may issue the\r\n  final judgment with regard to the constitutionality or enforceability of a law\r\n  currently in effect, there is no similar judicial authority for reviewing the\r\n  basis for the legislatureâ€™s enactment of a law in the first instance.Â  See\r\n    Keyserling v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 83, 86, 470 S.C. 100, 101 (1996) (&quot;We do\r\n  not sit as a super legislature to second guess the wisdom or folly of decisions\r\n  of the General Assembly.â€).Â  For these reasons, the actions of the General\r\n  Assembly in passing Act 153 into law was an incorrect basis on which to find a\r\n  lack of substantial justification.\r\nThe circuit\r\n  judgeâ€™s finding that the Retirement System should have challenged the enactment\r\n  and enforcement of Act 153 is flawed for similar reasons.Â  On this matter, the\r\n  circuit judge grossly misstated the separation of powers doctrine as it\r\n  operates in our system of government by reasoning that &quot;our system of\r\n  government is a triangle of checks and balances and does not require one branch\r\n  to unwaveringly yield to the directive of another while it waits for the third\r\n  branch to referee in the form of judicial determination.â€ To the contrary, our\r\n  courts have clearly established that under separation of powers principles,\r\n  executive agencies are obligated to comply with the General Assemblyâ€™s\r\n  enactment of a law until it has been otherwise declared invalid.Â Â Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Video Gaming, 358 S.C. at 652, 595 S.E.2d at 892.Â  To imply that the\r\n  Retirement System would have been substantially justified under the state\r\n  action statute had it refused to enforce Act 153 infringes on the legislative\r\n  authority and burdens executive agencies with the duty of making their own\r\n  assessment of legislation while already harboring the responsibility of\r\n  administering legislation.Â  Under our system of government, state agencies are\r\n  not saddled with such burdens, and therefore, this was an incorrect basis on\r\n  which to find a lack of substantial justification.  \r\nFinally,\r\n  the circuit judge reasoned that the continued enforcement of Act 153 had no\r\n  reasonable basis in law or in fact once the Layman circuit court issued\r\n  a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Retirement System from collecting\r\n  further contributions from the named plaintiffs. We find that because the State\r\n  and the Retirement System fully complied with the terms of the temporary\r\n  restraining order (i.e., they stopped collecting further contributions from\r\n  only the named plaintiffs), this was also an improper basis on which to make a\r\n  finding of substantial justification.Â   \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we vacate the circuit judgeâ€™s findings on the issue of\r\n  substantial justification.Â  The circuit judgeâ€™s findings misinterpret the\r\n  existing law and unnecessarily extend the inquiry beyond the issue of whether\r\n  the State and the Retirement System were substantially justified in pressing\r\n  their claim against the TERI plaintiffs.Â  Clarifying the relevant inquiry in\r\n  this matter, we hold that the State and the Retirement System were not\r\n  substantially justified in breaching an unambiguous contract with certain TERI\r\n  participants.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the circuit judge did not err in his\r\n  ultimate conclusion that counsel for the TERI plaintiffs are entitled to\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action statute.Â   \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  awarded\r\nThe remaining issue between\r\n  the parties centers on the circuit judgeâ€™s method of determining a &quot;reasonableâ€\r\n  fee to be awarded under the state action statute.Â  The State and the Retirement\r\n  System argue that the circuit judge erred in basing an award of attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  on a percentage of the TERI participantsâ€™ recovery because it resulted in an\r\n  unreasonably high fee award.Â  In turn, counsel for the TERI plaintiffs argue\r\n  that the circuit judge correctly based the fee on a percentage of the TERI participantsâ€™\r\n  recovery, but chose a percentage that resulted in an unreasonably low award of\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  We agree with the State and the Retirement System that a\r\n  calculation of attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action statute based on a\r\n  percentage of the TERI participantsâ€™ recovery is improper.Â  We further agree\r\n  that under the circumstances of this case, an award of attorneysâ€™ fees totaling\r\n  $8.66 million is unreasonable.  \r\nA.Â Method of calculation\r\nUnder the &quot;American Rule,â€ the\r\n  parties to a lawsuit generally bear the responsibility of paying their own\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  See Pennsylvania v. Del. Valley Citizensâ€™ Council for\r\n    Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546, 561 (1986).Â  This Court and others recognize\r\n  numerous exceptions to this rule, including the award of attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  pursuant to a statute.Â  See Jackson, 326 S.C. at 307, 486 S.E.2d at\r\n  759.Â  A statutory award of attorneysâ€™ fees is typically authorized under what\r\n  is known as a fee-shifting statute, which permits a prevailing party to recover\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees from the losing party.Â  See Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 893 (1984).Â  Neither party disputes that the state action statute applicable here\r\n  is such a fee-shifting statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300\r\n  (providing that a court &quot;may allow the prevailing party to recover reasonable\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to be taxed as court costs against the appropriate agencyâ€).Â \r\n \r\nAnother exception to the\r\n  American Rule recognized by this Court is the award of attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant\r\n  to the common fund doctrine.Â  The common fund doctrine allows a court in its\r\n  equitable jurisdiction to award reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees to a party who, at\r\n  his own expense, successfully maintains a suit for the creation, recovery,\r\n  preservation, or increase of a common fund or common property.Â  Petition of\r\n    Crum Johnson v. Williams, 196 S.C. 528, 531, 14 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1941).Â  Attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees awarded pursuant to the common fund doctrine come directly out of the\r\n  common fund created or preserved.Â  Id.Â  The justification for\r\n  awarding attorneysâ€™ fees in this manner is based on the principle that &quot;one who\r\n  preserves or protects a common fund works for others as well as for himself,\r\n  and the others so benefited should bear their just share of the expenses.â€Â  Id. at 531-32, 14 S.E.2d at 23.Â  \r\n \r\nA key distinction between the\r\n  award of fees authorized by statute and the award of fees from a common fund is\r\n  that the equitable principles underlying the common fund doctrine create a\r\n  mechanism in which attorneysâ€™ fees are not assessed against the losing party by fee-shifting, but rather, are taken directly from the common fund or\r\n  recovery and borne by the prevailing party through fee-spreading.Â  See Burke v. Ariz. State Ret. Syst., 77 P.3d 444, 448 (Ariz. Ct. App.\r\n  2003) (emphasis in original).Â  To reflect this distinction, courts generally hold\r\n  that a &quot;lodestarâ€ approach reflecting the amount of attorney time reasonably\r\n  expended on the litigation results in a reasonable fee under a fee-shifting\r\n  statute.Â  See Blum, 465 U.S. at 900 n.16 (comparing the bases for\r\n  awarding a reasonable attorneysâ€™ fee under the common fund doctrine versus a\r\n  federal fee-shifting statute).Â  Conversely, when awarding fees to be paid from\r\n  a common fund, courts often use the common fund itself as a measure of the\r\n  litigationâ€™s &quot;success.â€Â  These courts consequently base an award of attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees on a percentage of the common fund created, known as the &quot;percentage-of-the-recoveryâ€\r\n  approach.Â  See, e.g., Edmonds v. United States, 658 F.\r\n  Supp. 1126, 1144 (D.S.C. 1987) (expressing a preference for a\r\n  percentage-of-the-recovery method when awarding attorneysâ€™ fees from a common\r\n  fund).[6]Â \r\n  The circuit judge in the instant case utilized the percentage-of-the-recovery\r\n  approach in awarding counsel for TERI plaintiffs $8.66 million in attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees under the state action statute.Â   \r\nCounsel for TERI plaintiffs argue\r\n  that this Courtâ€™s instructions to consider the &quot;benefit to all old TERI\r\n  participantsâ€ in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees make the determination of a\r\n  reasonable award in this case analogous to cases in which attorneysâ€™ fees are\r\n  awarded from a common fund.Â  Therefore, even though the state action statute\r\n  shifts the source of attorneysâ€™ fees to the State, counsel nevertheless urges\r\n  this Court to find that the circuit judge properly awarded attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  based on the percentage-of-the-recovery approach typically utilized when the\r\n  source of attorneysâ€™ fees is spread among the beneficiaries of a common fund.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â Â   \r\nIn\r\n  our view, utilizing common fund methodology when awarding attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  pursuant to a fee-shifting statute is wholly inappropriate in light of the\r\n  underlying theoretical distinction between a common fund source of attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees and a statutory source of attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Although both sources are\r\n  exceptions to the general rule that each party is responsible for the partyâ€™s\r\n  own attorneysâ€™ fees, the common fund doctrine is based on the equitable\r\n  allocation of attorneysâ€™ fees among a benefited group, and not the shifting of\r\n  the attorneysâ€™ fee burden to the losing party.Â  This Court certainly\r\n  acknowledges that a percentage-of-the-recovery approach may be appropriate\r\n  under circumstances in which a court is given jurisdiction over a common fund\r\n  from which it must allocate attorneysâ€™ fees among a benefited group of\r\n  litigants.Â  However, where, as here, a fee-shifting statute shifts the source\r\n  of reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees entirely to the losing party, we find it both illogical\r\n  and erroneous to calculate fees using the methodology justified under a\r\n  fee-spreading theory.Â  See Burke, 77 P.3d 444 (vacating a trial courtâ€™s\r\n  award of $9.6 million in attorneysâ€™ fees based on a percentage of the recovery\r\n  because a settlement agreement in which the state retirement system agreed to\r\n  pay reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees established a fee-shifting as opposed to\r\n  a fee-spreading scenario).  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we note that an award based on a percentage of the TERI plaintiffsâ€™ recovery is\r\n  inconsistent with the express terms of the statutory scheme.Â  Although the state\r\n  action statute neither requires that attorneysâ€™ fees be awarded based on an\r\n  hourly rate, nor places a numerical cap on attorneysâ€™ fees, we find it\r\n  significant that the statute provides that attorneysâ€™ fees assessed to the\r\n  state agency may only be paid &quot;upon presentation of an itemized accounting of\r\n  the attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-330 (2005).Â  In our opinion, the\r\n  requirement of an &quot;itemized accountingâ€ squarely contradicts the utilization of\r\n  the percentage-of-the-recovery method in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees under the\r\n  statute.\r\nWe\r\n  additionally distinguish the instant case from Ex parte Condon, 354 S.C.\r\n  634, 583 S.E.2d 430 (2003), in which this Court approved a circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  award of attorneysâ€™ fees based on a percentage of the recovery in a class\r\n  action case against the State and the South Carolina Department of Revenue on\r\n  behalf of citizens 85 and older who failed to receive the one percent sales tax\r\n  exemption provided for by law.Â  In Condon, the parties reached a\r\n  settlement agreement which stipulated that the circuit court would calculate\r\n  and award attorneysâ€™ fees to be paid by the State to the prevailing plaintiff\r\n  class.Â  Although the agreement established a fee-shifting scenario in this\r\n  regard, the guidelines for determining attorneysâ€™ fees set forth in the\r\n  partiesâ€™ agreement clearly contemplated an award based on a percentage of the\r\n  common fund recovered.Â  Id. at 636-37, 583 S.E.2d at 431.Â  In contrast, the\r\n  state action statute authorizing attorneysâ€™ fees in this case in no way\r\n  suggests that attorneysâ€™ fees should be calculated based on a percentage of the\r\n  common fund recovered.Â  Moreover, the Court in this case specifically rejected\r\n  counsel for TERI plaintiffsâ€™ petition for an award of fees under the common\r\n  fund doctrine, specifying that &quot;attorneyâ€™s fees in this matter should not come\r\n  from the retirement contributions made by the old TERI participants.â€Â \r\n    Layman v. State, S.C. Sup. Ct. Order dated June 1, 2006 (Shearouse Adv. Sh.\r\n  No. 21 at 18).Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that because the state action statute shifts the source of the\r\n  prevailing partyâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees to the losing party, an award of fees based\r\n  on a percentage of the prevailing partyâ€™s recovery is improper.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  circuit judge erred in calculating attorneysâ€™ fees in this manner.Â   \r\nB.&nbsp; &quot;Reasonableâ€ attorneysâ€™ fees under\r\n  the state action statute\r\n1.Â Reasonableness of\r\n  the circuit judgeâ€™s award\r\nOur\r\n  analysis does not end with a determination of the proper method for calculating\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees, however.Â  Regardless of any theoretical preference for one\r\n  method of fee calculation over another, the overriding benchmark for awards of\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees under both the state action statute and the general premise of\r\n  the common fund doctrine is that attorneysâ€™ fees must be &quot;reasonable.â€Â  See Del. Valley Citizensâ€™ Council, 478 U.S. at 562.Â  In light of the\r\n  circumstances of this case, we hold that an award of $8.66 million in\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees is entirely unreasonable.\r\nFrom\r\n  its inception in our original jurisdiction, this Court repeatedly took actions which\r\n  served to narrow the focus of this litigation and minimize the associated costs\r\n  to all involved.Â  In the order granting original jurisdiction, the Court required\r\n  that all contributions made by old TERI participants pursuant to Act 153 must\r\n  be deposited by the Retirement System into an interest-bearing escrow account\r\n  until the Court rendered a final decision.Â  This prophylactic decree, made on\r\n  the Courtâ€™s own motion, acted to preserve the funds at issue with no further\r\n  legal action necessary by either party.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Courtâ€™s order expanded the scope of this mandate for efficiency to the\r\n  sequencing and substance of the case.Â  With no further discovery permitted, the\r\n  Court instructed the parties to agree on the matters to be included in the\r\n  appendix within ten days of the order granting original jurisdiction and set\r\n  forth specific guidelines as to the exact materials to be submitted to the\r\n  Court by each party thereafter.[7]Â \r\n  The Court limited these materials to the partiesâ€™ final briefs and the\r\n  appendix, and specified that the parties would be notified &quot;if the Court finds\r\n  that oral argument is necessary to resolve the issues in this matter.â€Â  The\r\n  Court also provided a specific timeline for submission of materials along with\r\n  the admonition that &quot;[n]o continuances or extensions will be granted absent\r\n  extraordinary circumstances.â€Â  Pursuant to this timeline, the entire process of\r\n  collecting and submitting the necessary documents was to be completed within a\r\n  maximum of eighty days from the Courtâ€™s order.Â  Finally, noting the named TERI\r\n  participantsâ€™ motion for class certification in the trial court, this Court\r\n  ordered that the motion be re-filed in the Court within five days of the\r\n  order.Â   \r\nEven\r\n  after the final judgment in Layman, this Courtâ€™s actions were aimed at\r\n  serving the partiesâ€™ fiscal interests.Â  When the State and the Retirement\r\n  System informed the Court that their records contained all of the information\r\n  necessary to effectuate the return of contributions - already held in escrow\r\n  pursuant to the earlier Court order - to all of the TERI participants subject\r\n  to the Courtâ€™s ruling, the Court decertified the class of TERI plaintiffs.Â  Because\r\n  the relief granted to the named plaintiffs applied to each and every TERI participant\r\n  in the defined class, the Court determined that the Retirement Systemâ€™s assurances\r\n  that it would fully comply with the Courtâ€™s order for relief made the\r\n  time-consuming and costly formality of class notice unnecessary.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  Court rejected counselâ€™s request for attorneysâ€™ fees to be paid out of the\r\n  common fund so that the TERI participants would not ultimately bear the costs\r\n  of litigation associated with enforcing their contract rights with the\r\n  government.Â   \r\nCounsel\r\n  for the TERI plaintiffs claim that their efficient and expeditious efforts\r\n  fully justify an $8.66 million award of attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Counsel claims that their\r\n  good lawyering not only resulted in 100% recovery for the TERI participants,\r\n  but ultimately saved tens of thousands of dollars in attorneysâ€™ fees due to the\r\n  quick result obtained in the case.Â  Although counselâ€™s efforts were certainly\r\n  commendable, counsel is not entitled to sole credit for the overall efficiency\r\n  of the case when it was also counselâ€™s compliance with this Courtâ€™s instructions\r\n  that yielded this judicious result.Â  Â Â \r\nViewing\r\n  the circuit judgeâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees in light of the state action\r\n  statuteâ€™s limitation that attorneysâ€™ fees assessed to a state agency may only\r\n  be paid &quot;upon presentation of an itemized accounting of the attorneyâ€™s fees,â€ S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-330, the circuit judgeâ€™s $8.66 million award results in an\r\n  hourly rate of $6,000 for each attorney and staff member involved in the\r\n  litigation of the case on behalf of the TERI participants.Â  We find this fee\r\n  inconsistent with this Courtâ€™s careful crafting of both the procedural and\r\n  substantive path of this case aimed at minimizing costs for all involved.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we hold that under the circumstances of this case, the circuit judgeâ€™s award of\r\n  $8.66 million in attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to the state action statute was\r\n  unreasonable.\r\n2.\r\n  Calculation of reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees \r\nWe\r\n  turn next to the method of calculating attorneysâ€™ fees in this case, and hold\r\n  that a lodestar analysis is the proper method for determining an award of &quot;reasonableâ€\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action statute.Â  A lodestar figure is designed\r\n  to reflect the reasonable time and effort involved in litigating a case, and is\r\n  calculated by multiplying a reasonable hourly rate by the reasonable time\r\n  expended.Â  See Dennis v. Columbia Colleton Med. Ctr., Inc., 290 F.3d\r\n  639, 652 (4th Cir. 2002).Â  Using this as a starting point for reasonableness, a\r\n  court may consider other factors justifying an enhancement of the lodestar figure\r\n  with a &quot;multiplierâ€ before arriving at a final amount.Â  See Edmonds, 658 F. Supp. at 1148.Â  In our opinion, the lodestar method is particularly\r\n  appropriate in this case because it equally embraces the theory of fee-shifting\r\n  embodied in the state action statute, as well as the notion of efficiency established\r\n  by the Court in the underlying litigation.Â  Accordingly, we proceed with a\r\n  lodestar analysis in order to determine reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees in this case.Â  See also Del. Valley Citizensâ€™ Council, 478 U.S. at 565 (noting the\r\n  strong presumption that the lodestar approach is the most accurate\r\n  determination of reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees in light of the intended purpose of\r\n  the usual fee-shifting statute); Burke, 77 P.3d 444 (finding the\r\n  lodestar calculation to be the appropriate method of awarding reasonable\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees where a settlement agreement established a fee-shifting as\r\n  opposed to a fee-spreading scenario).  \r\nIn\r\n  determining the reasonable time expended and a reasonable hourly rate for purposes\r\n  of calculating attorneysâ€™ fees, South Carolina courts have historically relied\r\n  on six common law factors of reasonableness:Â  (1) the nature, extent, and\r\n  difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the\r\n  professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the\r\n  beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary legal fees for similar\r\n  services.Â  See Jackson, 326 S.C. at 308, 486 S.E.2d at 760.Â Â  In order\r\n  to address the exceptional circumstances of this case, this Court instructed\r\n  the circuit judge in the Layman remand order to give enhanced\r\n  consideration to three of these factors in determining an award of reasonable\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees:Â  specifically, &quot;the actual amount of work performed, expenses\r\n  incurred, and the benefit obtained for all of the old TERI participants.â€Â  Layman\r\n    v. State, S.C. Sup. Ct. Order dated June 1, 2006 (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 21\r\n  at 18).Â  In emphasizing these criteria, this Court intended to remain\r\n  consistent with the theoretical guidelines for awarding fees pursuant to a\r\n  fee-shifting statute, while addressing the equitable implications in awarding\r\n  statutory attorneysâ€™ fees to counsel who, over a relatively brief period of\r\n  time, successfully litigated a claim that yielded 100% recovery for the entire\r\n  class of TERI plaintiffs.Â  We reiterate that it was error for the circuit judge\r\n  to read so far into these equity-based specifications to the point of awarding\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees based on a method commonly associated with an equitable theory (i.e.,\r\n  fee-spreading) that was not in play in this case.\r\na.Â Lodestar\r\n  calculation of attorneysâ€™ fees\r\nBeginning\r\n  with an analysis based on the common law factors of reasonableness, we proceed\r\n  with a lodestar calculation of reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees using the hourly rate\r\n  quotes and time sheets submitted by counsel for TERI plaintiffs.Â  Because\r\n  neither party disputes that the hourly rates submitted by counsel for the TERI\r\n  plaintiffs are reasonable given the professional standing of counsel and the\r\n  nature of the case, the chart below reflects this Courtâ€™s determination that counsel\r\n  for TERI plaintiffsâ€™ current rates constitute a reasonable hourly rate for purposes\r\n  of a lodestar calculation.Â  See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Emp. Res. Mgmt.,\r\n    Inc., 176 F. Supp. 2d 510&nbsp;&nbsp;(D.S.C.\r\n  2001) (explaining that a reasonable hourly rate is determined by comparing the rates of the prevailing partyâ€™s\r\n  attorneys to the prevailing market rates in the community for similar services\r\n  by lawyers of comparable standing).Â  In order to reflect his role as lead\r\n  counsel in class action litigation, the lodestar analysis uses Mr. Lewisâ€™s\r\n  premium hourly rate which he typically reserves for &quot;difficultâ€ cases.Â  Â Â \r\nTurning\r\n  next to the reasonable time spent on the litigation, we first consider that the\r\n  time sheets submitted by counsel for TERI plaintiffs include all of the\r\n  hours spent on the litigation of the case (designated in the chart below as\r\n  &quot;Total Hours Expendedâ€), with no distinction between time associated with the TERI\r\n  participantsâ€™ claims giving rise to the instant case, and time associated with the\r\n  Working Retireesâ€™ claims, which were remanded.Â  Although the record indicates\r\n  that Working Retirees constituted roughly one-third of the class of plaintiffs\r\n  in Layman, we do not find it necessary to adjust the total hours\r\n  expended by this proportion in order to arrive at a reasonable fee in this\r\n  case.Â  Not only were the same legal theories advanced on behalf of both the\r\n  TERI participants and the Working Retirees, making their claims virtually indistinguishable,\r\n  but more importantly, guiding jurisprudence explicitly holds that &quot;a party need\r\n  not be successful as to all issues in order to be found to be a prevailing\r\n  partyâ€ for purposes of awarding attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action statute.[8]Â  Heath, 302 S.C. at 182, 394 S.E.2d at 711.Â  Only in an abundance of\r\n  caution, however, do we reduce the number of total hours expended by three\r\n  percent (3%), rounded down to the nearest tenth, in order to account for any\r\n  time devoted solely to the Working Retireesâ€™ claims, thereby arriving at what\r\n  we view as a &quot;reasonableâ€ number of hours expended on the TERI participantsâ€™\r\n  claims (appearing as &quot;Net Hours Expendedâ€ in the chart below).Â  See Edmonds,\r\n  658 F. Supp. at 1135 n.18, 1147 n.44 (performing a lodestar analysis and\r\n  adjusting the time devoted to litigating the underlying case by two to three\r\n  percent in order to account for the fact that &quot;some hours may not be properly\r\n  compensableâ€).Â   \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the Court calculates the lodestar fee in this case as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    Total Hours Expended\r\n    Net Hours Expended\r\n    Hourly Rate\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    Totals\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Lewis &amp; Babcock\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.

Eckerhart, 461\r\n  U.S. 424 (1983))).Â  More specifically, we find that the expedited litigation timeline\r\n  imposed by the Court, the wholly successful recovery for the entire class of\r\n  TERI participants, the extraordinary sum of money returned to the TERI\r\n  participants and ultimately saved by the TERI participants, and the termination\r\n  of governmental acts constituting a breach of contract are exceptional\r\n  circumstances which justify the use of a multiplier.Â  Accordingly, we apply a\r\n  multiplier of 1.25 to the lodestar calculation in order to arrive at a\r\n  reasonable fee that adequately compensates counsel for the TERI plaintiffs.[9]Â \r\n  To this total, we add the expenses incurred by counsel for the TERI plaintiffs,\r\n  which this Court directed the circuit judge to include in the award of\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees, even though the state action statute does not mandate such\r\n  reimbursement.[10]Â \r\n    See also Hyatt v. Apfel, 195 F.3d 188, 192 (4th Cir. 1999) (affirming a\r\n  multiplier of 1.333 applied to a lodestar calculation of attorneysâ€™ fees to be\r\n  paid by the defendant government entity on account of the &quot;exceptional resultsâ€\r\n  obtained by plaintiffsâ€™ counsel); Edmonds, 658 F. Supp. at 1148\r\n  (applying a multiplier of 1.15 to 1.25 to the lodestar fees for the plaintiffsâ€™\r\n  various attorneys to account for the &quot;exceptional circumstancesâ€ surrounding\r\n  the amount of money involved and the results obtained in the case).Â   \r\nAdjusting\r\n  the lodestar calculation to reflect the exceptional circumstances of this case\r\n  emphasized by this Court in the remand order, we calculate a reasonable\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fee as follows: Â Â \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Lodestar base calculation\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    $352,402.00\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Multiplier  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    x 1.25\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Subtotal\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    Â Â  $440,502.50 \r\n\t \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Add expenses incurred\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    + 4,724.10\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    TOTAL ENHANCED LODESTAR\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    $445,226.60\r\n  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold that an\r\n  enhanced lodestar figure equaling $445,226.60 constitutes a reasonable\r\n  award of attorneysâ€™ fees to counsel for TERI plaintiffs under the state action\r\n  statute.\r\nC.Â Summary of attorneysâ€™ fee calculation\r\nThe\r\n  following summarizes our resolution of this appeal arising from the Courtâ€™s\r\n  remand of Layman to the circuit judge for a determination of reasonable\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  We hold that the circuit judgeâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  using the percentage-of-the-recovery method was improper and resulted in an\r\n  award that was unreasonable under the state action statute.Â  Â We therefore\r\n  vacate the award of $8.66 million to counsel for TERI plaintiffs and further\r\n  hold that a reasonable award of attorneysâ€™ fees in this case is properly\r\n  calculated using the lodestar method, enhanced by a multiplier and the addition\r\n  of counselâ€™s expenses to reflect &quot;the actual amount of work performed, expenses\r\n  incurred, and the benefit obtained for all of the old TERI participants.â€Â  Based\r\n  on a calculation representative of this conclusion, we assess reasonable\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees in the amount of $445,226.60 against the State and the\r\n  Retirement System.Â   \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  affirm the circuit judgeâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action\r\n  statute, but modify the courtâ€™s award of fees using a lodestar calculation and\r\n  an appropriate multiplier.\r\nMOORE, BEATTY, JJ.,\r\n  and Acting Justices E. C. Burnett, III and Â Thomas W. Cooper, Jr.,\r\n    concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Act No. 153, 2005 S.C. Acts 1697.\r\n[2] The TERI program is codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-2210 et. seq. (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  The Working Retiree program is codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  9-1-1790 (Supp. 2006).\r\n[3] As to the Working Retireesâ€™ claims, the Court determined that the terms of the\r\n  Working Retiree statute did not create a contract between the State and the\r\n  Working Retirees.Â  For this reason, the Court remanded the Working Retireesâ€™\r\n  claims for a case-by-case factual determination as to whether the State had\r\n  entered into individual written contracts with the Working Retirees which may\r\n  have been breached by enforcement of Act 153.Â  Layman, 368 S.C. at 643, 630\r\n  S.E.2d at 271-72.Â Â  Therefore, attorneysâ€™ fees on behalf of Working Retirees\r\n  are not at issue here.\r\n[4] The &quot;expenses incurredâ€ totaled $4,724.10.Â  This figure represents an\r\n  accounting of counsel for the TERI plaintiffsâ€™ actual expenses in litigating Layman.Â \r\n  The circuit judge defined the &quot;immediate benefitâ€ as the contributions to the\r\n  Retirement System that this Court ordered be immediately returned to the old\r\n  TERI participants following the opinion in Layman.Â  These contributions\r\n  totaled $37,812,255.60.Â  The circuit judge defined the &quot;future benefitâ€ as the\r\n  income stream that would have been created by contributions of the old TERI\r\n  participants had Act 153 continued to be enforced, discounted to present day\r\n  value.Â  This amount totaled approximately $72 million.\r\n[5] In fact, Act 153 as it applies to TERI participants joining the program after the\r\n  Actâ€™s effective date is still the law in South Carolina.Â   \r\n[6] Meanwhile, a number of state courts have recently ruled that lower courts have\r\n  discretion in deciding whether to calculate awards from a common fund using a\r\n  percentage-of-the-recovery approach or the lodestar method.Â  See City of Birmingham v. Horn, 810 So. 2d 667 (Ala. 2001); Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of the\r\n    Employeesâ€™ Ret. Syst. of the State of Haw., 992 P.2d 127 (Haw. 2000).Â  \r\n \r\n[7] The Court also specified that if the parties could not agree, all matters\r\n  designated by both parties would be included in the appendix without prejudice\r\n  to the right of the TERI plaintiffs to move for costs pursuant to Rule 222(c),\r\n  SCACR, for printing irrelevant matter.  \r\n[8] In fact, we cannot characterize the Working Retireesâ€™ claims as unsuccessful at\r\n  this point, as these claims have simply been remanded for further\r\n  consideration.  \r\n[9] The award of reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees under the state action statute is in\r\n  the Courtâ€™s discretion and there are numerous ways for the Court to arrive at\r\n  this reasonable fee when applying a multiplier.Â  In choosing the multiplier to\r\n  be applied in the instant case, we find the following observation instructive.\r\nUnless the court knows beforehand\r\n  precisely what this reasonable value should be, the selection of an appropriate multiplier must follow essentially a trial\r\n  and error course. If the use of one multiplier over another results in\r\n  what the court feels is an unreasonably high or low fee, then the multiplier must be\r\n  adjusted to comport with the courtâ€™s perception of the proper fee award under\r\n  the circumstances.Â   \r\nIn re Chicken Antitrust Litigation, 560 F.\r\n  Supp. 963, 995 (N.D. Ga. 1980); see also Edmonds, 658 F.\r\n  Supp. at 1149.Â   \r\n[10] Any attempt to characterize the expenses incurred as being related to the TERI\r\n  participantsâ€™ claims or the Working Retireesâ€™ claims would, in our opinion, be\r\n  an exercise in futility.Â  Because of the unified nature of these claims, and\r\n  because the expenses incurred are relatively insignificant, we include them in\r\n  their entirety in the calculation of reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
