Reibold, of Walker &amp; Reibold, of Columbia, for Bridgewood Homes, Inc., Amicus Curiae.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  We accepted this declaratory judgment matter in our original jurisdiction, pursuant to In re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules Proposed by the South Carolina Bar, 309 S.C. 304, 422 S.E.2d 123 (1992), to determine if respondent has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  We also granted a motion for leave to file an amicus brief filed by Bridgewood Homes, Inc.Â  The matter was referred to a Special Referee, by order dated May 17, 2005, to take evidence and issue a report containing proposed findings of fact and recommendations to the Court.\r\n\r\nThe Special Referee issued a Report of Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law recommending this Court find respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Thereafter, respondent was the only party to file exceptions to the Report.Â  A schedule for serving and filing the briefs and record in this matter was established.Â  However, respondent failed to serve and file a record or brief as instructed.Â \r\n \r\nRule 208(a)(4), SCACR, states that if an appellant fails to file a brief, the appeal will be dismissed.Â  Because respondent is the party objecting to the Special Refereeâ€™s report by way of exceptions, and was instructed to serve and file the record and a brief addressing the exceptions, he is in the posture of an appellant.Â  Accordingly, because he has failed to file a brief in the matter, we hereby dismiss his exceptions and, because we agree that respondent has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, we adopt the following Report of the Special Referee as the opinion of this Court.\r\n \r\nSPECIAL REFEREEâ€™S REPORT OF PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\nThis case was filed in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of South Carolina.Â  The Court appointed me as a special referee to take evidence and issue a report containing proposed findings of fact and recommendations concerning Petitionerâ€™s allegations that the Respondent has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Petitionerâ€™s Allegations\r\nThe allegations turn on a document titled â€œNotice of Assignment and Assignment of Judgment,â€ which Petitioner contends is essentially a contingency fee agreement for legal services, in which Respondent agreed to attempt to collect a judgment in exchange for a fee of approximately one-third.Â  Petitioner contends that, under the terms of this agreement, Respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in attempting to collect the judgment.Â \r\n \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Proposed Findings of Fact\r\nOn January 3, 1996, Paul W. Nickoson[] obtained a judgment in the amount of $7587.67 against Eddie Roberts, d/b/a Eddie Roberts Auto Service.Â  Respondent approached Nickoson about attempting to collect this judgment.[1]Â  On August 17, 2004, Nickoson and Respondent executed a document entitled â€œNotice of Assignment and Assignment of Judgment.â€Â  The document provides in important part:\r\n\r\n\tI, Paul W. Nickoson, Judgment Creditor in the above entitled actions, (hereinafter â€œAssignorâ€), do hereby transfer, assign and setover the Judgment rendered to me in this action to REFUNDS PLUS . . . (hereinafter â€œAssigneeâ€) in exchange for a retention of a (66.6%) interest in the amount recovered by Assignee.\r\n\t***\r\n\tAssignee, itâ€™s agents, assigns and successors shall have full authority to settle, compromise and enforce said Judgment, and Assignor withdraws all right to same.\r\n\r\n(Reference to exhibits omitted).\r\nOn August 27, 2004, Respondent began the process of execution of the judgment by having the Richland County Clerk of Court command the Sheriff of Richland County to satisfy the judgment out of the personal or real property of Roberts. . . .Â  Respondent signed the Execution Against Property as â€œPlaintiffâ€™s Attorneys.â€\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 2004, Respondent wrote a letter to Roberts explaining that he was going to begin efforts to collect the judgment that he claimed had been â€œassignedâ€ to him.Â  (Reference to exhibit omitted).Â  In this letter, Respondent explains the manner in which he planned to collect the judgment, including the manner in which he planned to use the judicial process.Â  Specifically, Respondent stated his intention to file an action in the â€œMaster-in-Equity Court to Order you to appear with your . . . financial records . . . and testify under oath . . . .â€Â  Respondent offered several legal opinions in the letter, including that a corporation Roberts apparently owned â€œwould be held jointly and severably liable for this debt.â€Â  He also made several threats about consequences Roberts would face if he did not cooperate and willingly satisfy the judgment.[2]Â   \r\nOn September 17, 2004, Respondent served â€œPlaintiffâ€™s Request for Production of Documentsâ€ on Roberts, with an attached â€œExhibit Aâ€ listing seventeen categories of documents Roberts was required to produce.Â  (Reference to exhibit omitted).Â  Respondent amended the Request for Production on September 18, 2004.Â  (Reference to exhibit omitted).Â  On September 29, 2004, Respondent again wrote Roberts making additional threats about how he would use the judicial process and the consequences Roberts would face if he did not pay the judgment.Â  (Reference to exhibit omitted).\r\nOn February 8, 2005, Respondent filed a â€œNotice of Motion and Motion for Supplementary Proceedings.â€Â  (Reference to exhibit omitted).Â  This motion resulted in an â€œOrder of Reference and Rule to Show Causeâ€ signed on February 15, requiring Roberts to attend a hearing and bring all his financial records.Â  The Honorable Joseph Strickland, Master in Equity for Richland County, held a hearing sometime later and Respondent personally appeared as the representative of the judgment holder.Â  Finally, on February 28, 2005, Respondent wrote Roberts again threatening consequences of not claiming mail sent to Roberts, and threatening to â€œhave you ARRESTED and brought to court in restraints the way Moses was brought before Pharoah in the movie, â€˜The Ten commandments.â€™â€\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Applicable Law\r\nâ€œThe generally understood definition of the practice of law embraces the preparation of pleadings, and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings, and the management of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts.â€Â  Brown v. Coe, 365 S.C. 137, 139, 616 S.E.2d 705, 706-07 (2005)(citing Doe v. McMaster, 355 S.C. 306, 311, 585 S.E.2d 773, 775-77 (2003); State v. Despain, 319 S.C. 317, 319 460 S.E.2d 576, 577 (1995); In re Duncan, 83 S.C. 186, 189, 65 S.E. 210, 211 (1909)).Â  â€œThe practice of law â€˜is not confined to litigation, but extends to activities in other fields which entail specialized legal knowledge and ability.â€™â€Â  Linder v. Insurance Claims Consultants, Inc., 348 S.C. 477, 487, 560 S.E.2d 612, 617 (2002) (quoting State v. Buyers Services Co., Inc., 292 S.C. 426, 430, 357 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1987)).Â  Other than these general statements, there is no comprehensive definition of the practice of law.Â  See Linder, 348 S.C. at 487, 560 S.E.2d at 617-18.Â  Rather, what constitutes the practice of law must be decided on the facts and in the context of each individual case.\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â  Proposed Conclusions of Law\r\nThe â€œNotice of Assignment and Assignment of Judgmentâ€ is not an assignment of the judgment as it purports to be.Â  The original judgment holder retained an ownership interest in the judgment.Â  Respondent gained an interest that had value only on the successful collection of some portion of it.Â  Respondent paid nothing for the interest he acquired.Â  He was to be paid, if at all, only when the judgment was collected.Â  The practical effect of their agreement is that Respondent was to be paid a fee to collect the debt.Â  Therefore, the supposed â€œassignee,â€ Respondent, was not acting entirely on his own behalf, but on behalf of the original judgment holder.Â  Respondent could not have been practicing law if he had been acting on his own behalf under a true assignment.Â  However, because he was acting on behalf of the original judgment holder, his actions must be examined to determine whether they constitute the practice of law.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent did many things on behalf of the judgment holder in the collection of this debt that meet the general definition of the practice of law.Â  He prepared â€œpleadings, and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings.â€Â  See Brown, 365 S.C. at 139, 616 S.E.2d at 706-07.Â  These include â€œPlaintiffâ€™s Request for Production of Documents,â€ the â€œNotice of Motion and Motion for Supplementary Proceedings,â€ and the â€œExecution Against Judgment.â€\r\nRespondent also managed the collection action â€œon behalf of [the judgment holder] before judges and courts.â€Â  \r\nSee Id.&nbsp; For example, Respondent prepared â€œExecution Against Judgmentâ€ \r\nand had it signed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court directing the Sheriff to \r\nsatisfy the judgment.&nbsp; His â€œmanagementâ€ activities also include serving the \r\nRequest for Production on Roberts, and filing the Motion he prepared in the \r\nEquity Division of the Circuit Court.&nbsp; He used the â€œMotionâ€ to obtain an \r\nâ€œOrder of Reference and Rule to Show Cause.â€&nbsp; Most importantly, he appeared \r\nat a hearing before the Equity Division on behalf of the judgment holder.\r\nIn addition, Respondent developed a strategy to use in collecting the debt for Nickoson.Â  In furtherance of this strategy, he sent letters to Roberts that were designed to induce him to pay the judgment.Â  Some of these letters contained legal opinions formulated by Respondent.Â  This is the type of strategic activity which the Supreme Court referred to in Linder as entailing â€œspecialized legal knowledge and ability.â€Â  348 S.C. at 487, 560 S.E.2d at 617.\r\nFinally, in determining whether someone is practicing law, it is important to consider representations the person makes about his own activity.Â  As mentioned above, Respondent represented on the signature line of the â€œExecution Against Judgmentâ€ that he was acting as â€œPlaintiffâ€™s Attorneys.â€Â  Despite the fact that this language appears to be part of the printed form Respondent was using, by signing the form as he did, Respondent made a public statement as to the role he was playing in collecting the judgment.Â  The use of this language in a document being served on a judgment debtor is reasonably understood to increase the chances of collecting the debt.\r\nOther states have considered whether similar activity constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.Â  In Iowa Supreme Court Commâ€™n on Unauthorized Practice of Law v. A-1 Assocs, Ltd., 623 N.W.2d 803 (2001), the Supreme Court of Iowa concluded that an instrument similar to the â€œNotice of Assignment and Assignment of Judgmentâ€ used by Respondent was not in fact an assignment of a judgment, but was an agreement for collection services such as a lawyer would perform.Â  The court noted that if the instrument truly had been an assignment, then the assignee could have attempted to collect the judgment without engaging in the practice of law.Â  The court went on to state â€œA-1â€™s claimed status as a bona fide assignee is defeated under this record, however, because the assignment - though absolute in form - is, in fact, a transfer intended primarily to secure payment for services rendered.Â  (citation omitted).Â  This is demonstrated by the fact that A-1 pays nothing for the purported â€˜assignment.â€™ . . .Â  Courts throughout the country have condemned this practice as an attempt by collection agencies to accomplish indirectly what the law otherwise prohibits.â€Â  (citation omitted).Â  623 N.W.2d at 808.Â  The court concluded that A-1 Associated, Ltd. had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  â€œSo long as A-1 is not representing its own legal interests . . ., but the legal interests of others, it is engaging - without license or other authorization - in the practice of law.â€Â  623 N.W.2d at 808-09.\r\nIn State ex rel. State Bar of Wisconsin v. Bonded Collections, Inc., 36 Wis.2d 643, 154 N.W.2d 250 (1967),[3] the Supreme Court of Wisconsin considered the following issue:Â  â€œDoes a course of conduct whereby a collection agency takes assignments of accounts for collection, . . ., brings suit in its own name, and then pursuant to a prior agreement deducts from the proceeds, costs, and a fixed percentage as its fee and remits the balance to the creditor, constitute the unauthorized practice of law?â€Â  154 N.W.2d at 253-54.Â  In concluding that it does, the court stated â€œ[i]t is sheer hypocrisy to conclude that the percentage retained by the collection agency represents its equity or ownership share of the claim.Â  It is its fee or charge for professional services rendered.â€Â  154 N.W.2d at 256.Â  The Wisconsin court also noted that â€œ[t]he collection agency by going into court representing itself as the client perpetrates a fraud on the court.â€Â  Id.\r\nSee also State ex rel. Norvell v. Credit Bureau of Albuquerque, Inc., 85 N.M. 521, 514 P.2d 40, 49 (1973) (assignments procured by credit bureau not truly taken to acquire title and ownership but to facilitate delivery of legal services for consideration constitute unauthorized practice of law); State ex rel. Frieson v. Isner, 168 W.Va.758, 285 S.E.2d 641, 651-52 (1981) (citing numerous cases to support conclusion that assignment taken solely to maintain suit on creditorâ€™s claim is sham perpetrated on court to enable unauthorized practice of law).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude respondentâ€™s actions, as outlined in this matter, constitute the unauthorized practice of law.\r\nJUDGMENT DECLARED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] It was not possible for the Special Referee to determine the precise manner in which Respondent solicited the opportunity to collect this judgment, because Respondent chose not to show up for the hearing.Â  However, it is clear from the evidence that was presented that respondent solicited the business of collecting this and other judgments.Â  This evidence includes the fact that Respondent operated under the business name of Refunds Plus.\r\n[2] Many of these threats are entirely inappropriate, and would violate the Rules of Professional Conduct if made by a lawyer.Â  However, this aspect of Respondentâ€™s conduct is not before me.\r\n[3] In this case, the collection agency actually hired a lawyer to represent it in court.Â  The basis of the courtâ€™s decision, however, was that the collection agency was practicing law by representing the creditor, and the fact that the agency hired a lawyer to do so did not change that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26377","title":"Callahan v.

Harvey, III, of Harvey &amp; Battey, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â Â Â Â Â Â  This is a workersâ€™ compensation appeal.Â  The single commissioner denied workersâ€™ compensation benefits due to the claimantâ€™s failure to provide notice of her third-party suit as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(b) (1985).Â  The full commission affirmed, and claimant appealed to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court reversed, holding that the lack of notice had not prevented the â€œequitable adjustment of the rights of all the partiesâ€ because the third-party suit never reached a final determination on the merits.Â  Beaufort County School District (â€œEmployerâ€) appealed, and we certified the appeal pursuant to Rule 204, SCACR.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nChristine Callahan (â€œClaimantâ€) alleged injuries due to exposure to chemicals at Battery Creek High School on November 14, 2002.Â  Employer and the South Carolina School Boards Insurance Trust (â€œCarrierâ€) denied workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  Claimant filed a Form 50 on January 17, 2003, to request a hearing.\r\nOn January 24, 2003, Claimant filed a civil action against a third-party, Tech Clean Industries, based on the same injuries alleged in the workersâ€™ compensation action.Â  However, it was not until July 16, 2003, that the Claimant filed and served a Form S-2, providing the Commission, Employer, and Carrier with notice of her intent to pursue both a workersâ€™ compensation claim and a third-party civil action for the same injuries.Â  Claimant voluntarily dismissed the third-party action without prejudice in November 2003.[1]\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court err by failing to find Claimantâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim is barred because she did not provide notice of her third-party action within thirty days of its commencement, in accordance with the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(b)?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nReview of a decision of the workersâ€™ compensation commission is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â  We may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(d) (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\n \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560 sets forth the requirements for simultaneously pursuing a third-party action and a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  The statute provides:\r\n\r\n\tNotice of the commencement of the [third-party] action shall be given within thirty days thereafter to the [Commission], the employer and carrier upon a form prescribed by the [Commission].\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(b).Â  An injured party may proceed against both the employer-carrier and against a third-party tortfeasor by complying with the requirements of Â§ 42-1-560.Â  Fisher v. S.C. Dept. of Mental Retardation-Coastal Center, 277 S.C. 573, 575, 291 S.E.2d 200, 201 (1982); Hudson v. Townsend Saw Chain Co., 296 S.C. 17, 20, 370 S.E.2d 104, 106 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œ[subsection (b)] plainly requires an employee, when he or she brings a third-party action, to give notice to the Commission, the employer, and the employerâ€™s carrier of the commencement of the third-party action within 30 days of its commencement.â€).\r\nIn this case, Claimant did not provide the Form S-2 to the Commission, Employer, and Carrier until July 2003, nearly six months after she initially filed her third-party suit and three months after the action had been removed to federal court.Â \r\n \r\nBecause workersâ€™ compensation statutes provide an exclusive compensatory system in derogation of common law rights, we strictly construe the requirements of Â§ 42-1-560 and leave it to the legislature to amend and define its ambiguities.Â  Cf. Wigfall v. Tideland Util., Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 110, 580 S.E.2d 100, 105 (2003).Â  Here, the statute clearly requires timely notice to be given to all three entities- employer, carrier, and Commission- on the Form S-2.[2]\r\nWe find the circuit court erred by excusing compliance with the statute based on the â€œequitable adjustment of the rights of all the parties.â€Â  Even though the employer had not lost its right of subrogation against the potentially responsible third-party, the statutory provision mandates notice to the employer, carrier, and Commission within thirty days of filing the third-party suit.Â  It was improper for the circuit court to conduct an equity analysis to carve an exception to the workersâ€™ compensation notice requirement.Â  See Wigfall, supra; Santee Cooper Resort, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commn, 298 S.C. 179, 185, 379 S.E.2d 119, 123 (1989) (holding that a courtâ€™s equitable powers must yield in the face of an unambiguously worded statute).\r\nDespite Claimantâ€™s failure to comply with Â§ 42-1-560, we nonetheless affirm the circuit courtâ€™s finding that her workersâ€™ compensation claim may proceed.Â  In this case, Claimant voluntarily dismissed her third-party suit pursuant to Rule 41, FRCP.Â  A voluntary dismissal leaves the situation as though no suit had ever been filed.Â  9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure 2d Â§ 2367, at 321 (1995); Allen v. S. Ry. Co., 218 S.C. 291, 297-298, 62 S.E.2d 507, 511 (1950).Â  Following this rule, the third-party suit originally filed in January 2003 became a nullity, and Â§ 42-1-560 is not applicable.Â  As a result, there is no violation of Â§ 42-1-560 when the third-party suit is treated as never being filed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that Â§ 42-1-560(b) must be strictly followed in order for a claimant to preserve her right to proceed against both an employer and a third-party.Â  On the facts before us, Claimantâ€™s voluntary dismissal without prejudice of her third-party suit allows her to proceed with her workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice R. Ferrell Cothran, Jr., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n[1] Although it is unclear from the record whether Claimant re-filed the third-party action, the Court was made aware at oral argument that Claimant later re-filed the third-party action against Tech Clean.Â  We offer no opinion on the efficacy of this re-filing.\r\n[2] This holding does not conflict with our past cases.Â  This Court previously held that a claimant had elected a remedy, thus forgoing workersâ€™ compensation benefits, by settling a third-party claim without complying with the notice requirements of Â§ 42-1-560, even though the carrier had actual knowledge of the third-party suit.Â  Fisher, supra; see also Hardee v. Bruce Johnson Trucking Co., 293 S.C. 349, 354-355, 360 S.E.2d 522, 525 (Ct. App. 1987)(discussing the facts of Fisher).Â  Additionally, prior cases interpreting this statute have found that prejudice should not be considered.Â  See Hudson, supra (finding claimantâ€™s prejudice argument â€œunpersuasive, if in fact the question of prejudice is relevant at allâ€)(citing Stroy v. Millwood Drug Store, 235 S.C. 52, 109 S.E.2d 706 (1959)); Kimmer v. Murata, 372 S.C. 39, 640 S.E.2d 507 (Ct. App. 2006)(holding that â€œprejudice is â€˜NOTâ€™ an element to be considered in regard to the failure to give mandated statutory notice.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26378","title":"In the Matter of McBee, Bethune, and Lynchburg Municipal Court Judge Fred D.

Tetterton, of Camden, for respondent.Â Â   \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this judicial disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to the imposition of a public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE,\r\n  Rule 502, SCACR.[1]Â \r\nThe facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 14, 2006, while serving as\r\n  a judge for the Town of McBee, respondent was indicted by the State Grand Jury\r\n  of South Carolina on the charge of common law misconduct in office.Â  The McBee\r\n  Chief of Police was also indicted on the same offense.Â  According to the\r\n  indictment, respondent and the Chief of Police assisted certain persons charged\r\n  with crimes in avoiding prosecution by coercing them to surrender money and\r\n  property to the Town of McBee in exchange for having criminal charges against\r\n  them dismissed.Â  On June 16, 2006, the Court placed respondent on interim\r\n  suspension.Â   \r\nOn March 30, 2007, respondent pled\r\n  guilty to the indicted offense and was sentenced to five (5) years\r\n  imprisonment, suspended to ninety (90) days incarceration and three (3) years\r\n  of probation. Â On June 27, 2007, respondent tendered his resignation as\r\n  municipal court judge for the towns of McBee, Bethune, and Lynchburg.Â   \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he\r\n  has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501,\r\n  SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold the integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A\r\n  (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high\r\n  standards of conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the\r\n  integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge\r\n  shall avoid impropriety and appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon\r\n  2(A) (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in\r\n  a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of\r\n  the judiciary); Canon 3 (judge shall\r\n    perform duties of judicial office impartially); and Canon 3B(2) (judge shall be\r\n    faithful to the law).Â  Respondent also admits he has violated Rule 7(a)(1) (it\r\n    shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial\r\n    Conduct), Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to be\r\n    convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or a serious crime), and Rule 7(a)(9)\r\n    (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Oath of Office) of\r\n    the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\t\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent shall neither seek nor accept\r\n  any judicial position in this State without the prior written authorization of\r\n  this Court after due service on ODC of any petition\r\n  seeking the Courtâ€™s authorization.Â  Respondent is hereby reprimanded for\r\n  his misconduct.Â   \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and\r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  BEATTY, J., not participating.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] While this matter was pending, respondent resigned as\r\n  municipal court judge for the towns of McBee, Bethune, and Lynchburg.Â \r\n  Accordingly, a public reprimand is the most severe sanction the Court can\r\n  impose when a judge no longer holds judicial office.Â  See In re\r\n    Oâ€™Kelley, 361 S.C. 30, 603 S.E.2d 410 (2004); In re Gravely, 321\r\n  S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26379","title":"State v.

Â Although\r\n  this property was not Appellantâ€™s primary residence, he occasionally slept in a\r\n  house located on the property.Â  Appellant visited the property every day, and\r\n  sometimes more than once a day, to maintain the property and to feed several pet\r\n  cats Appellant kept there.Â   \r\nBetween\r\n  March and August 2004, Appellant experienced continuous problems with\r\n  trespassers on his property.Â  According to the record, these trespassers not\r\n  only entered Appellantâ€™s property, damaged the premises, and stole Appellantâ€™s\r\n  equipment, the trespassers also made a sport of shooting (and killing) Appellantâ€™s\r\n  pet cats.Â  According to Appellant, he phoned the police on several separate\r\n  occasions after discovering that trespassers had been on his property, but he\r\n  was told that the police â€œdid not need to respond to cat-killing reports.â€\r\nAccording\r\n  to the record, one of the primary trespassers was Appellantâ€™s neighbor.Â  On the\r\n  day of the incident which is the subject of the instant case, the neighbor, a\r\n  friend, and the deceased (an off-duty county police deputy), took firearms onto\r\n  Appellantâ€™s property and engaged in more of the violent activity we have\r\n  described.Â  After shooting for some time, the three trespassers returned to the\r\n  neighborâ€™s residence to reload.Â  After accomplishing this, the neighbor and the\r\n  deceased ventured back onto Appellantâ€™s property.\r\nAccording\r\n  to Appellant, he went onto his property at some point during this time period,\r\n  saw a dead cat by the front steps of his house, and observed footprints around\r\n  the house.Â  Appellant alleges that he went to his cousinâ€™s house, phoned the\r\n  police, and went back to his driveway to await the policeâ€™s arrival.Â  Appellant\r\n  alleges that he then heard a gunshot on his property.Â  At that point, Appellant\r\n  grabbed his rifle from his vehicle and ran towards his house.\r\nAppellant\r\n  and the neighbor gave conflicting testimony at trial regarding the\r\n  circumstances surrounding the shooting of the deceased.Â  According to\r\n  Appellant, he approached the house, heard additional gunshots around him, and then\r\n  saw the deceased charging at him in a slouching position with his rifle.Â  Appellant\r\n  asserted that no words passed between the men, but that the men immediately exchanged\r\n  gunfire.Â  Appellant testified that after firing four shots at the deceased,\r\n  Appellant ran from his property.\r\nAccording to the neighbor, when he and the deceased returned from\r\n  reloading their weapons, Appellant came around a corner on the property with\r\n  his weapon raised.Â  The neighbor testified that Appellant confronted the\r\n  deceased, and that upon being confronted, the deceased held his gun by the\r\n  handle to put the gun on the ground, requested that Appellant not shoot, and\r\n  raised one of his arms.Â  The neighbor testified that as the deceased kneeled to\r\n  put down the gun, Appellant shot the deceased multiple times.\r\nA jury\r\n  convicted Appellant of murder, and this appeal followed.Â  We certified the case\r\n  for review from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and\r\n  Appellant purports to present a total of eight issues for our review.Â  Exercising\r\n  our prerogative to decide only those questions that are necessary to the\r\n  resolution of a case, we find that only one issue requires discussion:\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in refusing to charge Appellantâ€™s proposed\r\n    charge on the defense of habitation?\r\n\r\nStandard of\r\n  Review\r\nA trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury charges will not be\r\n  reversed where the charges, as a whole, properly charged the law to be\r\n  applied.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 263, 565 S.E.2d 298, 304\r\n  (2002).Â  Conversely, where a defendant requests a charge on a defense that is\r\n  supported by the evidence presented at trial, the trial court is required to\r\n  charge the jury on that defense, and the failure to do so is reversible error.Â  State v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, 416-17, 535 S.E.2d 431, 434 (2000).Â  \r\n \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court erred by incorrectly charging the jury as to the\r\n  defense of habitation.Â  We agree.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Appellant sought to make use of two defenses: self-defense and the\r\n  defense of habitation.Â  While charging\r\n  the jury on the law of habitation, the trial court properly stated that the law\r\n  recognizes the right of every person to defend his or her premises, but\r\n  differentiated habitation from self-defense with the sole caveat that â€œ[a]\r\n  person defending his or her home or premises . . . has no duty to retreat.â€Â \r\n  Though this was most of the picture, it was not the complete picture.Â   \r\nIn\r\n  this case, it was important for the jury to fully understand exactly what\r\n  â€œdefending oneâ€™s home or premisesâ€ meant.Â  As the defense of habitation\r\n  provides, defending oneâ€™s home or premises means ending an unwarranted\r\n  intrusion through the use of reasonably necessary means of ejection.Â  State\r\n  v. Bradley, 126 S.C. 528, 533, 120 S.E. 240, 242 (1923).Â  By instructing\r\n  that â€œ[t]he same elements required by law to establish self-defense apply to\r\n  the defense of habitation, with the exception of the duty to retreat,â€ the\r\n  charges in the instant case incorrectly implied that habitation requires a\r\n  defendant to establish that his person or property was in some danger of injury\r\n  or harm.[1]\r\nFor\r\n  the defense of habitation to apply, a defendant need only establish that a\r\n  trespass has occurred and that his chosen means of ejectment were reasonable\r\n  under the circumstances.Â  Bradley, 126 S.C. at 533, 120 S.E. at 242.Â  Stated\r\n  differently, unlike the defense of self-defense, the defense of habitation does\r\n  not require that a defendant reasonably believe that he (or his property) was\r\n  in imminent danger sustaining serious injury or damage.Â  Instead, the defense\r\n  of habitation provides that where one attempts to force himself into anotherâ€™s\r\n  dwelling, the law permits an owner to use reasonable force to expel the\r\n  trespasser.Â  Although our precedents properly recognize that self-defense and\r\n  habitation are analogous, see, e.g., State v. Sullivan, 345 S.C. 169, 173,\r\n  547 S.E.2d 183, 185 (2001), the defenses are not identical.\r\nIn Bradley,\r\n  this Court outlined four scenarios involving the law of habitation: (1) When\r\n  the occupant is the slayer and stands upon habitation apart from self-defense;\r\n  (2) When the occupant is the slayer, stands upon the right of self-defense, but\r\n  claims immunity from his duty to retreat; (3) When the occupant is the slain\r\n  and the homicide occurred while he sought to protect his habitation; and (4)\r\n  When the occupant is the slain and the homicide occurred while he was\r\n  attempting to eject a trespasser but was outside of his habitation.Â  Id. at 233-37, 120 S.E. at 242-243.Â  Although scenarios (3) and (4) clearly have no application\r\n  here, a review of the record reveals that Appellant sought to avail himself not\r\n  only of self-defense as described in scenario (2), but also of the defense of\r\n  habitation described in scenario (1).Â  By differentiating habitation from\r\n  self-defense solely on the element of a duty to retreat, the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  charge addressed the second scenario, but it did not address the first.\r\nIn the instant case, the trial courtâ€™s charge on the defense of\r\n  habitation was incomplete.Â  For that reason, we must reverse. Â \r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we reverse Appellantâ€™s conviction and remand the case\r\n  for a new trial.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  J., and Acting Justice Alexander S. Macaulay, concur.Â  MOORE, J. dissenting in\r\n  a separate opinion in which Acting Justice E. C. BURNETT, III, concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  I respectfully dissent and would affirm the decision\r\nof the trial court.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  shooting death of Rob Odom (Odom) occurred on August 14, 2004.Â  For several\r\n  months prior to Odomâ€™s death, appellant had contended with vandalism,\r\n  break-ins, thefts, destruction of property, and the killing of his pet cats at\r\n  his property on 1300 VanBoklen Road.Â  Appellant did not reside at the property\r\n  but occasionally slept at the house located there.Â  He also used the property\r\n  to store tools and equipment needed in his heating and air conditioning business.Â \r\n  He visited the property every day, sometimes more than once a day, to maintain\r\n  the property and feed the cats.\r\nBetween\r\n  March and August 14, 2004, appellant encountered many problems with trespassers\r\n  on his property.Â  The trespassers shot and killed appellantâ€™s cats on several\r\n  occasions.Â  On one occasion, the front door of the house had been kicked in and\r\n  $975 worth of tools had been taken.Â  The path the trespassers took led to 1324\r\n  VanBoklen.Â  Sometimes appellant called the police and sometimes he did not.Â  On\r\n  one occasion, an officer responded and appellant testified she would not get\r\n  out of her car.Â  Appellant told her it was a continuous problem and that it was\r\n  only going to escalate.Â  He stated the officer told him not to call 911 again\r\n  and that deputies did not need to respond to cat-killing reports.\r\nOne of the\r\n  perpetrators, Mason Mitchell, testified he thought the house was abandoned and\r\n  that it was okay to shoot the cats.Â  However, he admitted on cross-examination\r\n  that he knew someone was feeding the cats.Â  Mitchell was apparently an\r\n  eyewitness to Odomâ€™s death and he and appellant gave conflicting stories as to\r\n  what occurred that day.\r\nAccording to\r\n  Mitchell, on August 14, 2004, he, Odom, and James Oâ€™Connell went to appellantâ€™s\r\n  property and shot cats, a box, an old car, and shot the lock off the barn.Â \r\n  Odom had an AR-15, Oâ€™Connell had a .22 and Mitchell had a .40 caliber pistol.Â \r\n  Mitchell alleged that this day was the first time Odom had ever joined him and\r\n  Oâ€™Connell to shoot cats.Â  After shooting for some time, they went back to their\r\n  residence and reloaded.Â  Then, Mitchell and Odom returned to the property to\r\n  shoot more cats.\r\n When they returned,\r\n  they shot at one cat and then appellant came around the corner through the gate\r\n  carrying a rifle.Â  Appellant had his gun raised and told Odom to put his gun\r\n  down.Â  Odom allegedly said, â€œokay, donâ€™t shoot,â€ and began to put his gun\r\n  down.Â  Odom also stated, â€œitâ€™s alright to be over here, itâ€™s alright to shoot\r\n  the cats.â€Â  Odom kneeled down to put the gun, which he was now holding by the\r\n  handle, on the ground and his left arm was raised.Â  As Odom was doing that,\r\n  Mitchell testified appellant shot him.Â  Odom hit the ground, screamed, and\r\n  tried to crawl away.Â  At this point, Mitchell was hiding behind another shed.Â \r\n  He heard four shots total.Â  He stated Odom never shot at appellant, nor did he.\r\nMitchell stated he\r\n  ran back to his house and yelled for his friends to call 911.Â  He and Oâ€™Connell\r\n  went back to appellantâ€™s property to help Odom.Â  Upon arriving, they encountered\r\n  appellant who pointed his gun at them and told them they â€œbetter get off the\r\n  property or the same thing would happen toâ€ them.Â  They left and then Mitchell\r\n  and Odomâ€™s mother-in-law drove to appellantâ€™s property.Â  Upon arriving,\r\n  appellant told them Odom was dead and that they better get out of there or it\r\n  would happen to them.\r\nAccording to\r\n  appellant, on August 14, 2004, he went to his property and saw a dead cat by\r\n  the front steps of the house.Â  He also saw three sets of tracks and the lock\r\n  shot off his barn.Â  He went to his cousinâ€™s house and called 911.Â  He then went\r\n  back to wait in his driveway for the deputies.Â  After hearing a pistol shot, he\r\n  grabbed his rifle out of his truck and ran up to the house.Â  He stated that his\r\n  intention when he took the rifle out of his truck was to hold the guys there\r\n  until the police came and that he had no intention of killing anyone.Â  He went\r\n  past one of the three gates and two shots rang out.Â  He then saw Odom and a\r\n  third shot went past him.Â  Appellant went into his yard and Odom was charging\r\n  at him in a slouching position with his rifle.\r\nAppellant testified\r\n  there was no doubt in his mind that Odom was going to shoot him.Â  He stated no\r\n  words were spoken between them.Â  He stated he did not have a chance to aim his\r\n  gun and that he just shot.Â  He felt that if had waited a second, Odom would\r\n  have killed him.Â  He stated Odom fell in a position just like he was standing\r\n  and that his hands were in the same position just like he was holding the gun.[2]Â \r\n  Appellant testified Odom shot at him three times and he shot at Odom four\r\n  times.Â  Because he was afraid the other perpetrators were present, he ran to\r\n  the gate expecting to be shot at.\r\nAppellant then ran\r\n  to his cousin Jamesâ€™ home and again called 911.Â  Appellant stated the following\r\n  in this 911 call:\r\n\r\n  I\r\n    just called you about somebody breaking into my damn barn, shooting my cats.Â \r\n    Well, while I was on the phone with you, the son of a bitch come back in the\r\n    yard and just pulled a gun on me and heâ€™s deader than goddamn hell now.Â  I just\r\n    shot the hell out of him.Â  He pulled a gun on me.\r\n\r\nHe then went back to his\r\n  property and encountered two men who he said were threatening to kill him.Â  He\r\n  stated he charged at them with his gun and they ran away.\r\nInvestigator Barnes\r\n  testified that appellantâ€™s initial statements about where Odom and he were when\r\n  the shots occurred were inconsistent with the evidence found at the scene.Â  For\r\n  instance, shell casings from Odomâ€™s gun were not found in the area that\r\n  appellant indicated Odom was shooting him from.Â  There was testimony, however,\r\n  that Odomâ€™s gun had only 37 rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber,\r\n  meaning three shots could have been fired out of it.[3]Â \r\n  After appellant was released from jail, he found some of Odomâ€™s shell casings located\r\n  near a scrap metal pile, the location where appellant alleged Odom was\r\n  initially.Â  Barnes stated, however, that there is no way to determine when\r\n  those casings were fired.Â  Barnes testified that appellant has consistently\r\n  stated that he shot at Odom in self-defense.\r\nDeputy Janell\r\n  McMillian testified she responded to a call at appellantâ€™s property.Â  She\r\n  testified appellant was upset because someone was trying to injure his cats and\r\n  that he stated words to the effect that he was going to get whoever was\r\n  injuring the cats or he was going to try and kill them.\r\nDeputy Enzer\r\n  testified that when he spoke with appellant, while on the burglary call, he\r\n  became concerned because appellant informed him he had sat in the woods with\r\n  his rifle the previous day. Â Deputy Enzer testified he told appellant that if\r\n  he caught someone on his property, he should call the police and should not\r\n  take action on his own.Â  Deputy Enzer specifically told appellant not to shoot\r\n  anyone over the cats.\r\nInvestigator Ray\r\n  Livingston testified that when he spoke with appellant while on the burglary\r\n  call, appellant stated that he did not want to hurt anyone and that he was\r\n  going to try and sue whoever was killing the cats and damaging his property.\r\nThe autopsy\r\n  revealed that the shot to Odomâ€™s neck was not fatal, but the other three shots\r\n  were potentially fatal.Â  The neck wound was from the side, one wound was\r\n  slightly to the back, and the other two were from the back.Â  Odomâ€™s left arm\r\n  was elevated when he was shot.Â  The wound angles were such that Odom could not\r\n  have been facing appellant when he was shot.\r\nDuring\r\n  deliberations, the jury asked questions about whether malice could be\r\n  determined by events in earlier days such as appellantâ€™s demeanor and his\r\n  statements to officers.Â  The court refused to comment on that question.Â  The\r\n  jury subsequently found appellant guilty of murder.Â  After appellantâ€™s motion\r\n  for a new trial was denied, the court sentenced him to thirty yearsâ€™\r\n  imprisonment.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    Did the trial court err by\r\n  failing to direct a verdict of acquittal?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err by\r\n  refusing to charge appellant&rsquo;s proposed charge on appearances and defense of\r\n  habitation?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Directed Verdict\r\nAppellant\r\n  moved for a directed verdict, arguing it was impossible the killing occurred as\r\n  declared by Mitchell and that there was no evidence to support the Stateâ€™s\r\n  theory.Â  The court denied the motion stating there was sufficient evidence to\r\n  support the charge if the jury chooses to believe that evidence.\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  the directed verdict motion should have been granted because he acted in\r\n  self-defense as a matter of law and because he acted in defense of his\r\n  habitation as a matter of law.\r\nA defendant is\r\n  entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the\r\n  offense charged.Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001).Â \r\n  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence\r\n  reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the\r\n  case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C.\r\n  316, 555 S.E.2d 402 (2001).Â  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict,\r\n  the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State\r\n  v. McHoney, supra.\r\nDirected Verdict Regarding Self-Defense\r\nTo establish self-defense, the defendant must establish:Â  (1) he was without\r\n  fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) he actually believed he was in\r\n  imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) a\r\n  reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would have\r\n  entertained the same belief; and (4) he had no other probable means of avoiding\r\n  the danger.Â  State v. Long, 325 S.C. 59, 480 S.E.2d 62 (1997). However,\r\n  a person attacked on his own premises, without fault, has the right to claim\r\n  immunity from the law of retreat.Â  Id.\r\nI would find there\r\n  was sufficient evidence to send the case to the jury on the charge of murder.Â \r\n  The State presented sufficient evidence showing that appellant may have not\r\n  been acting in self-defense at the time he killed Odom.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  State presented evidence from an eye-witness that Odom never shot at appellant\r\n  and that he was actually attempting to surrender his weapon at the time he was\r\n  shot.Â  Odomâ€™s weapon was found six feet from his body and Odom was actually\r\n  shot in the back three times.Â  The State also presented evidence that appellant\r\n  had possibly laid in wait with his rifle to catch intruders on his property.Â \r\n  Also, he had been cautioned by Deputy Enzer that he could not shoot someone\r\n  because they had been shooting his cats.Â  Accordingly, there was sufficient\r\n  evidence showing that appellant may have been acting with malice aforethought\r\n  and not in self-defense.Â  Whether appellant was acting in self-defense was a\r\n  question for the jury.Â  Because there is\r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove appellantâ€™s guilt, the case was properly\r\n  submitted to the jury by the trial court.Â  State v. Buckmon, supra.\r\nAppellant relies on\r\n  the case of State v. Hendrix, 270 S.C. 653, 244 S.E.2d 503 (1978), for\r\n  the proposition that he is entitled to an acquittal because self-defense was\r\n  established as a matter of law.Â  In Hendrix, the victim and Hendrix had a poor\r\n  relationship.Â  Early on the day of the shooting, the victim told Hendrix â€œthey\r\n  were going to have to fight to settle this thing.â€Â  Later,\r\n  the victim, while intoxicated, drove to Hendrixâ€™s property.Â  While pointing a\r\n  shotgun, Hendrix warned the victim to â€œback off.â€Â  The victim returned to his\r\n  truck, obtained a shotgun, and walked towards Hendrix.Â  Hendrix told the victim\r\n  to put his gun down and then shot four times in rapid succession and killed the\r\n  victim.Â  Witnesses for the State testified the victim never pointed his gun at\r\n  Hendrix.Â  Witnesses for the defense testified the victim pointed his gun at\r\n  Hendrix and stated, â€œSay your prayers, Iâ€™m going to kill you.â€\r\nIn a 3-2 decision,\r\n  the majority of the Hendrix court discussed the four elements of\r\n  self-defense and found that self-defense was established as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Regarding the fourth element, the majority stated that Hendrix was on his own\r\n  land when the confrontation occurred and had no duty to retreat.Â  Regarding the\r\n  first element, the majority found nothing to indicate Hendrix had provoked the\r\n  fatal altercation.Â  Regarding the second and third elements, the Hendrix majority found these elements were clearly established by the evidence.Â  The\r\n  majority found that Hendrix was actually in immediate danger of losing his own\r\n  life and the circumstances were such to warrant a man of ordinary prudence to\r\n  strike the fatal blow to save his own life.Â  The majority concluded that a\r\n  verdict of acquittal was appropriate.\r\nThe Hendrix dissent found that, based on the testimony, there were at least two inferences\r\n  that could be drawn to explain why Hendrix shot the victim:Â  (1) that Hendrix\r\n  acted under a reasonable apprehension of danger, either actual or apparent, in\r\n  which case the killing was justified; or (2) that Hendrix acted out of malice,\r\n  in which case the killing was unlawful.Â  I would find that the dissent\r\n  appropriately concluded that it was a factual question whether Hendrix shot and\r\n  killed the victim in self-defense or out of malice and that this factual\r\n  question was solely within the province of the jury, not the court.Â \r\n  Accordingly, I would overrule the Hendrix decision to the extent the majority of that court determined\r\n  that self-defense could be established as a matter of law although there is\r\n  more than one inference to be drawn from the evidence presented.Â   \r\nIn the instant\r\n  case, given there are two inferences to be drawn from the evidence presented at\r\n  appellantâ€™s trial, the trial court properly denied the motion for a directed\r\n  verdict.\r\nDirected Verdict Regarding Defense of Habitation\r\nThe defense of\r\n  habitation is analogous to self-defense and should be charged when the\r\n  defendant presents evidence that he was defending himself from imminent attack\r\n  on his own premises.Â  State v. Sullivan, 345 S.C. 169, 547 S.E.2d 183\r\n  (2001).Â  To establish the defense of habitation, the defendant must establish\r\n  that a trespasser has endeavored to enter his habitation in a violent manner or\r\n  with intent to commit a felony on him or the habitation itself or in an attempt\r\n  to commit the misdemeanor of forcible entry.Â  State v. Bradley, 126 S.C.\r\n  528, 120 S.E. 240 (1923); State v. Brooks, 79 S.C. 144, 60 S.E. 518\r\n  (1908).Â  The defendant is permitted to use deadly force against the trespasser\r\n  and there is no duty for the defendant to retreat before taking the life of the\r\n  trespasser.Â  Brooks, supra.\r\nThe trial court did not err by denying the directed\r\n  verdict motion because whether appellant was acting in the defense of his\r\n  habitation is a factual question to be resolved by the jury.Â  As previously\r\n  noted, there was sufficient evidence showing that appellant may have been\r\n  acting with malice aforethought when he shot Odom.Â  Whether appellant was\r\n  actually acting in defense of habitation was a jury question.\r\nII.Â  Proposed Charges\r\nThe\r\n  trial court charged the jury:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    defendant has raised in this case what is called the defense of self-defense.Â \r\n    Self-defense is a complete defense.Â  And if it is established, you must find\r\n    the defendant not guilty.Â  The State had the burden of disproving self-defense\r\n    by proof beyond a reasonable doubt as I have already defined that term for\r\n    you.Â  If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendantâ€™s guilt after considering\r\n    all of the evidence, including the evidence of self-defense, then you must find\r\n    the defendant not guilty.Â  On the other hand, if you have no reasonable doubt\r\n    of the defendantâ€™s guilt after considering all the evidence, including the\r\n    evidence of self-defense, then you must find the defendant guilty.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The\r\n  following elements are required to establish self-defense. . . .\r\n\r\n  First,\r\n    the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty.Â  If the\r\n    defendantâ€™s conduct was the type which was reasonably calculated to and did\r\n    provoke a deadly assault, the defendant would be at fault in bringing on the\r\n    difficulty and would not be entitled to an acquittal based on self-defense.\r\n  The\r\n    second element of self-defense is that the defendant was actually in imminent\r\n    danger of death or serious bodily injury or that the defendant actually\r\n    believed that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.Â  If\r\n    the defendant was actually in imminent danger, it must be shown that the\r\n    circumstances would have warranted a person of ordinary firmness and courage to\r\n    strike the fatal blow to prevent death or serious bodily injury.Â  If the\r\n    defendant believed that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily\r\n    injury, it must be shown that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness\r\n    and courage would have had the same belief.\r\n  In\r\n    deciding whether the defendant actually was or believed that he was in imminent\r\n    danger of death or serious bodily injury, you should consider all the facts and\r\n    circumstances surrounding the crime, including the physical condition and\r\n    characteristics of the defendant and the victim.\r\n  The\r\n    defendant does not have to show that he was actually in danger.Â  It is enough\r\n    that the defendant believed he was in imminent danger and a reasonable and\r\n    prudent person of ordinary reason and ordinary firmness and courage would have\r\n    had the same belief.\r\n  The\r\n    defendant has the right to act on appearances, even though the defendantâ€™s\r\n    beliefs may have been mistaken.Â  It is for you to decide whether the\r\n    defendantâ€™s fear of immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury was\r\n    reasonable and would have been felt by an ordinary person in the same\r\n    circumstances or situation.\r\n  I\r\n    will further charge you that evidence of prior difficulty between the defendant\r\n    and the victim may be considered in deciding whether the threat existed,\r\n    whether the defendant had a reason to believe that a threat existed and how\r\n    serious the threat was.\r\n  I\r\n    will further charge you that relative sizes, ages and weights of the defendant\r\n    and the victim may be considered in deciding the apparent or the actual need\r\n    for force in self-defense and the amount of force that was needed.\r\n  The\r\n    final element of self-defense is that the defendant had no probable way to\r\n    avoid the danger of death or serious bodily injury than to act as the defendant\r\n    did in this particular circumstance.Â  I will charge you that if the defendant\r\n    was on his own premises, on his own property, the defendant had no duty to\r\n    retreat before acting in self-defense.Â  A defendant has no duty to retreat if\r\n    by doing so the danger of being killed or suffering serious bodily injury would\r\n    increase.Â  And I would further charge you that a person cannot be required to\r\n    make an exact calculation as to the degree or the amount of force which may be\r\n    needed to avoid death or serious bodily harm; therefore, in self-defense the\r\n    defendant has the right to use the force needed to avoid death or serious\r\n    bodily harm.\r\n  The\r\n    force used in self-defense does not have to be limited to the degree or the\r\n    amount of force used by the victim.Â  The defendant has the right to use so much\r\n    force as appeared to be necessary for complete self-protection and which a\r\n    person of ordinary reason and firmness would have believed they needed to\r\n    prevent death or serious bodily harm.Â  If the defendant is justified in\r\n    defending himself or others and in firing the first shot, then the defendant is\r\n    also justified in continuing to shoot until it is apparent that the danger of\r\n    death or serious bodily injury has completely ended.\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposed Charge on Defense of\r\n    Habitation\r\n  The trial court charged the defense\r\n    of habitation by stating:\r\n  . . .\r\n    the law recognizes the right of every person to defend his or her premises.Â \r\n    The same elements required by law to establish self-defense apply to the\r\n    defense of habitation, with the exception of the duty to retreat.Â  A person\r\n    defending his or her home or premises or property on their own premises has no\r\n    duty to retreat, and the same burden of proof as applies to self-defense\r\n    applies to this defense of habitation, that is, the burden of proof is on the\r\n    State to prove that the defense of habitation did not exist, and the State must\r\n    prove that beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues, however, that his proposed charge should have been given because the\r\n  requested charge was not otherwise covered by the courtâ€™s charge.Â  Appellantâ€™s\r\n  proposed charge on the defense of habitation stated:\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    person may use deadly force to protect his home.Â  Thus, he may use deadly force\r\n    to eject a trespasser who is in his house or in the area immediately\r\n    surrounding his house.\r\n  Unless\r\n    the trespasser is peaceable and well-behaved, defendant is not required to ask\r\n    the trespasser to leave before using force.\r\n\r\nThe trial court refused to\r\n  charge the proposed charge because the court believed it had adequately covered\r\n  the law.\r\nIt was unnecessary\r\n  for the trial court to use the proposed charge when his charge to the jury\r\n  adequately covered the contents of the proposed charge.Â  The habitation charge\r\n  the court gave stated that a person has a right to defend their premises and\r\n  does not have a duty to retreat.Â  Further, the court charged that the same\r\n  elements required to establish self-defense apply to the defense of\r\n  habitation.Â  Included within the self-defense charge were the following\r\n  statements:Â  (1) â€œa person cannot be required to make an exact calculation as\r\n  to the degree or the amount of force which may be needed to avoid death or\r\n  serious bodily harm; therefore, . . . the defendant has the right to use the\r\n  force needed to avoid death or serious bodily harm;â€ (2) â€œThe force used . . .\r\n  does not have to be limited to the degree or the amount of force used by the\r\n  victim.Â  The defendant has the right to use so much force as appeared to be\r\n  necessary for complete self-protection and which a person of ordinary reason\r\n  and firmness would have believed they needed to prevent death or serious bodily\r\n  harm;â€ and (3) â€œthe defendant is also justified in continuing to shoot until it\r\n  is apparent that the danger of death or serious bodily injury has completely\r\n  ended.â€Â  Accordingly, the statements regarding deadly force were sufficiently\r\n  covered in the courtâ€™s charge.Â  See State v. Austin, 299\r\n  S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989) (if trial court refuses to give specific\r\n  charge, there is no error if charge actually given sufficiently covers\r\n  substance of request).\r\nWhile nothing in\r\n  the courtâ€™s charge mentioned the word â€œtrespasserâ€ or that the defendant â€œis\r\n  not required to ask the trespasser to leave before using force,â€ all that is\r\n  required is that the substance of the law must be charged to the jury, not any\r\n  particular verbiage.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721, cert.\r\n  denied, 531 U.S. 946 (2000).Â  While the requested\r\n  charge would not have been inappropriate, the trial courtâ€™s charge, when\r\n  considered as a whole, adequately covered the applicable law under the facts of\r\n  this case.Â  Therefore, I would find the trial court did not err by failing to\r\n  charge appellantâ€™s proposed instruction on the defense of habitation.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposed Charge on Acting on\r\n  Appearances\r\nAppellantâ€™s\r\n  proposed charge on appearances is as follows:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    the consideration of whether self-defense is applicable herein, you should try\r\n    as near as you can to put yourself in defendantâ€™s situation at the time he\r\n    [fired the fatal shot].Â  You should consider the circumstances by which he was\r\n    surrounded, and take into consideration the person with whom he was dealing,\r\n    and all of the facts which surrounded him, as you obtained the same from the\r\n    testimony, and as near as you can, view the situation from defendantâ€™s\r\n    standpoint.Â  Unless the state shows that a person of ordinary reason, coolness\r\n    and prudence would not have acted as defendant did under the circumstances that\r\n    surrounded him at the time the fatal [shot was fired] then you should find the\r\n    defendant not guilty.\r\n\r\nThe trial court refused to\r\n  charge the proposed charge because the court believed it had adequately covered\r\n  the law.\r\nA request to charge\r\n  a correct statement of the law on an issue raised by the indictment and the\r\n  evidence presented at trial should not be refused.Â  State v. Austin, 299\r\n  S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989).Â  However, if the trial court refuses to give a\r\n  specific charge, there is no error if the charge actually given sufficiently\r\n  covers the substance of the request.Â  Id.\r\nAlthough\r\n  appellantâ€™s proposed charge on appearances was a correct statement of the law,[4] it was unnecessary for the trial court to use the proposed charge when his\r\n  charge to the jury adequately covered the contents of the proposed charge.Â \r\n  Besides the specific appearances charge the court issued, the court also\r\n  charged the jury the following:\r\n\r\n  If the defendant was actually in imminent danger, it\r\n    must be shown that the circumstances would have warranted a person of ordinary\r\n    firmness and courage to strike the fatal blow to prevent death or serious\r\n    bodily injury.Â  If the defendant believed that he was in imminent danger of\r\n    death or serious bodily injury, it must be shown that a reasonably prudent\r\n    person of ordinary firmness and courage would have had the same belief.\r\n  In\r\n    deciding whether the defendant actually was or believed that he was in imminent\r\n    danger of death or serious bodily injury, you should consider all the facts and\r\n    circumstances surrounding the crime, including the physical condition and\r\n    characteristics of the defendant and the victim.\r\n  The\r\n    defendant does not have to show that he was actually in danger.Â  It is enough\r\n    that the defendant believed he was in imminent danger and a reasonable and\r\n    prudent person of ordinary reason and ordinary firmness and courage would have\r\n    had the same belief.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I would find the\r\n  trial court did not err by refusing to give appellantâ€™s proposed charge on\r\n  appearances.Â  See State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298\r\n  (2002) (failure to give requested jury instruction is not prejudicial error\r\n  where the instructions given afford the proper test for determining the\r\n  issues); State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721, cert. denied,\r\n  531 U.S. 946 (2000) (trial courtâ€™s refusal to provide specific jury\r\n  instructions is not reversible error if the general instructions are\r\n  sufficiently broad to enable the jury to understand the law and the issues\r\n  involved).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWhether appellant\r\n  was actually acting in self-defense or in defense of his habitation were\r\n  questions for the jury.Â  Therefore, I would find the trial court properly\r\n  denied the motions for directed verdict and that the trial court did not err by\r\n  refusing to charge appellantâ€™s proposed instructions to the jury.Â  Further, I\r\n  would affirm appellantâ€™s remaining issues pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR,\r\n  and the following authorities:Â  Issue 4:Â  State v. Gaster, Â 349 S.C.\r\n  545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002) (the admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed in the\r\n  absence of a manifest abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice); Clark v.\r\n  Cantrell,&nbsp;339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528&nbsp;(2000) (trial judge has broad discretion in determining whether to admit\r\n  demonstrative evidence including charts and diagrams which are not direct evidence and have only secondary relevance); State v. McAlister, 149 S.C. 367, 147 S.E. 310 (1929)\r\n  (admission of an inaccurate crime scene diagram not in error where judge\r\n  informed jury it was not drawn to scale and informed jury it was admissible for\r\n  the purpose of explaining a witnessâ€™ testimony regarding landmarks); Issue 5:Â  State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 462 S.E.2d 263 (1995), cert. denied,\r\n  516 U.S. 1080 (1996) (admission of evidence is within trial courtâ€™s discretion\r\n  and absent abuse of discretion, it will not be reversed on appeal); Issue 6:Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805, cert. denied, 534\r\n  U.S. 977 (2001) (improper vouching occurs when the prosecution places the\r\n  governmentâ€™s prestige behind a witness by making explicit personal assurances\r\n  of a witnessâ€™ veracity, or where a prosecutor implicitly vouches for a witnessâ€™\r\n  veracity by indicating information not presented to the jury supports the\r\n  testimony); Issue 7:Â  State v. Bryant,&nbsp;372 S.C. 305, 642\r\n  S.E.2d 582 (2007) (defendants making a claim under Brady must\r\n  demonstrate that (1) the evidence was favorable to the defense; (2) it was in\r\n  the possession of or known to the prosecution; (3) it was suppressed by the\r\n  prosecution; and (4) it was material to guilt or punishment); Issue 8:Â  State\r\n  v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 512 S.E.2d 795 (1999) (to qualify for reversal on\r\n  ground of cumulative effect of trial errors, defendant must demonstrate errors\r\n  adversely affected his right to fair trial).\r\nI further find no\r\n  merit to the Stateâ€™s Issue requesting the dismissal of the appeal for failure\r\n  to timely serve the Notice of Appeal.Â  Pursuant to Rule 233(b), SCACR, the\r\n  service was properly made by mailing to the solicitor at his last known\r\n  address.\r\nActing Justice E. C. BURNETT, III,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] This implication arises from one of the elements of the defense of\r\n  self-defense.Â  As our precedent recognizes, self-defense requires that a\r\n  defendant show that (1) he was without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2)\r\n  he was in actual imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious\r\n  bodily injury, or he must have actually believed he was in imminent danger of\r\n  losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) a reasonably prudent\r\n  person of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the same belief;\r\n  and (4) he had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.&nbsp; State\r\n  v.

Shealy, of Gaffney, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  Ronte Houey (Appellant) was charged with second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor (CSCM).Â  The solicitor moved pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(B) (2003) for an order requiring Appellant to submit to testing for HIV and other diseases.Â  The circuit court ordered the testing, and we affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAfter Appellant was arrested and charged with second-degree CSCM, Â Â the solicitor, at the request of the victimâ€™s legal guardian, moved for an order requiring Appellant to submit to HIV and other STD testing pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(B).[1]Â  Appellant opposed the motion, arguing the State must first demonstrate probable cause that Appellant actually carries the disease before testing may be ordered.Â  He claimed the failure of Â§ 16-3-740(B) to require such a probable cause determination resulted in an unconstitutional invasion of his privacy.Â  Appellant also argued the statute was unconstitutionally vague.\r\nThe circuit court issued an order requiring Appellant to be tested, finding any alleged constitutional violations were irrelevant in light of the Stateâ€™s stipulation that it would not use the test results during trial.Â  The circuit court also found that testing ordered pursuant to Â§ 16-3-740(B) did not violate Appellantâ€™s constitutional rights.\r\nISSUES\r\n1.&nbsp; Does S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(B) require the State to establish probable cause that a suspect is actually infected with a disease before testing may be ordered?\r\n2.&nbsp; Is S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(B) unconstitutionally vague?\r\n1. Â Â Â Â Â  PROBABLE CAUSE\r\nAppellant asserts Â§ 16-3-740(B) permits a search of an individualâ€™s bodily fluids without a probable cause determination the defendant is actually infected.Â  As such, he argues it violates Fourth Amendment guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures, as well as Article I, section 10 of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  We disagree.[2]\r\n\r\n\tSection 16-3-740(B) provides:\r\n\t(B) Upon the request of a victim who has been exposed to body fluids during the commission of a criminal offense, or upon the request of the legal guardian of a victim who has been exposed to body fluids during the commission of a criminal offense, the solicitor must, at any time after the offender is charged, or at any time after a petition has been filed against an offender in family court, petition the court to have the offender tested for Hepatitis B and HIV.Â  An offender must not be tested under this section for Hepatitis B and HIV without a court order.Â  To obtain a court order, the solicitor must demonstrate the following:\r\n\t(1) the victim or the victimâ€™s legal guardian requested the tests;\r\n\t(2) there is probable cause that the offender committed the offense;\r\n\t(3) there is probable cause that during the commission of the offense there was a risk that body fluids were transmitted from one person to another; and\r\n\t(4) the offender has received notice of the petition and notice of his right to have counsel represent him at a hearing.\r\n\tThe results of the tests must be kept confidential and disclosed only to the solicitor who obtained the court order.Â  The solicitor shall then notify only those persons designated in subsection (C).Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(B).\r\nThe State concedes the testing of blood is a search within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment.Â  See Skinner v. Ry. Lab. Exec., 489 U.S. 602, 617 (1989); State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 53, 625 S.E.2d 216, 222 (2006).Â  However, the United States Supreme Court has used a special needs analysis, rather than a traditional probable cause inquiry, in cases where testing of bodily fluids was sought not as part of a criminal investigation, but rather to promote other important state interests.[3]\r\nThe special needs exception allows a search unsupported by probable cause when special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment impracticable.Â  Skinner, supra at 619.Â  In â€œspecial needsâ€ cases, where the object of the search is not to discover evidence to be used at a criminal trial, the Stateâ€™s need to search must be balanced against the invasion occasioned by the search, and the search will be reasonable if the Stateâ€™s interest outweighs the interest of the individual. Â Adams v. State, 498 S.E.2d 268, 271 (Ga. 1998) (citing Skinner, supra at 619).\r\nWe must first determine whether a special need exists which allows the State to test an offender pursuant to Â§ 16-3-740(B).Â  We find that the State has a valid interest in protecting the health and safety of victims.Â  Moreover, since Â§ 16-3-740(C) requires counseling for the offender and counseling for the victim at the victimâ€™s request, the statute furthers the Stateâ€™s interest in stemming the spread of HIV and Hepatitis B through education and counseling.Â  As stated by the Illinois Supreme Court:\r\n\r\n\tThere are few, if any, interests more essential to a stable society than the health and safety of its members.Â  Toward that end, the State has a compelling interest in protecting and promoting public health and, here, in adopting measures reasonably designed to prevent the spread of AIDSâ€¦.Once persons who are carriers of the virus have been identified, the victims of their conduct and the offenders themselves can receive necessary treatment, and, moreover, can adjust their conduct so that other members of the public do not also become exposed to HIV.Â  In this way, the spread of AIDS through the community can be slowed, if not halted.Â  We believe that the HIV testing requirement advances a special governmental need.\r\n\r\nPeople v. Adams, 597 N.E.2d 574, 580-581 (Ill. 1992) (cited in Adams v. State, supra).\r\nIn relation to Appellantâ€™s privacy interest, the Fourth Amendment permits minor intrusions by the State into an individualâ€™s body under stringently limited conditions.Â  State v. Allen, 277 S.C. 595, 597, 291 S.E.2d 459, 460 (1982).Â  Although Â§ 16-3-740(B) does not specify how the offender should be tested, the statute has a provision for additional testing by blood, saliva, and head or pubic hair.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(F).Â  Regardless of the manner tested pursuant to this section, Appellant has a nominal privacy interest in being free from HIV and Hepatitis B testing, even where such minimally invasive testing is done only for health reasons outside the context of a criminal investigation.\r\nWhere the privacy interests implicated by the search are minimal, and where an important non-criminal governmental interest furthered by the intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion, a search may be reasonable despite the absence of such suspicion.Â  Skinner, supra at 624.Â  Such is the case here.Â  The Stateâ€™s interest in these cases would be jeopardized by requiring individualized suspicion because it would be nearly impossible to show probable cause that an offender suffers from HIV or Hepatitis B, since neither disease usually manifests clear outward symptoms.Â  Thus, the statute does not violate the Fourth Amendment by failing to require probable cause that the offender has HIV or Hepatitis B before a court may order testing pursuant to Â§ 16-3-740(B).\r\nWhile the Fourth Amendment does not require probable cause and a warrant where special needs exist, our legislature has acted to provide extra protection.Â  Under Â§ 16-3-740(B), both probable cause AND a court order are required before an offender may be tested.Â  Our holding today that the special needs exception applies to the issue of particularized suspicion does not render these statutory prerequisites impracticable or unnecessary. \r\n \r\nAppellantâ€™s argument that Â§16-3-740(B) is unconstitutional under the South Carolina Constitution also fails.Â  Although our constitution favors a higher level of privacy protection than the Fourth Amendment, State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d 837 (2001), the testing at issue here is not overly intrusive or so unreasonable as to render the statute violative of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that probable cause based on individualized suspicion that an offender carries HIV or Hepatitis B is not required by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or by Article I, section 10, of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  VAGUENESS\r\nAppellant also contends Â§ 16-3-740(B) is unconstitutionally vague, inasmuch as it allows testing without regard to the timing of an alleged crime.Â  Appellantâ€™s argues that since there is no requirement of immediate testing of a suspect, any test result may not necessarily be indicative of the suspectâ€™s condition at the time of the alleged assault.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe void-for-vagueness doctrine rests on the constitutional principle that procedural due process requires fair notice and proper standards for adjudication. Â Peterson Outdoor Advert. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 327 S.C. 230, 236, 489 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1997).Â  As to civil standards, there appears a less stringent test than that applied in criminal contexts.Â  See Village of Hoffman Est., 455 U.S. 489, 498-499 (1982) (stating criminal statutes, in general, face a higher vagueness standard than do civil statutes because the consequences of imprecision in the latter are qualitatively less severe).\r\nAppellantâ€™s arguments regarding the timing of testing address evidentiary concerns in the context of the criminal proceeding.Â  Appellantâ€™s concerns are not relevant in light of the Stateâ€™s interest in preventing the spread of HIV and Hepatitis B and the Stateâ€™s interest in protecting the health of alleged victims.Â  These interests are advanced regardless of the time of testing.Â  Accordingly, we find no constitutional violation due to vagueness.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the State need not show probable cause that an offender has a disease before testing may be ordered pursuant to Â§ 16-3-740(B), provided the statutory requirements have been met.Â  In addition, Â§ 16-3-740(B) is not unconstitutionally vague.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and Acting Justice E. C. BURNETT, III, concur. WALLER, J., concurring in result only in a separate opinion in which MOORE, J., concurs. \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  :Â  I concur in result with the majority opinion, but write separately in adherence to my opinion, as originally written, which is as follows: Â \r\nAppellant, Ronte Houey, was indicted in November 2005 for criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in the second degree with a minor.Â  The solicitor moved pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(B) (2003) for an order requiring Houey to submit to testing for HIV[4] and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD).Â  Houey appeals the order, contending both that Â§ 16-3-740 is unconstitutionally vague, and that the state has no legitimate public health interest in requiring him to be tested for HIV or other diseases.Â  We disagree and affirm.Â  Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nHouey was arrested and charged with second-degree CSC for having had sexual intercourse in August 2005, with a girl who was thirteen years old; Houey was twenty years old at the time.Â  Thereafter, at the request of the Victimâ€™s legal guardian, the solicitor moved for an order requiring Houey to submit to HIV and other sexually transmitted disease testing pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(B).Â  Houey opposed the motion, contending the state must first demonstrate probable cause Houey actually carried a sexually transmitted disease or was HIV positive before testing could be ordered.Â  He contended the failure of Â§ 16-3-740(B) to require such a probable cause determination resulted in an unconstitutional invasion of his privacy.Â  He also contended the statute was impermissibly vague.Â \r\n \r\nThe circuit court issued an order requiring Houey to be tested, finding any alleged constitutional violations were irrelevant in light of the stateâ€™s stipulation that it would not use the test results during trial.Â  Houey appealed;Â Â  while the appeal was pending, however, Houey was tried and acquitted of the offense with which he was charged.Â  Accordingly, he has not been tested.Â \r\n \r\nISSUES\r\n1.Â  Does S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(B) require the state to establish probable cause that a suspect is actually infected with a sexually transmitted disease before testing may be ordered?\r\n2.Â  Is S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740(B) unconstitutionally vague?\r\n1.Â  PROBABLE CAUSE\r\nHouey asserts S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740 unconstitutionally permits a search of an individualâ€™s body fluids without a probable cause determination the defendant is infected with HIV or STDâ€™s.Â  As such, he contends it violates Fourth Amendment guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 10.Â Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740 (B) provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\t(B) Upon the request of a victim who has been exposed to body fluids during the commission of a criminal offense, or upon the request of the legal guardian of a victim who has been exposed to body fluids during the commission of a criminal offense, the solicitor must, at any time after the offender is charged, or at any time after a petition has been filed against an offender in family court, petition the court to have the offender tested for Hepatitis B and HIV. An offender must not be tested under this section for Hepatitis B and HIV without a court order. To obtain a court order, the solicitor must demonstrate the following:\r\n\t(1) the victim or the victimâ€™s legal guardian requested the tests;\r\n\t(2) there is probable cause that the offender committed the offense;\r\n\t(3) there is probable cause that during the commission of the offense there was a risk that body fluids were transmitted from one person to another; and\r\n\t(4) the offender has received notice of the petition and notice of his right to have counsel represent him at a hearing.\r\n\tThe results of the tests must be kept confidential and disclosed only to the solicitor who obtained the court order. The solicitor shall then notify only those persons designated in subsection (C).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nInitially, we agree with the circuit court that given the stateâ€™s agreement it would not use the test results against Houey, any Fourth Amendment violation is harmless.Â  See State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 643, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001) (evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in both state and federal court). Â Â Â  In any event, we find no Fourth Amendment violation.Â Â  \r\n \r\nThe state concedes the testing of blood for HIV or STDâ€™s is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.Â  See State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 625 S.E.2d 216 (2006).Â  See also Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 1295 (1997); Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives, 489 U.S. 602 (1989); Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966).Â  When such a search is conducted in furtherance of criminal investigation, the balance is tipped in favor of the defendant and the search â€œis not reasonable unless it is accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant issued upon probable cause.â€Â  Skinner, 489 U.S. at 624.Â  However, an exception to the warrant clause may apply when â€œspecial needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable.â€Â  Id.Â  In Skinner, the U.S. Supreme Court held that where the privacy interests implicated by a search are minimal, and where an important governmental interest furthered by an intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion, a search may be reasonable despite the absence of such suspicion.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nAs noted by the New Jersey Supreme Court in State in Interest of J.G., 701 A.2d 1260, 1266 (N.J. 1997), \r\n \r\n\r\n\tRecently, the Supreme Court has used a special needs analysis in cases where body searches were not conducted to further a criminal investigation, but rather, were alleged to promote other important state interests. \r\n\tSee Chandler, 520 U.S. at 1295 (applying special needs analysis to Georgia statute requiring drug tests of candidates for state office); \r\n\tVernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995) (applying special needs analysis to requirement that student athletes be tested for drug use); \r\n\tVon Raab, 489 U.S. at 656 (applying special needs analysis to United States Customs Service employee drug testing program); \r\n\tSkinner, 489 U.S. at 602 (applying special needs analysis to Federal Railroad Administration employee drug testing program); \r\n\tsee also Stigile v. Clinton, 110 F.3d 801 (D.C.Cir. 1997) (applying special needs analysis to Office of Management and Budgetâ€™s random drug testing program);\r\n\tTanks v. Greater Cleveland Regâ€™l Transit Auth., 930 F.2d 475 (6th Cir. 1991) (applying special needs analysis to suspicionless drug testing of bus driver);\r\n\tTransport Workersâ€™ Union of Philadelphia, Local 234 v. SEPTA, 884 F.2d 709 (3d Cir. 1989) (applying special needs analysis to SEPTAâ€™s drug testing program).\r\n\r\nThe Interest of J.G court found HIV testing of accused sex offenders ranks among the limited circumstances in which suspicionless searches are warranted, noting that â€œthe warrant and individualized suspicion requirements are impractical in this context. . . HIV infected sexual offenders often have no outward manifestations of infection, which means that probable cause or individualized suspicion that an assailant is infected with the AIDS virus could not be found without testing. . . .Â  Requiring probable cause or individualized suspicion before testing could be conducted would create the proverbial Catch-22 and would frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search.â€Â  701 A.2d at 1267 (Internal citations omitted).Â  See also State v. Wallace, 2005 WL 940029 (Ohio App. 2 Dist. 2005) (statute authorizing warrantless testing for STDâ€™s upon indictment for enumerated sex offenses did not violate right of privacy, due process or right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure).\r\nWe find S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740 does not effect an unconstitutional invasion of Houeyâ€™s privacy.Â  The test may be ordered only if 1) the victim or a guardian requests it, 2) there is probable cause to believe the defendant committed the offense, and 3) there is probable cause to believe there is a risk bodily fluids may have been transferred from the defendant to the victim.Â  Further, dissemination of the results of any such testing is extremely limited.Â  Given the interests of the victim in ascertaining whether the alleged assailant is HIV positive, we find the statute sufficiently complies with the special needs analysis set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Skinner and Chandler.Â  \r\n \r\n2.Â  VAGUENESS\r\nHouey also contends S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-740 is impermissibly vague, inasmuch as it allows testing without regard to the timing of an assault.Â  Houeyâ€™s contention is essentially that, since there is no requirement of immediate testing of a suspect, any test result may not necessarily be indicative of the suspectâ€™s condition at the time of the alleged assault.Â Â  We find no constitutional violation.\r\nGenerally, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, 455 U.S. 489 (1982).Â  As to civil standards, there appears a less stringent test than that applied in criminal contexts.Â  See Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, 455 U.S. 489, 498 (1982) (criminal statutes, in general, face a higher vagueness standard than do civil statutes because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe); In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 151 P.3d 717 (Hawaii 2007) (when a statute is not concerned with criminal conduct or first amendment considerations, the court must be fairly lenient in evaluating a claim of vagueness.Â  A civil statute must be so vague and indefinite as really to be no rule or standard at all.Â  Uncertainty is not enough for statute to be unconstitutionally vague; rather, it must be substantially incomprehensible). \r\n \r\nA statute can be impermissibly vague for either of two independent reasons.Â  First, it may fail to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits. Â Or, second, it may authorize or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.Â  Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000); State v. Thompkins, 263 S.C. 472, 211 S.E.2d 549 (1975).Â  See also In re Amir X.S., 371 S.C. 380,Â  391, 639 S.E.2d 144, 150 (2006) (concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the constitutional principle that procedural due process requires fair notice and proper standards for adjudication); Curtis v. State, 345 S.C.. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001). \r\n \r\nUnder the facts of this case, due to the relatively brief period of time between the alleged assault (August 2, 2005), and the date on which the state sought testing (October 27, 2005), we find no constitutional violation.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] Despite the caption which implies sexually transmitted diseases are included, Â§ 16-3-740(B) only allows for petitions for court orders to have an offender tested for Hepatitis B and HIV.\r\n[2] Initially, we find the circuit erred by holding any potential constitutional violation would be harmless given the Stateâ€™s agreement not to use the test results against Appellant. Â The agreement is irrelevant because Â§ 16-3-740(I) precludes admission of test results gathered pursuant to subsection (B) in the offenderâ€™s criminal trial.Â  Nonetheless, we do not believe the testing violated Appellantâ€™s constitutional rights.\r\n[3] See Chandler v. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997) (analyzing Georgia statute requiring drug tests of candidates for state office); Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995) (analyzing school districtâ€™s requirement that student athletes be tested for drug use); Natl. Treas. Employees Union v.

RESOLUTION OF FEE DISPUTES BOARD\r\n.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .\r\nRULE 2. &nbsp;JURISDICTION\r\nThe purpose of the Board is to establish   procedures whereby a dispute concerning fees, costs or disbursements between a   client and an attorney who is a member of the South Carolina Bar (the Bar) may   be resolved expeditiously, fairly and professionally, thereby furthering the   administration of justice, encouraging the highest standards of ethical and   professional conduct, assisting in upholding the integrity and honor of the   legal profession, and applying the knowledge, experience and ability of the   legal profession to the promotion of the public good. &nbsp;As used in these Rules,   &ldquo;fee&rdquo; is deemed to include a legal fee, costs of litigation and disbursements   associated with a legal cause, claim or matter and &ldquo;client&rdquo; is defined as a   person on whose behalf professional legal services have been rendered by an   attorney who is a member of the South Carolina Bar. &nbsp;\r\nUnder no circumstances will the Board   participate in: (1) a fee dispute involving an amount in dispute of $50,000 or   more; or (2) disputes over which, in the first instance, a court, commission,   judge, or other tribunal has jurisdiction to fix the fee. &nbsp;When an allegation of   attorney misconduct arises out of a fee dispute other than as to the   reasonableness of the fee, the Board, in its discretion, may refer the matter to   the Commission on Lawyer Conduct. &nbsp;If the alleged misconduct does not arise out   of a fee dispute, it shall be referred to the Commission on Lawyer   Conduct.\r\nNo fee dispute may be filed with the Board more   than three (3) years after the dispute arose.\r\nJurisdictional issues shall be determined by   the circuit chair.\r\nLast Amended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\n.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .\r\nRULE 4.&nbsp; DUTIES\r\nThe Board is authorized to receive, inquire   into, take proofs, and make findings and final determination of disputes between   attorneys and clients. &nbsp;It shall be the duty of the Board to encourage the   amicable resolution of fee disputes falling within its jurisdiction. &nbsp;Each   member shall continue to serve until completion of ongoing work on the   Board.\r\nAmended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\n.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .\r\nRULE 8. &nbsp;ASSIGNED   MEMBER\r\nThe member of the circuit panel who is assigned   to conduct the initial investigation of an application shall be known as the   &ldquo;assigned member.&rdquo; &nbsp;The assigned member shall not be a member of the hearing   panel which hears a dispute investigated by that assigned member or represent a   party before that hearing panel.&nbsp; With the consent of the Executive Director of   the Bar and as provided in Rule 11, a Bar staff person who is a Bar member or   who is supervised by a Bar member may be appointed as the assigned member. \r\n \r\nAmended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\nRULE 9. &nbsp;RULE EXCLUSIVE UPON   CONSENT\r\n(a) Any client-applicant for   the services of the Board must consent in writing to be bound by a final   decision of the Board. &nbsp;Thereafter, the attorney is also bound.\r\n(b) No application will be   accepted from an attorney unless accompanied by the client&rsquo;s written consent to   jurisdiction and consent to be bound by the final decision of the Board.&nbsp;   Thereafter, both parties are bound.\r\n(c) Upon consent of the   client-applicant to be bound by the final decision of the Board, exclusive   jurisdiction over the fee dispute vests in the Board.\r\nAmended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\nRULE 10. &nbsp;COMMENCEMENT OF   PROCEEDINGS\r\nAll proceedings hereunder shall be commenced by   filing in the office of the Bar, on forms provided by the Bar, a written   statement of the facts and circumstances surrounding the dispute, furnishing   complete names and addresses. &nbsp;If the client-applicant is not the person who   paid for the lawyer&rsquo;s services, the third party payer, with the written consent   of the client-applicant, may jointly file with the client-applicant, with both   signatures affixed to the form.&nbsp; If the materials submitted exceed twenty-five   (25) pages, the client-applicant shall submit three sets of the   materials.\r\nA copy of the completed form, as filed, shall   be sent by certified mail to all parties to the disagreement or dispute. &nbsp;A copy   shall be sent by regular mail or email to the circuit chair in the circuit where   the principal place of practice of the attorney is located. &nbsp;If the application   involves attorneys in more than one circuit, a copy of the completed form shall   be sent to the chair of the Executive Council, who shall designate which of   these circuit chairs shall have jurisdiction and shall proceed with the   matter.\r\nIf the amount in dispute exceeds $5,000, the   circuit chair may appoint a hearing panel without assignment of the matter to an   assigned member.&nbsp; \r\n \r\nAfter the initial correspondence, all other   correspondence will be sent by regular mail or, with the written consent of the   client and lawyer, by email.&nbsp; Such written consent may be withdrawn by written   notice served on all other parties or attorneys.&nbsp; If served by regular mail,   correspondence will be deemed served upon deposit in the U.S. Mail with proper   postage affixed.&nbsp; If served by email, service is complete upon transmission,   unless the party making service learns that the attempted service did not reach   the person to be served.&nbsp; All parties have the duty to inform the circuit chair   of any change of address.\r\nAmended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\nRULE 11. &nbsp;INVESTIGATION BY ASSIGNED   MEMBER\r\nUpon receipt of the completed form, the circuit   chair shall promptly appoint the assigned member. &nbsp;The assigned member shall   conduct an investigation sufficient to enable the rendering of an informed   recommendation. &nbsp;The assigned member&rsquo;s recommendation shall be written and   contain the reasons for it.&nbsp; This report shall be submitted to the circuit   chair, with a copy to the Bar office, as soon as possible and not later than   ninety (90) days after appointment of the assigned member, unless the time is   extended by the circuit chair pursuant to Rule 12. &nbsp;The circuit chair shall send   a copy of the report to each of the parties and notification of the circuit   chair&rsquo;s concurrence or nonconcurrence with the recommendations of the assigned   member. &nbsp;\r\nThe attorney shall respond to the issues raised   in the application within thirty (30) days of being contacted by the assigned   member.&nbsp; The assigned member may extend the period for response once and by no   more than thirty (30) days.\r\nThe parties to the dispute and any witnesses on   their behalves shall make themselves available for interview at a time and place   designated by the assigned member within the time required for the assigned   member to make a report.&nbsp; If a party or a witness cannot, for any reason, be   present at the designated time and place, that witness or party shall submit a   written response to the assigned member within fourteen (14) days of the date   the assigned member designated as the interview date, unless the assigned member   grants the party or witness an extension.&nbsp; The party or witness may also submit   a statement in writing, provided such statement is delivered to the assigned   member on or before the date designated for the interview of that party or   witness.&nbsp; The response to questions along with the written statement, if any,   together shall constitute the complete statement of the party or witness   concerning the dispute.&nbsp; In the event a party fails to respond, then the   assigned member must render a decision based upon the available materials. \r\n \r\nThe assigned member may encourage resolution of   the dispute by compromise where the circumstances warrant such effort. &nbsp;Efforts   at compromise may include mediation of the dispute by the assigned member.   &nbsp;Compromise or consent agreements, whether written or oral, become the final   decision of the Board fifteen (15) days after the date of a letter from the   circuit chair to the parties confirming the agreement.\r\nAmended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\nRULE 12.&nbsp; SCHEDULE OF PROCEEDINGS \r\n \r\n(a) All fee disputes should be   resolved within six (6) months. &nbsp;The assigned member&rsquo;s report should be   completed within thirty (30) to ninety (90) days after being forwarded by the   circuit chair. &nbsp;A fee dispute may not exceed six (6) months without the written   consent of the circuit chair for good cause shown. &nbsp;Any extension of time   granted by the circuit chair must be for a specified period of time which shall   be the least amount of time deemed necessary to resolve the dispute.\r\n(b) If an assigned member does not   respond to reminders from the Bar office, the Bar office will notify the circuit   chair.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n(c) If a fee dispute has been assigned   and is pending, without an extension approved by the circuit chair,\r\n(1) more than ninety (90) days, then the   circuit chair may, at his or her discretion:\r\n(A) reassign the fee dispute;   or\r\n(B) if the amount exceeds $5,000,   appoint a hearing panel, which shall schedule a hearing within thirty (30) days. \r\n \r\n(2) more than six (6) months, then the   circuit chair shall, with the concurrence of the Executive Council   Chair:\r\n(A) reassign the fee dispute;\r\n(B) if the amount exceeds $5,000,   appoint a hearing panel, which shall schedule a hearing within thirty (30) days;   or\r\n(C) return all investigative notes and   application to a designated Bar staff member for investigation as the assigned   member. \r\n \r\nIn these events, the original assigned member   shall immediately turn over notes and files to the circuit chair.\r\n(d) If the circuit chair is delinquent,   then the case may be reassigned to the Executive Council Chair or the Executive   Council Chair&rsquo;s designee.\r\nLast Amended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\nRULE 13. &nbsp;PROCEEDINGS OF THE   BOARD\r\nIf the amount in dispute is $5,000 or less, the   decision of the assigned member with the concurrence of the circuit chair shall   be the final decision of the Board.\r\nIf the amount in dispute is more than $5,000,   the decision of the assigned member with the concurrence of the circuit chair   shall be served on the parties by first class mail, with proper postage affixed,   or by email, provided the parties have consented to service by email in   accordance with Rule 10.&nbsp; The decision is final unless a written request for a   hearing panel is made by filing such request with the circuit chair within   thirty (30) days after the date of mailing written notification of the decision.   &nbsp;(For Hearing Panel Decision, see Rule 17.)\r\nIf the chair does not concur with the decision   of the assigned member, a hearing panel will be appointed.\r\nAmended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\n.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .\r\nRULE 15. &nbsp;PANEL   HEARINGS\r\nThe chair of the hearing panel shall convene a   hearing at a place within the circuit within forty-five (45) days of assignment   by the circuit chair and at least thirty (30) days after giving notice to the   parties by first class mail, with proper postage affixed, unless otherwise   agreed by all parties and the panel members.&nbsp; The notice shall inform the   parties that the hearing is de novo and that no reports or other   information from the assigned member will be considered.&nbsp; The notice also shall   inform the parties that they may have witnesses present and may present   documentary evidence and should present all evidence they expect to present at   the hearing. \r\n \r\nIf the circuit chair determines that a hearing   panel or panel member is delinquent in scheduling or attending a hearing, the   circuit chair has the authority to reassign the whole panel or reassign one or   more panel members. \r\n \r\nIf a party or a witness cannot, for any reason,   be present at the hearing, a written statement shall be submitted which shall be   the complete statement of the party or witness.&nbsp; If a party fails to appear,   then the hearing panel shall render its decision based on the available   testimony and documentation. \r\n \r\nConduct of the hearings shall be pursuant to   such rules and procedures as the Executive Council may prescribe.&nbsp; While it is   not necessary to follow strictly the rules of evidence as generally applied in   circuit court, hearings should be conducted in conformance generally with them.&nbsp;   If the hearing cannot be completed within the allotted time, it may be adjourned   by the panel chair and reconvened with no less than ten (10) days notice, unless   the parties and panel members otherwise agree to a date and time certain.   &nbsp;\r\nA party to a fee dispute may, at the party&rsquo;s   own expense, cause any hearing by the panel to be recorded and transcribed.&nbsp; The   tape recording of the hearing shall be the property of the Board.&nbsp; If a party   has a hearing transcribed, the party shall, at the party&rsquo;s own expense, provide   a copy of the transcript to the Board. \r\n \r\nLast Amended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\nRULE 16. &nbsp;VOLUNTARY   TERMINATION\r\nPrior to the final decision of the Board, the   party who initiated the process may terminate the process.&nbsp; Termination of the   process takes effect upon receipt in the Bar office of written acknowledgement   from the initiating party.\r\nThis written acknowledgement of withdrawal will   have the effect of ending the availability of the procedure with prejudice to   the initiating party as to that dispute so that a party who initially filed an   application with the Board may not make a second filing on the same dispute   after withdrawing the first filing.&nbsp; Should that party fail to make a written   acknowledgement of the withdrawal, the Board shall proceed to resolve the matter   without delay. \r\n \r\nNothing herein is to be construed as limiting a   party from filing an amended or supplemental form pertaining to the dispute, if   requested or if needed, under such conditions as the hearing panel may provide   or as may be established by the Executive Council. \r\n \r\nLast Amended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\nRULE 17. &nbsp;HEARING PANEL   DECISION\r\nUpon conclusion of the panel hearing, the   hearing panel members shall forthwith proceed to reach a decision and shall,   within fifteen (15) days of the hearing, issue a written decision, including a   factual statement of the controversy and the reasons for the decision reached.&nbsp;   A decision of the majority of the hearing panel shall constitute a final   decision of the Board.&nbsp; The written decision shall be filed with the Bar, and a   copy sent to the circuit chair and each party to the dispute by first class   mail, with proper postage affixed, or by email, provided the parties have   consented to service by email in accordance with Rule 10.&nbsp; Service by mail is   complete upon mailing. \r\n \r\nLast Amended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\nRULE 18. &nbsp;CONFLICTS OF   INTEREST\r\nIn case of a conflict of interest or   disqualification of a circuit chair and vice-chair after disqualification of a   circuit chair in a given case, the chair of the Executive Council shall then act   as the circuit chair in that specific instance.\r\nIn case the chair of the Executive Council has   a conflict of interest or is disqualified, the member of the Executive Council   next senior in years of active practice in this state shall act as Executive   Council chair in that specific instance.\r\nIn extraordinary cases where members of the   circuit panel are disqualified for any reason, either voluntarily or   involuntarily, in a specific dispute, and there do not remain enough members of   the circuit panel to comprise the hearing panel, the chair of the Executive   Council, or, in the event of the disqualification of the chair of the Executive   Council, the President shall appoint the requisite number of members from the   Board to the hearing panel.\r\nLikewise, should any member of the circuit   panel in a judicial circuit fail or refuse to discharge the duties of a member   of the Board, the chair of the Executive Council shall appoint a substitute   member from members of the Board.\r\nAmended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\n.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .\r\nRULE 20.&nbsp; APPEALS  \r\n(a) A party may appeal the   final decision of the Board to the circuit court in the county where the   principal place of practice of the attorney is located, with written notice to   the South Carolina Bar Resolution of Fee Disputes Board, Post Office Box 608,   Columbia, SC 29202.&nbsp; The court shall only vacate a final decision of the Board   where:\r\n(1) the decision was procured   by corruption, fraud or other undue means;\r\n(2) there was evident   partiality or corruption in an assigned member or hearing panel member, or   misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;\r\n(3) the assigned member or   hearing panel members exceeded their powers;\r\n(4) the hearing panel members   refused to postpone the hearing, if any, upon sufficient cause being shown   therefore, or the assigned member or hearing panel members refused to hear   evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise conducted the proceeding so   as to substantially prejudice the rights of a party;\r\n(5) the hearing panel chair   did not provide notice of the hearing as required under Rule 15.\r\nFiling an appeal does not stay the issuance of   a Certificate of Non-Compliance.&nbsp; However, if, upon filing a notice of appeal, a   lawyer pays the disputed sum to the Bar to be held in trust pending resolution   of the appeal, no Certificate of Non-Compliance shall be issued.&nbsp; The Bar shall   remit the disputed sum to the prevailing party within ten (10) days of the entry   of an order by the circuit court.&nbsp; \r\n \r\n(b) An appeal must be made   within thirty (30) days after the mailing of a copy of the final decision by the   appealing party, except that if based upon corruption, fraud or other undue   means, it shall be made within thirty (30) days after such grounds are known or   should have been known.\r\n(c) The Board shall supply to   the circuit court the following material which shall constitute the record on   appeal: the application, the decision of the assigned member, the concurrence or   non-concurrence of the circuit chair, and in disputes involving amounts greater   than $5,000, the decision of the hearing panel.&nbsp; The parties and the circuit   court shall provide the Board, at the above address, notice of all proceedings   and the final disposition.\r\n(d) In vacating the final decision, the   court may order a reconsideration by a new assigned member appointed by the   circuit chair, or if vacating the decision of a hearing panel, a rehearing   before a new hearing panel appointed by the circuit chair. &nbsp;When a final   decision of the Board is vacated, any judgment which may have been entered   pursuant to that decision also is vacated.\r\nAmended by Order dated November 5, 2003.&nbsp; The   amendment to 20(a) provides that an appeal from a decision of the Board does not   stay the issuance of a Certificate of Non-Compliance and restricts the circuit   court from vacating a decision of the Board only when one of the five grounds   set forth in 20(a) have been met.&nbsp; The amendment to 20(c) provides that the   parties and the circuit court shall provide the Board with notice of all   proceedings and the final disposition.\r\nLast Amended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\n.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .\r\nRULE 22. &nbsp;AMENDMENTS TO   RULES\r\nUpon approval by the Bar&rsquo;s House of Delegates,   amendments to these Rules shall be submitted to the Supreme Court of South   Carolina for approval.\r\nAmended by Order dated September 7,   2007.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"CLE Suspended Judges","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2007-09-07-03","description":"","date":"2007-09-10","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Commission on Continuing Legal Education and Specialization has\r\n  furnished the attached list of magistrates and municipal judges who have not\r\n  complied with the continuing legal education requirements of Rule 510, SCACR.Â \r\n  These judges are hereby suspended from their judicial offices, without pay,\r\n  until further Order of this Court.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n\ts/\r\n      Jean H.
