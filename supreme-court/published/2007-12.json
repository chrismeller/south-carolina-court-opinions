Hawkins, LLC, of Columbia, for\r\n  respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a\r\n  definite suspension not to exceed one (1) year, retroactive to October 4, 2006,\r\n  the date of his interim suspension.[1]Â \r\n  We accept the agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of\r\n  law in this state for one (1) year, retroactive to October 4, 2006. The facts,\r\n  as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nIn November\r\n  1998, respondent was admitted to the practice of law.Â  At all times relevant to\r\n  this agreement, he was a sole practicioner.Â  In January 2004, respondent began\r\n  to practice real estate law, primarily handling residential refinancings, and\r\n  he closed roughly four to nine refinancing closings per month.Â   \r\nIn August 2004,\r\n  Johnny Hoy contacted respondent and asked him to conduct real estate closings\r\n  for individuals purchasing mobile home/real estate packages.Â  As a real estate\r\n  developer/investor Hoy would sell the mobile home property and arrange for financing\r\n  for buyers with BB&amp;T.Â  Neither Hoy nor respondent knew each other or had\r\n  business dealings before this initial contact.\r\nRespondent had not previously closed mobile\r\n  home transactions and had only limited experience in purchase transactions.Â \r\n  Respondent informed Hoy, as well as the BB&amp;T representative, Robert Green,\r\n  the manager of a local branch, of his lack of experience in the area of mobile\r\n  home purchase transactions.Â  Respondent requested written closing instructions\r\n  from BB&amp;T and was told by both Green and Hoy that BB&amp;T did not provide\r\n  written closing instructions to closing lawyers and that, instead, BB&amp;T\r\n  relied upon their bank representatives to orally convey any applicable\r\n  instructions.Â  Respondent received direction regarding the lenderâ€™s closing\r\n  procedures from Green.Â   \r\nRespondent learned that a law firm in Columbia had previously represented Hoy in similar transactions.Â  Hoy advised respondent\r\n  that the law firm could no longer process the closings because of a\r\n  disagreement with the firmâ€™s title insurance company.Â   \r\nRespondent contacted a lawyer at the law\r\n  firm and asked questions about appropriate procedures in back to back closings,\r\n  mobile home transactions, and this type of closing in general and why the law\r\n  firm had ceased representing purchase(s)/mortgagee(s) in real estate closings\r\n  arranged by Hoy.Â  Respondent represents the lawyer told him that Hoy was â€œa\r\n  straight shooter,â€ or words of similar import and the law firm only ceased\r\n  representing purchaser(s)/mortgagee(s) in transactions arranged by Hoy because\r\n  the firmâ€™s title insurance company would not insure mobile home/real estate\r\n  package transactions.Â  The lawyer stated he hoped to assist Hoy in the future.Â \r\n  The lawyer gave respondent no warning or information which would have raised\r\n  concerns about Hoy, Green, or the procedures which had been presented.Â  Â Â Â \r\n \r\nIn addition, respondent learned that\r\n  another attorney had also closed loans for Hoy in an identical manner.Â \r\n  Respondent represents he attempted to contact this lawyer, but was unable to\r\n  reach him.Â  Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nDuring the first transaction involving\r\n  Hoy and Green, respondent asked Hoy whether the buyerâ€™s closings funds would be\r\n  paid by money order or cashierâ€™s check and Hoy informed respondent that he had\r\n  already been paid.Â  Respondent advised Hoy that advance payment of a down payment\r\n  would require respondent to obtain approval from the lender and that he would\r\n  inquire whether and how the advance payment would be reflected on the HUD-1\r\n  Settlement Statement.Â   \r\nRespondent communicated with Green who\r\n  advised that the fact that Hoy had already been paid a down payment was\r\n  acceptable procedure approved by the bank and that it was, in fact, a common\r\n  occurrence.Â  Green also advised respondent that, as a rule, the lender did not\r\n  â€œsource and seasonâ€ either down payment funds or title, thereby diminishing the\r\n  need for the closing attorney to verify funds or formalize disclosure.Â \r\n  Further, Green advised that this procedure had been followed for a significant\r\n  time by its two former closing attorneys, as well as an attorney in Aiken.Â \r\n  Once again, respondent requested written closing instructions but was again\r\n  told by Green that BB&amp;T did not furnish written closing instructions.Â \r\n \r\nAt the first of the BB&amp;T/Hoy\r\n  closings, respondent presented the HUD-1 Settlement Statement to the buyer and\r\n  seller and invited their attention to, among other things, the purchase price,\r\n  the loan amount, and the down payment and asked if each was true and correct.Â \r\n  Neither buyer nor seller indicated the amount was incorrect or that the down\r\n  payment had not been paid.Â  Respondent did not, however, devote any additional\r\n  time or resources to the investigation of the acts surrounding the down payment\r\n  in this matter and, instead, closed the loan as it was presented. Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nThereafter, from August 12, 2004 through\r\n  April 30, 2005, respondent served as closing attorney for purchaser(s)/mortgagee(s) in approximately 48 transactions arranged by Hoy,\r\n  most, if not all, financed by BB&amp;T with Green.Â  Twenty-three of the\r\n  transactions were â€œflipsâ€ where the subject property was purchased by Hoy and\r\n  then conveyed to the actual/eventual purchaser(s)/mortgagee(s) in a second\r\n  transaction at a value in excess of the real or initial acquisition costs by Hoy.Â \r\n  The HUD-1 Settlement Statements did not reflect the fact that the funds from\r\n  the second transaction were used to fund Hoyâ€™s acquisition of the property in\r\n  the first transaction.[2]  \r\nRespondent became concerned about the\r\n  methods Hoy was using to consummate the transactions and discussed his concerns\r\n  with Green.Â  Among other perceived irregularities, respondent was concerned\r\n  with 1) the back to back closings, title issues, de-titling issues, and valuation\r\n  of the transactions wherein Hoy was acquiring the property then immediately\r\n  (sometimes in the same day) conveying the property to a buyer; 2) the claimed\r\n  down payment which both Hoy and the party purchasing the property from Hoy\r\n  assured respondent had been paid; and 3) the possibility that some purchasers/mortgagees\r\n  who qualified for loans did not intend to reside on the property and may have\r\n  purchased properties for relatives who did not qualify for loans but intended to\r\n  reside on the property.Â   \r\nGreen advised respondent that the bank\r\n  took no position on who resided on the purchaserâ€™s property.Â  Further, Green,\r\n  once again, told respondent that the methodology being used by Hoy was\r\n  acceptable to the bank in all respects and that no other notification or documentation\r\n  was necessary.Â  Respondent faxed the Courtâ€™s opinion in Matter of Lathan,\r\n  360 S.C. 326, 600 S.E.2d 902 (2004), to Green and Â Â Â insisted on complying with\r\n  the requirement of placing the letters â€œPOCâ€ (payable outside of closing) on\r\n  line 303 of all future HUD-1 Settlement Statements.Â  Green indicated that,\r\n  while respondentâ€™s request to comply with Matter of Lathan was â€œvery\r\n  conscientiousâ€ and â€œnot necessary,â€ it would be acceptable to the bank.Â \r\n  Thereafter, respondent closed an additional thirty-seven loans involving\r\n  BB&amp;T and Hoy.Â  Unlike the loans in Matter of Lathan, the\r\n  Hoy/BB&amp;T loans were not sold on the secondary market but were retained and\r\n  serviced by BB&amp;T.Â   \r\nIn a significant number of the\r\n  transactions, the â€œcash from borrowerâ€ line on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements was\r\n  marked â€œPOCâ€ when, in fact, the amounts were not actually paid outside of the\r\n  closing to Hoy by the purchaser(s)/mortgagee(s).Â  Respondent acknowledges that,\r\n  under the circumstances of the closings, he should have known that this\r\n  information reported to him by the buyers and Hoy was incorrect and he admits\r\n  he eventually suspected this to be the case notwithstanding representations by\r\n  the borrowers and/or Hoy.Â   \r\nIn one matter, Hoy arranged two\r\n  transactions where he was receiving title to a property in the first\r\n  transaction and conveying the property in the second transaction.Â  Hoy advised\r\n  respondent that he had the subject property under contract with an out of state\r\n  bank that was selling the property out of foreclosure, that the bank had\r\n  allowed Hoy to take possession of the residence, that his contract to purchase\r\n  had been in effect for roughly three months so that he could bring the\r\n  residence up to a saleable state, and that he had made substantial repairs to\r\n  the propertyâ€™s subfloor and replaced all of its appliances.Â   \r\nThe two closings were both scheduled for\r\n  December 12, 2004.Â  On that day, respondent learned the selling bank had\r\n  actually allowed Hoy to permit the eventual buyer to move into the property and\r\n  the buyer had already taken up residence.Â  The selling bank, however, waited\r\n  until some time in January to mail the January 18th-dated deed to\r\n  respondent.Â  Respondent contacted the selling bank and attempted to obtain a\r\n  properly dated deed which reflected the actual closing date of December 12, but\r\n  the bank refused to do so.Â   \r\nRespondent brought this situation to the\r\n  attention of the parties in the second transaction, the lending bank, the\r\n  eventual buyer, and Hoy.Â  The bankâ€™s loan officer indicated he would need to\r\n  consult with his supervisor and, subsequently, advised respondent that the\r\n  bankâ€™s position was that the loan on the transaction from Hoy to the bankâ€™s\r\n  customer should be reclosed at a date after January 18 to correct any existing\r\n  deficiencies.Â  Respondent inquired of the officer of the Register of Deeds\r\n  regarding the process to ensure title was properly conveyed and was advised to\r\n  record a corrective deed.Â  The loan was then re-closed per the request of the\r\n  bank and a corrective deed was recorded which reflected a deed transfer date\r\n  subsequent to the transfer to Hoy on January 18th.Â   \r\nUltimately, respondent learned that Hoy,\r\n  Green, and the appraisers used by Hoy were subject to a federal investigation\r\n  in connection with the real estate closings handled by respondent.Â  Respondent\r\n  made a self-report to ODC.Â  Subsequently, another attorney who had also filed a\r\n  civil lawsuit against respondent, Hoy, and Green, filed a complaint against\r\n  respondent with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.Â   \r\nHoy and Green were indicted by federal\r\n  authorities.Â  Both pled guilty to bank fraud.Â  An allegation in Hoyâ€™s\r\n  indictment states Hoy was responsible for falsifying the loan applications of\r\n  borrowers,[3] in addition to falsely reporting that he had received down payments. Federal\r\n  authorities advised ODC that respondent cooperated fully in their\r\n  investigation.Â   \r\nODC does not contend respondent was aware\r\n  of Hoyâ€™s or Greenâ€™s criminal activities.Â  Instead, ODC contends that\r\n  respondentâ€™s failure to insist on certified funds from Hoy in his initial\r\n  purchase of the properties was an unknowing and unintentional aid to Hoy and\r\n  Green.Â  Respondentâ€™s error was the result of failing to devote adequate time to\r\n  the investigation of the facts surrounding the circumstances of the loans and,\r\n  specifically, to the alleged down payments.Â Â  Â Â \r\nIn mitigation, respondent attempted to\r\n  contact two lawyers who had previously represented Hoy and did speak with one\r\n  of the lawyers about representing Hoy.Â  Further, respondent had multiple\r\n  conversations with the bankâ€™s loan officer, Green, about the propriety of Hoyâ€™s\r\n  transactions.Â  However, respondent did not realize that Green was engaged in a\r\n  conspiracy with Hoy.Â   \r\nODC believes respondent did not\r\n  deliberately seek to assist Hoy or Green or their co-conspirators in criminal\r\n  undertakings or have knowledge of their criminal intent.Â  Respondent represents\r\n  he saw no appraisals and had no contact with appraisers; ODC does not dispute\r\n  this representation.Â  Respondentâ€™s title search was conducted by an outside\r\n  abstractor and the abstractorâ€™s fees were reasonable and customary in the area\r\n  and properly reported on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements.Â  ODCâ€™s investigation\r\n  reveals respondent did not receive any additional financial compensation or\r\n  other benefit from the closings involving Hoy and Green.Â  All fees received by\r\n  respondent are shown on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements and his law firmâ€™s\r\n  trust account ledgers and the fees appear to be reasonable and customary for\r\n  work of this type in the Columbia and Lexington areas of the state.  \r\nRespondent has no previous disciplinary\r\n  history.Â  He has been fully cooperative and forthright with ODC and the federal\r\n  authorities in connection with their investigations.Â  ODC submits respondentâ€™s\r\n  forthrightness was demonstrated in his ready and candid admissions about his\r\n  suspicions and concerns.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to client); Rule 1.2 (lawyer may limit objectives of\r\n  representation with client consent after consultation); Rule 1.7(a) (lawyer\r\n  shall not represent client if representation involves a concurrent conflict of\r\n  interest); Rule 4.1(a) (in representing a client, lawyer shall not make false\r\n  statement of material fact to a third person); Rule 4.1(b) (in representing a\r\n  client, lawyer shall not fail to disclose a material fact when disclosure is\r\n  necessary to avoid assisting criminal or fraudulent act by a client); Rule \r\n8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of\r\n    Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct\r\n    involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e)\r\n    (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of\r\n    justice). Â In addition, respondent admits his misconduct\r\n  constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction\r\n  regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground\r\n  for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law one (1)\r\n  year, retroactive to October 4, 2006.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BEATTY,\r\n  JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., not participating.Â Â Â Â   \r\n\r\n[1] See In the Matter of Johnson, 370 S.C. 495, 636 S.E.2d 620 (2006).Â  \r\n \r\n[2] Specifically, the HUD-1 Settlement Statement did\r\n  not show a concurrent transaction in which Hoy purchased the same property.Â  In\r\n  essence, there was a transaction between Hoy and the seller of foreclosed\r\n  properties (usually the bank that had foreclosed on the property) and,\r\n  concurrently, a transaction where Hoy was selling the same property to a third\r\n  party buyer.Â  While Hoy paid for his purchase with a business check drawn on\r\n  his corporate account, respondent should have known that the short amount of\r\n  time between Hoyâ€™s purchase and his sale enabled Hoy to use the same incoming\r\n  funds from the second transaction to fund his purchase of the property in the\r\n  first transaction.Â  Respondent acknowledges that the HUD-1 Settlement Statement\r\n  in the sales transaction by Hoy should have reflected that the funds from the\r\n  sale were being applied to the initial acquisition by Hoy and the â€œdue sellerâ€\r\n  line should have been reduced by a like amount.Â  Â Â \r\n[3] It is not claimed that respondent had any\r\n  involvement in or suspicion of Hoyâ€™s false applications.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26399","title":"In the Matter of Leroy Jonathan DuBre","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26399","description":"This is an opinion in which the Court publicly reprimands a lawyer.","date":"2007-12-10","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      IN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of Leroy Jonathan DuBre,\tRespondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26399\r\n  Submitted October 30, 2007 - Filed December 10, 2007 \r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.

We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\n Brock &amp; Scott, PLLC, is a law firm with its principal place of business in Winston Salem, North Carolina.  At one time, Brock &amp; Scott had several other offices in North Carolina and in Greer, South Carolina.  Respondent was employed with Brock &amp; Scott as managing attorney of the Greer office from May 2005 to February or March 2006. \r\n    \r\n  In March 2006, Brock &amp; Scott was retained to file a complaint on behalf of Client A who was seeking a deficiency judgment on the foreclosed property of Complainants.  In March 2006, respondent signed the Summons and Complaint and Plaintiff's Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents in the collection action.  The Summons and Complaint were served on the Complainants on or about March 31, 2006.  On or about April 18, 2006, the Complainants served their answer at the Greer office of Brock &amp; Scott.\r\n \r\n On or about June 15, 2006, Brock &amp; Scott moved for a default judgment on behalf of Client A.  The motion was granted.  Upon notification of the default judgment, Complainants notified Brock &amp; Scott of their prior answer to the complaint.  Brock &amp; Scott then notified the court of the error in seeking the default judgment and requested that the default judgment be set aside.  The judgment was set aside by order dated August 17, 2006. \r\n \r\n Respondent maintains he took no actions on Complainants' case other than signing the Summons and Complaint and the \r\nPlaintiff's Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents.  Respondent states that the Summons and Complaint and the \r\nPlaintiff's Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents were prepared in the Winston Salem office and forwarded to the Greer office for his signature.  Respondent also states he forwarded the signed Summons and Complaint and the \r\nPlaintiff's Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents to the Winston Salem office and all other matters were handled through the Winston Salem office.\r\n \r\n Respondent represents there were no attorneys in the Winston Salem office who were licensed to practice law in South Carolina.  Respondent admits that his actions assisted in the unauthorized practice of law. \r\n \r\nMatter II\r\n Respondent represents he signed an estimated fifty (50) to one hundred and fifty (150) Summons and Complaints for Brock &amp; Scott but performed no other action on the cases.  He represents that in collection proceedings it was the practice of Brock &amp; Scott to handle the entire action from the Winston Salem office and \r\nrespondent's only function was the signing of documents to be filed with the court.\r\n \r\nFurther, respondent admits that his responsibilities as \r\nmanaging attorney for the Greer office included the marketing and closing of \r\nloans. Respondent states that when he solicited clients, he distributed a \r\npackage of information which contained contact information for Brock &amp; Scott. \r\nRespondent admits the telephone number in the material appeared to be a South \r\nCarolina number but was actually a &quot;backdoor&quot; number which directly contacted the Winston Salem office.  Respondent states the same was true for the facsimile number provided to potential clients.\r\n \r\nRespondent maintains he became very concerned about the procedures employed by Brock &amp; Scott in its collection matters and that he made several attempts to become more involved in the collections procedures.  He asserts he resigned from the law office of Brock &amp; Scott when his attempts to become more active were unsuccessful. \r\n    \r\n  ODC agrees respondent has been very cooperative and forthright in ODC's investigation of these matters. \r\n  \r\n  LAW\r\n Respondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not assist non-lawyer in the unauthorized practice of law) and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We find that respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand.  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26400","title":"In the Matter of John A.

While\r\n  Sandlapper was described as a â€œclosing coordination company,â€ respondent agrees\r\n  that, due to the services it provided, Sandlapper was, in fact, a law firm. Â Â \r\nFrom 2003 through 2005, Sandlapper\r\n  coordinated closings of approximately 3,000 home equity refinancing loans.[1]Â \r\n  Sandlapper had approximately fifty (50) South Carolina-licensed attorneys at\r\n  various locations throughout the state to attend closings and serve as closing\r\n  attorneys as contemplated by the directives set out in State v. Buyers\r\n    Services Co., Inc., 292 S.C. 426, 357 S.E.2d 15 (1987), and Doe v. Condon 351 S.C. 158, 568 S.E.2d 356 (2002).[2]Â \r\n  Respondent represents that the closing attorneys complied with the first three\r\n  closing steps set forth in Doe v. Condon, id., however, Sandlapperâ€™s\r\n  and the closing attorneysâ€™ involvement in the closings ended after the documents\r\n  were executed and turned over to the lender.Â  Instead, Sandlapper and its\r\n  closings attorneys gave lenders written instructions explaining how the lender\r\n  should record the mortgage and any other closings documents.Â   \r\nIn March 2004, respondent contacted\r\n  Robert Wilcox, Esquire, and sought his advice as to Sandapperâ€™s procedures.Â \r\n  Mr. Wilcox provided respondent with a written opinion which advised, in part,\r\n  â€œlawyerâ€™s involvement or active supervision is required also at earlier stages\r\n  of the title search and the preparation of loan documents and at the later\r\n  stages of recordation and disbursement.â€Â  Thereafter, respondent reformed\r\n  Sandlapperâ€™s closing practices to address Mr. Wilcoxâ€™s recommendations, except\r\n  that respondent continued to allow lenders to record their own mortgages through\r\n  reliance on the written instructions provided by Sandlapper. Â In summary, no\r\n  attorney supervised the recordation of the mortgages or other legal documents.[3]Â   \r\nIn mitigation, ODC is unaware of any\r\n  damages to clients or lenders as a result of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  Further,\r\n  ODC recognizes that lenders were most at risk from respondentâ€™s misconduct yet,\r\n  according to respondent, lenders preferred to record their own mortgages\r\n  without attorney involvement.Â  However, respondent acknowledges that lenders\r\n  cannot authorize variances to Court directives and that errors made in\r\n  recordation by non-attorney supervised lenders might injure subsequent\r\n  assignees of the mortgages.Â   \r\nRespondent warrants that he will make\r\n  every effort toward complying with each and every requirement for the closing\r\n  of real estate transactions as promulgated by the Court.Â  Respondent has fully\r\n  cooperated with ODC in seeking to expeditiously conclude this matter.Â   \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct\r\n  he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule\r\n  5.5 (lawyer shall not assist non-lawyer in unauthorized practice of law); and Rule\r\n  8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes\r\n  grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline\r\n  for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be\r\n  ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully violate a valid order of the\r\n  Supreme Court); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer\r\n  to violate oath of office).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] No purchase money mortgages transactions were\r\n  closed by or under the supervision of Sandlapper.Â   \r\n[2] In 2003, the Court withdrew Doe v. Condon, id., and filed the substitute opinion of Doe v. McMaster, 355\r\n  S.C. 306, 585 S.E.2d 773 (2003).Â   \r\n[3] Further, the lenders made their own disbursements at the closings without any\r\n  supervision from an attorney in violation of Doe Law Firm v. Richardson,\r\n  371 S.C. 14, 585 S.E.2d 773 (2006).Â  In Doe Law Firm, the Court held\r\n  that â€œthe disbursement of funds in the context of residential real estate loan\r\n  closings cannot and should not be separated from the [closing] process as a\r\n  wholeâ€ and, therefore, concluded a lawyer should oversee this step in the\r\n  closing process.Â  Id. S.C. at 18, S.E.2d at 868.Â  The Court delayed the\r\n  effective date of the decision until January 22, 2007, to provide time for\r\n  businesses to adjust their practices to conform to the new rule.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26401","title":"In the Matter of R.

Â During\r\n  that period, Knowles (who did not have signatory authority on respondentâ€™s\r\n  trust account) forged respondentâ€™s name to 88 checks drawn on respondentâ€™s\r\n  trust account, six of which were written after her termination by respondent. Â Seventeen\r\n  of the forged checks exceed $5,100.Â  All of the forged checks were made payable\r\n  to Knowles, her husband, or her children.  \r\nNot until after making the self-report to ODC did respondent request his bank notify ODC of any overdrafts on his trust\r\n  account as required by Rule 1.15(h), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  In response to\r\n  inquires from ODC, respondent represented that he had in fact written the\r\n  requisite letter to his bank shortly after it became a requirement on October\r\n  1, 2005, but did not mail the letter to the bank and only discovered he had not\r\n  done so when he found the letter in preparation of a response to inquires from\r\n  ODC.Â   \r\nRespondent did not review cancelled\r\n  checks from his trust account until he received notice of the overdraft from\r\n  his title insurance carrier in June 2006.Â  Respondent did not review the\r\n  cancelled checks from his trust account notwithstanding the requirements of\r\n  Rule 1.15(a), RPC, and Rule 417, SCACR, which mandate monthly reconciliation of\r\n  bank statements with trust account records. Â Â Respondent recognizes that his\r\n  failure to fully comply with the published directives of the Court and his\r\n  failure to more closely supervise Knowles enabled Knowles to commit\r\n  embezzlement and when compliance with the directives would have revealed the\r\n  checks she was forging and the resulting shortages in respondentâ€™s trust\r\n  account.Â   \r\nRespondent admits that, as a result of\r\n  his failure to comply with Rule 1.15, RPC, and Rule 417, SCACR, he did not\r\n  provide clients with competent or diligent representation.Â  Further, he admits\r\n  he allowed monies belonging to one client to be used for the benefit of another\r\n  as a result of the necessity of â€œlappingâ€ of monies in his trust account due to\r\n  shortages caused by Knowlesâ€™ embezzlement.Â Â   \r\nIn mitigation, respondent has been\r\n  continuously engaged in the practice of law in this state since 1995 and has\r\n  not previously been the subject of any disciplinary complaint.Â  Respondent\r\n  self-reported this matter to ODC and has fully cooperated with ODCâ€™s inquiries\r\n  and efforts to conclude this matter expeditiously.Â  During a portion of the\r\n  period in which the embezzlement occurred, respondent was dealing with a\r\n  serious personal health problem and the death of three close family members.Â \r\n \r\nFurther, with the best interests of his\r\n  clients in mind, respondent had the foresight to:Â  1) obtain fidelity insurance\r\n  coverage in the amount of $100,000 (which has been paid in full towards the\r\n  amounts embezzled); 2) deposit $43,000 of his personal funds into the trust\r\n  account to cover the shortages caused by Knowlesâ€™ embezzlement;[3] and 3) obtain through errors and omissions coverage and insured closing\r\n  arrangements with his title company ample funds available to compensate all\r\n  victims of Knowlesâ€™ embezzlement, except for possibly himself.Â  Â Â \r\nSince discovering the embezzlement,\r\n  respondent has implemented additional office management procedures designed to\r\n  more effectively safeguard his clientsâ€™ funds and to more closely supervise his\r\n  staff.Â  Respondent represents he is how fully complying with the requirements\r\n  of Rule 1.15(h), RPC, and Rule 417, SCACR, and will make every effort to strictly\r\n  comply in the future.Â  Further, respondent represents that his trust account is\r\n  now balanced.Â  ODC believes these representations to be correct.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct\r\n  he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation);\r\n  Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence in representing client); Rule\r\n  1.15(a) (lawyer shall safekeep client funds);Â  Rule 1.15(g) (lawyer shall not\r\n  use entrusted property for benefit of any person other than the owner of the\r\n  property); Rule 1.15(h) (lawyer shall file written directive with financial\r\n  institution to report to Commission on Lawyer Conduct when instrument is\r\n  returned against trust account for insufficient funds); Rule 5.3(a) (lawyer\r\n  shall make reasonable efforts to ensure firm has measures giving reasonable\r\n  assurances that non-lawyer employeeâ€™s conduct is compatible with professional\r\n  obligations of lawyer); Rule 5.3(b) (lawyer having direct supervisory authority\r\n  over non-lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure non-lawyerâ€™s conduct is\r\n  compatible with professional obligations of lawyer); Rule 5.3(c)(2) (lawyer\r\n  shall be responsible for conduct of non-lawyer if he has supervisory authority\r\n  over non-lawyer and knows of the non-lawyerâ€™s conduct at a time when its\r\n  consequences can be avoided but fails to take remedial action); and Rule 8.4(a)\r\n  (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct).Â  In addition, respondent admits the he violated the recordkeeping\r\n  provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct\r\n  constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\n  discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The check had been written to pay off a first\r\n  lien in connection with a real estate transaction in which respondent had\r\n  served as the closing attorney.\r\n[2] Respondent advised the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Office of this matter.Â  On\r\n  June 26, 2006, Knowles was charged with Breach of Trust with Fraudulent Intent\r\n  greater than a value of $5,000.Â   \r\n[3] Respondent has lost approximately $28,000 in\r\n  embezzled money which represented his portion of title insurance premiums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Assistant Deputy\r\n  Attorney General, and Robert E. Bogan, both of Columbia, for Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tDesa A. Ballard, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to disbarment.Â  Respondent requests that the date of disbarment be\r\n  retroactive to the date of interim suspension.[1]Â \r\n  We accept the Agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this\r\n  state, retroactive to March 22, 2006.Â  The facts, as set forth in the\r\n  Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nBetween\r\n  May 1, 2002, and March 1, 2004, respondent, who was engaged in the business of\r\n  closing residential mortgage loans, closed certain transactions as part of a\r\n  two-transaction â€œflip,â€ using loan proceeds intended to fund only the second\r\n  transaction to fund both.Â  Respondent also lent funds from his trust account to\r\n  one or more â€œstraw menâ€ purchasers on certain occasions to effect these\r\n  transactions.Â  In connection with these â€œflipâ€ transactions, respondent\r\n  prepared HUD-1 closing statements containing false representations and/or\r\n  omissions that were material to the transactions.Â  Respondent also permitted\r\n  borrowers to certify that the properties purchased would be owner-occupied as a\r\n  primary residence, a condition for loan approval, when he knew that was not\r\n  true.Â   \r\nRespondent submitted the false certifications and HUD-1 closing\r\n  statements to lenders through the United States Mail and through private and\r\n  commercial carriers.Â  Respondent was charged with one count of conspiracy to\r\n  commit mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371, a felony under federal law\r\n  and a serious crime under Rule 2(aa), Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Respondent pled guilty\r\n  in federal court to the charged offense and was sentenced to forty-one monthsâ€™\r\n  imprisonment.Â  The indictment and plea were related to one of the closings\r\n  mentioned hereinabove.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:\r\n  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.4\r\n  (lawyer shall consult with the\r\n  client about any relevant limitation on the lawyerâ€™s conduct when the lawyer\r\n  knows the client expects assistance not permitted by the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or other law); Rule 1.8 (lawyer shall not provide financial\r\n  assistance to a client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of clients in the lawyerâ€™s\r\n  possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own\r\n  property); Rule 4.1 (in the course\r\n  of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of\r\n  material fact or law to a third person or fail to disclose a material fact when\r\n  disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a\r\n  client); Rule 8.4(a) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a\r\n  criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness\r\n  or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule\r\n  8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct\r\n  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it\r\n  is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is\r\n  prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent\r\n  further admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (be convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or a\r\n  serious crime); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for\r\n  discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice, bring the courts or legal profession into disrepute,\r\n  or demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be a\r\n  ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the oath of office).Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent admits his misconduct violated Rule 417, SCACR.\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and disbar\r\n  respondent from the practice of law in this state retroactive to March 22, 2006.Â \r\n  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the\r\n  Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was placed on interim suspension by order\r\n  of this Court dated March 22, 2006.Â  In the Matter of Newton, 368 S.C.\r\n  171, 628 S.E.2d 883 (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Robinson, of Camden, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.Â  In the Agreement,\r\n  respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a range of sanctions from a confidential\r\n  admonition to a sixty day suspension pursuant to Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.Â  Respondent requests any suspension be made retroactive to the date of his\r\n  interim suspension.[1]&nbsp; We \r\naccept the agreement and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this \r\nstate for sixty days, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent,\r\n  who was a public defender at the time, failed to appear for a case and another\r\n  public defender picked the jury on his behalf.Â  Respondent appeared for trial\r\n  the following day, but asked for a continuance on the grounds that he had been\r\n  ill and was unprepared.Â  While respondent maintains he informed the solicitor\r\n  he was ill, he failed to notify his client of the trial in the belief the case would\r\n  be continued.Â  The trial judge found respondent in contempt and ordered\r\n  respondent to pay the cost of the jury and write a written apology to the\r\n  jurors.Â  Respondent fully complied with the order.Â  Respondent contends he did\r\n  not notify the Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the finding of contempt\r\n  because the sanctioning judge found respondentâ€™s conduct did not amount to an\r\n  ethical violation, a contention the Office of Disciplinary Counsel states it\r\n  has no reason to doubt since the matter was not reported by the sanctioning\r\n  judge.\r\nIn\r\n  this matter and three other matters, respondent failed to respond to the Office\r\n  of Disciplinary Counselâ€™s initial inquiries, Treacy letters,[2] and notices of full investigation.Â \r\n  Respondent maintains he failed to respond to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  because he was suffering from depression.Â  Respondent, who has been diagnosed\r\n  as suffering from depression, has sought help from Lawyers Helping Lawyers, has\r\n  signed a monitoring agreement with them and has been seeing a psychiatrist\r\n  recommended by them as well.Â  In addition, respondent has since met with the\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel and provided information regarding the\r\n  complaints against him, including the three additional complaints, which the\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel states it would have recommended dismissing if\r\n  it had received the requested information from respondent.Â  Finally, respondent\r\n  has fully cooperated with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel since being placed\r\n  on interim suspension.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall\r\n  provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act\r\n  with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a\r\n  lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the\r\n  client to make informed decisions regarding the representation, keep the client\r\n  reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly comply with\r\n  reasonable requests for information); and Rule 8.1(b) (a lawyer in connection\r\n  with a disciplinary matter shall not knowingly\r\n  fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary\r\n  authority).\r\nRespondent also admits that he has violated the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to\r\n  fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority including a\r\n  request for a response); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be a ground for discipline\r\n  for a lawyer to violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law\r\n  in this state).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find a sixty day suspension is the appropriate sanction for\r\n  respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for sixty days,\r\n  retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the\r\n  date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of\r\n  Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was placed on interim suspension by order\r\n  of this Court dated August 17, 2007.Â  In the Matter of Rogers, 375 S.C.\r\n  58, 650 S.E.2d 463 (2007).\r\n[2] In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Jeanette\r\n  Van Ginhoven, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  Petitioner was convicted of\r\n  two counts of murder.Â  After his convictions were affirmed on direct appeal,\r\n  Petitioner brought this action seeking post-conviction relief (PCR) on the\r\n  grounds both his trial counsel and appellate counsel were ineffective.Â  We\r\n  granted certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s denial of relief to Petitioner.Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn June 1, 1997,\r\n  Gwen Utsey reported to the Colleton County Sheriffâ€™s Department that her\r\n  sister-in-law, Hattie Mae Yates, and Yatesâ€™s two-week-old daughter, Moesha, had\r\n  been missing for one day.Â  On June 5, 1997, deputies discovered Hattie Maeâ€™s\r\n  abandoned car in a wooded area near the home of Petitioner and his girlfriend,\r\n  Darlene Winningham.Â  On June 16, 1997, Winningham gave a statement to Detective\r\n  Steve Bazzle in which she claimed Petitioner had killed Hattie Mae and Moesha\r\n  Yates.Â  Winningham informed Detective Bazzle where the bodies were located, but\r\n  denied that she had been involved in the murders or the subsequent â€œcover up.â€Â \r\n  Based on this information, investigators with the sheriffâ€™s department\r\n  recovered the bodies in a make-shift grave.Â   \r\nUpon discovering that Winningham\r\n  had identified him as the primary suspect, Petitioner gave a lengthy statement\r\n  to Detective Bazzle. Â According to Petitioner, Hattie Mae, his crack cocaine\r\n  supplier, drove to his home in Cottageville on the afternoon of May 31, 1997,\r\n  to discuss a crack cocaine transaction.Â  As Hattie Mae waited in her car with\r\n  Moesha, Petitioner went inside the home to retrieve cash for the transaction.Â \r\n  Petitioner claimed that Winningham â€œflipped outâ€ and began shooting when he\r\n  attempted to pay Hattie Mae with $100 that he had taken from Winningham.Â \r\n  Petitioner then stated he attempted to cover up the crime by hiding Hattie\r\n  Maeâ€™s car, burying the bodies, and disposing of the rifle.Â  Following his\r\n  statement, Petitioner led detectives to a pond where he had hidden the murder\r\n  weapon.Â   \r\nBoth Petitioner and Winningham were\r\n  charged with the murders.Â  At Petitionerâ€™s trial, Winningham testified for the\r\n  State.Â  Winningham testified that on May 31, 2007, at around 3:00 p.m., her\r\n  friend drove her and her three children home after taking them to the grocery\r\n  store.Â  According to Winningham, Petitioner came out of the house and told her\r\n  to take the children to their grandfatherâ€™s home.Â  When Winningham returned\r\n  home, Hattie Mae came to the Petitionerâ€™s home and pulled around to the back\r\n  porch.Â  Winningham stated she heard a â€œgun go offâ€ and Petitioner yelled for\r\n  her to check the road to see if there were any cars coming toward the home.Â \r\n  Winningham claimed Petitioner then drove off in Hattie Maeâ€™s car through the\r\n  back yard into a field.Â  Petitioner returned and requested Winninghamâ€™s help\r\n  after he struck a tree.Â  Winningham stated that she saw Hattie Mae lying dead\r\n  on the ground and Moesha lying still in the car seat.Â  Winningham testified\r\n  that over the course of the next three days Petitioner returned to the woods\r\n  several times and engaged the assistance of Kenneth Dale Bazzle, Jr.,\r\n  Winninghamâ€™s oldest son, to empty and burn the contents of Hattie Maeâ€™s car, to\r\n  hide the car in the country, and to bury the victimsâ€™ bodies.Â  Kenneth Dale\r\n  Bazzle corroborated Winninghamâ€™s testimony.Â  Additionally, Kenneth Dale stated\r\n  that Petitioner told him that he had killed Hattie Mae and Moesha.\r\nPetitioner testified in his\r\n  defense.Â  Although he recounted a similar sequence of events as that described\r\n  in the Stateâ€™s case, he adamantly denied that he shot Hattie Mae and Moesha.Â  He\r\n  maintained that Winningham became enraged and fired into Hattie Maeâ€™s car after\r\n  he handed $100 to Hattie Mae for crack cocaine.  \r\nThe trial court submitted two\r\n  counts of murder to the jury.Â  The jury found Petitioner guilty of both counts,\r\n  and the trial court sentenced Petitioner to life imprisonment without parole\r\n  and a consecutive thirty-year term.Â   \r\nAfter his\r\n  convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, Petitioner filed for PCR.Â  In his\r\n  application, Petitioner asserted he was being held unlawfully because:Â  (1) his\r\n  convictions and sentences for two counts of murder were unconstitutional in\r\n  that they constituted a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause; (2) the\r\n  solicitor made improper comments during his closing argument; (3)\r\n  after-discovered evidence required reversal of his convictions and sentences;\r\n  and (4) his trial counsel and appellate counsel were ineffective.Â \r\n  Subsequently, Petitioner amended his petition to include an allegation that\r\n  after-discovered evidence revealed one of the jurors knew him from being\r\n  incarcerated in the same facility and shared this information with the other\r\n  members of the jury.  \r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge held a hearing on the petition.Â  At the hearing, Petitioner testified\r\n  and presented the testimony of Juror Floyd Walling as well as John D. Bryan,\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel.Â Â  The PCR judge also permitted Petitioner to\r\n  supplement the record with the statement and affidavit of Kenneth Dale Bazzle\r\n  in order to compare the statement with Bazzleâ€™s trial testimony.  \r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge denied Petitioner relief and dismissed his application with\r\n  prejudice.Â  The PCR judge held trial counsel was not ineffective for failing\r\n  to:Â  (1) request specific jury voir dire questions which would\r\n  have uncovered Juror Wallingâ€™s prior relationship with Petitioner; (2) object\r\n  to the solicitorâ€™s improper closing argument; and (3) object to a portion of\r\n  Winninghamâ€™s testimony.Â  Additionally, the PCR judge found appellate counsel\r\n  was not ineffective in presenting Petitionerâ€™s direct appeal to the Court of\r\n  Appeals.Â  Petitioner appeals from this order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered\r\n  adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making\r\n  all significant decisions in the case.â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318,\r\n  331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007), cert.denied, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007).Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is\r\n  entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the PCR\r\n  applicant must show that: (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2) there\r\n  is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the\r\n  trial would have been different.Â  Id. (citing Strickland v.\r\n    Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a\r\n  probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.â€Â  Ard,\r\n  372 S.C. at 331, 642 S.E.2d at 596. â€œFurthermore, when a defendantâ€™s conviction\r\n  is challenged, â€˜the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that,\r\n  absent the errors, the fact finder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting\r\n  guilt.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 695 (1984)).\r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C.\r\n  365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  A PCR courtâ€™s findings will be upheld on\r\n  appeal if there is â€œany evidence of probative value sufficient to support\r\n  them.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThis Court will reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision when it\r\n  is controlled by an\r\n  error of law.â€Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 651, 594 S.E.2d 462,\r\n  465 (2004).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nA.\r\nPetitioner first asserts the PCR judge erred in failing to find\r\n  the presence of Juror Floyd Walling, with whom he had been incarcerated prior\r\n  to trial, constituted a per se violation of his due process right\r\n  to a fair and impartial jury.Â   \r\nDuring voir dire, the trial judge asked the members of the jury pool\r\n  whether any member was â€œrelated by blood or marriageâ€ to Petitioner or was a\r\n  â€œclose personal friend.â€Â  Walling did not respond to this question.Â  Before\r\n  Walling was seated on the jury, his trial counsel had three remaining\r\n  peremptory challenges.  \r\nWhile\r\n  serving his sentence for the two counts of murder, Petitioner discovered that\r\n  he and Juror Walling had been incarcerated together at the Colleton County   Detention Center in 1997.Â  Petitioner made the connection when his cellmate\r\n  noticed that Floyd Walling, the cellmateâ€™s cousin, was listed as a juror on\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s trial transcript.Â  Petitioner remembered Walling after the cellmate\r\n  told him that Walling was also known as â€œRum Gully.â€Â  At the PCR hearing,\r\n  Petitioner testified he did not recognize Walling as the man he knew in prison\r\n  because Walling had shaved his beard and was not wearing prison attire.Â \r\n  Additionally, Petitioner was not aware of Wallingâ€™s given name, but rather,\r\n  knew him as â€œRum Gully.â€Â  Although he was unable to produce documentation,\r\n  Petitioner claimed that he and Walling had altercations while in jail, which\r\n  included incidents where Petitioner threw urine on Walling and struck him with\r\n  a mop.Â Â   \r\nPetitioner\r\n  presented Walling as a witness at the PCR hearing.Â  Walling testified he was\r\n  detained several times for failing to pay child support.Â  While serving this\r\n  time, Walling was assigned to laundry detail.Â  In this capacity, Walling\r\n  encountered Petitioner when he delivered clean clothing to him.Â  Despite this\r\n  interaction, Walling testified that he and Petitioner never spoke to one\r\n  another.Â  He further testified there was an incident where an inmate threw\r\n  urine and feces on him, but he did not know who did it and did not suspect that\r\n  Petitioner was responsible.Â  Walling admitted that while in jail he heard that\r\n  Petitioner was â€œaccused of murder, but that was yet to be proven.â€Â  Walling\r\n  stated that he did recognize Petitioner at the time of trial as the person who\r\n  was being detained in the Colleton County Detention Center in 1997. Â Although\r\n  he did not disclose this information to the trial judge, Walling claimed that\r\n  had the judge inquired whether he knew Petitioner he would have answered\r\n  affirmatively and â€œasked them to dismiss [him] off the jury.â€\r\nIn\r\n  response to questioning by the PCR judge, Walling denied having any bias or\r\n  prejudice against Petitioner.Â  Walling, however, admitted he had told the other\r\n  jurors that he had been incarcerated with Petitioner and that Petitioner â€œwas\r\n  accused of murder, but heâ€™s got to be proven before heâ€™s [convicted].â€  \r\nPetitionerâ€™s\r\n  trial counsel testified that had he known that Walling and Petitioner had been\r\n  incarcerated together, he â€œwould have probably used a peremptory strike.â€ \r\n \r\nIn\r\n  his order, the PCR judge found â€œWallingâ€™s testimony that he had no preexisting\r\n  bias against the [Petitioner] to be highly credible.â€Â  In light of the evidence\r\n  presented at the hearing, the judge believed Walling â€œacted as a fair and\r\n  impartial jurorâ€ and that Petitioner failed to show that Walling prejudiced the\r\n  other jury members by informing them that the two had been incarcerated\r\n  together.Â  The judge reasoned that the jury was â€œclearly aware that [Petitioner]\r\n  was incarcerated at the time of trial but had not been convicted of the crimes\r\n  with which he was charged.â€Â Â   \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing facts, Petitioner contends Juror Wallingâ€™s presence on the\r\n  jury was a per se violation of due process on the ground â€œthe\r\n  circumstances of their relationship created a â€˜presumption of bias.â€™â€[1]Â  Specifically, Petitioner asserts the information revealed by\r\n  Walling to the other jury members â€œcould have had no other effect than to fix\r\n  the image of petitioner as an inmate, hence a criminal, in the jurorsâ€™ minds.â€Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œ[A]\r\n  criminal defendant has no right to a trial by any particular jury, but only a\r\n  right to a trial by a competent and impartial jury.â€Â  Palacio v. State,\r\n  333 S.C. 506, 517, 511 S.E.2d 62, 68 (1999).Â  â€œâ€˜[I]n order to fully safeguard this protection, it is required\r\n  that the jury render its verdict free from outside influences of whatever kind\r\n  and nature.â€™â€Â  State v. Bryant, 354 S.C. 390, 395, 581 S.E.2d 157, 160\r\n  (2003)(quoting State v. Cameron, 311 S.C. 204, 207, 428 S.E.2d 10, 12\r\n  (Ct. App. 1993)).Â   \r\nâ€œTo\r\n  protect both partiesâ€™ right to an impartial jury, the\r\n  trial judge must ask potential jurors whether they are aware of any bias or\r\n  prejudice against a party.â€Â  State v. Woods, 345 S.C. 583, 587, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001).Â  â€œWhen a juror conceals information inquired into\r\n  during voir dire, a new trial is required only when the court finds the\r\n  juror intentionally concealed the information, and that the information\r\n  concealed would have supported a challenge for cause or would have been a\r\n  material factor in the use of the partyâ€™s peremptory challenges.â€ Id.Â  â€œWhere a juror, without justification, fails to disclose a relationship, it may\r\n  be inferred, nothing to the contrary appearing, that the juror is not impartial. On the other\r\n  hand, where the failure to disclose is innocent, no such inference may be\r\n  drawn.â€Â  Id. at 586-87, 550 S.E.2d at 284.\r\nâ€œDetermining\r\n  whether a jurorâ€™s failure to respond to a voir dire question amounts to\r\n  intentional concealment is a â€˜fact\r\n  intensive determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis.â€™â€ State\r\n    v. Guillebeaux, 362 S.C. 270, 274, 607 S.E.2d 99, 101-02 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004)(quoting State v. Sparkman, 358 S.C. 491, 496, 596 S.E.2d 375, 377\r\n  (2004)). â€œIntentional\r\n  concealment occurs â€˜when the question presented to the jury on voir dire is\r\n  reasonably comprehensible to the average juror and the subject of the inquiry\r\n  is of such significance that the jurorâ€™s failure to respond is unreasonable.â€™â€ Id. â€œConcealment is considered unintentional where the voir dire question posed is\r\n  ambiguous or incomprehensible to the average juror or where â€˜the subject of the\r\n  inquiry is insignificant or so far removed in time that the jurorâ€™s failure to\r\n  respond is reasonable under the circumstances.â€™â€Â  Id.  \r\nApplying the above-outlined principles to the facts of the instant\r\n  case, we find the PCR judge properly denied Petitioner relief on this ground.Â \r\n  Here, it was reasonable for Juror Walling to remain silent when asked during voir dire whether any member of the jury pool was â€œrelated by blood or\r\n  marriage or a close personal friend of [Petitioner].â€ Â At the PCR hearing,\r\n  Juror Walling testified that he and Petitioner were not close friends.Â \r\n  Petitioner corroborated Wallingâ€™s testimony when he acknowledged that he did\r\n  not know Walling very well. Â Juror Walling also testified that he did not have\r\n  any bias or prejudice against Petitioner, and he and the other members of the\r\n  jury held the State to its burden of proof before finding Petitioner guilty of\r\n  the two murder charges. Â \r\nBased on Juror Wallingâ€™s testimony at the hearing, we believe that\r\n  Walling did not intentionally conceal the existence of his prior relationship\r\n  with Petitioner.Â  See Guillebeaux, 362 S.C. at 274-75, 607 S.E.2d\r\n  at 101-02 (holding juror did not intentionally conceal existence of social\r\n  relationship with the Stateâ€™s chief witness and, thus, trial judge did not\r\n  abuse his discretion in denying defendantâ€™s motion for a new trial); State\r\n    v. Galbreath, 359 S.C. 398, 403-04, 597 S.E.2d 845 847-48 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding\r\n  juror did not intentionally conceal that juror knew the victimâ€™s mother and\r\n  that jurorâ€™s brother-in-law rented land from someone in victimâ€™s extended\r\n  family where juror accurately answered voir dire question posed\r\n  and the alleged relationships did not amount to close personal friends or\r\n  business associates with any of the witnesses); see also Sparkman,\r\n  358 S.C. at 496-97, 596 S.E.2d at 376-77 (concluding no intentional concealment\r\n  where the judge asked on voir dire whether anyone had been the\r\n  victim of a â€œserious crimeâ€ and seated juror did not immediately recall that he\r\n  had been a victim of a crime forty years earlier and was not sure if the crime\r\n  constituted a â€œseriousâ€ one).Â   \r\nFurthermore, because the disposition of this issue essentially\r\n  involves a credibility determination as to whether Juror Walling intentionally\r\n  concealed his prior relationship with Petitioner, we defer to the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  findings.Â  The PCR judge specifically found Juror Wallingâ€™s testimony to be\r\n  â€œhighly credible.â€Â  Solomon v. State, 313 S.C. 526, 529, 443 S.E.2d 540,\r\n  542 (1994) (stating the Court gives great deference to a PCR courtâ€™s findings\r\n  when matters of credibility are involved); State v. Loftis, 232 S.C. 35,\r\n  45, 100 S.E.2d 671, 675 (1957) (declining to interfere with trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  discretion in matter concerning jury because trial judge has the opportunity to\r\n  consider credibility of jurors).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the judgeâ€™s holding\r\n  that Petitioner did not suffer a per se violation of his due\r\n  process right to a fair and impartial jury.\r\nB.\r\nIn the\r\n  alternative, Petitioner asserts he should receive a new trial because trial\r\n  counsel was ineffective for not requesting appropriate voir dire questions.Â  Petitioner contends that had counsel asked the court to â€œinquire\r\n  about social contacts beyond â€˜close, personalâ€™ friendships and business\r\n  associations,â€ Juror Walling would have come forward and counsel could have\r\n  made a motion to remove him for cause or exercise a peremptory strike.Â   \r\nWithout\r\n  reiterating the above analysis, there is evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision that Petitioner â€œfailed to make the requisite showing of prejudice\r\n  resulting from Counselâ€™s alleged deficiency in regards to additional jury voir\r\n  dire.â€Â  Juror Walling testified that he and the other members of the jury held\r\n  the State to its burden of proof before finding Petitioner guilty.Â \r\n  Additionally, Juror Walling stated that â€œit was a while there before they could\r\n  convince me that heâ€™s the one [that] done it.â€ Â Given Juror Walling and the\r\n  other members of the jury adhered to the requisite standard of proof before\r\n  convicting Petitioner, we find any alleged error by trial counsel did not\r\n  result in a violation of Petitionerâ€™s right to a fair and impartial jury.Â  Â Thus,\r\n  the PCR judge properly denied Petitioner relief on this ground.\r\nII.\r\nNext, Petitioner argues the PCR judge erred in finding trial\r\n  counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to certain portions of the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s closing argument on due process grounds as well as Rule 22 of the\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.Â  Specifically, Petitioner contends\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the solicitorâ€™s comments on\r\n  constitutional due process grounds â€œrather than mere rule violations.â€  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, there was conflicting testimony as to whether Petitioner or his\r\n  girlfriend, Darlene Winningham, shot Hattie Mae Yates and her infant daughter.Â \r\n  In response to this testimony, the solicitor stated during his closing\r\n  argument:\r\n\r\n\tI\r\n  know that [Petitioner] was surprised when those children got there at 3:00 or\r\n  3:30, and that he sent them off.Â  I know that he thought Hattie Mae Yates - - -\r\n\t* *\r\n  *\r\n\tAnd,\r\n  God only knows, I donâ€™t know what the motive for that is, and his Honor will\r\n  charge you that the State is not required to prove a motive.Â  I donâ€™t know\r\n  whether they got mad with each other or what, but I know it happened.Â  I know\r\n  that the person on the porch didnâ€™t kill them. \r\n\t* *\r\n  *\r\n\tYou\r\n  know, Hattie Mae Yates - there may come a time in life where your life doesnâ€™t\r\n  mean much, and I canâ€™t tell you that Hattieâ€™s did, but I can tell you one\r\n  thing.Â  That little girl that was sitting in that car seat she ainâ€™t never done\r\n  anything to anybody.Â  Never in her life has she ever said a bad word.Â  And I\r\n  know she is dead, and sheâ€™s dead at the hands of [Petitioner], and, for that,\r\n  you need to convict him for murder.Â  \r\n\r\nTo\r\n  each of these comments, trial counsel interposed an objection and moved for a\r\n  mistrial based on Rule 22 of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.[2]Â  The trial judge denied the motion for a mistrial.Â  In reaching\r\n  this decision, the judge did not believe â€œthat there was such egregious abuse\r\n  as would suggest that the Solicitor ha[d] invaded the juryâ€™s province of\r\n  deciding whether or not the facts and inferences drawn therefrom would support\r\n  a verdict.â€Â   \r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, trial counsel explained that he objected on the basis of Rule\r\n  22 because he â€œdidnâ€™t really see a huge difference between the constitutional\r\n  rule and the criminal procedural rule.Â  Itâ€™s both preventative and both exist\r\n  for the same reason in order to give him a fair trial.Â  Thatâ€™s the reason for\r\n  both rules.â€Â  The PCR judge also apparently did not see a distinction between\r\n  an objection based on Rule 22 and due process grounds.Â  In denying Petitioner\r\n  relief on this ground, the judge found that â€œCounsel cannot be said to have\r\n  failed to make every reasonable effort to protect the [Petitionerâ€™s] right to a\r\n  fair trial.â€Â  The judge noted that counsel made â€œtimely objections to the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s comments where appropriateâ€ and â€œmoved for a mistrial on the ground\r\n  that the solicitorâ€™s comments constituted a violation of professional ethics.â€Â \r\n  The judge concluded that â€œgiven the overwhelming evidence of [Petitionerâ€™s]\r\n  guilt of the crimes with which he was charged, the [Petitioner] has failed to\r\n  make the requisite showing of prejudice resulting from any alleged deficiency.â€\r\n \r\nDespite\r\n  the PCR judgeâ€™s failure to specifically rule on the distinction made by\r\n  Petitioner in terms of a Rule 22 objection versus an objection based on\r\n  constitutional due process grounds, we believe his ultimate decision that trial\r\n  counsel was not ineffective was correct and is supported by the record.\r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, trial counsel was not deficient in failing to specifically\r\n  object on constitutional grounds.Â  As we view Rule 22, we believe it was\r\n  promulgated on the concepts of due process and fundamental fairness.Â  Our research\r\n  has not revealed any cases which analyze Rule 22.Â  Therefore, Rule 22 is not\r\n  considered distinctly different from an objection based on due process\r\n  principles.Â Â  Accordingly, we hold trial counselâ€™s objection based on Rule 22\r\n  was sufficient to encompass any due process claims alleged by Petitioner.Â  \r\n \r\nEven\r\n  assuming that trial counsel was deficient in not interposing a specific\r\n  objection based on constitutional grounds, Petitioner was not prejudiced by his\r\n  failure to do so.Â  We find that any impropriety in the solicitorâ€™s closing\r\n  argument was not sufficient to warrant the grant of a new trial.\r\nA solicitorâ€™s closing argument must be carefully tailored so\r\n  as not to appeal to the personal biases of the jury.Â  State v. Copeland,\r\n  321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996).Â  The Stateâ€™s closing arguments\r\n  must be confined to evidence in the record and the reasonable inferences that\r\n  may be drawn from the evidence.Â  Id.Â  â€œA solicitor has a right to state\r\n  his version of the testimony and to comment on the weight to be given such\r\n  testimony.â€Â  Randall v. State, 356 S.C. 639, 642, 591 S.E.2d 608, 610\r\n  (2004).Â  However, â€œ[a] solicitor may not vouch for the credibility of a Stateâ€™s\r\n  witness based on personal knowledge or other information outside the record.â€Â  Matthews\r\n    v. State, 350 S.C. 272, 276, 565 S.E.2d 766, 768 (2002).\r\nâ€œOn\r\n  appeal, the appellate court will view the alleged impropriety of the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s argument in the context of the entire record, including whether the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s instructions adequately cured the improper argument and whether\r\n  there is overwhelming evidence of the defendantâ€™s guilt.â€Â  Simmons v. State,\r\n  331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998). â€œImproper comments do not\r\n  automatically require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant,\r\n  and the appellant has the burden of proving he did not receive a fair trial\r\n  because of the alleged improper argument.â€Â  Humphries v. State, 351 S.C.\r\n  362, 373, 570 S.E.2d 160, 166 (2002).Â  â€œThe relevant question is whether the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the\r\n  resulting conviction a denial of due process.â€ Id.; see State\r\n    v. Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121, 129, 484 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1997)(â€œA denial of due process occurs when a defendant in a criminal trial is\r\n  denied the fundamental fairness essential to the concept of justice.â€).Â \r\n  Furthermore, a trial judge is allowed discretion in dealing with the range and propriety of closing argument to the\r\n  jury, and rulings on such matters will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 17, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766\r\n  (1997).  \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the solicitorâ€™s comments were confined to facts established\r\n  during trial and, in the context of the entire record, were not so egregious as\r\n  to have â€œinfected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction\r\n  a denial of due process.â€Â  Von Dohlen v. State, 360 S.C. 598, 609, 602\r\n  S.E.2d 738, 744 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 943 (2005).Â  Although the\r\n  solicitor improperly used the pronoun â€œIâ€ in his closing argument, these\r\n  comments were limited and did not recur throughout his argument.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  there was also overwhelming evidence of Petitionerâ€™s guilt.Â  See State\r\n    v. McFadden, 318 S.C. 404, 416, 458 S.E.2d 61, 68 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding\r\n  the solicitorâ€™s comments did not infect the trial with unfairness to the extent\r\n  that his conviction was a denial of due process where there was ample evidence\r\n  of guilt in the record).Â  Finally, the trial judge charged the jury that â€œ[y]ou\r\n  must not consider as evidence any statement of counsel made during the trial,â€\r\n  and instructed the jury members regarding their duty to â€œpass upon the credibility\r\n  or believability of the witnesses.â€ Â These instructions were sufficient to cure\r\n  any possible prejudice caused by the solicitorâ€™s comments.Â  Therefore, we do\r\n  not believe there was a reasonable probability that the result of the trial\r\n  would have been different had trial counsel objected on due process grounds.Â  \r\n \r\nIII.\r\nFinally, Petitioner argues the PCR judge erred in failing to find\r\n  that appellate counsel was ineffective for briefing the solicitorâ€™s closing\r\n  argument issue as a due process violation rather than raising the Rule 22 procedural\r\n  issue that was presented at trial.Â   \r\nIn his brief to\r\n  the Court of Appeals, Petitionerâ€™s appellate counsel argued â€œthe [trial] court\r\n  erred in violation of due process of law when it repeatedly permitted the solicitor\r\n  to inject his personal opinion that appellant was guilty into a case where the\r\n  key witness had given grossly inconsistent information about the case.â€Â  In an\r\n  opinion pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, the Court of Appeals affirmed\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s convictions on error preservation grounds because the\r\n  constitutional issue raised on appeal had not been raised at trial.Â  State v. James Smith, Op. No. 2002-UP-320 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 3, 2002).\r\nIn his order, the PCR judge found appellate counsel was not ineffective.Â  In reaching this\r\n  decision, the judge noted that appellate counsel had filed a brief pursuant to Anders\r\n    v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and thus, Petitionerâ€™s case had\r\n  received full review by the Court of Appeals.Â  Because appellate counsel filed\r\n  a regular appeal and not an Anders brief on behalf of Petitioner, the\r\n  PCR judge clearly erred in his findings.Â  This error, however, does not warrant\r\n  reversal given that Petitioner is unable to show that any alleged deficiency in\r\n  appellate counselâ€™s performance would have resulted in a different outcome on\r\n  appeal.  \r\nA\r\n  PCR applicant has the burden of proving appellate counselâ€™s performance was\r\n  deficient.Â  Anderson v. State, 354 S.C. 431, 434, 581 S.E.2d 834,\r\n  835 (2003).Â  â€œAlthough appellate counsel is required to provide effective\r\n  assistance of counsel, â€˜appellate counsel is not required to raise every\r\n  nonfrivolous issue that is presented by the record.â€™â€Â  Tisdale v. State,\r\n  357 S.C. 474, 476, 594 S.E.2d 166, 167 (2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S.\r\n  845 (2004) (quoting Thrift v. State, 302 S.C. 535, 539, 397 S.E.2d 523,\r\n  526 (1990)).\r\nBecause trial\r\n  counsel objected to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument pursuant to Rule 22, appellate\r\n  counsel was remiss in failing to brief the specific issue raised at trial.Â  Petitioner,\r\n  however, cannot establish that he was prejudiced by this deficiency.Â  As\r\n  previously discussed trial counselâ€™s objection based on Rule 22 encompassed any\r\n  possible due process claims of the Petitioner.Â  Moreover, the impropriety of\r\n  the solicitorâ€™s closing remarks did not rise to the level which would have\r\n  deprived Petitioner of a fair trial.Â  Therefore, while Petitioner has shown\r\n  error, there is evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling that Petitioner was\r\n  not entitled to relief on this ground.\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing reasons, the order of PCR judge denying Petitioner relief is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The State avers Petitionerâ€™s argument is\r\n  procedurally barred on the ground that it should have been raised in a direct\r\n  appeal.Â  Petitioner, however, did not become aware of his prior relationship\r\n  with Juror Walling until after his direct appeal had been ruled on and he was\r\n  in the process of preparing his petition for post-conviction relief.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Petitionerâ€™s claim for relief is appropriately based on\r\n  â€œafter-discovered evidence.â€Â  Clark v.

State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 184, 610 S.E.2d 305 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We\r\n  granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari and now vacate the Court of\r\n  Appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nFACTS\r\nRorey Jamar Johnson\r\n  (Johnson) was charged with the murder of Gregory W. Whitaker (Whitaker).Â \r\n  Crystal Marion, Alton Henderson, and Michael Jones, Jr. were allegedly with Johnson\r\n  when the murder occurred, and all three testified at trial for the State.Â \r\n \r\nCrystal\r\n  Marion was the first witness to testify at trial.Â  When asked whether the third\r\n  and final statement she gave to the police was the whole truth, Marion answered: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tWell,\r\n  the second statement was the truth as well, but, therefore, they kind of made\r\n  me feel like I was lying because I didnâ€™t pass the polygraph test.Â  And the\r\n  second one...Â  \r\n\r\nAt\r\n  that point, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, which the trial judge denied.Â \r\n  The judge instructed the jury to disregard the reference to the polygraph. \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Johnson guilty of murder.Â  The trial court granted Johnsonâ€™s motion\r\n  for a new trial based upon Marionâ€™s reference to the polygraph.Â  The State\r\n  appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tI.&nbsp; Does the State have a right to\r\n  appeal an order granting a new trial\r\n  when no error of law exists?\r\n\tII.&nbsp; If the State has a right to\r\n  appeal, did the Court of Appeals err in\r\n  affirming the trial courtâ€™s order granting a new trial based upon testimony\r\n  concerning polygraph test results?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS  \r\nJohnson contends that the State had no right to appeal in this\r\n  case.Â  We agree.\r\nThe State may only appeal a new trial order if, in granting it, the\r\n  trial judge committed an error of law. State v. DesChamps, 126 S.C. 416,\r\n  120 S.E. 491 (1923).Â  An error of law exists where a trial judge directed a\r\n  verdict of acquittal after a jury verdict of guilty when there was evidence to\r\n  support the jury verdict. State v. Dasher, 278 S.C. 395, 297 S.E.2d 414\r\n  (1982).Â  When determining whether an error of law exists, and therefore whether\r\n  the State has a right to an appeal, it is necessary to consider the merits of\r\n  the case.Â   \r\nA trial judge has the discretion to grant or deny a motion for a\r\n  new trial, and his decision will not be reversed absent a clear abuse of\r\n  discretion. State v. Simmons, 279 S.C. 165, 166, 303 S.E.2d 857, 858\r\n  (1983).Â  The general rule is that no\r\n  mention of a polygraph test should be placed before the jury.Â  It is thus\r\n  incumbent upon the trial judge to ensure that should such a reference be made,\r\n  no improper inference be drawn therefrom. Â State v. McGuire, 272 S.C.\r\n  547, 551, 253 S.E.2d 103, 105 (1979).Â   \r\nThe trial judge found that Marionâ€™s statement about a polygraph\r\n  test prejudiced Johnson.Â  Because the case against Johnson essentially\r\n  consisted of witness testimony, the credibility of each witness was crucial to\r\n  the verdict.Â  Marionâ€™s statement created an inference that bolstered the\r\n  credibility of the Stateâ€™s witnesses.Â  The jury could have believed that the\r\n  State made each witness pass a polygraph test before they were able to testify\r\n  at trial as part of their individual plea bargains. The trial judge did not\r\n  abuse his discretion by granting a new trial.\r\nWe find that there is no error of law because the trial judge did\r\n  not abuse his discretion. Â Absent an error of law, the State had no right to\r\n  appeal the new trial order. See State v. DesChamps, supra. \r\n \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe vacate the Court\r\n  of Appealsâ€™ opinion and dismiss the Stateâ€™s appeal.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™\r\n  opinion is\r\nVACATED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  MOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice Dorothy Mobley Jones, concur.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26407","title":"Coakley v.

Co., 363 S.C. 147, 609 S.E.2d 537 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We\r\n  granted Horace Mannâ€™s and the Mitchellâ€™s petition for certiorari and now reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  August 19, 1994, Coakley was a passenger in a car being driven by Scott\r\n  Mitchell (Scott).Â  Scott drove the vehicle off the road and collided with a\r\n  tree.Â  As a result of the one-car accident, Coakley is a permanent\r\n  quadriplegic.\r\nThe automobile\r\n  driven by Scott in the accident, a 1984 Mazda RX-7, was owned by Scottâ€™s older\r\n  brother, Christopher Mitchell (Christopher).Â  At the time of the accident,\r\n  Christopher was a student at Clemson University, lived in an apartment in\r\n  Clemson during the school year, and was the primary user of the Mazda RX-7.Â \r\n  Scott was a high school student and lived with his and Christopherâ€™s mother,\r\n  Claudia â€œDee Deeâ€ Mitchell (Dee Dee).Â  At the time of the accident, Christopher\r\n  was away on a trip and left the car at his motherâ€™s house, and Scott had\r\n  permission to use the car.\r\nHorace Mann insured\r\n  Christopherâ€™s Mazda RX-7, and Dee Dee was the named insured.[1]Â \r\n  Horace Mann tendered the full liability limit of $50,000 to Coakley from this\r\n  policy.Â  In addition, Dee Dee maintained policies on three other vehicles; two\r\n  of these policies carried liability limits of $50,000, and another policy had a\r\n  liability limit of $250,000.Â  All policies purchased by Dee Dee extended\r\n  liability protection for the operation of non-owned cars.\r\nAs part of the\r\n  settlement of the policy limits for the Mazda RX-7, the trust and Horace Mann\r\n  entered into a covenant not to execute.Â  Pursuant to the covenant, Horace Mann\r\n  tendered the $50,000 limit from the policy covering the Mazda RX-7 and allowed\r\n  the trust to bring a declaratory judgment action to determine the applicability\r\n  of Dee Deeâ€™s three additional policies.Â  In exchange, the trust agreed that its\r\n  recovery, if any, would be limited to $350,000, which was the combined total of\r\n  the three policies.\r\nThe trust then instituted\r\n  this declaratory judgment action alleging that the three additional policies\r\n  provided excess automobile liability coverage for the Mazda RX-7.Â  The trust\r\n  claimed that the Mazda RX-7 was a non-owned vehicle because Christopher owned\r\n  the car and was not a relative as defined in the policies.\r\nThe parties agreed\r\n  to transfer the case to a non-jury docket and then agreed to submit the case to\r\n  a circuit court judge with memoranda of authority, copies of the policies in\r\n  dispute, and the deposition testimony of Dee Dee, Christopher, and Scott\r\n  Mitchell.Â  The circuit court then issued an order finding excess liability\r\n  coverage was available to Coakley under all three policies, resulting in the\r\n  recovery of $350,000.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tI.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the Court of Appeals err in holding that Christopher Mitchell was not a\r\n  dependent of Dee Dee Mitchell, thereby triggering excess liability coverage?\r\n\tII.&nbsp; If excess\r\n  liability coverage is applicable, did the Court of Â  Appeals err in failing to\r\n  apply policy provisions that purport to limit the  amount of excess coverage\r\n  available to Coakley?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nHorace Mann argues\r\n  that the Mazda RX-7 owned by Christopher does not qualify as a non-owned\r\n  vehicle under Dee Deeâ€™s policies, thus excess liability coverage is not\r\n  available for Coakley.[2]Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nA declaratory\r\n  judgment action is neither legal nor equitable, and it is determined by the\r\n  nature of the underlying issue. Â Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354,\r\n  356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). Â An insurance policy is a contract between the\r\n  insured and the insurance company, and the terms of the policy are to be\r\n  construed according to contract law. Â Est. of Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C.\r\n  470, 476, 484 S.E.2d 112, 115 (Ct. App. 1997). Â In an action at law, on appeal\r\n  of a case tried without a jury, we may not disturb the trial judgeâ€™s findings\r\n  of fact unless those findings are â€œwholly unsupported by the evidence or unless\r\n  it clearly appears the findings are controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Cohenâ€™s\r\n    Drywall Co. v. Sea Spray Homes, LLC, 374 S.C. 195, 198, 648 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  600-601 (2007).Â Â   \r\nUnder\r\n  each policy, Scott has excess liability insurance coverage for non-owned cars.Â \r\n  The provision in each policy reads:\r\nCOVERAGE FOR USE OF OTHER CARS\r\n\r\n\tBodily\r\n  injury and property damage liability coverages extend to the use, by an\r\n  insured, ofâ€¦ a non-owned car while being used with the permission of the\r\n  driver.[3]\r\n\r\nA non-owned\r\n  car is defined in the policies as a private passenger car or utility vehicle\r\n  not: (1) owned by; (2) registered in the name of; or (3) furnished or available\r\n  for the regular or frequent use of the insured or the insuredâ€™s relatives.Â Â Â \r\n  Dee Dee, the named insured, did not have the title or registration to the Mazda\r\n  RX-7 in her name, nor was the Mazda RX-7 available for her regular or frequent\r\n  use.Â  Horace Mann claims that Christopher is one of Dee Deeâ€™s relatives, which\r\n  would preclude the Mazda RX-7 from qualifying as a non-owned vehicle.Â   \r\nA\r\n  relative is defined in the Horace Mann policies as â€œa person related to you by\r\n  blood, marriage or adoption who lives with you.Â  It includes your unmarried and\r\n  dependent child who is away at school.â€Â  At the time of the accident,\r\n  Christopher was not married and did not live with his mother while he was away\r\n  at Clemson.Â  The issue becomes whether Christopher was a dependent of Dee Dee.Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court determined that Christopher was not dependent on his mother and\r\n  the Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Although Christopher stated he did not receive\r\n  money from his mother[4] and that his father would give him a lump sum of money per semester for\r\n  tuition, books, rent, and living expenses, this type of financial assistance to\r\n  a college student is not the sine qua non of dependency.Â  In other words,\r\n  the issue of Christopherâ€™s dependency is not solely a question of who paid the\r\n  majority of his school expenses.\r\nThe\r\n  fact that Christopherâ€™s father may have provided the bulk of Christopherâ€™s\r\n  financial support at Clemson does not mean that Christopher was not also\r\n  dependent upon his mother.Â  Dee Dee claimed Christopher as a dependent on her\r\n  income tax returns, albeit pursuant to a court order, and she and Christopherâ€™s\r\n  father shared costs for Christopherâ€™s medical expenses.Â  In addition, Dee Dee\r\n  paid for Christopherâ€™s car taxes and insurance.Â  Other evidence of\r\n  Christopherâ€™s dependency includes Dee Deeâ€™s co-signing on the lease for\r\n  Christopherâ€™s apartment at Clemson and the fact that Dee Dee maintained a bedroom\r\n  at her house[5] to which Christopher often returned on weekends.Â  \r\n \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the crucial factual finding that Christopher was not a dependent of Dee Dee is\r\n  wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  As a result, Christopher is a relative of\r\n  Dee Dee under the Horace Mann policy, the Mazda RX-7 does not constitute a\r\n  non-owned vehicle, and excess liability coverage is not available to Coakley.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that Coakley was entitled to excess liability\r\n  coverage because it was predicated on the finding that Christopher Mitchell was\r\n  not a dependent of Dee Dee Mitchell.Â  In light of our holding, it is not\r\n  necessary to determine whether the Horace Mann policy limited the amount of\r\n  excess coverage available to Coakley.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (appellate\r\n  court need not address remaining issue when determination of prior issue is\r\n  dispositive).Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B.

Stone, 350 S.C.\r\n  442, 567 S.E.2d 544 (2002) (remanding for a new sentencing proceeding based on\r\n  the improper exclusion of a juror from the penalty phase, the failure to charge\r\n  the statutory mitigator addressing the defendantâ€™s impairment or mentality at\r\n  the time of the crime, and the failure to instruct the jury that a life sentence\r\n  meant life imprisonment without the possibility of parole).Â  This Court\r\n  remanded the case to the trial court to conduct a second sentencing\r\n  proceeding.Â  Id.Â   \r\nOn remand, the State called\r\n  several members of the victimâ€™s family and former co-workers as witnesses.Â  The\r\n  record reveals that the primary purpose of these witnessesâ€™ testimonies was to\r\n  describe the impact of the victimâ€™s death on these individuals and on the\r\n  community.Â  One such witness was the victimâ€™s widow, and in response to a\r\n  question regarding â€œsignificant events in her lifeâ€ since the murder, the\r\n  victimâ€™s widow testified that she had attempted suicide after learning that\r\n  this Court had reversed Appellantâ€™s initial death sentence and that there would\r\n  be another sentencing proceeding in this case.Â  At the conclusion of the second\r\n  sentencing proceeding, the jury sentenced Appellant to death.\r\nThis appeal followed, and\r\n  Appellant raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the victimâ€™s widowâ€™s testimony\r\n  regarding her suicide attempt impermissibly inject an arbitrary factor into the\r\n  juryâ€™s deliberations?Â  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAppellant argues that the\r\n  victimâ€™s widowâ€™s testimony regarding her suicide attempt impermissibly injected\r\n  an arbitrary factor into the juryâ€™s deliberations.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellantâ€™s argument is not\r\n  preserved for review.Â  At trial, Appellant objected as the victimâ€™s widow began\r\n  to describe her suicide attempt.Â  The record reveals that Appellant based his\r\n  objection on causation grounds, arguing that the testimony implied that the\r\n  cause of the suicide attempt was not the victimâ€™s murder, but the financial\r\n  pressures the victimâ€™s widow was experiencing and the fact that Appellant would\r\n  have another sentencing proceeding.Â  In allowing the testimony, the trial court\r\n  held that the victimâ€™s widow had attributed the facts relayed in the testimony\r\n  to her relationship with the victim, and that the testimony was therefore\r\n  relevant and admissible.\r\nAppellantâ€™s argument before\r\n  this Court goes along quite different lines.Â  Appellant now argues that the\r\n  victimâ€™s widowâ€™s testimony improperly invited the jury to speculate about the\r\n  finality of its decision on the appropriate punishment and improperly invited\r\n  the jury to consider how its decision might impact the victimâ€™s widowâ€™s future\r\n  health.Â  Thus, while Appellantâ€™s argument below focused on what caused the\r\n  victimâ€™s widow to attempt suicide - meaning, what caused the testimony to be\r\n  relevant - Appellantâ€™s argument on appeal abandons the issue of relevance and addresses\r\n  only the effect this testimony may have had on the jury.Â  Because Appellant did\r\n  not argue these grounds in support of his objection at trial, Appellantâ€™s\r\n  argument is not preserved for review.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C.\r\n  138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003) (providing that in order for an issue\r\n  to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial court).\r\nAppellant alleges that his\r\n  argument on appeal is simply an augmentation of his objection at trial, but a thoughtful\r\n  examination reveals that this is not so.Â  Primarily, Appellantâ€™s objection at\r\n  trial was based on relevance, and that issue has been abandoned here.Â  Second,\r\n  whether the suicide attempt by the victimâ€™s spouse minimized the juryâ€™s sense\r\n  of responsibility (by suggesting that the juryâ€™s ultimate decision would be\r\n  subject to review by a higher court) or maximized the juryâ€™s sense of\r\n  responsibility (by implying that imposing a life sentence might lead the\r\n  victimâ€™s widow to attempt suicide again), these considerations are wholly independent\r\n  of the relevance argument presented below.Â  If a pitch was never thrown at\r\n  trial, we cannot review whether the trial court made the proper call.[1]\r\nFor these reasons, we hold\r\n  that Appellantâ€™s argument is not preserved for review.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  affirm Appellantâ€™s sentence.Â  Our review of similar prior cases illustrates\r\n  that imposing the death sentence in this case would be neither excessive nor\r\n  disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.Â  See State v. Sapp, 366\r\n  S.C. 283, 621 S.E.2d 883 (2005) (holding that\r\n  the death penalty was warranted where defendant killed a law enforcement\r\n  officer while the officer was performing his official duties); State v.\r\n    Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 (1999) (same); and State v.\r\n      Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991) (same).\r\nMOORE, WALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] It is important to note that in State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406\r\n  S.E.2d 315 (1991), we held that South Carolinaâ€™s strict error preservation\r\n  rules are no less applicable in death penalty cases.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26409","title":"Curiel v.

Property &amp; Casualty\r\n  Insurance Guaranty Association (Fund) is responsible for benefits.\r\nThe single commissioner found Claimant had a\r\n  compensable injury to his right eye and awarded permanent benefits based on a\r\n  60% loss of use.Â  The commissioner denied temporary total benefits.Â  Claimant,\r\n  Employer, and Fund all appealed.Â  The Commissionâ€™s Appellate Panel (hereinafter\r\n  â€œthe Commissionâ€) adopted the findings of the single commissioner but found\r\n  Claimant suffered only a 41.5% loss of use of his right eye rather than 60%.Â \r\n  Again, all parties appealed.  \r\nThe circuit court found Claimant\r\n  should have been awarded temporary total benefits, and the award of permanent\r\n  benefits should have taken into consideration the combined effect of the injury\r\n  to Claimantâ€™s right eye and the pre-existing loss of vision in his left eye.Â \r\n  The circuit court remanded to the Commission to determine benefits\r\n  accordingly.Â  Employer and Fund appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDoes federal law preempt \r\n\t\t\tentitlement under our Workerâ€™s Compensation Act?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tIs there substantial evidence to \r\n\t\t\tsupport the commissionerâ€™s findings regarding maximum medical \r\n\t\t\timprovement and temporary total benefits?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in \r\n\t\t\tremanding for the Commission to consider a pre-existing impairment \r\n\t\t\tto Claimantâ€™s left eye?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4. \r\n\t\t\tIs the Fund liable for this \r\n\t\t\tclaim?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Preemption under federal law\r\nClaimant is a Mexican national and\r\n  is admittedly an illegal alien worker.Â  He used fraudulent documents to\r\n  misrepresent his legal status when applying for the job with Employer in 1997.Â \r\n  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-130 (Supp. 2006), for purposes of workersâ€™\r\n  compensation, â€œemployeeâ€ is defined as:\r\n\r\n\tEvery person engaged in an employment .\r\n  . . including aliens and also including minors, whether lawfully or\r\n    unlawfully employed.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The single commissioner, the Commission,\r\n  and the circuit court all found Claimant was entitled to benefits under the\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.\r\nEmployer contends Claimant is not entitled to\r\n  benefits because federal law preempts state law regarding the payment of\r\n  benefits to an illegal alien worker.Â  Employer cites the federal Immigration\r\n  Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) which prohibits the hiring of\r\n  unauthorized aliens or the tendering of fraudulent documents to obtain\r\n  employment.Â  8 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1324a &amp; c.Â  Although IRCA contains no specific\r\n  provision forbidding workersâ€™ compensation benefits to illegal alien workers,\r\n  Employer argues that the policy of IRCA prohibiting the hiring of illegal\r\n  aliens conflicts with, and therefore preempts, state law allowing such\r\n  payments.Â   \r\nNorth Carolina, which has the same statutory\r\n  language as Â§ 42-1-130 regarding alien employees, has addressed this precise\r\n  issue and ruled that IRCA does not preempt an award of workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  benefits under state law.Â  Ruiz v. Belk Masonry Co., 559 S.E.2d 249\r\n  (N.C. App. 2002).Â  We find the analysis in Ruiz persuasive.Â  The Ruiz court noted a Congressional report on IRCA stating â€œ[i]t is not the intention\r\n  of the Committee that the employer sanctions provisions of [IRCA] be used to\r\n  undermine or diminish in any way labor protections in existing law. . . .â€Â  Id. at 678.Â  IRCA does not expressly preclude an illegal alien from being considered\r\n  an employee for workersâ€™ compensation benefits, and Ruiz concluded there\r\n  is no indication preemption was intended.Â  Id.Â  Other state\r\n  courts have ruled the same way.Â  See, e.g., Safeharbor Employer\r\n    Servs. I, Inc. v. Cinto Velazquez, 860 So.2d 984 (Fla. App. 2003); Earth\r\n      First Grading &amp; Builders Ins. Group/Assâ€™n Servs, Inc, v. Gutierrez, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 332 (Ga. App. 2004); Design Kitchen and Baths v. Lagos, 882 A.2d\r\n  817 (Md. 2005); Correa v. Waymouth Farms, Inc., 664 N.W.2d 324 (Minn. 2003).Â  \r\n \r\nFurther, allowing benefits to\r\n  injured illegal alien workers does not conflict with the IRCAâ€™s policy against\r\n  hiring them.Â  To the contrary, disallowing benefits would mean unscrupulous\r\n  employers could hire undocumented workers without the burden of insuring them, a\r\n  consequence that would encourage rather than discourage the hiring of illegal\r\n  workers.\r\nWe find IRCA does not preempt state\r\n  law and Claimant is not precluded from benefits under our Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Act.\r\n2.Â  Maximum medical improvement and temporary total\r\n  disability\r\nEmployer contends it was error for\r\n  the circuit court to reverse the commissionerâ€™s findings regarding maximum\r\n  medical improvement and temporary total benefits. We agree.\r\nThe single commissioner found\r\n  Claimant reached maximum medical improvement on October 3, 2002.Â  This is the\r\n  date of a letter from one of Claimantâ€™s treating physicians, Dr. Farr,\r\n  indicating Claimantâ€™s â€œeye condition is stable at this point.â€Â  Dr. Farr\r\n  treated Claimantâ€™s eye pressure which was unacceptably high following the\r\n  retinal detachment injury.Â  Dr. Farr indicated Claimantâ€™s eye pressure was\r\n  controlled with eye drops; he further noted that Claimant should see a low\r\n  vision specialist to evaluate him for glasses.  \r\nOn appeal, the circuit court found\r\n  Claimant could not have reached maximum medical improvement on October 3, 2002,\r\n  in light of Dr. Farrâ€™s recommendation that Claimantâ€™s vision could further\r\n  improve with low vision care.Â  Further, the court found that even if Claimant\r\n  reached maximum medical improvement on October 3, 2002, as found by the\r\n  commissioner, Claimant should have been awarded temporary total benefits from\r\n  the date he was terminated until that date. The circuit court remanded for the\r\n  commissioner to determine the proper award for temporary total benefits.Â  \r\n \r\nEssentially, workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  benefits accrue along a time continuum:Â  temporary total disability benefits\r\n  are available from the date of injury through the date of maximum medical\r\n  improvement;Â  post-MMI benefits may then be awarded either as a permanent total\r\n  or partial disability, or as a percentage of impairment to a scheduled member.Â  Smith v. NCCI, Inc., 369 S.C. 236, 631 S.E.2d 268 (Ct. App. 2006).Â \r\n  Accordingly, the date of maximum medical improvement signals the end of\r\n  entitlement to temporary total benefits.Â   \r\nThe term â€œmaximum medical\r\n  improvementâ€ means a person has reached such a plateau that, in the physicianâ€™s\r\n  opinion, no further medical care or treatment will lessen the period of\r\n  impairment.Â  Hall v. United Rentals, Inc., 371 S.C. 69, 89, 636 S.E.2d\r\n  876, 887 (Ct. App. 2006); Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 81, 564\r\n  S.E.2d 354, 358 (Ct. App. 2002); Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc.,\r\n  334 S.C. 574, 581, 514 S.E.2d 593, 596 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Maximum medical\r\n  improvement is a factual determination by the Commission.Â  Hall, supra.Â \r\n  Factual determinations by the Commission must be upheld on review unless\r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C.\r\n  448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â   \r\nHere, the commissioner found\r\n  Claimant had reached maximum medical improvement based on Dr. Farrâ€™s assessment\r\n  that his eye condition was stable as of October 3, 2002.Â  The fact that\r\n  Claimantâ€™s sight could have been improved with corrective lenses does not\r\n  impact his impairment rating.Â  Evidence that loss of vision might be reduced by\r\n  the use of corrective lenses is not to be considered in determining impairment\r\n  to vision for purposes of workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  Dykes v. Daniel\r\n    Constr. Co., 262 S.C. 98, 106, 202 S.E.2d 646, 650 (1974); see also S.C.\r\n  Reg. 67-1105A (â€œLoss of vision is based on reading without corrective lenses.â€).Â \r\n  The commissionerâ€™s finding regarding the date of maximum medical improvement is\r\n  therefore supported by the record and the circuit court erred in reversing this\r\n  finding.\r\nFurther, the circuit court held in\r\n  the alternative that if Claimant did reach maximum medical improvement on\r\n  October 3, 2002, he should have received temporary total benefits from the date\r\n  of his termination until that date. Â Â \r\nClaimant was terminated from his\r\n  job on January 21, 2002, more than two years after his accident.Â  He testified\r\n  he was fired when Employer learned Claimantâ€™s vision was worse than it seemed.Â \r\n  Claimant stated that he pretended to see better than he actually could in order\r\n  to keep his job.Â  Employerâ€™s president testified:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\t[Claimant] was told until he got \r\n\t\t\this vision corrected he couldnâ€™t work.&nbsp; He came in the office \r\n\t\t\tone day and acted like he was drunk, and I, you know, asked him, and \r\n\t\t\the said he couldnâ€™t see. . . .\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tSo he was, I guess - are we \r\n\t\t\tsaying was he terminated, or is it that if his vision is corrected, \r\n\t\t\theâ€™s got a job?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tYeah, I wouldnâ€™t have any \r\n\t\t\tproblem hiring him back if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his vision is \r\n\t\t\tcorrected.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nClaimantâ€™s termination form indicates he would be considered\r\n  for rehiring but â€œneed[s] to have his eyes fixed before rehire.â€Â   \r\nThe commissioner concluded Claimant\r\n  was not entitled to temporary total benefits because Claimant had exaggerated\r\n  the degree of his vision loss.Â  The commissioner found:\r\n\r\n\tHad the Claimant been honest with his\r\n  physicians concerning the sight in his right eye, a corrective lens could have\r\n  been provided, and the Claimant could have worked.Â  \r\n\r\nThe record supports the\r\n  commissionerâ€™s finding that Claimantâ€™s failure to cooperate with his physicians\r\n  resulted in his uncorrected vision and resulting inability to work.Â  Dr. Farr\r\n  testified he suspected Claimant was exaggerating his vision loss and that it\r\n  was difficult to assess Claimantâ€™s actual vision.Â  Claimantâ€™s vision in his\r\n  right eye was evaluated by Dr. Morse at 20/80 after the date of maximum medical\r\n  improvement.Â  Tests performed by Dr. Morse indicated that Claimantâ€™s earlier\r\n  assessment at 20/300 to 20/400 was inaccurate and that Claimant was not fully\r\n  cooperating in the vision testing.Â  Dr. Farr explained that a patientâ€™s vision\r\n  cannot be corrected without accurate feedback from the patient.Â  This evidence\r\n  supports the commissionerâ€™s conclusion that Claimantâ€™s failure to cooperate was\r\n  the cause of his uncorrected vision.\r\nIn conclusion, the commissionerâ€™s\r\n  findings regarding maximum medical improvement and temporary total disability\r\n  are supported by the record and should not have been reversed by the circuit\r\n  court.\r\n3.Â \r\n  Pre-existing loss of vision in left eye\r\nThe commissioner concluded Claimant\r\n  had suffered an impairment of 60% to his right eye.Â  The Commission reduced\r\n  this award to 41.5% which is the impairment rating for an uncorrected vision of\r\n  20/80, the assessment given by Dr. Morse.Â  See S.C. Reg. 67-1105C.Â  The\r\n  circuit court found the Commission should have considered the impaired vision\r\n  in Claimantâ€™s left eye in determining an impairment rating.Â  Employer contends\r\n  this was error.\r\nClaimant testified that before the injury to his\r\n  right eye on April 12, 2000, he had a work-related injury to his left eye and\r\n  he can see only light and dark from that eye.Â  All of the medical evidence corroborates\r\n  that Claimant has little or no vision in his left eye and there is physical\r\n  evidence of an old injury to that eye.Â   \r\nUnder the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, an injured\r\n  claimant is entitled to compensation and medical benefits for disability arising\r\n  from a permanent physical impairment in combination with a pre-existing\r\n  impairment if the combined effect results in a substantially greater\r\n  disability.Â  Ellison v. Frigidaire Home Prods., 371 S.C. 159, 638 S.E.2d\r\n  664 (2006) (applying S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2005)).Â  The\r\n  Commission erred as a matter of law in failing to consider Claimantâ€™s\r\n  pre-existing impairment in his left eye in combination with the injury to his\r\n  right eye in determining his impairment rating.Â  The circuit court properly\r\n  reversed and remanded on this issue.\r\n5.Â \r\n  Claimantâ€™s residency\r\nIn addition to the issues raised by Employer, the\r\n  Fund contends it is not liable for Claimantâ€™s claim because Claimant is not a South Carolina resident.Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-31-20(8) (Supp. 2006), the Fund is\r\n  obligated to cover a claim if â€œthe claimant or insured is a resident of this\r\n  State at the time of the insured event. . . .â€Â   \r\nThe Fund contends Claimant does not\r\n  qualify as a resident because his address on file with Employer is a Salisbury, North Carolina address, and in any event he is not a legal resident given his\r\n  status as an illegal alien.Â  Claimant testified he moved to Charleston in 1997\r\n  when he began working for Employer and has physically resided there since that\r\n  time.Â  There is nothing in the record indicating Claimant was actually living\r\n  in Salisbury at the time of his accident.Â   \r\nMoreover, Â§ 38-31-20(8) provides a\r\n  claim is covered by the Fund if the claimant or the insured is a South Carolina resident.[1]Â \r\n  There is no allegation that Employer, who is the insured party, does not\r\n  qualify as a resident.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order\r\n  remanding to the Commission to determine disability based on the combined\r\n  effect of Claimantâ€™s vision impairment in both eyes and reverse the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order remanding for an award of temporary total benefits.Â  Employerâ€™s\r\n  remaining issue is without merit and we dispose of it pursuant to Rule 220(b),\r\n  SCACR.Â  See Cooper v. McDevitt &amp; Street Co., 260 S.C. 463,\r\n  196 S.E.2d 833 (1973) (false representation regarding an employeeâ€™s physical condition).Â  \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN\r\n  PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] If the insured in not an individual, residence is\r\n  determined by the location ofÂ  the principal place of business.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26410","title":"Coggeshall v.

Â The trial judge dismissed the complaint\r\n  for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAs alleged in their complaint, in November 2000\r\n  the Coggeshalls consulted respondent Dr. Crain at REACH regarding in vitro\r\n  fertilization (IVF).Â  In preparation for IVF, Dr. Crain referred Susan\r\n  Coggeshall to respondent Dr. Moore in Columbia for pre-implantation testing and\r\n  monitoring.Â  The Coggeshalls subsequently signed a contract with REACH for IVF\r\n  services.Â  After embryo implantation, Susan became pregnant.Â  At fourteen weeks\r\n  gestation, amniocentesis revealed a chromosomal abnormality identified as Down\r\n  Syndrome.Â  In a subsequent telephone conversation, Dr. Crain advised the\r\n  Coggeshalls to have pre-implantation genetic testing if they wanted to use IVF\r\n  in the future.Â  This was the first time the Coggeshall were made aware that\r\n  such testing was available.\r\nThe Coggeshallsâ€™ child was born with Down\r\n  Syndrome.Â  The Coggeshalls then brought this action against REACH, Dr. Crain,\r\n  and Dr. Moore for failure to inform them of pre-implantation genetic testing.Â \r\n  Their complaint alleges they will suffer â€œsubstantial financial expensesâ€ in\r\n  caring for a child with Down Syndrome.\r\nIn lieu of answering the complaint, the North Carolina defendants, REACH and Dr. Crain, moved to dismiss for lack of personal\r\n  jurisdiction; Dr. Moore moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under South Carolina law.Â  The trial judge granted both motions.Â  The Coggeshalls appeal the\r\n  dismissal of their complaint against REACH and Dr. Crain.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there\r\n  â€œgeneral jurisdictionâ€ under Â§ 36-2-802?\r\n\t2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there\r\n  â€œspecific jurisdictionâ€ under Â§ 36-2-803?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA.Â \r\n  Background and procedure \r\nPersonal jurisdiction is exercised as â€œgeneral\r\n  jurisdictionâ€ or â€œspecific jurisdiction.â€Â  General jurisdiction is the Stateâ€™s\r\n  right to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant even though the suit\r\n  does not arise out of or relate to the defendantâ€™s contacts with the forum, Burger\r\n    King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 473 n.15 (1985); general\r\n  jurisdiction is determined under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-802 (2003).Â  Specific\r\n  jurisdiction is the Stateâ€™s right to exercise personal jurisdiction because the\r\n  cause of action arises specifically from a defendantâ€™s contacts with the forum;\r\n  specific jurisdiction is determined under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803 (2003).Â  Cockrell\r\n    v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 363 S.C. 485, 611 S.E.2d 505 (2005). Â The\r\n  exercise of personal jurisdiction under either statute must comport with due\r\n  process requirements and must not offend traditional notions of fair play and\r\n  substantial justice.Â  Id.Â  Due process requires some act by which\r\n  the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting\r\n  activities within the forum state.Â  Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235 (1958).Â  \r\n \r\nAt the pretrial stage,\r\n  the burden of proving personal jurisdiction over a nonresident is met by a\r\n  prima facie showing of jurisdiction.Â  Id.Â  When a motion to dismiss\r\n  attacks the allegations of the complaint on the issue of jurisdiction, the court\r\n  is not confined to the allegations of the complaint but may resort to\r\n  affidavits or other evidence to determine jurisdiction.Â  Graham v. Lloydâ€™s\r\n    of London, 296 S.C. 249, 251 n. 1, 371 S.E.2d 801, 802 n. 1 (Ct. App. 1988).Â \r\n  The decision of the trial court will be affirmed unless unsupported by the\r\n  evidence or influenced by an error of law.Â  Cockrell, supra. \r\n \r\nB.Â  General jurisdiction under Â§ 36-2-802\r\n\r\n\tThe trial judge ruled that jurisdiction was not\r\n  proper under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-802 (2003) which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\tÂ§ 36-2-802.Â  Personal\r\n  jurisdiction based upon enduring relationship \r\n\tA court may exercise personal\r\n  jurisdiction over a person . . . doing business . . . [in] this\r\n  State as to any cause of action.\r\n\r\nThe Coggeshalls contend REACHâ€™s activities\r\n  in South Carolina constitute â€œdoing businessâ€ in the state and therefore\r\n  jurisdiction is proper.Â  They point to REACHâ€™s answers to interrogatories which\r\n  indicate the following:\r\n\r\n\t- REACH performed services for nearly\r\n  three thousand South Carolina residents between 2000 and 2004 and sent bills to\r\n  South Carolina; \r\n\t- REACH earned over $2 million from South Carolina patients during that period which represents less than 1% of REACHâ€™s income;\r\n\t\r\n\t- REACH received referrals from at\r\n  least twelve South Carolina healthcare providers; \r\n\t- REACH is a member of the IntegraMed\r\n  Network of Infertility which has one member in South Carolina; \r\n\t- REACH has referred South Carolina\r\n  patients to two other medical practices in South Carolina, in addition to Dr.\r\n  Moore, for the patientsâ€™ convenience; \r\n\t- Of 55 the vendors with whom REACH\r\n  does business, five are located in South Carolina. \r\n\r\nThere is no universal formula for determining what\r\n  constitutes â€œdoing businessâ€ to subject a foreign entity to personal\r\n  jurisdiction; the question must be resolved on the facts of each case.Â  Troy\r\n    H. Cribb &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Cliffstar Corp., 273 S.C. 623, 258 S.E.2d 108\r\n  (1979).Â  As the title of Â§ 36-2-802 indicates, general jurisdiction is based\r\n  upon â€œan enduring relationshipâ€ with the State.Â  An enduring relationship is\r\n  indicated by contacts that are substantial, continuous, and systematic.Â  Cockrell,\r\n  363 S.C. at 495, 611 S.E.2d at 510 (citing Helicopteros Nacionales de\r\n    Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408 (1984); Internatâ€™l Shoe Co. v. Washington,\r\n  326 U.S. 310 (1945)).Â   \r\nIn this instance, REACH and Dr.\r\n  Crain do not have contacts with South Carolina that are substantial,\r\n  continuous, and systematic to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction.Â  Neither\r\n  Dr. Crain nor any of the REACH physicians is licensed to practice medicine in South Carolina; all of the medical care they rendered was rendered in North Carolina.Â \r\n  Medical services differ from other types of commercial activity because of the\r\n  very personal nature of the service rendered.Â  Hume v. Durwood Med. Clinic,\r\n    Inc., 282 S.C. 236, 318 S.E.2d 119 (Ct. App. 1984), cert. dismissed, 285\r\n  S.C. 377, 329 S.E.2d 443 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 848 (1985); accord Wolf v. Richmond County Hosp. Auth., 745 F.2d 904 (4th Cir.\r\n  1984).Â  As several courts have noted:\r\n\r\n\tWhen one seeks out services which are\r\n  personal in nature, such as those rendered by attorneys, physicians, dentists,\r\n  hospitals or accountants, and travels to the locality where he knows the\r\n  services will actually be rendered, he must realize that the services are not\r\n  directed to impact on any particular place, but are directed to the needy\r\n  person himself. . . . [I]t would be fundamentally unfair to permit a suit in\r\n  whatever distant jurisdiction the patient may carry the consequences of his\r\n  treatment. . . . \r\n\r\nGelineau v. New York Univ. Hosp., 375 F. Supp. 661,\r\n  667 (D.N.J. 1974).Â   \r\nBecause medical care is of such a\r\n  personal nature, jurisdiction over an out-of-state physician is generally not\r\n  exercised absent other circumstances indicating a purposeful availment of the\r\n  forum stateâ€™s market.Â  See Wright v. Yackley, 459 F.2d 287 (9th Cir. 1972); Soares v. Roberts, 417 F. Supp. 304 (D.R.I. 1976); Woodward\r\n    v. Keenan, 261 N.W.2d 80 (Mich. App. 1977); S.R. v. City of Fairmont, 280 S.E.2d 712 (W.Va. App. 1981); see generally Annot. 25 A.L.R.4th 706 (1983).Â  Here, we find no such purposeful availment.\r\nAlthough REACH has served a fair\r\n  number of South Carolina patients, REACH does not target its advertising to South Carolina Â residents nor does it systematically search out patients here.Â  REACH\r\n  maintains a website accessible by South Carolina residents but it is simply an\r\n  informational website that allows prospective patients to email for\r\n  information.Â  This type of â€œpassiveâ€ website does not direct business\r\n  activities to a particular forum.Â  See Holland America Line, Inc. v.\r\n    Wartsila North Amer., Inc., 485 F.3d 450 (9th Cir. 2007); Jennings\r\n      v. AC Hydraulic A/S, 383 F.3d 546 (10th Cir. 2004)\r\n  (distinguishing between interactive and passive websites for purposes of\r\n  personal jurisdiction); see also McBee v. Delica Co., 417 F.3d\r\n  107 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that given omnipresence of internet\r\n  websites, allowing personal jurisdiction to be premised on such a contact alone\r\n  would eviscerate limits on stateâ€™s jurisdiction).\r\nWe decline to hold that REACH or\r\n  Dr. Crain is doing business in South Carolina based on their unsolicited patient\r\n  contacts or tangential business dealings with vendors here.Â  We therefore\r\n  conclude the trial judge properly refused to exercise personal jurisdiction\r\n  under Â§ 36-2-802.[1]\r\nC.Â  Specific jurisdiction under Â§36-2-803\r\nThe Coggeshalls contend REACH and\r\n  Dr. Crain are subject to specific personal jurisdiction under S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  36-2-803 (2003) which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tÂ§ 36-2-803.Â  Personal jurisdiction based on conduct.\r\n\tÂ (A) A court may exercise personal\r\n  jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent as to a cause of\r\n  action arising from the personâ€™s:\r\n\tÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (1) transacting any business\r\n  in this State;\r\n\r\n. . .  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(4) causing tortious injury\r\n  or death in this State by an act or omission outside this State if he regularly\r\n  does or solicits business, or engages in any other persistent course of\r\n  conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services\r\n  rendered in this State;\r\n\t\r\n\r\n. .\r\n  .\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(7) entry into a contract to\r\n  be performed in whole or in part by either party in this State;Â  . . .\r\n\t\r\n\t(B) When jurisdiction over a person is\r\n  based solely upon this section, only a cause of action arising from acts\r\n  enumerated in this section may be asserted against him.\r\n\r\nAs noted in subsection (B),\r\n  jurisdiction under this section is limited to a cause of action arising from a\r\n  specific activity within this State.Â  Under subsection (A)(1), â€œtransacting any\r\n  business,â€ the business activities of REACH and Dr. Crain that occurred in South\r\n  Carolina, which included billing patients and doing business with vendors, did\r\n  not give rise to the alleged tort in this case.Â  This subsection does not\r\n  apply.\r\nRegarding subsection (A)(4),\r\n  â€œcausing tortious injury,â€ the tortious injury did not occur in South Carolina but in North Carolina where the medical treatment was rendered.Â  We concur\r\n  with the substantial number of cases finding that the tortious injury occurs in\r\n  the forum where the medical treatment was given and not where the patient\r\n  resides.Â  See Wright v. Yackley, 459 F.2d 287 (9th Cir. 1972) (medical treatment is personal service and tort occurred where\r\n  service rendered for purposes of personal jurisdiction); Lemke v. St.\r\n    Margaret Hosp., 552 F. Supp. 883 (N.D. Ill. 1982); Glover v. Wagner,\r\n  462 F. Supp. 308 (D. Neb. 1978); Gelineau v. New York Univ. Hosp., 375\r\n  F. Supp. 661 (D. N.J. 1974); Simmons v. State, 670 P.2d 1372 (Mont. 1983);Â  Brocail v. Anderson, 132 S.W.3d 552 (Tex. App. 2004).\r\nFinally, regarding\r\n  subsection (A)(7), â€œentry into a contract,â€ the Coggeshallsâ€™ payment on the\r\n  contract in South Carolina is the only part of the contract performed here and\r\n  this alone is not sufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction\r\n  over REACH and Dr. Crain.Â  Further, the contract in this case provides that North Carolina law applies to any claim arising from the agreement.Â  Although not\r\n  controlling, a choice of law provision is relevant in deciding whether to exercise\r\n  personal jurisdiction.Â  Springmasters, Inc. v. D&amp;M Mfg., 303 S.C.\r\n  528, 402 S.E.2d 192 (Ct. App. 1991) (citing Burger King Corp., supra).Â \r\n  The choice of North Carolina law in the agreement indicates REACH did not\r\n  intend to avail itself of the benefits and protections of South Carolina law by\r\n  entering a contract with a South Carolina resident.Â  Burger King Corp.,\r\n  471 U.S. at 482 (purposeful availment is touchstone of due process for personal\r\n  jurisdiction).Â   \r\nIn conclusion, we\r\n  hold the trial judge did not err in declining to exercise specific personal\r\n  jurisdiction under Â§ 36-2-803.Â   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, J., and\r\n  Acting Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in result in\r\n  a separate opinion in which BEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal: \r\nAlthough I\r\n  concur in the result reached by the majority, I respectfully disagree with the\r\n  analysis and conclusion regarding personal jurisdiction.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  determination of whether a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a\r\n  non-resident defendant involves a two-step analysis.Â  White v. Stephens, 300 S.C. 241, 245,\r\n  387 S.E.2d 260, 262 (1990). Â First, in order for\r\n  the courts to have statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction, the\r\n  nonresident defendantâ€™s conduct must meet the requirements of South Carolinaâ€™s\r\n  long-arm statute.[2]Â  Id. Â In relevant part, South Carolina courts may exercise\r\n  personal jurisdiction over a person who transacts business in this State or who enters into a contract to be performed in whole or\r\n  in part in this State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803(1) and (7) (2003).Â  In\r\n  my view, REACH transacted business in the State by contacting Dr. Moore and\r\n  arranging for part of the IVF procedure to be performed in Columbia.Â  Likewise,\r\n  since Dr. Mooreâ€™s services were a necessary part of the IVF procedure, I\r\n  believe REACH consequently entered into a contract with the Coggeshalls which\r\n  was performed in part in this State.Â  For these reasons, I disagree with the\r\n  majorityâ€™s jurisdictional analysis, and I would hold that South Carolina may\r\n  exercise personal jurisdiction over REACH pursuant to our long-arm statute.\r\nThe second step\r\n  in the analysis is whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with\r\n  the requirements of due process.Â  Cockrell\r\n    v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 363\r\n  S.C. 485, 491-92, 611 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2005).Â \r\n  In my opinion, exercising personal jurisdiction over REACH in this case would\r\n  not violate due process.Â  REACH purposefully sought out Dr. Moore in Columbia to perform services that were integral to the IVF procedure.Â  Additionally, REACH\r\n  admits it has treated thousands of South Carolinians over the past eight years,\r\n  which is mostly likely a result of its office location in Charlotte, adjacent\r\n  to the South Carolina/North Carolina border.Â  See Cockrell, 363 at 485, 491-92, 611 at 508 (2005)\r\n  (noting that due process requires minimum contacts between the\r\n  defendant and the forum state such that maintenance of the suit does not offend\r\n  traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice and such that the\r\n  defendant could reasonably anticipate being haled into court there).Â  I\r\n  disagree with the majorityâ€™s analysis in distinguishing between defendants that\r\n  render medical services and all other defendants.Â  By asserting this\r\n  distinction, the majority suggests that courts should apply profession-specific\r\n  standards under which to measure due process requirements, thereby effectively\r\n  making a policy decision.Â  In my view, such policy decisions are better left to\r\n  the legislature.\r\nDespite finding personal jurisdiction, however, I would affirm the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s dismissal.Â  In my opinion, the Coggeshalls do not allege an\r\n  injury entitling them to relief.Â  Specifically, the Coggeshalls contend they\r\n  will suffer substantial financial expenses in caring for their child; however,\r\n  the Coggeshalls do not allege that the failure to administer the\r\n  pre-implantation testing caused their childâ€™s condition.Â  David v. McLeod\r\n    Regional Medical Center, 367\r\n  S.C. 242, 248, 626 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2006) (holding that a\r\n  plaintiff in a medical malpractice case must show that the defendantsâ€™\r\n  negligence was the proximate cause of the alleged injuries and damages).Â \r\n  Therefore, despite their argument to the contrary, the Coggeshalls are\r\n  essentially seeking damages directly resulting from their child being born.Â  I\r\n  see no actual difference between this claim and a claim for wrongful life, a\r\n  claim which we have explicitly rejected.Â  See Willis v. Wu, 362\r\n  S.C. 146, 171, 607 S.E.2d 63, 71 (2004).\r\nFor these\r\n  reasons, I would hold that although a South Carolina court may exercise\r\n  personal jurisdiction over REACH, the Coggeshalls failed to present an injury\r\n  to which they are entitled to relief.Â   \r\nBEATTY, J., concurs\r\n\r\n[1] The Coggeshalls also contend the trial judge erred in failing to find Dr.\r\n  Moore, a South Carolina physician practicing in Columbia, acted as the agent of\r\n  REACH and Dr. Crain, and therefore personal jurisdiction was appropriate.Â  This\r\n  argument is not preserved for review.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s order regarding REACH\r\n  and Dr. Crain makes no finding regarding any alleged agency relationship\r\n  between Dr. Moore and REACH.Â  Although the Coggeshallsâ€™ brief refers to a\r\n  motion to amend which may have raised this issue, the motion itself is not\r\n  included in the record and the trial judgeâ€™s order on the motion to amend is\r\n  simply a summary denial.Â  There is nothing in the record indicating the issue\r\n  of agency was ever considered or ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  it is not preserved for review.Â  Madison ex rel. Bryant v.
