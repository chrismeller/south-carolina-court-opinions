Washington, 367\r\n  S.C. 76, 623 S.E.2d 836 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  This Court granted certiorari to\r\n  review whether the court of appeals erred in holding that the trial court\r\n  properly admitted certain hearsay evidence pursuant to the excited utterance\r\n  exception.Â  We affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision as modified.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nPetitioner and Adria Cropper were involved in a\r\n  ten-year, on-again-off-again relationship.Â  After the final break-up, Cropper\r\n  began a relationship with Roy Cotman (Victim).Â  One evening in August 2002, at\r\n  approximately 9:00 p.m., Victim drove Cropper to her home where Petitioner was\r\n  waiting.Â  An altercation ensued in which Petitioner fatally stabbed Victim.Â  \r\nAt trial, Cropper testified that Petitioner approached\r\n  the vehicle, leaned in the driverâ€™s side yelling at Victim, and as she\r\n  attempted to pull Petitioner away, Petitioner stabbed Victim.Â  Petitioner, on\r\n  the other hand, testified that he and\r\n  Cropper were arguing outside of the vehicle and that he saw Victim exit the driverâ€™s side and look in the back of the\r\n  car under the seats.Â  Petitioner testified that he thought Victim was looking\r\n  for a weapon, and that as Petitioner approached Victim, Victim â€œjump[ed] up and turn[ed] aroundâ€ and Petitioner â€œstarted swinging.â€Â  Petitioner then fled the\r\n  scene, and Cropper called the police.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the incident, Cropper gave a statement to police.Â  At trial, the State sought\r\n  to introduce this statement through the interviewing officer (Officer).Â  The\r\n  Officer testified in camera that at approximately 9:30 p.m., he transported\r\n  Cropper from the crime scene to the police station and began taking her\r\n  statement at approximately 11:00 p.m.Â  He described Cropper as being extremely\r\n  upset and distraught over the incident.Â  The Officer further explained that the\r\n  statement consisted of a written narrative of the incident, which Cropper\r\n  wrote, and three pages of questions and answers, which the Officer\r\n  transcribed.Â  Additionally, the Officer testified that after another officer\r\n  informed Cropper during the interview that Victim had died, she became\r\n  hysterical.Â  \r\nDefense counsel argued that the statement was\r\n  inadmissible hearsay evidence, while the State contended that it fell within\r\n  the excited utterance exception.Â  The trial court found that Cropper made the\r\n  statement under the continuing stress of excitement of the events and ruled\r\n  that the statement was therefore admissible as an excited utterance.Â  The court\r\n  of appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\n\r\nStandard of\r\n  Review\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court\r\n  sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48,\r\n  625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  A ruling on the admissibility of evidence is\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. McDonald, 343\r\n  S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is\r\n  based on an error of law.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner argues that the trial court erred in\r\n  admitting \r\n  Cropperâ€™s statements pursuant to the excited utterance exception.Â  Although we\r\n  agree that the trial court erred in admitting Cropperâ€™s statement to police as\r\n  an excited utterance, we find that any error was harmless.\r\nThree elements must be met in order for a\r\n  statement to be an excited utterance: (1) the statement must relate to a startling\r\n  event or condition; (2) the statement must have been made while the declarant\r\n  was under the stress of excitement; and (3) the stress of excitement must be\r\n  caused by the startling event or condition.Â  State v. Ladner, 373\r\n  S.C. 103, 116, 644 S.E.2d 684, 691 (2007).Â  The\r\n  rationale underlying the excited utterance exception is that â€œthe startling\r\n  event suspends the declarantâ€™s process of reflective thought, reducing the\r\n  likelihood of fabrication.â€Â  State v. Davis, 371 S.C. 170, 178, 638 S.E.2d 57,\r\n  62 (2006).Â  A court must consider the\r\n  totality of the circumstances when determining whether a statement is admissible\r\n  under the excited utterance exception, and the determination is generally left to the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court.Â  Id.; see also State v. Burdette, 335\r\n  S.C. 34, 43-44, 515 S.E.2d 525, 530 (1999).Â  \r\nCropperâ€™s statement to police does not qualify as excited\r\n  utterance.Â  Cropper made her\r\n  statements in a formal interview with law enforcement at police headquarters\r\n  almost ninety minutes after the events.Â  These statements were made in response\r\n  to the Officerâ€™s questions.Â  None of the statements were independent assertions\r\n  or exclamations regarding the events.Â  Indeed, it is apparent that the Officer was seeking detailed answers regarding the specific\r\n  facts of the incident as opposed to emotional, unprompted, or inherent\r\n  responses.Â  Compare State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999)\r\n  (involving an eyewitnessâ€™s statements to friends made two minutes after a\r\n  shooting); State v. Sims, 304\r\n  S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991) (finding that panicked and\r\n  hysterical statements made by an eyewitness who met the responding police officer\r\n  at the crime scene would have qualified as an excited utterance).Â  While we have no doubt that Cropper was certainly\r\n  upset as a result of the stabbing, the trial courtâ€™s finding that statements made\r\n  in a formal interview or interrogation to be excited utterances greatly expands\r\n  the scope of the exception.Â  \r\nWe note that this Court has found statements made to\r\n  law enforcement qualify as an excited utterance under other circumstances.Â  See\r\n    Burdette; State v. Harrison, 298 S.C. 333, 380 S.E.2d 818 (1989); State v. Quillien, 263\r\n  S.C. 87, 207 S.E.2d 814 (1974). Â Â However,\r\n  an important distinction between Burdette, Harrison, and Quillien and the instant case is\r\n  the fact that that Cropperâ€™s statements were responses made in a formal police\r\n  interview.Â  In this way, Cropperâ€™s out-of-court statements are fundamentally\r\n  different from the off-the-cuff, volunteered responses to law enforcement that\r\n  the Court has allowed under the excited utterance exception.Â  See State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 94, 544 S.E.2d 30, 34 (2001) (observing that an excited utterance expresses the real belief of the speaker because the\r\n  utterance is made under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the\r\n  senses, rather than under reason and reflection).Â  \r\nNonetheless, in our opinion, any error in\r\n  admitting Cropperâ€™s statement to police was harmless.Â  The State presented overwhelming\r\n  evidence that Petitioner killed Victim in a jealous rage.Â  For example,\r\n  Cropper, Cropperâ€™s mother, and police officers testified as to statements\r\n  Petitioner made on the night of the incident indicating that he intentionally\r\n  and maliciously stabbed Victim.Â  Furthermore, the Officerâ€™s testimony regarding\r\n  Cropperâ€™s statements was not extensive and was merely cumulative to Cropperâ€™s\r\n  testimony.[1]Â \r\n  Finally, there is no evidence in the record to support Petitionerâ€™s claim of\r\n  self defense as there is no evidence indicating that Victim was the first\r\n  aggressor.Â  See State v. Mizzell, 349\r\n  S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002) (providing a list of\r\n  factors to consider in determining whether error is harmless).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that although the trial court erred in admitting Cropperâ€™s statement to\r\n  police as an excited utterance, this error was harmless beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™\r\n  decision as modified.\r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001),\r\n  the Court held that the trial court improperly admitted a witnessâ€™s statements\r\n  to police because they were prior consistent statements and did not fall under\r\n  an exception to the hearsay rule.Â  Additionally, the Court held the error was\r\n  not harmless because although the testimony was cumulative, â€œit is\r\n  precisely this cumulative effect which enhances the devastating impact of\r\n  improper corroboration.â€Â  Although it is arguable that the Officerâ€™s testimony\r\n  improperly corroborated Cropperâ€™s testimony, we do not believe that it impacted\r\n  the case or affected the juryâ€™s decision.Â  Unlike the\r\n  witness in Saltz, Cropperâ€™s testimony was not weak, and furthermore, the\r\n  State presented a much stronger case against Petitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26527","title":"State v.

Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 609 S.E.2d 572 (2005).Â  We\r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner,\r\n  Henry Fletcher, was indicted for homicide by child abuse relating to the death\r\n  of nine-month-old Jaquan Perry.Â  Jaquan was the son of Fletcherâ€™s live-in\r\n  girlfriend, Ikeisha Perry.Â  On the afternoon of September 21, 2000, Perry and\r\n  Fletcher transported Jaquan to Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital at\r\n  approximately 1:15 p.m.Â  According to Perry and Fletcher, the child had been\r\n  fine that morning, so they took him on errands and to his brotherâ€™s dental\r\n  appointment.Â  As they were leaving the dentist office, Fletcher noticed the\r\n  soft spot on Jaquanâ€™s head was not moving so Perry checked and could not find a\r\n  heart beat.Â  Neither Fletcher nor Perry Â Â Â had noticed anything wrong with him\r\n  prior to this time.Â Â  However, both Fletcher and Perry told police Jaquan had\r\n  fallen off a mattress onto a hardwood floor that morning.Â  Although he seemed\r\n  sleepy, they thought he was otherwise okay.Â Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Robert Hubbird, the Pediatric ICU physician who first saw Jaquan at the hospital,\r\n  testified that when he first saw him, Jaquan was in full cardiopulmonary\r\n  arrest, his heart was not beating, and he was not breathing.Â  Jaquan was\r\n  resuscitated several times but was ultimately pronounced dead at 4:20 p.m.Â  Dr.\r\n  Hubbird testified Jaquanâ€™s abdomen was severely distended and protuberant, and\r\n  that both his liver and bowel were injured.Â  The bowel was injured so severely\r\n  that it was leaking out into the abdomen and perineal cavity.Â  According to Dr.\r\n  Hubbird, both the liver and bowel were dying; the fact that he could not hear\r\n  any bowel sounds meant they had been like that for days.Â  Dr. Hubbird testified\r\n  that Jaquanâ€™s injuries were not consistent with the reports given by Perry and\r\n  Fletcher, and that the injuries would have taken an extreme amount of force\r\n  directly to the abdomen.Â  Dr Hubbird opined that the injuries would not have\r\n  happened from falling a few feet from a bed onto a hardwood floor.Â  Dr. Hubbird\r\n  also testified that Jaquan had multiple rib fractures and there were numerous\r\n  bruises on his body, ranging in date from 1-10 days old.Â  The cause of Jaquanâ€™s\r\n  death was child abuse from massive intra-abdominal injuries, massive injuries\r\n  to kill the bowel, and widespread infection which killed the liver.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Timothy P. Close, a radiologist, also testified to the injuries to Jaquanâ€™s\r\n  liver, bowels, kidneys, spleen, and that there were fractured ribs.Â  Close\r\n  testified there were numerous rib fractures, and that they were not all\r\n  suffered at the same time, which was evident from the bruising, swelling, and\r\n  different shading of the bones as they attempted to heal themselves.Â  Close\r\n  felt the newest fractures were anywhere from several hours to 2-3 days old,\r\n  whereas some of the older ones were more likely 10-14 days old.Â  Dr. Close\r\n  likened the injuries suffered by Jaquan to injuries suffered in an auto\r\n  accident where a person has been ejected at 60-70 miles per hour.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, over the objection of defense counsel, the state called Carlos Jenkins, a\r\n  friend and co-worker of Fletcher, as a witness to two events he had seen in the\r\n  month prior to Jaquanâ€™s death.Â Â  The attorneys for both Perry and Fletcher\r\n  objected, contending there was not clear and convincing evidence as to who\r\n  committed those acts, nor were those acts causally related to Jaquanâ€™s death.Â \r\n  The trial court ruled that the â€œthe course and conduct within a reasonable time\r\n  before [Jaquan] diedâ€ was admissible.Â  The Court also ruled it was a res gestae type situation.Â  Accordingly, Jenkins was permitted to testify.Â Â  \r\nJenkins\r\n  testified he had known Fletcher for 4-5 years and had known Perry for only a\r\n  couple of months.Â  Over counselsâ€™ renewed objections, Jenkins testified that\r\n  approximately two weeks prior to Jaquanâ€™s death, he had gone to Fletcherâ€™s\r\n  house (where Perry and her two children were also living) and heard the baby\r\n  crying.Â  Fletcher told him the baby was upstairs, so he walked upstairs and\r\n  found Jaquan sitting in a walker in the attic, â€œpouring down sweat like he had\r\n  just dipped him in a bathtub.â€Â  Jenkins testified he took Jaquan outside on the\r\n  porch and cooled him off.Â  Both Fletcher and Perry were home at the time.Â  \r\nJenkins\r\n  also testified that sometime in the two or three weeks prior to the attic incident,\r\n  he came to the house and found Jaquan handcuffed by his feet to the bed on\r\n  which Fletcher and Perry slept, so he unlocked the cuffs.Â  Both Perry and\r\n  Fletcher were home at the time.Â Â  When Jenkins asked them if they were crazy,\r\n  they just giggled.Â  \r\nPerry\r\n  did not testify at trial.Â  She did, however, give several statements to police,\r\n  which were admitted in redacted form at trial.Â  In her statements, Perry also\r\n  indicated Jaquan had fallen from the bed the morning of September 21st.Â Â  She\r\n  comforted him, and then sat him on the sofa beside Fletcher.Â Â  She and Fletcher\r\n  brought Jaquan with them to run errands and, as they left the dentistâ€™s office,\r\n  she realized his heart was not beating and drove to the emergency room while\r\n  Fletcher attempted CPR.Â  Perry denied ever beating Jaquan, but admitted Jaquan\r\n  had been handcuffed to the bottom of the bed in her room.Â  \r\nFletcher\r\n  gave several statements to police and testified at trial.Â  In his statements to\r\n  police, he indicated similarly to Perry that Jaquan had rolled off a mattress\r\n  in the morning, but was unharmed so they took him along on errands.Â  He noticed\r\n  Jaquanâ€™s soft spot on his head wasnâ€™t moving when they left the dentistâ€™s\r\n  office and discovered he didnâ€™t appear to be breathing.Â  They drove to the\r\n  hospital while Fletcher attempted CPR, striking him in the chest a few times. Â \r\nFletcher\r\n  denied ever beating Jaquan, but testified that Perry had done so a few times.Â \r\n  He testified he had not seen Perry handcuff Jaquan to the bed, but saw him that\r\n  way after he got out of the shower.Â  He also testified that the â€œatticâ€ where\r\n  Perry would sometimes bring the children and hang clothes to dry was not\r\n  actually an attic, but an unfinished room off of a bedroom on the second level\r\n  of the house.Â  According to Fletcher, there was an air duct right outside the\r\n  â€œattic,â€ one step outside from the stairs.Â Â  He testified he had never put\r\n  Jaquan in the attic.Â  \r\nFletcher\r\n  testified that he was not at the house on Sycamore Avenue from the Sunday until\r\n  the Wednesday evening before Jaquanâ€™s death, arriving at 11:00 p.m. that\r\n  Wednesday.Â  (Jaquan died on Thursday).Â Â  According to Fletcher, on the day of\r\n  Jaquanâ€™s death, after he fell out of bed, Jaquan kept trying to go to sleep, so\r\n  he was tapping/hitting Jaquan on the bottom of his feet to keep him awake.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury convicted Fletcher of homicide by child abuse.Â  On appeal, the Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed, holding, inter alia, the prior bad acts testified to\r\n  by Jenkins were properly admitted pursuant to Rule 404(b), SCRE, and State\r\n    v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  It held the prior bad acts had\r\n  been proved by clear and convincing evidence, and that the acts were admissible\r\n  to demonstrate a) a common scheme or plan of child abuse or neglect, b) intent\r\n  or the absence of mistake or accident, c) as part of the res gestae of crime of\r\n  homicide by child abuse and d) that, in any event, any error in admission of\r\n  Jenkinsâ€™ testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the\r\n  overwhelming evidence of guilt in this case.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\nDid the\r\n  Court of Appeals err in holding Jenkinsâ€™ testimony concerning the events he\r\n  witnessed in the weeks prior to Jaquanâ€™s death were admissible under Rule\r\n  404(b), SCRE and that admission of this evidence was, in any event, harmless\r\n  error?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 404(b), SCRE, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is generally not\r\n  admissible to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt for the crime charged.Â  Such evidence\r\n  is, however, admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common\r\n  scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.Â  State v.\r\n    Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 631 S.E.2d 262 (2006); State v. Lyle, 125 S.C.\r\n  406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923). Â To be admissible, the bad act must logically relate\r\n  to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.Â  If the defendant was\r\n  not convicted of the prior crime, evidence of the prior bad act must be clear\r\n  and convincing.Â  Id.; State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135-36, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 679, 682-83 (2000). Even if prior bad act evidence is clear and\r\n  convincing and falls within an exception, it must be excluded if its probative\r\n  value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the\r\n  defendant.Â  Rules 403 and 404(b), SCRE (although relevant, evidence may be\r\n  excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice); State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 646 S.E.2d 872\r\n  (2007); State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001).Â  The\r\n  determination of the prejudicial effect of the evidence must be based on the\r\n  entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.Â  State\r\n    v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d 364, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 881 (1990).\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals stated, without discussion, â€œThe evidence demonstrates by\r\n  clear and convincing proof the occurrence of the prior bad acts.â€Â  This was\r\n  error.[1]Â \r\n  The present record does not contain clear and convincing evidence that Fletcher\r\n  was the person who put Jaquan in the attic, nor does it indicate he was the\r\n  person who handcuffed her to the bed.Â Â  \r\nClear\r\n  and convincing evidence is that degree of proof which will produce in the mind\r\n  of the trier of facts a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be\r\n  established.Â  Such proof is intermediate, more than a mere preponderance but\r\n  less than is required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt; it does not mean\r\n  clear and unequivocal.Â  Peeler v. Spartan Radiocasting, Inc., 324 S.C.\r\n  261, 478 S.E.2d 282, 283 n. 4 (1996).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  there is simply not clear and convincing evidence in the record that Fletcher\r\n  committed the prior bad acts testified to by Jenkins.Â  Although Jenkins testified\r\n  he saw Jaquan handcuffed to the bed and in the walker in the attic, there was\r\n  no evidence whatsoever introduced at trial that Fletcher was either the person\r\n  who placed Jaquan in the attic, or that he handcuffed him to the bed.Â  On the\r\n  contrary, Fletcher testified that upon discovering Perry hadÂ  handcuffedÂ \r\n  Jaquan to the bed, he cussed her out about it after Jenkins left.Â \r\n  Additionally, there was no testimony Fletcher was the person who put Jaquan in\r\n  the attic room, and he testified Perry sometimes put him there while she dried\r\n  her clothes as she used it as a laundry room.Â  \r\nWe have\r\n  previously found a lack of clear and convincing evidence the defendant\r\n  committed the prior bad act in question where, for example, there was no\r\n  evidence the appellant had committed the prior injuries of a split lip and a\r\n  swollen eye because the state offered no proof the appellant inflicted the\r\n  injuries.Â  State v. Pierce, 326 S.C. 176, 485 S.E.2d 913 (1997)\r\n  (evidence of prior child abuse inadmissible where there was no evidence\r\n  defendant inflicted previous injury).Â Â  See also State v.\r\n    Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 504 S.E.2d 324 (evidence of prior infant deaths\r\n  inadmissible where there was lack of evidence defendant was the perpetrator).Â  \r\nOn the\r\n  present evidence, there is simply no evidence, let alone clear and convincing\r\n  evidence that Fletcher was the perpetrator of the prior bad acts[2] against Jaquan.Â Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  trial court erred in admitting Jenkinsâ€™ testimony.[3]\r\nFinally,\r\n  the Court of Appeals held that even if admission of Jenkinsâ€™ testimony was\r\n  improper, any error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt\r\n  in this case.Â  This holding was error.Â  \r\nError\r\n  is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the\r\n  verdict obtained.Â  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420 S.E.2d\r\n  834, 842 (1992).Â  An insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial\r\n  is harmless where â€œguilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence\r\n  such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.â€Â  State v. Bailey,\r\n  298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989).\r\nThere\r\n  was little evidence at trial as to who inflicted Jaquanâ€™s injuries.Â  Although\r\n  Fletcher gave a statement to police in which he admitted to wrestling with Jaquan,\r\n  and hitting him with his elbows, and ultimately to punching him, he explained\r\n  this at trial both by claiming he was being sarcastic after hours of\r\n  questioning, and was utilizing the police officerâ€™s definition of â€œhittingâ€ in\r\n  describing his wrestling with Jaquan.Â  Accordingly, given that the identity of\r\n  the perpetrator was the essential issue at trial, and given the dearth of\r\n  evidence in the record, we simply cannot say that error in the admission of\r\n  Jenkinsâ€™ testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nThis case fundamentally demonstrates why certain prior bad act\r\n  testimony is inadmissible, i.e., it is used by the jury to infer that the\r\n  defendant did in fact commit the crime for which he is on trial.Â Â Â  We find the\r\n  only function of Jenkinsâ€™ testimony in this case was to demonstrate Fletcherâ€™s\r\n  bad character.Â  Accordingly, admission of this testimony was both erroneous and\r\n  prejudicial.[4]Â \r\n  The Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is reversed.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Michelle Childs, concur. TOAL, C.J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief\r\n  Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  In my view, the trial court properly admitted the prior bad acts at\r\n  issue.Â  Accordingly, I would affirm Petitionerâ€™s conviction and sentence.\r\nAlthough evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not\r\n  admissible for purposes of proving that the defendant possesses a criminal character or has a propensity to commit the charged crime, such evidence may be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a\r\n  common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.Â  Rule\r\n  404(b), SCRE.Â  To be admissible, a prior bad act must\r\n  logically relate to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.Â  State v. Pagan, 369\r\n  S.C. 201, 211, 631 S.E.2d 262, 267 (2006).Â  If the defendant was not convicted of the prior\r\n  crime, evidence of the prior bad act must be clear and convincing.Â  Id.Â  Prior bad acts may also be admissible under the res gestae doctrine.Â \r\n  Under this doctrine, evidence of prior bad acts may be admissible where such\r\n  evidence constitutes an integral part of the crime with which the defendant is\r\n  charged or is needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in\r\n  which the crime occurred.Â  State v. King, 334\r\n  S.C. 504, 512, 514 S.E.2d 578, 582 (1999).Â  \r\nChild\r\n  abuse differs from other types of crimes in several respects.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the crime of child abuse often occurs in secret, typically in the privacy of\r\n  oneâ€™s home.Â  The abusive conduct is not usually confined to a single instance,\r\n  but rather is a systematic pattern of violence progressively escalating and\r\n  worsening over time.Â  Child victims are often completely dependent upon the\r\n  abuser, unable to defend themselves, and often too young to alert anyone to\r\n  their horrendous plight or ask for help.Â  It is also not uncommon for child\r\n  abuse victims to be so young that they are incapable of offering testimony\r\n  against the abuser.Â  For these reasons, proving the crime of child abuse is\r\n  extremely difficult. \r\nIn light of the\r\n  insidious nature of this crime, our Legislature created a separate homicide\r\n  statute related to child abuse.Â  That statute provides that â€œ[a] person is\r\n  guilty of homicide by child abuse if the person: causes\r\n  the death of a child under the age of eleven while committing child abuse or\r\n  neglect, and the death occurs under circumstances manifesting an extreme\r\n  indifference to human life.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(A)(1) (2006).Â  The\r\n  Legislature has defined â€œchild abuse or neglectâ€ as â€œan act or omission by any\r\n  person which causes harm to the childâ€™s physical health or welfare.â€Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(B)(1) (2006).Â  Thus, the homicide by child abuse statute\r\n  criminalizes the specific infliction of abuse as well as the failure to protect\r\n  a child from abuse which results in the death of that child while exhibiting an\r\n  extreme indifference to human life.Â  In this way, the statute incorporates more\r\n  than just the act that causes the death - it criminalizes the course of conduct\r\n  which results in the death of a child.Â  In my view, this statute is grounded in\r\n  the public policy that an adult is not only prohibited from physically abusing\r\n  a child, but also is prohibited from deliberately sitting by and allowing a\r\n  childâ€™s life to be threatened by the abuse of another.\r\nIn my opinion, the majorityâ€™s view of the prior bad acts in the\r\n  instant case as it relates to the crime of homicide by child abuse is far too\r\n  narrow. Â Because the statute specifically prohibits not just acts resulting in\r\n  death to a child, but also omissions, I believe that it is irrelevant whether\r\n  Petitioner was the one to actually handcuff the infant victim to the bed and to\r\n  place him in the attic, or whether he was aware of the abusive incidents that\r\n  occurred in his home and failed to act to protect the child from the abuse.Â \r\n  Pursuant to the statute, the jury was free to return a guilty verdict if it\r\n  found that Petitioner failed to act in the face of patently dangerous\r\n  conditions in which the victim was placed.Â  \r\nThe evidence at trial showed that Petitioner and the infant\r\n  victimâ€™s mother began a relationship in March 2000.Â  In August 2000, several\r\n  weeks prior to the victimâ€™s death, the victimâ€™s mother along with the victim\r\n  and her other child began living at Petitionerâ€™s house with Petitioner.Â \r\n  Although Petitioner testified that he did not spend every night at the house,\r\n  he testified that he observed the victimâ€™s mother beat the victim and saw her\r\n  wrap the victim in a blanket and get on top of him.Â  Petitioner admitted that\r\n  he would â€œplay fightâ€ with the victim, and in his statement to police, he\r\n  stated that he had hit the victim several times with his elbow and twice with\r\n  his fists, pinched him, and put his weight on him, but that he did not mean to\r\n  hurt the victim.[5]Â Â  \r\nThe State presented evidence that the infant victim suffered\r\n  severe internal injuries, multiple rib fractures, ruptured bowels which caused\r\n  infection and sepsis, internal bleeding, abdominal infections, and dying\r\n  organs, all of which ultimately culminated in his death.Â  Doctors testified\r\n  that these injuries occurred at different times and that the newer fractures\r\n  were between several hours to three days old, while the older fractures were\r\n  likely two weeks old.Â  Additionally, doctors testified that the victimâ€™s\r\n  injuries resulted from multiple and repeated blows and were not consistent with\r\n  a single blow.Â  The record contains no evidence that the victim died\r\n  accidentally, and I believe that the extensive evidence of repeated brutal\r\n  physical abuse leads only to the conclusion that the victim died an agonizing,\r\n  prolonged death by torture at the hands of an adult.Â  Petitionerâ€™s friendâ€™s\r\n  testimony showed, at a minimum, that Petitioner deliberately failed to come to\r\n  the victimâ€™s aid while the victim was living in Petitioner home and that\r\n  Petitioner exhibited extreme indifference to human life, resulting in harm to\r\n  the victimâ€™s safety and welfare.[6]Â \r\n  Thus, under statute, this evidence was clearly relevant to Petitionerâ€™s guilt\r\n  of the crime of homicide by child abuse.Â  \r\nConsidering the evidence presented in this case, I would hold that\r\n  the friendâ€™s testimony was admissible under the res gestae doctrine.Â  I\r\n  believe that the testimony showed a course of conduct and established an\r\n  integral part of the crime of homicide by child abuse because it is evidence\r\n  that Petitioner abused and neglected the victim just weeks before his death.Â \r\n  In light of the temporal proximity to victimâ€™s death and considering the nature\r\n  of child abuse, I believe that Petitionerâ€™s friendâ€™s testimony was necessary to\r\n  a full presentation of the crime.Â  See State v. Adams, 322\r\n  S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, 370 (1996) (quoting United States v. Masters, 622 F.2d 83, 86 (4th Cir. 1980)\r\n  (holding that evidence of prior bad acts is admissible under the res gestae doctrine where such evidence â€œfurnishes part of the context of the crime or is\r\n  necessary to a full presentation of the case.â€).\r\nI would also hold that the testimony was admissible pursuant to\r\n  Rule 404(b) to show a common scheme or plan, because I believe that the prior\r\n  bad acts bore a close degree of similarity and were sufficiently connected to\r\n  the victimâ€™s death. In my view, Petitionerâ€™s friendâ€™s testimony was evidence of\r\n  a pattern of abuse towards the victim shortly before his death in Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  own home.Â Â  These acts were committed against the same victim, close in time to\r\n  the victimâ€™s death, and showed escalating abuse over a narrow and specific time\r\n  period.Â  In this way, this case is distinguishable from other cases in which we\r\n  have found prior bad act evidence inadmissible under 404(b) as a common scheme\r\n  or plan.Â  See State v. Smith, 322\r\n  S.C. 107, 110, 470 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1996)\r\n  (holding prior bad acts against girlfriendâ€™s son would not have been admissible\r\n  in defendantâ€™s trial for the death of girlfriendâ€™s daughter where there was no\r\n  evidence defendant previously abused the daughter and where the prior acts of\r\n  abuse were not sufficiently similar); State v.\r\n    Pierce, 326 S.C. 176, 179, 485 S.E.2d\r\n  913, 914 (1997) (holding evidence of prior bad act was\r\n  inadmissible under the common scheme or plan exception where the acts were not\r\n  sufficiently similar and where the acts occurred more than a year apart).[7]Â  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would hold that this evidence is admissible\r\n  pursuant to Rule 404(b) to prove intent and absence of mistake or accident.Â  In\r\n  order to prove its case, the State was required to prove that Petitioner\r\n  exhibited an extreme indifference to human life.Â  In my view, these prior bad\r\n  acts showed that Petitioner exhibited extreme and deliberate indifference and\r\n  conscious disregard towards the victimâ€™s life just weeks prior to his death.Â  See State v. McKnight, 352\r\n  S.C. 635, 645, 576 S.E.2d 168, 173 (2003)\r\n  (noting that in reckless homicide cases, reckless\r\n  disregard for the safety of others signifies an indifference to the\r\n  consequences of oneâ€™s acts or a conscious indifference to the safety of others); State v.\r\n    Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 97, 564 S.E.2d 362, 366 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002) (holding that â€œin the context of homicide by abuse statutes, extreme\r\n  indifference is a mental state akin to intent characterized by a deliberate act\r\n  culminating in death.â€).Â  Moreover, I believe that this testimony is evidence\r\n  that the victimâ€™s death was not the result of the victim accidentally falling\r\n  off of the bed, as Petitioner claimed.Â  See State v. Smith, 337\r\n  S.C. 27, 33, 522 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1999)\r\n  (holding that the trial court properly admitted the defendantâ€™s previous\r\n  domestic violence convictions to show intent and absence of mistake or accident\r\n  where he claimed the shooting was an accident).\r\nIn the homicide by child abuse statute, the Legislature drafted a\r\n  criminal offense that recognizes and criminalizes both the acts and the\r\n  omissions that typify the situation in which a helpless child perishes as a\r\n  result of an adultâ€™s actions or criminal ambivalence.Â  In my view, this\r\n  evidence was not admitted as character or propensity evidence.Â  Rather, I\r\n  believe that the evidence showed a common scheme or plan, absence of mistake or\r\n  accident, and intent, and that it was necessary for a full presentation of the\r\n  Stateâ€™s case.Â  For these reasons, I would affirm Petitionerâ€™s conviction and\r\n  sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We are not persuaded by the stateâ€™s contention\r\n  that this issue is not preserved for review.Â  During a lengthy pre-trial hearing\r\n  on the matter, both counsel for Perry and Fletcher argued against admission of\r\n  Jenkinsâ€™ testimony.Â  Later, immediately prior to Jenkinsâ€™ testimony, counsel\r\n  for Perry objected, raising numerous grounds, including â€œthe evidence relating\r\n  to the rib injuries should not come in because there was not clear and\r\n  convincing evidence as to who inflicted these rib injuries. . . . The same with\r\n  the handcuffs and with the attic incident . . .â€Â  We find the issue is\r\n  sufficiently preserved for our review.\r\n[2] Â We need not decide whether these acts, if\r\n  proven by clear and convincing evidence, would otherwise be admissible under\r\n  Rule 404 (b), SCRE.\r\n[3] Â Further, contrary to the trial courtâ€™s ruling,\r\n  the prior acts simply do not come within the res gestae under the facts\r\n  of this caseÂ  Accord State v. Bolden, 303 S.C. 41, 398 S.E.2d 494\r\n  (1990). Â (prior acts must be so intimately connected to the crimes charged that\r\n  their introduction is appropriate to complete the story of the crime charged).Â  \r\n[4] Â The dissent would hold the evidence is\r\n  admissible to establish a pattern of child abuse and neglect, such that it is\r\n  relevant to the charge of homicide by child abuse.Â  The majority of this Court,\r\n  however, has specifically rejected an identical contention under similar\r\n  facts.Â  State v. Pierce, 326 S.C. 176, 485 S.E.2d 913 (1997).\r\n[5] At trial, the police officer testified that Petitioner had shown him how he\r\n  placed his weight on the victim, which the officer demonstrated to the jury.Â \r\n  The officer also testified that Petitioner weighed approximately 220 pounds at\r\n  the time of his arrest, and another witness described Petitioner as â€œreally,\r\n  really big.â€Â  \r\n[6] I reach this conclusion viewing the prior bad act in the light most favorable\r\n  to Petitioner, for there is evidence in the record that Petitioner himself\r\n  committed the acts of abuse.Â  Specifically, the record includes testimony that\r\n  the handcuffs were Petitionerâ€™s; that Petitioner giggled after the friend\r\n  removed the handcuffs; and that Petitioner told the friend â€œto mind his own\r\n  business.â€Â  \r\n[7] In my view, the majority in Pierce did not\r\n  hold that prior bad acts are never admissible to establish a pattern of child\r\n  abuse, but rather, that testimony from medical personnel regarding injuries to\r\n  the child was inadmissible to show a pattern of child abuse because there was\r\n  no evidence the defendant committed the abuse causing the injuries.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the majority held that evidence of the defendantâ€™s â€œrough treatmentâ€ of the\r\n  child a year prior to his death did not bear a close similarity or connection.Â \r\n  Contrary to the testimony sought to be admitted in Pierce, Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  friendâ€™s testimony provides an eyewitness account of the manner in which\r\n  Petitioner treated Jacquan shortly before his death.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26530","title":"Willis v.

Wukela.Â  We dismiss Willisâ€™ appeal.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  City of Florence held its municipal primary elections on June 10, 2008, in\r\n  conjunction with several other elections.[1]Â  After Wukela was declared the winner of the Florence Democratic Mayoral Primary by a\r\n  single vote, Willis filed a protest with the Florence Democratic Party.Â  The\r\n  Executive Committee of the City of Florence Democratic Party transferred its\r\n  responsibility to certify the results of the election to the South Carolina\r\n  Democratic Party.Â  Following a lengthy hearing on June 21, the South Carolina\r\n  Democratic Party Board of State Canvassers of Municipal Primaries voted to\r\n  uphold the election results.Â  \r\nWillis\r\n  filed a timely notice of appeal and the matter was heard before the circuit\r\n  court on July 2.Â  The circuit court judge issued an order affirming Wukelaâ€™s\r\n  certification on July 14.Â  Willis filed a motion to alter or amend, which was\r\n  denied on July 18.\r\nWillis\r\n  appealed to this Court and sought to expedite the appeal.Â  Wukela filed a\r\n  motion to dismiss the appeal.Â  On July 28, the Court ordered that the parties\r\n  file briefs pursuant to an expedited briefing schedule and indicated the Court\r\n  would consider the motion to dismiss when it considered the appeal on the\r\n  merits.\r\nISSUE\r\nWukela\r\n  argues in his motion to dismiss that the issue is moot because the winner of\r\n  the primary must be certified on or before August 15, 2008.Â  We agree.Â  See e.g. Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 67, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001)\r\n  (holding a case becomes moot when a ruling will have no practical effect upon\r\n  the existing controversy). \r\nANALYSIS\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-350 (Supp. 2007), specifies two different, mandatory\r\n  deadlines for certifying the winners of party primaries so that the winners may\r\n  be placed upon the ballot for general or special elections.Â  Section\r\n  7-13-350(A) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the nominees in a\r\n    party primary or party convention held under the provisions of this title by\r\n    any political party certified by the commission for one or more of the offices,\r\n    national, state, circuit, multi-county district, countywide, less than\r\n    countywide, or municipal to be voted on in the general election, held on the\r\n      first Tuesday following the first Monday in November, must be placed upon the\r\n      appropriate ballot for the election as candidates nominated by the party by\r\n    the authority charged by law with preparing the ballot if the names of the\r\n    nominees are certified, in writing, by the political party chairman,\r\n    vice-chairman, or secretary to the authority, for general elections held under\r\n    Section 7-13-10, not later than twelve oâ€™clock noon on August fifteenth or, if August fifteenth falls on Saturday or Sunday, not later than twelve\r\n    oâ€™clock noon on the following Monday; and for a special or municipal general\r\n      election, by at least twelve oâ€™clock noon on the sixtieth day prior to the date\r\n      of holding the election, or if the sixtieth day falls on Sunday, by twelve\r\n    oâ€™clock noon on the following Monday . . . .\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nWillis\r\n  maintains the Democratic Party must certify its nominee for placement on the\r\n  ballot by September 5, sixty days before the November 4 election, in accordance\r\n  with the second portion of Â§ 7-13-350.Â  In support of this argument, Willis has\r\n  presented the affidavit of Steven Love, Interim Director of the Florence County\r\n  Voter Registration and Election Commission.Â  Love states in his affidavit that\r\n  a new primary could be conducted on August 26 in order for the time allotted\r\n  for canvassing and certification of the results to run its course by September\r\n  5.Â  He also testified at the hearing before the State Board of Canvassers that\r\n  the Election Commission would need approximately thirty days to prepare for\r\n  another election.Â  Love states in his affidavit that, in order to hold an\r\n  election by August 26, the Florence Voter Registration and Election Commission must receive a court order requiring such an election by no later than August 8.[2]\r\nWukela,\r\n  on the other hand, asserts the first portion of the statute applies and,\r\n  because the Florence municipal election is scheduled at the same time as the\r\n  November 4 general election, the Democratic nominee must be certified by August\r\n  15.Â  In support of this argument, Wukela points to City of Florence Municipal\r\n  Ordinance 2008-04, which was passed in February 2008.Â  Ordinance 2008-04 states,\r\n  â€œ[t]he General Election shall be held on November 4, 2008 . . . at which time\r\n  the Mayor and two City Council members shall be elected at-large.â€Â  The\r\n  ordinance also mandates that â€œ[p]olitical party primaries or conventions must certify nominees to the Municipal Election Commission no later than noon on\r\n    August 15, 2008.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  Based on the above, Wukela maintains\r\n  the matter was moot on or before July 17, provided a lead time of thirty days\r\n  is necessary to organize and hold the election, as Love states in his\r\n  affidavit. \r\nA\r\n  municipality may hold elections, primary or otherwise, whenever it wishes.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-50 (2004) (â€œEach municipal governing body may by\r\n  ordinance establish municipal ward lines and the time for general and special\r\n  elections within the municipalityâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-70 (2004) (noting\r\n  each municipal body shall determine by ordinance the time for filing nominating\r\n  petitions and holding primary elections or conventions).Â  A plain reading of Â§\r\n  7-13-350 reveals that, when a municipality chooses to hold its election to\r\n  coincide with the general election occurring on the first Tuesday following the\r\n  first Monday in November, a winner must be certified no later than\r\n  August 15.Â  E.g. Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Examrâ€™s, 370\r\n  S.C. 452, 469, 636 S.E.2d 598, 607 (2006) (holding the words of a statute must\r\n  be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced\r\n  construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation). \r\nWillis\r\n  argues the sixty day rule applies because the August 15 date governs only\r\n  general elections held pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-10 (1976), and Â§\r\n  7-13-10 governs general elections for federal, state, and county offices.Â \r\n  However, Willis ignores the fact the City of Florence chose to hold its\r\n  municipal election simultaneously with the federal, state, and county election,\r\n  which was held pursuant to Â§ 7-13-10.Â  Moreover, changing the certification date\r\n  by amended ordinance, as Willis is currently seeking to do, will have no effect\r\n  on the date the results must be certified because the city cannot contravene\r\n  the express requirement of the statute by ordinance. Barnhill v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 333 S.C. 482, 487, 511 S.E.2d 361, 363\r\n  (1999) (â€œIn order for there to be a conflict between a state statute and a\r\n  municipal ordinance, both must contain either express or implied conditions\r\n  that are inconsistent and irreconcilable with each otherâ€). \r\nBased\r\n  on Willisâ€™ statements in his return and his brief, together with Loveâ€™s\r\n  statements in his affidavit that Florence County needs substantial lead time\r\n  before it can hold another election, holding another election is, for all\r\n  intents and purposes, impossible. Â In Sasser v. S.C. Democratic Party,\r\n  277 S.C. 67, 69, 282 S.E.2d 602, 604 (1981), this Court noted that, by the very\r\n  nature of the election system, contests of a primary election must be settled\r\n  in time for the electorate to exercise their voting franchise at the general\r\n  election set by law.Â  Therefore, â€œ[a]s a general rule, courts have held that\r\n  they are without power to grant substantial relief once the time passes for the\r\n  name of a contestant to be certified for the election of officers to be placed\r\n  on the official ballot.â€Â  Sasser, 282 S.E.2d at 604.Â  \r\nMoreover, the Court found in Sasser that Â§\r\n  7-13-350 provided that candidates nominated by party primary, except in cases\r\n  of special and municipal elections, must be certified by September 18 (which\r\n  has since been changed to August 15).Â  Id. at 603.Â  The Legislature\r\n  amended the statute in 1998 and specifically added municipal elections to the\r\n  classes of elections which may be scheduled at the same time as November\r\n  general elections, from which the results of a primary must be certified by\r\n  August 15.Â  We hold the intent of the Legislature was clear in mandating that,\r\n  if a municipal election is scheduled to coincide with a November general\r\n  election, names of the party candidates must be certified by August 15.Â  See N.Y. Times Co. v. Spartanburg County Sch. Dist.

Durant and Appellate Defender M. Celia Robinson, both of South\r\n  Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia,\r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney\r\n  General Henry Dargan McMaster; Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh; Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe and Assistant Attorney General Brandy A.\r\n  Duncan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER: Â This is a direct\r\n  appeal from the juryâ€™s verdict which found appellant, Alfred William Lasure, to\r\n  be a sexually violent predator, and from the subsequent court order of\r\n  commitment to the Department of Mental Health for appellantâ€™s long term\r\n  control, care, and treatment.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2000, appellant pled guilty to one count of lewd act upon\r\n  a child which had been committed in January 1997 when appellant molested a\r\n  seven-year-old boy while traveling through South Carolina on a Greyhound bus.Â \r\n  Appellant was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.Â  The sentencing sheet\r\n  specifically noted that appellant was to participate in any sexual offender\r\n  treatment offered by the Department of Corrections (DOC).Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to his anticipated release from prison, the State filed a petition pursuant to\r\n  the Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) Act.Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 44-48-10 et\r\n    seq. (Supp. 2007).Â  At his jury trial, appellant moved to dismiss based on\r\n  the argument that the SVP Act is unconstitutional because the State\r\n  Constitution mandates rehabilitation of inmates.Â  Appellant contended that the\r\n  State should not have waited until the end of his criminal sentence to provide\r\n  treatment.Â  The trial court denied appellantâ€™s motion. \r\nThe Stateâ€™s sole witness was Dr. Pamela Crawford, an expert in\r\n  forensic psychiatry.Â  Her testimony demonstrated appellant has a long criminal\r\n  history of sexually abusing pre-pubescent and adolescent boys.Â  Appellant was\r\n  convicted of various offenses in Florida in 1967, 1972, 1974, 1978, 1979, 1981\r\n  and 1982.[1]Â \r\n  While on bond for the January 1997 South Carolina offense, appellant fled to Florida and again re-offended which resulted in another Florida conviction in 1997.Â \r\n  Because he failed to get sex offender treatment in Florida, he was taken back\r\n  to jail.Â  In 1999, the fugitive warrant from South Carolina was discovered\r\n  which ultimately led to his South Carolina conviction in 2000.Â  \r\nDr. Crawford diagnosed appellant with pedophilia as well as\r\n  paraphilia NOS.Â  In her opinion, appellant met the statutory definition of a\r\n  sexually violent predator.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Dr. Crawford noted that although appellant completed\r\n  Phase I of the Sex Offender Treatment Program offered by the DOC - which she\r\n  described as the educational phase of treatment - appellant refused to\r\n  participate in the Residential Treatment Unit which provides intensive\r\n  treatment.Â  Dr. Crawford explained that appellant has never taken\r\n  responsibility for any of the sexual offenses he has committed.Â  \r\nBeyond cross-examining Dr. Crawford, appellant presented no\r\n  defense.Â  The jury deliberated less than 15 minutes and found beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt that appellant is a sexually violent predator.\r\nISSUE\r\nDoes the SVP Act violate Article XII, Section 2 of the South\r\n  Carolina Constitution?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues the SVP Act violates Article XII, Section 2 of\r\n  the State Constitution.Â  Specifically, appellant complains he should have been\r\n  placed into this particular SVP program from the beginning of his criminal\r\n  sentence.Â  We disagree.\r\nArticle XII, Section 2 of the South\r\n  Carolina Constitution states that the General Assembly â€œshall establish institutions for the confinement of all\r\n    persons convicted of such crimes as may be designated by law, and shall provide\r\n    for the custody, maintenance, health, welfare, education, and rehabilitation of the inmates.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. XII, Â§ 2 (emphasis added).Â  A statute is\r\n  presumed constitutional and will not be declared unconstitutional unless its\r\n  repugnance to the constitution is clear\r\n  and beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  In re Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh,\r\n  351 S.C. 122, 134-35, 568 S.E.2d 338, 344&nbsp;(2002).\r\nIn Sullivan\r\n  v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 355 S.C. 437, 444, 586 S.E.2d 124,\r\n  127&nbsp;(2003), this Court held that even if Article\r\n  XII, Section 2 is read to require some rehabilitation for inmates, â€œit\r\n  does not mandate any specific programs that must be provided by the General\r\n  Assembly or the [DOC] and, more importantly, it does not mandate any\r\n    particular timetable for the furnishing of any rehabilitative services.â€Â  Id. at 444, 586 S.E.2d at 127&nbsp;(emphasis added).\r\nIt\r\n  is settled law that the SVP Act is civil in nature.Â  See In re\r\n    Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 550 S.E.2d 311 (2001).Â  As to whether the SVP commitment\r\n  process should be held earlier in an inmateâ€™s sentence, we have already found Â Â that\r\n  if this was the requirement, then other inmates could complain that â€œholding a commitment hearing early in their sentence\r\n    deprives them of the ability to voluntarily receive treatment and\r\n    rehabilitation which would negate their being labeled as a sexually violent\r\n    predator.â€Â  In re Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. at 145, 568\r\n    S.E.2d at 349.\r\nAs\r\n  we observed in Luckabaugh:\r\n\r\n  Moving\r\n    the determination to the beginning of an individualâ€™s prison sentence would\r\n    undoubtedly result in more individuals being adjudicated as sexually violent\r\n    predators. Â Since the prison system currently offers mental health treatment\r\n    programs, it would be unwise as a matter of judicial policy to deprive an\r\n    individual of the opportunity to seek such counseling, to progress in his\r\n    treatment and to demonstrate that he is not in need of custodial treatment\r\n    programs as a sexually violent predator at the conclusion of his sentence.\r\n\r\nId. at145, 568 S.E.2d at 350.\r\nAccordingly, we find no merit to appellantâ€™s argument that the SVP\r\n  Act is unconstitutional.Â  The State Constitution does not mandate the provision\r\n  of any specific type of rehabilitative program.Â  Sullivan, supra.Â \r\n  Moreover, the DOC indeed offers sex offender treatment programs, and if an\r\n  inmate avails himself of these programs during his incarceration, he could\r\n  potentially be rehabilitated and avoid the further intensive treatment required\r\n  by the SVP Act at the conclusion of a criminal sentence.Â  See Luckabaugh, supra.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the trial court correctly found that the SVP Act does not violate Article XII, Section 2 of the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The majority of these offenses are sexual in nature,\r\n  generally for lewd acts either against a child or in the presence of a child.Â \r\n  His 1979 conviction was for delivering a controlled substance to a minor where\r\n  he gave two 15-year-old boys marijuana. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26529","title":"Spoone v.

Â See, e.g., State\r\n    v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 292, 440\r\n  S.E.2d 341, 347&nbsp;(1994) (discussing Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257 (1971) and United States v. Ringling, 988 F.2d 504 (4th Cir. 1993)).Â  The Thrift Court explained that â€œa plea\r\n  bargain rests on contractual principles,â€ and therefore, â€œeach party should\r\n  receive the benefit of the bargain.â€Â  Id.; accord State v.\r\n    Dingle,&nbsp;376 S.C. 643, 651-52, 659 S.E.2d 101, 106&nbsp;(2008) (finding\r\n  defendant received the benefit of his plea bargain).\r\nAs to a plea agreement containing a waiver of direct appeal\r\n  rights, the Fourth Circuit has stated â€œ[i]t is\r\n  clear that a defendant may, in a valid plea agreement, waive [a federal\r\n  statutory] right of appeal, just as more fundamental rights such as the right\r\n  to counsel and the right to a jury trial may be waived.â€Â  United States v.\r\n    Wessells, 936 F.2d 165, 167&nbsp;(4th Cir. 1991) (citations\r\n  omitted).[4]Â \r\n  Regarding a waiver of the right to collateral review, the Fourth Circuit\r\n  has held there is â€œno reason to distinguish the enforceability of a waiver of\r\n  direct-appeal rights from a waiver of collateral-attack rightsâ€ in a plea\r\n  agreement.Â  United States v. Lemaster,&nbsp;403 F.3d 216, 220&nbsp;(4th Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nHowever,\r\n  such a waiver will be held effective only if it is knowing and voluntary.Â  Wessells,\r\n  936 F.2d at 167; Lemaster,&nbsp;403 F.3d at 220; see also United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14,\r\n  24&nbsp;(3rd Cir. 2001) (â€œThe baseline for any waiver of rights is\r\n  that the defendant enter into it knowingly and voluntarily.â€).Â  The requirement\r\n  that the waiver be knowing and voluntary is used by all the federal circuits,\r\n  albeit with some variations.Â  See generally Derek\r\n  Teeter, Comment, A Contracts Analysis of Waivers of the\r\n    Right to Appeal in Criminal Plea Bargains,&nbsp; 53 U. Kan. L. Rev.\r\n  727&nbsp;(2005).Â  \r\nTo\r\n  determine whether a waiver is effective in the Fourth Circuit, the court\r\n  examines the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the case, including\r\n  the background, experience and conduct of the accused.Â  United States v. Broughton-Jones, 71 F.3d 1143, 1146&nbsp;(4th Cir. 1995).Â \r\n  In addition, the court will evaluate whether â€œthe issue sought to be appealed\r\n  falls within the scope of the waiver.â€Â  United States v. Cohen, 459 F.3d\r\n  490, 494&nbsp;(4th Cir. 2006), cert. denied 127 S.Ct. 1169 (2007).\r\nIn addition to\r\n  federal court precedent, numerous state jurisdictions have upheld waivers of\r\n  appellate rights and/or post-conviction relief, provided they were knowing,\r\n  intelligent and voluntary.Â  See, e.g., People v. Vargas,\r\n  17 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 449&nbsp;(Cal. Ct. App. 1993) (â€œan express waiver of the\r\n  right of appeal made pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement is valid provided\r\n  defendantâ€™s waiver is knowing, intelligent and voluntaryâ€); Stahl v. State,\r\n  972 So.2d 1013, 1015&nbsp;(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008) (a defendant can waive his\r\n  right to collateral attack when the waiver is expressly stated in the plea\r\n  agreement and it is knowingly and voluntarily made); Allen v. Thomas,\r\n  458 S.E.2d 107, 108&nbsp;(Ga. 1995) (â€œa waiver of a right to appeal or to seek\r\n  post-conviction relief must be knowing, intelligent and voluntaryâ€); Jackson\r\n    v. State, 241 S.W.3d 831, 833&nbsp;(Mo. Ct. App. 2007) (â€œA movant can waive\r\n  his right to seek post-conviction relief in return for a reduced sentence if\r\n  the record clearly demonstrates that the movant was properly informed of his\r\n  rights and that the waiver was made knowingly, voluntarily, and\r\n  intelligently.â€); People v. Seaberg, 541 N.E.2d 1022, 1026 (N.Y. 1989) (waiver of appellate rights is enforceable if it is\r\n  voluntary, knowing and intelligent; to make this determination, â€œall the\r\n  relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the waiver, including the nature and terms of the agreement\r\n  and the age, experience and background of the accusedâ€ must be considered).\r\nLooking at the particular\r\n  facts and circumstances of the instant case, including: Â (1) the background,\r\n  experience and conduct of the accused, (2) the text of the plea agreement, and\r\n  (3) the transcript of the plea hearing, we find petitionerâ€™s waiver was\r\n  voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made.Â  Although petitioner only has a\r\n  ninth grade education, the text of the written plea agreement was\r\n  straightforward.Â  Furthermore, the plea colloquy shows that the trial court\r\n  specifically asked petitioner about the waiver both in the language of the plea\r\n  agreement, as well as in plain language.Â  Petitioner was represented by two\r\n  attorneys at the trial level.Â  Both lawyers attended the plea hearing and both\r\n  signed the written plea agreement, along with petitioner himself.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the PCR court correctly enforced the waiver and dismissed petitionerâ€™s\r\n  PCR application.[5]Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] No sentence was imposed for the weapons charge.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(A) (2003) (mandatory five-year sentence â€œdoes not\r\n  apply in cases where the death penalty or a life sentence without parole is\r\n  imposed for the violent crimeâ€). \r\n[2] Petitioner also stated he had been married, but the\r\n  murder victim was his estranged wife.Â  According to the facts recited at the\r\n  plea hearing, petitioner went into his wifeâ€™s sonâ€™s house with a shotgun, found\r\n  his wife hiding in the bathroom, and shot her three times.Â  When arrested four\r\n  hours later, he admitted the shooting to police.Â  \r\n[3] In petitionerâ€™s PCR application, he alleges\r\n  ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on counselâ€™s failure â€œto do a\r\n  proper investigation of the facts and law of the case.â€\r\n[4] Accord United States v. Teeter, 257\r\n  F.3d 14, 22&nbsp;(3rd Cir. 2001) (â€œSince the Supreme Court\r\n  repeatedly has ruled that a defendant may waive constitutional rights as part\r\n  of a plea agreement, it follows logically that a defendant ought to be able to\r\n  waive rights that are purely creatures of statute.â€) (citations omitted).\r\n[5] Petitioner argues the Fourth Circuitâ€™s opinion in Wessells supports his argument.Â  In Wessells, the defendant had waived the right\r\n  to directly appeal the sentence.Â  The court found the waiver was unenforceable,\r\n  however, because the plea court did not question the defendant â€œspecifically\r\n  concerning the waiver provision of the plea agreementâ€ and the defendant\r\n  â€œhimself gave no indication of the degree to which he understood the waiverâ€™s\r\n  import.â€Â  Wessells, 936 F.2d at 168.Â  In this case, however, the trial\r\n  court did specifically question petitioner about the waiver provision more than\r\n  one time and in more than one manner.Â  Therefore, Wessells is clearly\r\n  distinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26531","title":"Zurcher V.

(collectively,\r\n  â€œRespondentsâ€) alleging assault and battery, false imprisonment, abuse of\r\n  process, malicious prosecution, and intentional infliction of emotional\r\n  distress.Â  Respondents counterclaimed alleging assault and battery.Â  Each party\r\n  denied liability for the otherâ€™s claims and further claimed self-defense.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  criminal charges against Zurcher went before the magistrates court in February\r\n  2006.Â  Considering the presence of Bilton, the two female employees, and one\r\n  additional witness to testify against him, and the â€œsignificant likelihood of\r\n  being convicted on all three counts,â€ Zurcher entered a guilty plea under North\r\n    Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970) on a single count of simple assault\r\n  and battery in exchange for the dismissal of his remaining two assault and\r\n  battery claims.Â  The magistrate assessed the maximum fine, but did not impose a\r\n  sentence.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  Zurcherâ€™s criminal proceeding in magistrates court, Respondents filed a motion\r\n  for summary judgment in the civil action.Â  The trial court granted the motion\r\n  for summary judgment as to all of Zurcherâ€™s claims against Respondents and\r\n  granted partial summary judgment as to Respondentsâ€™ claims against Zurcher,\r\n  leaving only the issues of proximate cause and damages.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  trial court ruled that Zurcherâ€™s previous Alford plea to simple assault\r\n  and battery at the criminal proceeding collaterally estopped Zurcher from\r\n  litigating the claims and counterclaim asserted at the subsequent civil\r\n  proceeding, all of which hinged on whether Zurcher physically assaulted\r\n  Bilton.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nThe\r\n  case was certified to this Court from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule\r\n  204(b), SCACR, and Zurcher raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in holding that a defendant\r\n    who enters an Alford plea in a criminal proceeding is collaterally\r\n    estopped from litigating the issue in a subsequent civil action based on the\r\n    same facts underlying the plea?Â Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard\r\n  applied by the trial court.Â  Houck v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329 (2005).Â  Summary judgment is\r\n  appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and it is clear\r\n  that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the\r\n  evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence\r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Hanson\r\n    v. Scalise Builders of S.C., 374 S.C. 352, 355, 650 S.E.2d 68, 70\r\n  (2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nZurcher\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in holding that the entry of an Alford plea\r\n  at a criminal proceeding collaterally estops a defendant from litigating the\r\n  issue in a subsequent civil action based on the same facts underlying the\r\n  plea.Â  We disagree. \r\nUnder\r\n  the doctrine of collateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, when an\r\n  issue has been actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,\r\n  the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action whether on the same or a\r\n  different claim.Â  S.C. Prop. and Cas. Ins. Guar. Assoc. v. Wal-Mart Stores,\r\n    Inc., 304 S.C. 210, 213, 403 S.E.2d 625, 627 (1991).Â  The doctrine may not\r\n  be invoked unless the precluded party has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate\r\n  the issue in the first action.Â  See id.Â  This Court recently extended\r\n  the doctrine of collateral estoppel by adopting the rule that â€œonce a person\r\n  has been criminally convicted, the person is bound by that adjudication in a\r\n  subsequent civil proceeding based on the same facts underlying the criminal\r\n  conviction.â€Â  Doe v. Doe, 346 S.C. 145, 148, 551 S.E.2d 257, 258\r\n  (2001).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find no legal or practical justification for excluding guilty pleas from the\r\n  ambit of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.Â  Although the defendant who\r\n  enters a guilty plea has chosen a legal strategy which avoids a trial while the\r\n  defendant who is adjudicated guilty has opted to take his chances at a\r\n  contested trial, both are means to the same legal end:Â  the imposition of the\r\n  punishment prescribed by law.Â  See Sanders v. Leeke, 254 S.C. 444, 447,\r\n  175 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1970) (â€œA plea of guilty is a confession of guilt, made in a\r\n  formal manner and has the same effect in law as a verdict of guilty . . . .â€).Â \r\n  For this reason, so long as a defendant has entered a guilty plea freely and\r\n  voluntarily,[1] an admission of guilt fully and fairly litigates the matter in the same manner\r\n  as a contested trial in which a defendant is adjudicated guilty.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  hold that a defendant who enters a guilty plea may be collaterally estopped\r\n  from litigating the same issue in a subsequent civil suit. Â \r\nAn Alford plea is not distinguishable from a standard guilty plea in this regard.Â  An Alford plea - a guilty plea accompanied by an assertion of innocence - was\r\n  held to be a constitutional admission of guilt in North Carolina v. Alford,\r\n  400 U.S. 25 (1970).Â  The Alford court reasoned that so long as a factual\r\n  basis exists for a plea, the Constitution does not bar sentencing a defendant\r\n  who makes a calculated choice to accept a beneficial plea arrangement rather\r\n  than face overwhelming evidence of guilt.Â  400 U.S. at 38.[2]Â \r\n  Under this same reasoning, we find that the defendant must likewise accept the\r\n  collateral consequences of that decision.Â  Therefore, we hold that the entry of\r\n  an Alford plea at a criminal proceeding has the same preclusive effect\r\n  as a standard guilty plea.Â  \r\nApplying\r\n  this to the instant case, we find the trial court correctly determined that\r\n  Zurcher was estopped from denying liability for the assault in the subsequent\r\n  civil action.Â  Zurcher had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the criminal\r\n  assault and battery charge at the trial before the magistrate, and the\r\n  testimony of the three witnesses against him who were present during the\r\n  altercation clearly provided a sufficient factual basis for Zurcherâ€™s plea.Â \r\n  Furthermore, as the trial court observed, Zurcher claimed no difficulties in\r\n  procuring witnesses and no procedural limitations affecting his opportunity to\r\n  litigate.Â  That he deemed a plea of guilty to be the more appealing alternative\r\n  at the criminal proceeding does not diminish the voluntariness of Zurcherâ€™s\r\n  plea under the circumstances.Â  Acting on the advice of competent counsel,\r\n  Zurcher simply reasoned that the evidence weighed heavily against him and that\r\n  he preferred to pay a fine for one charge of simple assault and battery rather\r\n  than risk the imposition of three consecutive thirty-day sentences for three\r\n  charges of assault and battery.Â  Accordingly, we hold that Zurcher is bound by\r\n  his Alford plea and is precluded from denying liability in the\r\n  subsequent civil action with Bilton.[3] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision holding that a\r\n  party who has pleaded guilty under Alford in a previous criminal\r\n  proceeding is collaterally estopped from litigating the issue in a subsequent\r\n  civil action based on the same facts underlying the plea.\r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Gaines v. State, 335 S.C. 376, 380, 517 S.E.2d 439, 441\r\n  (1999) (stating the constitutional standard governing the entry of guilty\r\n  pleas).\r\n[2] In its analysis, the Alford court\r\n  compared guilty pleas accompanied by an assertion of innocence with nolo\r\n    contendere pleas, in which a defendant does not expressly admit guilt, yet\r\n  waives the right to a trial and authorizes the court to treat him as guilty.Â  See 400 U.S. at 35-37.Â  We reiterate that the significance of Alford lies\r\n  in the determination that the Alford class of guilty pleas is\r\n  constitutionally valid.Â  To this end, the Alford courtâ€™s analogy is only\r\n  intended to show that an Alford guilty plea is the constitutional\r\n  equivalent of a nolo plea.Â  The comparison in no way suggests that Alford pleas are the equivalent of nolo pleas for all practical purposes,\r\n  particularly with respect to evidentiary standards which prohibit using nolo pleas as substantive evidence of guilt in a subsequent proceeding.Â  See Rule\r\n  410(2), SCRE.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  rules of evidence also distinguish nolo contendere pleas from Alford pleas\r\n  in some circumstances.Â  See Rule 609, SCRE (permitting prior convictions\r\n  to be used for impeachment purposes and that for purposes of the rule, â€œa\r\n  conviction includes a conviction resulting from a trial or any type of plea,\r\n  including a plea of nolo contendere or a plea pursuant to North Carolina v.\r\n    Alfordâ€).Â  In light of this distinction, had the policy underlying the rules\r\n  been to give Alford pleas the same non-preclusive effect on collateral\r\n  review as nolo pleas, the drafters could have specified such in the\r\n  rules governing the admissibility of prior convictions.Â  See Rule 410,\r\n  SCRE Â (providing that a nolo plea is inadmissible in any civil or\r\n  criminal proceeding); and Rule 803(22), SCRE (excluding nolo pleas\r\n  from the hearsay exception for judgments of previous convictions after a trial\r\n  or upon a plea of guilty).Â  \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we find that any perceived similarity between Alford pleas\r\n  and nolo pleas is irrelevant to the Courtâ€™s determination in this case. \r\n[3] Only guilty pleas to â€œa crime punishable by death or\r\n  imprisonment in excess of one yearâ€ are admissible under the hearsay exception\r\n  found in Rule 803(22), SCRE. Â Â Therefore, it appears that Zurcherâ€™s guilty plea\r\n  to simple assault and battery, a misdemeanor carrying a $500 fine or 30 days\r\n  imprisonment, see S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 22-3-540, -560 (2007), was\r\n  inadmissible hearsay evidence in the first instance.Â  Because Zurcher neither\r\n  objected at trial nor appealed the issue on grounds of hearsay, this Court need\r\n  not address the matter.Â  We also note that Zurcher could have pleaded nolo\r\n    contendere and altogether avoided this appeal as nolo pleas are\r\n  permitted only for misdemeanor charges, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-40 (2003), and\r\n  are inadmissible in any civil or criminal proceeding, Rule 410, SCRE, except\r\n  for impeachment purposes, Rule 610, SCRE.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26532","title":"Koon v.

Thomas Falls, Jr., of West Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: In\r\n  this case, the magistrates court granted summary judgment to Respondent\r\n  landlord (â€œLandlordâ€) in an eviction action, finding that Landlord had given\r\n  Appellants, who are tenants (â€œTenantsâ€), proper notice of the termination of\r\n  their tenancy.Â  The circuit court affirmed and Tenants appeal.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn\r\n  August 2002, Landlord and Tenants entered into a residential lease agreement\r\n  for a house owned by Landlord.Â  The agreement included the following provision:\r\n\r\n  This\r\n    Lease Agreement shall be effective for a term of 12 months, beginning on\r\n    the 7th day of August, 2002, and ending on the 6th day of August, 2003 after which tenants may continue month to month.Â  Tenant\r\n      shall provide a 30 day written notice prior to moving.Â  (emphasis in\r\n    original).Â  \r\n\r\nWhen the term of\r\n  the original lease expired in August 2003, Tenants continued to rent the\r\n  residence at the $795 per month rate specified in the original term of the\r\n  lease.Â  In November 2004, Landlord indicated her intent to increase Tenantsâ€™\r\n  monthly rent by $100 beginning in 2005.Â  Tenants expressed to Landlord that\r\n  they would not pay the increased rate.Â  Subsequently, in early February 2005,\r\n  Landlord notified Tenants in writing that she was raising the rent to $895\r\n  effective February 15, and that if Tenants did not wish to rent the property at\r\n  that rate, then the writing served as their thirty-day notice to vacate the\r\n  premises by March 15.Â  After further communications, the parties agreed that\r\n  Tenants could remain at Landlordâ€™s rental property until August 9, 2005 at a\r\n  rate of $795 per month.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  some point after the March agreement, the relationship between the parties\r\n  apparently took a turn for the worse and in July 2005, Tenants confirmed in a\r\n  written notice that they would not be leaving the premises in August, and\r\n  further, that until they gave Landlord a new thirty-day notice of termination,\r\n  Tenants would be reducing their rental payments to reflect what they believed\r\n  to be the fair market value of the rent â€œabated by the diminution of the quiet\r\n  enjoyment caused by [Landlordâ€™s] actions and failures.â€Â  \r\nOn January 5, 2006,\r\n  Landlord sent a letter to Tenants requesting past due rent totaling $300 over a\r\n  period of three months and explaining that Landlord was â€œstill patiently\r\n  waiting for you to move.â€Â  Landlord noted that the lease had expired, Tenants\r\n  had been asked to move, and Tenants had given a letter of intent to move.Â \r\n  Landlord concluded that â€œit is still our wish for you to move from our property\r\n  as you promised that you would in your letter of March 15, 2005.â€Â  After no\r\n  response from Tenants, Landlord filed an application for ejectment based on (1)\r\n  Tenantsâ€™ failure to pay rent when due, (2) expiration of the term of the lease,\r\n  and (3) Tenantsâ€™ violation of the terms of the lease.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 27-37-10(a) (2007). Â The magistrates court served a rule to vacate or\r\n  show cause on Tenants on February 16, 2006.\r\nAt a\r\n  hearing requested by Tenants, Tenants asserted a counterclaim that Landlord was\r\n  unfairly charging Tenants rent above the fair market value in violation of S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-310(b) (2007), and requested a jury trial.Â  Prior to trial,\r\n  however, the magistrate granted Landlordâ€™s motion for summary judgment and\r\n  ordered the eviction of Tenants, finding that the term of the original lease\r\n  had expired and that Landlord had given Tenants the statutory 30-day notice to\r\n  leave.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-770(b) (2007).Â  The magistrate\r\n  further held that this resolution of Landlordâ€™s claim precluded consideration\r\n  of Tenantsâ€™ issue related to rent inflation.Â  \r\nTenants\r\n  appealed and the circuit court affirmed the magistrateâ€™s grant of summary\r\n  judgment to the Landlord.Â  Tenants appealed the circuit courtâ€™s order to the\r\n  court of appeals, and Landlord moved to certify the case to this Court pursuant\r\n  to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  This Court granted Landlordâ€™s motion, and Tenants raise\r\n  the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit court err in affirming\r\n  the magistrate&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment to Landlord based on a finding that\r\n  Landlord provided the proper notice for terminating the tenancy established by\r\n  the lease agreement?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the circuit judge err in failing\r\n  to recuse himself in this matter?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n    Should eviction proceedings\r\n  require a court to find at least &ldquo;clear and convincing proof&rdquo; of a tenant&rsquo;s\r\nbreach of a lease agreement?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and it\r\n  is clear that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist,\r\n  the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence\r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Houck v.\r\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326,\r\n  329 (2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI. Summary judgment in\r\n  Landlordâ€™s eviction action\r\nTenants\r\n  argue that the circuit court erred in affirming the magistrateâ€™s grant of\r\n  summary judgment to Landlord because the lease agreement signed by the parties\r\n  only provides for the termination of the lease by Tenants, and therefore,\r\n  Landlord did not have grounds for eviction.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  purpose of the rules of contract construction is to ascertain the intention of\r\n  the parties as gathered from the contents of the entire document and not from\r\n  any particular provision within the contract.Â  Litchfield Co. of S.C., Inc.\r\n    v. Kiriakides, 290 S.C. 220, 223,&nbsp;349 S.E.2d 344, 346 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986). Â Where&nbsp;one interpretation of a contract makes it unusual or\r\n  extraordinary and another interpretation, equally consistent with the language\r\n  employed, would make it reasonable, fair, and just, the latter construction\r\n  prevails.Â  Farr v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 362, 218 S.E.2d\r\n  431, 434 (1975).&nbsp;Â  An interpretation which establishes the\r\n  more reasonable and probable agreement\r\n  of the parties should be adopted while an interpretation leading\r\n  to an absurd result should be avoided.Â  Id.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  Tenantsâ€™ interpretation, Tenants leasehold estate essentially trumps Landlordâ€™s\r\n  fee simple interest in the residence and gives Tenants a perpetual tenancy in\r\n  the rental property.Â  We find that this is an absurd result that could not have\r\n  possibly been intended by Landlord when she agreed to rent the residence.Â \r\n  Rather, under the terms of the agreement, Landlord and Tenants created a\r\n  month-to-month tenancy when the term of the original year lease expired in August\r\n  2003.Â  See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-35-30 (2007) (providing that\r\n  tenancies of real estate other than agricultural lands shall be deemed from\r\n  month to month unless there otherwise agreed).Â  A landlord or tenant may\r\n  terminate a month-to-month tenancy by a written notice at least thirty days\r\n  before the termination date specified in the notice.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  27-40-770(b).\r\nTo\r\n  this end, Tenants argue that they did not receive proper notice of termination\r\n  from Landlord.Â  We disagree.Â  The Residential Landlord and Tenant Act which\r\n  governs the lease agreement provides that a person gives notice to another â€œby\r\n  taking steps reasonably calculated to inform the other in ordinary course\r\n  whether or not the other actually comes to know of it.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§ 27-40-240(b)\r\n  (2007).Â  A person has notice of a fact if â€œfrom all the facts and circumstances\r\n  known to him at the time in question he has reason to know that it exists.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§ 27-40-240(a)(3) (2007). \r\nThe\r\n  record reveals that Landlord instituted multiple notices to Tenants, beginning\r\n  at least with the February 2005 letter, expressing Landlordâ€™s desire to\r\n  terminate the rental arrangement.Â  Despite Landlordâ€™s desire to stop leasing\r\n  the premises to Tenants, Landlord agreed the following month to permit Tenants\r\n  to continue renting the premises until a specific date that Tenants stated was\r\n  convenient for them to move.Â  It was only after Tenants revealed their\r\n  intentions to take advantage of Landlordâ€™s generosity by refusing to leave the\r\n  premises on the specified date and establishing their own terms of rental that\r\n  Landlord sent a final written notice of termination in January 2006 and brought\r\n  the present action one month later. \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we find that the partiesâ€™ lease agreement established a month-to-month\r\n  tenancy for which Landlord provided proper notice of termination to Tenants and\r\n  that Tenantsâ€™ further occupancy after August 9, 2005, constituted proper\r\n  grounds for eviction.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court properly\r\naffirmed the grant of summary judgment to Landlord.\r\n\r\nII. Recusal\r\nTenants\r\n  argue that the circuit court judge erred in declining to recuse himself in this\r\n  matter.Â  We disagree.\r\nA judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in\r\n  which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including instances\r\n  where he has a personal bias or prejudice against a party.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 524, 599 S.E.2d 114, 118 (2004)\r\n  (citing Rule 501, SCACR, Canon 3(E)(1)(a)).Â \r\n  It is not sufficient for a party seeking disqualification to simply allege\r\n  bias; rather, the party must show some evidence of bias or prejudice. Id.Â  If there is no evidence of judicial bias or prejudice, a judgeâ€™s failure\r\n  to disqualify himself will not be reversed on appeal.Â  Id.\r\nTenantsâ€™ dramatic recitation in their brief alleging that\r\n  Judge Barberâ€™s order â€œstems from his subconscious and irremediable biasâ€\r\n  against Tenant Faltas is completely unfounded.Â  Tenants moved for the judgeâ€™s recusal\r\n  based solely on a perceived bias from the fact that Judge Barber had ruled\r\n  against Tenant Faltas in a previous matter.Â  We find nothing disingenuous in\r\n  Judge Barberâ€™s explanation that he routinely heard cases involving parties who\r\n  had previously appeared in front of him and that this did not affect his\r\n  ability to remain neutral.Â  Furthermore, Tenants fail to point this Court to\r\n  any evidence in the record showing actual bias or prejudice on the part of the\r\n  judge.Â  Instead, the record displays a trial court order that accurately cites\r\n  the applicable law and reaches a sound conclusion based on application of the\r\n  law to the facts on the record in this case.Â  See id. (acknowledging\r\n  that a judgeâ€™s impartiality might\r\n  reasonably be questioned when the record does not support the judgeâ€™s factual\r\n  findings).Â  Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court judge properly denied\r\n  Tenantsâ€™ motion for recusal.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to Tenantsâ€™ allegations of Judge Barberâ€™s ex parte communications with\r\n  Landlordâ€™s counsel as a basis for recusal, we find that in the first instance,\r\n  these matters are not preserved for review because they were not raised to or\r\n  ruled upon either at trial or in Tenant Faltasâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion.Â  See\r\n    Iâ€™On, LLC v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724\r\n  (2000) (holding that an issue not raised to and ruled upon by the lower court\r\n  is not preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nTurning\r\n  to the merits, we uphold the validity of Judge Barberâ€™s order and find nothing\r\n  to suggest that the alleged ex parte communication prejudiced Tenants in any\r\n  way.Â  See Burgess v. Stern, 311 S.C. 326, 331, 428 S.E.2d 880, 884\r\n  (1993) (adopting a subjective approach to reviewing orders potentially infected\r\n  by ex parte communications).Â  In his order denying rehearing, Judge Barber provided\r\n  a detailed description of the circumstances underlying the alleged ex parte\r\n  communication which, in our view, amounts to Landlordâ€™s counselâ€™s failure to\r\n  observe Rule 5(b)(3), SCRCP (requiring counsel to serve copies of proposed\r\n  orders on all counsel of record) and no impropriety on Judge Barberâ€™s part.Â  Judge\r\n  Barber explained that the trial courtâ€™s order was already being drafted when\r\n  the order drafted by Landlordâ€™s counsel was received and that counselâ€™s draft order\r\n  did not influence the trial courtâ€™s final decision.Â  Further considering that\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s order exhibits sound legal reasoning based on applying the\r\n  law to the facts on the record, we simply can find no basis for invalidating\r\n  Judge Barberâ€™s order.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we uphold the validity of the circuit courtâ€™s order and we affirm\r\n  the circuit court judgeâ€™s refusal to recuse himself.Â  Â \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Burden of proof in eviction proceedings\r\nTenants\r\n  argue that because of the constitutional implications of seizing a personâ€™s\r\n  â€œhome,â€ eviction proceedings require a court to find at least â€œclear and convincing\r\n  proofâ€ of a tenantâ€™s breach of a lease agreement.Â  We find that this issue is\r\n  not preserved for review because it was not raised to or ruled upon at trial or\r\n  in Tenant Faltasâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion.[1]Â  See Iâ€™On, 338 S.C. at 422, 526 S.E.2d at 724.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to Landlord in\r\n  this matter.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] To the extent that Tenantsâ€™ argument on the standard\r\n  of proof for eviction proceedings segues into an argument that they were\r\n  entitled to a jury trial on their counterclaims alleging Landlord charged a\r\n  rental rate above fair market value, we disagree.Â  Tenantsâ€™ claim of an\r\n  excessive rental rate is based on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-310 which provides\r\n  that â€œ[i]n the absence of an agreement, the tenant shall pay as rent the\r\n  fair-market rental value for . . . the dwelling unit.â€Â  Because the magistrate\r\n  found that an agreement existed between the parties which established a\r\n  month-to-month tenancy at $795 per month, this statutory provision is\r\n  inapplicable and therefore, a juryâ€™s factual determination of the fair-market\r\n  rental value is irrelevant.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26533","title":"Oâ€™Brien v.

Â Actuaries have computed the Cityâ€™s unfunded OPEBs\r\n  liability to be $32 million as of fiscal year 2007, with an annual required\r\n  contribution for 2007 of $3.4 million.[3]Â Â  \r\nGASB\r\n  45 allows a governmental entity to pay its annual required contribution into an\r\n  irrevocable trust established to earn a return sufficient to meet all current\r\n  and future OPEBs obligations.Â  However, GASB 45 does not establish what kind of\r\n  investments in which the trust must invest.Â  In connection with this case, John\r\n  Garrett, a member of the American Academy of Actuaries, reviewed types of\r\n  trusts to determine the rate of return.Â  Garrett opined that a trust investing\r\n  only in governmental debt funds would yield a 4.5 percentage annual rate of return,\r\n  while a trust investing in equity securities would yield 7.5 percentage annual\r\n  rate of return.Â  Thus, investing in equity securities would require a smaller\r\n  annual contribution to fully fund the OPEBs.Â  \r\nThe Municipal\r\n  Association of South Carolina established the South Carolina Other Retirement\r\n  Benefits Investment Trust (referred to as â€œORBITâ€ or the â€œtrustâ€), to receive\r\n  funds from municipalities, to invest those funds in a way seeking the highest\r\n  rate of return, and to disburse those funds in order to defray the future\r\n  expenses of OPEBs. It is undisputed that the primary purpose of the trust is to\r\n  provide the municipalities with a vehicle to facilitate investing in the stock\r\n  market.Â  The parties have stipulated that ORBIT is a creature of South Carolina trust law and is not organized as a corporation, limited liability company,\r\n  or partnership.Â  The parties also stipulate that ORBIT was not organized under\r\n  the statutes governing the creation or operation of a political subdivision. \r\nParticipating\r\n  employers contribute funds to the trust, and the Board of Trustees of the\r\n  trust, made up of seven elected or appointed members from the various\r\n  participating municipalities, holds legal title to the trust assets. ORBIT is\r\n  an irrevocable trust, protected from creditors of participating employers, and\r\n  the Board of Trustees has the authority to invest the funds in a variety of\r\n  investments, including publicly traded stocks and securities, stock and\r\n  bond mutual funds, derivative funds, government and corporate bonds, United\r\n  States Treasury notes and bonds, and certificates of deposit.Â  Participating\r\n  employers may not recover any assets paid into the trust, and the funds paid in\r\n  are maintained for OPEBs even if the employer decides to no longer participate\r\n  in the trust, unless the employer decides to no longer provide OPEBs.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  order to comply with GASB 45 and to fully fund its OPEBs liability, the City\r\n  passed a resolution deciding to be the first municipality to invest in ORBIT in\r\n  June 2007.Â  Although GASB 45 does not require that investment trusts contain\r\n  equity securities, the City indicated to ORBIT that it would invest in the\r\n  trust only on the condition that the investment portfolio include equity\r\n  securities.Â  The City expected to make payments to the trust from public funds,\r\n  and the City set its millage rates and other taxes and fees for 2007 at levels\r\n  expected to be sufficient to fund these payments into the trust.Â  On August 14,\r\n  2007, Thomas Oâ€™Brien, a twenty-nine-year City employee and future recipient of offered\r\n  OPEBs, filed the declaratory judgment action against ORBIT, its Board members,\r\n  the City, and the Municipal Association (collectively, Respondents) in this\r\n  Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction, seeking a declaration that the Cityâ€™s\r\n  participation in ORBIT was unconstitutional, violated statutory law, was an ultra\r\n    vires act, and violated public policy.Â  The Court granted Oâ€™Brienâ€™s request\r\n  for review pursuant to its original jurisdiction.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nOâ€™Brien argues that the Cityâ€™s actions violate Article X, Â§ 11 of\r\n  the State Constitution. Â We agree. \r\nArticle\r\n  X, Â§ 11 of the South Carolina Constitution provides:\r\n\r\n  The credit of neither the State nor any of its political\r\n    subdivisions shall be pledged or loaned for the benefit of any individual,\r\n    company, association, corporation, or any religious or other private education\r\n    institution except as permitted by Section 3, Article XI of this Constitution\r\n    [providing for the establishment of free public schools].Â  Neither the State\r\n    nor any of its political subdivisions shall become joint owner of or\r\n    stockholder in any company, association, or corporation.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art.\r\n  X, Â§ 11.Â  The section specifically provides for investment in equity securities\r\n  in only two instances.Â  First, it provides that â€œendowment funds donated\r\n  specifically to state-supported institutions of higher learning and held by the\r\n  State Treasurer may be invested and reinvested in equity securities.â€Â  Id.Â  The section goes on to allow municipalities, counties, or special purpose\r\n  districts that provide firefighting services to invest and reinvest firefighter\r\n  pension funds in equity securities.Â  Id.Â  Nothing in this section\r\n  provides the authority for municipalities to invest funds intended for OPEBs in\r\n  equity securities.Â  A recent amendment allows â€œthe funds of the various\r\n  state-operated retirement systemsâ€ to be invested and reinvested in equity\r\n  securities.Â  S.C. Const. art. X, Â§ 16.Â  The amendment does not indicate it also\r\n  applied to the investment of funds from municipality-operated retirement systems\r\n  in equity securities. \r\nA clear\r\n  reading of Article X holds that a municipality cannot invest in equity\r\n  securities.Â  The main section generally bars investments in securities with the\r\n  exception of higher education and firefighter pensions.Â  A constitutional\r\n  amendment was required to allow the State to invest state retirement system\r\n  funds in equity securities.Â  If merely contributing the funds to a trust that\r\n  then invested in equity securities would have allowed the State to avoid the\r\n  prohibitions of Article X, the constitutional amendment would have been\r\n  unnecessary.Â  Further, allowing the City to invest in equity securities through\r\n  a trust violates the intent of Article X:Â  to protect public funds from risky\r\n  investments.[4]Â  \r\nIt is\r\n  troubling that the City attempted to avoid the constitutional prohibition on\r\n  investing in equity securities, thereby using government funds to jointly own a\r\n  company with other investors, by merely setting up a trust.[5]Â  Although ORBIT is set up as a trust,\r\n  it functions as an investment manager for the City and, as such, is no\r\n  different than any other investment house (Merrill Lynch, Oppenheimer, etc.).Â \r\n  The veneer of a trust does not change that.Â  More importantly, the status of\r\n  ORBIT as a trust is irrelevant.Â  Article X, Â§ 11 concerns the investing of government funds.Â  The investment takes place when the City transfers money\r\n  to the trust to be used for the expressed purchase of equity securities.Â  It is\r\n  abundantly clear from the record that the Cityâ€™s investment in ORBIT is for the\r\n  expressed purpose of circumventing the constitution.Â  The Cityâ€™s investments\r\n  violated the constitutional prohibition. \r\nThe investment power of the City, and other members of ORBIT, is\r\n  limited by statute as well. Specifically, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-30 (2004) (â€œEach\r\n  municipality of the State, in addition to the powers conferred to its specific\r\n  form of government, may enact regulations, resolutions, and ordinances, not\r\n  inconsistent with the Constitution and general law of this State . . . .â€);\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-5-10 (Supp. 2007) (providing that political subdivisions are\r\n  authorized to invest money subject to their control in:Â  (1) obligations of the\r\n  United States; (2) obligations issued by the Federal Financing Bank; (3)\r\n  general obligations of the State of South Carolina or any of its political\r\n  subdivisions; (4) insured savings and loan associations; (5) collaterally\r\n  secured certificates of deposit; (6) repurchase agreements when collateralized\r\n  by securities; (7) no load open-end or closed-end management type investment\r\n  companies or investment trusts if the portfolio is limited to obligations of\r\n  the United States, Federal Financing Bank, State of South Carolina, or repurchase agreements; and (8) no more than forty percent of funds generated by\r\n  hospitals in notes, bonds, guaranteed investment contracts, debentures, or\r\n  other contracts issued by a bank where a political subdivision receives\r\n  Medicaid funds appropriated by the General Assembly); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-6-30\r\n  (2004) (providing that the Treasurer may sell to all political subdivisions\r\n  participation units in the South Carolina Pooled Investment Fund); S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 11-1-60 (1986) (providing the State or political subdivisions may invest\r\n  funds in its custody in shares of federal savings and loan associations when\r\n  the shares are insured by the federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation,\r\n  and also in bonds or debentures issued by any federal home loan bank); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 11-1-70 (1986 &amp; Supp. 2007) (noting that public agencies may\r\n  invest pension funds in obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by the\r\n  International Bank and the obligations shall be eligible as deposits of\r\n  collateral, as security for the deposit of public funds, and for all other\r\n  types of deposits made with any public agency).Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  the specific mention of particular powers should not be construed as limiting\r\n  the general powers of a municipality, the specific statutes regarding\r\n  authorized investments by political subdivisions expresses a clear legislative\r\n  intent to create an exhaustive list of authorized investments.Â  Section\r\n  6-5-10(a)(7) is particularly enlightening.Â  It provides that a political\r\n  subdivision may place public funds in â€œno load open-end or closed-end . . .\r\n  investment trusts . . . if the portfolio of the trustâ€ is limited to\r\n  obligations of the United States, obligations of the Federal Financing Bank,\r\n  obligations of the State of South Carolina, or purchase agreements\r\n  collateralized by securities.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-5-10(a)(7) (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  Thus, in addition to outlining the types of investments political subdivisions\r\n  may make, the Legislature limited the portfolio of certain trusts to the\r\n  same types of investments.Â  The Legislatureâ€™s limitation on authorized\r\n  investments does not provide for investing in equity securities or in trusts\r\n  that then invest in equity securities. \r\nRespondents,\r\n  however, urge a different interpretation of the statutes and argue the cited\r\n  statutes place limitations only on the investment of municipal money â€œsubject\r\n  to the control and jurisdictionâ€ and â€œunder the custodyâ€ of the political\r\n  subdivision.Â  Thus, respondents argue, the statutory restrictions, on their\r\n  face, do not apply to private trusts and do not apply to the investment in\r\n  equity securities by ORBIT because those funds are no longer under the custody\r\n  of or subject to the control of the City.Â  Respondents correctly cite the\r\n  statutory requirements that the money be subject to the political subdivisionâ€™s\r\n  control and that the specific statutes do not apply to private trusts.Â  This argument\r\n  is unavailing, however, because the statutes do not specify that a municipality\r\n  may invest in a private investment trust in the first place where the trust\r\n  includes equity securities in its portfolio.Â  \r\nFurther, it is our view that the particular trust the City has\r\n  invested in is an illegal trust.Â  To constitute a valid trust, the trust must\r\n  seek a valid, legal purpose.Â  90 C.J.S. Trusts Â§ 22 (2008) (â€œA trust may\r\n  be created for any purpose that is not illegal.Â  In the absence of a statute to\r\n  the contrary, a settlor may create a trust for any lawful purpose . . .â€).Â Â Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-404 states that a trust must be created only to\r\n  the extent its purposes are lawful and possible to achieve.Â Â Â  Because\r\n  the obvious purpose of ORBIT is to invest in equity securities and attempt to\r\n  circumvent the constitutional prohibition on investing in equity securities, it\r\n  had an illegal purpose. Absent the status of a trust, ORBIT is merely an\r\n  association of government officials and or employees who invest government\r\n  funds.Â  As such Article X, Â§ 11 clearly applies to them. Thus, we find ORBIT\r\n  should be dissolved with the money paid into the trust returned to the\r\n  members.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWhile investing\r\n  in a private, irrevocable investment trust is permitted to satisfy GASB 45 and would\r\n  be a way for governmental entities to use public funds to earn a good rate of\r\n  return, the requirements of GASB 45 cannot override the requirements of our\r\n  constitution.Â  Because it is unconstitutional for the City to invest in equity\r\n  securities, it is likewise unconstitutional for the City to invest in a trust\r\n  that then invests in equity securities.Â  Accordingly, we declare the Cityâ€™s\r\n  investment in ORBIT unconstitutional, order ORBIT dissolved, and require the\r\n  return of funds invested to the members.Â  \r\nDECLARED\r\n  UNCONSTITUTIONAL. \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that municipalities may not invest in the\r\n  ORBIT trust, but write separately because I base my decision upon the absence\r\n  of any statutory authority permitting a political subdivision to invest funds\r\n  in such a trust.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-5-10 (Supp. 2007) (â€œAuthorized\r\n  investments by political subdivisionsâ€); see also Â§Â§ 6-6-30, 11-1-60,\r\n  and 11-1-70.Â  I disagree with the majorityâ€™s characterization of ORBITâ€™s status\r\n  as a trust as a â€œveneer,â€ its characterization of a trust settlor as an owner,\r\n  and its suggestion that the trust â€œis no different than any other investment\r\n  house. . . .â€ Â Moreover, I do not agree that we should order that the trust be\r\n  dissolved as in my view there is no flaw inherent in the trust itself, rather\r\n  the problem lies in the inability of municipalities to participate in it.Â  In a\r\n  similar vein, the funds in the trust should be distributed as provided in the\r\ntrust instruments, not returned to â€œthe members.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  Oâ€™Brien also asks the Court to determine whether the Cityâ€™s actions constituted\r\n  an ultra vires act or violated public policy.Â  Because we find the\r\n  Cityâ€™s actions were unconstitutional, we need not reach these issues.Â  \r\n[2] Â GASB 45 must be implemented on a rolling three-year schedule based on the size\r\n  of the governmental entityâ€™s revenues.Â  Governments, such as the City, with\r\n  revenues in excess of $100 million must implement GASB 45 by the end of their\r\n  fiscal year beginning after December 2006.Â  \r\n[3]Â \r\n  The funding required to comply with GASB 45 is enormous.Â  Respondents allege\r\n  the combined OPEBs liability for the State and school district employees on\r\n  June 30, 2006, was estimated to be $9.2 billion.Â Â  \r\n[4]Â \r\n  As pointed out by Respondents, constitutional provisions such as Article X were\r\n  adopted by many states in the late 1800s in response to the loss of public\r\n  funds invested in risky railroads.Â  A modern comparison would be the current\r\n  debacle with sub-prime lending.Â  Thus, the intent of the section is to protect\r\n  public funds from fraudulent and speculative investments.\r\n[5]Â \r\n  The City argues that it is merely a settlor of the trust and has no ownership\r\n  interest in it.Â  This argument is unpersuasive.Â  Interestingly, the trust\r\n  agreement requires that any benefits payable pursuant to the trust are made to\r\n  the member, i.e. the City, unless the member directs otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26534","title":"Sloan v.

Sloan, Jr., filed a declaratory judgment action challenging\r\n  respondentsâ€™[1] decision to authorize an emergency procurement on a construction project in Charleston County.Â  This is a direct appeal from the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary\r\n  judgment in favor of the DOT.[2]Â \r\n  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2000, the DOT procured construction on Ladson Road in Charleston County from Eagle Construction Company (Eagle).Â  The Ladson Road Project\r\n  involved the widening of the road from two lanes to five lanes.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  DOTâ€™s director of construction, Dan Shealy, testified at deposition that Eagle\r\n  consistently got behind on the project and the department granted Eagle time\r\n  extensions.Â  On February 19, 2004, there was a public meeting held between the\r\n  DOT, Eagle, and the community.[3]Â \r\n  Several milestones were set for Eagle at this meeting; however, these\r\n  milestones were never met.\r\nOn August 31, 2004, Shealy wrote a letter to Eagle which noted\r\n  that the completion date on the contract was August 16, 2004, but as of that\r\n  date, only 73% of the project was complete.Â  The letter also stated the\r\n  following:Â  â€œBased on Eagleâ€™s repeated failure to provide sufficient labor and\r\n  equipment to perform the work with the project scheduleâ€¦, Eagle Construction is\r\n  hereby declared to be in default on this contract.â€Â  The letter further advised\r\n  that Eagle had 15 days to cure the default, otherwise the contract would be\r\n  terminated.\r\nOn September 2, 2004, however, the DOT rescinded the default\r\n  letter and terminated the contract with Eagle based on â€œconvenience.â€Â  Shealy\r\n  explained that if Eagle had been placed in default, the contract would have\r\n  been turned over to the bonding company.Â  The bonding company would then have\r\n  been responsible for the process of bringing in another contractor to complete\r\n  the project for the originally-contracted price.Â  Shealy estimated this process\r\n  would have taken the bonding company six months.Â  If the DOT had itself\r\n  performed a competitive bidding process for a replacement contractor, Shealy\r\n  estimated this would have taken four months.\r\nInstead, approximately two weeks after the DOT terminated Eagle\r\n  from the project, Sanders Brothers Construction Company (Sanders) - an existing\r\n  subcontractor on the Ladson Road Project - began working on the project.[4]Â  Although approximately five to six\r\n  million dollars remained unpaid on the Eagle contract, the DOT directly\r\n  negotiated a contract with Sanders for just under eight million dollars.[5]Â  In other words, the DOT did not\r\n  solicit for bids to complete the project.Â  \r\nOn September 27, 2004, Shealy wrote a memorandum to the DOTâ€™s\r\n  Executive Director, Elizabeth Mabry, which included the following language:\r\n\r\n  Due to the significant delays on this project and enormous\r\n    inconvenience to the public because of these delays, I am requesting that we be allowed to\r\n    procure a replacement contractor through the emergency procurement provisions\r\n    provided by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-7-5-1620â€¦.\r\n  An emergency procurement is justified in this case based on public\r\n    safety and convenience.â€¦Â \r\n    A large number of residences and commercial businesses have been and are\r\n    continuing to be adversely impacted by the construction.Â  Traffic control\r\n    devices are in place throughout the majority of the project and at many high\r\n    volume intersections.Â  These conditions are an ongoing safety concern and also cause significant inconvenience for residences and business owners.Â \r\n    Procurement of a replacement contract through the standard bidding procedures\r\n    would cause an unacceptable delay and increase frustration among the already\r\n    frustrated public that live and conduct business in the area.Â  In order to\r\n    minimize safety concerns and disruption to the public and to prevent further\r\n    delays to the completion of the project, I recommend that we procure a\r\n    replacement contractor utilizing a negotiated contract method as allowed under\r\n    our emergency provisions.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).Â  The Executive Director approved this request.Â  Thereafter, the DOT\r\n  Commission approved the emergency procurement at its November 18, 2004,\r\n  meeting.Â  \r\nAt his\r\n  deposition, Shealy explained that the emergency conditions were â€œ[j]ust the\r\n  safety of the individuals getting in and out of their driveways; the\r\n  businesses; the entrance and exits for the business; and just a general\r\n  traveling through that work zone was a hazard.â€Â  Yet, he conceded there is\r\n  â€œalways a hazard in a work zone, from beginning to end.â€Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  asked what other circumstances had prompted the DOT to authorize emergency\r\n  procurements, Shealy noted that Hurricane Hugo andÂ  Hurricane Floyd had both\r\n  necessitated emergency procurements, for debris removal and flood prevention,\r\n  respectively.\r\nPrior to Sanders signing the contract with the DOT, Sloan had read\r\n  in the newspaper about a negotiated contract between the DOT and Sanders.Â  In a\r\n  conversation with Sloan, Sandersâ€™ vice president denied any intention to sign a\r\n  negotiated contract. \r\nOn October 28, 2004, Sloan sent a letter to the chairman of the\r\n  DOT Commission requesting the following materials pursuant to the South\r\n  Carolina Freedom of Information Act (FOIA):Â  (1) the document terminating\r\n  Eagleâ€™s contract; (2) the contract between the DOT and Sanders; and (3) the\r\n  minutes of the Commission meetings during which these actions were authorized.Â \r\n  The DOT responded to the FOIA request on November 30, 2004.Â  Sloan filed a\r\n  follow&#8209;up FOIA request on December 1, 2004, which the DOT responded to on\r\n  December 16, 2004.Â  \r\nOn January 6, 2005, Sloan filed this\r\n  declaratory judgment action against the DOT.Â  He alleged that no emergency\r\n  existed to justify the DOTâ€™s procurement without a published invitation for\r\n  bids.Â  Sloan sought an injunction prohibiting respondents from paying for the\r\n  construction and a declaratory judgment that the procurement was illegal,\r\n  invalid, and ultra vires.\r\nSanders\r\n  completed the construction work by the March 31, 2005, deadline set in the\r\n  contract.\r\nThe\r\n  parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in 2006.Â  In an order filed\r\n  May 22, 2006, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the DOT.Â \r\n  The trial court found that Sloan did not have standing, the action was moot,\r\n  and, on the merits, the DOT complied with the emergency procurement provisions.Â \r\n  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1. Does an exception to\r\n    the mootness doctrine apply to permit appellate review?Â  \r\n  2. Does Sloan have\r\n    standing to maintain this action?Â  \r\n  3. Was the DOTâ€™s use of\r\n    an emergency procurement proper? \r\n  4. Does the doctrine of laches\r\n    bar Sloanâ€™s claim? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThis Court reviews the grant of a summary judgment\r\n  motion under the same standard as the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c),\r\n  SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Â E.g., Burriss v. Anderson County Bd. of Educ.,&nbsp;369 S.C. 443, 451, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 482, 486&nbsp;(2006).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the parties agree there are no material factual disputes.Â  Thus, the\r\n  matter turns only on legal issues.\r\n1.Â \r\n  Mootness\r\nThe DOT\r\n  argues that because the construction project has been completed, the trial\r\n  court correctly found that the instant case is moot.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis\r\n  Court â€œwill not pass on moot and academic questions or make an adjudication\r\n  where there remains no actual controversy.â€Â  E.g., Curtis v. State,&nbsp;345\r\n  S.C. 557, 567, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596&nbsp;(2001); accord Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 552, 590 S.E.2d 338, 349&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (Greenville\r\n  County I) (â€œcases or issues which have become moot or academic in nature\r\n  are not a proper subject of reviewâ€).Â  \r\nThere\r\n  are, however, three exceptions to the mootness doctrine.Â  Curtis v. State,\r\n  345 S.C. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596.Â  First, if the issue raised is capable of\r\n  repetition but generally will evade review, the appellate court can take\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  E.g., id.; Sloan v. Department of Transp.,\r\n  365 S.C. 299, 303, 618 S.E.2d 876, 878&nbsp;(2005); Byrd\r\n  v. Irmo High Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996).Â  â€œSecond, an\r\n  appellate court may decide questions of imperative and manifest urgency to\r\n  establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public interest.â€Â  Curtis\r\n  v. State, 345 S.C. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596.Â  Third, â€œif a decision by the\r\n  trial court may affect future events, or have collateral consequences for the\r\n  parties, an appeal from that decision is not moot, even though the appellate\r\n  court cannot give effective relief in the present case.â€Â  Id.; accord Sloan v. Department of Transp., 365 S.C. at 303, 618 S.E.2d at 878.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the issue of whether the DOT properly authorized the emergency procurement\r\n  is one that is capable of repetition, yet will usually evade review.[6]Â \r\n  For example, here an emergency procurement came four years into the\r\n  construction project, which was then completed within about six months.Â  The\r\n  project was completed only a few months after Sloan filed suit and well before\r\n  the parties filed motions for summary judgment.Â  Therefore, the â€œcapable of\r\n  repetition but evading reviewâ€ exception to mootness applies here.Â  See Greenville\r\n  County I, 356 S.C. at 555, 590 S.E.2d at 351 (where the Court of Appeals\r\n  found that Sloanâ€™s case, which presented an issue related to the procurement\r\n  codeâ€™s design-build exception, was one that was likely to recur but evade\r\n  review because â€œdesign-build source selection\r\n  accelerates the process of awarding public works contracts and the ultimate\r\n  completion of the projects themselvesâ€).\r\nÂ Moreover,\r\n  a decision on the merits of this case certainly will affect future events, to\r\n  wit, how the DOT decides to authorize emergency procurements in the future.\r\nIn\r\n  addition, respondents contend that Sloan has failed to show that the case\r\n  involves a question of â€œimperative and manifest urgency.â€\r\nThis\r\n  Court has noted â€œthe limited nature of the exception for questions of â€˜imperative\r\n  and manifest urgency.â€™â€&nbsp; Sloan v. Greenville County, 361 S.C. 568,\r\n  571, 606 S.E.2d 464, 466&nbsp;(2004) (Greenville County II).Â  In Greenville County II, we held that where judicial guidance exists on\r\n  the legal issue presented, there is no imperative and manifest urgency for an\r\n  advisory opinion.\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, however, there is no case law specifically addressing the\r\n  DOTâ€™s authorization of an emergency procurement.Â  Because this is a matter of\r\n  public importance which could occur at any time (given the inherent\r\n  unpredictability of emergencies), we find there is an urgent nature to this\r\n  issue.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  even though the Ladson Road Project was completed in 2005, we will address the other\r\n  issues raised in the case.\r\n2.Â  Standing\r\nSloan argues his\r\n  status as a taxpayer grants him standing to bring this case.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Sloan contends that the issue in this case is one of great public importance\r\n  which justifies standing.Â  We agree.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  â€œa private individual may not invoke the judicial power to\r\n  determine the validity of an executive or legislative act unless the private\r\n  individual can show that, as a result of that action, a direct injury has been\r\n  sustained, or that there is immediate danger a direct injury will be\r\n  sustained.â€Â  Sloan v. Wilkins,&nbsp;362 S.C. 430, 436, 608 S.E.2d 579,\r\n  582-83&nbsp;(2005).Â  Nonetheless, â€œ[a] taxpayerâ€™s standing to challenge\r\n  unauthorized or illegal governmental acts has been repeatedly recognized in South Carolina,â€ Sloan v. School Dist. of Greenville County, 342 S.C. 515, 520, 537\r\n  S.E.2d 299, 301&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000), and indeed has been repeatedly recognized\r\n  as to Sloan himself.Â  See, e.g., id.; Sloan v.\r\n  Department of Transp., 365 S.C. at 304, 618 S.E.2d at 878-79; Greenville County I, 356 S.C. at 548, 590 S.E.2d at 347.[7]Â \r\n  Furthermore, â€œ[s]tanding may be conferred upon a party â€˜when an issue is of\r\n  such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.â€™â€ Â Sloan\r\n  v. Wilkins,&nbsp;362 S.C. at 436-37, 608 S.E.2d at 583 (quoting Baird\r\n  v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 531, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999)).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals has stated that â€œ[t]he expenditure of public funds pursuant to\r\n  a competitive bidding statute is of immense public importance.â€Â  Sloan v.\r\n  School Dist. of Greenville County, 342 S.C. at 524, 537 S.E.2d at 303.Â  Numerous\r\n  other jurisdictions which have addressed taxpayer standing when the issue\r\n  involves competitive bidding requirements have specifically found that\r\n  competitive bidding laws are for the benefit of taxpayers. Â See id. at 521-22, 537 S.E.2d at 302-03 (and cases cited therein).Â  Indeed, the\r\n  requirement that contracts â€œonly be awarded through the process of competitive\r\n  sealed bidding demonstrates the lengths to which our government believes it\r\n  should go to maintain the publicâ€™s trust and confidence in governmental\r\n  management of public funds.â€Â  Id. at 524, 537 S.E.2d at 303.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find Sloan v. School Dist. of Greenville County is particularly instructive\r\n  on this issue.Â  In that case, the School District\r\n  procured construction contracts in February 1998 for three middle schools pursuant\r\n  to its own procurement codeâ€™s emergency exception to the competitive sealed bid\r\n  procedure. Â The District justified the need for the emergency procurement because\r\n  it wanted the construction of the schools completed before school started in\r\n  August 1999. Â The Court of Appeals found Sloan had standing, stating as\r\n  follows:Â  â€œthe public interest involved is the prevention of the\r\n  unlawful expenditure of money raised by taxation.Â  Public policy demands a\r\n  system of checks and balances whereby taxpayers can hold public officials\r\n  accountable for their acts.Â  Taxpayers must have some mechanism of enforcing\r\n  the law.â€Â  Id. at 523, 537 S.E.2d at 303&nbsp;(citation, quotation\r\n  marks, and alteration omitted).\r\nLikewise,\r\n  in this case, Sloan has standing because he has alleged a misuse of the\r\n  statutory emergency procurement provision and therefore an unlawful expenditure\r\n  by public officials.\r\n\r\n3.Â  Use of Emergency\r\n  Procurement\r\nSloan argues there was no sudden emergency\r\n  which justified the DOTâ€™s use of a negotiated contract.Â  We agree.\r\nContracts for the construction, maintenance, and\r\n  repair of highways and roads are specifically exempted from the South Carolina\r\n  Consolidated Procurement Code (Procurement Code).Â  SeeÂ Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 11-35-710 (Supp. 2007).Â  The procurement of\r\n  construction contracts for the state highway system is governed by the\r\n  following statute:\r\n\r\n  Awards\r\n    by the department of construction contracts for ten thousand dollars and more\r\n    shall be made only after the work to be awarded has been advertised for at\r\n    least two weeks in one or more daily newspapers in this State, but where\r\n    circumstances warrant, the department may advertise for longer periods of time and\r\n    in other publication media. Â Awards of contracts, if made, shall be made in\r\n    each case to the lowest qualified bidder whose bid shall have been formally\r\n    submitted in accordance with the requirements of the department. Â However,\r\n      in cases of emergencies, as may be determined by the Secretary of the\r\n      Department of Transportation, the department, without formalities of\r\n      advertising, may employ contractors and others to perform construction or\r\n      repair work or furnish materials and supplies for such construction and repair\r\n      work, but all such cases of this kind shall be reported in\r\n      detail and made public at the next succeeding meeting of the commission.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-1620\r\n  (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).Â  Thus, pursuant to section 57-5-1620, the\r\n  general rule regarding contracts for $10,000 or more is that the work must be\r\n  advertised for at least two weeks, and then the â€œlowest qualified bidderâ€ must\r\n  be chosen.Â  The only exception is â€œin cases of emergencies, as â€¦ determined\r\n  by the Secretary[8] of the Department of Transportation.â€\r\nThe DOT contends\r\n  the emergency procurement was proper because the statute requires only that the\r\n  DOT Director determine that an emergency exists and the contract be made public\r\n  at the next DOT Commission meeting.Â  Because those requirements were met in\r\n  this case, the DOT argues it properly complied with section 57-5-1620.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the DOT asserts that because section 57-5-1620 does not limit what\r\n  can constitute an emergency, the Directorâ€™s determination is discretionary.Â \r\n  Because the alternative to using the emergency procurement provision would have\r\n  been to leave the construction project unfinished - and therefore a dangerous\r\n  work zone - for four to six months, the DOT argues the facts of this case properly\r\n  support its decision.\r\nSloan, on the other\r\n  hand, argues that under the plain meaning of â€œemergency,â€ there was no\r\n  emergency in this case because the delays and safety hazards were present\r\n  throughout the first four years of the project.Â  Sloan also suggests the following\r\n  definitions under the Procurement Code and its regulations are instructive, and\r\n  that the instant case would not meet either definition.\r\nThe Procurement\r\n  Code includes the following section on emergency procurements:\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding\r\n    any other provision of this code, the chief procurement officer, the head of a\r\n    purchasing agency, or a designee of either officer may make or authorize others\r\n    to make emergency procurements only when there exists an immediate threat to\r\n      public health, welfare, critical economy and efficiency, or safety under\r\n      emergency conditions as defined in regulations promulgated by the board;\r\n    and provided, that such emergency procurements shall be made with as much\r\n    competition as is practicable under the circumstances. Â A written determination\r\n    of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular\r\n    contractor shall be included in the contract file.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-1570 (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).\r\nIn addition, the Procurement\r\n  Codeâ€™s regulations provide the following definition of emergency:\r\n\r\n  An emergency condition is a\r\n    situation which creates a threat to public health, welfare, or safety such as\r\n    may arise by reason of floods, epidemics, riots, equipment failures, fire loss,\r\n    or such other reason as may be proclaimed by either the\r\n    Chief Procurement Officer or the head of a purchasing agency or a designee of\r\n    either office. Â The existence of such conditions must create an immediate and\r\n    serious need for supplies, services, information technology, or construction\r\n    that cannot be met through normal procurement methods and the lack of which\r\n    would seriously threaten:\r\n  (1) the functioning of State government;\r\n  (2) the preservation or protection of property; or\r\n  (3) the health or safety of any person.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§\r\n  19-445.2110 (Supp. 2007). \r\nWe agree that these\r\n  definitions provide useful guidance, in a procurement setting, as to what\r\n  constitutes an emergency.Â  Moreover, we find that the plain meaning of\r\n  â€œemergencyâ€ also provides a guideline for interpreting section 57-5-1620.Â  See e.g., Key Corp. Capital, Inc. v. County of Beaufort, 373 S.C. 55,\r\n  59, 644 S.E.2d 675, 677&nbsp;(2007) (where a statuteâ€™s language is plain,\r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, the court has no right to impose\r\n  another meaning); Sloan v. Hardee,&nbsp;371 S.C. 495, 498-99, 640 S.E.2d\r\n  457, 459&nbsp;(2007) (â€œWhen a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on\r\n  their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court must apply\r\n  the statute according to its literal meaning.â€).\r\nAn\r\n  emergency is, by its very nature, a sudden, unexpected onset of a serious\r\n  condition. Â See The American Heritage Dictionary 448 (2nd College ed. 1982) (emergency defined as â€œ[a]n unexpected situation or sudden\r\n  occurrence of a serious and urgent nature that demands immediate actionâ€); Blackâ€™s\r\n  Law Dictionary 361 (6th ed. 1991) (defining emergency as â€œ[a]\r\n  sudden unexpected happening; an unforeseen occurrence or condition; â€¦ a sudden\r\n  or unexpected occasion for actionâ€).\r\nHere, there was a\r\n  five-mile construction zone which, according to the DOT, had â€œsafety concerns.â€Â \r\n  These hazards, however, had existed throughout the course of the construction\r\n  project and likely would have been present to some degree in any major\r\n  construction project of this type.Â  Put simply, these safety concerns did not\r\n  appear unexpectedly in September 2004 thereby suddenly creating a public safety\r\n  risk.Â  Furthermore, the record reflects that any urgency felt by the DOT was,\r\n  in large part, due to the delays on the project and the resultant frustration\r\n  by the affected community.Â  These factual circumstances, however, do not\r\n  constitute an emergency under section 57-5-1620, as that plain and ordinary\r\n  term was likely intended by the Legislature. Â See e.g., Key\r\n  Corp. Capital, Inc., supra; Sloan v. Hardee,&nbsp;supra.[9]\r\n We hold there was\r\n  no emergency that existed in September 2004 to substantiate the emergency\r\n  procurement authorized by the DOT.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred\r\n  in finding that the DOT complied with the emergency procurement provision found\r\n  in section 57-5-1620.\r\n4.Â  Laches\r\nAs an additional\r\n  sustaining ground, the DOT argues the doctrine of laches bars Sloanâ€™s claims.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œUnder\r\n  the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his rights, does not seasonably\r\n  assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his adversary to incur expenses\r\n  or enter into obligations or otherwise detrimentally change his position, then\r\n  equity will ordinarily refuse to enforce those rights.â€ \r\n  Chambers of S.C., Inc. v. County Council for Lee County, 315 S.C. 418,\r\n  421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280&nbsp;(1993).\r\nHere,\r\n  the DOT signed a contract with Sanders in October 2004.Â  Thereafter, Sloan\r\n  sought documents through a FOIA request, and then filed suit in January 2005.Â \r\n  There was no delay, and thus, laches does not apply.\r\nCONCLUSIONÂ  \r\nFor the\r\n  above-stated reasons, we find the DOTâ€™s procurement was invalid under section 57-5-1620.Â  Therefore, the decision of the circuit court is reversed\r\n  and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent\r\n  and adhere to the position I set forth in Sloan v. Dept. of Transp., 365\r\n  S.C. 299, 618 S.E.2d 876 (2005).Â  In my opinion, Sloan lacks standing to bring\r\n  this action because he cannot allege a particular harm.Â  Other potential\r\n  plaintiffs in this case, the construction companies who did not have the\r\n  opportunity to bid on the completion of the project, have interests greater\r\n  than Sloan in seeing the bidding process followed as required by law.Â \r\n  Accordingly, because there are potential parties capable of alleging direct and\r\n  distinct harm in this case, I would hold that Sloan does not have standing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondents include the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Transportation and the individual Department commissioners.Â \r\n  We will refer to respondents collectively as the DOT.\r\n[2] This case was certified for review from the Court of Appeals\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n[3] The people in the community (i.e., those in both\r\n  residences and businesses along Ladson Road) were â€œupsetâ€ by the construction\r\n  project.Â  A sign publicizing the community meeting read:Â  â€œBring a rope.â€\r\n[4] Shealy testified that a maintenance force from Dorchester County took care of the five-mile construction area for the interim two weeks.Â  The\r\n  record reflects that Sanders began acting as the replacement contractor in mid&#8209;September\r\n  2004. \r\n[5] The contract was signed on October 21, 2004.Â  Shealy\r\n  testified that in addition to the work left undone by Eagle, there was also\r\n  work that had been done which had to be corrected.\r\n[6] Although the DOT maintains this case is not capable of repetition because of\r\n  its unique facts, we do not agree that this situation - a construction project which\r\n  experiences substantial delays and then requires a replacement contractor - is\r\n  particularly unique.\r\n[7] In Sloan v. Department of Transp., Sloan v.\r\n  School Dist. of Greenville County, and Greenville County I, Sloan\r\n  raised issues related to construction procurements.\r\n[8] We note that section 57-5-1620 was amended in 2007,\r\n  but the only change made was substituting the word â€œSecretaryâ€ of the DOT for\r\n  the previously used term of â€œDirector.â€\r\n[9] See also Marshall v. Pasadena Unified Sch. Dist., 15 Cal.Rptr.3d 344 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004).Â  In Marshall , the court found that after a construction contract had been terminated\r\n  for convenience, the avoidance of competitive bidding through an emergency\r\n  resolution was improper.Â  There, the definition of emergency was â€œa sudden,\r\n  unexpected occurrence that poses a clear and imminent danger, requiring\r\n  immediate action to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health,\r\n  property, or essential public services.â€Â  Id. at 348.Â  The court stated\r\n  that â€œ[t]he purported emergency stemmed from the Districtâ€™s decision to\r\n  terminate its contract with [the original contractor] for the Districtâ€™s own\r\n  â€˜convenience.â€™Â  That event was not a â€˜sudden, unexpected occurrenceâ€™ posing a\r\n  clear and imminent danger requiring prompt action to protect life, health,\r\n  property, or essential public services.â€Â  Id. at 358.Â  The instant case\r\n  is similar in that the need for a replacement contractor came about because of\r\n  the DOTâ€™s termination of the contract with Eagle for the DOTâ€™s convenience.Â \r\n  Given the history of the contract with Eagle, the termination of the contract\r\n  cannot reasonably be viewed as a sudden, unexpected occurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26535","title":"Colleton Preparatory Academy, Inc. v.

Â The district court denied the motion\r\n  to set aside the default and made the following findings:Â  (1) Defendantâ€™s\r\n  product was defective and unreasonably dangerous for its foreseeable use\r\n  because of the structural lumberâ€™s propensity to lose strength; (2) Defendant\r\n  was negligent or reckless in advertising and marketing the FRT lumber to\r\n  building code officials, architects, truss manufacturers, and end users when it\r\n  knew or should have known the product was defective or unsuitable for use under\r\n  foreseeable conditions; (3) Defendant failed to provide adequate updates and\r\n  warnings; (4) Defendant admitted by its default and evidence introduced at the\r\n  damages hearing supported a conclusion that the FRT lumber posed a serious risk\r\n  of bodily harm; (5) Defendant admitted by its default, and evidence introduced\r\n  at the damages hearing supported a conclusion, that it had a duty to insure the\r\n  product met or exceeded industry standards and it violated that duty by\r\n  manufacturing and selling a product that was unreasonably dangerous; (6) for\r\n  purposes of the UTPA, Defendantâ€™s actions were unfair, capable of repetition,\r\n  and injurious to the public, and Defendant knew the FRT lumber was unsuitable\r\n  for its advertised use and it resulted in damages to Plaintiff; and (7)\r\n  although there is no evidence that Plaintiff dealt directly with Defendant,\r\n  Defendant admitted by its default that it marketed the product to end users\r\n  when it knew or should have known it was defective and unsuitable for use under\r\n  foreseeable conditions in roofing systems.Â  \r\nAfter a bench trial, the district court\r\n  awarded Plaintiff $871,619.15 in damages under the UTPA claim to cover the cost\r\n  of repairs to the roof trusses and temporary classroom expenses.[2]Â  The district court held that the\r\n  economic loss rule barred Plaintiff from recovering under a negligence theory because\r\n  the FRT wood was causing damage only to itself and not to persons or property.Â \r\n  After both parties filed for reconsideration, the district court filed an order\r\n  on January 31, 2006, requesting certification of questions regarding exceptions\r\n  to the economic loss doctrine and the necessity of privity in a UTPA claim.Â \r\n  After considering the motions for reconsideration and Plaintiffâ€™s motion to\r\n  amend the order of certification, the district court issued an order on\r\n  February 27, 2007, modifying the January 31, 2006 order to include the current\r\n  version of the two certified questions.Â  This Court accepted the certified\r\n  questions.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n In answering a certified question raising a novel\r\n  question of law, the Court is free to decide the question based on its\r\n  assessment of which answer and reasoning would best comport with the law and\r\n  public policies of the state as well as the Courtâ€™s sense of law, justice, and\r\n  right.

Co., 368 S.C. 153, 157, 628 S.E.2d 475, 477 (2006). \r\nCERTIFIED QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1)&nbsp;\r\n    Can the user of a\r\n  defective product recover in tort when only the product itself has been injured\r\n  and when the product either violated generally accepted industry standards or\r\n  posed a serious risk of bodily harm?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (2)\r\n    Can a plaintiff who\r\n  used but did not purchase a product directly from the defendant and nonetheless\r\n  suffered a loss as a result of the defendant&rsquo;s unfair or deceptive acts obtain\r\n  relief under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Economic Loss Doctrine\r\nThe first certified question does not specifically\r\n  mention the economic loss doctrine. Â However, it is clear from the district courtâ€™s\r\n  order and language used in the question that the district court seeks\r\n  clarification regarding whether the legal duties[3] to conform to industry standards and to avoid creating a serious risk of bodily\r\n  harm found in Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber &amp; Manufacturing Company,\r\n  299 S.C. 335, 384 S.E.2d 730 (1989), are limited to the residential housing\r\n  arena or whether they have wider application. \r\nInitially, we note that in Kennedy, this Court held\r\n  â€œa cause of action in negligence will be available where a builder has violated\r\n  a legal duty, no matter the type of resulting damage.Â  The â€˜economic lossâ€™ rule\r\n  will still apply where duties are created solely by contract.Â  In that\r\n  situation, no cause of action in negligence will lie.â€ Â Kennedy, 299\r\n  S.C. at 347, 384 S.E.2d at 737; see Dorrell v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 312, 318, 605 S.E.2d 12, 15 (2004) (noting paving\r\n  companyâ€™s contract with the State did not limit its liability in negligence to\r\n  third parties because the common law duty of due care existed outside of the\r\n  contract).Â  \r\nThe purpose of the economic loss rule is to define the\r\n  line between tort and contract recovery.Â  Kennedy, 299 S.C. at 345, 384\r\n  S.E.2d at 736 (â€œThis rule exists to assist in determining whether contract or\r\n  tort theories are applicable to a given case.â€).Â  The economic loss rule generally\r\n  provides there is no tort liability for a defective product if the product\r\n  damages only itself.Â  Id. at 341, 384 S.E.2d at 734.Â  â€œWhere a\r\n  purchaserâ€™s expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he bought\r\n  is not working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for he has\r\n  suffered only â€˜economicâ€™ losses.â€Â  Id. at 345, 384 S.E.2d at 736.Â \r\n  However, where a defective product harms other property or causes physical\r\n  injury, the losses are more than merely economic, the economic loss rule is\r\n  inapplicable, and a remedy lies in either tort or contract.Â  Id.; Kershaw\r\n    County Bd. of Educ. v. United States Gypsum Co., 302 S.C. 390, 393, 396\r\n  S.E.2d 369, 371 (1990) (finding the economic loss doctrine did not bar recovery\r\n  in an asbestos case because the defective product caused harm to â€œother\r\n  property,â€ including the rest of the building).[4]\r\nThis Court has continually expressed uneasiness with\r\n  the economic loss doctrine.Â  The majority view of the doctrine employs a legal\r\n  framework that focuses on consequence, not action.[5] Â We have said that this framework generates difficulties.Â  As a result, we\r\n  partially rejected the rule in the residential home building context, leaving\r\n  it viable in situations where a builder violates only a contractual duty.Â  Kennedy,\r\n  299 S.C. at 344, 384 S.E.2d at 736; Kershaw, 302 S.C. at 393, 396 S.E.2d\r\n  at 371.Â  Although the economic loss rule bars tort recovery where duties are\r\n  created solely by contract, we have long recognized tort actions for purely\r\n  economic losses as a result of a breach of a special legal duty outside the\r\n  contract. Â See Tommy L. Griffin Plumbing &amp; Heating v. Jordan,\r\n    Jones &amp; Goulding, Inc., 320 S.C. 49, 55, 463 S.E.2d 85, 88-89 (1995) (finding\r\n  design professionals, including engineers, may have a duty separate and\r\n  distinct from contractual duties such that the economic loss doctrine would not\r\n  prohibit a tort action); Beachwalk Villas Condo. Assâ€™n v. Martin, 305\r\n  S.C. 144, 146-47, 406 S.E.2d 372, 374 (1991) (finding a special duty for architects); Kennedy, 299 S.C. at 347, 384 S.E.2d at 738 (finding builders owe three\r\n  legal duties to home buyers beyond the contract); Lloyd v. Walters, 276\r\n  S.C. 223, 226, 277 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1981) (finding an attorney liable for\r\n  economic loss to a corporate shareholder when attorney breached a duty to the\r\n  corporation); Georganne Apparel v. Todd, 303 S.C. 87, 92, 399 S.E.2d 16,\r\n  18-19 (Ct. App. 1990) (dismissing an accountant malpractice case for failure to\r\n  prosecute); but see McCullough v. Goodrich &amp; Pennington\r\n    Mortgage Fund, Inc., 373 S.C. 43, 53, 644 S.E.2d 43, 49 (2007) (rejecting\r\n  the notion of a special duty in the secured transactions arena). \r\nIn Kennedy, we adopted a framework that changed\r\n  the focus of the inquiry from the consequences of the alleged tortfeasorâ€™s\r\n  actions to whether or not the alleged tortfeasor acted in a way that violated a\r\n  legal duty aside from his contractual duties.Â  If the act violates a\r\n  contractual duty only, then the liability is in contract; however, if the act\r\n  violates a non-contractual legal duty, then the liability is both in contract\r\n  and tort.Â  Kennedy, 299 S.C. at 345-46, 384 S.E.2d at 737.Â  This change\r\n  in analytical focus did not totally eviscerate the economic loss rule; however,\r\n  the rule is now less restrictive.Â  \r\nWe turn now to whether the legal duties found in Kennedy are applicable outside of the residential home building area generally.Â  \r\nViolation of Industry Standards[6]\r\nEvidence of industry standards has been\r\n  recognized by this Court as highly probative on the issue of defining the duty\r\n  of care.Â  Elledge v. Richland/Lexington Sch. Dist. Five, 352 S.C. 179, 189,\r\n  573 S.E. 2d 789, 795 (2002).Â  \r\nIn Kennedy, we considered the public policy of\r\n  protecting new home buyers from builders who â€œplace defective and inferior\r\n  construction into the stream of commerce.â€Â  Kennedy, 299 S.C. at 344,\r\n  384 S.E.2d at 736.Â  We found a builder owes legal duties to a home buyer beyond\r\n  the contract, and thus, a builder could be liable in tort for purely economic\r\n  losses, where:Â  â€œ(1) the builder has violated an applicable building code; (2)\r\n  the builder has deviated from industry standards; or (3) the builder has\r\n  constructed housing he knows or should know will pose a serious risk of\r\n  physical harm.â€Â  Id. at 347, 384 S.E.2d at 738.Â  \r\nThe Kennedy court concluded that an\r\n  expansion in traditional concepts of tort duty was needed in order to provide\r\n  the innocent home buyer with protection.Â  Kennedy, 299 S.C. at 334, 384\r\n  S.E. 2d at 735.Â  The court noted the inherent unequal bargaining positions, the\r\n  fact that buyers no longer supervised construction of their homes, and South Carolinaâ€™s acceptance of the legal maxim caveat venditor.Â  Id. at 343,\r\n  384 S.E.2d at 735.Â  \r\nThe same policy considerations noted in Kennedy are arguably not present in the commercial construction arena.Â  However, in Kennedy we expressed our approval of the legal maxim caveat venditor and\r\n  recognized a new framework for analysis that focused on the actorâ€™s actions,\r\n  not consequences.Â  In our view this analytical framework is universal.Â  Again,\r\n  focusing on whether or not the actor violated a non-contractual duty does not\r\n  eviscerate the economic loss doctrine; it only determines its applicability to\r\n  the case presented.\r\nBy focusing on the actorâ€™s actions in Kennedy,\r\n  we concluded that builders have a legal duty outside of the contract to make\r\n  products that meet industry standards.Â  Kennedy, 299 S.C. at 347, 384\r\n  S.E.2d at 738.Â  This Court has also stated that if a user of a product is a\r\n  member of the class for which the product was manufactured, the user is\r\n  entitled to a duty of care in manufacturing commensurate with industry\r\n  standards.Â  Terlinde v. Neely, 275 S.C. 395, 399, 271 S.E. 2d 768, 769\r\n  (1980) (â€œThe plaintiffs, being a member of the class for which the home was\r\n  constructed, are entitled to a duty of care in construction commensurate with\r\n  industry standards.â€).Â  However, this Court will not extend the concept of a\r\n  legal duty of care in tort liability beyond reasonable limits. Â See McCollough,\r\n  373 S.C. at 53, 644 S.E.2d at 49 (rejecting the notion of a special duty in the\r\n  secured transactions arena).Â  Industry standards are probative in defining the standard or duty of care; however, industry standards do not determine if the prerequisite duty of care is owed.Â  In other words, a violation\r\n  of industry standards is only helpful in determining that a duty owed has been\r\n  breached. Â Â \r\nIn the instant case, assuming that a duty of care is\r\n  owed to Colleton, a breach of industry standards would serve as evidence of Hooverâ€™s breach of that duty of care.Â  Being that the duty of care does not arise out of a\r\n  contract, the fact that only the product itself is injured is irrelevant.Â  Kennedy dictates that the focus of the inquiry is on Hooverâ€™s action, not the\r\n  consequence of the action.Â  Thus, the economic loss rule is not applicable and\r\n  would not bar recovery in tort.\r\nRisk of Serious Bodily Harm\r\nIn light of our framework of focusing on activity,\r\n  not just consequences, it is our view that parties should not have to wait\r\n  until a dangerous and defective product causes serious bodily injury before\r\n  seeking a tort action.Â  In this regard, we see no reason to treat commercial\r\n  parties differently from home buyers or other consumers.Â  See JKT\r\n    Co. v. Hardwick, 274 S.C. 413, 418, 265 S.E.2d 510, 512 (1980) (noting that\r\n  there is â€œno justifiable reason why an innocent corporate consumer should be\r\n  denied recovery [for lack of privity in an implied warranty action] when a\r\n  manufacturer places a defective article into commerceâ€).Â  Extending the legal duty to manufacture\r\n  products that do not pose a â€œserious threat of physical harmâ€ to the commercial\r\n  context would protect commercial\r\n  plaintiffs in the same way we sought to protect home buyers: Â a manufacturer\r\n  placing a dangerous, defective product into the stream of commerce would not\r\n  unfairly escape liability because only the defective product was injured and no\r\n  one was seriously hurt.Â  Further, the traditional lines between tort and\r\n  contract are not blurred by our decision because tort liability for purely\r\n  economic losses only attaches where there is a breach of these legal duties\r\n  beyond the contractual duties.Â  Kennedy, 299 S.C. at 345-46, 384 S.E.2d\r\n  at 737.\r\nExtending the serious threat of physical (bodily) harm\r\n  exception generally is consistent with our policy of providing a remedy where a\r\n  duty outside the contract is breached.Â  Manufacturers have a duty, separate and\r\n  apart from contractual duties, to create safe products, and they are liable for\r\n  poorly made products used in a foreseeable manner.Â  See Salladin v.\r\n    Tellis, 247 S.C. 267, 269-71, 146 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (1966) (noting a\r\n  manufacturer of an imminently dangerous product is liable in tort for physical harm\r\n  caused, regardless of whether the injured party is in privity of contract, when\r\n  put to its intended use). Â Other jurisdictions providing an exception where a\r\n  defective product poses a serious threat of physical harm have expressed the\r\n  same concerns regarding protecting an injured party in a general commercial\r\n  context from a fortuitous tortfeasor that we expressed in Kennedy. Â See Morris v. Osmose Wood Pres., 667 A.2d 624, 631-32 (Md. 1994) (noting that,\r\n  while not proven by the parties, Maryland nevertheless allows recovery for\r\n  purely economic losses where it is shown that there is a clear danger of death\r\n  or serious injury); Council of Co-Owners v. Whiting-Turner, 517 A.2d\r\n  336, 345 (1986) (focusing on the duty owed in an economic loss case, rather\r\n  than on the â€œfortuitous circumstance of the nature of the resultant damage,â€\r\n  and finding that one could recover in tort for purely economic losses â€œwhere\r\n  the risk is of death or personal injuryâ€);[7] see also Philadelphia Natâ€™l Bank v. Dow Chem. Co., 605 F.Supp. 60,\r\n  64 (E.D.Pa. 1985) (â€œPNBâ€) (noting that while the court was reluctant to\r\n  rely solely on evidence of damage to other property, the court found\r\n  Pennsylvania would allow recovery in strict liability because there was also\r\n  evidence that the defective product posed a serious risk to passers-by); Trustees\r\n    of Columbia Univ. v. Mitchell/Giurgola Assocs., 492 N.Y.S.2d 371, 376 (N.Y.\r\n  App. Div. 1985) (â€œColumbiaâ€) (finding that the economic loss rule did\r\n  not bar recovery, and the codefendants were entitled to contribution from\r\n  supplier, because a â€œwall rendered defective and in imminent danger of collapse\r\n  by improperly fabricated materials constitutes the type of dangerous product\r\n  for which the manufacturer owes a duty to the ultimate user under the doctrine\r\n  of strict liability bespeaks itselfâ€).[8]Â  \r\nWe are mindful that extending the serious threat of harm\r\n  exception may raise concerns that manufacturers would essentially become\r\n  insurers against every remote threat of harm.Â  This is not our intent, and we emphasize\r\n  that the exception applies to serious threats with recovery calculated\r\n  as the costs to repair or remove the dangerous product.[9] Â In order to limit situations where the exception applies, we adopt Marylandâ€™s balancing test:Â  the nature of the damage threatened and the probability that\r\n  the damage would occur should be examined to determine whether there is a\r\n  â€œclear, serious, and unreasonable risk of death or personal injury.â€Â  Morris,\r\n  667 A.2d at 631-32 (â€œWe examine both the nature of the damage threatened and the\r\n  probability of damage occurring to determine whether the two, viewed together,\r\n  exhibit a clear, serious, and unreasonable risk of death or personal injury.Â \r\n  Thus, if the possible injury is extraordinarily severe, i.e., multiple deaths,\r\n  we do not require the probability of the injury occurring to be as high as we\r\n  would require if the injury threatened were less severe, i.e., a broken leg or\r\n  damage to property.â€).Â  For\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we conclude the legal duties to avoid making products\r\n  which pose a serious risk of physical injury as found in Kennedy, extend\r\n  to manufacturers.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we answer the first certified\r\n  question, â€œno,â€ if there is merely a breach of industry standards without an\r\n  accompanying breach of a legal duty owed, and â€œyes,â€ if there is a breach of\r\n  duty accompanied by a clear, serious and unreasonable risk of bodily injury or\r\n  death.\r\n\r\nII. UTPA\r\nIn the order requesting certification, the district court\r\n  asked for clarification regarding whether a remote purchaser may\r\n  maintain a UTPA suit.Â  Based on the way this question is posed, we answer,\r\n  â€œyes.â€Â  \r\nUnder the UTPA, â€œ[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair\r\n  or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerceâ€ are\r\n  unlawful.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a) (1985).Â  Persons or any legal entity suffering\r\n  an ascertainable loss of money or real or personal property â€œas a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act\r\n  or practiceâ€ may bring an action to recover actual damages.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  39-5-140(a) (1985) (emphasis added).Â  To recover under the Act, a plaintiff\r\n  must prove a violation of the Act, proximate cause, and damages.Â  Charleston\r\n    Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 318 S.C. 471, 482, 458 S.E.2d 431, 438\r\n(Ct. App. 1995). \r\nIn their UTPA discussions, the district court and the parties\r\n  to this action focus primarily on Reynolds v. Ryland Group, Incorporated,\r\n  340 S.C. 331, 531 S.E.2d 917 (2000), and request clarification of whether this\r\n  case holds a general privity requirement for UTPA claims. Â In Reynolds,\r\n  this Court answered the following certified question from the district court:Â \r\n  â€œUnder South Carolina law, can Plaintiffs in a residential construction defects\r\n  case sue Defendant builder, seller and developer under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act if Plaintiffs did not purchase their residences from\r\n  Defendant but from the original homeowner more than three years after the\r\n  original sale?â€Â  Reynolds, 340 S.C. at 333, 531 S.E.2d at 918.Â  The Reynolds court discussed a Texas causation case and acknowledged there was no specific\r\n  provision in UTPA limiting a cause of action to an immediate purchaser.Â  In\r\n  discussing the plaintiffâ€™s request that the Court find privity of contract was\r\n  not required in a UTPA claim by a subsequent purchaser, the Reynoldâ€™s\r\n  court noted that it â€œhas taken a very active role in the construction area to\r\n  protect innocent purchasersâ€ including â€œthe elimination of privity to protect\r\n  an innocent purchaser who has invested his life savings from latent defects in\r\n  a mobile society where it is foreseeable that more than the original owner will\r\n  enjoy a home from a builder.â€Â  Reynolds, 340 S.C. at 334, 531 S.E.2d at\r\n  919.Â  However, the Court answered the certified question in the negative,\r\n  noting that subsequent purchasers had other remedies against the builder in\r\n  tort, negligence, and implied warranties.Â  Reynolds, 340 S.C. at 335,\r\n  531 S.E.2d at 919-20.Â  The dissent in Reynolds pointed out that: Â the\r\n  plain meaning of the UTPA statute did not limit remedies to the initial\r\n  purchaser; requiring privity would contravene South Carolinaâ€™s long policy of\r\n  protecting home owners and prior precedent stating the privity requirement was\r\n  abolished;[10] imposing a privity requirement would bar UTPA suits by competitors; and the\r\n  lack of a privity requirement would not lessen a plaintiffâ€™s need to prove a\r\n  causal connection between the deceptive practices and their injury.Â  Reynolds,\r\n340 S.C. at 336-39, 531 S.E.2d at 920-22 (Burnett, J., dissenting).Â  \r\nIn answering the certified question, the Reynolds Court did not: Â impart any particular legal theory to deny UTPA actions to\r\n  subsequent home buyers; use the word â€œprivityâ€ in its ruling or pronounce that\r\n  all UTPA actions required privity; or offer guidance as to UTPA claims by\r\n  remote purchasers or competing entities generally.Â  Id.Â  Reynolds focused on a subsequent purchaserâ€™s ability or options to prove his losses were\r\n  the result of the original builderâ€™s deceptive trade practice. Â As the dissent\r\n  in Reynolds pointed out, to hold privity is required before a party may\r\n  maintain a UTPA action would lead to an absurd result.Â  Such a finding would\r\n  prohibit UTPA actions by all remote buyers and competitors, who have\r\n  traditionally been allowed to proceed under the Act, because there could be no\r\n  privity.Â  See Global Prot. Corp. v. Halbersberg, 332 S.C. 149,\r\n  156-57, 503 S.E.2d 483, 487 (Ct. App. 1998) (allowing recovery in a UTPA claim\r\n  between competitors for trademark infringement).\r\nAccordingly,\r\nwe answer the second certified question, â€œyes.â€Â  \r\n\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\nMOORE,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE and WALLER, J., concur. PLEICONES, J. concurring in part\r\n  and dissenting in part in a separate opinion in which Acting Justice E. C.\r\nBurnett, III, concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.Â \r\n  I agree with the majority that a mere breach of industry standards does not\r\n  give rise to a tort action, and, further, that the second certified question\r\n  should be answered â€œyes.â€Â  As explained below, I do not join the majorityâ€™s\r\n  ruling which would extend the narrow exception to the economic loss rule\r\n  created in Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber and Mfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.C. 335,\r\n  384 S.E.2d 730 (1989) to all tort-based products liability suits where the\r\n  plaintiff alleges â€œonly the product itself has been injured and [that the]\r\n  productâ€¦posed a serious risk of bodily harm.â€\r\nThree\r\n  theories of liability are available to an individual in South Carolina who has\r\n  suffered a loss as the result of a defective product:Â  breach of warranty,\r\n  which sounds in contract, and strict liability and negligence, both of which\r\n  sound in tort.Â  Only warranty and negligence are discussed here.\r\nA\r\n  negligence products liability claim is premised on a breach of a duty of care\r\n  resulting in damage to person or property, giving rise to a claim for\r\n  restorative money damages. While the law of contracts protects a partyâ€™s\r\n  expectation that a promise will be fulfilled, negligence awards money damages\r\n  to restore a person who has suffered a loss.\r\nThe\r\n  economic loss rule emerged from modern products liability law and serves to\r\n  delineate tort and contract law.Â  See Seely v. White Motor Co.,\r\n  63 Cal.2d 9, 403 P.2d 145 (1965).Â  The rule states that a tort action for a\r\n  defective product does not lie unless there is a claim of personal injury or\r\n  injury to other property of the plaintiff.Â  Where the damage is merely\r\n  diminution in the productâ€™s value, the remedy is in contract for breach of\r\n  warranty, whether the diminished value is the result of inferior quality, unfitness\r\n  for intended use, deterioration or destruction by reason of the defect.Â  As\r\n  Chief Justice Traynor explained in Seely:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries\r\n    and warranty recovery for economic loss is not arbitrary and does not rest on\r\n    the â€˜luckâ€™ of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury.Â  The\r\n    distinction rests, rather, on an understanding of the nature of the\r\n    responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products.Â  He can\r\n    appropriately be held liable for physical injuries caused by defects by\r\n    requiring his goods to match a standard of safety defined in terms of\r\n    conditions that create unreasonable risks of harm.Â  He cannot be held for the\r\n    level of performance of his products in the consumerâ€™s business unless he\r\n    agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumerâ€™s demands.Â  A\r\n    consumer should not be charged at the will of the manufacturer with bearing the\r\n    risk of physical injury when he buys a product on the market. Â He can, however,\r\n    be fairly charged with the risk that the product will not match his economic\r\n    expectations unless the manufacturer agrees that it will.Â  Even in actions for\r\n    negligence, a manufacturerâ€™s liability is limited to damages for physical\r\n    injuries and there is no recovery for economic loss alone.\r\n\r\n63\r\n  Cal.2d at 18, 403 P.2d at 151.\r\nIn Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber and Mfg. Co. Inc., (Kennedy), supra, this Court overruled\r\n  a decision by the Court of Appeals, Carolina Winds Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Joe\r\n    Harden Bldrs., 297 S.C. 74, 374 S.E.2d 897 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  In Kennedy,\r\n  the Court held a cause of action in negligence is available to a new home buyer\r\n  who has suffered only economic loss to the home itself where the builder has\r\n  (1) violated an applicable building code; (2) violated industry standards; or\r\n  (3) constructed housing that he knows or should know will pose serious risks of\r\n  physical harm.Â  The Court characterized its decision as creating a different\r\n  approach to the economic loss rule, holding that a builder should be liable in\r\n  negligence for diminution in value even if only the product is harmed.Â  To\r\n  date, the Court has not expanded this approach to the economic loss rule beyond\r\n  the residential purchaser/builder context.[11]\r\nThe\r\n  present case asks whether the Court will extend the Kennedy exception\r\n  beyond the home buyer/builder sphere.Â  On its facts,[12] this case asks whether the owner (not buyer) of a new commercial (not\r\n  residential) building may sue a material suppler (not builder or seller) in\r\n  negligence where only the material has been injured.[13] \r\nI\r\n  begin by noting that in the residential home cases, the Court has considered\r\n  the â€œproductâ€ to be the new home: heretofore, there has been no suggestion that\r\n  we would entertain a products liability suit by the user against the\r\n  manufacturer of the product components (i.e. the lumber) rather than against\r\n  the manufacturer of the product (i.e. the builder).Â  See Mt. Lebanon\r\n    Personal Care Home, Inc. v. Hoover Universal, Inc., 276 F.3d 845 (6th Cir. 2002) (applying Kentucky law and finding that the wood and fire retardant\r\n  chemicals applied to it would not be a product severable from the building as a\r\n  whole).Â  \r\nSecond,\r\n  the plaintiff here is not a new home buyer or even a new commercial buyer but\r\n  rather a commercial entity which commissioned a new building.Â  None of the\r\n  special policy concerns which underlie the Courtâ€™s jurisprudence extending\r\n  warranties and negligence remedies to new home buyers exist here.Â  Cf. Smith\r\n    v. Breedlove, 377 S.C. 415, 661 S.E.2d 67(2008) (declining to extend\r\n  warranties implied in home sale where seller/builder was not a professional but\r\n  had acted as his own general contractor in constructing family home).\r\nAside\r\n  from the novel policy questions posed by the facts of this case, the actual\r\n  question posed by the district court is much broader:\r\n\r\n  Can the\r\n    user of a defective product recover in tort when only the product itself has\r\n    been injured and when the product either violated generally acceptable industry\r\n    standards or posed a serious risk of bodily injury?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question even\r\n  partly in the affirmative works a wholesale revision of the law of products\r\n  liability, and erases important distinctions between contract (warranty) and\r\n  negligence (tort).Â  \r\n I am not persuaded\r\n  by the majorityâ€™s reasoning that we should effect such a major change in the\r\n  law of products liability.Â  The majority opinion first focuses on what it\r\n  perceives as the similarities between commercial construction and residential\r\n  construction, and next cites three foreign cases to support the extension of\r\n  the Kennedy exception to the economic loss rule to commercial builders.Â \r\n  As explained below, none of the three cases actually support this extension.\r\nTwo of the cases\r\n  cited by the majority for the proposition that the commercial plaintiffs were\r\n  able to recover economic losses in a construction setting are Philadelphia\r\n    Natâ€™l Bank v. Dow Chem. Co., 605 F.Supp. 60 (E.D.PA. 1985) and Trustees\r\n      of Columbia Univ. v. Mitchell/Giurgola Assocs., 492 N.Y.S.2d 371 (N.Y. App.\r\n  Div. 1985).Â  The federal decision in Philadelphia Natâ€™l Bank, applying Pennsylvania law, contains this concession:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    parties agree that under Pennsylvania law no negligence or strict liability may\r\n    be imposed for mere economic loss.\r\n\r\nIn the other case, Trustees\r\n  of Columbia University, the holding was that while the manufacturer\r\n  breached its duty to the user under the doctrine of strict liability, the\r\n  userâ€™s recovery for its losses was barred by the economic loss rule.Â  Id. at 376-377.Â  Both cases in fact apply the economic loss rule to bar a tort\r\n  recovery in a commercial construction setting.\r\nThe\r\n  third case is from Maryland.Â  Maryland, like South Carolina in Kennedy,\r\n  recognizes an exception to the economic loss rule in a residential construction\r\n  case.Â  That jurisdiction held that where the builderâ€™s negligent conduct\r\n  created a clear risk of death or personal injury, an action will lie in\r\n  negligence for recovery of the reasonable cost of correcting the dangerous\r\n  condition.Â  Council of Co-Owners Atlantis Condo., Inc. v. Whiting-Turner\r\n    Contracting, 308 Md. 18, 517 A.2d 336 (1986).Â  In the later Maryland case cited by the majority, the Maryland court did indicate a willingness to\r\n  extend the economic loss exception and recognize a duty where a defective component in a residential building created a risk of death or personal injury.Â  Morris\r\n    v. Osmose Wood Preserving, 340 Md. 519, 667 A.2d 624 (1995).Â  The Morris court clarified the threshold for the application of such an exception:\r\n\r\n  We\r\n    examine both the nature of the damage threatened and the probability of damage\r\n    occurring to determine whether the two, viewed together, exhibit a clear,\r\n    serious, and unreasonable risk of death or personal injury.Â  Thus, if the\r\n    possible injury is extraordinarily severe, i.e., multiple deaths, we do not\r\n    require the probability of the injury occurring to be as high as we would\r\n    require if the injury threatened were less severe, i.e. a broken leg or damage\r\n    to property.Â  Likewise, if the probability of the injury occurring is\r\n    extraordinarily high we do not require the injury to be as severe as we would\r\n    if the probability of injury were lower.[14]\r\n\r\nId. at 533, 667\r\n  A.2d at 631-632.\r\nThe Morris court found, however, that the allegations in that case did not pose a serious\r\n  risk of death and personal injury, and affirmed the dismissal of the\r\n  plaintiffsâ€™ claims.Â  As in the present case, the Morris suit sought to\r\n  recover â€œthe cost of replacing roofs that contained allegedly defective fire\r\n  retardant treated plywood,â€ and the complaint asserted that the roofs had undergone\r\n  a chemical reaction, â€œsignificantly weakening the roof and resulting in\r\n  substantial impairment of the strength and structural integrity of the\r\n  roofsâ€¦.â€Â  The Morris court upheld the dismissal of the complaint,\r\n  finding that the roof work did not meet the threshold requirement of alleging\r\n  â€œthe existence of a clear danger of death or serious personal injury.â€Â  Id.Â  As I read these three cases, none support the extension of Kennedyâ€™s\r\n  exception to the economic loss rule to commercial construction.\r\nAfter\r\n  relying upon the perceived similarities between residential and commercial\r\n  construction, three foreign decisions, and adopting the Maryland courtâ€™s\r\n  balancing test, the majority holds not simply that the Kennedy exception\r\n  will be expanded to include commercial construction, but rather that â€œa user of\r\n  a defective product can recover in tort [even] if only the product has been\r\n  injured if that product poses a serious risk of bodily harm.â€Â  I respectfully\r\n  submit there is simply no analysis to support this unprecedented decision,\r\n  which would rewrite the law of products liability.\r\nIn my opinion, the extension\r\n  of the Kennedy exception to the economic loss rule to commercial\r\n  builders, much less to all manufacturers, is unprecedented, unwarranted, and\r\n  unwise.Â  I am much persuaded by the reasoning of the late Justice-elect Bell who cautioned against permitting negligence actions where there is neither personal\r\n  nor property injury because:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1)\r\n     it is not a tort to create risk,\r\n  only to cause damage;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (2)&nbsp;\r\n    the quantum of damage is\r\n  unknowable until injury occurs; to allow repair damages in negligence may not\r\n  represent the true loss if injury were to occur, and is manifestly speculative;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (3)&nbsp;\r\n    to impose liability without\r\n  damages makes the manufacturer of the product an insurer against all possible\r\n  risk of harm; and\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    there is no principled way to\r\n  categorize types or degrees of risk for the purpose of establishing liability.&nbsp;\r\n  To adopt an ad hoc approach is &ldquo;to abandon the attempt at rule governed\r\n  decision making&hellip; [t]he calculation of risk is a complex, fact intensive,\r\n  infinitely varied, and inevitably imprecise process.&nbsp; It is far beyond the\r\n  competence of judges and juries.&nbsp; Even if all risks could be foreseen and\r\n  precisely calculated, there would still be no certain, predictable standard for\r\n  identifying which risks should be actionable.&nbsp; And there is no guarantee that\r\n  tort rules of liability, if they could be fashioned, would redistribute these\r\n  risks in the most rational, economic way.&rdquo;\r\n  \r\n\r\nCarolina Winds at\r\n  87-88, 374 S.E.2d at 905-906.\r\nÂ For\r\n  the reasons given above, I concur in the decision which answers question one in\r\n  the negative, and which answers the second question in the affirmative.Â  I\r\n  dissent from that part of the opinion which answers question one â€œyes.â€\r\nActing Justice\r\n  E. C. Burnett, III, concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  The facts are substantially taken from the district courtâ€™s February 27, 2007 order certifying the two questions\r\n  to this Court.\r\n[2]Â \r\n  If the repairs to the roof could be completed during the summer, the order held\r\n  the damages award would be reduced to $690,158.62 because the temporary\r\n  expenses could be avoided.Â  \r\n[3]Â \r\n  These legal duties have also been referred to as â€œexceptionsâ€ to the economic\r\n  loss doctrine.Â  \r\n[4]Â \r\n  The question as posited by the district court is interesting in that the record\r\n  reflects that the FRT wood damaged more than itself.Â  It appears to have\r\n  actually damaged metal truss connection plates and the roof sheathing.Â  That\r\n  being the case, the economic loss rule would be inapplicable.Â  Kershaw,\r\n  302 S.C. at 393, 396 S.E.2d at 371.\r\n[5]Â \r\n  The majority rule provides it is the consequence, i.e., the nature of\r\n  the actual loss, that is important in determining whether relief lies in tort.Â  See East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc., 476 U.S.\r\n  858, 869-72 (1986) (rejecting minority economic loss view that manufacturers\r\n  have a duty to make non-defective products and are liable in tort, whether or\r\n  not the defect created an unreasonable risk of harm; rejecting the intermediate\r\n  approach that tort recovery turns on the risk of harm by a defective product;\r\n  and adopting the majority rule that â€œa manufacturer in a commercial\r\n  relationship has no duty under either a negligence or strict products-liability\r\n  theory to prevent a product from injuring itselfâ€ in an admiralty case); Restatement\r\n    (Third) of Torts Â§ 21 cmt. d (1998) (noting that a strong majority of\r\n  courts follow the East River interpretation of the economic loss rule).

App. 1988).Â  However, since\r\n  this Courtâ€™s overruling of Carolina Winds by our decision in Kennedy,\r\n  299 S.C. 335, 384 S.E.2d 730, our focus has been on the legal duties owed and\r\nour concern with the difficulties posed by the economic loss doctrine.\r\n[8]Â \r\n  We respectfully disagree with the dissentâ€™s reading of PNB and Columbia.Â  The risk of physical injury played a role in finding strict liability in\r\n  both cases. While the parties in PNB acknowledged the general rule that\r\n  negligence and strict liability could not be imposed for mere economic losses,\r\n  the court went on to find strict liability where there was some evidence of\r\n  damage to components and the defective construction caused a â€œreal, unspeculated\r\n  risk of harm to passers-by on the street below.â€Â  PNB, 605 F.Supp. at\r\n  64.Â  In Columbia, the installers of a wall that was in danger of\r\n  crumbling on a busy university campus appealed the lower courtâ€™s rulings that\r\n  the supplier could not be held accountable under the doctrines of indemnity and\r\n  contribution.Â  The plaintiff in the case did not appeal a prior courtâ€™s ruling\r\n  that the economic loss doctrine barred its action against supplier.Â  The Columbia  court found that it was not bound by the law of the case in that\r\n  particular procedural posture, and found that the economic loss doctrine would,\r\n  in fact, not bar recovery because the supplier owed a duty to supply safe\r\n  products.Â  While the court found the supplier was not liable for indemnity, it\r\n  held that supplier was liable for contribution because the defective materials\r\n  supplied by supplier damaged the wall and posed an unduly dangerous condition\r\n  for which damages under strict liability may be maintained.Â  Columbia, 492\r\n  N.Y.S.2d at 376.Â  Thus, the court noted that while the plaintiff was unable to\r\n  recover directly against the supplier because it did not appeal the prior\r\n  courtâ€™s findings that supplier had no duties under strict liability, the\r\n  supplier was still liable for contribution because there was actually a duty\r\n  owed.Â  Id. at 377.\r\nIn the instant\r\n  case, the dissentâ€™s reasoning would require that Colleton refrain from taking\r\n  any remedial action and allow the roof to collapse, potentially causing death\r\n  and serious bodily injury. This would be an unnecessary and unacceptable price\r\n  to pay for the protection of the economic loss rule; a rule that is falling out\r\n  of judicial favor in this state and other jurisdictions. As for the dissentâ€™s\r\n  concern for the use of â€œ foreign casesâ€ in our analysis, we are reminded that\r\n  this is a case of first impression in this state. We also note the dissentâ€™s\r\n  use of cases from California and the 6th Circuit in its analysis.\r\n[9] See Matthew W. Gissendanner, Tort Recovery for Defective Products\r\n  Posing a Threat of Bodily Harm:Â  An Exception to the Economic Loss Rule?,\r\n  57 S.C.L.Rev. 619, 621-23 (2006) (predicting whether this Court will extend\r\n  exceptions to the economic loss rule and proposing the damages could be\r\n  calculated as the costs associated with replacing the defective product).\r\n[10]Â  JKT Co., 274 S.C. at 417, 265 S.E.2d at 512 (stating â€œ[w]e do not\r\n  believe the doctrine of privity in South Carolina has sufficient vitality to\r\n  permit its resuscitation by Celotex as a bar to JKTâ€™s recoveryâ€).\r\n[11] Both Beachwalk Villas Condo Assâ€™n Inc. v.

Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDale R. Samuels, of Cumming, Georgia, Pro Se.\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  Respondent and Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel have entered into an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to accept an admonition\r\n  up to a public reprimand.Â  Respondent understands it is within our discretion\r\n  to require him to pay the complainant $1,100.Â  We accept the agreement and\r\n  issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent is further required to make a payment of\r\n  $1,100, plus interest from June 15, 2004, to the complainant. Â The facts, as\r\n  set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nIn\r\n  2003, respondent and his family resided in Florence County, South Carolina.Â \r\n  Respondent planned to take employment in Georgia, and in preparation for\r\n  selling their house in Florence, respondent and his wife, Jennifer Samuels, had\r\n  a two-ton central air-conditioning system installed by Jerryâ€™s Heating, Air\r\n  &amp; Refrigeration, Inc. (â€œJerryâ€™sâ€) on June 24, 2003, for a price of\r\n  $2,600.00.Â  Respondent claimed that after the installation, Mrs. Samuels\r\n  attempted to pay the technician immediately, but was told the company would\r\n  send an invoice.Â  Respondent further stated an invoice was subsequently sent,\r\n  and Mrs. Samuels mailed the payment to Jerryâ€™s.\r\nIn\r\n  the fall of 2003, there was a service problem with the air conditioner, and the\r\n  technician who responded from Jerryâ€™s noticed there was no record of Jerryâ€™s\r\n  receiving payment.Â  Jerryâ€™s claimed it did not receive payment and sent Mrs.\r\n  Samuels a series of letters seeking payment, all addressed to her at the\r\n  residence in Florence.Â  Respondent has not admitted to receiving these\r\n  inquiries.Â  Jerryâ€™s filed suit in the Florence Summary Court seeking payment,\r\n  and the Summons and Complaint were personally served upon Mrs. Samuels on or\r\n  about June 15, 2004, at the residence in Florence.Â  \r\nRespondent filed an Answer and Counterclaim, dated July 12, 2004. Â Although\r\n  respondent was aware at the time the lawsuit was commenced that the check\r\n  mailed to Jerryâ€™s for $2,600 never cleared the bank, respondent never tried to\r\n  stop payment on the first check, issue a second check to Jerryâ€™s, or take other\r\n  remedial action.Â  In the Answer and Counterclaim, respondent asserted lack of\r\n  personal jurisdiction on the basis Mrs. Samuels was a citizen and resident of Georgia.Â  Respondent has acknowledged that while he believed at the time the technical\r\n  jurisdiction claim was valid, he later knew the claim was not supported by the\r\n  facts since at the time the transaction at issue took place, both respondent\r\n  and Mrs. Samuels were living in Florence.\r\nRespondent\r\n  set forth the sequence of events regarding payment as described above in the\r\n  Answer and Counterclaim, but did not disclose that his wifeâ€™s check had never\r\n  cleared the bank.Â  Furthermore, respondent asserted Jerryâ€™s had recklessly\r\n  inflicted severe emotional distress upon Mrs. Samuels.Â  Respondent subsequently\r\n  acknowledged there was no factual basis for this claim other than his\r\n  contention that Jerryâ€™s had made no attempt to resolve the matter before filing\r\n  suit.Â  Respondent had no evidence of Mrs. Samuels seeking medical treatment or\r\n  suffering medical damages as a result of being served with the lawsuit.Â  \r\nIn his Answer and Counterclaim, respondent also contended Mrs.\r\n  Samuels was forced to disclose the existence of the lawsuit to potential\r\n  creditors, resulting in increased interest rate charges on money borrowed.Â \r\n  Thereafter, respondent admitted his wife and he were in the process of\r\n  purchasing a home in Georgia, and the actual mortgage application was made by\r\n  him, and not his wife; he was not required, nor did he report, the existence of\r\n  the lawsuit to any creditor; and there was no increase in interest rate charges\r\n  as a result of the lawsuit.Â  Respondent stated the disclosure of the existence\r\n  of the suit was made to a mortgage broker and not the lender.Â  Respondent\r\n  acknowledged the Unfair Trade Practices claim was without factual basis.Â  \r\nWhen respondent and his wife moved to Georgia, they left a\r\n  forwarding address with the Postal Service.Â  Jerryâ€™s wrote Mrs. Samuels at the\r\n  Florence address on July 22, 2004, referencing the Answer and Counterclaim,\r\n  requesting proof of payment, and asking that she produce a copy of the check\r\n  and mail or fax it to their office.Â  Respondent never produced a canceled check\r\n  for Jerryâ€™s, nor did he inform Jerryâ€™s that his wifeâ€™s check had never cleared\r\n  the bank.\r\nJessie Wall, an employee of Jerryâ€™s who prepared and filed the\r\n  pleadings on behalf of Jerryâ€™s in this matter, and the complainant in this\r\n  action, filed a formal request for production of documents on October 1, 2004,\r\n  and a motion to compel discovery on November 19, 2004, with the Florence County\r\n  Summary Court.Â  Both documents sought proof of payment.Â  \r\nRespondent engaged in three instances of ex parte communication with the Florence County Magistrate assigned to the case, Eugene\r\n  Cooper.Â  The first instance occurred on July 27, 2004, after respondent learned\r\n  Mrs. Samuels was being held in default and a damages hearing had been\r\n  scheduled.Â  Respondent telephoned the Florence Summary Court and discussed with\r\n  Judge Cooper his intent to file a motion to be relieved from default, and how\r\n  his Answer and Counterclaim had not been received in a timely manner.\r\nOn\r\n  a second occasion, on May 10, 2005, respondent telephoned the Florence Summary Court to discuss his lack of notice for the jury trial that was scheduled\r\n  for that day.Â  His call was transferred to Judge Cooper, who suggested to\r\n  respondent that he contact Wall and explore possible settlement.Â  Respondent\r\n  telephoned Wall, disclosed to her he had spoken to Judge Cooper, and discussed\r\n  possible settlement.Â  The conversation broke down, with both parties making\r\n  accusations.Â  Respondent acknowledged that while Wall was not bound by any\r\n  rules regarding courtesy and demeanor, he certainly was.\r\nThe\r\n  third ex parte communication occurred shortly thereafter when\r\n  respondent called Judge Cooper and reported to him that settlement discussions\r\n  had been unsuccessful.Â  Respondent discussed with Judge Cooper the removal of\r\n  the matter from his docket because the amount in controversy would likely\r\n  exceed the jurisdictional limit of the Summary Court.Â  Subsequently, respondent\r\n  faxed a First Amended Answer and Counterclaim to Judge Cooper, with a copy to\r\n  Jerryâ€™s.Â  Respondentâ€™s cover letter disclosed he had spoken to Judge Cooper,\r\n  and the counterclaims contained in the document sought damages of not less than\r\n  $7,500.Â  The case was transferred to the Court of Common Pleas.\r\nIn\r\n  the First Amended Answer and Counterclaim, respondent again raised the same\r\n  issues involving jurisdiction, the method of payment to Jerryâ€™s, and the\r\n  counterclaims for violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act,\r\n  intentional infliction of emotional distress and outrage, defamation, and abuse\r\n  of process.Â  Respondent did not assert that his wifeâ€™s check had not cleared.Â \r\n  As with the initial Answer and Counterclaim, respondent later acknowledged\r\n  there was no valid contention regarding jurisdiction; there was no factual\r\n  basis for violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act; and there was no factual\r\n  basis for the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress upon Mrs.\r\n  Samuels.\r\nAfter\r\n  the matter was transferred to the Court of Common Pleas, Jerryâ€™s retained\r\n  counsel.Â  The matter was subsequently resolved by a Consent Order transferring\r\n  the case back to Summary Court, payment of $1,500 by respondent to Jerryâ€™s, and\r\n  the execution of a Consent Order of Dismissal with prejudice, dated July 16,\r\n2007.Â  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  response to Wallâ€™s complaint to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, respondent\r\n  described the installation of the central air-conditioning system and the\r\n  subsequent payment.Â  At no point did respondent disclose his wifeâ€™s check had\r\n  never cleared the bank.Â  Also, respondent acknowledged Wallâ€™s attempt to serve\r\n  what respondent characterized as formal correspondence seeking proof of\r\n  payment.Â  In his response to the Commissionâ€™s notice of full investigation,\r\n  respondent acknowledged for the first time the check for payment had never\r\n  cleared his bank.Â  As a result of all of these actions, respondent received an\r\n  air-conditioning system priced $2,600 for $1,500 and has not fully paid Jerryâ€™s\r\n  for the appliance.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a\r\n  client); Rule 3.1 (a lawyer\r\n  shall assert only meritorious claims and contentions); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall\r\n  make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation); Rule 3.3 (a lawyer shall\r\n  demonstrate candor toward the tribunal); Rule 3.4(a) (a lawyer shall not\r\n  unlawfully obstruct another partyâ€™s access to evidence); Rule 3.4(d) (a lawyer\r\n  shall make a reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper\r\n  discovery request); Rule 4.1(a) (a lawyer shall not make false statements of\r\n  material fact); and Rule 8.4(a) (professional misconduct).\r\nRespondentâ€™s\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1), 7(a)(5), and\r\n  7(a)(6) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR (it\r\n  shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe\r\n  find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement\r\n  for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his actions.Â \r\n  We further order respondent to make a payment of $1,100, plus interest from June\r\n  15, 2004, to complainant Jerryâ€™s.\r\nPUBLIC\r\n  REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;
