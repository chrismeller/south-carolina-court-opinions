Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph P. Turner,\r\n  Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tM. Gregory McCollum, of Myrtle Beach; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct filed formal charges against\r\n  Respondent with regard to four matters.Â  After a hearing, the Hearing Panel\r\n  recommended Respondent be sanctioned to a one-year definite suspension from the\r\n  practice of law, retroactive to his August 6, 2003 interim suspension, with certain\r\n  conditions.Â  We adopt the recommendation, and we sanction Respondent to a\r\n  one-year definite suspension, retroactive to the date of his interim\r\n  suspension, with the following conditions:Â  entering a two-year monitoring\r\n  contract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers and agree to random drug screens during\r\n  the period; making full restitution to the Lawyers Fund for Client Protection\r\n  in the amount of $21,148.30 prior to being eligible to apply for readmission;\r\n  and payment of $683.23 for the costs of the proceedings.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel alleged Respondent committed\r\n  misconduct with regard to four matters.\r\nMatter I\r\nOn June\r\n  19, 2003, Respondent appeared before Judge Baxley in the Court of Common Pleas\r\n  in a civil matter in response to a Rule to Show Cause and as part of his\r\n  representation of Client A.Â  The purpose of the Rule to Show Cause was to\r\n  determine:Â  (1) whether Respondent had violated a previous court order\r\n  compelling discovery responses; and (2) whether he had violated a previous\r\n  order to pay opposing counsel $350 for attorneys fees incurred in bringing the\r\n  motion to compel discovery.Â  The court found Respondent in contempt with regard\r\n  to the civil matter, ordered additional monies to be paid to opposing counsel,\r\n  and imposed sanctions with regard to the pending civil litigation to the\r\n  prejudice of Client A.Â  Later, Respondentâ€™s check for $700 to opposing counsel\r\n  to pay the court-ordered attorneyâ€™s fees was returned by the bank for\r\n  â€œnon-sufficient funds.â€Â  When the civil case came before the master-in-equity\r\n  for a bench trial on July 15, 2003, neither Respondent nor Client A appeared\r\n  for trial, and judgment was entered against Client A in his absence based\r\n  solely on the uncontradicted testimony of the opposing party.Â  Respondent did\r\n  not inform Client A of the trial date. \r\nFurther,\r\n  while before Judge Baxley at the June 19, 2003 Rule to Show Cause hearing, it\r\n  appeared that Respondent was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.Â  Upon\r\n  inquiry by the court, Respondent denied being under the influence of any\r\n  substance and denied having used any alcohol or drugs in the past seventy-two\r\n  hours.Â  The court then required Respondent to submit to an immediate urinalysis\r\n  drug screening.Â  The screening indicated the presence of cocaine in\r\n  Respondentâ€™s system.Â  Upon learning of the results, Respondent admitted to the\r\n  court that he had used cocaine within the previous seventy-two hours but denied\r\n  being â€œunder the influence.â€Â  The court found Respondent in direct criminal\r\n  contempt for lying to the court about his use of cocaine and imposed a contempt\r\n  sanction by sentencing Respondent to ninety days in the Horry County Detention  Center to begin no later than June 25, 2003.Â  However, the court allowed\r\n  Respondent to avoid jail by enrolling in a drug treatment program with certain\r\n  conditions.Â  The court found Respondentâ€™s conduct was having a detrimental\r\n  effect on his clients, which the court believed to be the result of â€œa\r\n  substance abuse problem that is destroying his life and legal practice and is\r\n  certainly interfering with the administration of justiceâ€ and is â€œnot isolated\r\n  to this judge or this court.â€Â  Respondent initially entered a drug treatment\r\n  program, but because he was unable to pay for the program, he failed to\r\n  complete it.Â  Respondent carried out his ninety-day sentence at the Horry County  Detention Center.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent\r\n  hired a court reporter for a July 9, 2002 deposition.Â  On July 22, 2002, the\r\n  court reporter forwarded to Respondent a copy of the deposition transcript\r\n  along with a bill.Â  Respondent failed to pay the court reporterâ€™s bill or\r\n  otherwise communicate with her in response to the July 22 bill.Â  The court\r\n  reporter notified Respondent of his outstanding debt to her by letters dated\r\n  November 12, 2002; December 18, 2002; and January 7, 2003.Â  Respondent did not\r\n  respond to any of the letters and only paid the bill after receiving a Notice\r\n  of Full Investigation of this matter from ODC in August 2003.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  was notified of the court reporterâ€™s Complaint by letter from ODC dated\r\n  February 20, 2003, requesting a response within fifteen days.Â  Respondent\r\n  failed to respond or otherwise communicate with ODC.Â  After ODC sent him a\r\n  letter on March 11, 2003, reminding him of his duty to respond pursuant to In\r\n    the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), Respondent\r\n  contacted ODC by telephone on March 26, 2003, indicating that he would send a\r\n  response to the court reporterâ€™s Complaint by facsimile the next day.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to send a response until April 14, 2003.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nIn May\r\n  2002, Respondent was retained by Client B to represent her in a divorce\r\n  action.Â  Client B paid Respondent $1,650 in cash and office cleaning services\r\n  that Respondent agreed were worth $350.Â  Respondent failed to file a complaint\r\n  on behalf of Client B in the proper county and later failed to pursue a\r\n  transfer of her case from the wrong county.Â  Over the next year, Respondent\r\n  canceled and failed to attend several meetings with Client B regarding her\r\n  divorce, deliberately avoided many of her attempts to communicate with him in\r\n  writing and by telephone, and misled Client B about whether her complaint for\r\n  divorce was pending in Family Court in the proper county and about the\r\n  existence of a scheduled hearing before the Family Court.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  was notified of the Client B complaint by a letter from ODC dated May 19, 2003,\r\n  requesting a response within fifteen days.Â  Respondent failed to respond or\r\n  otherwise communicate with ODC.Â  On June 6, 2003, ODC sent Respondent a letter\r\n  informing him of his obligation to respond pursuant to In the Matter of\r\n    Treacy and again requesting a response.Â  On June 24, 2003, Respondent\r\n  telephoned ODC in response to an inquiry regarding Matter II, and he informed\r\n  ODC that he was not calling to respond to the Client B matter, but that he\r\n  intended to do so.Â  However, Respondent failed to respond or otherwise\r\n  communicate with ODC regarding the Client B matter in any way until after\r\n  receiving a Notice of Full Investigation in September 2003. \r\nMatter IV\r\nOn\r\n  January 7, 2003, Respondentâ€™s former client, Client C, initiated a formal\r\n  dispute of Respondentâ€™s fee by filing an Application for Resolution of Disputed\r\n  Fee with the South Carolina Bar Resolution of Fee Disputes Board (FDB).Â  A\r\n  panel member of the FDB investigated the fee dispute, and on May 7, 2003,\r\n  reported his findings and recommended that Respondent pay $750 to Client C\r\n  within thirty days.Â  On May 8, 2003, the FDB Circuit Chair issued Respondent a\r\n  letter adopting the recommendation of the panel member as the final decision of\r\n  the FDB.Â  Respondent failed to repay Client C within thirty days and did not\r\n  refund any portion of the $750 until after receiving a Notice of Full\r\n  Investigation of this matter from ODC in October 2003.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  was placed on interim suspension on August 6, 2003.Â  At the May 1, 2007 hearing\r\n  before the Hearing Panel, Respondent testified that he began using cocaine in\r\n  2001 to deal with depression stemming from the breakup of his marriage.Â  He\r\n  testified that he voluntarily started having drug tests and has passed over one\r\n  hundred drug tests since he discontinued using cocaine in late 2003.Â  He stated\r\n  he attends both N.A. and A.A. meetings and intends to do so for the foreseeable\r\n  future.Â  Respondent submitted several affidavits, and several witnesses\r\n  testified at the hearing, that respondent is an excellent attorney and they\r\n  would have every confidence in him should he be admitted back to the practice\r\n  of law.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the hearing, the Hearing Panel issued a report and recommendation.Â  As to\r\n  Matter I, the Hearing Panel found that by his actions, Respondent:Â  (1) failed\r\n  to provide the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably\r\n  necessary for the representation of Client A, in violation of Rule 1.1, Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR; (2) failed to act with\r\n  reasonable diligence and promptness on behalf of Client A, in violation of Rule\r\n  1.3; (3) failed to keep Client A reasonably informed about the status of\r\n  litigation in violation of Rule 1.4; (4) failed to expedite litigation\r\n  consistent with the interests of Client A, in violation of Rule 3.2; (5) made a\r\n  false statement of material fact to the circuit court, in violation of Rules\r\n  3.3, 4.1, 8.4(a), 8.4(d), and 8.4(e); and (6) committed the criminal acts of\r\n  possessing and using a controlled substance, in violation of Rules 8.4(b) and\r\n  8.4(c).Â  The Hearing Panel found Respondentâ€™s conduct was grounds for\r\n  discipline under Rules 7(a)(1)(violating the Rules of Professional Conduct),\r\n  7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to bring the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute), 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office), and 7(a)(7) (willfully\r\n  violating a court order), RLDE.Â  \r\nRegarding Matter II, the Hearing Panel found Respondent:Â  failed\r\n  to timely pay a court-related expense in violation of Rule 8.4(e); and failed\r\n  to respond to demands for information from ODC in violation of Rule 8.1.Â  The\r\n  Hearing Panel determined the conduct was grounds for discipline under Rules\r\n  7(a)(1), and 7(a)(3) (willfully violating a valid order of the Commission),\r\n  RLDE.\r\nAs to Matter III, the Hearing Panel determined that Respondent:Â \r\n  (1) failed to provide competent representation to Client BÂ  in violation of\r\n  Rule 1.1; (2) failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing\r\n  Client B, in violation of Rule 1.3; (3) failed to keep Client B reasonably\r\n  informed about the status of her divorce and failed to promptly comply with\r\n  reasonable requests for information in violation of Rule 1.4; (4) charged\r\n  Client B a fee that was not reasonable in light of the time and labor\r\n  Respondent provided, the results obtained, and other relevant considerations,\r\n  in violation of Rule 1.5; (5) failed to expedite Client Bâ€™s divorce consistent\r\n  with her interests in violation of Rule 3.2; and (6) failed to respond to ODCâ€™s\r\n  demands for information in violation of Rule 8.1.Â  The Hearing Panel found\r\n  Respondentâ€™s conduct was grounds for discipline under Rules 7(a)(1), 7(a)(3),\r\n  7(a)(5), and 7(a)(6), RLDE.Â  \r\nFinally, with regard to Matter IV, the Hearing Panel determined\r\n  Respondent failed to comply with the FDBâ€™s final decision in violation of Rule\r\n  8.4(e), and that his conduct was grounds for discipline under Rules 7(a)(1),\r\n  7(a)(5), and 7(a)(10), RLDE (willfully failing to comply with a final decision\r\n  of the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board).Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nNeither\r\n  Respondent nor ODC raise any exceptions to the Hearing Panelâ€™s report and\r\n  recommendation.Â  Thus, it is up to this Court to determine whether the\r\n  recommended sanction is appropriate. \r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which\r\n  discipline is given rests entirely with this Court.Â  In re Long, 346\r\n  S.C. 110, 551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).Â  The Court is not bound by the panelâ€™s\r\n  recommendation and may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  In\r\n    re Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).Â  After a thorough review of\r\n  the record, the Court must impose the sanction it deems appropriate.Â  In re\r\n    Strickland, 354 S.C. 169, 580 S.E.2d 126 (2003).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Hearing Panel that Respondentâ€™s actions violated the\r\n  above-listed rules.Â  We find the recommended sanction of a retroactive, one-year\r\n  definite suspension, with the recommended conditions, is appropriate.Â  See In re Newton, 361 S.C. 404, 605 S.E.2d 538 (2004) (sanctioning a former\r\n  assistant solicitor to a one-year suspension, retroactive, where charged with\r\n  possession with intent to distribute marijuana, reduced to possession, and\r\n  completion of pre-trial intervention); In re Smith, 347 S.C. 437, 556\r\n  S.E.2d 388 (2001) (sanctioning to a six-month retroactive suspension where\r\n  charges for trafficking in cocaine, methamphetamines, and possession of\r\n  marijuana were dismissed but attorney admitted cocaine use); In re Tribert,\r\n  343 S.C. 326, 540 S.E.2d 467 (2000) (sanctioning attorney to a one-year\r\n  suspension, retroactive, where the attorney pled guilty to driving under the\r\n  influence and where a charge of possession of cocaine was dismissed upon\r\n  completion of a pre-trial intervention program); see also In\r\n    re Newton, 366 S.C. 276, 621 S.E.2d 657 (2005) (adding a two-year\r\n  monitoring contract with LHL and the taking of the new attorney oath as a\r\n  condition of Newtonâ€™s reinstatement). Â \r\nWithin fifteen days of this opinion, Respondent shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice E.

Hubbell, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â Â Â Â  In\r\n  this case, the State appeals from the trial courtâ€™s order granting Respondent\r\n  Jack Sterlingâ€™s motion to exclude the testimony of four of the Stateâ€™s\r\n  witnesses.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn\r\n  June 2003, following the financial collapse of Carolina Investors, Inc. (â€œCIâ€)\r\n  and HomeGold Financial, Inc. (â€œHGFâ€), the grand jury initiated an investigation\r\n  into the collapse.Â  Subsequently, after SLED requested an interview with\r\n  Respondent,[1] Respondent contacted attorney Bill Bannister for legal advice.Â  On July 30,\r\n  2003, Bannister accompanied Respondent to the SLED interview.Â  During this same\r\n  time period, SLED also conducted interviews of several other officers of CI and\r\n  HGF, including Larry Owen, Anne Owen, Don Bobo, and Danny Sharpe, all of whom\r\n  Bannister represented.Â  On January 19, 2004, Respondent sent a letter to\r\n  Bannister terminating his services.\r\nOn\r\n  April 12, 2006, more than two years after firing Bannister, the grand jury\r\n  indicted Respondent on two counts of securities fraud and one count of\r\n  conspiracy.Â  Respondent filed a motion to quash the indictment or, in the\r\n  alternative, exclude the testimonies of Larry Owen, Anne Owen, Don Bobo, and\r\n  Danny Sharpe (hereinafter â€œthe witnessesâ€) based on Bannisterâ€™s purported conflict\r\n  of interest after having represented all parties at the time of their SLED\r\n  interviews.Â  The trial court declined to quash the indictment, finding such a\r\n  drastic remedy was inappropriate absent prosecutorial misconduct.Â  However, the\r\n  trial court found that Bannisterâ€™s past representation of Respondent and the\r\n  witnesses violated Respondentâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to counsel in that it created\r\n  an actual conflict of interest.Â  Therefore, the trial court granted\r\n  Respondentâ€™s motion to exclude the witnessesâ€™ testimonies.Â  \r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s preliminary factual\r\n  findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases\r\n  unless the findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Wilson, 345\r\n  S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAs a primary\r\n  matter, Respondent argues that this order is not immediately appealable.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThis\r\n  Court has interpreted the appealability statute, S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976), to allow the immediate appeal of pre-trial orders\r\n  which would significantly impair the prosecution of a criminal case. Â The\r\n  witnesses to which the trial courtâ€™s order pertained personally interacted with\r\n  Respondent during the relevant time period and will be able to provide a\r\n  first-hand account of what Respondent knew and his actions.Â  Thus, their\r\n  testimonies are critical to prove the charges against Respondent, and the\r\n  suppression of their testimonies would significantly impair the Stateâ€™s case.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold that the trial courtâ€™s order is immediately appealable.Â  See State v.\r\n    McKnight, 287 S.C. 167, 168, 337 S.E.2d\r\n  208, 209 (1985) (holding that a pre-trial order granting the suppression of\r\n  evidence which significantly impairs the prosecution of a criminal case is\r\n  directly appealable under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2)(a) (1976)).Â  \r\nTurning\r\n  to the merits of the appeal, the State argues that the trial court erred in\r\n  excluding the testimonies because Respondent suffered no Sixth Amendment\r\n  violation and because no actual conflict of interest existed.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches upon\r\n  initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings and at all critical stages of a\r\n  criminal trial. Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625, 629 (1986). Â In order to prove a per se Sixth Amendment violation, the defendant\r\n  must show that counsel acted under an actual conflict of interest.Â  Stated\r\n  differently, â€œprejudice is presumed only if the defendant\r\n  demonstrates that counsel â€˜actively represented conflicting interestsâ€™ and that\r\n  â€˜an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyerâ€™s performance.â€™â€Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466\r\n  U.S. 668, 692 (1984) (quoting Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 350 (1980)).\r\nIn\r\n  our view, the trial court erred in presuming Respondentâ€™s rights were\r\n  prejudiced.Â  Significantly, Respondentâ€™s Sixth Amendment right had not attached\r\n  at any point during Bannisterâ€™s representation, as Respondent had not yet been\r\n  indicted.Â  See State v. Council, 335\r\n  S.C. 1, 15, 515 S.E.2d 508, 515 (1999) (noting that the\r\n  Sixth Amendment right attaches only post-indictment, at least in the\r\n  questioning/statement setting).Â  At the time that Bannister represented\r\n  Respondent, the State had not initiated any criminal proceedings against\r\n  Respondent, and Respondent had not been indicted.Â  In fact, Respondent fired\r\n  Bannister more than two years before he was indicted.Â  This Court has never\r\n  found per se Sixth Amendment violations during the pre-indictment stage, and\r\n  Respondent cites no authority to the contrary.Â  See State v. Gregory, 364 S.C. 150, 612 S.E.2d 449 (2005)\r\n  (finding a per se Sixth Amendment violation where attorney acted under an\r\n  actual conflict of interest at trial); Thomas v.\r\n    State, 346 S.C. 140, 551 S.E.2d 254 (2001)\r\n  (finding a per se Sixth Amendment violation where attorney acted under an\r\n  actual conflict of interest at the plea hearing).Â  To the extent an attorney is\r\n  acting under a conflict of interest in the pre-indictment stage, we think that\r\n  the actual conflict of interest must persist into the post-indictment stage\r\n  before a court will presume prejudice.Â  See United States v. Tatum, 943\r\n  F.2d 370, 380 (4th Cir. 1991) (presuming prejudice where\r\n  actual conflict adversely affected pretrial strategies as well as\r\n  the defense at trial); Hoffman v. Leeke, 903\r\n  F.2d 280, 290 (4th Cir. 1990) (holding defendant suffered a Sixth Amendment\r\n  violation where counsel acted under a conflict of interest from the\r\n  pre-indictment stage until the conclusion of defendantâ€™s trial). Â \r\nNot\r\n  only did the representation terminate pre-indictment, but also Respondent\r\n  failed to show Bannister operated under any actual conflict of interest. Â Bannister\r\n  represented Respondent and the witnesses in the preliminary stages of the\r\n  investigation before any criminal proceedings began.Â  Thus, at that time, the\r\n  witnessesâ€™ interests were not necessarily adverse to Respondentâ€™s interests.Â Â  See Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 175 (2002) (recognizing that until\r\n  a defendant shows that counsel actively represented conflicting\r\n  interests, he has not established the constitutional predicate for his claim of\r\n  a Sixth Amendment violation); Fuller v. State, 347 S.C. 630, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  664 (2001) (holding an actual conflict of interest occurs where an attorney\r\n  owes a duty to a party whose interests are adverse to the defendantâ€™s interests).\r\n  Â Given that Respondent failed to show that Bannister operated under an actual\r\n  conflict of interest after criminal proceedings had begun, it is\r\n  inappropriate to presume prejudice in this case.Â  \r\nIf we were to hold that a pre-indictment conflict could pose a\r\n  Sixth Amendment violation, we think Respondent must be able to demonstrate some\r\n  way in which Bannisterâ€™s representation prejudiced his rights,[2] which he cannot do.Â  Bannister stated in his affidavit that Respondent\r\n  never conveyed confidential information to him, and Respondent\r\n  does not point to any evidence that Bannister disclosed privileged information\r\n  to the witnesses.Â  Furthermore, the record contains no evidence of\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct.Â  We note that Respondent is\r\n  not without protections during trial.Â  For example, should it appear that the\r\n  witnesses will disclose privileged information during their testimonies, the\r\n  trial court is free to hold a hearing in camera to determine the\r\n  admissibility of such testimony and to craft protective orders or instructions\r\n  where necessary.Â  \r\nAs a practical matter, the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s remedy of excluding witness testimony based on a Sixth Amendment\r\n  violation is somewhat puzzling.Â  Typically, in cases involving a violation of\r\n  the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, the defendant has suffered a violation of\r\n  his right to counsel during the adjudication proceeding (i.e., a trial or a\r\n  plea hearing), and the remedy granted as a result of the constitutional\r\n  violation is a new trial.Â  See Staggs v. State, 372 S.C. 549, 551,\r\n  643 S.E.2d 690, 692 (2007) (ordering a new trial where attorney simultaneously\r\n  represented a defendant and the defendantâ€™s father, mother, and brother, all of\r\n  whom were charged as accessories after the fact).Â  In the instant\r\n  case, however, the trial court applied a broad remedy that effectively operated\r\n  as an expansive version of the exclusionary rule, a remedy typically applied to\r\n  Fourth Amendment violations.Â  See State\r\n    v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 131, 620 S.E.2d 737, 740 (2005) (recognizing\r\n  that the exclusionary rule operates as a mechanism to enforce the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable\r\n  searches and seizures).Â  For such a rule to be the appropriate remedy in this\r\n  case, we think several additional circumstances would need to be present, such\r\n  as the former attorney intentionally conveying privileged information to other\r\n  witnesses or to the State or some form of prosecutorial misconduct.Â  While this\r\n  conduct may implicate any number of constitutional rights, we are unaware of\r\n  any jurisprudence analyzing such violations under the Sixth Amendment rubric.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that Respondent suffered no Sixth Amendment\r\n  violation of his right to counsel and that Respondent failed to show he was otherwise\r\n  prejudiced by Bannisterâ€™s representation.Â  Therefore, we further hold that the\r\n  trial court erred as a matter of law in granting Respondentâ€™s motion to exclude\r\n  the witnessesâ€™ testimonies.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s order excluding the witnessesâ€™\r\n  testimonies.\r\n\r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice E.

McFarland, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  In this case, the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services (the Department)\r\n  appeals the circuit courtâ€™s reversal of the Administrative Law Courtâ€™s (ALC)\r\n  order.Â  In its order, the ALC dismissed Kamathene Cooperâ€™s appeal from the\r\n  denial of his request for parole on the ground that it lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to review the appeal.Â  We granted the Court of Appealsâ€™ motion for\r\n  the appeal to be certified directly to this Court.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn November 30, 1984, Cooper stabbed Rheupart Stewart\r\n  with a knife and then beat him with a chair.Â  Stewart died as a result of his\r\n  injuries.Â  Before leaving Stewartâ€™s residence, Cooper took Stewartâ€™s\r\n  checkbook.Â  That same day, Cooper forged Stewartâ€™s signature on one of the\r\n  checks and used it to make a purchase at a local department store.Â  \r\nAs a result of this\r\n  incident, Cooper was arrested and a Florence County grand jury indicted him for\r\n  murder, armed robbery, and forgery.Â  Subsequently, a jury convicted Cooper of\r\n  murder and forgery, but acquitted him of armed robbery.Â  Cooper was sentenced to\r\n  death.Â  This Court reversed Cooperâ€™s conviction and remanded for a new trial.Â  State\r\n    v. Cooper, 291 S.C. 332, 353 S.E.2d 441 (1986), overruled on other\r\n      grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  Following\r\n  this reversal, Cooper was convicted of murder and sentenced to incarceration\r\n  for the remainder of his natural life and a consecutive seven-year term for\r\n  forgery. Â \r\nAt\r\n  the time of his conviction, South Carolina law permitted an inmate who was\r\n  serving a life sentence to appear before the Parole Board upon the service of\r\n  twenty years. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (1985).Â  On May 23, 2000, Cooper made\r\n  his initial appearance before the Parole Board.Â  On five more occasions, Cooper\r\n  appeared before the Parole Board.Â  Each time, the Parole Board rejected\r\n  Cooperâ€™s request. Â On the last occasion, the Parole Board rejected Cooperâ€™s\r\n  parole for the following reasons:Â  (1) the nature and seriousness of the\r\n  current offense; (2) an indication of violence in this or a previous offense;\r\n  and (3) the use of a deadly weapon in this or a previous offense. \r\nFollowing the\r\n  rejection of his parole and the denial of his motion for reconsideration,\r\n  Cooper filed an appeal with the Administrative Law Court (ALC).Â  In his appeal,\r\n  Cooper â€œchallenged the denial of parole by [the Parole Board] and asserted that\r\n  the [Board] denied him a realistic opportunity to participate in the South\r\n  Carolina Parole program and that such action by [the Board] was arbitrary,\r\n  capricious, and in violation of the United States Constitution Article 14\r\n  Section I and South Carolina Constitution Article XII Section 2 and State\r\n  statutes.â€Â  \r\nChief\r\n  Administrative Law Judge Marvin F. Kittrell, dismissed Cooperâ€™s appeal on the\r\n  ground the ALC did not have jurisdiction to review an appeal from the denial of\r\n  parole.Â  Judge Kittrell found that Cooperâ€™s appeal did â€œnot involve a\r\n  determination by the Department that he is permanently ineligible for parole.Â \r\n  Instead, Appellant is challenging the Boardâ€™s decision not to grant him parole\r\n  at his regularly scheduled parole hearing.â€Â  In reaching this conclusion, Judge\r\n  Kittrell primarily relied on this Courtâ€™s decisions in Al-Shabazz v. State,\r\n  338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000), Furtick v. S.C. Department of\r\n    Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, 352 S.C. 594, 576 S.E.2d 146 (2003),\r\n  and Sullivan v. S.C. Department of Corrections, 355 S.C. 437, 586 S.E.2d\r\n  124 (2003).Â  Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nCooper\r\n  appealed Judge Kittrellâ€™s order to the circuit court.Â  The parties appeared\r\n  before Circuit Court Judge James C. Williams, Jr.Â  Judge Williams issued an\r\n  order in which he reversed Judge Kittrellâ€™s order and remanded the matter to\r\n  the ALC to take testimony and render a decision.Â  In reaching this decision,\r\n  Judge Williams found the ALC had jurisdiction to review the Parole Boardâ€™s\r\n  final decision denying Cooperâ€™s parole because the Parole Board:Â  (1) failed to\r\n  apply the criteria for parole as required by the state parole statutes,\r\n  specifically section 24-21-640, in violation of Cooperâ€™s liberty interest; (2)\r\n  willfully denied Cooper the realistic opportunity to participate in the parole\r\n  program in violation of his constitutional rights; and (3) violated the ex post\r\n  facto clause of the South Carolina Constitution in denying Cooper the realistic\r\n  opportunity to participate in the South Carolina parole program. Â Judge\r\n  Williams denied the Departmentâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  Subsequently, the\r\n  Department appealed Judge Williamsâ€™ order to the Court of Appeals.Â  This Court\r\n  granted the Court of Appealsâ€™ motion to certify the appeal.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nThe Department asserts the ALC properly dismissed\r\n  Cooperâ€™s administrative appeal for lack of jurisdiction.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  Department contends the denial of Cooperâ€™s request for parole did not\r\n  constitute a protected liberty interest which required judicial review.Â \r\n  Because the Parole Boardâ€™s decision did not render Cooper ineligible for\r\n  parole, the Department claims the ALC was without jurisdiction to review the\r\n  appeal.[1]Â  \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, Cooper argues that he is not challenging the denial of parole, but\r\n  rather, the procedure employed by the Parole Board in denying his request.Â  He believes\r\n  the Parole Board effectively rendered him ineligible for parole when it issued\r\n  its decision based on three â€œimmutableâ€ or fixed criteria.Â  Because the Parole\r\n  Board did not consider all relevant factors[2] in making its decision, Cooper contends the Parole Board acted arbitrarily and\r\n  capriciously and deprived him of a state-created liberty interest under section\r\n  24-21-640 of the South Carolina Code, which outlines criteria to be considered\r\n  by the Parole Board.[3]\r\nGiven\r\n  that neither party disputes the applicable law, this case essentially involves\r\n  a determination of whether the Parole Boardâ€™s decision amounted to a routine\r\n  denial of parole or effectively rendered Cooper parole ineligible.Â  If the\r\n  former, then the ALC was without jurisdiction to review Cooperâ€™s appeal.Â \r\n  Conversely, if Cooper was rendered ineligible for parole due to the procedure\r\n  employed by the Parole Board, then he was deprived of a state-created liberty\r\n  interest which triggered the due process requirements of judicial review. \r\nParole is a privilege, not a right.Â  Sullivan\r\n  v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 355 S.C. 437, 443 n.4, 586 S.E.2d 124, 127 n.4\r\n  (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1153 (2004).Â  A courtâ€™s final judgment in\r\n  a criminal case is the pronouncement of the sentence.Â  The parole board,\r\n  however, has the sole authority to determine parole eligibility separate and\r\n  apart from the courtâ€™s authority to sentence a defendant.Â  State v. McKay,\r\n  300 S.C. 113, 115, 386 S.E.2d 623, 623-24 (1989).Â  \r\nThis Court has the authority to interpret the parole statute.Â  In\r\n  interpreting statutes, we look to the plain meaning of the statute and the\r\n  intent of the Legislature.Â  Hinton v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Prob., Parole, &amp;\r\n    Pardon Servs., 357 S.C. 327, 332, 592 S.E.2d 335, 338 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Because\r\n  the statute is penal in nature, the Court must construe it strictly in favor of\r\n  the defendant and against the State.Â  See Hair v State, 305 S.C.\r\n  77, 79, 406 S.E.2d 332, 334 (1991) (construing in favor of the defendant the\r\n  different time frames for parole eligibility found in the general parole\r\n  statute and in a statute regarding parole eligibility for burglary).\r\nIn the\r\n  key case involving the jurisdiction of the ALC regarding review of inmate\r\n  matters, this Court in Al-Shabazz v. State held:\r\n\r\n\tan inmate may seek review of [the] Departmentâ€™s final decision in\r\n  an administrative matter under the APA.Â  Placing review of these cases within\r\n  the ambit of the APA will ensure that an inmate receives due process, which\r\n  consists of notice, a hearing, and judicial review.\r\n\r\nAl-Shabazz v.\r\n  State, 338 S.C. 354, 369,\r\n  527 S.E.2d 742, 750 (2000).Â  The Court emphasized that its decision was not\r\n  without limitation.Â  Significantly, the Court noted that the requirements of\r\n  procedural due process would be applicable when an inmate was deprived of a\r\n  protected liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment in order to ensure\r\n  that a â€œstate-created right was not arbitrarily abrogated.â€Â  Id. at 370,\r\n  527 S.E.2d at 750 (citing Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974)).\r\nIn cases\r\n  post-dating Al-Shabazz, this Court has discussed in specific terms the\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction of the ALJD, stating â€œthe ALJD has subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to hear appeals from the final decision of [the Department] in a\r\n  non-collateral or administrative matter.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction refers to\r\n  the ALJDâ€™s â€˜power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the\r\n  proceedings in question belong.â€™â€ Slezak v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 361\r\n  S.C. 327, 331, 605 S.E.2d 506, 507 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 1033 (2005) (quoting Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 238, 442 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  600 (1994)).Â  Further, â€œthe ALC has subject matter jurisdiction over an\r\n  inmateâ€™s appeal when the claim sufficiently â€˜implicates a state-created liberty\r\n  interest.â€™â€Â  Furtick v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 374 S.C. 334, 339, 649\r\n  S.E.2d 35, 38 (2007) (quoting Sullivan v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 355 S.C.\r\n  437, 443, 586 S.E.2d 124, 127 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1153 (2004)).\r\nIn\r\n  terms of the ALCâ€™s jurisdiction to review parole decisions, this Court has\r\n  analyzed the appealability ramifications of a decision by the Parole Board\r\n  denying parole versus a determination that an inmate is not parole eligible.Â  Furtick\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Prob., Parole &amp; Pardon Servs., 352 S.C. 594, 576\r\n  S.E.2d 146 (2003), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 932 (2003).Â  In Furtick,\r\n  this Court extended the Al-Shabazz holding by finding â€œthe permanent denial of parole eligibility implicates a liberty interest sufficient to\r\n  require at least minimal due process,â€ and, thus, review by the ALC.Â  Furtick,\r\n  352 S.C. at 598, 576 S.E.2d at 149. Â â€œIn reaching this conclusion, the Court\r\n  emphasized the finality of the Departmentâ€™s decision, and distinguished the final determination of parole eligibility from the temporary granting or\r\n  denial of parole to an eligible inmate.â€Â  Sullivan, 355 S.C. at 443, 586\r\n  S.E.2d at 127.Â  This Court has further elaborated on the holding in Furtick,\r\n  stating:\r\n\r\n\tIn simple terms, this means that an inmate\r\n  has a right of review by the ALJD after a final decision that he is ineligible for parole, but that a parole-eligible inmate does not have the same right of\r\n  review after a decision denying parole; the parole board is, however, required\r\n  to review an inmateâ€™s case every twelve months after a negative parole\r\n  determination.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-620 (Supp. 2002).Â  This distinction\r\n  stems from the fact that parole is a privilege, not a right.\r\n\r\nSullivan, 355 S.C. at 443 n.4, 586 S.E.2d at 124\r\n  n.4; see Steele v. Benjamin, 362 S.C. 66, 72, 606 S.E.2d 499, 502\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œFurtick established that an inmate has a right to a ALJD review of an\r\n  agencyâ€™s final decision denying parole eligibility, but an inmate does not have\r\n  a right to a review of a denial of parole. Â The distinction is that the review\r\n  or consideration for parole is a right granted by statute whereas parole is\r\n  only a privilege.â€).Â  However, our\r\n  Court of Appeals has noted that â€œ[t]he use of the word permanent in Sullivan and Furtick does not mean that there must be a permanent denial of\r\n  parole eligibility before a sufficient liberty interest is involved.Â  It is\r\n  merely one of the ways that a sufficient liberty interest may be involved.â€Â  Steele,\r\n  362 S.C. at 72, 606 S.E.2d at 502.\r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, we find the fact that the Parole Board did not permanently\r\n  deny Cooper parole is not dispositive and the ALC erred in summarily dismissing\r\n  the appeal on this basis.Â  To make a decision based solely on the outcome of\r\n  the Parole Boardâ€™s decision would be an oversimplification and merely involves\r\n  a matter of semantics.Â  As noted in Steele, a sufficient liberty\r\n  interest may be implicated to trigger due process requirements even though the\r\n  Parole Boardâ€™s decision did not constitute a permanent denial of parole\r\n  eligibility.Â  See Steele, 362 S.C. at 72-73, 606 S.E.2d at 503\r\n  (holding inmateâ€™s complaint that the Departmentâ€™s application of biannual\r\n  parole review to him constituted an ex post facto violation implicated a\r\n  protected liberty interest which warranted judicial review under the APA); Id. at 71, 606 S.E.2d at 502 (stating â€œSullivan seems to imply that a\r\n  quantitative analysis of the liberty interest must be conductedâ€ when\r\n  determining whether the ALJD has subject matter jurisdiction over\r\n  non-collateral matters).\r\nHere, Cooper clearly was not permanently denied parole\r\n  eligibility.[4]Â \r\n  Moreover, Cooper is not appealing the denial of parole.Â  Instead, he is\r\n  challenging through his appeal the Parole Boardâ€™s failure to utilize the procedure\r\n  promulgated by the Legislature in section 24-21-640 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  and the criteria established by the Parole Board pursuant to this statute.Â \r\n  Thus, the question becomes whether Cooperâ€™s claim raises a sufficient\r\n  state-created liberty interest to trigger due process requirements.Â  If a\r\n  Parole Board deviates from or fails to render its decision without\r\n  consideration of the appropriate criteria, we believe it essentially abrogates\r\n  an inmateâ€™s right to parole eligibility and, thus, infringes on a state-created\r\n  liberty interest. \r\nUndoubtedly, the Parole Board is the sole authority with respect\r\n  to decisions regarding the grant or denial of parole.Â  However, the Legislature\r\n  created this Board to operate within certain parameters.Â  We do not believe the\r\n  Legislature established the Board and intended for it to render decisions\r\n  without any means of accountability.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the Parole Board denied Cooperâ€™s parole\r\n  apparently without giving credence to section 24-21-640 or its own criteria.Â \r\n  The Parole Board rejected Cooperâ€™s parole\r\n  for three limited reasons:Â  (1) the nature and seriousness of the current\r\n  offense; (2) an indication of violence in this or a previous offense; and (3)\r\n  the use of a deadly weapon in this or a previous offense.[5] Â Each of these reasons, as Cooper points out, â€œare fixed as of the date of the\r\n  offense and can never . . . be changed by the actions of [Cooper] while\r\n  incarcerated.â€Â  Parole is a privilege and Cooper has no right to be paroled;\r\n  however, Cooper does have a right to require the Board to adhere to statutory\r\n  requirements in rendering a decision.Â  We find the apparent failure by the\r\n  Parole Board to consider the requisite statutory criteria in rendering its\r\n  decision constitutes an infringement of a state-created liberty interest and,\r\n  thus, warrants minimal due process procedures.Â  Therefore, we hold, Cooperâ€™s\r\n  appeal was appropriate for disposition under the APA and should have been\r\n  reviewed by the ALC.Â  \r\nWe recognize\r\n  the Departmentâ€™s concern that a decision affirming the circuit court and\r\n  remanding to the ALC will create an overabundance of appeals from denials of\r\n  parole.Â  However, we believe this concern will be alleviated if the Parole\r\n  Board issues orders that are sufficiently detailed for the ALC to conduct\r\n  appellate review, limited to the Boardâ€™s adherence to section 24-21-640, of\r\n  decisions denying parole.Â  Because the limited appeal of parole decisions is\r\n  governed by the APA, the Parole Board and the ALC must comply with its\r\n  provisions.Â  Pursuant to the terms of the APA, a final decision in an agency\r\n  adjudication of a contested case â€œshall include findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law, separately stated.Â  Findings of fact, if set forth in\r\n  statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of\r\n  the underlying facts supporting the findings.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (2005).[6]Â  \r\nHere, the Parole Board apparently only\r\n  considered the nature of Cooperâ€™s crime when it rejected his request based on three\r\n  limited reasons.Â  Because the Parole Board neither offered an explanation nor\r\n  indicated that it had considered the statutory criteria of section 24-21-640\r\n  and the fifteen criteria listed on the parole form, the order was defective.Â \r\n  Therefore, we, as did the circuit court, can only conclude that the Parole\r\n  Boardâ€™s decision was arbitrary and capricious.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  emphasize that in future parole review hearings the Parole Board may avoid the\r\n  result in the instant case if it clearly states in its order denying parole\r\n  that it considered the factors outlined in section 24-21-640 and the fifteen\r\n  factors published in its parole form.Â  If the Board complies with this\r\n  procedure, the decision will constitute a routine denial of parole and the ALC\r\n  would have limited authority to review the decision to determine whether the\r\n  Board followed proper procedure.Â  Under that scenario, the ALC can summarily\r\n  dismiss the inmateâ€™s appeal. [7]\r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  Department asserts the Parole Board did not violate the Ex Post Facto clause in\r\n  denying Cooper parole.Â  The Department contends the detailed factors on the\r\n  parole form, used by the Parole Board, were based on the statutory criteria of\r\n  section 24-21-640.Â  In response, Cooper appears to challenge the authority of\r\n  the Parole Board to create these detailed factors.Â  Cooper contends that by\r\n  creating these factors the Parole Board â€œeffectively changed the standards for\r\n  granting parole and retroactively applied it to [his] offenses which were\r\n  committed before the establishment of these factors.â€Â  In doing so, Cooper\r\n  claims the Parole Board changed the law and, thus, violated the Ex Post Facto\r\n  clause of the South Carolina Constitution.[8]\r\nWe agree with the Departmentâ€™s assertion for two reasons.Â  First,\r\n  Cooper acknowledges that section 24-21-640 has not been substantively amended\r\n  since he was convicted. Â This section specifically authorizes the Board to\r\n  establish written criteria for the granting of parole.Â  Therefore, we find the\r\n  Parole Board did not exceed its authority by creating the written criteria.Â \r\n  Given the Parole Board was authorized to establish these criteria, we do not\r\n  believe the Parole Board changed the law in violation of the Ex Post Facto\r\n  clause.Â  See State v. Walls, 348 S.C. 26, 30, 558 S.E.2d 524, 525\r\n  (2002) (recognizing that while\r\n  both the United States and South Carolina Constitutions specifically prohibit ex post facto laws, two critical elements\r\n  must be present for a law to fall within the prohibition: Â (1) the law must\r\n  apply to events that occurred before its enactment; and (2) the offender of the\r\n  law must be disadvantaged by the law); see also Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256, 261, 531 S.E.2d 507, 509\r\n  (2000) (noting ex post\r\n  facto violation occurs when a change in the law\r\n  retroactively alters definition of crime or increases punishment for crime).Â  Secondly, it is disingenuous for Cooper to\r\n  contend the Parole Board exceeded its authority in adopting these written\r\n  criteria when his primary complaint is that the Parole Board failed to consider\r\n  any other factors than the three reasons given for the denial of his parole.Â  Â Â Â \r\nAlthough we disagree with the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the\r\n  Parole Board violated the Ex Post Facto clause, we agree with the courtâ€™s\r\n  ultimate conclusion that the Board failed to apply the statutory criteria of\r\n  section 24-21-640 in denying Cooperâ€™s petition for parole.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  modify the circuit courtâ€™s order with respect to this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the ALC had\r\n  jurisdiction to review Cooperâ€™s appeal.Â  Because Cooper is not appealing the\r\n  denial of parole, but rather, is challenging the method and procedure employed\r\n  by the Parole Board in reaching its decision, Cooperâ€™s claim raises a\r\n  sufficient liberty interest to trigger due process requirements of judicial\r\n  review.Â  If a Parole Board fails to consider and apply the statutorily-created\r\n  parole criteria, it has the effect of rendering an inmate parole ineligible,\r\n  which under Furtick warrants review by the ALC.Â  In the instant case,\r\n  the Parole Board apparently failed to consider the requisite factors and,\r\n  instead, based its decision on certain fixed factors that are unaffected by any\r\n  rehabilitation efforts on the part of Cooper.Â  Accordingly, we affirm as\r\n  modified the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the ALC and remand the matter to\r\n  the ALC for disposition in accordance with this opinion.\r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\nMOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because a decision on the jurisdictional question\r\n  encompasses the first two issues raised by the Department, we have consolidated\r\n  the analysis on these two issues in the interest of clarity and brevity.\r\n[2]Â  Cooper references a form given to an inmate by the\r\n  Department which outlines the relevant criteria for parole consideration.Â  This\r\n  form lists the following non-inclusive criteria:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n\t\t\tThe risk the inmate poses to the community;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tThe nature and seriousness of the inmateâ€™s offense, \r\n\t\t\tthe circumstances surrounding the offense, and the inmateâ€™s attitude \r\n\t\t\ttoward it;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tThe inmateâ€™s prior criminal records and his/her \r\n\t\t\tadjustment under any previous programs or supervision;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4. \r\n\t\t\tThe inmateâ€™s attitude toward his/her family, the \r\n\t\t\tvictim, and authority in general;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5.\r\n\t\t\tThe inmateâ€™s adjustment while in confinement, \r\n\t\t\tincluding his/her progress in counseling, therapy, and other similar \r\n\t\t\tprograms designed to encourage the inmate to improve \r\n\t\t\thimself/herself;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6. \r\n\t\t\tThe inmateâ€™s employment history, \r\n\t\t\tincluding his/her job training and skills and his/her stability in \r\n\t\t\tthe work place;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t7. \r\n\t\t\tThe inmateâ€™s physical, mental and emotional health;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t8.\r\n\t\t\tThe inmateâ€™s understanding of the cause of his/her \r\n\t\t\tpast criminal conduct;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t9.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe inmateâ€™s efforts to solve his/her problems, \r\n\t\t\tsuch as seeking treatment for substance abuse, enrolling in academic \r\n\t\t\tand vocational educational courses, and in general using whatever \r\n\t\t\tresources the Department of Corrections has made available to \r\n\t\t\tinmates to help with their problems;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t10. \r\n\t\t\tThe adequacy of the inmateâ€™s overall parole plan. Â This\r\n  includes inmates living arrangements, where he/she will live and who he will\r\n  live with; the character of those with whom the inmate plans to associate in\r\n  both his/her working hours and his/her off-work hours; the inmateâ€™s plans for\r\n  gainful employment;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t11.\r\n\t\t\tThe willingness of the community into which the inmate\r\n  will be released to receive the inmate;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t12.\r\n\t\t\tThe willingness of the inmateâ€™s family to allow\r\n  him/her to return to the family circle;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t13.\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;The attitudes of the sentencing judge, the solicitor,\r\n  and local law enforcement officers respecting the inmateâ€™s parole;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t14.\r\n\t\t\tThe feelings of the victimâ€™s family, and any witnesses\r\n  to the crime about the release of the inmate;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t15. \r\n\t\t\tOther factors considered relevant in a particular case\r\n  by the Board. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n[3]Â Â  Section 24-21-640 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tThe board must carefully consider the record of the\r\n  prisoner before, during and after imprisonment, and no such prisoner may be\r\n  paroled until it appears to the satisfaction of the board:Â  that the prisoner\r\n  has shown a disposition to reform; that, in the future he will probably obey\r\n  the law and lead a correct life; that by his conduct he has merited a lessening\r\n  of the rigors of his imprisonment; that the interest of society will not be\r\n  impaired thereby; and, that suitable employment has been secured for him.Â  The\r\n  board must establish written, specific criteria for the granting of parole and\r\n  provisional parole.Â  This criteria must reflect all of the aspects of this\r\n  section and include a review of a prisonerâ€™s disciplinary and other records.Â \r\n  The criteria must be made available to all prisoners at the time of their\r\n  incarceration and the general public.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-21-640 (2007).\r\n[4]Â Â  During the course of this appeal, Cooper may have\r\n  received another review by the Parole Board in June 2006 and June 2007.Â  \r\n[5]Â  These reasons would be sufficient to deny parole in\r\n  the Boardâ€™s discretion, if the Boardâ€™s decision evinced consideration of\r\n  section 24-21-640 and its own criteria.\r\n[6] Â We are cognizant of the unique status accorded\r\n  parole and our precedent of limited appellate review notwithstanding the APA.\r\n[7] Â Notably, Cooper acknowledged at oral argument that\r\n  the parties would not be before this Court had the Parole Board stated in its\r\n  order that the section 24-21-640 had been considered as well as the other\r\n  conditions outlined on the parole form.\r\n[8] Â The\r\n  Constitutions of the United States and of South Carolina specifically prohibit\r\n  the passage of ex post facto laws.

\r\n  \r\n\r\n(e) Same: Other Service.&nbsp; Whenever a statute or an order  of the court provides for service of a summons and complaint, or an order upon  a party not an inhabitant or found within the county of the court&rsquo;s  jurisdiction, service shall be made under the circumstance and in the manner  prescribed by the statute, rule, or order.\r\n(f) Territorial Limits of Effective Service.&nbsp; All process  other than a subpoena may be served anywhere within the territorial limits of  the State and, when a statute so provides, beyond the territorial limits of the  State.&nbsp; A subpoena may be served within  the county of the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.&nbsp;  Nothing in this subdivision is meant to extend the jurisdiction of the  magistrates court beyond the limits otherwise established by law.\r\n(g) Proof and Return.&nbsp; The person serving the process  shall promptly make proof of service and deliver it to the court.&nbsp; If served by the sheriff, the sheriff&rsquo;s  deputy, or a magistrate&rsquo;s constable, proof of service shall be made by  certificate.&nbsp; If served by any other  person, the person shall make an affidavit of service.&nbsp; If served by publication, the printer or  publisher shall make an affidavit of publication, and an affidavit of mailing  shall be made to the party or the party&rsquo;s attorney if mailing of process is  permitted or required by law.&nbsp; Failure to  make proof of service does not affect the validity of service.&nbsp; The proof of service shall state the date,  time, and place of service and a description of the person actually  served.&nbsp; If service was by mail, the  person serving process shall show in the proof of service the date and place of  mailing, and attach a copy of the return receipt or the returned envelope  showing whether the mailing was accepted, refused, or otherwise returned.&nbsp; If the mailing was refused, the return shall  also show proof of any further service on the defendant pursuant to paragraph  (d)(6) of this rule.&nbsp; The return along  with the receipt or envelope and any other proof shall be promptly filed with  the court with the pleadings and become a part of the record.&nbsp;\r\n(h) Proof of Service Outside the State.&nbsp; When the  service is made outside of the State, the proof of service may be made by  affidavit before:\r\n\r\n  (1) Any person in  this State authorized to make an affidavit;\r\n  (2) A  commissioner of deeds for this State;\r\n  (3) A notary  public who shall affix to the proof of service an official seal; \r\n  (4) A clerk of  court of record who shall certify the same by an official seal; or,\r\n  (5) If made  outside the limits of the United    States, a consul, vice-consul, or consular  agent of the United States who shall use in the certificate an official seal.\r\n\r\n(i) Amendment.&nbsp; At any time in its discretion and upon terms  it deems just, the court may, by written order, allow any process or proof of  service to be amended, unless it clearly appears that material prejudice would  result to the substantial rights of the party against whom the process issued.\r\n(j) Acceptance of Service.&nbsp; No other proof  of service shall be required when acceptance of service is acknowledged in  writing and signed by the person served or the person&rsquo;s attorney and delivered  to the court.&nbsp; The acknowledgement shall  state the place and date service is accepted.\r\n(k) Dismissal of Summons and Complaint.&nbsp; Subject to the  provisions of any statute, rule, or order, a magistrate may dismiss a summons  and complaint against any or all defendants without prejudice to the plaintiff  if service of process cannot be obtained within one hundred twenty (120) days  of the filing of the complaint.&nbsp; \r\nRULE 7\r\n    ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM; TIME FOR FILING\r\n(a) The defendant may reply to the plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint  by filing a written statement in a form approved by the magistrate or by  personally appearing and making an oral statement.&nbsp; This reply shall be called an &ldquo;answer.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the defendant personally appears within  the specified time period and makes an oral answer, it shall be reduced to  writing.&nbsp; The court or court personnel  shall assist the defendant in reducing the answer to writing if the court  determines assistance is required.&nbsp; The  defendant&rsquo;s answer may deny in total or in part any or all of the material allegations  made in the plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint, and/or allege any new matter constituting a  defense.&nbsp; The court shall deliver a copy  of the answer to the plaintiff in a manner provided for in Rule 8.\r\n(b) A defendant shall file an answer and any  appropriate counterclaims with the court within thirty (30) days from the first  day after the date of service.&nbsp; When  service is by some other means, as provided for in Rule 6, the defendant shall  file the answer and any appropriate counterclaims with the court within the  time period designated by the statute, rule, or order, and the time period  shall be stated in the summons.\r\nRULE 8\r\n    DELIVERY AND FILING OF PLEADINGS AND  OTHER PAPERS\r\n(a) Delivery:  When required.&nbsp; Every order, pleading after the original  summons and complaint, written motion, written notice, appearance, demand,  offer of judgment, or similar documents shall be delivered to each of the  parties unless otherwise ordered by the court.&nbsp; \r\n(b) Same: How Made.&nbsp; Whenever under these rules delivery of  documents is required to be made upon a party represented by an attorney,  delivery of the documents shall be made to the attorney unless otherwise  ordered by the court.&nbsp; Delivery of a  document to a party shall be made by delivering it to that party or by mailing  it to the party&rsquo;s last known address or, if no address is known, by filing it  with the court.&nbsp; Delivery of a copy  within this rule means: handing it to the attorney or to the party; or leaving  it at the office of the attorney or the party with a clerk or other person in  charge of the office; or, if there is no one in charge, leaving it at the  party&rsquo;s usual place of abode with a resident of suitable age and discretion; or  mailing it to the last known address of that party.&nbsp; Delivery by mail of all pleadings and papers after  service of the original summons and complaint is complete upon mailing.\r\n(c) Service or Delivery on Sunday.&nbsp; Civil process  may be served on Sundays, provided that no person may be served going to or  from or attending a regularly or specially scheduled church or religious  service on Sunday.&nbsp; \r\nRULE 9\r\n    COUNTERCLAIM\r\n(a) At any time  within the time period specified in these rules for answering the complaint,  the defendant may assert a counterclaim which grows out of the same transaction  or occurrence as the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim by filing a written statement in a form  approved by the magistrate or by personally appearing and making an oral  statement.&nbsp; If the defendant personally  appears within the specified time period and makes an oral counterclaim, it  shall be reduced to writing.&nbsp; The court  or court personnel shall assist the defendant in reducing the counterclaim to  writing if the court determines assistance is required.&nbsp; The counterclaim shall be delivered to the  plaintiff by the court in a manner provided for in Rule 8.&nbsp; The claims contained in the counterclaim  shall be deemed denied by the plaintiff and no answer or reply is required to  be filed by the plaintiff in response to a counterclaim filed by the  defendant.&nbsp;\r\n(b) The defendant in a counterclaim may waive  the excess of the claim over the jurisdictional maximum to bring it within the  jurisdiction of the magistrates court.&nbsp;  If the defendant elects to waive a portion of the counterclaim, a  separate action for the remainder of the claim may not be maintained.&nbsp; If the defendant does not waive the excess,  the entire action shall be transferred to the circuit court of the county to be  considered and tried as if the action had been originally filed in the circuit  court as provided for in Rule 13(j), SCRCP.\r\nRULE 10\r\n    TRIAL DATE; NOTICE; FAILURE TO ANSWER\r\n(a) Upon the filing of an answer by the  defendant, the magistrate shall set the date of trial and deliver notice of the  trial date to both parties in a manner provided for in Rule 8.\r\n(b) If the defendant has failed to answer  within the time period specified by these rules, the magistrate shall set a  hearing date and shall deliver notice of the hearing date to both parties in a  manner provided for in Rule 8 when the hearing is necessary for the entering of  a default judgment in a manner consistent with Rule 11.&nbsp; At the default hearing, the defendant may  participate only by cross-examining witnesses and objecting to evidence.&nbsp; \r\nRULE 11\r\n    DEFAULT JUDGMENT; DISMISSAL OF ACTION;  DAMAGES\r\n(a) If the defendant does not answer the  complaint within the time period specified by these rules or answers within the  specified time period but fails to appear at the time set for trial, judgment  may be given for the plaintiff by default if the amount of the claim is  liquidated.&nbsp; If the claim is  unliquidated, and the defendant fails to answer within the time period  specified by these rules or answers within the specified time period but then  fails to appear at the time set for trial, judgment may be given to the  plaintiff by default as in the case of liquidated claims if (1) the plaintiff  itemizes the account and attaches an affidavit that it is true and correct and  that no part of the sum sued for has been paid by discount or otherwise and (2)  a copy of the account and affidavit was served with the summons on the  defendant.&nbsp; In all other cases when the  defendant fails to appear or answer, the plaintiff cannot recover without  proving damages.&nbsp; \r\n(b) If the plaintiff does not appear at trial,  or if neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appears at the time and place  specified for trial, the court may enter an order dismissing the action.\r\n(c) If the defendant has filed a counterclaim  against the plaintiff and the plaintiff fails to appear at the time set for  trial, judgment may be given for the defendant by default if the claim is liquidated.&nbsp; If the claim is unliquidated, and the  plaintiff fails to appear at the time set for trial, judgment may be given to  the defendant by default as in the case of liquidated demands if (1) the  defendant itemizes the account and attaches an affidavit that it is true and  correct and that no part of the sum sued for has been paid by discount or  otherwise and (2) a copy of the account and affidavit is filed with the answer  and is delivered to the plaintiff as provided for in Rule 8.&nbsp; In all other cases when the plaintiff fails  to appear, the defendant cannot recover on a counterclaim without proving  damages.&nbsp; \r\n(d) If a default hearing is conducted at the  time set for trial because either the plaintiff or the defendant failed to  appear, no further notice need be given of the default hearing, provided both  parties were properly delivered notice of the time set for trial in a manner  provided for in Rule 8.\r\n(e) For good cause shown, the court may set  aside a default or a default judgment in accordance with Rule 12.\r\nRULE 12\r\n    RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT OR ORDER\r\n(a) Clerical mistakes and errors arising from  oversight or omission in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record may be  corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of  any party and after any notice that the court orders.&nbsp; During the pendency of an appeal, leave to  correct the mistake must be obtained from the appellate court.\r\n(b) On motion and upon terms that are just, the  court may relieve a party or the party&rsquo;s legal representative from a final  judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence  which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new  trial under Rule 19; (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an  adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied,  released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been  reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment  should have prospective application.&nbsp; The  motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and  (3), not more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was  entered or taken.&nbsp; A motion under this  subdivision does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its  operation.&nbsp; This rule does not limit the  power of the court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a  judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the  court.&nbsp; During the pendency of an appeal,  leave to make the motion must be obtained from the appellate court.&nbsp; The procedure for obtaining any relief from  judgment shall be by motion as prescribed in these rules, by appeal, or by an  independent action.&nbsp; \r\nRULE 13\r\n    CONDUCT OF TRIAL; JURY TRIALS;  WITNESSES; SUBPOENAS\r\n(a) Trials should be conducted in an informal  manner and the South Carolina Rules of Evidence shall apply but shall be  relaxed in the interest of justice.&nbsp; In  the trial of a civil action, in which one or both parties are unrepresented by  legal counsel, the court shall question the parties and witnesses in order to  assure that all claims and defenses are fully presented.\r\n(b) Notice of the fact that court personnel  will explain to all parties the procedure of the magistrates court and will  assist them, if such assistance is required, to fill out all forms that may be  necessary or appropriate shall be conspicuously posted in the magistrates  office in the following form:\r\nNOTICE TO  ALL PARTIES IN CIVIL ACTIONS\r\n\r\n  THIS OFFICE WILL EXPLAIN THE PROCEDURE OF THE COURT,  AND WILL HELP YOU PREPARE PAPERS RELATED TO YOUR ACTION, IF THE COURT  DETERMINES SUCH HELP IS REQUIRED.\r\n\r\n(c) If either party wants a jury trial, it must  be requested in writing at least five (5) working days prior to the original  date set for trial.\r\n(d) All testimony shall be given under oath or  affirmation.\r\n(e) The court shall have the power to issue  subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses.&nbsp; The court may issue a subpoena, signed but  otherwise in blank, to a party requesting it, who shall complete it before  service.&nbsp; An attorney as officer of the court may also issue and sign a  subpoena on behalf of a court in which the attorney is authorized to practice.\r\nRULE 14\r\n    AMENDMENT OF COMPLAINTS, ANSWERS, AND  COUNTERCLAIMS; CONTINUANCES\r\nThe court shall be lenient in  the allowance of changes or amendments to complaints, answers, and  counterclaims, and in granting continuances of trials for good cause shown when  necessary to serve the ends of justice.&nbsp;  However, except in unusual circumstances, no party shall be allowed more  than one continuance in any case and all continuances must have the specific  approval of the court.&nbsp; Continuances  shall be for as short a period as possible, and, where feasible, the wishes of  the party not requesting the continuance shall be considered in scheduling a  new hearing date.&nbsp; Raising a claim,  defense, or counterclaim for the first time at trial shall constitute grounds  for a continuance when necessary to serve the ends of justice. \r\nRULE 15\r\n    EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN PARTIES;  SETTLEMENT\r\n(a) Recognizing the unique nature of the  court&rsquo;s jurisdiction and the need for a speedy determination of actions filed  in the court, the prompt voluntary exchange of information and documents by  parties prior to trial is encouraged, but in no event shall the court require  such exchange.&nbsp; \r\n(b) The court, with both parties present, shall  confer with the parties before any trial whenever it appears that a conference  might simplify the issues, shorten the trial, or lead to a voluntary exchange  of information which might promote settlement.&nbsp;  The court in its discretion may order that a list of exhibits a party  intends to offer into evidence at the trial be furnished to the opposing party  and/or that the opposing party be given a reasonable opportunity to copy or  examine the exhibits.\r\nRULE 16\r\n    DIRECTED VERDICT; JUDGMENT  NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT\r\n(a) At the close of evidence offered by a  party, if the case presents only questions of law, the court may direct a  verdict on its own motion or on motion of either party.&nbsp; The order of the court granting a directed  verdict is effective without any assent of a jury.\r\n(b) If, at the close of all the evidence, a  directed verdict is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the  action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions  raised during the trial of the case if the case is being tried before a jury.&nbsp; If a jury verdict is returned, the court may  allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new  trial or direct the entry of judgment as if a directed verdict had been  granted.&nbsp; A jury verdict is final if no  motion for a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict is filed with  the court within five (5) days of the rendering of the jury verdict and the  court has not on its own motion ordered a new trial or directed a verdict  notwithstanding the jury verdict.\r\nRULE 17\r\n    COSTS; NOTICE OF JUDGMENT; ENFORCEMENT\r\n(a) The party recovering judgment shall also  recover those costs provided for by law, which shall not be included when  determining the jurisdictional amount of the court.\r\n(b) The court shall deliver written notice of  judgment to all parties or their attorneys using the procedure described in  Rule 8, except that no written notice need be delivered to a party if the  judgment is announced at the trial in the presence of that party or the party&rsquo;s  attorney.\r\n(c) The process to enforce a judgment for the  payment of money shall be by writ of execution and shall be conducted as  provided by law.&nbsp; \r\n(d) Upon payment in full, the judgment creditor  shall file a statement of collection with the magistrates court and with the  Clerk of the Circuit Court, if the judgment had been previously filed with the  Clerk of the Circuit Court.\r\nRULE 18\r\n    APPEALS\r\n(a) All appeals of judgments  rendered by the magistrates court shall be to the circuit court of the county  where the judgment was rendered.&nbsp; Within thirty (30) days after delivery of written notice of  judgment to the parties or their attorneys, a party wishing to appeal shall  serve on the respondent and file a notice of appeal containing a statement of  the grounds for appeal with the magistrate rendering the judgment and with the  Circuit Court of the County where the judgment was rendered.&nbsp; If the judgment is announced at the trial in  the presence of the parties or their attorneys, the notice of appeal shall be  served and filed within thirty (30) days of the date the judgment is  announced.&nbsp; At the time of the filing of  the notice of appeal, the appropriate filing fee shall be paid by the appellant  to the clerk of the circuit court to which the appeal is taken, unless a motion  for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and an affidavit showing the appellant&rsquo;s inability to pay the fee required to  appeal the action accompanies the filing of the notice of appeal.&nbsp; The right of appeal from a judgment exists  for thirty (30) days after the denial of a motion for a new trial.\r\n(b) Within thirty (30) days of the date of  filing of the notice of appeal with the Circuit Court, the magistrate shall  file the return to the notice of appeal with the Clerk of the Circuit Court for  the county wherein the judgment was rendered, together with the record, a  statement of all proceedings in the case, and, if necessary, the testimony  taken at trial. Upon motion for good cause shown, the Circuit Court may allow a  definite extension of time in which to file the return.\r\n(c) Pursuant to Rule 75, SCRCP, upon receipt of  the magistrate&rsquo;s return, the clerk of the Circuit Court to which the appeal is  taken shall give notice in writing to the parties that the return has been  filed.\r\nRULE 19\r\n    NEW TRIAL; AMENDMENT OF JUDGMENTS\r\n(a) A new trial may be granted to all or any of  the parties and on all or part of the issues for any of the reasons for which  new trials previously have been granted in the courts of this state.&nbsp; On motion for a new trial in an action tried  without a jury, the court may open the judgment, if one has been entered, may  take additional testimony, may amend findings of fact and conclusions of law,  may make new findings and conclusions, and may direct the entry of a new  judgment.\r\n(b) The motion for a new trial shall be made in  writing and filed with the court no later than five (5) days after notice of  the judgment.&nbsp; The court shall notify all  opposing parties that the motion has been filed and shall provide those parties  a copy of the motion in a manner provided for in Rule 8.\r\n(c) Not later than five (5) days after entry of  judgment, the court, on its own initiative, may order a new trial for any  reason for which it might have granted a new trial on motion of a party.&nbsp; After giving the parties notice and an  opportunity to be heard on the matter, the court may grant a motion for a new  trial, timely served, for a reason not stated in the motion.&nbsp; In either case, the court shall specify in  the order the grounds for granting a new trial.&nbsp; \r\n(d) A motion to alter or amend the judgment  shall be filed no later than five (5) days after notice of the judgment.&nbsp; The court shall notify all opposing parties  that the motion has been filed and shall provide those parties a copy of the  motion in a manner provided for in Rule 8.\r\n(e) Except by consent of the parties, argument  on a motion for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment shall be heard by  the magistrate before whom the trial was held.&nbsp;  However, the motion may, in the discretion of the court, be decided on  briefs filed by the parties without oral argument.\r\nRULE 20\r\n    OFFER OF JUDGMENT; CONSEQUENCES OF  NON-ACCEPTANCE\r\n(a) Offer  of Judgment.&nbsp; No later than ten (10)  days prior to trial, either party may serve upon the adverse party an offer to  allow judgment to be taken against the party for the money or property or to  the effect specified in the offer with costs accrued to the date of the  offer.&nbsp; If, within ten (10) days after  service of the offer, or at least five (5) days prior to the trial date,  whichever date is earlier, the adverse party serves written notice that the  offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of  acceptance together with proof of service, and the court shall enter  judgment.&nbsp; An offer that is not accepted  shall be deemed rejected and evidence of the offer is not admissible except in  a proceeding to determine costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n(b) Consequences  of Non-Acceptance.&nbsp; If an offer of  judgment is not accepted and the offeror obtains a verdict or determination at  least as favorable as the rejected offer, the offeror shall recover from the  offeree: (1) any administrative, filing, or other court costs from the date of  the offer until the entry of the judgment; (2) if the offeror is a plaintiff,  eight percent interest computed on the amount of the verdict or award from the  date of the offer to the entry of judgment; or (3) if the offeror is a  defendant, reduction from the judgment or award of eight percent interest  computed on the amount of the verdict or award from the date of the offer to  the entry of the judgment.\r\n(c) This rule shall not abrogate the  contractual rights of any party concerning the recovery of attorney&rsquo;s fees or  other monies in accordance with the provision of any written contract between  the parties to the action.\r\nRULE 21\r\n    BUSINESS REPRESENTATION\r\nA business, as defined by  S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-1-103, may be represented in a civil magistrates court  proceeding by a non-lawyer officer, agent, or employee, including attorneys  licensed in other jurisdictions and those possessing Limited Certificates of  Admission pursuant to Rule 405, SCACR.&nbsp;  The representation may be compensated and shall be undertaken at the  business&rsquo;s option and with the understanding that the business assumes the risk  of any problems incurred as the result of the representation.&nbsp; The court shall require a written  authorization from the entity&rsquo;s president, chairperson, general partner, owner,  or chief executive officer, or in the case of a person possessing a Limited  Certificate, a copy of that certificate, before permitting the representation.&nbsp; \r\nRULE 22\r\n    ARGUMENTS ON MOTIONS AND AT TRIAL\r\n The  moving party upon a motion shall have the right, at that party&rsquo;s option, to  both open and close argument, and the plaintiff shall have the option to have  the right to open and close argument upon the trial; except that a party  admitting the adverse party&rsquo;s claim in his pleading, and taking upon him the  burden of proof, shall have the same privilege.&nbsp;  The party having the right to open shall be required to open in full,  and in reply may respond in full but may not introduce any new matter.\r\n  RULE 23\r\n  SUBPOENAS\r\n(a) Any magistrate, on the application of any  party to a cause pending in the magistrates court, shall issue a subpoena  citing any person whose testimony may be required in the cause to appear and  give evidence.&nbsp; The Court may issue a  subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party requesting it, who shall  complete it before service.&nbsp; An attorney as officer of the court may also  issue and sign a subpoena on behalf of a court in which the attorney is authorized  to practice.  &nbsp;Every subpoena shall state the name of the  court, and the title of the action, and shall command each person to whom it is  directed to attend and give testimony at a time and place specified.\r\n(b) A subpoena may be served by the sheriff of  any county in which the witness may be found, by the sheriff&rsquo;s deputy, by a  constable of the court, or by any other person who is not a party and is not  less than eighteen (18) years of age.&nbsp;  Service of a subpoena upon a person named in the subpoena shall be made  as provided by Rule 6 and Rule 8 (c).\r\n(c) No subpoena shall require a witness to  appear in any proceeding not held within the county where that witness resides.\r\n(d) Failure by any person without adequate  excuse to obey a subpoena served upon the person may be deemed in contempt of  court from which the subpoena issued.\r\n(e) A witness subpoenaed to attend a proceeding  under these rules shall receive for each day&rsquo;s attendance and for the time  necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the proceeding $25.00 per  day and mileage in the same amount as provided by law for official travel of  State officers and employees.\r\n(f) In case it shall appear to the satisfaction  of any magistrate that the attendance of any witness whose testimony may be  required in any case pending before the magistrate cannot be had because of  just cause for the witness&rsquo; absence, extreme age, sickness or infirmity, or  when the witness does not reside in the county of the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction, the  magistrate may take the examination of such witness or cause it to be done by  another magistrate or other officer authorized by law to administer oaths, to  be used in evidence on the trial of the case.&nbsp;  All parties to the cause shall have notice of the examination so that  they may examine or cross-examine the witness.&nbsp;  When the examination is made by another, it shall be recorded and  sealed, with the title of the case endorsed, and conveyed by a disinterested  person to the magistrate authorizing it or mailed postage prepaid to that magistrate.\r\nRULE 24\r\n    FORMS\r\nThe use of the following  forms in the magistrates court is recommended.&nbsp;  The magistrates court shall make these forms available without charge to  any person who is a litigant in an action before the court.&nbsp; Subject to the approval of the Supreme Court,  the Office of Court Administration shall make amendments to these forms and add  forms as is deemed appropriate.&nbsp;

Thrift appeals from his guilty plea to assault and battery with\r\n  intent to kill and his sentence of twelve years.Â  He argues the plea judgeâ€™s comments regarding his\r\n  right to appeal rendered his plea conditional and that there should be another\r\n  procedure in place for appeals of non-meritorious guilty pleas.Â  We affirm\r\n  Thriftâ€™s guilty plea and sentence pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the\r\n  following authorities:Â  State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 146, 604 S.E.2d\r\n  377, 379-40 (2004) (finding that a plea was not a conditional one where the\r\n  defendant did not attempt to reserve his right to later deny or qualify his\r\n  guilt); State v. Passaro, 350 S.C. 499, 505, 567 S.E.2d 862, 866 (2002)\r\n  (noting that a guilty plea generally acts\r\n  as a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects and defenses); Roddy v. State,\r\n  339 S.C. 29, 33, 528 S.E.2d 418, 421 (2000) (â€œTo find a guilty plea is\r\n  voluntarily and knowingly entered into, the record must establish the defendant\r\n  had a full understanding of the consequences of his plea and the charges\r\n  against him.â€); State v. Munsch,\r\n  287 S.C. 313, 314, 338 S.E.2d 329, 330 (1985) (holding a guilty plea admits the\r\n  elements of the offenses charged and leaves open for review only the\r\n  sufficiency of the indictment and waives all other defenses); State v. Thomason, 341 S.C. 524, 526, 534 S.E.2d 708, 710 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting that where an appellant seeks to reopen a guilty plea\r\n  proceeding, the inquiry is generally confined to whether the plea was knowingly\r\n  and voluntarily entered); Rule 201(a), SCACR (â€œAppeal may be taken, as provided\r\n  by law, from any final judgment, appealable order or decision.â€).Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  we take this opportunity to point out to the bench and bar that a new procedure\r\n  has already been promulgated by this Court to deal with guilty pleas.Â \r\n  Effective May 1, 2008, Rule 203, SCACR,\r\n  was amended to require an explanation of issues be filed with the notice of\r\n  appeal from a guilty plea:\r\n\r\n  (B)(iv)Â  If the appeal is from a guilty plea, an Alford plea or a plea of nolo contendere, a written explanation showing that there is\r\n    an issue which can be reviewed on appeal.Â  This explanation should identify the\r\n    issue(s) to be raised on appeal and the factual basis for the issue(s)\r\n    including how the issue(s) was raised below and the ruling of the lower court\r\n    on that issue(s).Â  If an issue was not raised to and ruled upon by the lower\r\n    court, the explanation shall include argument and citation to legal authority\r\n    showing how this issue can be reviewed on appeal.Â  If the appellant fails to\r\n    make a sufficient showing, the notice of appeal may be dismissed.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26483","title":"Shumpert v.

California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).\r\n\r\nPetitioner filed a PCR application, and at the PCR\r\n  hearing, Petitioner sought to admit an affidavit of one of the jurors in his\r\n  criminal trial as evidence of jury misconduct.Â  In relevant part, the affidavit\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n\tI recall\r\n  it being discussed in the jury room that if [Petitioner] wasnâ€™t guilty [] he\r\n  would have taken the stand and informed us, and also one of the jurors stated\r\n  that if he wasnâ€™t guilty [] he would have had family members or witnesses take\r\n  the stand to tell us.\r\n\tThere\r\n  were a couple of people at least, maybe more, that made these statements.Â  I\r\n  firmly believe that these comments weighed importantly in the jury deciding to\r\n  convict [Petitioner].Â  The tall skinny white lady who kept wanting to talk to\r\n  [the trial court] seemed very concerned by this and I believe it played a big\r\n  part in her decisions.Â  She was very confused about it all.Â  Also the\r\n  preacherâ€™s wife, I canâ€™t recall her name, was very unsure about it.\r\n\tI donâ€™t\r\n  recall anybody in the jury room mentioning the judge telling us not to consider\r\n  that.Â  I do remember the judge saying that we can only â€œreach a decision based\r\n  on the evidence presented before you today.â€\r\n\tI think\r\n  when we voted we were ten to two to convict when the ladies asked the judge if\r\n  they could go home and sleep on it.Â  If I had it to do again, it would have\r\n  been nine to three because I think I let those comments about him not\r\n  testifying swing my vote.Â  Deep down inside I think we made a wrong decision\r\n  and for the wrong reason - basically for the comments that were made in that\r\n  room about him not getting up to deny it.Â  I also believe that we made those\r\n  ladies change their vote because of that.Â  I feel that others in that jury, if\r\n  they are asked, will agree with me, especially those two ladies.\r\n\r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, Petitioner argued that the affidavit constituted evidence that\r\n  some jurors may have considered the fact that Petitioner did not testify at\r\n  trial in their deliberations.Â  The State argued that the affidavit was\r\n  inadmissible under the rules of evidence and the relevant jurisprudence, and\r\n  that the affidavit was based largely on hindsight and speculation.Â  The PCR court\r\n  held that the affidavit was inadmissible, and the hearing continued in order to\r\n  address the remaining claims in Petitionerâ€™s PCR application.Â  The PCR court\r\n  ultimately denied relief.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari, and Petitioner\r\n  presents the following issue for review:\r\nDid\r\n  the PCR court err in excluding the jurorâ€™s affidavit?\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nThis\r\n  Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings and conclusions.Â  Caprood\r\n    v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing McCray\r\n      v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995)).Â  A PCR courtâ€™s findings\r\n  will be upheld on review if there is any evidence of probative value supporting\r\n  them.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).Â \r\n  Where the PCR courtâ€™s decision is controlled by an error of law, however, this\r\n  Court will reverse.Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222,\r\n  225 (2000).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that the PCR court erred in excluding the jurorâ€™s affidavit.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nFor\r\n  a considerable period of history, the rule in South Carolina was that a jurorâ€™s\r\n  testimony was not admissible to prove either a jurorâ€™s own misconduct or the\r\n  misconduct of fellow jurors.Â  State v. Thomas, 268 S.C. 343, 348, 234\r\n  S.E.2d 16, 18 (1977) (citing Barsh v. Chrysler Corp., 262 S.C. 129, 203\r\n  S.E.2d 107 (1974)).Â  Rule 606(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence alters\r\n  this common law rule by allowing a juror to offer testimony as to â€œwhether\r\n  extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the juryâ€™s\r\n  attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon\r\n  any juror.â€Â  The rule additionally provides:\r\n\r\n\t[A]\r\n  juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course\r\n  of the juryâ€™s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other\r\n  jurorâ€™s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from\r\n  the verdict or indictment or concerning the jurorâ€™s mental processes in\r\n  connection therewith, . . . [n]or may a jurorâ€™s affidavit or evidence of any\r\n  statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be\r\n  precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Rule 606\r\n  thus draws a distinction between evidence of external influences on the juryâ€™s\r\n  deliberations and comments of jurors occurring during deliberations.Â  While the\r\n  rule allows evidence of the former to be introduced, it prohibits the\r\n  introduction of the latter.\r\nAlthough Rule 606\r\n  expressly prohibits the introduction of juror testimony regarding both the\r\n  content and the effect of statements occurring during the juryâ€™s deliberations,\r\n  this Court has recognized an exception to that categorical prohibition.Â  In State\r\n    v. Hunter, this Court held that juror testimony involving internal\r\n  misconduct may be received only when necessary to ensure fundamental fairness.Â \r\n  320 S.C. 85, 88, 463 S.E.2d 314, 316 (1995).Â  That case involved\r\n  allegations by a juror that the verdict was tainted by racial prejudice, and\r\n  this Court affirmed the rule announced in Hunter in the later case State\r\n    v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 509 S.E.2d 811 (1999), which involved allegations\r\n  that the jury began deliberations prematurely.Â  The Court has instructed that a\r\n  defendant must demonstrate prejudice from jury misconduct in order to be\r\n  entitled to a new trial.Â  Id. at 314, 509 S.E.2d 814.[1]\r\nTurning\r\n  the focus to an analysis of the affidavit offered in the instant case, we find\r\n  that it was not necessary that the PCR court admit the affidavit in order to\r\n  ensure fundamental fairness.Â  Though the affidavit is significantly longer than\r\n  this summary, the affidavit essentially provides that the juror recalls â€œa\r\n  couple of people, maybe moreâ€ remarking that if Petitioner was not guilty he\r\n  would have taken the stand or presented a defense; that the juror does not\r\n  recall anyone mentioning the trial courtâ€™s instructions not to consider\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s decision not to testify; that if the juror had it to do over\r\n  again, he would cast his initial vote to acquit; that the juror thinks other jurors\r\n  changed their vote because of the comments; and that the juror believes the\r\n  jury made the wrong decision and â€œthink[s] [he] let those comments . . . swing\r\n  [his] vote.â€Â  Although this Court has not articulated precise guideposts for\r\n  judging whether proffered juror testimony raises sufficient questions of\r\n  fundamental fairness so as to be admissible, a return to our precedent is\r\n  instructive.\r\nState\r\n  v. Hunter, the seminal case from this\r\n  Court on the issue of juror testimony regarding statements and conduct during\r\n  the deliberative process, involved a jurorâ€™s allegations that she was coerced\r\n  through racial intimidation to cast her vote one way.Â  We held â€œ[i]f a juror\r\n  claims prejudice played a role in determining the guilt or innocence of a\r\n  defendant, investigation into the matter is necessary.â€Â  320 S.C. at 88, 463\r\n  S.E.2d at 316.Â  â€œTo hold otherwise,â€ we stated, â€œwould violate â€˜the plainest\r\n  principles of justice.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  The case McDonald v. Pless, a\r\n  federal decision, similarly recognizes the potential for â€œinstances in which\r\n  [juror testimony] could not be excluded without violating the plainest\r\n  principles of justice.â€Â  238 U.S. 264, 268-69 (1915) (internal quotation marks\r\n  omitted).Â  This Court relied on McDonald in announcing the limited\r\n  exception to the exclusion of juror testimony regarding deliberations, see\r\n    Hunter, 320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316, and other federal precedent\r\n  echoes McDonaldâ€™s language that juror testimony must raise significant\r\n  questions of substantial injustice in order to be admissible.Â  See, e.g.,\r\n    Downey v. Peyton, 451 F.2d 236, 239-40 (4th Cir. 1971) (describing evidence\r\n  that the juryâ€™s verdict was based on certain extrinsic information as creating\r\n  such a probability of prejudice that the verdict was deemed inherently lacking\r\n  in due process).\r\nUsing\r\n  this jurisprudence as a guide, it is clear, in our view, that this affidavit\r\n  does not measure up to the high bar that precedent sets for the seriousness of\r\n  allegations that juror testimony must raise before it may be admitted.Â  We\r\n  think it is plain that the portion of the affidavit pertaining to what may have\r\n  confused other jurors or influenced their votes is pure speculation presented\r\n  without any specific factual support, and the jurorâ€™s testimony about his own\r\n  deliberative process is similarly flawed.Â  The generic assertion that a juror\r\n  would vote the opposite way if given another opportunity too closely resembles\r\n  a case of buyerâ€™s remorse from a guilty verdict to be given much credence. Â Moreover,\r\n  although the juror avers that if he had the preliminary vote to do over again,\r\n  he would cast an initial vote to acquit, this testimony does not relate to the\r\n  jurorâ€™s ultimate vote of guilty.Â  The jury returned a unanimous verdict, and\r\n  the trial court polled the jury after it returned a verdict.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  analysis should not be interpreted as suggesting that more concrete and\r\n  factually specific allegations regarding a juryâ€™s consideration of a\r\n  defendantâ€™s failure to testify might not raise such significant questions that\r\n  it is necessary to admit the testimony in order to ensure fundamental\r\n  fairness.Â  In this vein, it is important to point out a subtle flaw in\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s argument.Â  Petitioner argues that the question presented in the\r\n  instant case is whether consideration of a defendantâ€™s failure to testify can\r\n  potentially implicate fundamental fairness.Â  We disagree.Â  The question we\r\n  address here is whether the affidavit offered in the instant case suggests that\r\n  the conduct of Petitionerâ€™s jury rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.Â \r\n  Because the affidavit at issue does not suggest that Petitionerâ€™s trial was\r\n  fundamentally unfair, we affirm the PCR courtâ€™s decision excluding the jurorâ€™s\r\n  affidavit.[2]\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe occurrence of a\r\n  significant degree of jury misconduct calling for the admission of juror\r\n  testimony has proved to be quite rare.Â  See State v. Pittman, 373 S.C.\r\n  at 554-55, 647 S.E.2d at 158 (suggesting that the mine-run of prejudicial jury\r\n  misconduct cases involve internal coercion based on race or gender bias).Â  For\r\n  this reason, we think trial courts are justified in exercising a degree of caution\r\n  before entertaining such evidence in an attack on a juryâ€™s verdict.Â  As the\r\n  court stated in McDonald:\r\n\r\n\tBut let it once be established that verdicts solemnly made and\r\n  publicly returned into court can be attacked and set aside on the testimony of\r\n  those who took part in their publication and all verdicts could be, and many\r\n  would be, followed by an inquiry in the hope of discovering something which\r\n  might vindicate the finding.Â  Jurors would be harassed and beset by the\r\n  defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might\r\n  establish misconduct . . . [and] the result would be to make what was intended\r\n  to be a private deliberation the constant subject of public investigation.Â  . .\r\n  . [T]he argument in favor of receiving such evidence is not only very strong,\r\n  but unanswerable-when looked at solely from the standpoint of the private party\r\n  who has been wronged by such misconduct. Â The argument, however, has not been\r\n  sufficiently convincing to induce legislatures generally to repeal or to modify\r\n  the rule. Â For, while it may often exclude the only possible evidence of\r\n  misconduct, a change in the rule would open the door to the most pernicious arts and\r\n  tampering with jurors. Â The practice would be replete with dangerous\r\n  consequences. Â It would lead to the grossest fraud and abuse and no verdict\r\n  would be safe.\r\n\r\n238 U.S. at 267-68.Â  With these principles in mind, we affirm\r\n  the PCR courtâ€™s denial of relief.\r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Both of these cases were direct appeals from criminal convictions.Â  The\r\n  parties to the instant case did not argue that the rules for the introduction\r\n  of juror testimony and the standard for a grant of post-conviction relief based\r\n  on internal jury misconduct differ from the standard applicable on direct\r\n  appeal.Â  We therefore assume, but do not decide, that the analysis outlined in\r\n  our direct appeal precedent applies.Â  \r\n[2] As a housekeeping matter, it is important to note that even if circumstances\r\n  called for the admission of the affidavit, we have held that a defendant must\r\n  demonstrate prejudice from jury misconduct in order to be entitled to a new\r\n  trial.Â  See Aldret, 333 S.C. at 314, 509 S.E.2d at 814.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26484","title":"McKnight v.

Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85 (2003).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  public defender for Horry County represented McKnight in each of two trials for\r\n  homicide by child abuse.Â  The first trial in January 2001 ended in a mistrial.Â \r\n  At the second trial in May 2001, a jury convicted McKnight of homicide by child\r\n  abuse.Â  This Court affirmed the juryâ€™s verdict on direct appeal.Â  See State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 576 S.E.2d 168 (2003).Â  \r\nMcKnight\r\n  filed a petition for PCR alleging ineffective assistance of counsel on numerous\r\n  grounds.Â  The PCR court held that counsel was not ineffective and denied\r\n  McKnight relief as to each of her claims.Â  This Court granted certiorari to\r\n  review the PCR courtâ€™s decision, and McKnight raises the following issues for\r\n  review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the PCR court err in\r\n  determining that counsel was not ineffective for failing to prepare an adequate\r\n  defense?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the PCR court err in\r\n  determining that counsel was not ineffective in failing to ensure the trial\r\n  court gave proper jury instructions?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the PCR court err in\r\n  determining that counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to dismiss the\r\n  charges on the grounds that the disparity between the sentences for criminal\r\n  abortion and homicide by child abuse violates the Equal Protection Clause?Â \r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the PCR court err in\r\n  determining that counsel was not ineffective in failing to introduce the\r\n  autopsy report into evidence?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV.\r\n\t\t\tDid the PCR court err in\r\n  determining counsel was not ineffective in failing to argue the issue of intent\r\n  during the closing argument?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the PCR court err in excluding\r\n  expert testimony on the standards of practice for South Carolina defense\r\n  lawyers?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of review\r\nIn\r\n  order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR\r\n  applicant must prove:Â  (1) counsel failed to render reasonably effective\r\n  assistance under prevailing professional norms; and (2) counselâ€™s deficient\r\n  performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 442,\r\n  334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  In reviewing the PCR courtâ€™s decision, this Court\r\n  is concerned only with whether any evidence of probative value exists to\r\n  support the decision.Â  State v. Smith, 369 S.C. 135, 138, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  260, 261 (2006).Â  If no probative evidence exists to support the PCR courtâ€™s findings,\r\n  this Court will reverse.&nbsp; Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Failure to prepare an\r\n  adequate defense\r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that counsel was ineffective in her preparation of McKnightâ€™s defense\r\n  through expert testimony and cross-examination.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  analysis of this issue begins with a summary of the partiesâ€™ strategies at the\r\n  first trial.Â  At this trial, the State tendered Dr. Edward Proctor, the\r\n  pathologist who performed the autopsy, to opine as to the cause of death.Â \r\n  Consistent with his autopsy report, Dr. Proctor testified that the\r\n  chorioamnionitis and the funisitis in conjunction with cocaine caused the fetus\r\n  to die.Â  The doctor said that he based his finding of cocaine on the presence\r\n  of the cocaine metabolite BZE in the fetus and attributed his failure to\r\n  otherwise find any of the typical physiological effects of cocaine on the\r\n  fetusâ€™s central nervous system to post-mortem decomposition.Â  Although Dr.\r\n  Proctor made general statements on the lethal effects of maternal cocaine\r\n  consumption on fetuses, he also admitted it was possible for chorioamnionitis\r\n  or funisitis alone to have caused the death of McKnightâ€™s fetus.Â  Dr. Brett\r\n  Woodard, an expert in pediatric pathology and the Stateâ€™s second witness on the\r\n  issue, testified that by ruling out other possible causes of death, including\r\n  syphilis,[1] thyroid problems, or other substance use, it was his opinion that McKnightâ€™s\r\n  cocaine use alone caused the chorioamnionitis and funisitis in the fetus which\r\n  resulted in fetal death.Â  Dr. Woodard further based his conclusions on studies\r\n  to which he extensively cited for their conclusions on the harmful effects of\r\n  cocaine in utero.\r\nCounsel\r\n  for McKnight called two expert witnesses to testify as to possible alternative\r\n  causes of death.Â  Dr. Steven Karch, a cardiac pathologist and expert in\r\n  drug-related deaths, opined that although he could not determine the underlying\r\n  cause of the chorioamnionitis and funisitis found in the fetus, these\r\n  conditions alone were responsible for its death.Â  Dr. Karch explained that in\r\n  the absence of pure-form cocaine in the fetus, the only conclusion he could\r\n  make from the presence of BZE was that the mother was a cocaine user.Â  The\r\n  doctor additionally testified that it was impossible to rule out syphilis as a\r\n  cause of death.\r\nDr.\r\n  Karch also rebutted the Stateâ€™s expertsâ€™ testimony on the harmful effects of\r\n  cocaine and the notion of â€œcrack babiesâ€ by explaining at great length that\r\n  although cocaine is a potentially dangerous drug, it is not as dangerous as the\r\n  medical community once believed.Â  Dr. Karch went on to describe recent studies\r\n  which had been unable to conclusively link cocaine to stillbirth, and discussed\r\n  the flaws in earlier studies that had shown otherwise.[2]Â \r\n  The doctor further cited this research to supplement his explanation as to why\r\n  particular natural causes could not be ruled out as having caused fetal death. \r\nCounsel\r\n  for McKnight also called Dr. Sandra Conradi, a pathologist at MUSC, to testify\r\n  on the cause of death.Â  Similar to Dr. Karch, Dr. Conradi rebutted the Stateâ€™s\r\n  testimony on the harmful effects of cocaine by pointing to a published medical\r\n  study showing fetal exposure to levels of cocaine even higher than McKnightâ€™s\r\n  fetus was no more likely to give rise to an adverse pregnancy than exposure to\r\n  other harmful conditions.Â  Dr. Conradi also stated that she would have ruled\r\n  the cause of death â€œundetermined,â€ rather than a homicide.Â  However, upon\r\n  further questioning, the doctor eliminated all potential natural causes of\r\n  death, testifying that it was â€œunlikely, but possibleâ€ that the\r\n  chorioamnionitis and funisitis led to stillbirth and that her tests for\r\n  syphilis were negative.Â  On the other hand, Dr. Conradi testified that she could\r\n  not rule out cocaine as a cause of death.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  its closing argument at the first trial, the State initially focused on the\r\n  testimony of its expert, Dr. Woodard, the sole expert to testify that cocaine\r\n  alone caused the fetal demise.Â  The State concentrated the remainder of its\r\n  closing argument on Dr. Conradiâ€™s testimony, repeatedly emphasizing that\r\n  McKnightâ€™s own expert had eliminated all potential causes of death except\r\n  exposure to cocaine.Â  The jury deliberated for over seven hours without\r\n  reaching a verdict and was sent home for the night.Â  The next morning, upon\r\n  learning that several jurors had researched medical issues related to the case\r\n  on the internet overnight, the trial court declared a mistrial.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the second trial in May 2001, the State again called Dr. Proctor and Dr.\r\n  Woodard[3] to testify to their belief that cocaine caused baby McKnightâ€™s stillbirth.Â \r\n  Counsel for McKnight did not call Dr. Karch back to testify and only called Dr.\r\n  Conradi, who again testified that although she could not precisely determine\r\n  the cause of death, neither chorioamnionitis, funisitis, nor syphilis caused\r\n  the fetus to die.Â  Counsel did not examine Dr. Conradi on the published study favorable\r\n  to McKnightâ€™s defense that the doctor had mentioned at the first trial.Â \r\n  Furthermore, counsel did not call any other expert to rebut or discredit the\r\n  medical studies cited by the Stateâ€™s experts as Dr. Karch had done previously,\r\n  nor did counsel cross-examine the Stateâ€™s experts on the matter. \r\nAs\r\n  in the closing arguments of the first trial, the State began by pointing out\r\n  Dr. Conradiâ€™s failure to eliminate cocaine as a cause of fetal demise and\r\n  declared that in conjunction with the testimony of Dr. Woodard, Dr. Conradi\r\n  â€œreally helped us out in figuring out the cause of death in this particular\r\n  caseâ€ by eliminating all other relevant causes of death.Â Â  The jury returned a\r\n  guilty verdict in thirty minutes.\r\n\r\na.&nbsp; Expert witnesses\r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that counsel was ineffective in calling an expert witness whose\r\n  testimony undermined the defense and in failing to call an expert witness whose\r\n  testimony supported the defense.Â  We agree. \r\nThere\r\n  is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised\r\n  reasonable&nbsp;professional judgment in making all significant decisions in a\r\n  case.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000).Â \r\n  Where trial counsel articulates a valid reason for employing certain trial\r\n  strategy, counsel will not be deemed ineffective.Â  Roseboro v. State, 317\r\n  S.C. 292, 294, 454 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1995).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, upon learning that an extended trip abroad would prevent Dr.\r\n  Karch from testifying at the second trial, counsel stated at the PCR hearing\r\n  that she believed at the time of trial that Dr. Conradiâ€™s testimony alone would\r\n  be sufficient.Â  Specifically, counsel testified that at trial, she focused\r\n  solely on the issue of whether cocaine caused the stillbirth, and therefore,\r\n  determined that Dr. Conradiâ€™s testimony - which never pinned the death on\r\n  cocaine, but rather, labeled the cause of death as â€œundeterminedâ€ in the\r\n  absence of pure-form cocaine in the fetus - supported the defenseâ€™s theory.Â \r\n  For this reason, counsel testified that she never thought to request a\r\n  continuance or elicit Dr. Karchâ€™s testimony via videotape as the State had with\r\n  Dr. Woodard.Â  Counsel also admitted that due to her case load, she did not have\r\n  time to find another expert who could, as Dr. Karch did, effectively rule out\r\n  cocaine as the cause of death.[4]Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find that it was unreasonable for counsel to produce a single expert witness at\r\n  the second trial whose testimony had clearly benefitted the Stateâ€™s case in the\r\n  first trial, and that her reasons for doing so do not qualify as a valid trial\r\n  strategy.[5]Â \r\n  Counselâ€™s case files from the first trial no doubt indicated that the State had\r\n  based its theory of the case on McKnightâ€™s history of cocaine use and being\r\n  able to rule out all other potential causes of death.Â  Counsel was also\r\n  certainly aware that Dr. Conradiâ€™s process of ruling out all other potential\r\n  natural causes of death to arrive at an opinion on the actual cause of death\r\n  mimicked that of the Stateâ€™s expert Dr. Woodard.Â  Although Dr. Conradi\r\n  ultimately concluded that the cause of death was indeterminable while Dr.\r\n  Woodard concluded that cocaine caused fetal demise, counsel was certainly\r\n  cognizant of the fact that the Stateâ€™s closing argument at the first trial used\r\n  these expertsâ€™ similar methods of analysis to its advantage.Â  From this,\r\n  counsel should have reasonably concluded that regardless of Dr. Conradiâ€™s\r\n  ultimate conclusion, her testimony went to the heart of the Stateâ€™s case, and\r\n  that substitute and/or additional testimony was needed.Â  See State v. Ingle,\r\n  348 S.C. 467, 560 S.E.2d 401 (2002) (finding ineffective assistance of counsel\r\n  where defense counsel called a witness whose testimony contradicted the\r\n  defenseâ€™s theory of the case).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Petitioner showed that even if Dr. Karch was unavailable, another expert was\r\n  available to testify that cocaine did not cause the stillbirth.Â  Dr. Kimberly\r\n  Collins, head of forensic pathology at MUSC and an expert witness in numerous\r\n  cases, testified at the PCR hearing that she agreed with Dr. Karchâ€™s view of\r\n  the evidence and would have testified on behalf of McKnight at the second trial\r\n  had she been contacted by counsel.Â  This Court has recognized that strategic\r\n  choices made by counsel after an incomplete investigation are reasonable â€œonly\r\n  to the extent that reasonable professional judgment supports the limitations on\r\n  the investigation.â€Â  See Von Dohlen v. State, 360 S.C. 598, 607, 602\r\n  S.E.2d 738, 743 (2004) (quoting Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 533 (2003)).Â  Although we accept counselâ€™s assertion that she was pressed for\r\n  time in preparing for the second trial, in light of counselâ€™s familiarity with\r\n  the first trial and the relative ease with which counsel could have procured favorable\r\n  expert testimony at the second trial, we conclude that counselâ€™s decision to\r\n  call Dr. Conradi alone to testify at the second trial was unreasonable.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  further find that there is a reasonable probability that this deficiency\r\n  prejudiced McKnight.Â  The methodology used by the only expert witness\r\n  for the defense in determining the cause of fetal death mimicked that of the\r\n  Stateâ€™s star expert and, in this way, Dr. Conradiâ€™s testimony primarily served\r\n  to bolster the Stateâ€™s theory of the case excluding all other potential causes\r\n  of death in order to conclude that cocaine caused the stillbirth.Â  In this\r\n  regard, the Courtâ€™s own review of the case on direct appeal shows that\r\n  counselâ€™s deficient performance was in fact prejudicial.Â  On appeal, this Court\r\n  upheld the jury verdict on numerous grounds, including that sufficient evidence\r\n  existed to show that cocaine caused fetal demise.Â  In reaching this conclusion,\r\n  the Court emphasized Dr. Woodardâ€™s testimony ruling out other natural causes of\r\n  death and pointed out that â€œMcKnightâ€™s expert . . . also ruled out the\r\n  possibility of choriamnionitis, funisitis or syphilis as the cause of death.â€Â  McKnight,\r\n  352 S.C. at 643-44, 576 S.E.2d at 172.Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  our opinion, counselâ€™s two-fold error in calling an expert witness whose\r\n  testimony was known to have previously been used to bolster the Stateâ€™s case, while\r\n  neglecting to elicit favorable testimony from other experts when such testimony\r\n  was known to exist and readily available, represents counselâ€™s inadequate\r\n  preparation for trial rather than a valid trial strategy.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  that counselâ€™s performance in this regard was deficient.Â  Because we further\r\n  find that this deficient performance prejudiced McKnightâ€™s case, we hold that\r\n  the PCR court erred in determining that counsel was not ineffective on these\r\n  grounds.\r\nb.&nbsp; Failure to investigate\r\nMcKnight\r\n  also argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate medical\r\n  evidence contradicting the Stateâ€™s expertsâ€™ testimony on the link between\r\n  cocaine and stillbirth, and in further failing to investigate methods to\r\n  challenge Dr. Woodardâ€™s conclusions ruling out natural causes of death.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nA\r\n  criminal defense attorney has the duty to conduct a reasonable investigation to\r\n  discover all reasonably available mitigation evidence and all reasonably\r\n  available evidence tending to rebut any aggravating evidence introduced by the\r\n  State.Â  Nance v. Ozmint, 367 S.C. 547, 557 n.8, 626 S.E.2d 878, 883 n.8\r\n  (2006) (quoting Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524-25).Â Â  In this case, counsel\r\n  testified that her failure to rebut the medical research cited by the Stateâ€™s\r\n  experts, as well as the Stateâ€™s expertâ€™s own methods in arriving at those\r\n  conclusions - either through the defenseâ€™s own expert testimony or with a\r\n  thorough cross-examination - was due to her belief that Dr. Conradiâ€™s testimony\r\n  alone was adequate and that she did not otherwise have time to interview\r\n  additional experts.Â  Counsel, however, did not attempt to rebut the medical\r\n  studies she knew the Stateâ€™s experts would cite, nor did she examine Dr.\r\n  Conradi on the study the doctor cited at the first trial that concluded cocaine\r\n  is no more harmful to fetuses than other adverse factors during pregnancy.Â  In\r\n  light of counselâ€™s thorough investigation and examination of witnesses at the\r\n  first trial, counsel, in our view, was deficient in failing to conduct a\r\n  reasonable investigation which resulted in a substantially weaker defense at\r\n  the second trial.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  in the absence of testimony from the defense on medical research to the\r\n  contrary, there is a reasonable probability that the jury used the adverse and\r\n  apparently outdated scientific studies propounded by the Stateâ€™s witnesses to\r\n  find additional support for the Stateâ€™s expertsâ€™ conclusions that cocaine\r\n  caused the death of the fetus.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the PCR court erred\r\n  in determining that counsel was not ineffective on these grounds \r\nII.&nbsp; Jury instructions\r\na.&nbsp; Criminal intent under the\r\n  Homicide by Child Abuse statute\r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  charge on the measure of criminal intent required for conviction under the\r\n  Homicide by Child Abuse (HCA) statute.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(a)(1) (2003), a person is guilty of homicide by child\r\n  abuse if the person causes the death of a child â€œwhile committing child abuse\r\n  or neglect, and the death occurs under circumstances manifesting an extreme\r\n  indifference to human life.â€Â  At trial, the trial court began by instructing\r\n  the jury, in accordance with the HCA statute, that the State must prove beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt that â€œdeath occurred in circumstances showing extreme\r\n  indifference to human life.â€Â  The court continued with the general charge on\r\n  criminal intent from the Circuit Court Bench Book.Â  Specifically, the court\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tIn any\r\n  case in order to establish criminal liability criminal intent is required.Â  For\r\n  example, the mental state required to be proven by the State for a part[icular]\r\n  [sic] crime might be purpose, intent, knowledge, recklessness, or criminal\r\n  negligence. . . .Â  Criminal intent is a mental state, a conscious wrongdoing.Â \r\n  It is up to you to determine what the defendant intended to do based on the\r\n  circumstances shown to have existed.Â  Criminal intent can arise from actions or\r\n  failure to act.Â  It may arise from negligence, recklessness or indifference to\r\n  duty or consequences therefore.Â  It is considered by law to be the equivalent\r\n  of criminal intent.Â Â  \r\n\r\nTen\r\n  minutes after dismissing the jury for deliberations, the jury asked, â€œCan we\r\n  have a definition of criminal intent?Â  If we do have to confirm criminal\r\n  intent?â€Â  The court then recharged the jury, again using the general charge on\r\n  criminal intent.Â  Counsel for McKnight did not object to either the primary\r\n  charge or the supplemental charge.Â Â Â  \r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that trial court improperly charged the jury that it could convict if it\r\n  found negligence, recklessness, or mere indifference when a conviction for\r\n  homicide by child abuse requires a finding of extreme indifference to human\r\n  life.Â  For purposes of the HCA statute, â€œextreme indifferenceâ€ has been defined\r\n  as â€œa mental state akin to intent characterized by a deliberate act culminating\r\n  in death.â€Â  State v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 98, 564 S.E.2d 362, 367 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002).Â  In a similar vein, this Court has held that â€œreckless disregard\r\n  for the safety of othersâ€ in reckless homicide cases is â€œa conscious&nbsp;failure\r\n  to exercise due care or ordinary care or a conscious indifference to the rights\r\n  and safety of others or a reckless disregard thereof.â€Â  State v. Tucker,\r\n  273 S.C. 736, 739, 259 S.E.2d 414, 415 (1979).Â  Accordingly, the specification\r\n  of the mens rea in the HCA statute in conjunction with the general\r\n  charge on criminal intent was proper and counsel was not deficient in failing\r\n  to object to the primary charge. \r\nHowever,\r\n  the propriety of using the general criminal intent charge alone in the\r\n  supplemental charge is not so clear.Â  The foremanâ€™s note appears to question\r\n  what specific level of criminal intent was required to find McKnight guilty,\r\n  indicating that the jury was confused on this point.Â  Although the references\r\n  in the criminal intent charge to recklessness and indifference are consistent\r\n  with this Courtâ€™s HCA jurisprudence regarding the meaning of â€œextreme\r\n  indifference to human life,â€ we believe that the trial courtâ€™s recitation of\r\n  the general criminal intent charge alone in response to the juryâ€™s inquiry only\r\n  served to further confuse the jury by referencing mere negligence and otherwise\r\n  failing to clarify the particular mental state required for a conviction of\r\n  homicide by child abuse.Â  See State v. Blurton, 352 S.C. 203, 208, 573\r\n  S.E.2d 802, 804 (2002) (â€œInstructions that do not fit the facts of the case may\r\n  serve only to confuse the jury.â€) and State v. Rothell, 301 S.C. 168,\r\n  169-70, 391 S.E.2d 228, 229 (1990) (â€œIt is error to give instructions which may\r\n  confuse or mislead the jury.â€).Â  Accordingly, we find that counsel was\r\n  deficient in failing to object to the supplemental charge.\r\nFurthermore, because the\r\n  erroneous charge occurred in a supplemental instruction and likely attained a\r\n  special significance in the minds of the jurors, there is a reasonable probability\r\n  that counselâ€™s deficient performance prejudiced McKnight.Â  See Lowry v.\r\n    State, 376 S.C. 499, 657 S.E.2d 760 (2008) (acknowledging the prominence of\r\n  an erroneous charge when it arises in a supplemental instruction).Â  That the\r\n  jury returned a guilty verdict five minutes after the trial court issued the\r\n  supplemental charge indicates that counselâ€™s failure to object to the erroneous\r\n  charge was prejudicial in fact.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the PCR court erred\r\n  in determining that counsel was not ineffective on these grounds.\r\n\r\nb.&nbsp; Burden\r\n  of proving an alternative cause of death\r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to request that the jury be\r\n  instructed that the defense did not have the burden to prove an alternative\r\n  cause of death.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis\r\n  Court has never addressed whether a defendant is entitled, upon request, to a\r\n  charge that the defense has no burden of proving an alternative cause of death,\r\n  and McKnight appears to argue that the Court should adopt a rule similar to\r\n  that applicable to the affirmative defense of self-defense.Â  When self-defense\r\n  is at issue in a case, the defendant, upon request, is entitled to a charge\r\n  that the State has the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.Â  State v. Addison, 343 S.C. 290, 294, 540 S.E.2d 449, 451\r\n  (2000).Â  Numerous other jurisdictions ascribe to this rule and the Fourth\r\n  Circuit has commented that â€œjury instructions regarding self-defense pose a\r\n  delicate problem requiring extraordinary caution because the defense admits the\r\n  accused committed the act but seeks to establish justification or excuse. This\r\n  is especially true where self-defense is the only defense alleged at trial.â€Â  Guthrie\r\n    v. Warden, 683 F.2d 820, 825 n.7 (4th Cir. 1982) (citing United States\r\n      v. Corrigan, 548 F.2d 879 (10th Cir. 1977)). \r\nThis\r\n  Court has articulated that the primary reason for entitling a defendant to a\r\n  self-defense charge upon request in South Carolina is because at one time in\r\n  our jurisprudence, self-defense was an affirmative defense which the defendant\r\n  was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  See Addison, 343 S.C.\r\n  at 293, 540 S.E.2d at 451.Â  Requesting a self-defense charge on the Stateâ€™s\r\n  burden of proof therefore ensures that the jury does not proceed on the\r\n  outdated theory of self-defense as an affirmative defense.Â  Because asserting\r\n  an alternative theory of death is not, and never has been, an affirmative\r\n  defense required to be proven by the defendant, we find no similar entitlement\r\n  to such charge, and therefore, counselâ€™s failure to request such was not\r\n  unreasonable.Â  \r\nNor\r\n  could this Court find that the theoretical concerns underlying a self-defense\r\n  charge outlined in Guthrie are of equal concern where a defendant\r\n  asserts an alternative theory of death.Â  For instance, in this particular case,\r\n  McKnight only admits to child abuse (using cocaine while pregnant).Â  She\r\n  affirmatively denies the crime of homicide by child abuse for which she is\r\n  being tried by asserting alternative theories (natural causes) for the cause of\r\n  the fetusâ€™s death.Â  We find the Guthrie rationale for a self-defense\r\n  charge request is not at issue when a defendant asserts an alternative theory\r\n  of death because the defendant in such cases is not seeking justification or an\r\n  excuse for committing the crime for which they are being tried; rather, the\r\n  defendant is saying he or she is innocent.\r\nEven\r\n  if this Court were to find McKnight was entitled to such a charge upon request,\r\n  counselâ€™s failure to request the charge must still be evaluated for prejudicial\r\n  effect.Â  In this case, the trial courtâ€™s instructions referenced the Stateâ€™s\r\n  burden to prove McKnight guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on numerous\r\n  occasions, and reiterated that McKnight was â€œnot required to prove herself\r\n  innocent.â€ When read as a whole, the instructions adequately conveyed the\r\n  Stateâ€™s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the corresponding absence\r\n  of any such burden for McKnight.[6]Â  See State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 263, 565 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2002)\r\n  (noting that failure to give requested jury instructions is not prejudicial\r\n  error where the instructions given, on the whole, adequately cover the law).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold that the PCR court correctly found that counsel was not\r\n  ineffective on these grounds.\r\n\r\nc.&nbsp; Involuntary\r\n  manslaughter as a lesser included offense\r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to request a jury charge on\r\n  involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of homicide by child\r\n  abuse.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§16-3-85 (2003) provides that a person is guilty of homicide by child\r\n  abuse if the person â€œcauses the death of a child under the age of eleven while\r\n  committing child abuse or neglect . . . under circumstances manifesting an\r\n  extreme indifference to human life.â€Â  Involuntary manslaughter is defined as\r\n  (1) the unintentional killing of another without malice, but while engaged in\r\n  an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm;\r\n  or (2) the unintentional killing of another without malice, while engaged in a\r\n  lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety of others.Â  State v.\r\n    Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 571, 647 S.E.2d 144, 167 (2007).\r\nThe\r\n  test for determining when an offense is a lesser included offense of another\r\n  offense is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the elements of\r\n  the lesser offense.Â  State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 215, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  873, 877 (2007).Â  If the lesser offense contains an element which is not\r\n  included in the greater offense, it is not a lesser included offense of the\r\n  greater offense.Â  Id.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the elements test, the court of appeals determined in State v. Mitchell,\r\n  362 S.C. 289, 608 S.E.2d 140 (Ct. App. 2005), that involuntary manslaughter is\r\n  not a lesser included offense of homicide by child abuse.Â  Although we disagree\r\n  with the court of appealsâ€™ application of the elements test in Mitchell,\r\n  and would accordingly vacate that portion of the opinion, we still find that\r\n  under the elements test, involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser included\r\n  offense of homicide by child abuse.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  and as the court of appeals correctly reasoned, only the â€œunlawful activityâ€\r\n  definition of involuntary manslaughter could potentially apply in the arena of\r\n  child abuse because child abuse is an unlawful act.Â  However, child abuse could\r\n  never be defined as an unlawful activity â€œnot tending to cause death or great\r\n  bodily harm,â€ and for this reason, the elements of involuntary manslaughter will\r\n  never be included in the greater offense of homicide by child abuse.\r\nBecause\r\n  involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser included offense of homicide by child\r\n  abuse, we hold that the PCR court correctly determined that counsel was not\r\n  ineffective for failing to request a jury charge on involuntary manslaughter.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Equal protection\r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to move to dismiss the charges\r\n  on the grounds that the disparity between the sentences for criminal abortion\r\n  and homicide by child abuse violates the Equal Protection Clause.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  criminal abortion statute provisions relevant to this case provide that any\r\n  woman who intentionally procures an illegal abortion will be guilty of a\r\n  misdemeanor and upon conviction, may be imprisoned for no more than two years.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-41-80(b) (2002).Â  The relevant HCA statute provisions state\r\n  that a person who causes the death of a child under age eleven while committing\r\n  child abuse or neglect under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to\r\n  human life may be imprisoned for life, and for no less than a term of twenty\r\n  years.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85 (a)(1) &amp; (c)(1).\r\nThe\r\n  Equal Protection Clause provides that no State shall deny to any person within\r\n  its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.Â  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§\r\n  1.Â  A classification does not violate the Equal Protection Clause if (1)\r\n  â€œsimilarly situatedâ€ members in a class are treated alike; (2) the\r\n  classification rests on some reasonable basis; and (3) the classification bears\r\n  a reasonable relation to a legitimate legislative purpose.Â  See Ed Robinson\r\n    Laundry &amp; Dry Cleaning, Inc. v. S.C. Dept. of Revenue, 356 S.C. 120,\r\n  124, 588 S.E.2d 97, 99 (2003).Â  \r\nIn our opinion, the PCR court\r\n  correctly determined that McKnight has no equal protection claim in the first\r\n  instance because she is not similarly situated to individuals prosecuted under\r\n  the criminal abortion statute.Â  See id. (rejecting an equal protection\r\n  claim for failure to show disparate treatment of similarly situated entities in\r\n  the first instance).Â  McKnight never argued that she intended to cause an\r\n  abortion through her cocaine use, and therefore, her circumstances are\r\n  different than those who possess the requisite intent to abort a fetus under\r\n  the criminal abortion statute. \r\nNext, even if this Court were\r\n  to consider child abusers similarly situated to illegal abortion seekers, the\r\n  determination of whether a classification is reasonable is initially one for\r\n  the legislative body and will be sustained if it is not plainly arbitrary and\r\n  there is a reasonable hypothesis to support it.Â  Curtis v. State, 345\r\n  S.C. 557, 574, 549 S.E.2d 591, 600 (2001).Â  Here, the abortion statute does not criminalize all abortions, but\r\n  rather, only illegal abortions, i.e., those that do not conform to the criteria\r\n  in the statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-41-20 (2002).Â  The HCA, on the\r\n  other hand, criminalizes homicide as a result of any and all abuse of children\r\n  between viability and age eleven.Â  In our opinion, there is nothing arbitrary\r\n  or unreasonable in establishing different sentences for offenders of distinct\r\n  crimes.Â  See also Davis v. County of Greenville, 313 S.C. 459, 465, 443\r\n  S.E.2d 383, 386 (1994) (â€œThe fact that the classification may result in some\r\n  inequity does not render it unconstitutional.â€).Â  \r\nFinally, a legislative\r\n  history of the statutes is instructive in analyzing whether there is a\r\n  legitimate legislative purpose for the different sentences.Â  In 1974, the\r\n  General Assembly amended the criminal abortion statute to its current form in\r\n  accordance with the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Roe v. Wade.[7] Â Our jurisprudence on the applicability of South Carolina criminal law to\r\n  viable fetuses, on the other hand, did not substantively develop until the\r\n  1980â€™s and 1990â€™s,[8] and in 1992, nearly twenty years after Roe v. Wade, the General Assembly\r\n  enacted the HCA statute.Â  This time differential between the enactment of the\r\n  two statutes, as well as the placement of the HCA statute in the Crimes and\r\n  Offenses section of the Code in contrast to the placement of the criminal\r\n  abortion statute in the Health section of the Code, reflects the General\r\n  Assemblyâ€™s legitimate interest in the protection of unborn children, separate\r\n  and distinct from its interest in the health of expectant mothers and their own\r\n  unborn children.[9]Â Â  \r\nFor these same reasons, we\r\n  believe that any sentencing differences in the two statutes reflect a valid\r\n  legislative determination for the need to target a specific societal problem.Â  See\r\n    Gary Concrete Products, Inc. v. Riley, 285 S.C. 498, 505, 331 S.E.2d 335,\r\n  339 (1985) (â€œ[T]he judiciary may not sit as a super-legislature to judge the\r\n  wisdom or desirability of legislative\r\n  policy determinations made in areas that neither affect\r\n  fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines.â€ (quoting City of New\r\n    Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297 (1976))).Â  Accordingly, we hold that the PCR\r\n  court correctly determined that counsel was not ineffective in failing to argue\r\n  that the HCA statute violated the Equal Protection Clause.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Autopsy\r\n  report\r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce the autopsy report\r\n  into evidence.Â  We agree.\r\nAfter\r\n  introducing the report at the first trial, counselâ€™s only reason for neglecting\r\n  to introduce the report at the second trial is that she â€œjust forgot.â€Â  The PCR\r\n  court found that this error did not prejudice McKnight because the author of\r\n  the autopsy report testified to its contents, and therefore, the report itself\r\n  would have merely been cumulative evidence.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find that the autopsy was a powerful piece of documentary evidence that was\r\n  crucial to McKnightâ€™s defense because it contradicted the Stateâ€™s theory of the\r\n  case.Â  The Stateâ€™s own expert authored the autopsy report which listed three\r\n  causes of death:Â  chorioamnionitis, funisitis, and cocaine.Â  After McKnightâ€™s\r\n  own expert could not rule out cocaine as a cause of death, the autopsy report\r\n  itself would have served as hard evidence to (1) undermine the conclusion of\r\n  Dr. Woodard, the only expert who opined that cocaine alone caused the fetal\r\n  demise, and (2) remind jurors of the inconsistencies in the Stateâ€™s expertsâ€™\r\n  testimony.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we hold that counselâ€™s failure to introduce the autopsy report\r\n  into evidence was deficient, and that this deficiency, in the absence of\r\n  otherwise helpful testimony from her own expert, was prejudicial to McKnight.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the PCR court erred in determining counsel was not ineffective on\r\n  these grounds.\r\nV.&nbsp; Intent\r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to argue that there was no\r\n  evidence on the record suggesting that McKnight knew that using cocaine risked\r\n  harming her fetusâ€™s life.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777, this Court held that a viable\r\n  fetus was a â€œchildâ€ as used in the child abuse and endangerment statute, S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-50 (1985), and therefore upheld a motherâ€™s conviction under\r\n  the statute for her cocaine use during the third trimester of her pregnancy.Â  We\r\n  noted that â€œ[a]lthough the precise effects of maternal crack use during\r\n  pregnancy are somewhat unclear, it is well documented and within the realm of\r\n  public knowledge that such use can cause serious harm to the viable unborn\r\n  child.â€Â  Id. at 10, 492 S.E.2d at 782.Â  Therefore, this Court concluded\r\n  that Whitnerâ€™s drug use unquestionably violated the child endangerment\r\n  statute.Â  Id. at 11, 492 S.E.2d at 782.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the PCR court sanctioned counselâ€™s performance in this regard based on the\r\n  â€œhighly deferentialâ€ review of counselâ€™s strategic position in delivering\r\n  closing arguments, we find the need to look no further than the prejudice prong\r\n  of the Strickland test in order to resolve the matter.Â  This Court\r\n  correctly acknowledged in Whitner that men of common understanding are\r\n  familiar with the harmful effects of cocaine.Â  Therefore, a reasonable jury\r\n  would certainly not be persuaded by the argument that McKnight did not know\r\n  that her cocaine use posed risks to her unborn child.Â Â  Accordingly, even if\r\n  counsel erred in failing to argue that McKnight did not know using cocaine\r\n  posed risks to her unborn child, this deficient performance was not prejudicial.Â \r\n  Therefore, we hold that the PCR court did not err in determining that counsel\r\n  was not ineffective on these grounds.\r\nVI.&nbsp; Expert\r\n  testimony at the PCR hearing\r\nMcKnight\r\n  argues that the PCR court erred in excluding testimony on the professional\r\n  standards of South Carolina defense lawyers.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  decision to admit affidavits, depositions, oral testimony, or other evidence at\r\n  a PCR hearing is within the PCR courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice to a party.Â  See\r\n    Simpson v. Moore, 367 S.C. 587, 607-08, 627 S.E.2d 701, 712 (2006).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the PCR court rejected McKnightâ€™s proffer of expert testimony\r\n  on the prevailing professional standards for South Carolina defense attorneys\r\n  based on Green v. State, 351 S.C. 184, 569 S.E.2d 318 (2002).Â  In Green,\r\n  this Court reviewed a defendantâ€™s claim that the PCR court erred in excluding\r\n  opinion testimony from a criminal defense attorney as to acceptable legal\r\n  standards of defense practice.Â  Id. at 198, 569 S.E.2d at 325.Â \r\n  Acknowledging that expert testimony designed to assist the PCR court to\r\n  understand certain facts was admissible, the Court found that the expert\r\n  offered no factual evidence, but rather, assumed certain facts in arriving at\r\n  his conclusion that trial counselâ€™s performance was deficient.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the Court held that the PCR court properly excluded the\r\n  testimony because it was merely a legal argument as to how the PCR court should\r\n  rule on the issue.Â  Id.\r\nÂ Turning\r\n  to the instant case, we hold that the PCR court properly excluded the testimony\r\n  of McKnightâ€™s expert.Â  Although McKnight offered the expert to provide factual\r\n  testimony on prevailing professional standards of South Carolina defense\r\n  attorneys, PCR counselâ€™s questions consistently inquired into how a lawyer\r\n  practicing in accordance with the prevailing standards in South Carolina would\r\n  handle certain factual scenarios derived directly from this case.Â  As a result,\r\n  the expertâ€™s opinion, amounted to a case-specific application of the Strickland test that was not designed to assist the PCR court to understand certain facts,\r\n  but rather, was a legal argument as to why the PCR court should rule that\r\n  McKnightâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective.Â  Accordingly, the PCR court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in excluding the expert testimony in the context that the\r\n  testimony was offered.Â Â Â Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  reverse the PCR courtâ€™s denial of relief.\r\nMOORE, WALLER\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring only in result.\r\n[1] Although not listed as a cause of death on the autopsy report, McKnight had a\r\n  history of syphilis, which has been known to result in stillbirth.\r\n[2] This is a very general summary of the expert testimony on the issue and we reiterate\r\n  that neither expert was claiming that cocaine will not harm a fetus.Â  Rather,\r\n  the thrust of the testimony was to emphasize the doctorsâ€™ recognition of recent\r\n  studies showing that cocaine is no more harmful to a fetus than nicotine use,\r\n  poor nutrition, lack of prenatal care, or other conditions commonly associated\r\n  with the urban poor.\r\n[3] Dr. Woodardâ€™s testimony was videotaped prior to trial because he was unable\r\n  appear in person.\r\n[4] Counsel is the public defender for Horry County. She testified that between the\r\n  two McKnight trials, she tried a death penalty case in addition to working on\r\n  about two hundred other cases assigned to the public defenderâ€™s office.Â  \r\n[5] Counsel herself admitted at the PCR hearing that Dr.\r\n  Conradiâ€™s testimony had been harmful to McKnightâ€™s case and that failing to\r\n  call back Dr. Karch, who counsel considered â€œa very effective witness,â€ was\r\n  pure oversight and not a strategic decision on her part. \r\n[6] â€œIntervening causeâ€ instructions have been requested in other jurisdictions to\r\n  address alternative theories of death in child abuse cases.Â  Although no cases\r\n  are directly on point, other courts have held that in the absence of a specific\r\n  charge on intervening causes, a jury instruction that, on the whole, adequately\r\n  conveys the governmentâ€™s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt under the\r\n  applicable criminal statute is not grounds for reversal.Â  See, e.g., State\r\n    v. Delgado, 718\r\n      A.2d 437, 445 (Conn. 2003) (finding a jury charge on\r\n  intervening causes unnecessary in a case involving the death of a child in\r\n  which the evidence suggests a finding of only one proximate cause of harm as contemplated\r\n  by the relevant state manslaughter statute).\r\n[7] 410 U.S. 113 (1973).Â  \r\n[8] See, e.g., State v. Horne, 282 S.C. 444, 319 S.E.2d 703 (1984) (holding\r\n  that a â€œpersonâ€ under the South Carolina murder statute includes viable\r\n  fetuses); Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997) (holding\r\n  that a â€œchildâ€ under the South Carolina child abuse and endangerment statute\r\n  includes viable fetuses).Â  \r\n[9] Legislative interest in the protection of unborn children persists in the\r\n  current 2007-2008 legislative session in a bill which seeks to amend the HCA\r\n  statute to expressly include the ingestion of certain illegal drugs by a mother\r\n  during her pregnancy in the statutory definition of â€œchild abuse or neglect.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26485","title":"In the Matter of Larry M.

Â After a full investigation by the\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and a hearing before the Commission on Judicial\r\n  Conduct Panel (Panel), the Panel recommended the following sanctions: (1)\r\n  public reprimand; (2) respondent be prohibited from seeking or accepting any\r\n  judicial position in South Carolina without the express permission of the\r\n  Supreme Court; and (3) respondent be ordered to pay costs of proceedings.Â  Both\r\n  respondent and ODC object to various findings of the Panel.Â  We agree with the\r\n  Panel and adopt their findings and sanctions.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  became a part-time magistrate in Spartanburg County in 1987 and a full-time\r\n  magistrate in 1995.Â  In January 2003, respondent was reassigned by the Spartanburg   County chief magistrate from respondentâ€™s office at the courthouse to the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s office at the county jail.Â  At the office at the jail, the\r\n  magistrates shared the same desk, and all court employees shared the same\r\n  restroom.Â  Respondent was unhappy with the transfer.\r\nDuring the 2003\r\n  legislative session, the four-year appointments of the Spartanburg magistrate\r\n  judges were pending, and there was a disagreement over several reappointments\r\n  which resulted in a deadlock.Â  As a result, the magistrates were on â€œholdoverâ€\r\n  status as of May 1, 2003.Â  The two complaints leading to this disciplinary\r\n  action occurred around this time.\r\nMatter A\r\nComplainant A worked\r\n  for respondent as a clerk in respondentâ€™s office at the courthouse.Â  When\r\n  respondent was transferred to the jail at the beginning of 2003, Complainant A stayed\r\n  at the courthouse office but remained in regular contact with respondent.\r\nComplainant A\r\n  testified that on May 1, 2003, respondent telephoned her at the courthouse\r\n  office and asked her to stop by his office at the jail when her shift ended.Â \r\n  When Complainant A arrived, respondent asked her how difficult it would be for\r\n  her to get another Spartanburg County magistrate judge over to her apartment.Â  Complainant\r\n  A replied flippantly, believing that respondent was joking in a manner\r\n  consistent with their prior office demeanor.Â  However, according to Complainant\r\n  A, respondent then asked her to â€œgo all the wayâ€ with the other judge, to\r\n  videotape it, and respondent mentioned the availability of small cameras.Â  Complainant\r\n  A stated that when she understood respondent to be serious, she became upset\r\n  and left and subsequently reported the matter to the chief magistrate.\r\nComplainant Aâ€™s\r\n  allegation was initially investigated by local law enforcement and SLED.Â \r\n  Respondent was asked to take a polygraph examination in connection with that\r\n  investigation but agreed to do so only if Complainant A, the judge to which\r\n  respondent referred, and the chief magistrate judge would submit to examination\r\n  as well.Â  SLED did not conduct polygraph tests on any person, and it concluded\r\n  its investigation without any criminal prosecution against respondent.[1]\r\nMatter B\r\nComplainant B was\r\n  the clerk supervisor in the magistrateâ€™s office at the county jail.Â  On May 9,\r\n  2003, respondent called Complainant B to complain about the work performance of\r\n  certain magistrate court clerks.Â  During the conversation, respondent commented\r\n  that one of the clerks was dating â€œniggersâ€ and that there was â€œno telling what\r\n  we might catch using the same bathroom as her.â€Â  Complainant B reported the\r\n  conversation to her supervising magistrate and then to the chief magistrate.Â  Complainant\r\n  B was also instructed by her supervising magistrate to inform the clerk to whom\r\n  respondent allegedly referred, as well as another African-American clerk.Â  One\r\n  of the clerks wrote a letter to the NAACP, which resulted in much adverse\r\n  publicity for respondent and the Spartanburg County magistrateâ€™s office.\r\nBoth Matter A and\r\n  Matter B were reported to the Commission on Judicial Conduct (Commission) and\r\n  were considered by an investigative panel of the Commission.Â  However, those\r\n  matters were dismissed by the investigative panel, but respondent was not\r\n  informed of the reasons for dismissal.Â  \r\nOther relevant facts\r\nIn December 2003,\r\n  respondent e-mailed the chief magistrate requesting a meeting with all the Spartanburg   County magistrate judges to discuss â€œthe clerks that made up stories about me\r\n  since all have been cleared by judicial standards and the SLED investigation.â€Â \r\n  That meeting took place on January 5, 2004.Â  \r\nDuring that\r\n  meeting, several magistrates,[2] including respondent, voiced their concerns and advocated the firing of Complainant\r\n  A, Complainant B, and the clerk who notified the NAACP.Â  The Panel took\r\n  testimony from each of the magistrates present at the meeting, and most of them\r\n  recalled respondent making comments in reference to respondentâ€™s having been\r\n  â€œcleared by judicial standards and the SLED investigation.â€Â  The majority of\r\n  the magistrates also testified that respondent represented in some fashion that\r\n  he had been willing to submit to a polygraph examination but no one else\r\n  involved would take one.Â  Respondent denied making these representations but\r\n  did acknowledge that he presented a copy of the letter reflecting the Attorney Generalâ€™s\r\n  decision not to pursue prosecution of any charges against respondent.Â  After\r\n  some discussion, the magistrates voted unanimously to fire Complainant A and\r\n  the clerk who notified the NAACP; they also voted 6-5 to terminate Complainant\r\n  Bâ€™s employment.Â  These votes were recorded on â€œballotsâ€ prepared before the\r\n  meeting by one of the judges who met with Respondent the week before the\r\n  meeting.\r\nAfter the meeting\r\n  on January 5, 2004, several magistrates talked amongst themselves and reported\r\n  having misgivings about the actions taken.Â  It was discussed that respondent\r\n  may not have accurately described the circumstances surrounding the polygraph\r\n  test.Â  Furthermore, on January 6, 2004, a state senator sent a letter to the\r\n  chief magistrate judge indicating his understanding that the reasons given for\r\n  the magistratesâ€™ actions were not justified, and he encouraged the court to\r\n  take immediate action to reinstate the three employees.Â  The magistrates met\r\n  again on January 8, 2004, and voted to reinstate all of the employees.\r\nShortly after the\r\n  January 8, 2004 meeting, the matter was reported to the Commission on Judicial\r\n  Conduct for investigation.Â  The Commission reopened its files on Matter A and\r\n  Matter B, and it also investigated whether respondent had misrepresented the\r\n  facts surrounding his being â€œclearedâ€ or â€œexoneratedâ€ by SLED and the\r\n  Commission, as well as respondentâ€™s potential misrepresentation of the\r\n  polygraph testing.\r\nAfter receiving\r\n  notice of the investigation, respondent took and passed a polygraph test\r\n  administered by a private examiner and submitted the results to ODC as evidence\r\n  that respondentâ€™s denials of misconduct were truthful.Â  The test results were later\r\n  analyzed by SLED and determined to be inaccurate.[3] Â Respondent, after being notified of SLEDâ€™s conclusions, declined to take\r\n  another polygraph test that would have been administered by SLED.Â  However, throughout\r\n  the investigation, he has constantly denied the allegations in both matters and\r\n  has maintained that he did not make any statements at the January 5, 2004\r\n  meeting pertaining to being cleared by judicial standards in regards to Matter\r\n  A and Matter B, the SLED investigation, Â or a polygraph examination.\r\nOn August 10, 2004, ODC petitioned to have respondent placed on interim suspension pending the\r\n  investigation.Â  In response, respondent informed this Court that he desired to\r\n  retire on December 31, 2004, in lieu of interim suspension, so that he could\r\n  have time to file for retirement and Social Security.Â  By order dated August\r\n  20, 2004, the Court accepted respondentâ€™s offer to retire no later than\r\n  December 31, 2004, but placed respondent on interim suspension until he\r\n  retired.[4]\r\nOn May 2, 2005,\r\n  respondent wrote a letter to Governor Mark Sanford, complaining about the\r\n  allegations against respondent.Â  Respondent stated in his letter that he had\r\n  passed a polygraph examination.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nODC filed formal\r\n  charges in this matter on June 23, 2006, and a hearing was held before the\r\n  Panel on March 26, 2007.Â  The Panel characterized the charges as centered on\r\n  five basic allegations:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1) \r\n\t\t\tAllegations by Complainant A that respondent \r\n\t\t\tproposed and encouraged her to videotape herself engaged in sexual \r\n\t\t\trelations with another magistrate for the purpose of obtaining \r\n\t\t\tincriminating evidence to use against the magistrate \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2)\r\n\t\t\tAllegations by Complainant B that respondent used \r\n\t\t\tthe term â€œniggersâ€ in a conversation with her referring to men that \r\n\t\t\ta court clerk was possibly dating \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3) \r\n\t\t\tAllegations that respondent orchestrated the firing \r\n\t\t\tof three magistrate court clerks (Complainant A, Complainant B, and \r\n\t\t\tthe clerk who notified the NAACP) in retaliation for their reporting \r\n\t\t\talleged misconduct by respondent&nbsp; \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4) \r\n\t\t\tAllegations that respondent falsely related to the \r\n\t\t\tother Spartanburg County magistrate judges that he had been cleared \r\n\t\t\tof all wrongdoing and had offered and was willing to take a \r\n\t\t\tpolygraph test in connection with Matter A and Matter B, but that he \r\n\t\t\twas not required to take a polygraph test because one or more of his \r\n\t\t\taccusers were unwilling to be tested, and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(5)\r\n\t\t\tAllegations that respondent falsely represented in \r\n\t\t\ta letter to Governor Sanford that he had passed a polygraph \r\n\t\t\texamination. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Panel found that the first two allegations were proven by clear convincing\r\n  evidence.Â  As to the firing and misrepresentation charges, the Panel found that\r\n  it had been proven by clear and convincing evidence that respondent had asserted\r\n  at the January 5, 2004 meeting that he had been cleared by SLED and â€œjudicial\r\n  standards.â€Â  However, the Panel held that this assertion alone did not\r\n  establish misconduct because respondentâ€™s statement was reasonable given the\r\n  action taken by the Commission, SLED, and the attorney general.Â  The Panel also\r\n  recognized that there was some discussion at the meeting regarding respondentâ€™s\r\n  willingness and/or refusal to take a polygraph examination at the request of\r\n  SLED investigators, but it was not proven by clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  respondent made the representations at the meeting with the intention of\r\n  influencing the magistratesâ€™ decisions to terminate the clerksâ€™ employment.Â \r\n  Finally, the Panel did not find any misconduct from the Sanford complaint\r\n  because respondent no longer held a judicial office, having resigned December\r\n  31, 2004, and because respondent had in fact passed a polygraph test by a\r\n  private examiner, despite the disputed result.\r\nThe\r\n  Panel concluded that respondentâ€™s misconduct under Rule 7(a) of the Rules of\r\n  Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement violated:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1)\r\n\t\t\tCanon 1 by failing to uphold the integrity of the \r\n\t\t\tjudiciary;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2)\r\n\t\t\tCanon 1(A) by failing to participate in \r\n\t\t\testablishing, maintaining, and enforcing high standards of conduct, \r\n\t\t\tand personally observing those standards;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3)\r\n\t\t\tCanon 2 by failing to avoid impropriety and the \r\n\t\t\tappearance of impropriety;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4)\r\n\t\t\tCanon 2(A) by failing to act at all times in a \r\n\t\t\tmanner that promotes public confidence in the judiciary;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(5)\r\n\t\t\tCanon 2(B) by allowing his relationships with \r\n\t\t\tothers to influence the judgeâ€™s judicial conduct or judgment;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(6)&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tCanon 3 by failing to perform the\r\n  duties of the judicial office impartially;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(7) \r\n\t\t\tCanon 3(B)(4) by failing to be dignified and \r\n\t\t\tcourteous to those with whom the judge deals in an official capacity \r\n\t\t\tand requiring similar conduct of persons subject to the judgeâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tdiscretion and control;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(8)\r\n\t\t\tCanon 3(B)(5) by failing to perform his judicial \r\n\t\t\tduties without bias or prejudice and by failing to cooperate with \r\n\t\t\tother judges and court officials in the administration of court \r\n\t\t\tbusiness; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(9)\r\n\t\t\tCanon 3(C)(2) by failing to require staff, court \r\n\t\t\tofficials, and others subject to the judgeâ€™s discretion and control \r\n\t\t\tto observe the standards of fidelity that apply to the judge.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n&nbsp; Respondentâ€™s Objections\r\nRespondent argues\r\n  that the findings of misconduct by the Panel are not supported by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  Panel found that respondentâ€™s testimony in response to most of the material\r\n  allegations against him was not credible or believable.Â  The findings of the\r\n  Panel are entitled to great weight, particularly when the inferences drawn from\r\n  the testimony in the record depend largely on the credibility of the\r\n  witnesses.Â  In re Yarborough, 327 S.C. 161, 165, 488 S.E.2d 871, 873\r\n  (1997).Â  In addition, both complainants testified as to their recollections\r\n  surrounding the allegations, and their testimony was supported by their\r\n  supervisors who described their demeanor and corroborated their assertions.Â  After\r\n  reviewing the record, we believe the findings of misconduct against respondent\r\n  were established by clear and convincing evidence.\r\n\r\nODCâ€™s Objections\r\nODC raises four\r\n  exceptions to the Panelâ€™s recommendation.Â  First, ODC argues the Panel erred in\r\n  failing to include a finding that respondent also violated Canon 3(C)(1)[5] or Canon 4(A)(2)[6] due to respondentâ€™s use of the racial slur.Â  \r\nRespondent used the\r\n  derogatory term while on a phone call with Complainant B, and the purpose of\r\n  the call was to complain about the job performance of two other employees.Â  Respondentâ€™s\r\n  conduct clearly evinced a bigoted animus in the performance of his judicial\r\n  duties, and the Panel appropriately determined that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  fell under Canon 3(B)(5).Â  We believe it is unnecessary to find separate\r\n  violations of Canon 3(C)(1) and Canon 4(A)(2). \r\nODC next argues\r\n  that the Panel erred in finding respondent did not commit misconduct by\r\n  asserting in the January 5, 2004 meeting that he had been cleared or\r\n  exonerated.\r\nThe Panel\r\n  determined that it had been proved that respondent asserted in some form that\r\n  he had been cleared or exonerated by SLED and the Commission but that\r\n  respondentâ€™s position was reasonable.Â  ODC claims it was not reasonable because\r\n  it argues there is a difference in being â€œclearedâ€ or â€œexoneratedâ€ and having prosecution\r\n  declined due to lack of evidence.Â  ODC contends that by using the words\r\n  â€œclearedâ€ or â€œexoneratedâ€, respondent intentionally implied that there had been\r\n  a factual finding that respondent had not committed the misconduct alleged by Complainant\r\n  A and Complainant B.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  it is true that no correspondence from SLED, the attorney generalâ€™s office, or\r\n  the Commission use the terms â€œclearedâ€ or â€œexoneratedâ€, it is undisputed that\r\n  respondent was not facing any prosecution or investigation from SLED or the\r\n  Commission at the time of the meeting on January 5, 2004.Â  Respondentâ€™s\r\n  assertion that he had been cleared of misconduct was based on his reasonable\r\n  belief in light of the earlier proceedings.Â  Accordingly, we decline to find\r\n  respondent committed misconduct due to this statement made during the January\r\n  5, 2004 meeting.\r\nODC also argues\r\n  that the Panel erred by finding that respondent misrepresented his willingness\r\n  to take a polygraph examination.\r\nAt the hearing\r\n  before the Panel, all eleven judges, including respondent, who were present at\r\n  the January 5th meeting testified.Â  Four of the judges (including\r\n  respondent) testified that they could not recall any specific representation or\r\n  mention of the polygraph issue by respondent.Â  The other seven judges testified,\r\n  in general, that respondent stated he was willing to take a polygraph test but\r\n  that respondent did not have to take one because his accusers would not take a\r\n  polygraph test.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the Panel was correct in noting there was conflicting testimony concerning\r\n  the details and context of any discussion surrounding the polygraph\r\n  examination.Â  As such, ODC did not clearly and convincingly prove its\r\n  allegation that respondent commented directly on the subject of the polygraph\r\n  test during the meeting, and that such information influenced the\r\n  magistratesâ€™ decision as respondent intended.\r\nFinally, ODC\r\n  contends the Panel erred in finding respondent did not commit misconduct\r\n  because of his representation to Governor Sanford that he had passed a\r\n  polygraph test.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Panel correctly\r\n  held respondentâ€™s statement that he had passed the polygraph test was\r\n  reasonably accurate.Â  The private examiner who administered the polygraph test\r\n  initially determined that respondent passed, and although this conclusion was\r\n  later challenged, respondent had been told that he had passed the examination.Â \r\n  We find no misconduct for respondentâ€™s letter to Governor Sanford.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nA\r\n  public reprimand is the most severe sanction that can be imposed against\r\n  respondent, In re Bethune, 372 S.C. 249, 642 S.E.2d 575 (2007), and we\r\n  adopt the Panelâ€™s conclusions in its entirety.Â  Respondent is to receive the\r\n  following sanctions: (1) public reprimand; (2) respondent is prohibited from\r\n  seeking or accepting any judicial position in South Carolina without the\r\n  express permission of the Supreme Court; and (3) respondent is ordered to pay\r\n  costs of proceedings.\r\nPUBLIC\r\n  REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In a letter dated August 28, 2003 from the Attorney\r\n  Generalâ€™s office to the SLED investigator, the Attorney Generalâ€™s office informed\r\n  SLED that there was insufficient evidence to secure a conviction.\r\n[2] Respondent met with two other magistrate judges the\r\n  Friday before this meeting, and they discussed the upcoming meeting.\r\n[3] The private examiner acknowledged at the hearing\r\n  before the Panel that he changed his mind after meeting with SLED officials and\r\n  agreed that respondent did not pass the polygraph examination.\r\n[4] Since this order in August 2004, respondent has\r\n  corresponded with the Court numerous times requesting his retirement and/or\r\n  suspension be lifted.Â

Hancock, of South Carolina Department of Revenue, of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  The operator of\r\n  a gambling cruise ship appeals the Administrative Law Courtâ€™s (the ALCâ€™s)\r\n  finding that section 3-11-400 of the South Carolina Code requires monthly reports\r\n  of gross proceeds, not just the percentage of winnings to losses.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nThe enactment of section 3-11-400 took effect on June 1, 2005.Â  At\r\n  that time, Appellant Ventures South Carolina, LLC, (hereinafter, â€œSunCruzâ€)\r\n  operated a gambling cruise vessel under the name of â€œSunCruz Casinosâ€ out of Horry County.Â  Pursuant to section 3-11-400, SunCruz submitted reports to the Department of\r\n  Revenue detailing only the percentage of winnings to losses.Â  Because the\r\n  Department was required to determine the â€œform and formatâ€ of the monthly\r\n  report, it developed a form requiring gambling cruise operators to report the\r\n  amount of money taken in and paid out per machine and the total percentage of\r\n  wins and losses per machine.Â  On September 15, 2005, the Department wrote a\r\n  letter to SunCruz informing it that the reports submitted did not meet the\r\n  statutory requirements because SunCruz did not use the forms developed by the\r\n  Department.Â  The Department requested that SunCruz complete the required form\r\n  within ten days or else fines would be imposed up to $41,500 per day for each\r\n  day the report was late.Â  SunCruz responded, arguing the statute only required\r\n  it to report the percentage of wins and losses, and not the total amount taken\r\n  in and paid out.Â  Because the parties could not reach an agreement on the\r\n  matter, a contested hearing was held before the ALC on May 8, 2006.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the hearing, the ALC issued an order siding with the Department.Â  The ALC noted\r\n  that although section 3-11-400(C) stated gambling cruise operators had to\r\n  report the average daily percentage of winnings to losses per machine, it also\r\n  required the Department to conduct an annual audit to verify the percentages\r\n  and allowed the counties to tax the gross proceeds and impose a surcharge per\r\n  ticket sold.Â  Interpreting these subsections together, the ALC concluded the\r\n  Department could require the gambling cruise operators to report the amount of\r\n  money in and amount paid out per machine.Â  Otherwise, the ALC reasoned, the\r\n  counties could not determine the amount of profits to tax and the Department\r\n  would not be able to conduct an audit.Â  Thus, the ALC found SunCruz must\r\n  include in its report the amount wagered and the amount paid out as prize money\r\n  for each machine operated.Â  The Departmentâ€™s motion to certify SunCruzâ€™s appeal\r\n  from the Court of Appeals to this Court was granted. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSunCruz\r\n  argues the ALC erred in its interpretation of section 3-11-400(C)(3)(b)(i)\r\n  because the clear language of the statute requires the reporting of only the\r\n  average daily percentages of winnings to losses per gambling device, not the\r\n  total amount wagered and paid out.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  primary purpose in interpreting statutes is to ascertain the intent of the\r\n  Legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581\r\n  (2000).Â  â€œWe cannot construe a statute without regard to its plain and ordinary\r\n  meaning, and this Court may not resort to subtle or forced construction in an\r\n  attempt to limit or expand a statuteâ€™s scope.â€Â  New York Times Co. v. Spartanburg   County Sch. Dist. No. 7, 374 S.C. 307, 310, 649 S.E.2d 28, 29-30 (2007).Â \r\n  â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and\r\n  definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the\r\n  court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges, 341 S.C. at 85,\r\n  533 S.E.2d at 581.Â  The statuteâ€™s language is considered the best evidence of\r\n  legislative intent.Â  Id.Â  However, the Court will reject the plain\r\n  meaning of the words used in a statute if it would lead to an absurd result and\r\n  will â€œconstrue the statute so as to escape the absurdity and carry the\r\n  intention into effect.â€Â  Ray\r\n    Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 331\r\n  S.C. 19, 26, 501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998). \r\nTurning\r\n  to the instant case, section 3-11-400 provides that a county or municipality\r\n  may assess a surcharge of up to ten percent of each ticket sold per cruise and\r\n  a surcharge of up to five percent of the gross proceeds of each gambling\r\n  vessel.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 3-11-400(C)(2) (Supp. 2007).Â  The section further\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n\t(b)(i)Â  Each gambling vessel must report to the Department of\r\n  Revenue, on a monthly basis, the average daily percentage of winnings to losses\r\n  for each gambling device used on a gambling vessel.Â  The report must be\r\n  delivered to the Department of Revenue on the twentieth day of the month for\r\n  the preceding month, in a form and format determined by the department.Â  If no\r\n  gambling devices are used, the gambling vessel must report to the department\r\n  that no gambling devices were used.Â  The department must perform an annual\r\n    audit to verify the accuracy of the reports.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\t(iii)Â  The department must make this information available, on a\r\n  quarterly basis, to the governing body of the county or municipality from which\r\n  the gambling vessel originates and to the general public.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\t(iv)Â  The department is authorized to promulgate regulations to\r\n  implement the provisions of this subsection.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  3-11-400(C)(3)(b)(i), (iii), (iv) (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).[1]Â  \r\nA clear\r\n  reading of section 3-11-400(C)(3)(b)(i) only requires the reporting of\r\n  percentages of daily wins and losses and allows the Department to draft a form\r\n  for the reporting of this data.Â  Although the statute also allows the\r\n  Department to obtain information, including the total amount of money taken in\r\n  and paid out, to confirm the percentages for an annual audit, it does\r\n  not require monthly reports of this information.Â  Further, although\r\n  section 3-11-400(C)(3)(b)(iv) authorizes the Department to promulgate\r\n  regulations to further implement this section, the Department admitted at oral\r\n  argument that it has not promulgated any regulations requiring monthly reports\r\n  of total monies paid in and paid out at this time.Â  Thus, the Department is\r\n  currently exceeding its power to collect information regarding gross proceeds\r\n  from gambling cruise operators.[2]Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the finding of the ALC is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  MOORE and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. WALLER, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  In my opinion, the Administrative Law Court properly\r\n  construed the statute at issue in this appeal.Â  Therefore, I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  \r\nAs noted by the\r\n  majority, the primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and\r\n  effectuate the intent of the Legislature. E.g., Hodges v. Rainey,\r\n  341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000). When construing statutory\r\n  language, the statute must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of\r\n  the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one given\r\n  effect.

Jasper County, 368 S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629\r\n  (2006).\r\n\r\n  The Gambling Cruise Act (the Act) is found in Chapter 11 of Title 3\r\n  of the South Carolina Code.Â  The Legislature explicitly outlined the intent of\r\n  the Act as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIt is\r\n  the intent of the General Assembly to delegate to counties and municipalities\r\n  of this State the authority to prohibit or regulate the operation of gambling\r\n  vessels that are engaged in voyages that depart from the territorial waters of\r\n  the State, sail into United States or international waters, and return to the\r\n  territorial waters of the State without an intervening stop.\r\n\r\n2005 Act No. 104 Â§ 1.Â  Before\r\n  the Act was signed into law, counties and municipalities were not able to\r\n  prohibit or regulate these gambling cruises, also known as â€œcruises to\r\n  nowhere.â€Â  See Palmetto Princess, LLC v. Town of Edisto Beach,\r\n  369 S.C. 50, 53 n.2, 631 S.E.2d 76, 78 n.2&nbsp;(2006).\r\nWith regard to S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. section 3-11-400(C), the Legislature expressly authorized counties to impose and collect surcharges on (1) gambling vessel\r\n  ticket sales, and (2) the gross proceeds of the vessels.Â  The entire text of\r\n  section 3-11-400(C) provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\t(1) For purposes of this\r\n  section, â€œgross proceedsâ€ means the total amount wagered or otherwise paid, in\r\n  cash or credit, by a passenger or user of a gambling device aboard a gambling\r\n  vessel.\r\n\t(2) If a county or municipality does not adopt an\r\n  ordinance prohibiting a gambling vessel from operating, or if a gambling vessel\r\n  other than a passenger cruise liner is permitted to operate\r\n  because that gambling vessel, on each cruise, makes an intervening stop in\r\n  another State, possession of the United States, or foreign country, the\r\n    county or municipality may assess a surcharge of up to ten percent of each\r\n    ticket sold per gambling cruise, and a surcharge of up to five percent of the\r\n    gross proceeds of each gambling vessel.\r\n\t(3)(a) If a county or municipality assesses the\r\n  surcharges set forth in item (2), then the proceeds of the surcharges are to be\r\n  paid to the county or municipality from which the gambling vessel originates\r\n  its cruise. Â The county or municipality is responsible for setting forth\r\n  the procedures by which the proceeds are paid to the county or the\r\n  municipality.\r\n\t(b)(i) Each\r\n  gambling vessel must report to the Department of Revenue, on a monthly basis,\r\n  the average daily percentage of winnings to losses for each gambling device\r\n  used on a gambling vessel. Â The report must be delivered to the Department\r\n  of Revenue on the twentieth day of the month for the preceding month, in a\r\n    form and format determined by the department. Â If no gambling devices are\r\n  used, the gambling vessel must report to the department that no gambling\r\n  devices were used. Â The department must perform an annual audit to verify\r\n    the accuracy of the reports.\r\n\t(ii) A\r\n  gambling vessel that fails to deliver the report of winnings and losses to the department may be assessed a civil penalty up to the amount of one hundred dollars per day per gambling device for each day that\r\n  the report is late.\r\n\t(iii) The\r\n  department must make this information available, on a quarterly basis, to the\r\n  governing body of the county or municipality from which the gambling vessel\r\n  originates and to the general public.Â  In addition, quarterly reports must be\r\n  submitted to the Governor, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and the\r\n  Speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\n\t(iv) The\r\n  department is authorized to promulgate regulations to implement the provisions\r\n  of this subsection.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 3-11-400(C) (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).\r\nFirst, it is\r\n  significant to note the monthly report required by subsection\r\n  3-11-400(C)(3)(b)(i) must be filed with respondent â€œin a form and format\r\n  determined byâ€ respondent.Â  The form reasonably chosen by respondent requires\r\n  inclusion of the amounts wagered and the amounts paid out as winnings.Â  I agree\r\n  with respondent that if the monthly report contained only information\r\n  regarding â€œthe average daily percentage of winnings to losses,â€ there would be\r\n  no substantive information by which respondent could verify the report.Â  This\r\n  verification clearly is essential for respondent to be able to conduct its\r\n  annual audit, and also is necessary so respondent can discharge its duty to\r\n  provide the mandated quarterly reports.Â  See Â§Â§ 3-11-400(C)(3)(b)(i)\r\n  &amp; (iii).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  without some kind of reporting on the actual amounts wagered, and the amounts\r\n  paid out, there would be no data on which the counties and municipalities could\r\n  compute â€œgross proceeds.â€Â  Yet, the counties and municipalities are expressly\r\n  allowed to tax the gross proceeds of these gambling vessels.Â  See Â§Â§\r\n  3-11-400(C)(1), (2) &amp; (3)(a).Â  \r\nIn my opinion, â€œthe\r\n  average daily percentage of winnings to lossesâ€ phrase contained in\r\n  subsection 3-11-400(C)(3)(b)(i) simply cannot be read in isolation.Â  It must be\r\n  read and harmonized with all the language of section 3-11-400(C), and with the\r\n  overall intent of the Act which the Legislature has clearly stated.Â  As\r\n  respondent aptly argues, the result of the majorityâ€™s interpretation of the\r\n  statute would lead to the absurd result that counties and municipalities have\r\n  the ability to levy a tax on the gross proceeds of a gambling vessel, but the\r\n  gambling vessel is not required to report these gross proceeds.Â  Such a result\r\n  is patently absurd, and I reject that this is what the Legislature intended. See, e.g., Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C.\r\n  271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366&nbsp;(1994) (â€œHowever plain the ordinary meaning\r\n  of the words used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when\r\n  to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not\r\n  possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain\r\n  legislative intention.â€).\r\nFor these reasons,\r\n  I would affirm the ALCâ€™s decision\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  Section 3-11-400 (C)(3)(b)(iv) authorizes the Department to promulgate\r\n  regulations to implement the provisions of â€œthis subsection,â€ meaning\r\n  subsection (C) in its entirety.Â  Thus, if the Department promulgated\r\n  regulations requiring a monthly report of money taken in and paid out per\r\n  machine, SunCruz must comply.Â  \r\n[2]Â \r\n  The Department concedes that absent the requirement to audit, the statute\r\n  limits the information required to be reported monthly to daily percentages of\r\n  winnings to losses.Â  On the other hand, SunCruz concedes that the Department is\r\n  entitled to â€œgross proceedsâ€ information during its annual audit.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26487","title":"Lazicki-Thomas v.

Avant, both of South Carolina Retirement Systems, of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  The issue in this appeal\r\n  is whether the Administrative Law Court (ALC) correctly interpreted the meaning\r\n  of the phrase â€œmember in serviceâ€ in the Police Officers Retirement System\r\n  (PORS) disability statute[1] to mean a member who is still an employee.Â  We hold the phrase was properly\r\n  construed and affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant\r\n  was employed as a City of North Charleston firefighter, accruing five years,\r\n  three months, and sixteen days of service credit in the PORS.Â  In April 2004,\r\n  she was allegedly injured on the job, and as of January 28, 2005, her city\r\n  employment was terminated.Â  Appellant filed an application for disability\r\n  retirement on August 16, 2005, and respondent promptly notified her that she\r\n  was ineligible to apply because she was not â€œin serviceâ€ when the application\r\n  was made.Â  Following exhaustion of her administrative remedies and a final\r\n  determination by respondent, appellant filed a request for a contested case\r\n  hearing with the ALC.\r\nIn\r\n  August 2006, while appellantâ€™s case was pending, the ALC sitting en banc issued an order in a case entitled Anderson v. S.C. Budget &amp;\r\n    Control Bd., S.C. Retirement Sys. In Anderson, the ALC interpreted\r\n  the phrase â€œmember in serviceâ€ in the South Carolina Retirement System (SCRS)\r\n  disability retirement statute.[2]Â \r\n  The ALC held that the phrase â€œas applied to an employee seeking disability\r\n  retirement benefits, plainly means a person having the status of an employeeâ€¦at\r\n  the time the application for disability benefits is filed, specifically\r\n  including those on accrued annual leave or sick leave.â€Â  In reaching this\r\n  decision, the ALC relied in part on the legislative histories of the PORS\r\n  disability retirement statute and the Retirement System for Members of the\r\n  General Assembly disability statute,[3] both of which contain language identical to that in the SCRS statute, i.e.,\r\n  â€œthe application of a member in service.â€Â  The parties and the ALC agree the Anderson order applies to disability applicants under all three retirement\r\n  systems.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the filing of the Anderson order, respondent was granted summary\r\n  judgment.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether\r\n  a disability retirement application is untimely if not filed while the applicant\r\n  is a member in service?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe PORS disability\r\n  retirement statute contains the following provision:\r\n\r\n\tOn the\r\n  application of a member in service or the memberâ€™s employer, a member who\r\n  has five or more completed years of earned service or any contributing member\r\n  who is disabled as a result of an injury arising out of and in the course of\r\n  the performance of the memberâ€™s duties regardless of length of membership may\r\n  be retired by the retirement board not less than thirty days and not more than\r\n  nine months next following the date of filing the application on a disability\r\n  retirement allowance if the system, after a medical examination of the member,\r\n  certifies that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the\r\n  further performance of duty, that the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and\r\n  that the member should be retired.\r\n\tÂ§\r\n  9-11-80(1) (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nThe ALC found that\r\n  there was no need to resort of the rules of statutory construction to determine\r\n  the meaning of the term â€œin serviceâ€ as the language was clear, plain and\r\n  unambiguous, and meant that the member was an employee at the time the\r\n  disability application was filed.Â  See Ventures South Carolina, LLC\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Rev., Op No. 26486 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 12, 2008)\r\n  (â€œwhere language is plain and unambiguous â€¦ the rules of statutory\r\n  interpretation are not neededâ€).\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends the ALC erred in finding the disability retirement statute\r\n  unambiguous.Â  Her focus is not on the term â€œmember in service,â€ but rather the\r\n  event to which it applies.Â  She reads the statute to require that the\r\n  disability arise during employment, and to be silent on the time for filing the\r\n  application.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  PORS disability statute begins with the clause â€œOn the application of a member\r\n  in service,â€ an unambiguous reference to the application process. The timing of\r\n  the disabling event is found later in the sentence, with disability retirement\r\n  available to a member with five or more completed years of earned service who\r\n  becomes disabled for any reason, or to any contributing member with less than\r\n  the five years â€œwho is disabled as a result of an injury arising out of and in\r\n  the course of the performance of the memberâ€™s duties . . . .â€Â  Â That the\r\n  disabling event and the application must both occur while the person is still\r\n  employed is evident from the procedural language at the conclusion of the\r\n  statute which states the applicant â€œmay be retiredâ€¦if the systemâ€¦certifies that\r\n  the member should be retired.â€Â  A person who is no longer working for the\r\n  entity cannot â€œbe retiredâ€ from that agency.Â  We find no support for\r\n  appellantâ€™s assertion that the statuteâ€™s opening phrase â€œOn the application of\r\n  a member in serviceâ€ merely qualifies the timing of the disabling event rather\r\n  than defining the application period.\r\nThe\r\n  disability retirement statutes mandate that the application be filed by a\r\n  â€œmember in service.â€Â  Appellant was not in service when her application was\r\n  filed, and respondentâ€™s summary judgment motion was properly granted.Â \r\n  Therefore, the order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, BEATTY, JJ. and Acting Justice E.

Strom, of Greenville, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL: In this case, Appellant\r\n  Cedric Perkins was terminated from the Thirteenth Circuit Drug Court Program, and\r\n  the trial court imposed Appellantâ€™s suspended sentence.Â  Appellant argues\r\n  positive â€œsweat patchâ€ drug tests and certain\r\n  violations should not have been considered in the decision to terminate\r\n  Appellant from the Drug Court Program.Â  We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nThe Thirteenth\r\n  Circuit Drug Court Program (hereinafter â€œDrug Court Programâ€ or â€œProgramâ€) is a\r\n  voluntary therapeutic program which may be offered to a defendant that is\r\n  charged with a drug abuse offense within the thirteenth circuit jurisdiction.Â \r\n  The defendant pleads guilty to the charge and agrees with the solicitor to\r\n  enter the Program.Â  As a result, the trial court imposes a sentence on the defendant,\r\n  but suspends the sentence, conditioned upon the successful completion the Program.Â \r\n  The participant agrees to abide by certain terms and conditions of\r\n  participation and may be sanctioned or ultimately terminated for failure to\r\n  comply with the terms of the Program.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, Appellant pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute\r\n  crack cocaine.Â  The trial court sentenced him to ten years imprisonment,\r\n  suspended upon his successful completion of the Drug Court Program.Â  Appellant entered\r\n  the Program on September 13, 2002.Â  On September 25, 2003, after numerous\r\n  violations, Appellant met with the Programâ€™s chief administrator where she told\r\n  Appellant that he could remain in the Program so long as he had no more\r\n  violations.Â  However, Appellant subsequently tested positive for drugs, and on\r\n  October 12, 2003, program administrators recommended his termination.[1]Â \r\n  Following a hearing, the trial court issued an order terminating Appellant from\r\n  the Program and imposing his original sentence.Â  \r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n  appealed the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  This Court certified the appeal pursuant to\r\n  Rule 204(b), SCACR, and Appellant presents the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  lower court wrongfully terminate Appellant from the Drug Court Program?[2]\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAppellant argues that\r\n  he was wrongfully terminated from the Drug Court Program.Â  Because undertaking\r\n  such a review would require that this Court evaluate and assess the manner in\r\n  which the Programâ€™s administrators execute the rules and regulations of the\r\n  Program - an inquiry over which this Court has no authority - we decline to\r\n  answer this question.\r\nSeveral counties\r\n  across the State have implemented Drug Court Programs similar to the Thirteenth\r\n  Circuit Drug Court Program.Â  These Programs are aimed at rehabilitating the\r\n  participant and helping him overcome addiction, but the specific manner in\r\n  which each Drug Court Program operates varies.Â  For example, under the\r\n  procedures of other Programs, a social worker, a magistrate, or a Drug Court team member may terminate the participant from the Program.Â  However, pursuant to\r\n  the Thirteenth Circuit Drug Court Program procedures, Program administrators\r\n  recommend a participant for termination, and the trial court decides whether to\r\n  terminate a participant from the Program.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  decline to review whether Appellantâ€™s positive sweat patch results or\r\n  violations occurring after the meeting with the chief administrator were\r\n  properly considered in the decision to terminate Appellant from the Drug Court\r\n  Program.Â  In our view, it would be improper for the judiciary to interject\r\n  itself into such matters which are wholly internal and specific to each Program\r\n  and to each participant.Â  To do so would transform the Drug Court Programs into\r\n  a judicially-supervised institution.Â  Thus, in order to assess what issues Appellant\r\n  may appeal and what issues this Court may review, it is necessary to begin by\r\n  clarifying the judicial determinations below.\r\nAfter\r\n  Appellantâ€™s guilty plea, the trial court sentenced Appellant to ten years\r\n  imprisonment, but suspended the imposition of that sentence conditioned upon\r\n  the successful completion of the Drug Court Program.Â  Thus, the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  imposition of his original sentence after being terminated from the Drug Court\r\n  Program deprived Appellant of a conditional liberty interest, and thereby\r\n  entitled him due process rights.Â  See Dangerfield\r\n    v. State, 376\r\n  S.C. 176,Â Â Â Â Â Â  , 656 S.E.2d 352, 355 (2008)\r\n  (holding that the imposition of a suspended sentence deprived the defendant of\r\n  a conditional liberty interest and implicated the defendantâ€™s due process\r\n  rights).Â  Therefore, like any other defendant who is\r\n  subject to the imposition of a suspended sentence, we conclude that a Drug\r\n  Court Program participant is entitled to notice and a hearing to determine\r\n  whether he has violated the conditions of his suspended sentence before his\r\n  sentence may be imposed.Â  See id. (holding that due process required\r\n  notice and a hearing on the willfulness of the defendantâ€™s failure to pay\r\n  restitution before imposition of a suspended sentence).Â  Accordingly, while we\r\n  hold that it is inappropriate for the courts to review whether a participant\r\n  was properly terminated from a Drug Court Program, the participant is\r\n  entitled to a hearing to determine whether he was in fact terminated from a\r\n  Drug Court Program (i.e., whether the defendant violated a condition of his\r\n  suspended sentence) before his sentence may be imposed.[3]\r\nThe\r\n  decision of whether a defendant has violated a condition of his suspended\r\n  sentence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. Â See State v. Miller, 122 S.C. 468, 474-75, 115 S.E. 742, 745 (1923)\r\n  (holding that the nature of the inquiry and extent of the\r\n  investigation to be conducted by a lower court in determining whether the\r\n  condition of a suspended sentence has been violated are matters that rest in\r\n  the sound discretion of that court). Â An\r\n  appellate court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision unless that court\r\n  abused its discretion.Â  See State v. Allen, 370\r\n  S.C. 88, 94, 634 S.E.2d 653, 655 (2006)\r\n  (addressing the applicable standards of review in a probation revocation\r\n  hearing).\r\nIn the instant case, it is undisputed that a condition of\r\n  Appellantâ€™s suspended sentence was the successful completion of the Drug Court\r\n  Program and that Appellant was terminated from the Program.Â  Thus, the trial\r\n  court correctly determined that Appellant violated a condition of his suspended\r\n  sentence, and therefore, properly imposed Appellantâ€™s original sentence.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we must uphold the imposition of Appellantâ€™s sentence.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s order imposing Appellantâ€™s\r\n  original sentence.Â  \r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice Diane Schafer Goodstein, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Appellant was sanctioned eighteen times while in the Program.Â  Appellantâ€™s\r\n  violations included positive drug tests, missed drug tests, tardiness for court\r\n  appearances, missed appointments with program administrators, and failure to\r\n  pay fees.Â  \r\n[2] Specifically, Appellant argues that the lower court wrongfully terminated him\r\n  from the Program because it erred in considering positive drug test results\r\n  from â€œsweat patchesâ€ when the Drug Court Programâ€™s contract did not provide for\r\n  such testing methods and erred in considering violations that occurred prior to\r\n  the September 25, 2003 meeting with the Programâ€™s chief administrator.\r\n[3] That the trial court in the instant case had the authority, pursuant to the Thirteenth\r\n  Circuit Program rules, to terminate Appellant from the Program and also had\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to impose Appellantâ€™s suspended sentence and\r\n  memorialized these decisions in the same order is irrelevant to our scope of\r\n  review.Â  We note that although magistrates, social workers, or Drug Court team members in other Programs determine whether to terminate the participant,\r\n  these bodies do not have the authority to impose the suspended sentence.Â  A\r\n  terminated participant should always be afforded a hearing before the proper\r\n  tribunal with the authority to impose a suspended sentence.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26491","title":"Cain v.

Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581\r\n  (2000).Â  â€œWe cannot construe a statute without regard to its plain and ordinary\r\n  meaning, and this Court may not resort to subtle or forced construction in an\r\n  attempt to limit or expand a statuteâ€™s scope.â€Â  New York Times Co. v. Spartanburg   County Sch. Dist. No. 7, 374 S.C. 307, 310, 649 S.E.2d 28, 29-30 (2007).Â \r\n  â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and\r\n  definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the\r\n  court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges, 341 S.C. at 85,\r\n  533 S.E.2d at 581.Â  The statuteâ€™s language is considered the best evidence of\r\n  legislative intent.Â  Id.Â  However, the Court will reject the plain\r\n  meaning of the words used in a statute if it would lead to an absurd result and\r\n  will â€œconstrue the statute so as to escape the absurdity and carry the\r\n  intention into effect.â€Â  Ray\r\n    Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 331\r\n  S.C. 19, 26, 501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998).Â  Further, when a plain reading of the\r\n  statute â€œlends itself to two equally logical interpretations, this Court must\r\n  apply the rules of statutory interpretation to resolve the ambiguity and to\r\n  discover the intent of the General Assembly.â€Â  Kennedy v. South Carolina Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 348, 549 S.E.2d 243, 247 (2001). \r\nSection 15-78-190, which is part of the Tort Claims Act, is\r\n  encaptioned:Â  â€œCompensation of plaintiff pursuant to underinsured or uninsured defendant provisions of plaintiffâ€™s insurance policy.â€[4] Â (emphasis added).Â  The section\r\n  states, in relevant part, as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIf the amount of the verdict or judgment is not satisfied by\r\n  reason of the monetary limitations of this chapter upon recovery from the State\r\n  or political subdivision thereof, the plaintiffâ€™s insurance company, subject\r\n    to the underinsured and uninsured defendant provisions of the plaintiffâ€™s\r\n    insurance policy, if any, shall compensate the plaintiff for the difference between the amount of the verdict or judgment and the payment by the political\r\n  subdivision.Â  If a cause of action is barred under Â§ 15-78-60 of the 1976 Code,\r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s insurance company must compensate him for his losses subject to\r\n  the aforementioned provisions of his insurance policy.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-190 (2005) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nA clear reading of the statute shows that the purpose is to allow\r\n  injured parties with damages above the statutory cap in the Tort Claims Act to\r\n  obtain further compensation.Â  While Cain argues the statute was intended to\r\n  compensate all persons with damages above the statutory cap in a Tort Claims\r\n  Act case, regardless of whether they meet the statutory or policy definitions\r\n  for uninsured or underinsured defendant coverage, we take the more limited view\r\n  that it was intended only to allow compensation where the definitions were met.Â  \r\nSection 15-78-20 contains the declaration of public policy for the\r\n  enactment of the Tort Claims Act and states that â€œ[t]he remedy provided by this\r\n  chapter is the exclusive civil remedy available for any tort committed\r\n  by a governmental entity, its employees, or its agents except as provided in Â§\r\n  15-78-70(b).â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(b) (2005) (emphasis added).Â  While limiting\r\n  recovery under the Tort Claims Act as the sole method of obtaining compensation from the government is not unusual, the uninsured motorist and\r\n  underinsured motorist insurance arena is unique.Â  Certainly, the sole purpose\r\n  of the existence of these kinds of insurance is to provide compensation where\r\n  the at-fault motorist either is not insured or does not have enough insurance.Â \r\n  Thus, by enacting section 15-78-190, the Legislature assured that an insurance\r\n  company could not cite the â€œexclusive civil remedyâ€ portion of section 15-78-20\r\n  to deny payment from the plaintiffâ€™s uninsured or underinsured motorist\r\n  coverage where recovery pursuant to the Tort Claims Act was insufficient.Â  Injured\r\n  parties are free to seek recovery under their underinsured or uninsured\r\n  motorist policies any time recovery from the at-fault motorist is insufficient,\r\n  and section 15-78-190 was specifically intended to inform insurance companies that\r\n  nothing changes when an at-fault government vehicle is involved.Â  Thus, the\r\n  enactment of this section, which appears to restate portions of other sections\r\n  in the Insurance Code, was not redundant.[5]Â  Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C.\r\n  373, 396, 520 S.E.2d 142, 154 (1999) (â€œWhile provisions establishing\r\n  limitations upon and exemptions from liability of a governmental entity must be\r\n  liberally construed to limit liability, we also must presume in construing a\r\n  statute that the Legislature did not intend to perform a futile thing.â€). Â \r\nConsidering\r\n  the facts of this case, 15-78-190 would be applicable if an uninsured or\r\n  underinsured at-fault government vehicle is involved.Â  Both â€œunderinsured\r\n  motoristâ€ and â€œuninsured motoristâ€ are terms statutorily defined in the\r\n  Insurance Code.[6]Â \r\n  Section 15-78-190 provides that recovery is â€œsubject toâ€ the terms of the\r\n  insuredâ€™s underinsured or uninsured policy.Â  Thus, in order to recover, the\r\n  plaintiff must first meet the requirements and terms found both in the statute\r\n  and within the policy, assuming the policy provisions do not violate the law or\r\n  public policy of this State.Â  In most instances, this will necessarily limit\r\n  recovery to an injured party who meets the definitions.Â  \r\nTurning to the instant case, we agree with the circuit court that\r\n  Cain was not entitled to recover under the â€œuninsured motoristâ€ section of his\r\n  policy.Â  Strictly applying the statutory and policy definitions, it is apparent\r\n  that the dump truck was an â€œunderinsuredâ€ vehicle because the dump truck had\r\n  insurance protection greater than the minimum limits but less than Cainâ€™s\r\n  damages.[7]Â \r\n  Cain admitted that he did not have â€œunderinsured motoristâ€ coverage on his\r\n  policy.Â  Because recovery under section 15-78-190 is subject to the\r\n  requirements in his policy, Cain failed to meet the definitions and cannot\r\n  recover.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWhile\r\n  we sympathize with Cainâ€™s need for further compensation, we cannot ignore the\r\n  clear meaning attached to the terms â€œunderinsuredâ€ and â€œuninsuredâ€ contained\r\n  within section 15-78-190.Â  It is evident the Legislature intended this section\r\n  to prevent insurers from denying further compensation above amounts recovered\r\n  pursuant to the Tort Claims Act.Â  Thus, it does not change the fact that\r\n  recovery is limited to situations where the policy terms are met.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order denying recovery is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice Diane Schafer Goodstein, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  The South Carolina Tort Claims Act caps liability for damages caused by a\r\n  governmental agency at $300,000 for a single occurrence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-120(a)(1) (2005).Â  \r\n[2]Â \r\n  The policy was issued to Lekettia Pough and it included Cain as one of the\r\n  named drivers.Â  Â Â \r\n[3]Â \r\n  Brenda Cain, Delmoreâ€™s wife, was also a passenger in the vehicle and also\r\n  suffered serious injuries.Â  Although she was a party in the lawsuit against Richland Cou  nty, she was not a party in the underlying claim against Nationwide.Â  \r\n[4]Â \r\n  It is interesting to note that Act 463, enacting the Tort Claims Act, just\r\n  listed this section as â€œPlaintiff to be compensated.â€Â  1986 S.C. Acts 463, Â§\r\n  6.Â  \r\n[5]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-150 (2002) (providing that an insured may\r\n  select â€œuninsured motorist coverageâ€ and proceed under the section to obtain\r\n  damages from the owner of an uninsured vehicle); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160\r\n  (2002) (providing recovery under â€œunderinsured motorist coverageâ€).Â  \r\n[6]Â  Similar to the definition\r\n  found in the Nationwide policy, our Legislature has defined an â€œunderinsured\r\n  motor vehicleâ€ as one where â€œthere is bodily injury liability insurance or a\r\n  bond applicable at the time of the accident in an amount of at least that\r\n  specified in Section 38-77-140 and the amount of the insurance or bond is less\r\n  than the amount of the insuredâ€™s damages.â€Â  S.C.

Â§ 38-77-30(15)\r\n  (2002).Â  An â€œuninsured motor vehicleâ€ is one as to which:\r\n\r\n\t(a)Â  there is not bodily injury liability insurance and property\r\n  damage liability insurance both at least in the amounts specified in Section\r\n  38-77-140, or\r\n\t(b)Â  there is nominally that insurance, but the insurer writing\r\n  the same successfully denies coverage thereunder, or\r\n\t(c)Â  there was that insurance, but the insurer who wrote the same\r\n  is declared insolvent, or is in delinquency proceedings, suspension, or\r\n  receivership, or is proven unable fully to respond to a judgment, and\r\n\t(d)Â  there is no bond or deposit of cash or securities in lieu of\r\n  the bodily injury and property damage liability insurance.\r\n\t(e)Â  the owner of the motor vehicle has not qualified as a\r\n  self-insurer in accordance with the applicable provisions of law.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tAny motor vehicle owned by the State or any of its\r\n  political subdivisions is considered an uninsured motor vehicle when the\r\n  vehicle is operated by a person without proper authorization.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(14) (2002).Â  \r\n[7]Â \r\n  In fact, Cain stipulates in his brief that the dump truck does not meet either\r\n  definition of an â€œuninsuredâ€ vehicle.Â  He argues, however, that it does not\r\n  matter for purposes of recovery under section 15-78-190.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Carroll A.

State, 294 S.C. 310, 364 S.E.2d 201 (1988). \r\nPetitioner  filed a second PCR application in which the denial of his right to direct  appeal was the sole issue raised. &nbsp;The  PCR judge found the application was successive and barred by the statute of  limitations.\r\nPetitioner has now filed a  notice of appeal and an explanation, pursuant to Rule 227(c), SCACR, why the  PCR judge&rsquo;s findings were improper.&nbsp;  Specifically, petitioner contends his request for a belated review of  his direct appeal issues pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208  S.E.2d 35 (1974) and Davis v. State, 288 S.C. 290, 342 S.E.2d 60 (1986) was not successive and was not abandoned by  prior proceedings.&nbsp; Petitioner argues  further that the memorandum he submitted to the lower court set forth  meritorious appellate issues.&nbsp;  Accordingly, petitioner maintains he should be allowed his &ldquo;full bite at  the apple.&rdquo;\r\n Initially, we note the PCR judge erred in finding  petitioner&rsquo;s second application was barred by the statute of limitations.&nbsp; Wilson v. State, 348 S.C. 215, 559 S.E.2d 581 (2002)(one year statute of  limitations for PCR claims does not apply to allegation applicant was denied  the right to direct appeal due to the ineffective assistance of counsel).&nbsp; However, he did not err in finding the  application was successive.&nbsp; \r\n All  applicants are entitled to a full and fair opportunity to present claims in one  PCR application.&nbsp; Odom v. State,  337 S.C. 256, 523 S.E.2d 753 (1999). &nbsp;Successive  PCR applications and appeals are generally disfavored because they allow an  applicant to receive more than &ldquo;one bite at the apple as it were.&rdquo;&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;A successive PCR application is one that  raises grounds not raised in a prior application, raises grounds previously  heard and determined, or raises grounds  waived in prior proceedings.&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;In order to be entitled to a successive PCR  application, the applicant must establish that the grounds raised in the  subsequent application could not have been raised in the previous application.&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;\r\n In  the case at hand, petitioner clearly could have raised the issue of the denial  of his right to direct appeal in his first PCR application.&nbsp; Because petitioner failed to raise the issue  in his first application, the PCR judge correctly found petitioner was barred  from raising it in a successive application.&nbsp;  Accordingly, because petitioner has failed to provide a sufficient  explanation, as required by Rule 227(c), why the PCR judge&rsquo;s finding that the  application was barred as successive was improper, we hereby dismiss  petitioner&rsquo;s appeal. \r\nIT  IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n     s/Jean H.

Brady Hair, both of North Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  This is a direct appeal\r\n  from a grant of partial summary judgment to the City of North Charleston.Â  The\r\n  issue on appeal is whether the Town of Summerville complied with a statute\r\n  which requires the publication of notice not less than thirty days prior to\r\n  acting on a petition to annex real property.Â  Because the Town of Summerville did not comply with the statute, we affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis\r\n  is an annexation dispute between neighboring municipalities.Â  At some point in\r\n  2005, both the Town of Summerville and the City of North Charleston desired to\r\n  annex a portion of real property known as the Barry Tract.Â  In April 2005,\r\n  Summerville enacted an ordinance declaring the Barry Tract annexed.Â  Believing\r\n  Summervilleâ€™s annexation to be invalid, North Charleston enacted its annexation\r\n  ordinance in June 2005.Â  The municipalities sued each other, and the cases were\r\n  consolidated for trial.\r\nThe\r\n  record reflects that both municipalities utilized the annexation procedure set\r\n  forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-3-150 (2004), which originates with a petition initiated\r\n  by the owners of the property sought to be annexed.Â  The statute provides that\r\n  annexation is complete upon the enactment of an ordinance and requires the\r\n  annexing municipality to publish notice of a public hearing â€œnot less than thirty\r\n  days before acting on an annexation petition . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  North Charleston moved for summary judgment on the question whether thirty days elapsed\r\n  between April 28, 2005, the date Summerville published notice of its hearing,\r\n  and May 27, 2005, the date Summerville enacted its annexation ordinance.Â  The\r\n  trial court held that thirty days had not elapsed in this period, and\r\n  Summerville appealed.Â  We certified the appeal from the court of appeals\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid\r\n  the trial court err in holding that less than thirty days elapsed between April\r\n  28, 2005, and May 27, 2005?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing a\r\n  grant of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard used by\r\n  the trial court.Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of S.C., Inc.,\r\n  349 S.C. 356, 361, 536 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).Â  A grant of summary judgment is\r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  Determining the proper\r\n  interpretation of a statute is a question of law, and this Court reviews\r\n  questions of law de novo.Â  Catawba Indian Tribe v. State, 372 S.C. 519,\r\n  524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nSummerville argues\r\n  that under a plausible construction of the annexation statute at issue, a â€œdayâ€\r\n  can be measured by the lapse of twenty-four hours from a relevant time.Â  Put in\r\n  terms of the statute at issue, Summerville argues that Â§ 5-3-150 requires that\r\n  a municipality publish notice of a public hearing not less than thirty\r\n  twenty-four hour periods prior to acting on an annexation petition.Â \r\n  Summerville argues that it enacted its annexation ordinance at 5:30 p.m., May\r\n  27, and that counting the days that elapsed by twenty-four hour periods, the\r\n  twenty-ninth day prior to its enacting the ordinance ended at 5:30 p.m., April\r\n  28, 2005.Â  Summerville therefore posits that if the notification in the\r\n  newspaper occurred at 5:00 a.m. the morning of April 28, it occurred midway\r\n  through the thirtieth day and complied with the annexation statuteâ€™s notice\r\n  requirement.Â  We disagree.\r\nSummervilleâ€™s\r\n  argument fails on its own terms.Â  Assuming that the lapse of thirty sequential\r\n  twenty-four hour periods provides the measuring stick, 5:30 p.m., May 27, and\r\n  5:00 a.m., April 28, are separated by 29 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes.Â  Converting\r\n  thirty days to a number of hours of required notice, the statute would then\r\n  mandate that notice be published â€œnot less than [720 hours] before acting on an\r\n  annexation petition . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  In this case, publication and action\r\n  were separated by 708 hours, 30 minutes.Â  As a quantitative reality, this is\r\n  less than thirty days.[1]\r\nIn fact, S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-29-10 (2005) provides a specific method for computing time for\r\n  publication of notices.Â  The statute provides that â€œ[t]he time for publication\r\n  of legal notices shall be computed so as to exclude the first day of\r\n  publication and include the day on which the act or event, of which notice is\r\n  given, is to happen or which completes the full period required for\r\n  publication.â€Â  Id.Â  Using this method, April 28, the day of publication,\r\n  is excluded.Â  Counting forward, May 27 is twenty-nine days from the publication\r\n  of the notice.Â  Thus, using the statutory counting method for legal notices, we\r\n  conclude that Summerville did not comply with the relevant public notice\r\n  requirement in this case.\r\nThe parties offer\r\n  additional arguments on alternative methods of counting time, but those\r\n  arguments are largely inconsequential.Â  North Charleston posits that\r\n  Summervilleâ€™s argument fails even under its own ordinance dealing with\r\n  computation of time.Â  While North Charleston is correct, it is clear that a\r\n  local ordinance cannot, absent some authorization or directive, control how\r\n  time is computed under a state statute.Â  Similarly, this Courtâ€™s rules contain\r\n  procedures for computing time, see Rule 6, SCRCP and Rule 234,\r\n  SCACR, and while these rules unquestionably apply in their respective spheres,\r\n  they are neither dispositive nor are they helpful in answering the question at\r\n  hand.Â  In this case, a statute requires that published notice precede a public\r\n  meeting by a specific time period, and a separate statute specifically explains\r\n  how time is to be computed for the publication of legal notices.Â  \r\nSummervilleâ€™s more\r\n  basic argument about how a â€œdayâ€ is defined is not supported by our precedent.Â \r\n  We have held that â€œ[t]he word â€˜day,â€™ in its common acceptation, means a civil\r\n  day of twenty-four hours, beginning and ending at midnight,â€ Corwin v.\r\n    Comptroller Gen., 6 S.C. 390, 399 (1875), and that â€œ[f]ractions of days are\r\n  not recognized in our laws.â€Â  Williams v. Halford, 64 S.C. 396, 402, 42\r\n  S.E. 187, 189 (1902).Â  Corwin interprets the word â€œdayâ€ in the\r\n  context of the South Carolina Constitutionâ€™s requirement that the Governor veto\r\n  and return a bill or resolution within three days (Sundays excepted) or the\r\n  bill shall become law,[2] and Williams dealt with the predecessor to Rule 6(a), SCRCPâ€™s rule on\r\n  computation of time, found in the 1893 Code of Civil Procedure at Â§ 407.Â  These\r\n  cases instruct that where a time requirement does not speak in terms of\r\n  specific hour periods, the Court will not interpret a day to mean anything\r\n  other than a calendar day.Â  See also Cleveland\r\n    v. Calvert, 54 S.C. 83, 86, 31 S.E. 871, 872 (1899) (applying Â§ 421 of the\r\n  1893 Code, the predecessor of the current publication statute, and concluding\r\n  that notice appearing twenty-one days prior to action complied with statutory\r\n  requirement of three weeksâ€™ notice).Â  We adhere to this pronouncement, and note\r\n  that where the legislature desires for the passage of a specific number of\r\n  hours to precede an action, it has shown a propensity for writing precisely\r\n  such a requirement.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  5-15-130 (2004) (containing a notice requirement of specific hours).\r\nThe fact that there\r\n  are multiple rules for computing time is not all together surprising.Â  As far\r\n  back as the 1870 Code, South Carolinaâ€™s statutory law contained separate rules\r\n  for computing time periods spelled out in procedural rules and time periods for\r\n  the publication of legal notices.Â  See 1870 Code of Civ. Pro. Â§Â§\r\n  421, 422.Â  Accordingly, old civil procedure cases relied on the version of the\r\n  procedural rule then in effect, and old publication cases pulled from the\r\n  applicable publication rule.Â  All of this\r\n  simply means that the method for computing time in a particular case may be prescribed\r\n  by statute, court rule, local ordinance, or some other authority, and the answer\r\n  we supply today is that where a time prescription mentions only the passage of\r\n  a number of days, a â€œdayâ€ means a calendar day, beginning and ending at\r\n  midnight.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold that summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the City of North Charleston on the question whether less than thirty days elapsed between April 28,\r\n  2005, the date Summerville published notice of its hearing, and May 27, 2005,\r\n  the date Summerville enacted its annexation ordinance.Â  The order of the\r\n  circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Summerville attempts to draw a distinction between a requirement of â€œnot less\r\n  than thirty daysâ€ and a fictional requirement of â€œat least thirty days,â€ but\r\n  this distinction suffers from a similar flaw.Â  If a brief filed in court must\r\n  be not less than four pages in length, a three and one-half page brief would\r\n  not suffice.\r\n[2] The requirement is now five days.

Savitz III, of South Carolina\r\n  Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for\r\n  Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General David Spencer, all of Columbia, and Ralph E. Hoisington, of\r\n  Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â Â Â Â  A\r\n  jury found Appellant Derringer Young (Young) guilty of kidnapping and assault\r\n  and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) as a lesser included\r\n  offense of criminal sexual conduct (CSC) stemming from a drug transaction with\r\n  a female victim.Â  Young appealed on the grounds that the trial court improperly\r\n  admitted evidence of prior convictions for CSC and criminal domestic violence\r\n  (CDV).Â  The court of appeals affirmed Youngâ€™s conviction and this Court granted\r\n  certiorari.Â  We affirm the decision of the court of appeals as modified.\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nYoung\r\n  was charged with kidnapping, first-degree CSC, and possession with intent to\r\n  distribute (PWID) stemming from a drug transaction with a female victim\r\n  (Victim).Â  Young pled guilty to the PWID charge and went to trial for the\r\n  remaining charges.Â  Young and Victim each testified at trial, giving different\r\n  accounts of the night in question.Â  \r\nVictim testified\r\n  that following dinner with her husband one evening, she drove to downtown Charleston alone to purchase crack cocaine for herself and her husband.Â  She had purchased\r\n  crack in this manner before and approached Young because he looked familiar\r\n  from her past dealings.Â  Victim sampled crack from Young and requested an\r\n  amount to buy.Â  Young did not have the desired amount on him, so Victim agreed\r\n  to give him a ride in her vehicle to find more crack to purchase.Â  \r\nWhile driving\r\n  around, Victim testified that she and Young smoked some of Youngâ€™s crack together.Â \r\n  Victim described Young as having a pleasant demeanor and testified that they\r\n  initially got along with no problems.Â  However, Victim claimed that after Young\r\n  was able to locate and purchase the additional crack she requested, Young became\r\n  angry when she told him she was going to take the crack home to smoke with her\r\n  husband.Â  Victim testified that at that point, Young hit her across the face\r\n  and in the back of the head.Â  Victim testified that Young forced his way into\r\n  the driverâ€™s seat, drove to a secluded area, tied Victimâ€™s hands together, and\r\n  raped her.Â  Afterwards, Young drove around downtown Charleston all night,\r\n  buying and selling crack out of Victimâ€™s car while Victim remained in the front\r\n  seat with her hands bound.Â  \r\nVictim recounted\r\n  that around nine oâ€™clock the next morning, a Charleston police officer spotted Young\r\n  and Victim in Victimâ€™s car in a parking lot behind an abandoned warehouse.Â \r\n  Victim mouthed â€œplease help meâ€ to the officer.Â  When Young saw the officer, he\r\n  jumped into the driverâ€™s seat and sped away.Â  Police located Young and Victim\r\n  about ten minutes later and immediately arrested Young.Â  Police noticed red\r\n  marks and bruising on Victimâ€™s wrists and neck, and Victim was taken\r\n  immediately to MUSC and given a rape exam, which was inconclusive as to whether\r\n  sexual assault had occurred.Â  Examiners also noted bruising on Victimâ€™s face,\r\n  neck, and arms, as well as marks on each wrist.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the State called its last witness at trial, Young raised the issue of the\r\n  admissibility of his prior convictions under Rule 609, SCRE, in an in camera hearing.Â  Young had prior convictions for third-degree CSC, third-degree\r\n  burglary, possession of a stolen vehicle, and failure to register as a sex\r\n  offender.Â  The trial court allowed the State to introduce evidence of Youngâ€™s\r\n  convictions for third-degree burglary and for possession of a stolen vehicle as\r\n  general impeachment evidence under Rule 609(a)(1) and (a)(2) for the purpose of\r\n  attacking Youngâ€™s credibility as a witness.Â  The trial court did not allow the\r\n  State to refer specifically to the prior CSC conviction, but instead allowed\r\n  the State to impeach Youngâ€™s credibility by referring to the prior CSC\r\n  conviction as â€œanother felony for which he has been convicted.â€[1]Â \r\n  The trial court also acknowledged that Young could open the door, via his\r\n  testimony, to the admissibility of other prior convictions, including specific\r\n  reference to the third-degree CSC conviction.\r\nFollowing the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s in camera ruling, Young testified to a drastically different version\r\n  of the facts surrounding his encounter with Victim.Â  Young recounted that he\r\n  sold crack to Victim and then rode in her car to a place where she could smoke\r\n  the crack discretely.Â  After Young and Victim finished smoking the crack Victim\r\n  had purchased, Young testified that Victim requested more crack, but she did\r\n  not have any money.Â  Young agreed to get the drugs for her because he trusted\r\n  her to pay him later.Â  Thereafter, for the next several hours, Young and Victim\r\n  smoked crack supplied by Young.\r\nAt one point, after\r\n  Young left the car to purchase drugs, another drug dealer began talking to\r\n  Victim.Â  Young said he became angry because he thought Victim was trying to\r\n  find another crack dealer.Â  Young further testified that at Victimâ€™s\r\n  insistence, the other drug dealer rode with them to a secluded spot where Young\r\n  exited the vehicle, and Victim performed oral sex on the other drug dealer in\r\n  exchange for crack cocaine.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  dropping off the other drug dealer, Young stated that he was upset with Victim\r\n  for demeaning herself and for betraying their â€œbond.â€ Â They continued to drive\r\n  around and smoke crack, and around 5 oâ€™clock in the morning, Victim became\r\n  upset about making Young angry.Â  According to Young, Victim began crying and seeking\r\n  Youngâ€™s forgiveness.Â  Young testified that he â€œhated[d] to see a female cryâ€\r\n  and forgave her.\r\nFollowing Youngâ€™s\r\n  direct examination, the State argued that Young opened the door to admission of\r\n  his prior convictions for CSC in the third degree and for CDV by introducing\r\n  evidence of his good character towards women with his comment about hating to\r\n  see a woman cry.Â  The trial judge ruled that Young had placed a character trait\r\n  in issue and therefore allowed the State to impeach Young by asking him about\r\n  his prior convictions for CDV and CSC. \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Young guilty of kidnapping and ABHAN as a lesser included offense of\r\n  CSC.Â  The trial court sentenced Young to concurrent sentences of twenty-two\r\n  years for kidnapping, ten years for ABHAN, and five years for the PWID charge.Â \r\n  Young appealed on the grounds that the trial court improperly admitted evidence\r\n  of Youngâ€™s prior convictions for CDV and CSC for impeachment purpose.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals affirmed Youngâ€™s convictions in State v. Young, 364\r\n  S.C. 476, 613 S.E.2d 386 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  This Court granted certiorari to\r\n  review the court of appealsâ€™ decision, and Young raises the following issue for\r\n  review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the court\r\n  of appeals err in affirming the admission of Youngâ€™s prior convictions for\r\n  impeachment purposes after Young â€œopened the doorâ€ with evidence of his good\r\n  character towards women?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nYoung\r\n  argues that he did not open the door so that his prior conviction for CSC and\r\n  CDV could be used to impeach him.Â  We agree.\r\nEvidence of a\r\n  defendantâ€™s character is generally not admissible to show a propensity to act\r\n  accordingly.Â  Rule 404(a)(1), SCRE.Â  However, when the accused offers evidence\r\n  of his good character regarding specific character traits relevant to the crime\r\n  charged, the solicitor has the right to cross-examine him as to particular bad\r\n  acts or conduct.Â  State v. Major, 301 S.C. 181, 391 S.E.2d 235 (1990).Â \r\n  The State is restricted to showing bad character only for the traits initially\r\n  focused on by the accused, and impeachment may be done by introducing prior\r\n  convictions with extrinsic evidence.Â  Id. at 185, 391 S.E.2d at\r\n  238.\r\nWe find that\r\n  Youngâ€™s testimony that he hated to see a woman cry did not open the door for\r\n  the admission of his prior CDV and CSC convictions.Â  Reading Youngâ€™s testimony\r\n  in its proper context, Young was not offering evidence of a specific character\r\n  trait towards women in general.Â  Rather, the isolated statement used to justify\r\n  admission of the prior CDV and CSC convictions was simply part of Youngâ€™s\r\n  narrative recounting his version of the events that occurred on the night in\r\n  question.Â  For this reason, the State was limited to presenting evidence\r\n  admissible under Rule 609, SCRE, to impeach Youngâ€™s credibility.Â  Pursuant to\r\n  Rule 609(a)(1), such evidence is limited to prior convictions for crimes\r\n  punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year, subject to Rule 403.Â \r\n  Additionally, Rule 609(a)(2) permits evidence of convictions for crimes\r\n  involving dishonesty.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, questioning Young generally on â€œanother felony for which he ha[d]\r\n  been convicted,â€ as the trial court properly permitted in the first instance\r\n  pursuant to Rule 609, SCRE, was entirely sufficient to impeach Youngâ€™s\r\n  credibility.Â  We find that the Stateâ€™s use of a specific prior conviction for\r\n  the same offense that Young was currently standing trial for was only a\r\n  thinly-veiled attempt to show propensity, rather than a sincere attempt at\r\n  impeachment of Youngâ€™s credibility.Â  For this reason, we hold that the trial\r\n  court erred in admitting Youngâ€™s prior CDV and CSC convictions to impeach\r\n  Young.Â  State v. Dunlap, 353 S.C. 539, 542, 579 S.E.2d 318, 320 (2003)\r\n  (ruling that when a prior crime is similar to the one for which the defendant\r\n  is being tried, the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant from\r\n  impeachment by the prior offense weighs against its admission); Green v.\r\n    State, 338 S.C. 428, 433-34, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 (2000) (finding that in\r\n  admitting evidence pursuant to Rule 609, the trial court must consider the\r\n  impeachment value of the prior crime, the timing of the prior crime, the\r\n  similarity between the past crime and the charged crime, the importance of the\r\n  defendantâ€™s testimony, and the centrality of the credibility issue).\r\nYoung\r\n  contends that because the trial court erred by admitting his prior CDV and CSC\r\n  convictions, his convictions in this case should be reversed.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  order for this Court to reverse a case based on erroneous admission of\r\n  evidence, prejudice must be shown.Â  State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 27, 393\r\n  S.E.2d 364, 369 (1990).Â  In this case, we find that the trial courtâ€™s error was\r\n  harmless.Â  The jury took all the evidence into account and acquitted Young of\r\n  CSC, indicating that the introduction of Youngâ€™s prior CDV and CSC convictions\r\n  did not affect the jury.Â  Furthermore, there was substantial evidence in the\r\n  record on which the jury could have found him guilty on the other charges.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm Youngâ€™s convictions for kidnapping and ABHAN.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court committed harmless error in\r\n  allowing the State to introduce Youngâ€™s prior convictions \r\nfor CDV and CSC.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals as modified and\r\n  affirm Youngâ€™s conviction for kidnapping and ABHAN.Â  \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice Diane\r\n  Schafer Goodstein, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The trial court did not allow introduction of the\r\n  conviction for failure to register as a sex offender, finding that it was not a\r\n  crime of dishonesty under Rule 609(a)(2), and that although the crime was punishable\r\n  by imprisonment in excess of one year, the prejudicial effect of the conviction\r\n  outweighed its probative value under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26494","title":"State v.

Greeley, of Rock Hill, for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  MOORE:Â  Respondent was indicted for\r\n  murder, assault and battery with intent to kill, possession of a firearm during\r\n  commission of a violent offense, assault with intent to kill, discharging a\r\n  firearm into an occupied vehicle, and possession of a pistol by a person under\r\n  21 years of age pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-30 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2007).\r\nRespondent argued\r\n  that the possession of a pistol indictment should be quashed because Â§\r\n  16-23-30(B) under which he was charged is unconstitutional.Â  The motion to\r\n  quash was granted by the trial court.Â  The State appeals and we affirm.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the trial court err by quashing\r\n  the indictment for possession of a handgun while under the age of 21 on the\r\n  ground that the criminal statute making such possession illegal is\r\n  unconstitutional?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWhen the issue is\r\n  the constitutionality of a statute,\r\n  every presumption will be made in favor of its validity\r\n  and no statute will be declared unconstitutional unless\r\n  its invalidity appears so clearly as to\r\n  leave no doubt that it conflicts with the constitution.Â  State v. Gaster,&nbsp;349\r\n  S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).Â  This presumption places the initial burden on\r\n  the party challenging the constitutionality of\r\n  the legislation to show it violates a provision of the Constitution.Â  State\r\n    v. White,&nbsp;348 S.C. 532, 560 S.E.2d 420, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 825 (2002).\r\n\r\n\tSection 16-23-30(A)\r\n  provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[i]t is\r\n  unlawful for a person to knowingly sell, offer to sell, deliver, lease, rent,\r\n  barter, exchange, or transport for sale into this State any handgun to:Â  (3) a\r\n  person under the age of twenty-one, but this shall not apply to the issue of\r\n  handguns to members of the [military or other like organizations or to those\r\n  receiving instruction on handgun use under the immediate supervision of a\r\n  parent or adult instructor].\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSubsection (B) states that\r\n  â€œ[i]t is unlawful for a person enumerated in subsection (A) to possess or\r\n  acquire handguns within this State.â€[1]\r\nRespondent argues\r\n  that because he was old enough to be sui juris and the state\r\n  constitution granted him the right to bear arms, then he could not be charged\r\n  with a crime for handgun possession.Â  See S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§ 20 (a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free\r\n  State, the right of the people to keep and bear\r\n  arms shall not be infringed).\r\nThe portions of Â§\r\n  16-23-30 regarding persons under the age of 21 do not violate the constitutional\r\n  right of a person under the age of 21 to keep and bear arms.Â  While a person\r\n  under the age of 21 is prohibited from possessing a handgun, except in certain\r\n  circumstances, this does not prevent a person under the age of 21 from possessing\r\n  other types of guns.Â  Our constitution simply requires that a personâ€™s right to\r\n  keep and bear â€œarmsâ€ not be infringed upon.Â  The legislatureâ€™s regulation of\r\n  who may have access to handguns does not infringe upon that right because\r\n  persons under the age of 21 have access to other types of guns.Â  Cf. State\r\n    v. Johnson, 76 S.C. 39, 56 S.E. 544 (1907) (city ordinance prohibiting\r\n  firing of guns within city limits is not unconstitutional as infringing on\r\n  right to bear arms); State v. Johnson, 16 S.C. 187 (1881) (purpose of\r\n  act was to prohibit, as far as consistent with a citizenâ€™s right to bear arms,\r\n  the carrying of deadly weapons, with a view to prevent acts of violence).[2]Â  Accordingly, Â§ 16-23-30 does not violate S.C. Const. Art. I, Â§\r\n  20, regarding a personâ€™s right to keep and bear arms.\r\nRespondent further\r\n  argues that Â§ 16-23-30 violates the state constitution because the age group of\r\n  18- to 20-year-olds is being treated differently than adults aged 21 and\r\n  above.Â  South Carolina Const. Art. XVII, Â§ 14, provides:\r\n\r\n\tEvery\r\n  citizen who is eighteen years of age or older, not laboring under disabilities\r\n  prescribed in this Constitution or otherwise established by law, Â shall be deemed\r\n\tsui juris and endowed with full legal rights and responsibilities, provided, \r\n\tthat\r\n  the General Assembly may restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons\r\n  until age twenty-one.\r\n\r\nArticle XVII, Â§ 14,\r\n  specifically makes reference to the fact the General Assembly can restrict the\r\n  sale of alcoholic beverages to persons until age 21.Â  By expressly allowing the\r\n  regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages to the 18- to 20-year-old age\r\n  group and not stating any other situation in which the General Assembly may restrict\r\n  the rights of this age group, the state constitution precludes the General\r\n  Assembly from prohibiting this age groupâ€™s possession of handguns.Â  See Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578\r\n    (2000) (the canon of construction â€œexpressio unius est exclusio\r\n      alteriusâ€ or â€œ inclusio unius est\r\n        exclusio alteriusâ€ holds that â€œto express or include one thing implies the\r\n  exclusion of another, or of the alternativeâ€); see also Strickland v.\r\n    Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 650 S.E.2d 465 (2007) (when interpreting a\r\n  statute, the words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without\r\n  resorting to subtle or forced construction which limit or expand the statuteâ€™s\r\n  operation).\r\nWe find the General\r\n  Assemblyâ€™s prohibition on hand gun possession by the 18-to 20-year old age\r\n  group does not infringe upon the right to bear arms; however, Â§ 16-23-30\r\n  violates the plain language of Article XVII, Â§ 14, of our state constitution.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The General Assembly recently passed and the Governor\r\n  signed a bill amending Â§ 16-23-30.Â  The amendment makes it unlawful for a\r\n  person under the age of eighteen to possess a handgun.Â  Therefore, the 18-to\r\n  20-year-old age group may now legally possess a handgun.Â  However, this\r\n  amendment does not apply to the instant case because the General Assembly\r\n  provided that this amendment does not affect pending actions. \r\n[2] See also Robertson v. City\r\n  and County of Denver, 874 P.2d 325 (Colo. 1994) (ban of assault weapons was\r\n  a reasonable exercise of police power despite the right to bear arms); Benjamin\r\n    v. Bailey, 662 A.2d 1226 (Conn. 1995) (ban on sale and possession of\r\n  assault weapons did not infringe on right to bear arms because access to a wide\r\n  array of weapons was still permitted); Mosby v. Devine, 851 A.2d 1031\r\n  (R.I. 2004) (right to possess a handgun, whether fundamental or not, is not\r\n  absolute and is subject to reasonable regulation; statute was not a total ban\r\n  on the right to bear arms).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26495","title":"Tisdale v.

Friedman, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Petitioner\r\n  was convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole.Â  His direct\r\n  appeal was dismissed after an Anders review.[1]Â \r\n  Petitioner then filed this application for post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\n  claiming counsel were ineffective for failing to request a charge on accident\r\n  or involuntary manslaughter.Â  PCR was denied.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe victim in this case was Lavelle Anderson\r\n  (Victim).Â  His decomposing nude body was found in a ditch in Berkeley County on October 2, 2000.Â  He had been shot twice in the head.Â  \r\nPetitioner and his co-defendant,\r\n  Anthony Dawson, were charged with murdering Victim on September 27 and\r\n  disposing of the body.Â  The Stateâ€™s theory of the case was that Victimâ€™s murder\r\n  was revenge for the killing of petitionerâ€™s brother in a drive-by shooting a\r\n  few days earlier.Â  \r\nAt trial, Dawson testified for the\r\n  State.Â  He stated that after the wake for petitionerâ€™s brother, he and\r\n  petitioner picked up Victim in a borrowed car.Â  Dawson was reclined in the\r\n  backseat because he had a headache, so Victim got in the front seat.Â  As they\r\n  drove down the interstate, Dawson heard petitioner and Victim talking but could\r\n  not hear their words until their voices became raised.Â  Victim began yelling\r\n  and called petitioner a â€œbitch.â€Â  Victim then punched petitioner in the face.Â \r\n  Petitioner pinned Victim against the passenger side of the car and was pulling\r\n  the car onto the shoulder of the road when Victim pulled a gun and shot at\r\n  petitioner.Â  Petitioner and Victim fought over the gun and one or two shots were\r\n  fired.Â  Dawson stated he did not know who had the gun when the shots were\r\n  fired, but he saw the gun in petitionerâ€™s hand after the shooting.Â  Petitioner\r\n  and Dawson put Victimâ€™s body in the trunk of the car and drove to a friendâ€™s\r\n  house for help disposing of the body. \r\nPetitioner testified he picked up\r\n  Victim because Victim had called him asking for a favor.Â  After Victim was in\r\n  the car and stated where he wanted to go, petitioner did not want to do it.Â \r\n  Victim then began yelling and punched petitioner in the face.Â  When petitioner\r\n  saw Victim pull a gun, they struggled over the weapon.Â  The gun went off while\r\n  it was still in Victimâ€™s hand and then Victim was still.Â  On cross-examination,\r\n  the solicitor asked:Â  â€œYour testimony is that that gun was never in your\r\n  hand?â€Â  Petitioner answered:Â  â€œIt was never in my hand until he was just\r\n  motionless.â€Â  \r\nDuring closing,\r\nthe solicitor argued:\r\n\r\n  [T]hey want you to believe that this\r\n    was an accident.Â  It is not self-defense.Â  It is not voluntary manslaughter.Â \r\n    And it is not involuntary manslaughter.Â  They want you to believe that it was\r\n    an accident and it is not murder.Â  No evidence supports that it was anything\r\n    other than an intentional act. \r\n\r\nThe trial judge charged voluntary manslaughter as a lesser\r\n  offense and self-defense.Â  On PCR, petitioner claimed counsel were ineffective\r\n  for failing to request charges on accident and involuntary manslaughter.Â  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, Counsel Brown\r\n  testified he was surprised by petitionerâ€™s testimony that the gun was in\r\n  Victimâ€™s hand and not petitionerâ€™s when it fired.Â  It did not occur to counsel\r\n  to request a charge on accident or involuntary manslaughter.Â  Co-counsel\r\n  confirmed that there was no discussion of accident or involuntary manslaughter. \r\nThe PCR judge found the fact that\r\n  Victim was shot twice â€œin the back of the headâ€[2] was completely inconsistent with either accident or involuntary manslaughter\r\n  and therefore counsel were not ineffective in failing to request these\r\n  charges.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Were counsel ineffective for\r\n    failing to request charges on accident and/or involuntary manslaughter?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is a\r\n  lesser included offense of murder only if there is evidence the killing was\r\n  unintentional.Â  State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.3d 364 (1996).[3]Â \r\n  Evidence of a struggle between the defendant and the victim over a weapon\r\n  supports submission of an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  Casey v. State,\r\n  305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 (1991).Â  Here, there is evidence of a struggle\r\n  over the gun.Â  The fact that Victimâ€™s wounds may have been inconsistent with\r\n  petitionerâ€™s testimony that the gun fired while in Victimâ€™s hand is not\r\n  overwhelming evidence that petitioner intentionally killed Victim. \r\nWithout citation of authority, the State argues\r\n  that because the jury rejected petitionerâ€™s claim of self-defense and found him\r\n  guilty of murder, the jury must have found malice and therefore petitioner\r\n  cannot show prejudice from the failure to submit involuntary manslaughter.[4]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  The Stateâ€™s argument essentially suggests that if a defendant is\r\n  found guilty of the greater offense, he can never challenge the failure to\r\n  submit a lesser offense because the jury must have found all the elements of\r\n  the greater.Â  To the contrary, the relevant test is whether there is any evidence that the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater\r\n  offense.Â  Casey v. State, supra.Â  Here, the evidence of a\r\n  struggle for the gun supports submission of a charge of involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.\r\nFurther, evidence of an accidental discharge of a\r\n  gun will support a charge of accident where the defendant lawfully arms himself\r\n  in self-defense.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999); see also State v. Cameron, 137 S.C. 371, 135 S.E. 364 (1926)\r\n  (approving charge of accident where gun accidentally discharged during\r\n  struggle).Â  Here, the evidence indicates Victim was the aggressor by punching\r\n  petitioner in the face and then shooting at him.Â  This evidence, along with\r\n  evidence the gun discharged accidentally, supports a charge of accident.\r\nThe denial of PCR is REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).\r\n[2]A pathologist testified at trial that the bullet\r\n  wounds were to the left side of the head slightly behind the ear.\r\n[3]Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another\r\n  without malice and unintentionally while engaged in either:Â  (1) an unlawful\r\n  act not amounting to a felony and not naturally tending to cause death or great\r\n  bodily harm;Â  or (2) a lawful act with reckless disregard for the safety of\r\n  others.Â  State v. Reese, 370 S.C. 31, 633 S.E.2d 898 (2006).\r\n[4]We rejected this analysis in the context of murder and voluntary manslaughter.Â  State v.

(SCARE).Â  The order stated the following in\r\n  pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  On August 21, 2003 a Search Warrant was issued against the\r\n    Defendant(s) â€¦ for the seizure of neglected and maltreated livestock,\r\n    including, but not limited to horses.\r\n  IT IS ORDERED THAT the livestock, including but not limited to the\r\n    horses, are [sic] hereby placed in the protective custody of [SCARE], and\r\n    further that the animals remain on the property for assessment and medial\r\n    treatment and care, as deemed necessary by SCARE and their [sic] agents.\r\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that agents acting for or on behalf of SCARE\r\n    will have access to these animals for the purposes stated above, and that the\r\n    removal of these animals are [sic] at the sole discretion of SCARE and its\r\n    agents.\r\n\r\n(â€œAugust Orderâ€).\r\nWhen the first search warrant was executed on Friday, August 22,\r\n  2003, SCARE effectuated an â€œon-siteâ€ seizure of the horses pursuant to the\r\n  August Order.Â  This allowed for on-site assessments by veterinarians during the\r\n  following few days.Â  However, as the week went on, SCARE decided to remove the\r\n  horses from appellantsâ€™ property, which happened on Saturday, August 30, 2003.Â  \r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-1-150(C)(2) (Supp. 2007), a hearing\r\n  was supposed to be held within three days of the animalsâ€™ seizure to determine whether the owners were â€œfit to have custody of the\r\n  animal.â€Â  Although a hearing apparently was scheduled\r\n  for September 16, 2003, no one from the State appeared.[1]Â  On September 17, 2003, appellants moved to vacate the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s August Order.Â  Appellants based their request on due process\r\n  grounds because there had been no hearing as required by statute.\r\nA hearing on the motion was held on October 1, 2003.Â  The\r\n  magistrate agreed with appellantsâ€™ due process argument and found that SCARE\r\n  had failed to request a post&#8209;seizure hearing to determine whether\r\n  appellants could adequately care for the horses. Â See Â§ 47-1-150(C)(2). Â As\r\n  a remedy, appellants sought the immediate return of their horses.Â  The\r\n  magistrate disagreed and instead ordered SCARE to petition the court for the\r\n  hearing contemplated by the statute.Â  (â€œOctober Orderâ€).Â  \r\nSpecifically, the magistrate concluded in the written order as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  It is the ruling of this court that S.C. Code Â§ 47-1-150 requires\r\n    a hearing be sought within 24 hours after the seizure of an animal pursuant to\r\n    any subsection of this statute.Â  Based on that holding, this court finds that\r\n    SCARE failed to comply with the requirements of the statute when it failed to\r\n    petition for a hearingâ€¦.Â  However, the appropriate remedy is the holding of\r\n      the hearing required by this code section rather than the immediate return of\r\n      the horses to an environment that could potentially be harmful to them.\r\n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that SCARE shall immediately comply with\r\n    the hearing requirement of S.C. Code Â§ 47-1-150(C)(2).\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Prior to that hearing taking place, however, appellants filed for\r\n  circuit court review of the magistrateâ€™s decision.[2]\r\nWhile the appeal was pending, appellants were indicted in February\r\n  2004 on 60 counts each of ill treatment of animals.[3]Â  In June 2004, they were each\r\n  convicted of four counts, but acquitted on the other 56 counts.Â  They were\r\n  sentenced in December 2004.Â  Except for the forfeiture of the four horses which\r\n  were the subject of the convictions, no decision was made on the custody of the\r\n  other 56 horses.[4]Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 25, 2005, the circuit court issued a Form 4 order which found that the\r\n  horses had been properly removed.Â  Appellants filed a motion for\r\n  reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  The circuit court did not rule\r\n  on the reconsideration motion until March 2007 when it denied the\r\n  motion.Â  In the written order, the circuit court found no post-seizure hearing\r\n  was required, and even so, noted that appellants had â€œdeclinedâ€ the hearing the\r\n  magistrate had ordered.Â  These two circuit court orders are the subject of the\r\n  instant appeal.[5]\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit court\r\n  err by finding that no post-seizure hearing was required under S.C. Code Ann. &sect;\r\n  47-1-150(A) or &sect; 47-1-150 (C)(1)?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit court\r\n  err when it refused to order the return of appellants&rsquo; horses?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.\r\n    Did the circuit court\r\n  err in finding that appellants had waived their right to a hearing?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Post-seizure hearing under Section 47-1-150\r\nAppellants first\r\n  argue that the circuit court erred by essentially reversing the magistrateâ€™s\r\n  ruling that a post-seizure hearing was required under section\r\n  47-1-150.Â  We agree.\r\nSection\r\n  47-1-150 appears in the chapter entitled â€œCruelty to Animalsâ€ and is entitled â€œIssuance of search warrant; purpose of section;\r\n  motions regarding custody of animal; notice; care, disposal of, or return of\r\n  animal.â€Â  It is, admittedly,\r\n  a confusingly drafted statute, which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  (A) When complaint is made on\r\n    oath or affirmation to any magistrate authorized to issue warrants in criminal\r\n    cases that the complainant believes and has reasonable cause to believe that\r\n    the laws in relation to cruelty to animals have been or are being violated in\r\n    any particular building or place, such magistrate, if satisfied that there is\r\n    reasonable cause for such belief, shall issue a search warrant authorizing [law\r\n    enforcement] to search such building or placeâ€¦.Â  If an animal is seized\r\n    pursuant to this section and the South Carolina Society for the Prevention of\r\n    Cruelty of Animals, or other society incorporated for that purpose is involved\r\n    with the seizure, the animal may be held pending criminal disposition of the\r\n    case at a facility maintained or contracted by that agency.\r\n  (B)\r\n    The purpose of this section is to provide a means by which a neglected or\r\n    mistreated animal can be:\r\n  (1) removed from its present\r\n    custody, or\r\n  (2) made the subject of an order to provide care,\r\n    issued to its owner by the magistrate or municipal judge, any law enforcement\r\n    officer, or any agent of the county or of the South Carolina Society for the\r\n    Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or any society incorporated for that purpose\r\n    and given protection and an appropriate and humane disposition made.\r\n  (C) Any law enforcement\r\n    officer or any agent of any county or of the South Carolina Society for the\r\n    Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or any society incorporated for that purpose\r\n    may move before a magistrate for an order to:\r\n  (1) lawfully take custody of any animal found\r\n    neglected or cruelly treated by removing the animal from its present location\r\n    if deemed by the court that removal is necessary to prevent further suffering\r\n    or ill-treatment, or\r\n  (2) order the owner\r\n    of any animal found neglected or cruelly treated to provide certain care to the\r\n    animal at the ownerâ€™s expense without removal of the animal from its present\r\n    location, and shall forthwith petition the magistrate or municipal judge of\r\n      the county or municipality wherein the animal is found for a hearing, to be set\r\n      within twenty-four hours after the date of seizure of the animal or issuance of\r\n      the order to provide care and held not more than two days after the setting of\r\n      such date, to determine whether the owner, if known, is able to provide\r\n      adequately for the animal and is fit to have custody of the animal.Â  The\r\n    hearing shall be concluded, and the court order entered the date the hearing is\r\n    commenced. No fee shall be charged for the filing of the petition. Nothing\r\n    herein is intended to require court action for the taking into custody and\r\n    making proper disposition of stray or abandoned animals as lawfully performed\r\n    by animal control agents.\r\n\r\nÂ§ 47-1-150 (emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  above-emphasized language in section 47-1-150(C)(2) is the hearing requirement\r\n  at issue.Â  Respondent argues, and the circuit court found, that a post-seizure\r\n  hearing is not required if the animals are seized pursuant to section\r\n  47-1-150(A) or (C)(1), because the language regarding the hearing is located in\r\n  section 47-1-150(C)(2), and the sections 47-1-150(C)(1) and (C)(2) are\r\n  separated by the word â€œor.â€Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  we agree with appellants, that a hearing was required.[6]Â \r\n  The language in section 47-1-150(C)(2) very clearly contemplates that whether\r\n  the animal is â€œseized and removedâ€ (presumably under Â§ 47-1-150(C)(1) and/or arguably\r\n  under Â§ 47-1-150(A) by search warrant); or the animal is seized but remains\r\n  on-site for its care (under Â§ 47-1-150(C)(2) which permits an order to provide\r\n  care to the animal without removing it); a hearing is supposed to be held\r\n  within three days of the seizure.[7]\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the magistrate correctly found that a hearing should have been\r\n  requested by SCARE under Â§ 47-1-150, and therefore, the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding no hearing was required.\r\n2.Â  Refusal to Return\r\n  Horses\r\nNext, appellants argue the circuit court erred by not ordering the\r\n  immediate return of their â€œillegally seized horses.â€[8]Â  Appellants contend that because they\r\n  were acquitted on 56 charges, those 56 horses are not subject to forfeiture.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nSection 47-1-150(F) provides that whoever takes charge of an\r\n  animal under the statute:\r\n\r\n  [S]hall provide for the\r\n    animal until either:Â  \r\n  (1) The\r\n    owner is adjudged by the court to be able to provide adequately for, and have\r\n    custody of, the animal, in which case the animal shall be returned to the owner\r\n    upon payment for the care and provision of the animal while in the agentâ€™s or\r\n    officerâ€™s custody; or\r\n  (2) The\r\n    animal is turned over to the officer or agent as provided in Section 47-1-170\r\n    and a humane disposition of the animal is made.\r\n\r\nIn our\r\n  opinion, section 47-1-150(F)(1) applies to the 56 horses at issue (plus their offspring).Â \r\n  Therefore, some type of hearing and fact-finding are required to determine\r\n  whether appellants are able to adequately provide for the horses.Â  If so, the\r\n  horses may be returned upon payment for their care.Â  Id.\r\nThus,\r\n  we reject appellantsâ€™ contention that the circuit court erred by refusing to order the return of appellantsâ€™ horses. Â In\r\n  addition, we find a remand to the magistrate is necessary to determine whether\r\n  appellants are now able to adequately provide care for these horses.Â  If\r\n  appellants are deemed able to care for the horses, the return of the horses may\r\n  be ordered, provided that appellants make the requisite payments envisioned by\r\n  section 47-1-150(F)(1).\r\n3.Â  Waiver\r\nFinally,\r\n  appellants take issue with the circuit courtâ€™s statement that they â€œrefusedâ€ or\r\n  â€œdeclinedâ€ their opportunity for a hearing offered by the magistrate.Â \r\n  Appellants claim this inappropriately penalizes them for exercising their right\r\n  to appeal the magistrateâ€™s order.\r\nRespondent makes several arguments why this entire appeal should\r\n  be dismissed, with one argument focusing on waiver.[9]Â  Respondent contends appellants\r\n  waived their opportunity to have the hearing to which they were entitled by\r\n  strategically deciding to file an appeal.Â  In supportÂ  of this argument,\r\n  respondent cites Erickson v. Jones St.\r\n    Publishers, LLC, 368 S.C. 444, 476,\r\n  629 S.E.2d 653, 670&nbsp;(2006), and other cases, for the general proposition\r\n  that â€œa party may not complain on appeal of error or object to a trial\r\n  procedure which his own conduct has induced.â€\r\nAlthough\r\n  we are somewhat bothered by the fact that appellants did not avail themselves\r\n  of the post-seizure hearing the magistrate ordered in his October Order, we\r\n  find appellants arguably were aggrieved by the magistrateâ€™s order, and\r\n  therefore believed they had a right to an appeal.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  decline to dismiss this appeal.Â  Instead, given the somewhat unusual factual\r\n  and procedural posture of this case, we find the appropriate remedy is a remand\r\n  for a hearing in front of the magistrate, as discussed above.[10]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that appellants were not entitled to\r\n  a post-seizure hearing.Â  We remand this matter to the magistrate for a hearing to\r\n  determine whether appellants are able to provide adequately for the animals and\r\n  are fit to have custody of the animals.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On September 15, 2003, appellants were arrested on\r\n  charges related to ill treatment of animals.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  47-1-40 (Supp. 2007). The arrests occurred after the seizure of the\r\n  horses, but prior to this scheduled hearing.\r\n[2] Appellantsâ€™ counsel at the October 1, 2003 hearing\r\n  told the magistrate that he was â€œprobably not going to attend the hearingâ€ and\r\n  instead would file an appeal.Â  Nonetheless, the magistrate indicated he would\r\n  â€œset the hearing up.â€ \r\n[3] Colie G. Martin, III was\r\n  indicted for ill treatment, second offense, while Colie G. Martin, Jr. was\r\n  indicted for conspiracy to commit ill treatment of animals\r\n[4] It appears that because the appeal to the circuit\r\n  court was still pending on the magistrateâ€™s decision, the sentencing court did\r\n  not rule on the other horses, believing it to be a civil matter.\r\n[5] Meanwhile, in July 2006, appellants filed a separate\r\n  civil action against respondent, SCARE, and Janice Carter, SCAREâ€™s executive\r\n  director.Â  In their complaint, appellants alleged replevin, conversion,\r\n  defamation, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, intentional infliction of\r\n  emotional distress, negligence, and civil conspiracy.Â  Regarding the horses,\r\n  appellants sought the return of their horses, including the offspring of the\r\n  horses that had originally been seized.Â  Apparently, that lawsuit has been\r\n  stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.\r\n[6] We note the August Order issued by the magistrate in\r\n  effect ordered an on-site seizure by SCARE and also granted SCARE the authority\r\n  to remove the animals.Â  Arguably, then, the magistrateâ€™s order was a hybrid\r\n  version of what is contemplated by sections 47-1-150(C)(1) and (C)(2).\r\n[7] The parties both have cited Floridaâ€™s version of the\r\n  statute which has some language that is virtually identical to South Carolinaâ€™s version, but the statute is formatted differently:\r\n\r\n  (2) Any law enforcement officer or any agent of any\r\n    county or of any society or association for the prevention of cruelty to\r\n    animals appointed under the provisions of s. 828.03 may:\r\n    (a)\r\n    Lawfully take custody of any animal found neglected or cruelly treated by\r\n    removing the animal from its present location, or\r\n    (b)\r\n    Order the owner of any animal found neglected or cruelly treated to provide\r\n    certain care to the animal at the owner's expense without removal of the animal\r\n    from its present location,\r\n  and shall forthwith petition the\r\n  county court judge of the county wherein the animal is found for a hearing, to\r\n  be set within 30 days after the date of seizure of the animal or issuance of\r\n  the order to provide care and held not more than 15 days after the setting of\r\n  such date, to determine whether the owner, if known, is able to provide\r\n  adequately for the animal and is fit to have custody of the animal. The hearing\r\n  shall be concluded and the court order entered thereon within 60 days after the\r\n  date the hearing is commenced  â€¦.\r\n\r\nFla. Stat. Ann. Â§ 828.073(2).Â  We agree with appellants\r\n  that Floridaâ€™s layout of this section indicates that the envisioned hearing\r\n  relates to both subsection (a) and (b).Â  Likewise, we find the hearing\r\n  requirement located in Â§ 47-1-150(C)(2) relates to both Â§Â§ 47-1-150 (C)(1) and\r\n  (C)(2).\r\n[8] Appellants do not challenge the forfeiture of the\r\n  four horses which resulted from their four convictions.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 45-1-170 (Supp. 2007) (person who is convicted of animal cruelty â€œforfeits ownership, charge, or custody of the animal and at the\r\n  discretion of the court, the person who is charged with or convicted of a\r\n  violation of this chapter must be ordered to pay costs incurred to care for the\r\n  animal and related expenses.â€).\r\n[9] In addition to waiver, respondent argues the appeal\r\n  is moot and is barred by res judicata because the criminal action has\r\n  been finalized and there was no motion to suppress the evidence seized by the\r\n  search warrant.Â  We agree with appellants that these claims are without merit. \r\n[10] Of course, we note with some irony that this was the\r\n  initial relief granted to appellants by the magistrate back in 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
