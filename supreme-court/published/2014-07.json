Rhoden, of Gaffney, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Attorney General Alan McCrory Wilson and Assistant\r\n            Attorney General John Benjamin Aplin, both of\r\n            Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his\r\nrequest for a full evidentiary hearing before the circuit court determined whether\r\nappellant's indecent exposure pleas should be classified as sexually violent\r\noffenses for purposes of the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the SVP Act). S.C.\r\nCode Ann. §§ 44-48-10 et seq. (Supp. 2013). Under the facts of this case, we find\r\nno error in the circuit court's denial of appellant's request and therefore affirm.\r\n\n                                      FACTS\n\r\n\r\nAppellant pled guilty to two counts of indecent exposure in violation of S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 16-15-130 (Supp. 2013) and was sentenced to two consecutive three-year\r\nterms, with credit for 253 days already served. At the plea hearing, the solicitor\r\nstated that appellant had repeatedly exposed himself to the two female victims,\r\nages 13 and 15, made numerous phone calls to the victims asking them to \"do\r\nthings of a sexual nature,\" and committed other acts of a sexual nature in their\r\npresence. When asked if he agreed with the solicitor's recitation of the facts,\r\nappellant, who had been sworn, acknowledged that he had exposed himself \"to\r\nboth victims one time\" and denied the rest of the solicitor's recitation. Appellant\r\nthen confirmed he was pleading guilty to one count of indecent exposure to each\r\nvictim and that his answers were truthful and honest. Appellant also\r\nacknowledged that he had a 1994 conviction for lewd act on a minor and that he\r\nwas on the sex offender registry as a result of that conviction.\r\n\r\nFollowing appellant's affirmations, one of the victims and the girls' parents gave\r\nunsworn statements1 which described numerous criminal sexual offenses\r\ncommitted by appellant against the girls. The solicitor then asked the judge to\r\nexercise his discretion and deem appellant's indecent exposure pleas \"sexually\r\nviolent\" offenses pursuant to § 44-48-30(2)(o). This statute permits a judge to\r\ndesignate any offense as sexually violent for purposes of the SVP Act if he \"makes\r\na specific finding on the record that based on the circumstances of the case . . . .\"\r\n\r\nAppellant's counsel contended that the only circumstance of this case which could\r\nbe considered in making the sexually violent offense decision was that appellant\r\nhad, on one occasion, exposed himself to each victim. He argued that before\r\nmaking a finding under 2(o), the court must hold a \"full evidentiary hearing\"\r\nincluding testimony and an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses. He pointed\r\nout that the State was relying on the unsworn statements of the victims. In\r\naddition, the attorney noted that appellant's status as a registered sex offender was\r\nthe result of an old conviction.2 Appellant, still under oath, admitted his wrongful\r\n\r\n1 One victim spoke directly to the court while the father of the other read his\r\ndaughter's statement. This father also spoke on behalf of himself and his wife and\r\nthe other victim's mother made a statement to the court.\r\n2 The predicate conviction was in 1994: appellant was pleading guilty in 2012 to\r\noffenses occurring in 2009-2010.\r\n\nconduct and apologized, and pointed out he had been \"clean\" for almost twenty\r\nyears, and stated, \"I'd just like to take [sic] and have some help, be able to get some\r\ncounseling from somewhere . . . .\" He subsequently repeated his request for \"some\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\nAppellant's attorney reiterated his position that an evidentiary hearing was a\r\nnecessary prerequisite for the determination whether appellant's offenses should be\r\nconsidered sexually violent under (2)(o). The judge then made this ruling:\r\n\r\n             I agree with both the State and the defense. I think that if I\r\n             were going to make factual determinations based upon what the\r\n             victims have -- or what's said in court, I think the defendant\r\n             would have a Constitutional Right to cross-examination.\r\n             However, for purposes of sexual violent predator evaluation, I\r\n             believe that the defendant's statements alone and also his\r\n             history puts him into that category where somebody needs to\r\n             take a look at it. He, himself, is asking me to give him help for\r\n             his problem, and that's part of what the civil commitment\r\n             process would do. It would allow professionals to evaluate him\r\n             to do what type of civil treatment he would need. He may not\r\n             qualify for that program, but, you know, when they go through\r\n             that, they have multi-step processes they go through. They\r\n             have the solicitors committee. They have a prosecutors\r\n             committee. They have different people take a look at it. It may\r\n             be that they believe that he does not fall within that definition,\r\n             he does not need to be evaluated. They may feel that he does,\r\n             but I have indicated on the sentencing sheet my desire that he\r\n             be evaluated for the sexually violent predator program and let\r\n             those people make that determination based on these charges.\r\n\r\nAppellant's counsel asked as a matter of clarification: \"Is the court making a\r\nspecific finding under [§ 44-48-30(2)(o)] concerning this particular act as being a\r\nsexually violent offense?\" The trial judge responded:\r\n\r\n             Yes, based upon the information that's been presented to the\r\n             court. This country [sic] probably [sic] does not even consider\r\n             the actual statements that have been made by the victim. I\r\n             believe that it's based on the allegations that he has admitted to;\r\n             his own statements to me that he needs that help; his criminal\r\n\n             history; the fact that he's already on the sex offender registry,\r\n             these charges would place him on the sex offender registry. I\r\n             think the State has met that burden;3 that that's enough for me to\r\n             make that finding for purposes for the evaluation process for\r\n             the SVP statute.\r\n\r\nThis appeal followed.                  ISSUE\r\n\r\n             Did the circuit court judge err in denying appellant's request for\r\n             a full evidentiary hearing before determining whether\r\n             appellant's offense should be classified as sexually violent for\r\n             purposes of the SVP Act?\r\n\r\n                                    ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSection 44-48-30(2) of the SVP Act lists numerous offenses which are designated\r\n\"sexually violent offenses.\" In subsection (2)(o), the statute contains a catch-all\r\nprovision which allows the judge to designate a crime not otherwise named in the\r\nstatute as sexually violent \"based on the circumstances of the case.\" Designation\r\nof an offense as sexually violent triggers the operation of the SVP Act. This Act\r\nrequires that inmates convicted of sexually violent offenses be evaluated before\r\nexpiration of their sentences, and if they are found to meet the SVP Act's criteria,\r\npermits the State to seek the inmate's civil commitment to the Department of\r\nMental Health for an indefinite period of time after service of their criminal\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that we should require a full evidentiary hearing whenever an\r\noffense is sought to be classified as \"sexually violent\" under 2(o). We hold that the\r\nscope and necessity of a separate evidentiary hearing is to be determined on a case-\r\nby-case basis. Here, the judge stated his decision to classify appellant's offenses as\r\nsexually violent was based on the circumstances of the case, that is, appellant's\r\n\r\n3 It is unclear why the trial judge made this reference to the State's burden. As we\r\nread the statute, there is no burden of proof or persuasion placed upon either party\r\nand in fact the circuit judge placed no burden on the State. Indeed, the statute vests\r\nthe trial/plea judge with the discretion to make a finding that an offense should be\r\nclassified as sexually violent, even in the absence of a request by the State.\r\n\nstatus as a registered sex offender, his sworn admission that he exposed himself to\r\nthe minor victims, and his requests for help, as well as his prior conviction for a\r\nlewd act on a minor. We find no error in the procedure utilized here where the\r\ncircuit court's decision was based on the uncontested facts in the record, all of\r\nwhich were specificially acknowledged by appellant under oath. Under these\r\ncircumstances, we find no error in the circuit judge's ruling declining appellant's\r\nrequest for a separate evidentiary hearing.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAppellant's convictions, sentences, and the circuit court judge's decision to classify\r\nappellant's indecent exposure offenses as sexually violent are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27405","title":"State v.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. State v. Burgess,\r\n\n393 S.C. 396, 712 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 2011). Following the denial of his petition\r\nfor rehearing, Burgess petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\ndecision. We granted the petition to analyze whether: (1) the multi-jurisdictional\r\ndrug-enforcement agreement, which formed the purported basis of the arresting\r\nofficer's authority to arrest Burgess outside of the officer's territorial jurisdiction,\r\nsatisfied the statutory prerequisites to constitute a valid agreement; and (2) Burgess\r\nshould have been permitted to cross-examine the arresting officer with his\r\npersonnel records pursuant to Rule 608(c) of the South Carolina Rules of\r\nEvidence. Although we find the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed Burgess's\r\nconviction, we disagree with the court's conclusion regarding the multi-\r\njurisdictional drug-enforcement agreement. Accordingly, we affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n                        I.     Factual / Procedural History\r\n\r\n        On March 2, 2006, officers with the Lexington County Narcotics\r\nEnforcement Team (NET) executed a search warrant for a trailer at 7120 Two\r\nNotch Road in Batesburg, South Carolina, which had been the site of several\r\ncontrolled drug buys. When Agent Billy Laney of the Lexington County Sheriff's\r\nDepartment and Officer Emmitt Gilliam of the Batesburg-Leesville Police\r\nDepartment pulled into the driveway, they saw Burgess and another individual\r\nstanding by a trailer that was not the target of the search warrant. The officers then\r\nwitnessed Burgess run around the back of the trailer. Officer Gilliam ran around\r\nthe other side of the trailer \"to cut him off.\" When Officer Gilliam got within five\r\nto six feet of Burgess, he commanded him to stop and put his hands up. Officer\r\nGilliam placed Burgess under arrest and handcuffed him with the assistance of\r\nAgent Eric Kirkland of the Lexington County Sheriff's Department. Agent Laney\r\n\"backtracked\" Burgess's steps to where Burgess had been standing and discovered\r\na pill bottle top and pieces of crack cocaine on the ground. The substance found on\r\nthe ground was chemically tested and determined to be 5.67 grams of crack\r\ncocaine. As a result, a Lexington County grand jury indicted Burgess for\r\npossession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute.\r\n\r\n       In a pre-trial hearing, Burgess moved to dismiss the charge for lack of\r\njurisdiction. Burgess asserted that Officer Gilliam lacked authority to arrest\r\nBurgess in an area outside the officer's territorial jurisdiction of the Batesburg-\r\nLeesville town limits. Although the State maintained that the Lexington County\r\nMulti-Agency Narcotics Enforcement Team Agreement (NET Agreement)\r\nconferred authority for extra-territorial jurisdiction, Burgess disputed its validity on\r\n\nthe ground it failed to comply with the statutory prerequisites of sections 23-1-2101\r\nand 23-1-2152 of the South Carolina Code.\r\n\r\n1 At the time of the agreement's execution, section 23-1-210 provided in relevant\r\npart:  (A) Any municipal or county law enforcement officer may be\r\n       transferred on a temporary basis to work in law enforcement in any\r\n       other municipality or county in this State under the conditions set\r\n       forth in this section, and when so transferred shall have all powers and\r\n       authority of a law enforcement officer employed by the jurisdiction to\r\n       which he is transferred.\r\n\r\n       (B) Prior to any transfer as authorized in subsection (A), the\r\n       concerned municipalities or counties shall enter into written\r\n       agreements stating the conditions and terms of the temporary\r\n       employment of officers to be transferred. The bond for any officer\r\n       transferred shall include coverage for his activity in the municipality\r\n       or county to which he is transferred in the same manner and to the\r\n       same extent provided by bonds of regularly employed officers of that\r\n       municipality or county.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 23-1-210 (2007) (emphasis added). In 2007, subsection (A) was\r\namended to provide that \"[a]ny municipal or county law enforcement officer may\r\nbe transferred or assigned on a temporary basis to work in law enforcement within\r\nmultijurisdictional task forces established for the mutual aid and benefit of the\r\nparticipating jurisdictions.\" Act No. 3, 2007 S.C. Acts 4 (emphasis added).\r\n2   Section 23-1-215 provided in relevant part:\r\n\r\n       (A) In the event of a crime where multiple jurisdictions, either\r\n       county or municipal, are involved, law enforcement officers are\r\n       authorized to exercise jurisdiction within other counties or\r\n       municipalities for the purpose of criminal investigation only if a\r\n       written agreement between or among the law enforcement agencies\r\n       involved has been executed. This limitation on law enforcement\r\n       activity shall not apply to any activity authorized by § 17-13-40.\r\n\r\n       (B) Any law enforcement officer working under this agreement is\r\n       vested with equal authority and jurisdiction outside his resident\r\n\n       Initially, Burgess argued that section 23-1-215 was the controlling statute\r\nbecause it provides authority for the institution of \"agreements between multiple\r\nlaw enforcement jurisdictions.\" Because the governing bodies of Batesburg-\r\nLeesville and Lexington County were not provided written notice of the NET\r\nAgreement's execution as required by subsection (E) of section 23-1-215, Burgess\r\nclaimed the agreement was invalid. Additionally, Burgess asserted that section 23-\r\n1-210 did not apply to the NET Agreement as that section is limited \"to the\r\ntemporary transfer of an officer.\" In the alternative, he argued that the agreement\r\ndid not comply with section 23-1-210 because it was executed by law enforcement\r\nofficers and not by \"council members.\"\r\n\r\n      In response to Burgess's motion, the State presented a copy of the NET\r\nAgreement that was entered into by eleven law enforcement agencies in Lexington\r\nCounty3 on September 18, 2001.4 The NET Agreement, which referenced sections\r\n23-1-210 and 23-1-215,5 stated in relevant part:\r\n\r\n      jurisdiction for the purpose of investigation, arrest, or any other\r\n      activity related to the criminal activity for which the agreement was\r\n      drawn.\r\n\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      (E) The respective governing bodies of the political subdivisions,\r\n      wherein each of the law enforcement agencies entering into the\r\n      agreement authorized in subsection (A) is located, must be notified by\r\n      its agency of the agreement's execution and termination. The\r\n      notification must be in writing and accomplished within seventy-two\r\n      hours of the agreement's execution and within seventy-two hours of\r\n      the agreement's termination.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 23-1-215 (2007) (emphasis added). In 2007, this code section\r\nwas amended. Act No. 3, 2007 S.C. Acts 5. This amendment, however, does not\r\naffect the disposition of this case.\r\n3 The agencies included Batesburg-Leesville Police Department, Cayce\r\nDepartment of Public Safety, Chapin Police Department, Columbia Metropolitan\r\nAirport Police Department, Gaston Police Department, Irmo Police Department,\r\nLexington County Sheriff's Department, Pine Ridge Police Department, South\r\nCongaree Police Department, Springdale Police Department, and West Columbia\r\nPolice Department.\r\n\n             WHEREAS, it is the desire and intent of the parties to evidence\r\n      their joint undertaking for the provision of mutual assistance in\r\n      criminal narcotics investigations by the creation and operation of a\r\n      multijurisdictional task force within Lexington County.\r\n\r\n             WHEREAS, the parties as set out above, by and through their\r\n      representatives affixing their signatures below, consent and agree to\r\n      span the geopolitical boundaries of all areas of Lexington County to\r\n      the fullest extent allowed under South Carolina law for the express\r\n      purpose of investigating the illegal use of controlled substances and\r\n      related crimes by creating this Lexington County Multi-Agency\r\n      Narcotics Enforcement Team [.]\r\n\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      1. SCOPE OF SERVICES\r\n\r\n          It is agreed that the law enforcement agency parties shall assign, on\r\n          a temporary basis, officers to participate in the Lexington County\r\n          Multijurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit for the duration of this\r\n          agreement or until this agreement is rescinded as set forth herein.\r\n\r\n      2. TERM AND RENEWAL\r\n\r\n          This agreement is effective as to each party at the date and time of\r\n          signing and will automatically renew one year from the above date\r\n          unless a party exercises its right to terminate as further described\r\n          herein.\r\n\r\n4 The NET Agreement was amended in May 2002 and July 2005 to add other law\r\nenforcement agencies; however, the substantive provisions of the agreement\r\nremained the same.\r\n5 The NET Agreement also referenced Article VIII, Section 13 of the South\r\nCarolina Constitution and section 17-13-45 of the South Carolina Code. These\r\nsections, however, are not at issue in the instant case. See S.C. Const. art. VIII, §\r\n13 (authorizing joint administration of functions and exercise of powers among\r\ncounties, municipalities, or other political subdivisions of the State); S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 17-13-45 (2003) (providing authority for law enforcement responding to\r\ndistress call or request for assistant in an adjacent jurisdiction).\r\n\n      3. VESTING OF AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION\r\n\r\n          To the fullest extent permitted by the Constitution and statutes of\r\n          this State, officers assigned under this agreement and so transferred\r\n          shall be vested with authority, jurisdiction, rights, immunities, and\r\n          privileges to include the authority to execute criminal process and\r\n          the power of arrest as any other duly commissioned officer of any\r\n          other party.\r\n\r\n          ....\r\n\r\n      10. RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPECTIVE GOVERNING BODIES\r\n\r\n          Each party is responsible for any notice, reporting, or approval\r\n          requirements to their respective governing body as may be\r\n          required under South Carolina law.\r\n\r\n      11. OFFICERS ASSIGNED\r\n\r\n          Each party agrees to designate and transmit in writing, the names\r\n          of those individuals assigned to perform duties under this\r\n          agreement to the other parties. Upon receipt, such is to be made a\r\n          part of and is incorporated by reference into this agreement.\r\n\r\n       In explaining the agreement, the State showed that it was signed by Chief\r\nWallace Oswald on behalf of the Town of Batesburg-Leesville. According to the\r\nState, Chief Oswald entered into the NET Agreement based on the advice and\r\nconsent of the Batesburg-Leesville Town Council (Town Council). The State\r\nintroduced a videotape of an August 31, 2001 Town Council meeting during which\r\nChief Oswald informed Town Council of \"that pending matter between the\r\nsolicitor and the town of Batesburg[-]Leesville forming a multi-jurisdictional\r\nagreement for continued narcotics work in Lexington County.\"\r\n\r\n       The State also introduced minutes from the January 8 and December 10,\r\n2002, Lexington County Council (County Council) meetings through the Clerk of\r\nthe County Council. The January 8 minutes show County Council considered\r\ngrant application requests from the sheriff's department for a NET. The December\r\n10 minutes reflect that County Council voted in favor of grant requests regarding\r\nadditional staff positions in both the solicitor's and sheriff's office to focus on the\r\nNET.\r\n\n       In conjunction with the minutes, the State presented testimony from\r\nMarguerite Crapps, the mayor pro tem of the Batesburg-Leesville Town Council.\r\nWhen asked whether the Batesburg-Leesville Town Council was \"on board with\r\nthe chief of police [to] enter into this agreement on the behalf of Town Council of\r\nBatesburg-Leesville,\" Crapps responded, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n      Lieutenant Byron Snellgrove, who was employed with the narcotics unit of\r\nthe Lexington County Sheriff's Department, was the NET supervisor at all times\r\nrelevant to this case. Lieutenant Snellgrove testified Chief Oswald and the Town\r\nof Batesburg-Leesville assigned Officer Gilliam, of the Batesburg-Leesville Police\r\nDepartment, to the NET. He then assigned Officer Gilliam to the Batesburg-\r\nLeesville area of Lexington County \"to take care of cases inside the town limits as\r\nwell as outside the town limits.\" After Officer Gilliam advised Lieutenant\r\nSnellgove that \"there were drug [sales] going on at 7120 Two Notch Road,\"\r\nLieutenant Snellgrove asked Gilliam \"to try to make a case or get into that location\r\none way or another.\" Lieutenant Snellgrove then requested that Officer Gilliam\r\nhelp with the drug problem at that location pursuant to the NET Agreement.\r\n\r\n       Based on this evidence, the State contended that the notice requirement of\r\nsection 23-1-215 was met because both County Council and Town Council had\r\nactual notice of the NET Agreement and approved their respective law\r\nenforcement agencies' participation in the NET. In contrast to the defense, the\r\nState believed the notice provision of section 23-1-215 was \"purely ministerial and\r\nadministrative,\" similar to the ten-day notice requirement for the return of a search\r\nwarrant to the magistrate upon the execution of the search warrant. Thus, the State\r\nasserted that section 23-1-215(E) should not be \"strictly construed\" to require\r\nwritten notice.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, the State maintained the NET Agreement satisfied the\r\nprovisions of section 23-1-210. Because the governing bodies had actual notice of\r\nthe NET Agreement and its terms, the State claimed that chief law enforcement\r\nofficers were authorized to enter into these agreements \"with the advice and\r\nconsent of county council.\" The State explained that Chief Oswald \"acting as\r\nagent for the corporate municipality of Batesburg[-]Leesville [had] apparent\r\nauthority to bind them . . . because he had the total responsibility of law\r\nenforcement within that town.\"\r\n\r\n      After hearing arguments, the trial judge found the State failed to present\r\nevidence that written notification had been given within 72 hours of the\r\nagreement's execution as required by section 23-1-215(E). The judge, however,\r\n\nruled that the NET Agreement complied with section 23-1-210 because he found\r\nnothing in the statute \"that would prohibit either a county or a municipality . . .\r\nfrom authorizing in some way the chief of police or the sheriff to enter into such\r\nagreements.\" Although the judge was unclear as to which code section the NET\r\nAgreement was based, he concluded the agreement was created pursuant to section\r\n23-1-210. As a result, the judge denied Burgess's motion to dismiss.\r\n\r\n      Subsequently, the State made a motion in limine to exclude Officer Gilliam's\r\npersonnel records. The judge sustained the State's motion, but indicated that he\r\nwould consider the motion if Burgess \"wanted to get into\" these records.\r\n\r\n      During Officer Gilliam's testimony, Burgess sought to cross-examine him\r\nabout why he was no longer with NET and to introduce his personnel records. The\r\nrecords, which describe three incidents that took place after Burgess's arrest but\r\nbefore trial, involved a disagreement with other officers about the use of\r\nconfidential informants, his use of profanity, and his threat to harm another officer.\r\nThe incidents resulted in a two-day suspension, a demotion to the rank of Corporal,\r\nand a ninety-day period of probation. The judge excluded the records, finding the\r\npersonnel matters were irrelevant and highly prejudicial.\r\n\r\n       Ultimately, the jury found Burgess guilty of possession of crack cocaine\r\nwith intent to distribute. Burgess appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals,\r\nwhich affirmed. State v. Burgess, 393 S.C. 396, 712 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 2011). In\r\nso ruling, the court upheld the trial judge's decision that the NET Agreement\r\ncomplied with the requirements of section 23-1-210. Id. at 402, 712 S.E.2d at 4.\r\nSpecifically, the court found: (1) the concerned municipalities and county entered\r\ninto a written agreement to create multi-jurisdictional law enforcement authority;\r\n(2) the agreement complied with the requirements of section 23-1-210 by stating\r\nthe employment conditions and maintaining compensation from permanent\r\nemployment; and (3) the officers acting with the NET were transferred to it on a\r\ntemporary basis. Id. The court further found Chief Oswald informed Town\r\nCouncil of the NET Agreement before its execution, and Town Council gave him\r\nthe authority to enter into the agreement. Id.\r\n\r\n      Additionally, the court distinguished the case from State v. Boswell, 391\r\nS.C. 592, 707 S.E.2d 265 (2011), which was decided by this Court during the\r\npendency of Burgess's appeal.6 The Court of Appeals found Boswell inapposite as\r\n\r\n6 In Boswell, the defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary. Boswell, 391\r\nS.C. at 594, 707 S.E.2d at 265. On appeal, Boswell argued, among other issues,\r\n\nthe NET Agreement was not entered pursuant to the Law Enforcement Assistance\r\nand Support Act and, thus, section 23-20-50(A) of the Act did not apply. Burgess,\r\n393 S.C. at 403, 712 S.E.2d at 4-5. Rather, the court found the NET Agreement\r\nwas \"made pursuant to section 23-1-210, part of a different chapter from the Law\r\nEnforcement Assistance and Support Act entitled 'General Provisions.' \" Id.\r\n\r\n      Having found the NET Agreement was valid pursuant to section 23-1-210,\r\nthe court declined to address its validity under section 23-1-215. Id. at 403-04, 712\r\nS.E.2d at 5.\r\n\r\n       As to the judge's ruling regarding the admission of Officer Gilliam's\r\npersonnel records, the Court of Appeals found the trial judge did not abuse his\r\ndiscretion in excluding these records. Id. at 404-05, 712 S.E.2d at 5. In so ruling,\r\nthe court interpreted the judge's decision \"as a finding that the records did not have\r\na legitimate tendency to show bias on the part of the officer.\" Id. at 405, 712\r\nS.E.2d at 5. The court noted that each incident in Officer Gilliam's personnel\r\nrecords occurred after Burgess's arrest and none of the incidents related directly to\r\nBurgess. Id. Additionally, the court concluded that while the personnel incidents\r\n\"might show Gilliam to be hot-tempered and uncooperative with other officers,\r\nthey do not show his bias against Burgess, or otherwise relate to Gilliam's\r\ncredibility.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      Burgess petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of\r\nthe Court of Appeals. This Court granted the petition.\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the trial judge erred in declining to suppress his confessions as they were the\r\ndirect result of an unlawful arrest by officers acting outside their territorial\r\njurisdiction. Id. at 594, 707 S.E.2d at 266. Specifically, Boswell contended the\r\nLexington County officers were without authority to arrest him for a crime that\r\noccurred in Calhoun County. Id. at 598, 707 S.E.2d at 268. The State offered\r\nevidence of a 1999 multi-jurisdictional agreement entered into between the\r\nCalhoun County and Lexington County Sheriff's Departments that purported to\r\nconfer the authority of officers to arrest in the other county's jurisdiction. Id. In\r\nassessing the validity of the agreement, this Court applied section 23-20-50(A) of\r\nthe Law Enforcement Assistance and Support Act. Id. at 601, 707 S.E.2d at 270.\r\nBecause the agreement was \"not voted on by the county council\" as required by\r\nsection 23-20-50(A) of the Act, this Court deemed it invalid. Id. at 602, 707\r\nS.E.2d at 270.\r\n\n                                  II.    Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Multi-Jurisdictional Agreement\r\n\r\n       In advocating the reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals, Burgess\r\nposits three arguments. First, he contends that Boswell is dispositive as he broadly\r\nconstrues the holding to require all multi-jurisdictional agreements to be voted on\r\nby the governing body of each jurisdiction pursuant to section 23-20-50(A).\r\nSecond, he asserts the agreement failed to strictly comply with the provisions of\r\nsection 23-1-210 as the \"State presented no written verification that the\r\nBatesburg/Leesville town council authorized the Chief of Police to entered into the\r\nagreement [on] behalf of the council.\" Burgess further notes that \"there is no\r\nmention of the County authorizing Sheriff Metts to enter into the agreement on\r\nbehalf of the County.\" Finally, Burgess maintains that it is \"questionable\" whether\r\nsection 23-1-215 is applicable to the facts of the instant case as he believes this\r\ncode section only applies to situations where a crime has occurred in multiple\r\njurisdictions.7 Even if applicable, Burgess avers that law enforcement failed to\r\ncomply with the statutorily required written notice provision of subsection (E).\r\nBecause the validity of a multi-jurisdictional agreement is dependent upon strict\r\ncompliance, he disputes the State's contention that actual notice is sufficient.\r\n\r\n          1. Implications of Boswell\r\n\r\n       We agree with the Court of Appeals that Boswell is not controlling as it is\r\nfactually and legally distinguishable. However, as will be discussed, we find the\r\ninterpretation of Boswell by the Court of Appeals was entirely too narrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n7  As a threshold matter, Burgess asserts that any argument regarding the\r\napplicability of section 23-1-215 is not preserved for appellate review because the\r\nState did not appeal the trial judge's decision as to this statute and raised it for the\r\nfirst time in its final brief to the Court of Appeals and in its return to Burgess's\r\npetition for a writ of certiorari. We find the issue is properly before this Court\r\nbecause the State challenged the trial judge's ruling on this issue as an additional\r\nsustaining ground to the Court of Appeals and to this Court. See I'On, L.L.C. v.\r\nTown of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (\"The\r\nappellate court may review respondent's additional reasons and, if convinced it is\r\nproper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason appearing in the record to\r\naffirm the lower court's judgment.\").\r\n\n        Initially, we note that Burgess did not argue to the trial judge or to the Court\r\nof Appeals that section 23-20-50(A) was applicable; therefore, any argument\r\nregarding this statute is not preserved for appellate review. See State v. Sheppard,\r\n391 S.C. 415, 706 S.E.2d 16 (2011) (stating that an issue may not be raised for the\r\nfirst time on appeal). Furthermore, unlike the agreement in Boswell, the NET\r\nagreement in the instant case does not reference section 23-20-50 or contain a\r\nprovision outlining the public safety situations identified in section 23-20-30.8\r\nThus, we agree with the ultimate conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals\r\nregarding the inapplicability of Boswell.\r\n\r\n       However, we find the court interpreted Boswell too narrowly as it infers that\r\nsection 23-20-50(A) either conflicts with or is mutually exclusive from sections\r\n23-1-210 and 23-1-215. This is an incorrect reading of Boswell. Because all of\r\nthese code sections are contained within Title 23, which is entitled \"Law\r\nEnforcement and Public Safety,\" these sections cannot be read in isolation as the\r\nCourt of Appeals appears to have done. See Higgins v. State, 307 S.C. 446, 415\r\nS.E.2d 799 (1992) (recognizing rule of statutory construction that statutes must be\r\nread as a whole and sections which are part of the same general statutory scheme\r\nmust be construed together and each given effect, if it can be done by any\r\nreasonable construction).\r\n\r\n       Although we question why the General Assembly has failed to consolidate\r\nthese sections into one that would govern all multi-jurisdictional agreements, we\r\nbelieve the separate sections were enacted as a result of legislative progression.\r\nSpecifically, section 23-1-210 was enacted in 1981 to address the temporary\r\ntransfer of law enforcement officers to another jurisdiction, section 23-1-215 was\r\nenacted in 1987 to expressly address crimes that occur in multiple jurisdictions,\r\nand section 23-20-50 was enacted in 2000 to authorize law enforcement to assist\r\nother jurisdictions with certain public safety concerns.9 Notably, the drafters of\r\nthese agreements appear to recognize this interrelationship as the agreements\r\nusually include a reference to all of these sections.\r\n\r\n8 The agreement in Boswell implicitly included section 23-20-50 as it notes that\r\none of the purposes of the agreement is to \"provide mutual aid in the event of\r\nnatural disaster, disorder, or other emergency situations.\" It also expressly\r\nprovided that the agreement does not affect any agreements regarding narcotics\r\ninvestigations.\r\n9 Act No. 109, 1981 S.C. Acts 402; Act No. 107, 1987 S.C. Acts 262; Act No.\r\n382, 2000 S.C. Acts 2604.\r\n\n         2. Propriety of NET Agreement under sections 23-1-210 and 23-1-\r\n            215\r\n\r\n       Even though Boswell is not dispositive of the instant case, it is nonetheless\r\ninstructive because it stands for the proposition that statutes governing multi-\r\njurisdictional agreements must be strictly complied with to ensure the validity of\r\nthe agreement. See Boswell, 391 S.C. at 602, 707 S.E.2d at 270 (recognizing the\r\nsignificance of territorial jurisdiction and concluding that a \"more stringent\r\napproach needs to be followed in order to confer this type of authority\"). Applying\r\nthis principle to the instant case, we hold the NET Agreement is invalid as it does\r\nnot satisfy the statutory requirements of either section 23-1-210 or section 23-1-\r\n215.         a. Section 23-1-210\r\n\r\n       As a matter of state statute, the Town of Batesburg-Leesville and Lexington\r\nCounty operate and govern through Town Council and County Council. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 4-9-30(3), (13) (1986 & Supp. 2013) (\"[E]ach county government\r\nwithin the authority granted by the Constitution and subject to the general law of\r\nthis State shall have the following enumerated powers which shall be exercised by\r\nthe respective governing bodies thereof: (3) to make and execute contracts . . .\r\n(13) to participate in multi-county projects and programs authorized by the general\r\nlaw and appropriate funds therefor . . . .\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 5-7-160 (2004) (\"All\r\npowers of the municipality are vested in the council, except as otherwise provided\r\nby law, and the council shall provide for the exercise thereof and for the\r\nperformance of all duties and obligations imposed on the municipality by law.\"\r\n(emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       Consistent with this general authorization of power, subsection (B) of\r\nsection 23-1-210 mandates that \"the concerned municipalities or counties\" enter\r\ninto written agreements providing for the transfer of its law enforcement officers to\r\nanother municipality or county. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-1-210(B) (2007). Certainly,\r\nthere is evidence that County Council approved grant requests to fund additional\r\nstaff positions associated with NET and Town Council was verbally informed of\r\nthe \"pending matter between the solicitor and the town of Batesburg[-] Leesville\r\nforming a multi-jurisdictional agreement.\" These procedures, however, did not\r\nconstitute express approval by \"the concerned municipalities or counties\" as to the\r\nactual NET Agreement. In fact, the record reveals that the terms of the NET\r\nAgreement were never presented to the governing bodies for their approval.\r\nInstead, the only evidence is that Chief Oswald and Sheriff Metts entered into the\r\n\nNET Agreement on behalf of their law enforcement agencies. Thus, without the\r\nexpress approval of Town Council and County Council, the NET Agreement failed\r\nto strictly comply with the statutory requirements of section 23-1-210.\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding the lack of strict statutory compliance, the State contends\r\nthe agreement is, nevertheless, valid as the governing entities provided Chief\r\nOswald and Sheriff Metts with apparent authority to enter into the NET\r\nAgreement. We reject this contention as Town Council and County Council could\r\nnot delegate this authority.\r\n\r\n       Because the authority to enter into these agreements was statutorily\r\nconferred upon the governing entities, these entities were prohibited from\r\nabdicating this power and delegating it to a law enforcement officer. See 2A\r\nEugene McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations § 10:46 (3d ed. 1996)\r\n(\"Usually a power conferred without limitation upon the municipal corporation\r\nmay be exercised by the common council or legislative body as the general agent\r\nof the corporation, and by no other authority. A fortiori, power conferred upon the\r\ncouncil or legislative body in express terms cannot be delegated otherwise than in\r\naccordance with the expression of terms.\" (footnotes omitted)); 62 C.J.S.\r\nMunicipal Corporations § 206 (Supp. 2013) (\"The governing body of a municipal\r\ncorporation, entrusted by the state with the police power, is prevented from\r\ndelegating its high functions to any body or officer; instead, it may be discharged\r\nor exercised only by those to whom the state commits it.\" (footnotes omitted)); see\r\nalso Newman v. McCullough, 212 S.C. 17, 25-26, 46 S.E.2d 252, 256 (1948)\r\n(recognizing that a municipal council, \"acting as a governmental agency, . . . is\r\nbound always to act as trustee of the power delegated to it and may not surrender\r\nor restrict any portion of such power conferred upon it\").\r\n\r\n       Thus, strictly construing section 23-1-210, we are constrained to find the\r\nNET Agreement was invalid as Town Council and County Council were the only\r\nentities authorized to enter into this multi-jurisdictional agreement. If law\r\nenforcement agencies are to have this authority, it is for the General Assembly and\r\nnot this Court to grant them this authority. See 80 C.J.S. Sheriffs & Constables §\r\n51 (Supp. 2013) (\"Sheriffs and constables have all the powers and duties\r\nappertaining to their office at common law except as modified by a statute or the\r\nstate constitution.\").10\r\n\r\n10 Even assuming Chief Oswald was authorized to enter into the NET Agreement\r\non behalf of the Town of Batesburg-Leesville, we find Officer Gilliam was not\r\n\"transferred on a temporary basis to work in law enforcement in any other\r\n\n             b. Section 23-1-215\r\n\r\n      Although not addressed by the Court of Appeals, we find the trial judge\r\ncorrectly ruled the NET Agreement did not comply with the provisions of section\r\n23-1-215 as the State presented no evidence that County Council or Town Council\r\nreceived written notification within seventy-two hours of the execution of the NET\r\nAgreement as required by subsection (E). S.C. Code Ann. § 23-1-215(E) (2007).\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, it is arguable that section 23-1-215 was factually inapplicable\r\nas one could construe this section to govern only the investigation of past crimes\r\nrather than to provide blanket extra-territorial jurisdiction to officers addressing\r\npotential criminal activity. As titled, the purpose of section 23-1-215 is to\r\nauthorize \"[a]greements between multiple law enforcement jurisdictions for\r\npurpose of criminal investigation.\" Id. § 23-1-215. Subsection (A) then states in\r\nthe past tense, \"[i]n the event of a crime\" involving multiple jurisdictions;11 thus,\r\nby implication, the statute authorizes agreements for the investigation of completed\r\ncrimes spanning multiple jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, Officer Gilliam was assigned to assist in the execution of\r\na search warrant for a specific trailer at 7120 Two Notch Road. Because Burgess\r\nwas not the subject of this investigation as he did not reside at this trailer and was\r\narrested near a trailer that was not the target of the search warrant, we do not\r\n\r\nmunicipality or county in this State.\" Id. § 23-1-210(A). Notably, the agreement\r\nwas executed in September 2001 and the arrest occurred in March 2006. There is\r\nalso evidence that Officer Gilliam worked on NET for at least a year and a half.\r\nThus, although he may have been assigned to assist in the execution of the search\r\nwarrant, Officer Gilliam had relied on the provisions of the NET Agreement to\r\nclaim extra-territorial authority for an extended duration. Accordingly, even\r\nthough \"temporary\" is not defined by section 23-1-210, Officer Gilliam's extended\r\nservice under the NET Agreement cannot be construed as a \"temporary\" transfer as\r\nintended by the statute. See State v. Hudson, 336 S.C. 237, 519 S.E.2d 577 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1999) (acknowledging rule of statutory construction that when faced with an\r\nundefined statutory term, the court must interpret the term in accord with its usual\r\nand customary meaning).\r\n11 We note the 2007 amendment to section 23-1-215 expressly included past tense\r\nlanguage stating, \"In the event of a crime or crimes that have occurred . . . .\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 23-1-215(A) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added).\r\n\nbelieve section 23-1-215 could be interpreted to confer authority on Officer\r\nGilliam to arrest Burgess.\r\n\r\n      c.     Valid Conviction Despite Invalid Agreement\r\n\r\n       Despite our finding that the NET Agreement was invalid, we conclude that\r\nBurgess's conviction was, nevertheless, valid. Although Officer Gilliam lacked\r\nauthority to arrest Burgess, Agents Laney and Kirkland, who were authorized with\r\nterritorial jurisdiction in Lexington County, played an integral role in the arrest and\r\ndiscovery of the drugs that formed the basis of the conviction.\r\n\r\n       Section 44-53-375(B) of the South Carolina Code creates a permissive\r\ninference that possession of one or more grams of a \"cocaine base\" is \"prima facie\r\nevidence\" of possession with intent to distribute. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-375(B)\r\n(Supp. 2007).12 \"Possession may be actual or constructive.\" State v. Ballenger,\r\n322 S.C. 196, 199, 470 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1996). \"Actual possession occurs when\r\nthe drugs are found to be in the actual physical custody of the person charged with\r\npossession, while constructive possession occurs when the person charged with\r\npossession has dominion and control over either the drugs or the premises upon\r\nwhich the drugs are found.\" Id. (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n       Here, the evidence was sufficient to prove Burgess possessed crack cocaine\r\nwith intent to distribute. Notably, Burgess fled when Agent Laney and Officer\r\nGilliam arrived at the target location; thus, indicating consciousness of guilt. See\r\nState v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 655, 623 S.E.2d 122, 128 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n(\"Unexplained flight is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt, for it is not\r\nas likely that one who is blameless and conscious of that fact would flee.\").\r\nOfficer Gilliam apprehended Burgess with the assistance of Agent Kirkland.\r\nAgent Laney then independently searched for and discovered 5.67 grams of crack\r\ncocaine and a pill bottle top in the area from which Burgess fled.\r\n\r\n       Even if we assume that Burgess's arrest was invalid, such an assumption\r\nwould be of no consequence to Burgess as this Court has held that \"the illegality of\r\nan initial arrest did not bar the accused person's subsequent prosecution and\r\nconviction of the offense charge.\" State v. Biehl, 271 S.C. 201, 204, 246 S.E.2d\r\n859, 860 (1978). The Biehl Court pointed out that no evidence used in Biehl's trial\r\nwas acquired as a result of the arrest. The same is true in Burgess's trial. The\r\n\r\n12 Because the offense occurred in March 2006, we cite to the code section in\r\neffect at that time.\r\n\nrecovery of the crack cocaine by Agent Laney was directly related to Burgess's\r\nconduct during his furtive flight. Burgess attempted to flee immediately when he\r\nsaw the arrival of Agent Laney and Officer Gilliam. Agent Laney followed\r\nBurgess's furtive flight path and found the drugs in an area where Burgess had\r\nbeen standing. Thus, the crack cocaine, which formed the basis for Burgess's\r\nconviction, was not fruit of the arrest. Specifically, the drugs were not found on\r\nBurgess's person nor were they located as a result of anything Burgess said after he\r\nwas arrested. Rather, the drugs were independently found by Agent Laney of the\r\nLexington County Sheriff's Office.\r\n\r\n      Finally, Burgess's reliance on our decision in Boswell is unavailing. After\r\nBoswell was arrested, he confessed to the arresting officers. Boswell, 391 S.C. at\r\n597, 707 S.E.2d at 267. Accordingly, we held that the confessions should have\r\nbeen excluded at trial as they were the fruit of the invalid arrest. Id. at 606, 707\r\nS.E.2d at 272. However, in this case, Burgess did not confess nor were the drugs\r\nfound on his person or his property.\r\n\r\n       In light of the foregoing, we find the invalid NET Agreement did not negate\r\nthe authority of Agents Laney and Kirkland to charge Burgess with the offense for\r\nwhich he was convicted.       III.   Cross-Examination\r\n\r\n      Burgess next asserts the trial judge erred in refusing to allow cross-\r\nexamination about Officer Gilliam's personnel records as the records constituted\r\nevidence of bias and motive to misrepresent pursuant to Rule 608(c), SCRE.\r\n\r\n       Burgess maintains that Officer Gilliam's credibility as a witness was \"a key\r\nissue at trial\" because he was the only witness to testify that Burgess dropped a pill\r\nbottle that contained crack cocaine residue. Burgess also notes that neither Agent\r\nLaney nor Officer Gilliam witnessed Burgess in actual possession of the crack\r\ncocaine that was discovered on the ground. In view of this evidence, Burgess\r\ncontends \"the jury . . . had a right to know about Gilliam's disciplinary problems\r\nand removal from the NET because the information had a legitimate tendency to\r\nthrow light on the accuracy, truthfulness and sincerity of Gilliam's testimony.\"\r\nSpecifically, Burgess claims \"[t]he records portray Gilliam as an overzealous\r\nnarcotics officer who was willing to use unreliable confidential informants in order\r\nto make an arrest and who violated protocols of the NET concerning the use of\r\nconfidential informants.\"\r\n\n       \"Rule 608(c), SCRE, provides that bias, prejudice or any motive to\r\nmisrepresent may be shown to impeach the witness either by examination of the\r\nwitness or by evidence otherwise adduced.\" State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 25, 558\r\nS.E.2d 518, 523 (2002). \"Rule 608(c) 'preserves South Carolina precedent holding\r\nthat generally, anything having a legitimate tendency to throw light on the\r\naccuracy, truthfulness, and sincerity of a witness may be shown and considered in\r\ndetermining the credit to be accorded his testimony.' \" Id. (quoting State v. Jones,\r\n343 S.C. 562, 570, 541 S.E.2d 813, 817 (2001)).\r\n\r\n       \"As a general rule, a trial court's ruling on the proper scope of cross-\r\nexamination will not be disturbed absent a manifest abuse of discretion.\" State v.\r\nQuattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 450, 527 S.E.2d 105, 109 (2000). An abuse of\r\ndiscretion occurs when the trial court's ruling either lacks evidentiary support or is\r\nbased on an error of law. State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 631 S.E.2d 262 (2006).\r\n\r\n        We find the Court of Appeals correctly upheld the trial judge's decision\r\nprohibiting Burgess from cross-examining Officer Gilliam about his personnel\r\nrecords as we discern no abuse of discretion. Significantly, each of the disciplinary\r\nincidents occurred after Burgess's arrest and did not involve Burgess. Furthermore,\r\nOfficer Gilliam's hostile actions were directed at co-workers rather than subjects of\r\ncriminal investigation. Thus, Burgess failed to offer evidence that Officer Gilliam\r\nlacked credibility due to bias against Burgess. Accordingly, the trial judge\r\nproperly limited Burgess's cross-examination of Officer Gilliam. Cf. Baldez v.\r\nState, 386 S.W.3d 324 (Tex. Ct. App. 2012) (discussing Rule 608 and holding that\r\ntrial judge did not err in prohibiting defendant from cross-examining the arresting\r\nofficer concerning his disciplinary suspension for the sole purpose of showing the\r\nofficer's lack of credibility as the defendant never argued that the officer was\r\nuntrustworthy due to bias or interest against the defendant).\r\n\r\n                                  IV.   Conclusion\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we hold the NET Agreement was invalid and, thus,\r\ndid not confer extra-territorial jurisdiction upon Officer Gilliam. See State v.\r\nHarris, 299 S.C. 157, 159, 382 S.E.2d 925, 926 (1989) (\"The jurisdiction of a\r\nmunicipal police officer, absent statutory authority, generally does not extend\r\nbeyond the territorial limits of the municipality.\"). Our decision should not be\r\nconstrued as invalidating all multi-jurisdictional agreements. Instead, we\r\nrecognize the import of these agreements and emphasize that they are not invalid\r\nper se. The validity of these agreements, however, is dependent upon strict\r\ncompliance with the applicable statutes. Because the NET Agreement in the\r\n\ninstant case failed to satisfy the statutory requirements, we are constrained to find\r\nthat it is invalid.\r\n\r\n      However, despite the invalidity of the NET Agreement, we find the Court of\r\nAppeals correctly affirmed Burgess's conviction as Officer Gilliam's lack of\r\nauthority did not negate Agents Laney's and Kirkland's authority in Lexington\r\nCounty. Thus, Officer Gilliam's lack of authority did not vitiate the valid\r\nconviction. Moreover, we find the Court of Appeals correctly upheld the trial\r\njudge's decision prohibiting Burgess from cross-examining Officer Gilliam\r\nregarding his personnel records as we discern no abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Bannister, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE JAMES E. MOORE: In this appeal from a divorce action,\r\nAppellant Shirley Crossland (\"Wife\") contends the court of appeals erred in\r\nreversing the family court's alimony award, in modifying the equitable division of\r\nthe marital estate, and in remanding the issue of attorney's fees. We agree and\r\nreverse.\r\n\n                                         I. \n\r\n\r\nRespondent Robert Crossland (\"Husband\") and Wife were married in 1997 and\r\nseparated for the final time on September 6, 2006. Husband filed for divorce on\r\nAugust 17, 2007. Both parties were previously married and had adult children\r\nfrom those marriages; however, no children were born of this marriage. At the\r\ntime of the divorce hearing on March 1, 2010, Husband was seventy-six years old\r\nand Wife was sixty-two years old.\r\n\r\nAt the time of marriage, Husband was sixty-three years old and had been retired\r\nfor twenty years. His income during his marriage consisted of social security\r\nretirement benefits, Air Force retirement benefits, and veterans disability benefits.\r\nAt the time the parties married, Husband owned two mobile homes, the marital\r\nresidence—a house Husband purchased in 1955,1 and savings in the form of\r\nstocks, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and mutual funds (collectively\r\n\"savings accounts\"). Shortly after the couple married, Husband added Wife's name\r\nto all of the savings accounts; however, after the parties separated, he transferred\r\nthe money from the savings accounts to an annuity fund in his name only.2\r\nDirectly prior to the transfer, the savings accounts contained approximately\r\n$180,000.\r\n\r\nBefore the marriage, Wife worked in a bookstore making minimum wage and lived\r\nwith her daughter because she was unable to support herself financially. At the\r\ntime the parties married, Wife was fifty years old and had just returned from an\r\nextended mission trip to Ukraine. She testified the bookstore held her position\r\nopen during her mission trip, but upon her return, Husband asked her not to return\r\nto her job so they could travel together. Wife owned no assets at the time of the\r\nmarriage and did not work during the marriage except for period of employment\r\n\r\n1Husband paid off the loan on the house sometime during the 1960s. The house\r\nand the mobile homes remained solely in Husband's name during the marriage, and\r\nWife never claimed the marital residence or the two mobile homes were part of the\r\nmarital estate.\r\n2 Husband admitted withdrawing the overwhelming majority of the funds from the\r\nsavings accounts, leaving each account with a nominal balance of five dollars so as\r\nto prevent Wife from receiving notification of the withdrawals. Husband also\r\nadmitted moving the funds into various new accounts in his name only, in order to\r\nmake it harder for Wife to trace the money.\r\n\nwith the Census Bureau in 1998 and 1999 during which she earned approximately\r\n$26,000. During the marriage, Wife also received $5,632.84 in proceeds resulting\r\nfrom an automobile accident. Wife testified she deposited both her Census Bureau\r\nearnings and the auto accident proceeds into the parties' joint accounts.\r\nAdditionally, Wife testified she was eligible for social security retirement benefits,\r\nbut had not applied to receive them because she did not wish to do so before\r\nreaching the official retirement age.\r\n\r\nBoth Husband and Wife suffered from various health problems, Wife to a greater\r\ndegree. Husband has hearing problems and underwent two knee replacements and\r\nsurgeries for heart and prostate issues. Wife has suffered from degenerative neck\r\nand back pain and has undergone two separate back surgeries. Additionally, Wife\r\nhas undergone shoulder surgery and has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and\r\narthritis. In 2001, Wife was in an automobile accident and injured her back,\r\nshoulder, and right arm. Thereafter, Wife re-injured her shoulder and arm when\r\nshe fell down a flight of stairs. In August 2005, Wife was diagnosed with breast\r\ncancer, which was successfully treated and continued to be in remission at the time\r\nof the divorce hearing. Wife testified she was unable to work because of her health\r\nproblems. She also testified she stood to lose her medical insurance as a result of\r\nthe divorce and would need to procure new insurance at a cost of at least $330 per\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nIn his divorce complaint, Husband claimed Wife left their marital home on\r\nSeptember 6, 2006, and did not return. Husband stated Wife had previously left\r\nthe home three times, but eventually returned each time. Husband estimated they\r\nlived together for only five years of their ten-year marriage due to various\r\nseparations initiated by Wife. In her Answer, Wife contended she was forced from\r\nthe marital home by Husband's erratic and overly controlling behavior, especially\r\nin regards to the couple's finances.3 Wife further requested equitable division of\r\n\r\n3 In her affidavit and at the divorce hearing, Wife and her daughter testified\r\nHusband required Wife: learn how to read the electric meter to insure usage never\r\nexceeded 400 kilowatts per month in order to limit the electric bill to $18 a month;\r\nwash clothes in cold water only and only on certain days; take \"military showers\"\r\nwhere Wife \"could have the water on to get wet and rinse off only\"; never drive\r\nabove 55 miles per hour on the interstate and drive extremely close behind\r\neighteen-wheelers so as to cut the wind resistance in order to conserve gasoline;\r\nlimit trips to visit friends and family unless Wife had other errands to complete\r\nnearby; and limit long-distance telephone calls to ten minutes at a time. Wife\r\n\nthe marital property, alleging Husband had secreted assets and denied her access,\r\nand she requested separate support and maintenance, alimony based on Husband's\r\nfault, and attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\nThe family court granted Husband a divorce based on one year of continuous\r\nseparation. The family court found it was clear the parties \"entered into a\r\ntraditional marriage, with the Husband to be the major, if not sole financial\r\ncontributor to the financial stability of the marriage with the Wife mainly taking\r\ncare of the household duties, until the point at which her health deteriorated,\" and\r\nboth had regularly saved through \"frugal living\" and contributed to the marital\r\nestate. Thus, the family court awarded Wife forty percent of the marital estate,\r\nrepresented by the annuity4 in Husband's name and the amount of $20,442, which\r\nthe court found Husband had taken from the savings accounts to purchase an\r\nautomobile after he filed for divorce, in violation of the family court's preliminary\r\norder.\r\n\r\nFurther, the family court noted it was clear from Husband's testimony he never\r\nexpected Wife to contribute financially to the marriage, and although Wife \"may\r\nhave at some point been able to contribute to her own support, it is clear that\r\nduring the marriage, her health deteriorated to the point she could no longer\r\nfinancially contribute to [the] marriage through gainful employment.\" Thus, the\r\nfamily court awarded Wife alimony in the amount of $958.50 per month. Finally,\r\nafter considering the relevant factors, the family court awarded Wife $16,024.50 in\r\nattorney's fees.\r\n\r\nHusband appealed, and the court of appeals reversed the family court's alimony\r\naward and remanded the issue for a recalculation of alimony, finding Wife's\r\neligibility for social security retirement benefits should have been imputed as\r\n\r\nfurther stated there were times when she \"would have to regularly leave the house\r\nand 'visit' relatives for the last week of the month to keep the power and water\r\nusage below the levels [Husband] demanded.\" Husband admitted limiting the\r\nmonthly electricity usage, but denied he made Wife leave the home and stay with\r\nfamily in order to keep the electric bill at a certain level.\r\n4 The family court found the annuity fund Husband had opened in his name only\r\nwas marital property because the source of funds was the savings accounts, which\r\nwere transmuted into marital property. The court of appeals affirmed as to this\r\nissue, and Husband did not appeal that issue to this Court.\r\n\nincome. The court of appeals also modified the family court's sixty-forty division\r\nof the marital estate, finding Husband should have received seventy percent of the\r\nmarital assets and that Wife was entitled only to thirty percent. Additionally, the\r\ncourt of appeals reversed the family court's award of attorney's fees to Wife and\r\nremanded the issue for reconsideration because the substantive results achieved by\r\nWife's counsel were reversed on appeal. This Court granted Wife's petition for a\r\nwrit of certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision.\r\n\r\n                                         II.\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court reviews factual and legal issues de\r\nnovo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414–415, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011).\r\nThus, this Court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of\r\nthe preponderance of the evidence; however, this broad scope of review does not\r\nrequire the Court to disregard the findings of the family court, which is in a\r\nsuperior position to make credibility determinations. Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381,\r\n385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651–52 (2011). A. Alimony\r\nWife argues the court of appeals erred in holding that, for the purposes of awarding\r\nalimony, income should be imputed to her based on her eligibility for social\r\nsecurity retirement benefits she has not applied to receive. We agree.\r\n\r\nAlimony is a substitute for the support normally incidental to the marital\r\nrelationship. Spence v. Spence, 260 S.C. 526, 529, 197 S.E.2d 683, 684 (1973).\r\n\"Generally, alimony should place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in\r\nthe same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.\" Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C.\r\n177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether to award alimony, the family court must consider and give\r\nappropriate weight to the following factors:\r\n\r\n      (1) the duration of the marriage together with the ages of the parties at\r\n      the time of the marriage and at the time of the divorce . . . ; (2) the\r\n      physical and emotional condition of each spouse; (3) the educational\r\n      background of each spouse . . . ; (4) the employment history and\r\n      earning potential of each spouse; (5) the standard of living established\r\n      during the marriage; (6) the current and reasonably anticipated\r\n      earnings of both spouses; (7) the current and reasonably anticipated\r\n\n      expenses and needs of both spouses; (8) the marital and nonmarital\r\n      properties of the parties . . . ; (9) custody of the children . . . ; (10)\r\n      marital misconduct or fault of either or both parties . . . ; (11) the tax\r\n      consequences to each party as a result of the particular form of\r\n      support awarded; (12) the existence and extent of any support\r\n      obligation from a prior marriage or for any other reason of either\r\n      party; and (13) such other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-130(C) (2014). An award of alimony rests within the\r\nsound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\ndiscretion. Dickert v. Dickert, 387 S.C. 1, 8, 691 S.E.2d 448, 451 (2010). \"[T]he\r\ninartful use of an abuse of discretion deferential standard of review merely\r\nrepresents the appellate courts' effort to incorporate the two sound principles\r\nunderlying the proper review of an equity case.\" Lewis, 392 S.C. at 391, 709\r\nS.E.2d at 655. \"[T]hose two principles are the superior position of the trial judge\r\nto determine credibility and the imposition of a burden on an appellant to satisfy\r\nthe appellate court that the preponderance of the evidence is against the finding of\r\nthe trial court.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, Wife testified that she was sixty-two years old and, thus, eligible to\r\nreceive social security retirement benefits but that she had not applied to receive\r\nthose benefits because she had \"always heard that if you start drawing it earlier,\r\nyou won't receive as much as if you wait until later.\" Wife said that she was not\r\nsure, but she thought she would receive \"a little over $200\" per month if she\r\napplied to receive social security benefits at age sixty-two instead of postponing\r\nher application until she reached age sixty-five.\r\n\r\nThe court of appeals held the family court erred in calculating alimony without\r\nconsidering Wife's eligibility for social security benefits and remanded for a\r\ndetermination of Wife's \"income,\" to be derived from her future, yet-unclaimed\r\nsocial security benefits and a recalculation of alimony in light of such benefits.\r\nEssentially, the court of appeals equated Wife's decision to postpone applying for\r\nsocial security benefits with voluntary underemployment such that Wife's\r\neligibility to receive benefits should be imputed as income. This was error.\r\n\r\nInitially, it is well-established that social security benefits a party is actually\r\nreceiving would be properly considered as income in awarding alimony. See, e.g.,\r\nKennedy v. Kennedy, 389 S.C. 494, 501, 699 S.E.2d 184, 187 (Ct. App. 2010)\r\n(identifying the husband's income as being comprised of, inter alia, social security\r\n\nbenefit payments). However, the question here is a different one: whether social\r\nsecurity benefits should be imputed as income where a person is eligible to receive\r\nbenefits but has not yet applied for or received them.\r\n\r\nWife seems to ask this Court to create a rule that income should never be imputed\r\non the basis of eligibility for government benefits; however, a bright-line rule is\r\nnot only unnecessary in light of existing case law, but also inadvisable. See Rimer\r\nv. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 527, 605 S.E.2d 572, 575 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"We leave it\r\nlargely to the family court judge's discretion, however, to determine what is [an]\r\nappropriate [alimony award] in light of the circumstances of each individual case.\r\nFormulaic principles and bright-line rules will only hinder the ability of family\r\ncourt judges to reach an equitable result in this individualized, fact-intensive area\r\nof law.\"). Indeed, the family court may, but is not in all cases required to, consider\r\neligibility for government benefits, and under the circumstances of this case, the\r\nfamily court did not commit reversible error.\r\n\r\nThus, the court of appeals erred in finding the family court was required to impute\r\nincome to Wife based on social security benefits she is eligible to receive at age\r\nsixty-two. Although voluntary decreases in income may prompt a family court to\r\nconsider a party's earning capacity instead of actual income, it is clear that \"the\r\nfailure to reach earning capacity, by itself, does not automatically equate to\r\nvoluntary underemployment such that income must be imputed.\" Kelley v. Kelley,\r\n324 S.C. 481, 488–89, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996). \"[C]ourts are\r\nreluctant to invade a party's freedom to pursue the employment path of their own\r\nchoosing or impose unreasonable demands upon parties.\" Id. at 489, 477 S.E.2d at\r\n731. \"[T]he common thread in cases where actual income versus earning capacity\r\nis at issue is that courts are to closely examine the [party's] good-faith and\r\nreasonable explanation for the decreased income.\" Id. Here, there is no evidence\r\nof any bad faith on Wife's part, and Wife articulated a rational reason for delaying\r\nher application for social security benefits—namely, that she will receive a greater\r\nbenefit if she postpones her application until she reaches age sixty-five.\r\nAccordingly, the family court did not err in declining to impute wife's eligibility\r\nfor social security benefits at age sixty-two.\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court should have been required to consider Wife's\r\neligibility for social security benefits based on the language of section 20-3-\r\n130(C)(6). However, the language of that section requires the family court to\r\nconsider \"the current and reasonably anticipated earnings of both spouses.\" Thus,\r\nwere the family court to prospectively account for Wife's future, reasonably\r\n\nanticipated receipt of social security benefits in its initial alimony award, the\r\ncorrect amount for the family court to consider would be the amount Wife actually\r\nanticipates receiving when she reaches age sixty-five—not the lesser amount Wife\r\nis eligible to receive at age sixty-two. The record is devoid of any evidence of the\r\namount of benefits Wife might expect to receive at age sixty-five. Because the\r\nfamily court must have sufficient evidence upon which to base a determination of a\r\nperson's earning potential for purposes of awarding alimony, the family court was\r\nnot presented with sufficient evidence to prospectively consider the amount of\r\nbenefits Wife reasonably anticipates receiving at age sixty-five in awarding\r\nalimony and, thus, did not err in refusing to engage in such speculation.5 See\r\nSexton v. Sexton, 308 S.C. 37, 42, 416 S.E.2d 649, 653 (Ct. App. 1992) (reversing\r\nthe family court's alimony award because it was based on an unsupported finding\r\nof the husband's earning capacity), rev'd on other grounds, 310 S.C. 501, 427\r\nS.E.2d 665 (1993); see also Nelson v. Nelson, 651 So.2d 1252 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.\r\n1995) (\"As a general rule, trial courts may not consider future or anticipated events\r\nin setting current alimony and child support amounts due to the lack of evidentiary\r\nbasis or the uncertainty surrounding such future events.\"); cf. Cox v. Cox, 882 P.2d\r\n909 (Alaska 1994) (affirming the trial court's refusal to consider future social\r\nsecurity benefits due to their \"speculative nature\"). In sum, family courts may, in\r\nsome cases, but are not required in every instance, to impute income based on a\r\nparty's eligibility to receive social security benefits as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n5 We note Husband is not foreclosed from seeking to modify alimony when Wife\r\nactually begins receiving social security benefits after her sixty-fifth birthday. See\r\nS.C. Code § 20-3-170 (2014) (allowing for a modification of alimony based on a\r\nsubstantial change in circumstances of the parties); Serowski v. Serowski, 381 S.C.\r\n306, 313–15, 672 S.E.2d 589, 593–94 (Ct. App. 2009) (affirming reduction in the\r\nhusband's alimony obligation based on the wife's increase in monthly income due,\r\nin part, to her receipt of social security benefits). Although \"[c]hanges in\r\ncircumstances within the contemplation of the parties at the time the divorce was\r\nentered generally do not provide a basis for modifying alimony,\" where the date\r\nand amount of the anticipated changes are not ascertainable and the original decree\r\ndoes not prospectively account for the future circumstance, a modification may be\r\nappropriate. Id. at 313, 672 S.E.2d at 593; see Eubank v. Eubank, 347 S.C. 367,\r\n374, 555 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding that although the likelihood that\r\nthe wife would receive an inheritance was known to the parties prior to the divorce,\r\nher actual inheritances could serve as changed circumstances warranting a review\r\nof alimony because the parties could not have ascertained the amount of the wife's\r\ninheritances or when she would receive them at the time of the divorce).\r\n\nBased on the facts of this case, we find the court of appeals erred in vacating the\r\nfamily court's alimony award based on its failure to consider Wife's eligibility to\r\nreceive social security benefits at age sixty-two. Further, because there is\r\ninsufficient evidence as to the amount of social security benefits Wife reasonably\r\nanticipates receiving after age sixty-five, the family court did not err in refusing to\r\nconsider Wife's future, reasonably anticipated receipt of social security benefits in\r\nits initial alimony award. Accordingly, we reverse as to this issue and reinstate the\r\nfamily court's alimony award.  B. Equitable Division\r\n\r\nWife next argues the court of appeals erred in modifying the family court's\r\ndecision to award her forty percent of the marital estate. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe division of marital property is within the discretion of the family court and\r\nwill not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Craig v. Craig, 365\r\nS.C. 285, 617 S.E.2d 359 (2005). As previously noted, \"the inartful use of an\r\nabuse of discretion deferential standard of review\" in this context represents two\r\nunderlying principles of appellate review: \"the superior position of the trial judge\r\nto determine credibility and the imposition of a burden on an appellant to satisfy\r\nthe appellate court that the preponderance of the evidence is against the finding of\r\nthe trial court.\" Lewis, 392 S.C. at 391, 709 S.E.2d at 655. In reviewing a division\r\nof marital property, an appellate court looks to the overall fairness of the\r\napportionment. Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 606 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIf the end result is equitable, the fact the appellate court would have arrived at a\r\ndifferent apportionment is irrelevant. Id.\r\n\r\nEquitable distribution of marital property \"is based on the recognition that marriage\r\nis, among other things, an economic partnership.\" Morris v. Morris, 335 S.C. 525,\r\n517 S.E.2d 720 (Ct. App. 1999). \"Upon dissolution of the marriage, marital\r\nproperty should be divided and distributed in a manner which fairly reflects each\r\nspouse's contribution to its acquisition, regardless of who holds legal title.\"\r\nSection 20-3-620 of the South Carolina Code provides factors for the family court\r\nto consider in apportioning marital property and instructs the family court to \"give\r\nweight in such proportion as it finds appropriate\" to each of the following factors:\r\n\n      (1) the duration of the marriage together with the ages of the parties at\r\n      the time of the marriage and at the time of the divorce . . . ; (2) marital\r\n      misconduct or fault of either or both parties . . . ; (3) the value of the\r\n      marital property . . . ; (4) the income of each spouse, the earning\r\n      potential of each spouse, and the opportunity for future acquisition of\r\n      capital assets; (5) the health, both physical and emotional, of each\r\n      spouse; (6) the need of each spouse or either spouse for additional\r\n      training or education in order to achieve that spouse's income\r\n      potential; (7) the nonmarital property of each spouse; (8) the existence\r\n      or nonexistence of vested retirement benefits for each or either\r\n      spouse; (9) whether separate maintenance or alimony has been\r\n      awarded; (10) the desirability of awarding the family home . . . ; (11)\r\n      the tax consequences to each or either party . . . ; (12) the existence\r\n      and extent of any support obligations, from a prior marriage . . . ; (13)\r\n      liens and any other encumbrances upon the marital property . . . ; (14)\r\n      child custody arrangements and obligations . . . ; and (15) such other\r\n      relevant factors as the trial court shall expressly enumerate in its\r\n      order.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-620 (2014).\r\n\r\nThis Court has held \"[w]hile there is certainly no recognized presumption in favor\r\nof a fifty-fifty division, we approve equal division as an appropriate starting point\r\nfor a family court judge attempting to divide an estate of a long-term marriage.\"\r\nDoe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 634 S.E.2d 51 (2006). The purpose of the general fifty-\r\nfifty division is to protect the non-working spouse who undertook the household\r\nduties, and to prevent an award \"solely based on the parties' direct financial\r\ncontributions.\" Avery v. Avery, 370 S.C. 304, 634 S.E.2d 668 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nAs to equitable division, the family court examined the factors contained in section\r\n20-3-620, in addition to considering: (1) Husband's knowledge, prior to the\r\nmarriage, that he would be providing Wife's sole financial support; (2) Husband's\r\nconcession that Wife's actions assisted in adding to the parties' saving; (3) Husband\r\nclaiming no fault against Wife as to the breakup of the marriage; (4) Husband's\r\nconcession that he took steps to hide the marital assets; (5) Husband's failure to\r\npresent any evidence to the family court regarding the value of any of the savings\r\naccounts prior to the marriage; (6) Wife's declining health throughout the marriage,\r\nwhich the family court determined had deteriorated to the point she could no\r\n\nlonger financially support herself through gainful employment; and (7) Wife's\r\ncontribution to the savings accounts in the form of her Census Bureau salary and\r\nautomobile accident proceeds. The family court determined that by Wife\r\ncomplying with the \"very harshly frugal rules set by the Husband,\" the parties\r\ncontributed equally to the joint marital estate and stated \"[i]t is clear to this Court\r\nthat the fault of the ultimate dissolution of this marriage rests with the Husband.\"\r\nBased on these considerations, the family court apportioned sixty percent of the\r\nmarital estate to Husband and forty percent to Wife.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the court of appeals found the family court erred in awarding Wife forty\r\npercent of the marital estate, and modified the lower court's order and award to\r\nthirty percent. The court of appeals noted the legal principle that equitable division\r\nshould not be based solely on the parties' direct financial contributions;\r\nnevertheless, the court found the record demonstrated Husband made\r\ndisproportionately greater contributions to the marriage than Wife, and \"Wife\r\nbrought no assets to the marriage and brought in no assets during the marriage.\"\r\nFurther, the court of appeals held Wife contributed only a negligible amount during\r\nthe marriage to the parties' joint accounts through her position with the Census\r\nBureau and the proceeds from her automobile accident, and the \"vast majority of\r\nthe contributions to the parties' accounts during the marriage were made from\r\nHusband's social security, retirement, and disability benefits.\" In addition, the\r\ncourt noted the bulk of the funds in the savings accounts were earned by Husband\r\nprior to the marriage and as a result of \"decades of living frugally and saving his\r\nearnings.\" Finally, the court of appeals noted both parties were unemployed for the\r\nmajority of the marriage and contributed to household duties.\r\n\r\nWe find the court of appeals erred in modifying the family court's division of\r\nassets, as its decision impermissibly relied solely on the parties' direct financial\r\ncontributions to the marital estate to the exclusion of other relevant statutory\r\nfactors. Although greater direct financial contributions may properly be\r\nconsidered in apportioning a marital estate, that factor is but one of many factors to\r\nbe considered and does not alone overshadow all of the other relevant factors\r\nexamined by the family court.6 See Pittman v. Pittman, 407 S.C. 441, 754 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n6Specifically, the family court found that Husband actively concealed assets and\r\nknew at the outset of the marriage that Wife would not contribute financially to the\r\nmarriage, and that before Wife's health deteriorated to the point that she was\r\nunable to work, she contributed all of her earnings to the parties joint accounts—\r\nover $30,000 during the course of the marriage. Unlike the court of appeals, we do\r\n\n501, 507 (2014) (noting the proper way to reflect one party's disproportionately\r\ngreater direct financial contribution is in the overall division of the marital estate);\r\nsee, e.g., Myers v. Myers, 391 S.C. 308, 705 S.E.2d 86 (Ct. App. 2011) (affirming\r\na division of marital assets apportioning fifty-two percent to husband and forty-\r\neight percent to wife where the parties were married for nine years and both were\r\nin their sixties at the time of divorce, divorce was granted on the basis of one year's\r\ncontinuous separation, wife earned an income but did not contribute it towards the\r\nfamily expenses, instead using it exclusively for her own benefit, and the parties\r\nlived in a home owned by husband for the duration of the marriage); Doe v. Doe,\r\n370 S.C. 206, 634 S.E.2d 51 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding a seventy-thirty\r\napportionment in favor of the husband was reversible error even where the wife did\r\nnot make direct financial contributions during the last eighteen years of the\r\nmarriage, she admitted a twenty-year-long affair with a former boss, and wife's\r\nparamour, not the husband, was the biological father of the parties' only child).\r\n\r\nAlthough this Court is free to make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law,\r\nwe are not required to disregard the family court's factual findings, which in this\r\ncase favor Wife—not Husband. We find the family court's apportionment fairly\r\nreflects the relative contributions of the parties, as well as the other relevant\r\nstatutory factors, and therefore, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and\r\nreinstate the family court's equitable division of the marital estate, apportioning\r\nforty percent to Wife and sixty percent to Husband.\r\n\r\n                                 C. Attorney's Fees\r\nLastly, Wife argues the court of appeals erred in remanding the issue of attorney's\r\nfees to the family court. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe family court may order one party to pay a reasonable amount to the other party\r\nfor attorney's fees and costs incurred in maintaining an action for divorce. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 20-3-130(H) (2014). In determining whether an attorney's fee should\r\nbe awarded, the following factors should be considered: (1) the party's ability to\r\npay his/her own attorney's fee; (2) beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3)\r\nthe parties' respective financial conditions; and (4) effect of the attorney's fee on\r\n\r\nnot view this as a \"negligible\" amount, particularly in light of the parties'\r\nagreement that Husband would be the primary financial provider. The family court\r\nalso concluded that the parties contributed equally to the joint marital estate and\r\nfound \"the fault of the ultimate dissolution of this marriage rests with the Husband\r\nand that the Wife only left due to the Husband's requests.\"\r\n\neach party's standard of living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812\r\n(1992). In determining the amount of reasonable attorney's fees, a court should\r\ntake six factors into consideration: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case;\r\n(2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel;\r\n(4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6)\r\ncustomary legal fees for similar services.\" Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158,\r\n403 S.E.2d 313 (1991).\r\n\r\nAs previously noted, the family court awarded Wife $16,024.50 in attorney's fees\r\nafter determining: (1) Wife had no ability to pay her attorney's fees; (2) Wife's\r\ncounsel achieved beneficial results, \"particularly in tracing the marital assets\r\ndespite Husband's attempts to conceal the same\"; (3) Husband was in a far better\r\nposition to pay Wife's attorney's fees, costs and expenses, and the award would not\r\nimpact Husband as severely as it would Wife; and (4) the matter was unnecessarily\r\nmade more difficult by Husband's actions in attempting to conceal the joint nature\r\nand extent of the parties' marital assets, thereby requiring additional time and effort\r\non the part of Wife's counsel to locate, identify, and value the assets.\r\n\r\nWhere beneficial results in a divorce action are reversed on appeal, the case should\r\nbe remanded for reconsideration of attorney's fees awarded. See Rogers v. Rogers,\r\n343 S.C. 329, 540 S.E.2d 840 (2001) (\"[S]ince the beneficial result obtained by\r\ncounsel is a factor in awarding attorney's fees, when that result is reversed on\r\nappeal, the attorney's fee award must also be reconsidered.\").\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the court of appeals reversed and remanded the issue of attorney's fees\r\nfor redetermination because it reversed and modified in part the family court's\r\noriginal order. Because we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and\r\nreinstate the family court's alimony award and division of the marital estate, we\r\nreverse also as to this issue and reinstate the family court's award of attorney's fees.\r\n\r\n                                          III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals regarding\r\nalimony, equitable division, and attorney's fees and reinstate the family court's\r\norder as to those issues.\r\n\nREVERSED. \n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27407","title":"State v.

We disagree and find the facts of Reid's case\r\nfall within the purview of Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2009), in which the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court held a valid Miranda1given waiver prior to a\r\ncustodial interrogation sufficed to waive a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to\r\ncounsel regardless of whether he retained representation at a prior arraignment. Id.\r\nat 795. Reid further contends the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed\r\nverdict of acquittal on the charges for possession of a firearm during the\r\ncommission of a violent crime because the State failed to prove he actually or\r\nconstructively possessed a firearm. We find those charges were properly\r\nsubmitted to the jury and therefore affirm his convictions.\r\n\r\n                  FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      On the evening of October 1, 2009, Maurice Jackson, Tyrone King, and\r\nKenny Cunningham, the victims, were sitting on Jackson's front porch when\r\nJackson received a text from Reid inquiring about buying marijuana. When\r\nJackson informed Reid he did not have any marijuana, Reid said he would stop by\r\nJackson's house regardless. Upon arriving, Reid invited Jackson to accompany\r\nhim to \"midtown,\" stating he had located some marijuana. Jackson declined\r\nbecause he could not leave his company on his porch. Reid asked to use Jackson's\r\ncell phone and during the course of his conversation Jackson and Cunningham\r\noverheard him say \"There's two\" or \"It's two of them.\" Reid indicated he would\r\ncome back and left, but he never returned.\r\n\r\n       Jackson and his companions remained on the porch and roughly fifteen to\r\nthirty minutes later a man and a woman approached the porch, neither of whom the\r\nvictims recognized. The woman ran up the steps and announced that it was a\r\nrobbery. The man, who wore a mask, pulled a rifle from his pants, echoed the\r\nwoman's pronouncement that this was a robbery, and threatened to shoot if any of\r\nthem moved.\r\n\r\n       The woman went through the victims' pockets and collected the contents.\r\nThe man and woman started to leave, but the man turned around and began\r\nshooting at the victims. Cunningham was struck through his left leg and between\r\nhis toes. King was shot in the head and later died from the wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\n       After interviewing the victims, the police investigation focused on Reid, and\r\nthe day after the robbery, detectives questioned him about the incident. Reid\r\ninformed law enforcement that he stopped by Jackson's house to use Jackson's\r\nphone to call a female friend, who he then went to visit. Reid agreed to\r\naccompany the detectives to this friend's apartment so she could corroborate his\r\nstory; however, once they arrived at the address Reid gave them, he indicated the\r\ndetectives needed to question a different woman. That woman's mother denied that\r\nReid had been there the night before.\r\n\r\n      Thereafter, Reid was handcuffed and taken to the police station where he\r\nwas read his Miranda rights, which he waived. Over the next few days, Reid made\r\nfour different statements to law enforcement. Reid gave the first statement at 1:45\r\np.m. indicating a man named Darius Jeter acted alone in the robbery and was both\r\nthe shooter and instigator. Reid admitted he assisted Jeter by reconnoitering\r\nJackson's porch prior to the robbery. He also stated he did not witness the robbery,\r\nbut heard the shots. Reid was then taken to a jail cell in the police department.\r\n\r\n       A few hours later Reid asked to speak with the detectives again to provide\r\nadditional information. Prior to the interview, Reid was Mirandized again and\r\nafter waiving his rights he gave a second statement at 4:10 p.m. In this statement,\r\nhe maintained Jeter was the lone robber and shooter; however, this time Reid\r\ndescribed witnessing the events of the robbery, although he still stated he only\r\nheard the shots as he walked away and did not see the gunfire.\r\n\r\n       Prior to midnight that same day, detectives approached Reid again for\r\nquestioning. After waiving his Miranda rights, Reid made another statement, this\r\ntime indicating a female–Samantha Ervin–was also involved in the robbery. Reid\r\nstill maintained Jeter was the shooter but now stated Ervin helped plan the robbery\r\nand drove the three of them to Jackson's house. He also indicated Ervin\r\naccompanied Jeter to Jackson's house while he waited in her truck for them. Reid\r\nstated after he heard gunfire, Jeter and Ervin ran back to Ervin's truck, and Jeter\r\nsaid he thought he shot one of them.\r\n\r\n       During his arraignment the following day, Reid filed a request for counsel\r\nand a supporting affidavit of indigency. He was approved for appointment of\r\ncounsel that day. Over the course of the next few days, law enforcement\r\ninterviewed Ervin and she eventually disclosed that in addition to herself and Reid,\r\nDavontay Henson and Aileen Newman were also involved in the crimes. Based on\r\nthis information, Henson and Newman were both arrested. Thereafter, detectives\r\n\nquestioned Reid on October 6 at 9:40 a.m., informing him they knew he had not\r\nbeen truthful in his prior statements. Although Reid had not yet met with his\r\nappointed counsel, he again waived his Miranda rights and gave a fourth\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n       In his fourth statement, Reid stated he was with Henson and Newman at\r\nErvin's house earlier in the evening on October 1 when Henson pulled out a rifle\r\nand said he wanted to rob someone. Ervin asked if Reid would assist in robbing\r\nJackson and he assented. Reid then walked over to Jackson's home and called\r\nErvin to inform her there were two other people at Jackson's house. After Reid left\r\nJackson's home, he met up with Henson, Ervin, and Newman, who had all been\r\nriding around in Ervin's truck. Reid informed them there were three people on the\r\nporch and he could not convince Jackson to leave with him. Henson then stated he\r\nwould just rob all three of them. Reid and Ervin waited in Ervin's truck while\r\nHenson and Newman walked to Jackson's home. Reid heard gunshots and shortly\r\nthereafter, Henson and Newman returned to the truck. Henson then threatened to\r\n\"come back and get\" anyone who disclosed the events of the evening.\r\n\r\n       Based on law enforcement's investigations, Reid, Henson, Newman, and\r\nErvin were subsequently charged with murder, assault and battery with intent to\r\nkill (ABWIK), criminal conspiracy, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm\r\nduring the commission of a violent crime. Ervin and Newman both pled guilty, but\r\nHenson and Reid proceeded to a joint trial.2\r\n\r\n       Prior to trial, Reid moved to suppress his fourth statement to the police on\r\nthe grounds it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\r\nDuring the Jackson v. Denno3 hearing, Reid argued he requested and was\r\nappointed counsel at his arraignment on October 3, and therefore, it was a violation\r\nof his constitutional rights for police to question him on October 6 without his\r\nattorney present. The State contended Reid's argument was no longer viable\r\nbecause Montejo held a valid Miranda waiver prior to a custodial interrogation is\r\nnot rendered constitutionally inadequate simply because the defendant was\r\nappointed counsel at a prior arraignment. The trial court denied the motion to\r\nsuppress and the case proceeded to trial.\r\n\r\n2 Ervin pled guilty to three counts of armed robbery and one count of criminal\n\r\nconspiracy, and Newman pled guilty to one count of ABWIK, one count of \n\r\ncriminal conspiracy, and three counts of armed robbery. \n\r\n3 378 U.S. 368 (1964). \n\r\n\n       At trial, Cunningham and Jackson both testified about their encounter with\r\nReid prior to the incident and indicated he was not one of the perpetrators present\r\nduring the robbery. Additionally, Newman and Ervin testified about the particulars\r\nof the plan to rob Jackson and how it was executed. They described Reid's\r\nparticipation in scouting out the porch and his attempt to lure Jackson away from\r\nthe home. They also indicated Reid knew Henson had a rifle he planned to\r\nemploy, but Reid himself did not take part in the commission of the robbery.\r\n\r\n      Ultimately, the jury found Reid not guilty of murder, but guilty of assault\r\nand battery of a high and aggravated nature, three counts of armed robbery, three\r\ncounts of possessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and\r\ncriminal conspiracy. Reid appealed, and the Court certified the case pursuant to\r\nRule 204(b), SCACR.            ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\nI.\t    Did the trial court err in allowing the introduction of Reid's fourth statement\r\n       to law enforcement?\r\n\r\nII.\t   Did the trial court err in failing to grant a directed verdict in favor of Reid on\r\n       the three charges of possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\n       violent crime?             LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.\t    SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO COUNSEL\r\n\r\n      Reid argues the trial court erred in failing to suppress his fourth statement\r\nbecause the police obtained it in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to\r\ncounsel. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that \"[i]n\r\nall criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the\r\nAssistance of Counsel for his defence.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV.4 \"[O]nce the\r\nadversary judicial process has been initiated, the Sixth Amendment guarantees a\r\n4 The protections of the Sixth Amendment have been extended to the states\r\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 61, 53\r\n(1932).\r\n\ndefendant the right to have counsel present at all 'critical' stages of the criminal\r\nproceedings.\" Montejo, 556 U.S. at 786. This right to counsel may be waived by a\r\ndefendant provided relinquishment of the right is voluntary, knowing, and\r\nintelligent. Id. However, the decision to waive counsel need not itself be\r\ncounseled. Id. Generally, \"an accused who is admonished with the warnings\r\nprescribed [in Miranda] has been sufficiently apprised of the nature of his Sixth\r\nAmendment rights, and of the consequences of abandoning those rights, so that his\r\nwaiver on this basis will be considered a knowing and intelligent one.\" Patterson\r\nv. Illinois, 487 U.S. 285, 296 (1988).\r\n\r\n      Reid contends his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was implicated at the\r\narraignment when he requested appointment of counsel. He therefore argues the\r\nsubsequent police-initiated interview violated that right and his waiver was invalid.\r\nWe find the United States Supreme Court foreclosed this argument in Montejo.\r\n\r\n       Prior to Montejo, the Court established the rule in Michigan v. Jackson, 475\r\nU.S. 625 (1986), that \"if police initiate interrogation after a defendant's assertion, at\r\nan arraignment or similar proceeding, of his right to counsel, any waiver of the\r\ndefendant's right to counsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.\" Id. at\r\n636. The Court expounded this holding as an extension of the rule in Edwards v.\r\nArizona, 451 U.S. 477 (1981), that \"an accused person in custody who has\r\n'expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to\r\nfurther interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to\r\nhim, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or\r\nconversations with the police.'\" Jackson, 475 U.S. at 626 (quoting Edwards, 451\r\nU.S. at 484–85).\r\n\r\n       However, in Montejo the Court expressly overruled Jackson, finding the\r\nprotections afforded in Miranda, Edwards, and Minnick5 sufficiently safeguard a\r\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Montejo, 556 U.S. at 794. In that\r\ncase, Jesse Montejo was arrested in connection with a robbery and murder. Id. at\r\n781. He waived his right to counsel under Miranda and gave various accounts of\r\nthe incident. Id. Several days later, Montejo was brought before a court for a \"72-\r\nhour hearing,\" a preliminary hearing required in Louisiana during which the court\r\nautomatically appointed him an attorney as part of the course of the proceeding.\r\nId. Prior to meeting with his newly retained attorney, detectives visited Montejo in\r\nprison and requested he accompany them in searching for the murder weapon. Id.\r\n\r\n5   Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U.S. 146 (1990).\r\n\nThe detectives read Montejo his Miranda rights again and he agreed to go on the\r\nexcursion, during which time he wrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the\r\nvictim's widow. Id. at 782.\r\n\r\n      At trial, Montejo argued the letter must be excluded under Jackson because\r\ncounsel was appointed at his arraignment and therefore his subsequent waiver was\r\npresumptively invalid. Id. The trial court rejected his argument and allowed\r\nadmission of the letter. Id. The jury convicted Montejo of first-degree murder and\r\nsentenced him to death. Id. On appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed his\r\nconviction. Id. In rejecting his reliance on Jackson, that court found the\r\n\r\n      prophylactic protection of Jackson is not triggered unless and until the\r\n      defendant has actually requested a lawyer or has otherwise asserted\r\n      his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Because Montejo simply\r\n      stood mute at his 72–hour hearing while the judge ordered the\r\n      appointment of counsel, he had made no such request or assertion.\r\n\r\nId.    On certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, Montejo argued\r\nLouisiana's application of Jackson produced an arbitrary and unworkable standard\r\nthat could not be applied consistently nationwide because some states\r\nautomatically appoint counsel to indigent defendants while others require\r\naffirmative action by the defendant to obtain counsel. Id. at 783–84. Montejo\r\ncontended the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel should not turn on whether a\r\ndefendant requested counsel but whether he was represented by counsel, and once\r\nrepresented the defendant could not constitutionally be approached by law\r\nenforcement for questioning while in custody. Id. at 786. The majority of the\r\nCourt rejected both interpretations. Id. at 792. Although agreeing Louisiana's\r\ninterpretation invited mischief in determining whether a defendant adequately\r\n\"invoked\" his right to counsel, the Court found Montejo's reading was inconsistent\r\nwith the Jackson holding. Id. at 783. Specifically, the Court noted that the evil\r\nJackson sought to redress was the potential for police badgering defendants into\r\nchanging their minds and waiving their right to counsel after that right was\r\nasserted. Id. at 798. However, under Montejo's construction of Jackson, if a\r\ndefendant is automatically appointed counsel, the police cannot initiate questioning\r\nof him despite the fact he never asserted the right to have his attorney present. Id.\r\nThis, the majority found, was an inconsistent expansion from the antibadgering\r\nrationale that drove the decision in Jackson, for a defendant could not be coerced\r\n\ninto changing his mind if he never actually invoked his right to counsel in the\r\ncustodial setting. Id.\r\n\r\n      In light of what it considered equally untenable interpretations, the Court\r\ndetermined the rule enunciated in Jackson had proved unworkable and should be\r\nabandoned. Id. at 792. Furthermore, the Court observed the limited benefits of\r\nJackson in light of the safeguards provided by Miranda, Edwards, and Minnick:\r\n\r\n      Under Miranda's prophylactic protection of the right against\r\n      compelled self-incrimination, any suspect subject to custodial\r\n      interrogation has the right to have a lawyer present if he so requests,\r\n      and to be advised of that right. Under Edwards' prophylactic\r\n      protection of the Miranda right, once such a defendant \"has invoked\r\n      his right to have counsel present,\" interrogation must stop. And under\r\n      Minnick's prophylactic protection of the Edwards right, no subsequent\r\n      interrogation may take place until counsel is present, \"whether or not\r\n      the accused has consulted with his attorney.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 794 (citations omitted). Accordingly, the Court reasoned that \"[i]f that\r\nregime suffices to protect the integrity of a suspect's voluntary choice not to speak\r\noutside his lawyer's presence before his arraignment, it is hard to see why it would\r\nnot also suffice to protect that same choice after arraignment, when Sixth\r\nAmendment rights have attached.\" Id. at 795 (citations and quotations omitted).\r\nUltimately, the Court overruled Jackson and remanded Montejo's case to allow\r\nhim to invoke any Edwards' protections he might claim, such as arguing he clearly\r\nasserted his right to counsel when officers approached him. Id. at 797.\r\n\r\n       Turning to our case, we find Montejo bars Reid's claim that his Sixth\r\nAmendment right to counsel was violated. Although Reid makes much of the\r\nfactual distinctions between the cases—Montejo was automatically appointed\r\ncounsel while Reid elected to file a form requesting counsel—it is exactly this type\r\nof argument Montejo meant to preclude by overruling Jackson. The Court did\r\nmore than merely remove the presumption of invalidity of a waiver after a\r\ndefendant's Sixth Amendment rights were invoked. It held that where, as here, a\r\ndefendant claimed a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel in the\r\ncontext of a custodial interrogation, the relevant inquiry was what happened the\r\nmoment police initiated contact. Therefore, the question is no longer, as Reid\r\nposits, whether the defendant invoked his right to counsel at arraignment, but\r\nwhether he waived his rights prior to the interrogation. See id. at 797 (\"What\r\n\nmatters for Miranda and Edwards is what happens when the defendant is\r\napproached for interrogation, and (if he consents) what happens during the\r\ninterrogation—not what happened at any preliminary hearing.\").\r\n\r\n      We accordingly find that under Montejo, Reid waived his right to counsel by\r\nsigning the Miranda waiver prior to giving his fourth statement. Because he made\r\nno allegations that he requested his counsel be present or that this waiver was\r\notherwise not knowing and voluntary, we affirm the admission of his statement.6\r\n\r\nII.   DIRECTED VERDICT\r\n\r\n      Reid also argues the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict of acquittal\r\non the charges for possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent\r\ncrime. We disagree.\r\n\r\n      On appeal from the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the Court views\r\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the State. State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C.\r\n316, 321, 555 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2001). To survive a directed verdict motion, the\r\nState must provide direct or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending\r\nto prove the defendant's guilt, or from which the defendant's guilt can be fairly and\r\nlogically deduced. State v. Walker, 349 S.C. 49, 53, 562 S.E.2d 313, 315 (2002).\r\n\r\n      In his motion for a directed verdict, Reid argued the State failed to prove he\r\never possessed the rifle. The State countered that he could be convicted under the\r\ntheory of \"the hand of one is the hand of all.\" The trial court denied the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Although Reid makes allusions to the fact that a state can provide more expansive\r\nprotection than that mandated by the federal Constitution, he never raised before\r\nthe trial court any South Carolina constitutional provision or other state law upon\r\nwhich to ground such an extension. Instead, he argued only a violation of his Sixth\r\nAmendment rights under the United States Constitution and this Court must apply\r\nthose rights as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. Oregon v. Hass,\r\n420 U.S. 714, 719 (1975) (\"[A] State is free as a matter of its own law to impose\r\ngreater restrictions [on] police activity than those this Court holds to be necessary\r\nupon federal constitutional standards. But, of course, a State may not impose such\r\ngreater restrictions as a matter of federal constitutional law when this Court\r\nspecifically refrains from imposing them.\" (internal citations omitted)). We\r\ntherefore confine our analysis to Reid's rights under the United States Constitution.\r\n\n       The doctrine of accomplice liability arises from the theory that \"the hand of\r\none is the hand of all.\" 23 S.C. Jur. Homicide § 22.1 (2014). Under this theory,\r\none who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for\r\neverything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common\r\ndesign and purpose. State v. Mattison, 388 S.C. 469, 479, 697 S.E.2d 578, 584\r\n(2010). A person must personally commit the crime or be present at the scene of\r\nthe crime and intentionally, or through a common design, aid, abet, or assist in the\r\ncommission of that crime through some overt act to be guilty under a theory of\r\naccomplice liability. State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 648–49, 515 S.E.2d 98, 101\r\n(1999). Accordingly, proof of mere presence is insufficient, and the State must\r\npresent evidence the participant knew of the principal's criminal conduct. State v.\r\nLeonard, 292 S.C. 133, 137, 355 S.E.2d 270, 272 (1987). If \"a person was 'present\r\nabetting while any act necessary to constitute the offense [was] being performed\r\nthrough another,' he could be charged as a principal—even 'though [that act was]\r\nnot the whole thing necessary.'\" Rosemond v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 1240, 1246\r\n(2014) (alteration in original) (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Criminal\r\nLaw § 649, p. 392 (7th ed. 1882)).\r\n\r\n       Just as Reid could be convicted of assault and battery of a high and\r\naggravated nature and armed robbery under a theory of accomplice liability even\r\nthough he did not wield the offending weapon, so could he be found guilty for\r\npossession of that firearm. Although there was no evidence presented Reid\r\nassisted Henson in possessing the firearm, the State presented evidence Reid\r\nhelped orchestrate the robberies and reconnoitered the scene. Furthermore, Reid\r\nknew Henson had a rifle in his possession for use during the robberies. Reid then\r\nwaited at the getaway vehicle for Henson to return with the proceeds.7 We find the\r\nState presented direct or substantial circumstantial evidence Reid facilitated the\r\nrobbery and knew Henson intended to use a firearm during the commission of the\r\ncrime. We therefore hold the trial court properly denied Reid's motion for a\r\ndirected verdict on the charges for possession of a firearm during the commission\r\nof a violent crime.8\r\n\r\n\r\n7 This Court has previously held that a participant need not witness the crime to be\r\n\"present at the scene\" and guilty under a theory of accomplice liability. See State\r\nv. Chavis, 277 S.C. 521, 522, 290 S.E.2d 412 (1982) (affirming a defendant's\r\nconviction as a principal where the defendant helped plan the robbery, but was\r\nthree miles away from the scene when the crime actually occurred).\r\n8 This holding is in accord with other jurisdictions that have considered guilt under\r\nan accomplice liability theory in similar circumstances. See, e.g., Rosemond, 134\r\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we affirm both the trial court's denial of Reid's\r\nmotion to suppress his fourth statement and its denial of his directed verdict motion\r\non the charges of possessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS. Ct. at 1243 (holding a defendant can be convicted as a principal for aiding and\r\nabetting the crime of \"us[ing] or carr[ying] a firearm\" during a crime if the\r\n\"defendant actively participated in the underlying drug trafficking or violent crime\r\nwith advance knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the\r\ncrime's commission,\" even if the defendant did not use or carry a gun himself);\r\nBattle v.

Humphries, 991 N.E.2d 652, 658 (Mass. 2013) (\"[T]o establish\r\nliability for firearm possession under a theory of joint venture, it is not necessary\r\nthat the Commonwealth prove that a defendant had actual or constructive\r\npossession of a firearm, but only that such a defendant was accessory to another\r\nidentified defendant in possessing a firearm.\" (internal quotation marks omitted));\r\nState v. White, 484 A.2d 691, 695 (N.J. 1984) (finding that the Graves Act, which\r\nallows sentence enhancement based on use or possession of a firearm, applies to an\r\nunarmed accomplice); but see Dailey v.

See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-540 (Supp. 2010)\r\n\n(enumerating the circumstances in which a court may impose GPS monitoring on a\r\nperson convicted of a sex offense with a minor). On appeal, Appellant asserts\r\nvarious constitutional challenges to section 23-3-540 and contests the validity of\r\nfive of our previous decisions involving the South Carolina Sex Offender Registry\r\nand statutory authorization of GPS monitoring of sex offenders.1 We affirm.\r\n\r\n                       FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       In 2000, when Appellant was twenty-nine years old, he engaged in a sexual\r\nrelationship with a fifteen-year-old female (Victim). Victim reported the\r\nrelationship to the police, and a grand jury subsequently indicted Appellant for\r\nboth second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor (CSCM-Second) and\r\ncommitting a lewd act on a child under the age of sixteen (CSCM-Third).2 In\r\n2003, Appellant pled guilty to CSCM-Third in exchange for the State dismissing\r\nthe CSCM-Second charge. The circuit court sentenced Appellant to fifteen years'\r\nimprisonment, suspended on the service of twelve years, followed by five years'\r\nprobation with the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon\r\nServices (SCDPPPS).\r\n\r\n      In 2005—after Appellant's guilty plea, but prior to Appellant's release from\r\nthe Department of Corrections—the General Assembly amended South Carolina's\r\nsex offender registration requirements by enacting the Sex Offender Accountability\r\nand Protection of Minors Act of 2006, commonly referred to as \"Jessie's Law.\"\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-540 (2005). In its original form, Jessie's Law read, in\r\nrelevant part:\r\n\r\n1 These cases are: In re Justin B., 405 S.C. 391, 747 S.E.2d 774 (2013), cert.\r\ndenied, 134 S. Ct. 1496 (2014); State v. Dykes, 403 S.C. 499, 744 S.E.2d 505\r\n(2013), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1937 (2014); In re Ronnie A., 355 S.C. 407, 585\r\nS.E.2d 311 (2003); Hendrix v. Taylor, 353 S.C. 542, 579 S.E.2d 320 (2003); and\r\nState v. Walls, 348 S.C. 26, 558 S.E.2d 524 (2002). Together, these cases affirm\r\nthat South Carolina's Sex Offender Registry—including the GPS monitoring\r\nrequirement—is a civil remedy and is not penal in nature.\r\n2 At the time of Appellant's indictment, section 16-15-140 codified the crime of\r\n\"lewd act upon a child under sixteen.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 16-15-140 (1996).\r\nHowever, the General Assembly later renamed this crime CSCM-Third and re-\r\ncodified it in S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-655(C) (Supp. 2010). For ease of reference,\r\nwe refer to \"lewd act upon a child under sixteen\" as CSCM-Third.\r\n\n      (C) A person who is required to register [as a sex offender] pursuant\r\n          to this article for committing criminal sexual conduct with a minor\r\n          in the first degree, pursuant to Section 16–3–655(A)(1), or\r\n          committing or attempting a lewd act upon a child under sixteen,\r\n          pursuant to Section 16–15–140, and who violates a term of\r\n          probation, parole, community supervision, or a community\r\n          supervision program must be ordered by the court or agency with\r\n          jurisdiction to be monitored by the Department of Probation,\r\n          Parole and Pardon Services with an active electronic monitoring\r\n          device.\r\n\r\n      (D) A person who is required to register [as a sex offender] pursuant\r\n          to this article for any other [sex] offense [with a minor] listed in\r\n          subsection (G), [including CSCM-Second,] and who violates a\r\n          term of probation, parole, community supervision, or a\r\n          community supervision program, may be ordered by the court or\r\n          agency with jurisdiction to be monitored by the Department of\r\n          Probation, Parole and Pardon Services with an active electronic\r\n          monitoring device.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added); see also State v. Dykes, 403 S.C. 499, 502–04, 744 S.E.2d\r\n505, 507–08 (2013) (explaining the requirements of section 23-3-540).\r\n\r\n       In 2009, upon his release from the Department of Corrections, Appellant\r\nbegan his probation; however, within two years, Appellant accrued several\r\nunexplained probation violations. At Appellant's probation revocation hearing, the\r\nState recommended imposing mandatory lifetime GPS monitoring on Appellant in\r\naccordance with the requirements of Jessie's Law. See S.C. Code Ann. §23-3-\r\n540(C). In response, Appellant challenged the constitutionality of Jessie's Law and\r\noffered testimony in mitigation,3 but did not deny he had violated his probation.\r\n\r\n       The circuit court rejected Appellant's constitutional challenges and found\r\nAppellant in willful violation of his probation. Therefore, the court found that\r\nJessie's Law mandated that it impose lifetime GPS monitoring on Appellant.\r\n\r\n      This appeal followed. See Rule 203(d)(1)(A)(ii), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Specifically, Appellant introduced evidence that he qualified for one of the lowest\r\nlevels of supervision that SCDPPPS provided.\r\n\n                                        ISSUE\r\n\r\n      Whether the mandatory imposition of GPS monitoring on a sex\r\n      offender convicted prior to a statute's effective date violates:\r\n\r\n         a.\t the Ex Post Facto, Equal Protection, Due Process, or Double\r\n             Jeopardy Clauses of the United States or South Carolina\r\n             Constitutions?\r\n\r\n         b. the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches\r\n            and seizures?\r\n\r\n         c.\t the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual\r\n             punishment?       STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       All statutes are presumed constitutional, and when possible, courts must\r\nconstrue statutes so as to render them valid. In re Justin B., 405 S.C. 391, 395, 747\r\nS.E.2d 774, 776 (2013) (citing Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 569, 549 S.E.2d 591,\r\n597 (2001)). \"A statute will not be declared unconstitutional unless its repugnance\r\nto the constitution is clear beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. (citing In re Lasure,\r\n379 S.C. 144, 147, 666 S.E.2d 228, 229 (2008)). \"The party challenging the\r\nstatute's constitutionality bears the burden of proof.\" Id. (citing In re Treatment of\r\nLuckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 135, 568 S.E.2d 338, 344 (2002)).\r\n\r\n                                     ANALYSIS\r\n       Although Appellant raises numerous challenges to the constitutionality of\r\nJessie's Law, we have explicitly rejected each of these challenges in two of our\r\nrecent opinions. See Justin B., 405 S.C. at 391, 747 S.E.2d at 774, cert. denied,\r\n134 S. Ct. 1496 (2014); Dykes, 403 S.C. at 499, 744 S.E.2d at 505, cert. denied,\r\n134 S. Ct. 1937 (2014).\r\n\r\n       In State v. Dykes, Dykes—similar to Appellant—committed CSCM-Third\r\nprior to the enactment of Jessie's Law, but violated her probation after its\r\nenactment. 403 S.C. at 503–05, 744 S.E.2d at 507–08. The circuit court imposed\r\nGPS monitoring pursuant to Jessie's Law. Id. at 505, 744 S.E.2d at 508. Dykes\r\nappealed, contending that the statute violated the Ex Post Facto, Equal Protection,\r\n\nand Due Process Clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions, as\r\nwell as her Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable governmental\r\nsearches and seizures. Id. at 505, 510 n.9, 744 S.E.2d 508, 511 n.9.\r\n\r\n       A majority of this Court rejected Dykes's arguments, holding that mandatory\r\nGPS monitoring did not violate Dykes's right to substantive due process. Id. at\r\n503, 744 S.E.2d at 507; see also id. at 510 n.9, 744 S.E.2d at 511 n.9 (rejecting\r\nDykes's remaining arguments). Specifically, we disagreed with Dykes's assertion\r\nthat, as a convicted sex offender, she had a fundamental right to be \"let alone.\" Id.\r\nat 505–06, 744 S.E.2d at 508–09 (\"The United States Supreme Court has cautioned\r\nrestraint in the recognition of rights deemed to be fundamental in a constitutional\r\nsense.\" (citing Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997))).4 However,\r\nnotwithstanding the absence of a fundamental right, we found that lifetime GPS\r\nmonitoring \"implicates a protected liberty interest to be free from permanent,\r\nunwarranted governmental interference.\" Id. at 506, 744 S.E.2d at 509. In light of\r\nthe General Assembly's intent to protect the public from sex offenders and aid law\r\nenforcement,5 we held that an initial, mandatory imposition of GPS monitoring for\r\ncertain sex crimes involving children was rationally related to the law's stated\r\npurpose. Id. at 507–08, 744 S.E.2d at 509–10.\r\n\r\n       Despite generally upholding the constitutionality of Jessie's Law, we found\r\nthe final sentence of subsection (H) unconstitutional as arbitrary and not rationally\r\nrelated to the statute's purpose. Id. at 508, 744 S.E.2d at 510 (citing S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 23-3-540(H)). Prior to our decision, subsection (H) permanently foreclosed\r\npersons convicted of CSCM-First or -Third, such as Dykes, from seeking judicial\r\nreview of the necessity of continued GPS monitoring. See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-\r\n540(H). However, we determined that all sex offenders monitored pursuant to\r\nJessie's Law were entitled to periodic judicial review and thus could \"avail\r\nthemselves of the . . . judicial review process as outlined for the balance of the\r\noffenses enumerated in section 23-3-540(G).\" Dykes, 403 S.C. at 508–10, 744\r\n\r\n4\"Our rejection of Dykes'[s] fundamental right argument flow[ed] in part from the\r\npremise that [GPS] monitoring is predominantly civil.\" Dykes, 403 S.C. at 506,\r\n744 S.E.2d at 509 (citing Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2003)); see also Justin B., 405\r\nS.C. at 405–09, 747 S.E.2d at 781–83 (applying the factors from Kennedy v.\r\nMendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 168–69 (1963), and finding that GPS monitoring\r\nof sex offenders is a civil remedy).\r\n5   See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-400 (2003).\r\n\nS.E.2d at 510–11; see also S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-540(H) (outlining the judicial\r\nreview process and relevant lengths of time for review). Accordingly, we found\r\nthat Dykes and others convicted of CSCM-First or -Third could petition the courts\r\nten years after the initial imposition of the monitoring, and every five years\r\nthereafter. Dykes, 403 S.C. at 510, 744 S.E.2d at 511.\r\n\r\n        To address Appellant's remaining arguments, we next look to In re Justin B.,\r\nin which Justin B.'s adoptive mother witnessed him sexually molest his adoptive\r\nsister and notified the police. 405 S.C. at 394, 747 S.E.2d at 775.6 Justin B.\r\nsubsequently pled guilty to CSCM-First, and the family court ordered him to\r\ncomply with the lifetime GPS monitoring requirement set forth in Jessie's Law. Id.\r\nat 394, 747 S.E.2d at 775–76. Justin B. appealed, arguing that GPS monitoring\r\nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\r\nId. at 394–95, 747 S.E.2d at 776.\r\n\r\n       We unanimously disagreed. After examining the legislative intent behind\r\nJessie's Law and applying the Mendoza-Martinez factors,7 we held that \"electronic\r\nmonitoring is not a punishment,\" but a civil requirement. Id. at 394, 404–08, 747\r\nS.E.2d at 775, 781–83 (emphasis added). We also reaffirmed that all sex offenders\r\nsubject to GPS monitoring in accordance with Jessie's Law may periodically\r\npetition for judicial review of the necessity of continued monitoring. Id. at 408,\r\n747 S.E.2d at 783.\r\n\r\n       In light of our previous holdings in Dykes and Justin B., we find that we\r\nhave fully addressed and rejected each of Appellant's constitutional challenges to\r\nJessie's Law.8 Further, we decline to overrule either Dykes or Justin B., especially\r\n\r\n6 Like Justin B., the adoptive sister was also a minor at the time of the molestation.\r\nSee Justin B., 405 S.C. at 394, 747 S.E.2d at 775 (stating that the minor was\r\nindicted for CSCM-First); see also S.C. Code Ann. §16-3-655(A)(1) (\"A person is\r\nguilty of [CSCM-First] if . . . the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who\r\nis less than eleven years of age . . . .\").\r\n7 Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 168–69 (1963) (listing seven\r\nfactors that aid in distinguishing between civil and penal remedies).\r\n8We acknowledge that Dykes and Justin B. did not explicitly reject Appellant's\r\nDouble Jeopardy challenge; however, the prohibition on double jeopardy protects\r\nagainst, inter alia, \"multiple punishments for the same offense.\" North Carolina v.\r\nPearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969) (emphasis added), overruled on other grounds\r\n\ngiven that Appellant does not raise any new questions of law; indeed, Appellant's\r\ncase so closely parallels Dykes as to be factually and legally indistinguishable.\r\nThus, we find that Appellant has not carried his burden to show that Jessie's Law is\r\nunconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Justin B., 405 S.C. at 395, 747 S.E.2d\r\nat 776 (citing Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. at 135, 568 S.E.2d at 344).\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's imposition of GPS monitoring on\r\nAppellant for his probation violations. We likewise note that, although Appellant\r\nmust comply with the GPS monitoring, he is entitled to avail himself of the judicial\r\nreview process required by Dykes and Justin B. See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-\r\n540(H) (providing for judicial review at periodic intervals).\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

As Dykes and Justin B. both hold that\r\nthe GPS monitoring requirement is a civil penalty and not a punishment,\r\nAppellant's argument that Jessie's Law \"increas[es] and expand[s] his punishment\r\nas a violation of double jeopardy\" is without merit. See Justin B., 405 S.C. at 394,\r\n747 S.E.2d at 775; Dykes, 403 S.C. at 506, 744 S.E.2d at 509.\r\n\n        JUSTICE HEARN: Respectfully, I dissent.

I\r\nwould therefore find Section 23-3-540(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013)\r\nunconstitutional, and would reverse and remand for a hearing to determine whether\r\nsatellite monitoring should be imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27409","title":"In the Matter of Kenneth B.

Massey, of Calabash, North Carolina, pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office\r\nof Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of a letter of caution, admonition, or public reprimand. In addition,\r\nhe agrees to pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this\r\nmatter by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) within\r\nthirty (30) days of the issuance of a sanction and to complete the Legal Ethics and\r\nPractice Program Ethics School within nine (9) months of the imposition of a\r\nsanction. We accept the Agreement and issue a public reprimand and order\r\nrespondent to pay the costs incurred by ODC and the Commission in the\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of this matter within thirty (30) days of the date of\r\nthis opinion and to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School\r\nwithin nine (9) months of the date of this opinion. The facts, as set forth in the\r\nAgreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                         Facts\r\n\r\nOn September 3, 2013, respondent appeared in family court on a motion for\r\ntemporary relief on behalf of his client, the father of the child involved in the\r\ncustody matter. During the hearing, respondent submitted an affidavit from his\r\nclient which contained a material misrepresentation regarding the current custody\r\nof the child involved in the case. Specifically, the affidavit stated that the child had\r\nbeen living with respondent's client since June 6, 2013. During the hearing, the\r\nchild's mother informed the court that the child had been residing with her since\r\nJuly 4, 2013.\r\n\r\nRespondent represents that the affidavit was prepared for a hearing that was\r\noriginally scheduled for July 8, 2013, but was rescheduled because the mother of\r\nthe child could not be served. Respondent further represents that he was under the\r\nimpression that his client had amended the affidavit, but respondent admits he did\r\nnot review the affidavit prior to submitting the affidavit to the court on September\r\n3, 2013.                                 Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 3.3 (lawyer shall not\r\nknowingly make false statement of fact to tribunal or fail to correct false statement\r\nof material fact previously made to tribunal by lawyer) and Rule 8.4(e) (it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to\r\nadministration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rules 7(a)(1) (it is ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\n\r\n                                     Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand. Accordingly, we\r\naccept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.1\r\n\r\n In 2004, the Court definitely suspended respondent from the practice of law for\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo years. In the Matter of Massey, 357 S.C. 439, 594 S.E.2d 159 (2004). He was\r\nreinstated to the practice of law on June 21, 2012. In the Matter of Massey, 398\r\nS.C. 592, 730 S.E.2d 855 (2012). The Court confidentially admonished\r\nrespondent in 2007.

We affirm.\r\n\n                                      FACTS\n\r\n\r\nAppellant was convicted of two murders and first-degree burglary, arising from a \n\r\nhome invasion and double homicide in Horry County on the night of April 11, \n\r\n2005. He received concurrent life sentences for the murders and a concurrent \n\r\nthirty-year sentence for the burglary. \n\r\n\r\nPrior to Appellant's trial, another individual, Richard Gagnon, was tried and \n\r\nconvicted of these murders. During Gagnon's trial, the State maintained that there \n\r\nwere two perpetrators involved, as there was blood at the scene that could not \n\r\nbelong to either victim or to Gagnon.1\n\r\n\r\nFour fresh blood droplets were collected from the home where the murders \n\r\noccurred. From these blood droplets, the South Carolina Law Enforcement \n\r\nDivision (SLED) developed a DNA profile. The profile did not match either of the \n\r\nvictims or Gagnon's, but SLED was able to determine the blood belonged to one \n\r\nperson. SLED entered the profile of the unknown individual into the CODIS2\n\r\nnational data base. \n\r\n\r\nApproximately four years after the murders, the Horry County Police Department \n\r\n(HCPD) was notified in a letter from SLED of a CODIS match for the unknown \n\r\nindividual's blood found at the crime scene.3 The DNA matched Appellant's, who, \n\r\nat that time, was incarcerated in Tennessee. Appellant's DNA had been placed into \n\r\nthe CODIS database by the Tennessee Department of Corrections. \n\r\n\r\nHCPD agents travelled to Tennessee to meet with Appellant. These agents \n\r\nobtained a Schmerber4 order from a Tennessee court, and performed a buccal \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The record reflects that Gagnon was granted a new trial after Appellant's\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nconviction. \n\r\n  CODIS stands for Combined DNA Information System. It is a national database \n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nshared by law enforcement offices to assist with criminal investigations. \n\r\n3 This letter was published to the jury over the objection of Appellant. Its \n\r\nadmission is one of the bases of this Appeal. \n\r\n4 Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966). \n\r\n\nswab5 on Appellant for further DNA comparison. However, the investigators who\r\nobtained this order subsequently left HCPD, and the evidence of the swab was lost.\r\n\r\nArrest warrants were issued charging Appellant with burglary and murder. On\r\nAugust 26, 2010, pursuant to the IAD,6 Appellant requested the final deposition of\r\nthe charges pending against him in South Carolina. The solicitor's office and the\r\nclerk of court acknowledged receipt of Appellant's request on September 3, 2010,\r\nwhich triggered the IAD 180-day clock to bring trial.7\r\n\r\nAppellant arrived in South Carolina on October 21, 2010. On March 1, 2011, the\r\nlast day of the 180-day IAD limit, a hearing on the State's motion for a six-month\r\ncontinuance was held. Appellant opposed the continuance arguing that the State\r\ndid not meet its burden for obtaining a continuance under the IAD. The circuit\r\ncourt disagreed with Appellant and ruled that there was good cause for granting the\r\nState's request. In addition to granting a continuance, the court ordered that a\r\nSchmerber hearing be conducted the next week.8 Thereafter, Appellant moved for\r\na continuance, and on June 16, 2011, a three month continuance was granted.9\r\n\r\nThe final pretrial hearing was held on September 1, 2011. The circuit court took up\r\nseveral evidentiary matters which form two of the bases for this appeal. First, the\r\ncourt ruled that neither the State nor Appellant could make any reference to\r\nGagnon's conviction, as it was irrelevant to the determination of Appellant's guilt.\r\nSecond, the circuit court denied Appellant's motion to suppress any mention of\r\nAppellant being in the CODIS database. While ruling that it would not be\r\npermissible for the State to discuss why Appellant was in the database, i.e. the\r\n\r\n5 A buccal swab is a method of obtaining DNA by swabbing the inside of the\r\nsubject's mouth.\r\n6 S.C. Code Ann. §§ 17–11–10 et seq. (2003).\r\n7 Under the IAD, once the receiving jurisdiction acknowledges receipt of the\r\nprisoner's request for disposition, the receiving jurisdiction has 180 days to bring\r\nthe prisoner to trial, unless a proper continuance is granted by a court of competent\r\njurisdiction. S.C. Code Ann. § 17-11-10 Art. III (2003). Otherwise, the court will\r\ndismiss the charges. See State v. Holbrook, 274 S.C. 4, 260 S.E.2d 181 (1979).\r\n(holding that the time provisions of the IAD are mandatory and violation of them\r\nrequires dismissal).\r\n8 The court ultimately issued a Schmerber order, and the results confirmed the\r\nCODIS match to Appellant.\r\n  The State's six month continuance would have ended on September 1, 2011\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\napproximately two weeks before Appellant's requested continuance would end.\r\n\nTennessee conviction, the court allowed the State to present background\r\ninformation regarding the CODIS database and the match to Appellant. The circuit\r\ncourt reasoned it was relevant to explain the gap in time between the murders and\r\nthe arrest. Appellant's trial began on September 12, 2011. He was convicted on all\r\ncounts, and this appeal followed.  DISCUSSION\r\nAppellant raises three issues in this appeal. First, he challenges the circuit court's\r\nsuppression of evidence regarding the convictions of Richard Gagnon, the man\r\nwho was tried and convicted of these murders before Appellant's DNA was linked\r\nto these crimes. Second, Appellant challenges the admission of a letter containing a\r\nreference to Appellant's DNA being in the CODIS database. Finally, Appellant\r\nargues his rights under the IAD were violated by the circuit court's grant of a\r\ncontinuance to the State in March 2011.\r\n\r\n          1. Did the circuit court err when it prohibited any mention of the\r\n             prior conviction of Richard Gagnon?\r\nAppellant contends the circuit court erred in holding that evidence of Gagnon's\r\nconvictions was irrelevant. Appellant argues that he should have been allowed to\r\npresent testimony or evidence regarding Gagnon's involvement in and conviction\r\nof these same crimes. Appellant contends he was prejudiced because he was denied\r\nthe opportunity to show the State's inability to connect him to Gagnon. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be\r\nreversed absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion. State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545,\r\n557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).\r\n\r\nAppellant misconstrued the circuit court's ruling, and as a result failed to present\r\nany evidence of Gagnon's third party guilt. Consequently, he is unable to show\r\nprejudice from the court's suppression of Gagnon's convictions.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court's ruling regarding the admissibility of Gagnon's conviction was:\r\n\r\n      I will allow you to examine the witnesses about whether somebody\r\n      else is present, there's somebody else involved in the matter, what\r\n      the evidence shows, but I will not allow you to bring up that some\r\n      other person has been convicted, because that would, in the Court's\r\n\n      estimation, lessen the jury's obligation, and lessen in their minds\r\n      their responsibility to treat this matter separately. . .\r\n\r\nThe court's ruling permitted evidence that Gagnon had been involved in the crimes\r\nbut not that he had been convicted of these crimes. The court did not prevent\r\nAppellant from presenting evidence that Gagnon committed these crimes, or\r\nevidence that both law enforcement and the solicitor had investigated, arrested, and\r\ntried Gagnon.\r\n\r\nFrom Appellant's arguments, it appears he understood the court's ruling as\r\npreventing him from even mentioning Gagnon or suggesting that he was involved\r\nin these crimes.10 As a result of this misunderstanding, Appellant never presented\r\nevidence, drew out on cross, or argued that someone else committed this crime.\r\nAppellant could have presented evidence to this effect, so we disagree with\r\nAppellant's contention that he was prejudiced by being denied the opportunity to\r\nshow a lack of connection between him and Gagnon.\r\n\r\nIn any case, Gagnon's convictions were irrelevant to Appellant's guilt or innocence,\r\nand thus, the circuit court did not err in refusing to allow Appellant to present the\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, our courts have held that the guilty pleas or the acquittal of a co-\r\ndefendant are irrelevant to the defendant's guilt or innocence. State v. Moore, 337\r\nS.C. 104, 552 S.E.2d 354 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding that co-defendants' guilty pleas\r\nwere not admissible); State v. Brown, 306 S.C. 448, 412 S.E.2d 440 (Ct. App.\r\n1991) (holding that admission of codefendant's guilty plea was irrelevant and\r\ntherefore inadmissible). While Gagnon was not a co-defendant, the disposition of\r\nanother individual's charges for the same crimes the defendant is on trial for is\r\nirrelevant to the defendant's guilt or innocence. While Appellant was entitled to\r\nintroduce evidence of third-party guilt and perhaps would have been able to\r\nintroduce evidence that solicitors had successfully obtained indictments for\r\nGagnon, a jury's verdict is not relevant to Appellant's guilt. Therefore, the circuit\r\ncourt did not err in refusing to allow evidence of Gagnon's convictions.\r\n\r\n         2. Did the circuit court err in admitting a letter from SLED to the\r\n            HCPD which identified the CODIS database?\r\n\r\n\r\n10For example, Appellant's brief states, \"[h]ad Appellant been permitted to explore\r\nRichard Gagnon's involvement in the crime, the State would have been forced to\r\nfocus on the full picture. . . .\"\r\n\nAppellant contends the circuit court erred when it admitted a SLED letter into\r\nevidence because the letter implicitly referenced Appellant's criminal record and\r\ntherefore highly prejudiced Appellant. While we agree the admission of the letter\r\nwas error, we hold that this error does not warrant reversal of Appellant's\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court ruled that the State was allowed to go into background\r\ninformation regarding the CODIS database to explain the delay between the 2005\r\ncrime and Appellant's 2009 arrest. Additionally, the court clarified that the State\r\nwould not be allowed to elicit testimony as to how or why Appellant's DNA was in\r\nthe database. Appellant does not take issue on appeal with any evidence presented\r\nunder these rulings, beyond the publication of the letter to the jury. For example,\r\nthere was testimony regarding the CODIS database and how law enforcement\r\nagencies share it for investigative purposes. Additionally, there was testimony that\r\nthere was a hit generated on the CODIS database from an evidence sample in this\r\ncase. However, the only error that Appellant contends the circuit court committed\r\nis in allowing the letter to be published to the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n      Dear Neil Livingston, the short tandem repeat, STRPCR DNA profile\r\n      developed from item 19 was compared to the Combined [sic] DNA\r\n      Index System, CODIS. This profile matches the STRPCR DNA\r\n      profile developed from Bruce Antwain Hill. This information is\r\n      provided for investigative purposes only. If the suspect is charged, an\r\n      additional biological specimen must be submitted for court purposes.\r\n      This search was conducted by Lieutenant David McClure with the\r\n      South Carolina Law Enforcement Division\r\n\r\nThe admission of this letter will only constitute reversible error if it was a\r\nprejudicial abuse of discretion. State v. Clasby, 385 S.C. 148, 682 S.E.2d 892\r\n(2009). While we do not condone the publishing of this letter to the jury, its\r\nadmission does not amount to reversible error. The evidence contained in this letter\r\nwas merely cumulative to other evidence of Appellant's DNA being in the CODIS\r\ndatabase. Accordingly, we find that the publication of this letter was harmless in\r\nlight of the other evidence which was admitted without objection.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the State never tried to introduce evidence why Appellant's DNA was in\r\nthe database, and there was no reference to nor indication of any previous crime\r\nAppellant committed. The most that can be said about this letter is that it could\r\nhave created an inference in a juror's mind that Appellant had a criminal history.\r\nThis Court has held that such a speculative inference does not amount to\r\n\nprejudicial error. See State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 13, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514 (1998)\r\n(noting that an inadvertent vague reference to defendant's prior record will not\r\namount to prejudicial error). Thus, the circuit court's admission of this letter, while\r\nerror, does not entitle Appellant to reversal of his convictions.\r\n\r\n          3. Did the circuit court err in granting the State a six-month\r\n             continuance under the IAD?\r\nAppellant argues that the circuit court's grant of a six-month continuance to the\r\nState violated the IAD. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe IAD is a compact enabling participating states to obtain custody of prisoners\r\nincarcerated in other participating jurisdictions and bring those prisoners to trial.\r\nReed v. Farley, 512 U.S. 339, 340 (1994). The central purpose of the IAD is to\r\nallow participating states to uniformly and expeditiously dispose of charges\r\npending against prisoners held out of state. S.C. Code Ann. § 17–11–10 (2003);\r\nState v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 370, 580 S.E.2d 785, 790 (Ct. App. 2003). At issue\r\nhere is Article III, which provides for the resolution of detainers based on untried\r\nindictments or complaints against a prisoner. Article III was triggered by\r\nAppellant's filing a request for a \"final disposition,\" and under the IAD, that\r\nrequest requires that Appellant be tried within 180-days unless a proper\r\ncontinuance is granted. § 17-11-10.\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the State's continuance was not proper under Article III,\r\nwhich in relevant part provides:\r\n\r\n      Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a\r\n      penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during\r\n      the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any\r\n      other party state any untried indictment, information or complaint on\r\n      the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he\r\n      shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall\r\n      have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the\r\n      appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written\r\n      notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final\r\n      disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint;\r\n      provided, that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his\r\n      counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may\r\n      grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. . .\r\n\r\n      S.C. Code Ann. § 17-11-10 (2003).\r\n\nAppellant contends that the circuit court erred in granting the State a continuance\r\non March 1, 2011, the 180th and last day before the limit expired because the State\r\nfailed to show \"good cause,\" and the continuance was neither \"necessary\" nor\r\n\"reasonable.\" Appellant contends that this late grant of continuance was improper,\r\nand therefore, he is entitled to dismissal of all charges. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThis Court has not addressed the standard of review for determining whether an\r\nIAD continuance was granted on \"good cause.\" In South Carolina \"[t]he grant or\r\ndenial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and is\r\nreviewable on appeal only when an abuse of discretion appears from the record.”\r\nPlyler v. Burns, 373 S.C. 637, 650, 647 S.E.2d 188, 195 (2007). We see no reason\r\nfor this to change in the context of the IAD. Thus, we will reverse a circuit court's\r\ndecision to grant a continuance under the IAD only when it amounts to an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the State presented multiple reasons why a continuance was needed.\r\nThese included: the complexity of the case, the special preparations required to try\r\na case of this magnitude, i.e. a double murder and a burglary in the first-degree,\r\nand the need for a Schmerber hearing to be conducted.\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that these reasons are insufficient to satisfy the \"good cause\"\r\nrequirement for a continuance under Art. III of the IAD. We disagree.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, the judge acknowledged that he was very familiar with the\r\ncomplexities of this case, since he was the trial judge for the Gagnon trial, and that\r\nhe believed this case, like the Gagnon case, would be an extremely complicated\r\nproceeding. We find this statement supports the State's position that this trial was\r\ngoing to be a complex and intensive trial. Further, this was a double homicide, and\r\nother courts have considered the magnitude of the crime in determining whether\r\nthere was good cause for delay. See State v. Aguero, 791 N.W.2d 1, 7 (N.D. 2010)\r\n(in the context of an IAD continuance, \"[in] considering the length of time of the\r\ndelay, we have said, [t]he allowable delay for a minor street crime is considerably\r\nless than that for a more serious and complex charge.\") (citations and quotations\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\nFurther, while the State is at least partially at fault for the delay in seeking the new\r\nSchmerber hearing, it is undeniable that a Schmerber hearing was required, as this\r\ncase depended on matching Appellant's DNA with the DNA found at the scene.\r\nAccordingly, with the complexity of this case and the need for a Schmerber\r\nhearing, we hold that the decision to grant a continuance did not amount to a\r\nprejudicial abuse of discretion.\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27412","title":"Robert Harrell v.

We\r\nreverse.                 FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n        On February 14, 2013, the Attorney General received an ethics complaint,\r\nalleging possible violations of the Ethics Act by the Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, Robert W. Harrell, Jr. (the Speaker), originally submitted by a\r\nprivate citizen to the House Legislative Ethics Committee (House Ethics\r\nCommittee).2 That same day, the Attorney General forwarded the complaint to\r\nSouth Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), and SLED carried out a 10-\r\nmonth criminal investigation into the matter. At the conclusion of the\r\ninvestigation, the Chief of SLED and the Attorney General petitioned the presiding\r\njudge of the state grand jury to impanel the state grand jury on January 13, 2014.\r\nActing presiding judge of the state grand jury, the Honorable L. Casey Manning,\r\nsubsequently impaneled the state grand jury.3\r\n\r\n      On February 24, 2014, the Speaker filed a motion to disqualify the Attorney\r\nGeneral from participating in the state grand jury investigation. On March 21,\r\n2014, a hearing was held on the motion. Following that hearing, the court sua\r\nsponte raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, and another hearing was held\r\non May 2, 2014, to address the jurisdictional issue.\r\n\r\n       By order dated May 12, 2014, the court found it—as presiding judge of the\r\nstate grand jury—\"lack[ed] subject matter jurisdiction\" to hear any matter arising\r\nfrom the Ethics Act, and refused to reach the issue of disqualification. In essence,\r\nthe court found that because the complaint was civil in nature, the state grand jury\r\nlacked criminal jurisdiction to investigate, and likewise, the Attorney General\r\nlacked the authority to investigate absent a referral from the House Ethics\r\nCommittee. More specifically, the court found \"that ethics investigations\r\n\r\n1   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 8-13-100 to -1520 (Supp. 2013).\r\n2   There is no House Ethics Committee investigation currently pending.\r\n3 The details of the impaneling petition are not public, have not been provided to\r\nthe Speaker, and were not placed into evidence in the court below when this matter\r\nwas heard.\r\n\nconcerning members and staff of the Legislature are solely within the Legislature's\r\npurview to the exclusion of the Courts,\" and, as such, any alleged criminal\r\nviolations which arise out of the Ethics Act must be referred from the legislative\r\ninvestigative body to the Attorney General. Citing Rainey v. Haley, 404 S.C. 320,\r\n327–28, 745 S.E.2d 81, 85 (2013), the court found the Attorney General's\r\ninvestigation \"premature\" because the Ethics Act's \"administrative remedies have\r\nnot been exhausted.\" Finally, the court held that its exercise of jurisdiction over\r\nthe present action would contravene principles of the separation of powers. Thus,\r\nthe court discharged the state grand jury and ordered the Attorney General to cease\r\nhis criminal investigation.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 The circuit court specifically stated that its order was not issued pursuant to\r\nsection 14-7-1630(G) of the South Carolina Code, and ordered the Attorney\r\nGeneral and state grand jury to cease investigating this matter because \"subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction was lacking . . . ab initio.\" See S.C. Code Ann. § 14-7-1630(G)\r\n(Supp. 2013) (\"If . . . the presiding judge determines that the state grand jury is not\r\nconducting investigative activity within its jurisdiction or proper investigative\r\nactivity, the presiding judge may limit the investigation so that the investigation\r\nconforms with the jurisdiction of the state grand jury and existing law or he may\r\ndischarge the state grand jury. An order issued pursuant to this subsection or\r\npursuant to subsection (F) . . . may be appealed by the Attorney General to the\r\nSupreme Court. If an appeal from the order is made, the state grand jury, except as\r\nis otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court, shall continue to exercise its powers\r\npending disposition of the appeal.\"). On May 19, 2014, the Attorney General filed\r\na \"Petition for Supersedeas and Interim Relief pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 14-7-\r\n1630(G)\" in this Court. By order dated May 20, 2014, we found the motion was\r\nunnecessary because the order was automatically stayed pending appeal pursuant\r\nto section 14-7-1630(G). Therefore, the state grand jury investigation is ongoing.\r\n\n      The Attorney General appealed pursuant to sections 14-7-1630(G) and 14-8-\r\n200(b)(6)5 of the South Carolina Code and Rule 203(d)(1)(A)(v), SCACR.6 By\r\norder dated May 19, 2014, this appeal was expedited.\r\n\r\n                                        ISSUE\r\n\r\n      Whether the circuit court erred in discharging the state grand jury\r\n      after finding that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate allegations\r\n      stemming from violations of the Ethics Act?\r\n\r\n\r\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      \"Appellate courts are bound by fact findings in response to motions\r\npreliminary to trial when the findings are supported by the evidence and not clearly\r\nwrong or controlled by error of law.\" State v. Amerson, 311 S.C. 316, 320, 428\r\nS.E.2d 871, 873 (1993).               ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      I. Jurisdiction\r\n\r\n       The Ethics Act is \"a comprehensive statutory scheme for regulating the\r\nbehavior of elected officials, public employees, lobbyists, and other individuals\r\nwho present for public service.\" Rainey, 404 S.C. at 323, 745 S.E.2d at 83\r\n(citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5See S.C. Code Ann. § 14-8-200(b)(6) (Supp. 2013) (\"Jurisdiction of the court\r\ndoes not extend to appeals of the following, the appeal from which lies of right\r\ndirectly to the Supreme Court: . . . an order limiting an investigation by a state\r\ngrand jury pursuant to Section 14-7-1630 . . . .\").\r\n6See Rule 203(d)(1)(A)(v), SCACR (\"The notice of appeal shall be filed with the\r\nclerk of the lower court and with the Clerk of the Supreme Court in the following\r\ncases: . . . Any order limiting an investigation by a State Grand Jury under S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 14-7-1630.\").\r\n\n      To enforce the Ethics Act, the General Assembly created the State Ethics\r\nCommission and the Senate and House Legislative Ethics Committees. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. §§ 8-13-310, -510 (Supp. 2013). \"[T]he House and Senate Legislative\r\nCommittees are charged with the exclusive responsibility for the handling of ethics\r\ncomplaints involving members of the General Assembly and their staff.\" Rainey,\r\n404 S.C. at 324, 745 S.E.2d at 83 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       The House Ethics Committee must conduct its investigation of a complaint\r\nfiled pursuant to the Ethics Act in accordance with section 8-13-540. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 8-13-540 (Supp. 2013). This section provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n      If after [a] preliminary investigation, the ethics committee finds that\r\n      probable cause exists to support an alleged violation, it shall, as\r\n      appropriate:\r\n\r\n            (a) render an advisory opinion to the respondent and\r\n            require the respondent's compliance within a reasonable\r\n            time; or\r\n\r\n            (b) convene a formal hearing on the matter within thirty\r\n            days of the respondent's failure to comply with the\r\n            advisory opinion. All ethics committee investigations and\r\n            records relating to the preliminary investigation are\r\n            confidential. No complaint shall be accepted which is\r\n            filed later than four years after the alleged violation\r\n            occurred.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-540(1)(a)–(b). Following a formal hearing, if the\r\ncommittee finds that a member has violated the Ethics Act, the Act requires the\r\ncommittee to:\r\n\r\n      (a) administer a public or private reprimand;\r\n\r\n      (b) determine that a technical violation as provided for in Section 8-\r\n      13-1170 has occurred;\r\n\r\n      (c) recommend expulsion of the member; and/or,\r\n\n        (d) in the case of an alleged criminal violation, refer the matter to the\r\n        Attorney General for investigation.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-540(3)(a)–(d) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n        The circuit court read into section 8-13-540(3)(d) a requirement that a House\r\nEthics Committee investigation and referral occur prior to the Attorney General's\r\ninitiation of his own criminal investigation, which the Attorney General argues was\r\nclearly erroneous in light of our constitution and this Court's precedents. We\r\nagree. In State v. Thrift, this Court announced that legislative jurisdiction over\r\nviolations of the Ethics Act is civil in nature. See Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 440 S.E.2d\r\n341 (1994). There, the State appealed a pre-trial order of the circuit court\r\ndismissing the indictments against multiple defendants charged with public\r\ncorruption. Id. at 287, 440 S.E.2d at 344. The State in Thrift submitted that if the\r\nCourt interpreted a prior version of the Ethics Act7 to require the State Ethics\r\nCommission to refer criminal allegations to the Attorney General as a precondition\r\nto the institution of a criminal investigation in every prosecution, then the referral\r\nscheme was unconstitutional. Id. at 307, 440 S.E.2d at 355.\r\n\r\n      Noting that the State possesses \"wide latitude in selecting what cases to\r\nprosecute and what cases to plea bargain,\" the Court observed that the Attorney\r\nGeneral's authority to prosecute derives from our state constitution and thus\r\n\"cannot be impaired by legislation.\" Thrift, 312 S.C. at 307, 440 S.E.2d at 355; see\r\nS.C. Const. art. V, § 24 (providing that \"[t]he Attorney General shall be the chief\r\nprosecuting officer of the State with authority to supervise the prosecution of all\r\ncriminal cases in courts of record\"). Therefore, the Court deemed any requirement\r\nplacing the power \"to supervise the prosecution of a criminal case in the hands of\r\nthe Ethics Commission\" unconstitutional. Id.\r\n\r\n      However, \"by recognizing the civil nature of the Ethics Act complaint,\" the\r\nCourt avoided the constitutional problem caused by the referral language of the old\r\nscheme, and concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7   See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 8-13-10 to -1020 (1986).\r\n\n      In light of our narrow construction of the statute, . . . . the referral\r\n      system only applies to civil complaints to the Ethics Commission\r\n      which are referred by it to the Attorney General for criminal\r\n      prosecution. The absence of a complaint to the Ethics Commission\r\n      will never operate as a limitation upon the State's independent right\r\n      to initiate a criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Rather than looking to Thrift, the circuit court found that the House Ethics\r\nCommittee had exclusive jurisdiction over this matter, relying on the more recent\r\ncase, Rainey v. Haley. See 404 S.C. at 322, 745 S.E.2d at 82.\r\n\r\n       In Rainey, the appellant sought a civil declaratory judgment in the court of\r\ncommon pleas that Governor Nikki Haley was criminally culpable for ethical\r\nviolations allegedly committed while she was a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives. 404 S.C. at 322, 745 S.E.2d at 82. We affirmed the circuit court's\r\ndismissal of the action for lack of jurisdiction, finding the House Ethics Committee\r\nhad exclusive jurisdiction to hear a civil ethics complaint against one of its\r\nmembers. Id.8\r\n\r\n       Other than the particular situation defined in section 8-13-530(4), we stated\r\n\"the Legislature has granted exclusive authority over ethical complaints to the\r\nappropriate Ethics Committee\" and \"it is therefore clear the Legislature intended\r\nthe respective Ethics Committee to otherwise have exclusive authority to hear\r\nalleged ethics violations of its own members and staff.\" Id. at 325–26, 745 S.E.2d\r\nat 84. Finally, we opined:\r\n\r\n\r\n8 In so holding, we noted that the statutory scheme permitted court intervention to\r\nthe exclusion of the House Ethics Committee in the limited situation outlined in\r\nsection 8-13-530(4) of the South Carolina Code. Rainey, 404 S.C. at 325, 745\r\nS.E.2d at 83–84 (citation omitted); see S.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-530(4) (Supp. 2013)\r\n(\"No complaint may be accepted by the ethics committee concerning a member of\r\nor candidate for the appropriate house during the fifty-day period before an\r\nelection in which the member or candidate is a candidate. During this fifty-day\r\nperiod, any person may petition the court of common pleas alleging the violations\r\ncomplained of and praying for appropriate relief by way of mandamus or\r\ninjunction, or both.\").\r\n\n      [T]he South Carolina Constitution and this Court have expressly\r\n      recognized and respected the Legislature's authority over the conduct\r\n      of its own members. Consequently, a court's exercise of jurisdiction\r\n      over Appellant's ethical complaint against Governor Haley would not\r\n      only contravene the clear language of the State Ethics Act, it would\r\n      also violate separation of powers.\r\n\r\n            In sum, ethics investigations concerning members and staff of\r\n      the Legislature are intended to be solely within the Legislature's\r\n      purview, to the exclusion of the courts, except in the singular\r\n      circumstance expressly provided for in section 8-13-530(4).\r\n\r\nId. at 326–27, 745 S.E.2d at 84–85 (footnotes omitted) (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       Here, the circuit court placed great significance on the \"exclusivity\"\r\nlanguage in Rainey, but failed to consider that case in context: a civil declaratory\r\njudgment action. Rainey does not affect the clear and unambiguous holding of\r\nThrift, as Rainey addressed the civil regulatory function of the House Ethics\r\nCommittee and not a criminal prosecution. Consequently, Rainey is\r\ndistinguishable, and the circuit court erred in relying on it for the proposition that\r\nthe House Ethics Committee has exclusive jurisdiction over this matter.\r\nFurthermore, the circuit court's finding that a referral from the House Ethics\r\nCommittee was required before the Attorney General could initiate a criminal\r\ninvestigation into this matter not only contravenes Thrift, but more importantly,\r\nruns afoul of Article V, section 24 of our constitution.\r\n\r\n       While the Speaker concedes that Thrift applies here, he contends that the\r\nAttorney General mischaracterizes the circuit court's order, asserting that because\r\nthe court found that the allegations were \"conclusively within the Ethics Code\" and\r\nthe \"Attorney General has failed to offer or present to the Court any evidence or\r\nallegations which are criminal in nature,\" in the absence of evidence of conduct\r\nconstituting a crime, neither the Attorney General nor the state grand jury\r\ninvestigations may proceed without a referral from the House Ethics Committee.\r\n\r\n      The problem with the Speaker's argument is that it presumes that any\r\ncomplaint originating as a violation of the Ethics Act can never be criminal in\r\nnature. To the contrary, section 8-13-1520 provides:\r\n\r\n      (A) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, a person\r\n      who violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor\r\n\n      and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five thousand\r\n      dollars or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\r\n\r\n      (B) A person who violates any provision of this Article 13 is guilty of\r\n      a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than\r\n      five hundred percent of the amount of contributions or anything of\r\n      value that should have been reported pursuant to the provisions of this\r\n      Article 13 but not less than five thousand dollars or imprisoned for not\r\n      more than one year, or both.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 8-13-1520 (Supp. 2013). Thus, the Ethics Act criminalizes\r\nviolations, and it is in in the Attorney General's exclusive discretion to prosecute\r\nsuch violations.9 This discretion, while not limitless, is undoubtedly broad. In\r\nThrift, this Court explained:\r\n\r\n      Both the South Carolina Constitution and South Carolina case law\r\n      place the unfettered discretion to prosecute solely in the prosecutor's\r\n      hands. The Attorney General as the State's chief prosecutor may\r\n      decide when and where to present an indictment, and may even decide\r\n      whether an indictment should be sought. Prosecutors may pursue a\r\n      case to trial, or they may plea bargain it down to a lesser offense, or\r\n      they can simply decide not to prosecute the offense in its entirety. The\r\n      Judicial Branch is not empowered to infringe on the exercise of this\r\n      prosecutorial discretion; however, on occasion, it is necessary to\r\n      review and interpret the results of the prosecutor's actions. We must,\r\n      therefore, analyze the State's agreement within our judicial\r\n      constraints.\r\n\r\n312 S.C. at 291–92, 440 S.E.2d at 346–47 (footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\n       The House Ethics Committee's concurrent civil regulatory authority does not\r\naffect the Attorney General's authority to initiate a criminal investigation in any\r\nway, whether or not there is a referral, or even a pending House investigation. We\r\nliken the House Ethics Committee's authority to govern its members to that of the\r\nlegal, medical, or any other professional field where, by virtue of receiving a\r\nlicense to practice the profession, the member's behavior is policed by a\r\n\r\n9 At oral argument, the Attorney General stated that the decision to prosecute\r\nalleged violations of the Ethics Act hinges upon whether the conduct constituting\r\nthe violation is intentional.\r\n\nprofessional organization. For example, a doctor is subject to oversight by the\r\nSouth Carolina Board of Medical Examiners (the Board) and may have his or her\r\nmedical license rescinded in disciplinary proceedings, while simultaneously being\r\nthe focus of a criminal investigation and prosecution, all for the same behavior.\r\nJust as a decision (or lack thereof) by the Board would not delay or interrupt a\r\nconcurrent criminal investigation, the status of a House Ethics Committee\r\ninvestigation cannot affect the Attorney General's decision regarding a criminal\r\nprosecution. Thus, we find that the Attorney General's investigation is not\r\ncircumscribed by the nature of the complaint that triggered the investigation, and\r\nwhether or not it arises as an alleged violation of the Ethics Act is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n    Therefore, the circuit court erred in concluding that the House Ethics\r\nCommittee has exclusive jurisdiction over this complaint.\r\n\r\n      II. Discharging the State Grand Jury\r\n\r\n        Having decided that the court erred in finding it was without jurisdiction as\r\npresiding judge of the state grand jury to hear these matters, we reiterate that while\r\nits rationale was misplaced, the court acted well within its statutory authority in\r\nassessing the jurisdiction of the state grand jury beyond the impanelment stage.\r\n\r\n       \"Subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the\r\ngeneral class to which the proceedings in question belong.\" Skinner v.\r\nWestinghouse Elec. Corp., 380 S.C. 91, 93, 668 S.E.2d 795, 796 (2008) (citations\r\nomitted). \"South Carolina circuit courts are vested with original jurisdiction in\r\ncivil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction shall be\r\ngiven to inferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as provided by\r\nlaw.\" Rainey, 404 S.C. at 323, 745 S.E.2d at 83 (citing S.C. Const. art. V, § 11).\r\n\"In determining whether the Legislature has given another entity exclusive\r\njurisdiction over a case, a court must look to the relevant statute.\" Id. (quoting\r\nDema v. Tenet Physician Servs.–Hilton Head, Inc., 383 S.C. 115, 121, 678 S.E.2d\r\n430, 433 (2009)).\r\n\r\n       The state grand jury's authority \"extends throughout the State.\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 14-7-1630(A) (Supp. 2013). However, despite its statewide reach, \"its\r\njurisdiction is limited to certain offenses\" enumerated in section 14-7-1630. State\r\nv. Wilson, 315 S.C. 289, 291, 433 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1993) (citation omitted).\r\nRelevant to this case, the subject matter jurisdiction of a state grand jury covers \"a\r\ncrime, statutory, common law or other, involving public corruption as defined in\r\n\n[s]ection 14-7-1615,[10] a crime, statutory, common law or other, arising out of or\r\nin connection with a crime involving public corruption . . . , and any attempt,\r\naiding, abetting, solicitation, or conspiracy to commit a crime, statutory, common\r\nlaw or other, involving public corruption . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 14-7-1630(A)(3)\r\n(Supp. 2013).\r\n\r\n      The Attorney General may seek impanelment of the state grand jury\r\n\"[w]henever the Attorney General and the Chief of [SLED] consider it necessary\r\nand normal investigative or prosecutorial procedures are not adequate.\" Id. § 14-7-\r\n1630(B).In such a case, \"the Attorney General may petition in writing to the chief\r\nadministrative judge of the judicial circuit in which he seeks to impanel a state\r\ngrand jury for an order impaneling a state grand jury.\" Id. § 14-7-1630(B) (Supp.\r\n2013). The petition for impanelment \"must allege the type of offenses to be\r\ninquired into\" and \"in all instances must specify that the public interest is served by\r\nthe impanelment.\" Id. After \"due consideration,\" the impaneling judge \"may order\r\nthe impanelment of a state grand jury in accordance with the petition for a term of\r\ntwelve calendar months.\" Id. § 14-7-1630(D).\r\n\r\n      Once impaneled, the statute further charges the presiding judge of the state\r\ngrand jury to hear matters pertaining to the state grand jury proceedings:\r\n\r\n\r\n10Public corruption is broadly defined as \"any unlawful activity, under color of or\r\nin connection with any public office or employment,\" by:\r\n\r\n      (1) any public official, public member, or public employee, or the\r\n      agent, servant, assignee, consultant, contractor, vendor, designee,\r\n      appointee, representative, or any other person of like relationship, by\r\n      whatever designation known, of any public official, public member, or\r\n      public employee under color of or in connection with any public\r\n      office or employment; or\r\n\r\n      (2) any candidate for public office or the agent, servant, assignee,\r\n      consultant, contractor, vendor, designee, appointee, representative of,\r\n      or any other person of like relationship, by whatever name known, of\r\n      any candidate for public office.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 14-7-1615(B)(1)–(3) (Supp. 2013).\r\n\n      Except for the prosecution of cases arising from indictments issued by\r\n      the state grand jury, the presiding judge has jurisdiction to hear all\r\n      matters arising from the proceedings of a state grand jury, including,\r\n      but not limited to, matters relating to the impanelment or removal of\r\n      state grand jurors, the quashing of subpoenas, the punishment for\r\n      contempt, and the matter of bail for persons indicted by a state grand\r\n      jury.\r\n\r\nId. § 14-7-1730 (Supp. 2013). Moreover,\r\n\r\n      If . . . the presiding judge determines that the state grand jury is not\r\n      conducting investigative activity within its jurisdiction or proper\r\n      investigative activity, the presiding judge may limit the investigation\r\n      so that the investigation conforms with the jurisdiction of the state\r\n      grand jury and existing law or he may discharge the state grand jury.\r\n\r\nId. § 14-7-1630(G).\r\n\r\n      Plainly, the statute contemplates assessment of jurisdiction by the presiding\r\njudge beyond the impanelment stage and discharging the state grand jury as a\r\npossible outcome.\r\n\r\n       While the crime of public corruption could include violations of the Ethics\r\nAct, the state grand jury's jurisdiction is confined to the purposes set forth in the\r\nconstitution and the state grand jury statute, as circumscribed by the impaneling\r\norder. While we reverse the circuit court's order, we in no way suggest that it was\r\nerror for the presiding judge to inquire whether the state grand jury was\r\n\"conducting investigative activity within its jurisdiction or proper investigative\r\nactivity.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 14-7-1630(G); cf. Thrift, 312 S.C. at 311 n.15, 440\r\nS.E.2d at 357 n.15 (noting that \"[t]he grand jury is more than a mere instrument of\r\nthe prosecution\").11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11Due to the secrecy afforded state grand jury proceedings, future arguments\r\nregarding jurisdiction, or any other ancillary matter, should be held in camera.\r\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the circuit court order, and remand\r\nthis case to the circuit court for a decision on whether the Attorney General should\r\nbe disqualified from participating in these state grand jury proceedings.12\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12At oral arguments, the Attorney General conceded that the motion for\r\ndisqualification was properly before the presiding judge at this stage of the\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27413","title":"In the Interest of Stephen W.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27413.pdf","description":"In this direct appeal, the Court finds that the state and federal constitutions do not entitle juveniles to a jury trial in family court delinquency proceedings.","date":"2014-07-16","type":"opinion","text":"                     THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                          In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n             In the Interest of Stephen W., a Juvenile Under the Age\r\n             of Seventeen, Appellant.\r\n\r\n             Appellate Case No. 2012-213481\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Appeal from Richland County \n\r\n                       Angela R.

Farthing, both of Columbia, for\r\n             Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: In this direct appeal from an adjudication of\r\ndelinquency in family court, Appellant assigns error to the denial of his motion for\r\na jury trial in a family court juvenile proceeding. Because there is no constitutional\r\nright to a jury trial in a family court juvenile proceeding, we affirm.\r\n\r\n                                          I.\r\n\r\nIn August 2012, Appellant, then sixteen years of age, was charged with possession\r\nof marijuana. The matter was referred to the family court, where by way of\r\n\npetition, the case was presented to the court. At the adjudicatory hearing,\r\nAppellant moved for a jury trial, claiming that he was entitled to a jury trial under\r\nthe United States and South Carolina Constitutions. The family court denied\r\nAppellant's motion.\r\n\r\nThe hearing consisted of the officer's testimony, explaining his foot pursuit of\r\nAppellant. During the pursuit, Appellant removed items from his pocket and\r\ndiscarded them. After Appellant was detained, three plastic baggies containing\r\nmarijuana were retrieved from the area where Appellant had placed the items.\r\nAppellant testified, denying any knowledge of the drugs. The family court\r\nadjudicated Appellant delinquent and ordered that Appellant spend six consecutive\r\nweekends at the Department of Juvenile Justice, complete an alternative\r\neducational program, and continue with his prior probation1 for a period of time\r\nnot to exceed his eighteenth birthday or until he obtained a G.E.D. Appellant filed\r\nan appeal, which we certified pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                          II.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Children's Code provides that \"[a]ll cases of children must be\r\ndealt with as separate hearings by the court and without a jury.\" S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 63-3-590 (2010). The family court rules are in accord. See Rule 9(a), SCRFC\r\n(\"All hearings in the family courts shall be conducted by the court without a\r\njury.\"). Appellant contends this statute and family court rule violate his right to a\r\njury trial pursuant to the federal and state constitutions.\r\n\r\n\"This Court has a very limited scope of review in cases involving a constitutional\r\nchallenge to a statute.\" State v. Harrison, 402 S.C. 288, 292, 741 S.E.2d 727, 729\r\n(2013) (citing Joytime Distrib. & Amusement Co. v.

A.\r\n\r\nWe turn to the United States Supreme Court to resolve Appellant's federal\r\nconstitutional challenge. In McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, in a plurality opinion, six\r\nmembers of the United States Supreme Court agreed that pursuant to the federal\r\nconstitution, juveniles are not constitutionally entitled to a jury trial in adjudication\r\nproceedings. 403 U.S. 528, 530–57 (1971). We find no authority, and Appellant\r\ncites none, supporting his position. Appellant has not overcome the presumption\r\nof constitutionality regarding section 63-3-590. As a result, we reject Appellant's\r\nargument that the federal constitution guarantees him a right to a jury trial in a\r\nSouth Carolina family court juvenile delinquency proceeding.\r\n\r\n                                         B.\r\n\r\nIn examining Appellant's challenge pursuant to the South Carolina Constitution,\r\nwe begin with the constitutional guarantee to a jury trial, Article I, section 14:\r\n\r\n      The right of trial by jury shall be preserved inviolate. Any person\r\n      charged with an offense shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public\r\n      trial by an impartial jury . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. I, § 14. Appellant claims that the phrase \"[a]ny person charged\r\nwith an offense\" supports his claim that he is entitled to a jury trial since juveniles\r\nare \"persons\" under South Carolina law2 and the Children's Code refers to juvenile\r\ncharges as \"offenses.\"3 Appellant acknowledges, however, that the right to a jury\r\n\r\n2 See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. § 63-1-40(1) (2010) (generally defining \"child\" as a\r\n\"person under the age of eighteen\" in the context of the South Carolina Children's\r\nCode); id. § 63-19-20(1) (2010) (defining \"child\" or \"juvenile\" to mean \"a person\r\nless than seventeen years of age\" in the context of the South Carolina Juvenile\r\nJustice Code).\r\n3See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. § 63-19-360(4) (2010) (providing for juvenile detention\r\nservices for \"juveniles charged with having committed a criminal offense who are\r\n\ntrial under Article I, section 14 turns on whether a right to a jury trial was in\r\nexistence at the time the Constitution was enacted. Indeed, this provision\r\n\"securing the right of trial by jury, [is] to be read in the light of the law existing at\r\nthe adoption of the constitution. [It was] not designed to extend the right of trial by\r\njury, but simply to secure that right as it then existed.\" City Council of Anderson v.\r\nO'Donnell, 29 S.C. 355, 367, 7 S.E. 523, 528 (1888) (emphasis added). Thus,\r\n\"[t]he right to a trial by jury is guaranteed in every case in which the right to a jury\r\nwas secured at the time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1868.\" Mims\r\nAmusement Co. v. S.C. Law Enforcement Div., 366 S.C. 141, 149, 621 S.E.2d 344,\r\n348 (2005) (citing Medlock v. 1985 Ford F-150 Pick Up, 308 S.C. 68, 70–71, 417\r\nS.E.2d 85, 86 (1992)). \"The right to a jury trial [also] encompasses forms of action\r\nthat have arisen since the adoption of the Constitution in those cases where the\r\nlater actions are of like nature to actions which were triable at common law at the\r\ntime of the adoption of the Constitution.\" Id.\r\n\r\nUnder the common law in existence at the time of the adoption of the South\r\nCarolina Constitution, juveniles were criminally prosecuted in a manner similar to\r\nadults and were entitled to the right to a jury trial. See, e.g., State v. Coleman, 54\r\nS.C. 162, 162–63, 31 S.E. 866, 866 (1899) (criminal prosecution of a child\r\nyounger than fourteen); State v. Toney, 15 S.C. 409, 409–14 (1881) (appeal of a\r\nconviction for malicious trespass obtained at a jury trial). At that time, South\r\nCarolina followed the \"rule of sevens\" when criminally prosecuting children.\r\nDodd v. Spartanburg Ry. Gas & Elec. Co., 95 S.C. 9, 15, 78 S.E. 525, 528 (1913).\r\n\"[A]t the common law, a child under seven years, is conclusively presumed\r\nincapable of committing any crime.\" Id. \"Between seven and fourteen, the law\r\nalso deems the child incapable; but only prima facie so; and evidence may be\r\nreceived to show a criminal capacity.\" Id. \"Over fourteen, infants, like all others,\r\nare prima facie capable; and he who would set up their incapacity must prove it.\"\r\nId.\r\n\r\nIn the early twentieth century, South Carolina began experimenting with\r\nalternative methods for handling juveniles charged with criminal offenses. See,\r\ne.g., Act No. 73, 1917 S.C. Acts 132–35. This eventually resulted in the creation\r\nof the South Carolina Children's Code. See S.C. Code Ann. § 63-19-10 to -2460\r\n\r\nfound, after a detention screening or detention hearing, to require detention or\r\nplacement outside the home pending an adjudication of delinquency or\r\ndispositional hearing\").\r\n\n(2010 & Supp. 2013). Indeed, the current family court juvenile adjudication\r\nprocess was not in existence at the time our Constitution was enacted. Thus, the\r\nfocus of our inquiry becomes whether the family court juvenile justice system is of\r\n\"like nature\" to juvenile criminal prosecutions at the time of the enactment of the\r\nConstitution. Mims Amusement Co., 366 S.C. at 149, 621 S.E.2d at 348.\r\n\r\nThe very nature of the juvenile system makes clear the family court juvenile\r\nadjudication is an inherently different process than a typical criminal prosecution.\r\nIndeed, \"[t]he primary purpose of the juvenile process is to exempt an infant from\r\nthe stigma of a criminal conviction and its attendant detrimental consequences.\" In\r\nre Skinner, 272 S.C. 135, 137, 249 S.E.2d 746, 746 (1978). \"South Carolina, as\r\nparens patriae, protects and safeguards the welfare of its children. Family Court is\r\nvested with the exclusive jurisdiction to ensure that, in all matters concerning a\r\nchild, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.\" Harris v.\r\nHarris, 307 S.C. 351, 353, 415 S.E.2d 391, 393 (1992) (citation omitted); see also\r\nState v. Cagle, 111 S.C. 548, 552, 96 S.E. 291, 292 (1918) (\"The state is vitally\r\ninterested in its youth, for in them is the hope of the future. It may therefore\r\nexercise large powers in providing for their protection and welfare.\").\r\n\r\nA brief overview of the family court juvenile justice system is illustrative. The\r\nChildren's Code broadly defines the class of people who may initiate juvenile\r\nadjudicatory proceedings, including parents, guardians, \"any person who has\r\nsuffered injury through the delinquency of a child, or an officer having an arrested\r\nchild in charge.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 63-19-1020 (2010). Once a case has been\r\ninitiated, a family court judge hears the matter and makes findings of fact. Id.\r\n§ 63-19-1410(A) (2010). The family court can adjudicate the juvenile as a\r\ndelinquent and has a wide variety of rehabilitative measures at its disposal,\r\nincluding probation, supervision, restitution, mentoring, treatment, or commitment\r\nto the Department of Juvenile Justice not to exceed the juvenile's twenty-first\r\nbirthday. Id. Critically, \"[n]o adjudication by the court of the status of a child is a\r\nconviction, nor does the adjudication operate to impose civil disabilities ordinarily\r\nresulting from conviction . . . . The disposition made of a child or any evidence\r\ngiven in court does not disqualify the child in a future civil service application or\r\nappointment.\" Id. § 63-19-1410(C).\r\n\r\nThese important distinctions between the family court juvenile adjudication\r\nprocess and the traditional criminal justice process demonstrate that the juvenile\r\nadjudication process in family court is not of a like nature or similar to the manner\r\n\nin which juveniles were criminally charged at the time the Constitution was\r\nenacted.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Sabrina\r\n            C. Todd, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of\r\n            Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n            William Jones Rivers, III, of Darlington, pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office\r\nof Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\ndisbarment with conditions prior to seeking readmission. We accept the\r\nAgreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state. In\r\naddition, respondent shall comply with each of the conditions set forth hereafter in\r\nthis opinion prior to seeking readmission to the practice of law in this state. The\r\nfacts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                         Facts\r\n\r\n                            A. Self-Report and Background\r\n\r\nIn November 12, 2012, after learning his firm's trust account was being\r\ninvestigated by ODC, respondent self-reported his conduct to ODC. He explained\r\nthat his law partner, John Schurlknight (Partner), handled all of the firm's accounts,\r\nincluding its trust accounts. Respondent admitted that approximately six years\r\nbefore his self-report, Partner told him that the firm had a shortage in the trust\r\naccount. Partner's plan to resolve the issue was to use money belonging to other\r\nclients to keep the account afloat. Respondent did nothing to prevent the\r\nimplementation of this plan and, as a result, the firm began the self-perpetuating\r\ncycle of misappropriation of client funds. Respondent actively participated in this\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIn May 2011, Partner told respondent that the trust account was short a large sum\r\nowed to clients, Mr. and Mrs. A, and that Mr. and Mrs. A agreed to accept monthly\r\npayments until the entire amount was repaid. Again, respondent took no action to\r\nprotect the firm's clients, the firm's future clients, or third parties. On June 1, 2011,\r\nrespondent and Partner signed and gave Mr. and Mrs. A a promissory note\r\nacknowledging they owed them $1,695,000 and promised to pay $12,000 per\r\nmonth until the debt was satisfied. The debt was owed because Partner had\r\nmisappropriated proceeds on claims he settled without Mr. and Mrs. A's\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAlthough the exact manner in which the funds were misappropriated varied to\r\nsome extent from case to case, the firm settled many cases without the respective\r\nclients' knowledge or consent and misappropriated some or all of the proceeds.\r\nAttorneys and other staff members of the firm routinely signed the names of clients\r\nto settlement documents and endorsed their names on settlement checks.\r\nRespondent and Partner routinely lied to clients, medical providers, and other\r\nlienholders about the status of individual cases.\r\n\r\nThe ODC investigation that triggered respondent's November 12, 2012, self-report\r\narose from Partner's handling of Mrs. B's personal injury case and her husband's\r\nloss of consortium's claim. Partner failed to keep Mr. and Mrs. B informed of the\r\nstatus of their claims and settled their case for $103,000. The settlement\r\ndocuments bearing the couple's purported signatures were forgeries and the funds\r\n\nwere misappropriated. Mrs. B's medical bills, which exceeded the amount of\r\nsettlement, were not paid. Frustrated at her inability to receive information from\r\nPartner, Mrs. B went to attorney J. Ashley Twombley. Partner would not respond\r\nto Mr. Twombley's efforts to facilitate communication with Mr. and Mrs. B and\r\nignored demands for the file after Mrs. B hired Mr. Twombley. Mr. Twombley\r\ndiscovered the settlement without Partner's assistance and filed a complaint. Mr. B\r\nalso filed a complaint.\r\n\r\nPartner committed suicide on November 13, 2012. On November 20, 2012, the\r\nCourt placed respondent on interim suspension. In the Matter of Rivers, (S.C. Sup.\r\nCt. filed November 20, 2012) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 42 at 153). Many of the\r\nclients first learned their cases had been settled after they collected their files from\r\nthe attorney to protect clients' interests. The firm's accounts were overdrawn at\r\nthat time. Many clients also discovered their medical bills went unpaid and that\r\ntheir credit has been damaged.\r\n\r\nFor most clients, respondent or Partner held an extremely broad power of attorney\r\nsecured at the onset of representation. The power of attorney gave the attorney the\r\nauthority to:\r\n\r\n      sign [the client's] name to any documents, pleading, draft, release, or other\r\n      instrument in connection with this case or the settlement of the same and, to\r\n      endorse and deposit for payment any negotiable instrument and to disburse\r\n      the proceeds received.\r\n\r\nAlthough respondent and others at the law firm routinely signed clients' names to\r\nsettlement checks and documents, they never noted the signatures were affixed\r\npursuant to a power of attorney.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Although attorneys customarily have clients sign a power of attorney to\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nconvenience the client by facilitating the deposit of settlement proceeds, a client\r\ndoes not abdicate the right to be informed of settlement offers or the right to make\r\nsettlement decisions by signing a power of attorney. Further, no power of attorney\r\ncan obviate a lawyer's responsibility to \"abide by a client's decision whether to\r\nmake or accept an offer of settlement of a matter.\" Rule 1.2, Rules of Professional\r\nConduct, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n\nRespondent contends he did not personally take any of the stolen funds, but\r\nacknowledges that the firm's collection of fees in these cases as well as his\r\ncollection of any attendant salary was entirely inappropriate. Although respondent\r\nproduced some bank statements to Disciplinary Counsel during an interview, he\r\nwas unable to produce the vast majority of financial records required by Rule 417\r\nbecause the records were not maintained. As a result, a complete picture of\r\nreceipts and disbursements is not available.\r\n\r\nOn February 6, 2014, respondent pled guilty to one count of mail fraud in violation\r\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1341. He has yet to be sentenced, but in his plea agreement he\r\nagreed to surrender all assets that would be subject to forfeiture, to make full\r\nrestitution in an amount to be determined at sentencing, and to confess a monetary\r\njudgment in the amount of $1,248,135 representing the gross proceeds of the\r\nconduct underlying his conviction.\r\n\r\nThe Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection (Lawyers' Fund) received more than\r\n$1,286,000 in claims from respondent's clients and more than $3,800,000 in claims\r\nfrom Partner's clients. After investigating these claims and limiting individual\r\nclaims to $40,000 per client, the Lawyers' Fund approved more than $605,000 of\r\nthe claims involving respondent and $746,000 of those involving Partner. The\r\nLawyers' Fund then paid the maximum of $200,000 to respondent's clients and\r\n$200,000 to Partner's clients, with each client receiving a pro rata share of the\r\navailable funds. See Rule 411, SCACR.\r\n\r\n                               B. Respondent's Cases\r\n\r\n                                     Matter I\r\n\r\nIn February of 2012, respondent settled Client C's workers' compensation case for\r\n$110,000 without his client's knowledge and submitted a forged document to the\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission. To conceal the settlement, respondent then\r\nbegan sending Client C checks in roughly the amount of his temporary disability\r\npayments and explained that the change in the amount was an administrative issue.\r\nClient C discovered that his case had been settled only when he investigated why\r\nthe last two checks he received from the firm bounced.\r\n\n                                     Matter II\r\n\r\nIn March of 2011, respondent settled Client D's workers' compensation case for\r\n$25,000. Respondent submitted a forged document to the Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission and told Client D the case was still pending. The funds were\r\nmisappropriated. Client D learned of the settlement after respondent was placed on\r\ninterim suspension.                  Matter III\r\n\r\nRespondent settled Client E's workers' compensation case for $5,200 without\r\nClient E's consent and submitted a forged fee petition to the Workers'\r\nCompensation Commission indicating Client E would receive $3,354.48. The\r\nfunds were misappropriated.          Matter IV\r\n\r\nRespondent settled Client F's personal injury case for $50,000, but did not disburse\r\nany of the funds to Client F.        Matter V\r\n\r\nRespondent settled Client G's personal injury claim for a total of $110,000 without\r\nhis client's knowledge or consent. Respondent actively misled Client G about the\r\nstatus of his case. Client G learned of the settlement six months after it occurred\r\nand first received proceeds eight months after settlement. Client G's medical bills\r\ntotaling more than $35,000 were not paid; however, Client G was led to believe the\r\nbills had been paid.                 Matter VI\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Client H as personal representative of her mother's estate\r\nin the estate's wrongful death action. Respondent settled the action for $147,500.\r\nClient H was aware of the settlement but only received $1,000 of the $88,802.12\r\nthe estate was to receive.\r\n\n                                    Matter VII\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Client I in a personal injury case that was settled in 2004\r\nfor $75,000. Respondent advised Client I a large portion of the proceeds had to be\r\nset aside to pay his mounting medical bills, but then failed to pay several of those\r\nbills. Client I's file indicates only $21,711.12 of the proceeds were properly\r\ndisbursed.                          Matter VIII\r\n\r\nRespondent settled Client J's personal injury claims for a total of $66,666 without\r\nhis consent and told him his case was still pending. Client J learned his case was\r\nsettled more than one year after settlement when respondent was placed on interim\r\nsuspension.                          Matter IX\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Client K on her claims arising from an accident with an\r\nuninsured driver. Respondent settled Client K's claims against her insurance and\r\nher mother's insurance for a total available coverage of $75,000, but failed to\r\nsafeguard the proceeds. He paid Client K a total of $21,390.46 in two payments\r\nmore than a year later. Respondent did not pay her medical providers even though\r\nhe negotiated a reduced payment with at least one provider. Two of Client K's\r\nmedical providers have sent her bills to collections.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter X\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Client L in a personal injury case and agreed to accept a\r\nreduced fee in the event he could settle without litigation. Respondent was able to\r\nquickly settled her claims, but her care far exceed the $100,000 in available\r\ncoverage, and her medical bills were not finalized at the time of settlement.\r\nRespondent told Client L that the entire recovery would have to be paid to her\r\nmedical insurer. However, respondent never paid the medical insurer even though\r\nthe insurer was willing to settle its subrogation interest for $33,333.33 which\r\nwould have permitted Client L to have a recovery. All of the proceeds in Client L's\r\ncase were misappropriated.\r\n\n                                     Matter XI\r\n\r\nRespondent settled Client M's personal injury case for a total of $55,000. Client M\r\nwas unaware of the settlement and his name was forged on settlement documents.\r\nHe received no proceeds and his medical bills were not paid.\r\n\r\n                                    Matter XII\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Client N on a personal injury matter. Client N's medical\r\nbills exceeded $500,000. In total, respondent collected $100,000 in Client N's case\r\nfrom three different policies. Client N never saw the settlement checks, did not\r\nendorse them, and did not sign any settlement documents. Client N's file does not\r\nindicate any of the settlement proceeds were paid to his medical providers.\r\n\r\n                                    Matter XIII\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Client O in a personal injury claim arising from a slip and\r\nfall. Client O repeatedly asked respondent or his staff about her case and was\r\nrepeatedly told that the defendant would not offer a settlement. Upon review of\r\nher file after respondent's interim suspension, Client O discovered that respondent\r\nhad settled her case for $7,500 and that someone had forged her signature to the\r\ngeneral release.       C. Partner's Cases and Other Firm Cases2\r\n\r\n                                      Matter I\r\n\r\nThe firm represented Client P and his minor nephew in a personal injury case\r\narising from a car accident. Client P's signature was forged on the insurance\r\nrelease for his claim and he was not advised of the settlement for more than a year\r\nafter the proceeds were received. Client P also incurred $621.46 in interest on a\r\n$1,895 medical bill Partner falsely claimed he paid. Partner settled the minor's\r\nclaim for $100,000 and misappropriated the net proceeds of $40,008.92.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Respondent is responsible for Partner's misconduct because he ratified specific\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nacts of Partner's misconduct and was aware of Partner's practice of misconduct but\r\nfailed to take any reasonable remedial action. Rule 5.1, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n\n                                      Matter II\r\n\r\nClient Q and her son were injured in a car accident. Partner settled the claims for\r\n$10,900 without Client Q's knowledge in October 2012 and her signature was\r\nforged on the proceeds check. Partner thereafter lied to Client Q about the status\r\nof the case.                         Matter III\r\n\r\nRespondent initially represented Client R although her file was later assigned to an\r\nassociate. On the associate's cases, Partner assumed the role of negotiating and\r\npaying medical bills and Partner's staff prepared the settlement memos. Client R\r\nwas led to believe all of her medical bills were paid when her case settled,\r\nhowever, several bills totaling $1,903 were not paid.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter IV\r\n\r\nPartner and an associate handled multiple matters involving Client S's minor niece.\r\nThe child's father already had a workers' compensation and personal injury claim\r\narising from an automobile accident when he subsequently died in another\r\nautomobile accident. A year later, the child's mother was killed in a separate\r\nautomobile accident. The firm handled all claims related to both parents, but the\r\nminor child did not receive all proceeds to which she was entitled. Partner lied to\r\nat least one creditor about the status of the claims involving the mother's death and\r\nfalsely claimed her funeral bill was paid from settlement proceeds. Additionally,\r\nthe files contain several documents forged after the associate's departure from the\r\nfirm as well as records of one disbursement that did not occur.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter V\r\n\r\nClient T hired an associate in the firm to represent him in a personal injury case\r\narising from a serious automobile accident in North Carolina. Throughout the\r\ncase, Client T suffered diminished brain function that he asserted was caused by\r\nthe accident. The associate was admitted pro hac vice for Client T's litigation. No\r\nother attorney in the firm was admitted to the North Carolina Bar although Partner\r\nworked with the associate on the case. The associate remained involved in the case\r\nafter he left the firm.\r\n\nBecause of Client T's deteriorating health, Partner prepared and Client T executed\r\na power of attorney in favor of his brother, Mr. C. Partner and the associate\r\nattended mediation with Client T and Mr. C, but the mediation failed when Client\r\nT rejected a $400,000 settlement offer. Shortly after mediation, Partner settled the\r\ncase for $400,000 without the knowledge or consent of Client T or Mr. C. Client\r\nT's name was forged to settlement documents and Partner arranged to have the\r\nsettlement proceeds released to the firm rather than to the associate who was\r\ncounsel of record. Client T's endorsement was forged on the check and the\r\nproceeds were deposited into a South Carolina bank with no North Carolina\r\nbranches in violation of the North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct. Partner\r\nmisappropriated the proceeds. Partner also paid the associate a fee even though\r\nClient T had never agreed to a fee split. Client T acknowledges he received\r\nadvances from Partner, but the exact amount is in dispute. Client T filed a lawsuit\r\nwhich is currently pending. Partner's conduct violated numerous provisions of the\r\nNorth Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter VI\r\n\r\nPartner settled Client U's personal injury claim for $10,000 and his related property\r\nclaim for $2,500. Client U was unaware of the settlement and his signature was\r\nforged on the two releases sent to the liability insurance carrier. Client U did not\r\nreceive any proceeds and his file indicates his medical providers were not paid.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter VII\r\n\r\nA medical provider complained that the firm settled fifty-three (53) cases without\r\npaying the provider and falsely reported the cases had not yet settled. Respondent\r\nrepresented four (4) of the clients who bills were not paid. The provider reports\r\nthe unpaid bills exceed $250,000.    Matter VIII\r\n\r\nPartner represented Client V in a workers' compensation case and related personal\r\ninjury claim. The workers' compensation case settled, but the employer did not\r\nwaive its subrogation interest and put Partner and the at-fault driver on notice of its\r\nlien in the amount of $95,316.80. Thereafter, Partner settled the personal injury\r\nclaim and the proceeds were paid directly to the firm. Counsel for Client V's\r\n\nemployer approached Partner about the failure to honor the subrogation lien, but\r\nPartner failed to respond to requests for documentation of proceeds or\r\ndisbursements. The employer believes most or all of the proceeds were\r\nmisappropriated by the firm.         Matter IX\r\n\r\nPartner represented Client W in a personal injury case. Partner settled the case for\r\n$125,000 but actively lied to Client W about the status of the case. Client W\r\nlearned of the settlement after Partner's death. Client W never executed a power of\r\nattorney in favor of Partner or the firm, but discovered a forged power of attorney\r\nin favor of Partner in his file.     Matter X\r\n\r\nClient X hired Partner after settling her personal injury claim with the liability\r\ncarrier for the policy limits. Client X insisted Partner not settle her underinsured\r\nmotorist claim for less than the available coverage of $75,000. Partner thereafter\r\nsettled the claim for $25,000 without Client X's knowledge, lied to her about the\r\nstatus of the case, and misappropriated the money. When Client X confronted\r\nPartner about some of his lies, he admitted what he had done and paid her a total of\r\n$75,000, three times the amount he had collected on her behalf without her\r\npermission. The funds Partner used to pay Client X were misappropriated from\r\nother clients.                       Matter XI\r\n\r\nAn associate with the firm represented Client Y in a personal injury matter. The\r\nassociate settled the claim with Client Y's permission. Client Y was presented\r\nwith a settlement memo indicating all of her medical bills were paid, but none were\r\npaid at the time she received her portion of the proceeds. Eventually, two of her\r\nproviders were paid but the remaining medical bills, totaling $1,799.63, were never\r\npaid.                               Matter XII\r\n\r\nAttorney Eric Poulin reported that his office represents fifteen (15) clients whose\r\ncases respondent and Partner settled without the clients' knowledge. Respondent's\r\n\nfirm received a total of $304,153 in settlement proceeds on behalf of the clients.\r\nThe clients were unaware of the settlements and many of their medical bills were\r\nleft unpaid. One client whose case was settled for $100,000 received several small\r\npayments from the firm which he believed were advances against future proceeds.\r\nThe remaining clients received no proceeds. Additionally, Mr. Poulin represents a\r\nformer firm client whose claim was neither settled nor preserved before the\r\nexpiration of the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\n                                    Matter XIII\r\n\r\nPartner paid Client Z $1,000 to secure him as a client on his personal injury and\r\nworkers' compensation claims arising from a single accident. Partner failed to\r\nadequately communicate with Client Z and settled his claims without his\r\nknowledge. Although Partner never provided Client Z with a complete accounting\r\nof receipts and disbursements, Client Z acknowledges he received numerous\r\nadvances from Partner that may have equaled or exceeded the total proceeds\r\ncollected on his claims.            Matter XIV\r\n\r\nPartner settled Client AA's personal injury case for $23,500 shortly after receiving\r\nhis medical bills. Client AA was unaware of the settlement and approximately ten\r\nmonths later, Partner advised her he settled the case for $6,900. Partner paid Client\r\nAA $1,000 at that time and presented her with a settlement memo indicating her\r\nmedical providers were paid. She has since learned that Partner did not pay at least\r\none of her medical bills.           Matter XV\r\n\r\nPartner represented Client BB in a personal injury case. Partner settled Client BB's\r\ncase without his knowledge or consent. Client BB received no proceeds from the\r\nsettlement.                         Matter XVI\r\n\r\nPartner took over Client CC's personal injury case upon the departure of the\r\nassigned firm associate. Client CC's medical bills exceeded the amount of\r\navailable coverage. The settlements from Client CC's liability and underinsured\r\n\ncoverage claims totaled $197,000. Additionally, $1,000.00 in Med Pay and\r\n$5,000 in personal injury protection coverage were collected. Client CC was not\r\ninformed of the settlements, did not sign any of the settlement documents or\r\nchecks, and his file does not indicate how the proceeds were disbursed.\r\n\r\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall\r\nabide by client's decisions concerning objectives of representation); Rule 1.4\r\n(lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of matter and promptly\r\ninform client of decisions requiring client's informed consent); Rule 1.15 (lawyer\r\nshall safekeep client property); Rule 3.3 (lawyer shall not make false statement of\r\nfact to tribunal); Rule 4.1 (in course of representing client, lawyer shall not make\r\nfalse statement of material fact to third person); Rule 5.1(c) (lawyer shall be\r\nresponsible for misconduct of another lawyer when lawyer knows of and ratifies\r\nconduct or knows of conduct and fails to take reasonable remedial action); Rule\r\n5.3 (lawyer shall be responsible for misconduct of non-lawyer staff when lawyer\r\nknows of and ratifies staff's conduct or knows of conduct or fails to take reasonable\r\nremedial action); Rule 8.3(b) (when lawyer knows another lawyer has committed\r\nviolation of Rules of Professional Conduct that raises substantial question as to that\r\nlawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as lawyer in other respects, lawyer shall\r\ninform the appropriate professional authority); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to commit criminal act that reflects on lawyer's honesty,\r\ntrustworthiness, or fitness in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to commit criminal act involving moral turpitude); Rule\r\n8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving\r\ndishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to administration of\r\njustice).

Hewins contends the circuit court judge erred in ruling he was\r\ncollaterally estopped from challenging the search of his vehicle, which precipitated\r\nthe drug charge, because Hewins waived any challenge when he was convicted in\r\nmunicipal court of an open container violation resulting from the same search. We\r\nhold the conviction in municipal court had no preclusive effect on Hewins's ability\r\nto litigate his motion to suppress in circuit court. Moreover, we find the drug\r\n\nevidence should have been suppressed because it was discovered during an\r\nunlawful search. Accordingly, we reverse Hewins's conviction.\r\n\r\n                        I.    Factual / Procedural History\r\n\r\n        On September 15, 2009 at approximately 11:45 p.m., Officer Charles\r\nCothran of the Greenville Police Department was patrolling the area of Main Street\r\nand Stone Avenue when he observed a gold Cadillac make a left turn using a \"non-\r\nturning lane.\" As a result of the improper turn, Officer Cothran signaled for the\r\nvehicle to stop and Hewins pulled over into a nearby parking lot. Officer Cothran\r\ntestified that earlier in the evening he had seen Hewins driving this vehicle on two\r\noccasions in a \"high drug area.\"\r\n\r\n       Officer Cothran approached the vehicle and requested that Hewins provide\r\nhis driver's license, proof of insurance, and vehicle registration. According to\r\nOfficer Cothran, Hewins was \"extremely nervous,\" spoke with a \"quivering\" voice,\r\nand was rapidly breathing. Due to Hewins's behavior, Officer Cothran requested a\r\nbackup unit. Because Hewins was unable to locate his proof of insurance or\r\nvehicle registration, Officer Cothran returned to his patrol car and searched the\r\ncomputer database for this information and confirmed the vehicle was registered to\r\nHewins.As Officer Cothran was writing a warning citation, Officer Michael Loftis, a\r\nK-9 officer, arrived at the location. After Officer Cothran completed writing the\r\nwarning citation, he returned to give it to Hewins. When he approached the\r\nvehicle, he noticed that Hewins remained nervous and \"had not calmed down\"\r\ndespite the fact that he was not being given a traffic ticket. Based on this behavior,\r\nOfficer Cothran asked Hewins to exit the vehicle for safety reasons. He then\r\nconducted a pat down of Hewins and questioned him as to whether he had any\r\nguns, drugs, or explosives. Officer Cothran stated Hewins quickly responded that\r\nhe did not have drugs and continued to exhibit nervous behaviors. Officer Cothran\r\nindicated this response made him suspicious. As a result, he asked Hewins for\r\nconsent to search the vehicle. When Hewins refused, Officer Loftis proceeded to\r\nwalk his drug-detection dog around the vehicle. After Officer Loftis secured the\r\ndog, he informed Officer Cothran that the dog had \"alerted\" to the driver's side\r\ndoor. In turn, Officer Cothran conducted a search of the vehicle. The search of the\r\ncenter armrest console revealed a mini-bottle of vodka that had been opened and a\r\nTylenol bottle containing two, small \"rock-like white pebbles.\" A field test of the\r\n\nsubstance indicated the presence of cocaine. Officer Cothran arrested Hewins for\r\npossession of crack cocaine1 and issued him a ticket for the open container\r\nviolation.2\r\n\r\n       On October 8, 2009, Hewins appeared in municipal court and was convicted\r\nof the open container charge. The municipal court sentenced Hewins to time\r\nserved and ordered the payment of a fine in the amount of $262.50. Based on his\r\nmisunderstanding that Hewins had been convicted of possession of crack cocaine\r\nin municipal court, Officer Cothran authorized the destruction of the drug\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n       On May 4, 2010, a Greenville County grand jury indicted Hewins for\r\npossession of crack cocaine. Just prior to the start of the trial, Hewins moved to\r\nsuppress the drug evidence on the ground the search was unlawful. Although\r\ncounsel for Hewins admitted the initial traffic stop was valid, he asserted the\r\npurpose of the stop was concluded after Officer Cothran issued a warning citation\r\nfor the traffic offense. Counsel maintained that once the traffic stop was concluded\r\nany further detention or search was unlawful.\r\n\r\n      In response, the solicitor asserted Hewins was collaterally estopped from\r\nchallenging the propriety of the search because he had been convicted in municipal\r\n\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-375(A) (Supp. 2009) (\"A person possessing or\r\nattempting to possess less than one gram of methamphetamine or cocaine base, as\r\ndefined in Section 44-53-110, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction for\r\na first offense, must be imprisoned not more than three years or fined not more\r\nthan five thousand dollars, or both.\"). Because a 2010 amendment rewrote section\r\n44-53-375, we have cited to the code section in effect at the time of the offense.\r\n2  S.C. Code Ann. § 61-6-4020 (2009) (\"A person who is twenty-one years of age\r\nor older may transport lawfully acquired alcoholic liquors to and from a place\r\nwhere alcoholic liquors may be lawfully possessed or consumed; but if the cap or\r\nseal on the container has been opened or broken, it is unlawful to transport the\r\nliquors in a motor vehicle, except in the luggage compartment or cargo area. A\r\nperson who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction,\r\nmust be fined not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than\r\nthirty days.\"). We note that section 61-6-4020 was amended in 2011 to restructure\r\nthe provisions of the statute and to clarify what constitutes the cargo area of a\r\nvehicle. Because this amendment took effect after the date of the offense, we have\r\ncited to the code section in effect at the time of the offense.\r\n\ncourt for an offense that emanated from the same search. The solicitor explained\r\nthat the failure to challenge the search in municipal court constituted a waiver by\r\nHewins as to any further issue regarding the search. In support of this position, the\r\nsolicitor relied on the holding in State v. Snowdon, 371 S.C. 331, 638 S.E.2d 91\r\n(Ct. App. 2006), cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, 381 S.C. 171, 672\r\nS.E.2d 108 (2009).\r\n\r\n       In Snowdon, the defendant was arrested for breach of the peace. Id. at 332,\r\n638 S.E.2d at 92. During a search incident to the arrest, an officer discovered a\r\nsmall amount of marijuana in the defendant's wallet. Id. The defendant was\r\ncharged with breach of the peace and possession of marijuana. Id. After he pled\r\nguilty to breach of the peace in magistrate's court, the defendant sought to suppress\r\nthe introduction of the marijuana during his circuit court trial. Id. at 333, 638\r\nS.E.2d at 92. The circuit court determined that the defendant's guilty plea in\r\nmagistrate's court precluded him from contesting the legality of his arrest and, a\r\nfortiori, the search incident thereto. Id. The defendant was convicted of\r\npossession of marijuana and sentenced to one year in prison. Id.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. Id. at 334, 638 S.E.2d at 93. In\r\nso ruling, the court found the defendant, by having pled guilty to the breach of the\r\npeace charge, waived any objection he may have had to assert constitutionally\r\nbased violations attendant to his initial arrest and the legal consequences flowing\r\ntherefrom. Id. at 333, 638 S.E.2d at 93. Additionally, the court found the\r\ndefendant was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of the validity of his\r\narrest. Id. at 334, 638 S.E.2d at 93. Because the defendant had pled guilty to\r\nbreach of the peace, the court found the issue of whether there was probable cause\r\nto arrest him for that offense was necessarily determined in the magistrate court\r\nproceeding. Id. Thus, the court concluded the doctrine of collateral estoppel\r\nprevented the defendant from raising that issue again at his trial for possession of\r\nmarijuana. Id.\r\n\r\n       Counsel for Hewins disputed the applicability of Snowdon, arguing that\r\nHewins did not enter a guilty plea in municipal court. To counter this assertion,\r\nthe solicitor presented testimony from the records custodian for the City of\r\nGreenville Municipal Court. Although the Uniform Traffic Ticket indicated\r\nHewins appeared for a trial, the custodian testified her computer records reflected\r\nthat Hewins pled guilty.\r\n\r\n      Counsel for Hewins then resumed his argument and reiterated that Snowdon\r\nwas not applicable. Counsel explained that, unlike the related offenses in\r\n\nSnowdon, the magistrate court conviction for an open container violation was \"a\r\ncompletely separate case\" from the possession of crack cocaine offense.\r\nSpecifically, counsel pointed out that Hewins was not contesting a search incident\r\nto an arrest but, rather, a search following the issuance of a warning citation.\r\nFinally, counsel claimed there was no evidence that Hewins was represented by\r\ncounsel during the municipal court proceeding.\r\n\r\n      At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge granted the State's motion based\r\non Snowdon. Ultimately, the jury convicted Hewins of possession of less than one\r\ngram of crack cocaine. The trial judge sentenced Hewins to one year in prison.\r\nAfter Hewins appealed to the Court of Appeals, this Court certified the appeal\r\npursuant to Rule 204(b) of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.\r\n\r\n                            II.    Standard of Review\r\n\r\n       \"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\"\r\nState v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (citations omitted).\r\n\"We are bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly\r\nerroneous.\" Id. \"This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual\r\nfindings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.\" Id.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial\r\ncourt, and the court's decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\r\nState v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006). An abuse of\r\ndiscretion occurs when the decision of the trial court is based upon an error of law\r\nor upon factual findings that are without evidentiary support. Id.\r\n\r\n                                  III.   Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Arguments\r\n\r\n       Hewins contends the circuit court judge erred in ruling he was precluded\r\nfrom seeking the suppression of the crack cocaine based on Snowdon. In support\r\nof this contention, Hewins maintains Snowdon is not controlling as it is factually\r\ndistinguishable. Specifically, he asserts there is no evidence that definitively\r\nproves he pled guilty in municipal court as the notation on the Uniform Traffic\r\nTicket indicates he went to trial and there was a verdict of guilty. Moreover,\r\nHewins disputes the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel as the legality\r\nof the search was not at issue or actually litigated during the municipal court\r\nproceeding.\r\n\n      Additionally, because there is no evidence that Hewins had the benefit of\r\ncounsel for the municipal court proceeding, he asserts this uncounseled conviction\r\nshould not have been used against him in circuit court. Citing Argersinger v.\r\nHamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972) and its progeny,3 Hewins claims any use of his\r\nuncounseled municipal court conviction violated the Sixth Amendment.4\r\n\r\nB.    Analysis\r\n\r\n      1.     Snowdon is not dispositive\r\n\r\n       We hold the circuit court judge erred in relying on Snowdon as it is factually\r\ndistinguishable and, thus, not dispositive of the instant case. Initially, we find that\r\nHewins did not plead guilty as did the defendant in Snowdon. Instead, Hewins was\r\nconvicted in municipal court after a trial. Although there is conflicting testimony\r\non this point, the only official court record is the Uniform Traffic Ticket. This\r\ndocument reveals the following: (1) a trial was scheduled for October 8, 2009, (2)\r\nHewins appeared for this trial, (3) the trial was conducted by a trial officer, and (4)\r\na verdict of guilty was entered after the trial.\r\n\r\n       However, even if Hewins pled guilty in municipal court, we find there are\r\nsignificant differences between the facts of Snowdon and the instant case. In\r\nSnowdon, the defendant was arrested for breach of the peace. Snowdon, 371 S.C.\r\nat 332, 638 S.E.2d at 92. During a search incident to the arrest, an officer\r\ndiscovered a small amount of marijuana in the defendant's wallet. Id. The\r\ndefendant was charged with breach of the peace and possession of marijuana. Id.\r\n\r\n3 See Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 37 (1972) (holding that \"absent a\r\nknowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense,\r\nwhether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless he was represented by\r\ncounsel at his trial\"); see also Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 658 (2002)\r\n(finding \"a suspended sentence that may 'end up in the actual deprivation of a\r\nperson's liberty' may not be imposed unless the defendant was accorded 'the\r\nguiding hand of counsel' in the prosecution for the crime charged\" (quoting\r\nArgersinger, 407 U.S. at 40)).\r\n4  The circuit court judge did not rule on this issue. Thus, we find it is not\r\npreserved for our review. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d\r\n731, 733 (1998) (holding an issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the\r\ntrial court in order to be preserved for appellate review).\r\n\nAfter he pled guilty to breach of the peace in magistrate's court, the defendant\r\nsought to suppress the introduction of the marijuana during his circuit court trial.\r\nId. at 333, 638 S.E.2d at 92. The Court of Appeals found that Snowdon, having\r\npled guilty to breach of peace, \"waived any objection he may have had, and [could\r\nnot], therefore, assert constitutionally based violations attendant to his initial arrest\r\nand the legal consequences flowing therefrom.\" Id. at 333, 638 S.E.2d at 93.\r\n\r\n      In Snowdon, the Court of Appeals viewed the two offenses as inextricably\r\nlinked. Specifically, the breach of the peace arrest precipitated the search, which\r\nrevealed evidence that formed the basis of the marijuana charge. By failing to\r\nchallenge the initial arrest, the court found Snowdon waived any challenge to the\r\nconsequences stemming from this arrest.\r\n\r\n      In contrast, the search in the instant case was not incident to an arrest as it\r\nfollowed the officer's issuance of a traffic citation. Furthermore, the open\r\ncontainer charge was completely unrelated to the drug possession charge as the\r\ndiscovery of the vodka bottle did not precipitate the discovery of the drug\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n      2.     Preclusive Effect of a Conviction and Collateral Estoppel\r\n\r\n      Having concluded that Snowdon is not dispositive, the question becomes\r\nwhether a conviction in a separate criminal proceeding or the doctrine of collateral\r\nestoppel precludes a defendant from subsequently challenging a search that\r\nuncovered evidence relating to the two separate offenses?\r\n\r\n             a.     Implications of the Entry of a Valid Guilty Plea\r\n\r\n      It is well-established that a plea of guilty, knowingly and voluntarily entered,\r\ngenerally acts as a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects and defenses, including\r\nchallenges regarding constitutional issues. Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 514\r\nS.E.2d 320 (1999); State v. Munsch, 287 S.C. 313, 338 S.E.2d 329 (1985).\r\n\r\n       Based on this principle, most jurisdictions take the position that a person\r\nwho pleads guilty waives all non-jurisdictional objections to the proceeding,\r\n\"including objections to the manner in which evidence against him has been\r\ngathered.\" A. E. Korpela, Annotation, Plea of Guilty as Waiver of Claim of\r\nUnlawful Search and Seizure, 20 A.L.R.3d 724, § 2[a] (1968 & Supp. 2014)\r\n(collecting state and federal cases discussing whether a plea of guilty constitutes a\r\nwaiver of an unlawful search and seizure as a ground for attacking the conviction).\r\n\nThus, by pleading guilty, a defendant is precluded from attempting to vitiate the\r\nconviction by allegations that an unlawful search and seizure precipitated the\r\ncharged offense.\r\n\r\n       Stated another way, the waiver that results from the entry of a guilty plea is\r\nconfined to the offense that is the subject of the plea. See Menna v. New York, 423\r\nU.S. 61 (1975) (recognizing that a guilty plea conclusively establishes the factual\r\npredicate for the offense to which the defendant is pleading guilty); 22 C.J.S.\r\nCriminal Law § 517 (Supp. 2013) (\"[B]roadly stated, where the accused pleads\r\nguilty to a charged offense, he or she may not thereafter raise independent claims\r\nrelating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that antedate the plea.\"). Thus,\r\nby implication, a defendant who pleads guilty waives any assertion of an unlawful\r\nsearch that precipitated the offense to which he pled guilty. Accordingly, even if\r\nHewins pled guilty to the open container violation, his plea would have constituted\r\na waiver of any challenge he may have had to that offense but could not be\r\nextended to constitute a waiver of a challenge to the charge of possession of crack\r\ncocaine.\r\n\r\n      Because a guilty plea in municipal court would have had no preclusive effect\r\non Hewins's ability to litigate his motion to suppress in circuit court, we must next\r\ndetermine whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel was applicable.\r\n\r\n             b.     Doctrine of Collateral Estoppel\r\n\r\n       \"Collateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, prevents a party from\r\nrelitigating an issue that was decided in a previous action, regardless of whether\r\nthe claims in the first and subsequent lawsuits are the same.\" Carolina Renewal,\r\nInc. v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 385 S.C. 550, 554, 684 S.E.2d 779, 782 (Ct. App.\r\n2009). \"The party asserting collateral estoppel must demonstrate that the issue in\r\nthe present lawsuit was: (1) actually litigated in the prior action; (2) directly\r\ndetermined in the prior action; and (3) necessary to support the prior judgment.\"\r\nId. \" 'While the traditional use of collateral estoppel required mutuality of parties\r\nto bar relitigation, modern courts recognize the mutuality requirement is not\r\nnecessary for the application of collateral estoppel where the party against whom\r\nestoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to previously litigate the issue.' \"\r\nId. (quoting Snavely v. AMISUB of S.C., Inc., 379 S.C. 386, 398, 665 S.E.2d 222,\r\n228 (Ct. App. 2008))). \"The doctrine of collateral estoppel should not be rigidly or\r\nmechanically applied.\" Id. at 555, 684 S.E.2d at 782. \"Thus, even if all the\r\nelements for collateral estoppel are met, when unfairness or injustice results or\r\npublic policy requires it, courts may refuse to apply it.\" Id.\r\n\n      Without explanation, this civil doctrine was applied in the criminal context\r\nby our Supreme Court in 1942. See State v. Brown, 201 S.C. 417, 23 S.E.2d 381\r\n(1942) (holding defendant was estopped from relitigating the value of stolen goods\r\nin magistrate court where circuit court determined value and remanded to\r\nmagistrate court based on that determination). In Snowdon, the Court of Appeals\r\nmerely referenced Brown in a footnote to support the proposition that \"[c]ollateral\r\nestoppel can be used in a criminal proceeding.\" Snowdon, 371 S.C. at 334 n.2, 638\r\nS.E.2d at 93 n.2.\r\n\r\n       Given the limited precedent in this state regarding the application of\r\ncollateral estoppel in criminal proceedings, we have looked to other sources for\r\nguidance on this issue. Although the doctrine of collateral estoppel originally\r\ndeveloped in civil cases, it has been applied in criminal proceedings. Ashe v.\r\nSwenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970). In Ashe, the United States Supreme Court\r\nexplained, \"'[c]ollateral estoppel' is an awkward phrase, but stands for an extremely\r\nimportant principle in our adversary system of justice. It means simply that when\r\nan issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment,\r\nthat issue cannot be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\" Id. at\r\n443. In analyzing this doctrine, the Court recognized that collateral estoppel in the\r\ncriminal context is derived from the Fifth Amendment Double Jeopardy Clause,\r\nwhich forbids any person from being \"twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" Id. at\r\n442. (\"The question is no longer whether collateral estoppel is a requirement of due\r\nprocess, but whether it is a part of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against double\r\njeopardy.\").\r\n\r\n        Against this background, the Court held that a defendant in a criminal case\r\nmay assert collateral estoppel by relying on an acquittal in a first prosecution to bar\r\nlitigation of those facts in a subsequent prosecution for a different offense. Id. at\r\n443. The Court, however, noted that \"the rule of collateral estoppel in criminal\r\ncases is not to be applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th\r\ncentury pleading book, but with realism and rationality.\" Id. at 444.\r\n\r\n       The rule established in Ashe is normally invoked by a defendant to prevent\r\nthe State from relitigating an issue that has been determined in the defendant's\r\nfavor. See E. H. Schopler, Annotation, Modern Status of Doctrine of Res Judicata\r\nin Criminal Cases, 9 A.L.R.3d 203 (1966 & Supp. 2014) (collecting state and\r\nfederal cases concerning the question of whether and when a judgment on the\r\nmerits in a criminal prosecution may be asserted as res judicata or collateral\r\nestoppel in a subsequent criminal prosecution); 1 Wharton's Criminal Law § 74\r\n\n(15th ed. Supp. 2013) (\"Collateral estoppel, a branch of the broader principle of res\r\njudicata, is applicable in criminal prosecutions and bars relitigation between the\r\nsame parties of an issue determined at a prior trial.\").\r\n\r\n      \"Courts differentiate between offensive and defensive use of collateral\r\nestoppel.\" Kristin C. Dunavant, Comment, Criminal Procedure--State of\r\nTennessee v. Scarbrough: Precluding The Application of Offensive Collateral\r\nEstoppel in Criminal Cases, 37 U. Mem. L. Rev. 639, 639 (Spring 2007). \"While\r\noffensive collateral estoppel bars the criminal defendant from relitigating an issue\r\ndetermined in a previous action, defensive collateral estoppel prohibits the\r\nprosecution from relitigating an issue determined in a previous action.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       When the prosecution invokes collateral estoppel against the defendant, its\r\nuse is \"sometimes restricted by concerns such as fairness to the defendant.\" Anne\r\nBowen Poulin, Prosecution Use of Estoppel and Related Doctrines in Criminal\r\nCases: Promoting Consistency, Tolerating Inconsistency, 64 Rutgers L. Rev. 409,\r\n410 (Winter 2012). Specifically, \"the State's use of offensive collateral estoppel\r\nagainst a defendant has raised the issue of whether it violates the defendant's Sixth\r\nAmendment right to a jury trial.\" Dunavant, supra at 642. \"The constitutional\r\nargument is that if a court allows the State to invoke offensive collateral estoppel\r\nagainst a criminal defendant, effectively banning the defendant from litigating\r\nevery element of his offense in front of the jury in a subsequent action, the\r\nsubsequent jury would not be able to consider all of the facts.\" Id. \"Consequently,\r\nthe use of offensive collateral estoppel would prevent the jury from making every\r\nfinding necessary to the judgment in the subsequent suit and thus would violate the\r\ndefendant's constitutional right to a jury trial.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, it has been asserted that \"the application of offensive issue\r\npreclusion by the government violates the defendant's Fifth Amendment right to\r\ndue process.\" Michelle S. Simon, Offensive Issue Preclusion in the Criminal\r\nContext: Two Steps Forward, One Step Back, 34 U. Mem. L. Rev. 753, 779\r\n(Summer 2004). \"Under the Due Process Clause, a criminal defendant has the\r\nright to a determination by a jury of whether the prosecution has proved every\r\nelement of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. \"By finding that an\r\nelement of the crime has been conclusively proven, the argument is that the\r\nprosecution is relieved of its burden of proof.\" Id. \"Not only is the prosecution\r\nrelieved of its burden of proof, but the burden shifts to the defendant to overcome\r\nthe prejudice of the jury created by the knowledge of the previous determination.\"\r\nId.\r\n\n       Given the significant constitutional issues raised by the use of offensive\r\ncollateral estoppel, it is questionable that the policy reasons used to support issue\r\npreclusion in civil cases justify the use of the doctrine in the criminal context. Id.\r\nat 780. Specifically, \"[t]he notion of judicial efficiency and finality has been\r\ninvoked in civil trials to support the use of issue preclusion since the prompt\r\nresolution of claims and finality are desirable goals in civil litigation.\" Id.\r\nHowever, it would appear that \"the efficiencies of issue preclusion pale in\r\ncomparison to the importance of upholding a criminal defendant's right to\r\nvigorously defend himself and protect his liberty.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       In view of these constitutional and policy concerns, the majority of federal\r\ncourts have prohibited the prosecution from invoking collateral estoppel against a\r\ndefendant. See United States v. Pelullo, 14 F.3d 881, 890 (3d Cir. 1994) (denying\r\nthe use of offensive collateral estoppel in a criminal context because it would\r\nviolate a defendant's right to a jury trial; noting, \"Instances of invoking collateral\r\nestoppel against the defendant have been rare, though not unheard of\"); United\r\nStates v. Smith-Baltiher, 424 F.3d 913 (9th Cir. 2005) (rejecting the use of\r\noffensive collateral estoppel in criminal context); United States v. Gallardo-\r\nMendez, 150 F.3d 1240 (10th Cir. 1998) (prohibiting prosecution's use of a guilty\r\nplea to collaterally estop a defendant from relitigating an issue in a subsequent\r\ncriminal proceeding because it would be contrary to the Due Process Clause);\r\nUnited States v. Harnage, 976 F.2d 633 (11th Cir. 1992) (precluding the use of\r\noffensive collateral estoppel because it would defeat the goal of judicial\r\nefficiency).\r\n\r\n       The majority of state courts that have considered this issue have also\r\nprecluded the prosecution from invoking collateral estoppel against a defendant.\r\nSee Gutierrez v. People, 29 Cal. Rptr. 2d 376 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994) (holding that\r\ndefendant's right to a fair trial prevented the State from asserting collateral estoppel\r\nto bar defendant from litigating issues of identity and intent based on resolution of\r\nthose issues in prior trial resulting in final judgment of conviction for attempted\r\nmurder of the same victim); State v.

Johnson,\r\n594 A.2d 1288 (N.H. 1991) (concluding that doctrine of collateral estoppel could\r\nnot be applied offensively in perjury prosecution so as to preclude litigation of\r\nprimary substantive issue involving a specific finding of fact made by a jury in a\r\nprior criminal trial against the defendant); State v.

Scarbrough, 181 S.W.3d 650\r\n(Tenn. 2005) (holding the prosecution could not invoke the doctrine of offensive\r\ncollateral estoppel to establish an essential element of a charge in a criminal case).\r\n\r\n               c. Application of Collateral Estoppel to a Motion to Suppress\r\n\r\n       As can be seen by the above citations, most courts have considered whether\r\nthe prosecution's use of offensive collateral estoppel violates a defendant's right to\r\na jury trial. Thus, although these cases are instructive, they are not dispositive of\r\nthe narrow question presented in the instant case, which is whether a prior\r\nconviction may be used against a defendant in a pre-trial motion to suppress?\r\n\r\n       Without question, the proceedings are different as the use of collateral\r\nestoppel in this posture affects a judge's pre-trial ruling and does not necessarily\r\neliminate a jury's consideration of substantive elements of the indicted offense.\r\nAccordingly, some courts have declined to adopt a blanket prohibition of the\r\noffensive use of collateral estoppel in this context, provided that the requirements\r\nof collateral estoppel are met. 6 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A\r\nTreatise on the Fourth Amendment § 11.2(g) (5th ed. Supp. 2013); Poulin, supra at\r\n432-40.Although these authorities identify five requirements for the application of\r\nthe doctrine of collateral estoppel, we find the requirements are consistent with the\r\nthree factors applied by our appellate courts in civil cases. See Commonwealth v.\r\nCabrera, 874 N.E.2d 654, 658 (Mass. 2007) (\"Five requirements must be met for\r\ncollateral estoppel to apply in the context of a suppression motion: (1) the issues in\r\nthe two proceedings must be identical; (2) the party estopped must have had\r\nsufficient incentive to litigate the issue fully and vigorously; (3) the party estopped\r\nmust have been a party to the previous litigation; (4) the applicable law must be\r\nidentical in both proceedings; and (5) the first proceeding must have resulted in a\r\n\nfinal judgment on the merits such that the defendant had sufficient incentive and an\r\nopportunity to appeal.\" (footnote omitted) (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       After considering the constitutional and policy issues raised by the use of\r\ncollateral estoppel in the criminal context, we decline to adopt a blanket\r\nprohibition of the State's use of offensive collateral estoppel. Significantly, at oral\r\nargument, counsel for Hewins stated that this was not the requested relief and in\r\nfact noted instances for which the doctrine's application would be permissible. We\r\nemphasize, however, that these instances would be extremely rare.\r\n\r\n               d. Application of Offensive Collateral Estoppel to the Instant\r\n                  Case\r\n\r\n      Applying this doctrine to the facts of the instant case, we find Hewins should\r\nnot have been precluded from litigating his motion to suppress in circuit court\r\nbecause the State failed to establish the requisite factors.\r\n\r\n      Initially, we note there is no evidence in the record that the issue regarding\r\nthe constitutionality of the search was actually litigated or directly determined in\r\nmunicipal court. Moreover, even though one search revealed evidence for the\r\nopen container violation and the drug offense, the suppression issue in the drug\r\ncase was not necessary to support a conviction in the open container case. Finally,\r\ngiven the minimal penalty for an open container violation, Hewins had little\r\nincentive to pursue a suppression motion as he was sentenced to time served and\r\nordered to pay a fine.\r\n\r\n       Because the State failed to demonstrate each element of the doctrine of\r\ncollateral estoppel, we find Hewins should not have been precluded from litigating\r\nthe suppression issue in circuit court. See United States v. Gregg, 463 F.3d 160\r\n(2d Cir. 2006) (holding defendant's guilty plea to state charge of criminal\r\nimpersonation did not waive any Fourth Amendment challenges to the subsequent\r\nfederal felon-in-possession charge stemming from the same stop and arrest);\r\nUnited States v. Arreola-Beltran, 827 F. Supp. 2d 1188 (D. Idaho 2011) (applying\r\nfive-factor test and finding state court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress\r\ndid not collaterally estop federal district court from considering motion to suppress\r\nthe same evidence); see also People v. Griffin, 453 N.E.2d 55 (Ill. App. Ct. 1983)\r\n(concluding trial court erred in refusing to grant defendant a hearing on his motion\r\nto suppress on the ground that his plea of guilty in prior prosecution precluded\r\nappeal from denial of motion in that prosecution, but finding error was harmless in\r\n\nlight of overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt). Accordingly, we reverse the\r\ndecision of the circuit court judge.5\r\n\r\n      3.     Merits of the Motion to Suppress\r\n\r\n       Given our standard of review, the normal procedural course would be to\r\nremand this case to the circuit court to conduct a hearing on Hewins's motion to\r\nsuppress. See State v. Tindall, 388 S.C. 518, 521, 698 S.E.2d 203, 205 (2010)\r\n(\"On appeals from a motion to suppress based on Fourth Amendment grounds, this\r\nCourt applies a deferential standard of review and will reverse if there is clear\r\nerror. However, this deference does not bar this Court from conducting its own\r\nreview of the record to determine whether the trial judge's decision is supported by\r\nthe evidence.\" (citation omitted)). In the interest of judicial economy, we have\r\ndecided to address the merits of this issue as the parties did in their briefs and at\r\noral argument.6\r\n\r\n5  Additionally, we disagree with State's contention that the law of the case doctrine\r\nprecluded Hewins from challenging the admission of the drug evidence in the\r\ncircuit court proceeding. We find the State's reliance on this doctrine is misplaced\r\nas it is a discretionary appellate doctrine with no preclusive effect on successive\r\ntrial proceedings. See Hudson ex rel. Hudson v. Lancaster Convalescent Ctr., 407\r\nS.C. 112, 119, 754 S.E.2d 486, 490 (2014) (\"Under the law of the case doctrine, a\r\nparty is precluded from re-litigating issues decided in a lower court order, when the\r\nparty voluntarily abandons its appeal of that order.\").\r\n6  The sole basis for the dissent's position is its disagreement with our decision \"to\r\naddress the suppression motion on the merits, as it was not ruled on below.\"\r\nInterestingly, the dissent has not consistently expressed this aversion to addressing\r\nissues that have not been ruled on. In fact, the dissent has authored at least two\r\ndecisions and agreed with the Court on several occasions to analyze the merits of\r\nan issue despite preservation problems. See State v. Daniels, 401 S.C. 251, 256,\r\n737 S.E.2d 473, 475 (2012) (\"Although the issue is not preserved, we instruct the\r\ntrial judge to remove any suggestion from his general sessions charge that a\r\ncriminal jury's duty is to return a verdict that is 'just' or 'fair' to all parties.\");\r\nWachovia Bank of S.C. v.

Kromah, 401 S.C. 340, 349, 737 S.E.2d 490, 495 (2013)\r\n(finding issue preserved and addressing the merits of the issue \"in the interest of\r\njudicial economy\") (Pleicones, J., concurring).\r\n\n        In the instant case, Hewins does not challenge the legality of the initial\r\ntraffic stop. Rather, he asserts Officer Cothran exceeded the scope of the stop. We\r\nagree as the evidence does not support a finding that Officer Cothran had\r\nreasonable suspicion of criminal activity to extend the duration of the traffic stop\r\nand conduct the search.\r\n\r\n      Officer Cothran stopped Hewins for making an improper turn. He then\r\nobtained Hewins's driver's license but not his vehicle registration or proof of\r\ninsurance. During this initial contact, Officer Cothran informed Hewins that he\r\nwould issue a warning citation. Officer Cothran returned to his patrol car to run a\r\ncheck on Hewins's license. After confirming that the vehicle was registered to\r\nHewins, Officer Cothran completed a warning citation.\r\n\r\n       At this point, the purpose of the traffic stop was fulfilled except for\r\npresenting the warning citation to Hewins. Officer Cothran, however, proceeded\r\nto order Hewins out of the vehicle and conduct a pat-down search. Following the\r\npat down, Officer Cothran continued to question Hewins as to whether he had any\r\nguns, drugs, or explosives. When Hewins denied the presence of any drugs and\r\nrefused to consent to a search, Officer Cothran asked Officer Loftis to walk his\r\ndrug-detection dog around the vehicle. After the dog \"alerted\" to the driver's side\r\nof the vehicle, Officer Cothran proceeded to search the vehicle.\r\n\r\n      We find Officer Cothran's continued detention of Hewins exceeded the\r\nscope of the traffic stop and constituted an additional seizure for purposes of the\r\nFourth Amendment. However, our analysis does not end as the question becomes\r\nwhether Officer Cothran reasonably suspected a serious crime at the point he\r\ncompleted the warning citation.\r\n\r\n       According to Officer Cothran, he decided to conduct the pat down, continue\r\nquestioning, and deploy the drug-detection dog based on the following\r\ninformation: (1) earlier in the evening he had seen Hewins drive in a known drug\r\narea; (2) Hewins remained nervous despite being given a warning citation rather\r\nthan a traffic ticket; and (3) when questioned, Hewins quickly responded that he\r\ndid not have any drugs. We conclude that these facts did not provide Officer\r\nCothran with a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. An\r\nobservation that Hewins was nervous, drove through a known drug area, and\r\nHewins's immediate denial of possessing drugs, cannot justify Officer Cothran's\r\ndecision to detain Hewins. We find the aggregate of these circumstances was not\r\nsufficient to create an objective basis for extending the scope of the traffic stop.\r\n\n       Therefore, we hold the continued detention of Hewins, which included the\r\ndeployment of the drug-detection dog, was illegal and the drugs discovered during\r\nthe search of the vehicle should have been suppressed. Cf. Tindall, 388 S.C. at\r\n523, 698 S.E.2d at 206 (concluding officer's continued detention of defendant\r\nexceeded the scope of the traffic stop and constituted a seizure for purposes of the\r\nFourth Amendment where officer ascertained that defendant: (1) was stopped\r\nwhile driving to a \"drug hub\" city to meet his brother, (2) was driving a rental car\r\nrented the previous day by another individual which was to be returned to Atlanta\r\non the day of the stop; (3) did a \"felony stretch\" on exiting the vehicle; and (4)\r\nseemed nervous). See generally Thomas Fusco, Annotation, Permissibility Under\r\nFourth Amendment of Detention of Motorist by Police, Following Lawful Stop for\r\nTraffic Offense, to Investigate Matters Not Related to Offense, 118 A.L.R. Fed.\r\n567, §§ 3-5 (1994 & Supp. 2014) (collecting state and federal cases analyzing\r\nwhether law enforcement had reasonable suspicion of the criminal activity to\r\njustify continued detention following the conclusion of the initial traffic stop).7\r\n\r\n                                 IV.   Conclusion\r\n\r\n       We hold the circuit court judge erred in finding Snowdon dispositive as it is\r\nfactually distinguishable. Moreover, we expand on the ruling in Snowdon as there\r\nwas no consideration given to the significant constitutional and policy issues raised\r\nby the State's use of offensive collateral estoppel. As discussed, most jurisdictions\r\nhave rejected the State's use of this doctrine because it potentially violates a\r\ndefendant's right to have a jury determine each element of a charged offense.\r\nHowever, we decline to adopt a blanket prohibition of the State's use of offensive\r\ncollateral estoppel in criminal proceedings given we can conceive of limited\r\ncircumstances where the doctrine of collateral estoppel would be appropriate. Yet,\r\nwe caution against its use and emphasize the rarity of its application. Applying\r\nthis doctrine to the facts of the instant case, we hold that Hewins should not have\r\nbeen precluded from litigating his motion to suppress in circuit court.\r\n\r\n      Regarding the merits of Hewins's motion to suppress, we find that it should\r\nhave been granted. Because the evidence does not support a finding that Officer\r\n\r\n7 The State maintains the search was valid and cites Provet and State v. Wallace,\r\n392 S.C. 47, 707 S.E.2d 451 (Ct. App. 2011), cert. dismissed as improvidently\r\ngranted, 401 S.C. 264, 737 S.E.2d 480 (2012) for this position. We, however, find\r\nProvet and Wallace distinguishable as there was considerably more evidence\r\npresent in those cases to support a finding that the officer had reasonable suspicion\r\nof a serious crime to justify the continued detention.\r\n\nCothran had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, the continued detention of\r\nHewins after the completion of the warning citation constituted an illegal\r\ndetention. Consequently, the drug evidence should have been suppressed.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse Hewins's conviction for possession of crack cocaine.\r\n\r\n      REVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., HEARN, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate\r\nopinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES : I concur in part and dissent in part. I agree with the\r\nmajority that the circuit court erred in ruling that Hewins was collaterally estopped\r\nfrom arguing his motion to suppress. However, I respectfully dissent from the\r\nmajority's holding that the motion to suppress should have been granted, as I would\r\nnot have reached the merits of the suppression motion because it was not ruled on\r\nby the lower court.\r\n\r\nFirst, I agree with the majority that collateral estoppel does not apply. However,\r\nwhile the majority distinguishes Snowdon, 8 I would go farther and hold that even\r\nhad the facts of this case been similar to that of Snowdon, Hewins would not be\r\ncollaterally estopped, since none of the requirements for the application for\r\ncollateral estoppel have been met. Moreover, I share the majority's concern that\r\nthere may never be an appropriate scenario where the State should be permitted to\r\nuse offensive collateral estoppel against a criminal defendant. Cf. Ashe v. Swenson,\r\n397 U.S. 436 (1970) (allowing defendant to assert collateral estoppel to bar\r\nlitigation of facts that were determined by an acquittal in a previous prosecution).\r\n\r\nSecond, I disagree with the majority's decision to address the suppression motion\r\non the merits, as it was not ruled on below. In the interest of judicial economy, the\r\nmajority addresses the merits of the suppression motion, \"as the parties did in their\r\nbriefs and at oral arguments.\"9 In my opinion, the concern for judicial economy\r\ncannot justify ignoring our precedent requiring an issue be preserved before an\r\nappellate court will address the merits of the issue. See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C.\r\n138, 587 S.E.2d 691 (2003)) (\"In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.\"). Issues not\r\nraised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal. Id.\r\n\r\nWhile the merits of the suppression motion were argued by Hewins's counsel, no\r\nevidence was presented. The State did not touch on the merits contending only that\r\nHewins was collaterally estopped from arguing the suppression motion. As the\r\nmajority notes, the circuit court did not and could not address the merits of\r\nHewins's motion, but held that Hewins was collaterally estopped from challenging\r\n\r\n  State v. Snowdon, 371 S.C. 331, 638 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 2006), cert. dismissed as\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nimprovidently granted, 381 S.C. 171, 672 S.E.2d 108 (2009).\r\n9 I note that the Hewins does not argue the merits of this motion in his brief, but\r\ninstead responded to the State's argument in his reply brief. It is well settled\r\nappellants may not make new arguments for reversal in their reply brief.\r\nAdditionally, Hewins does not request this Court rule on the merits, but merely\r\nrequests we remand this case for a ruling on Appellant's motion to suppress.\r\n\nthe search. As a result, we are presented with a record that is insufficient to\r\ndetermine the merits of this suppression motion. I find it inappropriate for this\r\nCourt to rule on the merits of a motion when the merits were neither litigated nor\r\nruled on by the lower court. Therefore, I would remand to the circuit court to\r\nconsider Hewins's suppression motion.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27416","title":"State v.

State v. Wills, 390 S.C.\r\n139, 700 S.E.2d 266 (Ct. App. 2010). We affirm.\r\n\r\nThe first question raised by this case is whether a criminal defendant may waive\r\nthe protections afforded by Rule 410, SCRE.1 If we decide that he may, the next\r\nissue is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that petitioner did so\r\nhere. 2 We answer both questions \"yes.\"\r\n\r\nRule 410, SCRE, titled \"INADMISSIBILITY OF PLEAS, PLEA\r\nDISCUSSIONS, AND RELATED STATEMENTS,\" provides:\r\n\r\n             Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of the\r\n             following is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible\r\n             against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in\r\n             the plea discussions:\r\n\r\n             (1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn;\r\n\r\n             (2) a plea of nolo contendere;\r\n\r\n             (3) any statement made in the course of any court proceedings\r\n             regarding either of the foregoing pleas; or\r\n\r\n             (4) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with\r\n             an attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in\r\n             a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later\r\n             withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Although it is questionable whether the Rule 410 issue was preserved for \n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nappellate review, it formed the basis for the Court of Appeals' decision upon which \n\r\nwe granted certiorari, and we therefore address the merits. \n\r\n  The Court of Appeals' opinion contains a full explanation of the facts of this case, \n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nincluding the terms of the Proffer Agreement. \n\r\n\n             However, such a statement is admissible (i) in any proceeding\r\n             wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea\r\n             or plea discussions has been introduced and the statement ought\r\n             in fairness be considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a\r\n             criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement if the\r\n             statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record\r\n             and in the presence of counsel.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that a criminal defendant may waive the\r\nprotections afforded by Rule 410. Here, petitioner and his attorney executed an\r\nagreement wherein petitioner agreed that if a subsequent polygraph examination\r\ndemonstrated deception, inconsistencies, or that petitioner shot the victim, then\r\n\"the terms of this proffer are null and void and any statements made by [petitioner]\r\nmay be used against him by the State for any legal purpose, including . . .\r\ndisposition of charges through plea or trial . . . and impeachment.\" Proffer\r\nAgreement section 2 (emphasis supplied). Further, section 7 provides in relevant\r\npart not only that petitioner's violation of the Agreement would render the Proffer's\r\nterms null and void, but also that \"the State shall have the right to use any\r\ninformation obtained through this Proffer in any fashion, whether direct [or]\r\ncollateral . . . .\" Applying the rules of contract construction here, \"regardless of the\r\nagreement's wisdom or lack thereof,\" we agree with the Court of Appeals that, on\r\nthis record, petitioner's Proffer Agreement, entered with the advice and consent of\r\ncounsel, waived the protections of Rule 410, SCRE.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., concur. BEATTY, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion in which HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\n       JUSTICE BEATTY: I dissent as I believe the majority reaches an\r\nincorrect result because it fails to appreciate and analyze the significant issues\r\npresented by this case. For reasons that will be discussed, I would find the trial\r\njudge erred in allowing the State to use Petitioner's statement during its case-in-\r\nchief as it violates principles of contract law and Rule 410 of the South Carolina\r\nRules of Evidence.3 More importantly, a decision authorizing the State to present a\r\nfalse statement to the jury in order to procure a conviction should not stand as it\r\nunquestionably compromises the integrity of our system of justice. Accordingly, I\r\nwould reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the matter for a\r\nnew trial.              I.    Factual/Procedural History\r\n\r\n       On October 13, 2001, officers with the Horry County Police Department\r\nwere called to investigate a remote location off of Highway 90 in Horry County.\r\nUpon arrival, they discovered the body of a young male who had been shot two\r\ntimes in the back. Law enforcement, using fingerprint evidence, later identified the\r\nvictim as Julian Lee. As a result of the investigation, Petitioner was charged with\r\naccessory after the fact and obstruction of justice.\r\n\r\n       In August 2005, Detective Allen Large of the Horry County Police\r\nDepartment was contacted by the Fifteenth Circuit Solicitor's Office to interview\r\nPetitioner, who was incarcerated at J. Reuben Long Detention Center. In response\r\nto a plea offer from the State, Petitioner and his attorney, Bill Diggs, met with\r\nDetective Large, Detective Neil Livingston, and Assistant Solicitor Scott Hixson to\r\ndiscuss a proffer agreement.4 In essence, the proffer agreement provided that in\r\n3 Rule 410, SCRE (providing that pleas, plea discussions, and related statements\r\nare inadmissible against a defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the\r\nplea discussions, except in limited circumstances).\r\n4 \"A 'proffer agreement' is generally understood to be an agreement between a\r\ndefendant and the government in a criminal case that sets forth the terms under\r\nwhich the defendant will provide information to the government during an\r\ninterview, commonly referred to as a 'proffer session.' \" United States v. Lopez, 219\r\nF.3d 343, 345 n.1 (4th Cir. 2000). \"The proffer agreement defines the obligations\r\nof the parties and is intended to protect the defendant against the use of his or her\r\nstatements, particularly in those situations in which the defendant has revealed\r\n\nexchange for Petitioner's truthful account of the events surrounding the victim's\r\nmurder the State would take into consideration his cooperation in offering a\r\nsentence recommendation.\r\n\r\n      The proffer agreement provided in relevant part:\r\n\r\n      1.     Theodore David Wills Jr. shall submit himself to agent(s) of the\r\n      State for the purpose of debriefing regarding this matter and all other\r\n      matters materially bearing on this matter. He shall be completely\r\n      truthful concerning his involvement in this matter, and completely\r\n      truthful concerning the involvement of all other individuals in this\r\n      matter. He shall truthfully and completely answer all questions posed\r\n      by agent(s) of the State bearing materially on this matter and shall\r\n      provide without prompting all information concerning this matter in a\r\n      complete and truthful manner even if such information is not elicited\r\n      by agent(s) of the State by direct question. Any and all information\r\n      provided by Theodore David Wills Jr. under the terms of this proffer\r\n      may be recorded in any fashion at the election of the State;\r\n\r\n      2.     Theodore David Wills Jr. shall submit himself to a polygraph\r\n      examination(s) to verify all information provided to the State at the\r\n      election of the State. The polygraph examiner(s) shall be selected by\r\n      the State and, for the purpose of this Proffer, are designated agent(s)\r\n      of the State; upon examination(s) by polygraph, if the responses given\r\n      by Theodore David Wills Jr. show deception, are inconsistent with\r\n      information previously provided or indicates he is the person or one of\r\n      the persons that shot the victim, the terms of this proffer are null and\r\n      void and any statements made by Theodore David Wills Jr. may be\r\n      used against him by the State for any legal purpose, including, but not\r\n      limited to, considerations for charging, bond, disposition of charges\r\n      through plea or trial of Theodore David Wills Jr. and impeachment;\r\n\r\n             ....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincriminating information and the proffer session does not mature into a plea\r\nagreement or other form of cooperation agreement.\" Id.\r\n\n        4.    In return for Theodore David Wills Jr.'s full compliance with all\r\n        terms stated within this Proffer, statements provided during his\r\n        debriefing will not be used in a criminal prosecution currently pending\r\n        against him by this Office. The State will not seek any additional\r\n        charges against Theodore David Wills Jr. in connection with the\r\n        subject of this Proffer;\r\n\r\n              ....\r\n\r\n        7.     Violation of any term of this Proffer renders all terms null and\r\n        void; the State shall have the right to use any information obtained\r\n        through this Proffer in any fashion, whether direct [or] collateral to\r\n        this matter.\r\n\r\n       Petitioner and his attorney signed the proffer agreement. Subsequently,\r\nPetitioner signed a written waiver of his Miranda5 rights. Petitioner then provided\r\na statement that was recorded in the presence of his attorney, the detectives, and\r\nthe assistant solicitor. In his statement, Petitioner claimed he drove his brother\r\nDonnell Green, Mark Willard, and the victim to the remote location during the\r\nearly morning hours of October 13, 2001. According to Petitioner, he and the\r\nvictim believed they were going to rob some drug dealers and \"score some quick\r\ncash.\" Petitioner stated he saw Willard shoot the victim and that he heard a second\r\nshot as he ran away.\r\n\r\n       On September 19, 2005, Petitioner submitted to a polygraph examination,\r\nwhich was administered by SLED Agent Ricky Charles's intern. Based on his\r\nreview of the polygraph results, Agent Charles concluded that Petitioner was\r\ndeceptive in his statement. Agent Charles did not specify how Wills was deceptive\r\nor whether the deception was material to the agreement. As a result, the State\r\nclaimed the proffer agreement was null and void and proceeded to charge\r\nPetitioner with murder.\r\n\r\n       At the beginning of the trial, the State indicated it intended to use Petitioner's\r\nstatement as part of its case-in-chief. Counsel for Petitioner objected to the\r\nadmission of the statement as it was given \"in exchange for participation by the\r\nState in a plea agreement process.\" Counsel challenged the proffer agreement as\r\n\"inherently flawed\" because an \"unreliable\" polygraph examination was used to\r\n\r\n5   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\ndetermine Petitioner's truthfulness. Based on these circumstances, counsel asserted\r\nthe statement was involuntary and should be suppressed.\r\n\r\n       In response to defense counsel's objection, the judge held a hearing pursuant\r\nto Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964). After hearing arguments and reviewing\r\nthe recorded statement, the trial judge found the statement was given voluntarily as\r\nPetitioner was apprised of his Miranda rights and signed the proffer agreement.\r\nThe judge, however, cautioned the parties not to make any reference to the use of a\r\npolygraph examination. The judge also permitted defense counsel to explain to the\r\njury that Petitioner made the statement in response to the proffer agreement.\r\n\r\n       During its case-in-chief, the State played the recorded statement to the jury.\r\nAt the conclusion of the State's case, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict\r\nand renewed his objection to the admissibility of the statement. The judge denied\r\nthe motion and reaffirmed his previous rulings. Petitioner, who did not testify or\r\npresent any evidence, was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to forty\r\nyears' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, Petitioner argued the trial judge erred in allowing the jury to hear\r\nthe statement as it arose out of a proffer agreement and, thus, was inadmissible\r\nunder Rule 410 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence. Because the inculpatory\r\nadmissions were the \"centerpiece\" of the State's case, Petitioner asserted his\r\nconviction should be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.\r\n\r\n       The Court of Appeals affirmed Petitioner's conviction and sentence. State v.\r\nWills, 390 S.C. 139, 700 S.E.2d 266 (Ct. App. 2010). In so ruling, the court stated\r\nthat \"[o]ur case law unequivocally establishes agreements between defendants and\r\nthe State should be interpreted 'in accordance with general contract principles.' \" Id.\r\nat 143, 700 S.E.2d at 268 (quoting State v. Compton, 366 S.C. 671, 677, 623\r\nS.E.2d 661, 664 (Ct. App. 2005)). The court noted, however, that the \"question of\r\nwhether an agreement can waive the application of [Rule 410] [had been]\r\nunanswered.\" Id. at 144, 700 S.E.2d at 268. In answering this question, the court\r\nrelied on the United States Supreme Court's (\"USSC\") decision in United States v.\r\nMezzanatto, 513 U.S. 196 (1995), wherein the USSC held that \"absent some\r\naffirmative indication that the agreement was entered into unknowingly or\r\ninvoluntarily, an agreement to waive the exclusionary provisions of the plea\r\nstatement Rules is valid and enforceable.\" Id. at 145, 700 S.E.2d at 269 (quoting\r\nMezzanatto, 513 U.S. at 210). Applying Mezzanatto, the court concluded that the\r\n\nproffer agreement: (1) triggered the exclusionary provisions of Rule 410 as it\r\nconstituted a plea negotiation; and (2) unambiguously provided that Petitioner's\r\nstatement could be used against him by the State for any legal purpose if the State\r\ndetermined Petitioner was deceitful. Id. at 145, 700 S.E.2d at 269. Finally, the\r\ncourt found the judge properly admitted the statement as Petitioner knowingly and\r\nvoluntarily entered into the agreement. Id. at 146, 700 S.E.2d at 269.\r\n\r\n      This Court granted Petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeals. II.    Discussion\r\n\r\nA.     Arguments\r\n       In challenging the decision of the Court of Appeals, Petitioner asserts the\r\nfacts of the instant case are distinguishable from Compton and Mezzanatto since\r\nthose cases did not involve a \"polygraph examiner as the decision maker on\r\nwhether [Petitioner] was telling the truth.\" Because polygraph examinations are\r\n\"inherently unreliable,\" Petitioner contends an arbitrary factor was injected into the\r\nagreement. In view of the polygraph provision and the vague terms of the\r\nagreement, Petitioner claims it \"literally invites solicitors to find ways not to honor\r\na plea agreement.\"\r\n\r\n       If the decision of the Court of Appeals is upheld, Petitioner argues the\r\npurpose and policy of Rule 410 will be undermined. Specifically, Petitioner avers\r\nthat Mezzanatto only permitted statements made during plea negotiations to be\r\nused for impeachment purposes and \"did not necessarily provide a basis for the\r\nprosecution to use those statements in its case-in-chief.\" Additionally, Petitioner\r\ncontends he did not knowingly enter into the proffer agreement as the provision\r\nthat his statement could be used for \"any legal purpose\" was vague.\r\n\r\nB.     Error Preservation\r\n\r\n       As a threshold matter, the State claims any issue regarding Rule 410 is not\r\npreserved for this Court's review as defense counsel failed to cite this rule during\r\nhis arguments to the trial judge. The State also asserts that the argument before\r\nthis Court is a \"different permutation\" than the issues raised to the Court of\r\nAppeals. The State claims appellate counsel raises a new argument that the\r\n\nagreement should be declared null and void because the determination of\r\nPetitioner's deception was based on an unreliable polygraph examination.\r\n\r\n        In my view, the issue regarding Rule 410 was properly preserved for this\r\nCourt's review. Although defense counsel did not cite Rule 410 in his trial\r\narguments, he was aware of its provisions as he emphasized that Petitioner's\r\nstatement was given during the course of plea negotiations and was inadmissible\r\nexcept for the limited purpose of impeachment. Moreover, the judge clearly\r\nunderstood counsel's argument as he framed the issue as follows: \"[T]he real\r\npurpose of this motion hearing is to determine whether or not the statement of\r\n[Petitioner] which he gave pursuant to this proffer can be used in the course of this\r\ntrial.\" Based on the trial arguments, appellate counsel then specifically challenged\r\nthe trial judge's ruling as erroneous under Rule 410.\r\n\r\n       Because the substance of Rule 410 was raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\njudge and the Court of Appeals, I address the merits of this issue as it was properly\r\npreserved for this Court's review. See State v. Oglesby, 384 S.C. 289, 293, 681\r\nS.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 2009) (finding issue regarding Rule 106, SCRE was\r\npreserved for appellate review even though defendant failed to specifically cite the\r\nrule); see also State v. Jennings, 394 S.C. 473, 481, 716 S.E.2d 91, 95 (2011)\r\n(recognizing that for an issue to be properly preserved it has to be raised to and\r\nruled on by the trial court).\r\n\r\nC.     Analysis\r\n       Having found the issue properly preserved, I believe the Court must answer\r\nthe ultimate question of whether a defendant may execute a total waiver of the\r\nexclusionary provisions of Rule 410. In answering this question, the analysis\r\ninvolves a series of sequential questions. Initially, it is necessary to determine\r\nwhether a defendant may waive the exclusionary provisions of Rule 410 via a\r\nMiranda waiver. If a Miranda waiver is not sufficient, then the focus turns to the\r\nterms of the proffer agreement. Using principles of contract law as a guide, it is\r\nnecessary to consider the effect of a breach of the proffer agreement and decide the\r\nresultant remedy, i.e., the extent to which the State may utilize statements made by\r\na defendant pursuant to a proffer agreement.\r\n\r\n    The analysis of each of these questions is premised on this Court's\r\ncommitment to protect and preserve the integrity of the judicial process. It stands\r\n\nto reason that the integrity of the judicial process is challenged when the State is\r\nallowed to introduce a statement that the State has declared false and deceitful yet,\r\nat the same time, insists that the judge and jury accept the statement as truthful.\r\nThis Court must determine to what extent such a statement may be used without\r\nassaulting the integrity of the judicial process.\r\n\r\n       Cognizant of this Court's duty to ensure the legitimacy of this process, I now\r\nassess whether the proceedings in the instant case undermined the purpose for and\r\nthe protections afforded by Rule 410 and, in turn, Petitioner's right to a fair trial.\r\n\r\n                                          (1)\r\n       Statements given during plea negotiations are generally inadmissible as they\r\nare protected by Rule 410, which provides:\r\n\r\n      Except as otherwise provided in this rule, evidence of the following is\r\n      not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the\r\n      defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea\r\n      discussions:\r\n\r\n      (1) a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn;\r\n\r\n      (2) a plea of nolo contendere;\r\n\r\n      (3) any statement made in the course of any court proceedings \n\r\n      regarding either of the foregoing pleas; or \n\r\n\r\n      (4) any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an\r\n      attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in a\r\n      plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.\r\n\r\n      However, such a statement is admissible (i) in any proceeding\r\n      wherein another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea\r\n      discussions has been introduced and the statement ought in fairness be\r\n      considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a criminal proceeding\r\n      for perjury or false statement if the statement was made by the\r\n      defendant under oath, on the record and in the presence of counsel.\r\n\nRule 410, SCRE (emphasis added).6\r\n\r\n       In reviewing the legislative history of Rule 410, it is clear Congress\r\nrecognized that statements made during the course of plea negotiations are\r\ndecidedly different than other voluntary statements and, thus, sought to limit their\r\nadmissibility. See Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 410, FRE (\"As with\r\ncompromise offers generally . . . free communication is needed, and security\r\nagainst having an offer of compromise or related statement admitted in evidence\r\neffectively encourages it.\"); Paul F. Rothstein, Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 410\r\n(3d ed. 2012) (discussing legislative history of Rule 410 and stating, \"The rule has\r\na number of purposes, the most significant of which is to encourage the early\r\ndisposition of criminal cases without the cost, expense, and uncertainty of trial. It\r\nprotects the accused from being placed in the untenable position of having a right\r\nto withdraw a guilty plea but being forced to take the stand in order to explain that\r\ndecision at trial.\" (footnote omitted)). Were there not this distinction, it would\r\nhave been unnecessary for Congress to promulgate a rule to protect statements\r\nmade during plea negotiations.\r\n\r\n       In examining this distinction, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals explained\r\nthat \"[p]lea negotiations are inadmissible, but surely not every discussion between\r\nan accused and agents for the government is a plea negotiation.\" United States v.\r\nRobertson, 582 F.2d 1356, 1365 (5th Cir. 1978). \"Suppressing evidence of such\r\nnegotiations serves the policy of insuring a free dialogue only when the accused\r\nand the government actually engage in plea negotiations: 'discussions in advance\r\nof the time for pleading with a view to an agreement whereby the defendant will\r\nenter a plea in the hope of receiving certain charge or sentence concessions.' \" Id.\r\n(quoting ABA Standards, Introduction at 3). The court noted that \"plea\r\nnegotiations contemplate a bargaining process, a 'mutuality of advantage,' and a\r\nmutuality of disadvantage. That is, the government and the accused both seek a\r\nconcession for a concession, a Quid pro quo. The accused contemplates entering a\r\nplea to obtain a concession from the government. The government contemplates\r\nmaking some concession to obtain the accused's plea.\" Id. at 1365-66 (citations\r\nomitted). Thus, in assessing the admissibility of a defendant's statement, it is\r\n\r\n6  Rule 410 is the substantive equivalent of the federal rule. See Notes to Rule\r\n410, SCRE (\"Except for subsection (3), this rule is identical to the federal rule.\r\nSubsection (3) was amended because South Carolina has no equivalent to Rule 11\r\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\").\r\n\nnecessary to \"distinguish between those discussions in which the accused was\r\nmerely making an admission and those discussions in which the accused was\r\nseeking to negotiate a plea agreement.\" Id. at 1367.\r\n\r\n       The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals cited the reasoning in Robertson\r\nto specifically differentiate between statements that are made during plea\r\nnegotiations and those that are made following a Miranda waiver. State v. Hinton,\r\n42 S.W.3d 113, 122 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001). In Hinton, the defendant was\r\nconvicted of first-degree felony murder, attempted first-degree murder, and\r\nespecially aggravated robbery. Id. at 116. On appeal, the defendant raised several\r\nissues, including that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress an\r\ninculpatory statement that he made during plea negotiations. Id. at 119-26.\r\n\r\n       Initially, the court found the statement was made during the course of plea\r\ndiscussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority and, thus, Rule 410\r\nprotections were implicated. Id. at 119-23. Because the defendant gave the\r\nstatement after being advised of his Miranda rights, the court considered whether\r\nthe statement, which fell within the purview of the rules, was nevertheless\r\nadmissible. Id. at 123. The court found the statement was inadmissible as \"the\r\nadministration of Miranda warnings is insufficient to inform the defendant of his\r\nrights pursuant to Rules 410 and 11(e)(6).\" Id. at 126. In reaching this conclusion,\r\nthe court stated:\r\n\r\n      We do not believe that Miranda warnings, which do not mention the\r\n      rights provided by Rules 410 and 11(e)(6), can make a defendant\r\n      aware of the nature of those rights. Furthermore, the purposes and\r\n      protections of Miranda are substantially different from the\r\n      purposes and protections of Rules 410 and 11(e)(6). The purpose\r\n      of Miranda warnings is to secure the privilege against self-\r\n      incrimination, ensuring that confessions are voluntary and\r\n      intelligent. See State v. Stephenson, 878 S.W.2d 530 [(Tenn. 1994),\r\n      overruled on other grounds by, State v. Saylor, 117 S.W.3d 239\r\n      (Tenn. 2003)]. The purpose of the protections of Rules 410 and\r\n      11(e)(6), on the other hand, is to foster frank and open discussions\r\n      that lead to plea agreements. See Cohen, et al., § 410.1 at 224\r\n      (\"Rule 410 . . . is designed to encourage out-of-court settlements by\r\n      reducing the possible adverse consequences of participating in\r\n      negotiations.\"). Perhaps if the rights protected by and the purposes of\r\n\n      Miranda and the plea-statement rules were the same, such that an\r\n      explanation of one right would serve to explain the nature of the other,\r\n      a warning and waiver of one would serve as a warning and waiver of\r\n      the other. However, such is not the case.\r\n\r\n             We hold that the administration of Miranda warnings is\r\n      insufficient to inform the defendant of his rights pursuant to Rules 410\r\n      and 11(e)(6). Because the defendant in the present case was given\r\n      Miranda warnings and nothing more, the record affirmatively\r\n      indicates that the defendant did not knowingly waive his rights\r\n      pursuant to the plea-statement rules.\r\n\r\nId. at 126 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Based on this reasoning, the court determined that \"the defendant did not\r\nknowingly waive the specific rights afforded by Rule 410 and 11(e)(6).\" Id. at\r\n124. The court further found the erroneous admission of the statement could not\r\nbe deemed harmless as \"[t]he crux of the state's case consisted of the defendant's\r\nstatement.\" Id. at 126.\r\n\r\n       I find the reasoning of Hinton persuasive. Applying the foregoing to the\r\nfacts of the instant case, I believe the trial judge reached his decision under the\r\nmistaken belief that the Miranda waiver was sufficient to automatically deem\r\nPetitioner's statement admissible. This was error as the judge gave no\r\nconsideration to Rule 410. Because Miranda warnings and Rule 410 protections\r\nserve distinctly different purposes, Petitioner's Miranda waiver did not render a\r\npresumptively inadmissible plea statement admissible for the State's use in its case-\r\nin-chief. See Roberts v. Commonwealth, 896 S.W.2d 4 (Ky. 1995) (finding that\r\nstatement made by defendant to police officer during plea discussions was not\r\ninvoluntary where defendant was given Miranda warnings, had executed a waiver\r\nform prior to giving the statement, and there was no evidence that defendant was\r\ncoerced or threatened; concluding that Commonwealth could not, however, use the\r\ndefendant's statement against him on retrial as the statement was made in the\r\ncourse of plea discussions and was protected by Rule 410); Barnett v. State, 725\r\nSo. 2d 797, 800-01 (Miss. 1998) (finding Rule 410 prohibited the admission of a\r\nstatement at trial where defendant gave the statement, after receiving Miranda\r\nwarnings, in conjunction with plea negotiations).\r\n\n                                          (2)\r\n       Because Petitioner's Miranda waiver did not negate the protections of Rule\r\n410, I direct my attention to the terms of the proffer agreement. It is generally\r\nrecognized that proffer agreements are to be construed in accordance with\r\nprinciples of contract law. State v. Compton, 366 S.C. 671, 623 S.E.2d 661 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2005). However, \"[a] plea agreement is not simply a contract between two\r\nparties; rather, it implicates the integrity of the criminal justice system and requires\r\ncourts to exercise judicial authority in considering the agreement.\" 9 Fed. Proc., L.\r\nEd., Fulfillment of Plea Agreement-Interpretation of the Agreement, § 22:960\r\n(Supp. 2013). \"As such, the application of contract principles to the interpretation\r\nof a plea agreement is tempered by constitutional implications.\" Id. Specifically,\r\nproffer agreements, like plea agreements \"are unique contracts in which special\r\ndue process concerns for fairness and the adequacy of procedural safeguards\r\nobtain.\" United States v. Parra, 302 F. Supp. 2d 226, 236 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)\r\n(citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, \"[o]ne tenet of contract law [that courts] have steadfastly\r\napplied to plea agreements . . . is that of contra proferentem, the principle that\r\nambiguities in contracts 'are to be construed unfavorably to the drafter.' \" United\r\nStates v. Transfiguracion, 442 F.3d 1222, 1228 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Black's\r\nLaw Dictionary 328 (7th ed. 1999)). \"In context of plea agreements, the\r\ngovernment is usually the drafter and must ordinarily bear the responsibility for\r\nany lack of clarity.\" Id. (citation omitted). Moreover, \"[a]s a defendant's liberty is\r\nat stake, the government is ordinarily held to the literal terms of the plea agreement\r\nit made so that the government gets what it bargains for but nothing more.\" Id.\r\n(citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       Thus, under the above-outlined principles of contract law, I would find the\r\nplain terms of the proffer agreement precluded the State from introducing\r\nPetitioner's statement during its case-in-chief. As drafted by the State, section 7 of\r\nthe proffer agreement states that \"[v]iolation of any term of this Proffer renders all\r\nterms null and void.\" (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, by claiming that Petitioner\r\nviolated the agreement, the State nullified the entire agreement, including the\r\n\nwaiver provision. In essence, the State rescinded the agreement and avoided its\r\ncontractual obligations by merely alleging Petitioner's statement was deceptive and\r\nnothing more. This rescission rendered Petitioner's statements inadmissible per\r\nse.7   I find support for this decision in the factually similar case of State v. Pitt,\r\n891 A.2d 312 (Md. 2006), wherein the Court of Appeals of Maryland analyzed\r\n\"the proper balance when the defendant breaches the plea agreement and the State,\r\nin response, rescinds the agreement.\" Id. at 316. In Pitt, the defendant was\r\narrested on a burglary charge. Id. Because the defendant expressed interest in\r\n\"cutting a deal,\" the State drafted a plea agreement. Id. After waiving his Miranda\r\nrights, the defendant signed the agreement. Id. Under the agreement, the\r\ndefendant committed \"fully and truthfully [to] disclose to the State any and all\r\nknowledge and information he may have concerning the investigation\" of the\r\nburglary. Id. In return for the defendant's complete and truthful cooperation, the\r\nState agreed to nol pros all charges against the defendant arising from the\r\ninvestigation. Id. The agreement also specifically provided that, in the event of\r\nthe defendant's breach, by knowingly withholding evidence from the State or by\r\nbeing less than completely truthful, the State could \"prosecute [the defendant] for\r\nany offenses in which the State agreed not to prosecute in exchange for\r\ncooperation by [the defendant] with the investigation.\" Id. It also permitted the\r\nState to \"use against [the defendant] in all prosecutions the information and\r\ndocuments that he ha[d] disclosed to the State during the course of his\r\ncooperation.\" Id. The plea agreement also contained a provision that the\r\ndefendant submit to a polygraph examination. Id. at 317 n.4.\r\n\r\n       When the lead investigator became concerned that the defendant had not\r\nbeen forthcoming with all information, he confronted the defendant and requested\r\nthat he submit to a polygraph examination. Id. at 317. The defendant immediately\r\nacknowledged that he had not disclosed everything and admitted to committing the\r\nburglary with an accomplice, but still wanted the State to honor the plea deal. Id.\r\nAs a result, the State considered the defendant's contract \"null and void due to him\r\nnot completely disclosing the information.\" Id. All of the defendant's statements\r\nto the police with respect to the burglary investigation were admitted at his trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n7 In my view, an attorney who allows a client to enter into this type of agreement\r\nmay be at risk for an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\n\nId. After he was convicted of first-degree burglary, the defendant appealed his\r\nconviction. Id.\r\n\r\n       The Maryland Court of Special Appeals reversed. Id. The court concluded\r\nthat, \"although inducements in the context of plea agreements are proper, 'when the\r\nState rescinded the plea agreement, statements obtained under it immediately lost\r\ntheir voluntary status and became inadmissible at trial.' \" Id. at 317 (quoting Pitt v.\r\nState, 832 A.2d 267, 277 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2003)). The State petitioned the\r\nCourt of Appeals of Maryland for a writ of certiorari to review the decision. Id.\r\nThe court granted the writ of certiorari to address \"the admissibility of statements\r\nmade during plea negotiations when the plea agreement contains a provision\r\nmaking such statements admissible at trial in the event of breach.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Ultimately, the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the intermediate\r\nappellate court. Id. In so ruling, the court recognized that \"when the State rescinds\r\na plea agreement for any reason, the obtained statements are rendered inadmissible\r\nper se.\" Id. at 322. Expanding on the holdings of its prior decisions, the court\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n      The reason for the State's repudiation of the agreement is immaterial\r\n      with respect to the admissibility of the statement. Whether its reason\r\n      be sound or unsound, technical or substantial, in good faith or simply\r\n      because the prosecutor had misgivings or a change of heart, or was\r\n      utterly arbitrary, is of no matter. The justification vel non of the\r\n      rescission, repudiation, or breach of the agreement by the State goes\r\n      to whether the defendant is entitled to have the agreement enforced; it\r\n      does not affect the admissibility of the statement obtained under it.\r\n\r\nId. at 322 (quoting Allgood v. State, 522 A.2d 917, 927 (Md. 1987) and citing\r\nWright v. State, 515 A.2d 1157 (Md. 1986)). The court noted that this holding was\r\n\"to ensure that neither the defendant nor the State benefits from breaching the plea\r\nagreement.\" Id. at 325.\r\n\r\n       I am persuaded by this reasoning as it comports with the applicable\r\nprinciples of contract law and properly preserves the protections of Rule 410.\r\nHere, the State rescinded the proffer agreement based on its assessment that\r\nPetitioner breached the agreement by purportedly failing the polygraph\r\nexamination. Thus, by their actions, the parties were returned to the position as if\r\nthere were no proffer agreement. See 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts § 584 (2004)\r\n\n(\"Rescission voids the contract ab initio, meaning that it is considered null from the\r\nbeginning and treated as if it does not exist for any purpose. . . . The effect of\r\nrescission of an agreement is to put the parties back in the same position they were\r\nin prior to the execution of the contract.\"). In the absence of a proffer agreement,\r\nPetitioner's statements were deemed inadmissible for any purpose under Rule 410.\r\nAccordingly, I would find the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the decision of\r\nthe trial judge.\r\n\r\n       In view of this decision, the State would be prohibited from introducing\r\nPetitioner's statements in the event of a retrial.8 Because this decision is\r\ndispositive, I need not address Petitioner's remaining arguments. However, in\r\norder to provide guidance in future cases, I use the instant case as an opportunity to\r\nanalyze the effect of a valid Rule 410 waiver.\r\n\r\n                                         (3)\r\n       Alternatively, even if the terms of the proffer agreement did not render it\r\n\"null and void\" and there was no rescission on the part of the State, I would find\r\nthat Petitioner's breach would not have automatically waived the protections of\r\nRule 410. See Christopher B. Mueller and Laird C. Kirkpatrick, 2 Federal\r\nEvidence § 4:67 (3d. ed. 2012) (\"In this situation, it is not the agreement that\r\nconfers the right to exclude, but Fed. R. Evid. 410, and breaching the agreement\r\ndoes not end the protection accorded by the Rule.\").\r\n\r\n       Instead, it is necessary to consider the effect of a breach and decide the\r\nresultant remedy, i.e., the extent to which the State may utilize statements made by\r\na defendant pursuant to a proffer agreement. In doing so, it is necessary to assess\r\nthe terms of Rule 410 as interpreted by the USSC in the seminal case of United\r\nStates v. Mezzanatto, 513 U.S. 196 (1995).9 In Mezzanatto, the USSC held that\r\n\"absent some affirmative indication that the agreement was entered into\r\n8 The State, however, is not without some benefit as these statements were\r\ninevitably used for informational purposes in the murder investigation and\r\ninitiating charges against Petitioner.\r\n9 Although Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and our Rule 410 are substantially\r\nsimilar, I look to federal interpretations merely for guidance as this Court is not\r\nbound by the USSC's interpretation of the federal rule when we are called upon to\r\ninterpret our state evidentiary rules.\r\n\nunknowingly or involuntarily, an agreement to waive the exclusionary provisions\r\nof the plea-statement Rules is valid and enforceable.\" Id. at 211. The Court,\r\nhowever, only considered the enforceability of such waivers for impeachment\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n       Justice Thomas, writing the plurality opinion, premised his analysis on the\r\nfact that a criminal defendant may waive many rights, including constitutional\r\nrights, by voluntary agreement. Id. at 201. As a result, the Court concluded that\r\n\"[b]ecause the plea-statement Rules were enacted against a background\r\npresumption that legal rights generally, and evidentiary provisions specifically, are\r\nsubject to waiver by voluntary agreement of the parties, we will not interpret\r\nCongress' silence as an implicit rejection of waivability.\" Id. at 203-04. The Court\r\nfurther found the defendant \"bears the responsibility of identifying some\r\naffirmative basis for concluding that the plea-statement Rules depart from the\r\npresumption of waivability.\" Id. at 204.\r\n\r\n       Justice Ginsburg concurred in a separate opinion, which was joined by\r\nJustices O'Connor and Breyer, wherein she expressed concern regarding a waiver\r\nthat would allow the Government to use the defendant's statements in its case-in-\r\nchief as this \"would more severely undermine a defendant's incentive to negotiate,\r\nand thereby inhibit plea bargaining.\" Id. at 211. Because the Government did not\r\nseek such a waiver in Mezzanatto's case, she found the Court did not need to\r\n\"explore\" this question. Id.\r\n\r\n        Justice Souter dissented in a separate opinion, which was joined by Justice\r\nStevens. Id. at 211-18. The dissent rejected the plurality's holding as there was no\r\nconsideration given to Congress' intent to preclude waiver. Id. at 212-16. The\r\ndissent also identified two potential consequences of the majority's decision. Id. at\r\n216. First, the dissent noted that \"defendants are generally in no position to\r\nchallenge demands for these waivers, and the use of waiver provisions as contracts\r\nof adhesion has become accepted practice.\" Id. at 216. Second, the dissent\r\nbelieved the plurality's decision would inevitably lead to \"the practical certainty\r\nthat the waiver demanded will in time come to function as a waiver of trial itself.\"\r\nId. at 217. The dissent explained that \"[i]f objection can be waived for\r\nimpeachment use, it can be waived for use as affirmative evidence, and if the\r\nGovernment can effectively demand waiver in the former instance, there is no\r\nreason to believe it will not do so just as successfully in the latter.\" Id.\r\n\n      Thus, the majority of the Court opposed the Government's use of a\r\ndefendant's statement as affirmative evidence in its case-in-chief.\r\n\r\n                                         (4)\r\n      Because Mezzanatto only addressed whether a defendant's waiver of the\r\nexclusionary provisions of Rule 410 authorized the prosecution to use the\r\ndefendant's statement for impeachment purposes, it is necessary to determine\r\nwhether the reasoning in Mezzanatto should be extended to permit the use of the\r\nstatement during the prosecution's case-in-chief.\r\n\r\n       Although our appellate courts have referenced Rule 410, they have not\r\naddressed Mezzanatto or considered a defendant's written waiver of the protections\r\nof Rule 410. However, to a limited extent, these decisions express this Court's\r\ninclination to prohibit the use of a defendant's statements made during the course\r\nof plea negotiations. For example, in State v. Thompson, 329 S.C. 72, 495 S.E.2d\r\n437 (1998), this Court held that the State should not have been permitted to\r\nimpeach the defendant with privileged information, which was revealed by the\r\ndefendant during a psychiatric evaluation and disclosed by the defense attorney to\r\nthe State during plea negotiations. In so ruling, we found the attorney-client\r\nprivilege, which was not waived by the defendant, extended to his communications\r\nwith the psychiatrist. Id. at 76, 495 S.E.2d at 439. We noted that this analysis had\r\n\"limited, future application\" as scenarios such as the one presented would be\r\ngoverned by Rule 410(4), which provides that a statement made during plea\r\ndiscussions is \"not admissible against the defendant.\" Id. at 77 n.1, 495 S.E.2d at\r\n440 n.1. We clarified, however, that \"result which would be reached under Rule\r\n410(4) is consistent with the holding in this case.\" Id. Even though Thompson is\r\ninstructive, it is not dispositive of the instant case as Thompson did not involve a\r\nwaiver.Given the absence of definitive case law in our state and federal jurisdiction,\r\nI have looked to other federal jurisdictions for guidance. These courts have\r\nidentified three levels of waiver: (1) impeachment, (2) rebuttal, and (3) case-in-\r\nchief. David P. Leonard, The New Wigmore: A Treatise on Evidence: Selected\r\nRules of Limited Admissibility § 5.11 (Supp. 2013).\r\n\r\n      Some legal scholars have expressed concern over extending the holding in\r\nMezzanatto to permit use of a defendant's proffer statements in the Government's\r\ncase-in-chief. See 23 Charles Alan Wright & Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal\r\n\nPractice and Procedure: Evidence § 5350 (West Supp. 2012) (\"Federal\r\nprosecutors have exercised the powers granted by Mezzanatto to impose\r\nprocedures far different than those presupposed by the drafters of Rule 410.\").\r\nThey have emphasized that an overreaching extension of Mezzanatto constitutes a\r\nwaiver of a defendant's constitutionally protected rights as \"the only defense\r\narguments the defendant can make, without opening the door to the incriminating\r\nplea statements, consist of (1) arguing sufficiency of the evidence, (2) impeaching\r\ngovernment witnesses, and (3) making general statements as to the defendant's\r\ninnocence.\" Adam Robison, Comment, Waiver of Plea Agreement Statements: A\r\nGlimmer of Hope to Limit Plea Statement Usage to Impeachment, 46 S. Tex. L.\r\nRev. 661, 677 (Spring 2005).\r\n\r\n     One scholar has identified three consequences of finding that a defendant\r\nmay execute a total waiver of Rule 410, stating:\r\n\r\n             The consequences of finding that Rule 410 is a waivable right\r\n      are also problematic. First, an exception to the Rule to allow use of\r\n      otherwise inadmissible statements will eventually swallow the Rule,\r\n      completely undermining the purpose of enacting the Rule in the first\r\n      place. Congress would not have enacted Rule 410 if it intended the\r\n      Rule to be circumvented so easily and frequently that circumvention\r\n      became the norm, rather than the exception. A second problematic\r\n      consequence is that the case-in-chief waiver essentially serves as a\r\n      waiver of the right to trial. When a defendant decides to engage in\r\n      plea discussions that ultimately fail, the use of his statements at trial in\r\n      the prosecution's case-in-chief eliminates the need for the prosecution\r\n      to bring any other evidence to trial because his statements serve as his\r\n      confession to the crime. Therefore, a case-in-chief waiver becomes a\r\n      waiver of trial.\r\n\r\n             By extension, a third consequence arises. A case-in-chief\r\n      waiver also amounts to a waiver of the defendant's Fifth Amendment\r\n      rights. The Fifth Amendment guarantees to every citizen the right\r\n      against forced self-incrimination in criminal trials. Under the Fifth\r\n      Amendment, a defendant shall not be forced to produce evidence\r\n      against himself. One purpose of the Fifth Amendment is to preserve\r\n      the integrity of the judicial system by requiring the prosecution to\r\n      shoulder the entire burden of proof. Because the prosecution must\r\n\n      prove every element of the offense, the Fifth Amendment protects the\r\n      defendant from forcibly helping the prosecution convict him. If a\r\n      defendant chooses not to testify at his own trial, but he has signed a\r\n      Rule 410 waiver allowing the prosecution to introduce his\r\n      incriminating statements made during plea negotiations in its case-in-\r\n      chief, the defendant's right to choose not to testify and incriminate\r\n      himself has been breached.\r\n\r\nJulia A. Keck, United States v. Sylvester: The Expansion of the Waiver of Federal\r\nRule of Evidence 410 to Allow Case-in-Chief Use of Plea Negotiation Statements,\r\n84 Tul. L. Rev. 1385, 1399 (May 2010) (footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\n       I am persuaded by these authorities and, thus, conclude that the reasoning in\r\nMezzanatto should not be extended to permit a case-in-chief waiver. I believe a\r\ndecision to limit the prosecution's use of a defendant's statements to impeachment\r\neffectuates the purpose and protections of Rule 410. Moreover, such a decision is\r\nconsistent with this Court's opinion in Thompson, wherein we held that the State\r\nshould not have been permitted to impeach the defendant with privileged\r\ninformation, which was disclosed by the defense attorney to the State during plea\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\n        As evidenced by the facts of the instant case, the fears of the dissent in\r\nMezzanatto have become a reality. Specifically, the State's case against Petitioner\r\nwas based entirely on his statement and, thus, the waiver \"function[ed] as a waiver\r\nof trial itself.\" Mezzanatto, 513 U.S. at 217 (Souter, J., dissenting).\r\n\r\n                                         (5)\r\n       Finally, I take this opportunity to express my concern regarding the State's\r\nuse of a polygraph examination to conclusively determine Petitioner's truthfulness\r\nand, in turn, declare the agreement null and void. Because our appellate courts\r\nhave repeatedly recognized the unreliability of these tests,10 I believe it was\r\ninherently unfair for the State to use subjective results to procure the only\r\n\r\n10 See Lorenzen v. State, 376 S.C. 521, 533, 657 S.E.2d 771, 778 (2008)\r\n(\"Although this Court in Council [v. State, 335 S.C. 1, 24, 515 S.E.2d 508, 520\r\n(1999)] declined to recognize a per se rule against the admission of polygraph\r\nevidence, it indicated that the 'admissibility of this type of scientific evidence\r\nshould be analyzed under Rules 702 and 403, SCRE and the Jones factors.' \").\r\n\nsubstantive evidence against Petitioner. See People v. Garcia, 169 P.3d 223, 228\r\n(Colo. Ct. App. 2007) (concluding defendant's statements, which were made\r\nduring a polygraph examination as part of plea negotiations, were inadmissible as\r\nsubstantive evidence of guilt under Rule 410; stating, \"To penalize defendant for\r\ncooperating with the prosecution's request by introducing his statements as\r\nsubstantive proof of guilt is palpably unfair and undermines the public policy of\r\nencouraging fair compromises.\"). Moreover, to allow the prosecution to declare\r\nthe agreement null and void for reason of deception and then not require the\r\nprosecution to identify the deception and its materiality to the agreement is\r\nfundamentally unfair and violates the general principles of contract law.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, even if Petitioner agreed to the State's use of a polygraph to\r\ndetermine truthfulness, I cannot condone the admission of a statement in the State's\r\ncase-in-chief that has been deemed false. By concluding that Petitioner was being\r\ndeceptive in his answers, the State found Petitioner's statement to be false. Yet, the\r\nState presented this statement to the jury with the intention that the jurors believe it\r\nas truthful. The State relied on this false statement as the primary basis to procure\r\na conviction. In essence, the State's action suborns perjury. Because this Court is\r\ncalled upon to uphold the integrity of this state's legal system, I would decline to\r\npermit such an affront to the integrity of the judicial process. See Riddle v.\r\nOzmint, 369 S.C. 39, 48, 631 S.E.2d 70, 75 (2006) (\"A 'prosecutor's deliberate\r\ndeception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is\r\nincompatible with rudimentary demands of justice.' \" (quoting Giglio v. United\r\nStates, 405 U.S. 150, 153 (1972)).III.   Conclusion\r\n       Based on the foregoing, I would hold the Court of Appeals erred in\r\naffirming the trial judge's decision to permit the State to use Petitioner's plea\r\nstatements during its case-in-chief. Initially, I would find Petitioner's Miranda\r\nwaiver did not operate to waive the protections of Rule 410. Instead, the\r\nadmissibility of the statements was dependent upon the terms of the proffer\r\nagreement. Utilizing the principles of contract law, I believe the agreement was\r\nnullified in its entirety when the State found that Petitioner breached the\r\nagreement. Because the State rescinded the agreement, it was void ab initio and\r\nthe parties were returned to their original positions. Thus, Petitioner's plea\r\nstatements were deemed inadmissible pursuant to Rule 410.\r\n\n       As to future cases, I would find that a breach of a proffer agreement on the\r\npart of the defendant permits the State to use a defendant's plea statements only for\r\npurposes of impeachment. I believe such a decision preserves the protections of\r\nRule 410 and effectively maintains the integrity of the judicial process. Finally, I\r\nwould caution the State against rescinding an agreement on the sole basis of a\r\nfailed polygraph examination as these tests are inherently unreliable. Given the\r\nlack of reliability, I believe it is patently unfair for the State to use these subjective\r\nresults as the sole basis for asserting that the defendant was untruthful and, thus,\r\nbreached a proffer agreement. The inequity is amplified when the State is allowed\r\nto use the same statement in its case against the defendant.\r\n\r\n      I am deeply trouble by the majority's haste to lend the Court's imprimatur to\r\nthe knowing misleading of the jury by the use of acknowledged false testimony.\r\nNo interpretation of contract law should suborn perjury. Even if we assume the\r\ndefendant's statement was false, what rule of law allows a court to ignore the\r\nprimary role of the prosecutor and the jury to seek the truth?\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, I would reverse Petitioner's conviction and remand\r\nthe matter for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27417","title":"Board of Trustees for the Fairfield County School District v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n                                     FACTS\r\nFor the past four decades between 100 and 200 children residing in the Mitford\r\nCommunity of Fairfield County have been attending CCSD schools in the Great\r\nFalls area of Chester County. The CCSD schools are closer to the Mitford\r\nCommunity than are any FCSD schools. The Mitford students have been attending\r\nCCSD schools at no cost to the students or their families.\r\n\r\nMitford students' attendance at CCSD schools began as a result of a Federal 1970\r\ndesegregation order, which required the all African-American Mitford Elementary\r\nSchool be closed, and its students be given the choice of attending CCSD's Great\r\nFalls schools. In 1972, the General Assembly passed Act No. 1236, consolidating\r\nthe Mitford Community into CCSD. This Act was repealed the following year\r\nbased on an agreement between FCSD and CCSD respecting the Mitford\r\nCommunity's students' enrollment in CCSD's schools. Under this agreement,\r\nFCSD paid CCSD $25,000 per year for educational expenses.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, this long standing agreement began to break down and finally ended in the\r\n2009-10 school year when no agreement was reached for that year or thereafter. In\r\nlight of the school districts' failure to reach an agreement for payment to CCSD for\r\nthe cost of educating Mitford Community's students in CCSD's schools and\r\nFCSD's refusal to continue negotiations, the General Assembly passed Act No. 294\r\n\nof 2010 (Act No. 294)1 in order to provide for a uniform arrangement between\r\nFCSD and CCSD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Act No. 294 is now codified as S.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-485 (Supp. 2013) and\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n      (A) The General Assembly finds that numerous public school students reside\r\n      in Fairfield County School District but are entitled to attend the schools of\r\n      Chester County School District pursuant to Section 59-63-480. The General\r\n      Assembly finds it necessary to provide by law for uniform arrangements\r\n      between Fairfield County School District and Chester County School\r\n      District pertaining to these students.\r\n\r\n      (B) A student who qualifies for transfer pursuant to Section 59-63-480 may\r\n      be admitted, and remain enrolled, by Chester County School District upon\r\n      proof of eligibility as Chester County School District finds acceptable. A\r\n      roster of these students must be kept current by Chester County School\r\n      District and sent to Fairfield County School District as and when updated.\r\n\r\n      (1) Each fiscal year, for each pupil authorized to transfer from Fairfield\r\n      County School District to Chester County School District pursuant to\r\n      Section 59-63-480 and actually enrolled in a public school of Chester\r\n      County School District, the Fairfield County Treasurer, on behalf of and\r\n      from funds of the Fairfield County School District, shall pay Chester County\r\n      School District one hundred and three percent of Chester County School\r\n      District's prior year local revenue per pupil for school operating purposes as\r\n      reported in Chester County School District's annual audit for the\r\n      immediately preceding fiscal year.\r\n\r\n      (2) As used in this section, “prior year local revenue per pupil for school\r\n      operating purposes” includes any state reimbursement paid for property tax\r\n      exemptions from Chester County School District ad valorem taxes\r\n      including, but not limited to, all payments pursuant to Section 11-11-156.\r\n\n(C) Upon invoice, the Fairfield County Treasurer, on behalf of and from the\r\nfunds of the Fairfield County School District, shall pay Chester County\r\nSchool District the amount determined pursuant to subsection (B)(1) of this\r\nsection. Payment to Chester County School District must be completed\r\nbefore the fifteenth day of February in each fiscal year. If the Fairfield\r\nCounty Treasurer fails to pay this invoice by the fifteenth day of February,\r\nthe South Carolina Department of Education, upon application by Chester\r\nCounty School District, out of the funds otherwise meant for the next\r\nEducation Finance Act disbursement to Fairfield County School District,\r\nshall pay the invoice on behalf of Fairfield County School District. Any\r\nundisputed amounts must be paid when due.\r\n\r\n(D) Chester County School District may consider payments pursuant to this\r\nact to be anticipated ad valorem taxation for purposes of Subsection 7,\r\nSection 15, Article X of the South Carolina Constitution, relating to tax\r\nanticipation notes.\r\n\r\n(E) The State Superintendent of Education shall settle any dispute between\r\nChester County School District and Fairfield County School District arising\r\nfrom the implementation and administration of this act by the school districts\r\nand the State Department of Education.\r\n\r\n(F) For the 2009-2010 school and the fiscal year only, the Fairfield County\r\nTreasurer, on behalf of and from the funds of the Fairfield County School\r\nDistrict, shall pay the Chester County School District an amount calculated\r\npursuant to items (B)(1) and (2) of this section on account of the pupils\r\nenrolled in the Chester County School District from Fairfield County\r\npursuant to Section 59-63-480 for the 2009-2010 school year. This amount\r\nmust be invoiced by the Chester County School District promptly upon the\r\neffective date of this section, and must be paid no later than June 30, 2010,\r\nor the delinquency provisions of subsection (C) apply to the payment.\r\n\nPursuant to section 59-63-485(C), CCSD has invoiced the Fairfield County\r\nTreasurer $1,838,703 for the expenses of educating the Mitford children for the\r\npast three school years.\r\n\r\nFCSD filed suit against the Respondents seeking a declaratory judgment that Act\r\nNo. 294 was unconstitutional. FCSD contended that Act No. 294 was\r\nunconstitutional special legislation in violation of S.C. Const. art. III, § 34(IX),\r\n\"because it directly conflicts with and undermines South Carolina's general law\r\ngoverning residence requirements for school attendance and general law governing\r\nthe financing of schools.\" CCSD, the State, and FCSD filed cross motions for\r\nsummary judgment as to the constitutionality of Act No. 294. The circuit court\r\nissued an order denying FCSD's motion and granting CCSD and the State's\r\nmotions for summary judgment, holding that Act No. 294 was constitutional\r\nspecial legislation, and FCSD appealed.\r\n\r\n                                  Standard of Review\r\n\"In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, [an appellate court] applies the\r\nsame standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP: summary\r\njudgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the\r\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Pittman v. Grand Strand\r\nEntm't, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005).\r\n\r\n                                       Discussion\r\nThe only issue before this Court is whether the circuit court erred in granting\r\nsummary judgment because FCSD failed to carry its burden of production. The\r\nparties agree that Act No. 294 is special legislation because the more general law\r\nfound in S.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-480 (2004)2 applies to the transfer of students\r\n\r\n\r\n    Section 59-63-480 provides:\r\n2        If school children in one county reside closer to schools in an adjacent\r\n         county, they may attend such schools upon the school authorities of\r\n         the county of their residence arranging with the school officials of the\r\n         adjacent county for such admission and upon payment of appropriate\r\n         charges as herein authorized. The board of trustees in the school\r\n\nbetween school districts based upon geographic proximity. In addition, FCSD\r\ncontends that Act No. 294 violates Article III, § 34(IX) because the General\r\nAssembly has failed to set forth any logical basis or sound reason for Act No. 294's\r\nenactment. We agree with the circuit court that FCSD failed to present any\r\nevidence that the General Assembly had neither a logical basis nor sound reason\r\nfor enacting Act No. 294 and therefore affirm the circuit court order granting\r\nsummary judgment.\r\n\r\nArticle III, § 34(IX), states in pertinent part: “where a general law can be made\r\napplicable, no special law shall be enacted.” Despite this language, it is well\r\nsettled that Article III, § 34(IX) does not prohibit all special legislation, as this\r\nCourt recently explained:\r\n\r\n      A law is general when it applies uniformly to all persons or things\r\n      within a proper class, and special when it applies to only one or more\r\n      individuals or things belonging to that same class. If the legislation\r\n      does not apply uniformly, the inquiry then becomes whether the\r\n      legislation creates an unlawful classification. However, the mere fact\r\n      that a law creates a classification does not render it unlawful. Instead,\r\n      the constitutional prohibition against special legislation operates\r\n      similarly to our equal protection guarantee in that it prohibits\r\n      unreasonable and arbitrary classifications. A classification is arbitrary,\r\n\r\n\r\n      district in which the pupils reside shall make written application\r\n      through its county board of education to the board of trustees of the\r\n      district in which the school is located for the admission of such\r\n      children, giving full information as to ages, residence and school\r\n      attainment, and the board of trustees in the school district, agreeing to\r\n      accept such pupils, shall give a written statement of agreement. Upon\r\n      receipt of such application the board of trustees of the school and its\r\n      county board of education shall determine the monthly per pupil cost\r\n      of all overhead expenses of the school, which will include all\r\n      expenses of the school not paid by the State. Upon proper\r\n      arrangement being made for the payment monthly of such overhead\r\n      per pupil cost for each such child the same shall be admitted to the\r\n      schools of the adjacent county.\r\n\n      and therefore unconstitutional, if there is no reasonable hypothesis to\r\n      support it. Accordingly, special legislation is not unconstitutional\r\n      where there is a substantial distinction having reference to the subject\r\n      matter of the proposed legislation, between the objects or places\r\n      embraced in such legislation and the objects and places excluded.\r\n      Charleston County. Sch. Dist. v. Harrell, 393 S.C. 552, 558, 713\r\n      S.E.2d 604, 608 (2011) (citations and quotations omitted).\r\n\r\nThus, where a special law will best meet the exigencies3 of a particular situation, it\r\nis not unconstitutional. Id. at 558, 713 S.E.2d at 608 (citing Med. Soc'y of S.C. v.\r\nMed Univ. of S.C., 334 S.C. 270, 279, 513 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1999)). Restated,\r\nspecial legislation will survive a constitutional challenge where there is a logical\r\nbasis and sound reason for resorting to such legislation. Id. (citing Horry County v.\r\nHorry County Higher Educ. Comm'n, 306 S.C. 416, 419, 412 S.E.2d 421, 423\r\n(1991)). Additionally, while not exempt from the requirements of Article III, §\r\n34(IX), this Court has recognized that the General Assembly has broad authority\r\nwhen enacting legislation that deals with education. Horry County, at 419, 412\r\nS.E.2d at 423.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court found that FCSD presented no evidence tending to show that the\r\nGeneral Assembly's enactment of Act. No. 294 violated the proscription of Article\r\nIII, 34(IX). We agree.\r\n\r\nFCSD's sole argument below and on appeal is that there is neither a logical basis\r\nnor a sound reason for this legislation because the transfer of these students could\r\nbe provided for by existing general law. This argument, however, merely\r\nestablishes that Act No. 294 is special legislation and is not probative of the second\r\nelement that a challenger must establish, that is, whether the General Assembly\r\nfailed to have a logical basis or sound reason for enacting Act No. 294. Therefore,\r\nthe circuit court was correct in holding that FCSD had failed to present any\r\nevidence as to why there was neither a logical basis nor sound reason for enacting\r\nAct No. 294.\r\n\r\n\r\n We note that exigency as used in this sense means \"that which is required in a\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nparticular situation.\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary, http://www.merriam-\r\nwebster.com/dictionary/exigency.\r\n\nIt is well settled that the non-moving party may not rely on mere allegations to\r\nresist summary judgment but must present some evidence in the form of affidavits\r\nor otherwise in support of its proposition. Woodson v. DLI Props., LLC, 406 S.C.\r\n517, 753 S.E.2d 428 (2014). Because FCSD has failed to present any evidence\r\nbeyond mere allegations that there is neither a logical basis nor sound reason for\r\nthe enactment of Act No. 294, we must affirm the grant of summary judgment by\r\nthe circuit court.4\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J. and KITTREDGE, J., concur. BEATTY, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion in which HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 The dissent criticizes this holding because we \"myopically focus on the\r\nprocedural posture of the case\" leading to \"truncated analysis\" that \"fails to fully\r\naddress the constitutional propriety of Act No. 294.\" First, we readily acknowledge\r\nthat we endeavor to decide an appeal as the parties have procedurally presented it.\r\nWe exceed our proper role when we do not honor these boundaries. As to our\r\n\"truncated analysis,\" FCSD failed to present any evidence that the termination of\r\nthis historical arrangement was neither a logical basis nor a sound reason for\r\nenacting this special legislation. Woodson, supra. Our analysis must necessarily\r\nend here.\r\n        The dissent however, applies a more \"comprehensive analysis.\" While the\r\ndissent acknowledges this Court's deference to the General Assembly and the\r\nburden on FCSD, it then requires a \"quantitative or statistical comparison to other\r\nschool districts\" to support the enactment of Act. No. 294. We have never required\r\nquantitative or statistical justification of legislation even in the context of special\r\nlegislation. Assuming this case did turn on such a comparison, FCSD, as the party\r\nchallenging the legislation, is the party required to present such a quantitative or\r\nstatistical comparison to other school districts so as to demonstrate the absence of\r\nan exigent circumstance. While the dissent applies a \"comprehensive analysis,\" it\r\nfails to explain why it requires more from the General Assembly than it requires\r\nfrom the party challenging the legislation.\r\n\n        JUSTICE BEATTY: I respectfully dissent. The majority agrees that Act\r\nNo. 294 is special legislation; however, it affirms the grant of summary judgment\r\nbecause \"FCSD failed to present any evidence that the General Assembly had\r\nneither a logical basis nor sound reason for enacting Act No. 294.\" In reaching this\r\nconclusion, the majority myopically focuses on the procedural posture of the\r\ninstant case and, in turn, effectively discounts the fundamental question regarding\r\nthe constitutionality of Act No. 294. In my view, the majority's truncated analysis\r\nfails to fully address the constitutional propriety of Act No. 294. If one engages in\r\na comprehensive analysis, I believe the result is clear that Act No. 294 is\r\nunconstitutional special legislation.\r\n\r\n                                  I.     Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    General / Special Legislation\r\n\r\n        Our state constitution prohibits the enactment of certain special or local laws\r\nas it provides, \"The General Assembly of this State shall not enact local or special\r\nlaws . . . where a general law can be made applicable.\" S.C. Const. art. III, § 34, c.\r\nIX. \"The purpose of the prohibition on special legislation is to make uniform\r\nwhere possible the statutory laws of this State in order to avoid duplicative or\r\nconflicting laws on the same subject.\" Med. Soc'y of S.C. v. Med. Univ. of S.C.,\r\n334 S.C. 270, 279, 513 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1999). \"The allowance of special\r\nlegislation, where a general law could be made applicable, fosters 'legislation by\r\ndelegation,' which is pernicious.\" Duke Power Co. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 284\r\nS.C. 81, 90, 326 S.E.2d 395, 400 (1985) (citations omitted). \"Such legislation\r\nlacks the settled consideration and consent of the lawmaking body, evades\r\nstatewide responsibility, encourages local activity, [and] discourages the attrition\r\nof minds and the consideration of those problems which make for a wise public\r\npolicy.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       The General Assembly may, however, enact \"special provisions in general\r\nlaws.\" S.C. Const. art. III, § 34, c. X. \"[A] general law is defined as follows: 'In\r\norder that a law may be general, it must be of force in every county in the state,\r\nand while it may contain special provisions making its effect different in certain\r\ncounties, those counties cannot be exempt from its entire operation.' \" City of\r\nColumbia v. Smith, 105 S.C. 348, 361-62, 89 S.E. 1028, 1032 (1916) (quoting\r\n\nDean v. Spartanburg Cnty., 59 S.C. 110, 114, 37 S.E. 226, 228 (1900)). Stated\r\nanother way, \"special provisions in general laws\" means that \"provisions in general\r\nlaws, which, while having a limited application, must not be so inconsistent with\r\nthe general scheme or purpose of the statute as to prevent substantial uniformity of\r\noperation throughout the state.\" Gamble v. Clarendon Cnty., 188 S.C. 250, 257,\r\n198 S.E. 857, 861 (1938).\r\n\r\n       Legislation regarding education is not exempt from the constitutional\r\nprohibition of special laws, \"even though art. XI, § 3, gives the General Assembly\r\nmore discretion with respect to legislation impacting a school district than it has in\r\nother areas.\" Home Builders Ass'n of S.C. v. Sch. Dist. No. 2 of Dorchester Cnty.,\r\n405 S.C. 458, 460, 748 S.E.2d 230, 232 (2013). Moreover, \"[i]t is firmly settled in\r\nthis state that while it is primarily for the Legislature to decide whether a general\r\nlaw can be made applicable in any specific case, the question is ultimately a\r\njudicial one, in solving which the Courts will give due consideration to the opinion\r\nof the Legislature.\" Sansing v. Cherokee Cnty. Tourist Camp Bd., 195 S.C. 7, 10,\r\n10 S.E.2d 157, 158 (1940).\r\n\r\n       In answering this question, our appellate courts have continued to adhere to\r\nthe well-established analytical framework for assessing whether legislation\r\nconstitutes prohibitive special legislation. See Charleston Cnty. Sch. Dist. v.\r\nHarrell, 393 S.C. 552, 713 S.E.2d 604 (2011) (reaffirming test to determine\r\nwhether special legislation exists as outlined in Kizer v. Clark, 360 S.C. 86, 600\r\nS.E.2d 529 (2004)). In Harrell, this Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"A law is general when it applies uniformly to all persons or things\r\n      within a proper class, and special when it applies to only one or more\r\n      individuals or things belonging to that same class.\" If the legislation\r\n      does not apply uniformly, the inquiry then becomes whether the\r\n      legislation creates an unlawful classification. However, the mere fact\r\n      that a law creates a classification does not render it unlawful. Instead,\r\n      the constitutional prohibition against special legislation operates\r\n      similarly to our equal protection guarantee in that it prohibits\r\n      unreasonable and arbitrary classifications. \"A classification is\r\n      arbitrary, and therefore unconstitutional, if there is no reasonable\r\n\n      hypothesis to support it.\" Accordingly, special legislation is not\r\n      unconstitutional where there is \"a substantial distinction having\r\n      reference to the subject matter of the proposed legislation, between\r\n      the objects or places embraced in such legislation and the objects and\r\n      places excluded.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 558, 713 S.E.2d at 608 (citations omitted). \"Thus, where a special law will\r\nbest meet the exigencies of a particular situation, it is not unconstitutional.\" Id. at\r\n558, 713 S.E.2d at 608 (citing Med.

Analysis of Act No. 294\r\n\r\n        The parties concede that Act No. 294 is special legislation as it applies only\r\nto FCSD and CCSD. This concession, however, is not dispositive as one must still\r\nanalyze the constitutional propriety of Act No. 294. In doing so, it is necessary to\r\nfirst assess whether Act No. 294 conflicts with general law governing the transfer\r\nof students to a non-resident school district. In conjunction with this assessment,\r\none must also consider whether Act No. 294 may be deemed a special provision\r\nwithin the general law. If Act No. 294 conflicts with the general law, the question\r\nbecomes whether the General Assembly espoused a logical basis and sound reason\r\nfor enacting this special legislation. As will be discussed, I would hold that Act\r\nNo. 294 is unconstitutional special legislation as it is in direct conflict with existing\r\ngeneral law governing the transfer of students to non-resident school districts and\r\nthere is no evidence that the General Assembly had a logical basis and sound\r\nreason for resorting to this special legislation.\r\n\r\n             (1)     General Laws Governing Public Education\r\n       The South Carolina Constitution imposes on the General Assembly the duty\r\nto \"provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free public schools\r\nopen to all children in the State.\" S.C. Const. art. XI, § 3. In fulfilling this duty,\r\nthe General Assembly has enacted a scheme of general laws governing public\r\neducation throughout our state. Pursuant to these general laws, all South Carolina\r\n\nchildren who meet the requisite qualifications are entitled to a free public\r\neducation. See S.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-30 (2004) (outlining qualifications for\r\nchild's attendance in a public school district without charge); S.C. Code Ann. § 59-\r\n63-31 (2004 & Supp. 2012) (identifying additional qualifications for child's\r\nattendance in a public school district without charge involving situations such as a\r\ncourt-ordered custody arrangement or foster care placement). In order to achieve\r\nthis goal, the General Assembly created a method of financing school districts\r\nthrough the use of federal, state, and local funds. See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. §§ 59-\r\n20-10 to -80 (2004 & Supp. 2012) (provisions of the South Carolina Education\r\nFinance Act of 1977); id. §§ 59-21-10 to -1220 (providing for state aid for\r\nschools); id. §§ 59-73-10 to -160 (authorizing county taxation for school purposes).\r\n\r\n       Cognizant that a child's educational needs may be better met by a school in a\r\nnon-resident district, the General Assembly has enacted general laws authorizing\r\nchildren to transfer to an adjacent school district if it is closer in proximity to the\r\nchild's home or to an adjoining school district if a particular school would better\r\naccommodate the student. See S.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-480 (2004) (permitting\r\nschool children, who reside in county closer to schools to adjacent county, to\r\nattend schools in adjacent county upon application by the transferring board of\r\ntrustees to the board of trustees in the receiving district); id. § 59-63-490\r\n(providing that when a child would be \"better accommodated at the school of an\r\nadjoining school district, whether special or otherwise, the board of trustees of the\r\nschool district in which such person resides may, with the consent of the board of\r\ntrustees of the school district in which such school is located, transfer such person\r\nfor education to the school district in which such school is located, and the trustees\r\nof the school district in which the school is located shall receive such person into\r\nthe school as though he resided within the district\").\r\n\r\n       In each of these situations, the boards of trustees for the transferring and\r\nreceiving districts are actively involved and statutorily authorized to exercise\r\ndiscretion in the transfer process. See S.C. Code Ann. § 59-19-10 (2004) (\"Each\r\nschool district shall be under the management and control of the board of trustees\r\nprovided for in this article, subject to the supervision and orders of the county\r\nboard of education.\"); id. § 59-19-90(9), (10)(b) (authorizing board of trustees to\r\ntransfer and assign pupils as well as prescribe conditions and charges for\r\nattendance in public schools of the school district). The General Assembly has\r\nrecognized the significance of this authority as any infringement constitutes a\r\n\ncriminal offense. See S.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-500 (2004) (\"The trustees of any\r\nschool district who knowingly permit the enrollment of pupils who have not been\r\ntransferred with the consent of the trustees of the district wherein such pupils\r\nreside shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall pay a fine not\r\nexceeding twenty-five dollars or be imprisoned not more than thirty days.\"\r\n(emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       Because a receiving school district incurs expenses for educating a non-\r\nresident student, the General Assembly has enacted general laws to compensate the\r\ndistrict for these expenses. Specifically, section 59-63-4805 provides for the\r\n\r\n\r\n5   Section 59-63-480 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n               If school children in one county reside closer to schools in an\r\n        adjacent county, they may attend such schools upon the school\r\n        authorities of the county of their residence arranging with the school\r\n        officials of the adjacent county for such admission and upon payment\r\n        of appropriate charges as herein authorized. The board of trustees in\r\n        the school district in which the pupils reside shall make written\r\n        application through its county board of education to the board of\r\n        trustees of the district in which the school is located for the admission\r\n        of such children, giving full information as to ages, residence and\r\n        school attainment, and the board of trustees in the school district,\r\n        agreeing to accept such pupils, shall give a written statement of\r\n        agreement. Upon receipt of such application the board of trustees of\r\n        the school and its county board of education shall determine the\r\n        monthly per pupil cost of all overhead expenses of the school, which\r\n        will include all expenses of the school not paid by the State. Upon\r\n        proper arrangement being made for the payment monthly of such\r\n        overhead per pupil cost for each such child the same shall be admitted\r\n        to the schools of the adjacent county.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-480 (2004) (emphasis added).\r\n\ndetermination of a monthly per pupil cost and section 59-63-456 outlines a method\r\nfor the calculation and payment of tuition to the non-resident district. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. §§ 59-63-45, 59-63-480 (2004).\r\n\r\n       As evident by its text, section 59-63-45 requires that: (1) the person\r\nresponsible for educating the non-resident child, presumably his or her parent, to\r\npay tuition to the receiving school district; (2) the amount of tuition, which may be\r\nwaived in whole or in part by the receiving district, be calculated pursuant to an\r\nidentified formula; and (3) the non-resident student be included in the enrollment\r\nof the school in which he or she is attending to determine the allocation of state\r\nfunds to that district for funding public education. Id. § 59-63-45.\r\n\r\n              (2)    Comparison of Act No. 294 with the General Laws\r\n       In comparison with these general laws, Act No. 294 provides a completely\r\ndifferent method for the transfer of Fairfield County resident children to CCSD and\r\nthe calculation and payment of tuition for these students. Act No. 294 also\r\neliminates the statutorily granted authority of FCSD's Board of Trustees with\r\nrespect to the transfer.\r\n\r\n       As codified in section 59-63-485, children in Fairfield County may transfer\r\nto CCSD without any involvement of their resident district. Unlike the general law\r\nof section 59-63-480, the Board of Trustees for Fairfield County no longer makes\r\n\r\n6   Section 59-63-45 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n        Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, a nonresident child\r\n        otherwise meeting the enrollment requirements of this chapter may\r\n        attend a school in a school district which he is otherwise qualified to\r\n        attend if the person responsible for educating the child pays an\r\n        amount equal to the prior year's local revenue per child raised by the\r\n        millage levied for school district operations and debt service reduced\r\n        by school taxes on real property owned by the child paid to the school\r\n        district in which he is enrolled. The district may waive all or a\r\n        portion of the payment required by this section.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-45(A) (2004) (emphasis added).\r\n\nthe written application for the child's transfer nor is involved in reaching an\r\narrangement to compensate CCSD for the costs incurred in educating the non-\r\nresident child. S.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-485(B) (Supp. 2012). Furthermore, in\r\ncontrast to the procedures of section 59-63-45, FCSD rather than a child's parent is\r\nresponsible for payment of tuition in an amount calculated by CCSD. Id. § 59-63-\r\n485(B)(1), (2). Notably, CCSD invoices this amount directly to the Fairfield\r\nCounty Treasurer rather than FCSD. Id. § 59-63-485(C). If the Fairfield County\r\nTreasurer fails to pay the amount invoiced by February 15 of each year, the South\r\nCarolina Department of Education is authorized to pay CCSD using funds\r\notherwise meant for FCSD under the Education Finance Act. Id. In view of these\r\nsignificant distinctions, I find that Act No. 294 conflicts with existing general laws.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, Act No. 294 cannot be deemed a \"special provision\" in a general\r\nlaw as it impermissibly exempts FCSD and CCSD from the operation of the\r\ngeneral law. Although Act No. 294 expressly incorporates section 59-63-480\r\nregarding the transfer to an adjacent district, this reference does not save the\r\nlegislation. Id. § 59-63-485(A), (B), (F). Because Act No. 294 is inconsistent with\r\nthe scheme of the existing general laws, it prevents substantial uniformity of the\r\noperation of general laws throughout the state.\r\n\r\n             (3)    \"Logical Basis and Sound Reason\" for Act No. 294\r\n       Having found Act No. 294 conflicts with the general laws, the question\r\nbecomes whether the General Assembly had a logical basis and sound reason for\r\nenacting the special legislation. I find there is no substantial distinction between\r\nFCSD and other school districts throughout the state to warrant the special\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n       Although the Act states that the \"General Assembly finds that numerous\r\npublic school students reside in Fairfield County School District but are entitled to\r\nattend the schools of Chester County School District pursuant to Section 59-63-\r\n480\" and that the \"General Assembly finds it necessary to provide by law for\r\nuniform arrangements between Fairfield County School District and Chester\r\nCounty School District pertaining to these students,\" I do not believe the\r\nincorporation of \"finds\" is sufficient to escape the constitutional prohibition of\r\nspecial legislation. S.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-485(A) (Supp. 2012) (emphasis\r\nadded). Indeed, if this were the case, the mere inclusion of the word would serve\r\n\nas blanket protection for all special legislation. See Thorne v. Seabrook, 264 S.C.\r\n503, 510, 216 S.E.2d 177, 180 (1975) (\" 'If it must be assumed, merely because the\r\nstatute has been enacted, that the Legislature had information showing that there\r\nwas a necessity for such legislation with reference to the particular locality, it\r\nwould follow that all legislation local in form must be upheld, however general the\r\nnature and subject-matter of such legislation might be. Such a rule of construction\r\nwould be contrary to the mandatory character of the constitutional provisions we\r\nare considering.' \" (quoting Thomas v. Macklen, 186 S.C. 290, 298, 195 S.E. 539,\r\n542-43 (1938)).\r\n\r\n       Instead, the legislative history is devoid of any quantitative data or statistical\r\ncomparison to other school districts to support the General Assembly's \"finding\"\r\nthat the voluntary transfer of students from FCSD to CCSD constitutes a unique or\r\nexigent situation justifying the enactment of special legislation. See Elliott v.\r\nSligh, 233 S.C. 161, 165, 103 S.E.2d 923, 926 (1958) (\"The Legislature may\r\nclassify, for the purpose of legislation, if some intrinsic reason exists why the law\r\nshould operate upon some and not upon all, or should affect some differently from\r\nothers, but this classification must be based upon differences which are either\r\ndefined by the Constitution, or are natural or intrinsic, and which suggest a reason\r\nthat may rationally be held to justify the diversity in the legislation.\" (citation\r\nomitted)); Shillito v. City of Spartanburg, 214 S.C. 11, 20, 51 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1948)\r\n(\"The marks of distinction upon which the classification is founded must be such,\r\nin the nature of things, as will in some reasonable degree, at least, account for or\r\njustify the restriction of the legislation.\").\r\n\r\n        In the absence of supporting evidence, I conclude that neither the history nor\r\nthe number of students choosing to transfer from FCSD to CCSD represents an\r\n\"exigent situation\" in need of special legislation. Until the enactment of Act No.\r\n294, Fairfield County approved these transfers since 1947 and voluntarily\r\nreimbursed CCSD for the resultant expenses since 1973 even though it was never\r\nstatutorily required to do so. Because Fairfield County has the resources and\r\nfacilities to provide free public education for all of its resident children, I discern\r\nno reason why FCSD should now be statutorily required to reimburse CCSD for\r\ncontinued voluntary transfers as the general laws are sufficient to govern the\r\ntransfer of Fairfield County resident children to CCSD.\r\n\n       The majority reaches the opposite conclusion because it essentially requires\r\nFCSD to affirmatively prove a negative proposition, i.e., the General Assembly\r\nhad neither a logical basis nor sound reason for enacting Act No. 294.7 The only\r\nway FCSD can satisfy this burden is to refute the reasons advanced by the General\r\nAssembly for enacting the special legislation. Thus, in order to establish the\r\nconstitutional invalidity of Act No. 294, FCSD must attack the plain language of\r\nAct No. 294 and the legislative history. As discussed, FCSD has successfully\r\nshown that neither the historical agreement8 between FCSD and CCSD nor the\r\nnumber of Mitford students choosing to attend school in CCSD represents a sound\r\nbasis or reason for resorting to such special legislation. Consequently, I would\r\nhold that Act No. 294 is unconstitutional special legislation because its repugnance\r\nto section 34 of Article III is clear beyond a reasonable doubt. See Thomas v.\r\nMacklen, 186 S.C. 290, 301, 195 S.E. 539, 543-44 (1938) (\"A mere classification\r\nfor the purpose of legislation, without regard to such necessity, is simply special\r\nlegislation of the most pernicious character, and is condemned by the constitution.\"\r\n(citation omitted)).            II.    Conclusion\r\n\r\n       I recognize that due deference is given to the General Assembly to address\r\nthe individualized education needs of each school district; however, this deference\r\nis not limitless. The instant case presents such a scenario as Act No. 294 goes\r\n\r\n\r\n7 Specifically, the majority notes that \"FCSD, as the party challenging the\r\nlegislation, is the party required to present such a quantitative or statistical\r\ncomparison to other school districts so as to demonstrate the absence of an exigent\r\ncircumstance.\" However, the majority fails to acknowledge that it is impossible to\r\noffer evidence of a fact that does not exist, i.e. the absence of an exigent\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n8  The majority accepts the longstanding agreement between the districts as support\r\nfor the special legislation on the ground it met the \"exigencies\" of the particular\r\nsituation. I cannot do so as the impetus for this agreement was to address\r\ndesegregation in 1970, which was no longer a concern when the General Assembly\r\nenacted Act No. 294 in 2010.\r\n\nbeyond the funding needs of a particular school district. Act No. 294 conflicts\r\nwith general law regarding every aspect of the transfer process despite the lack of\r\nevidence that FCSD differs from any other district of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n       Although I am not unsympathetic to the plight of Mitford students who\r\nchoose to attend school in CCSD, there are general laws in place to allow their\r\ncontinued attendance in CCSD. Moreover, if CCSD is genuinely concerned with\r\ntheir continued attendance, it may: (1) waive all or part of the tuition pursuant to\r\nsection 59-63-45, or (2) petition the county board of education to adjudicate and\r\neffectuate the transfer of Mitford students to CCSD. See S.C. Code Ann. § 59-63-\r\n510 (2004) (\"When a transfer of pupils from one district to another is sought and\r\nthe trustees of the latter district unreasonably or capriciously withhold their\r\nconsent, the county board of education of the county in which the districts are\r\nlocated shall have the right, after hearing, to make the transfer, but only on\r\ncondition that each pupil so transferred pay semiannually, in advance, if financially\r\nable to do so in the opinion of the board of trustees, as tuition, an amount not less\r\nthan the per capita expenditure from the special tax for operating the school to\r\nwhich the pupil is to be transferred, together with all other charges paid by patrons\r\nof such district for any special course or courses.\").\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, I would declare Act No. 294 unconstitutional and,\r\nas a result, reverse the order of the circuit court.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27418","title":"State v.

Ramsey, 398 S.C. 275, 727 S.E.2d 429 (Ct. App. 2012),\r\naffirming the dismissal of a criminal domestic violence (CDV) charge against\r\nJames Ramsey on the ground that the magistrate lacked authority to hear the case.\r\nSpecifically, the court found the crime was not committed \"in the presence of a law\r\nenforcement officer\" as required by Section 56-7-15(A) of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2006), amended by section 56-7-15 (A) (Supp. 2013). We affirm.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n      On February 18, 2006, Deputy Chris Farrell responded to a domestic call at\r\nthe home of Ramsey's estranged wife (Wife). Farrell interviewed both parties and\r\nnoticed a bruise on Wife's hand, which she indicated was the result of Ramsey\r\nattempting to grab a phone from her. Based on his observations, Deputy Farrell\r\nissued Ramsey a uniform traffic ticket for CDV.1\r\n\r\n       Ramsey moved to dismiss the charges for lack of jurisdiction. He argued\r\nthat because the CDV was not committed in the presence of the officer, Deputy\r\nFarrell could not issue him a uniform traffic ticket under section 56-7-15(A), and\r\nabsent a valid uniform traffic ticket, the magistrate lacked authority to hear the\r\ncase. The magistrate agreed and dismissed the charges. The circuit court affirmed\r\nthe dismissal on the alternative basis that only offenses listed under Section 56-7-\r\n10 of the South Carolina Code (2006), amended by 56-7-10 (Supp. 2013), allowed\r\nfor prosecution solely based on a uniform traffic ticket and at the time the alleged\r\ncrime was committed, CDV was not listed in section 56-7-10. Therefore, the\r\ncircuit court concluded the magistrate did not have jurisdiction to hear the CDV\r\ncharge until an arrest warrant was issued.\r\n\r\n      The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal. Although the court disagreed\r\nwith the circuit court's conclusion that CDV could never be prosecuted in\r\nmagistrate court absent an arrest warrant, it found that pursuant to section 56-7-15,\r\nan officer could only issue a uniform traffic ticket for CDV if the crime was\r\ncommitted in his presence. Ramsey, 398 S.C. at 280, 727 S.E.2d at 432. Because\r\nDeputy Farrell did not see the crime take place, but arrived on the scene after the\r\n\r\n1 Ramsey was also arrested for burglary at the scene, but that charge was\r\ndismissed.\r\n\nfact, the court held the uniform traffic ticket was invalid and the charges were\r\nproperly dismissed. Id. at 283, 727 S.E.2d at 433. This Court granted certiorari to\r\nreview the court of appeals' opinion.\r\n\r\n                               ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n      Did the court of appeals err in affirming the dismissal of Ramsey's CDV\r\ncharge because the offense did not occur in the presence of the officer?\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       \"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\nintent of the legislature.\" Charleston Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. State Budget & Control\r\nBd., 313 S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993). The text of a statute is considered the\r\nbest evidence of the legislative intent or will, and the courts are bound to give\r\neffect to the expressed intent of the legislature. Grier v. AMISUB of S.C., Inc., 397\r\nS.C. 532, 535, 725 S.E.2d 693, 695 (2012). \"Where the statute's language is plain\r\nand unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory\r\ninterpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another\r\nmeaning.\" Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n      The State argues the court of appeals erred in holding that under these\r\ncircumstances, a uniform traffic ticket could not be validly issued pursuant to\r\nsection 56-7-15(A). We disagree.\r\n\r\n        We begin our analysis, as we must, with the plain language. Pursuant to\r\nSection 22-3-710 of the South Carolina Code (2007): \"All proceedings before\r\nmagistrates in criminal cases shall be commenced on information under oath,\r\nplainly and substantially setting forth the offense charged, upon which, and only\r\nwhich, shall a warrant of arrest issue.\" Section 56-7-10 provides an exception to\r\nthe warrant requirement by allowing the issuance of a uniform traffic ticket to\r\ninitiate proceedings before the magistrate for specified offenses. At the time of the\r\nincident, the list of specified offenses did not include CDV. However, section 56-\r\n7-15(A) provided: \"The uniform traffic ticket . . . may be used by law enforcement\r\nofficers to arrest a person for an offense committed in the presence of a law\r\nenforcement officer if the punishment is within the jurisdiction of magistrate's court\r\nand municipal court.\" (emphasis added).\r\n\n       The text of the statute explicitly authorizes use of a uniform traffic ticket in\r\ncircumstances where the offense was \"committed in the presence of a law\r\nenforcement officer.\" Although the State asks us to construe \"in the presence\" to\r\ninclude crimes that were freshly committed, we perceive no ambiguity in the\r\nlanguage that would allow us to accept such a broad construction. The statute\r\nplainly states the offense must be committed in the presence of the officer. This\r\nCourt has no authority to impose another meaning where the legislative language is\r\nclear. Nevertheless, the State argues there is precedent supporting the proposition\r\nthat \"in the presence\" should be interpreted expansively so as to include freshly\r\ncommitted crimes. The State relies on State v. Martin, 275 S.C. 141, 268 S.E.2d\r\n105 (1980), where the Court considered the legality of a warrantless arrest for\r\noperating a vehicle under the influence when the officer did not witness the\r\ndefendant driving the vehicle, but arrived at the scene after an accident. In its\r\nanalysis, the Court observed that: \"It is the law of this State that an officer cannot\r\narrest one charged with a misdemeanor, not committed in his presence, without a\r\nproper warrant . . .\" Id. at 144, 268 S.E.2d at 107 (quoting Mims, 275 at 48, 208\r\nS.E.2d at 289). However, the Court found this principle was qualified by Section\r\n23-13-60 of the South Carolina Code (2013), which allows an arrest without a\r\nwarrant for \"any suspected freshly committed crime.\" Id. at 145, 268 S.E.2d at\r\n107. The Court therefore harmonized these two distinct concepts and held \"while\r\ngenerally an officer cannot arrest, without a warrant, for a misdemeanor not\r\ncommitted in his presence, an officer can arrest for a misdemeanor when the facts\r\nand circumstances observed by the officer give him probable cause to believe that\r\na crime has been freshly committed.\" Id. at 145–146, 268 S.E.2d at 107. Although\r\nthe facts similarly involved a freshly committed offense, the resolution in Martin\r\nrelied on a statute that specifically allowed warrantless arrests for \"freshly\r\ncommitted\" crimes, rather than ones committed in the presence of the officer. The\r\ncase unequivocally indicates that the Court regards these as two distinct concepts.\r\n\r\n        Furthermore, use of the term \"freshly committed\" in section 23-13-60\r\nillustrates the legislature knows how to draft a statute extending an officer's\r\nauthority to freshly committed crimes. See also S.C. Code Ann. § 16-25-70 (2003)\r\n(authorizing officers to effectuate warrantless arrests in suspected cases of\r\ndomestic violence where the officer \"has probable cause to believe that the person\r\nis committing or has freshly committed\" an act of criminal domestic violence, even\r\nif \"the act did not take place in the presence of the officer\"). The legislature could\r\n\nhave employed this phraseology when enacting section 56-7-15, but it did not and\r\nwe must give such omission effect. See 82 C.J.S. Statutes § 478 (2014) (\"[W]here\r\na statute contains a given provision, the omission of such a provision from a\r\nsimilar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different\r\nintention has existed.\").\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, the State entreats us to accept the reasoning of an Attorney\r\nGeneral's opinion that concludes under section 56-7-15(A), \"So long as the officer\r\nhas probable cause to believe that the offense of criminal domestic violence has\r\nbeen freshly committed, the officer may make the charge by way of the Uniform\r\nTraffic Ticket and such ticket bestows jurisdiction . . . .\" 2003 WL 22862788 at *4\r\n(S.C.A.G. Nov. 13, 2003). It is well settled that although it may be persuasive\r\nauthority, an Attorney General's opinion is not binding on this Court, and because\r\nwe disagree with the reasoning, we decline to adopt it. See Charleston Cnty. Sch.\r\nDist. v. Harrell, 393 S.C. 552, 560–61, 713 S.E.2d 604, 609 (2011) (\"Attorney\r\nGeneral opinions, while persuasive, are not binding upon this Court.\").\r\n\r\n       Specifically, the Attorney General's opinion relies on cases we deem\r\ninapposite, Martin and State v. Biehl, 271 S.C. 201, 246 S.E.2d 859 (1978). As\r\ndiscussed supra, Martin does not support the proposition that \"in the presence\"\r\nencompasses crimes that are freshly committed. In Biehl, the Court addressed the\r\nscope of section 56-7-10, which generally allows for the issuance of uniform traffic\r\ntickets for listed offenses. 271 S.C. at 203, 246 S.E.2d at 860. That statute\r\ncontains no limiting language as to when a ticket can be issued. The Court\r\ntherefore found:\r\n\r\n      While we do not hold that an officer may arrest for a misdemeanor not\r\n      committed within his presence, we do hold that the issuance of a\r\n      uniform traffic ticket vests jurisdiction in the traffic court, even\r\n      though the officer may not have personally seen the accused person\r\n      commit the offense with which he is charged.\r\n\r\nId. at 204, 246 S.E.2d at 860. Subsequent to the Biehl decision, the legislature\r\nenacted section 56-7-15 and specifically included the limiting language that a\r\nuniform traffic ticket can be utilized pursuant to that statute where a crime was\r\ncommitted in the presence of the officer. We find this inclusion evinces the South\r\n\nCarolina General Assembly's intent that circumstances where an officer can issue a\r\nuniform traffic ticket under section 56-7-10 are distinct from those under section\r\n56-7-15, and Biehl's holding is inapplicable to our analysis.\r\n\r\n       However, the State reasons that because the General Assembly did not\r\namend section 56-7-15(A) in response to the Attorney General's opinion, it must\r\nagree with the result. The State is correct that the Court has accorded some\r\nsignificance to the inaction of the General Assembly in light of an opinion by the\r\nAttorney General. See Calhoun Life Ins. Co. v. Gambrell, 245 S.C. 406, 414, 140\r\nS.E.2d 774, 778 (1965) (noting that in \"concluding that [the Insurance Commission\r\nhas no power to regulate certain rates and commissions], a fact of particular\r\nimportance is that the legislature has not seen fit to take any action subsequent to\r\nthe opinion of the Attorney General [reaching the same conclusion.]\"). However,\r\nlegislative inaction cannot legitimize a flawed analysis nor does it alter our\r\nobligation to rely on the plain language of a statute.\r\n\r\n       We therefore find unavailing the State's arguments that we should look\r\nbeyond the plain language of the statute in interpreting its scope. In drafting\r\nsection 56-7-15, the General Assembly chose to confine the use of uniform traffic\r\ntickets to instances where an offense is committed in the presence of a law\r\nenforcement officer. Because there is no contention Deputy Farrell witnessed the\r\nincident, the uniform traffic ticket could not be used to initiate proceedings in\r\nmagistrate court.                CONCLUSION\r\n      For the aforementioned reasons, we hold that at the time of the alleged\r\ncrime, section 56-7-15 required an officer to be present during the commission of a\r\ncrime to validly issue a uniform traffic ticket. Therefore, the magistrate properly\r\ndismissed the CDV charge. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals' opinion.2\r\n\r\n\r\n2 However, we clarify that the statute at issue has been revised. As of June 13,\r\n2013, section 56-7-15(A) provides: \"The uniform traffic ticket . . . may be used by\r\nlaw enforcement officers to arrest a person for an offense that has been freshly\r\ncommitted or is committed in the presence of a law enforcement officer if the\r\npunishment is within the jurisdiction of magistrates court and municipal court.\"\r\n(emphasis added). Effective the same day, section 56-7-10(A) was amended to\r\nspecifically include CDV first and second as offenses subject to the uniform traffic\r\n\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nticket provisions. Additionally, section 56-7-10(B) was amended to provide: \"In\r\naddition to the offenses contained in subsection (A), a uniform traffic ticket may be\r\nused in an arrest for a misdemeanor offense within the jurisdiction of magistrates\r\ncourt that has been freshly committed or is committed in the presence of a law\r\nenforcement officer.\" (emphasis added). Accordingly, we recognize this opinion\r\nhas been abrogated and its holding applies only to incidents occurring prior to June\r\n13, 2013.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27419","title":"Perry v.

Lindemann, of Davidson & Lindemann, P.A.,\r\n            of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n      JUSTICE HEARN: The central issue in this case is whether autopsy\r\nreports are \"medical records\" under Section 30-4-20(c) of the South Carolina Code\r\n(2007), and therefore exempt from disclosure under the South Carolina Freedom of\r\nInformation Act, Title 30, Chapter 4 of the South Carolina Code (the FOIA). The\r\nappellants brought a declaratory judgment action under the FOIA requesting\r\n\nproduction of an autopsy report from a coroner. The circuit court granted\r\nsummary judgment in favor of the coroner, finding the records were exempt from\r\ndisclosure as medical records. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       Joe Perry, a reporter for The Item, a newspaper, sent a FOIA request to\r\nHarvin Bullock, the Sumter County Coroner, for the report of the autopsy\r\nperformed on Aaron Leon Jacobs.1 Sumter County denied Perry's request on the\r\nbasis that pursuant to the FOIA, the autopsy report is a \"medical record\" and is\r\ntherefore by definition not a public record subject to disclosure.\r\n\r\n       Perry, along with Osteen Publishing Company, Inc. (collectively,\r\nAppellants), filed this declaratory judgment action against Bullock in his official\r\ncapacity as Sumter County Coroner. Appellants sought injunctive relief, alleging\r\nthe autopsy report is not a medical record and therefore must be disclosed pursuant\r\nto the FOIA. Appellants therefore requested production of the records and\r\nattorney's fees.\r\n\r\n      Bullock answered, asserting the records are exempt from the FOIA as\r\nmedical records. He also asserted the records are subject to the authorization and\r\nconsent provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of\r\n1996, Pub. L. 104–191, 110 Stat. 1936 (HIPAA) and thus any state law requiring\r\ndisclosure of the autopsy report would be preempted by HIPAA.\r\n\r\n      The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. In support of his\r\nmotion, Bullock submitted an affidavit of Dr. Janice Ross, the pathologist who\r\nperformed the autopsy, which indicated she considered the report to be a medical\r\nrecord. Additionally, Bullock argued the issue was moot because Perry received\r\nthe autopsy reports from another source.2 Appellants objected to the court's\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Jacobs was shot and killed by police officers.\r\n2 In an article Perry wrote after the inception of this suit, he referenced \"an autopsy\r\nreport from Newberry Pathology Associates\" which he received from the South\r\nCarolina State Law Enforcement Division. However, in his response to Bullock's\r\nrequests for admission, Perry stated he \"received a necropsy report relating to an\r\nautopsy on the body of 'Arron Jacobs'\" and that although he believed this was the\r\n\nconsideration of Dr. Ross's affidavit, arguing that whether the autopsy report was a\r\nmedical record within the meaning of the FOIA was a question of law and an\r\nexpert witness is not competent to opine on matters of law.\r\n\r\n       After a hearing on the motions and an in camera review of the report, the\r\ncircuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Bullock, holding that autopsy\r\nreports are medical records and therefore exempt from the FOIA's disclosure\r\nrequirements.                  ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n\r\n     Did the circuit court err in holding the autopsy report is a medical record\r\nexempt from the FOIA's disclosure requirements?\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      Appellants argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in\r\nfavor of Bullock by finding the autopsy report is a medical record under section\r\n30-4-20(c). We disagree.\r\n\r\n      Summary judgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, depositions,\r\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\r\nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\n\"Determining the proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law, and this\r\nCourt reviews questions of law de novo.\" Town of Summerville v. City of N.\r\nCharleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008).\r\n\r\n       \"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\nlegislative intent whenever possible.\" State v. Baucom, 340 S.C. 339, 342, 531\r\nS.E.2d 922, 923 (2000). The plain language of a statute is considered the best\r\nevidence of the legislature's intent. Grier v. AMISUB of S.C., Inc., 397 S.C. 532,\r\n538, 725 S.E.2d 693, 697 (2012). When interpreting an undefined statutory term,\r\nthe Court must look to its usual and customary meaning. Strother v. Lexington\r\nCnty. Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 (1998).\r\n\r\nreport he requested from Bullock, he had \"not had the opportunity to compare\r\n[them].\"\r\n\n       The FOIA was enacted based on the General Assembly's finding \"that it is\r\nvital in a democratic society that public business be performed in an open and\r\npublic manner so that citizens shall be advised of the performance of public\r\nofficials and of the decisions that are reached in public activity and in the\r\nformulation of public policy.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-15 (2007). Accordingly, the\r\nFOIA's essential purpose is to protect the public from secret government activity.\r\nBellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C. 291, 295, 408 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1991). Because the\r\nFOIA is remedial in nature, it should be liberally construed to carry out the purpose\r\nmandated by the legislature. Campbell v. Marion Cnty. Hosp. Dist., 354 S.C. 274,\r\n281, 580 S.E.2d 163, 166 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n\r\n      The FOIA requires public bodies to disclose public records upon request and\r\ndefines public records as \"all books, papers, maps, photographs, cards, tapes,\r\nrecordings, or other documentary materials regardless of physical form or\r\ncharacteristics prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by a public\r\nbody.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-20. However, \"[r]ecords such as . . . medical\r\nrecords . . . and other records which by law are required to be closed to the public\r\nare not considered to be made open to the public under the provisions of [the\r\nFOIA] . . . . Id.\r\n\r\n       The phrase \"medical records\" is not defined within the statute and therefore,\r\nwe turn to its normal and customary meaning. See, e.g., Branch v. City of Myrtle\r\nBeach, 340 S.C. 405, 409–10, 532 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2000) (\"When faced with an\r\nundefined statutory term, the Court must interpret the term in accord with its usual\r\nand customary meaning.\"). Merriam-Webster defines a medical record as \"a\r\nrecord of a patient's medical information (as medical history, care or treatments\r\nreceived, test results, diagnoses, and medications taken).\" Merriam-Webster\r\nOnline, http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/medical%20records.             Thus,\r\nplainly stated, medical records are those records containing medical information.\r\n\r\n      We find autopsy reports fit neatly within that general understanding of\r\nmedical records. Section 17-5-5(1) of the South Carolina Code (2014) defines an\r\nautopsy as \"the dissection of a dead body and the removal and examination of\r\nbone, tissue, organs, and foreign objects for the purpose of determining the cause\r\nof death and manner of death.\" Although the objective of an autopsy is to\r\ndetermine the cause of death, as the statute indicates, the actual examination is\r\ncomprehensive. Thus, the medical information gained from the autopsy and\r\n\nindicated in the report is not confined to how the decedent died. Instead, an\r\nautopsy, which is performed by a medical doctor, is a thorough and invasive\r\ninquiry into the body of the decedent which reveals extensive medical information,\r\nsuch as the presence of any diseases or medications and any evidence of treatments\r\nreceived, regardless of whether that information pertained to the cause of death.\r\nAccordingly, we find an autopsy report falls within the definition of a medical\r\nrecord as that term is commonly understood.\r\n\r\n       The reference to \"medical records\" in other portions of the Code supports\r\nthat conclusion by indicating the General Assembly considered autopsy reports to\r\nbe included within that term. Section 17-5-120 of the South Carolina Code (2014),\r\nentitled \"Availability of medical records to coroner of another state,\" allows for\r\n\"Records, papers, or reports concerning the death of a person on file at any . . .\r\nmedical facility in this State are available to a coroner of another state . . . .\"\r\n(emphasis added). The title refers to \"medical records\" and the statute only\r\nmentions reports about the death of an individual, which encompasses autopsy\r\nreports. See Garner v. Houck, 312 S.C. 481, 486, 435 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1993)\r\n(holding the title of a statute and heading of a section can be used to clarify\r\nambiguity or doubt in a statute provided the interpretation does not undo or limit\r\nthe plain meaning of the text). Section 17-5-120 also specifically notes: \"The\r\nrelease of these records to the coroner of another state is not prohibited by [the\r\nFOIA] or any other provision of law.\" The reference to the FOIA as a law of\r\nexclusion indicates the General Assembly assumed the FOIA barred dissemination\r\nof these types of reports.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, the Attorney General's office has long held the opinion that\r\nautopsy reports are medical records and exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.\r\nSee 2011 WL 782314 (S.C.A.G. Feb. 23, 2011) (\"[T]his Office has consistently\r\nopined that autopsy records, including photographs, are confidential under State\r\nlaw.\"); 1981 WL 96613 (S.C.A.G. Oct. 27, 1981) (\"The details of an autopsy\r\nreport are of such an intimate, personal nature concerning vivid medical allusions\r\nto parts of the human body, their description and indications of prior history. A\r\nreport of this nature constitutes a medical record which is not available for public\r\nconsumption.\").\r\n\r\n       Appellants contend a similar argument was made and rejected with regard to\r\nthe disclosure of death certificates in Society of Professional Journalists v. Sexton,\r\n283 S.C. 563, 324 S.E.2d 313 (1984). There, this Court held death certificates are\r\n\nnot medical records simply because they contain medical information.\r\nSpecifically, the Court found that although \"death certificates contain a medical\r\ncertification of the cause of death[, ] they are not medical records in the normal\r\nsense but are statements of conclusion by persons required by law to make such\r\nfindings after the death of a citizen of the state.\" Id. at 566, 324 S.E.2d at 314. We\r\nfind the reasoning of Sexton inapplicable here. A death certificate includes no\r\nmore than the cause of death, if known. In contrast an autopsy is a comprehensive\r\nmedical examination of a body designed to reveal not only the cause of death, but\r\nalso the decedent's general medical condition at the time of death including\r\ninformation unrelated to the cause of death. This is the type of information that\r\nwould necessarily be contained in medical records when a person is alive. We\r\ndecline to allow a person's death to change the nature of the record into one subject\r\nto disclosure under the FOIA.\r\n\r\n       Appellants also rely on the canon of statutory construction expression unius\r\nest exclusio alterus to support their contention that the legislature did not intend to\r\nexempt autopsy reports as medical records. Specifically, Appellants point to\r\nSection 30-4-40(a)(18) of the South Carolina Code (2007) which provides: \"A\r\npublic body may but is not required to exempt from disclosure . . . [p]hotographs,\r\nvideos, and other visual images, and audio recordings of and related to the\r\nperformance of an autopsy . . . .\" Appellants argue that if autopsy reports are\r\nmedical records, this specific exemption would be unnecessary because these\r\nautopsy related materials would already be excluded.\r\n\r\n       We disagree. The language of section 30-4-40(a)(18) refers to items \"of or\r\nrelating to the performance of an autopsy,\" not items that are a part of an autopsy\r\nreport. Autopsy reports contain specific and detailed medical information, but\r\nseparate pictures or video of the procedure, while possibly sensational or salacious,\r\ndo not make specific medical conclusions regarding the decedent. Accordingly,\r\nwe find this statute compliments the exclusion of autopsy reports under the FOIA.\r\nIt further limits access to autopsy information by allowing public bodies to also\r\ndecline to disclose related images and audio recordings. We therefore find this\r\nstatute has no bearing on the disclosure of the actual autopsy report.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      While cognizant of our obligation to strictly construe the FOIA in favor of\r\ndisclosure, we are nevertheless compelled here by the plain meaning of the\r\n\nstatutory term to conclude that an autopsy report is exempt from the FOIA's\r\ndisclosure requirement. Although there may be policy concerns militating against\r\nthis result, that is a matter for the legislature and not for this Court. Accordingly,\r\nwe affirm the circuit court and hold autopsy reports are excluded from disclosure\r\nunder the FOIA as medical records.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent because, in my opinion, an\r\nautopsy report is not a medical record within the meaning of the South Carolina\r\nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), S.C. Code Ann. §§ 30-4-10 et seq. (2007 and\r\nSupp. 2013). I would hold that such a report is subject to disclosure as provided in\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 17-5-280 (2014), and would therefore reverse the circuit court's\r\norder and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\r\nSection 30-4-20(b) (2014) provides that \"records which by law are required to be\r\nclosed to the public are not made open to the public under [FOIA] . . . .\" The\r\ninitial question, then, is whether autopsy reports are required by law to be closed to\r\nthe public. In my opinion, they are not closed records, although the right to access\r\nthem is limited by the terms of § 17-5-280.\r\n\r\nChapter 5 of Title 17 of the South Carolina Code regulates \"Coroners and Medical\r\nExaminers.\" Under this chapter, autopsy is a defined term:\r\n\r\n             (1) \"Autopsy\" means the dissection of a dead body and the\r\n             removal and examination of bone, tissue, organs, and foreign\r\n             objects for the purpose of determining the cause of death and\r\n             manner of death.\r\n\r\n             Section 17-5-5(1) (2014).\r\n\r\nSection 17-5-280 provides that autopsy reports be made available to prosecutors\r\nand law enforcement agents if \"necessary for the performance of [their] official\r\nduties.\" Further, § 17-5-280 provides that an autopsy report \"must be furnished\r\nupon request to any party to whom the cause of death is a material issue.\"\r\n(emphasis supplied). In my view, this statute3 demonstrates that autopsy records\r\nare not required by law to be closed to the public under FOIA, and also establishes\r\nthe legal standard for release of autopsy reports to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n While this statute specifically refers to medical examiners, it is evident that in\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\ncounties such as Sumter the coroner is the person responsible for maintaining\r\nautopsy records.\r\n\nIn my opinion, the majority errs when it affirms the circuit court's holding that an\r\nautopsy report is a medical record4 and therefore absolutely exempt from\r\ndisclosure under FOIA. Nonetheless, the majority is rightly concerned with the\r\npublic dissemination of potentially exempt information that may be contained in an\r\nautopsy report, such as that obtained from the decedent's medical records. Should\r\nthe autopsy report contain material which is not subject to disclosure, then the\r\ncoroner or medical examiner to whom the FOIA request is made may redact that\r\ninformation as provided by § 30-4-40(b) (2007).\r\n\r\nI respectfully dissent, and would reverse and remand for further proceedings\r\nconsistent with the standard for dissemination of autopsy reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The \"Coroners and Medical Examiners\" chapter treats medical records in a\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nseparate statute and creates an extremely limited exception allowing these\r\notherwise exempt documents to be made available to out-of-state coroners.

McRoy Shelley, III, of Rogers Townsend &\r\n             Thomas, PC, of Columbia, for Third-Party Defendant.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: We certified the following question from the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of South Carolina:\r\n\r\n      Does the rule that a contract of indemnity will not be construed to\r\n      indemnify the indemnitee against losses resulting from its own\r\n      negligent acts, unless such intention is expressed in clear and\r\n      unequivocal terms, apply when the indemnitee seeks contractual\r\n      indemnification for costs and expenses resulting in part from its own\r\n      strict liability acts?\r\n\r\nIn the context of the underlying claim in federal court, we answer the certified\r\nquestion, \"no.\"                           I.\r\n\r\nCentral to this certified question is the operation of a fertilizer-manufacturing site\r\n(Site) in Charleston, South Carolina, that spanned approximately forty-three acres,\r\nand was owned at various times by the parties. In 1906, Ross Development Corp.1\r\npurchased the Site and operated a fertilizer manufacturing facility until 1966. The\r\nfertilizer manufacturing process led to arsenic, lead, and acid contamination at the\r\nSite.\r\n\r\nIn 1966, Ross sold the Site to PCS Nitrogen, Inc.2 The purchase agreement\r\nincluded an indemnity provision, which stated: \"[Ross] agrees to indemnify and\r\n1Ross Development Corp. was formerly known as Planters Fertilizer & Phosphate\r\nCo. (Planters). We refer to Ross and Planters collectively as \"Ross.\"\r\n2PCS Nitrogen, Inc. is the successor-in-interest to Columbia Nitrogen Corp.\r\n(CNC). We refer to PCS and CNC collectively as \"PCS.\"\r\n\nhold harmless [PCS] in respect to all acts, suits, demands, assessments,\r\npr[o]ce[e]dings and cost and expenses resulting from any acts or omission[s] of\r\n[Ross] occurring prior to the closing date . . . .\"\r\n\r\nDuring the approximately twenty years PCS owned the site, it contributed to the\r\nenvironmental contamination by continuing to manufacture fertilizer and\r\ndisturbing the contaminated soil during various demolition activities. In 2003,\r\nAshley II of Charleston, Inc. (Ashley II) purchased 27.62 acres of the Site. Since\r\nthat time, Ashley II has incurred substantial costs in remediating the environmental\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\nIn July 2008, Ashley II filed a complaint against PCS seeking a declaration of joint\r\nand several liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,\r\nCompensation, and Liability Act3 (CERCLA) due to costs of the environmental\r\ncleanup at the Site. PCS asserted federal statutory contribution claims against Ross\r\nand others, contending those named were also liable for environmental cleanup\r\ncosts. Additionally, PCS asserted a third-party indemnification claim against Ross\r\nbased on the indemnity provision in the 1966 purchase agreement, seeking\r\nindemnification for attorney's fees, costs, and litigation expenses incurred in\r\nestablishing that Ross contributed to the contamination.\r\n\r\nAfter a bench trial, the district court found that PCS was liable to Ashley II for\r\nenvironmental cleanup costs and PCS was entitled to indemnification for attorney's\r\nfees and costs from Ross. Following Ross's motion for reconsideration, the district\r\ncourt vacated its indemnification order and certified the above question to this\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601–9675 (2006). \"CERCLA imposes strict liability on all entities\r\nthat have owned or operated 'facilities' at which hazardous substances were\r\n'disposed.'\" Anderson Bros. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 729 F.3d 923, 929\r\n(9th Cir. 2013) (footnote and citations omitted). \"Congress enacted CERCLA 'to\r\npromote the timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites and to ensure that the costs of\r\nsuch cleanup efforts were borne by those responsible for the contamination.'\"\r\nLitgo New Jersey Inc. v. Comm'r N.J. Dep't of Envtl. Prot., 725 F.3d 369, 378 (3d\r\nCir. 2013) (quoting Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. United States, 556 U.S.\r\n599, 602 (2009)).\r\n\n                                          II. \n\r\n\r\nWe have long recognized \"that a contract of indemnity will not be construed to\r\nindemnify the indemnitee against losses resulting from its own negligent acts\r\nunless such intention is expressed in clear and unequivocal terms.\" Laurens\r\nEmergency Med. Specialists, PA v. M.S. Baily & Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. 104, 111,\r\n584 S.E.2d 375, 379 (2003) (quotations and citation omitted). In this case, we are\r\nasked whether this \"negligence rule\" also bars indemnification in cases where the\r\nliability is strict and not fault-based. Based on the public policy underlying the\r\nnegligence rule, the nature of CERCLA liability, and our law respecting the\r\nfreedom of parties to contract, we would decline to extend the negligence rule to\r\nbar indemnification in this case.         A.\r\n\r\nThe policy basis for the negligence rule is simple—barring indemnification when\r\nthe indemnitee is at fault for the damages serves to deter negligent conduct in the\r\nfuture, for the indemnitee will know that the indemnification agreement will not\r\nsave it from liability if it fails to act with due care. Murray v. Texas Co., 172 S.C.\r\n399, 402, 174 S.E. 231, 232 (1934). However, we have declined to apply the\r\nnegligence rule to bar indemnification, even in the context of a negligence action,\r\nwhen application of the rule would have no deterrent value. See S.C. Elec. & Gas\r\nCo. v. Utils. Constr. Co., 244 S.C. 79, 82–90, 135 S.E.2d 613, 614–19 (1964)\r\n(rejecting an independent contractor's attempt to invoke the negligence rule where\r\n\"the only negligence chargeable to the [indemnitee] . . . was the negligence of the\r\n[indemnitor-independent contractor] itself,\" for the application of the negligence\r\nbar to indemnification under the circumstances would not further the purpose of\r\nthe negligence rule barring indemnification).\r\n\r\nWe find that barring indemnification in this case would not serve the deterrent\r\npurpose of the negligence rule. The nature of CERCLA liability is fundamentally\r\nnot a fault-based determination. See United States v. Monsanto Co., 858 F.2d 160,\r\n168 (4th Cir. 1988) (\"The traditional elements of tort culpability . . . simply are\r\nabsent from [CERCLA]. The plain language . . . extends liability to owners of\r\nwaste facilities regardless of their degree of participation in the subsequent\r\ndisposal of hazardous waste.\"). Of course, relative fault does factor into the\r\nultimate liability calculus in the form of CERCLA's contribution provision. See 42\r\nU.S.C. § 9613(f) (2006) (authorizing one potentially responsible party to sue\r\nanother for equitable contribution). Contribution, however, is merely a way to\r\n\nequitably apportion costs after liability has been established. Application of the\r\nnegligence rule would not serve to deter liability in the first instance because\r\nCERCLA liability is not premised on identifying particularized harm caused by\r\ncertain parties, but instead is imposed upon classes of parties based on their status,\r\ntypically as owners of the contaminated premises. Nurad, Inc. v. William E.\r\nHooper & Sons, 966 F.2d 837, 841 (4th Cir. 1992).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the indemnification agreement was limited to any liability attributable\r\nto Ross up to the date of the 1966 closing—there was no prospective, post-1966\r\nclosing liability for which Ross could be responsible under the indemnification\r\nprovision. The agreement did not permit indemnification from Ross for any\r\nliability (by way of negligence, strict liability or otherwise) after the 1966 closing.\r\nWe similarly observe that PCS seeks to enforce the indemnification provision in\r\nstrict accordance with its terms by limiting its claim to fees and costs associated\r\nwith Ross's CERCLA liability incurred because of its ownership and operation of\r\nthe Site prior to the 1966 closing.4 Enforcing the indemnification provision under\r\nthese circumstances in no manner runs afoul of the negligence rule; we would\r\nenforce the agreement.                     B.\r\n\r\nSuch a finding comports with our longstanding regard for parties' freedom to\r\ncontract. See Huckaby v. Confederate Motor Speedway, Inc., 276 S.C. 629, 630,\r\n281 S.E.2d 223, 224 (1981) (\"[P]eople should be free to contract as they choose.\").\r\nWhile the freedom to contract is not without limitation, \"[s]trong policy\r\nconsiderations . . . generally permit business owners to allocate risk amongst\r\n\r\n4 Because PCS does not seek to recover its fees and costs associated with CERCLA\r\nliability attributed to contamination occurring after the 1966 closing, PCS is not\r\nseeking \"contractual indemnification for costs and expenses resulting in part from\r\nits own strict liability acts,\" as the certified question suggests. We acknowledge\r\nthe record before us may be incomplete. If, based on the current record, we have\r\nmisapprehended the scope of PCS's indemnification claim against Ross, we invite\r\na rehearing petition to specifically identify where in the record PCS seeks\r\nindemnification from Ross for any acts or omissions of Ross occurring after the\r\n1966 closing date. The 1966 indemnification agreement, to be sure, does not allow\r\nfor indemnification for any acts or omissions by Ross occurring after the 1966\r\nclosing date. Such result is a function of the clear terms of the indemnification\r\nagreement, not an expansion of the negligence rule.\r\n\nthemselves as they see fit.\" Constable v. Northglenn, LLC, 248 P.3d 714, 718\r\n(Colo. 2011) (citations omitted). An indemnity agreement is an ideal method for\r\nbusinesses to allocate costs and expenses that may arise in future litigation.\r\nIndeed, the parties to the 1966 agreement were sophisticated business entities that\r\nengaged in an arms-length purchase agreement and chose to include an indemnity\r\nprovision in the contract. We find no basis to invoke the negligence rule to trump\r\nthe plain language of the indemnity agreement.5\r\n\r\n                                        III.\r\n\r\nBecause the deterrent purpose underlying the negligence rule would not be served\r\nby its application under these circumstances, we find that the negligence rule does\r\nnot bar indemnification in the underlying CERCLA action. We answer the\r\ncertified question, \"no.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice Eugene C.\r\nGriffith, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 We note the narrow reach of today's holding. Our holding is limited to\r\ndetermining that the negligence rule—which would operate as a bar to enforcement\r\nof the indemnification provision—does not preclude contractual indemnification\r\nunder the facts of this CERCLA action. We make no finding regarding how PCS's\r\nindemnification claim should be resolved, for such a finding is reserved to the\r\ndistrict court. And finally, we do not permanently close the door on the possibility\r\nthat in a different context there may a sound basis for applying the negligence rule\r\noutside of the traditional parameters of a negligence action.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27421","title":"Weik v.

Zelenka, all\r\n            of Columbia, for the Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: We granted a writ of certiorari to review the denial of\r\nJohn Edward Weik's (Weik or Petitioner) application for capital post-conviction\r\nrelief (PCR). Weik argues the PCR court erred in denying relief on a number of\r\n\ngrounds. We reach only the challenge concerning the complete lack of social\r\nhistory mitigation evidence in the sentencing phase. Because of the lack of social\r\nhistory mitigation evidence, we are constrained to reverse and remand for a new\r\nsentencing hearing.                       I.\r\nWeik was convicted of murdering his former girlfriend following an argument over\r\nthe couple's child. Weik confessed to the shooting and cooperated with law\r\nenforcement. There was never any dispute regarding guilt.\r\n\r\nDuring the sentencing phase, the State proceeded on two aggravating\r\ncircumstances—burglary and torture.1 Regarding Weik's mental status, the defense\r\nrelied on three mental health experts, who all of whom testified that Weik suffers\r\nfrom paranoid schizophrenia, including auditory and visual hallucinations, suicidal\r\nideations, and paranoid delusions.2 The defense, however, failed to present readily\r\navailable evidence concerning Weik's chaotic upbringing and dysfunctional family.\r\nIt is the absence of the social history mitigation evidence that compels us, under\r\ncontrolling United States Supreme Court precedents, to grant Weik a new\r\nsentencing hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1  Burglary was asserted because the shooting occurred on the victim's property,\r\nand torture was predicated on the multiple shots the victim sustained.\r\n2 In his statement to police, Weik stated that he heard voices in his head just before\r\nthe shooting, felt as if some physical force kept him from leaving the victim's\r\nhome, and as he shot the victim, he watched it \"from above and the side\" as if his\r\nactions were being played \"on a monitor.\" Specifically, Weik believes he is being\r\ntargeted by federal investigative agencies and that employees of the CIA and the\r\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) drive by his home\r\nmultiple times each day in vehicles equipped with computers that monitor his\r\nwhereabouts and track his activity. Weik is also suspicious of the Masons and was\r\nadamant that he assist counsel in selecting the jury to ensure there were no CIA\r\nagents or Masons selected to serve on his jury. Weik also quietly chanted passages\r\nfrom the Bible throughout his trial, \"so the voices [in his head] would not bother\r\n[him].\"\r\n\n                                         A.\r\n\r\nPre-trial interviews conducted with Weik's relatives, coworkers, and other\r\nacquaintances revealed Weik's childhood was traumatic, filled with emotional and\r\nphysical abuse at the hands of his psychotic father, Russell Weik. Indeed, one\r\nmitigation specialist with forty years of investigative experience described Weik's\r\nfamily as the most dysfunctional family she had ever encountered.\r\n\r\nDespite the wealth of social mitigating information defense investigators\r\ndiscovered about Weik's troubled background, during the penalty phase of the trial,\r\ndefense counsel called only one witness, Weik's youngest sister, Amy, to testify\r\nvery briefly about Petitioner's abusive upbringing. This part of Amy's testimony\r\ncomprises three pages out of a multi-thousand page record. This limited and\r\ngeneral testimony offered nothing in terms of specifics, as Weik's childhood was\r\ndescribed as merely \"rough.\" When Amy was asked to be \"more specific\" about\r\nWeik, she replied, \"the abuse that we suffered, all of us.\" Cursory and nonspecific\r\nreference was made to Weik's father's \"military flashbacks.\" Amy concluded her\r\nscant testimony as to Weik's upbringing and childhood by stating that our \"father\r\nwas always paranoid, abusive, I don't know. Something was wrong with him and I\r\ndon't know exactly what it was.\"\r\n\r\nNo other family members or coworkers were called to testify on Weik's behalf\r\nduring the sentencing phase.3\r\n\r\nThe State countered with expert testimony from two mental health experts who\r\nboth testified Weik did not have schizophrenia, but rather, he suffered from\r\nschizotypal personality disorder. The State's forensic psychologist also testified\r\nthat Weik: (1) was the product of an \"intact\" family; (2) developed normally; (3)\r\ndid not experience any childhood behavioral problems; (4) quit high school in\r\neleventh grade; (5) had an average IQ; and (6) did not suffer from any alcohol or\r\ndrug abuse issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 During the guilt phase, defense counsel called Petitioner's mother. However, her\r\ntestimony regarding Weik's upbringing occurred during an in camera hearing and\r\nwas never heard by the jury. Several other members of Weik's family were present\r\nat trial and willing to testify but were never called by defense counsel.\r\n\nAt the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the jury recommended a sentence of\r\ndeath, which the trial court imposed. Weik's conviction and sentence were\r\naffirmed on direct appeal. State v. Weik, 356 S.C. 76, 587 S.E.2d 683 (2002).\r\n\r\n                                         B.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Weik filed a PCR application claiming, among other things, that trial\r\ncounsel were ineffective for failing to present mitigation evidence relating to his\r\nfamily and social history that was available at the time of his trial. The testimony\r\nelicited during the PCR hearing revealed trial counsel's troubling inattention\r\ntowards preparing for the mitigation phase of trial, despite Petitioner's admission of\r\nguilt from the outset of the case.\r\n\r\nAfter the State served notice of intent to seek the death penalty, attorneys Percy\r\nBeauford4 and Marva Ann Hardee-Thomas5 were appointed to represent Weik in\r\nJuly of 1998. However, it was not until March 1999—a mere eleven weeks prior\r\nto trial—that counsel hired investigator Patti Rickborn6 to begin a mitigation\r\ninvestigation. Rickborn testified that she met with Beauford and Hardee-Thomas\r\nonly once, and during that one meeting, it was \"absolutely clear\" that Hardee-\r\n\r\n4 While Beauford was an experienced criminal lawyer, he had never previously\r\nrepresented a client facing the death penalty or attended any seminars or\r\ncontinuing legal education courses dedicated to capital defense. However,\r\nBeauford testified that he did consult briefly with two experienced, local attorneys\r\nprior to trial.\r\n5Hardee-Thomas is currently suspended from the practice of law. See In re Marva\r\nAnn Hardee-Thomas, 391 S.C. 451, 706 S.E.2d 507 (2011) (citing Rules 1.1\r\n(Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.15 (Safekeeping Property), 8.4(a) (Misconduct),\r\n8.4(d) (Conduct involving dishonesty), and 8.4(e) (Conduct prejudicial to the\r\nadministration of justice)). Hardee-Thomas's disciplinary history also includes a\r\nLetter of Caution without a finding of misconduct and an Admonition citing Rules\r\n1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), and 1.4 (Communication). At the time of\r\nPetitioner's trial, Hardee-Thomas, a contract public defender, had approximately\r\nfour years of felony trial experience and claimed to have been \"third chair\" in one\r\nprevious death penalty case.\r\n6 Rickborn has been a mitigation specialist since 1985, and at the time of Weik's\r\ntrial, she had worked on approximately twenty capital cases.\r\n\nThomas was to be her contact person. According to Rickborn, she made repeated\r\nrequests for Hardee-Thomas to provide her investigative leads, names and contact\r\ninformation for the defense mental health experts, and assistance in obtaining a\r\ncourt order for Weik's father's military mental health records; however, despite\r\nRickborn's persistence, Hardee-Thomas gave only evasive replies, promising to\r\nrespond in the future, or failed to acknowledge Rickborn's requests altogether.\r\n\r\nDespite receiving virtually no guidance from defense counsel, Rickborn, an\r\nexperienced mitigation specialist, began the investigation and was able to provide\r\nHardee-Thomas with a potential witness list for the penalty phase, which included\r\ncontact information for Weik's parents, siblings, and other family members, a list\r\nof places from which to obtain records, as well as detailed investigative interviews\r\nwith Weik's family members that revealed pervasive mental health issues\r\nthroughout the Weik family and that Weik endured severe emotional,\r\npsychological, and physical abuse during his childhood. Rickborn provided all of\r\nthis information to Hardee-Thomas but received no response. 7\r\n\r\nApproximately six or seven weeks after being hired, an exasperated Rickborn\r\nresigned from the defense team. In her resignation letter, 8 Rickborn explained she\r\n7 At the PCR hearing, Petitioner produced a number of letters from Rickborn to\r\ncounsel indicating she needed additional information from counsel. In her letters\r\nto Hardee-Thomas, Rickborn also suggested counsel take certain follow-up steps\r\nand emphasized the importance of family witnesses to provide information about\r\nWeik's childhood and social history due to the lack of corroborating medical and\r\nschool records. Rickborn testified that she provided such direction because\r\nHardee-Thomas \"didn't seem to know what to do with the information I was giving\r\nher.\" Likewise, Jeff Bloom, who was retained by counsel as a jury consultant one\r\nweek prior to trial, testified at the PCR hearing that it was clear from his\r\ninteraction with counsel that they were \"in way over their heads\" and did not\r\nunderstand the mitigation evidence they had or how to use it.\r\n8   In her final letter, Rickborn stated:\r\n\r\n         I have been working on this case six to seven weeks. During this time\r\n         I have asked that certain steps be taken by you as attorneys to assist\r\n         me with preparing the best defense possible for [Weik] should his\r\n         case reach the penalty phase.\r\n\r\n         I have asked that you try to obtain a court order for the client's\r\n\nmedical records. Since it was so late in the case when I became\r\ninvolved I felt this would expedite [the] collection of medical records.\r\nIt would also have allowed me to cover a wide area of medical\r\nfacilities to try to be sure that we had all records of the client's\r\ntreatment for the head injuries that he reported. Since I did not\r\nreceive that I obtained Dorchester County subpoenas and spent a great\r\ndeal of time trying to obtain any records that may exist for the client.\r\n\r\nI have asked that you try to obtain a court order for medical and\r\npsychiatric records for Russell Weik, the client's father. Since these\r\nrecords would be maintained by the Veteran's Hospital, part of the\r\nUnited States Military, I knew that we could not get a copy of these\r\nrecords without a court order. These records could have been\r\nimportant to establish the condition of Russell Weik and substantiate\r\nthe client's siblings['] stories. Even if we presented a court order to\r\nobtain those records today we would probably not get these records\r\nuntil the trial is underway.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nI have documented the memos that I have mailed and faxed to Ms.\r\nHardee-Thomas. I have never gotten a satisfactory response. I was\r\nsending these things to Ms. Hardee-Thomas because Mr. Beauford\r\ntold me, in her presence, that she would be handling the \"paperwork\"\r\non this case. When I have been able to speak with Ms. Hardee-\r\nThomas on the phone she is always in a rush and hangs up before I\r\ncan discuss the case with her.\r\n\r\nI have found reports of emotional, psychological and physical abuse\r\nin the client's family. I have prepared reports and forwarded them to\r\nthe doctors. I have supplied you with a potential witness list. Most of\r\nthem have been contacted.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nAt this time I do not know if I need to resign from this case because I\r\ndo not know if an order was ever approved by the judge for me to\r\nwork on this case. In fact, I took myself off another case to work on\r\n\nwas no longer willing to assist counsel with Petitioner's case because counsel failed\r\nto provide her with investigative leads, repeatedly failed to answer her direct\r\nquestions or otherwise cooperate with her, and failed to provide her a copy of an\r\norder approving payment for her services.9 In her PCR testimony, Rickborn stated\r\nshe was \"completely frustrated\" because \"I was getting no response from them. I\r\nmean, as far as I was concerned, I wasn't working with anybody. There was\r\nnobody to work with.\"\r\n\r\nAbout a week later, counsel contacted a different mitigation investigator, Scott\r\nParker, to complete the investigation Rickborn had begun. Due to the incomplete\r\nstatus of the investigation, Parker requested two months' additional time to prepare,\r\nand as a result the defense team moved for a continuance.\r\n\r\nDuring the pre-trial hearing on the continuance motion, Beauford explained that\r\nRickborn left the defense team and requested that the trial be continued for a\r\nperiod of two weeks to allow a substitute investigator time to obtain certain\r\nmedical records.10 Beauford was not candid with the trial judge about the true\r\nreason for Rickborn's departure, opting to invoke \"communication problems\" as\r\nthe reason for her departure. When the trial judge directly asked counsel to explain\r\nwhy Rickborn quit, counsel stated, \"I would think communication problems is a\r\nbroad area we could use on the record.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial judge then stated:\r\n\r\n      If she's got a good reason to leave, I need to know it really on the\r\n      record. In other words, if it's prejudicial to your client that she has\r\n      jumped ship on you at the last second, you had to get somebody else,\r\n      then I need to know what it is and I need to know what specifically\r\n      your new fellow is going to do, how much time he needs, what it is he\r\n      needs to do so I can say, all right, this is how it's going to be or isn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n      this case. I will not be able to assist you further with this case.\r\n9PCR evidence revealed defense counsel never requested an order approving\r\npayment for Rickborn's services, and Rickborn was never paid for the work she\r\nperformed on Weik's case.\r\n10Specifically, Beauford cited the need to obtain Petitioner's father's military\r\npsychiatric records—some of the very documents Rickborn requested that Hardee-\r\nThomas assist her in procuring months earlier.\r\n\nDespite this lifeline from the judge, counsel did not budge and reiterated,\r\n\"basically, it was a matter of I guess communication in a sense. And I don't know\r\nwhat happened there. I mean basically she felt the communication wasn't the way\r\nshe wanted it to be, so she decided not to be a part of the team, in short.\" Counsel\r\nfailed to disclose Rickborn's resignation letter, or otherwise reveal the true reasons\r\nfor Rickborn's departure. Not knowing counsel's complete lack of preparation\r\nregarding Weik's social history, the trial judge denied the motion for a continuance\r\nbut offered to issue an order or make telephone calls to expedite the process of\r\nobtaining the records.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Parker conducted interviews with Weik's mother and father, brother\r\nChris, sister Maggie, and brother-in-law Bill in an effort to uncover mitigating\r\nevidence for use at trial. Parker testified that he provided all of his interview\r\nreports to Beauford within two days of conducting each interview, but counsel\r\nnever asked to meet with him to discuss or review any of the reports or instructed\r\nParker to take any follow-up steps.11 Parker testified that he was willing to offer\r\ncounsel suggestions on how to integrate the information he discovered into the\r\nmitigation phase of trial, but counsel never asked him about any of the interviews\r\nhe conducted or information he discovered, either before or during trial.\r\n\r\nIn short, some mitigating evidence of Weik's social history was developed and\r\navailable to trial counsel for the sentencing phase. There is no evidence in the\r\nrecord to suggest trial counsel made any effort to obtain and review this mitigation\r\nevidence. What is clear is that the jury heard from only Petitioner's sister Amy,\r\nwhose testimony revealed virtually nothing about Weik's abusive upbringing.12\r\n11The record does not reflect that Parker was provided with any of the information\r\nRickborn gathered in order to aid his investigation, despite the fact that Rickborn\r\nhad previously interviewed almost all of the witnesses with whom Parker spoke.\r\nLikewise, it does not appear that Parker was provided any information gathered by\r\nBobby Minter, a fact investigator retained to assist counsel with the guilt phase of\r\nthe trial, who had interviewed several of Petitioner's former coworkers,\r\nacquaintances, and relatives and provided counsel with a detailed list of those\r\npotential witnesses before Parker was retained.\r\n12 Further, Amy testified at PCR that she met with trial counsel only one time about\r\ntwo weeks before Petitioner's trial regarding her testimony at trial; however, Amy\r\nstated counsel never asked her about her knowledge of Weik's childhood\r\nbackground or social history and that she and counsel never discussed the\r\nquestions she would be asked prior to her taking the stand. Amy stated that, on the\r\n\n                                          II.\r\n\r\n                                          A.\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Weik presented the extensive mitigating evidence that was\r\ndiscovered before trial by defense investigators and available to counsel at the time\r\nof trial. Unlike the evidence presented during Weik's trial, which left the jury\r\nknowing no details about his social history, this extensive evidence shed light on\r\nhis extremely dysfunctional, unstable, and abusive childhood.\r\n\r\nWeik lived his entire life with his parents in a house that was filthy, had fallen into\r\ndisrepair,13 and did not have running water for a period of several years. Weik's\r\n\r\nmorning she was to testify, she told Beauford she felt like she had had a \"nervous\r\nbreakdown\" due to some harassing phone calls she allegedly received from the\r\nSolicitor the night before, but Beauford did not respond or inquire about her\r\nemotional state/ability to testify effectively on the day of the trial.\r\n\r\nDuring the PCR hearing, Beauford was questioned:\r\n\r\n      Q: Since you didn't have an opportunity to know what [Amy] had said\r\n        in the report or the interview that she gave to Ms. Rickborn, you\r\n        didn't know what questions to ask to get that information out to the\r\n        jury, did you?\r\n\r\n      A: I didn't know specifically, but I think I asked the open-ended\r\n        questions that could have allowed it—maybe not—she didn't follow\r\n        up and I didn't follow up, not knowing what the information was\r\n        that I needed to get out to the jury.\r\n\r\n      Q. That's my point. \t mean, if you had available to you, a report Ms.\r\n                          I\r\n        Rickborn had of her interview with Amy Weik, there was a lot\r\n        more information [Amy] knew about. Isn't that correct?\r\n\r\n      A. I don't know what the report says, but possibly, it could have, yes.\r\n13Parker initially could not locate the family home due to the dense overgrowth of\r\nvines and shrubbery which \"completely engulf the structure and obscure it from\r\nview,\" even though it sits just a few feet from the road.\r\n\nfather Russell Weik (Russell) compulsively hoarded things (particularly military-\r\nrelated items such as guns, knives, swords, and other weapons and munitions) such\r\nthat the inside and outside of the home were piled high with junk and debris,\r\nleaving only narrow passages for getting around. By all accounts, Russell would\r\n\"go crazy and start breaking up things\" if anyone attempted to straighten any of the\r\nclutter.\r\n\r\nChris Weik, Petitioner's younger brother, stated he and his siblings lived in one\r\nbedroom. He described his family as \"very poor.\" Chris described his home as\r\nvery old and lacking air conditioning and running water for a period of time. Chris\r\ntestified other children frequently teased him and his siblings about being so poor\r\nand that he and Petitioner would get \"beat up, hit with rocks, [and] throwed in the\r\ndirt\" by other children. Chris testified Petitioner's learning disability was apparent\r\nfrom a very early age and that Petitioner attended special education classes. Chris\r\nexplained that Petitioner was born with a very large head, and that his family made\r\nfun of him for it, even nicknaming him \"Eggy\" due to his \"egg head.\" Chris\r\ntestified Petitioner did not drop out of school, but was expelled after he fought\r\nanother student who teased him for being \"slow.\"\r\n\r\nChris also testified about growing up in a household with their father, Russell.\r\nChris stated his father experienced daily Vietnam flashbacks, and he would get out\r\nhis gun, load it, sharpen his bayonet, and put on his Army helmet and pack. Chris\r\nclaimed his father told them he executed over two thousand people in Vietnam,\r\nand he taught them how to kill people by \"crushing the windpipe\" and \"snatching\r\nthe heart.\" Chris indicated that when their father took them camping, he would\r\ngive them a forty-five caliber semiautomatic pistol and tell them to stand guard\r\nagainst the Viet Cong. Chris stated his father brought home bags of concrete,\r\nweapons, C-rations, helmets, canteens, and bayonets to prepare for any future\r\nattacks and set tripwires in the yard to teach his children that life is unpredictable.\r\nChris stated his father had a forty-four Magnum, a German Mauser, cap and ball\r\npistols, hand grenades, dynamite, and blasting caps, all of which were handled\r\nloosely around the children. Chris claimed he and Petitioner had their own\r\nsurvival packs, which included bayonets and gun cleaning kits. Chris indicated\r\nPetitioner, like Russell, was fascinated with guns.\r\n\r\nChris testified Russell would not allow them to invite friends over because he\r\nfeared they might be spies. Chris and Petitioner were also not allowed to discuss\r\nanything that happened in the house with others. Chris stated he and Petitioner had\r\nbeen beaten with rubber hoses, rose bush switches, a car antenna, a coax cable, and\r\n\na machete. Chris testified his father beat him two to three times a month, and\r\nsometimes kicked him in the backside with steel-toed boots. Chris claimed his\r\nfather would also punish his children by locking them in the sweltering hot attic,\r\nwhich had no air conditioning and windows that were nailed shut, for hours at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nRamonda \"Rae\" Ferrer-Klocek, Petitioner's half-sister, stated that after her father\r\ndied when she was nine years old and her mother married Russell, her home life\r\nbecame miserable. Rae described Russell as a harsh disciplinarian who\r\nconsistently berated all of the children, particularly Petitioner, who was an easy\r\ntarget because he was \"slow.\" According to Rae, Russell called Petitioner\r\n\"worthless\" and \"stupid\" and told him he would never be good for anything. Rae\r\nstated that Russell's aggression towards Petitioner became worse when Petitioner\r\nstarted school and struggled with his schoolwork. Rae remembered seeing\r\nPetitioner hit himself in the head with his fists and call himself stupid, like his\r\nfather did.\r\n\r\nRae recalled a time when Petitioner was still in diapers that Russell became angry\r\nat him and struck him so hard that Petitioner came off the ground and slammed\r\ninto the wall. Rae also recounted a time when Russell flew into a rage over a\r\nminor annoyance and shot the children's long-time pet. According to Rae, she and\r\nthe other children \"always had to walk on eggshells and be careful not to make too\r\nmuch noise because annoyances would set him off and trigger a fit of rage.\" Rae\r\nstated that her mother did not defend the children from Russell's abuse. Rae\r\nresponded to the abusive environment by moving to New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nMagdalena \"Maggie\" Ferrer Gunter, Petitioner's half-sister, testified that living\r\nwith Russell was \"hell\" because he had a very violent, sometimes outrageous\r\ntemper, and he would break items in her mother's house. According to Maggie,\r\nRussell kept an abnormally large quantity of firearms in the home and enjoyed\r\n\"being like on a power trip, like he could control you.\" Maggie recalled one time\r\nwhen her mother had left home for a few hours, for no discernable reason, Russell\r\nmade her sit at the kitchen table, forbidding her to move until her mother returned\r\nhome. Maggie stated that, had she not married Bill Gunter at age eighteen and\r\nmoved to Florida, she would have \"gotten away somehow\" because \"nobody\r\nwould want to stay there very long.\"\r\n\r\nMaggie also testified about Petitioner's odd behaviors as a child, including that he\r\n\"would laugh at things that weren't really funny to us or to the average person.\"\r\n\nMaggie also stated that Petitioner was slow learning to talk, but once he began, he\r\nwas a very talkative child, speaking very quickly and rambling from thought to\r\nthought. Maggie stated that she suspected Petitioner may have had some mental\r\nhealth issues, but Petitioner never had a psychological evaluation because her\r\nfamily did not believe in taking children to doctors and could not afford medical or\r\npsychiatric care.\r\n\r\nBill Gunter, who served in the military with Russell and married Russell's step-\r\ndaughter Maggie in 1969, testified that Russell obsessively collected guns and\r\nother weapons, including live dynamite, in the home, \"for his protection\" because\r\nRussell \"feared the government quite a bit, he was afraid we were going to be\r\ninvaded and we're going to need the guns to defend ourselves . . . against []our\r\nenemies.\" According to Bill, Russell did not act as a father figure towards the\r\nchildren, who he largely ignored, except to torment Petitioner and Chris in order to\r\n\"toughen them up.\" In that regard, Bill stated Russell would require the boys to\r\nperform tasks like standing at attention outside at all hours of the night in their\r\nunderwear, submitting to personal inspections in the bathtub, marching around the\r\nyard, and responding to military-style commands.\r\n\r\nRussell had an unpredictable and violent temper. Bill stated there was no way to\r\nanticipate what was going to upset Russell, and he would get very angry and beat\r\nthe kids with \"whatever he could get his hands on.\" Bill recounted that he had seen\r\nRussell use his fists to hit his sons in the chest and in the face and whip them with\r\na flyswatter, an antenna, and his belt. Bill also confirmed that Russell claimed to\r\nhave taught his children various methods to kill another person, including \"a quick\r\nway of killing [someone] where they wouldn't make any sounds.\" Bill also\r\ntestified that Russell spoke often of his participation in clandestine CIA operations\r\nboth in Vietnam and stateside after the war ended. Bill understood that Russell\r\nwas extremely unstable.\r\n\r\nAs to Petitioner's childhood, Bill testified that as a young child, Petitioner looked\r\ndifferent than most children because of his enlarged head. Bill also stated that\r\nPetitioner \"seemed to develop slower than the other children did at his age. He\r\nwalked at a much later date, he began to talk very slowly, he didn't seem to grasp\r\nthings as quickly as other children did.\" Bill also stated that it took Petitioner\r\nmuch longer than other children to be potty trained. Bill also testified that, as a\r\nyoung child, Petitioner appeared to do things in search of attention and praise and\r\n\"he got very little of either. When he would do something good his father seemed\r\nto just take an indifferent approach to it.\" Bill also stated that Petitioner did not\r\n\nrelate well to other children and \"other kids seemed to tease him a lot because they\r\ncould fluster him.\" Bill testified that, as a teenager, Petitioner had very few friends\r\nand became somewhat of a loner. Bill also stated that as Petitioner aged, he began\r\nto have difficulty concentrating, experienced dramatic personality swings and\r\nbecame unpredictably irritable.\r\n\r\nBy all accounts, Russell regularly suffers from \"flashbacks\" regarding his service\r\nin the military. In one of these events, Russell mistook his daughter Amy for\r\n\"Charlie\" and violently strangled the girl, who was just eight years old at the time.\r\nAmy's life was saved only by Petitioner's mother intervening and hitting Russell in\r\nthe head with a frying pan, knocking him unconscious. Russell acknowledges that\r\nhe was not a good father and was very abusive and violent towards his children,\r\nbut maintains that he \"could not help it.\" Russell also proudly claims that he\r\n\"trained\" his children in \"hand-to-hand combat\" and \"jujitsu\" and taught them\r\n\"how to protect themselves.\"\r\n\r\nUndeniably, Russell was the biggest influence in shaping Petitioner's childhood. It\r\nis the evidence regarding Russell's impact in particular that Petitioner claims would\r\nhave affected the jury's sentencing decision. The impact of this omitted evidence\r\ncan only be appreciated through a recitation of the most pertinent parts of Russell's\r\nPCR testimony.\r\n\r\nRussell is obsessed with the military and conjures detailed fantasies about being\r\ninvolved in various military missions. At the PCR hearing, Russell testified that\r\nafter boot camp, he was approached to be a \"ghost warrior\" and participate in a\r\n\"little experimentation\"—a joint effort among the CIA, the Marines, and the\r\nNavy.14 Russell stated that he received military training in \"[f]ire fighting, nuclear\r\nbiological chemical warfare defense, and also damage control.\" Russell, who\r\nnever served in Vietnam, testified about a time when he was purportedly serving as\r\na colonel in the Marines and led a group of eight Navy SEALs armed with AR-15\r\nrifles on a nighttime parachute mission outside Saigon. Russell explained:\r\n\r\n      Q: What was the purpose of the compound [you set up in Vietnam]?\r\n\r\n\r\n14Russell claims he was employed by the CIA while simultaneously serving in\r\nboth the Marine Corps and the Navy. Russell stated that, while serving in the\r\nmilitary, he was granted a Top Secret level security clearance, which he maintains\r\nto this day. To be sure, Russell is a psychotic, very disturbed individual.\r\n\n      A: Well, it started off in December of '64 when I got over there as an\r\n        observation investigation team. We were to go out and we were the\r\n        observers and we were also the people who made sure what was\r\n        happening was according to the Geneva [C]onvention. . . . [T]he\r\n        CIA told me to act like Gomer Pyle because everybody over there\r\n        watched his show and Andy of Mayberry. So I would holler golly,\r\n        shazam, or something like that because I was Jim Nabors.\r\n\r\n      Q: You got instructions from the [CIA] to do that?\r\n\r\n      A: Yeah. \tI had two people with me. One was an African American.\r\n        The other was Caucasian, and their names were Smith and Jones,\r\n        and the next week Jones was Smith and Smith was Jones.\r\n\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      Q. Now, who paid you? Did the CIA pay you?\r\n\r\n      A. It was all in scrip. \t. . . They didn't want you to use American\r\n        money, and that's what it was in. . . . The next question you're\r\n        going to ask is whether I was being paid as an E-3 or as a Colonel.\r\n\r\n      Q. I wasn't actually, but that is a good question. \t hy don't you go\r\n                                                         W\r\n        ahead and answer it.\r\n\r\n      A. I was paid as an E-3 because one of the things they didn't want was\r\n        people to find out I was getting more money than them or\r\n        something like that, and . . . I had the authority. In other words, by\r\n        the power invested in me by the President of the United States and\r\n        the Director of the CIA, I had the power to take over any phase or\r\n        any plane or anything. . . . [I] [w]alked up to the Bird Colonel and\r\n        told him he was my subordinate and the CIA man said, yes, sir, you\r\n        are his subordinate. He is your commanding officer, and I said by\r\n        the power invested in me by the President of the United States and\r\n        Director of the CIA I now accept responsibility for your base, and\r\n        all that it contains.\r\n\r\nRegarding one instance of combat during the six months he claimed to have spent\r\nin Vietnam, Russell stated:\r\n\n      A: When you're going to die you get desperate, and I got all the\r\n        people together and I told them that I wanted to live through this,\r\n        and I said at the end of the day I hope we (portion not audible due\r\n        to the witness getting very emotional). It was quite an interesting\r\n        day. . . . I went around and counted the dead and it was three\r\n        thousand sixty people.\r\n\r\n      Q: Were these Vietnamese?\r\n\r\n      A: Well, there wasn't much difference at that time because you didn't\r\n        know whether it was North Vietnamese or Regulars. They all\r\n        dressed the same. Little black pajamas and little hats.\r\n\r\nRussell explained that, after returning from Vietnam, he was discharged from the\r\nmilitary but reenlisted a short time later and was stationed in Charleston. Russell\r\nexplained that, after reenlisting, he woke up one morning with dizziness, shortness\r\nof breath and a headache, so he \"went up there to the sick call place, and they said I\r\nwas having a nervous breakdown or something another.\" Regarding his treatment\r\nat the Charleston Naval Hospital, Russell explained, \"I was back behind echo ward\r\nin what they called the observation unit first, and the CIA said they had to write me\r\na new history because I stuck out like a turd in a punch bowl.\"\r\n\r\nThereafter, PCR counsel confronted Russell with his military records, which do not\r\nreflect any service in Vietnam.15 Russell explained that those military records\r\nwere inaccurate and fabricated by the CIA when they \"rewrote his history\" and that\r\nhe was instructed by CIA personnel not to discuss the matter. According to\r\nRussell, even after his military service ended, he continued to serve as an\r\nundercover operative for the CIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15Russell never served in Vietnam. According to official records, Russell actively\r\nserved in the Navy for four years and eight months and was honorably discharged\r\nafter being hospitalized for chronic schizophrenia in July 1965. These records also\r\nreveal that Russell saw no combat and his most noteworthy accomplishment during\r\nservice was completing his GED in December 1961.\r\n\n                                          B. \n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, the State elicited testimony from Petitioner's trial counsel.\r\nAccording to Beauford, his primary role was focused on the initial phase of the\r\ntrial, and Hardee-Thomas's primary role was to hire, coordinate, and assist the\r\nmental health experts and mitigation investigators in preparation for the penalty\r\nphase. Beauford stated that he relied on Hardee-Thomas to coordinate these\r\nmitigation efforts and that he was unaware Hardee-Thomas utterly failed to do\r\nthose things until just before trial. When asked about the nature of Hardee-\r\nThomas's role, Beauford stated, \"I wouldn't know what her role would be if you\r\ndon't take any active part within the trial.\" Beauford stated that, during trial,\r\nHardee-Thomas was present, occupying space, but did not contribute anything\r\nuseful or of substance during the entire case, and he felt absolutely alone in\r\nrepresenting Petitioner.\r\n\r\nBeauford testified he knew at the time of trial that Petitioner's father was \"very\r\nabusive.\" Beauford testified he met several of Petitioner's family members and\r\nwas aware of Russell's belief that he worked for the CIA. Despite meeting Russell\r\nprior to trial, Beauford stated he did not realize Russell was lying about his service\r\nwith the CIA in Vietnam because he \"didn't know him like that.\" Beauford\r\nconceded Russell was somewhat eccentric, but he stated, \"you never know what a\r\nperson might have been involved in at any time in these covert operations. So I\r\njust left it alone.\" At the PCR hearing, Beauford was questioned:\r\n\r\n      Q: So no alarms went off in your head that [Russell] might be—there\r\n        may be some further problem working behind the lines?\r\n\r\n      A: Well, I mean, his behavior suggested something was wrong, but,\r\n        again, I could read that into being in Vietnam or exposed to some\r\n        chemical or something. I did think in the conversation when he\r\n        was going on maybe about Agent Orange or something like that,\r\n        but I didn't take the conversation to that extent.\r\n\r\nNot having reviewed any of the interviews from Rickborn and Parker, Beauford\r\nchose to call Amy because she was \"more stable\" and could convey things better\r\nthan others. However, Beauford admitted he did not know about Rickborn's\r\nreports and did not review those from Parker prior to trial; thus, he did not rely on\r\nthat information in determining whether to call Petitioner's mother, father, and\r\nsiblings as mitigation witnesses. Beauford conceded the interviews he failed to\r\n\nreview prior to trial constituted \"significant mitigation evidence\" and that it would\r\nhave been important for the jury to see that Petitioner was raised in a family\r\nsurrounded by mentally ill people.16\r\n\r\nHardee-Thomas admitted she never attempted to strategize, to discuss the defense\r\ntheory of either phase of the trial, or to discuss the usefulness of the information\r\nfrom investigators and experts with Beauford. Hardee-Thomas testified her role in\r\nWeik's case was \"assisting Mr. Beauford\" as the \"paper person\" and \"silent party.\"\r\nHardee-Thomas stated she was not involved in deciding which witnesses to call,\r\ndeveloping a theory of the case, or developing a mitigation strategy. Hardee-\r\nThomas contended that she assumed such a role because Beauford wanted it that\r\nway. She stated she did not consider assuming a leadership role in the case\r\nbecause Beauford had already begun working on the case at the time she was\r\nappointed.17 Hardee-Thomas claimed she wondered why she was appointed at all\r\ngiven that her involvement was so limited, but she never considered raising the\r\nissue to Beauford or the trial judge because she did not think that was appropriate.\r\nWhen asked for an explanation, Hardee-Thomas replied, \"It's my understanding\r\nthat I provided Mr. Beauford with the information and he decided the trial\r\nstrategy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked why obtaining evidence for the penalty phase of a capital case is\r\nimportant, Hardee-Thomas answered, \"To give some defenses if anything.\" When\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16 Both Russell and Russell's father (Petitioner's paternal grandfather) suffered\r\n\"nervous breakdowns\" and were hospitalized for psychiatric illness. Additionally,\r\nPetitioner's mother and all of his siblings suffered from some form of mental health\r\nissue, such as depression, or alcohol or drug abuse problems. At the PCR hearing,\r\ntwo mental health experts testified that, had they been provided with this\r\ninformation prior to trial, they would have been able to emphasize Petitioner's\r\nstrong genetic predisposition to schizophrenia and impeach the State's mental\r\nhealth experts, who diagnosed Petitioner with schizotypal personality disorder,\r\nwhich is considered a less severe disorder.\r\n17Beauford was initially retained by Petitioner's parents to represent Petitioner.\r\nHowever, after the State served its notice of intent to seek the death penalty,\r\nPetitioner's parents informed Beauford they could not afford the cost of hiring\r\nmental health experts or a mitigation investigation. Thereafter, Beauford and\r\nHardee-Thomas were appointed to represent Petitioner.\r\n\nasked how the information obtained by the mitigation investigators could have\r\nbeen used at trial, Hardee-Thomas responded, \"To help Mr. Beauford help defend\r\n[Petitioner].\"\r\n\r\nFollowing a lengthy hearing, the PCR judge issued an order of dismissal, denying\r\nrelief and finding counsel presented all available testimony to the jury and that\r\ncounsel's decision to call only Amy could not be deemed deficient. As to\r\nprejudice, the PCR judge acknowledged there may have been other family\r\nmembers who were willing to testify, including Chris and Bill, and agreed those\r\nwitnesses may have been able to provide additional perspectives regarding\r\nPetitioner's social history. However, the PCR judge found that \"there has been an\r\ninadequate showing that there were relevant omissions such that to a reasonable\r\nprobability the result would have been different.\" Thus, the PCR judge determined\r\nthe additional witnesses and evidence would have merely provided Petitioner with\r\na \"fancier\" mitigation case, which is insufficient to show prejudice.18 This Court\r\ngranted certiorari to review the order of the PCR court.\r\n\r\n                                        III.\r\nWeik argues counsel were ineffective for failing to present substantial mitigating\r\nevidence that was available at the time of his trial. Specifically, Weik argues\r\ndefense investigators conducted extensive interviews with his family members and\r\nothers, who provided significant mitigating information regarding the severe abuse\r\nhe endured as a child, and that counsel were ineffective for failing to present that\r\navailable information to the jury. Under current law, we must agree and find\r\ncounsel were deficient in failing to present this readily available mitigating\r\nevidence. We further find Weik has established prejudice, for counsel's\r\nconstitutionally deficient representation undermines confidence in the outcome.\r\n\r\n\"An ineffective assistance claim has two components: A petitioner must show that\r\ncounsel's performance was deficient, and that the deficiency prejudiced the\r\ndefense.\" Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 521 (2003) (citation omitted). \"To\r\nestablish deficient performance, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel's\r\nrepresentation 'fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.'\" Id. (quoting\r\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984)). \"[T]o establish prejudice, a\r\n\r\n18See Jones v. State, 332 S.C. 329, 339, 504 S.E.2d 822, 827 (1998) (finding that\r\nthe absence of \"fancier\" mitigation evidence does not render the prior mitigation\r\ncase constitutionally inadequate where such evidence would not have had any\r\neffect on the outcome of the trial).\r\n\ndefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\r\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Id.\r\nat 534 (quotations and citation omitted). \"In assessing prejudice, we reweigh the\r\nevidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.\" Id.\r\nPrejudice is established where \"there is a reasonable probability that at least one\r\njuror would have struck a different balance.\" Id. at 537 (citation omitted). A\r\n\"reasonable probability\" is less than a preponderance of the evidence but still \"a\r\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Strickland, 466\r\nU.S. at 693–94.\r\n\r\n\"The sentencing stage is the most critical phase of a death penalty case.\" Romano\r\nv. Gibson, 239 F.3d 1156, 1180 (10th Cir. 2001). \"Any competent counsel knows\r\nthe importance of thoroughly investigating and presenting mitigating evidence.\"\r\nId. During the sentencing phase of a death penalty trial, counsel is required to\r\ninvestigate and present meaningful mitigating evidence absent a reasonable\r\nstrategic choice not to do so. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 390–93 (2005)\r\n(citing Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 538). Important sentencing phase considerations\r\ninclude a defendant's \"medical history, educational history, employment and\r\ntraining history, family and social history, prior adult and juvenile correctional\r\nexperience, and religious and cultural influences.\" Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524\r\n(finding testimony that defendant suffered \"physical torment\" and sexual abuse as\r\na result of his alcoholic, absentee mother and subsequent foster families constituted\r\na \"powerful mitigating narrative\" that counsel was ineffective for failing to\r\npresent); see Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319 (1989) (\"Evidence about the\r\ndefendant's background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held\r\nby this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a\r\ndisadvantaged background may be less culpable than defendants who have no such\r\nexcuse.\"); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 112 (1982) (noting that\r\nconsideration of the offender's life history is a \"part of the process of inflicting the\r\npenalty of death\"); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 605 (1978) (invalidating an Ohio\r\nlaw that did not permit consideration of aspects of a defendant's background);\r\nWilson v. Sirmons, 536 F.3d 1064, 1088 (10th Cir. 2008) (finding \"there is no\r\nsubstitute for the information counsel can glean from the family when researching\r\nthe defendant's background, as they are almost always the only people who can\r\nprovide a complete narrative of the defendant's life\").\r\n\r\nWeik contends counsel were ineffective for failing to elicit meaningful mitigating\r\nevidence from Amy, Chris, Maggie, Bill, and Russell during the mitigation phase.\r\nWeik argues these witnesses would have provided substantial mitigating evidence\r\n\nregarding his social history and background, and particularly about his tyrannical\r\nand psychotic father. Further, Weik argues the omitted mitigation evidence was\r\ncritical for impeachment and cross-examination of the State's forensic psychologist\r\nexpert, who largely painted a picture of Weik's childhood as normal.\r\n\r\nThe PCR judge erred in finding counsel presented all available mitigation evidence\r\nto the jury. Though counsel introduced psychological testimony regarding\r\nPetitioner's mental illness, counsel failed to present even a skeletal version of\r\nPetitioner's social history even though there was abundant social history evidence\r\navailable to them.\r\n\r\nDespite counsel's delay in beginning the mitigation investigation, defense\r\ninvestigators were nevertheless able to uncover substantial mitigating information\r\nabout Petitioner's social history and provided counsel with written reports detailing\r\nthat information. Yet, counsel simply failed to present any of this mitigating\r\nevidence to the jury; rather, the mitigation presentation consisted solely of Amy's\r\nextremely limited testimony, which was general, vague, and offered no detail or\r\ninsight into the degree of abuse Weik suffered as a child. Thus, the jury remained\r\nunaware of the severity and pervasiveness of the physical and psychological abuse\r\nWeik faced and the full extent of his father's mental illness. The fact that the jury\r\nnever heard this mitigating evidence can be attributed only to counsel's failure to\r\nreview the investigators' reports they possessed in their own case files to become\r\naware of the wealth of information that had been uncovered.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court further erred in finding counsel's failure to present this mitigating\r\nevidence was the product of a strategic decision. \"'Where counsel articulates a\r\nvalid reason for employing a certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed\r\nineffective assistance of counsel.'\" Council v. State, 380 S.C. 159, 175, 670 S.E.2d\r\n356, 364 (2008) (alteration omitted) (quoting Watson v. State, 370 S.C. 68, 72, 634\r\nS.E.2d 642, 644 (2006)). \"Counsel's strategy will be reviewed under 'an objective\r\nstandard of reasonableness.'\" Id. (quoting Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 470, 560\r\nS.E.2d 401, 402 (2002)). Here, Beauford did not interview, or even review the\r\ninvestigators' interviews of, Weik's family members. Thus, Beauford did not rely\r\nupon or even review the wealth of social history information he possessed before\r\ntrial in determining whether to subpoena Weik's family members to testify during\r\nthe mitigation phase. Likewise, Hardee-Thomas reviewed nothing and\r\nemphatically disclaimed responsibility for making any strategic choices in\r\n\nPetitioner's case.19 Thus, we cannot conclude that counsel made any reasoned,\r\nstrategic choices regarding which witnesses would testify—there simply was no\r\nmitigation strategy regarding Petitioner's social history.\r\n\r\nWe find the decision to call only Amy to testify in mitigation resulted from\r\ncounsel's inattention, not reasoned strategic judgment. See Wood v. Allen, 558\r\nU.S. 290, 304 (2010) (emphasizing the distinction between the issue of whether\r\ncounsel made a strategic decision in the first place and the issue of whether a\r\nstrategic decision is a reasonable exercise of professional judgment under\r\nStrickland); Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 526–27 (finding the state court's invocation of the\r\n\"strategic decision\" doctrine to justify counsel's failure to pursue mitigating\r\nevidence \"resembles more a post hoc rationalization of counsel's conduct than an\r\naccurate description of [counsel's] deliberations prior to sentencing\").\r\n\r\nIndeed, counsel did not undertake a strategic decision to omit the mitigation\r\nevidence identified above; counsel simply did not read the investigators' reports\r\nand therefore did not know such evidence was available. Decisions made in\r\nignorance of relevant, available information cannot be characterized as strategic.\r\nSee, e.g., Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 39–40 (2009) (finding counsel's failure\r\nto \"even take the first step of interviewing witnesses or requesting records\" did not\r\nreflect reasonable professional judgment); Johnson v. Bagley, 544 F.3d 592, 605\r\n(6th Cir. 2008) (finding the failure to present substantial mitigating evidence\r\nregarding capital defendant's \"remarkably traumatic childhood\" was the result of\r\ncounsel's \"bungling or sheer laziness\" and not a reasoned strategic decision\r\nwarranting deference); Haliym v. Mitchell, 492 F.3d 680, 716 (6th Cir. 2007)\r\n(finding where a capital defendant \"had everything to gain and nothing to lose\" by\r\nintroducing certain mitigating evidence during the penalty phase, there was \"no\r\nrational trial strategy that would justify the failure of [] counsel to investigate and\r\npresent [such] evidence\" (citations and quotations omitted)); Anderson v. Sirmons,\r\n476 F.3d 1131, 1145–46 (10th Cir. 2007) (finding where counsel's decision not to\r\npresent readily available evidence in mitigation was made in ignorance of relevant\r\nfacts, such a decision could not be considered a \"tactical decision\"); Pavel v.\r\nHollins, 261 F.3d 210, 218 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding counsel's uninformed decision\r\nnot to present favorable evidence \"was not the sort of conscious, reasonably\r\ninformed decision made by an attorney with an eye to benefitting his client that the\r\nfederal courts have denominated 'strategic' and [have] been especially reluctant to\r\ndisturb\"); Loyd v. Whitley, 977 F.2d 149, 159 (5th Cir. 1992) (finding where\r\n19The representation by Hardee-Thomas is especially troubling, for she simply\r\nwashed her hands of the case, leaving the entire representation to Beauford.\r\n\nsignificant mitigating evidence in a capital case was not presented to the jury,\r\n\"[c]ounsel 'did not choose, strategically or otherwise, to pursue one line of defense\r\nover another. Instead, he simply abdicated his responsibility to advocate his\r\nclient's cause.'\" (quoting Nealy v. Cabana, 764 F.2d 1173, 1178 (5th Cir. 1985))).\r\nAccordingly we find the PCR court erred in finding counsel were not deficient in\r\nthis regard. Indeed, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\r\nnoted:[M]itigation investigation . . . is literally of life and death importance,\r\n      for if the mitigating evidence is insufficient, the defendant is\r\n      sentenced to death. In this case, each of [the defendant]'s two\r\n      attorneys thought the other was handling the investigation of\r\n      mitigating evidence to be presented at the sentencing phase of the\r\n      trial. As a result, virtually no mitigating evidence about [the\r\n      defendant] was discovered or presented. . . . Only one witness, [the\r\n      defendant]'s mother, was called on behalf of [the defendant] and she\r\n      was asked very general questions about [the defendant]'s childhood.\r\n      A reading of the direct examination takes approximately 90 seconds\r\n      and fills less than three pages of transcript. This failure on the part of\r\n      his attorneys goes beyond ineffective. It strikes closer to total\r\n      incompetence. . . . This was no strategic choice not to present\r\n      mitigating evidence, which would at least be defensible. Here, the\r\n      attorneys utterly failed to even look for anything that would cause a\r\n      jury to consider giving their client a life sentence rather than death.\r\n\r\nO'Guinn v. Dutton, 88 F.3d 1409, 1424 (6th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (Merritt, C.J.,\r\nconcurring).\r\n\r\nAs to the prejudice prong of the Strickland analysis, we find that in reweighing the\r\naggravating factors against the totality of available mitigating evidence, counsel's\r\ndeficient representation undermined confidence in the outcome. See Wiggins, 539\r\nU.S. at 536 (finding that had the jury been confronted with considerable mitigating\r\nevidence regarding the \"sordid details of [Petitioner's] life history,\" there was \"a\r\nreasonable probability that it would have returned with a different sentence\");\r\nLockett, 438 U.S. at 603 (\"[P]ossession of the fullest information possible\r\nconcerning the defendant's life and characteristics is highly relevant—if not\r\nessential—to the selection of an appropriate sentence.\" (quotations, alteration, and\r\ncitations omitted)).\r\n\nOn the whole, the testimony presented at the PCR hearing revealed graphic and\r\ndetailed accounts of Petitioner's abusive and dysfunctional childhood, saturated\r\nwith violence and military fantasies, which was not apparent from the scant\r\ntestimony presented at trial. Moreover, this testimony would have demonstrated\r\nPetitioner's genetic predisposition to schizophrenia and helped explain his auditory\r\nand visual hallucinations at the time of the shooting. Given that Amy's testimony\r\npresented no meaningful evidence of Petitioner's social history, we reject the PCR\r\njudge's conclusion that Petitioner merely seeks a \"fancier\" mitigation case. See\r\nRosemond v. Catoe, 383 S.C. 320, 329, 680 S.E.2d 5, 10 (2009) (rejecting the\r\nState's argument that the petitioner merely sought a \"fancier\" mitigation case where\r\nno evidence of capital defendant's known mental health issues was presented at\r\ntrial (quoting Jones v. State, 332 S.C. 329, 339, 504 S.E.2d 822, 827 (1998)));\r\nCouncil, 380 S.C. at 176, 670 S.E.2d at 365 (finding counsel were ineffective for\r\nfailing to present only limited mitigation testimony where \"there was very strong\r\nmitigating evidence to be weighed against the aggravating circumstances presented\r\nby the State\" and concluding \"this evidence may well have influenced the jury's\r\nassessment of Respondent's culpability\" (citing Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 393)).\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, Russell's testimony revealed he was extremely delusional and his\r\ntestimony would often wander in a manner similar to the descriptions of\r\nPetitioner's behavior given by defense psychiatrists and psychologists in support of\r\ntheir contention that Petitioner suffers from schizophrenia. Moreover, there was\r\nvery little testimony presented in mitigation to contradict the State's expert\r\ntestimony that Petitioner had an average IQ, no history of drug or alcohol abuse,\r\nwas the child of an \"intact family,\" and developed normally as a child, with no\r\nbehavioral problems. Given that the circumstances in aggravation were Petitioner's\r\nkicking open the victim's door immediately prior to the shooting (burglary) and\r\nphysical torture (the delay between the first shot and the fatal shot due to\r\nPetitioner's gun jamming), we find there is a reasonable probability that the\r\nmissing details regarding the degree of physical and emotional abuse Petitioner\r\nsuffered and the full extent of Russell's mental illness and its impact on the Weik\r\nhousehold might well have influenced the jury's determination. See Wiggins, 539\r\nU.S. at 537 (finding prejudice is established where \"there is a reasonable\r\nprobability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance\").\r\n\nAccordingly, confidence in the outcome is substantially undermined, and we find\r\nWeik was prejudiced by the omission of this significant and readily available\r\nmitigating evidence. We reverse the denial of PCR on this issue and remand the\r\ncase for a new sentencing hearing. 20  IV.\r\nWe reverse the PCR court and hold that Weik established his entitlement to a new\r\nsentencing hearing as a result of trial counsel's failure to present available\r\nmitigating evidence regarding his social history. We remand the case for a new\r\nsentencing hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nActing Chief Justice PLEICONES, BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., and Acting\r\nJustice James E.

On\r\nJune 10, 2006, an X-ray revealed that Ranucci had suffered a collapsed lung.\r\n\r\n       On June 8, 2009, Ranucci filed an NOI pursuant to section 15-79-125(A),\r\nwhich alleged her collapsed lung was a result of Dr. Crain's negligent execution of\r\nthe biopsy. The NOI stated that \"time constraints\" prevented Ranucci from\r\ncontemporaneously filing an affidavit of a medical expert. The NOI further stated\r\nRanucci would either file such an affidavit within the next forty-five days pursuant\r\nto section 15-36-100(C) or her allegations of negligence would be \"within the\r\nambit of common knowledge and experience\" so that Dr. Crain's conduct could be\r\nevaluated without the assistance of special learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      after the filing of the complaint to supplement the pleadings with the\r\n      affidavit.\r\n\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      (D) This section does not extend an applicable period of limitation,\r\n      except that, if the affidavit is filed within the period specified in this\r\n      section, the filing of the affidavit after the expiration of the statute of\r\n      limitations is considered timely and provides no basis for a statute of\r\n      limitations defense.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-36-100(B), (C)(1), (D) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added).\r\n\n      On July 23, 2009, Ranucci filed an affidavit of Dr. Richard Boortz-Marx, a\r\nmedical doctor from North Carolina who was board certified in anesthesiology and\r\nanesthesiology pain management.\r\n\r\n       Dr. Crain filed an Answer to the NOI and a motion to dismiss Ranucci's NOI\r\non the ground the forty-five day extension for filing an expert affidavit, found in\r\nsection 15-36-100(C)(1), does not apply to the filing of an NOI under section 15-\r\n79-125(A) because the statute expressly requires the expert affidavit be filed\r\ncontemporaneously with the NOI. Additionally, Dr. Crain claimed Ranucci's NOI\r\nwas filed outside of the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\n       After a hearing, the circuit court granted Dr. Crain's motion to dismiss,\r\nfinding Ranucci did not comply with the plain language of section 15-79-125(A)\r\nbecause she did not file an expert affidavit contemporaneously with the NOI.\r\nHowever, because the NOI and affidavit did not constitute an \"action,\" the court\r\ndenied Dr. Crain's motion to dismiss on the alternative ground involving the statute\r\nof limitations.\r\n\r\n       Subsequently, Ranucci filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule\r\n59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. Following a hearing, the\r\ncircuit court denied the motion, but clarified that \"S.C. Code Ann. § 15-79-125 and\r\n[§] 15-36-100 operate independently of each other, and that § 15-36-100 does not\r\noffer a procedural alternative to § 15-79-125.\" Ranucci appealed to the Court of\r\nAppeals.The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's order. Ranucci v. Crain,\r\n397 S.C. 168, 723 S.E.2d 242 (Ct. App. 2012). In so ruling, the court analyzed the\r\nnarrow question of \"which requirements of section 15-36-100 constitute the\r\naffidavit requirements referenced by section 15-79-125(A).\" Id. at 176, 723 S.E.2d\r\nat 246. After parsing section 15-36-100, the court determined that this statute\r\n\"institutes, on the one hand, substantive requirements for the authorship and\r\ncontent of affidavits by expert witnesses and, on the other, procedural requirements\r\nrelating to such affidavits when filed with a complaint.\" Id. However, based on its\r\nreading of the two statutes at issue, the court found that, while section 15-79-125\r\nreferences and incorporates section 15-76-100, the latter statute is not incorporated\r\nin its entirety. Id. at 177, 723 S.E.2d at 246. Rather, the court concluded that\r\n\"section 15-79-125(A) invokes only the provisions of section 15-36-100 governing\r\nthe preparation and content of the affidavit.\" Id. at 176, 723 S.E.2d at 246.\r\nSpecifically, the court held that although section 15-79-125(A) references section\r\n\n15-36-100, it does not incorporate the forty-five day filing extension for the expert\r\naffidavit found in section 15-36-100(C)(1). Id. at 175, 723 S.E.2d at 246.\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing analysis, the court ultimately affirmed the circuit\r\ncourt's dismissal of Ranucci's NOI for failure to comply with the contemporaneous\r\naffidavit filing requirement of section 15-79-125. Id. at 175, 723 S.E.2d at 246.\r\nThe court expressly rejected Ranucci's argument that the affidavit requirements of\r\nsection 15-36-100 permitted her to file the affidavit late without violating section\r\n15-79-125. Id. at 178, 723 S.E.2d at 247. The court explained, \"The affidavit\r\nrequirements invoked by section 15-79-125 govern only authorship and content\"\r\nand \"do not permit a potential plaintiff to file her expert witness's affidavit after she\r\nfiles her Notice of Intent to File Suit.\" Id. We granted Ranucci's petition for a writ\r\nof certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n                                   II.   Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Arguments\r\n\r\n       Ranucci concedes the individual subsections of 15-79-125 and 15-36-100\r\nare clear when viewed in isolation. However, she asserts a reviewing court must\r\nlook beyond the plain language of individual subsections in order to discern the\r\nunderlying purpose of the statutes and their operational effect. Because the\r\n\"statutes have a shared purpose and were intended to completely incorporate one\r\nanother,\" Ranucci contends the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the dismissal\r\nof her pre-litigation NOI.\r\n\r\n        In support of this contention, Ranucci maintains that sections 15-79-125 and\r\n15-36-100 operate together to establish a two-step process for the filing of medical\r\nmalpractice cases. Although section 15-79-125 establishes the pre-litigation\r\nprocess in medical malpractice cases, Ranucci explains that section 15-36-100\r\n\"creates an orderly procedure where expert affidavits are injected into the earliest\r\nstage of a dispute.\" Specifically, Ranucci notes that section 15-36-100 contains\r\n\"the definitions, the enforcement mechanisms, and the penalties for non-\r\ncompliance\" that govern all professional negligence claims, including those\r\ninvolving medical malpractice. Therefore, Ranucci avers section 15-79-125 cannot\r\noperate in isolation, but must incorporate all provisions of section 15-36-100,\r\nincluding the \"safe harbor\" provision of subsection (C)(1) that extends the time for\r\nfiling the pre-litigation affidavit.\r\n\nB.    Analysis\r\n\r\n             1.    Rules of Statutory Construction\r\n\r\n       Because the disposition of the instant case is dependent on our interpretation\r\nof sections 15-79-125 and 15-36-100, we reference the well-established rules of\r\nstatutory construction. \"The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain\r\nand effectuate the intention of the legislature.\" Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495,\r\n498, 640 S.E.2d 457, 459 (2007). \"When a statute's terms are clear and\r\nunambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court\r\nmust apply the statute according to its literal meaning.\" Id. In interpreting a\r\nstatute, \"[w]ords must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to\r\nsubtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.\" Id. at 499,\r\n640 S.E.2d at 459. Further, \"the statute must be read as a whole and sections\r\nwhich are a part of the same general statutory law must be construed together and\r\neach one given effect.\" S.C. State Ports Auth. v. Jasper Cnty., 368 S.C. 388, 398,\r\n629 S.E.2d 624, 629 (2006).\r\n\r\n       \"If the statute is ambiguous . . . courts must construe the terms of the\r\nstatute.\" Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332, 342, 713 S.E.2d 278, 283\r\n(2011) (citation omitted). The statutory language must be construed in light of the\r\nintended purpose of the statute. Id. This Court will not construe a statute in a way\r\nwhich leads to an absurd result or renders it meaningless. See Lancaster Cnty. Bar\r\nAss'n v. S.C. Comm'n on Indigent Def., 380 S.C. 219, 222, 670 S.E.2d 371, 373\r\n(2008) (\"In construing a statute, this Court will reject an interpretation when such\r\nan interpretation leads to an absurd result that could not have been intended by the\r\nlegislature.\").\r\n\r\n             2.    Application of Statutory Construction Rules\r\n\r\n       Utilizing the above-outlined rules, the analysis begins with an examination\r\nof the legislative history of the statutes at issue. In 2005, the General Assembly\r\npassed Act No. 32 entitled \"CIVIL REMEDIES—INSURANCE—\r\nPROFESSIONS AND OCCUPATIONS.\" Act No. 32, 2005 S.C. Acts 133. In\r\nprefacing Act No. 32, the General Assembly included express findings stating that\r\nthe statutes within the Act constitute one subject and are intended to operate\r\ntogether to achieve a common purpose.\r\n\r\n      As part of this tort reform legislation, the General Assembly added section\r\n15-36-100 \"so as to establish standards for expert witnesses in professional\r\n\nmalpractice actions\" and \"chapter 79 to title 15 so as to define key terms, provide\r\nfor mandatory mediation, and to permit binding arbitration in medical malpractice\r\nactions.\" Act No. 32, 2005 S.C. Acts 133 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Based on this legislative history, we conclude the General Assembly\r\nenacted: (1) section 15-36-100 to establish the general construct regarding expert\r\nwitnesses for all professional negligence cases; and (2) section 15-79-125 as a\r\nsupplement to section 15-36-100 to provide for pre-litigation requirements that are\r\nunique to medical malpractice cases, including mandatory mediation. Thus, even\r\nwithout delving into the specific text of each statute, it is evident the General\r\nAssembly intended for sections 15-36-100 and 15-79-125 to be read in pari\r\nmateria. See Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375\r\n(2000) (\"It is well settled that statutes dealing with the same subject matter are in\r\npari materia and must be construed together, if possible, to produce a single,\r\nharmonious result.\").\r\n\r\n       A review of the plain language of the statutes bolsters this interpretation as\r\nthe statutes contain internal cross-references. Pursuant to section 15-79-125 a\r\nplaintiff is required, prior to filing or initiating a civil action alleging injury or\r\ndeath as a result of medical malpractice, to \"contemporaneously file a Notice of\r\nIntent to File Suit and an affidavit of an expert witness, subject to the affidavit\r\nrequirements established in Section 15-36-100, in a county in which venue would\r\nbe proper for filing or initiating the civil action.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-79-125(A)\r\n(Supp. 2013) (emphasis added). Because there are no words of limitation\r\nsurrounding the reference to section 15-36-100, we find it is incorporated into\r\nsection 15-79-125 in its entirety.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, section 15-36-100 is applicable to all medical malpractice\r\nactions as it specifically includes and references suits against \"medical doctors.\"\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 15-36-100(G)(7) (Supp. 2013) (\"This section applies to the\r\nfollowing professions: . . . (7) medical doctors . . . .\"); id. § 15-36-100(B) (\"Except\r\nas provided in Section 15-79-125, in an action for damages alleging professional\r\nnegligence against a professional licensed by or registered with the State of South\r\nCarolina and listed in subsection (G) or against any licensed health care facility\r\nalleged to be liable based upon the action or inaction of a health care professional\r\nlicensed by the State of South Carolina and listed in subsection (G), the plaintiff\r\nmust file as part of the complaint an affidavit of an expert witness which must\r\nspecify at least one negligent act or omission claimed to exist and the factual basis\r\nfor each claim based on the available evidence at the time of the filing of the\r\naffidavit.\").\r\n\n       Thus, although sections 15-79-125 and 15-36-100 are distinct in their\r\noperational procedures, it is evident the General Assembly promulgated the\r\nstatutes to work in concert for the common purpose of tort reform involving all\r\nprofessional negligence claims.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, an absurd result is created when one fails to read the statutes in\r\npari materia. As previously stated, section 15-79-125 governs the pre-litigation\r\nrequirements for medical malpractice cases. Specifically, section 15-79-125,\r\nrequires a plaintiff, prior to filing or initiating a medical malpractice claim, to\r\n\"contemporaneously file a Notice of Intent to File Suit and an affidavit of an expert\r\nwitness, subject to the affidavit requirements established in Section 15-36-100.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-79-125(A) (Supp. 2013). Filing of the NOI tolls all\r\napplicable statutes of limitations. Id. Thereafter, the parties engage in discovery.\r\nId. § 15-79-125(B). Within ninety days and no later than one hundred twenty days\r\nfrom service of the NOI, the parties must participate in a mediation conference. Id.\r\n§ 15-79-125(C). If the mediation is unsuccessful, the plaintiff may initiate the civil\r\naction by filing a summons and complaint. Id. § 15-79-125(E). However, notably\r\nabsent from section 15-79-125 are the specifics governing the expert witness\r\naffidavit and the remedy for a plaintiff's non-compliance.3 Instead, these\r\nprocedures may all be found in section 15-36-100.\r\n\r\n       Specifically, section 15-36-100 completes the pre-litigation process as it: (1)\r\ndefines the term \"expert witness\" and identifies the requisite qualifications;4 (2)\r\nidentifies the content of the expert witness affidavit;5 (3) extends the time for filing\r\nan expert witness affidavit when the statute of limitations will soon expire and\r\nauthorizes a defendant to move for dismissal of a plaintiff's case for failure to file\r\nan expert witness affidavit;6 (5) codifies the common knowledge exception;7 (6)\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Although section 15-79-125(D) states that \"[t]he circuit court has jurisdiction to\r\nenforce the provisions of this section,\" it provides no specific remedy or procedure.\r\n4   S.C. Code Ann. § 15-36-100(A)(1)-(3) (Supp. 2013).\r\n5   Id. § 15-36-100(B).\r\n6   Id. § 15-36-100(C)(1), (D).\r\n7 Id. § 15-36-100(C)(2) (\"The contemporaneous filing requirement of subsection\r\n(B) is not required to support a pleaded specification of negligence involving\r\n\noutlines the procedure for addressing allegedly defective affidavits;8 and (7)\r\nauthorizes the trial court to dismiss a plaintiff's case for non-compliance.9\r\n\r\n        Therefore, without incorporating all provisions of section 15-36-100 into\r\nsection 15-79-125, a plaintiff with a medical malpractice claim is: (1) deprived of\r\nthe forty-five day \"grace period\" for filing the affidavit, which is afforded in all\r\nother professional negligence cases; and (2) may only invoke the common\r\nknowledge exception at the pleading stage and not the pre-litigation stage.\r\nMoreover, by only applying selective provisions of section 15-36-100 to the pre-\r\nlitigation stage of a medical malpractice case, there is no mechanism for a\r\ndefendant to challenge the sufficiency of a plaintiff's pre-litigation affidavit or a\r\nremedy for a plaintiff's non-compliance with the pre-litigation requirements as\r\nsection 15-79-125 is silent on these issues. Furthermore, a plaintiff would be\r\nrequired to file two expert witness affidavits, i.e., one affidavit with the pre-\r\nlitigation NOI pursuant to section 15-79-125(A) and another affidavit with the\r\nComplaint pursuant to section 15-36-100(B).\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we expressly hold that section 15-79-125(A)'s\r\nreference to the \"affidavit requirements established in Section 15-36-100\"\r\nconstitutes an adoption of all provisions of section 15-36-100.\r\n\r\n               3.    Interpretation May Be Reconciled with Grier and Ross\r\n\r\n       Our holding is consistent with this Court's recent decisions in Grier v.\r\nAMISUB of South Carolina, Inc., 397 S.C. 532, 725 S.E.2d 693 (2012) and Ross v.\r\nWaccamaw Community Hospital, 404 S.C. 56, 744 S.E.2d 547 (2013). Although\r\nthere is language in Grier and Ross stating that sections 15-79-125 and 15-36-100\r\nare unambiguous and must be strictly construed, the Court's analysis in those cases\r\nis not as narrow as characterized by Dr. Crain.\r\n\r\n      In Grier, which was decided four months after Ranucci, Willie James Fee\r\ndied while in the care of AMISUB of South Carolina, Inc., d/b/a Piedmont Medical\r\nCenter (\"Piedmont\"). Grier, 397 S.C. at 534, 725 S.E.2d at 695. Prior to bringing\r\n\r\nsubject matter that lies within the ambit of common knowledge and experience, so \n\r\nthat no special learning is needed to evaluate the conduct of the defendant.\"). \n\r\n8   Id. § 15-36-100(E).\n\r\n9   Id. § 15-36-100(F). \n\r\n\na wrongful death and survival action against Piedmont stemming from medical\r\nmalpractice allegedly committed while it was treating Fee, the personal\r\nrepresentative filed an NOI as required by section 15-79-125(A). Id. Her claims\r\ncontended that Piedmont's failure to monitor and treat Fee for bedsores and sepsis\r\ncontributed to his death. Id. In conjunction with the NOI, the personal\r\nrepresentative contemporaneously filed an affidavit from a nurse with experience\r\ntreating bedsores and their complications. Id.\r\n\r\n       Piedmont filed a motion to dismiss on the ground the nurse was not qualified\r\nto render an opinion as to the cause of death, which meant the affidavit did not\r\ncontain a competent causation opinion. Id. at 535, 725 S.E.2d at 695. The circuit\r\ncourt agreed and granted Piedmont's motion to dismiss. Id. Despite being given\r\nthirty days to submit a qualifying affidavit, the personal representative failed to do\r\nso and the court dismissed her claim. Id.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, this Court considered the question of whether \"the pre-suit\r\naffidavit a plaintiff statutorily is required to file before bringing a medical\r\nmalpractice claim must contain an expert opinion on proximate cause.\" Id. at 535,\r\n725 S.E.2d at 695. In answering this question, Justice Hearn, writing for the Court,\r\noutlined the applicable provisions of sections 15-79-125(A) and 15-36-100. Id. at\r\n536-37, 725 S.E.2d at 695-96. Having found the terms of the statutes to be clear\r\nand unambiguous, the Court strictly construed the statutes and concluded \"section\r\n15-79-125(A) simply requires the contemporaneous filing of both the notice and\r\nthe affidavit.\" Id. at 539, 725 S.E.2d at 697.\r\n\r\n      The Court went on to explain, \"While this statute supplies several\r\nrequirements for the notice, it does not speak at all to what is required for the\r\naffidavit beyond stating that it is 'subject to the affidavit requirements established\r\nin Section 15-36-100.' \" Id. (quoting section 15-79-125(A)). The Court noted that\r\nsection 15-79-125(A) \"imposes no content requirements for the expert affidavit\r\nand specifically delegates that task to section 15-36-100.\" Id. The Court\r\nultimately held \"the expert affidavit required by sections 15-36-100 and 15-79-125\r\ndoes not need to contain an opinion as to proximate cause.\" Id. at 540, 725 S.E.2d\r\nat 698.Accordingly, the Court reversed the circuit court's order and remanded for\r\nfurther proceedings. Id. at 540-41, 725 S.E.2d at 698. The Court emphasized that\r\nits decision did not limit a plaintiff's burden to come forward with expert testimony\r\nto support the merits of his claims, if necessary, later in the process. Id. at 541,\r\n725 S.E.2d at 698. Instead, the Court noted that it \"merely [held] that sections 15-\r\n\n36-100 and 15-79-125 do not require an expert opinion as to causation to be\r\ncontained within the pre-filing affidavit.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Approximately one year after Grier, we issued our decision in Ross. In\r\nRoss, the Court addressed the penalties for failure to comply with the pre-litigation\r\nmediation requirement of section 15-79-125. Ross, 404 S.C. at 56, 744 S.E.2d at\r\n547. Justice Kittredge, writing for the Court, rejected the argument that\r\nnoncompliance mandated a penalty of dismissal for lack of subject matter\r\njurisdiction. Id. at 63, 744 S.E.2d at 551. In so ruling, the Court reasoned that the\r\nmediation time period set forth in section 15-79-125 was not intended to place\r\nlimitations on the circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction. Id. Instead, the Court\r\nheld that \"failing to comply with the 120-day statutory time period is a non-\r\njurisdictional procedural defect.\" Id. at 64, 744 S.E.2d at 551. The Court further\r\nfound \"the circuit court retains discretion to permit the mediation process to\r\ncontinue beyond the 120-day time period and may consider principles of estoppel\r\nand waiver to excuse non-compliance.\" Id. The Court clarified that the 120-day\r\ntime period for mediation was not meaningless and could result in dismissal. Id.\r\n\r\n        The Court, however, emphasized that a dismissal is \"a function of the court's\r\ndiscretion based on the facts and circumstances, and not as a mandated one-size-\r\nfits-all result.\" Id. The Court explained that \"the Legislature enacted section 15-\r\n79-125 to provide an informal and expedient method of culling prospective\r\nmedical malpractice cases by fostering the settlement of potentially meritorious\r\nclaims and discouraging the filing of frivolous claims.\" Id. at 63, 744 S.E.2d at\r\n550. Consequently, the Court expressly declined to \"construe section 15-79-125\r\nas a trap for plaintiffs with potentially meritorious claims.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       As evident from our decisions in Grier and Ross, this Court has sought to\r\ninterpret sections 15-79-125 and 15-36-100 in a manner that effectuates the intent\r\nof the General Assembly to establish a unique two-step procedure that filters\r\nfrivolous claims but permits the filing of potentially meritorious claims. Because\r\nthe pre-litigation filtering process is not meant as an impassable boundary that\r\ndenies a claimant access to the courts, we have attempted to \"avoid dismissal of\r\ncases on technical grounds and to allow adjudication on the merits.\" Ross, 404\r\nS.C. at 65, 744 S.E.2d at 551 (quoting Schulz v Nienhuis, 448 N.W.2d 655, 658\r\n(Wisc. 1989)). Accordingly, we believe a decision to reverse the Court of Appeals\r\nin the instant case is consistent with our holdings in Grier and Ross because the\r\ninclusion of all provisions in section 15-36-100 into section 15-79-125 gives\r\ncredence to the pre-litigation procedure but avoids the creation of \"a trap for\r\nplaintiffs with potentially meritorious claims.\" Id. at 63, 744 S.E.2d at 550.\r\n\n             4.    Viability of Ranucci's Case\r\n\r\n       Even if the Court incorporates section 15-36-100 in its entirety into section\r\n15-79-125 and accepts Ranucci's expert witness affidavit as timely, Dr. Crain\r\nasserts the circuit court's order should nevertheless be affirmed. In support of this\r\nassertion, Dr. Crain raises the following additional sustaining grounds10: (1) the\r\nNOI was filed outside of the three-year statute of limitations because it was filed\r\non June 8, 2009, which was three years and one day after the biopsy was\r\nperformed on June 7, 2006;11 (2) the expert witness affidavit is deficient as Dr.\r\nRichard Boortz-Marx, who is certified as an anesthesiologist, is not qualified to\r\nrender an opinion regarding the surgical procedure at issue; (3) the affidavit, which\r\nasserts that Dr. Crain failed to obtain informed consent from Ranucci, does not\r\nsupport the allegation regarding the negligent execution of the biopsy; and (4)\r\nRanucci failed to comply with the NOI statute as the parties did not engage in\r\nmandatory pre-suit mediation within the requisite 120-day time period.\r\n\r\n       We reject each of Dr. Crain's additional sustaining grounds. Initially, we\r\ndisagree with any assertion that the applicable statute of limitations began to run on\r\nthe day the biopsy was performed. We find Ranucci was put on notice that she had\r\na claim against Dr. Crain on June 10, 2006 when an X-ray revealed that she had\r\nsuffered a collapsed lung. See Dunbar v. Carlson, 341 S.C. 261, 266, 533 S.E.2d\r\n913, 915-16 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"The three-year statute of limitations begins to run\r\nwhen the facts and circumstances of the injury would put a person of common\r\n\r\n10 See Rule 220(c), SCACR (\"The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order,\r\ndecision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.\");\r\nI'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723\r\n(2000) (\"The appellate court may review respondent's additional reasons and, if\r\nconvinced it is proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason appearing\r\nin the record to affirm the lower court's judgment.\").\r\n11 See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-545(A) (2005) (\"In any action, other than actions\r\ncontrolled by subsection (B), to recover damages for injury to the person arising\r\nout of any medical, surgical, or dental treatment, omission, or operation by any\r\nlicensed health care provider as defined in Article 5, Chapter 79, Title 38 acting\r\nwithin the scope of his profession must be commenced within three years from the\r\ndate of the treatment, omission, or operation giving rise to the cause of action or\r\nthree years from date of discovery or when it reasonably ought to have been\r\ndiscovered, not to exceed six years from date of occurrence, or as tolled by this\r\nsection.\").\r\n\nknowledge and experience on notice that some right of hers has been invaded or\r\nthat some claim against a party might exist.\"). Thus, having found the NOI and\r\nexpert witness affidavit satisfied the pre-litigation requirements of section 15-79-\r\n125(A), Ranucci's lawsuit remains viable as the statute of limitations has been\r\ntolled during the pendency of this appeal.\r\n\r\n       As to Dr. Crain's assertions regarding defects in the authorship and content\r\nof Dr. Boortz-Marx's affidavit, we find this is not an appropriate ground to affirm\r\nthe circuit court's order because the affidavit is facially sufficient given it is sworn\r\nand identifies a potentially meritorious medical malpractice claim. Moreover,\r\nthere is no factual basis in the record to challenge either the expert's qualifications\r\nor the content of the affidavit. Cf. Poch v. Bayshore Concrete Prods./S.C., Inc.,\r\n405 S.C. 359, 378 n.13, 747 S.E.2d 757, 767 n.13 (2013) (declining to reject\r\naffidavit presented as proof of workers' compensation insurance as there was \"no\r\nbasis for which to reject the affidavit as it is by its very nature a sworn statement\r\nintended as documentary evidence in a legal proceeding\"). Thus, we conclude that\r\nany challenge to the alleged deficiencies would have to be made by Dr. Crain filing\r\nthe appropriate motion to dismiss in circuit court pursuant to section 15-36-100(E).\r\n\r\n      Finally, we find the failure to conduct mediation is not fatal to Ranucci's\r\ncase as the circuit court issued its order on September 23, 2009, which was 107\r\ndays after she filed her NOI on June 8, 2009. Had the case proceeded, the parties\r\ncould have engaged in mediation before the 120-day deadline. Ranucci should not\r\nbe penalized for failing to conduct mediation after her NOI was dismissed.\r\n\r\n                                  III.   Conclusion\r\n\r\n       As we interpret the statutes at issue in the context of the legislative history,\r\nwe conclude the General Assembly sought to promote tort reform by creating a\r\nmore efficient process in resolving all professional negligence cases by enacting\r\nsection 15-36-100. Because medical malpractice cases are generally the most\r\ncomplex professional negligence cases, the General Assembly created a unique\r\npre-litigation period of discovery and mandatory mediation via section 15-79-125\r\nin order to \"provide an informal and expedient method of culling prospective\r\nmedical malpractice cases by fostering the settlement of potentially meritorious\r\nclaims and discouraging the filing of frivolous claims.\" Ross, 404 S.C. at 63, 744\r\nS.E.2d at 550. Even though the General Assembly created a distinct two-step\r\nprocedure for medical malpractice cases, the first step of the procedure cannot\r\noperate unless all provisions of section 15-36-100 are utilized. Thus, section 15-\r\n\n36-100 must be incorporated in its entirety into section 15-79-125 as such a\r\nreading harmonizes the statutes and effectuates the purpose of the statutes.\r\n\r\n       Having found that section 15-79-125 incorporates section 15-36-100 in its\r\nentirety, we hold that Ranucci should have been permitted to invoke section 15-36-\r\n100(C)(1), which extended the time for filing the expert witness affidavit and\r\ntolled the applicable statute of limitations under section 15-79-125(A).\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case\r\nto the circuit court for the parties to resume the proceedings by conducting\r\nmediation as mandated by section 15-79-125.\r\n\r\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n      TOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent. While I do not agree completely\r\nwith the Court of Appeals, I do agree that S.C. Code Ann. § 15-79-125(A) (Supp.\r\n2013) requires a potential medical malpractice plaintiff to file an expert witness\r\naffidavit contemporaneously with her Notice of Intent to File Suit (NOI). I first\r\nexplain my construction of § 15-79-125, the medical malpractice pre-litigation\r\nstatute and of S.C. Code Ann. § 15-36-100 (Supp. 2013), the professional\r\nnegligence complaint statute. I then explain why I do not agree with the majority's\r\nreading of these two statutes.\r\n\r\n     A. Statutory Construction\r\n\r\nAs the Court of Appeals correctly stated, the medical malpractice pre-litigation\r\nstatute, § 15-79-125, and the professional negligence complaint statute, § 15-36-\r\n100, operate \"in distinct time frames. . . . .\" Ranucci v. Crain, 397 S.C. 168, 176,\r\n723 S.E.2d 242, 247 (Ct. App. 2012). The medical malpractice statute requires the\r\ncontemporaneous filing of a pre-complaint pre-litigation expert witness affidavit\r\nalong with the NOI. § 15-79-125(A). The filing and service of these two\r\ndocuments, along with limited discovery and mandatory mediation, are\r\nprerequisites to \"filing or initiating a civil action [alleging] medical malpractice. . .\r\n.\" § 15-79-125. The professional negligence complaint statute, § 15-36-100, on\r\nthe other hand, is concerned with the expert affidavit that must, in most\r\ncircumstances, accompany a complaint alleging professional negligence. There is\r\nno inherent conflict in the independent operation of these two statutes, one of\r\nwhich requires that a specific type of professional negligence claim go through a\r\npre-complaint pre-litigation process.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medical malpractice pre-litigation statute and the professional negligence\r\ncomplaint statute reference each other and thus we must interpret them in tandem.\r\nThe medical malpractice pre-litigation statute provides the expert affidavit\r\naccompanying the NOI is \"subject to the affidavit requirements established in\r\nSection 15-36-100,\" the professional negligence complaint statute. I would hold\r\nthis reference in § 15-79-125(A) incorporates only the provisions of § 15-36-\r\n100(A) which define \"expert\" for purposes of the professional negligence\r\ncomplaint affidavit requirement. My conclusion that only subsection (A) of § 15-\r\n36-100 is relevant to § 15-79-125's medical malpractice pre-litigation affidavit\r\nrequirement is confirmed by § 15-36-100(B).12 Subsection (B), which requires that\r\n\r\n The Court of Appeals would import some but not all of (B) into § 15-79-125.\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is where I part ways with that court's decision. Further, my analysis requires a\r\n\na professional negligence complaint be accompanied by an expert affidavit, begins\r\n\"Except as provided in Section 15-79-125. . . .\" In my opinion, this exception of\r\nthe medical malpractice pre-litigation statute from § 15-36-100(B)'s\r\ncontemporaneous complaint/affidavit requirement must be read to mean that\r\nmedical malpractice complaints in cases that have been processed in accordance\r\nwith § 15-75-125 are not subject to the expert witness affidavit requirements of the\r\nprofessional negligence complaint statute. I would find the legislature exempted\r\nthese medical malpractice complaints from the expert witness affidavit requirement\r\nin § 15-36-100(B) because such an affidavit has already been provided at the NOI\r\nstage, and because the parties have already narrowed the issues through the pre-\r\nlitigation process required by § 15-75-125.\r\n\r\nUnder my reading of § 15-36-100(B), there is no requirement that medical\r\nmalpractice complaints be accompanied by an expert affidavit. It follows, then,\r\nthat the grace period found in § 15-36-100(C)(1) and the common knowledge\r\nexception of § 15-36-100(C)(2), which by their own terms apply only to \"the\r\ncontemporaneous [complaint and expert affidavit] filing requirements of § 15-36-\r\n100(B),\" are irrelevant in a medical malpractice case. I therefore agree with the\r\nCourt of Appeals that since Ranucci did not file an expert affidavit along with her\r\nNOI, her NOI was properly dismissed.\r\n\r\n   B. The Majority's Reasoning\r\n\r\nThe majority advances four reasons to support its conclusion that the provisions of\r\n§ 15-36-100 must be incorporated wholesale into § 15-79-125. As explained\r\nbelow, I do not find any of the reasons support the majority's interpretation of the\r\ntwo statutes. I note at the outset that the majority does not undertake to explain its\r\nunderstanding of the \"Except as provided in § 15-79-125\" language that begins §\r\n15-36-100(B), language that is critical to my construction of the two statutes.\r\n\r\n The majority first asserts that without the wholesale incorporation of the\r\nprofessional negligence complaint statute into the medical malpractice pre-\r\nlitigation statute, a medical malpractice plaintiff is deprived of the forty-five day\r\ngrace period found in § 15-36-100(C)(1). The purpose of this grace period is to\r\ntoll the statute of limitations when a professional negligence plaintiff files her\r\ncomplaint within ten days of the running of the statute in order to allow her time to\r\n\r\nmodification of our decision in Grier v. AMISUB of South Carolina, Inc., 397 S.C.\r\n532, 725 S.E.2d 693 (2012) which applied subsection B to the pre-litigation\r\naffidavit.\r\n\nprocure an expert affidavit. The majority fails to acknowledge that in a medical\r\nmalpractice case the statute is tolled much earlier, that is, when the NOI and expert\r\nwitness affidavit are filed under the medical malpractice pre-litigation statute\r\nwhich states the contemporaneous filing of these two documents \"tolls all\r\napplicable statutes of limitations.\" § 15-79-125(A). Moreover, under § 15-36-\r\n100(C)(1), the forty-five day grace period does not commence until \"the filing of\r\nthe complaint,\" an event which cannot occur in a medical malpractice action until\r\nafter the NOI and its affidavit have been filed, discovery materials exchanged, and\r\nmediation attempted. See § 15-79-125(E). I do not agree that the lack of a \"grace\r\nperiod\" in the medical malpractice pre-litigation statute, which contains its own\r\ntolling provision, mandates that we implant this separate, more limited tolling\r\nprovision from the professional negligence complaint statute. Further, under my\r\nreading of § 15-36-100(B) the medical malpractice plaintiff is exempt from the\r\nrequirement that her complaint be accompanied by an expert witness affidavit, and\r\ntherefore she will never have need of the grace period found in §15-36-100 (C)(1).\r\n\r\nThe majority next expresses concern that unless we hold that § 15-36-100(C)(2) is\r\nincorporated into § 15-79-125, a medical malpractice plaintiff need always produce\r\nan expert witness affidavit at the NOI stage, even if her claim otherwise falls\r\nwithin the common knowledge exception. I do not understand why the\r\nrequirement that an expert affidavit accompany every medical malpractice NOI,\r\neven where the subject matter is within a layperson's common knowledge, leads to\r\nthe conclusion that the pre-litigation statute must be read to include the same\r\nexception as found in the complaint affidavit statute. I am not aware of any rule\r\nthat prohibits the legislature from imposing an expert affidavit requirement as a\r\nthreshold matter in a medical malpractice situation even if at trial no expert\r\ntestimony will be required. Moreover, the majority does not explain how § 15-36-\r\n100(C)(2), which allows a plaintiff to invoke the common knowledge exception if\r\nher \"pleaded specification of negligence\" meets the criteria, can be applied where\r\nthere is only a NOI, but no pleading. See Rule 7(a), SCRCP ( pleadings do not\r\ninclude NOI).\r\n\r\nAs a third reason to incorporate all of § 15-36-100 into § 15-79-125 the majority\r\nasserts that absent such incorporation, there is no mechanism for a defendant to\r\nchallenge the plaintiff's compliance with the medical malpractice pre-litigation\r\nstatute. I disagree, and need only point to the present matter before the Court as\r\nproof. The provision allowing the present pre-litigation challenge is § 15-79-\r\n125(D), which states \"The circuit court has jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of\r\nthis section.\" Under this subsection of the medical malpractice pre-litigation\r\nstatute, for example, a court could require a plaintiff to file her standard\r\n\ninterrogatories under § 15-79-125(A), or compel either party to comply with a\r\nsubpoena issued pursuant to § 15-79-125(B). Under the majority's view, however,\r\nif a medical malpractice plaintiff failed to file the pre-litigation affidavit required\r\nby § 15-79-125(A), filed a non-compliant one, or refused to participate in\r\ndiscovery, then the defendant would be powerless to do anything until the plaintiff\r\nfiled her complaint, since it is only at that juncture that the sanctions in the\r\nprofessional negligence complaint statute can be invoked. See §15-36-100 (C)(1),\r\n(E), (F). Requiring a defendant to wait until litigation has commenced to compel\r\nthe medical malpractice complainant to comply with § 15-79-125 negates the\r\nentire pre-litigation scheme created by that statute. Moreover, the majority's\r\ndecision to incorporate the remedial portions of § 15-36-100, all of which address\r\nonly the plaintiff's obligations when commencing her suit, ignores the fact that\r\nunder the medical malpractice pre-litigation statute obligations are placed on both\r\nthe plaintiff and the defendant. If the majority is correct, and the exclusive\r\nremedies for failure to comply with the medical malpractice pre-litigation statute\r\nare those found in § 15-36-100(C)(1), (E), and (F), then the medical malpractice\r\nplaintiff is without any remedy should her defendant fail to meet its obligations\r\nunder § 15-79-125.\r\n\r\nFinally, the majority explains that unless we incorporate all of § 15-36-100 into §\r\n15-79-125, \"a plaintiff would be required to file two expert witness affidavits, i.e.,\r\none with the pre-litigation NOI pursuant to § 15-79-125(A) and another affidavit\r\nwith the complaint pursuant to Section 15-36-100(B).\" As explained above, I\r\nbelieve the first clause of § 15-36-100(B), \"Except as provided in Section 15-79-\r\n125,\" relieves a medical malpractice plaintiff from filing an expert affidavit along\r\nwith her complaint. Even if the medical malpractice plaintiff were required to file\r\nan expert witness affidavit at two separate points in the litigation, I do not agree\r\nthat such a seemingly unnecessary step requires that we construe the statutes as\r\nwould the majority.\r\n\r\nI respectfully dissent and would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as\r\nmodified.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27424","title":"State Accident Fund v.

We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n                       FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       Claimant suffered an accidental injury to his left knee on August 17, 2007,\r\nwhile working as a police officer with the Manning Police Department. As a\r\nresult, Claimant was treated using various non-operative methods, including\r\nsteroid injections. In January 2008, Claimant reached maximum medical\r\nimprovement (MMI) and was assigned a 32% permanent impairment rating to his\r\nlower left extremity. However, in April 2008, Claimant returned to the doctor\r\nbecause he continued to experience swelling and pain in his left knee. Ultimately,\r\nClaimant underwent knee replacement surgery. Claimant continued to experience\r\nswelling and pain in his left knee, and Claimant followed up with the orthopaedic\r\ncenter for several months after the surgery.\r\n\r\n      At the time of his injury, Claimant suffered from preexisting diabetes, which\r\nClaimant's employer was aware of prior to the injury. Claimant experienced\r\nproblems with his diabetes for years before the accident and required medication to\r\ncontrol the condition.1 Claimant's diabetes was medically controlled around the\r\ntime of the injury; however, Claimant's diabetes was uncontrolled on several\r\noccasions during the course of his knee treatment.\r\n\r\n      Claimant's primary care physician, Dr. William Aldrich, opined that\r\nClaimant's injury \"most probably aggravate[d] the diabetes\" and resulted in\r\n\"substantially greater medical costs\" than would have occurred from the injury\r\nalone. However, in Dr. Aldrich's opinion, the aggravation of Claimant's diabetes\r\n\"most probably\" did not result in \"substantially greater time lost from work\" or\r\n\"substantially greater disability\" than would have occurred from the injury alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n1For example, Claimant suffered tingling in his right foot which only subsided\r\nafter removing his shoe. In addition, Claimant was prescribed shoes made\r\nespecially for diabetics.\r\n\n        The workers' compensation carrier, Appellant, filed a claim for partial\r\nreimbursement from Respondent, alleging that it incurred substantially greater\r\nliability for compensation benefits and medical benefits because Claimant's\r\npreexisting diabetes was aggravated by his work-related injury. Respondent\r\ndenied that the claim met the requirements of the statute governing reimbursement.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-400 (Supp. 2013).2\r\n\r\n        South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commissioner T. Scott Beck (the\r\nSingle Commissioner) held a hearing on this matter on September 27, 2011.\r\nThereafter, the Single Commissioner filed an order denying Appellant's claim for\r\nreimbursement and dismissing the claim with prejudice. The Single Commissioner\r\nconcluded that Appellant \"had the burden to prove that Claimant's preexisting\r\ndiabetes was permanent and serious enough to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to\r\nClaimant's employment,\" but also found that \"the evidence in the record rebuts the\r\npresumption that Claimant's diabetes was a hindrance to his employment.\" In\r\naddition, the Single Commissioner determined that Appellant did not prove that\r\n\"Claimant's preexisting diabetes created substantially greater lost time from work\r\nand permanent disability than would have resulted from the work injury alone\"\r\nbased upon his findings that \"[t]he evidence in the record does not indicate a\r\nfluctuation in blood sugars, a modification in diabetic medication or delayed post-\r\nsurgical healing\" and that \"the medical records reveal that Claimant was written\r\nout of work for only three (3) days immediately after the work injury.\" Therefore,\r\nthe Single Commissioner denied Appellant's claim for reimbursement, concluding\r\nthat it did not meet the standard of reimbursement in section 42-9-400.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, the Commission affirmed the Single Commissioner's order in its\r\nentirety.3 Appellant appealed the Commission's order to the court of appeals. This\r\nCourt certified the appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n2Subject to detailed provisions of the statute, section 42-9-400 provides that if an\r\nemployee with a permanent physical impairment suffers a subsequent injury by\r\naccident arising out of and in the course of his employment, the Second Injury\r\nFund must reimburse the employer or his insurance carrier for compensation and\r\nmedical benefits. S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-400.\r\n3 One commissioner dissented, asserting that she would find the evidence did not\r\nrebut the presumption that Claimant's diabetes was a hindrance or obstacle to\r\nemployment and that instead, the evidence supported the conclusion that\r\nClaimant's injury aggravated his diabetes and resulted in increased medical costs.\r\n\n                                       ISSUE\r\n\r\n      Whether the Commission erred in denying Appellant's claim for\r\n      reimbursement for Claimant's medical payments under section 42-9-\r\n      400?4                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       The South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (the APA) sets forth the\r\nstandard for judicial review of decisions by the Commission.

Therefore, the Second Injury Fund serves to fully\r\ncompensate disabled employees for work-related injuries without penalizing an\r\nemployer if the employer is subject to greater liability because of the employee's\r\npreexisting condition. Liberty Mut., 318 S.C. at 518, 458 S.E.2d at 551; Springs\r\nIndus., 296 S.C. at 361, 372 S.E.2d at 916.\r\n\r\n      Section 42-9-400(a) of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\n\r\n4Appellant does not challenge the Commission's decision to deny reimbursement\r\nfor Claimant's compensation benefits.\r\n\n        If an employee who has a permanent physical impairment from any\r\n        cause or origin incurs a subsequent disability from injury by accident\r\n        arising out of and in the course of his employment resulting in\r\n        compensation and medical payments liability or either, for disability\r\n        that is substantially greater and is caused by aggravation of the\r\n        preexisting impairment than that which would have resulted from the\r\n        subsequent injury alone, the employer or his insurance carrier shall\r\n        pay all awards of compensation and medical benefits provided by this\r\n        title; but such employer or his insurance carrier shall be reimbursed\r\n        from the Second Injury Fund . . . for compensation and medical\r\n        benefits . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-400(a).\r\n\r\n       \"[P]ermanent physical impairment\" is defined as a \"permanent condition,\r\nwhether congenital or due to injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute\r\na hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if\r\nthe employee should become unemployed.\" Id. § 42-9-400(d). When an employer\r\nestablishes prior knowledge of the employee's permanent condition, \"then there\r\nshall be a presumption that the condition is permanent and that a hindrance or\r\nobstacle to employment or reemployment exists,\" but only if the condition is one\r\nof thirty-two conditions listed in the statute. Id. (emphasis added). Diabetes is one\r\nsuch condition. Id. § 42-9-400(d)(2).\r\n\r\n   I.      Presumption Under Section 42-9-400(d)\r\n\r\n       First, Appellant argues that the Commission erred by incorrectly applying\r\nthe presumption found in section 42-9-400(d). In its findings of fact, the\r\nCommission stated that \"[t]hough [Appellant] is entitled to a presumption that\r\nClaimant's preexisting diabetes was a hindrance to employment, the medical\r\nevidence in the record rebuts this presumption.\" However, inconsistent with this\r\nfinding of fact, the Commission stated in its conclusions of law that \"[t]o qualify\r\nfor reimbursement, [Appellant] had the burden to prove that Claimant's preexisting\r\ndiabetes was permanent and serious enough to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to\r\nClaimant's employment.\" Appellant further contends that the Commission erred in\r\nconcluding that Appellant had the burden of proof because it was entitled to a\r\npresumption that Claimant's preexisting diabetes constituted a \"permanent physical\r\nimpairment.\" We agree.\r\n\n       A presumption is a \"legal inference or assumption that a fact exists, based on\r\nthe known or proven existence of some other fact or group of facts.\" Black's Law\r\nDictionary 1304 (9th ed. 2009). \"A presumption shifts the burden of production or\r\npersuasion to the opposing party, who can then attempt to overcome the\r\npresumption.\" Id. Appellant presented facts sufficient to support the application\r\nof the presumption under section 42-9-400(d).\r\n\r\n       Therefore, we find that Appellant was entitled to a presumption that\r\nClaimant's diabetes was permanent and constituted a hindrance or obstacle to his\r\nemployment or reemployment. Because the Commission's order incorrectly sets\r\nforth the burden of proof in its law section, we hold that the Commission's order is\r\nerroneous as a matter of law. See S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-280 (providing that the\r\nCourt may reverse a decision of the Commission if it is affected by an error of\r\nlaw).\r\n\r\n   II.   Rebuttal of the Presumption\r\n\r\n      Because Appellant was entitled to the presumption, the burden to rebut the\r\npresumption then shifted to Respondent. The Commission concluded that \"the\r\nevidence in the record rebutted the presumption that Claimant's preexisting\r\ndiabetes was a hindrance to his employment.\" Therefore, we must determine\r\nwhether Respondent, in fact, presented evidence which rebutted the presumption.\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that the Commission erred in concluding that Respondent\r\nrebutted the presumption provided under section 42-9-400(d). We agree.\r\n\r\n       When a presumption shifts the burden of production to the opposing party,\r\nthat party must present substantial evidence in order to rebut the presumption. See\r\n100A C.J.S. Workers' Compensation § 1029 (2014) (\"Because a fact must be\r\nproved with substantial evidence in a workers' compensation proceeding, a\r\nrebuttable presumption must be met with substantial evidence.\").\r\n\r\n       In deciding whether there was evidence to rebut the presumption that the\r\nClaimant suffered a \"permanent physical impairment,\" the Commission focused on\r\nmedical evidence indicating that prior to the injury, Claimant's diabetes was\r\nmedically managed and was not uncontrolled or problematic. The Commission\r\nrelied on this evidence in discussing whether Claimant's preexisting diabetes was a\r\nhindrance to Claimant's employment at the time of his injury, not whether it was a\r\nhindrance to obtaining employment, as the statute requires. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n42-9-400(d) (defining \"permanent physical impairment\" as a permanent condition\r\n\nconstituting \"a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining\r\nreemployment if the employee should become unemployed\" (emphasis added));\r\nSprings Indus., 296 S.C. at 362, 363–64, 372 S.E.2d at 917 (concluding that an\r\nemployee's chronic cough and breathing difficulties caused by exposure to cotton\r\ndust would be a hindrance to obtaining employment); see also State v. Scott, 351\r\nS.C. 584, 588, 571 S.E.2d 700, 702 (1993) (\"What a legislature says in the text of a\r\nstatute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will.\" (citation\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\n       The Commission also relied on medical evidence suggesting that post-\r\nsurgery, Claimant's diabetes was successfully managed with medication and that\r\nhis left knee was responding well to treatment. This view of the evidence fails to\r\nconsider the substantial evidence in the record indicating the significant symptoms\r\nand problems Claimant experienced after his work-related injury. According to the\r\nmedical records, Claimant's diabetes caused tingling in his foot which did not\r\nsubside until he removed his shoe, and Claimant required special shoes and\r\nmedication to control his diabetes. The evidence in the record actually supports\r\nthe presumption that Claimant's diabetes constituted a hindrance or obstacle to\r\nobtaining employment or reemployment as a police officer. Accordingly, the\r\nCommission's conclusion that the evidence rebutted the presumption is clearly\r\nerroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the record. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n1-23-380 (providing that the Court may reverse a decision of the Commission if it\r\nis clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the record as a whole).\r\n\r\n   III.   Increased Medical Costs\r\n\r\n      Finally, Appellant argues it satisfied section 42-9-400 by proving that the\r\naggravation of Claimant's preexisting diabetes resulted in substantially increased\r\nmedical costs, and therefore, the Commission erred in denying Appellant\r\nreimbursement under section 42-9-400(a). We agree.\r\n\r\n       Section 42-9-400(a) provides that the Second Injury Fund must reimburse a\r\ncarrier for medical payments when an employee with a preexisting condition incurs\r\na subsequent disability from a work-related injury \"resulting in compensation and\r\nmedical payments liability, or either, for disability that is substantially greater and\r\nis caused by aggravation of the preexisting impairment than that which would have\r\nresulted from the subsequent injury alone . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-400(a).\r\nSubsection (a)(2) specifies the details of reimbursement of medical payments,\r\nstating that \"an employer or carrier must establish that his liability for medical\r\npayments is substantially greater by reason of the aggravation of the preexisting\r\n\nimpairment than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-400(a)(2) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      In conforming to the purpose of the Second Injury Fund, section 42-9-400(a)\r\nprovides for reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund when—subsequent to a\r\nwork-related injury—the aggravation of a preexisting permanent impairment\r\ncauses substantially greater liability for compensation or medical payments than\r\nwould have resulted from the work-related injury alone. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-\r\n9-400(a); Liberty Mut., 318 S.C. at 519, 485 S.E.2d at 551–52.\r\n\r\n        Section 42-9-400 provides for reimbursement of medical payments even\r\nwhen there is not increased liability for compensation. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-\r\n400(a); Liberty Mut., 318 S.C. at 519, 485 S.E.2d at 551–52. In Liberty Mutual,\r\nwe held that a carrier was entitled to reimbursement for medical payments where\r\nthe carrier was liable for greater medical payments—but not greater compensation\r\npayments—because of an employee's preexisting diabetes. 318 S.C. at 519, 458\r\nS.E.2d at 551. The employee was paralyzed by a work-related accident and was\r\nrendered totally and permanently disabled for workers' compensation purposes. Id.\r\nat 517, 458 S.E.2d at 551. The employee's preexisting diabetes aggravated his\r\nparalysis, causing him to undergo a double amputation. Id. The Second Injury\r\nFund argued that section 42-9-400(a) required the employee to suffer greater\r\ndisability, in addition to increased medical payments, for the carrier to receive any\r\nreimbursement. Id. at 518, 458 S.E.2d at 551. Although we found that the carrier\r\nwas not entitled to reimbursement of compensation payments because the accident\r\nrendered the employee totally disabled and thus the employee's diabetes did not\r\nincrease the compensation payments, we held that the carrier incurred greater\r\nliability for the employee's medical payments because of the diabetes, and was\r\ntherefore entitled to reimbursement for medical payments under section 42-9-400.\r\nId. at 519, 485 S.E.2d at 551–52.\r\n\r\n       The Commission denied Appellant's claim for reimbursement in full.\r\nWithout mentioning medical payments, the Commission stated that \"Claimant's\r\npreexisting diabetes did not create substantially greater liability for permanent\r\ndisability nor did it result in substantially greater lost time from work.\" However,\r\nthese facts fall under the compensation liability prong of the statute. In its order,\r\nthe Commission ignored Dr. Aldrich's expert opinion that Claimant's injury most\r\nprobably aggravated his diabetes and resulted in substantially greater medical costs\r\nthan would have resulted from his work-related injury alone. Respondent\r\npresented no evidence or expert opinion that contradicted Dr. Aldrich's statement\r\nconcerning medical costs. Therefore, based on the fact that the medical evidence\r\n\nsupports the conclusion that the Claimant's work-related injury aggravated his\r\ndiabetes and resulted in increased medical costs, we hold that Appellant satisfied\r\nthe requirements of section 42-9-400(a), and the Commission's decision to deny\r\nAppellant's claim for reimbursement of medical payments is clearly erroneous\r\nbased on the evidence.5            CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       For the foregoing reasons, the Commission's decision denying Appellant\r\nreimbursement for Claimant's medical payments is reversed and remanded for the\r\nCommission to determine the amount of reimbursement to which Appellant is\r\nentitled.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5Although Dr. Aldrich opined that aggravation of Claimant's diabetes most\r\nprobably did not result in substantially greater time lost from work or substantially\r\ngreater disability than would have occurred from the injury alone, reimbursement\r\nfor increased medical payments is an important aspect of the Second Injury Fund\r\nand section 42-9-400, regardless of a preexisting condition's effect on\r\ncompensation payments.

Stampfle, Esquire, of Stampfle Law Firm, LLC,\r\n            of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office\r\nof Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\ndisbarment. Respondent requests the disbarment be imposed retroactively to\r\nFebruary 19, 2014, the date of his interim suspension. In the Matter of Taylor, 407\r\nS.C. 168, 754 S.E.2d 714 (2014). In addition, respondent agrees to pay the costs\r\nincurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) within thirty (30) days of the\r\nimposition of a sanction and, further, to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\nProgram Ethics School, Trust Account School, and Law Office Management\r\nSchool prior to seeking readmission. We accept the Agreement and disbar\r\nrespondent from the practice of law in this state, retroactive to the date of his\r\ninterim suspension, and impose additional conditions as set forth hereafter in this\r\nopinion. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\n                                     Matter I\r\n\r\nComplainant A hired respondent to represent him in a child support modification\r\naction. Respondent charged Complainant A a flat fee of $1,500.00 for attorney's\r\nfees as reflected in the fee agreement. Respondent's affidavit of attorney's fees\r\npresented to the court requested attorney's fees in the amount of $1,687.50, more\r\nthan the total fee in the agreement. In addition, the affidavit states \"[u]pon\r\nPlaintiff's retaining of Affiant, Plaintiff was informed by the office that he would\r\nbe charged an hourly rate of Two Hundred Twenty-Five and No/100s ($225.00)\r\nDollars per hour for attorney time.\" However, respondent's fee agreement makes\r\nno mention of an hourly rate to be charged for his services.\r\n\r\nRespondent filed a Motion for Temporary Relief seeking modification of child\r\nsupport. A hearing was convened on February 17, 2010. The judge denied the\r\nrequest for modification, ordered a case from Lexington County (in which an\r\nOrder and Rule to Show Cause hearing had been scheduled to address delinquent\r\nchild support by Complainant A) be transferred to Horry County and ordered the\r\nparties to submit the issues to mediation.\r\n\r\nMediation was not held. Complainant A's Rule to Show Cause was transferred to\r\nHorry County and a hearing was held on April 16, 2010, at which time\r\nComplainant A was held in civil contempt and ordered to pay $6,540.32 to purge\r\nthe contempt.\r\n\r\nComplainant A filed a complaint with ODC on June 18, 2010, alleging respondent\r\nengaged in misconduct in several aspects. He alleged respondent made promises\r\nhe did not keep, failed to communicate with him, gave him bad advice, and failed\r\nto act diligently on his behalf. Several of Complainant A's allegations are without\r\nmerit with regard to respondent's efforts on Complainant A's behalf in the\r\nunderlying action. However, during the course of the investigation, respondent\r\nfabricated evidence to present to ODC in an effort to demonstrate communications\r\nwith his client.\r\n\r\nIn a supplemental response to the Notice of Investigation, respondent provided\r\nODC with copies of several letters allegedly sent by him to Complainant A.\r\nInvestigation by ODC revealed several of these letters were falsified. In particular,\r\ntwo letters, one dated October 15, 2009, and one dated November 6, 2009,\r\n\ncontained a caption number that was not assigned to the case until December 28,\r\n2009.1 Therefore, those letters could not have been written in October or\r\nNovember 2009.\r\n\r\nRespondent admits these letters were completely fabricated and backdated. He\r\nadmits he created these letters for the purpose of demonstrating to ODC that he\r\nwas diligent and communicative in his representation of Complainant A.\r\n\r\nIn addition, respondent submitted a letter dated February 19, 2010, allegedly\r\nwritten by him to Complainant A. This letter purports to discuss what happened at\r\nthe hearing on February 17, 2010. However, the letter references events that were\r\nnot discussed until the hearing on April 16, 2010. Respondent created the letter for\r\npurposes of the disciplinary investigation, again to demonstrate diligence and\r\ncommunication.                      Matter II\r\n\r\nIn October 2013, Complainant B hired respondent to represent her in a divorce\r\naction. At a meeting on October 19, 2013, Complainant B paid respondent $900,\r\n$750 of which was for attorney's fees and $150 of which was for costs.\r\nComplainant B and respondent went over the complaint respondent had drafted\r\nand discussed serving Complainant B's husband. Complainant B informed\r\nrespondent that the marital residence was in foreclosure proceedings and that, after\r\nthe foreclosure hearing, her husband would be difficult to serve.\r\n\r\nThroughout the remainder of 2013 and the beginning of 2014, Complainant B\r\ncalled respondent's office several times to inquire whether her husband had been\r\nserved. The process server was unsuccessful in serving the husband.\r\n\r\nThe last time Complainant B spoke to respondent's receptionist was on January 13,\r\n2014. She called approximately twice a day for the next couple of weeks and\r\nnever received an answer or a return call. Complainant B went by respondent's\r\noffice on January 17, 2014, and January 24, 2014, but it was closed and locked on\r\nboth occasions. Respondent did not serve Complainant B's husband with the\r\ncomplaint and did not inform Complainant B that he was closing his office.\r\n\r\n1 Further, respondent filed two separate matters with different action numbers on\r\nDecember 9, 2009. Respondent placed the incorrect action number on the letters at\r\nissue in Complainant A's matter.\r\n\nComplainant B could not retain a new attorney as respondent was still the attorney\r\nof record and she could not find him in order to obtain a release of representation.\r\n\r\nAs a result of abandoning his office, the Court placed respondent on interim\r\nsuspension on February 19, 2014. Id.    Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act\r\nwith reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer\r\nshall keep client reasonably informed about status of matter); Rule 1.16 (upon\r\ntermination of representation, lawyer shall take steps to extent reasonably\r\npracticable to protect clients' interests); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable\r\nefforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of client); Rule 8.1 (in\r\nconnection with disciplinary matter, lawyer shall not knowingly make false\r\nstatement of material fact); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to\r\nengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and\r\nRule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct\r\nprejudicial to administration of justice). Respondent further admits he violated the\r\nLawyer's Oath as contained in Rule 402(k), SCACR.\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (it\r\nshall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute\r\nthe administration of justice or to bring courts or legal profession into disrepute or\r\nconduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to violate the oath of office taken to practice law\r\nin this state and contained in Rule 402(k), SCACR).\r\n\r\n                                    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from\r\nthe practice of law in this state, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.\r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay ODC and\r\nthe Commission the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this\r\nmatter. Respondent shall not apply for readmission until he has completed the\r\nLegal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School, Trust Account School, and Law\r\n\nOffice Management School. Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion,\r\nrespondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has\r\ncomplied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his\r\nCertificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27426","title":"In the Matter of James W.

Although the underlying question of respondent's cooperation was\r\nresolved, respondent acknowledged to the court that his office files and accounts\r\nwere not in good order as a result of personnel issues. Concerned, the judge\r\nreported respondent to ODC.\r\n\r\nRespondent did not respond to ODC's written request for six months of trust\r\naccount records or a written reminder of the outstanding request. ODC then issued\r\na subpoena to respondent for ten months of his trust account records. Through\r\ncounsel, respondent provided partial bank statements for the six months originally\r\nrequested. He did not provide any receipt and disbursement journals, client\r\nledgers, or reconciliation reports as demanded in the subpoena, records he was\r\nrequired to maintain pursuant to Rule 417, SCACR.\r\n\r\nWhile ODC was trying to obtain respondent's Rule 417 records, respondent wrote\r\nhimself a trust account check for earned fees; the check was returned for\r\nnonsufficient funds. Respondent issued and negotiated the check immediately\r\nafter depositing the client's corresponding check into his trust account on a Friday\r\nafternoon. Although the client's check met the definition of good funds,\r\nrespondent admits he should not have drawn against the deposit immediately\r\nbecause he was informed by bank staff and a note on the deposit receipt that the\r\nfunds would not be available until the next business day, a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nRespondent did not respond to the Notice of Investigation concerning the non-\r\nsufficient funds until after receiving a reminder letter. In addition to being\r\nuntimely, respondent's response was incomplete and did not include all of the\r\nrecords requested. ODC again requested, but did not receive, the missing records.\r\nRespondent did not provide the records because he did not have them, but his\r\nfailure to explain this fact prolonged the investigation. Although his trust account\r\nhad little activity and there is no indication of misappropriation, respondent was\r\nnot keeping adequate records as required by Rule 417, SCACR.\r\n\n                                    Matter II\r\n\r\nOn October 14, 2010, John Doe retained respondent to represent him on charges of\r\nspeeding, driving under suspension, second offense, and presenting a suspended\r\ndriver's license. Respondent received notice from the court for a docket sounding\r\nscheduled for May 2, 2011. Mr. Doe and two of respondent's other clients were on\r\nthe docket, but respondent failed to place Mr. Doe's appearance on his calendar\r\nand, thus, failed to notify Mr. Doe of the appearance.\r\n\r\nRespondent appeared for the docket sounding and realized Mr. Doe's case was on\r\nthe docket. He then confused Mr. Doe's file with that of another client.\r\nRespondent attempted to contact the other client, but the client's phone number was\r\nno longer in service. Respondent negotiated a plea that included dismissal of Mr.\r\nDoe's charge of presenting a suspended driver's license and advised the court of the\r\nplea agreement. Respondent incorrectly advised the court that he had discussed the\r\nplea with Mr. Doe. The court accepted the plea and sentenced Mr. Doe to sixty\r\ndays imprisonment or payment of a fine. Additionally, at respondent's request, the\r\ncourt granted Mr. Doe fifteen days to establish a payment plan. Respondent told\r\nthe court he would write Mr. Doe a letter advising him of the plea and the deadline\r\nto set up the payment plan, but failed to send the letter.\r\n\r\nMr. Doe learned of his convictions when he received a letter in the mail from the\r\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles discussing his driving privileges as a result of the\r\nconvictions. After several unsuccessful attempts to reach respondent, Mr. Doe\r\ncontacted the court and explained what happened. The Court permitted Mr. Doe to\r\nset up a payment plan for the fine and court costs. The guilty pleas were reopened\r\nat respondent's request and the driving under suspension charge was ultimately\r\ndismissed and expunged.\r\n\r\nDuring ODC's investigation, respondent failed to respond to a request for\r\nadditional information until he received multiple reminders.\r\n\n                                     Matter III\r\n\r\nIn ten additional investigations, respondent responded to one or more written\r\ninquiries from ODC only after receiving the reminder letters. Although the\r\ninvestigation of the underlying allegations did not reveal clear and convincing\r\nevidence of misconduct, respondent admits he failed to fully cooperate.\r\n\r\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall\r\nprovide competent representation); Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall abide by client's\r\ndecisions concerning objectives of representation); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall promptly\r\ninform client of any decision or circumstance to which client's informed consent is\r\nrequired); Rule 1.15(f) (lawyer shall not disburse funds from trust account unless\r\nfunds have been collected); Rule 8.1(b) (in connection with disciplinary matter,\r\nlawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for information from\r\ndisciplinary authority); 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in\r\nconduct prejudicial to administration of justice). Respondent further admits he\r\nviolated the recordkeeping requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(3) (it\r\nshall be ground for discipline for lawyer to knowingly fail to respond to lawful\r\ndemand from disciplinary authority to include request for response).\r\n\r\n                                    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand.1 Within thirty (30)\r\ndays of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs incurred in the\r\n\r\n1 Respondent's prior disciplinary history includes a confidential admonition issued\r\nin 2005 and four letters of caution issued between 2000 and 2009 warning him to\r\nbe careful to adhere to some of the specific Rules of Professional Conduct cited in\r\nthe current proceeding. See Rule 2(r), RLDE (fact that letter of caution has been\r\nissued shall not be considered in a subsequent disciplinary proceeding against\r\nlawyer unless the caution or warning contained in letter of caution is relevant to the\r\nmisconduct alleged in proceedings); Rule 7(b)(4), RLDE (admonition may be used\r\n\ninvestigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission. Further,\r\nwithin six (6) months of the date of this opinion, respondent shall complete the\r\nLegal Ethics and Practice Program Trust Account School and shall submit\r\ndocumentation of completion to the Commission no later than ten (10) days after\r\nthe conclusion of the program. Accordingly, we accept the Agreement and\r\npublicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin subsequent proceedings as evidence of prior misconduct solely upon issue of\r\nsanction to be imposed).\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
