Andrew Arnold, of Arnold &amp; Arnold, of Greenville, for appellant.\r\nD. Randle Moody, II, of Roe Cassidy Coates &amp; Price, and Ellison F. McCoy, \r\n  of Haynsworth Baldwin Johnson &amp; Greaves LLC, both of Greenville, for respondent.\r\nEric Schweitzer, of Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak, &amp; Stewart, PC, of Columbia, \r\n  for Amicus Curiae South Carolina Chamber of Commerce.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  \r\n  David Horton (appellant) appeals the trial courtâ€™s decision granting Darby Electric \r\n  Companyâ€™s (respondentâ€™s) motion for summary judgment.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant was employed by respondent, which is \r\n  in the business of the sale and repair of industrial electric motors, from March \r\n  1981 to April 2001.Â  Within a month of his hiring, appellant was promoted to \r\n  shop manager and, at the time of his termination, he held the position of Vice \r\n  President of Operations.Â  Appellantâ€™s job responsibilities included bringing \r\n  in work and getting work out, maintaining good morale in the shop, hiring and \r\n  firing employees, and keeping costs under control.\r\nAs a result of losing several employees \r\n  to competitors, respondent drafted a restrictive covenant and non-disclosure \r\n  agreement (the agreement) in 1990.Â  This agreement provided that the employees \r\n  who signed the agreement would not compete with respondent, solicit respondentâ€™s \r\n  customers, or utilize or disclose certain proprietary information of respondent \r\n  for a period of two years following the termination, for any reason, of the \r\n  employeeâ€™s employment.Â  Appellant signed this agreement and received a raise \r\n  in return for signing the agreement.\r\nIn April 1992, respondent published a \r\n  policy and procedure manual.Â  Appellant stated in his deposition that he had \r\n  read and understood the manual.Â  Steve Darby, president of the company, stated \r\n  that the manual applied to all of the employees, including appellant, and management \r\n  was to follow the manual as a guide.Â  Darby stated he used the manual as a guide \r\n  to terminate appellant.Â  The disciplinary policy in the manual provides:\r\n\r\nIt is the Companyâ€™s wish that a uniform policy be followed \r\n  by its supervisors which will mean:\r\n  \r\nFirst -- that an employee will have had sufficient notice \r\n  that a continuance of his improper actions will bring about his discharge, and\r\nSecond - that a report in writing is made of all warnings \r\n  given and disciplinary measures taken.\r\n  \r\nThe following is to be viewed as the guiding policy insofar \r\n  as taking disciplinary action for infractions of company rules and misconduct \r\n  is concerned.\r\n1.Â  At first offense, if not in itself serious enough to \r\n  warrant suspension or discharge, give warning and advise that another offense \r\n  will result in suspension for 3 days without pay as a disciplinary measure.\r\n2. At second offense, if not in itself serious enough to \r\n  warrant discharge, give 3 daysâ€™ suspension without pay and warn that another \r\n  offense may result in discharge.\r\n3. At third offense, discharge, and point out to employee \r\n  that he brought the action on himself and left the supervisor without any alternative.\r\n. . .\r\nIt should be emphasized again that supervisors are not required \r\n  to go through the entire three steps involved in this disciplinary procedure.Â  \r\n  Discipline may begin at any step in the procedure depending on the seriousness \r\n  of the offense committed.Â  Any discipline administered by a supervisor should \r\n  be commensurate with the offense committed.Â  In addition, the supervisor may \r\n  repeat any of the first two steps of this procedure when he feels it is necessary, \r\n  so long as the discipline is commensurate with the offense committed.Â  If there \r\n  is any doubt on your part as to what step to begin with, you should consult \r\n  with the Plant Manager. [1] \r\n\r\nSteve Darby testified that, for a non-serious \r\n  infraction, the employee would be entitled to some form of progressive discipline \r\n  and that he did not think an employee could be terminated for a non-serious \r\n  first time offense.Â  However, he said if a supervisor terminated an employee \r\n  for a non-serious first offense, it would not be a violation of the disciplinary \r\n  policy because the supervisors had discretion in deciding how to handle their \r\n  employees.Â  Appellant testified he tried to always use the manual when disciplining \r\n  employees.Â  However, he confirmed Darbyâ€™s testimony by stating he had discretion \r\n  as to what level of discipline to impose on the employees.\r\nDarby stated appellantâ€™s offenses were \r\n  serious enough to terminate him immediately.Â  Darby testified that, in 2000, \r\n  appellant was suspended with pay for three days for using profanity in the workplace.Â  \r\n  However, he testified appellant treated the suspension as if it was extra vacation.\r\nIn January 2001, appellant and Darby had \r\n  a meeting in which they discussed the companyâ€™s progress and how appellant could \r\n  improve his performance.Â  After the meeting, Darby wrote appellant a letter \r\n  recapping points from the meeting.Â  Darby testified he did not consider this \r\n  letter a warning, but an understanding regarding appellantâ€™s performance.Â  The \r\n  letter stated, in pertinent part:Â  \r\n\r\nYou must eliminate mistakes.Â  This is a constant and recurring \r\n  problem.Â  Your employees must understand procedures and procedures must be enforced.Â  \r\n  Thorough planning prevents mistakes.Â  Procedures need to be constantly improved.Â  \r\n  Clear concise instructions prevent mistakes, which saves time and reduces costs.Â  \r\n  Doing a job without thinking frequently causes us to have to do it over to get \r\n  it right.Â  Cleaning parts half way, performing a drop voltage test incorrectly, \r\n  jumping to conclusions without gathering all of the facts, these are some of \r\n  the ways we are wasting time.Â  We can change this.\r\n\r\nDarby testified appellant was terminated \r\n  for the following reasons:Â  (1) allowing a motor to be shipped out when the \r\n  mechanics did not approve the motor; [2]  (2) making a frivolous written \r\n  statement to a client about the cause of the clientâ€™s motorâ€™s failure (â€œburnt \r\n  to a crispâ€); [3]  (3) failing to give certain work \r\n  priority as he should have; (4) previous 3-day suspension; (5) previous letter \r\n  indicating mistakes should not be made; and (6) the way he treated his employees.Â  \r\n  Darby stated these factors were serious enough to proceed directly to termination.\r\nFollowing appellantâ€™s termination from \r\n  his position, he filed a complaint against respondent alleging breach of contract \r\n  and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  The trial court \r\n  granted respondentâ€™s summary judgment motion.\r\nAppellant appeals the trial courtâ€™s decision granting \r\n  summary judgment and raises the following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\nI.Â Â  Did the trial court err by ruling the restrictive \r\n  covenant and nondisclosure agreement provides for employment at-will?\r\nII.Â  Did the trial court err by ruling there was \r\n  not a genuine issue of fact regarding the existence and breach of an implied \r\n  contract of employment based upon respondentâ€™s policy manual?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d 606 (2002).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist \r\n  for summary judgment purposes, the evidence and all the inferences that can \r\n  be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Id.\r\nI. Restrictive covenant and nondisclosure \r\n  agreement\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by ruling \r\n  the restrictive covenant and nondisclosure agreement (the agreement) allowed \r\n  for the termination of appellantâ€™s employment for any reason.\r\nThe trial court found this case is not \r\n  a traditional handbook case given there was an independent agreement governing \r\n  appellantâ€™s employment.Â  The court held respondent was entitled to summary judgment \r\n  because the agreement specifically provided appellant could be terminated for \r\n  any reason and thus, retained his at-will status.\r\nThis ruling is in error given the agreement \r\n  does not provide that appellant can be terminated for any reason.Â  Reading the \r\n  phrase, â€œtermination, for any reason, of his employmentâ€ within the context \r\n  of the agreement, it is clear the agreement is not stating that appellantâ€™s \r\n  employment can be terminated for any reason. [4] Â  In context, the phrase is simply \r\n  conveying to the employee that the agreement will be in force regardless of \r\n  how the employment is terminated.\r\nThe trial court also incorrectly interpreted \r\n  the agreement to be an employment contract that maintained appellantâ€™s employment \r\n  at-will status.Â  The trial court interpreted the agreement too broadly.Â  Nothing \r\n  in the agreement indicates the agreement is for the purpose of maintaining the \r\n  status of employment at-will.Â  The agreement is solely concerned with attempting \r\n  to prevent employees from competing with respondent for two years following \r\n  their departure from their employment with respondent.Â  This agreement does \r\n  not answer the question of what type of employment relationship is held between \r\n  appellant and respondent.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred by granting summary \r\n  judgment on this point. [5] \r\nII. Employee handbook\r\nThe trial court found summary judgment \r\n  was proper on the basis there was no contract altering appellantâ€™s at-will status.Â  \r\n  The court stated the fact there were two disclaimers in the manual that state \r\n  nothing in the manual is intended to be construed as a contract of employment \r\n  required the grant of summary judgment. \r\n  [6] Â  The trial court found appellant was on actual notice that his employment \r\n  was at-will because he admitted he read and understood the manual, including \r\n  the disclaimers.Â  Further, the trial court found the disciplinary procedure \r\n  was not a mandatory procedure because the discipline meted out was at the discretion \r\n  of management.Â  The trial court further ruled that even assuming the manual \r\n  somehow could restrict decisions related to appellantâ€™s continued employment, \r\n  it is clear the contract was not breached.Â  Finally, the trial court granted \r\n  summary judgment on appellantâ€™s breach of the implied covenant of fair dealing \r\n  claim given appellantâ€™s employment was at-will.\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred \r\n  by granting summary judgment when there were issues of material fact regarding \r\n  the existence of an employment contract and regarding whether that contract \r\n  was breached.\r\nGenerally, an employer may terminate an at-will \r\n  employee for any reason or no reason and will not be subjected to a breach of \r\n  employment contract claim.Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. \r\n  454, 560 S.E.2d 606 (2002).Â  This Court has held that the determination of whether \r\n  an employee manual alters an employeeâ€™s at-will status is a question for the \r\n  jury.Â  Fleming v. Borden, 316 S.C. 452, 460, 450 S.E.2d 589, 594 (1994); \r\n  Small v. Springs Industries, 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987).Â  See \r\n  also Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d 606 (2002) \r\n  (because employee handbook may create contract, issue of existence of employment \r\n  contract is proper for jury when its existence is questioned and evidence is \r\n  either conflicting or admits of more than one inference).Â  An employee manual \r\n  that contains promissory language and a disclaimer is â€œinherently ambiguous,â€ \r\n  and a jury should interpret whether the manual creates or alters an existing \r\n  contractual relationship.Â  Fleming, 316 S.C. at 463-464, 450 S.E.2d at \r\n  596.\r\nRespondentâ€™s manual exemplifies the appropriate \r\n  manner in which to give employees a guide regarding their employment without \r\n  altering the at-will employment relationship.Â  The manual contained conspicuous \r\n  disclaimers and appellant understood those disclaimers.Â  Further, the disciplinary \r\n  procedure contained permissive language [7]  and did not provide for mandatory progressive \r\n  discipline.Â  Appellant, who himself had the responsibility of interpreting the \r\n  manual, stated he interpreted the manual as not limiting his ability to terminate \r\n  employees.Â  Accordingly, the policy manual did not alter the employment at-will \r\n  relationship between appellant and respondent. \r\n  [8] \r\nFurther, even if the manual could be interpreted \r\n  as setting limitations on respondentâ€™s ability to terminate appellant, the evidence \r\n  is uncontradicted that respondent had a reasonable good faith belief that sufficient \r\n  cause existed for appellantâ€™s termination.Â  See Conner v. City of \r\n  Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d 606 (2002) (fact finder must not \r\n  focus on whether employee actually committed misconduct; instead, focus must \r\n  be on whether employer had reasonable good faith belief that sufficient cause \r\n  existed for termination).Â  While it appears the first two steps of the disciplinary \r\n  policy had been used prior to terminating appellant, appellantâ€™s conduct was \r\n  serious enough to proceed directly to termination.\r\nWe note this case is distinguishable from Conner.Â  \r\n  In Conner, we found the question remained whether the employer (the City) \r\n  had a reasonable good faith belief that sufficient cause existed for terminating \r\n  Conner.Â  In that case, the City terminated Conner, the grievance committee reinstated \r\n  her, and then the City Council overturned the grievance committeeâ€™s reinstatement.Â  \r\n  The Court found that, because reasonable minds could differ as to whether just \r\n  cause existed to support Connerâ€™s termination, the trial court should not have \r\n  granted summary judgment in favor of the City.Â  The instant case is unlike Conner \r\n  because reasonable minds cannot differ as to whether just cause existed to support \r\n  appellantâ€™s termination and, also, because respondentâ€™s employees were not entitled \r\n  to progressive discipline.\r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err \r\n  by granting summary judgment on appellantâ€™s contract claims. [9] Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  Paula H. Thomas, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring only in the result.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The \r\n    â€œPlant Managerâ€ was appellant. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] The Blue Ridge motor was a five-ton motor that respondent expected \r\n    to make a profit of about $9,000 on for its repair.Â  An employee, Ron Hunt, \r\n    set up the machine incorrectly and refused help.Â  Appellant admitted the shop \r\n    was his responsibility but stated he did not â€œmicromanage his employees.â€Â  \r\n    Appellant approved the motor to leave the shop although it did not have a \r\n    good cosmetic appearance and had not been approved by the mechanics because \r\n    it was not reaching full voltage.Â  Before approval for shipment, appellant \r\n    knew the motor was not reaching full voltage and that its appearance was not \r\n    satisfactory.Â  However, he stated he did not know the mechanics had not approved \r\n    the motor until after his termination.Â  From the evidence, it appears appellant \r\n    wished to hasten the repair because he was about to leave for a vacation.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [3] Appellant testified the comment was a description of the failure but was \r\n    probably a â€œslight of tongue commentâ€ concerning the motor. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] The text of the agreement states:\r\n  \r\n  Employee therefore agrees that, for a period of two years following \r\n    the termination, for any reason, of his employment with Employer, Employee \r\n    will not, either on his own behalf or on behalf of a competing business:Â  \r\n    (1) solicit business from any ongoing customer of Employerâ€™s with whom Employee \r\n    had contact while employed by Employer, or 2) perform any services similar \r\n    to the services provided by Employer for any ongoing customer of Employerâ€™s \r\n    with whom Employee had contact while employed by Employer.\r\n  . . .\r\n  Employee therefore agrees not to cause information from Employerâ€™s \r\n    customer list to become available to a competing business at any time, whether \r\n    during the continuation of Employeeâ€™s employment relationship with Employer \r\n    or following the termination, for any reason, of that employment relationship.Â  \r\n    . . . All documents relating to Employerâ€™s customers in Employeeâ€™s possession \r\n    are to be surrendered to Employer at the termination, for any reason, of Employeeâ€™s \r\n    employment or at any other time upon Employerâ€™s demand.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Appellant further argues the employment at-will doctrine does \r\n    not apply where the employee has given good consideration in addition to the \r\n    services rendered.Â  (Citing Orsini v. Trojan Steel Corp., 219 S.C. \r\n    272, 64 S.E.2d 878 (1951) (employment at-will does not apply where employee \r\n    has given good consideration in addition to services rendered; held the giving \r\n    up of a job terminable at-will to take job with employer was not sufficient \r\n    independent consideration to render contract enforceable)).Â  Appellant states \r\n    the â€œgood considerationâ€ he gave was his agreement to relinquish his right \r\n    to compete with respondent after termination.\r\n  Appellantâ€™s relinquishment of the right to compete with respondent after termination \r\n    is not â€œgood consideration,â€ such that the agreement changed his employment \r\n    at-will status.Â  The relinquishment does not have any effect on the duration \r\n    of appellantâ€™s employment and there is nothing in the agreement that can be \r\n    construed to alter the employment relationship between appellant and respondent.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] The disclaimer in the Purpose section of the manual states:\r\n  \r\n  We must emphasize that YOUR EMPLOYMENT IS AT THE WILL OF YOU \r\n    AND THE COMPANY.Â  EITHER MAY TERMINATE THE EMPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY \r\n    REASON.Â  NOTHING HEREIN SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT.\r\n  \r\n  The \r\n    disclaimer in the Statement on Policies section states:\r\n  \r\n  We emphasize again that YOUR EMPLOYMENT IS AT WILL.Â  EITHER \r\n    YOU OR THE COMPANY MAY TERMINATE THE EMPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY REASON.Â  \r\n    NOTHING HEREIN IS INTENDED TO BE CONSTRUED AS A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] The permissive language is as follows:Â  (1) the disciplinary \r\n    procedure â€œis to be viewed as the guiding policy insofar as taking \r\n    disciplinary action . . .;â€ (2) â€œsupervisors are not required to go \r\n    through the entire three steps involved in the disciplinary procedure;â€ (3) \r\n    â€œ[d]iscipline may begin at any step in the procedure depending on the \r\n    seriousness of the offense committed;â€ and (4) â€œsupervisor may repeat \r\n    any of the first two steps of this procedure when he feels it is necessary, \r\n    so long as the discipline is commensurate with the offense committed.â€Â  (Emphasis \r\n    added). \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8] Although the question has been raised that the manual does not \r\n    apply to appellant, as respondentâ€™s Vice-President of Operations, the manual \r\n    in fact applies to appellant.Â  The manual does not limit itself to employees \r\n    who are not supervisors and specifically states in the Purpose section that \r\n    the manual â€œis designed to be a working guide for all personnel.â€Â  \r\n    (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [9] Appellant further argues the trial court sua sponte ruled \r\n    on the affirmative defenses of unclean hands and equitable estoppel although \r\n    respondent had not raised those defenses.Â  See Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s \r\n    Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 531 S.E.2d 287 (2000) (doctrine of unclean hands \r\n    precludes plaintiff from recovering in equity if he acted unfairly in subject \r\n    matter of litigation to prejudice of defendant; and elements of equitable \r\n    estoppel as to party estopped are:Â  (1) conduct by party estopped which amounts \r\n    to false representation or concealment of material facts; (2) intention that \r\n    such conduct shall be acted upon by other party; and (3) knowledge, actual \r\n    or constructive, of true facts).\r\n  Appellant correctly argues the doctrines of equitable estoppel and unclean hands \r\n    do not apply in this case.Â  However, appellant incorrectly argues the trial \r\n    court raised those doctrines sua sponte.Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling \r\n    was not based on either of those doctrines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25840","title":"Sun Light v.

[1] Â  The trial court held the phone \r\n  cards and dispensers were illegal gambling devices.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe phone card dispensers, which are entitled â€œLucky Shamrock,â€ were manufactured \r\n  by Diamond Games Enterprises and distributed and leased by DTL Companies, Inc. \r\n  to appellants.Â  The promotional materials furnished by the manufacturer and \r\n  distributor contain a header in large print stating, â€œPay Winners in Cash Legally.â€Â  \r\n  On this same page, the promotion contains the sentence, â€œAudio and Visual Effects \r\n  Make It Look Like a Slot Machine Although Itâ€™s Not!â€Â  The promotional information \r\n  mentions the sale of the phone cards in the following way:Â  â€œSell Hundreds of \r\n  Phone Cards Every Day Reaping Big Profits!â€\r\nThe phone cards, including the game pieces, are pre-printed by the \r\n  manufacturer before they are placed in a dispenser.Â  The cards are printed on \r\n  rolls containing 7,500 cards.Â  Attached to each phone card is a game piece that \r\n  gives the customer a chance to win a cash prize.Â  The entire card contains a \r\n  paper cover, which, when pulled back, reveals a toll-free number and pin number \r\n  for activating the phone service as well as an array of nine symbols in a 8-liner \r\n  format. [2] Â  If the game piece contains symbols arranged \r\n  in a certain order, the customer wins a prize.Â  The computer that prints the \r\n  card randomly generates winners on the cards.Â  Seventy percent of the revenue \r\n  from the cards is paid out in prizes and the rest is a hold percentage. \r\n  [3] Â  A hold percentage is the net profit received by the sellers of the \r\n  cards.Â  The dispensers do not adjust to ensure the hold percentage is received; \r\n  however, the amount of the hold percentage is predetermined based on the printing \r\n  of the phone card rolls.\r\nAfter printing, the roll of pre-printed phone cards are placed inside \r\n  the dispenser and the dispenser cannot work without a roll of phone cards inside. \r\n  [4] Â  Each card sells for $1 and gives the customer two minutes of long \r\n  distance telephone service.Â  The customer can use the two minutes of time by \r\n  dialing a toll-free number and entering a PIN number.Â  The customer can also \r\n  recharge the card and put additional long distance time on the card at the rate \r\n  of 14.9 cents per minute.\r\nAppellants contend the purpose of the game piece is to promote the \r\n  sale of the phone cards.Â  The prizes are paid to the winning customer either \r\n  by the cashier in the store or by mail, but not by the dispenser itself.Â  A \r\n  customer does not need to purchase a phone card to obtain a free game piece.Â  \r\n  A free game piece could be obtained from the operator of the dispenser by mail.Â  \r\n  Instructions on how to obtain a free game piece were posted on the side of the \r\n  machine and on the video screen of the machine.\r\nThe phone card dispensers are housed within a standard slot machine \r\n  cabinet.Â  The dispensers contained several features present in a gambling machine \r\n  as opposed to a vending machine that simply dispenses a product:Â  (1) the dispensers \r\n  contain a video screen that has a gambling theme in that, if the user so chooses, \r\n  the user can see reels turn as if the winner is chosen by the machine; \r\n  [5]  (2) if the machine dispenses a winning game piece, celebration music \r\n  is played, whereas no music plays if the game piece is a loser; (3) the machine \r\n  has a lock-out feature which freezes the operation of the machine when a pre-determined \r\n  level of prize money is reached; (4) the machine contains two hard meters, one \r\n  is an in-meter that records the amount of money going into the machine, and \r\n  the other is labelled â€œWONâ€ and records the value of the prizes issued by the \r\n  machines; (5) the machine, although it accepts $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 \r\n  bills, does not have a mechanism for returning change; and (6) the machines \r\n  could be linked, a feature of a gambling device.\r\nFurther, although the sweepstakes promotion was set to run for 22 \r\n  months, the long distance service on the phone cards was valid only for six \r\n  months from the time the first phone card pin number was used.Â  There \r\n  was testimony that appellants, the manufacturer, and the distributor did not \r\n  keep any records of the phone time used or what pin numbers had been sold via \r\n  the cards.Â  Also, some stores contained more than one phone card dispenser.Â  \r\n  According to the lease and purchase agreements, Phonecards R Us, Sun Light, \r\n  and another company not involved in this case, were under contract to sell 117 \r\n  million and 360 thousand (117,360,000) cards a year in the state of South Carolina.Â  \r\n  The South Carolina population in early 2000, the time of the seizures, was only \r\n  about three million people.Â  A marketing study had not been conducted to determine \r\n  whether there would be such a high demand for the phone cards.Â  Finally, the \r\n  phone company from which the long distance service was purchased could not legally \r\n  provide intrastate service in South Carolina because it had not been licensed \r\n  to do so.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by finding the phone cards and phone card dispensers \r\n  are illegal gambling devices?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe trial court found the phone cards and phone card dispensers are illegal \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2710 (2000), which provides:\r\n\r\nIt is unlawful for any person to keep on his premises or operate or \r\n  permit to be kept on his premises or operated within this State . . . any \r\n  . . . pull board, or other device pertaining to games of chance of whatever \r\n  name or kind, including those machines, boards, or other devices that display \r\n  different pictures, words, or symbols, at different plays or different numbers, \r\n  whether in words or figures or, which deposit tokens or coins at regular intervals \r\n  or in varying numbers to the player or in the machine, but the provisions \r\n  of this section do not extend to . . . vending machines which are constructed \r\n  as to give a certain uniform and fair return in value for each coin deposited \r\n  and in which there is no element of chance.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nAppellants argue the phone card dispensers are legal under Â§ 12-21-2710 \r\n  because they are the same as traditional vending machines and provide a uniform \r\n  return for every dollar inserted, i.e. a phone card.Â  They argue that \r\n  only when a machine and its components determine who will be a winner does the \r\n  machine violate Â§ 12-21-2710.\r\nWhile it is true the dispenser always gives the customer the same \r\n  return, i.e. a phone card with a game piece attached, and that the dispenser \r\n  does not itself determine whether a customer has won, the dispenser still contains \r\n  an element of chance.\r\nWhen printing the phone card rolls, a computer randomly determines \r\n  which game piece attached to which phone card will be a winner.Â  The phone card \r\n  roll is then placed inside the dispenser.Â  As testified to by the designer of \r\n  the dispensers and by appellantsâ€™ expert, the phone card rolls are an integral \r\n  part of the machine, and, without them, the dispensers will not work.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the phone card rolls present the element of chance in the dispensers and cause \r\n  the cards and the dispensers to violate Â§ 12-21-2710.\r\nAlthough the phone cards are an integral component of the dispensers, the phone \r\n  cards would be illegal if they were issued over the counter as opposed to being \r\n  placed in the dispensers.Â  As the trial court found, Â§ 12-21-2710 declares illegal \r\n  any pull board or other device pertaining to games of chance.Â  The phone card \r\n  itself contains an element of chance and is a type of gambling device known \r\n  as a pull-tab.Â  Appellantsâ€™ expert stated that if the card did not include the \r\n  long distance phone service but only included the sweepstakes portion, the card \r\n  would be a gambling device.Â  Given the characteristics of the phone cards , \r\n  the phone portion of the cards is mere surplusage to the game piece.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial court properly determined the phone cards themselves were illegal \r\n  gambling devices.\r\nFurthermore, the trial court correctly determined the phone card \r\n  dispensers are like slot machines and not traditional vending machines.Â  The \r\n  dispensers have a gambling-themed video screen, play celebration music when \r\n  a customer is a winner, have a lock-out feature which freezes the operation \r\n  of the machine when a pre-determined level of prize money is reached, contain \r\n  a meter that records the value of the prizes paid out, and do not give change.Â  \r\n  None of these features is present in a traditional vending machine that is exempted \r\n  from Â§ 12-21-2710.\r\nAccordingly, the trial court properly found the phone cards and dispensers \r\n  to be illegal gambling devices pursuant to Â§ 12-21-2710. [6] \r\nAppellants further argue the trial court should have found the dispensers \r\n  and phone cards legal pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-580 (Supp. 2003). \r\n  [7] Â  However, the phone cards and dispensers do not meet the requirements \r\n  of Â§ 61-4-580 because the game pieces are not a legitimate promotion or sweepstakes.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court did not err by failing to find the dispensers and \r\n  phone cards legal pursuant to Â§ 61-4-580. \r\n  [8] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court did not err by finding the two-minute emergency \r\n  long-distance phone cards and the electronic phone card dispensers to be illegal \r\n  gambling devices under Â§ 12-21-2710.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and Acting Justice Alexander S. Macaulay, concur.Â  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., and Acting Justice Daniel F. Pieper dissenting in separate opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that the machines in question \r\n  are gambling devices that violate S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2710 (2000), but would \r\n  hold they meet the exception found in S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-580(3) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, I would reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order.\r\nIn 1929, this Court held a machine that dispensed a package of mints \r\n  for each nickel deposited, and in addition dispensed, at random intervals, between \r\n  2 and 20 brass tokens, was an unlawful gambling device under the predecessor \r\n  to Â§ 12-21-2710. [9] Â  Harvie \r\n  v. Heise, 150 S.C. 277, 148 S.E. 66 (1929).Â  In my opinion, that decision \r\n  controls the gambling device issue raised here.\r\nHaving determined that the dispenser/phone card/game piece scheme here \r\n  is a gambling device, the next issue is whether it is permitted under Â§ 61-4-580.Â  \r\n  The General Assembly has legalized games of chances â€œin connection with the \r\n  sale, promotion or advertisement of a consumer good or service . . .â€ if conducted \r\n  on premises licensed for the sale of beer or wine.Â  Â§ 61-4-580(3). Â The \r\n  majority concludes that the phone cards and dispensing machines are without \r\n  this statute because â€œthe game pieces are not a legitimate promotion or sweepstakes.â€Â  \r\n  While I agree that the phone cards are a foolish investment, I do not believe \r\n  the statute limits promotions or sweepstakes to those where the consumer good \r\n  or product that is the subject of the promotion is deemed by a court to be â€œlegitimateâ€ \r\n  or a â€œgood deal.â€Â  As neither the wisdom nor the legitimacy of the promotion \r\n  is an issue, I can find no basis to deny these machines and cards the exemption \r\n  provided by the statute. \r\nI would reverse the decision of the circuit court, and hold that \r\n  these devices are within the ambit of Â§ 61-4-580(3), and thus are \r\n  legal when placed in licensed premises. [10] \r\nACTING JUSTICE PIEPER:Â  I concur \r\n  with Justice Pleiconesâ€™opinion as to the interpretation of S.C. Code Â§ 12-21-2710 \r\n  and strict construction of Â§ 61-4-580.Â  However, since the record is not clear \r\n  and since the trial court declined to address Â§ 61-4-580, I would first remand \r\n  for a hearing to determine whether the appellants held a permit and allowed \r\n  the placement of these machines upon licensed premises in accordance with Â§ \r\n  61-4-580.Â  If the trial court finds upon remand that the permit and licensed \r\n  premises requirements have been met, I would reverse and hold that the devices \r\n  are legal pursuant to Â§ 61-4-580(3).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] By \r\n    order of this Court, all magistrate court cases and appeals therefrom arising \r\n    out of the seizures of the phone card machines and phone cards were stayed \r\n    pending the conclusion of this action.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Appellantsâ€™ \r\n    expert agreed that if the card included only the game portion of the card \r\n    and did not include the phone card, the card would be a pull-tab, which is \r\n    a gambling device. \r\n\r\n \r\n    [3] Sun Light Prepaid Phonecard Companyâ€™s (Sun Light) \r\n    promotion was predicted to result in $9,744,000 in prizes and $4,178,000 in \r\n    net revenue.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Donald \r\n    Louden, who was involved in the design and building of the machines, testified \r\n    the phone cards could be purchased from a clerk and did not have to be dispensed \r\n    by the machines.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] The \r\n    machine does not play a role in determining the winner because the winning \r\n    cards have already been pre-selected on the phone card rolls.Â  The machine \r\n    simply reads the bar code on the back of the phone card and displays that \r\n    image on the video screen.Â  The customer can either look at the game piece \r\n    or the monitor to determine if they have a winning game piece. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  Appellants argue that if the \r\n    dispensers are found illegal under Â§ 12-21-2710, then all vending machines \r\n    in South Carolina that dispense candy or snacks with promotional sweepstakes \r\n    game pieces likewise violate the statute, otherwise their equal protection \r\n    rights would be violated.Â  However, this argument is without merit given the \r\n    phone card dispensers are illegal gambling devices and vending machines are \r\n    not.Â  The two machines are not similarly situated such that an equal \r\n    protection claim may arise.Â  See Whaley v. Dorchester County Zoning \r\n    Bd. of Appeals, 337 S.C. 568, 524 S.E.2d 404 (1999) (equal protection \r\n    is satisfied if:Â  (1) classification bears reasonable relation to legislative \r\n    purpose sought to be effected; (2) members of class are treated alike under \r\n    similar circumstances and conditions; and (3) classification rests on some \r\n    reasonable basis).\r\n  The main difference between the dispensers and vending machines \r\n    is that the vending machines dispense promotional game products that are legitimate \r\n    because their companies are attempting to promote the sale of those products.Â  \r\n    The phone card dispensers, on the other hand, do not issue game pieces that \r\n    are part of a legitimate promotion or sweepstakes.Â  The product being sold \r\n    to consumers is not the long distance phone service but a game of chance.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [7] Section 61-4-580 provides:Â  \r\n  \r\n  No holder of a permit authorizing the sale of beer or wine . . . may knowingly \r\n    commit any of the following acts upon the licensed premises covered by the \r\n    holderâ€™s permit:\r\n  . . .\r\n  (3) permit gambling or games of chance except game promotions including contests, \r\n    games of chance, or sweepstakes in which the elements of chance and prize \r\n    are present and which comply with the following:\r\n  (a) the game promotion is conducted or offered in connection with \r\n    the sale, promotion, or advertisement of a consumer product or service, or \r\n    to enhance the brand or image of a supplier of consumer products or services;\r\n  (b) no purchase payment, entry fee, or proof of purchase is required \r\n    as a condition of entering the game promotion or receiving a prize; and\r\n  (c) all materials advertising the game promotion clearly disclose \r\n    that no purchase or payment is necessary to enter and provide details on the \r\n    free method of participation.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8] Given \r\n    the phone cards and dispensers are illegal under Â§ 12-21-2710, it is unnecessary \r\n    to address appellantsâ€™ argument that the trial court erred by finding the \r\n    dispensers illegal under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-22-1040 (2000).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]  This gambling device statute has been amended \r\n    over the years as the technology evolved, but the essential structure has \r\n    remained intact.Â  The version in effect in 1929 read:\r\n  \r\n  It shall be unlawful for any person to keep on his \r\n    premises or operate or permit to be kept on his premises or operated within \r\n    this State, any slot machine of whatever name or kind, except automatic weighing, \r\n    measuring, musical and vending machines which are so constructed as to give \r\n    a certain uniform and fair return in value for each coin deposited therein, \r\n    and in which there is no element of chance.Â  Any person whomsoever who shall \r\n    violate this section shall be subject to a fine of not more than one hundred \r\n    dollars, or imprisonment upon the public works of the County wherein the offense \r\n    is committed for a period of not more than thirty days.\r\n  \r\n  2 S.C. Code Â§ 196 (1922).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [10]  It is unclear from the record whether any of \r\n    appellants are licensed premises within the meaning of Â§ 61-4-580. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25841","title":"In the Matter of Day","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25841","description":"\"This Court sanctions respondent with a public reprimand for his failure to accomplish the task for which he was hired, which was to clear title to his client's property.\"","date":"2004-07-12","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nBENCH MEMORANDUM\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tline-height:200%;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.68emarialclsubordinates\r\n\t{color:black;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      In the Matter of R.

Emory Smith, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nR. Daniel Day, Jr., of Seneca, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This disciplinary action arises \r\n  from two separate matters in which Daniel Day (respondent) failed to (1) enforce \r\n  a clientâ€™s divorce decree granting her title to a piece of marital property \r\n  and (2) respond to his clientâ€™s request to amend his post-conviction relief \r\n  (PCR) petition.Â  The Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Commission) recommended that \r\n  this Court impose a sanction of an admonition.Â  We sanction respondent with \r\n  a public reprimand.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThis Court sanctioned \r\n  respondent with a public reprimand in November 2002 for his general neglect \r\n  of various legal matters.Â  In re Day (DayI), 352 S.C. 41, 572 S.E.2d \r\n  291 (2002).Â  Originally, the Commission attempted to include the two matters \r\n  at issue here with the matters considered in DayI, but the Court had \r\n  already issued the DayI opinion.Â  Subsequently, this Court remanded these \r\n  two matters back to the Commission, and the Commission recommended an admonition.\r\nWe now review the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  recommendation that respondent receive an admonition for his conduct in the \r\n  following two matters.\r\nHedden \r\n  Matter\r\nJulie Hedden (Hedden) \r\n  was involved in an extensive domestic dispute that ended in divorce.Â  The divorce \r\n  decree directed Heddenâ€™s former spouse to transfer certain property to Hedden.Â  \r\n  Prior to deeding the property to Hedden, the former spouse died intestate in \r\n  1993, leaving their two children as his only heirs.Â  In 1994, Hedden hired respondent \r\n  to quiet title to the property in compliance with the divorce decree, and in \r\n  that proceeding, respondent failed to name the two children as parties.Â  The \r\n  1994 proceeding produced two separate orders transferring the property to Hedden.Â  \r\n  A deed was executed, and the property was conveyed to her in 1995.\r\nLater, in 2000, Hedden \r\n  attempted to sell the property, and the attorney for the prospective purchasers \r\n  noticed that the two children might have an interest in the property since they \r\n  were the former spouseâ€™s intestate heirs and were not named in the 1994 proceeding \r\n  to quiet title.Â  Respondent then petitioned for the approval of the sale of \r\n  the property before a master-in-equity, naming Heddenâ€™s two children as parties.Â  \r\n  The master approved the sale, dispersed half of the proceeds to Hedden, and \r\n  poured the other half into an escrow account on behalf of the children until \r\n  it was determined whether the children had a right to the proceeds. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nRespondent failed to \r\n  take any further action to secure the release of the proceeds held in escrow \r\n  and failed to respond to attempts by Hedden and Heddenâ€™s father to contact him \r\n  to concerning the release of the funds.Â  As a result, Hedden was forced to hire \r\n  another attorney to secure the release of the proceeds.Â Â  \r\nHawkins \r\n  Matter\r\nRespondent was \r\n  appointed to represent George Hawkins (Hawkins) in a PCR matter.Â  On two occasions \r\n  prior to the first PCR hearing, [2]  held in September 2000, Hawkins \r\n  wrote respondent, asking respondent to amend his PCR application to include \r\n  a challenge to Hawkinsâ€™s current prison sentence. \r\n  [3] Â  Respondent failed to respond to the letters Hawkins sent in May and \r\n  September 2000, and he failed to respond to Hawkinsâ€™s familyâ€™s inquiries into \r\n  whether respondent had amended the application.Â  Respondent never amended the \r\n  PCR application.Â  After a hearing, Hawkinsâ€™s first PCR petition was denied.Â  \r\n\r\nPrior to the second \r\n  PCR hearing, Hawkins wrote respondent a letter expressing concern about several \r\n  issues, and again, respondent failed to respond.Â  At the second hearing, Hawkinsâ€™s \r\n  first simple possession conviction expunged, and his request for PCR relief \r\n  -- a resentencing -- is still under advisement.Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe Commission found \r\n  that respondent violated various Rules of Professional Conduct (Rule \r\n  407, SCACR).Â  In both the Hedden and Hawkins matters, respondent failed to act \r\n  with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing both clients (Rule \r\n  1.3); failed to keep his clients reasonably informed about the status of their \r\n  actions and promptly comply with their multiple requests for information (Rule \r\n  1.4(a)); failed to represent the clients competently (Rule 1.1); and failed \r\n  to consult with his clients about the objectives of his representation and the \r\n  means by which they were to be achieved (Rule 1.2).\r\nFurther, respondent \r\n  failed to cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel investigation when \r\n  he provided information concerning the Hedden matter that he knew or should \r\n  have known was erroneous.Â  In re Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 \r\n  (1982).Â  Respondent alleged that he was hired merely to execute the court-ordered \r\n  property transfer from Heddenâ€™s ex-husband to Hedden, not to quiet title.Â  This \r\n  allegation is erroneous for two reasons.Â  First, respondent never completely \r\n  effectuated the property transfer because he did not name the two children in \r\n  the initial action.Â  Thus, he never accomplished the task for which he \r\n  was initially hired.Â  The only reason the subsequent action to quiet title was \r\n  brought was because respondent neglected to quiet title as required under the \r\n  divorce decree.Â  Second, Hedden testified that respondent never notified her \r\n  that he would no longer represent her on the property matter.Â  \r\nFinally, the Commission \r\n  found, and we agree, that respondent violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for \r\n  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (Rule 413, SCACR), in violating the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct; and Rule 8.4(e), in engaging in conduct that is \r\n  prejudicial to the administration of justice.\r\nSanction\r\nEven though the Commission \r\n  recommended that this Court should sanction respondent with an admonition, we \r\n  find that a public reprimand is more appropriate.Â  This Court has publicly reprimanded \r\n  attorneys for committing similar acts of misconduct.Â  See In re Spell, \r\n  355 S.C. 655, 587 S.E.2d 104 (2003) (sanctioning the attorney with a public \r\n  reprimand based on the attorneyâ€™s violations of Rules 1.3 and 1.4 of the RPC \r\n  and Rule 8.4 of the RLDE).Â  \r\nRespondentâ€™s failure to ensure \r\n  that Hedden was awarded legal title to the marital property, combined with his \r\n  misrepresentations to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (1) that he was hired \r\n  by Hedden only to execute the court-ordered property transfer to Hedden rather \r\n  than quiet title and (2) that he acted as guardian ad litem on behalf of Heddenâ€™s \r\n  two children, warrants the more severe sanction of a public reprimand.Â  \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, \r\n  WALLER, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  Burnett, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Respondent misrepresented to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel that \r\n    he was appointed guardian ad litem and acted as guardian ad litem on behalf \r\n    of the two children in the 2000 petition to sell Heddenâ€™s property.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Hawkins has had two PCR hearings.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Hawkins was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana \r\n    and was sentenced as a third offender, receiving the maximum sentence of 20 \r\n    years.Â  He was attempting to assert that his first offense, a simple possession \r\n    of marijuana conviction, should not have been used to enhance his sentence.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary \r\n          Counsel. \r\n        Elizabeth Van Doren Gray, of Sowell, Gray, Stepp &amp; Laffitte, LLC, \r\n          of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the \r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension \r\n  from the practice of law for a period of not less than four nor more than twelve \r\n  months.Â  We accept the agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the \r\n  practice of law in this state for a six month period, retroactive to his interim \r\n  suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was admitted to practice law in South Carolina on September 1, 1970.Â  \r\n  He is a partner in the law firm of Lathan and Barbare (Firm) with his partner \r\n  Ronald F. Barbare (Partner).Â  Respondent and partner are the only two attorneys \r\n  employed by the Firm. \r\nThe Firmâ€™s primary practice is the closing of real estate transactions.Â  The \r\n  Firm handles approximately 1400 to 1600 real estate closings per year.Â  \r\nOn or about November 19, 2003, respondent and his partner pled guilty before \r\n  the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina to one count \r\n  of violation 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1010, a felony.Â  The information to which respondent \r\n  pled guilty provided that he falsely certified that he had received cash from \r\n  borrowers in amounts reported on HUD-1 Settlement Statements he prepared and \r\n  submitted to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development when \r\n  respondent did not receive the cash.Â Â  \r\nBecause of cooperation with federal authorities into matters related to the \r\n  information and to other investigations, the United States Attorney made a motion \r\n  for downward departure.Â  Both respondent and his partner received favorable \r\n  recommendations in the pre-sentencing report submitted by the United States \r\n  Probation Department.Â  Both respondent and his partner were sentenced to pay \r\n  a fine of $5,000 as final disposition of their pleas; both have paid those fines.Â  \r\n\r\nFirmâ€™s General Procedure for Closing Real Estate Transactions\r\nThe Firmâ€™s paralegal was the principal point of contact between the Firm and \r\n  the seller.Â  The paralegal reviewed the lenderâ€™s instructions and the contract \r\n  of sale and prepared closing documents and a balance sheet showing incoming \r\n  funds and disbursements.Â  Changes to the transaction were conveyed by the seller \r\n  to the paralegal who would then make pen and ink changes on the Firmâ€™s in-house \r\n  balance sheet reflecting the changes directed by the seller.Â  \r\nAnother Firm employee then prepared checks for disbursement in accordance with \r\n  the balance sheet, including any pen and ink changes prepared by the paralegal.Â  \r\n  Thereafter, the paralegal prepared a class report showing the disbursements \r\n  made out of the Firmâ€™s trust account in connection with each transaction.Â  \r\nRespondent or his partner reviewed the various closing documents, attended \r\n  the closing with the seller and borrower, and gave instructions to the Firm \r\n  staff for the conclusion of transactions.Â Â  Respondent or his partner attended \r\n  and supervised all closings. \r\nGenerally, there were no direct communications between the Firm and the borrowers \r\n  prior to closing.Â  In general, neither respondent nor his partner had any communications \r\n  with the seller concerning an individual transaction prior to closing.Â  \r\nCromer Company Transactions\r\nRespondent and his partner served as closing attorneys in a number of real \r\n  estate transactions where the Cromer Company was the seller of mobile home and \r\n  land packages.Â  The principal owner of the Cromer Company was A. Eugene Cromer \r\n  (Cromer).Â  Melissa Caldwell (Caldwell) was an employee of the Cromer Company \r\n  and was often the principal point of contact between the Cromer Company and \r\n  the Firm.Â  \r\nOn one occasion, respondent closed loans for the Cromer Company where the HUD-1 \r\n  Settlement Statement reflected that certain sums of money on line 303 â€œcash \r\n  from borrowerâ€ had been paid by borrowers at closing when the balance sheet \r\n  (in-house schedule of incoming funds and disbursements) and the Firmâ€™s class \r\n  report (trust account ledger) showed no money had been received into the Firmâ€™s \r\n  trust account.Â  On this occasion, no money was received by the Firm from borrowers.Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent represents that Cromer or a representative of his company advised \r\n  the Firm staff, probably to the paralegal, that this amount had been paid by \r\n  borrowers directly to the Cromer Company.Â  Thereafter, the paralegal made pen \r\n  and ink changes to the balance sheet to reflect that no â€œcash from borrowersâ€ \r\n  was received at closing and reduced the â€œcash to sellerâ€ on line 603 of the \r\n  HUD-1 statement by the amount of the â€œcash from borrowerâ€ shown on line 303. \r\n  [1] Â  However, the HUD-1 form submitted to the lenders were not amended \r\n  and continued to show an amount of â€œcash from borrowerâ€ on line 303 and no notation \r\n  of â€œPOCâ€ (a standard abbreviation for â€œpaid outside of closingâ€).Â  The HUD-1 \r\n  form contained the standard statement signed by respondent to the effect â€œthe \r\n  HUD-1 Settlement Statement which I have prepared is a true and accurate account \r\n  of this transaction.Â  I have caused the funds to be disbursed in accordance \r\n  with this statement.â€Â  \r\nOn another occasion, respondent served as the closing attorney for a transaction \r\n  between the Cromer Company as seller and Ms. Z as buyer.Â  On line 303, the HUD-1 \r\n  statement showed â€œcash from borrowerâ€ to be $5,211.50.Â  However, on instructions \r\n  from the seller, pen and ink changes were made to the balance sheet, deleting \r\n  the amount of â€œcash from borrowerâ€ on line 303 and reducing â€œcash to sellerâ€ \r\n  on line 603 by a like amount.Â  No corresponding change was made to the HUD-1 \r\n  form which was sent to the lender and no â€œPOCâ€ notation was made on line 303.Â  \r\n  The Firmâ€™s class report did not show â€œcash from borrowerâ€ deposited into the \r\n  Firmâ€™s trust account and, instead, showed the amount of the â€œcash to sellerâ€ \r\n  reduced by the amount the HUD-1 form showed as â€œcash to borrower.â€Â  This caused \r\n  a variance in the information given the lender in the HUD-1 form and the actual \r\n  disbursements from the Firmâ€™s trust account.Â  The HUD-1 form contained the standard \r\n  attorney certification as set forth above.Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn two other occasions, respondent closed transactions wherein the Firmâ€™s class \r\n  report showed the line 303 â€œcash from borrowerâ€ was paid at closing by a check \r\n  drawn on the Cromer Company account rather than by cash or a check from the \r\n  borrowers.Â  This fact was not disclosed to the lender.Â  Respondent represents \r\n  that a representative of the Cromer Company told a Firm employee that the â€œcash \r\n  from borrowersâ€ in these two transactions had been paid directly by borrowers \r\n  to the Cromer Company.Â  \r\nRespondent is now informed and believes that the representations from the Cromer \r\n  Company that the amount â€œdue from borrowerâ€ on these last three occasions had \r\n  been paid directly by borrowers to the Cromer Company were false, that there \r\n  was (at least in most instances) no money paid from the borrowers as represented \r\n  on line 303 of the HUD-1 form and that Cromerâ€™s misrepresentations were in furtherance \r\n  of his scheme to sell mobile home and land packages to borrowers without the \r\n  borrowers having to contribute any money to the transactions.Â  As a result, \r\n  it now appears that the representations made by respondent concerning the information \r\n  on lines 303 and 603 of the HUD-1 statements were incorrect.Â  The inaccurate \r\n  report had the tendency to cause lenders to believe that borrowers had invested \r\n  money in the transactions when, in fact, the borrowers had not, and caused the \r\n  price of the package to be inflated by the amounts shown on line 303 of the \r\n  HUD-1 form.Â Â  \r\nCromer and Caldwell were indicted in the United States District Court in connection \r\n  with one or more transactions closed by the Firm where the Cromer Company was \r\n  the seller.Â  An allegation in Cromerâ€™s indictment states Cromer made false statements \r\n  concerning down payments (information on line 202 of HUD-1 forms) and â€œcash \r\n  from borrowersâ€ (information on line 303 of HUD-1 forms).Â  Cromer pled guilty \r\n  to one count of mail and wire fraud in connection with these transactions and \r\n  was sentenced to eighteen months in prison.Â  In his plea agreement, Cromer admitted \r\n  he had derived between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 in benefits from his scheme.Â  \r\n\r\nODC does not contend that either respondent or his partner were aware of Cromer \r\n  and Caldwellâ€™s criminal activities or of the amount of the money involved.Â  \r\n  Instead, ODC contends respondentâ€™s failure to either amend line 303 and line \r\n  603 to reflect â€œno cash from borrowerâ€ received by the Firm or to place the \r\n  notation â€œPOCâ€ by the line 303 data made it possible for Cromer to engage in \r\n  the criminal activity stated in the Cromer indictment.Â Â  \r\n In approximately twelve transactions in which the Cromer Company was the seller \r\n  and the Firm served as closing agent, borrowers made claims or, in some cases, \r\n  initiated litigation, against the Firm.Â  The Firm and/or respondent and his \r\n  partner and their insurance carrier paid $2,500 per case to settle the claims.Â  \r\n\r\nStegall Entities Transactions\r\nFor many years, the Firm handled numerous real estate transactions for several \r\n  entities owned and managed by Donald L. Stegall (Stegall).Â  Respondent served \r\n  as closing attorney in approximately fourteen transactions where Stegall entities \r\n  were the sellers of mobile home and land packages.Â  \r\nIn each of these fourteen transactions, the HUD-1 statements and Firm balance \r\n  sheets were prepared by the Firmâ€™s paralegal based on information from contracts \r\n  of sale, information in the lenderâ€™s loan closing instructions, and/or instructions \r\n  from Stegall employees, usually Teresa Ashmore (Ashmore).Â  In each of the transactions, \r\n  both line 303 on the HUD-1 statement and the balance sheet would initially reflect \r\n  amounts of money to be paid by the borrower at closing.Â  Prior to closing, Ashmore \r\n  would instruct the paralegal to make changes, primarily reducing the amount \r\n  of â€œcash from borrowerâ€ to zero and making corresponding reductions in â€œcash \r\n  to sellerâ€ on line 603 and, in other cases, directing other changes in disbursements \r\n  to Stegall entities to cause the disbursements to balance. \r\nThe changes made by the paralegal at Ashmoreâ€™s directions were not reflected \r\n  on the HUD-1 forms which were sent to the lenders.Â  In each of these transactions, \r\n  the HUD-1 statement contained a certification signed by respondent, as settlement \r\n  agent, to the effect â€œthe HUD-1 Settlement Statement which I have prepared is \r\n  a true and accurate account of this transaction.Â  I have caused the funds to \r\n  be disbursed in accordance with this statement.â€Â  None of the fourteen settlement \r\n  statements contained the notation â€œPOCâ€ beside line 303 â€œcash from borrowerâ€ \r\n  even though this amount was not received by the Firm.Â  Accordingly, there was \r\n  a variance in the information furnished to the lenders on the HUD-1 statements \r\n  and the actual disbursements made out of the Firmâ€™s trust account in connections \r\n  with these transactions.Â  Accordingly, there was a variance in the information \r\n  furnished to the lenders on the HUD-1 statements and the actual disbursements \r\n  made out of the Firmâ€™s trust account in connection with these transactions.Â  \r\n\r\n In six of the Stegall closings, addendums to the HUD-1 statements were prepared \r\n  by the Firmâ€™s staff and executed by the parties.Â  The effect of the addendums \r\n  was to reduce to writing the changes which had been directed by Stegall employees, \r\n  usually Ashmore, and made to the balance sheet by the paralegal.Â  The addendums \r\n  were not sent to the lenders.Â  \r\n In one Stegall transaction, respondent closed loans for Borrowers Y and Z.Â  \r\n  Because the transaction was insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), \r\n  an FHA Addendum was required.Â  The borrowers and seller signed certifications \r\n  on the FHA Addendum prepared by respondent stating that there had not been any \r\n  reimbursement for cash down payments or closing costs not disclosed to the lender.Â  \r\n  Respondent signed the certification on the FHA required addendum that the HUD \r\n  was â€œ . . . a true and accurate account of the funds that were (i) received \r\n  or (ii) paid outside of closing, and the funds received have been or will be \r\n  disbursed by [respondent] as part of the settlement of this transaction.â€Â  \r\nThe HUD-1 statement sent by respondent to the lender also contained the standard \r\n  certification signed by respondent as the settlement agent.Â  The HUD-1 statement \r\n  sent to the lender showed $2,987.86 â€œcash from borrower,â€ however no cash from \r\n  the borrowers was received by respondent or the Firm in connection with the \r\n  transaction and the amount actually paid to the seller was reduced by the amount \r\n  â€œdue from borrower.â€Â  As a result, there was a variance in the information furnished \r\n  the lender on the HUD-1 statement and the FHA required addendum and the actual \r\n  disbursements made from the Firmâ€™s trust account and this, in turn, caused respondentâ€™s \r\n  certifications to be incorrect.Â  Similar transactions occurred in other FHA \r\n  insured loans closed by respondent where a Stegall entity was the seller.Â  \r\nMany of the transactions handled by the Firm for the Stegall entities were \r\n  funded by Cendant Mortgage Corporation (Cendant).Â  Jeffrey L. Greene (Greene) \r\n  was Cendantâ€™s local representative and was the usual point of contact between \r\n  the Firm and Cendant.Â  Respondent was aware that Greene was also the principal \r\n  point of contact between the Stegall entities and Cendant.Â  Respondent knew \r\n  Greene approved financing for borrowers of mobile home and land package sales \r\n  made by Stegall entities.Â  \r\nOn or about June 4, 2001, respondent closed a transaction where Greene was \r\n  the borrower. [2] Â  The transaction \r\n  was not financed by Cendant.Â  The transaction was modified, not only to cause \r\n  Greene to be forgiven of â€œcash from borrowerâ€ as shown on line 303 of the HUD-1 \r\n  statement in the amount of $18,147.43, but also to cause Greene to leave the \r\n  transaction with a check drawn on the Firmâ€™s trust account as a â€œrefundâ€ in \r\n  the amount of $3,000.Â  This change was directed by a Stegall representative \r\n  to the Firmâ€™s paralegal.Â  The paralegal made pen and ink notations on the balance \r\n  sheet to reflect these changes.Â  An addendum to the HUD-1 statement was prepared \r\n  to reflect these changes and was presented by respondent to the parties for \r\n  their signatures at closing.Â  The HUD-1 statement sent to the lender does not \r\n  mention a â€œrefundâ€ to Greene and does not reflect the $18,147.83 â€œgiftâ€ from \r\n  a Stegall entity to Greene negating the â€œcash from borrowerâ€ information on \r\n  line 303.Â  The addendum was not furnished to the lender.Â  \r\nIn another transaction, [3]  \r\n  the HUD-1 statement sent to the lender shows â€œcash from borrowerâ€ in the amount \r\n  of $2,038.12.Â  There is no indication of a corresponding deposit in the Firmâ€™s \r\n  trust account.Â  The HUD-1 statement sent to the lender reflects a $43,750 deposit, \r\n  but there is no record of a deposit in that amount to the Firmâ€™s trust account.Â  \r\n\r\nIn connection with this transaction, the Firmâ€™s trust account reveals the deposit \r\n  of loan proceeds of $76,830.40 and deposit of a check â€œfromÂ  buyerâ€ (drawn on \r\n  a BB&amp;T account) in the amount of $37,500.Â  Respondent knew the Stegall entities \r\n  banked with BB&amp;T.Â  There is a disbursement from respondentâ€™s trust account \r\n  to a Stegall entity in the exact amount of $37,500 and a refund to Stegall individually \r\n  of $1,389.Â  Amounts due to the Stegall entity are reduced on the balance sheet \r\n  to reflect the foregoing and to cause the balance sheet and the corresponding \r\n  disbursements from the trust account to be in balance.Â  The HUD-1 statement \r\n  sent to the lender was not amended to correspond to the actual disbursements \r\n  made out of the Firmâ€™s trust account at the direction and/or approval of respondent.Â  \r\n  The HUD-1 statement contains no mention of either the $37,500 (either coming \r\n  into or going out of the Firmâ€™s trust account) or Stegall, individually, receiving \r\n  a refund or even being involved in the transaction.Â  \r\nAt some point, respondent became concerned whether borrowers were making the \r\n  â€œcash from borrowerâ€ payments directly to the Stegall entities.Â  According, \r\n  respondent began requiring presentation of a cashierâ€™s check for the â€œcash for \r\n  borrowersâ€ at the closing.Â  In approximately thirteen transactions, the cashierâ€™s \r\n  checks were prepared by BB&amp;T and delivered by Stegall employees to respondentâ€™s \r\n  staff.Â  Respondent is now informed and believes the Stegall entities furnished \r\n  most, if not all, of the money to purchase the cashierâ€™s checks, but this was \r\n  not known by respondent until it came to light during discovery in the Cendant \r\n  case.Â  See infra.Â  Â \r\nGreene was indicted.Â  He pled guilty in the United States District Court to \r\n  one count of wire fraud and was sentenced to five years probation and restitution \r\n  in connection with fraudulent dealings with Stegall and Ashmore to the detriment \r\n  of Cendant and other lenders who purchased loans with inflated property values.Â  \r\n  In his plea agreement, Greene admitted deriving between $1,500,000 and $2,500,000 \r\n  from his scheme with Stegall and Ashmore. \r\nWith information available from criminal proceedings and related civil litigation \r\n  after the closings, it now appears that the accommodations in the foregoing \r\n  transactions by Stegall entities to Greene were in return for Greene inducing \r\n  Cendant to make loans on inflated mobile home and/or land packages to borrowers \r\n  who were buying from Stegall entities.Â  Respondent was unaware of Stegall and \r\n  Greeneâ€™s arrangement concerning the Cendant loans.Â  \r\nStegall and Ashmore were also indicted in the United States District Court \r\n  in connection with defrauding lenders in conspiracy with Greene.Â  Stegall pled \r\n  guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced to eighteen months in prison.Â  \r\n  In his plea agreement, Stegall admitted deriving $3,075,000 from the real estate \r\n  transactions related to his plea.Â  One or more of the transactions mentioned \r\n  in the information to which Stegall pled guilty were closed by the Firm.Â  \r\nAs a result of the foregoing, Cendant initiated litigation against the Firm.Â  \r\n  Cendant was paid $750,000 as settlement on behalf of the Firm.Â  Five hundred \r\n  and seventy five thousand dollars of this amount was paid by the Firmâ€™s insurance \r\n  carrier and the remainder was paid by the Firm or respondent and his partner. \r\n\r\nAdditional Facts\r\nODCâ€™s investigation reveals respondent did not receive any special financial \r\n  benefit from the closings investigated by ODC.Â  All fees received are shown \r\n  on the Firmâ€™s class report; the fees appear to be reasonable and customary for \r\n  work of this type in Greenville.Â Â Â  \r\nODC does not allege respondent deliberately sought to assist Cromer, Caldwell, \r\n  Stegall, Ashmore, or Greene in criminal undertakings or had knowledge of their \r\n  criminal intent.Â  However, submitting HUD-1 Settlement Statements to lenders \r\n  which were at variance with receipts and disbursements from the Firmâ€™s trust \r\n  account enabled these people to break the law.Â  With the advantage of hindsight \r\n  and discovery of criminal activity, respondent now recognizes there were â€œred \r\n  flagsâ€ which should have alerted him that the Cromer Company and the Stegall \r\n  entities were seeking to mislead lenders, particularly in closing transactions \r\n  where Stegall entities effectively gave money to Greene who was originating \r\n  loans from Cendant to borrowers purchasing mobile home and land packages from \r\n  Stegall entities. \r\nIt now appears that in many of the mobile home and land package transactions \r\n  respondent closed for the Cromer Company and the Stegall entities, borrowers \r\n  paid no money into the transactions.Â  Instead, these sellers were seeking to \r\n  close the transactions without the borrowers contributing their own money as \r\n  an inducement for borrowers to close the transactions with their businesses.Â  \r\n  This information was not known to respondent until after the closing of all \r\n  of these transactions.Â  Respondent represents that he was unaware of the Stegall \r\n  entitiesâ€™ duplicity concerning the use of cashierâ€™s checks in thirteen closings.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall \r\n  provide competent representation to client); Rule 1.2(e) (when lawyer knows \r\n  client expects assistance not permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct \r\n  or other law, lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant limitations \r\n  on the lawyer's conduct); Rule 4.1(a) (in the course of representing a client, \r\n  lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to \r\n  a third person); Rule 4.1(b) (in the course of representing a client, lawyer \r\n  not fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary \r\n  to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure \r\n  is prohibited by Rule 1.6); Rule 5.1(a) (partner in a law firm shall make reasonable \r\n  efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance \r\n  that all lawyers in the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  Rule 5.3(b) (with respect to a nonlawyer employee, lawyer having direct supervisory \r\n  authority over the nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the \r\n  personâ€™s conduct is compatible with professional obligations of the lawyer); \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) \r\n  (lawyer shall not commit criminal act that reflects adversely on lawyerâ€™s honesty, \r\n  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer \r\n  shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration \r\n  of justice). Â In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation \r\n  of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall \r\n  not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction \r\n  regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(4) (lawyer shall not be \r\n  convicted of crime of moral turpitude or serious crime); and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer \r\n  shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice \r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating \r\n  an unfitness to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent \r\n  from the practice of law for a six month period, retroactive to the date of \r\n  his interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent \r\n  shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied \r\n  with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nThe Court is troubled by the recent number of real estate transactions which \r\n  have been the subject of misleading, fraudulent, and/or criminal schemes.Â  Inaccurate \r\n  HUD-1 Settlement Statements and other closing documents contribute to these \r\n  deceptive activities.Â  Respondentâ€™s misconduct derives principally from his \r\n  inaccurate representations on HUD-1 Settlement Statements.Â  These misrepresentations \r\n  have subjected respondent to both federal criminal penalties and the current \r\n  disciplinary action by this Court.\r\nIn addition to completing HUD-1 Settlement Statements, attorneys prepare their \r\n  own settlement statements. These documents, too, must also correctly reflect \r\n  the underlying financial transaction by the parties in order for the buyer, \r\n  seller, and others to have an accurate record of the transaction.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccording to the parties in this matter, a large number of attorneys are not \r\n  passing closing funds through their trust accounts and, at the same time, not \r\n  identifying the funds as paid outside of closing on closing documents.Â  Not \r\n  only does this practice fail to accurately record the actual transaction for \r\n  the buyer and seller, but it is misleading to lenders.Â  In an attempt to eliminate \r\n  this and other deceptive practices, we emphasize that costs and credits in connection \r\n  with a real estate transaction must be shown on the settlement statement and \r\n  that the settlement statement must reflect all amounts paid, by whom paid, and \r\n  to whom paid.Â  Any charges or amounts paid outside of the closing must be reflected \r\n  as such on the settlement statement (i.e., â€œPOCâ€).Â  For all funds exchanged \r\n  during the closing, the attorney must have a record of the method of payment \r\n  by the parties to the transaction, as well as an accounting of all receipts \r\n  and disbursements by the attorney.Â  The attorneyâ€™s records must accurately reflect \r\n  the transaction as evidenced by the settlement statement unless there is written \r\n  documentation signed by all parties to the transaction (including any lender) \r\n  indicating that funds were disbursed otherwise.Â  Failure to comply with these \r\n  standards may subject attorneys to disciplinary action.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    In the lending business, this technique is referred to as â€œshorting the seller.â€Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] This was one of the fourteen \r\n    transactions mentioned above.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    This was one of the fourteen transactions mentioned above.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25843","title":"In the Matter of Ronald F.

Â \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was admitted to practice law in South Carolina on November 5, 1976.Â  \r\n  He is a partner in the law firm of Lathan and Barbare (Firm) with his partner \r\n  Ray D. Lathan (Partner).Â  Respondent and partner are the only two attorneys \r\n  employed by the Firm. \r\nThe Firmâ€™s primary practice is the closing of real estate transactions.Â  The \r\n  Firm handles approximately 1400 to 1600 real estate closings per year.Â  \r\nOn or about November 19, 2003, respondent and his partner pled guilty before \r\n  the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina to one count \r\n  of violation 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1010, a felony.Â  The information to which respondent \r\n  pled guilty provided that he falsely certified that he had received cash from \r\n  borrowers in amounts reported on HUD-1 Settlement Statements he prepared and \r\n  submitted to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development when \r\n  respondent did not receive the cash.Â Â  \r\nBecause of cooperation with federal authorities into matters related to the \r\n  information and to other investigations, the United States Attorney made a motion \r\n  for downward departure.Â  Both respondent and his partner received favorable \r\n  recommendations in the pre-sentencing report submitted by the United States \r\n  Probation Department.Â  Both respondent and his partner were sentenced to pay \r\n  a fine of $5,000 as final disposition of their pleas; both have paid those fines.Â  \r\n\r\nFirmâ€™s General Procedure for Closing Real Estate Transactions\r\nThe Firmâ€™s paralegal was the principal point of contact between the Firm and \r\n  the seller.Â  The paralegal reviewed the lenderâ€™s instructions and the contract \r\n  of sale and prepared closing documents and a balance sheet showing incoming \r\n  funds and disbursements.Â  Changes to the transaction were conveyed by the seller \r\n  to the paralegal who would then make pen and ink changes on the Firmâ€™s in-house \r\n  balance sheet reflecting the changes directed by the seller.Â  \r\nAnother Firm employee then prepared checks for disbursement in accordance with \r\n  the balance sheet, including any pen and ink changes prepared by the paralegal. \r\n  Thereafter, the employee prepared a class report showing the disbursements made \r\n  out of the Firmâ€™s trust account in connection with each transaction.Â  \r\nRespondent or his partner reviewed the various closing documents, attended \r\n  the closing with the seller and borrower, and gave instructions to the Firm \r\n  staff for the conclusion of transactions.Â Â  Respondent or his partner attended \r\n  and supervised all closings. \r\nGenerally, there were no direct communications between the Firm and the borrowers \r\n  prior to closing.Â  In general, neither respondent nor his partner had any communications \r\n  with the seller concerning an individual transaction prior to closing.Â  \r\nCromer Company Transactions\r\nRespondent and his partner served as closing attorneys in a number of real \r\n  estate transactions where the Cromer Company was the seller of mobile home and \r\n  land packages.Â  The principal owner of the Cromer Company was A. Eugene Cromer \r\n  (Cromer).Â  Melissa Caldwell (Caldwell) was an employee of the Cromer Company \r\n  and was often the principal point of contact between the Cromer Company and \r\n  the Firm.Â  \r\nOn approximately four occasions, respondent closed loans for the Cromer Company \r\n  where the HUD-1 Settlement Statements reflected that certain sums of money on \r\n  line 303 â€œcash from borrowerâ€ had been paid by borrowers at closing when the \r\n  balance sheet (in-house schedule of incoming funds and disbursements) and the \r\n  Firmâ€™s class report (trust account ledger) showed no money had been received \r\n  into the Firmâ€™s trust account.Â  On these occasions, no money was received by \r\n  the Firm from borrowers.Â  \r\nRespondent represents that Cromer or a representative of his company advised \r\n  the Firm staff, probably the paralegal, that this amount had been paid by borrowers \r\n  directly to the Cromer Company.Â  Thereafter, the paralegal made pen and ink \r\n  changes to the balance sheet to reflect that no â€œcash from borrowersâ€ was received \r\n  at closing and reduced the â€œcash to sellerâ€ on line 603 of the HUD-1 statements \r\n  by the amount of the â€œcash from borrowerâ€ shown on line 303. [1] Â  However, the HUD-1 forms submitted \r\n  to the lenders were not amended and continued to show an amount of â€œcash from \r\n  borrowerâ€ on line 303 and no notation of â€œPOCâ€ (a standard abbreviation for \r\n  â€œpaid outside of closingâ€).Â  The HUD-1 forms contained the standard statement \r\n  signed by respondent to the effect â€œthe HUD-1 Settlement Statement which I have \r\n  prepared is a true and accurate account of this transaction.Â  I have caused \r\n  the funds to be disbursed in accordance with this statement.â€Â  The HUD-1 forms \r\n  were forwarded to the lenders as originally drafted,Â  without the pen and ink \r\n  changes noted on the balance sheets.Â  \r\nRespondent is now informed and believes that the representations from the Cromer \r\n  Company that the amount â€œdue from borrowerâ€ in these transactions occasions \r\n  had been paid directly by borrowers to the Cromer Company were false, that there \r\n  was (at least in most instances) no money paid from the borrowers as represented \r\n  on line 303 of the HUD-1 forms and that Cromerâ€™s misrepresentations were in \r\n  furtherance of his scheme to sell mobile home and land packages to borrowers \r\n  without the borrowers having to contribute any money to the transactions.Â  As \r\n  a result, it now appears that the representations made by respondent concerning \r\n  the information on lines 303 and 603 of the HUD-1 statements were incorrect.Â  \r\n  The inaccurate report had the tendency to cause lenders to believe that borrowers \r\n  had invested money in the transactions when, in fact, the borrowers had not, \r\n  and caused the price of the package to be inflated by the amounts shown on line \r\n  303 of the HUD-1 forms.Â Â  \r\nCromer and Caldwell were indicted in the United States District Court in connection \r\n  with one or more transactions closed by the Firm where the Cromer Company was \r\n  the seller.Â  An allegation in Cromerâ€™s indictment states Cromer made false statements \r\n  concerning down payments (information on line 202 of HUD-1 forms) and â€œcash \r\n  from borrowersâ€ (information on line 303 of HUD-1 forms).Â  Cromer pled guilty \r\n  to one count of mail and wire fraud in connection with these transactions and \r\n  was sentenced to eighteen months in prison.Â  In his plea agreement, Cromer admitted \r\n  he had derived between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 in benefits from his scheme.Â  \r\n\r\nODC does not contend that either respondent or his partner were aware of Cromer \r\n  and Caldwellâ€™s criminal activities or of the amount of the money involved.Â  \r\n  Instead, ODC contends respondentâ€™s failure to either amend line 303 and line \r\n  603 to reflect â€œno cash from borrowerâ€ received by the Firm or to place the \r\n  notation â€œPOCâ€ by the line 303 data made it possible for Cromer to engage in \r\n  the criminal activity stated in the Cromer indictment.Â Â  \r\nIn approximately twelve transactions in which the Cromer Company was the seller \r\n  and the Firm served as closing agent, borrowers made claims or, in some cases, \r\n  initiated litigation, against the Firm.Â  The Firm and/or respondent and his \r\n  partner and their insurance carrier paid $2,500 per case to settle the claims.Â  \r\n\r\nStegall Entities Transactions\r\nFor many years, the Firm handled numerous real estate transactions for several \r\n  entities owned and managed by Donald L. Stegall (Stegall).Â  Respondent served \r\n  as closing attorney in approximately nineteen transactions where Stegall entities \r\n  were the sellers of mobile home and land packages.Â  \r\nIn each of these nineteen transactions, the HUD-1 statements and Firm balance \r\n  sheets were prepared by the Firmâ€™s paralegal based on information from contracts \r\n  of sale, information in the lenderâ€™s loan closing instructions, and/or instructions \r\n  from Stegall employees, usually Teresa Ashmore (Ashmore).Â  In each of the transactions, \r\n  both line 303 on the HUD-1 statement and the balance sheet would initially reflect \r\n  amounts of money to be paid by the borrower at closing.Â  Prior to closing, Ashmore \r\n  would instruct the paralegal to make changes, primarily reducing the amount \r\n  of â€œcash from borrowerâ€ to zero and making corresponding reductions in â€œcash \r\n  to sellerâ€ on line 603 and, in other cases, directing other changes in disbursements \r\n  to Stegall entities to cause the disbursements to balance. \r\nThe changes made by the paralegal at Ashmoreâ€™s directions were not reflected \r\n  on the HUD-1 forms which were sent to the lenders.Â  In each of these transactions, \r\n  the HUD-1 statement contained a certification signed by respondent, as settlement \r\n  agent, to the effect â€œthe HUD-1 Settlement Statement which I have prepared is \r\n  a true and accurate account of this transaction.Â  I have caused the funds to \r\n  be disbursed in accordance with this statement.â€Â  None of the nineteen settlement \r\n  statements contained the notation â€œPOCâ€ beside line 303 â€œcash from borrowerâ€ \r\n  even though this amount was not received by the Firm.Â  Accordingly, there was \r\n  a variance in the information furnished to the lenders on the HUD-1 statements \r\n  and the actual disbursements made out of the Firmâ€™s trust account in connection \r\n  with these transactions.Â  \r\nIn thirteen of the Stegall closings, addendums to the HUD-1 statements were \r\n  prepared by the Firmâ€™s staff and executed by the parties.Â  The effect of the \r\n  addendums was to reduce to writing the changes which had been directed by Stegall \r\n  employees, usually Ashmore, and made to the balance sheet by the paralegal.Â  \r\n  The addendums were not sent to the lenders.Â  \r\nIn one Stegall transaction, respondent closed loans for Borrower F.Â  Because \r\n  the transaction was insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an \r\n  FHA Addendum was required.Â  The borrower and seller signed certifications on \r\n  the FHA Addendum presented by respondent stating that there had not been any \r\n  reimbursement for any cash down payment or closing costs not disclosed to the \r\n  lender.Â  Respondent signed the certification on the FHA required addendum that \r\n  the HUD was â€œ . . . a true and accurate account of the funds that were (i) received \r\n  or (ii) paid outside of closing, and the funds received have been or will be \r\n  disbursed by [respondent] as part of the settlement of this transaction.â€Â  \r\nThe HUD-1 statement sent by respondent to the lender also contained the standard \r\n  certification signed by respondent as the settlement agent.Â  The HUD-1 statement \r\n  sent to the lender showed $6,955.67 â€œcash from borrower,â€ however no cash from \r\n  borrower was received by respondent or the Firm in connection with the transaction \r\n  and the amount actually paid to the seller was reduced by the amount â€œdue from \r\n  borrower.â€Â  As a result, there was a variance in the information furnished the \r\n  lender on the HUD-1 statement and the FHA required addendum and the actual disbursements, \r\n  made from the Firmâ€™s trust account and this, in turn, caused respondentsâ€™ certifications \r\n  to be incorrect.Â  \r\nMany of the transactions handled by the Firm for the Stegall entities were \r\n  funded by Cendant Mortgage Corporation (Cendant).Â  Jeffrey L. Greene (Greene) \r\n  was Cendantâ€™s local representative and was the usual point of contact between \r\n  the Firm and Cendant.Â  Respondent was aware that Greene was also the principal \r\n  point of contact between the Stegall entities and Cendant.Â  Respondent knew \r\n  Greene approved financing for borrowers of mobile home and land package sales \r\n  made by Stegall entities.Â  \r\nOn May 17, 2000, respondent closed a real estate transaction for Seller H to \r\n  Buyer L involving real property at 13 Hillside Circle in Greenville.Â  Respondent \r\n  knew that Buyer L was a former employee of Stegall or a Stegall entity.Â  The \r\n  HUD-1 statement reflected the sales price as $55,000 and the â€œcash from borrowerâ€ \r\n  being $55,531.12.Â  \r\nThe same day, respondent closed another transaction \r\n  where Buyer L sold the same property to Greene.Â  This second transaction was \r\n  funded by a lender other than Cendant.Â  The HUD-1 statement in this transaction \r\n  reflected a sales price of $80,000 and â€œcash from borrower (Greene) as $11,735.77.Â  \r\n  An addendum to the settlement statement, signed by respondent, stated â€œcash \r\n  to sellerâ€ was reduced by the exact amount of â€œcash from borrower.â€Â  \r\nAccording to the class report, the loan proceeds from the lender in the second \r\n  transaction were the only funds received by respondent for both transactions.Â  \r\n  A Firm check in the amount of $55,531,12 - paid out of the second transaction \r\n  - represented the â€œcash from borrowerâ€ due in the first transaction.Â  \r\nThe above activities on May 17, 2000, are known as \r\n  a â€œflip transactionâ€ where proceeds from the second transaction are used to \r\n  fund the initial transaction.Â  For the HUD-1 statement in the first transaction \r\n  to have been accurate, the â€œcash from borrowerâ€ should have been $0 and the \r\n  $55,531.12 should have been shown under â€œamounts paid by or on behalf of borrowerâ€ \r\n  under a line in the 200 column of the HUD form. \r\nÂ For the HUD-1 statement in the second transaction \r\n  to have been accurate, the $55,531.12 and the $11,735.77 (the amount the seller \r\n  gave Greene) should have been shown under â€œreduction in amount due sellerâ€ under \r\n  a line in the 500 column of the HUD and the â€œcash to sellerâ€ reduced to $11,987.24 \r\n  which was the amount disbursed to seller.Â  On this HUD-1 form, the â€œcash from \r\n  borrowerâ€ should have been shown as $0 because Greene paid no cash at the closing. \r\n\r\nThe flip transaction allowed Greene to acquire the \r\n  property using only the proceeds from the loan notwithstanding the fact that \r\n  the HUD-1 sent to the lender indicated Greene had contributed $11,735.77 to \r\n  the transaction.Â  In effect, the seller (original Buyer L) simply gave Greene \r\n  $11,735.77.Â  \r\nAll of the foregoing resulted in the information furnished \r\n  to the lender in the second transaction to be at variance with the disbursements \r\n  actually made from the Firmâ€™s trust account as reflected on the class report.Â  \r\n  In addition, the lender was not provided with a copy of the addendum to the \r\n  settlement statement.Â  \r\nOn January 5, 2001, respondent served as the closing \r\n  attorney in a transaction whereby Greene purchased real property at 109 Pine \r\n  Ridge Lane in Greenville from a Stegall entity. The transaction was financed \r\n  by a lender other than Cendant.Â  \r\nThe HUD-1 form reflects earnest money or a deposit \r\n  of $6,616.03 on line 201 and â€œcash from borrowerâ€ of $5,954.13.Â  Line 603 reflects \r\n  â€œcash to sellerâ€ of $79,683.97.Â  However, respondent had the parties sign an \r\n  addendum showing â€œcredit to buyerâ€ of $13,300, and a corresponding reduction \r\n  of the amount due seller, resulting inÂ  â€œcash due to buyerâ€ of $7,345.87.Â  The \r\n  Firmâ€™s class report reflects that the only deposit into the Firmâ€™s trust account \r\n  in connection with this transaction were the loan proceeds.Â  The class report \r\n  shows a refund to Greene of $7,345,87 (paid by a check in the amount of $6,345.87 \r\n  and the withholding of a $1,000 judgment lien).Â  Consequently, Greene, the buyer, \r\n  (who is shown on the HUD-1 form as contributing $5,954.13 to the transaction) \r\n  received $7,345.87.Â  The HUD-1 form was submitted to the lender without being \r\n  amended to conform to the balance sheet and actual disbursements.Â  The addendum \r\n  was not submitted to the lender.Â  \r\nOn January 30, 2001, Greene purchased real property \r\n  at 116 Blackbird Lane in Greenville.Â  The mobile home was purchased from LUV \r\n  Homes and the land from a Stegall entity.Â  Respondent served as the closing \r\n  attorney.Â  A lender other than Cendant financed the transaction.Â  \r\nThe HUD-1 furnished to the lender reflects â€œcash from \r\n  borrowerâ€ on line 303 as $13,268.56 and â€œcash to sellerâ€ on line 603 as $84,700.Â  \r\n  The sales price of the lot is shown on the HUD-1 form.\r\nHowever, LUV Homes and respondent signed an addendum \r\n  that shows a credit to Greene as â€œfunds from sellerâ€ of $25,031.44, reducing \r\n  the â€œdue sellerâ€ by a like amount, resulting in the â€œdue to borrowerâ€ to be \r\n  $11,762.44.Â  A second addendum for the lot sale shows the sales price of the \r\n  lot reduced by a release fee, payoff, and closing costs.Â  The Firmâ€™s balance \r\n  sheet and class report show a disbursement to Greene of $11,762.44 and reflect \r\n  that the only deposit was for the loan proceeds.Â  The class report reflects \r\n  a disbursement of $9,312.00 to Twin Lakes, a Stegall entity, notwithstanding \r\n  the fact that this entity is not mentioned anywhere on the HUD-1 form.Â  This \r\n  amount was shown on the second addendum which accounted for the funds on the \r\n  lot sale.Â  \r\nOn January 2, 2001, respondent served as the closing \r\n  attorney in a transaction whereby Sellers H and W sold property at 4008 Shady \r\n  Grove in Honea Path to Buyer B.Â  The HUD furnished to the lender, Cendant, shows \r\n  $4,000 in earnest money on line 201, â€œcash from borrowersâ€ of $960.55, and â€œcash \r\n  to sellerâ€ of $11,261.53.Â  However, the Firmâ€™s file contains two letters addressed \r\n  to respondent.Â  One of these letters, signed by Sellers H and W, states â€œ . \r\n  . . disburse all the net proceeds . . . to . . . Buyer B omitting our names.â€Â  \r\n  The second letter addressed to respondent is from Buyer B instructing respondent \r\n  â€œ . . . disburse the net proceeds in the approximate amount to [Greene] omitting \r\n  my name.â€Â  Respondent did not furnish either of these letters to Cendant.Â  Contrary \r\n  to the information on the HUD-1 furnished to Cendant as lender, the class report \r\n  shows respondent did not receive the $960.55 from the borrower.Â  The class report \r\n  also shows a disbursement to Greene, notwithstanding the fact that Greeneâ€™s \r\n  name appears nowhere on the HUD-1 form and that he has no apparent relationship \r\n  to the transaction.Â Â  \r\nAt some point, respondent became concerned whether borrowers were making the \r\n  â€œcash from borrowerâ€ payments directly to the Stegall entities.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  respondent began requiring presentation of a cashierâ€™s check for the â€œcash for \r\n  borrowersâ€ at closings.Â  Respondent handled approximately five transactions \r\n  in which he required cashierâ€™s checks.Â  The cashierâ€™s checks were usually prepared \r\n  by BB&amp;T (where respondent knew the Stegall entities banked) and delivered \r\n  by Stegall employees to respondentâ€™s staff.Â  Respondent is now informed and \r\n  believes the Stegall entities furnished the money to purchase the cashierâ€™s \r\n  checks, but this was not known by respondent until it came to light during discovery \r\n  in the Cendant case.Â  See infra.Â  Â \r\nGreene was indicted.Â  He pled guilty in the United States District Court to \r\n  one count of wire fraud and was sentenced to five years probation and restitution \r\n  in connection with fraudulent dealings with Stegall and Ashmore to the detriment \r\n  of Cendant and other lenders who purchased loans with inflated property values.Â  \r\n  In his plea agreement, Greene admitted deriving between $1,500,000 and $2,500,000 \r\n  from his scheme with Stegall and Ashmore. \r\nWith information available from criminal proceedings and related civil litigation \r\n  after the closings, it now appears that the accommodations in the foregoing \r\n  transactions by Stegall entities to Greene were in return for Greene inducing \r\n  Cendant to make loans on inflated mobile home and/or land packages to borrowers \r\n  who were buying from Stegall entities.Â  Respondent was unaware of Stegall and \r\n  Greeneâ€™s arrangement concerning the Cendant loans.Â  \r\nStegall and Ashmore were also indicted in the United States District Court \r\n  in connection with defrauding lenders in conspiracy with Greene.Â  Stegall pled \r\n  guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced to eighteen months in prison.Â  \r\n  In his plea agreement, Stegall admitted deriving $3,075,000 from the real estate \r\n  transactions related to his plea.Â  One or more of the transactions mentioned \r\n  in the information to which Stegall pled guilty were closed by the Firm.Â  \r\nAs a result of the foregoing, Cendant initiated litigation against the Firm.Â  \r\n  Cendant was paid $750,000 as settlement on behalf of the Firm.Â  Five hundred \r\n  and seventy five thousand dollars of this amount was paid by the Firmâ€™s insurance \r\n  carrier and the remainder was paid by the Firm or respondent and his partner. \r\n\r\nAdditional Facts\r\nODCâ€™s investigation reveals respondent did not receive any special financial \r\n  benefit from the closings investigated by ODC.Â  All fees received are shown \r\n  on the Firmâ€™s class report; the fees appear to be reasonable and customary for \r\n  work of this type in Greenville.Â Â Â  \r\nODC does not allege respondent deliberately sought to assist Cromer, Caldwell, \r\n  Stegall, Ashmore, or Greene in criminal undertakings or had knowledge of their \r\n  criminal intent.Â  However, submitting HUD-1 Settlement Statements to lenders \r\n  which were at variance with receipts and disbursements from the Firmâ€™s trust \r\n  account enabled these people to break the law.Â  With the advantage of hindsight \r\n  and discovery of criminal activity, respondent now recognizes there were â€œred \r\n  flagsâ€ which should have alerted him that the Cromer Company and the Stegall \r\n  entities were seeking to mislead lenders, particularly in closing transactions \r\n  where Stegall entities effectively gave money to Greene who was originating \r\n  loans from Cendant to borrowers purchasing mobile home and land packages from \r\n  Stegall entities. \r\nIt now appears that in many of the mobile home and land package transactions \r\n  respondent closed for the Cromer Company and the Stegall entities, borrowers \r\n  paid no money into the transactions.Â  Instead, these sellers were seeking to \r\n  close the transactions without the borrowers contributing their own money as \r\n  an inducement for borrowers to close the transactions with their businesses.Â  \r\n  This information was not known to respondent until after the closing of all \r\n  of these transactions.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall \r\n  provide competent representation to client); Rule 1.2(e) (when lawyer knows \r\n  client expects assistance not permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct \r\n  or other law, lawyer shall consult with the client regarding the relevant limitations \r\n  on the lawyer's conduct); Rule 4.1(a) (in the course of representing a client, \r\n  lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to \r\n  a third person); Rule 4.1(b) (in the course of representing a client, lawyer \r\n  not fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary \r\n  to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client, unless disclosure \r\n  is prohibited by Rule 1.6); Rule 5.1(a) (partner in a law firm shall make reasonable \r\n  efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance \r\n  that all lawyers in the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  Rule 5.3(b) (with respect to a nonlawyer employee, lawyer having direct supervisory \r\n  authority over the nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the \r\n  personâ€™s conduct is compatible with professional obligations of the lawyer); \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) \r\n  (lawyer shall not commit criminal act that reflects adversely on lawyerâ€™s honesty, \r\n  trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer \r\n  shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration \r\n  of justice). Â In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation \r\n  of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall \r\n  not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction \r\n  regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(4) (lawyer shall not be \r\n  convicted of crime of moral turpitude or serious crime); and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer \r\n  shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice \r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating \r\n  an unfitness to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent \r\n  from the practice of law for a six month period, retroactive to the date of \r\n  his interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent \r\n  shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied \r\n  with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nThe Court is troubled by the recent number of real estate transactions which \r\n  have been the subject of misleading, fraudulent, and/or criminal schemes.Â  Inaccurate \r\n  HUD-1 Settlement Statements and other closing documents contribute to these \r\n  deceptive activities.Â  Respondentâ€™s misconduct derives principally from his \r\n  inaccurate representations on HUD-1 Settlement Statements.Â  These misrepresentations \r\n  have subjected respondent to both federal criminal penalties and the current \r\n  disciplinary action by this Court.\r\nIn addition to completing HUD-1 Settlement Statements, attorneys prepare their \r\n  own settlement statements. These documents, too, must also correctly reflect \r\n  the underlying financial transaction by the parties in order for the buyer, \r\n  seller, and others to have an accurate record of the transaction.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccording to the parties in this matter, a large number of attorneys are not \r\n  passing closing funds through their trust accounts and, at the same time, not \r\n  identifying the funds as paid outside of closing on closing documents.Â  Not \r\n  only does this practice fail to accurately record the actual transaction for \r\n  the buyer and seller, but it is misleading to lenders.Â  In an attempt to eliminate \r\n  this and other deceptive practices, we emphasize that costs and credits in connection \r\n  with a real estate transaction must be shown on the settlement statement and \r\n  that the settlement statement must reflect all amounts paid, by whom paid, and \r\n  to whom paid.Â  Any charges or amounts paid outside of the closing must be reflected \r\n  as such on the settlement statement (i.e., â€œPOCâ€).Â  For all funds exchanged \r\n  during the closing, the attorney must have a record of the method of payment \r\n  by the parties to the transaction, as well as an accounting of all receipts \r\n  and disbursements by the attorney.Â  The attorneyâ€™s records must accurately reflect \r\n  the transaction as evidenced by the settlement statement unless there is written \r\n  documentation signed by all parties to the transaction (including any lender) \r\n  indicating that funds were disbursed otherwise.Â  Failure to comply with these \r\n  standards may subject attorneys to disciplinary action.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    In the lending business, this technique is referred to as â€œshorting the seller.â€Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25844","title":"Ledger v.

Hazelwood, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant The Gaffney Ledger (Newspaper) was publicly \r\n  reprimanded for violating the Ethics Reform Act.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 13, 2000, Boyd McLean filed a complaint with respondent State \r\n  Ethics Commission (Commission) alleging Newspaper had violated S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 8-13-1354 (Supp. 2003) by publishing a political advertisement without identifying \r\n  who had paid for it.Â  The Commission subsequently informed McLean that his complaint \r\n  failed to allege sufficient facts to constitute a violation of the ethics law. [1]   \r\nAfter dismissal of the complaint, \r\n  Newspaper published an article written by its staff writer stating that the \r\n  complaint had been â€œtossed out.â€Â  McLean then filed this action with the Commission \r\n  alleging Newspaper had violated the confidentiality requirements of the Ethics \r\n  Reform Act.Â  Newspaper was publicly reprimanded by the Commission.Â  The circuit \r\n  court affirmed.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid Newspaper violate the confidentiality \r\n  requirements of the Ethics Reform Act?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSection 8-13-320 of the Act authorizes \r\n  the Commission to â€œinitiate or receive complaints and make investigationsâ€ of \r\n  ethics violations involving public officials. \r\n  [2] Â  Under subsection (9)(c), if an alleged violation is found to be groundless, \r\n  â€œthe entire matter must be stricken from public record.â€Â Â  Subsection 10(b) \r\n  further provides:\r\n\r\n(b) If the commission \r\n  or its executive director determines that the complaint does not allege facts \r\n  sufficient to constitute a violation, the commission must dismiss the complaint \r\n  and notify the complainant and respondent.Â  The entire matter must be stricken \r\n  from public record unless the respondent, by written authorization, waives the \r\n  confidentiality of the existence of the complaint and authorizes the release \r\n  of information about the disposition of the complaint. [3] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Following this \r\n  section are other provisions in subsection (10) governing proceedings after \r\n  an initial finding of probable cause.Â  Subsection (10)(g) then provides:\r\n\r\n(g) All investigations, \r\n  inquiries, hearings, and accompanying documents must remain confidential \r\n  until final disposition of a matter unless the respondent waives the right to \r\n  confidentiality.Â  The wilful release of confidential information is a misdemeanor, \r\n  and any person releasing such confidential information, upon conviction, must \r\n  be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than one \r\n  year.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Commission found Newspaper \r\n  violated Â§ 8-13-320(10)(b) because Newspaper did not file a written waiver with \r\n  the Commission before it published the article about dismissal of the complaint.Â  \r\n  The Commission concluded subsection (10)(g) did not apply because the \r\n  complaint was dismissed at the â€œfacts sufficientâ€ stage of the proceedings.Â  \r\n  On appeal, Newspaper contends subsection (g) applies and therefore it did not \r\n  violate the confidentiality requirement because it waited until â€œfinal dispositionâ€ \r\n  of the complaint to reveal any information.Â  We agree.\r\nA close reading of subsection \r\n  10(b) indicates it applies only to the Commissionâ€™s own record of the proceedings \r\n  and not to public disclosure by a party.Â  This subsection provides that upon \r\n  dismissal of a complaint, the entire matter must be stricken â€œfrom public recordâ€ \r\n  unless the respondent waives confidentiality.Â  Under this statute, when an ethics \r\n  matter ends by dismissal, the Commissionâ€™s record is purged and there is no \r\n  public record of a complaint having been filed unless the respondent authorizes \r\n  the release of information regarding its disposition.Â  This procedure prevents \r\n  disclosure to a third party through discovery of the Commissionâ€™s files unless \r\n  the respondent chooses to allow it.Â  \r\nThere is no confidentiality requirement \r\n  as to the parties, however, once the matter has been dismissed.Â  Subsection \r\n  10(g), and not 10(b), controls a partyâ€™s disclosure of an ethics matter.Â  As \r\n  provided in that subsection, all information remains confidential only until \r\n  final disposition.Â  Accordingly, once an ethics matter is finally resolved by \r\n  dismissal of the complaint, a waiver of confidentiality is no longer necessary \r\n  for disclosure.Â  In this respect, a dismissal is treated the same as any other \r\n  disposition.\r\nWe hold the Commission erred in \r\n  finding Newspaper could not reveal the dismissal of the complaint absent a waiver \r\n  of confidentiality. [4] Â  In light \r\n  of this disposition, we decline to address the constitutional issue raised by \r\n  Newspaper.Â  See Arnold v. Assâ€™n of Citadel Men, 337 S.C. 265, \r\n  523 S.E.2d 757 (1999) (this Court will decline to rule on a constitutional question \r\n  unless the determination is essential to the disposition of a case).Â  \r\nREVERSED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Under \r\n    Â§ 8-13-1354, the party paying for a political advertisement is responsible \r\n    for revealing the payorâ€™s identity.Â  The Commission found Newspaper had not \r\n    paid for the advertisement and therefore did not violate the statute.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Lobbyists \r\n    and persons attempting to illegally influence a public official are included \r\n    under the Act.Â  See Title 2, Chapter 17, and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-13-705 \r\n    (Supp. 2003). Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    While this matter was still pending in circuit court, by amendment effective \r\n    June 26, 2003, this section was amended to add the words â€œto the State Ethics \r\n    Commissionâ€ after the phrase â€œwritten authorization.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] The \r\n    Commission also found Newspaper violated Reg. 52-704(A)(2) by failing to file \r\n    a written waiver of confidentiality with the Commission.Â  Although regulations \r\n    have the force of law, they may not alter or add to the terms of a statute.Â  \r\n    U.S. Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v.

[2] Â  Unable to \r\n  reach her attorney, complainant contacted the Clerk of Court, who informed her \r\n  that no order had been filed. Complainant then contacted the presiding judge \r\n  and spoke to the judgeâ€™s secretary, Doe, who informed complainant that the order \r\n  had been signed and returned to complainantâ€™s attorney.Â  Doe tried unsuccessfully \r\n  to reach complainantâ€™s attorney to clear up the problem.Â  \r\nDoe testified that, after consulting with the judge, she contacted Respondentâ€™s \r\n  office to obtain a copy of the order.Â  Respondentâ€™s secretary informed Doe that \r\n  Respondent did not have a copy of the order.Â  Doe again consulted with the judge, \r\n  who instructed her to telephone Respondent and have him prepare another order.Â  \r\n  Respondent failed to submit a proposed order, and Doe telephoned Respondentâ€™s \r\n  secretary again regarding the order.Â  Respondent did not prepare an order. Â \r\nEventually, in November 2001, the judge prepared \r\n  and filed an order of distribution.Â  The judgeâ€™s order stated, â€œThe Court has \r\n  diligently tried to contact counsel for both parties to correct this situation \r\n  but both attorneys have repeatedly failed to return telephone calls or contact \r\n  the Court in any way.â€\r\nRespondent, appearing pro se, admitted at oral argument that \r\n  Doe may have contacted his secretary regarding the order.Â  However, Respondent \r\n  stated that he had no recollection of the telephone calls.Â  Respondent stated \r\n  he was not aware he had been instructed to prepare an order and did not learn \r\n  that the judge had prepared an order until after Respondent prepared his own \r\n  order. [3] Â  \r\nThe subpanel found there was clear and convincing evidence that Doe placed \r\n  the phone calls to Respondentâ€™s office with instructions to prepare the order.Â  \r\n  The subpanel found that, even if Respondent did not actually receive word that \r\n  he was to draft the order, Respondent was responsible for seeing that messages \r\n  left with his secretary were relayed to him in a timely and accurate manner.\r\nThe subpanel found that Respondentâ€™s lack of diligence violated the following \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 3.2 (Expediting \r\n  Litigation); Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct - Violation of the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct - Prejudice to the Administration of Justice). [4] Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Failure to Respond to Disciplinary Counsel\r\nThe parties stipulated that Respondent was notified of the complaint by letter \r\n  from Disciplinary Counsel dated November 1, 2001.Â  The letter requested a response \r\n  within fifteen days.Â  On December 5, 2001, after Respondent failed to respond, \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel sent Respondent a letter pursuant to In the Matter of \r\n  Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).Â  Disciplinary Counsel received \r\n  no response from Respondent until January 29, 2002, after the full investigation \r\n  was authorized.Â  Respondent has fully cooperated following issuance of the Notice \r\n  of Full Investigation.\r\n  Respondent explained at the hearing that he drafted a timely response to the \r\n  grievance, but that his secretary did not transcribe or mail it in time.Â  The \r\n  subpanel again found that the responsibility for errors or delays caused by \r\n  Respondentâ€™s secretary fell on Respondent, and that it was incumbent upon Respondent \r\n  to see that his response was delivered within the time period requested by Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel.Â  \r\n  The subpanel found that Respondentâ€™s failure to respond to the initial letter \r\n  of complaint and to the Treacy letter violated the following Rules of \r\n  Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 8.1(b) (Bar Admissions and \r\n  Disciplinary Matters); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct -Prejudice to the Administration \r\n  of Justice).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Mitigating and Aggravating Circumstances\r\nThe subpanel noted the circumstances which put Respondent in the \r\n  midst of disciplinary proceedings were initially caused by the delay and inaction \r\n  of complainantâ€™s attorney.Â  The subpanel noted that Respondentâ€™s failure to \r\n  draft the order was minor, which would ordinarily only warrant a caution.Â  However, \r\n  the subpanel also noted that Respondent had a significant disciplinary history, \r\n  which included a Private Reprimand in 1977, a Public Reprimand in 1990, \r\n  [5]  and a second Public Reprimand in 1999. [6] Â  The subpanel found that Respondentâ€™s \r\n  minor misconduct was exacerbated by his failure to timely respond to Disciplinary \r\n  Counselâ€™s inquiry.Â  The subpanel considered Respondentâ€™s cooperation following \r\n  the notice of full investigation, but also noted that Respondent failed to submit \r\n  a proposed Panel Report as the subpanel requested. Â \r\n  The subpanel recommended that Respondent receive a Public Reprimand and that \r\n  he be ordered to pay the costs [7] \r\n   of the proceeding.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which discipline is \r\n  given rests entirely with the Supreme Court.Â  In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, \r\n  551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).Â  The Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law, and is not bound by the panelâ€™s recommendation.Â  In re Larkin, \r\n  336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).Â  The Court must administer the sanction \r\n  it deems appropriate after a thorough review of the record.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAfter a thorough review of the record, we agree with the subpanelâ€™s recommendation \r\n  that Respondent receive a public reprimand.Â  The facts indicate that Respondentâ€™s \r\n  actions regarding the failure to prepare a proposed order were initially caused \r\n  by circumstances beyond his control, namely that the opposing attorney became \r\n  ill and failed to file the order.Â  Respondentâ€™s failure to file the order would \r\n  ordinarily not rise to the level of a public reprimand.Â  However, Respondent \r\n  initially failed to respond to Disciplinary Counselâ€™s inquiry, and he has failed \r\n  to respond to or comply with Disciplinary Counsel in the past.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we issue Respondent a Public Reprimand.Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date \r\n  of this opinion, Respondent must pay the costs associated with this proceeding.Â  \r\n  ($433.64).\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Because the presiding judge was visiting from Aiken and had returned \r\n    to Aiken at the time he signed the order, it appears he instructed complainantâ€™s \r\n    attorney to file the order.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The complainantâ€™s attorney was seriously ill and has since died.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Respondentâ€™s proposed order is included as an exhibit and is dated \r\n    March 2002.Â  There is nothing in the record to show why Respondent prepared \r\n    his own order.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Disciplinary Counsel also alleged that Respondent violated Rule 3.4 \r\n    (Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel).Â  However, the subpanel ruled that \r\n    while Respondent did fail to prepare an order pursuant to the judgeâ€™s instructions, \r\n    Respondentâ€™s failure was not a willful disregard of his obligation.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  In the Matter of Rast, 300 S.C. 423, 388 S.E.2d 776 (1990).Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  \r\n    In the Matter of Rast, 337 S.C. 588, 524 S.E.2d 619 (1999).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  The total costs of the proceedings were $433.64.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25846","title":"Kizer v.

Code Ann. Â§ 5-1-30(A)(4) (Supp. 2003), by which Town established the \r\n  contiguity necessary for incorporation, was unconstitutional as special legislation.Â  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSection 5-1-30 sets forth the requirements for incorporation as follows:\r\n\r\nÂ§ 5-1-30. Prerequisites to \r\n  issuance of corporate certificate to proposed municipality.\r\n  (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before issuing a corporate certificate to a proposed \r\n  municipality, the Secretary of State shall first determine:\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; that the area seeking to be incorporated has a\r\nÂ population density of at least three hundred persons a square mile according \r\n  to the latest official United States Census;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that no part of the area is within five \r\n  miles of the boundary of an active incorporated municipality;\r\n(3) that an approved service feasibility study for the proposed municipality \r\n  has been filed with and approved by the Secretary of State;Â  and\r\n(4) that the area proposed to be incorporated is contiguous. Contiguity \r\n  is not destroyed by an intervening marshland located in the tidal flow or an \r\n  intervening publicly-owned waterway, whether or not the marshland located in \r\n  the tidal flow or the publicly-owned waterway has been previously incorporated \r\n  or annexed by another municipality. The incorporation of a marshland located \r\n  in the tidal flow or a publicly-owned waterway does not preclude the marshland \r\n  located in the tidal flow or the publicly-owned waterway from subsequently being \r\n  used by any other municipality to establish contiguity for purposes of an incorporation \r\n  if the distance from highland to highland of the area being incorporated is \r\n  not greater than three-fourths of a mile.\r\n(B) When an area seeking incorporation has petitioned pursuant \r\n  to Chapter 17 the nearest incorporated municipality to be annexed to the municipality, \r\n  and has been refused annexation by the municipality for six months, or when \r\n  the population of the area seeking incorporation exceeds fifteen thousand persons, \r\n  then the provision of the five-mile limitation of this section does not apply \r\n  to the area.\r\n&nbsp;(C) The five-mile limit does not apply when the boundaries of the \r\n  area seeking incorporation are within five miles of the boundaries of two different \r\n  incorporated municipalities in two separate counties other than the county within \r\n  which the area seeking incorporation lies, and when the boundaries of the proposed \r\n  municipality are more than five miles from the boundaries of the nearest incorporated \r\n  municipality that lies within the same county within which the proposed municipality \r\n  lies, and when the land area of the territory seeking incorporation exceeds \r\n  one-fourth of the land area of the nearest incorporated municipality.\r\n&nbsp;(D) The population requirements do not apply to \r\n  areas bordering on and being within two miles of the Atlantic Ocean and to all \r\n  sea islands bounded on at least one side by the Atlantic Ocean, both of which \r\n  have a minimum of one hundred fifty dwelling units and at least an average of \r\n  one dwelling unit for each three acres of land within the area and for which \r\n  petitions for incorporation contain the signatures of at least fifteen percent \r\n  of the qualified electors of the respective areas seeking incorporation.\r\n(E) This section does not apply to those areas which have petitioned \r\n  to the Secretary of State before June 25, 1975, or which may be under adjudication \r\n  in the courts of this State. The five-mile limit does not apply to counties \r\n  with a population according to the latest official United States Census of less \r\n  than fifty-one thousand.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nSubsection (A)(4) was enacted in response to lobbying by Town after our decision \r\n  in Glaze v. Grooms, 324 S.C. 249, 478 S.E.2d 841 (1996).Â  In Glaze, \r\n  we addressed a challenge to Townâ€™s 1992 attempt at incorporation.Â  The trial \r\n  court found Town lacked the necessary contiguity.Â  Town appealed claiming that \r\n  contiguity is not destroyed by marshlands and creeks and therefore the incorporated \r\n  highland areas of Town were contiguous.Â  We agreed that marshlands and creeks \r\n  do not destroy contiguity; however, these marshlands and creeks had previously \r\n  been annexed by other municipalities and therefore could not be used to establish \r\n  Townâ€™s contiguity.Â  324 S.C. at 253, 478 S.E.2d at 844.Â  \r\nAfter Glaze, the definition of contiguity in subsection (A)(4) was enacted \r\n  and Town again sought incorporation.Â  Because it is within five miles of City, \r\n  under Â§ 5-1-30(B) Town would have to request annexation by City before incorporating \r\n  unless the proposed town had a population of at least 15,000.Â  By establishing \r\n  contiguity using marshland and waterways that had already been annexed by City, \r\n  Town was able to amass a population of 15,000, allowing it to bypass a request \r\n  for annexation before incorporating.Â  \r\nAfter the Secretary of State issued Town a certificate of incorporation, City \r\n  brought this action challenging subsection (A)(4) as unconstitutional special \r\n  legislation claiming James Island is the only geographic area in the State that \r\n  needs the contiguity provision of subsection (A)(4) to amass a population of \r\n  15,000.Â  The trial court found subsection (A)(4) â€œcreates a classification among \r\n  municipalities that is arbitraryâ€ and concluded it is unconstitutional special \r\n  legislation.Â  The trial court enjoined Townâ€™s exercise of municipal functions.Â  \r\n\r\nTown appeals.Â  The Attorney General has submitted \r\n  an amicus brief in support of finding the legislation constitutional.Â  The trial \r\n  courtâ€™s injunction has been stayed pending appeal.\r\nISSUE\r\nIs Â§ 5-1-30(A)(4) unconstitutional special \r\n  legislation?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOur State Constitution specifically forbids the enactment \r\n  of special legislation regarding the incorporation of municipalities.Â  Article \r\n  III, Â§ 34, provides:\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of this State shall not enact local or special laws concerning \r\n  any of the following subjects or for any of the following purposes, to wit:\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  II.Â  To incorporate cities, towns or villages. . . .\r\n\r\nArticle VIII, Â§ 8, similarly provides:Â  â€œThe General Assembly shall provide \r\n  by general law the criteria and the procedures for the incorporation of new \r\n  municipalities . . . . No local or special laws shall be enacted for these purposes.â€Â  \r\n  Article VIII, Â§ 10, further provides:Â  â€œNo laws for a specific municipality \r\n  shall be enacted, and no municipality shall be exempted from the laws applicable \r\n  to municipalities. . . .â€\r\nA law is general when it applies uniformly to all persons or things within \r\n  a proper class, and special when it applies to only one or more individuals \r\n  or things belonging to that same class.Â  McKiever v. City of Sumter, \r\n  137 S.C. 266, 135 S.E. 60 (1926).Â  A law that is general in form but special \r\n  in its operation violates the constitutional prohibition against special legislation.Â  \r\n  Thomas v. Macklen, 186 S.C. 290, 195 S.E. 539 (1938).Â  The fact that \r\n  a law operates to affect only one person or one locale, however, does not necessarily \r\n  make it special legislation.Â  Kalk v. Thornton, 269 S.C. 521, 238 S.E.2d \r\n  210 (1977); Timmons v. South Carolina Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. \r\n  378, 175 S.E.2d 805 (1970).  [1] Â  \r\nIf the legislation does not apply uniformly, the essential inquiry is whether \r\n  the legislation creates an unlawful classification.Â Â  McKiever, supra.Â  \r\n  The mere fact that a statute creates a classification does not make it special \r\n  legislation.Â  Elliott v. Sligh, 233 S.C. 161, 103 S.E.2d 923 (1958); \r\n  Duke Power Co. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 284 S.C. 81, 326 \r\n  S.E.2d 395 (1985).Â  The constitutional prohibition against special legislation \r\n  operates similarly to our equal protection guarantee in that itÂ  prohibits an \r\n  unreasonable classification.Â  Thompson v. South Carolina Commâ€™n on Alcohol \r\n  and Drug Abuse, 267 S.C. 463,Â  229 S.E.2d 781 (1976); see also Duke \r\n  Power Co., supra.Â  A classification is arbitrary, and therefore unconstitutional, \r\n  if there is no reasonable hypothesis to support it.Â  Elliott v. Sligh, \r\n  supra.Â  \r\nOn the other hand, the legislature may use a classification â€œif some intrinsic \r\n  reason exists why the law should operate upon some and not upon all, or should \r\n  affect some differently from others.â€Â  Id. at 165, 103 S.E.2d at 926.Â  \r\n  Where a special law will best meet the exigencies of a particular situation, \r\n  it is not unconstitutional.Â  Med. Soc. of South Carolina v. Med. Univ. of \r\n  South Carolina, 334 S.C. 270, 513 S.E.2d 352 (1999).Â  We will not overrule \r\n  the legislatureâ€™s judgment that a special law is necessary unless there has \r\n  been a clear and palpable abuse of legislative discretion.Â  Id.\r\n1.Â  What classification \r\n  is created by subsection (A)(4)?\r\nThe parties stipulated that without the contiguity provision of (A)(4)Â  allowing \r\n  Town to use marshes and waterways previously annexed by City, Town could not \r\n  reach the 15,000 population threshold.Â  City and Town each presented expert \r\n  testimony regarding the potential application of subsection (A)(4) in different \r\n  geographic areas of the State.Â  The main thrust of Cityâ€™s evidence was that \r\n  James Island was the only geographic area that needed subsection (A)(4) \r\n  to reach the 15,000 population threshold. \r\nTown, on the other hand, presented evidence that at least three other unincorporated \r\n  areas - outside Conway, Greer, and Summerville - could use subsection (A)(4) \r\n  to create contiguity.Â  Townâ€™s expert testified that Cityâ€™s evidence failed to \r\n  take into account the fact that municipal incorporation depended not strictly \r\n  upon geography but also upon â€œpolitical willâ€ which could influence whether \r\n  the 15,000 population threshold would be needed for a politically desired configuration.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court found subsection (A)(4) created a \r\n  class consisting only of James Island because only James Island needed to use \r\n  it to meet the 15,000 population threshold.Â  We disagree.Â  The application of \r\n  subsection (A)(4) is not limited to unincorporated areas that need to reach \r\n  the 15,000 population threshold.Â  Subsection (A)(4) applies to any unincorporated \r\n  area that is geographically configured so that it may establish contiguity using \r\n  previously annexed marshland and waterways, regardless of whether the 15,000 \r\n  population threshold is a factor in the incorporation.Â  \r\nThe evidence is undisputed that at least three other unincorporated areas in \r\n  the State are so configured and could use subsection (A)(4) to establish contiguity \r\n  for incorporation.Â  Accordingly, the class created by subsection (A)(4) is not \r\n  limited to James Island.\r\n2.Â  Is the classification \r\n  arbitrary?\r\nIn Thomas v. Macklen, supra, we considered a law concerning the \r\n  selection of town council members that was applicable only to â€œresort communities.â€Â  \r\n  First, we noted that the definition of â€œresort communitiesâ€ in the Act was in \r\n  practical effect limited to Myrtle Beach.Â  This fact alone, however, was not \r\n  determinative.Â  We went on to consider whether there was any reasonable hypothesis \r\n  to support a class of â€œresort communities:â€\r\n\r\nWe are unable to perceive any rational difference of situation or condition \r\n  to be found in what is called a â€œresort communityâ€ from that of any municipal \r\n  corporation organized under the general law in relation to the selection of \r\n  its town council. . . . [T]he practical effect of the operation of the law will \r\n  introduce radical diversity into the governmental structure of our municipal \r\n  corporations.\r\n\r\n195 S.E. at 545. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nHere, in finding an arbitrary classification, the trial \r\n  court focused on the fact that only tidal marshes and waterways, and not freshwater \r\n  marshes, parks, or highways, could be used to create contiguity under subsection \r\n  (A)(4).Â  The broader question, however, is whether there is any rational basis \r\n  to allow particularly defined geographic areas to incorporate using territory \r\n  that lies within anotherâ€™s borders.Â  \r\nWe find the classification arbitrary because there \r\n  is no rational reason to allow only certain geographic areas to use territory \r\n  belonging to a neighboring municipality to enable incorporation.Â  Subsection \r\n  (A)(4) creates an unconstitutional diversity in municipal incorporation laws, \r\n  which are constitutionally required to be uniform, by allowing only certain \r\n  areas to incorporate using territory belonging to another municipality.Â  We \r\n  hold this provision is unconstitutional special legislation.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, J., Acting Justices Marc H. Westbrook and Roger L. Couch, concur.Â  \r\n  TOAL, C.J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal, concurring:\r\nI concur with the majorityâ€™s result in every respect. I write separately only\r\nto note that this opinion is consistent with my dissent in Ed Robinson\r\nLaundry and Dry Cleaning, Inc. v. South Carolina Dept. of Revenue, 356 S.C.\r\n120, 588 S.E.2d 97 (2003). In my dissent, I explained that, in my view, the 61\r\nsales tax exemptions found in S.C. Code Ann. section 12-46-2120 (Supp. 2002)\r\nrendered the statute unconstitutional because there was no rational basis for\r\nthe classifications, which treated similarly situated entities differently for\r\nsales tax purposes.\r\nLikewise, in reaching its conclusion today\r\nthat the classification created by section 5-1-30(A)(4) (Supp. 2003) is\r\narbitrary and therefore unconstitutional, the majority explains that there is no\r\nrational basis for allowing only certain geographic areas to use territory\r\nbelonging to a neighboring municipality for the purposes of incorporation.\r\nIn sum, I believe that both opinions\r\ncorrectly analyze the constitutionality of the statutes in question.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Further, \r\n    the fact that a law was enacted as a result of lobbying does not transform \r\n    it into special legislation.Â  Kalk, 269 S.C. at 526, 238 S.E.2d at \r\n    213. Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Similarly, \r\n    we have found legislation based on population limits unconstitutional where \r\n    there is no rational basis for treating government entities differently based \r\n    on population numbers.Â  E.g., U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar.

Traylor, \r\n  Op. No. 2003-UP-036 (Ct. App. filed Jan. 14, 2003).Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTSÂ Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  In the early morning hours of May 17, 2000, the York County home of Marcos \r\n  Rivera, Alfredo Garcia, and Javier Cervantes was burglarized.Â  The men awoke \r\n  and found themselves being beaten, stabbed and robbed.Â  After the attack, Detective \r\n  Sarah Robbins of the York County Police Department was called to the scene. \r\n  [1] Â  Two of the men, Alfredo and Javier, described their attackers as three \r\n  black males and one white male.Â  Marcos remembered seeing only two black males \r\n  and one white male.Â  Javier recognized one of the black male assailants, ultimately \r\n  determined to be Willie Hayes, as living in a nearby home.Â  Hayes was arrested \r\n  and identified Luke Traylor as one of his accomplices. [2] Â Â Â  \r\nRobbins testified that each of the victims identified the white male assailant \r\n  as being tall and slim and wearing a cap.Â  One of the victims believed the white \r\n  male was sixteen or seventeen years old.Â  None of the victims gave any specific \r\n  description as to the white maleâ€™s hair or eye color. \r\n  [3] Â  \r\nTwo days later, Javier, Marcos and Alfredo went to Robbinsâ€™ office at the police \r\n  department.Â  Robbins put together three separate groups of photographs, each \r\n  containing 5-6 photos of different individuals; each set contained one photo \r\n  of an individual identified by Hayes.Â  The photos of Traylor (as well as the \r\n  other accomplices), were all photos which had been processed after their arrest \r\n  for this crime.Â  Unlike the photos of the other four individuals in the group \r\n  containing Traylorâ€™s photo, his photo does not have a sign beneath it showing \r\n  an arrest date, and stating â€œPolice Department- York, South Carolina.â€ [4] Â  Additionally, all of the photos \r\n  shown to the victims have numerical markings on the side, indicating a height \r\n  in inches. [5] \r\nRobbins testified that during the photographic line-up, the victims sat behind \r\n  her desk in a semi-circle, several feet apart.Â  She testified each victim was \r\n  separately handed a group of pictures, and asked whether he could identify an \r\n  assailant.Â  Each victim would then hand the group of photos back to her, and \r\n  indicate which person, if any, he recognized.Â  During this time, there was no \r\n  conversation between the victims as to who had been identified.Â  \r\nEach of the photographs shown to the victims had a name on the back; however, \r\n  Robbins stated the victims did not turn the photos over and look at the back \r\n  of them.Â  Further, although the victims had been told someone had been arrested, \r\n  there is no indication they were aware of the identity or number of individuals \r\n  arrested.\r\nMarcos Rivera testified that he, Alfredo, and Javier were all sleeping in the \r\n  same bedroom when he woke up and realized he had been cut on the side of his \r\n  head.Â  He saw a white male and two black males.Â  The black male beside him had \r\n  a knife.Â  Marcos was holding the hand of the black male (who had stabbed him) \r\n  when the white male, who was wearing a cap, came over and hit his hand with \r\n  a stick.Â  The black male then cut him again.Â  Marcos said the white male was \r\n  in the bedroom for a total of twenty to thirty minutes, and that he was able \r\n  to see the white male for approximately ten minutes. [6] Â  Marcos testified that the man who had cut him with a knife \r\n  was the taller, black male, while the shorter black male had an afro-type hairdo.Â  \r\n  After leaving the hospital several hours later, Marcos went to the police station \r\n  where he identified a photograph of the man with the afro hairdo. \r\n  [7] Â  Two days later, he went to Robbinsâ€™ office and was shown three sets \r\n  of photos; the only photo he could identify (other than the photo of Hayes whom \r\n  he had previously identified) was that of the white male, Traylor.Â  Marcos testified \r\n  he did not notice any writing at the bottom of the photos, and he did not say \r\n  anything to Javier or Alfredo about what he had seen in the pictures.Â  \r\nAlfredo testified that when he woke up, the lights were on and he was being \r\n  beaten with a stick by a white male who was wearing a cap.Â  He was able to see \r\n  him for about a minute.Â  He testified he initially also saw two black males.Â  \r\n  He later saw a third black male with a white shirt.Â  After the assault, Alfredo \r\n  was able to identify a photo of a black male with an afro-style hairdo and a \r\n  black shirt.Â  Two days later, Alfredo went to Robbinsâ€™ office and picked a photo \r\n  of Traylor as the white male assailant. \r\n  [8] Â  He testified he knew the young blond man in the photo was the assailant \r\n  â€œbecause of his face, his thin face and body.Â  And even though that night he \r\n  wore a cap, I was able to recognize him.â€Â  Alfredo testified that, during the \r\n  line-up in Robbinsâ€™ office, Marcos viewed the photos first, then Alfredo, then \r\n  Javier; he testified he did not know whom Marcos had identified at the time \r\n  he viewed the photos.Â  \r\nJavier testified he was sleeping on the sofa when he woke up and saw three \r\n  men in the room: two black males and one white male.Â  The lights were on and \r\n  the white male, who was standing near him, had a cap on, a stick in his hand, \r\n  and was hitting them with the stick.Â  Javier was able to look at him for about \r\n  five minutes.Â  Although the white male was in the room for twenty or thirty \r\n  minutes, he didnâ€™t see him the whole time as the man covered him with a bed \r\n  cover.Â  Javier recognized one of the black males, with an afro-style hairdo, \r\n  as a man he had seen before.Â  Javier then saw a third black male at the door \r\n  with a white t-shirt.Â  After the assault, Javier went with Robbins to show her \r\n  the home where he had seen the black male with the afro hairdo.Â  Two days later, \r\n  he went with Marcos and Alfredo to Robbinsâ€™ office, where they looked at the \r\n  photographic line-up prepared by Robbins.Â  Javier testified the photos were \r\n  first viewed by Marcos, then Alfredo, then himself.Â  He testified he did not \r\n  know, when he received the photos, whose pictures Marcos and Alfredo had picked \r\n  from the line-up.Â  Javier also identified the photo of Traylor as the white \r\n  male assailant. [9] Â  Javier did not notice any writing \r\n  on the bottom of the photos when he viewed them.\r\nTraylor moved to suppress the victimsâ€™ identification on the basis that the \r\n  pre-trial photo identification was tainted.Â  Specifically, he alleged 1) the \r\n  fact that the three victims were sitting together in Robbinsâ€™ office when they \r\n  made the identification had the â€œpotential of taintingâ€ the lineup, 2) the name \r\n  of each defendant was visible on the back of the photographs, 3) Traylorâ€™s photograph \r\n  was different than the other white males in his group because it did not have \r\n  a date on the bottom, nor did it state â€œPolice Department-York County,â€ and \r\n  4) the fact that the photographs reflect the height of the individuals is impermissibly \r\n  suggestive.Â  The state conceded that, ideally, the victims should have been \r\n  shown the lineups separately, but nonetheless maintained the procedure used \r\n  was not impermissibly suggestive, and the identification was reliable.Â  The \r\n  trial court, after reviewing the totality of the circumstances, denied the motion \r\n  to suppress.Â  \r\nThereafter, the trial judge inquired \r\n  as to how the state intended to handle the issue before the jury, due to the \r\n  fact that the photo of Traylor was clearly a mug shot, revealed by the front \r\n  and side poses, and the height indicators.Â  The court ruled the only way the \r\n  state would be permitted to introduce the photos before the jury was to redact \r\n  them, so that the height lines would no longer be visible.Â  However, counsel \r\n  for Traylor interjected that if the photographs were redacted, then the jury \r\n  would be shown photographs which were different than those shown to the victims; \r\n  accordingly, counsel maintained that the cleaned up photos would actually prejudice \r\n  Traylor more than the unredacted photos, such that the photos should not come \r\n  into evidence at all.Â  He then asserted that, if the photos used in the lineup \r\n  were to be admitted at all, he would prefer the originals to the redacted version.Â  \r\n  After being given an opportunity to confer with Traylor, counsel concluded it \r\n  was less prejudicial for the unredacted photos to be admitted than the redacted \r\n  ones.Â  Accordingly, the trial court admitted the unredacted mug shot photos \r\n  before the jury.\r\nÂ On appeal, Traylor argued the \r\n  photographic lineup was unduly suggestive and unreliable, and that the photos \r\n  should not have been admitted.Â  The Court of Appeals held the photographic lineup \r\n  procedure used in this case was unduly suggestive, and the resulting identification \r\n  was unreliable.Â  Accordingly, it reversed and remanded.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in holding the photographs lineup \r\n  procedure used in this case was unduly suggestive and unreliable?Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n         2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in ruling the photos used in the lineup \r\n  were admissible?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n &nbsp;\r\n 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHOTOGRAPHIC LINEUP PROCEDURE   \r\nA criminal defendant may be deprived of due process of law by an identification \r\n  procedure which is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken \r\n  identification.Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 540 S.E.2d 445 (2000).Â  \r\n  An in-court identification of an accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court \r\n  identification procedure created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable \r\n  misidentification.Â  Id.Â  The United States Supreme Court has developed \r\n  a two-prong inquiry to determine the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.Â  \r\n  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972).Â  First, a court must ascertain \r\n  whether the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  The court must next \r\n  decide whether the out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable \r\n  that no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed.Â  Moore, \r\n  343 S.C. at 288, 540 S.E.2d at 448.Â  â€œThe central question is whether under \r\n  the totality of the circumstances the identification was reliable even though \r\n  the confrontation procedure was suggestive.â€Â  State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. \r\n  447, 450, 272 S.E.2d 628, 629 (1980).Â  \r\nWe find the line-up procedure utilized in this case was patently suggestive.Â  \r\n  To bring three victims into the same room, within several feet of one another, \r\n  is blatantly unacceptable.Â  There is simply no need for such a procedure, and \r\n  we strongly admonish the state against utilization of simultaneous viewings \r\n  in the future.Â  However, notwithstanding the suggestiveness of the line-up in \r\n  this case, we simply cannot conclude it gave rise to a substantial likelihood \r\n  of irreparable misidentification.Â  \r\nEven assuming an identification procedure is suggestive, it need not be excluded \r\n  so long as, under all the circumstances, the identification was reliable notwithstanding \r\n  the suggestiveness.Â  The inquiry must focus upon whether, under the totality \r\n  of the circumstances, there was a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.Â  \r\n  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 447-48, citing \r\n  Jefferson v. State, 206 Ga.App. 544, 425 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1992).Â  The \r\n  following factors should be considered in evaluating the totality of the circumstances \r\n  to determine the likelihood of a misidentification:Â  (1) the witness's opportunity \r\n  to view the perpetrator at the time of the crime, (2) the witness's degree of \r\n  attention, (3) the accuracy of the witness's prior description of the perpetrator, \r\n  (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, \r\n  and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.Â  State \r\n  v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 541, 552 S.E.2d 300, 308 (2001), cert. denied \r\n  535 U.S. 933 (2002).Â  \r\nÂ  As noted previously, Robbins testified the victims were seated several feet \r\n  apart from one another, and she individually handed them sets of 4-5 photos, \r\n  which each would look at and hand back to her.Â  There was no conversation between \r\n  them while they were observing the photos, and they did not turn the photos \r\n  over and look at the names on the back.Â  Further, each of the victims testified \r\n  as to the procedure utilized.Â  Marcos testified that he did not notice any writing \r\n  on the front of the photos, [10]  and that he did not say anything \r\n  to Alfredo or Javier as to what he saw in the photos.Â  Alfredo testified that \r\n  in looking at the photos in Robbinsâ€™ office, Marcos looked at them first, then \r\n  he did, then Javier did; he did not know who Marcos had picked out of the pictures \r\n  when he looked at the photos.Â  Alfredo picked out the photos of Traylor, Hayes, \r\n  and one of the other black males.Â  Javier testified he did not know, when he \r\n  received the photos, whose pictures Marcos and Alfredo had picked out.Â  Javier \r\n  also identified the photo of Traylor as the white male assailant, as well as \r\n  a photo of Hayes as the assailant who had cut Marcus.Â  Javier did not notice \r\n  any writing on the bottom of the photos.Â  \r\nThe victims testified they were able to view the white male assailant anywhere \r\n  from one minute (Alfredo), five minutes (Javier), and ten minutes (Marcos), \r\n  with the lights on.Â  Although they did not give a hair or eye color (the assailant \r\n  had a cap on), they told Robbins he was tall, slim, and young.Â  Further, although \r\n  they did not specifically describe his clothing (other than the cap), they testified \r\n  before the jury that they had all seen his face.Â  Clearly, this testimony demonstrates \r\n  their attention was focused on his face.Â  The next factor is the accuracy of \r\n  their description.Â  The victims all described the white male as being tall and \r\n  slim, which is an accurate description of Traylor.Â  Further, although Traylor \r\n  has a fairly distinctive looking face due to the fact that it is quite long \r\n  and slim, there is no specific distinguishing feature such as moles, mustache, \r\n  bushy brows, deep-set eyes, or the like.Â  The fourth factor is the witnessesâ€™ \r\n  level of certainty; all three victims were quite certain of their identification \r\n  in this case.Â  And, finally, the identification of Traylor was made two days \r\n  after the incident, clearly weighing in favor of its reliability. Â \r\nIn sum, although we cannot condone the manner in which the photographic line-up \r\n  in this case was performed, there is simply not a substantial likelihood of \r\n  irreparable misidentification, such that the trial court properly allowed the \r\n  identification. [11] Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding on this issue \r\n  is reversed.\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ADMISSIBILITY OF LINE-UP PHOTOS  \r\nTraylor also asserts the trial court committed reversible error in admitting \r\n  the mug shots into evidence.Â  \r\nThe introduction of a &quot;mug-shot&quot; of a defendant is reversible error \r\n  unless: (1) the state has a demonstrable need to introduce the photograph, (2) \r\n  the photograph shown to the jury does not suggest the defendant has a criminal \r\n  record, and (3) the photograph is not introduced in such a way as to draw attention \r\n  to its origin or implication.Â  State v. Tate, 288 S.C. 104, 341 S.E.2d \r\n  380 (1986); State v. Robinson, 274 S.C. 198, 262 S.E.2d 729 (1980); State \r\n  v. Denson, 269 S.C. 407, 237 S.E.2d 761 (1977).\r\nWe find no demonstrable need to introduce the photo lineup in this case.Â  The \r\n  Stateâ€™s assertion that it could not credibly show Traylor was in the house without \r\n  the photo line-ups is untenable.Â  Detective Robbins testified that Javier identified \r\n  a man named Willie Hayes, whom he had seen before in the neighborhood, as one \r\n  of the assailants.Â  Hayes was arrested and identified Traylor as one of his \r\n  accomplices.Â  Hayes was called as a witness for the State, and testified Traylor \r\n  was at the scene of the crime.Â  Each of the victims testified at trial, and \r\n  described the attack, as well as the assailants.Â  The State could very easily \r\n  have questioned the victims as to their observations of the white male assailant \r\n  at the time of the crime, his tall thin frame and thin face, in order to support \r\n  their in-court identifications without resort to the photo line-up.Â Â  Accordingly, \r\n  admission of the mug shots was error. \r\nHowever, Detective Robbins testified before the jury that the photograph of \r\n  Traylor which she showed to the victims during the line-up was taken upon his \r\n  arrest.Â  Further, counsel for Traylor specifically cross-examined Robbins regarding \r\n  the fact that Traylorâ€™s photo did not have a date on the bottom because it had \r\n  been taken shortly after his arrest on these charges.Â  Accordingly, although \r\n  we strongly admonish the state against utilization of such photos except in \r\n  the rarest of cases, we find no prejudice to Traylor as a result of the photographs \r\n  in this case, such that his convictions are affirmed. [12] Â  State v. Locklair, \r\n  341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000), cert. denied 531 U.S. 1093 (2001) \r\n  (error without prejudice does not warrant reversal).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe strongly admonish the state against the use of simultaneous line-up procedures; \r\n  victims should be individually shown a line-up, and individual identifications \r\n  made.Â  Further, we fervently caution trial court judges against utilization \r\n  of mug shot photos unless absolutely necessary.Â  Under the precise facts of \r\n  this case, however, we find the suggestive procedure did not irreparably taint \r\n  the victimsâ€™ identifications, and admission of the mug shot photo was not prejudicial \r\n  to Traylor.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is reversed. \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Aphrodite K. Konduros, \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Robbins was called because the men spoke only \r\n    Spanish, a language in which she is fluent.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  Hayes also identified two other accomplices.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  Robbins testified victims did not specifically \r\n    tell her a height of the white male, but that they somehow indicated an approximate \r\n    height, and she wrote down 5â€™6â€- 5â€8.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  According to Robbins, the sign attached to the \r\n    camera pole had been broken and had been removed.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Â  Traylorâ€™s photo shows him to be approximately \r\n    70.5 inches tall, or about 5â€™10&amp;1/2.â€Â  Robbins testified that the victims \r\n    indicated the white male was approximately 5â€™6â€-5â€™8.â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] Â  After this point, the assailants told the victims \r\n    to cover their heads.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] Â  This was a photo of Willie Hayes, who initially \r\n    implicated Traylor.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8] Â  He also picked out a photo of the black male \r\n    who had cut Marcos with a knife, and another black male.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [9] \r\n    Â  He also identified a photo of the black male who cut Marcus.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [10] Â  As mentioned previously, none of the victims \r\n    spoke English.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [11] Â Â  Accord State v. Anderson, 517 \r\n    So.2d 1231 (La.App. 1987) (although photographic identification by two victims \r\n    simultaneously was highly suggestive, it did not taint subsequent physical \r\n    identification); Commonwealth v. Moynahan, 381 N.E.2d 575 (Mass. 1978) \r\n    (although it would have been preferable for victims to make their photographic \r\n    selections independently, simultaneous viewing and selection did not require \r\n    suppression of identification in light of favorable conditions under which \r\n    robbers were viewed and the short amount of time that elapsed between robbery \r\n    and photographic identification). \r\n\r\n \r\n   [12] Â Â  Although we have held admission of a mug-shot \r\n    to be reversible error if the three criteria of State v. Denson, 269 \r\n    S.C. 407, 237 S.E.2d 761 (1977) are not met, the rationale for this holding \r\n    is that such photos are prejudicial because they imply a defendantâ€™s prior \r\n    bad acts.Â Â  Here, however, the photograph was explained in such a manner that \r\n    it did not imply Traylor had committed prior bad acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25848","title":"In the Matter of McFarland","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25848","description":"This opinion publicly reprimands respondent.","date":"2004-07-26","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Arthur Cecil McFarland, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25848\r\nHeard May 26, 2004 - Filed July 26, 2004\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Assistant \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nComing B. Gibbs, Jr., of Gibbs and Holmes, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this attorney discipline matter, \r\n  Arthur Cecil McFarland (Respondent) has taken exception to the recommendation \r\n  from the subpanel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (subpanel) \r\n  [1]  that he be definitely suspended from the practice of law for a period \r\n  of nine months, with conditions.Â  We find that Respondentâ€™s conduct warrants \r\n  a lesser sanction than the full panel recommended.Â  Therefore, we impose a public \r\n  reprimand, with the recommended conditions, effective as of the date of this \r\n  opinion.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis disciplinary matter \r\n  arises from Respondentâ€™s (1) neglect during the course of his representation \r\n  of Gussie Minus (Client), (2) failure to abide by court orders, and (3) failure \r\n  to cooperate with disciplinary counsel during the investigation.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Minus Matter\r\nIn September 2000, Client hired Respondent to represent \r\n  him in a Title VII suit against Clientâ€™s former employer (Defendant).Â  Respondent \r\n  filed a complaint on behalf of Client but never had it verified.Â  After some \r\n  investigation, Respondent concluded that Clientâ€™s claims lacked merit but never \r\n  told Client and never sought to dismiss the lawsuit.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter Respondent failed to timely respond to Defendantâ€™s multiple discovery \r\n  requests, Defendant filed a motion to compel.Â  The trial court ordered Respondent \r\n  to comply with the discovery requests, but he did not comply.Â  The trial court \r\n  issued two additional orders directing Respondent to comply with Defendantâ€™s \r\n  discovery requests.Â  Respondent again failed to respond until Defendant filed \r\n  a motion for costs and fees. [2] Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDefendant filed a motion \r\n  for summary judgment and Respondent did not respond.Â  Respondent told Client \r\n  about the motion for summary judgment, but he did not tell Client that he had \r\n  decided not to respond to it.Â  The Magistrate issued a Report and Recommendation \r\n  for summary judgment, citing as grounds Respondentâ€™s failure to file a verified \r\n  complaint, failure to comply with discovery, and failure to respond to the motion \r\n  for summary judgment.Â  Respondent did not respond to the report, and summary \r\n  judgment was granted.Â  Despite Respondentâ€™s nine meetings with Client after \r\n  summary judgment was granted, Respondent never told Client that Clientâ€™s case \r\n  had been dismissed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter some time, Client sent a certified letter to Respondent, \r\n  requesting a copy of his file and enclosing a check for $100.00 for copying \r\n  and shipping costs.Â  Respondent ignored Clientâ€™s request.Â  When Client finally \r\n  confronted Respondent in Respondentâ€™s office, Respondent gave him a copy of \r\n  the file; however, the copy did not include the summary judgment order.Â  Client \r\n  finally learned that his case had been dismissed upon obtaining a copy of the \r\n  file from the clerk of court.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCooperation \r\n  with Disciplinary Counselâ€™s Investigation\r\nTwice in May 2002, disciplinary counsel wrote Respondent \r\n  to notify him of Clientâ€™s grievance, yet Respondent failed to respond.Â Â  In \r\n  July 2002, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel sent Respondent a Notice of Full \r\n  Investigation, which instructed Respondent to file a written response within \r\n  thirty days.Â  Again, Respondent failed to respond.Â  On August 21, 2002, a SLED \r\n  officer served Respondent with a Notice to Appear and Subpoena pursuant to Rule \r\n  19, Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, \r\n  [3]  directing Respondent to appear in the Office of Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  on September 4, 2002.Â  Respondent failed to appear but contacted Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel, who agreed to postpone the meeting.Â  At the meeting, Respondent provided \r\n  disciplinary counsel with subpoenaed documents and a sworn statement.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Findings of the Commission\r\nThe full panel found that Respondent violated the following \r\n  South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, during the course \r\n  of his representation of Client:Â  Rule 1.1 (competence); Rule 1.2 (scope of \r\n  representation); Rule 1.3 (diligence); Rule 1.4 (communication); Rule 1.16 (declining \r\n  or terminating representation); Rule 2.1 (advisor); Rule 3.2 (expediting litigation); \r\n  Rule 3.4 (c) and (d) (fairness to opposing party and counsel); Rule 8.1 (cooperation \r\n  with disciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4 (e) (prejudice to the administration \r\n  of justice). \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThis Court is not bound by the subpanelâ€™s recommendation; \r\n  rather, after a thorough review of the record, this Court may impose the sanction \r\n  it deems appropriate.Â  In re Strickland, 354 S.C. 169, 172, 580 S.E.2d \r\n  126, 127 (2003).Â  The authority to discipline attorneys rests entirely with \r\n  this Court.Â  In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSanction\r\nIn response to the subpanelâ€™s recommendation, Respondent \r\n  argues that the appropriate sanction is a public reprimand -- the sanction given \r\n  by this Court in In the Matter of Charles, 347 S.C. 393, 556 S.E.2d 365 \r\n  (2001).Â  In that case, a real estate attorneyâ€™s failure to complete work for, \r\n  communicate with, and not earn fees paid by clients was found to violate the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  And although the respondent in that case had \r\n  been sanctioned on three prior occasions, this Court ordered a lesser sanction \r\n  because the respondentâ€™s client was not prejudiced by the respondentâ€™s neglect.Â  \r\n  This Court also has held â€œ[w]hen the offense of neglect is coupled with failure \r\n  to cooperate with the Bord [sic], public reprimands have been issued when the \r\n  client was not greatly prejudiced.â€Â  556 S.E.2d at 398 (citing Matter of \r\n  Acker, 308 S.C. 338, 341, 417 S.E.2d 862, 864 (1992)).Â  Although Respondentâ€™s \r\n  misconduct in the present case did not greatly prejudice Clientâ€™s case, Client \r\n  was, nevertheless, entitled to competent representation and candid consultation.Â  \r\n  We hold that the lack of prejudice to Clientâ€™s case mitigates, but does not \r\n  excuse, Respondentâ€™s misconduct.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondentâ€™s Experience \r\n  and Character\r\nWhen considering the appropriate sanction, the subpanel \r\n  took notice of Respondentâ€™s exceptional experience and exemplary contribution \r\n  to the Charleston community during his thirty years of practice.Â  But the subpanel \r\n  found that Respondentâ€™s experience and community involvement did not mitigate \r\n  his misconduct.Â Â  In fact, in making its determination as to the appropriate \r\n  sanction, the subpanel held Respondent to a higher standard. \r\nWhile Respondentâ€™s misconduct is less understandable given \r\n  his extensive experience, we do not find his experience to be a factor justifying \r\n  a harsher sanction.Â  Further, we disagree with the subpanelâ€™s conclusion that \r\n  Respondentâ€™s character and contributions to society warrant a harsher sanction.Â  \r\n  If anything, Respondentâ€™s character mitigates the circumstances of his misconduct.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondentâ€™s Mental Condition\r\nDr. Emmett Lampkin testified before the subpanel that Respondent \r\n  suffers from depressive dysthymic disorder, a condition that impairs Respondentâ€™s \r\n  cognitive abilities and his ability to perform normal tasks and carry out sophisticated \r\n  processes.Â  Dr. Lampkin further testified that Respondent could adequately practice \r\n  law given a combination of psychotherapy and medication.\r\nWe take notice that Respondent has independently sought \r\n  and continued treatment for the depressive disorder of which Dr. Lampkin testified \r\n  altered Respondentâ€™s judgment during the course of his representation of Client.Â  \r\n  We continue to encourage members of the bar such as Respondent to seek rehabilitation \r\n  for the well-being of themselves and the public they serve.\r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior Discipline\r\nThis grievance marks the fourth time Respondent \r\n  has been disciplined for professional misconduct.Â Â  In 1996, he received a private \r\n  reprimand [4]  for failing to \r\n  cooperate with disciplinary authorities.Â  \r\nIn 1997, though Respondent \r\n  was found to have not committed misconduct, he received a letter of caution, \r\n  which directed him to be mindful of Rule 8.1, SCRPC (bar admission and disciplinary \r\n  matters), Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nIn 2001, \r\n  Respondent received a confidential admonition concerning three different matters, \r\n  including violations of Rules 1.1 (competence), 1.2 (scope of representation), \r\n  1.3 (diligence), 1.4 (communication), 3.2 (expediting litigation), 8.1 (bar \r\n  admission and disciplinary matters), and 8.4 (misconduct) (a), (d), and (e) \r\n  concerning three different matters.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION&nbsp;\r\nWe find that Respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  \r\n  Additionally, we require Respondent to (1) hire an attorney to review Respondentâ€™s \r\n  management of his practice for a period of two years providing disciplinary \r\n  counsel with quarterly reports as to his ability to practice law in accordance \r\n  with the Rules of Professional Conduct; (2) continue his psychiatric treatments \r\n  for a period of two years, providing disciplinary counsel with quarterly reports \r\n  signed by the treating psychiatrist of his compliance with treatment; (3) refund \r\n  all fees paid to him by Client within thirty days of the publication of this \r\n  opinion; and (4) pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings within thirty \r\n  days of the publication ofÂ  this opinion.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, the record is unclear as to the total restitution owed to Client.Â  \r\n  Respondent shall effectuate within sixty days of the date of this opinion an \r\n  agreement with Disciplinary Counsel to implement a payment plan to ensure the \r\n  timely and prompt payment of restitution to Client.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Doyet \r\n  A. Early, III., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The full panel adopted the subpanelâ€™s report and recommendation in \r\n    its entirety.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The United States Magistrate rejected Respondentâ€™s arguments, holding \r\n    that the arguments were not timely and that Respondent had waived his objection \r\n    when he failed to voluntarily participate in the discovery process.Â  Respondent \r\n    was ordered to pay Defendantâ€™s costs and fees.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  This rule provides that Disciplinary Counsel must give a lawyer \r\n    20-days notice of a statement under oath.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  A private reprimand and a confidential admonition are identical sanctions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Ray D.
