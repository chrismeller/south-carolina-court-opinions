Â The\r\n  Hospital is located near Interstate 95, and its primary service area encompasses\r\n  Jasper and Beaufort Counties.\r\nAppellant is a\r\n  limited liability company owned and operated by Dr. Joseph Borelli, Jr., and it\r\n  is a free-standing, mobile MRI facility.Â  Appellant provides MRI services in\r\n  Bluffton, which is in Beaufort County, located approximately 13.8 miles from\r\n  CCMC.Â  Dr. Borelli is the sole physician who reads the MRI scans, and appellant\r\n  is open for business from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.Â  \r\nAfter CCMC filed\r\n  its application and DHEC began its review, appellant opposed the grant of a CON\r\n  to CCMC.Â  DHEC approved CCMCâ€™s CON application to provide MRI services to its\r\n  inpatients, outpatients, and emergency patients.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  appellant requested a contested case hearing before the ALC, naming DHEC and\r\n  CCMC as respondents.Â  Appellant argued that the purposes of the CON Act would\r\n  be best served by CCMC providing MRI services through a shared arrangement of\r\n  either mobile MRI services, an ownership sharing arrangement, or a transfer\r\n  agreement, none of which had to be with appellant.Â  CCMC contended that because\r\n  it was a hospital, it needed MRI accessibility twenty-four hours a day, seven\r\n  days a week.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to the ALC hearing, CCMC and appellant filed motions for summary judgment.Â \r\n  CCMC argued that because the Plan standards provided that hospitals, whenever\r\n  possible, should have at least one MRI unit available for the diagnosis of\r\n  inpatients, outpatients, and emergency patients, CCMC should be granted the CON\r\n  as a matter of law.Â  Appellantâ€™s motion for summary judgment was based on the\r\n  assertion that Plan standards for MRI services and equipment did not comply\r\n  with Â§ 44-7-180(B) and that the DHEC exceeded its statutory authority by\r\n  relying on the MRI Plan standards.Â  The ALC denied appellantâ€™s motion but granted\r\n  partial summary judgment to CCMC, ruling that the MRI standards under the Plan\r\n  did not require CCMC to establish compliance with project review criteria.[2] Â The case proceeded to trial to determine what constituted â€œavailableâ€ under\r\n  the MRI Plan standard.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing on\r\n  the merits, the ALC affirmed DHECâ€™s decision to grant the CON.Â  The ALC ruled\r\n  that for MRI services to be sufficiently available to CCMC, the Hospital would\r\n  need a fixed, in-house MRI unit that would be accessible twenty-four hours a\r\n  day, seven days a week.Â  Appellant appealed to the Board, and the Board\r\n  affirmed and incorporated the ALC decision in its order. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tI.&nbsp; Do\r\n  the MRI standards found in the Plan violate the CON Act, thereby causing the\r\n  Board to exceed its statutory authority in approving the CON awarded to CCMC?\r\n\tII.&nbsp; Is\r\n  the Boardâ€™s determination that an â€œavailableâ€ MRI for CCMC could only be\r\n  achieved by an onsite MRI facility arbitrary and capricious or otherwise\r\n  affected by an abuse of discretion?\r\n\tIII.&nbsp; Is\r\n  the finding that the Plan standards did not require CCMC to establish the\r\n  project review criteria violative of Â§ 44-7-210?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThis appeal is\r\n  governed by the Adminstrative Procedures Act (â€œAPAâ€), S.C. Code Ann Â§Â§\r\n  1-23-310, et seq. (Supp. 2005).Â  We may reverse or modify the Boardâ€™s\r\n  order if appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the\r\n  administrative decisions are: a) in violation of constitutional or statutory\r\n  provisions; b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; c) made upon\r\n  unlawful procedure; d) affected by other error of law; e) clearly erroneous in\r\n  view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;\r\n  or f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or\r\n  clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5).Â  As\r\n  to factual issues, judicial review of administrative agency orders is limited\r\n  to a determination whether the order is supported by substantial evidence.Â  Roper\r\n    Hosp. v. Bd. of S.C. DHEC, 306 S.C. 138, 140, 410 S.E.2d 558, 559 (1991).\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; State Health Plan \r\nAppellant\r\n  challenges the validity of the standards for MRI services set forth in the\r\n  Plan.Â  First, appellant argues that the CON award violates Â§ 44-7-180(B)(2) and\r\n  (3) because the Planâ€™s standards for MRI services do not contain projections of\r\n  need or standards of distribution.Â  We disagree.[3]\r\nSection 44-7-180(B)(2)\r\n  and (3) of the CON Act requires the State Health Plan, at a minimum, to\r\n  include:\r\n\r\n\t(2)\r\n  projections of need for additional health care facilities, beds, health\r\n  services, and equipment;\r\n\t(3)\r\n  standards for distribution of health care facilities, beds, specified health\r\n  services, and equipment including scope of services to be provided,\r\n  utilization, and occupancy rates, travel time, regionalization, other factors\r\n  relating to proper placement of services, and proper planning of health care\r\n  facilities; \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-7-180(B).Â  \r\nThe 2003 State\r\n  Health Plan sets forth three standards for MRI distribution:\r\n\r\n\t1)&nbsp; Each\r\n  hospital should have at least one MRI unit available for diagnosis of emergency\r\n  patients, inpatients and outpatients.\r\n\t2)&nbsp; In\r\n  order to promote cost-effectiveness, the use of shared mobile MRI units should\r\n  be considered.\r\n\t3)&nbsp; The\r\n  applicant agrees in writing to provide the Department utilization data on the\r\n  operation of the MRI service.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Plan\r\n  does not give specific projections of need or standards of distribution in\r\n  terms that track the exact statutory language, the Plan does not violate Â§\r\n  44-7-180.Â  Clearly, the first MRI standard that each hospital should\r\n  have at least one MRI unit available satisfies the statuteâ€™s directive for\r\n  projections of need when a hospital applies for a CON of an MRI.Â  The second\r\n  MRI standard also provides guidance for distribution and utilization of\r\n  existing MRI resources.Â  The Plan satisfies the requirements of Â§ 44-7-180(B)(2)\r\n  and (3) by unmistakably stating the need and guiding distribution for MRI units\r\n  in hospitals.Â  See Bursey v. S.C. DHEC, 369 S.C. 176, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  899(2006) (cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and\r\n  effectuate legislative intent).Â  Accordingly, the Plan is not violative of the\r\n  CON Act, and the Board did not exceed its statutory authority in granting the\r\n  CON in light of the Plan standards.[4]\r\nAppellant also\r\n  argues that the Boardâ€™s order should be reversed because there is no statutory\r\n  basis to treat hospitals differently from other health care facilities.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nEven though there\r\n  is no specific provision in the CON Act that authorizes hospitals to be treated\r\n  differently vis-Ã -vis standards of need for MRI services, the ability of the\r\n  Plan to differentiate between different types of medical providers is essential\r\n  to the CON process.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-150 (department may adopt\r\n  substantive and procedural regulations considered necessary by the department\r\n  and approved by the board to carry out the departmentâ€™s licensure and CON\r\n  duties).Â  Furthermore, appellantâ€™s contention that first Plan standard results\r\n  in hospitals being treated differently from other health care facilities is\r\n  misguided.Â  The first Plan standard only satisfies the showing of need for\r\n  hospitals, while other health care facilities will have to document need\r\n  separately.Â  Nothing in the CON Act prevents such a distinction.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-130 (containing separate definitions for â€œhospitalâ€ and\r\n  â€œhealth care facilityâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-150.\r\nII.&nbsp; Determination of\r\n  â€œAvailableâ€\r\nThe issue addressed\r\n  at trial was whether CCMC had access to an â€œavailableâ€ mobile MRI facility so\r\n  that a CON for an onsite MRI would not be warranted under the Plan standards.Â \r\n  Appellant argues that the finding of the Board that â€œavailable,â€ in the context\r\n  of MRI service for a hospital, meant an onsite MRI unit was arbitrary,\r\n  capricious, and clearly erroneous.Â  We disagree.\r\nCCMC presented\r\n  testimony from Dr. Tricia Etheridge, CCMCâ€™s chief of staff, concerning the\r\n  difficulties of transporting patients to an off-site MRI or other diagnostic\r\n  facilities.Â  In addition, Dr. Etheridge testified as to her concerns over the\r\n  adequacy of the technology found in mobile MRI units. Â Dr. Dean Mesh, a\r\n  radiologist at CCMC, also testified as to the necessity for an onsite MRI facility\r\n  to handle patients from the Hospitalâ€™s emergency room.Â  The president and CEO\r\n  of CCMC, Eric Deaton, also testified at length concerning the needs for around-the-clock\r\n  MRI availability, especially in light of CCMCâ€™s proximity to I-95.Â  Finally,\r\n  CCMC presented an expert witness, Mark Richardson, who testified that a MRI\r\n  facility open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, was in the best\r\n  interests of CCMCâ€™s patients.Â  Accordingly, substantial evidence exists to\r\n  support the finding that an â€œavailableâ€ MRI facility for CCMCâ€™s needs would\r\n  require an onsite MRI facility that was accessible twenty-four hours a day,\r\n  seven days a week.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Project Review\r\n  Criteria\r\nAppellantâ€™s\r\n  final argument claiming that the Board exceeded its statutory authority in granting\r\n  the CON involves S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-210.Â  Appellant argues the Boardâ€™s\r\n  finding that the Plan standards did not require CCMC to establish the project\r\n  review criteria[5] is violative of Â§ 44-7-210.Â  We agree.\r\n\r\n\tSection 44-7-210(C)\r\n  provides, in relevant part:\r\n\tThe\r\n  department may not issue a Certificate of Need [CON] unless an application\r\n  complies with the State Health Plan, Project Review Criteria, and other\r\n  regulations.Â  Based on project review criteria and other regulations, which\r\n  must be identified by the department, the department may refuse to issue a\r\n  Certificate of Need even if an application complies with the State Health Plan.\r\n\r\nSee\r\n  also 24A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 61-15 Â§\r\n  307.1 (Supp. 2005) (department may refuse to issue a CON even if an application\r\n  is in compliance with the State Health Plan but is inconsistent with project\r\n  review criteria or departmental regulations).\r\nThe Board\r\n  determined that the first Plan standard for MRI services stating every hospital\r\n  should have an available MRI unit meant that CCMC did not have to establish the\r\n  project review criteria.Â  This was error.Â  Section 44-7-210(C) and the\r\n  governing regulations are clear in establishing Plan standards and project\r\n  review criteria as separate and distinct requirements that must be met as part\r\n  of the CON application process.Â  Because the Board held that CCMC did not have\r\n  to prove compliance with the project review criteria by virtue of the first\r\n  Plan standard, appellant was prohibited from presenting its case to challenge\r\n  CCMCâ€™s compliance with the project review criteria.Â  Again, CCMCâ€™s compliance\r\n  with the project review criteria is an essential step in the CON process, and\r\n  this prerequisite is independent of compliance with the State Health Plan.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we remand this case to the ALC to determine whether CCMCâ€™s\r\n  application for a fixed, in-house MRI unit satisfies the project review\r\n  criteria identified in the Plan.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the\r\n  Plan standards for MRI services are not violative of Â§ 44-7-180.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the Boardâ€™s conclusion that CCMCâ€™s need for an â€œavailableâ€ MRI unit could only\r\n  be met by a fixed, onsite MRI is supported by substantial evidence.Â  However,\r\n  the Board erred by finding compliance with the project review criteria did not\r\n  have to be met in light of the Plan standards for MRI services.Â  We reverse the\r\n  CON award and remand for a determination on the sole issue whether CCMCâ€™s\r\n  application complies with the project review criteria set forth in the Plan.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The State Health Plan is required by the South\r\n  Carolina Certificate of Need and Health Facilities Licensure Act, S.C.

(2002) (â€œCON Actâ€).Â  The Plan contains\r\n  specific standards and information for health care facilities and health care\r\n  equipment, and it must be prepared and presented for approval to the Board at\r\n  least once every two years.Â  The 2003 State Health Plan governed CCMCâ€™s CON\r\n  application.\r\n[2] Section 44-7-180(B)(4) requires the State Health Plan\r\n  to include a general statement as to the project review criteria considered\r\n  most important in evaluating CON applications for each type of facility,\r\n  service, and equipment.Â  The four project review criteria identified in the\r\n  2003 Plan for MRI facilities were: (a) community need documentation; (b)\r\n  distribution (accessibility); (c) acceptability; and (d) cost containment.\r\n[3] Appellantâ€™s first argument is not specific to CCMCâ€™s\r\n  CON application.Â  Appellant essentially asserts that because the 2003 Plan\r\n  violated the CON Act, no CON for an MRI could have been lawfully awarded to any\r\n  applicant.\r\n[4] Appellant also claims that the Board should have made\r\n  factual findings regarding whether the MRI standards contained in the Plan\r\n  comply with Â§ 44-7-180(B)(2) and (3).Â  The issue whether the Plan standards\r\n  satisfy the statutory requirements is a legal conclusion based on statutory\r\n  interpretation principles.Â  Thus, no factual findings are necessary to\r\n  determine compliance with Â§ 44-7-180(B).Â  \r\n[5] The Plan ranks the relative importance of project\r\n  review criteria, as required by Â§ 44-7-180(4), for MRI service as: (a)\r\n  community need documentation; (b) distribution (accessibility); (c)\r\n  acceptability; and (d) cost containment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26518","title":"Ables v.

Howle, Jr., of Darlington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER: In 2005, petitioner Brendalee\r\n  Ables filed the instant action against her former husband, respondent Michael\r\n  Gladden, seeking reimbursement of medical expenses, health insurance premiums,\r\n  educational expenses, work-related child care expenses, and a retroactive\r\n  increase in child support.Â  The family court awarded petitioner $305.69 in\r\n  medical expenses, and a $300 reimbursement for a health insurance credit given\r\n  to respondent between 2003 and 2005 when he had not actually maintained\r\n  insurance coverage for the child.Â  However, the family court denied\r\n  petitionerâ€™s remaining requests primarily on the basis on untimeliness.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the family\r\n  court properly denied petitionerâ€™s claims based on laches.Â  Ables v. Gladden,\r\n  Op. No. 2006-UP-420 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 19, 2006).Â  This Court granted petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1992, petitioner\r\n  and respondent were divorced in Tokyo, Japan.Â  The Japanese divorce decree\r\n  awarded petitioner sole custody of the coupleâ€™s daughter, who was born on March\r\n  29, 1987.Â  Respondent was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $842\r\n  per month from June 1992 until August 1992; $667 per month from September 1992\r\n  until respondent separated from the military; and $378 per month thereafter.Â \r\n  By 1993, respondent and petitioner had both returned to the United States.Â  Respondent moved to North Carolina, and petitioner moved to South Carolina.Â \r\n  Petitioner enrolled the child in private school in South Carolina.[2]\r\nIn 1994, a North Carolina court issued an order[3] which provided that respondent pay $46 per week in child support and provide\r\n  health insurance coverage for the child when â€œavailable at a reasonable cost.â€Â \r\n  The order stated that health insurance â€œis defined to be reasonable in cost if\r\n  it is employment related or other group insurance.â€Â  In addition, the order\r\n  provided that if respondent failed to obtain health insurance coverage, he\r\n  would be liable for any medical expenses incurred.\r\nIn 1997, petitioner\r\n  sent a certified letter to respondent (who at that time lived in South Carolina) requesting payment for child support, out-of-pocket medical costs, daycare\r\n  expenses, and educational expenses.Â  Respondent signed for the letter but did\r\n  not respond.\r\nIn 1998, the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS), on behalf of petitioner, filed a\r\n  Notice of Registration of the Japanese Divorce Decree in the South Carolina\r\n  family court.Â Â  The family court, however, ruled the 1994 North Carolina Order\r\n  was the proper order to register in South Carolina.Â  The court ordered\r\n  respondent to pay the $46 per week, plus another $10 per week for arrears.Â  \r\nSeveral other orders\r\n  relating to the enforcement of child support were thereafter issued by the\r\n  family court, including orders which increased and decreased the amount of\r\n  support, set a weekly amount for arrearages, readjusted the method of payment\r\n  for medical expenses, and garnished respondentâ€™s wages. \r\nSpecifically\r\n  regarding medical expenses, the 2002 family court order stated the following:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[Petitioner] provides health insurance at\r\n  no cost.Â  [Petitioner] will be responsible for the first $250.00 of non-covered\r\n  medical expenses per calendar year.Â  Additional expenses in excess of $250.00\r\n  will be prorated [between petitioner and respondent:]Â  73% by [respondent,] 27%\r\n  by [petitioner].Â  [Petitioner] will provide proof of expenses within 10 days of\r\n  being incurred.Â  [Respondent] will have 30 days to pay the costs.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, respondent\r\n  filed a motion to terminate ongoing support based upon the child reaching the\r\n  age of majority.Â  At all times between 1998 and March 2005, petitioner had been\r\n  represented by attorneys from DSS.Â  At the March 30, 2005 hearing, petitioner\r\n  raised issues regarding reimbursement for medical expenses, daycare expenses,\r\n  and health insurance coverage.Â  In its April 8, 2005 order, the family court\r\n  found these issues were not properly raised because they were â€œnot within the\r\n  assignment or duties ofâ€ DSS.Â  Nevertheless, the family court â€œreservedâ€ the\r\n  resolution of those issues â€œfor a future hearing on her own,â€ i.e., in a\r\n  separate action brought by petitioner.Â  The family court terminated ongoing\r\n  child support as of March 29, 2005, because of the child turning 18, but\r\n  ordered respondent to continue paying the $6,812.31 in arrears at a weekly rate\r\n  of $101.79, until paid in full.&nbsp; \r\nIn June 2005,\r\n  petitioner filed the instant action against respondent which specifically\r\n  requested, inter alia:Â  (1) a retroactive increase in child support for\r\n  the period of time from 1998 until 2002 based on respondentâ€™s failure to report\r\n  increases in salary; (2) reimbursement for various medical expenses, health\r\n  insurance premiums, and work-related daycare expenses; and (3) increased child\r\n  support from 2003 through 2005 based on an improper credit given to respondent\r\n  for health care premiums.[4]\r\nA hearing was held\r\n  on October 18, 2005, at which petitioner claimed she was owed payments for\r\n  various un-reimbursed medical, daycare and educational expenses incurred during\r\n  the childâ€™s minority.Â  With the exception of one medical expense for a root\r\n  canal and an adjustment because of the health care credit improperly given to\r\n  respondent, the family court denied as untimely petitionerâ€™s various requests\r\n  for retroactive payments. \r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals\r\n  held that â€œthe record supports the family courtâ€™s decision that lachesâ€ barred\r\n  petitionerâ€™s claims.Â  Specifically, the Court of Appeals noted petitioner\r\n  â€œfailed to bring any formal adjudicatory proceeding against [respondent] until\r\n  2005, despite believing [respondent] was responsible for expenses and support\r\n  since 1994.â€Â  The Court of Appeals further found that petitionerâ€™s delay was\r\n  unreasonable, in part because petitioner and respondent were â€œinvolved in\r\n  multiple court proceedings between 1999 and 2005 regarding issues surrounding\r\n  [respondentâ€™s] child support payments.â€Â  Finally, the Court of Appeals found\r\n  respondent would be prejudiced by petitionerâ€™s request for the â€œlarge amountâ€\r\n  of $26,995.39.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.Â  In light of this Courtâ€™s opinion in Strickland\r\n  v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 650 S.E.2d 465 (2007), is laches no longer a\r\n  viable defense when there is court order for child support?Â  \r\n\t2.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in\r\n  finding petitionerâ€™s claims childcare and private school expenses were barred\r\n  by the doctrine of laches?\r\n\t3.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in not\r\n  awarding petitioner $660 for the improper credit given to respondent for health\r\n  insurance premiums?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this Court has jurisdiction to find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  E.g., Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â \r\n  This broad scope of review does not, however, require the appellate court to\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  \r\n1.Â  Strickland v. Strickland\r\nIn Strickland v. Strickland,\r\n  375 S.C. 76, 650 S.E.2d 465 (2007), we held that laches is not a defense to a\r\n  claim for the enforcement of an alimony award.Â  Petitioner argues that the\r\n  ruling in Strickland logically extends to the enforcement of a child\r\n  support order.Â  We agree.[5]\r\nLaches\r\n  is an equitable doctrine defined as â€œneglect for an unreasonable and\r\n  unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for\r\n  diligence, to do what in law should have been done.â€Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â  â€œWhether a claim is barred by\r\n  laches is to be determined in light of facts of each case, taking into\r\n  consideration whether the delay has worked injury, prejudice, or disadvantage to the other\r\n  party; delay alone in assertion of a right does not constitute laches.â€ Â Id. at 198-99, 371 S.E.2d at 527-28.\r\nIn Hallums,\r\n  this Court found that the doctrine of laches barred the motherâ€™s claim for\r\n  retroactive child support.Â  In that case, however, there had been no\r\n  adjudicated divorce and no court-ordered child support.Â  The mother first\r\n  raised the issue of child support as a counterclaim, some 22 years after the\r\n  father had first petitioned for a divorce, and at a time after the child had\r\n  reached the age of majority.Â  \r\nIn Strickland,\r\n  however, the Court had before it a case which involved a family court order\r\n  awarding alimony.Â  The Court adopted the reasoning ofÂ  Jefferson Pilot Life\r\n    Ins. Co. v. Gum, 302 S.C. 8, 393 S.E.2d 180 (1990), which found where a court order fixed an obligation,\r\n      the doctrine of laches could not be applied to undo the obligation.Â  Exporting\r\n  the Jefferson Pilot analysis to the alimony context, the Strickland  Court stated the following:\r\n\r\n\tIn our opinion, this Courtâ€™s reasoning in Jefferson\r\n  Pilot is equally applicable to a family court award of alimony.Â  Although the equitable nature of laches generally\r\n  comports with the family courtâ€™s equitable jurisdiction in determining support\r\n  and maintenance between former spouses, the concept of â€œinexcusable delayâ€ in\r\n  the laches defense is inconsistent with the\r\n  judicial authority inherent in a court order.Â  Because court orders awarding\r\n  support and maintenance do not have an expiration date,\r\n  allowing a party to avoid compliance based solely on the oblique notion of\r\n  delay only serves to undermine the authority of the court.Â  See also\r\n\tStephens\r\n    v. Hamrick, [358 S.E.2d 547, 549 (N.C. Ct. App. 1987)] (holding that the\r\n  doctrine of laches does not bar the enforcement of a court order for child\r\n  support because â€œthe obligation to furnish support is continuous [and\r\n  therefore] a lapse of time will not be a bar to commencement of an enforcement\r\n  action.â€).Â  Accordingly, we hold that laches is not a defense to a claim for\r\n  the enforcement of an alimony award.\r\n\r\nStrickland,&nbsp;375 S.C. at 83-84, 650 S.E.2d at 469-70.\r\nWe agree with\r\n  petitioner that the reasoning in Strickland and Jefferson Pilot should apply with equal force to cases involving a child support order.Â  In Strickland,\r\n  we cited a North Carolina case which involved a North Carolina mother trying to\r\n  enforce a South Carolina child support order.Â  See Stephens v.\r\n    Hamrick, supra.Â  The North Carolina Court of Appeals clearly held\r\n  that because the child support obligation is continuous, the doctrine of laches does not apply to bar enforcement of\r\n  a child support order.Â  Id.; see also South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Lowman,&nbsp;269 S.C. 41, 48, 236 S.E.2d 194,\r\n  196&nbsp;(1977) (the duty of child support is a continuing obligation).\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  doctrine of laches does not apply in the instant case to petitionerâ€™s claims\r\n  for retroactive child support, health\r\n  insurance premiums, and medical expenses.[6]\r\nAlthough\r\n  the Strickland Court disallowed laches in cases involving an alimony\r\n  order, it nevertheless held that equitable\r\n  estoppel could apply.Â  The Court explained that equitable estoppel â€œappropriately\r\n  balances principles of equity and judicial authority when the underlying facts\r\n  of a case call into question the equity of enforcing a court order.â€Â  Strickland,&nbsp;375\r\n  S.C. at 84, 650 S.E.2d at 470.Â  The Court outlined the various elements of the\r\n  estoppel claim as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  elements of equitable estoppel as related to the party being estopped are: (1)\r\n  conduct which amounts to a false representation, or conduct which is calculated\r\n  to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent\r\n  with, those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2) the intention\r\n  that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; and (3) actual or\r\n  constructive knowledge of the real facts. The party asserting estoppel must\r\n  show:Â  (1) lack of knowledge, and the means of knowledge, of the truth as to\r\n  the facts in question; (2) reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped; and (3) a\r\n  prejudicial change of position in reliance on the conduct of the party being\r\n  estopped.\r\n\r\nId. at 84-85, 650 S.E.2d at 470.\r\nPetitioner asserts\r\n  there is no evidence she should be equitably estopped from enforcing\r\n  respondentâ€™s court-ordered obligations regarding health insurance premiums,\r\n  medical expenses, and retroactive child support.Â  We agree.\r\nAs evidenced by the numerous orders\r\n  in the record, petitioner consistently pursued respondent for child support and\r\n  medical expenses.Â  Her claims go at least as far back as 1997 when she sent a\r\n  certified letter to respondent demanding various expenses.Â  The 1994 North Carolina order, which made respondent responsible for child support and health\r\n  insurance/medical expenses, was registered in South Carolina in 1998.Â  The\r\n  record also reveals: (1) a 2002 order which set child support at $102 per week,\r\n  plus $20 per week for arrears, and also set out the above-discussed formula for\r\n  respondentâ€™s obligations regarding medical expenses; (2) a 2003 order which\r\n  reduced the child support obligation to $62 per week, plus the $20 for arrears;\r\n  and (3) a 2004 order which increased child support to $81.79 per week, plus $20\r\n  for arrears.\r\nThe evidence therefore is\r\n  undeniable petitioner never made any assurances or representations to\r\n  respondent that he was not responsible for the court-ordered obligations\r\n  regarding child support and medical expenses.Â  Thus, petitioner is not\r\n  equitably estopped from asserting her claims regarding retroactive child\r\n  support, health insurance, and medical expenses.\r\nA.&nbsp; Retroactive Child\r\n  Support\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  decision to order retroactive support rests within the\r\n  sound discretion of the family court and should not be reversed absent an abuse\r\n  of discretion by the family court.â€Â  Thornton v. Thornton, 328\r\n  S.C. 96, 115, 492 S.E.2d 86, 96&nbsp;(1997).Â  Furthermore, the family court is â€œempowered\r\n  to modify child support upon a proper showing of a change in either the\r\n  childâ€™s needs or the supporting parentâ€™s financial ability.â€Â  Henderson v.\r\n    Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 196, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129&nbsp;(1989) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  The party seeking the modification has the burden to show changed\r\n  circumstances.Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 26, 624 S.E.2d 643,\r\n  648&nbsp;(2006).\r\nHere,\r\n  the family court relied on laches and therefore did not make a decision on the\r\n  facts.Â  In our opinion, the evidence presented by petitioner at the hearing simply\r\n  does not support her claim for retroactive child support, and therefore, we affirm\r\n  the denial of retroactive child support.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, supra (in appeals from the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with\r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence).Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  testified at the hearing that respondent was making at least ten percent more\r\n  than his reported $910 per month between 1994 and 1998, and that when the child\r\n  support was increased in 2002, his â€œincome had significantly increased over the\r\n  last time [she] received [a] child support increase.â€ However, our review of\r\n  the record reveals that these are assumptions made by petitioner which were not\r\n  supported by any specific evidence.[7]Â \r\n  Therefore, we find petitioner failed to carry her burden of proof for a\r\n  retroactive increase in child support.Â  Cf. Upchurch v. Upchurch,\r\n  367 S.C. at 26, 624 S.E.2d at 648 (â€œgeneral testimony regarding increased\r\n  expenses, without specific evidentiary support, is an insufficient showing of\r\n  changed circumstancesâ€).\r\nB.&nbsp; Health Insurance Premiums\r\n  and Medical Expenses\r\nPetitioner also\r\n  claims she is entitled to $8,035.14 for un-reimbursed health insurance premiums\r\n  and out-of-pocket medical expenses.Â  It appears from the documentation provided\r\n  by petitioner at the hearing that this sum primarily represents health care\r\n  insurance premiums that were paid from 1994 though 2005.Â  The only exception\r\n  appears to be a dental expense related to a root canal for $668.75.\r\nThe family court\r\n  ordered respondent to pay petitioner $305.69 of the root canal expense based on\r\n  the formula set out in the 2002 order.[8]Â \r\n  Curiously, petitioner has not, in any of the subsequent filings, even mentioned\r\n  this award.Â  Moreover, respondent has not submitted any filings at either\r\n  appellate level, so this award is the law of the case.Â  E.g., Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 65, 624 S.E.2d 649, 653-54&nbsp;(2006) (an unappealed ruling\r\n  is the law of the case).\r\nThus, the only remaining\r\n  issue is whether petitioner is entitled to be reimbursed for monies spent for\r\n  health insurance premiums.Â  We find she is not.Â  The 1994 North Carolina order\r\n  specified that respondent was to provide health insurance coverage for the\r\n  child when â€œavailable at a reasonable cost,â€ and defined that to mean health\r\n  insurance that â€œis employment related or other group insurance.â€Â \r\n  Significantly, however, this order also provided that if respondent failed to\r\n  obtain health insurance coverage, he would be liable for any medical expenses\r\n  incurred.Â  Given that there was never a court order in place that absolutely required respondent to pay for health insurance, petitioner cannot now claim she must be\r\n  reimbursed for those costs.\r\nIn sum, we hold the\r\n  doctrine of laches does not apply to petitionerâ€™s claims for retroactive child\r\n  support and medical related expenses; therefore, it was error to bar these\r\n  claims on that basis.Â  Moreover, we find petitioner is not equitably estopped\r\n  from pursuing these claims.Â  However, on the merits, petitioner failed to carry\r\n  her burden of proof that she was entitled to either a retroactive increase in\r\n  child support or reimbursement for health care premiums paid between 1994 and\r\n  2005.Â  Thus, the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision upholding the family courtâ€™s denial\r\n  of these particular claims is affirmed as modified.\r\n2.Â  Childcare and Private School ExpensesÂ Â Â Â Â  \r\nPetitioner next\r\n  argues that as to her additional claims for childcare and private school\r\n  expenses, the Court of Appeals erred in finding, on the merits, that laches\r\n  bars these claims.[9]\r\nLaches\r\n  may be established if there is an unreasonable and unexplained delay in\r\n  asserting a legal claim.Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. at 198-99, 371\r\n  S.E.2d at 527-28.Â  In order to prove the affirmative defense of laches, the\r\n  burden is on respondent to establish (1) delay, (2) unreasonable delay, and (3)\r\n  prejudice.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, â€œ[t]he inquiry into the applicability of\r\n  laches is highly fact-specific and each case must be judged by its own\r\n  merits.â€Â  Emery v. Smith,&nbsp;361 S.C. 207, 216, 603 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  602&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).\r\nPetitioner asserts\r\n  that her alleged delay in pursuing these claims was neither unreasonable nor\r\n  unexplained.Â  According to petitioner, she believed that DSS was seeking these\r\n  expenses on her behalf throughout the time it was acting as her attorney for\r\n  the child support enforcement actions.Â  Upon learning from the family court at\r\n  the March 30, 2005, hearing that she was unable to present these requests,\r\n  petitioner retained private counsel and filed the instant action on June 23,\r\n  2005.[10]Â \r\n  Thus, petitioner maintains there was no delay, or at the very least, not an\r\n  unexplained or unreasonable delay.\r\nWe agree.Â  Although\r\n  it appears these claims were not formally asserted in the family court prior to\r\n  2005, the record shows that at least as far back as 1997, petitioner was\r\n  attempting to collect childcare and educational expenses.Â  Cf. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Holden,&nbsp;319 S.C. 72, 459 S.E.2d 846 (1995) (where\r\n  mother continually asked father to pay child support, no unreasonable delay\r\n  established for laches).Â  Moreover, the family courtâ€™s April 2005 order reflects\r\n  that petitioner believed DSS was in a capacity to pursue these claims for her,\r\n  when it fact that agency was not. Â Thus, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™\r\n  holding that petitioner unreasonably delayed bringing a legal claim for the\r\n  past childcare and educational expenses.\r\nOn the merits, the\r\n  family court did not make any factual findings regarding petitionerâ€™s claims\r\n  for expenses related to childcare and private school.Â  See Rule 26(a),\r\n  SCRFC (â€œAn order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic\r\n  relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law to support the courtâ€™s decision.â€). Â As to the claim for private school\r\n  expenses, the family court denied the request based on laches and the\r\n  legal conclusion that â€œabsent extremely unusual circumstances, this Court does\r\n  not require non-custodial parents to pay for private school costs.â€ \r\nOn\r\n  the issue of private school tuition, we find our cases turn on the facts of\r\n  each case, not necessarily â€œextremely unusual circumstances.â€Â  See, e.g., Rabon v. Rabon,&nbsp;288 S.C. 338, 342 S.E.2d 605&nbsp;(1986) (where the\r\n  Court ordered an increase in child support to cover private school costs after\r\n  mother moved from Florence to Columbia and decided to enroll the four children\r\n  at Heathwood Hall).Â  Thus, the family court should evaluate this claim on the\r\n  facts presented.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  a remand is necessary on the issue of whether petitioner is entitled to be\r\n  reimbursed for any portion of the childcare and private school expenses\r\n  incurred during the childâ€™s minority.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; Health Insurance Premium Credit\r\nAt the family court level, petitioner alleged\r\n  respondent was credited for paying health insurance premiums between 2003 and\r\n  2005 when in fact he did not actually provide coverage for the child.Â  The\r\n  family court therefore found the following:\r\n\r\n\tAccording to the South Carolina Child\r\n  Support Guidelines, if the credit for the insurance premium is removed for the\r\n  period of time in question, [respondent] should have been paying $67.00 a week\r\n  rather than the $62 he was actually paying.Â  Sixty payments were made during\r\n  this period, and [respondent] will therefore be required to reimburse\r\n  [petitioner] $300.00.\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Petitioner contends, however, that\r\n  because respondentâ€™s child support obligation was adjusted by $44 per month,\r\n  she should have received $11 back for the 60 weekly payments, for a total of\r\n  $660.00.Â  \r\nWe find the family\r\n  court correctly calculated the amount.Â  Although the child support worksheet\r\n  shows that respondent was indeed credited with $44 for a health insurance\r\n  premium, it does not necessarily follow that his total obligation was thereby\r\n  reduced by the same amount.Â  The Court of Appeals correctly noted that\r\n  petitionerâ€™s claim did not at all reference the appropriate child support\r\n  guidelines.Â  See S.C. Ann. Regs. Â§Â§ 114-1710 &amp; 114-4720 (Supp.\r\n  2007).\r\nBecause the family court correctly\r\n  addressed this issue and the Court of Appeals affirmed, there is no error on\r\n  this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm in part,\r\n  as modified, the denial of petitionerâ€™s claims regarding retroactive child\r\n  support, health insurance, and medical expenses.Â  As to petitionerâ€™s claims for\r\n  private school costs and childcare, we reverse the decision that these claims\r\n  are barred by laches and remand to the family court for a resolution on the\r\n  merits. Â Finally, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that the family\r\n  correctly calculated the award resulting from respondent being improperly\r\n  credited with paying health insurance premiums between 2003 and 2005.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART\r\n  AS MODIFIED; REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the result\r\n  reached by the majority on the issue of child support, but I write separately\r\n  because as I stated in Strickland, the defense of laches should not be\r\n  precluded simply because of the existence of a continuing court order.Â  Thus, I\r\n  would affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that laches bars petitionerâ€™s claims\r\n  for health insurance premiums, medical expenses, and childcare/school expenses.\r\nI agree with the\r\n  majorityâ€™s conclusion that petitioner did not meet her burden in proving she\r\n  was entitled to retroactive child support.Â  However, I would hold that laches\r\n  and other equitable defenses may prevent a parent from collecting retroactive\r\n  child support, even when interposed against an existing court order.Â  I\r\n  recognize that these equitable defenses should not apply, absent extraordinary\r\n  circumstances, when enforcement of child support is sought on behalf of the\r\n  minor child.Â  See Garris v. Cook, 278 S.C. 622, 300 S.E.2d 483\r\n  (1983) (a parentâ€™s wrongful act should not prejudice the minor childâ€™s right to\r\n  support).\r\nI would affirm the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in its entirety.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent has not filed a brief with the Court, and\r\n  also did not file a brief at the Court of Appeals.Â  He was, however,\r\n  represented by private counsel at the family court level.\r\n[2] Petitioner testified that she initially enrolled\r\n  her daughter in private school because her daughter was used to a small student-teacher\r\n  ratio from her Department of Defense schools in Japan, and the public schools\r\n  had â€œmuch largerâ€ classrooms.\r\n[3] The order is entitled â€œVoluntary Support Agreement\r\n  and Approval by Court.â€Â  Petitioner is listed as the â€œPerson Enforcing Support\r\n  Obligation.â€Â  \r\n[4] We note that in petitionerâ€™s complaint, she asserted\r\n  that she â€œconsented to [respondentâ€™s] motion to file a new action to address\r\n  the unresolved issues in the April 8, 2005 Order as well as other matters\r\n  requested by [petitioner] in order to provide [respondent] with an opportunity\r\n  to respond.â€Â  Respondent admitted this allegation in his answer.\r\n[5] We recognize the Court of Appeals was decided in\r\n  December 2006, some eight months before this Courtâ€™s decision in Strickland.\r\n[6] Petitioner acknowledges that because her claims for\r\n  daycare and educational expenses were never the subject of a prior court order,\r\n  the Strickland analysis does not apply to those requests.Â  She instead\r\n  argues the Court of Appeals erred in applying the laches doctrine to those\r\n  claims.Â  See issue 2, infra.\r\n[7] Indeed, petitioner specifically stated the following\r\n  at the hearing:Â  â€œIâ€™m asking the court to require [respondent] to provide the\r\n  income information.â€Â  She asserted she had â€œpersonal knowledgeâ€ regarding his\r\n  income between March 2001 and May 2002, but presented no documentary proof of\r\n  her claim.\r\n[8] Petitioner was responsible for the first $250, and\r\n  then respondent was responsible for 73% of the remainder.\r\n[9] Unlike basic child support and medical expenses, the\r\n  costs for childcare and private school were never the subject of a court\r\n  order.Â  Therefore, the Strickland analysis is not directly applicable,\r\n  and a laches defense may apply.\r\n[10] As recounted in the Facts section, supra, the\r\n  family courtâ€™s April 18, 2005 order specifically stated that petitionerâ€™s other\r\n  issues were â€œreservedâ€ and would be addressed at a future hearing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26519","title":"State v.

Light, 363 S.C. 325, 610 S.E.2d 504 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  We now reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner was arrested during a traffic\r\n  stop in Texas.Â  During the course of the arrest, Texas authorities discovered\r\n  petitionerâ€™s girlfriend, Priscilla Davis (Davis), was missing, and questioned\r\n  petitioner about her disappearance.Â  Petitioner admitting killing Davis.Â  In his statement, petitioner told Texas authorities that he emerged from the\r\n  bathroom in his home to find Davis holding a long strand of brown hair and his\r\n  .22 rifle.[1]Â \r\n  Davis accused petitioner of having another woman in the house, which\r\n  petitioner denied.Â  He stated in a recorded statement:\r\n\r\n\tShe went to acting a fool and called me a\r\n  liar.Â  And the only thing I could think of, I was - I tried to distract her.Â  I\r\n  remember swinging my left arm, I think it was, to get the rifle out of her\r\n  hand.Â  When I did, all I can tell you, it went off.Â  Honestly, I didnâ€™t even\r\n  think it hit her.\r\n\tThen she fell.Â  I thought it might have\r\n  just grazed her in the shoulder.Â  So I ran out the back door to go get help\r\n  because I donâ€™t have a telephone.Â  I ran back to her and she wasnâ€™t breathing,\r\n  and I just panicked.Â  I didnâ€™t think nobody would believe me.Â  So the only\r\n  thing I did, I just put her in the trunk of the car; and I just took off.Â  I\r\n  just drove and kept driving. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Texas Ranger\r\n  who interviewed petitioner testified petitioner did not claim that Davis pointed the rifle at him or that she threatened to shoot him.Â  He also testified\r\n  petitioner later altered his story, admitting he took the rifle from Davis before it was fired.Â  The Ranger testified petitioner told him â€œthe rifle was in my\r\n  hand when it went off, I will not deny that.Â  I took it from her.Â  It was\r\n  either her or me.Â  I could have run, like I told them; but I didnâ€™t really\r\n  think about it.â€Â  In his statement, petitioner stated they were standing face\r\n  to face when the shooting occurred.\r\nThe\r\n  State presented evidence from a firearms expert, who testified there was no\r\n  gunshot residue around the entrance wound in Davisâ€™ chest.[2]Â  The expert testified he believed the\r\n  shot was consistent with a distant shot of about thirty to fifty inches.Â  The\r\n  Stateâ€™s pathologist testified the angle of the bullet wound through Davisâ€™ body made it likely Davis was sitting or kneeling when shot.Â  He testified the\r\n  wound was consistent with a purposeful shooting and inconsistent with an\r\n  accidental shooting.\r\nAfter\r\n  the State finished its case in chief, the State argued petitioner was not entitled\r\n  to a self-defense charge because there was no evidence petitioner was in danger\r\n  of losing his life or of sustaining serious bodily injury.Â  Petitioner argued\r\n  that, at the time of the shooting, he was still â€œunder the influence of the\r\n  initial aggressive act he contends was committed by the victim.â€Â  The trial\r\n  judge delayed his ruling until after petitioner presented his case.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, petitioner testified Davis had been acting jealous and following him for\r\n  several weeks before the incident.Â  Petitioner made this same claim in his\r\n  earlier statement to police.Â  He testified she told him that if she ever caught\r\n  him with another woman, â€œitâ€™s going to be messy.â€Â  Petitioner testified the\r\n  morning of the incident[3] he left to get breakfast for Davis.Â  After returning, he came out of the\r\n  bathroom and found her holding a long brown hair[4] and his .22 rifle, stating she believed petitioner had another woman in the\r\n  house.Â  He testified:\r\n\r\n\tShe was pointing [the gun] at me and screaming and\r\n  hollering and accusing me as usual.Â  I asked her, â€œWhat the heck is wrong with\r\n  you, you know?Â  There has . . . not been another woman in this house.â€\r\n\tShe just kept on and on, screaming and screaming at me.Â \r\n  I was afraid she was going to shoot me.Â  So during the screaming -- and my\r\n  living room is very small.Â  Yâ€™all have seen that.Â  Between the two couches is\r\n  where this happened.\r\n\tThe only thing I remember, I did try -- I took my left\r\n  hand to knock it away, try to push it away from me.Â  Than [sic] after I jerked\r\n  it away from her, I did stumble back several feet, you know, after jerking it.Â \r\n  The weapon discharged but it was not intentionally [sic].Â  \r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Was that in your hands?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; It was in my hands.Â  I do not deny that.\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; And you pulled the trigger?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; Not intentionally but I had to.\r\n\t[Solicitor] Swarat:Â  Iâ€™m sorry, I couldnâ€™t hear that.Â  â€œI did not\r\n  intentionally but I had to.â€Â  Was that what he said?\r\n\t[Petitioner]:Â  I said I didnâ€™t intentionally pull the\r\n  trigger.\r\n\t[Counsel for petitioner]:Â  He had to have pulled the\r\n  trigger, I think is what he said.\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; No one else pulled the trigger?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; There was nobody else holding the gun.Â  I mean, letâ€™s be\r\n  logical.Â  It was just me and her there.Â  But after I jerked the weapon out of\r\n  her hand it [fired] . . . .\r\n\r\nAt trial,\r\n  petitioner testified he and Davis were not standing face to face.Â  He stated, â€œwhen\r\n  you are arguing like that . . . There is a lot of movement going on. . . . she\r\n  was crouched down.â€\r\nPetitioner\r\n  further stated, â€œAfter we fought over the rifle, jerked it away from her, still\r\n  screaming and hollering at each other, I think she stopped - scooted down some,\r\n  . . . The rifle did go off in our argument.â€\r\nFollowing\r\n  the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge denied petitionerâ€™s request to\r\n  charge self-defense.Â  Petitioner also requested a charge on involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  Petitioner argued that if the jury believed petitioner wrestled\r\n  the rifle away from Davis and subsequently wielded it in a reckless fashion,\r\n  there would be a sufficient basis for charging involuntary manslaughter.Â  The\r\n  trial judge refused, stating he did not see any indication of recklessness in\r\n  petitionerâ€™s actions.Â  The trial judge charged the jury on murder, voluntary manslaughter,\r\n  and accident.Â  The jury found petitioner guilty of murder.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial\r\n  court err by denying petitionerâ€™s request for a jury instruction on involuntary\r\n  manslaughter?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial\r\n  court err by finding petitioner was not entitled to a jury instruction on\r\n  self-defense?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Involuntary manslaughter\r\nThe Court of Appeals found the trial court\r\n  properly refused to charge involuntary manslaughter.Â  The court stated there was\r\n  no evidence petitioner handled the gun with reckless disregard for the safety\r\n  of others.[5]Â  See State v. Reese, 370\r\n  S.C. 31, 633 S.E.2d 898 (2006) (involuntary\r\n  manslaughter is the unintentional killing of another without malice and while\r\n  engaged in either:Â  (1) an unlawful act not amounting to a felony and not\r\n  naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm; or (2) a lawful act with\r\n  reckless disregard for the safety of others).\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred by\r\n  finding he was not entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction.Â  He\r\n  relies on the cases of State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999), and State v.\r\n    Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 584 S.E.2d 110 (2003), for support.\r\nIn State v. Burriss, 334\r\n  S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999), Burriss was attacked by the victim and\r\n  another man.Â  After being pushed to the ground, Burriss drew a gun from his\r\n  pocket and fired twice into the ground, causing both assailants to back away.Â \r\n  As Burriss was attempting to get off the ground, one of the assailants advanced\r\n  towards Burriss, who was separated from his gun.Â  Burriss grabbed the gun and\r\n  it accidentally fired, killing one of the assailants.Â  We held Burriss was\r\n  entitled to a charge on involuntary manslaughter because the evidence supported\r\n  a finding that he was lawfully armed in self-defense at the time the fatal shot\r\n  occurred and there was evidence he handled the loaded gun in a negligent\r\n  manner.\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 584 S.E.2d 110 (2003), Crosby claimed he was\r\n  trying to break up a fight between three women, one of whom was the victimâ€™s\r\n  girlfriend.Â  Crosby claimed the victim told him not to put his hands on his\r\n  girlfriend and then charged at Crosby with his hands behind his back.Â  Crosby then pulled a gun out of his pocket and closed his eyes and pulled the trigger.Â  Crosby claimed he did not realize he had pulled the trigger.Â  We held Crosby was entitled\r\n  to an involuntary manslaughter charge because there was ample evidence from\r\n  which the jury could have inferred Crosby did not intentionally discharge the\r\n  weapon.\r\nAlthough petitioner\r\n  had inconsistent stories, we find he was entitled to a charge on involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  The Court of Appeals distinguished Burriss and Crosby by finding that, although petitionerâ€™s statements support a finding he was\r\n  lawfully armed in self-defense at the time of the shooting, there is no\r\n  evidence of recklessness as required to warrant an involuntary manslaughter\r\n  charge.Â  The Court of Appeals correctly found petitioner was lawfully armed in\r\n  self-defense[6] at the time of the shooting because, according to his testimony, petitioner\r\n  took the loaded gun from Davis who was threatening him with it.Â  There was also\r\n  evidence petitioner recklessly handled the gun because, according to his\r\n  testimony, it fired almost immediately after he took possession of it.Â  As\r\n  specifically stated in Burriss, the negligent handling of a loaded gun\r\n  will support a finding of involuntary manslaughter.Â  See also State\r\n    v. White, 253 S.C. 475, 171 S.E.2d 712, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 987 (1969) (same).Â  Further, the fact petitioner and Davis were struggling over the\r\n  weapon is sufficient evidence to support an involuntary manslaughter charge to\r\n  the jury.Â  Casey v. State, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 (1991) (evidence\r\n  of a struggle between a defendant and a victim over a weapon is sufficient for\r\n  submission of an involuntary manslaughter instruction to the jury).Â \r\n  Accordingly, there was evidence to support a charge of involuntary manslaughter\r\n  and, therefore, the trial court should have so charged the jury.Â  See State\r\n    v. Reese, 370 S.C. 31, 633 S.E.2d 898 (2006) (if there is any evidence\r\n  warranting a charge on involuntary manslaughter, then the charge must be\r\n  given); State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 433 S.E.2d 848 (1993) (trial court\r\n  commits reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge on an issue\r\n  raised by the evidence).\r\nII. Self-defense\r\nThe Court of Appeals noted that petitioner\r\n  testified he had disarmed Davis and had taken possession of the rifle when the\r\n  shot was fired.Â  Under those facts, the court held Davis no longer posed any\r\n  threat to petitioner and he could not have reasonably believed she did.Â  The\r\n  court held the evidence demonstrated petitioner did not have the right to use\r\n  deadly force in self-defense and the trial judge correctly refused to charge the\r\n  jury on self-defense.\r\nA self-defense charge is not required\r\n  unless it is supported by the evidence.Â  State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 440 S.E.2d 370 (1994).Â  To establish self-defense in South Carolina, four elements must be present:Â  (1) the\r\n  defendant must be without fault in bringing on the difficulty; (2) the\r\n  defendant must have been in actual imminent danger of losing his life or\r\n  sustaining serious bodily injury, or he must have\r\n  actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining\r\n  serious bodily injury; (3) if his defense is based upon his belief of imminent\r\n  danger, the defendant must show that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary\r\n  firmness and courage would have entertained the belief that he was actually in\r\n  imminent danger and that the circumstances were such as would warrant a person\r\n  of ordinary prudence, firmness, and courage to strike the fatal blow in order\r\n  to save himself from serious bodily harm or the loss of his life; and (4) the\r\n  defendant had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.Â  State v.\r\n    Slater, 373 S.C. 66, 644 S.E.2d 50 (2007).Â  If there is any evidence in the\r\n  record from which it could reasonably be inferred that the defendant acted in self-defense, the defendant is entitled to\r\n  instructions on the defense, and the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to do so is\r\n  reversible error.Â  Id.\r\nWe find\r\n  petitioner was entitled to a self-defense charge.Â  In a statement to police, petitioner indicated he took\r\n  the gun from Davis and that it was â€œeither her or me.â€Â  This statement\r\n  indicates he believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life.Â  Also,\r\n  petitioner testified that in the preceding weeks, Davis had been acting\r\n  jealous, following him, and had told him that if she ever caught him with\r\n  another woman it was â€œgoing to be messy.â€Â  This evidence suggested that\r\n  petitioner was reasonable in his belief that it was either Davisâ€™ or his life\r\n  at stake when the struggle for the gun began.Â  Accordingly, the trial court\r\n  erred by failing to charge self-defense given there was evidence to support the\r\n  charge.Â  See State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298&nbsp;(2002) (if there is any\r\n  evidence in the record to support self-defense, the issue should be submitted\r\n  to the jury).\r\nA past holding of\r\n  this Court seems to indicate that, where a defendant is claiming self-defense,\r\n  as petitioner is here, involuntary manslaughter may not be charged. Â In State\r\n    v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996),[7] we held that where a defendant admits he intentionally shot his gun, but that\r\n  he did so while acting lawfully but recklessly in defending himself, he is not\r\n  entitled to a charge of involuntary manslaughter.Â  However, a self-defense\r\n  charge and an involuntary manslaughter charge are not mutually exclusive, as\r\n  long as there is any evidence to support both charges.Â  See Crosby v.\r\n    State, 355 S.C. 47, 584 S.E.2d 110 (2003) (improper to hold that any\r\n  evidence of an intentional shooting negates evidence from which any other\r\n  inference may be drawn); Casey v. State, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391\r\n  (1991) (error by trial court in not charging involuntary manslaughter, even\r\n  though the trial court charged murder, voluntary manslaughter, accident, and\r\n  self-defense); State v. Turbeville, 275 S.C. 534, 273 S.E.2d 764 (1981)\r\n  (defendant charged with involuntary manslaughter was not entitled to\r\n  self-defense charge because there was no testimony concerning self-defense in\r\n  the trial record; indicating the charge would be appropriate if there was\r\n  testimony concerning self-defense).Â  When there is a factual issue as to\r\n  whether the shooting was committed intentionally in self-defense or was\r\n  committed unintentionally, then the defendant is entitled to both charges as\r\n  there is â€œany evidenceâ€ to support each charge.Â  When there is evidence of both,\r\n  as in this case, we find the jury is entitled to resolve the question of how\r\n  the shooting actually occurred.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that, under\r\n  the particular facts of this case, petitioner was entitled to the charges of\r\n  self-defense and involuntary manslaughter.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the\r\n  Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would affirm the\r\n  conviction and hold that the trial court properly refused to charge both involuntary\r\n  manslaughter and self-defense.\r\nThe majority finds that Petitioner was entitled to an\r\n  involuntary manslaughter charge because there was evidence that Petitioner\r\n  recklessly handled the gun and that Petitioner and the victim struggled over\r\n  the gun.Â  In my opinion, the evidence does not support these findings.Â \r\n  According to Petitionerâ€™s own testimony, the gun discharged after he retrieved\r\n  it from the victim, while the gun was in his possession, and as he stumbled\r\n  backwards.Â  In my view, this testimony is not evidence that Petitioner\r\n  recklessly handled the gun or that the gun fired during the struggle.Â  Compare State v. White, 253 S.C. 475, 171 S.E.2d 712 (1969)\r\n  (holding that the defendantâ€™s testimony regarding the shooting provided\r\n  sufficient evidence to warrant an inference that the victimâ€™s\r\n  death was caused by the negligent handling of a loaded pistol); Tisdale v. State, S.C. Sup. Ct. Op. No. 26495(filed May 27, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.\r\n  No. 22 at 21) (finding that the defendantâ€™s testimony that the gun discharged\r\n  while he and the victim struggled over the gun supported an involuntary\r\n  manslaughter charge).Â  Rather, I believe that this testimony presents a\r\n  standard example of accident, on which the trial court properly instructed the\r\n  jury.Â  See State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999)\r\n  (holding that a defendant is entitled to a charge on accident where there is\r\n  evidence that he armed himself in self-defense but the shooting occurs\r\n  accidentally); State v.\r\n    Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 280 440 S.E.2d 370,\r\n  372 (1994) (recognizing that for a homicide\r\n  to be excusable on the ground of accident, it must be shown that the killing\r\n  was unintentional, that the defendant was acting lawfully, and that due care\r\n  was exercised in the handling of the weapon).[8]Â  Accordingly, I would hold that there is no evidence to support an\r\n  involuntary manslaughter charge.\r\nIn my opinion, the majority also errs in holding that\r\n  Petitioner was entitled to a self-defense charge.Â  Even assuming that\r\n  Petitioner reasonably believed that he was in imminent danger when the victim\r\n  first confronted him with the gun due to the victimâ€™s previous threats,\r\n  Petitioner testified that he â€œjerkedâ€ the gun away from the victim, the victim\r\n  was â€œcrouched downâ€ when she was shot, and that he did not intentionally pull\r\n  the trigger. Â Thus, in my view, Petitioner was neither in imminent danger nor\r\n  did he believe he was in imminent danger at the time he shot the victim.Â  I\r\n  would therefore hold that the trial court properly refused to charge self-defense.Â  See State v. Bruno, 322 S.C. 534, 536, 473 S.E.2d 450, 452 (1996) (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a self-defense charge where he\r\n  presented no evidence that he believed that he was in imminent danger when he\r\n  shot the victim).Â  \r\nWhile I agree with the majority that a self-defense\r\n  charge and involuntary manslaughter charge are not necessarily mutually\r\n  exclusive, there must be some evidence in the record to support the charges,\r\n  and in my opinion, no evidence in the record supports either charge in this\r\n  case.Â  For these reasons, I would hold that the trial court properly refused to\r\n  give an involuntary manslaughter charge and a self-defense charge.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Petitioner\r\n  always kept this rifle loaded. \r\n[2]Petitioner\r\n  disposed of Davisâ€™ body in Alabama on his way to Texas.Â  He led police to her\r\n  body after he admitted his involvement in Davisâ€™ death.\r\n[3]The\r\n  night before, petitioner and Davis had been at a bar until approximately 3:30\r\n  a.m.Â  There was testimony they were not arguing or fighting and were dancing to\r\n  slow songs.Â  There was also testimony that, when Davis and petitioner left,\r\n  petitioner had Davis, who was crying, by the arm. \r\n[4]The\r\n  brown hair and the lubricant bottle that the hair was allegedly found on were\r\n  not recovered when petitionerâ€™s house was processed for evidence.\r\n[5]The Court of Appeals noted petitioner argued in his\r\n  statement of issues that the gun discharged while petitioner and Davis were\r\n  struggling over the gun and that, as a result, it was â€œa classic case of\r\n  involuntary manslaughter.â€Â  The court held an involuntary manslaughter charge\r\n  would have been warranted if there was evidence the gun discharged while\r\n  petitioner and Davis were struggling over it.Â  However, the court noted\r\n  petitioner failed to argue the gun discharged during the course of the struggle\r\n  in his brief; therefore, it held petitioner abandoned the issue on appeal.Â \r\n  We disagree that petitioner abandoned his argument.Â  Throughout his brief, petitioner discussed the struggle for the gun.\r\n[6]The Burriss court noted that there is a difference between being lawfully armed in self-defense and acting in self-defense.Â  Burriss, 334 S.C. at\r\n  265, n.10, 513 S.E.2d at 109, n.10.Â  At this point in the analysis, we are\r\n  concerned only with whether petitioner had a right to be armed for purposes of\r\n  determining whether he was engaged in a lawful act, i.e. was lawfully\r\n  armed, and not whether he actually acted in self-defense when the shooting\r\n  occurred. \r\n[7]In Pickens, Pickens and a co-defendant began shooting in self-defense when\r\n  a group of ten to twelve people rushed them outside of a Waffle House. \r\n[8] I agree with the majority insofar as I believe that Petitioner had the right to\r\n  take the weapon away from the victim.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26520","title":"State v.

Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001).Â  Â  Following a\r\n  bench resentencing proceeding, appellant again received a death sentence.Â  This\r\n  Court vacated that sentence, finding the trial judgeâ€™s comments to appellant in\r\n  regard to his right to a jury trial constituted reversible error.Â  State v.\r\n    Owens, 362 S.C. 175, 607 S.E.2d 78 (2004).\r\nThis second resentencing was tried to a jury which returned a death sentence, finding two\r\n  aggravating circumstances: (1) the murder was committed in the commission of\r\n  robbery while armed with a deadly weapon and (2) the murder was committed while\r\n  in the commission of larceny with use of a deadly weapon.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(d) and (e).Â  Appellant raises three issues on appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1)&nbsp; Whether the trial judge erred in\r\n  disqualifying a juror?\r\n\t2)&nbsp; Whether the solicitorâ€™s closing\r\n  argument was improper?\r\n\t3)&nbsp; Whether the trial judge erred in\r\n  admitting redacted prison disciplinary records?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant conceded\r\n  at oral argument that there was no objection at trial to the juror\r\n  disqualification or to the closing argument.Â  Without an objection, neither of\r\n  these issues is properly preserved for appellate review. Â E.g., State\r\n    v. Stone, 376 S.C. 32, 655 S.E.2d 487 fn. 1 (2007) (â€œSouth Carolinaâ€™s\r\n  strict error preservation rules are no less applicable in death penalty\r\n  casesâ€).Â  Under these circumstances, we do not reach the merits of either\r\n  issue.\r\nOne issue is\r\n  preserved for review: Â Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting a\r\n  list of disciplinary infractions allegedly committed by appellant while in the\r\n  Department of Corrections because its admission violated the prohibition\r\n  against hearsay, appellantâ€™s Confrontation Clause rights, and his due process\r\n  rights.Â  Neither the Confrontation Clause nor due process was raised to the\r\n  trial court, and accordingly neither constitutional claim is preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  State v. Stone, supra.Â  We address only the hearsay\r\n  issue.\r\nThe trial judge\r\n  permitted the State to introduce a redacted version of appellantâ€™s prison\r\n  offenses pursuant to the business records exception to the rule against\r\n  hearsay.Â  In so doing, he required the State to omit from the list all details\r\n  of the incidents, and all incidents not witnessed by a prison guard or staff\r\n  member.Â  These rulings reduced the number of incidents to 28, which were\r\n  presented to the jury in this format[2]:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tApril 13, 2001, breaks toilet,\r\n  sink and sprinkler\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tMay 26, 2001, throws hot water on\r\n  another inmate\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tMay 27, 2001, had a six and a half\r\n  inch shank made from fencing and toothbrush\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4.\r\n\t\t\tJune 14, 2001, spat on a\r\n  correctional officer\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5.\r\n\t\t\tFebruary 8, 2002, a 14 inch solid\r\n  brass shank\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6.\r\n\t\t\tMarch 29, 2002, stabs correctional officer in the face with a \r\n\t\t\tshank\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t7.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tJune 12, 2002, stabs an inmate in the shower\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t8. \r\n\t\t\tJune 15, 2002, kicks an inmate who is restrained in a restraint \r\n\t\t\tchair\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t9.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAugust 5, 2002, slaps a male nurse in the face\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t10.\r\n\t\t\tAugust 17, 2002, throws a food tray and hits an officer in the \r\n\t\t\thead\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t11. \r\n\t\t\tAugust 23, 2002, struck an officer in the face with his fist\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t12. \r\n\t\t\tOctober 22, 2002, hits an officer in the face with his fist\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t13.\r\n\t\t\tOctober 23, 2002, sets fire to cell\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t14. \r\n\t\t\tDecember 22, 2002, shank made from fencing\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t15. \r\n\t\t\tDecember 30, 2002, a ten inch shank made from a push rod of the \r\n\t\t\tsink\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t16.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tJuly 17, 2005, spits in the face of an officer \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t17.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAugust 26, 2005, slaps an officer in the face\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t18.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAugust 31, 2005, sets fire to cell\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t19.\r\n\t\t\tSeptember 11, 2005, threatens an officer \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t20.\r\n\t\t\tJanuary 1, 2006, a 12 inch homemade knife\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t21.\r\n\t\t\tJanuary 3, 2006, breaks cell door window with broom stick\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t22. \r\n\t\t\tJanuary 13, 2006, throws feces on an officer, hitting him in the \r\n\t\t\tface\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t23.\r\n\t\t\tFebruary 3, 2006, spits in the face of another inmate\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t24.\r\n\t\t\tFebruary 4, 2006, orally threatens an officer \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t25. \r\n\t\t\tFebruary 28, 2006, a 12 inch weapon hidden between the \r\n\t\t\tmattresses\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t26.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tApril 4, 2006, an eight and a half inch shank made from flat \r\n\t\t\tmetal sharpened at the edge and wrapped with ace bandage\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t27. \r\n\t\t\tMay 1, 2006, sets fire to his mattress\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t28. \r\n\t\t\tMay 20, 2006, throws coffee on an officer\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends the records are inadmissible hearsay because they are not trustworthy\r\n  under Rule 803(6), SCRE.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision finding trustworthy those incidents witnessed by prison staff.Â  E.g., State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647 S.E.2d 144 (2007) (admission of\r\n  evidence with trial judgeâ€™s discretion); cf. Ohio v. Roberts, 448\r\n  U.S. 56 (1980) overruled on other grounds Crawford v. Washington,\r\n  541 U.S. 36 (2004) (properly administered, Rule 803(6) exceptions are among the\r\n  safest against a confrontation-clause challenges).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  appellant has not asked to argue against the precedent of State v. Whipple,\r\n  324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1996) which held that these types of prison\r\n  disciplinary records are admissible at the sentencing phase of a capital trial\r\n  under the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-5-510\r\n  (the Act).Â  Id. cited with approval in State v. Holmes, 361 S.C.\r\n  333, 605 S.E.2d 19 (2004) vacated and remanded on other grounds Holmes\r\n    v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319 (2006).Â  Appellant contends that the\r\n  continuing validity of Whipple is in doubt as that decision predates the\r\n  adoption of the SCRE, and alleges that Rule 803(6) added a veracity requirement\r\n  to the admissibility requirements for a business record.Â  Contrary to\r\n  appellantâ€™s position, trustworthiness is an issue under the Act, not a new\r\n  condition created by Rule 803(6).Â  Kershaw County Depâ€™t of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. McCaskill, 276 S.C. 360, 278 S.E.2d 771 (1981); see also State v. Rice, 375 S.C. 302, 652 S.E.2d 409 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nAppellant\r\n  failed to show an abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit\r\n  the redacted prison disciplinary incidents.Â  State v. Pittman, supra; State v. Whipple, supra.\r\nProportionality Review\r\nPursuant to S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(c) (2003), we have conducted a proportionality review and\r\n  find the death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other\r\n  arbitrary factor.Â  Furthermore, a review of other decisions demonstrates that\r\n  appellantâ€™s sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.Â  See State v. Humphries, 325 S.C. 28, 479 S.E.2d 52 (1996) (murder of\r\n  convenience store operator in the commission of attempted armed robbery); State\r\n    v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996) (murder of convenience store\r\n  operator in the commission of armed robbery).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellantâ€™s capital\r\n  sentence is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(A), no firearm sentence may be imposed where\r\n  the defendant receives a death sentence or life sentence without parole for the\r\n  violent crime.Â  The vacation of appellantâ€™s sentence was conditional: if\r\n  appellant were ultimately to receive a life sentence for murder, then the five\r\n  year sentence would be reimposed.\r\n[2] We have made one minor alteration in choosing to omit the names of the victims\r\n  from the list. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26521","title":"State v.

App.\r\n  2005).Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari and now affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMekler\r\n  and her neighbor, Robette Spires (Spires), were visiting on Meklerâ€™s front\r\n  porch one evening when Spiresâ€™ husband, Bubba, (Victim) drove his truck into\r\n  Meklerâ€™s yard.Â  Victim began screaming and yelling at Spires because Spires was\r\n  not at home and because Spires had not called him.Â  Mekler and Victim began\r\n  yelling at each other, and Mekler asked Victim to leave.Â  Victim left in his\r\n  truck and drove to Spiresâ€™ residence, which was one block away from Meklerâ€™s\r\n  home.[1]\r\nA few minutes\r\n  later, Victim walked back to Meklerâ€™s house.Â  According to Mekler, Victim\r\n  approached the porch, yelling and screaming in the same manner as before he\r\n  left.Â  Meklerâ€™s dog was attached to a chain on the porch and began barking at\r\n  Victim.Â  The chained dog then ran out on the porch steps towards Victim,\r\n  halting his progress.Â  Mekler grabbed the dog and noticed a knife in Victimâ€™s\r\n  hand.Â  Victim told Mekler the knife was for the dog.Â  After subduing the dog,\r\n  Mekler stepped inside her house and grabbed her shotgun, which she had placed\r\n  near the front door after Victim initially left.\r\nMekler testified\r\n  that after she stepped on the porch with the shotgun, she continued to ask\r\n  Victim to leave, but he continued to stand in the yard near the steps with the\r\n  knife and threatened to come up on the porch and get Spires.Â  Mekler testified\r\n  that she pulled the hammer back on the shotgun and positioned the gun at her\r\n  hip to do so.Â  Mekler recounted that when she cocked the gun, the Victim leaned\r\n  and the gun fired, but she did not remember pulling the trigger.Â  In three\r\n  separate statements to various law enforcement personnel and throughout her\r\n  trial testimony, Mekler maintained that she did not intentionally pull the\r\n  trigger.\r\nAt trial, defense\r\n  counsel requested a jury charge on self-defense, accident, and involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  The trial court refused to charge the jury on involuntary\r\n  manslaughter and accident.Â  The jury convicted Mekler of murder, and the judge\r\n  sentenced her to thirty years imprisonment.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed on\r\n  the grounds that: (1) the trial court failed to charge involuntary manslaughter;\r\n  and (2) the trial court failed to admit specific details of a prior act of\r\n  violence by Victim.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tI.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the Court of Appeals err in reversing Meklerâ€™s conviction due to the failure to\r\n  charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter?\r\n\tII.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the Court of Appeals err in reversing Meklerâ€™s conviction based on the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s denial of Meklerâ€™s request to introduce specific details of a prior\r\n  domestic violence incident between Spires and Victim?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Involuntary\r\n  manslaughter charge\r\nThe State argues\r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in reversing respondentâ€™s conviction based on the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s failure to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nInvoluntary\r\n  manslaughter is defined as (1) the unintentional killing of another without\r\n  malice but while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause\r\n  death or great bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional killing of another without\r\n  malice but while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the\r\n  safety of others.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 264-265, 513 S.E.2d\r\n  104, 109 (1999).Â  The negligent handling of a loaded gun will support a charge\r\n  of involuntary manslaughter.Â  Id. (citing State v. White, 253\r\n  S.C. 475, 171 S.E.2d 712 (1969)).Â  A trial court should refuse to charge the\r\n  lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter only where there is no\r\n  evidence the defendant committed the lesser offense.Â  State v. Crosby,\r\n  355 S.C. 47, 51, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2003).\r\nWe hold that the\r\n  Court of Appeals correctly held that there was evidence to support a finding\r\n  that Mekler was lawfully armed in self-defense and did not intentionally\r\n  discharge the shotgun.Â  Moreover, evidence exists to support a jury finding\r\n  that Meklerâ€™s recklessness caused the gun to fire.\r\nThe following\r\n  evidence adduced at trial supports the involuntary manslaughter charge: (1) the\r\n  three statements given by Mekler and introduced at trial in which Mekler stated\r\n  she did not remember pulling the trigger or the shotgun discharging; (2)\r\n  Meklerâ€™s trial testimony in which she stated she did not remember pulling the\r\n  trigger and had to be told by Spires that she shot Victim; (3) Meklerâ€™s trial\r\n  testimony in which she stated the gun was positioned at her hip so she could\r\n  cock the hammer back and that her finger must have slipped on the trigger,\r\n  causing the gun to fire suddenly; (4) testimony by a neighbor who looked out of\r\n  her window right before the shot was fired and saw one of Meklerâ€™s arms down at\r\n  her side and the other waving when she talked;[2] and (5) Meklerâ€™s insistence at trial that she did not intend to shoot Victim\r\n  and that she was shocked when the gun fired immediately after she cocked the\r\n  hammer.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the evidence supports a finding that Mekler, lawfully armed in self-defense,\r\n  unintentionally shot Victim while negligently handling the shotgun when her\r\n  finger slipped on the trigger after resting the gun on her hip to cock it.Â  See Burriss, supra (negligent handling of loaded gun will support a\r\n  finding of involuntary manslaughter).\r\nFinally,\r\n  a self-defense charge and an involuntary manslaughter charge are not mutually\r\n  exclusive, as long as there is any evidence to support both charges.Â  See Casey v. State, 305 S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 (1991) (error by trial\r\n  court in not charging involuntary manslaughter, even though the trial court\r\n  charged murder, voluntary manslaughter, accident, and self-defense); Crosby, supra (improper to hold that any evidence of an intentional shooting\r\n  negates evidence from which any other inference may be drawn); State v.\r\n    Light, Op. No. Â­Â­26519 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 14, 2008) (Shearouse Adv.\r\n  Sh. 29 at p. 42).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, there was evidence from which the inference could be drawn that\r\n  Mekler intentionally shot Victim in self-defense, and there was evidence that\r\n  Mekler unintentionally shot Victim while acting in reckless disregard of the\r\n  safety of others by negligently handling a loaded shotgun.Â  The jury should\r\n  have been allowed to determine how the shooting occurred, and the Court of\r\n  Appeals did not err by reversing and remanding for a new trial due to the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s failure to charge involuntary manslaughter.\r\nII.&nbsp; Evidence of prior act of Victim\r\nBecause\r\n  we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision to grant Mekler a new trial based on\r\n  failure to charge involuntary manslaughter, it is unnecessary to address the\r\n  second issue.Â  Whether this issue will arise on retrial and its resolution will\r\n  depend upon the evidence and testimony presented, and it will be for the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s consideration.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold that Mekler was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter charge because\r\n  evidence existed to support a finding that she was lawfully armed in\r\n  self-defense and that her reckless handling of the shotgun resulted in the\r\n  death of Victim.Â  Moreover, a charge of self-defense and a charge of\r\n  involuntary manslaughter are not mutually exclusive.Â  The decision of the Court\r\n  of Appeals is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, Acting Chief Justice, WALLER, J., and Acting Justices James E. Lockemy and J.\r\n  Michelle Childs, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although Spires and Victim were married, they lived in\r\n  separate residences.Â  \r\n[2] This supports Meklerâ€™s testimony that the gun was at\r\n  her hip when it discharged. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Rules Advisory Committee","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2008-07-01-01","description":"With the adoption of Rule 609, SCACR, the Supreme Court has created a Rules Advisory Committee.

(Sumatra), is a tobacco product manufacturer under the Tobacco Escrow Fund\r\n  Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-47-10, et seq. (Supp. 2007).Â  The State alleged\r\n  Sumatra had failed to make the escrow deposit and provide the certification\r\n  required by the Act for cigarettes that had been sold in South Carolina.\r\n\\Sumatra filed an\r\n  answer and moved to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  In a\r\n  2003 order, the court ruled it had personal jurisdiction.Â  The parties then\r\n  filed cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  In a 2006 order, the court granted\r\n  the Stateâ€™s motion and denied Sumatraâ€™s motion.Â  The court found that Sumatra had failed to comply with the Escrow Fund Act and assessed a civil penalty of\r\n  $307,630.08.Â  The court also prohibited Sumatra from selling cigarettes to South Carolina consumers for a period of two years.Â  Finally, the court ordered Sumatra to pay attorney fees of $7,875.00 and filing fees of $95.00.Â  Sumatra appeals both\r\n  the 2003 and 2006 orders.\r\nFACTS\r\nUnder\r\n  the Master Settlement Agreement, a group of United States-based tobacco product\r\n  manufacturers agreed to pay money damages to the participating states,\r\n  including South Carolina, for Medicare and Medicaid costs incurred by the\r\n  states in paying health care expenses of in-state cigarette smokers and for\r\n  education and cessation programs.\r\n\\The South Carolina\r\n  Tobacco Escrow Fund Act requires a tobacco product manufacturer having sales of\r\n  cigarettes in this state (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer,\r\n  or similar intermediary) to:\r\n\r\n  (a) become a participating manufacturer, (as that term is\r\n    defined in section II(jj) of the Master Settlement Agreement)[1] and generally perform its financial obligations under the Master Settlement\r\n    Agreement; or\r\n  (b)(1)\r\n    place into a qualified escrow fund[2] by April 15 of the year following the year in question the following amounts\r\n    (as such amounts are adjusted for inflation)--- . . . for . . . 2001 . . .:Â \r\n    $0.136125 per unit sold . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-47-30\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  The Act defines â€œtobacco product manufacturerâ€ to include an\r\n  entity that\r\n\r\n  (1) manufactures cigarettes anywhere that such manufacturer\r\n    intends to be sold in the United States, including cigarettes intended to be\r\n    sold in the United States through an importer . . . [or]\r\n  (2) is the first purchaser anywhere for\r\n    resale in the United States of cigarettes manufactured anywhere that the\r\n    manufacturer does not intend to be sold in the United States; . . .\r\n\r\nÂ§ 11-47-20(i).\r\nSumatra is a\r\n  corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Indonesia and its\r\n  business address is located in Indonesia.Â  Sumatra produces a number of tobacco\r\n  products, including United brand cigarettes, the cigarettes at issue here.Â  Sumatra also sells its products on the Indonesian retail market.Â  Sumatra alleges it sells\r\n  tobacco products destined for non-Indonesian markets solely to UNICO Trading\r\n  Pte., Ltd. (UNICO), a Singapore corporation.Â  Sumatra alleges UNICO is not an\r\n  agent of Sumatra or a distributor of Sumatraâ€™s products, but that UNICO acts\r\n  entirely as an independent reseller.Â  Sumatra states that it and UNICO are\r\n  separate legal entities with no overlapping ownership or control and that UNICO\r\n  has no authority to bind or otherwise act on Sumatraâ€™s behalf.\r\nSumatra admits that\r\n  UNICO may have sold cigarettes produced by Sumatra to Silmar Trading Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation.Â  Sumatra states it does not have any contractual\r\n  relationship with Silmar Trading to sell its cigarettes in South Carolina.Â \r\n  Sumatra states that Silmar Trading may have engaged American Automotive\r\n  Security Products, d/b/a F.T.S. Distributors (FTS), a United States importer based in Miami, Florida, for the purpose of selling tobacco products produced\r\n  by Sumatra in the United States.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Did the circuit court err by\r\n  denying Sumatra&rsquo;s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal\r\n  jurisdiction?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the circuit court err by\r\n  granting summary judgment to the State?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Personal jurisdiction\r\nSumatra argues that, when determining whether personal\r\n  jurisdiction exists, the court erred by relying on an affidavit of Basil E.\r\n  Battah, the president of FTS.Â  Sumatra claims the affidavit is not\r\n  authenticated; however, this argument is not preserved for review.Â  At the 2003\r\n  hearing, Sumatra objected to the introduction of the affidavit on the grounds\r\n  of irrelevance and hearsay.Â  Sumatra merely mentioned the affidavit was not\r\n  authenticated.Â  Sumatra did not raise this issue in any of its submissions to\r\n  the lower court including the motion for reconsideration of the personal\r\n  jurisdiction order.Â  In fact, Sumatra previously used the Battah affidavit in\r\n  making its argument on the merits that Sumatra was not shipping to a United States distributor.Â  Therefore, Sumatraâ€™s arguments regarding the authentication of\r\n  the Battah affidavit and its arguments regarding the alleged facial defects of\r\n  the document are not preserved for the Courtâ€™s review.Â  See Holy Loch\r\n  Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock,&nbsp;340 S.C. 20, 531 S.E.2d 282&nbsp;(2000)\r\n  (to preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the trial court).Â  Given the authentication argument is not\r\n  preserved, the fact the Battah affidavit is a duplicate rather than the\r\n  original is of no moment.[3]Â  See Rule 1003, SCRE (a duplicate is admissible to same extent as an\r\n  original unless (1) a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the\r\n  original or (2) in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit the duplicate\r\n  in lieu of the original).\r\nSumatra argues the\r\n  court erred by denying Sumatraâ€™s motion to dismiss for lack of personal\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  The court found that the connections of Sumatraâ€™s cigarettes,\r\n  known as the United brand, to the United States are numerous.Â  The court cited\r\n  to Sumatraâ€™s admission that it manufactured the United brand and owned the United States trademark for it in 2001.Â  The court noted the bill of lading attached to the\r\n  Battah affidavit which showed a shipment of over 91,000 pounds of Sumatra\r\n  cigarettes to the United States to FTS in December 2000.Â  The court noted the\r\n  Department of Revenue reports that 6,868,000 United brand cigarettes were sold\r\n  in 2001, including those shipped by FTS.Â  The court further noted that Sumatra had filed an ingredient report with the Center for Disease Control.\r\nThe 2003 court found the allegations in the complaint\r\n  that Sumatra intended to sell cigarettes in the United States are amply\r\n  sufficient to make the prima facie showing for jurisdiction due to the large\r\n  volume of Sumatraâ€™s sales in South Carolina.Â  The court pointed out that\r\n  Sumatra acknowledged that its ownership of the trademark for United brand\r\n  cigarettes could be construed as an indication that Sumatra itself has the\r\n  intent to sell this brand in the United States.\r\nThe 2003 court found\r\n  that personal jurisdiction was properly asserted over Sumatra because the\r\n  requirements of due process are met, i.e. there are sufficient minimum\r\n  contacts by Sumatra with South Carolina such that the court has the power to\r\n  adjudicate the action and the exercise of jurisdiction is fair.Â  The court\r\n  stated that Sumatraâ€™s conduct has demonstrated its intent to avail itself of\r\n  the vast, lucrative markets of each state in the United States.\r\nThe question of\r\n  personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is one which must be\r\n  resolved upon the facts of each particular case.Â  Cockrell v. Hillerich\r\n  &amp; Bradsby Co., 363 S.C. 485, 611 S.E.2d 505 (2005).Â  The decision of\r\n  the trial court will be affirmed unless unsupported by the evidence or\r\n  influenced by an error of law.Â  Id.\r\nInitially, the\r\n  court properly found that the allegations in the complaint that Sumatra\r\n  intended to sell its United brand cigarettes in South Carolina were sufficient\r\n  to make the prima facie showing for personal jurisdiction.Â  See Cockrell, supra (at the pretrial stage, the burden of proving personal\r\n  jurisdiction over a nonresident is met by a prima facie showing of jurisdiction\r\n  in the complaint or in the affidavit); Mid-State Distribs., Inc. v. Century\r\n  Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 426 S.E.2d 777 (1993) (there is no â€œother\r\n  evidenceâ€ requirement for personal jurisdiction where the complaint itself\r\n  demonstrates jurisdiction).Â  While the 2003 court could have stopped its\r\n  analysis there, it chose to proceed with the more in-depth determination of\r\n  personal jurisdiction.Â  The 2006 court found that Sumatra had not offered any reason\r\n  for a different conclusion regarding personal jurisdiction on summary judgment.\r\nSpecific\r\n  jurisdiction over a cause of action arising from a defendantâ€™s contacts with\r\n  the state is granted pursuant to the long-arm statute.Â  Cockrell, supra (citing S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803).Â  In the instant case, S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  36-2-803(1)(h) (2003)[4] applies to the facts of this case and states that a court may exercise personal\r\n  jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent as to a cause of\r\n  action arising from the personâ€™s production, manufacture, or distribution of\r\n  goods with the reasonable expectation that those goods are to be used or\r\n  consumed in this State and are so used and consumed.Â  South Carolinaâ€™s long-arm\r\n  statute has been construed to extend to the outer limits of the due process\r\n  clause.Â  Id.Â  Because South Carolina treats its long-arm statute as\r\n  coextensive with the due process clause, the sole question becomes whether the\r\n  exercise of personal jurisdiction would violate due process.Â  Id.\r\nDue process requires that there exist minimum contacts\r\n  between the defendant and the forum state such that maintenance of the suit\r\n  does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.Â  Id. (citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462 (1985)). Â Further,\r\n  due process mandates that the defendant possess sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state, so that\r\n  he could reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.Â  Id. (citing World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286\r\n  (1980).Â  Without minimum contacts, the court does not have the â€œpowerâ€ to\r\n  adjudicate the action.Â  Id. Â The court must also find that the\r\n  exercise of jurisdiction is â€œreasonableâ€ or â€œfair.â€Â  Id.Â  If either\r\n  prong fails, the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendant fails to\r\n  comport with the requirements of due process.Â  Southern Plastics Co. v.\r\n  Southern Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 423 S.E.2d 128 (1992).\r\nThe\r\n  foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere\r\n  likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum state.Â  Rather, it\r\n  is that the defendantâ€™s conduct and connection with the forum state are such\r\n  that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.Â  This theory\r\n  of personal jurisdiction is known as the â€œstream of commerceâ€ theory.[5]Â  Southern Plastics Co., supra (citing World-Wide Volkswagen\r\n  Corp., 444 U.S. at 297).\r\nWhile it is true\r\n  Sumatra is not registered to do business in South Carolina, has no office in South Carolina, and no person representing Sumatra has been in South Carolina, physical\r\n  presence in the State is not required to establish personal jurisdiction.Â  See Southern Plastics Co., supra.Â  The dispositive issue is whether\r\n  Sumatra possesses minimum contacts with South Carolina.\r\nIt is clear Sumatra\r\n  has minimum contacts with the United States as a whole and, via the stream of\r\n  commerce theory, the State has shown Sumatra has minimum contacts with South Carolina.Â  The facts pointing to minimum contacts are as follows:Â  (1) Sumatra admits\r\n  it manufactured the United brand cigarettes; (2) Sumatra admits it owns the\r\n  United States trademark for that brand; (3) the Department of Revenue states\r\n  6,868,000 United brand cigarettes were sold in South Carolina in 2001; (4)\r\n  Sumatra, either on its own or by someone else on its behalf, filed an\r\n  ingredient report for the United brand cigarettes with the Center for Disease\r\n  Control; (5) Sumatra admits it packaged its cigarettes in packs and cartons\r\n  which bear the United States-required health warnings; and (6) the United brand\r\n  packaging identifies the cigarettes as an â€œAmerican blend,â€ has a Surgeon\r\n  Generalâ€™s warning, and shows an eagle and striped packaging.Â  Regardless of how\r\n  the cigarettes arrived in South Carolina, minimum contacts are established by\r\n  the above information.Â  Sumatraâ€™s actions indicate that it purposely availed\r\n  itself of conducting business in all 50 states, including South Carolina.Â  It is\r\n  troubling that Sumatra insists it could engage in the activities listed above but\r\n  avoid paying into state escrow accounts and avoid suit in each and every state\r\n  of the nation by asserting the lack of personal jurisdiction in each state.Â  We\r\n  find Sumatra should have reasonably anticipated that it would be haled into\r\n  court in a state such as South Carolina.[6]\r\n While there are\r\n  sufficient minimum contacts such that the court has the â€œpowerâ€ to adjudicate\r\n  the action, it must also be determined whether the exercise of jurisdiction is\r\n  â€œreasonableâ€ or â€œfair.â€Â  Cockrell, supra.Â  Under the fairness\r\n  prong, the court must consider:Â  (1) the duration of the activity of the\r\n  nonresident within the state; (2) the character and circumstances of the\r\n  commission of the nonresidentâ€™s acts; (3) the inconvenience resulting to the\r\n  parties by conferring or refusing to confer jurisdiction over the nonresident;\r\n  and (4) the Stateâ€™s interest in exercising jurisdiction.Â  Id.\r\nThe exercise of\r\n  jurisdiction over Sumatra is reasonable and fair.Â  While it may be inconvenient\r\n  for Sumatra to travel to the United States to defend the action against it, the\r\n  Stateâ€™s interest in exercising jurisdiction outweighs any such inconvenience.Â  The\r\n  State has a valid interest in protecting itself against any suits that arise\r\n  from a person smoking the United brand of cigarettes.Â  Given the volume of\r\n  those cigarettes sold within South Carolina, it is reasonable for Sumatra to be\r\n  haled into a South Carolina court.\r\nThe State has shown\r\n  that the court has the power to adjudicate the action and that it is reasonable\r\n  to exercise jurisdiction. Â Therefore, the exercise of jurisdiction over Sumatra does not offend due process.Â  Accordingly, the lower court properly found it could\r\n  exercise personal jurisdiction over Sumatra.\r\nII. Summary judgment\r\nSumatra argues the court erred by granting summary judgment\r\n  to the State and denying its cross-motion for summary judgment.\r\nThe lower court, in\r\n  its 2006 order, found that Sumatra is a tobacco product manufacturer under the\r\n  Escrow Fund Act.Â  The court noted that Sumatra admitted it is a manufacturer\r\n  and that it did not contest that its cigarettes were sold in South Carolina.Â \r\n  The court stated that the only question was whether Sumatra intended that the\r\n  cigarettes it manufactured be sold in the United States and that this question\r\n  was answered by several undisputed facts:Â  (1) Sumatraâ€™s acknowledgement that\r\n  it manufactures the United brand; (2) Sumatraâ€™s acknowledgement that its United\r\n  States trademark for the brand may indicate an intent to sell in the United\r\n  States; (3) the Department of Revenueâ€™s reports that almost seven million\r\n  United brand cigarettes were sold in South Carolina in 2001; (4) Sumatraâ€™s\r\n  packaging for United brand identifies it as an â€œAmerican blend;â€ and (5) the\r\n  Center for Disease Controlâ€™s ingredient reporting compliance list showing that\r\n  an ingredient list was submitted for Sumatra.Â  The court noted that these\r\n  factors, even without the bill of lading attached to the Battah affidavit, are\r\n  sufficient to conclude Sumatra is a â€œtobacco product manufacturerâ€ within the\r\n  meaning of Â§ 11-47-20(i)(1).\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court properly granted the Stateâ€™s motion for summary judgment\r\n  and ordered Sumatra to make payments pursuant to the Escrow Fund Act because\r\n  the above undisputed facts cited by the trial court establish Sumatraâ€™s intent to\r\n  sell its cigarettes in South Carolina as required by the Escrow Fund Act.[7]Â  See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions,\r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\n  affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\r\n  and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of lawâ€).Â \r\n  Accordingly, the decisions of the lower court are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J., and\r\n  Acting Justices J. Michelle Childs and John W. Kittredge, concur. Acting\r\n  Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., not participating.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]See Â§ 11-47-20(e) (Supp. 2007).\r\n[2]See Â§ 11-47-20(f) (Supp. 2007). \r\n[3]Sumatra further argues\r\n  the Battah affidavit is inadmissible hearsay.Â  However, Sumatra does not point\r\n  to any particular statement within the affidavit that would not be admissible\r\n  in evidence; therefore, this argument is deemed abandoned.Â  See Colleton\r\n  County Taxpayers Assâ€™n v. School Dist. of Colleton County, 371 S.C. 224,\r\n  638 S.E.2d 685&nbsp;(2006) (issue is deemed abandoned if the argument in the\r\n  brief is conclusory).\r\n[4]S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803 has since been amended. The subsection has not been\r\n  changed; however, the previous statute applies because the new statute is\r\n  applicable only to causes of action arising after July 1, 2005. \r\n[5]Sumatra contends this\r\n  Court should embrace the â€œstream of commerce plusâ€ theory of personal\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  This theory arose in a plurality opinion by Justice Sandra Day\r\n  Oâ€™Connor of the United States Supreme Court in Asahi Metal Ind. Co., Ltd. v.\r\n  Superior Court of California, 480 U.S. 102 (1987).Â  The â€œstream of commerce\r\n  plusâ€ theory states that the placement of a product into the stream of\r\n  commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposely directed\r\n  toward the forum state.Â  The theory maintains that additional conduct\r\n  indicating an intent or purpose to serve the market in the forum state is also\r\n  necessary.Â  Asahi, 480 U.S. at 112.Â  Only three other justices signed\r\n  onto this theory.Â  Justice William Brennan and three other justices maintained\r\n  that simply placing a product into the stream of commerce is consistent with\r\n  the Due Process Clause and they would not require a showing of additional\r\n  conduct to assert jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 117.Â  We, therefore, decline to\r\n  embrace the â€œstream of commerce plusâ€ theory.\r\n[6]See State\r\n  v. Grand Tobacco, 871 N.E.2d 1255 (Ohio Ct. App.), appeal not allowed, 868\r\n  N.E.2d 680 (Ohio 2007) (finding a foreign tobacco product manufacturer has\r\n  sufficient minimum contacts with Ohio such that the state can exercise personal\r\n  jurisdiction over the company; noting that over 25 million units of Grand\r\n  Tobaccoâ€™s products were sold in Ohio from 2000 to 2003; and that Grand Tobacco\r\n  took steps within the United States to trademark its products, to comply with\r\n  federal regulations for the sale of cigarettes by submitting ingredient lists\r\n  to the Center for Disease Control, and to distribute its products; it had\r\n  purposely availed itself of conducting business in all 50 states, including\r\n  Ohio).\r\n[7]Sumatra\r\n  argues the Escrow Fund Act violates the takings provision of the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution and that the Act, as applied to Sumatra, violates antitrust laws.Â \r\n  The trial court found that these arguments were not before the court because\r\n  they were not raised in Sumatraâ€™s answer.Â  The court also denied the motion to\r\n  amend the answer because Sumatra filed the motion to amend after the motion for\r\n  summary judgment was filed and over two years after Sumatra had filed its answer.Â \r\n  Sumatra does not appeal the denial of the motion to amend.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  whether the motion to amend was properly denied is not preserved for the\r\n  Courtâ€™s review and thus the takings and price-fixing arguments are not before\r\n  the Court.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR; Jinks v. Richland County,\r\n  355 S.C. 341, 585 S.E.2d 281 (2003) (issue not argued in the brief is deemed\r\n  abandoned and precludes consideration on appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26523","title":"Miller v.

Â This Court granted certiorari to review the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  decision.Â  Because Millerâ€™s sole defense was mistaken identity and third-party\r\n  guilt, we conclude there is no probative evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding trial counselâ€™s\r\n  effectiveness.Â  Therefore, we reverse the decision of the PCR court and grant\r\n  Miller relief with respect to his armed robbery conviction.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nAround\r\n  9:00 a.m. on December 9, 2001, James Holden stopped by the Liâ€™l Cricket\r\n  convenience store on White Horse Road in Greenville to use the pay phone.Â  As\r\n  Holden was getting back into his truck, he was approached by an\r\n  African-American male asking for directions to Interstate 85.Â  After Holden\r\n  motioned in the direction of I-85, the man pointed a gun at him and demanded\r\n  his wallet.Â  When the man realized that Holden did not have any money in his\r\n  wallet, he ordered Holden to empty his pockets.Â  Holden then turned over $106\r\n  in cash.Â  According to Holden, the man took the money and drove off in a â€œbluish\r\n  purpleâ€ colored vehicle.Â  Holden followed the vehicle until the man pulled into\r\n  a nearby apartment complex.Â  During the pursuit, Holden was able to take down\r\n  the license plate number.\r\nHolden returned to\r\n  the convenience store and called police to report the robbery.Â  Stacy Snider, a\r\n  deputy with the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department, responded to the\r\n  scene.Â  Holden described the suspect as a medium build, five-foot-ten inch, 170\r\n  pound African-American male with a â€œFu Manchu mustache,â€ similar to a goatee.Â \r\n  In terms of clothing, Holden claimed the suspect was wearing a white ski hat, a\r\n  black nylon jacket, a black shirt, dark pants, and dark tennis shoes.Â  He\r\n  further stated the suspect was wearing â€œa necklace or a gold braid or something\r\n  made into the shirt.â€Â  Holden also described the suspectâ€™s vehicle and gave the\r\n  license plate number to Deputy Snider. Â Using this information, Deputy Snider\r\n  determined that the vehicle, a Kia Sephia, was registered to Stephanie Pauling. \r\nOn December 12,\r\n  2001, Antonio Bailey, an investigator with the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Department, continued the investigation by contacting Holden.Â  Based on\r\n  Holdenâ€™s written statement and the vehicle registration, Investigator Bailey\r\n  interviewed Stephanie Pauling, Millerâ€™s then girlfriend, and her aunt, Brenda\r\n  Johnson, who lived at the address where the vehicle had been registered.Â  As a\r\n  result of this investigation, Investigator Bailey compiled a photographic\r\n  lineup and presented it to Holden on December 18, 2001.Â  At that time, Holden\r\n  selected Millerâ€™s photograph and positively identified him as the man who had\r\n  robbed him.Â  The next day, Investigator Bailey arrested Miller.Â  The Greenville County jail intake form listed Miller as five-feet-eight inches tall and\r\n  weighing 130 pounds.Â  Â \r\nAfter a Greenville County grand jury indicted him, Miller was tried for armed robbery.Â  In addition\r\n  to Holden and the investigating officers, the State presented Stephanie Pauling\r\n  as its primary witness to establish that Miller had access to her vehicle at\r\n  the time of the armed robbery.Â  Pauling testified she began dating Miller in\r\n  September 2001 and eventually moved in with him.Â  She claimed that Miller often\r\n  borrowed her car and that he drove off in the vehicle on December 2, 2001.Â \r\n  According to Pauling, she did not see Miller until one week later.Â  At that\r\n  time, Miller told her that she could find her car on Poinsette Highway where he\r\n  had left it.Â  Because Miller claimed he had lost her car keys, Pauling arranged\r\n  to meet with her aunt, Brenda Johnson, who gave her the spare set of car keys\r\n  in order that she could retrieve the car. Â When questioned about the specifics\r\n  of the armed robbery, Pauling testified that Miller owned a handgun and that Miller\r\n  was wearing a gold medallion on the day of the robbery. \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, Millerâ€™s trial counsel brought out that Pauling was\r\n  currently charged with three armed robberies in Greenville.Â  With respect to\r\n  one of these robberies, Pauling admitted that she initially implicated Miller,\r\n  but ultimately changed her statement and identified Derrick Miller, Bruce Millerâ€™s\r\n  nephew, as a participant.Â  During this portion of cross-examination, the State\r\n  objected as trial counsel began to question Pauling about Derrick Miller and\r\n  his involvement in the robberies.Â  Outside the presence of the jury, trial counsel\r\n  inquired whether he would be permitted to question Pauling regarding the\r\n  specifics of her three armed robbery charges in an attempt to establish that Derrick\r\n  Miller, not Bruce Miller, was the person who robbed Holden.Â  The trial judge\r\n  sustained the Stateâ€™s objection and trial counsel concluded his\r\n  cross-examination of Pauling.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the bench conference, trial counsel proffered his cross-examination of\r\n  Pauling.Â  During the proffer, Pauling testified that Derrick Miller was a\r\n  co-defendant in all three armed robberies with which she had been charged.Â  She\r\n  also described Derrick Miller as an African-American male, who was\r\n  approximately five-feet-seven inches tall, weighed 170 pounds, and had facial\r\n  hair over his lip and under his chin.Â  At the conclusion of the proffer, trial\r\n  counsel contended this testimony was relevant as evidence of third-party\r\n  guilt.Â  Specifically, he stated that he wanted to establish before the jury\r\n  that another individual with similar physical characteristics to Bruce Miller\r\n  had access to Paulingâ€™s vehicle and had been involved in recent armed robberies\r\n  in Greenville using the same vehicle during the same time period.Â  The trial\r\n  judge then permitted trial counsel to recall Pauling and question her again\r\n  outside the presence of the jury.Â  During this second proffer, Pauling\r\n  acknowledged that her car was used during each of the three robberies for which\r\n  she and Derrick Miller were charged as well as the one for which Bruce Miller\r\n  was charged.\r\nAfter denying\r\n  Millerâ€™s motion for a directed verdict and a brief recess, the trial judge\r\n  returned to the courtroom and informed the attorneys that he had reversed his earlier\r\n  ruling.Â  The judge stated that he would permit Millerâ€™s counsel to question\r\n  Pauling regarding Derrick Millerâ€™s physical characteristics and that Pauling\r\n  would be â€œtestifying consistent with the proffer.â€\r\nDuring\r\n  her cross-examination before the jury, Pauling described Derrick Miller as an\r\n  African-American male who was approximately five-feet-seven inches tall and\r\n  weighed 170 pounds.Â  She also acknowledged that he has a â€œFu Manchu mustache.â€ Â In\r\n  reply, the State recalled Holden as a witness who again positively identified Bruce\r\n  Miller as the man who robbed him. \r\nMiller did not\r\n  testify or present any witnesses on his behalf.Â  After the jury convicted him\r\n  of armed robbery, the trial judge sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment.Â  \r\nMiller appealed\r\n  his conviction to the Court of Appeals.Â  After the Court of Appeals affirmed\r\n  his conviction,[1] Miller filed an application for post-conviction relief.Â  The State filed a\r\n  return and requested an evidentiary hearing.Â  \r\nAt the hearing,\r\n  Millerâ€™s PCR counsel called Bruce Miller and trial counsel as witnesses.Â  Miller\r\n  maintained that his nephew, Derrick Miller, committed the armed robbery for\r\n  which he was charged.Â  Miller claimed his trial counsel was ineffective in that\r\n  he failed to:Â  (1) obtain an expert witness on eyewitness identification\r\n  testimony; and (2) adequately present the third-party guilt of his nephew, Derrick\r\n  Miller.Â  In terms of third-party guilt, Miller believed that trial counsel\r\n  should have established that his nephew had similar physical features and had\r\n  been charged with three armed robberies in Greenville that occurred around the\r\n  time Holden was robbed.Â  Additionally, Miller claimed that Derrick used\r\n  Paulingâ€™s vehicle and owned a handgun similar to the one that Holden claimed to\r\n  have seen during the robbery. \r\nTrial counsel\r\n  admitted that he erred in failing to bring out through Paulingâ€™s\r\n  cross-examination that her car was used and a similar handgun was used in the\r\n  robbery of Holden as well as the other three armed robberies for which she and Derrick\r\n  Miller were charged.Â  Because Millerâ€™s sole defense was misidentification and\r\n  third-party guilt, trial counsel conceded that he â€œmissed [his] opportunityâ€\r\n  during Paulingâ€™s testimony to specifically tie in the gun and vehicle used in\r\n  all of the robberies.Â  By means of explanation, trial counsel stated he was\r\n  remiss in not connecting the handgun and Paulingâ€™s vehicle because he was\r\n  caught off guard when the trial judge reversed his initial ruling.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion\r\n  of the hearing, the PCR court denied Millerâ€™s application for post-conviction\r\n  relief.Â  Although he acknowledged that it was a â€œclose case,â€ the court found\r\n  Miller did not meet his burden of proof to warrant relief.Â  In a written order,\r\n  the PCR court affirmed his oral ruling and dismissed Millerâ€™s application.Â \r\n  Specifically, the court held that Miller did not meet his burden of\r\n  establishing error or prejudice regarding how trial counsel failed to\r\n  effectively handle the following issues:Â  (1) eyewitness identification; and\r\n  (2) third-party guilt.Â  In terms of third-party guilt, the court found that\r\n  â€œtrial counsel was allowed to present a third party guilt defense at trial.Â \r\n  This Court finds that trial counselâ€™s hindsight admission regarding his failure\r\n  to ask Pauling (during the second cross-examination) about the similar car and\r\n  gun does [not] operate to satisfy the Applicantâ€™s burden of proving error.â€\r\nThis Court granted\r\n  Millerâ€™s petition for certiorari to review the PCR courtâ€™s denial of his application\r\n  for post-conviction relief.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMiller\r\n  asserts the PCR court erred in failing to find trial counsel was ineffective in\r\n  not cross-examining Stephanie Pauling regarding similar armed robberies\r\n  allegedly committed by Derrick Miller.Â  Because his entire defense rested on\r\n  mistaken identity and third-party guilt,[2] Miller contends his counselâ€™s ineffectiveness was prejudicial and\r\n  warranted a reversal of his conviction.Â  We agree.\r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate\r\n  assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all\r\n  significant decisions in the case.â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331,\r\n  642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007).Â Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is\r\n  entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the PCR\r\n  applicant must show that: (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2)\r\n  there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of\r\n  the trial would have been different.Â  Id. (citing Strickland v.\r\n    Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a\r\n  probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.â€Â  Ard,\r\n  372 S.C. at 331, 642 S.E.2d at 596. â€œFurthermore, when a defendantâ€™s conviction\r\n  is challenged, â€˜the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that,\r\n  absent the errors, the fact finder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting\r\n  guilt.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 695 (1984)).\r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C.\r\n  365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  We will uphold the findings of the PCR court when there is\r\n  any evidence of probative value to support them. Â Suber v. State, 371\r\n  S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007). Â However, this Court will\r\n  reverse if there is no probative evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s findings or the decision is controlled by an\r\n  error of law. Â Id.; Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).\r\nAlthough\r\n  we are cognizant of our deferential standard of review, we find there is no\r\n  probative evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law regarding trial counselâ€™s effectiveness.Â  We believe the record established\r\n  that trial counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that, but for counselâ€™s\r\n  error, there was a reasonable probability that the result of Millerâ€™s trial would\r\n  have been different.Â  Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State established the charge of armed robbery against Bruce Miller based on a\r\n  single eyewitness.Â  Both trial counsel and Miller maintained that the defense\r\n  theory was misidentification and third-party guilt.Â  In terms of\r\n  misidentification, trial counsel failed to call an expert witness to testify\r\n  regarding eyewitness identification testimony.Â  Thus, the key defense was\r\n  third-party guilt.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  view of this limited defense, it was crucial for trial counsel to elicit\r\n  testimony from Pauling that showed the similarities between the armed robberies\r\n  for which she and Derrick Miller were charged and the one for which Bruce Miller\r\n  was charged.Â  Based on the proffer of Paulingâ€™s testimony and the transcript\r\n  from the PCR hearing, it is clear that trial counsel could have established Derrick\r\n  Millerâ€™s third-party guilt by showing that Paulingâ€™s vehicle was used as the\r\n  â€œget awayâ€ car in each of the robberies and that a similar handgun was used.Â  Â \r\nAlthough\r\n  trial counsel, through Paulingâ€™s testimony, was able to establish a physical description\r\n  of Derrick Miller, this was not sufficient to adequately establish a defense of\r\n  third-party guilt.Â  A review of Holdenâ€™s testimony reveals that he described\r\n  the robber as an African-American male who was approximately five-feet-ten\r\n  inches tall and weighed 170 pounds.Â  He also described the robberâ€™s facial hair\r\n  as a â€œFu Manchu mustacheâ€ or â€œgoatee.â€Â  Significantly, this description is akin\r\n  to Derrick Millerâ€™s physical features rather than Bruce Millerâ€™s. Â Additionally,\r\n  Paulingâ€™s credibility was questionable at best given she initially implicated Bruce\r\n  Miller in one of the other three armed robberies until she became aware that he\r\n  could not have been involved because he was in jail at the time of the crime.Â \r\n  Inferentially, Pauling could have been â€œcoveringâ€ for Derrick Miller for\r\n  Holdenâ€™s armed robbery as she did when she falsely identified Bruce Miller in\r\n  another robbery.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  trial counsel conceded he was remiss in failing to adequately cross-examine\r\n  Pauling regarding the specifics of the other armed robberies. Counsel attempted\r\n  to elicit specific testimony of third-party guilt during the proffer of\r\n  Paulingâ€™s testimony; however, he failed to do so in front of the jury when\r\n  given an opportunity by the trial judge to question her further regarding the\r\n  use of her car and a similar gun during the charged robberies.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we conclude the record is devoid of any probative evidence to\r\n  support the PCR courtâ€™s decision to dismiss Millerâ€™s application.Â  Clearly,\r\n  both the trial judge and the PCR court recognized there was evidence of\r\n  third-party guilt.Â  Specifically, the trial judge gave trial counsel the\r\n  opportunity to establish this defense before the jury.Â  Moreover, the PCR court\r\n  found that â€œtrial counsel clearly pursued the defense of third-party guilt at\r\n  trial.â€ Â Yet, the evidence established that counsel was deficient in adequately\r\n  cross-examining Pauling regarding the specifics of the other three armed\r\n  robberies for which she and Derrick Miller were charged as well as pointing out\r\n  that Derrick Millerâ€™s physical features were similar to the robber as described\r\n  by Holden.Â  Because Millerâ€™s sole defense was mistaken identity and third-party\r\n  guilt, he was prejudiced by trial counselâ€™s error and entitled to\r\n  post-conviction relief.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision and\r\n  grant relief as to Millerâ€™s armed robbery conviction.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.Â \r\n  Â \r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ.,\r\n  concur.

PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I join in Justice\r\n  Pleiconesâ€™ dissent.Â  In my opinion, this evidence does not meet the threshold\r\n  for third-party guilt.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  my view, testimony that Pauling and Derrick Miller committed other robberies\r\n  using Paulingâ€™s vehicle and that a similar gun was used in all four robberies\r\n  is not evidence that is inconsistent with Petitionerâ€™s guilt.Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 317, 513 S.E.2d 606, 614 (1999) (recognizing that third-party guilt evidence is limited to facts\r\n  which are inconsistent with the defendantâ€™s guilt).Â \r\n  Furthermore, I agree with Justice Pleicones that Petitioner failed to show he\r\n  was prejudiced by trial counselâ€™s alleged failure to adequately present this\r\n  evidence.Â  The jury heard testimony from Pauling that she pled guilty to an\r\n  armed robbery that she committed with Derrick Miller in which she drove the\r\n  â€œget-awayâ€ vehicle.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  in my view, Petitioner failed to show trial counsel was ineffective in failing\r\n  to call an expert on witness identification.Â  Petitioner did not offer any such\r\n  expert at his PCR hearing, and thus, he failed to meet his burden of proving\r\n  prejudice.Â  See Lorenzen v. State, 376\r\n  S.C. 521, 530, 657 S.E.2d 771, 776-77 (2008) (holding that the\r\n  PCR applicant failed to show he was prejudiced by trial counselâ€™s failure to\r\n  call an eyewitness identification expert because â€œit is merely speculative that\r\n  these allegedly favorable expert witnesses would have aided in\r\n  his defense.â€).Â  \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, I believe there is evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s findings,\r\n  and I would affirm the order denying Petitioner relief.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\nJ., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent and would affirm the\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR) judgeâ€™s finding that petitionerâ€™s trial counsel\r\n  was not ineffective in failing to adequately present evidence of third-party guilt.Â  E.g., Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 642 S.E.2d 590 (2007) (PCR\r\n  findings must be upheld where supported by any evidence of probative value in\r\n  the record).\r\nUnder South Carolinaâ€™s third-party guilt evidence rule:\r\n\r\n  Evidence\r\n    offered by accused as to the commission of the crime by another person must be\r\n    limited to such facts as are inconsistent with his own guilt, and to such facts\r\n    as raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to his own innocence;\r\n    evidence which can have (no) other effect that than to cast a bare suspicion\r\n    upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to the commission of the\r\n    crime by another, is not admissibleâ€¦.Â  [B]efore such testimony can be received,\r\n    there must be such proof of connection with it, such a train of facts or circumstances,\r\n    as tends clearly to point out such other person as the guilty party.Â  State\r\n      v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98 at 104-105, 16 S.E.2d 532 at 534-535 (1941)\r\n    (quoting 16 C.J., Criminal Law Â§ 1085, p. 560 (1918) and 20 Am.Jur., Evidence Â§\r\n    265, p. 254 (1939); footnotes omitted).\r\n  Cited\r\n    in Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319, 328 (2006).[3]\r\n\r\nAt the outset, I must express\r\n  reservations whether the third-party guilt evidence proffered by petitioner at\r\n  trial met the threshold for admissibility.Â  In my view, Stephanie Paulingâ€™s\r\n  testimony did little more than raise a conjectural inference that Derrick\r\n  Miller, rather than petitioner, may have robbed James Holder.Â  State v.\r\n    Gregory, supra.\r\nIn any case, there\r\n  is evidence in the record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that trial counsel\r\n  was not deficient in casting suspicion on Derrick through his cross-examination\r\n  of Pauling.Â  The majority points to two facts which trial counsel failed to\r\n  elicit to find trial counsel ineffective: 1) that Paulingâ€™s car was used in her\r\n  and Derrickâ€™s armed robberies and 2) that a similar gun was used in all four\r\n  robberies.Â  In my view, trial counselâ€™s failure to cross-examine Pauling about\r\n  these two â€œsimilaritiesâ€ was not deficient nor was petitioner prejudiced\r\n  thereby.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 460 U.S. 668 (1984) (defendant\r\n  alleging trial counsel was ineffective must establish both deficient\r\n  performance and resulting prejudice).\r\nIt appears that\r\n  Pauling testified for the State in petitionerâ€™s trial as part of an\r\n  understanding that, following her testimony, she was to be permitted to plead\r\n  down her three armed robbery charges to three counts of accessory after the\r\n  fact.Â  In those three cases, Pauling was alleged to have been the getaway car\r\n  driver while two codefendants (one Derrick) robbed or attempted to rob\r\n  convenience stores and a fast food restaurant.Â  While Pauling did not\r\n  explicitly testify that she was driving her car during these three crimes,\r\n  there was no suggestion that she was driving any other vehicle.[4]Â \r\n  The testimony focused on only this automobile, as did the attorneysâ€™ closing\r\n  arguments.Â  In my opinion, trial counselâ€™s failure to specifically question\r\n  Pauling about the car used in the armed robberies in which she was the getaway\r\n  driver was not deficient, nor was petitioner prejudiced by this omission since\r\n  it was clear to the jury that the same car was involved in all four incidents.Â  Strickland v. Washington, supra.\r\nThe majority also\r\n  holds trial counselâ€™s failure to exploit the similarities between the gun used\r\n  to rob Holder and the gun used in the three other armed robberies was\r\n  ineffective.Â  During her in camera trial testimony, however, Pauling\r\n  stated that the gun used in the robberies in which she participated â€œdidnâ€™t\r\n  look like the other one.â€Â  In my opinion, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective\r\n  for failing to present evidence at trial through Pauling of the gunsâ€™\r\n  similarities.\r\nHaving concluded\r\n  that there is evidence of probative value in the record which supports the\r\n  findings of the PCR judge, I would affirm the order denying petitioner a new\r\n  trial.Â  Ard v. Catoe, supra.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  State v. Miller, Op. No. 2004-UP-620 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 13, 2004).\r\n[2]Â Â  In terms of third-party guilt, this\r\n  Court has imposed strict limitations on its admissibility. Â State\r\n    v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 81, 538 S.E.2d 257, 265 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  â€œEvidence offered by a defendant as to the commission of the crime by another\r\n  person is limited to facts which are inconsistent with the defendantâ€™s guilt.â€ Id.Â  â€œThe evidence must raise a reasonable inference as to the accusedâ€™s\r\n  innocence.â€Â  Id.Â  Recently, after Millerâ€™s\r\n  trial, our United States Supreme Court clarified the above-outlined rule\r\n  regarding the admission of third-party guilt in Holmes v. South Carolina,\r\n  547 U.S. 319 (2006).Â  Holmes essentially permits a defendant to\r\n  introduce evidence of third-party guilt regardless of the strength of the\r\n  Stateâ€™s case if the evidence offered by the accused as to the commission of the\r\n  crime by another person is limited to such facts as are inconsistent with his\r\n  own guilt and that raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to his own\r\n  innocence.Â  Holmes, 547 U.S. at 328-29.\r\n[3] In Holmes, the United State Supreme Court\r\n  found unconstitutional a variant of South Carolinaâ€™s third-party guilt rule\r\n  which permitted strong evidence of guilt (especially forensic) to trump the\r\ndefendantâ€™s right to present third-party guilt evidence.\r\n[4] This is especially so in light of Paulingâ€™s\r\n  testimony that only she, her aunt, and petitioner were permitted to drive the\r\n  car, and evidence that her participation in the three robberies was motivated,\r\n  at least in part, by the fact she had just lost her job and was unable to make\r\nher car payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26524","title":"In the Matter of Beaufort County Magistrate George Peter Lamb","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26524","description":"In this opinion, the Court issues a public reprimand for acts of misconduct by a magistrate who has resigned his position.","date":"2008-07-28","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter\r\n          of Beaufort County Magistrate George Peter Lamb, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26524\r\n  Submitted July 22, 2008 - Filed July 28,\r\n2008\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Deborah Stroud McKeown, Commission Counsel, Â Assistant\r\n          Disciplinary Counsel Joseph P.

Â Â In\r\n  her petition, Lomaxâ€™s (Petitionerâ€™s) sole contention is that the PCR judge\r\n  erred in failing to find a conflict of interest existed when her plea counsel\r\n  simultaneously represented both Petitioner and her husband during guilty pleas\r\n  which arose out of related offenses.Â  We reverse the decision of the PCR judge.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  August 20, 1997, Petitioner distributed crack cocaine to an undercover officer\r\n  near a public park in Greenville. Â Based on this transaction, officers with the\r\n  Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department served Petitioner with two arrest\r\n  warrants for the charges of distribution of crack cocaine and distribution of\r\n  crack cocaine within a half mile of a public park.Â  The officers proceeded to\r\n  serve the warrants after they observed Petitioner drive away from her home.Â \r\n  After they stopped Petitioner, the officers arrested her and searched her\r\n  vehicle.Â  This search revealed .58 grams of cocaine and 64.79 grams of crack\r\n  cocaine.\r\nAs a result of the\r\n  vehicle search, the officers sought to procure a search warrant for Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  home.Â  While waiting for the search warrant, the officers conducted\r\n  surveillance of Petitionerâ€™s home.Â  Shortly after their arrival, the officers\r\n  observed Noah Lomax, Petitionerâ€™s husband (Husband), drive away from the\r\n  residence.Â  The officers stopped him a short distance from the residence.Â  At\r\n  that time, he consented to a search of his vehicle.Â  During their search, the\r\n  officers found 22.47 grams of cocaine, 178.11 grams of crack cocaine, $17,000\r\n  in cash, as well as seventeen clear plastic bags.\r\nSubsequently, Husband\r\n  gave a statement to the officers that he knew his wife was being arrested and\r\n  he went to their home to remove the drugs and money.Â  As a result of their\r\n  investigation, the officers executed a search warrant for the coupleâ€™s home.Â \r\n  During the search, the officers discovered quantities of marijuana, crack\r\n  cocaine, and a mixture of both drugs.Â  Additionally, they discovered $1,369 in\r\n  cash. \r\nPetitioner was\r\n  released from jail after serving nineteen days.Â  Less than a month after her\r\n  release, Petitioner distributed crack cocaine to undercover officers on three\r\n  separate occasions.Â  \r\nBased on Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  conduct, a Greenville County grand jury indicted Petitioner for the following\r\n  offenses:Â  four counts of distribution of crack cocaine; distribution of crack\r\n  cocaine within a half mile of a school or public park; trafficking in crack cocaine\r\n  in excess of 200 grams, which was later amended to an amount between 28 and 100\r\n  grams; possession with intent to distribute cocaine within proximity of a\r\n  school; trafficking in cocaine; possession with intent to distribute crack\r\n  cocaine within proximity of a school; possession with intent to distribute\r\n  marijuana; and possession with intent to distribute marijuana within proximity\r\n  of a school.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Petitioner and Husband, both represented by the same attorney, simultaneously\r\n  pled guilty.Â  The solicitor explained to\r\n  the plea judge that the State intended to present both pleas jointly given the\r\n  defendants were husband and wife and the facts giving rise to their charges\r\n  were the same.Â  After engaging in a plea colloquy with Petitioner and Husband\r\n  individually, the plea judge accepted their guilty pleas as freely and\r\n  voluntarily given and issued his respective sentences.Â  \r\nHusband\r\n  pled guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute within\r\n  proximity of a school and was sentenced to three yearsâ€™ imprisonment. Â The judge\r\n  sentenced Petitioner to concurrent terms of ten years on each count of\r\n  distribution of crack cocaine, ten years for distribution of crack cocaine\r\n  within proximity of a school, twenty-five years for trafficking in crack\r\n  cocaine, ten years for trafficking in cocaine, ten years for PWID crack cocaine\r\n  within proximity of a school, ten years for PWID cocaine within proximity of a\r\n  school, five years for PWID marijuana, and ten years for PWID marijuana within\r\n  proximity of a school.\r\nPetitioner did not\r\n  appeal her guilty plea or sentences.Â  On November 20, 1998, Petitioner filed an\r\n  application for post-conviction relief.Â  The State filed a Return and requested\r\n  an evidentiary hearing. \r\nOn\r\n  December 14, 2006, the PCR court held a hearing on petitionerâ€™s application.[1]Â  At the PCR hearing, Petitionerâ€™s PCR\r\n  counsel called Petitioner and her plea counsel as witnesses.Â  Petitioner\r\n  contended she was hurt by plea counselâ€™s representation of both her and Husband\r\n  at the plea proceeding.Â  Petitioner believed that plea counselâ€™s argument for\r\n  leniency on behalf of Husband was detrimental to her given that counsel\r\n  compared her involvement in the crimes to that of Husband.Â  Petitioner also\r\n  claimed she was prejudiced by plea counselâ€™s dual representation because plea\r\n  counsel â€œlingeredâ€ more on Husbandâ€™s case.Â  Petitioner asserted that plea\r\n  counsel should have focused more on her case because she had confessed to the\r\n  crimes and was subject to a more severe sentence.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Petitioner testified she was informed that she would be tried separately and\r\n  did not recall ever being asked whether she wanted to waive any conflict of\r\n  interest and proceed jointly with Husband.Â  Petitioner further stated that had\r\n  she known the sentence that she would receive by pleading guilty, she would\r\n  have requested a jury trial. \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, Petitioner acknowledged that when she hired plea counsel to\r\n  represent her for a bond reduction she was aware that counsel was already\r\n  representing Husband.Â  Petitioner further admitted that she agreed to have plea\r\n  counsel represent both her and Husband on the indicted offenses. \r\nPlea\r\n  counsel acknowledged she represented Petitioner and Husband on charges that\r\n  stemmed from the same incident.Â  Although plea counsel could not remember\r\n  whether she discussed the conflict of interest issue with Petitioner, she\r\n  remembered specifically talking to Husband about it.Â  Counsel also stated\r\n  neither Petitioner nor Husband voiced any objection to the dual representation,\r\n  but instead, indicated they wanted her to represent them together.\r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, plea counsel stated her standard practice was to have\r\n  clients sign a release or a waiver of a conflict of interest.Â  However, she\r\n  could not specifically recall whether Petitioner or Husband had signed such a\r\n  document.Â  Even if this document had been signed by Petitioner and Husband,\r\n  plea counsel testified she could not produce it given she had shredded the case\r\n  file years earlier. \r\nAt\r\n  the conclusion of plea counselâ€™s testimony, the PCR judge inquired whether\r\n  counsel had favored one client over the other.Â  In response, plea counsel\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n  No.Â  I\r\n    did spend a lot more time with [Husband] in the beginning because he wasâ€”I mean,\r\n    this guy had had the same job for so many years.Â  He was very close to\r\n    retirement and they had fired him.Â  So we didâ€”I spent a lot of time with him\r\n    seeing if there was anything we could do to get his job back. \r\n  As far a\r\n    favoring one over the other, I certainly did not do that.Â  I knew that\r\n    Petitioner was in more trouble.Â  I was hoping to get [Husband] extricated from\r\n    the thing altogether.Â  But, I mean, he did give a statement saying that he knew\r\n    the stuff was there and he had gone to the house to remove it.Â  And I did, on\r\n    the record, ask that his sentence be reconsidered.Â  I donâ€™t know if I,\r\n    actually, filed it.Â  But, I did ask [the plea judge] to reconsider\r\n    [Petitionerâ€™s] sentence.[2]Â  \r\n\r\nAt\r\n  the conclusion of the hearing, the PCR judge denied Petitionerâ€™s application.Â  In\r\n  reaching this decision, the PCR judge found Petitioner was not prejudiced by\r\n  plea counselâ€™s dual representation because there was â€œno actual conflict of\r\n  interest in the matter.â€Â  In his written order, the PCR judge affirmed his oral\r\n  ruling and explained his decision. Â The PCR judge prefaced his analysis with a\r\n  finding that plea counselâ€™s testimony was credible whereas Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  testimony was not credible.Â  The PCR judge went on to conclude that Petitioner\r\n  failed to meet her burden of proof that plea counsel was ineffective.Â  In\r\n  reaching this conclusion, the judge found Petitioner:Â  admitted her guilt at\r\n  the plea proceeding; acknowledged the facts presented by the solicitor;\r\n  communicated that she understood the rights she was waiving by pleading guilty;\r\n  was satisfied with plea counselâ€™s representation; and had not been coerced in\r\n  any way to plead guilty.Â  Additionally, the PCR judge specifically held that\r\n  there was no actual conflict of interest with plea counselâ€™s dual\r\n  representation of Petitioner and Husband. \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s denial of Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  application for post-conviction relief.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues the PCR judge erred in failing to find that a conflict of interest\r\n  existed when her plea counsel simultaneously represented both Petitioner and Husband\r\n  during guilty pleas which arose out of related offenses.Â  We agree.\r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered\r\n  adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making\r\n  all significant decisions in the case.â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318,\r\n  331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007).Â Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he or she is\r\n  entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  â€œIn\r\n  the context of a challenge to a guilty\r\n  plea, a PCR applicant must establish both that his plea counselâ€™s\r\n  representation was deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that\r\n  but for counselâ€™s deficient representation, the applicant would not have pled\r\n  guilty.â€Â  James v. State, 377 S.C. 81, 83-84, 659 S.E.2d 148, 149 (2008).Â  â€œIn determining guilty\r\n  plea issues, it is proper to consider the guilty plea transcript as well as\r\n  evidence at the PCR hearing.â€ Suber v. State, 371\r\n  S.C. 554, 558, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).\r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C.\r\n  365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  In reviewing the PCR courtâ€™s decision, an appellate court is concerned\r\n  only with whether any evidence of probative value exists to support that\r\n  decision.&nbsp; Smith v. State, 369 S.C. 135, 138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261\r\n  (2006).Â  This Court will uphold the findings of the PCR court when there is any\r\n  evidence of probative value to support them, and will reverse the decision of\r\n  the PCR court when it is controlled by an error&nbsp;of law.&nbsp; Suber,\r\n  371 S.C. at 558-59, 640 S.E.2d at 886.\r\nâ€œThe Sixth\r\n  Amendment right to counsel attaches upon initiation of adversarial judicial\r\n  proceedings and at all critical stages of a criminal trial.â€Â  State v. Sterling, 377 S.C. 475, 479, 661 S.E.2d 99, 101 (2008).Â  â€œTo establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to\r\n  effective counsel due to a conflict of interest arising from multiple representation,\r\n  a defendant who did not object at trial must show an actual conflict of\r\n  interest adversely affected his attorneyâ€™s performance.â€Â  Thomas v. State,\r\n  346 S.C. 140, 143, 551 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001).Â  â€œAn actual conflict of interest\r\n  occurs where an attorney owes a duty to a party whose interests are adverse to\r\n  the defendantâ€™s.â€ Staggs v. State, 372 S.C. 549, 551, 643 S.E.2d 690,\r\n  692 (2007).Â  This Court has further stated that an actual conflict of interest\r\n  occurs:\r\n\r\n  when a defense attorney places himself in a situation inherently\r\n    conducive to divided loyalties . . . . If a defense attorney owes duties to a\r\n    party whose interests are adverse to those of the defendant, then an actual\r\n    conflict exists.Â  The interests of the other client and the defendant are sufficiently\r\n    adverse if it is shown that the attorney owes a duty to the defendant to take\r\n    some action that could be detrimental to his other client.\r\n\r\nDuncan v. State, 281 S.C. 435, 438, 315 S.E.2d 809, 811\r\n  (1984) (quoting Zuck v. State of Alabama, 588 F.2d 436, 439 (5th Cir.\r\n  1979)).\r\nâ€œThe mere possibility defense counsel may have a conflict of\r\n  interest is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction.â€ Â State v. Gregory,\r\n  364 S.C. 150, 152-53, 612 S.E.2d 449, 450 (2005). Â Additionally, the fact that\r\n  counsel does not advise a defendant of the potential conflict of interest does\r\n  not affect the constitutionality of the conviction.Â  Jackson v. State,\r\n  329 S.C. 345, 355, 495 S.E.2d 768, 773 (1998).Â  Moreover, the â€œRules of\r\n  Professional Conduct have no bearing on the constitutionality of a criminal\r\n  conviction.â€Â  Langford v. State, 310 S.C. 357, 360, 426 S.E.2d 793, 795\r\n  (1993).\r\nâ€œHowever, a defendant need not demonstrate prejudice if there is\r\n  an actual conflict of interest.â€Â  Gregory, 364 S.C. at 153, 612 S.E.2d\r\n  at 450.Â  â€œâ€˜But until a defendant shows that his counsel actively represented\r\n  conflicting interests, he has not established the constitutional predicate for\r\n  his claim of ineffective assistance.â€™â€Â  Duncan, 281 S.C. at 438, 315\r\n  S.E.2d at 811 (quoting Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 350 (1980)).\r\nApplying the above-outlined analytical framework to the facts of\r\n  the instant case, we find the PCR judge erred in denying Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  application for post-conviction relief. Â As will be discussed, we hold the\r\n  PCR judge erred in failing to find that an actual conflict of interest existed,\r\n  thus rendering plea counselâ€™s representation ineffective.Â  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, both plea counsel and Petitioner testified\r\n  that counsel spent more time preparing Husbandâ€™s case despite the fact that\r\n  Petitioner was pleading guilty to a majority of the charged offenses and faced\r\n  a more severe sentence.Â  \r\nIn terms of the conflict of interest, plea counsel acknowledged\r\n  that she discussed this issue with Husband, but could not recall specifically\r\n  talking to Petitioner about such a conflict.Â  Plea counsel also admitted that\r\n  she argued for leniency in Husbandâ€™s case and requested the plea judge\r\n  reconsider his sentence.Â  In contrast, plea counsel did not make these\r\n  arguments on behalf of Petitioner.Â  Moreover, Petitionerâ€™s and Husbandâ€™s\r\n  interests were adverse to one another given Petitioner pleaded guilty to the\r\n  majority of the drug charges whereas Husband pleaded guilty to a single charge\r\n  of PWID marijuana within proximity of a school.Â  Significantly, plea counsel\r\n  stated at the plea proceeding that Husband was originally â€œcharged with\r\n  everything,â€ but she â€œwas able to get the solicitor who had the case at the\r\n  time to dismiss all of his cases.â€Â  A review of the plea proceeding also\r\n  reveals that plea counsel argued for leniency on behalf of Husband by comparing\r\n  his more limited involvement in the crimes to that of Petitioner.Â  We believe\r\n  plea counselâ€™s approach essentially pitted Husband against Petitioner, which\r\n  was clearly detrimental to Petitionerâ€™s interests.\r\nIn light of the foregoing, we find Petitioner established that an\r\n  actual conflict of interest adversely affected her plea counselâ€™s performance.Â  See Thomas v. State, 346 S.C. 140, 143-45, 551 S.E.2d 254, 256\r\n  (2001) (holding Petitioner in PCR proceeding demonstrated actual conflict of\r\n  interest that affected her counselâ€™s performance given counsel jointly\r\n  represented Petitioner and her husband in a case where solicitor offered a plea\r\n  bargain that would allow the charge against one spouse to be dismissed if the\r\n  other spouse would plead guilty to the entire amount of cocaine); see also Staggs v. State, 372 S.C. 549, 551-52, 643 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (2007) (Petitioner\r\n  in PCR proceeding demonstrated actual conflict of interest that adversely\r\n  affected counselâ€™s trial performance where his counsel, who represented him on\r\n  the charge of murder, also simultaneously represented Petitionerâ€™s father,\r\n  mother, and brother on related accessory after the fact of murder charges); see\r\n    generally Allan L. Schwartz, Circumstances Giving Rise to Conflict of\r\n      Interest Between or Among Criminal Codefendants Precluding Representation by\r\n      Same Counsel, 34 A.L.R.3d 470 (1970 &amp; Supp. 2008) (outlining cases\r\n  which consider what particular circumstances give rise to conflict of interest\r\n  where single counsel represents multiple codefendants).Â  \r\nBecause Petitioner demonstrated an actual conflict of interest, she\r\n  did not have to demonstrate prejudice in order to be entitled to\r\n  post-conviction relief.  Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the PCR judge.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  On May 6, 2002, a circuit court judge erroneously\r\n  dismissed Petitionerâ€™s application on the mistaken belief that she was no\r\n  longer incarcerated.Â  After Petitionerâ€™s application was reinstated, the\r\ncircuit court conducted the hearing on December 14, 2006.\r\n[2]Â Â  The record indicates that plea counsel only asked\r\nthe judge to reconsider Husbandâ€™s sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Samuel Michael Ogburn","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2008-07-28-01","description":"","date":"2008-07-28","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of Samuel Michael Ogburn, Respondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nRespondent was suspended on December 10, 2007, for a period of sixty (60) days.
