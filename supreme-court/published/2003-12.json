Wimberly, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25756\r\nHeard November 6, 2003 - Filed December \r\n  1, 2003\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDesa A. Ballard, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  This is an attorney disciplinary matter.  The full panel \r\n  adopted the subpanelâ€™s report, and recommended that respondent receive a nine-month \r\n  suspension, and that he be required to pay costs. [1]   Neither party filed exceptions to the report \r\n  [2]  or briefs.  We suspend respondent for 12 months and order him to pay \r\n  $295 in costs.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts are not in \r\n  dispute.  Respondent, a mortgage broker, was seeking refinancing of a mortgage \r\n  on behalf of a married couple.  The appraiser questioned whether the marital \r\n  property would qualify for the refinance loan.  Respondent obtained a letter \r\n  from the tax assessorâ€™s office concerning a separate property.  Using the letterâ€™s \r\n  letterhead and signature as a base, respondent created two purported assessorâ€™s \r\n  letters placing the marital property and another parcel owned by the wife under \r\n  a single tax map number.  These forged documents were presented to the appraiser, \r\n  who questioned their validity.  The couple was able to obtain the refinancing \r\n  without the use of the forged letters.\r\nRespondent was charged \r\n  with forgery as the result of creating these letters.  The criminal charge was \r\n  dismissed following respondentâ€™s successful completion of a pre-trial intervention \r\n  program.\r\nPANEL REPORT\r\nThe panel concluded \r\n  that respondent acted deliberately to mislead respondentâ€™s employer, the lender, \r\n  and the appraiser.  It noted that not only did respondent conceive this scheme, \r\n  but that he also engaged in a serious criminal act in furtherance of it.  The \r\n  panel found respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct \r\n  contained in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 8.4(a) (violated the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (committed a criminal act that reflects adversely on his \r\n  honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer); Rule 8.4(c) (engaged in conduct \r\n  involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, \r\n  fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (engaged in conduct prejudicial \r\n  to the administration of justice).  Respondent was also found to have violated \r\n  the following Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule \r\n  7(a)(1) (violated the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaged \r\n  in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the \r\n  courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness \r\n  to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violated the oath of office taken upon admission \r\n  to practice law in this state).\r\nSANCTION\r\nThe sole issue before the Court is the appropriate sanction for respondentâ€™s \r\n  admitted misconduct.  The panel has recommended a nine-month suspension and \r\n  payment of $295 in costs.  This Court is not bound by the panelâ€™s recommendation \r\n  but â€œmust administer the sanction it deems appropriate after a thorough review \r\n  of the record.â€  In re Oliver, Op. No. 25721 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed September \r\n  29, 2003) (internal citation omitted).\r\nRespondent offered evidence \r\n  in mitigation and relies especially on the fact that he did not â€˜personally \r\n  profitâ€™ from his wrongdoing, and on the fact that the refinancing was accomplished \r\n  without reliance on the forged letters.  We find the claim that respondent did \r\n  not profit from his misconduct disingenuous.  No doubt respondentâ€™s continued \r\n  employment as a mortgage broker is contingent on his ability to successfully \r\n  develop business opportunities, such as this refinancing, for his employer.  \r\n  Further, respondent admitted that he received some part of the $1,260 origination \r\n  fee generated by this refinancing, thus demonstrating that he profited in a \r\n  monetary sense from this transaction.  Finally, although the refinancing was \r\n  obtained without the use of the forged letters, this does not negate the fact \r\n  that respondent gave them to the appraiser with the intent that they would be \r\n  viewed as genuine.  \r\nWe find that the appropriate sanction for respondentâ€™s misconduct is a one-year \r\n  suspension from the practice of law.  As we recently explained, a harsher sanction \r\n  is warranted where the attorney not only creates a forged document, but also \r\n  presents it as authentic. In the Matter of Belding, Op. No. 25750 (S.C. \r\n  Sup. Ct. filed November 10, 2003).  In the present case, the forged letters \r\n  were presented to the appraiser as authentic.  We find that one year is an appropriate \r\n  sanction.\r\nRespondent shall, within \r\n  fifteen days of the filing of this opinion, pay costs in the amount of $295.  \r\n  Further, within fifteen days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall \r\n  file an affidavit demonstrating that he has complied with the requirements \r\n  of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The costs total $295.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Respondent did file objections to the subpanelâ€™s \r\n    report, but did not renew them after that report was adopted by the full panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25757","title":"Ex Parte:  Charles M.

Watson, Jr., of Greenwood, for Petitioner.\r\nA.J. Tothacer, Jr., of Greenville, Alexander Cruikshanks, \r\n  IV, of Clinton, Charles Heath Ruffner, of Cheraw, Dâ€™Anne Haydel, of Orangeburg, \r\n  Hubbard W. McDonald, Jr., of Bennettsville, Kelly Jean Golden, of Beaufort, \r\n  Robert M. Bell, of Langley, Thomas L. Martin, of Anderson, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n___________\r\nPER CURIAM:  Charles \r\n  M. Watson, Jr., County Attorney for Greenwood County, (â€œPetitionerâ€), seeks \r\n  a declaratory judgment as to whether nonlawyer title abstractors engage in the \r\n  unauthorized practice of law when they conduct a title search and report the \r\n  title status in connection with a tax foreclosure sale.  We hold that such activities \r\n  constitute the unauthorized practice of law and must either be conducted or \r\n  supervised by an attorney.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nBefore selling a property \r\n  at a tax foreclosure sale, tax collectors must provide notice of the sale to \r\n  the property owner and any lien holders.  In order to determine who is entitled \r\n  to notice, tax collectors often hire title abstractorsâ€”who generally are not \r\n  licensed attorneysâ€”to examine the public records and report the status of title.    \r\n\r\nTax collectors and County Attorneys throughout \r\n  this state disagree as to whether such title abstractors, when performing their \r\n  duties without an attorneyâ€™s supervision, are engaged in the unauthorized practice \r\n  of law.  Because of this disagreement, Petitioner sought a declaratory judgment \r\n  pursuant to this Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction under In re Unauthorized Practice \r\n  of Law Rules Proposed by the South Carolina Bar, 309 S.C. 304, 307, 422 \r\n  S.E.2d 123, 125 (1992).  On April 11, 2003, this Court granted the petition \r\n  and directed Petitioner to file a brief and serve it on every County Attorney \r\n  in this state.  Eight County Attorneys \r\n  [1]  (â€œRespondentsâ€) responded.  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner contends that when a nonlawyer title \r\n  abstractor examines public records and reports the status of a title, without \r\n  the supervision of a licensed attorney, the title abstractor is engaged in the \r\n  unauthorized practice of law.  We agree.          \r\nThis Court has addressed the unauthorized practice \r\n  of law in the real estate context on at least three occasions.  In the first \r\n  case, this Court held that the preparation of title abstracts by title companies \r\n  for buyers constituted the unauthorized practice of law.  State v. Buyers \r\n  Serv. Co., Inc., 292 S.C. 426, 357 S.E.2d 15 (1987).  The Court found that \r\n  â€œ[t]he examination of titles requires expert legal knowledge and skill.â€ Id. \r\n  at 432, 357 S.E.2d at 19.  As a result, the Court established a requirement \r\n  that title examinations and abstract preparation be conducted â€œunder the supervision \r\n  of a licensed attorney.â€  Id. at 432-33, 357 S.E.2d at 19.       \r\nSimilarly, in another case, this Court considered \r\n  whether a title search performed by a title company for a lender constituted \r\n  the unauthorized practice of law.  Doe v. McMaster, 355 S.C. 306, 585 \r\n  S.E.2d 773 (2003).  As in Buyers, this Court held that:\r\n\r\nTitle Companyâ€™s title search and preparation of title documents \r\n  for the Lender, without direct attorney supervision, constitutes the unauthorized \r\n  practice of law.  The title search and subsequent preparation of related documentation \r\n  is permissible only when a licensed attorney supervises the process.  In order \r\n  to comply with this Courtâ€™s ruling Doe must ensure the title search and preparation \r\n  of loan documents are supervised by an attorney.\r\n\r\nId. at 313, 585 S.E.2d at 776.   \r\nIn the third case, this Court disciplined an attorney \r\n  for authorizing his paralegal to conduct a real estate closing in the attorneyâ€™s \r\n  absence.  Matter of Lester, 353 S.C. 246, 247, 578 S.E.2d 7 (2003).  \r\n  The Court found, and the attorney later acknowledged, that an attorney should \r\n  have been physically present at the closing.  Id. at 247, 578 S.E.2d \r\n  at 7.  In addition to publicly reprimanding the attorney, the Court delivered \r\n  a message to all attorneys, cautioning them against delegating functions that \r\n  should be performed by attorneys to support staff.  Id. at 248, 578 S.E.2d \r\n  at 8.\r\nBased on the foregoing precedent, we find that \r\n  examining titles and preparing title abstracts constitute practicing law.  Therefore, \r\n  we require that licensed attorneys either conduct or supervise such activities.  \r\n  This requirement was established in Buyers and continues today for the \r\n  purpose of protecting the public.  292 S.C. at 432-33, 357 S.E.2d at 19.\r\nIn the present case, property owners, buyers, lien \r\n  holders, and counties depend on the tax collector to notify all those statutorily \r\n  entitled to notice.  If the title abstractorâ€™s report contains errors, a tax \r\n  sale may be invalidated, and the county may be subject to due process claims \r\n  from those who did not receive notice.      \r\nFurther, that the title abstractor is not, by the \r\n  report, guaranteeing title or certifying that the title is marketable is of \r\n  little consequence.  Although the tax title is of a quitclaim-deed nature, it \r\n  still has a legal effect: it signifies that title has been conveyed.  Therefore, \r\n  the title abstractorâ€™s report must either be generated or approved by a licensed \r\n  attorney.\r\nFinally, we recognize that expenses associated \r\n  with the tax-sale process will increase if counties are required to involve \r\n  attorneys in either the performance or oversight of title examination and abstract \r\n  preparation.  But we believe that mistakes, such as failing to notify the proper \r\n  parties, may prove more costly.  On balance, the consequences of relying on \r\n  a defective report may expend more county resources than the costs associated \r\n  with taking proper measures from the outset.                 \r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the foregoing \r\n  analysis, we hold that when nonlawyer title abstractors examine public records \r\n  and then render an opinion as to the content of those records, they are engaged \r\n  in the unauthorized practice of law.  But if a licensed attorney reviews the \r\n  title abstractorâ€™s report and vouches for its legal sufficiency by signing the \r\n  report, title abstractors would not be engaged in the unauthorized practice \r\n  of law.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, \r\n  BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] The responding County Attorneys are from Aiken, Anderson, Beaufort, \r\n    Chesterfield, Greenville, Laurens, Marlboro, and Orangeburg counties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25740","title":"Murphy v.

Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-150 (1976), where the cause of action \r\n  is a tort suit premised on a latent disease claim.  The circuit court held this \r\n  suit barred by the statute, and a panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed.  The \r\n  case was then reheard en banc, and by a vote of 7 to 2,  [1]  the Court of Appeals held the Door Closing \r\n  Statute did not apply.  Murphy v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 346 \r\n  S.C. 37, 550 S.E.2d 589 (Ct. App. 2001).  We granted certiorari and now affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (petitioner) \r\n  employed respondent Janet Murphyâ€™s (Janetâ€™s) father (Father) as a chemical engineer \r\n  from 1951 to 1984.  Father was exposed to insulating asbestos dust and fibers \r\n  in the course of his employment as he observed the reconfiguration of textile \r\n  spinning equipment. \r\n Father worked at petitionerâ€™s Virginia plant from \r\n  1951 to 1966.  Janet was born in 1960.  From 1966 until 1969 the family lived \r\n  in South Carolina.  They returned to Virginia until 1974, then spent four years \r\n  overseas, and Father spent the last six years of his employment with petitioner \r\n  in Virginia.\r\nIn July 1995, Janet was diagnosed with mesothelioma.  [2]   She brought this tort action \r\n  in South Carolina, and her husband (David) brought his loss of consortium suit \r\n  here.  They allege Janet developed the disease as the result of her childhood \r\n  exposure to asbestos fibers and dust in Fatherâ€™s clothing.  Further, they contend \r\n  that while Father was exposed to asbestos at all of petitionerâ€™s facilities, \r\n  his exposure was greatest at the South Carolina plant.\r\nPetitioner moved to dismiss Janetâ€™s and Davidâ€™s claims under Rule 12(b)(1), \r\n  SCRCP, on the grounds South Carolina lacked subject matter jurisdiction over \r\n  the suits in light of the Door Closing Statute.  The circuit court dismissed \r\n  the actions.  See e.g. Nix v. Mercury Motors Express, Inc., 270 \r\n  S.C. 477, 242 S.E.2d 683 (1978).  Janet and David appealed, and the en banc \r\n  Court of Appeals reversed.  Murphy v. Owens-Corning, supra. Following \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s ruling and the decision of the Court of Appeals, we overruled \r\n  our precedents including Nix which had held that the Door Closing Statute \r\n  determines subject matter jurisdiction, and explained that the statute in fact \r\n  governs a partyâ€™s capacity to sue. Farmer v. Monsanto Corp., 353 S.C. \r\n  553, 579 S.E.2d 325 (2003).\r\nLAW\r\nThe Door Closing Statute provides:\r\n\r\nÂ§ 15-5-150.  Foreign corporations as defendants.\r\nAn action against a corporation created by or under the laws of any other state, \r\n  government, or country may be brought in the circuit court:\r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  By any \r\n  resident of this State for any cause of action; or\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  By a \r\n  plaintiff not a resident of this State when the cause of action shall have arisen \r\n  or the subject of the action shall be situated within this State.\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn this case, subsection (2) of Â§ 15-5-150 is the relevant provision since \r\n  neither Janet nor David is a South Carolina resident.  In Ophuls &amp; Hill \r\n  v. Carolina Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 160 S.C. 441, 158 S.E. 824 (1931), the Court \r\n  explicated the meaning of the statutory terms â€˜cause of actionâ€™ and â€˜subject \r\n  of the action.â€™  â€˜Cause of actionâ€™ was â€œdescribed as being a legal wrong threatened \r\n  or committed against the complaining partyâ€ while the â€˜subject of the actionâ€™ \r\n  was defined as â€œthe matter or thing, differing both from the wrong and the \r\n  relief, in regard to which the controversy has arisen, concerning which the \r\n  wrong has been done; and this is, ordinarily the property, or the contract and \r\n  its subject matter, or other thing involved in the dispute.â€  Id. \r\n  at 450, 158 S.E. at 827 (emphasis in original).  In this tort case, the focus \r\n  is on the term â€˜cause of action,â€™ and not on the â€˜subject of the action.â€™\r\nIn order for Janet to bring her suit \r\n  [3]  in South Carolina, she must meet the Door Closing Statuteâ€™s requirement \r\n  that â€œthe cause of action shall have arisenâ€¦within this State.â€  Â§ 15-5-150 \r\n  (2).  Janetâ€™s complaint unequivocally meets the â€˜cause of actionâ€™ component \r\n  of this requirement since she alleges that the legal wrong occurred in South \r\n  Carolina when she was exposed to asbestos fibers and dust on Fatherâ€™s clothing.  \r\n  Ophuls &amp; Hill v. Carolina Ice &amp; Fuel Co., supra.  As the \r\n  Court of Appeals held, the critical inquiry here is whether the cause of action \r\n  arose within the State.  We thus examine, for the first time, when a \r\n  latent disease cause of action â€˜arises.â€™  Cf. Grillo v. Speedrite \r\n  Prods., Inc., 340 S.C. 498, 532 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 2000) cert. denied \r\n  December 12, 2000 (discovery rule/statute of limitations in toxic exposure case).  \r\n  In doing so, we reexamine our precedents which equate the terms â€˜ariseâ€™ and \r\n  â€˜accrue.â€™\r\nOur consideration of the novel issue raised by this case begins with an examination \r\n  of the policies underlying the Door Closing Statute.  Those policies \r\n  have been articulated as follows:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   It favors resident plaintiffs over nonresident plaintiffs;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   It provides a forum for wrongs connected with the State while avoiding the \r\n  resolution of wrongs in which the State has little interest; and\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   It encourages activity and investment within the State by foreign corporations \r\n  without subjecting them to actions unrelated to their activity within the State.\r\nFarmer v. Monstanto Corp., supra citing\r\nRosenthal v. Unarco Industries, Inc., 278 S.C. 420, \r\n  297 S.E.2d 638 (1982).\r\n\r\nThe first policy, favoring resident plaintiffs, is reflected in subsection \r\n  (1) of Â§ 15-5-150 of the Door Closing Statute, which allows â€œany resident of \r\n  this Stateâ€ to maintain â€œany cause of action.â€  This subsection, essentially \r\n  â€œopening the Doorâ€ for resident plaintiffs, is irrelevant to determining whether \r\n  Janet, a nonresident, has the capacity to maintain this suit. The second \r\n  policy expressed in the statute restricts actions brought in state courts to \r\n  those where the alleged wrong is connected to the State.  Janetâ€™s suit does \r\n  not offend this policy.  The third policy consideration when a nonresident \r\n  seeks to sue a foreign corporation in state court is whether the suit is predicated \r\n  on the corporationâ€™s in-state activities.  Id.  Permitting Janet \r\n  to maintain her action in our state courts does not contravene this policy.  \r\n  Having concluded that no fundamental policy would be offended by this suit, \r\n  we turn to the arise/accrue distinction.\r\nIn traditional tort settings, we have held that a cause of action \r\n  arises in this State for purposes of the Door Closing Statute when the plaintiff \r\n  has the right to bring suit.  See Cornelius v. Atlantic Greyhound \r\n  Lines, 177 S.C. 93, 180 S.E. 791 (1935).  In construing the statutory requirement \r\n  that â€œthe cause of action shall have arisen . . . within in this State,â€ the \r\n  Cornelius court cited with approval to an authority that â€œstated that \r\n  â€˜a cause of action accrues when facts exist which authorize one party \r\n  to maintain an action against another.â€™â€  Id. at 96, 180 S.E. at 792 \r\n  (emphasis supplied).  Cornelius is consistent with our later decision \r\n  in Stephens v. Draffin, 327 S.C. 1, 488 S.E.2d 307 (1997), where we held \r\n  â€œour cases use the verbs â€˜ariseâ€™ and â€˜accrueâ€™ interchangeably when discussing \r\n  the issue of the juncture at which the right to sue came into existence.â€  Id. \r\n  at footnote 4; see also Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., Op. No. 25697 \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 11, 2003).\r\nWere we to apply our traditional view of when a tort cause of action \r\n  arises or accrues, we must conclude that Janetâ€™s cause of action did not arise \r\n  â€œwithin the Stateâ€ because no injury or damages occurred while she was in South \r\n  Carolina.  [4]   Until the exposure to asbestos resulted in \r\n  injury or damage, Janetâ€™s tort cause of action did not accrue.  See e.g., \r\n  Gray v. Southern Facilities, 256 S.C. 558, 183 S.E.2d 438 (1971) (â€œIt \r\n  is basic that a negligent act is not in itself actionable and only becomes such \r\n  when it results in injury or damage to anotherâ€).  Respondents urge us to reconsider \r\n  whether to recognize a distinction between the terms â€˜ariseâ€™ and â€˜accrueâ€™ in \r\n  the context of latent disease tort actions within the ambit of the Door Closing \r\n  Statute.\r\nAs explained above, the policies reflected in the Door Closing Statute \r\n  would not be offended by allowing Janetâ€™s suit to proceed in state court.  The \r\n  only obstacle to Janetâ€™s maintenance of this action results from the \r\n  nature of the latent disease process. \r\nWe find that it is not appropriate to apply a strict accrual test to latent \r\n  disease tort actions brought by a nonresident against a foreign corporation.  \r\n  We hold that the proper inquiry is whether the foreign corporationâ€™s \r\n  activities that allegedly exposed the victim to the injurious substance, \r\n  and the exposure itself, occurred within the State.  If so, then the legal wrong \r\n  was committed here.  See Ophuls &amp; Hill v. Carolina Ice &amp; Fuel \r\n  Co., supra.  The fact that the legal wrong did not result in injury \r\n  and/or damages until the plaintiff had left the State does not foreclose a suit \r\n  under the Door Closing Statute.  Janetâ€™s latent disease claim â€˜aroseâ€™ in South \r\n  Carolina. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court erred in dismissing \r\n  the suits under the Door Closing Statute.  [5]   The decision of the Court of Appeals, reversing \r\n  that decision and remanding the case to the circuit court, is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  TOAL, C.J., concurring in result in a \r\n  separate opinion in which MOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Although I agree the Court of Appeals should be \r\n  affirmed in this case, I respectfully disagree with the analysis employed by \r\n  the majority, and, therefore, write separately to concur in result only.  See \r\n  Murphy v. Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., 346 S.C. 37, 550 S.E.2d 589 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).  The majority opinion purports to affirm the Court of Appeals, but \r\n  it ignores the distinction between â€œariseâ€ and â€œaccrueâ€ upon which \r\n  the Court of Appeals based its decision.  For the following reasons, I would \r\n  affirm the Court of Appeals opinion as it was written.\r\nThe South Carolina Door Closing Statute provides, \r\n\r\nAn action against a corporation created by or under the laws of any other state, \r\n  government, or country may be brought in circuit court:\r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By any \r\n  resident of this State for any cause of action; or\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By a \r\n  plaintiff not a resident of this State when the cause of action shall have arisen \r\n  or the subject of the action shall be situated within this State.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-150 (1976) (emphasis added).  Both the majority opinion \r\n  of this Court and the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion recognize that in order for \r\n  Janet to bring her suit in South Carolina, she must meet the Door Closing Statuteâ€™s \r\n  requirement that her cause of action arise within this State.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-5-150; see Murphy, 346 S.C. at 46, 550 S.E.2d at 593.  \r\nAfter noting that arise and accrue have been used interchangeably \r\n  in the â€œtypical tort setting,â€ the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion concluded that \r\n  there is a distinction between arise and accrue in latent disease \r\n  cases such as this one.  Murphy, 346 S.C. at 47-48, 550 S.E.2d at 594-95.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe record establishes that the alleged wrongdoing, from \r\n  which [Janetâ€™s] right to bring this action proceeds, originated in South Carolina.  \r\n  Their claims, therefore, arose in this state even though they did not accrue \r\n  until the mesotheliomia was diagnosed.\r\nIn applying the Door Closing Statute, the manifestation \r\n  of injury through diagnosis, while relevant, is not dispositive in every case \r\n  for the purpose of determining whether a cause of action shall have arisen \r\n  in South Carolina.  Such an approach is too simplistic and would lead to results \r\n  contrary to existing case law and the legislative goals of the statute.\r\n\r\nId. at 48, 550 S.E.2d at 594-95 (emphasis added).\r\nThe majority opinion, on the other hand, declines to accept a distinction between \r\n  arise and accrue, stating, â€œ[a]pplying our traditional view of \r\n  when a tort cause of action arises or accrues, we must conclude \r\n  that Janetâ€™s cause of action did not arise â€˜within the State,â€™ because \r\n  no injury or damages occurred in South Carolina.â€  (emphasis added).  The majority \r\n  averts the result this conclusion logically mandates on grounds that â€œit is \r\n  not appropriate to apply a strict accrual test to latent disease tort actions \r\n  brought by a nonresident against foreign corporations.â€  \r\n\r\nWe hold that the proper inquiry is whether the foreign corporationâ€™s activities \r\n  that allegedly exposed the victim to the injurious substance, and the exposure \r\n  itself, occurred within the State.  If so, then the legal wrong was committed \r\n  here.  The fact that the legal wrong did not result in injury and/or damages \r\n  until the plaintiff had left the State does not foreclose the Door Closing Statute.  \r\n  Janetâ€™s latent disease claims â€˜aroseâ€™ in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n(citations omitted).\r\nAlthough the majority reaches the same result as the Court of Appeals, \r\n  in my opinion, the only appropriate way to reach this result is to distinguish \r\n  arise and accrue according to their technical, legal definitions.  \r\n  See Murphy, 346 S.C at 47, 550 S.E.2d at 594 (citations omitted) (stating \r\n  that a cause of action arises when the act or omission that creates the \r\n  right to bring the suit happens or begins and that a cause of action accrues \r\n  when it becomes complete so that the aggrieved party can prosecute the action).  \r\n  The majorityâ€™s decision goes beyond mere interpretation of the language of the \r\n  Door Closing Statute and, instead, appears to make a judicial exception to the \r\n  Statute for latent disease cases.  \r\nIn this case, Janet alleges that she came into contact with asbestos in South \r\n  Carolina between 1966 and 1969, which finally manifested in a diagnosis of mesothelioma \r\n  in July 1995.  Janetâ€™s Father worked at Petitionerâ€™s South Carolina plant during \r\n  these years, and Janet alleges she was exposed to asbestos fibers and dust that \r\n  became caught in Fatherâ€™s clothing while working at the plant. Under these facts, \r\n  I would find that Janetâ€™s cause of action against Petitioner arose in \r\n  South Carolina, but did not accrue until her diagnosis of mesothelioma \r\n  in Virginia.  While arise and accrue may be used interchangeably \r\n  appropriately in most circumstances (because most causes of action arise \r\n  and accrue simultaneously), the two terms retain a technical distinction \r\n  which comes into play in latent disease cases such as this one.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I write separately and concur in result only. \r\nMOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In this case, the en banc panel consisted \r\n    of four judges of the Court of Appeals and five acting Court of Appeals judges \r\n    drawn from other state courts.  The five acting judges sat by designation \r\n    of Chief Justice Toal.  See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 4 (â€œThe Chief Justice \r\n    shallâ€¦have the power to assign any judge to sit in any court within the unified \r\n    judicial systemâ€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Janet died of mesothelioma during the pendency \r\n    of this matter.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  We focus our discussion on Janetâ€™s suit since \r\n    Davidâ€™s consortium claim is dependent on the viability of Janetâ€™s claim.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Unlike the Court of Appeals, we do not rely upon \r\n    a medical doctorâ€™s affidavit, submitted after the motion to dismiss was granted, \r\n    to find injury at the time of exposure.  It is questionable whether the affidavit \r\n    was properly before the circuit court when it was deciding the Rule 59 motion.  \r\n    See Wright, Miller, &amp; Kane Fed. Proc. Practice: Civil 2d Â§ 2810.1 \r\n    (1995 and Supp. 2002).  Whether to allow the affidavit upon remand is a question \r\n    we leave to the trial courtâ€™s discretion.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  We do not perceive any meaningful distinction \r\n    between our resolution of this issue and that of the concurring opinion.  \r\n    That opinion differs only in that it decides not just the question whether \r\n    Janetâ€™s claim arose in South Carolina, but also determines the action accrued \r\n    in 1995 upon Janetâ€™s diagnosis.  Since this case comes before us in the context \r\n    of a 12(b)(1) motion, we need not decide any factual or legal question other \r\n    than whether the circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25758","title":"Ward v.

Federal retirees claim that South Carolina \r\n  discriminates in taxation between state and federal retirees in violation of \r\n  the federal constitutional and statutory intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine. \r\n  For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court err in holding that Act 189 does \r\n  not violate the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine now codified in 4 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 111 (1997) [1]  and is therefore constitutional?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nStatutes are to be construed in favor of \r\n  constitutionality, and this Court will presume a legislative act is constitutional, \r\n  unless its repugnance to the Constitution is clear and beyond a reasonable doubt. \r\n  Main v. Thomason, 342 S.C. 79, 86, 535 S.E.2d 918, 921 (2000).\r\nThe South Carolina General Assembly enacted \r\n  Act 189 to comply with the United States Supreme Court decision in Davis \r\n  v. Michigan Deptâ€™t of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 103 L.Ed.2d \r\n  891 (1989).  In Davis, the Supreme Court held that the Michigan Income \r\n  Tax Act violated the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring \r\n  retired state and local government employees over retired federal employees.  \r\n  The Michigan statute exempted retirement benefits paid by state and local governments \r\n  from state income taxes without exempting retirement benefits paid by the federal \r\n  government from state income taxes.  The Supreme Court stated, â€œIt is undisputed \r\n  that Michiganâ€™s tax system discriminates in favor of retired state employees \r\n  and against retired federal employees.â€  Id. at 814, 109 S.Ct. at 1507, \r\n  103 L.Ed.2d at 904. \r\nTo resolve the unconstitutional taxation \r\n  provision, the Supreme Court declared that a mandate of â€œequal treatmentâ€ would \r\n  remedy the constitutional infirmity in the Michigan statute.  The Supreme Court \r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n[A]ppellantâ€™s claim could be resolved either by extending \r\n  the tax exemption to retired federal employees (or to all retired employees), \r\n  or by eliminating the exemption for retired state and local government employees. \r\n  ***  [T]he Michigan courts are in the best position to determine how to comply \r\n  with the mandate of equal treatment. \r\n\r\nId. at 818, 109 S.Ct. at 1509, 103 L.Ed.2d at \r\n  907.\r\nPrior to Davis, South Carolina exempted \r\n  all state retirement benefits from income taxation, but only exempted the first \r\n  $3,000 of federal retirement benefits.  Act 189, Â§ 39 repealed the tax exemption \r\n  for state retirement benefits, thereby rendering all federal and state retirement \r\n  benefits in excess of $3,000 taxable.  In addition to repealing the tax exemption, \r\n  the General Assembly simultaneously increased retirement benefits for state \r\n  and local retirees by 7%.  Act 189, Â§ 60.  This increase in benefits is provided \r\n  to  all state retirees, regardless of their tax liability.  The State does not \r\n  dispute that the General Assembly increased retirement benefits to compensate \r\n  state retirees, in part, for their increased income tax obligations resulting \r\n  from the enactment of Act 189.\r\nFederal retirees contend that Act 189 is \r\n  unconstitutional because the State continues to discriminate against federal \r\n  retirees by increasing the pension benefits paid to state and local retirees \r\n  in an effort to offset the increased tax liability resulting from the exemption.  \r\n  In other words, federal retirees argue that the State has indirectly recast \r\n  the pre-Davis discriminatory exemption through the 7% increase in benefits \r\n  for state retirees. We disagree. For the following reasons, we conclude Act \r\n  189 is not, in effect, a â€œtax rebateâ€ that implicates the intergovernmental \r\n  tax immunity doctrine.\r\n First, the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity does not deprive \r\n  a state of its sovereignty to establish the level of its employeesâ€™ compensation \r\n  as long as the State does not discriminate in taxation based on the source of \r\n  the income. The Tenth Amendment provides, â€œthe powers not delegated to the United \r\n  States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved \r\n  to the States respectively or to the people.â€  U.S. Const. amend X.  To determine \r\n  if a statute violates the Tenth Amendment, we must first determine whether the \r\n  regulation it embodies is within those enumerated in the Constitution.  Second, \r\n  we must determine whether the regulation employed impermissibly infringes upon \r\n  state sovereignty.  United States v. Johnson, 114 F.3d 476, 480 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1997) referring to New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, \r\n  156, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 2418, 120 L.Ed.2d 120, 137 (1992).  The power to compensate \r\n  state retirees is clearly not delegated to the United States by the Constitution.  \r\n  As long as federal and state retirees are taxed equally, any restriction on \r\n  this authority would violate the Tenth Amendment. \r\nSecond, in enacting Act 189, the General Assembly specifically followed \r\n  the dictate of Davis by eliminating the tax exemption for both state \r\n  and federal employees.  In doing so, the General Assembly was guided by the  \r\n  remedies suggested by the Supreme Court.  In direct response to Davis, \r\n  the General Assembly amended South Carolinaâ€™s tax statute to remove the tax \r\n  exemption for state retirees. Act 189 conformed South Carolina to the requirements \r\n  of the Davis decision.\r\nFederal retirees argue the â€œindisputable linkageâ€ between the increase \r\n  in compensation and the tax exemption renders Act 189 unconstitutional under \r\n  Davis.  They argue that the Court must consider substance over form in \r\n  evaluating the constitutionality of Act 189.  See West Lynn Creamery, \r\n  Inc. v. Healy, 512 U.S. 186, 201, 114 S.Ct. 2205, 2215, 129 L.Ed.2d 157, \r\n  171 (1994)(holding in a dormant Commerce Clause case, that it is not the form \r\n  by which a state discriminates, but whether the means employed will result in \r\n  discrimination). We do not believe Davis holds, or otherwise implies, \r\n  that states may only raise retirement benefits for its stateâ€™s retirees if the \r\n  pension increase in no way serves to offset a prior tax exemption.  Even if \r\n  the elimination of the tax exemption for state retirees and the simultaneous \r\n  increase in benefits are read together, the doctrine of intergovernmental tax \r\n  immunity is not violated.    South Carolina has specifically followed the remedy \r\n  prescribed by Davis.  Therefore, federal retireesâ€™ argument is unavailing. \r\n\r\nThird, neither Davis nor 4 U.S.C. Â§ 111 prohibit the State from contracting \r\n  with its retirees on the level of compensation paid to its retirees. The intergovernmental \r\n  tax immunity doctrine serves to protect each sovereignâ€™s governmental operations \r\n  from undue interference from the other.  Davis, 489 U.S. at 814, 109 \r\n  S.Ct. at 1507, 103 L.Ed.2d at 904.  Davis does not hold, nor does it \r\n  even suggest, that a state is prohibited from adjusting the compensation of \r\n  its employees, even if the stateâ€™s purpose is to compensate its employees for \r\n  the loss of the income tax exemption.  A state is entitled to raise the level \r\n  of taxable compensation of its employees if it so chooses.  Davis requires \r\n  that the state tax federal and state retirees equally and does not concern \r\n  itself with the manner in which a state chooses to compensate its retirees. \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court implicitly recognized that a stateâ€™s response to \r\n  the Courtâ€™s decision could be to increase compensation to state retirees to \r\n  offset what those retirees lost in benefits as a result of being taxed. In his \r\n  dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens stated:\r\n\r\nEven if it were appropriate to determine the discriminatory nature of a tax \r\n  system by comparing the treatment of federal employees with the treatment of \r\n  another discrete group of persons, it is peculiarly inappropriate to focus solely \r\n  on the treatment of state governmental employees.  The state may always compensate \r\n  in pay or salary for what it assesses in taxes.  Thus a special tax imposed \r\n  only on federal and state employees nonetheless may reflect the type of disparate \r\n  treatment that the intergovernmental tax immunity forbids because of the ability \r\n  of the State to adjust any special tax burden on themâ€¦It trivializes the Supremacy \r\n  Clause to interpret it as prohibiting the States from providing through this \r\n  limited tax exemption what the state has an unquestionable right to provide \r\n  through increased retirement benefits.\r\n\r\n489 U.S. at 824, 109 S.Ct. at 1512, 103 L.Ed.2d at 910-911. (emphasis added).  \r\n\r\nAlthough the majority disagreed with the first sentence in the above \r\n  passage, they took no issue with a stateâ€™s ability to lawfully increase the \r\n  benefits paid to state retirees to offset the effect of the Courtâ€™s holding.  \r\n  South Carolinaâ€™s increase is the type of response to Davis specifically \r\n  contemplated by the Supreme Court.  The doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity \r\n  does not apply because there is no discrimination in taxation on account of \r\n  the source of compensation.\r\nFourth, we find no direct correlation between state retireesâ€™ \r\n  state tax obligations and the amount of increased retirement benefits.  All \r\n  eligible state retirees receive the 7% increase in retirement benefits.  Act \r\n  189 resulted in an increase in compensation for state retirees, and was not \r\n  a dollar for dollar offset.  Moreover, the increased benefits are subject to \r\n  both state and federal taxation.  In Davis, the majority stated, â€œ[t]axes \r\n  enacted to reduce the Stateâ€™s employment costs at the expense of the federal \r\n  treasury are the type of discriminatory legislation that the doctrine of intergovernmental \r\n  tax immunity is intended to bar.â€  Davis, 489 U.S. at 815, 109 S.Ct. \r\n  at 905, 103 L.Ed.2d at 1508.  The General Assemblyâ€™s increase in retirement \r\n  actually increased the employment costs for South Carolina, while simultaneously \r\n  bolstering the federal treasury.\r\n Federal retirees rely on Sheehy v. Public Employees Retirement \r\n  Div., 864 P.2d 762 (Mont. 1993) and Vogl v. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 960 \r\n  P.2d 373 (Or. 1998).  In Sheehy, federal retirees challenged Montanaâ€™s \r\n  1991 statute enacted in response to Davis.  Before Davis, Montana, \r\n  like South Carolina, taxed federal retirement benefits but exempted state retirement \r\n  benefits.  The Montana statute restructured the income tax on pension benefits \r\n  by equalizing the taxation of all pension benefits.  In the same act, the Montana \r\n  legislature granted to state retirees who were Montana residents, and who were \r\n  now to be taxed in response to Davis, an annual retirement adjustment \r\n  payment. Sheehy, 864 P.2d at 764.  The Montana Supreme Court held that \r\n  the Montana statute violated the intergovernmental tax immunity provision of \r\n  4 U.S.C. Â§ 111. The court stated,\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the adjustment is not an actual and legitimate pension or \r\n  retirement benefit.  If it were a pension benefit, the State would have provided \r\n  it to all of its retirees in recognition of their years of public service rather \r\n  than just those living in Montana.  There was no need to do so because the sole \r\n  purpose of the adjustment was to partially recompense state retirees living \r\n  in Montana for the tax they must pay under the equalizing provisions of [the \r\n  Montana law].  \r\n\r\n864 P.2d at 768.\r\nFederal retirees argue that South Carolinaâ€™s Act 189, \r\n  like the Montana statute, constitutes discriminatory taxation in violation of \r\n  intergovernmental tax immunity principles.  We disagree.  In reaching their \r\n  decision, the Montana Supreme Court relied heavily on the fact the adjustment \r\n  was provided only to state retirees who are Montana residents.  South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  statute is distinguishable.  Act 189 provides the increase to all state retirees, \r\n  regardless of their domicile.\r\nThe Oregon statute considered by the Oregon Supreme Court \r\n  in Vogl is also distinguishable from Act 189.  The 1995 Oregon statute \r\n  explicitly stated that its purpose was to compensate for damages.  Furthermore, \r\n  the benefit increases under the 1995 statute were mathematically correlated \r\n  to replace the lost state retirement income.  South Carolinaâ€™s General Assembly \r\n  did not tie the pension benefit increase, dollar for dollar, to the lost tax \r\n  exemption, nor did it declare that Act 189 was designed to compensate state \r\n  retirees for damages.  South Carolinaâ€™s Act 189 is analogous to the 1991 statute \r\n  considered by the Oregon Supreme Court in Ragsdale v. Depâ€™t of Revenue, \r\n  895 P.2d 1348 (Or. 1995).  In 1991, the Oregon legislature repealed the tax \r\n  exemption for state retirees and simultaneously increased the benefits for state \r\n  retirees.  [2]   Like Act 189, \r\n  Oregonâ€™s 1991 act provided no direct correlation between the increase in benefits \r\n  for state retirees and their tax obligations.  Id. at 1350.\r\n Federal retirees have failed to show beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt that Act 189 is clearly repugnant to the Constitution.  Accordingly, we \r\n  affirm.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, A.C.J., and Acting Justices H. Samuel Stilwell, \r\n  William L. Howard and J. Mark Hayes, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n            \r\n    [1] That Section provides in relevant part, â€œThe United States consents to \r\n    the taxation of pay or compensation for personal service as an officer or \r\n    employee of the United Statesâ€¦by a duly constituted taxing authority having \r\n    jurisdiction, if the taxation does not discriminate against the officer or \r\n    employee because of the source of the pay or compensation.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n            \r\n    [2] A Virginia statute, recently considered by a Virginia circuit court, is \r\n    also similar to Act 189.  In Almeter v. Virginia Department of Taxation, \r\n    2000 WL 1687589 (Va. Cir. Ct. Nov. 6, 2000), petition denied, (Va. \r\n    2001), cert. denied, 2001 WL 872690 (U.S. Oct. 1, 2001), federal retirees \r\n    brought a class action seeking a refund of state income taxes that they alleged \r\n    were illegally collected from them following that stateâ€™s 3% increase in retirement \r\n    benefits for its stateâ€™s retirees.  Like the present case, federal retirees \r\n    alleged that the 3% increase was designed to offset the new tax liability \r\n    incurred by state retirees and therefore violated the intergovernmental tax \r\n    immunity doctrine.  The Virginia circuit court dismissed the federal retireesâ€™ \r\n    claims in holding that the increase in benefits was a remedy specifically \r\n    envisioned by the Supreme Court in Davis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25759","title":"Southern Atlantic Financial v.

Rothwell and Scott L. Hood, both of Rothwell Law Firm, of Irmo, for \r\n  Petitioner.\r\nDavid Popowski, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:  We granted a writ of certiorari to review \r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Southern Atlantic Financial Services, Inc. \r\n  v. Middleton, 349 S.C. 77, 562 S.E.2d 482 (Ct. App. 2002).  We affirm as \r\n  modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 25, 1996, Donna Middleton entered into a note and mortgage \r\n  with Petitioner, Southern Atlantic Financial Services, to borrow $186,000 to \r\n  refinance her home.  Four months later, in October 1996, Middleton brought suit \r\n  against Southern, and the broker which obtained the loan, seeking a reduction \r\n  in the stated interest rate from 11.99% to 8%.  Middleton claimed the broker, \r\n  Carolina Federal Mortgage Company, had orally agreed to an 8% interest rate.  \r\n  Summary judgment was granted to Southern on the basis that the broker was not \r\n  its agent and could not reduce the interest amount.\r\nSubsequently, Southern brought suit to foreclose on the mortgage \r\n  and determine the amount due under the note. \r\n  [1]   Middleton argued Southern failed to send her a notice of default and \r\n  right to cure, as required by the note.  The master ruled the note did not require \r\n  Southern to provide Middleton notice prior to accelerating the balance.  Based \r\n  on the testimony of Southernâ€™s executive vice-president, the master awarded \r\n  Southern judgment of $311,457.63. \r\n  [2]   The Court of Appeals reversed; it found the default provision of the \r\n  note created an ambiguity as to whether notice was required prior to accelerating \r\n  the balance due; the Court of Appeals therefore remanded to the master for a \r\n  new trial to determine the partiesâ€™ respective intent and determine whether \r\n  Middleton had a right to notice of default and a right to cure.  \r\nISSUE\r\nIs the default provision of the note ambiguous?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Note signed by Middleton provides, in pertinent part, \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BORROWERâ€™S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED\r\n(B) Default\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I do not pay the full amount of each monthly payment on the date it is \r\n  due, I will be in default. \r\n(C) Notice of Default\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling \r\n  that if I do not pay the overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may \r\n  require me to pay immediately the full amount of principal which has not been \r\n  paid and all the interest that I owe on that amount.  That date must \r\n  be at least 30 days after the date of which the notice is delivered or mailed \r\n  to me.\r\n(D) No Waiver By Note Holder\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if, at a time when I am in default, the Note Holder does not require \r\n  me to pay immediately in full as described above, the Note Holder will have \r\n  the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing \r\n  this Note . . .\r\n\r\n(Emphasis \r\n  added).  \r\nGenerally, if the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous, this Court \r\n  must enforce the contract according to its terms regardless of its wisdom or \r\n  folly.  Ellis v. Taylor, 316 S.C. 245, 449 S.E.2d 487 (1994).  Ambiguous \r\n  language in a contract, however, should be construed liberally and interpreted \r\n  strongly in favor of the non-drafting party.  Myrtle Beach Lumber Co., Inc. \r\n  v. Willoughby, 276 S.C. 3, 274 S.E.2d 423 (1981).  â€œAfter all, the drafting \r\n  party has the greater opportunity to prevent mistakes in meaning.  It is responsible \r\n  for any ambiguity and should be the one to suffer from its shortcomings.â€  Bazzle \r\n  v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 351 S.C. 244, 262, 569 S.E.2d 349, 358 (2002), \r\n  vacated on other grounds, 123 S.Ct. 2403 (2003).  A contract is read \r\n  as a whole document so that &quot;one may not, by pointing out a single sentence \r\n  or clause, create an ambiguity.&quot;  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Ins. Co., \r\n  353 S.C. 491, 579 S.E.2d 132 (2003), citing Yarborough v. Phoenix \r\n  Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 592, 225 S.E.2d 344, 348 (1976).  \r\nThe Court of Appeals cited caselaw that the term â€œmayâ€ generally signifies â€œoptional.â€  \r\n  See Kennedy v. South Carolina Retirement Systems, 345 S.C. 339, \r\n  549 S.E.2d 243 (2001); Rice v. Multimedia, Inc. 318 S.C. 95, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  381 (1995).  However, the Court of Appeals failed to acknowledge that these \r\n  cases also stand for the proposition that the action spoken of is optional or \r\n  discretionary â€œunless it appears to require that it be given any other meaning.â€  \r\n  (Emphasis supplied).  Kennedy, supra, 345 S.C. at 353, 549 S.E.2d \r\n  at 250; see also State v. Wilson, 274 S.C. 352, 356, 264 S.E.2d \r\n  414, 416 (1980).     \r\nThe Court of Appeals nonetheless went on to hold, citing an Eighth Circuit case, \r\n  that â€œ[a]cceleration of an installment note, however, is a harsh remedy.â€  349 \r\n  S.C. at 83, 562 S.E.2d at 486, citing First Bank Investors' Trust \r\n  v. Tarkio College, 129 F.3d 471 (8th Cir.1997).  Accordingly, it held that \r\n  â€œ[b]ecause of the severity of the circumstances, a payee's right to accelerate \r\n  should therefore be clearly and unequivocally articulated within the agreement.â€  \r\n  Id.  (Emphasis in original).  The Court of Appeals held that the note \r\n  here â€œwas a contract of adhesion filled with boilerplate language made between \r\n  a sophisticated lender and an unsophisticated maker,â€ and cited a California \r\n  case establishing judicial limitations on the enforcement of adhesion contracts \r\n  when the contract â€œdoes not fall within the reasonable expectations of \r\n  the weaker or &quot;adhering&quot; party.â€  Id. citing Graham \r\n  v. Scissor-Tail, Inc., 28 Cal.3d 807, 171 Cal.Rptr. 604, 623 P.2d 165 (1981) \r\n  (emphasis supplied). \r\n \r\n  Although we agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ ultimate holding, we find its creation \r\n  of a â€œreasonable expectationsâ€ test is an unwarranted and unnecessary extension \r\n  of South Carolina law as this case may be decided utilizing basic principles \r\n  of contract ambiguity.  [3]    \r\nWe find the provisions of the note here are patently ambiguous.  \r\n  While it is possible to construe the note as simply giving rise to an option \r\n  on the part of Southern to give notice of default, the fact that it sets \r\n  forth a mandatory notice provision renders it susceptible of another construction.  \r\n  As noted previously, the provisions states:\r\n\r\nIf I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling that \r\n  if I do not pay the overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require \r\n  me to pay immediately the full amount of principal which has not been paid and \r\n  all the interest that I owe on that amount.  That date must be at least 30 \r\n  days after the date of which the notice is delivered or mailed to me.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).  We find this provision is susceptible of a construction \r\n  that the note sets forth that the Note Holder may accelerate, but that \r\n  if it decides to do so, it must give at least 30 days notice prior to accelerating.  \r\n  See Collins v. Doe, 352 S.C. 462, 574 S.E.2d 739 (2002)(use of \r\n  words such as &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;must&quot; indicates a mandatory requirement).  \r\n  Such a construction is consistent with caselaw that ambiguous language in a \r\n  contract should be construed liberally and interpreted strongly in favor of \r\n  the non-drafting party. Myrtle Beach Lumber Co., Inc. v. Willoughby, \r\n  supra.  \r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is affirmed as modified. [4]   \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]    The foreclosure suit was instituted \r\n    in Dec. 1996, but was held in abeyance pending resolution of Middletonâ€™s suit.  \r\n    At the hearing before the master in May 2000, it was revealed that Middleton \r\n    had deeded the property which was the subject of the foreclosure action to \r\n    a third party.  In light of this fact, the master found he could not go forward \r\n    with the foreclosure hearing, but he did go forward with the hearing on Middletonâ€™s \r\n    liability under the note. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   This figure included interest, insurance, and \r\n    taxes Southern had paid on the property.  Middleton never made any payments.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]    For the same reasons, we do not address whether \r\n    the present contract is one of adhesion; the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is \r\n    modified to the extent it so held.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   We are in accord with the Court of Appeals that \r\n    the two South Carolina cases dealing with acceleration clauses are not controlling \r\n    here.  In Allendale Furniture Co. v. Carolina Commercial Bank, 284 \r\n    S.C. 76, 77, 325 S.E.2d 530, 530-531 (1985), the note specifically stated \r\n    that upon default, the balance would become â€œat once due and payable at the \r\n    option of the holder without further notice.â€  In Hendrix v. Franklin, \r\n    292 S.C. 138, 355 S.E.2d 273 (Ct. App. 1986), the note provided that upon \r\n    default, the whole amount due became immediately due and payable at the Holderâ€™s \r\n    option and that the Holder had the right to institute legal proceedings thereon.  \r\n    Unlike the present case, however, the notes in Allendale or Hendrix, \r\n    had no provision which appeared to require notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25760","title":"State v.

Pachak, of the South Carolina Office \r\n  of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. \r\n  McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson and Assistant \r\n  Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. \r\n  Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:  We grant certiorari in this matter \r\n  to review the Court of Appeals' decision in State v. Keenon, Op. No. \r\n  2002-UP-749 (S.C. Ct. App. filed November 27, 2002).  We dispense with further \r\n  briefing and affirm as modified.\r\nPetitioner was convicted of first degree burglary, petit \r\n  larceny, and possession of a stolen vehicle.  Petitioner was charged with first \r\n  degree burglary under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2)(2003), which provides \r\n  that a person is guilty of first degree burglary if he enters a dwelling without \r\n  consent and with intent to commit a crime therein and the person has a prior \r\n  record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or both.  At \r\n  trial, the State sought to introduce evidence of petitioner's five prior convictions \r\n  for burglary and one prior conviction for housebreaking.  The State, in arguing \r\n  against petitioner's motion to limit introduction of evidence of the prior convictions, \r\n  relied on the Court of Appeals' opinion in State v. James, 346 S.C. 303, \r\n  551 S.E.2d 591 (Ct. App. 2001), wherein the Court of Appeals held that the introduction \r\n  of the defendant's seven prior convictions for burglary were relevant and were \r\n  not unduly prejudicial.  The trial judge denied petitioner's motion and allowed \r\n  introduction of evidence of petitioner's six prior convictions.\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals, also relying on State \r\n  v. James, supra, found the trial judge did not abuse his discretion \r\n  in admitting evidence of petitioner's six prior convictions.  At that time, \r\n  this Court had granted certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision in \r\n  State v. James.\r\nThereafter, this Court issued an opinion reversing the Court \r\n  of Appeals' decision in State v. James.  State v. James, 355 S.C. \r\n  25, 583 S.E.2d 745 (2003).  Therein, we determined that the probative value \r\n  of multiple prior convictions must be weighed against their prejudicial effect \r\n  under Rule 403, SCRE.  We found further that &quot;[a]lthough there may be rare \r\n  occasions where the admission of more than two prior burglary convictions is \r\n  more probative than prejudicial and therefore proper, the potential for undue \r\n  prejudice - for the impermissible interpretation of such evidence as propensity \r\n  or character evidence - warrants great caution.&quot;\r\nIn the case at hand, it was clearly error, in light of this \r\n  Court's opinion in State v. James, for the trial judge to allow the State \r\n  to present evidence of all six of petitioner's prior convictions without first \r\n  weighing the prejudicial effect against the probative value.

Genez, 350 S.C. 563, 567 S.E.2d \r\n  496 (Ct. App. 2002), in which the Court of Appeals held a motion to restore \r\n  to the docket must be filed within one year of the order striking the case pursuant \r\n  to Rule 40(j), SCRCP, but that the motion can be extended for good cause pursuant \r\n  to Rule 6(b), SCRCP.  We reverse.  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 17, 1995, Respondent ReDonna \r\n  Maxwell was involved in an automobile accident with Petitioners Beverly Genez \r\n  and John Doe.  Mrs. Maxwell and her husband, Respondent George Maxwell, filed \r\n  suit against Genez and Doe.  With Genezâ€™s and Doeâ€™s consent, the Maxwells moved \r\n  to have their case stricken from the docket pursuant to Rule 40(j).  On April \r\n  13, 1999, a circuit court judge granted the motion to strike. \r\nOn May 1, 2000, the Maxwells moved to restore the case \r\n  to the docket.  On May 15, 2000, the Maxwells filed a Motion for Enlargement \r\n  of Time pursuant to Rule 6(b) asserting good cause existed to extend the time \r\n  in which to file the motion to restore. \r\nAnother circuit court judge denied the Maxwellsâ€™ motions \r\n  to restore and for an enlargement of time.  The order stated the motion to restore \r\n  was not filed within the one year period provided by Rule 40(j) and the judge \r\n  lacked authority to extend the time period established by the initial judgeâ€™s \r\n  order granting the motion to strike.   \r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded, if good cause exists, Rule \r\n  6(b) permits an extension of time in which to file a Rule 40(j) motion to restore \r\n  and, further, found the Maxwells established good cause for requesting an extension.  \r\n  Id.  The Court of Appeals reversed the order denying the motions to restore \r\n  and for enlargement of time and remanded the matter to the circuit court with \r\n  instructions to restore the case to the docket.  Id.  The Court granted \r\n  both Genezâ€™s and Doeâ€™s petitions for a writ of certiorari.   \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Court of Appeals err by holding a motion to restore under Rule 40(j) \r\n  must be filed within one year of the order striking the claim?  \r\nII.     Did the Court of Appeals err by holding a \r\n  motion to restore under Rule 40(j) may be extended for good cause pursuant to \r\n  Rule 6(b)?  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n&nbsp;In interpreting the meaning of the South \r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court applies the same rules of construction \r\n  used to interpret statutes.  Green v. Lewis Truck Lines, Inc., 314 S.C. \r\n  303, 443 S.E.2d 906 (1994).  If a ruleâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and \r\n  conveys a clear meaning, interpretation is unnecessary and the stated meaning \r\n  should be enforced.  See Knotts v. S.C. Dept. of Natural Resources, \r\n  348 S.C. 1, 558 S.E.2d 511 (2002).  \r\nI.Genez and Doe argue the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred by holding a motion to restore to the docket pursuant to Rule 40(j) must \r\n  be filed within one year of the order granting the motion to strike.  We agree. \r\nRule 40(j), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\r\nCase Stricken from Docket by Agreement.  A party may strike \r\n  its complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim or third party claim from any \r\n  docket one time as a matter of right, provided that all parties adverse \r\n  to that claim, counterclaim, cross-claim or third party claim agree in \r\n  writing that it may be stricken, and all further agree that if the claim is \r\n  restored upon motion made within 1 year of the date stricken, the statute of \r\n  limitations shall be tolled as to all consenting parties during the time the \r\n  case is stricken, and any unexpired portion of the statute of limitations on \r\n  the date the case was stricken shall remain and begin to run on the date that \r\n  the claim is restored.  A party moving to restore a case stricken from the \r\n  docket shall provide all parties notice of the motion to restore at least 10 \r\n  days before it is heard.  Upon being restored, the case shall be placed on the \r\n  General Docket and proceed from that date as provided in this rule.    \r\n\r\n(Underline added).\r\n Rule 40(j) does not require that \r\n  a party move to restore the case to the docket within one year after it was \r\n  stricken.  Instead, the unambiguous language provides that, if the claim \r\n  is restored within one year after it is stricken, the statute of limitations \r\n  is tolled for that period.  [1]   This conclusion is supported \r\n  by the Notes to Rule 40 (â€œRule 40(j) now requires all adverse parties to consent \r\n  to the dismissal in writing, but, the consent also operates to toll the statute \r\n  of limitations for one year after the case is stricken from the docket as to \r\n  each consenting party.â€) and language in Graham v. Dorchester County School \r\n  Dist., 339 S.C. 121, 125, 528 S.E.2d 80, 82 (Ct. App. 2000) (Rule 40(j) \r\n  requires motions to restore within one year of case being stricken â€œto take \r\n  advantage of the tolling of the statute of limitations.â€).  A party can move \r\n  to restore a case to the docket more than one year after the claim was stricken \r\n  without running afoul of Rule 40(j); the party simply cannot take advantage \r\n  of the one year tolling period provided by the rule.  Accordingly, the Court \r\n  of Appeals erred by holding the Maxwells were required to file their motion \r\n  to restore within one year of April 13, 1999.  \r\nII.\r\nGenez and Doe argue the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred by holding the one year deadline established by Rule 40(j) may be extended \r\n  for good cause pursuant to Rule 6(b).  We agree. \r\nRule 6(b), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\r\n (b) Enlargement.  When by these rules or by notice \r\n  given thereunder or by order of court an act is required or allowed to be done \r\n  at or within a specified time, the time may be extended by written \r\n  agreement of counsel for an additional period not exceeding the original time \r\n  provided in these rules, or the court for cause shown may at any time in \r\n  its discretion (1) with or without written motion or notice order the period \r\n  enlarged if request therefore is made before the expiration of the period as \r\n  originally prescribed or extended or (2) upon motion made after the expiration \r\n  of the specified period, for good cause shown, permit the act to be done. \r\n  . . . \r\n\r\n(Underline added).  \r\nRule 6(b) is not applicable to Rule 40(j).  \r\n  The language of Rule 6(b) specifies it applies when there is a deadline.  As \r\n  explained above, Rule 40(j) does not have a deadline during which a motion to \r\n  restore must be filed.  Accordingly, Rule 6(b) is inapplicable. [2] \r\n For the reasons stated above, the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals is REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    The order striking the Maxwellsâ€™ complaint from the docket tracks the language \r\n    of Rule 40(j).    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] We note the Maxwells assert \r\n    that, since Genez and Doe agreed to the Rule 40(j) dismissal after the statute \r\n    of limitations had expired, they waived their right to oppose the motion to \r\n    restore on grounds of the expiration of the statute of limitations.  We disagree.  \r\n    Parties who consent to strike a claim pursuant to Rule 40(j) agree not to \r\n    challenge the statute of limitations for one year.  One year after the Maxwellsâ€™ \r\n    complaint was stricken from the docket pursuant to Rule 40(j), Genez and Doe \r\n    were no longer bound by their agreement not to challenge the Maxwellsâ€™ action \r\n    on statute of limitations grounds.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Rule 406, SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-12-17-01","description":"This order amends Rule 406, SCACR, relating to the disposition of bar admissions fees.","date":"2003-12-22","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntitled Document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court \r\n  of South Carolina  \r\nRE: Rule 406, SCACR\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n  \r\n\r\n Pursuant to Article \r\n  V, &sect; 4, of the South Carolina Constitution, Rule 406, SCACR, is amended \r\n  to read as follows: \r\nRule 406\r\n  Disposition of Fees\r\n\r\n  One fourth of all fees collected \r\n    by the bar admissions office, to include bar application or reinstatement \r\n    fees, shall be remitted by the Judicial Department to the General Fund of \r\n    the State of South Carolina; provided, however, the amount remitted to the \r\n    General Fund in any fiscal year shall not exceed the amount remitted in Fiscal \r\n    Year 2002-2003.
