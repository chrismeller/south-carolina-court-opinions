(Cooperative) could provide\r\n  electric service to an area annexed by the City of Newberry (City).Â  We reverse\r\n  and remand.Â  \r\nFacts/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nThis case concerns\r\n  which electric provider, the City or the Cooperative, has the legal right to\r\n  provide service to approximately 26 acres of land.Â  When Wal-Mart began\r\n  negotiations to construct a store on this site, the area was assigned to the\r\n  Cooperative by the Public Service Commission (PSC), but the Cooperative was not\r\n  providing services to any premises in the area.Â  Wal-Mart wished for its\r\n  property to be annexed into the City, but, nonetheless, wanted to obtain its\r\n  electric services from the Cooperative.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  May 1999, the Cooperative initiated a suit in the PSC to enjoin the City from\r\n  annexing the site and providing electric services.Â  On June 21, 1999, the\r\n  Cooperative and Wal-Mart entered into agreements for Wal-Mart to purchase its\r\n  service from the Cooperative.Â  The following day, the Cooperative voluntarily\r\n  dismissed its case with the PSC as moot because of the service contracts; the\r\n  City agreed to the dismissal.Â  On July 27, 1999, the City annexed the property.\r\nIn\r\n  January 2000, the Cooperative began supplying electric services for the\r\n  construction site.Â  In June 2000, the Cooperative began supplying electric\r\n  services to the completed Wal-Mart store.Â  The City did not object to this\r\n  provision of services until January 2003.Â  On June 2, 2003, the City filed the\r\n  summons and complaint that initiated this action, seeking declaratory relief,\r\n  an injunction, and damages.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court made several findings: (1) the statute of limitations barred the\r\n  City's claim, (2) the City consented to the Cooperative's service, and (3)\r\n  several equitable principles also proscribed the City's requested remedies.Â \r\n  The court of appeals affirmed, holding that the Cooperative had the right to\r\n  continue serving the property because it had a contract with Wal-Mart to\r\n  provide electricity and the City's suit was barred by the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  City of Newberry v. Newberry Elec. Coop., Inc., Op. No.\r\n  2008-UP-200 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 24, 2008).\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nStatutory\r\n  interpretation is a question of law.Â  Â Bryant v. State, 683 S.E.2d 280,\r\n  282 (S.C. 2009).Â  The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain\r\n  and give effect to the intent of the legislature.Â  Id. (citing Mid-State\r\n    Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690,\r\n  692 (1996)). Â Â Â Â \r\nAnalysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Right to Provide Electric\r\n  Service\r\nA.&nbsp; Section 33-49-250\r\nThe\r\n  City argues that once it annexed the property, it had the sole right to provide\r\n  electric service to the property, and any service provided by the Cooperative\r\n  was unlawful.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  Cooperative is purely a creature of statute, and so has only such authority as\r\n  the legislature has granted it under the Electric Cooperative Act, S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§Â§33-49-10, et. seq. (2006 &amp; Supp. 2008).Â  See S.C. Elec.\r\n    &amp; Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 275 S.C. 487, 489, 272 S.E.2d 793, 794\r\n  (1980) (stating that &quot;regulatory bodies are possessed of only those powers\r\n  which are specifically delineated&quot;).\r\nThe\r\n  Electric Cooperative Act provides that an electric cooperative has the\r\n  authority to provide electricity only in rural areas.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250.Â \r\n  Section 33-49-250 provides two exceptions: the &quot;annexation exception&quot;\r\n  and the &quot;principal supplier&quot; exception.Â  The annexation exception\r\n  states that if a cooperative is providing electricity to premises in an area\r\n  that is later annexed by a municipality, that cooperative may &quot;continue\r\n  serving all premises then being served.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250(1).Â \r\n  The principal supplier exception states that if a cooperative is serving a city\r\n  or town of less than 2,500 persons, it will continue to have the right to serve\r\n  that area even if the population later exceeds 2,500 persons.Â  Id.Â  \r\nNeither\r\n  of these exceptions applies here.Â  Although the area had been assigned to the\r\n  Cooperative, the Cooperative was not providing electric service to any premises\r\n  in that area prior to the annexation.[1]Â \r\n  Thus, the Cooperative does not have the right under the statutes to serve the\r\n  Wal-Mart premises.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract for Services\r\nThe\r\n  Cooperative contends, and the court of appeals held, that its service contract\r\n  with Wal-Mart entitles it to continue providing service after annexation.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn City\r\n  of Camden v. Fairfield Electric Cooperative, Inc., this Court held that a\r\n  cooperative did not have the right to serve the premises post-annexation when\r\n  the cooperative was not providing service to any premises pre-annexation.Â  372\r\n  S.C. 543, 643 S.E.2d 687 (2007).Â  In City of Camden, Lowe's was\r\n  planning to build a store in an unassigned area and had chosen Fairfield\r\n  Electric Cooperative (Fairfield) as its supplier.Â  However, the City of Camden\r\n  annexed the property, and at the time of annexation, Fairfield was furnishing\r\n  electric service only to a security light on the unimproved lot.Â  This Court\r\n  held that the statutes require a cooperative to be serving electricity to a\r\n  &quot;premises&quot; prior to annexation, and that a security light is not a\r\n  &quot;premises&quot; as defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-610(2).[2]Â \r\n  This Court determined that a security light was not a structure within the\r\n  contemplation of the annexation exception of section 33-49-250.Â  Because\r\n  Fairfield could not satisfy one of the statutory exceptions, this Court held\r\n  that it had no legal right to serve the annexed property.\r\nHere,\r\n  the court of appeals determined that City of Camden is not controlling\r\n  because: (1) the property was unassigned in that case, whereas the property in\r\n  the instant case was assigned, and (2) Lowe's had merely selected Fairfield for\r\n  its future service, but in this case Wal-Mart and the Cooperative entered into\r\n  a contract for services.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals incorrectly distinguished City of Camden, which is\r\n  controlling here.Â  First, the fact of assignment is irrelevant to the present\r\n  analysis.Â  Clearly, pre-annexation the Cooperative had the legal right to serve\r\n  the area.Â  However, after annexation the Cooperative could only provide service\r\n  if it met one of the two explicit exceptions in section 33-49-250, which it did\r\n  not. Â \r\nSecond,\r\n  contrary to the court of appeals' conclusion, a contract to provide services to\r\n  a building that will exist sometime in the future does not function as\r\n  &quot;existing service&quot; under the statutes to trigger the annexation\r\n  exception.Â  Section 33-49-250 clearly requires existing electrical service to\r\n  existing premises at the time of annexation.Â  The plain language of the statute\r\n  simply does not allow the result reached by the court of appeals.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  the clear language of the section 33-49-250, the court of appeals determined\r\n  section 58-27-670(1)[3] &quot;precludes the City from interfering with an existing contract for\r\n  services.&quot;Â  This analysis is incorrect.Â  In City of Camden, this\r\n  Court was concerned that allowing Fairfield to provide service to the annexed\r\n  area would &quot;allow cooperative providers to effectively circumvent the\r\n  statutory scheme set up by the Legislature simply by placing security lights in\r\n  any areas in which it has distribution lines.&quot;Â  372 S.C. at 549, 645\r\n  S.E.2d at 690.Â  If we followed the court of appeals' analysis, we would be\r\n  allowing cooperatives to simply contract around a municipality's\r\n  post-annexation rights as established by the Legislature, a situation very\r\n  similar to the one we aimed to avoid in City of Camden.Â  Thus, we reiterate\r\n  our central holding in City of Camden that a cooperative must be\r\n  providing existing electrical services to an existing premises prior to\r\n  annexation to continue serving that premises after annexation.Â  Otherwise, the\r\n  cooperative does not satisfy the annexation exception.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the Cooperative only had a contract for services and was not\r\n  actually providing electricity to the completed premises at the time of\r\n  annexation.Â  Therefore, we hold the City has the legal right to serve the\r\n  annexed area because the Cooperative was not providing service to existing\r\n  premises at the time of annexation.\r\nII.&nbsp; Statute of Limitations\r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals held the three year statute of limitations found in S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 applies to this action, and the statute began running when the\r\n  City annexed the property.Â  To the extent a statute of limitations applies\r\n  here, we find it did not begin running until the Cooperative began providing\r\n  service to the completed store.\r\nTo\r\n  hold otherwise, as the dissent urges, would mark a departure from our current\r\n  jurisprudence.Â  We have repeatedly held that a statute of limitations begins to\r\n  run when the party either knew or should have known that some legal right had\r\n  been invaded.Â  See Epstein v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372, 376, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 816, 818 (2005) (stating a statute of limitations begins to run when a\r\n  party through the exercise of reasonable diligence would be put on notice that\r\n  a legal right had been invaded); Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360,\r\n  363, 468 S.E. 2d 645, 647 (1996) (&quot;The statute runs from the date the\r\n  injured party either knows or should have known by the exercise of reasonable\r\n  diligence that a cause of action arises from the wrongful conduct.&quot;); Johnston\r\n    v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 61, 64, 437 S.E.2d 45, 47 (1993) (&quot;[T]he injured\r\n  party must act with some promptness where facts and circumstances of the injury\r\n  would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right\r\n  of his had been invaded or that some claim against another party might\r\n  exist.&quot;).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  dissent concedes the Cooperative was not serving Wal-Mart when the premises\r\n  were annexed.Â  Nevertheless, the dissent would hold that at the time of\r\n  annexation, the City was on notice that the Cooperative &quot;had taken steps\r\n  to invade the rights of the City.&quot;Â  Such a holding would turn our\r\n  jurisprudence on its head, requiring parties to bring suit to defend rights that\r\n  had not yet been invaded and ask the courts to intervene when injurious conduct\r\n  is merely threatened and has not yet occurred.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the City's exclusive right to provide electricity to the annexed premises was\r\n  not invaded until the Cooperative exceeded its statutory grant of authority and\r\n  began serving the premises.Â  Thus, the City suffered no injury before that date\r\n  and could not have brought suit.Â  Therefore, the City's suit is not barred by\r\n  the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we reverse the court of appeals.Â Â  Â Â \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur. KITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â \r\n  The City of Newberry annexed the property in question (the Wal-Mart property)\r\n  on July 27, 1999.Â  I agree with the majority that because Newberry Electric\r\n  Cooperative was not serving the Wal-Mart property on the date of annexation,\r\n  the City of Newberry had the exclusive statutory right to provide electric\r\n  service to the property.Â  In my judgment, the City lost its right to provide\r\n  electric service by failing to assert its claim within the statutory period of\r\n  limitations.Â  Based on the facts and circumstances presented, the three-year\r\n  statute of limitations began on July 27, 1999.Â  The City commenced this action\r\n  on June 2, 2003.Â  Because I believe the City of Newberry filed this action\r\n  beyond the statute of limitations, I vote to affirm the court of appeals\r\n  decision in result.\r\nI agree with the\r\n  majority in its analysis of South Carolina Code section 33-49-250.Â  The\r\n  annexation exception portion of the statute only allows a cooperative that\r\n  &quot;is serving&quot; an area to continue serving that area after annexation.Â \r\n  The majority's interpretation is in accord with the clear and unambiguous terms\r\n  of the statute and is consistent with our holding in City of Camden v.\r\n    Fairfield Electric Cooperative, Inc., 372 S.C. 543, 643 S.E.2d 687 (2007).Â \r\n  I additionally agree with the majority that the fact that the area was assigned\r\n  to the Cooperative has no bearing on the applicability of the annexation\r\n  exception.\r\nNonetheless, I\r\n  believe the three-year statute of limitations bars the City's claim against the\r\n  Cooperative.Â  Statutes of limitations are not simply technicalities; rather, they have long been\r\n  respected as fundamental to a well-ordered judicial system.Â  Moates v. Bobb, 322 S.C. 172, 176, 470 S.E.2d 402, 404 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996).Â  Statutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\r\n  stimulate activity, punish negligence, and promote repose by giving security\r\n  and stability to human affairs.Â  Anonymous\r\n    Taxpayer v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 377\r\n  S.C. 425, 438, 661 S.E.2d 73, 80 (2008).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  the court of appeals recognized, the City relied on the applicable statutes for\r\n  its exclusive right to provide electric service to Wal-Mart.Â  Under South\r\n  Carolina Code section 15-3-530(2), a party must assert &quot;an action upon a\r\n  liability created by a statute&quot; within three years. Â Under the discovery rule, the statute of\r\n  limitations begins to run from the date the injured party either knows or\r\n  should know, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action\r\n  exists for the wrongful conduct.Â  Epstein v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372, 376,\r\n  610 S.E.2d 816, 818 (2005).Â  The exercise of reasonable diligence means simply\r\n  that an injured party must act with some promptness where the facts and\r\n  circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience\r\n  on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against\r\n  another party might exist.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn this case, it\r\n  became common knowledge in late 1998 and early 1999 that Wal-Mart intended to\r\n  build a new store on the property and that the Cooperative and the City both\r\n  wanted to provide electric service to the future structure.Â  On May 28, 1999,\r\n  the Cooperative filed a complaint with the Public Service Commission (PSC)\r\n  seeking an injunction prohibiting the City from providing electric service to\r\n  the Wal-Mart site.Â  On June 11, the PSC issued a cease and desist order against\r\n  the City, thereby prohibiting it from attempting to supply the site with\r\n  service until a hearing on the merits could be held.\r\nOn\r\n  June 18, the Cooperative initiated an action in the circuit court seeking an\r\n  injunction prohibiting the City from annexing the Wal-Mart property and\r\n  prohibiting the City from requiring Wal-Mart to choose the City as the service\r\n  provider as a condition for receiving other municipal services.Â  This action\r\n  was later dismissed by consent of the parties.\r\nOn\r\n  June 21, 1999, the Cooperative and Wal-Mart entered into a contract in which\r\n  the Cooperative agreed to provide Wal-Mart electric service.Â  In accordance\r\n  with the June 21 service contract, the Cooperative began clearing land and\r\n  relocating electric poles and power lines.Â  The following day, lawyers on\r\n  behalf of the Cooperative and the City mailed a letter to the PSC on behalf of\r\n  the Cooperative and the City informing it that &quot;[t]he issues raised in the\r\n  Petition and Complaint in the above matter have been resolved, and this matter\r\n  is now moot.&quot;Â  The Cooperative and the City submitted a proposed consent\r\n  order of dismissal signed by counsel for the parties.Â  The order of dismissal\r\n  was signed by the PSC and filed on August 4, 1999. \r\nOn\r\n  July 26, 1999, the developer sent a letter to the City stating that it intended\r\n  to select the City as the electric service provider for areas surrounding the\r\n  Wal-Mart store.Â  Significantly, however, the developer specifically stated,\r\n  &quot;please bear in mind that this letter should not be construed to include\r\n  the Wal-Mart store . . . as a part of the contract for electric service.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  next day, on July 27, 1999, the City annexed the entire property.Â  The City\r\n  knew on the annexation date that the Cooperative had not begun furnishing\r\n  electric service to any premises on the property.\r\nIn my view, on\r\n  July 27, 1999, the date of annexation, the City was on notice that it had the\r\n  exclusive right to provide electric service to the Wal-Mart property.Â  The City\r\n  knew or should have known the Cooperative could not avail itself of the\r\n  annexation exception, yet the City knew of the Cooperative's very visible\r\n  efforts to promptly move forward with its plan to provide electric service to\r\n  the annexed property.Â  Therefore, under these facts and circumstances, on the\r\n  date of annexation, the City was on notice that the Cooperative had taken steps\r\n  to invade the rights of the City.Â  Accordingly, I would hold that the statute\r\n  of limitations began to run on July 27, 1999. \r\nThe\r\n  City argues it first discovered it had a claim against the Cooperative on\r\n  January 6, 2003, the day the court of appeals issued its opinion in City of\r\n    Newberry v. Newberry Electric Cooperative, Inc., 352 S.C. 570, 575 S.E.2d\r\n  83 (Ct. App. 2003) (commonly referred to as the &quot;Burger King&quot;\r\n  case).Â  In essence, the City asserts it discovered its rights in the Burger\r\n    King decision.\r\nI\r\n  reject the City's position for two, independent reasons.Â  First, the City's\r\n  right to provide electricity is not dependent on the holding of Burger\r\n    King.Â  Because the Cooperative was not &quot;serving&quot; Wal-Mart on the\r\n  date of annexation, the City's exclusive right to serve the Wal-Mart property was established pursuant to the statutory\r\n  scheme.Â  This Court's 2007 opinion in City of Camden v.\r\n    Fairfield Electric Cooperative, as the majority compellingly demonstrates,\r\n  confirmed existing law and did not mark a departure from it.Â  Second, the\r\n  discovery rule may be invoked to delay the commencement of a statute of\r\n  limitations based on the discovery of facts, not the discovery of law.Â  See Burgess v. American Cancer Soc'y., S.C. Div.,\r\n    Inc., 300\r\n  S.C. 182, 386 S.E.2d 798 (Ct. App. 1989) (observing that under\r\n  thediscovery rule, the\r\n  statute of limitations begins to run when &quot;such facts as would have led to\r\n  the knowledge&quot; of a potential claim).[4]\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the City's complaint in this matter also shows that it was well aware of its\r\n  rights at the time of annexation.Â  In its complaint, the City alleges the\r\n  Cooperative could not look to the annexation exception as a source for\r\n  authority to provide service because the Cooperative was not providing service\r\n  to the Wal-Mart property at the time of annexation.Â  In fact, the City argued\r\n  &quot;the Cooperative was aware that annexation would preclude its authority to\r\n  provide electric service&quot; in its brief to the trial court.Â  Additionally,\r\n  in its reply to the Cooperative's counterclaim, the City specifically averred\r\n  that &quot;upon annexation, [the Cooperative] lost its statutory authority to\r\n  enter and agree to a contract to provide electric service to Wal-Mart under the\r\n  law of South Carolina.Â  Further responding the City would show that upon its\r\n    annexation it acquired the exclusive rights to provide electric service to\r\n  the subject tract on which Wal-Mart is located.&quot; (emphasis added).\r\nIn\r\n  my view, the City's assertions in the pleadings show that it was aware of all\r\n  of the necessary facts at the time of annexation.Â  I would reject the City's\r\n  transparent attempt to delay the start of the statute of limitations until its\r\n  purported discovery of the law.Â  See Epstein, 363\r\n  S.C. at 376, 610 S.E.2d at 818 (noting that the\r\n  statute begins to run at the point of discovery of facts and not when advice of\r\n  counsel is sought or a full-blown theory of recovery is developed).Â Â Â  \r\nIn my judgment, effective July 27, 1999, the City had three years\r\n  to assert its right to provide electrical service to the Wal-Mart property.Â \r\n  Having failed to do so, the City's action is time barred.Â  I vote to affirm the\r\n  court of appeals in result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties argue only the annexation exception; the principal supplier\r\n  exception is not at issue in this case.\r\n[2] This section defines a &quot;premises&quot; as a &quot;building, structure or\r\n  facility.&quot;\r\n[3] This section provides:\r\n\r\n\tAnnexation may\r\n  not be construed to increase, decrease, or affect any other right or\r\n  responsibility a municipality, electric cooperative, or electric utility may\r\n  have with regard to supplying electric service in areas assigned by the Public\r\n  Service Commission in accordance with Chapter 27 of Title 58.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  58-27-670(1) (Supp. 2007).\r\n[4]&nbsp; Misinterpretation of the law does not toll the statute\r\n  of limitations.Â  On June 21, 1999, Charles Guerry, the Utility Director for the\r\n  City, executed an affidavit in which he stated the City was not requiring\r\n  Wal-Mart to accept electric service as a condition for receiving other\r\n  municipal services, and that &quot;it is the City's position that annexation of\r\n  the property would enable Wal-Mart to select the City as its electric service\r\n  provider.&quot;Â  Although the position that Wal-Mart had a right to choose its\r\n  provider was contrary to the law, the City's erroneous position has no bearing\r\n  on the statute of limitations. Â See 54 C.J.S. Limitations of Actions Â§ 116 (2009) (&quot;Mere\r\n  ignorance of the existence of a cause of action . . . generally does not\r\n  prevent the running of a statute of limitations.&quot;); Miller v.

Lloyd, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26796\r\nHeard October 8, 2009 - Filed April 5,\r\n  2010Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDeputy\r\n  Chief Appellate Defender Wanda H. Carter, of South Carolina Commission on\r\n  Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Mary S.\r\n  Williams, of Columbia; and John Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  In this case, we granted a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the court of appeals' decision affirming the post-conviction relief\r\n  (PCR) judge's denial of relief.Â  We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nTommy Hutto\r\n  (Petitioner) broke into a 91-year old woman's home, cutting his arms and hands\r\n  on the glass in the back door.Â  Once inside, Petitioner sexually assaulted and\r\n  robbed the victim.Â  After he left her home, the victim notified the police, but\r\n  Petitioner was neither identified nor caught at that time.Â  About a month later, Ronnie Bends, Petitioner's probation agent from a previous conviction, went\r\n  to Petitioner's home on a routine visit.Â  Agent James Harris accompanied Agent\r\n  Bends.Â  During the visit, Agent Harris noticed the cuts on Petitioner's arms.\r\nHubert Nimau, the\r\n  officer investigating the assault and robbery, received a tip about the crime\r\n  from a crime watcher's newspaper article.Â  Investigator Nimau questioned other\r\n  officers, asking if they had seen anyone with cuts on his arms and hands.Â \r\n  Investigator Nimau asked Agent Bends, who then called Agent Harris into his\r\n  office to describe the injuries he had observed on Petitioner.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  receiving the information from both Agent Harris and the crime watcher's tip,\r\n  Investigator Nimau included Petitioner's photograph in a photographic line-up\r\n  shown to the victim.Â  The victim identified Petitioner's photograph as the man\r\n  who broke into her house.Â  Based on the victim's identification, Investigator\r\n  Nimau obtained a warrant for Petitioner's blood.Â  DNA samples taken from the\r\n  crime scene matched Petitioner's blood.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  was convicted of armed robbery, first degree criminal sexual conduct, and first\r\n  degree burglary.Â  At trial, Agent Harris had testified about the cuts he\r\n  observed on Petitioner's arms and hands. Petitioner applied for PCR, arguing\r\n  that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress Agent\r\n  Harris's testimony based on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-290 (2007 &amp; Supp. 2008),\r\n  which provides:\r\n\r\n\tAll information and data obtained in the discharge of\r\n  his official duty by a probation agent is privileged information, is not\r\n  receivable as evidence in a court, and may not be disclosed directly or\r\n  indirectly to anyone other than the judge or others entitled under this chapter\r\n  to receive reports unless ordered by the court or the director.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  PCR judge denied Petitioner's request and the court of appeals affirmed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  \r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn\r\n  post-conviction proceedings, the burden of proof is on the applicant to prove\r\n  the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 442,\r\n  334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  On appeal, the PCR court's ruling should be upheld\r\n  if it is supported by any evidence of probative value in the record.Â  Cherry\r\n    v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nCourts\r\n  use a two-pronged test in evaluating allegations of ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); Cherry v.\r\n    State, 300 S.C. 115, 117, 386 S.E.2d 624, 625 (1989).Â  To establish\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel, the applicant must show: (1) counsel's\r\n  representation was deficient, as measured by an objective standard of\r\n  reasonableness, and (2) applicant was prejudiced by counsel's performance, such\r\n  that there is a reasonable probability the outcome of the trial would have been\r\n  different absent the deficiency.Â  Id. at 117-18, 386 S.E.2d at 625.Â  Â Â \r\nI.&nbsp; Deficient Performance\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that trial counsel's performance was deficient in that he failed to move\r\n  to suppress Agent Harris's testimony under section 24-21-290.Â  We disagree.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  contends that this statute makes all information gathered during the execution\r\n  of the probation agentâ€™s duties privileged information.Â  However, we find the\r\n  legislature did not intend this statute to have such a broad application that\r\n  it would cover anything the probation agent sees when visiting his client.Â  We agree\r\n  with the court of appeals' interpretation and believe that the statute's purpose\r\n  is to foster open lines of communication between the probation agent and\r\n  client.Â  We do not believe the legislature intended the statute to cover\r\n  physical observations, such as the one made in this case, that anyone could\r\n  have made when encountering Petitioner.Â  The information obtained was not\r\n  reliant upon the probation agent/client relationship.Â  Preventing a probation\r\n  officer from reporting what he sees during his visit to his client, as the\r\n  State argues, could mean that he would be unable to report evidence of a crime he\r\n  sees in his clientâ€™s home.Â  Such a result is neither intended by the\r\n  legislature nor necessary to further the goals of the statute.\r\nII.&nbsp; Prejudice\r\nEven if counsel's performance were deficient, Petitioner\r\n  was not prejudiced.Â  \r\nPetitioner argues that both Agent Harris's trial\r\n  testimony and his disclosure of Petitioner's cuts to Investigator Nimau\r\n  violated the privilege contained in section 24-21-290.Â  Petitioner further\r\n  contends that trial counsel's allegedly deficient performance in not knowing\r\n  the statute allowed the presentation at trial of testimony and evidence that\r\n  was not properly admissible, without which there would be no evidence linking\r\n  Petitioner to the crime.Â  We address each of these arguments in turn.\r\nA.&nbsp; Trial Testimony\r\nTo show prejudice, a defendant must demonstrate there\r\n  is a reasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different\r\n  absent trial counsel's deficient performance.Â  Id. at 117-18, 386 S.E.2d\r\n  at 625.Â  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine\r\n  confidence in the outcome of the trial.Â  Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182,\r\n  183, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997). Â No prejudice occurs, despite deficient\r\n  performance, when there is overwhelming evidence of guilt.Â  Rosemond v.\r\n    Catoe, 383 S.C. 320, 325, 680 S.E.2d 5, 8 (2009).\r\nAssuming that trial counsel's performance had been\r\n  deficient for failing to suppress Agent Harris's testimony, Petitioner suffered\r\n  no prejudice because even without Agent Harris's testimony there was\r\n  overwhelming evidence of Petitioner's guilt.Â  First, the victim identified\r\n  Petitioner's photograph as showing the man who assaulted and robbed her.Â \r\n  Second, based on the victim's identification, the police obtained a search\r\n  warrant for Petitioner's blood.Â  Third, the DNA obtained from Petitioner's\r\n  blood sample matched the DNA from blood taken from the crime scene.Â  There can\r\n  be no reasonable probability that a jury confronted with this body of evidence would\r\n  have returned anything other than a guilty verdict. Â Â Â Â \r\nBecause the victim's identification and the results of\r\n  the DNA testing constitute evidence, in the face of which, no reasonable jury\r\n  would find Petitioner not guilty, Petitioner cannot show that the\r\n  outcome of his trial reasonably might have been different if Agent Harris's\r\n  testimony were excluded.Â  Therefore, Petitioner was not prejudiced by counsel's\r\n  failing to move to suppress Agent Harris's testimony under section 24-21-290.\r\nB.&nbsp; Disclosure to Investigator\r\n  Nimau\r\nPetitioner argues: (1) section 24-21-290 was violated\r\n  when Agent Harris told Investigator Nimau about the cuts on Petitioner's arms\r\n  and hands; and (2) that this statutory exclusion applies to both the victim's\r\n  identification of Petitioner in the final photographic line-up and the DNA\r\n  evidence because they only could be obtained by a violation of the privilege\r\n  created by the statute in question.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile we do not believe Agent Harris's disclosure\r\n  violates the statute, assuming arguendo there was a violation, such\r\n  violation would not warrant the exclusion of the evidence obtained from the\r\n  information disclosed.Â  Section 24-21-290 only creates a statutory privilege\r\n  and does not implicate a constitutional right; therefore, the exclusionary rule\r\n  does not apply.Â  See State v. Chandler, 267 S.C. 138, 143, 226 S.E.2d\r\n  553, 555 (1976) (&quot;[E]xclusion of evidence should be limited to violations\r\n  of constitutional rights and not to statutory violations . . . .&quot;).Â  \r\nFurther, Agent Harris' disclosure was not the sole piece\r\n  of information that led to the victim's identification and the subsequent DNA\r\n  evidence.Â  The crimewatchers tip was also relied upon in including Petitioner's\r\n  photograph in the line-up.Â  The victim's identification and the DNA evidence\r\n  are pieces of evidence independent from Agent Harris' disclosure because his\r\n  disclosure was not the only source that led to the evidence.Â  Thus, they are in\r\n  no way infected by the alleged statutory privilege issue and are properly\r\n  admissible.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor these reasons,\r\n  we affirm the court of appeals' decision denying Petitioner post-conviction\r\n  relief. \r\nWALLER,\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, trial counsel's\r\n  performance did not meet prevailing professional norms, and that deficient\r\n  performance prejudiced petitioner.Â  McKnight v. State, 378 S.C. 33, 661\r\n  S.E.2d 354 (2008).Â  I would therefore reverse the order which denied petitioner\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  \r\nPetitioner's\r\n  PCR claim rests on two instances of allegedly ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel: first, trial counsel's failure to object to Agent Harris's testimony\r\n  at trial, and second, his failure to object to the admissibility of the\r\n  victim's identification of petitioner both in and out of court, as well as the\r\n  DNA evidence.Â  Petitioner contends that this evidence was barred by S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 24-21-190 and would have been excluded had trial counsel objected.Â  I\r\n  agree.\r\nThe\r\n  statute explicitly bars Agent Harris's trial testimony, as Â§ 24-21-290 renders\r\n  &quot;information and data obtained in the discharge of his official duty by a\r\n  probation officer&quot; &quot;not receivable as evidence in a court&quot;\r\n  unless permission to disclose is granted by the trial judge or the director.Â \r\n  No such permission was sought or granted here.Â  It is unclear whether the\r\n  majority finds Agent Harris's testimony objectionable since it holds that the\r\n  statutory terms &quot;information and data&quot; do not include anything\r\n  observed by the probation agent.Â  Unlike the majority, however, I do not see\r\n  anything in the statute which exempts &quot;information and data&quot;\r\n  perceived by the officer's sense of sight from its ambit.Â  It seems to me that\r\n  if the statute were intended to create a privilege only as to statements made\r\n  by the probationer to his agent, it would say just that.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  majority expresses concern that if the statute makes observations privileged,\r\n  then a probation officer who observed evidence of a crime while conducting a\r\n  home visit would be prevented from reporting that evidence.Â  However, nothing\r\n  in the statute prevents such a report as the majority suggests, rather Â§\r\n  24-21-290 simply requires that the probation officer first be &quot;ordered&quot;\r\n  to disclose the information and/or data by a court or the director, or relay it\r\n  to &quot;others entitled . . . to receive [his] reports . . . .&quot;Â  The\r\n  statute recognizes that there will be situations where, on balance, the\r\n  privilege must yield to policy, and provides a mechanism for disclosure.Â  For\r\n  whatever reason, Agent Harris did not follow that procedure here, and the\r\n  &quot;information and data&quot; remained privileged.Â  In my view, making the\r\n  confidences between a probationer and his agent presumptively privileged furthers\r\n  the legislative goal of &quot;fostering open lines of communication.&quot;\r\nMoreover,\r\n  I am concerned that the majority dismisses any prejudice from Agent Harris's\r\n  trial testimony by finding it harmless based on the evidence derived from Agent\r\n  Harris's improper disclosure to Inspector Nimau.Â  As explained below, the\r\n  victim's photo line-up identification of petitioner and the subsequent DNA\r\n  testing of his blood were the direct result of Agent Harris's breach of the\r\n  statutory privilege, not as the majority holds, &quot;independent from Agent\r\n  Harris's disclosure.&quot;Â  The record reveals that after the crime occurred on\r\n  July 16, the investigating officer put out a &quot;Be On the Lookout&quot;\r\n  (BOLO) for an individual with cuts on his forearms.Â  The victim was shown two\r\n  photographic lineups in July, but was unable to identify anyone.Â  The persons\r\n  included in these lineups were &quot;subjects generated through crime\r\n  watchers.&quot; Although petitioner was apparently named in a tip to crime\r\n  watchers, no action was taken on this information until after Inspector Nimau\r\n  spoke with Agent Harris in early August. &quot;Based on this information, Nimau\r\n  compiled a third photographic line-up, which he presented to the victim on\r\n  August 19 . . . .&quot;Â  State v. Hutto, Op. No. 2002-UP-395 (S.C. Ct.\r\n  App. filed June 4, 2002). Â Relying on the victim's August 19 identification of\r\n  petitioner, Nimau executed an affidavit relating Harris's observations and the\r\n  victim's subsequent identification in order to obtain a search warrant for a\r\n  blood sample from petitioner. Â Id.\r\nThe statute not\r\n  only explicitly bars Agent Harris's trial testimony, but also bars the\r\n  disclosure of &quot;all information and data&quot; obtained &quot;directly or\r\n  indirectly [from him] to anyone other than the judge or others entitled under\r\n  this chapter to receive reports&quot; absent permission.Â  Â§ 24-21-290.Â  Here,\r\n  there was no permission sought or granted before Agent Harris was questioned by\r\n  Investigator Nimau.Â  In my view, the resulting identification by the victim and\r\n  the DNA evidence found as the result of the warrant issued after her\r\n  identification is &quot;information and data&quot; obtained indirectly as a\r\n  result of Agent Harris's unlawful disclosure to Investigator Nimau, and\r\n  therefore privileged under Â§ 24-21-290.\r\nAs we held in State\r\n  v. Hook, 356 S.C. 421, 590 S.E.2d 25 (2003), the construction of the\r\n  privilege in Â§ 24-21-290 is a question of legislative intent, not\r\n  constitutional law.Â  The purpose of the statutory privilege is clear:Â  to\r\n  encourage an atmosphere in which there is open communication and cooperation\r\n  between a probationer and his probation agent.Â  The statute expressly states that\r\n  information and data obtained in the discharge of the agent's duty is &quot;not\r\n  receivable as evidence in court,&quot; and thus the evidentiary exclusion\r\n  arises from the terms of the statute creating the privilege, not the\r\n  application of the exclusionary rule. To permit information or data obtained\r\n  directly or indirectly as a result of a violation of the statute to be received\r\n  as evidence in court defeats the legislative intent in creating this privilege. \r\nBecause\r\n  the statute bars disclosure of &quot;information and data&quot; without an\r\n  order of the court or director, whether directly or indirectly, and because the\r\n  victim's identification of petitioner in the photo lineup, the DNA evidence,\r\n  and the victim's in-court identification were not obtained &quot;independent&quot;\r\n  of Agent Harris's unlawful disclosure, I would hold that this evidence cannot\r\n  be received &quot;as evidence in a court.&quot;Â  Any other ruling, in my view,\r\n  invites probation officers to violate the statutory privilege by disclosing the\r\n  information and data to third persons not otherwise entitled to it, without\r\n  first being &quot;ordered&quot; to do so.Â  Under the interpretation adopted by\r\n  the majority today, these unauthorized persons are then free to present the\r\n  evidence in court.\r\nIn\r\n  my view, petitioner was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance since had\r\n  an objection been made it should have been sustained.Â  I would reverse the\r\n  denial of petitioner's application for PCR, finding both that counsel's\r\n  performance was deficient and that petitioner was prejudiced thereby.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26797","title":"Ward v.

West Oil Co., 379 S.C. 225, 665 S.E.2d\r\n  618 (Ct. App. 2008), in which the Court of Appeals affirmed the special master's\r\n  award of $5,067.31 in damages to R&amp;B for its breach of contract action\r\n  against West Oil Company, Inc., d/b/a Markette Stores (&quot;West Oil&quot;).Â  Because\r\n  we find the parties' contract is void ab initio, we vacate the decisions\r\n  of the special master and the Court of Appeals and dismiss with prejudice R&amp;B's\r\n  breach of contract action.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nCharles Ward and Robby Hodge own and operate R&amp;B,\r\n  which provides games and gambling machines to businesses.Â  In September 2001,\r\n  they sought to place &quot;pull-tab&quot; game machines[1] in Markette convenience stores owned by West Oil.Â  The machines sold tickets,\r\n  called &quot;Pots of Gold,&quot; with the potential for winning prizes.Â  On\r\n  September 11, 2001, Ward and Hodge met with Alexander West, Jr. (West), the\r\n  President of West Oil, and Camp Segars (Segars), the Director of Operations for\r\n  West Oil, to discuss placing machines in a number of Markette stores.Â  \r\nAt the meeting, Ward and Hodge gave West Oil an\r\n  overview of the machines and presented West Oil with a form contract, which\r\n  they had obtained from their &quot;pull-tab&quot; machine supplier.Â  The\r\n  typewritten contract consisted of eleven paragraphs.Â  As part of the agreement,\r\n  West Oil agreed to initially place the machines at four of its convenience\r\n  stores.Â  During the remaining discussions, the parties negotiated the following\r\n  changes to the contract:Â  (1) the payout scheme; (2) a reduction of the term of\r\n  the contract from three years to one year; and (3) a requirement that R&amp;B\r\n  pay West Oil a $500 up-front placement fee for each machine that they\r\n  installed.Â  R&amp;B also agreed to absorb the $180 cost of the tickets in the\r\n  machines.Â  \r\nOn September 13, 2001, Ward, Hodge, and Segars met to\r\n  execute the contract.Â  Ward and Hodge had revised the contract to conform to the\r\n  parties' discussions during the initial meeting.Â  Paragraph 7 of the\r\n  typewritten contract provided for liquidated damages in the event of a breach.Â \r\n  Segars added a handwritten provision to the top of the contract that was\r\n  initialed by Segars, Hodge, and Ward. Â This provision stated:Â  \r\n\r\n\tAddition * In [the] event of contract termination, up front placement money will be\r\n  re-imbursed [sic] at pro-rated time with no penalties to either party of this\r\n  contract.Â  This is added this day September 13th 2001.Â  \r\n\r\nWithin two days of\r\n  signing the contract, R&amp;B placed the machines in four Markette stores, as\r\n  specified in the contract.Â  Because these machines performed well, the parties\r\n  orally agreed to place machines in thirteen additional stores.Â  With the\r\n  placement of each machine, R&amp;B paid West Oil the agreed-upon placement fee\r\n  of $500.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  each ticket machine held a total of $4,800 worth of &quot;red&quot; tickets at\r\n  a time.Â  After the red tickets sold out, R&amp;B would remove the proceeds, pay\r\n  the portion due to West Oil, and refill the machine with red tickets. [2]Â  \r\nIn\r\n  late 2001, R&amp;B approached Segars to discuss changing the game from red\r\n  tickets to &quot;green&quot; tickets known as &quot;Jackpots,&quot; which had\r\n  different values and payouts.Â  Segars agreed to allow R&amp;B to change from\r\n  red tickets to green tickets at one store with the stipulation that if the new\r\n  cards were successful, he would consider changing the cards in all of the\r\n  stores.\r\nÂ In February\r\n  2002, in a meeting of store managers, Segars and West discovered that R&amp;B\r\n  had replaced the red tickets with green tickets in several store locations\r\n  other than the originally-designated store.Â  After Segars told West that he had\r\n  only authorized R&amp;B to replace the cards in the one store, West became\r\n  angry and told Segars that he wanted all of the machines removed from all of\r\n  the stores.Â  West instructed Segars to leave the meeting to phone R&amp;B and\r\n  direct them to remove their machines from all West Oil stores.Â  With thirty-one\r\n  weeks remaining on the contract, R&amp;B complied with West Oil's request and\r\n  removed the machines. \r\nShortly thereafter, R&amp;B filed suit against West\r\n  Oil for breach of contract.Â  The parties consented to have the matter decided\r\n  by a special master.Â  Following a bench trial, the special master issued a\r\n  written order in which he concluded:\r\n\r\n\tThe court finds that a written, enforceable contract\r\n  existed for the initial four ticket machines.Â  The contract was terminated.Â \r\n  Under the handwritten Addition to the contract:Â  &quot;In the event of contract\r\n  termination, up front placement money will be reimbursed at pro-rated time with\r\n  no penalties to either party of this contract.&quot;Â  The up front placement\r\n  money was $500 per machine.Â  This also applied for the thirteen additional\r\n  machines that were added at other locations.Â  Therefore, [R&amp;B] initially\r\n  paid [West Oil] $8,500 in up front placement money.Â  Under [R&amp;B's]\r\n  calculations, the machines were in place for twenty-one weeks.Â  Therefore,\r\n  [R&amp;B] [is] entitled to be reimbursed the pro-rated portion of the up front\r\n  placement money, which equals $5,067.31.Â  \r\n\r\nIn a unanimous\r\n  decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the special master's order in its\r\n  entirety.Â  Ward v. West Oil Co., 379 S.C. 225, 665 S.E.2d 618 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  After the Court of Appeals denied R&amp;B's petition for rehearing, this\r\n  Court granted R&amp;B's petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nIn our\r\n  order granting R&amp;B's petition for a writ of certiorari, we directed the\r\n  parties to brief the question of whether the &quot;pull-tab&quot; game machines\r\n  at issue in this case constitute illegal gambling devices under section\r\n  12-21-2710 of the South Carolina Code.Â  This section provides in pertinent part:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIt is unlawful for any person to keep on\r\n  his premises or operate or permit to be kept on his premises or operated within\r\n  this State any vending or slot machine, or any video game machine with a free\r\n  play feature operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of value,\r\n  or other device operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of\r\n  value for the play of poker, blackjack, keno, lotto, bingo, or craps, or any\r\n  machine or device licensed pursuant to Section 12-21-2720 and used for gambling\r\n  or any punch board, pull board, or other device pertaining to games\r\n    of chance of whatever name or kind, including those machines, boards, or\r\n  other devices that display different pictures, words, or symbols, at different\r\n  plays or different numbers, whether in words or figures or, which deposit\r\n  tokens or coins at regular intervals or in varying numbers to the player or in\r\n  the machine, but the provisions of this section do not extend to coin-operated nonpayout pin tables, in-line pin games, or to automatic\r\n  weighing, measuring, musical, and vending machines which are constructed as\r\n    to give a certain uniform and fair return in value for each coin deposited and in\r\n    which there is no element of chance.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2710\r\n  (2000) (emphasis added).[3]\r\n&quot;The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain\r\n  and effectuate the intent of the legislature.&quot;Â  Hodges v. Rainey,\r\n  341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  If a statute's language\r\n  is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no\r\n  occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation and\r\n  the Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning. Â Miller v. Doe,\r\n  312 S.C. 444, 447, 441 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1994).Â  \r\n&quot;All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the\r\n  one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered\r\n  in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the\r\n  intended purpose of the statute.&quot; Â Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach\r\n    Election Comm'n, 342 S.C. 373, 380, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â  The Court\r\n  should give words their plain and ordinary meaning, without resort to subtle or\r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.Â  Sloan v.\r\n    S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 469, 636 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  607 (2006).\r\nB.\r\nAs a threshold matter, R&amp;B contends that any challenge as to\r\n  the legality of the &quot;pull-tab&quot; cards and machines should not be\r\n  considered by this Court given this issue was not previously raised or ruled\r\n  upon during the course of the proceedings.Â  \r\nAlthough R&amp;B correctly references our appellate court rules\r\n  regarding error preservation,[4] we find these rules are inapplicable as this Court will not &quot;lend its\r\n  assistance&quot; to carry out the terms of a contract that violates statutory\r\n  law or public policy.Â  See McMullen v. Hoffman, 174 U.S. 639, 654 (1899)\r\n  (&quot;The authorities from the earliest time to the present unanimously hold\r\n  that no court will lend its assistance in any way towards carrying out the\r\n  terms of an illegal contract.Â  In case any action is brought in which it is\r\n  necessary to prove the illegal contract in order to maintain the action, courts\r\n  will not enforce it, nor will they enforce any alleged rights directly\r\n  springing from such contract.&quot;); White v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co.,\r\n  360 S.C. 366, 371, 601 S.E.2d 342, 345 (2004) (&quot;The general rule, well established in South Carolina, is that\r\n  courts will not enforce a contract when the subject matter of the contract or\r\n  an act required for performance violates public policy as\r\n  expressed in constitutional provisions, statutory law, or judicial decisions.&quot;); Beach Co. v. Twillman, Ltd., 351 S.C. 56, 64, 566 S.E.2d 863, 866 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002) (holding that illegal contracts are void and\r\n  unenforceable, such that actions for its breach may not be maintained).\r\nBecause this Court will not enforce an illegal contract, we find\r\n  the question regarding the legality of the &quot;pull-tab&quot; cards and\r\n  machines is appropriate for this Court's review.Â  See Hyta v. Finley,\r\n  53 P.3d 338, 340-41 (Idaho 2002) (holding, in a partnership dissolution action\r\n  involving a bar that primarily profited from illegal gaming machines, appellate\r\n  court could sua sponte raise issue of whether underlying contract was\r\n  illegal); Parente v. Pirozzoli, 866 A.2d 629, 635 (Conn.

Lord, Williston on Contracts Â§ 12:5 at 56-64 (4th ed. 1995))); see\r\n    also 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 323 (2004) (&quot;[I]f a question\r\n  of illegality develops during the course of the trial, a court must consider\r\n  that question, whether pleaded or not.&quot;).[5]\r\nC.\r\nHaving determined the issue is properly before us, we now address\r\n  the merits of the legality question.Â  Applying the above-outlined rules of\r\n  statutory construction in conjunction with this Court's decision in Sun\r\n    Light Prepaid Phonecard Co. v. State, 360 S.C. 49, 600 S.E.2d 61 (2004), we\r\n  find the &quot;pull-tab&quot; cards and game machines constituted illegal\r\n  gambling devices under section 12-21-2710.\r\nIn Sun Light, the Sellers of pre-paid, long distance\r\n  telephone cards and dispensers brought suit against the State following the State's\r\n  seizure of the cards and dispensers.Â  The State had seized these items on the\r\n  ground they constituted illegal gambling devices under section 12-21-2710.Â  Id. at 51, 600 S.E.2d at 62.\r\nIn the declaratory judgment hearing to determine the legality of\r\n  these items, the testimony established that the phone cards, including the game\r\n  pieces, were pre-printed by the manufacturer before they were placed in the\r\n  &quot;Lucky Shamrock&quot; dispenser.Â  The dispenser could not work without a\r\n  roll of phone cards inside.Â  The dispensers were housed within a standard slot\r\n  machine cabinet and contained several features present in a gambling machine as\r\n  opposed to a vending machine.Â  Id. at 51-52, 600 S.E.2d at 62-63.\r\nThe phone cards were printed on rolls containing 7,500 cards.Â \r\n  Attached to each phone card was a game piece that gave the customer a chance to\r\n  win a cash prize.Â  The entire card contained a paper cover, which, when pulled\r\n  back revealed a toll-free number and pin number for activating the phone\r\n  service as well as an array of nine symbols in an &quot;8-liner&quot; format.Â \r\n  If the game piece contained symbols arranged in a certain order, the customer\r\n  would win a prize.Â  The computer that printed the cards randomly generated\r\n  winners on the cards.Â  Id. at 51, 600 S.E.2d at 62.Â  Each card sold for\r\n  $1.00 and gave the customer two minutes of long distance telephone service.Â  Id. at 52, 600 S.E.2d at 63.\r\nAt the conclusion of the declaratory judgment hearing, the circuit\r\n  court held the phone cards and dispensers were illegal gambling devices.Â  Id. at 51, 600 S.E.2d at 62.Â  On appeal, this Court affirmed the circuit court's\r\n  order.Â  \r\nIn so holding, this Court specifically analyzed and applied the\r\n  provisions of section 12-21-2710.Â  Id. at 54-55, 600 S.E.2d at 64-65.Â \r\n  In terms of the phone cards, this Court found &quot;[t]he phone card itself\r\n  contains an element of chance and is a type of gambling device known as a\r\n  pull-tab,&quot; which is illegal under section 12-21-2710.Â  Id. at 54,\r\n  600 S.E.2d at 64.Â  The Court noted that &quot;the phone portion of the cards is\r\n  mere surplusage to the game piece.&quot;Â  Id. at 55, 600 S.E.2d at 64.Â  \r\nThe Court went on to reject the Sellers' argument that the phone\r\n  card dispensers were legal under section 12-21-2710 given they are similar to\r\n  traditional vending machines and provide a uniform return for every dollar\r\n  inserted.Â  Because the phone card rolls were an integral part of the machine\r\n  and present the element of chance in the dispensers, the Court found the\r\n  dispensers violated section 12-21-2710.Â  Id. at 54, 600 S.E.2d at 64.\r\nAdditionally, the Court recognized that the phone card dispensers resembled\r\n  slot machines and not traditional vending machines that are exempted from\r\n  section 12-21-2710.Â  Id. at 55, 600 S.E.2d at 64.Â  The Court explained\r\n  that the dispensers had a gambling-themed video screen, played celebration\r\n  music when a customer won, had a lock-out feature which froze the operation of\r\n  the machine when a pre-determined level of prize money was reached, contained a\r\n  meter that records the value of the prizes paid out, and did not give change.Â  Id.\r\nFinally, because the game pieces were not a &quot;legitimate\r\n  promotion or sweepstakes,&quot; the Court found the dispensers and phone cards\r\n  were not exempt under section 61-4-580[6] of the South Carolina Code.Â  Id. at 56, 600 S.E.2d at 65.Â Â  \r\nApplying the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we hold\r\n  the &quot;pull-tab&quot; cards and the game machines constitute illegal\r\n  gambling devices under section 12-21-2710 as interpreted by this Court in Sun\r\n    Light. \r\nSignificantly, at no point during these proceedings has R&amp;B\r\n  disputed that the game cards at issue in this case are &quot;pull-tabs.&quot; Â Unlike\r\n  the phone cards in Sun Light, the cards were not attached to any\r\n  promotional item or thing of value.Â  Thus, the sole function of the &quot;Pots\r\n  of Gold&quot; and &quot;Jackpot&quot; game cards was to provide a game of\r\n  chance, in the form of a cash prize, to players who deposited a dollar in the\r\n  card dispenser.\r\nAlthough the card dispensers did not resemble &quot;slot\r\n  machines&quot; as those at issue in Sun Light, we find this fact is not dispositive.Â \r\n  We hold the card dispensers and the cards were intrinsically connected in a way\r\n  that deemed them illegal under this Court's decision in Sun Light.Â  \r\nAs in Sun Light, the &quot;pull-tab&quot; cards created an\r\n  element of chance when placed in the dispenser.Â  As testified to by Ward, each\r\n  dispenser contained 4,800 game pieces that were &quot;pre-rated.&quot; Â He\r\n  explained that certain cards were designated as &quot;winners&quot; of various\r\n  sums of money.Â  Therefore, the payout amount and profits were pre-determined by\r\n  a deck of cards placed in the dispensing machines.Â  The machine was designed to\r\n  payout $3,350 per deck of game cards, which translated into a 69.8 payout\r\n  percentage. Â The &quot;Pots of Gold&quot; game had one $1,000 winner and the\r\n  &quot;Jackpot&quot; game had two.\r\nFurthermore, as described by R&amp;B in its brief, there was an\r\n  element of chance in the customer's selection of the tickets in that the\r\n  dispenser contained eight columns or stacks of tickets.Â  Under each column,\r\n  there is a selector button which is pushed to receive a ticket.Â  Thus, there is\r\n  an added level of chance in terms of which column is selected.Â  \r\nTherefore, we conclude the &quot;pull-tab&quot; game machines\r\n  constituted illegal gambling devices under section 12-21-2710.Â  See 38\r\n  C.J.S. Gaming Â§ 10 (Supp. 2010) (defining &quot;gambling device&quot;\r\n  and stating:Â  &quot;[a]n apparatus is a gambling device where there is anything\r\n  of value to be won or lost as the result of chance, no matter how small the\r\n  intrinsic value&quot;; &quot;they are gaming devices if used or intended for\r\n  gaming, but otherwise they are not, and generally the courts will look behind\r\n  the name and style of the device to ascertain its true character&quot;); State\r\n    v. 158 Gaming Devices, 499 A.2d 940, 951 (Md. 1985) (&quot;The three\r\n  elements of gamblingâ€”consideration, chance and rewardâ€”are thus clearly present\r\n  in a device which, for a price, and based upon chance, offers a monetary or\r\n  merchandise reward to the successful player.&quot;). \r\nAdditionally, we disagree with R&amp;B's argument that the\r\n  decision in Sun Light should not be determinative of the instant case. Â In\r\n  essence, R&amp;B claims that it could not have anticipated the result in Sun\r\n    Light at the time it entered into the contract with West Oil.Â  Consequently,\r\n  it should not be precluded from pursuing its breach of contract action against\r\n  West Oil.\r\nSection 12-21-2710 clearly provides that &quot;pull boards,&quot; i.e.,\r\n  &quot;pull-tabs,&quot; constitute illegal gambling devices.Â  Unlike the phone\r\n  cards in Sun Light, there is no dispute that the cards at issue were\r\n  strictly &quot;pull tabs&quot; given there was no attached promotional item or\r\n  thing of value.Â  Thus, because section 12-21-2710 became effective\r\n  approximately one year before the parties entered into the contract, R&amp;B\r\n  was not required to be clairvoyant regarding the legality of the &quot;Pots of\r\n  Gold&quot; or the &quot;Jackpot&quot; tickets.Â  Furthermore, in view of the\r\n  existence of this statute, we do not believe R&amp;B can legitimately claim\r\n  reliance on the assurances of their &quot;pull-tab&quot; game supplier that the\r\n  cards and dispensers were legal.[7]\r\nFinally, we reject R&amp;B's contention that West Oil will\r\n  unjustly profit if the parties' contract is deemed illegal.Â  Specifically,\r\n  R&amp;B claimed at oral argument that West Oil will be absolved of its\r\n  contractual obligations even though it retained the profits from the sale of\r\n  the &quot;pull-tab&quot; cards.Â  Admittedly, a decision to void the contract\r\n  eliminates the parties' obligations under the contract.Â  However, both parties\r\n  equally benefited financially from the division of the ticket proceeds prior to\r\n  the termination of the contract.Â  \r\nBased on our determination that the &quot;pull-tab&quot; cards and\r\n  the dispensers constituted illegal gambling devices, we find the underlying\r\n  contract is void ab initio and unenforceable as it violates statutory\r\n  law and public policy. Â Thus, we will not enforce this contract.Â  SeeÂ  Berkebile\r\n    v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 54 n.2, 426 S.E.2d 760, 762 n.2 (1993) (recognizing\r\n  that an illegal contract has always been unenforceable and that South Carolina\r\n  courts will not enforce a contract which is violative of public policy,\r\n  statutory law or provisions of the constitution).[8]Â  \r\nAs a result, we vacate the decisions of the special master and the\r\n  Court of Appeals and dismiss with prejudice R&amp;B's breach of contract\r\n  action.\r\nVACATED\r\n  AND DISMISSED.\r\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE PLEICONES, HEARN, J.,\r\n  and Acting Justices James E.

Reno, 230 F.3d 365, 367 (D.C. 2000) (addressing the\r\n  legality of &quot;pull-tab&quot; cards and machines).Â Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  Ward explained that there are 4,800 tickets in a box.Â \r\n  Once the tickets are sold, R&amp;B collects a $1,510 profit which is reduced by\r\n  a $180 cost for the cards.Â  The parties then equally divided the remaining\r\n  profit.\r\n[3]Â  Section 12-21-2710 was amended by Act No. 125, 1999\r\n  S.C.

Stratton, both of Murphy &amp; Grantland, of Columbia,\r\n  for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tMatthew\r\n  Christian, of Christian Moorhead &amp; Davis, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  We granted certiorari to consider a Court of Appeals\r\n  decision reversing a circuit court order which granted petitioner (Zurich)\r\n  summary judgment in this declaratory judgment action to determine respondents'\r\n  entitlement to Underinsured Motorist (UIM) coverage.Â  Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Tolbert, 378 S.C. 493, 662 S.E.2d 606 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent Tony\r\n  Tolbert (Tolbert) owned a Honda Accord, and leased a BMW through his employer.Â \r\n  He rejected UIM coverage on the Honda, but the BMW was insured by BMW of North\r\n  America, LLC through Zurich, under a policy which had UIM coverage.Â  Tolbert\r\n  had an accident while driving the Honda on a personal errand.Â  After he and his\r\n  wife (together respondents) settled their suit against the other driver\r\n  involved in the accident, they sought to recover UIM benefits under the\r\n  BMW/Zurich policy.\r\nZurich brought this\r\n  declaratory judgment action, and filed a summary judgment motion alleging there\r\n  was no coverage under the policy's &quot;Drive Other Car&quot; endorsement.Â \r\n  Respondents opposed Zurich's motion, and alleged in their cross-motion for\r\n  summary judgment that the Zurich policy applied pursuant to a &quot;temporary\r\n  substitute&quot; endorsement because, at the time of the accident, the Honda\r\n  qualified as a &quot;temporary substitute&quot; for the BMW.Â  In support of\r\n  respondents' summary judgment motion, Tolbert provided an affidavit in which he\r\n  stated, &quot;The reason I drove the [Honda] and not the BMWâ€¦was due to the\r\n  fact that the BMW was in need of service and an oil change and could not be\r\n  driven.&quot;Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  granted Zurich's summary judgment motion and denied respondents' motion.Â  On\r\n  appeal, the Court of Appeals agreed that there was no coverage under the\r\n  &quot;Drive Other Car&quot; endorsement, but found a genuine question of\r\n  material fact such that summary judgment was improper under the &quot;temporary\r\n  substitute&quot; vehicle endorsement found in the &quot;South Carolina\r\n  Underinsured Motorist Coverage&quot; (SCUIM) provision of the Zurich policy,\r\n  and reversed.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the\r\n  Court of Appeals err in reversing the circuit court order granting summary\r\n  judgment to Zurich?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe SCUIM\r\n  endorsement defines who is an UIM insured for purposes of automobiles\r\n  principally garaged in South Carolina as:\r\n\r\n\tB.Â  Who\r\n  is an Insured\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIf the\r\n  Named Insured designated in the Declaration is:\r\n\t\r\n\tâ€¦.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t2.Â \r\n  Aâ€¦corporation, then the following are &quot;insureds:&quot;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\ta.&nbsp; Anyone &quot;occupying&quot; a\r\n  covered &quot;auto&quot; or a temporary substitute for a covered\r\n  &quot;auto.&quot;Â  The covered &quot;auto&quot; must be out of service because\r\n  of its breakdown, repair, servicing, &quot;loss&quot; or destruction.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n  judgment should be denied where the non-moving party submits a mere scintilla\r\n  of evidence.Â  Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 673\r\n  S.E.2d 801 (2009).Â  In our\r\n  view, respondents presented a scintilla of evidence through Tolbert's affidavit,\r\n  sufficient to withstand summary judgment, that there may be coverage under the\r\n  SCUIM endorsement.Â  \r\nTolbert averred, &quot;The reason I drove the 1989 Honda Accord\r\n  and not the BMWâ€¦&quot; was because it needed service.Â  This averment is some\r\n  evidence that once the BMW was back in service, Tolbert intended to resume\r\n  driving it, i.e., that he was driving the Honda as a temporary substitute.Â  In\r\n  this same sentence, Tolbert averred that the BMW &quot;was in need of service\r\n  and an oil change and could not be driven.&quot;Â  In our view, this averment\r\n  constitutes the scintilla of evidence necessary to withstand summary judgment\r\n  on the question whether the &quot;covered &quot;auto&quot; [was] out of service\r\n  because of itsâ€¦servicingâ€¦.&quot; and thus covered by the SCUIM endorsement.Â \r\n  Unlike the dissent, we do not view the terms used in this provision as\r\n  requiring that the covered automobile be &quot;actually disabled,&quot; but\r\n  rather that it be &quot;out of service&quot; due to one of five enumerated\r\n  reasons.Â  Here, the affidavit states the BMW &quot;could not be driven&quot;\r\n  because, among other reasons,[1] it &quot;was in need of service.&quot;Â  Under the SCUIM, a person occupying the\r\n  temporary substitute automobile is an insured if the covered auto is &quot;out\r\n  of serviceÂ  because of its . . . servicing . . . .&quot;Â  Tolbert's affidavit Â satisfied\r\n  the scintilla standard, and thus the Court of Appeals correctly reversed the\r\n  order granting ZurichÂ  summary judgment.Â  Hancock, supra.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals reversing the grant of summary judgment to\r\n  Zurich is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  J. and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a\r\n  separate opinion in which KITTREDGE, J., concurs in Section I only.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent from the majority's opinion and would reverse\r\n  the court of appeals' decision finding Tony Tolbert and Tonesha Tolbert's\r\n  (Respondents) affidavit creates a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to\r\n  survive Zurich American Insurance Company's (Petitioner) motion for summary\r\n  judgment.Â Â  \r\nTony Tolbert (Tolbert), a BMW employee, leased a 2003\r\n  BMW 325 (BMW) as part of a lease program for BMW employees.Â  Petitioner issued\r\n  a business automobile insurance policy (Policy) to BMW which provided\r\n  underinsured (UIM) coverage to the leasing employees in certain circumstances.Â  \r\nOn a Saturday in 2003, Tolbert picked up his son in\r\n  Greenwood, South Carolina.Â  Tolbert was driving a 1989 Honda Accord (Honda)\r\n  registered and titled in his name, instead of the leased BMW.Â  The Honda was\r\n  insured, but Tolbert chose to reject UIM coverage under the Honda policy.Â  On\r\n  the return trip from Greenwood to Greenville, Tolbert was involved in an\r\n  accident caused by William Humbert (Humbert).Â  Tolbert was injured, but settled\r\n  with Humbert for the minimum liability limits of $15,000 Humbert carried on his\r\n  automobile.Â  \r\nPetitioner filed this declaratory judgment action\r\n  against Respondents seeking a determination on several different grounds that\r\n  Tolbert did not qualify as an insured for purposes of UIM coverage under the\r\n  Policy.Â  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and a hearing was scheduled\r\n  at the circuit court.Â  At the hearing, Respondents argued the Honda was a\r\n  temporary substitute for the leased BMW, and thus qualified Respondents for UIM\r\n  coverage under a Policy endorsement.Â  In support of their argument, Respondents\r\n  submitted an affidavit stating the reason Tolbert was driving the Honda instead\r\n  of the BMW was because the BMW was &quot;in need of service and an oil change\r\n  and could not be driven.&quot;Â  The circuit court granted Petitioner's motion\r\n  for summary judgment.Â  The court of appeals reversed and held Respondents'\r\n  affidavit created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Tolbert's\r\n  Honda qualified as a temporary substitute for the covered BMW.Â  Zurich\r\n    American Ins. Co. v. Tolbert,&nbsp;378 S.C. 493, 501, 662 S.E.2d 606,\r\n  610&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).\r\nI.&nbsp; The Honda Was Not a\r\n  Temporary Substitute\r\nThe UIM policy provision upon which Respondents rely\r\n  states:\r\n\r\n\tB. Who Is An Insured\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIf the Named Insured is designated in the Declarations\r\n  as:\r\n\t\t2. A partnership, limited liability company,\r\n  corporation or any other form of organization, then the following are\r\n  &quot;insureds&quot;:\r\n\t\ta. Anyone &quot;occupying&quot; a covered\r\n  &quot;auto&quot; or a temporary substitute for a covered &quot;auto&quot;. Â The\r\n  covered &quot;auto&quot; must be out of service because of its breakdown,\r\n  repair, servicing, &quot;loss&quot; or destruction.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThis Court addressed a temporary substitute clause in Nationwide\r\n  Mutual Insurance Co. v. Douglas, 273 S.C. 243, 255 S.E.2d 828&nbsp;(1979).Â \r\n  We noted that &quot;in order for coverage to be extended under a substitution\r\n  provision, the use of the alleged substitute automobile must be\r\n  Temporary.&quot;Â  Douglas, 273 S.C. at 246, 255 S.E.2d at 830.Â  In Douglas,\r\n  the Court found the automobile alleged to be a temporary substitute for the covered\r\n  automobile was not a temporary substitute because &quot;[t]he record is barren\r\n  of any evidence that she was using the Pontiac temporarily.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, there is no evidence in the record that Tolbert was using the Honda\r\n  temporarily.Â  Indeed, there was nothing temporary about Tolbert's use of the\r\n  Honda he was driving at the time of the accident.Â  The Honda was registered and\r\n  titled in Tolbert's name and was available for Tolbert's use at any time.Â \r\n  Similar to the vehicles in Douglas, both the Honda and BMW were intended\r\n  for Tolbert's continued use until he chose to dispose of them.Â  There is no\r\n  evidence the Honda was being used temporarily or as a substitute for the BMW at\r\n  the time of the accident.Â  Thus, the court of appeals should be reversed. \r\nII.&nbsp; The BMW Was Not &quot;Out\r\n  of Service&quot;\r\nMoreover,\r\n  even if the Honda were being used as a temporary substitute, the policy\r\n  language also requires the covered automobile to be &quot;be out of service\r\n  because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, 'loss' or destruction.&quot; Â In\r\n  this case, the only possibility for coverage would be if the car was deemed to\r\n  be out of service due to servicing.Â  \r\nOther courts have held that routine auto service does\r\n  not sufficiently remove a vehicle from service to trigger temporary substitute\r\n  auto coverage.Â  See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. O'Brien,\r\n  534 P.2d 388&nbsp;(Cal. 1975) (holding the fact that the insured vehicle was\r\n  low on gas did not allow for another vehicle to qualify as a temporary\r\n  substitute); Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. Addy, 286 P.2d 622, 624&nbsp;(Colo. 1955)\r\n  (finding when an insured vehicle was low on fuel and had snow tires on it was\r\n  insufficient for another vehicle to qualify as a temporary substitute because\r\n  &quot;[a] reasonable and logical interpretation of the word â€˜servicingâ€™ would seem\r\n  to present a condition where the automobile covered by the policy was in some\r\n  manner actually disabled.&quot;).Â  In my view, alleging that an oil change and\r\n  service are needed is not sufficient to trigger UIM coverage under the policy\r\n  language.Â  Similar to the O'Brien case where the covered vehicle needed\r\n  gas, Respondents' affidavit alleges that the BMW needed an oil change.Â  There\r\n  was no evidence that the BMW was actually disabled.Â  I would find that merely\r\n  needing an oil change and service does not constitute a car being out of\r\n  service for the purpose of UIM coverage under this policy.Â  \r\nTo\r\n  conclude, in my opinion, the Honda fails to be a temporary substitute for the\r\n  BMW for two reasons: (1) there is no evidence in the record to show that\r\n  Tolbert's use of the Honda was temporary or that it was being used as a\r\n  substitute for the BMW at the time of the accident; and (2) even if the Honda\r\n  were being used as a temporary substitute, it was not out of service for the\r\n  purpose of UIM coverage.Â  Thus, I would reverse the court of appeals and affirm\r\n  the trial court's decision to grant Petitioner's motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  J., concurs in Section I only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] As we read the affidavit, the BMW was in need of both an oil change and a\r\n  service, unlike the cars in both State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. O'Brien,\r\n  534 P.2d 388 (Cal. 1975) and Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. Addy, 286 P.2d 622\r\n  (Colo. 1955) which needed only more gasoline in order to be driven.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26799","title":"Tobaccoville USA v.

Stieglitz and Amy\r\n  Harmon Geddes, both of Nexsen, Pruet, LLC, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Â In\r\n  this case, the Attorney General (the AG) appeals the administrative law court's\r\n  (ALC) order compelling production of numerous documents the AG contends are\r\n  privileged, confidential communications.Â  We certified the appeal pursuant to\r\n  Rule 204(b), SCACR, and reverse and remand to the ALC for findings in\r\n  accordance with this opinion.\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nIn 1998, South\r\n  Carolina was one of many states to enter into a Master Settlement Agreement\r\n  (MSA) with certain tobacco companies to settle litigation brought by the states\r\n  to recover tobacco-related health care expenses.Â  The MSA contained a Model\r\n  Escrow Statute that South Carolina adopted and codified as the South Carolina\r\n  Escrow Fund Act at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-47-10, et. seq. (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  The Escrow Fund Act provides that a &quot;tobacco product manufacturer&quot;[1] (TPM) that sells cigarettes to consumers within the state must either: (1) join\r\n  the MSA and make settlement payments required under the MSA, or (2) remain a\r\n  &quot;non-participating member&quot; and make payments each year to a qualified\r\n  escrow fund.Â  Id. Â§ 11-47-10.Â  \r\nTobaccoville\r\n  is an importer and distributor of Seneca brand cigarettes, which are\r\n  manufactured by Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd. (Grand River) in\r\n  Canada.Â  Tobaccoville asserts that it is the exclusive\r\n  &quot;off-reservation&quot; importer of the Seneca brand, and that Native\r\n  Wholesale Supply is the exclusive &quot;on-reservation&quot; importer.Â  Based\r\n  on these and other assertions by Tobaccoville, the AG certified Tobaccoville as\r\n  a TPM for the Seneca brand in November 2003.Â  Tobaccoville was recertified as a\r\n  TPM for years 2004 through 2006.Â  \r\nSince\r\n  that certification, &quot;on-reservation&quot; Seneca cigarettes manufactured\r\n  by Grand River and distributed by Native Wholesale Supply improperly were being\r\n  sold &quot;off-reservation&quot; in South Carolina.Â  In April 2007, the AG\r\n  determined Tobaccoville no longer qualified as a TPM, and that Grand River\r\n  would have to be certified as a TPM instead if Seneca cigarettes would continue\r\n  to be sold lawfully in South Carolina.Â  Tobaccoville appealed the AG's\r\n  determination to the ALC.Â  In the course of discovery, the AG produced\r\n  thousands of documents and submitted a privilege log indicating numerous\r\n  documents were confidential and not subject to production.Â  Tobaccoville sought\r\n  to compel production of some of those documents, arguing that the documents\r\n  were necessary to properly litigate the case.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  ALC found that the documents at issue were properly discoverable and were not\r\n  privileged.Â  The AG moved for reconsideration and was denied.Â  The AG then\r\n  appealed to the court of appeals, which dismissed the appeal.Â  The court of\r\n  appeals, however, later certified this case to this court pursuant to Rule\r\n  204(b), SCACR after the AG's petition for rehearing.[2]\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe\r\n  determination of whether or not a communication is privileged and confidential\r\n  is a matter for the trial judge to decide after a preliminary inquiry into all\r\n  the facts and circumstances.Â  State v. Love, 275 S.C. 55, 59, 271 S.E.2d\r\n  110, 112 (1980).Â  The trial judge's decision will not be overturned absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAnalysis\r\nThe\r\n  AG contends that the documents in issue are not relevant to the subject matter\r\n  of the case and that they are protected by several privileges.Â  The ALC,\r\n  however, found that the documents were properly discoverable and were not\r\n  covered by any privileges.Â  We clarify the applicable privileges and remand for\r\n  the ALC to make further findings in accordance with this opinion.\r\nAttorney-Client Privilege\r\nÂ The\r\n  AG asserts the documents in question were covered by the attorney-client\r\n  privilege, and thus were confidential communications not subject to discovery.Â \r\n  The ALC found that because neither the National Association of Attorneys\r\n  General (the NAAG) nor the other state attorneys general were retained as\r\n  counsel then there could be no attorney-client relationship upon which to\r\n  premise the privilege.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  attorney-client privilege protects against disclosure of confidential\r\n  communications by a client to his attorney.&quot;Â  State v. Owens, 309\r\n  S.C. 402, 407, 424 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1992).Â  &quot;This privilege is based upon\r\n  a wise policy that considers that the interests of society are best promoted by\r\n  inviting the utmost confidence on the part of the client in disclosing his\r\n  secrets to this professional advisor . . . .&quot;Â  Id.Â  In State v.\r\n    Doster, this Court explained the attorney-client privilege as follows:\r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional legal adviser\r\n  in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating to that purpose (4)\r\n  made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are\r\n  at his instance permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by the\r\n  legal adviser, (8) except the protection be waived.\r\n\r\n276 S.C. 647, 651, 284 S.E.2d\r\n  218, 219-20 (1981) (citation omitted).\r\nWhile\r\n  the relationship the AG has with the NAAG is not the traditional\r\n  attorney-client relationship envisioned in Doster, we nonetheless find\r\n  that these communications may be covered by the attorney-client privilege.Â  As\r\n  the ALC noted, the AG has not &quot;retained&quot; the NAAG attorneys in this\r\n  matter or with respect to the disputed documents.Â  However, the AG is a paid\r\n  member of the NAAG, and NAAG staff attorneys are available to provide legal\r\n  advice relating to the MSA and tobacco regulation and enforcement.Â  We find it\r\n  instructive that one court has previously held that similar documents between a\r\n  state attorney general and the NAAG were protected by the attorney-client\r\n  privilege.Â  See Grand River Enterprise Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, No.\r\n  02 Civ. 5069(JFK)(DFE), 2008 WL 1826490, at *3 (Apr. 18, 2008 S.D.N.Y.).Â  \r\nThus\r\n  we hold that the attorney-client privilege may apply to this very narrow\r\n  factual scenario because the AG, as a paid member, has solicited the NAAG\r\n  attorneys for legal advice and consultation on matters relating to the tobacco\r\n  litigation, the MSA, subsequent enforcement of the MSA, and tobacco\r\n  regulation.Â  We remand the matter to the ALC to determine if the allegedly\r\n  privileged documents are confidential communications pertaining to the above\r\n  legal matters.\r\nAttorney Work Product Doctrine\r\nThe AG also asserts\r\n  that the documents at issue are protected by the attorney work product\r\n  doctrine.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe attorney work\r\n  product doctrine protects from discovery documents prepared in anticipation of\r\n  litigation, unless a substantial need can be shown by the requesting party.Â  See Rule 26(b)(3), SCRCP; Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91\r\n  L.Ed. 451 (1947).Â  Generally, in determining whether a document has been\r\n  prepared &quot;in anticipation of litigation,&quot; most courts look to whether\r\n  or not the document was prepared because of the prospect of litigation.Â  See Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co., Inc.,\r\n  967 F.2d 980, 984 (4th Cir. 1992) (document &quot;must be prepared because of\r\n  the prospect of litigation when the preparer faces an actual claim or a\r\n  potential claim,&quot; as contrasted to &quot;materials prepared in the\r\n  ordinary course of business or pursuant to regulatory requirements or for other\r\n  non-litigation purposes.&quot;); In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 357 F.3d\r\n  900, 907 (9th Cir. 2004) (document &quot;should be deemed 'in anticipation of\r\n  litigation' . . . if . . . [it] can be fairly said to have been prepared or\r\n  obtained because of the prospect of litigation.&quot; (citation omitted)); In\r\n    re Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Co., 214 F.3d 586, 593 (5th Cir. 2000)\r\n  (primary motivation behind creating the document must be to aid in possible\r\n  future litigation).Â  \r\nHere, to support\r\n  his contention that the documents are covered by the attorney work product\r\n  doctrine, the AG merely claims that the privilege applies because the framework\r\n  of the Escrow Fund Act &quot;contemplates the potential for litigation&quot;\r\n  and the documents &quot;concern litigation.&quot;Â  However, a party must show\r\n  more than that the statute governing the party's actions considers the\r\n  possibility of future litigation.Â  The work product doctrine is not implicated\r\n  here because these documents were not created because of the prospect of\r\n  litigation, but perhaps more accurately were created because of efforts to\r\n  enforce a settlement from previous litigation. Thus, we hold the facts of this\r\n  case are insufficient to trigger the protection of the attorney work product\r\n  doctrine.Â  \r\nDeliberative Process\r\n  Privilege\r\nThe AG claims the\r\n  documents at issue are also protected from disclosure by the deliberative\r\n  process privilege.Â  South Carolina courts have not previously addressed whether\r\n  that privilege is recognized in this state.Â  We decline to adopt this privilege\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  \r\nCommon Interest Doctrine\r\nThe AG asserts the\r\n  common interest doctrine operates to preserve the above privileges when the\r\n  documents at issue have been shared with the other state attorneys general.Â \r\n  South Carolina courts have not previously addressed this doctrine and\r\n  determined its applicability in this state.Â  We now adopt the common interest\r\n  doctrine for the narrow factual scenario where several states are parties to a\r\n  settlement agreement, the state laws that regulate and enforce that settlement\r\n  all have the same provisions, the attorneys general of those settling states\r\n  are involved in coordinating regulation and enforcement, and the settling\r\n  states have executed a common interest agreement.Â Â Â  \r\nThe common interest\r\n  doctrine is not a privilege in itself, but is instead an exception to the\r\n  waiver of an existing privilege.Â  The doctrine &quot;protects the transmission\r\n  of data to which the attorney-client privilege or work product protection has\r\n  attached&quot; when it is shared between parties with a common interest in a\r\n  legal matter. Â John Freeman, The Common Interest Rule, 6 S.C.\r\n  Law. 12 (May/June 1995).Â  It is an exception to the general rule that\r\n  disclosure of privileged information waives the applicable privilege.Â  In re\r\n    Grand Jury Subpoenas, 902 F.2d 244, 248 (4th Cir. 1990).Â  Thus, information\r\n  covered by the common interest doctrine cannot be waived without the consent of\r\n  all parties who share the privilege.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe AG asserts that\r\n  the states have a common interest in tobacco regulation and the enforcement of\r\n  the MSA.Â  As proof of this interest, the AG has provided a Common Interest\r\n  Agreement, which memorializes the states' common interest and the intent that\r\n  any applicable privileges not be waived by the sharing of privileged information.Â \r\n  Also, the AG provides an affidavit from the Director and Chief Counsel of the\r\n  NAAG Tobacco Project, stating that the common interest stems from the MSA\r\n  creation of identical rights and obligations for the settling states. \r\nTobaccoville\r\n  argues that there is no common interest applicable in this case because the\r\n  matters at issue are solely revolving around Tobaccoville's TPM certification.Â \r\n  This analysis is misguided.Â  Admittedly, the instant lawsuit itself may not be\r\n  a matter of common interest. However, the inquiry is more properly whether or\r\n  not the matters discussed in the allegedly privileged documents are matters of\r\n  common interest.Â  It is irrelevant that the current lawsuit is not of common\r\n  interest.Â  So long as the documents at issue were covered by an applicable\r\n  privilege when created, that privilege continues until waived.Â  When the common\r\n  interest doctrine applies, it operates as an exception to any potential waiver\r\n  of privilege, regardless of the subject matter of the present litigation.\r\nWe\r\n  find the AG has a common interest with the other settling state attorneys\r\n  general in matters relating to the MSA and tobacco regulation and litigation.[3]Â \r\n  The settling state attorneys general and the NAAG are working together to have\r\n  uniform tobacco regulations and enforcement of the MSA.Â  Accordingly, if the\r\n  documents were privileged and thus exempt from production, that privilege was\r\n  not waived when the AG shared the information with other state attorneys\r\n  general. \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we reverse the ALC's decision and remand for further determinations\r\n  made in accordance with this opinion.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The statute defines a &quot;tobacco product manufacturer&quot; as follows:\r\n\r\n\t(i)&nbsp; &quot;Tobacco product manufacturer&quot; means an entity that after the\r\n  date of enactment of this act (and not exclusively through any affiliate):\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1)\r\n  manufactures cigarettes anywhere that such manufacturer intends to be sold in\r\n  the United States, including cigarettes intended to be sold in the United\r\n  States through an importer . . . \r\n\t\t(2) is\r\n  the first purchaser anywhere for resale in the United States of cigarettes\r\n  manufactured anywhere that the manufacturer does not intend to be sold in the\r\n  United States; or\r\n\t\t(3)\r\n  becomes a successor of an entity described in subitem (1) or (2).\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe term &quot;tobacco product manufacturer&quot; does\r\n  not include an affiliate of a tobacco product manufacturer unless such\r\n  affiliate itself falls within any of subitems (1)-(3) above.\r\n[2] While normally a discovery order is not immediately appealable, this Court\r\n  found S.C.

Ray\r\n  Ham, of West Columbia, pro se.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter,\r\n  respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the\r\n  imposition of an indefinite suspension.[1]Â \r\n  Respondent requests that, if the Court accepts the agreement and imposes an\r\n  indefinite suspension, that the suspension be made retroactive to the date of\r\n  his interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Ham, 361 S.C. 116, 603 S.E.2d\r\n  905 (2004).Â  In addition, respondent agrees to reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for\r\n  Client Protection (Lawyers' Fund) for claims paid on his behalf.Â  We accept the\r\n  agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this\r\n  state, retroactive to October 4, 2004, the date of respondent's interim\r\n  suspension. Â Further, we order respondent to reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for\r\n  all claims paid on his behalf.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are\r\n  as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nOver a\r\n  number of years, respondent represented several members of the Doe family in a\r\n  variety of legal matters.Â  Respondent was named as the personal representative\r\n  of Ms. Doe's estate.Â  Respondent represents that all money he received from Ms.\r\n  Doe's estate was properly authorized, although he acknowledges that he cannot\r\n  properly document the funds. \r\nThe sole\r\n  heir to Ms. Doe's estate was her brother, Mr. Doe.Â  Respondent had represented Mr.\r\n  Doe over a period of years and had effectively managed Mr. Doe's financial\r\n  affairs.Â  \r\nIn 2004,\r\n  guardianship and conservatorship actions were filed in Richland County Probate\r\n  Court concerning Mr. Doe. Â Respondent was notified of the two scheduled\r\n  hearings, but he failed to attend either hearing.Â  The probate court issued two\r\n  orders directing respondent to produce financial records and an accurate\r\n  accounting for the time period in which he managed Mr. Doe's finances.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to produce the requested documentation.Â  Respondent\r\n  acknowledges he is unable to properly document the monies which he disbursed on\r\n  Mr. Doe's behalf.Â  During this time period, respondent was admitted to an\r\n  Upstate hospital and diagnosed with severe depression.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nRespondent\r\n  acknowledges that he withdrew substantial money from his trust account for his\r\n  own use and benefit.Â  He further acknowledges that he did not comply with the\r\n  recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent admits that, on\r\n  September 27, 2004, he deposited $45,000 from his personal proceeds into his\r\n  trust account in order to cover a shortage caused by his unauthorized\r\n  withdrawals.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Complainant in several matters related to her business.Â  Respondent\r\n  asserts that, in one of these cases in early 2004, he instructed his staff to\r\n  effect service on the opposing party.Â  Respondent mistakenly believed that\r\n  service had been accomplished when he informed Complainant of the status of the\r\n  case.Â  In fact, service was never completed.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that the file in the case was either lost or misplaced and he did not\r\n  realize until several months later that service had not been accomplished.Â \r\n  Respondent acknowledges that it was his responsibility to ensure that the case\r\n  was handled in a competent and diligent manner.Â Â  \r\nBy letter\r\n  from ODC dated October 4, 2004, respondent was notified of the complaint in\r\n  this matter; the letter requested a written response within fifteen (15) days.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to respond or otherwise communicate with ODC.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  November 3, 2004, ODC sent respondent a letter pursuant to In the Matter of\r\n    Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), again requesting a response.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to respond or otherwise communicate with ODC within the\r\n  timeframe requested in the November 3, 2004 letter.Â  Â Â \r\nODC\r\n  received a letter from respondent dated December 6, 2004, which stated &quot;I\r\n  have recovered to the point when I can now prepare a reply to their complaint.Â \r\n  I will have it filed within a week.&quot;Â  As of February 18, 2005, respondent\r\n  failed to submit any substantive response to the allegations in the complaint.Â \r\n  On that date, full investigation was authorized by the Commission on Lawyer\r\n  Conduct.Â  Respondent accepted service of the Notice of Full Investigation on\r\n  February 28, 2005.Â  The notice required respondent submit a written response\r\n  within thirty (30) days of service.Â  Respondent failed to submit his response\r\n  until May 2, 2005.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client\r\n  reasonably informed about status of matter); Rule 1.15 (lawyer\r\n    shall keep client funds separate from lawyer's personal funds); Rule 8.1 (lawyer shall not fail to respond to\r\n      lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(e) (it is\r\n      professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\r\n      administration of justice).Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent admits he has violated the financial recordkeeping\r\n  provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent agrees that his misconduct\r\n  constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any\r\n  other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and\r\n  Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law,\r\n  retroactive to October 4, 2004, the date of his interim suspension.Â  See In the Matter of Ham, supra.Â  Pursuant to the terms of the\r\n  agreement, respondent shall enter into a restitution agreement with the Office\r\n  of Commission Counsel.Â  Under no circumstances shall respondent file a petition\r\n  for reinstatement until he has reimbursed the Lawyers' Fund for all claims paid\r\n  on his behalf.[2]Â \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender his\r\n  certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court\r\n  and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has\r\n  complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nINDEFNITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Since formal charges were not filed prior to\r\n  January 1, 2010, an indefinite suspension remains a possible sanction under\r\n  prior Rule 7(b)(2), RLDE.

Â We accept the Agreement and impose a two year suspension,\r\n  retroactive to March 27, 2008.Â  In addition, we order respondent to reimburse\r\n  the Lawyers' Fund and clients as specified later in this opinion.Â  The facts,\r\n  as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented James L. Dingus in a civil matter.Â  After initially accepting a\r\n  flat fee, respondent entered into an agreement with Mr. Dingus which stated his\r\n  fee would be contingent on recovery for Mr. Dingus.Â  Respondent did not place\r\n  the contingent fee agreement in writing.Â  \r\nOn December 17,\r\n  2007, Mr. Dingus signed a release and endorsed a settlement check in the amount\r\n  of $21,000 which had been presented to him by respondent.Â  Respondent's fee of\r\n  $2,000 was to be withheld from the proceeds and Mr. Dingus was to receive the\r\n  balance of $19,000.Â  \r\nAt the time Mr.\r\n  Dingus executed the documents, respondent informed him that the judge would\r\n  have to review the settlement documents before the funds could be disbursed.Â \r\n  Respondent assured Mr. Dingus that the funds would be held in his trust\r\n  account.Â  Respondent now acknowledges that he delayed communicating with Mr. Dingus\r\n  because he had misappropriated the money and was waiting to obtain funds from\r\n  other sources to replace the funds owed to Mr. Dingus.Â  \r\nAs of February\r\n  1, 2008, respondent still had not disbursed the settlement funds to Mr.\r\n  Dingus.Â  On or about February 1, 2008, respondent admitted to Mr. Dingus that\r\n  he no longer had the settlement funds in his trust account and offered to pay\r\n  Mr. Dingus $5,000 from his personal account and to sign a promissory note for\r\n  the balance to be paid monthly with interest.Â  \r\nA review of\r\n  respondent's trust account records revealed that respondent used client funds\r\n  to pay several personal bills.Â  In particular, respondent used client funds to\r\n  pay on his accounts with the South Carolina Student Loan Corporation, Discover,\r\n  Sears, Lowe's, World Market, and Wells Fargo.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented the plaintiff in a divorce action before the Honorable Richard W. Chewning, III, on November 29, 2007.Â  At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge\r\n  Chewning ordered respondent to prepare the order. Â Respondent failed to timely\r\n  prepare the order in spite of numerous requests from Judge Chewning's\r\n  assistant.Â  \r\nOn March 27,\r\n  2008, respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of\r\n    Witcraft, supra.Â  Unaware of respondent's suspension, Judge Chewning\r\n  left a voicemail for respondent in which he requested respondent immediately\r\n  forward the order.Â  \r\nBy letter dated\r\n  April 8, 2008, respondent sent an order to Judge Chewning.Â  The letter was\r\n  written on respondent's law office letterhead.Â  Respondent failed to inform\r\n  Judge Chewning that he had been suspended by the Court.Â  Instead, respondent\r\n  misrepresented to Judge Chewning that he was &quot;closing the office.&quot;Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that,\r\n  by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Â Rule\r\n  1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3\r\n  (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a\r\n  client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of\r\n  a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule\r\n  1.5 (contingent fee agreement shall be placed in writing signed by client); Rule\r\n  1.15 (lawyer shall keep funds belonging to client separately from lawyer's funds);\r\n  Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation\r\n  consistent with interests of the client); Rule 3.3 (lawyer shall not knowingly\r\n  make false statement of fact to tribunal); Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction where doing\r\n    so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction); Rule\r\n    8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule\r\n    8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit,\r\n    or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that\r\n    is prejudicial to administration of justice). Â \r\nRespondent admits that\r\n  his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct\r\n  of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to\r\n  willfully violate a valid order of the Supreme Court), and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer\r\n  shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or\r\n  to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct\r\n  demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and impose a two year definite suspension from\r\n  the practice of law, retroactive to March 27, 2008, the date of respondent's\r\n  interim suspension.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tPeter Demos Protopapas, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the\r\n  Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a definite suspension of\r\n  no more than one year from the practice of law, with certain conditions of\r\n  reinstatement.Â  Respondent also requests that the suspension be imposed\r\n  retroactively to the date of his interim suspension.[1]Â  ODC joins in that request.Â  However,\r\n  subsequently, respondent informed the Court that the Agreement is not\r\n  conditioned upon the suspension being retroactive to the date of his interim\r\n  suspension. Â We accept the Agreement and suspend respondent from the practice\r\n  of law in this state for six months, not retroactive, subject to the following\r\n  conditions of reinstatement: compliance with a two year monitoring contract\r\n  with Lawyers Helping Lawyers; quarterly reporting to the Commission on Lawyer\r\n  Conduct by respondentâ€™s treating physician regarding his diagnosis, treatment\r\n  compliance, and prognosis for a two year period; payment of restitution to\r\n  certain clients and the Lawyers Fund for Client Protection in accordance with\r\n  the terms of the Restitution Plan entered into with ODC; completion of the\r\n  Legal Ethics and Practice Program Trust Account School and Ethics School within\r\n  one year of reinstatement; and quarterly reporting to the Commission on Lawyer\r\n  Conduct by respondent of the status of his trust account(s), including, but not\r\n  limited to, submission of complete records maintained pursuant to Rule 417,\r\n  SCACR, for a period of two years.[2]Â  The facts, as set forth in\r\n  the Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn June\r\n  2008, respondent entered into an agreement in bankruptcy court designed to\r\n  assist him in correcting personal and professional difficulties, including\r\n  alcohol abuse, which had led to the dismissal of certain clientsâ€™ cases due to\r\n  lack of diligence and the return of filing fees due to insufficient funds.Â  The\r\n  agreement required respondent to seek treatment and mentoring for alcohol abuse;\r\n  refrain from filing new cases until deficiencies in his pending cases were\r\n  cured; and establish a trust account in compliance with IOLTA.Â  However,\r\n  respondent failed to comply with the terms of the agreement and he was held in\r\n  contempt of court.\r\nIn one\r\n  bankruptcy matter, the clientâ€™s case was dismissed because respondent failed to\r\n  file necessary documentation.Â  The client was required to pay an additional\r\n  $274 to have her case re-filed.Â  Respondent did not re-file the case until after\r\n  the clientâ€™s house had been foreclosed upon and eviction proceedings had\r\n  begun.Â  Moreover, the subsequent petition was dismissed for lack of necessary\r\n  schedules, statements, or other documents and because of the prior filing.\r\nIn another\r\n  bankruptcy matter, respondent was initially successful in having the sale of\r\n  the clientsâ€™ home set aside by filing a bankruptcy petition on the clientsâ€™\r\n  behalf.Â  However, thereafter, he failed to diligently pursue the matter,\r\n  including failing to file the required documents, which led to the dismissal of\r\n  the petition.Â  Petitioner also failed to communicate with the clients.Â \r\n  Finally, he failed to hold unearned fees paid by the clients in trust.Â  The\r\n  Lawyerâ€™s Fund for Client Protection has reimbursed the clients for the fees\r\n  paid to respondent.\r\nRespondent\r\n  was hired by two other clients to, in part, advise them regarding bankruptcy.Â \r\n  One of the clients paid respondent a $1,000 fee, while the second client paid\r\n  respondent a fee of $5,000.Â  With regard to the first client, respondent failed\r\n  to file a bankruptcy petition.Â  He failed to hold the unearned fee she had paid\r\n  him in a trust account and failed to refund the $1,000 fee to her as he had\r\n  promised.Â  With regard to the second client, respondent determined bankruptcy\r\n  was not an option.Â  Respondent took no further action on behalf of the client,\r\n  he failed to adequately communicate with the client, and he did not refund the\r\n  $5,000 fee paid to him by the client.Â  The Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection\r\n  has reimbursed the client for the fee paid to respondent.\r\nFinally, in\r\n  a non-bankruptcy matter that had been referred to respondent, respondent failed\r\n  to communicate with the client following the referral.Â  Although respondent did\r\n  not have the clientâ€™s consent to assume representation in the case and did not\r\n  file a motion to be substituted as counsel, he signed two consent orders\r\n  related to discovery issues on the clientâ€™s behalf, one of which allowed the\r\n  clientâ€™s deposition to be taken.Â  However, respondent did not appear at the\r\n  deposition, which had to be rescheduled.Â  Moreover, although respondent was\r\n  placed on interim suspension on August 19, 2008, he did not inform opposing\r\n  counsel of that fact until September 2, 2008, the date of the rescheduled\r\n  deposition.\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:\r\n  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client, which requires\r\n  the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary\r\n  for the representation); Rule 1.2(a) (a lawyer shall consult with the client as\r\n  to the means by which their objectives are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer\r\n  shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client);\r\n  Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall reasonably consult with the client about the means by\r\n  which the client's objectives are to be accomplished, keep the client\r\n  reasonably informed about the status of the matter, promptly comply with\r\n  reasonable requests for information, consult with the client about any relevant\r\n  limitation on the lawyer's conduct when the lawyer knows that the client\r\n  expects assistance not permitted by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other\r\n  law, and shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit\r\n  the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation); Rule 1.5 (a\r\n  lawyer shall not collect an unreasonable fee from a client); Rule 1.15 (a lawyer\r\n  shall hold property of clients that is in a lawyerâ€™s possession in connection\r\n  with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property, in a separate\r\n  account maintained in the state where the lawyerâ€™s office is situated, and the property\r\n  shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded; complete records of\r\n  such account funds and other property shall be kept by the lawyer; a lawyer\r\n  shall comply with Rule 417, SCACR; a lawyer shall deposit into a client trust\r\n  account unearned legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance, to be\r\n  withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred); Rule\r\n  1.16(a)(2) (a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has\r\n  commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if the lawyer's\r\n  physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer's ability to\r\n  represent the client); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to\r\n  expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client); Rule 8.4(a)\r\n  (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a\r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of\r\n  justice).Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  also admits he has violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR (It shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer\r\n  to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this\r\n  jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers.).Â  Finally, respondent\r\n  admits he Â has violated Rule 417, SCACR, by not\r\n  maintaining a client trust account separate from his law firm business account\r\n  and not maintaining an accounting journal, client ledgers, records of deposit,\r\n  or monthly reconciliations related to transactions with or on behalf of his\r\n  clients.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn light of the fact that respondent\r\n  has provided substantial documentation of substance abuse that explains his\r\n  conduct in the matters set forth above, has fully cooperated with these\r\n  proceedings, has expressed significant regret and remorse and is willing to\r\n  take the necessary steps to correct his mistakes and address his addiction as\r\n  reflected in the conditions of\r\n  reinstatement to which he has agreed, we find a six month suspension is the\r\n  appropriate sanction for respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  Accordingly, we accept the\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of\r\n  law in this state for six months from the date of this opinion.Â  We deny respondentâ€™s request that the suspension\r\n  be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  Respondentâ€™s reinstatement shall be\r\n  conditioned upon his compliance with the conditions of reinstatement set forth\r\n  in the Agreement for Discipline by Consent.[3]Â \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Special Assistant Attorney General\r\n  Amie L. Clifford, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood,\r\n  for Respondent/Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  We granted\r\n  cross-petitions for writs of certiorari to review a Court of Appeals decision\r\n  which granted petitioner/respondent (Lee-Grigg) a new trial.Â  State v.\r\n    Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. 388, 649 S.E.2d 211 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We affirm the\r\n  decision to grant a new trial.\r\nFACTS[1]\r\nLee-Grigg\r\n  was the executive director of a shelter for abused women.Â  In 2003, a woman was\r\n  brought to the shelter by police officers; due to special circumstances, it was\r\n  decided that the woman should be relocated and her identity changed to protect\r\n  her from further abuse.\r\nIn an\r\n  attempt to secure funds for the victim relocation, Lee-Grigg contacted the\r\n  South Carolina Victim Assistance Network (SCVAN).Â  After discussions with\r\n  various employees of SCVAN, the executive director promised to reimburse\r\n  Lee-Grigg for mileage and a hotel room for the victim.Â  Lee-Grigg also\r\n  contacted the Greenwood South Carolina Chief of Police (Chief Brooks) and asked\r\n  whether his department could help finance the victim's relocation.Â  Chief\r\n  Brooks told Lee-Grigg that he would provide a driver, car, and fuel for the\r\n  victim's relocation.Â  Chief Brooks also said that he or the city could pay for\r\n  the victim's and driver's expenses on the trip, but not costs incurred by\r\n  Lee-Grigg.\r\nPrior\r\n  to relocating the victim, Lee-Grigg completed all the paperwork necessary to\r\n  apply for reimbursement from SCVAN.Â  The application was approved.Â  Lee-Grigg\r\n  never told anyone with SCVAN that she and the victim would be accompanied by\r\n  another individual or aided financially by another entity.\r\nGreenwood\r\n  provided a driver and gave the driver $150 in cash and a gas credit card.Â \r\n  During the trip, Lee-Grigg paid for the meals she and the victim ate, while the\r\n  driver paid for her own food.Â  After dropping the victim off at a shelter in\r\n  another state, the driver and Lee-Grigg checked into a hotel where they shared\r\n  a room.Â  The driver paid for the room out of the cash advance she received from\r\n  the city.\r\nAfter\r\n  returning to Greenwood, the driver applied to the city for reimbursement of her\r\n  expenses.Â  Attached to her application were the receipts from the trip.Â \r\n  Pursuant to city policy, the driver and Chief Brooks signed the receipts.Â \r\n  After receiving a reimbursement check in the amount of $159.56, the driver\r\n  repaid the city $150.00 for the cash advance she received prior to the trip.\r\nBoth\r\n  during the trip and after her return, Lee-Grigg gathered information necessary\r\n  to apply to SCVAN for reimbursement of the funds actually expended by the\r\n  city.Â  For instance, at the outset of the trip, Lee-Grigg asked the driver for\r\n  the vehicle's mileage.Â  Soon after returning to Greenwood, Lee-Grigg contacted\r\n  the driver and asked for the mileage on the vehicle as it appeared upon their\r\n  return.Â  Additionally, Lee-Grigg had a shelter employee call the city and get\r\n  copies of the receipts from the trip.\r\nLee-Grigg\r\n  completed a reimbursement form and submitted it to SCVAN.Â  The reimbursement\r\n  form indicated the dates of the trip, the origination and destination of the\r\n  trip, beginning and ending odometer readings on the city's vehicle, and the\r\n  total mileage driven.Â  Lee-Grigg also attached copies of the receipts she\r\n  received from the city, including receipts for meals, fuel, and the hotel\r\n  stay.Â  Lee-Grigg altered the copies of the receipts so as to remove the\r\n  signatures and initials of the driver and Chief Brooks.Â  The city also applied\r\n  to SCVAN for reimbursement of the same expenses and submitted the same\r\n  documentation, absent the alterations to the receipts made by Lee-Grigg.\r\nAfter\r\n  receiving duplicate reimbursement forms from the shelter and the city, SCVAN\r\n  contacted the shelter's board of directors.Â  After a short investigation, the\r\n  board of directors found that Lee-Grigg did not commit any wrongdoing.\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Department of Public Safety, which oversees the disbursement of\r\n  funds from SCVAN, notified the State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) of the duplicate\r\n  reimbursement requests.Â  During the course of SLED's investigation, Lee-Grigg\r\n  maintained that she and Chief Brooks agreed she would apply to SCVAN for\r\n  reimbursement of the expenses actually incurred by the city.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Lee-Grigg claimed that she removed the initials and signatures of the driver\r\n  and Chief Brooks so as to keep secret the new location of the victim.Â  We note\r\n  that Lee-Grigg did not delete or otherwise obscure the addresses of the\r\n  establishments from which the receipts were received.\r\nThe\r\n  travel reimbursement form signed by Lee-Grigg and submitted to SCVAN contained\r\n  the following statement:\r\n\r\n\tI hereby certify or affirm that the above expenses were actually\r\n  incurred by me as necessary traveling expenses in the performance of my\r\n  official duties.\r\n\r\nLee-Grigg\r\n  was indicted and tried for the offense of forgery.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Lee-Grigg's defense was that she lacked the requisite criminal intent to\r\n  commit forgery because she had a good-faith belief that she was authorized by\r\n  Chief Brooks to apply for the reimbursement.Â  In support of this defense, Lee-Grigg\r\n  presented evidence of her good character.\r\nWhile Lee-Grigg\r\n  testified that Chief Brooks authorized her to apply for reimbursement of the\r\n  city's expenses, Chief Brooks testified that he only intended to provide\r\n  limited assistance to Lee-Grigg and did not authorize her to apply to SCVAN for\r\n  reimbursement of the city's expenses.Â  Thus Lee-Grigg's state of mind and\r\n  understanding of the agreement with Chief Brooks was in issue.Â  As it concerned\r\n  her good character, Lee-Grigg presented several witnesses who testified that\r\n  she had a reputation for honesty.Â  A state elected official testified that he\r\n  knew and trusted Lee-Grigg, and three members of the shelter's board of\r\n  directors and one of its employees testified that Lee-Grigg was an excellent\r\n  executive director, and a person of great integrity and honesty.\r\nLee-Grigg's\r\n  counsel submitted several requests to charge.Â  Among these requests was one to\r\n  the effect that there is a good faith defense to the crime of forgery, and\r\n  another would have instructed the jury that it could consider evidence of\r\n  Lee-Grigg's good character when deciding whether she possessed the requisite\r\n  criminal intent to commit the crime of forgery.Â  The trial judge declined to give\r\n  the jury either of these two charges.\r\nThe\r\n  case was submitted to the jury.Â  After a little more than an hour of\r\n  deliberation, the jurors asked the judge to reinstruct them on the definition\r\n  of &quot;intent.&quot;Â  Approximately twenty minutes after receiving the\r\n  judge's supplemental instruction, the jury informed the judge that they were\r\n  deadlocked.Â  With the consent of the parties, the judge issued an Allen charge and approximately forty-five minutes later, the jury returned a guilty\r\n  verdict.Â  Lee-Grigg was sentenced to two years, suspended with probation for\r\n  one year.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision not to charge\r\n  the jury on a good-faith defense, but reversed Lee-Grigg's conviction, finding\r\n  that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on its use of\r\n  character evidence and that this error was not harmless.Â  We granted\r\n  Lee-Grigg's petition to review the good-faith defense issue and the State's\r\n  petition to review the good character issue.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err when it affirmed the \r\n\t\t\ttrial court's decision not to charge the jury on a good-faith \r\n\t\t\tdefense to the crime of forgery?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err when it reversed the \r\n\t\t\ttrial court's decision not to charge the jury as to its use of \r\n\t\t\tcharacter evidence?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Jury Charge\r\n  Concerning Good-Faith Defense\r\nLee-Grigg argues that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial\r\n  court's decision not to instruct the jury on a good-faith defense to the crime\r\n  of forgery.Â  We find the omission of this charge harmless here.\r\nLee-Grigg's intent in submitting the reimbursement form was at\r\n  issue here, and under South Carolina law, &quot;good faith&quot; can be defense\r\n  to a criminal forgery charge.Â  See Brown v. Bailey, 215 S.C. 175,\r\n  191, 54 S.E.2d 769, 776 (1949).[2]Â \r\n  We find no reversible error in the trial court's decision to decline\r\n  Lee-Grigg's requested charge, however, because as the Court of Appeals held,\r\n  the charge given here adequately conveyed to the jury the mens rea necessary for a forgery conviction.Â  State v. Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. at\r\n  407-409, 649 S.E.2d at 51.\r\n\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Jury Charge\r\n  Concerning Good Character\r\nThe State argues that the trial court's failure to charge the jury\r\n  on its consideration of character evidence was harmless, and the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred by declining to make such a finding.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is\r\n  well settled that a criminal defendant may introduce evidence of his good character.Â \r\n  Rule 404(c)(1); Rule 405, SCRE;Â  see also Â State v. Lyles, 210\r\n  S.C. 87, 92, 41 S.E.2d 625, 627 (1947).Â  Furthermore,\r\n\r\n\twhere requested and there is evidence of good character, a\r\n  defendant is entitled to an instruction to the effect that evidence of good\r\n  character and good reputation may in and of itself create a doubt as to guilt\r\n  and should be considered by the jury, along with all the other evidence, in\r\n  determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\r\n\r\nState v. Green, 278 S.C. 239, 240, 294 S.E.2d 335, 335\r\n  (1982).Â  Because Lee-Grigg presented evidence of good character and requested\r\n  that the jury be charged on its use of that evidence, the trial court erred\r\n  when it refused to give such a charge.Â  The State concedes this point but\r\n  argues that the error was harmless because the evidence presented at trial\r\n  conclusively established Lee-Grigg's guilt.Â  We disagree.\r\nHere,\r\n  the dispositive issue presented by the defense was whether Lee-Grigg believed\r\n  in good faith that she was authorized to apply for reimbursement.Â  The jurors'\r\n  request for a recharge on the definition of &quot;intent&quot; is evidence that\r\n  they were struggling with this question.Â  Character evidence of Lee-Grigg's\r\n  reputation for honesty and trustworthiness was admitted, but without an\r\n  instruction the jury was not aware that it could consider this evidence in\r\n  determining her credibility and her culpability.Â  We agree with the Court of\r\n  Appeals that this error cannot be deemed harmless.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals granting Lee-Grigg a new trial is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\r\n  in a separate opinion in which Acting Justice James E. Moore, concurs.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I\r\n  respectfully concur in result in part and dissent in part from the majority's\r\n  opinion.Â  First, I concur in result with Part A of the majority's opinion,\r\n  which concerns the issue of a good-faith defense to forgery.Â  Nonetheless, I\r\n  disagree with the majority's reasoning as it concerns this issue.Â  Second, in\r\n  my opinion, the court of appeals erred when it reversed the trial court's\r\n  decision not to charge the jury as to its use of character evidence.Â  Thus, I\r\n  dissent as to Part B of the majority's opinion.Â Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jury Charge Concerning Good-Faith\r\n  Defense\r\nIn my view, the court of appeals did not err when it\r\n  affirmed the trial court's refusal to charge the jury as to a\r\n  &quot;good-faith&quot; defense to forgery.Â  The majority, however, finds that\r\n  the trial court erred in this respect but concluded, nonetheless, that the\r\n  error was harmless.Â  In my view, there is no &quot;good-faith&quot; defense to\r\n  forgery in South Carolina[3] and I would affirm the court of appeals on this ground, stopping short of\r\n  applying a harmless error analysis.Â  Therefore, although I concur in result as\r\n  to this issue, I disagree with the majority's reasoning.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jury Charge Concerning Good\r\n  Character\r\nSecond, in my view, the court of appeals erred when it\r\n  did not recognize as harmless the trial court's failure to charge the jury as\r\n  to Lee-Grigg's good character.\r\nThe State concedes that it was error not to charge the\r\n  jury as to Lee-Grigg's character, but argues that the error was harmless\r\n  because the evidence presented at trial conclusively established Lee-Griggâ€™s guilt.Â \r\n  I agree.\r\nTo\r\n  warrant reversal, a trial judge's failure to give a requested jury instruction\r\n  must be both erroneous and prejudicial.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439,\r\n  450, 529 S.E.2d 721, 727 (2000).Â  As the court of appeals correctly noted, a\r\n  trial court's failure to instruct a jury is subject to &quot;harmless\r\n  error&quot; analysis.Â  State v. Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. 388, 411, 649 S.E.2d\r\n  41, 53 (Ct. App. 2007); see State v. Jefferies, 316 S.C. 13, 21, 446\r\n  S.E.2d 427, 431 (1994) (noting that the harmless error analysis is appropriate\r\n  where the error complained of is a &quot;trial error&quot; rather than a\r\n  &quot;structural defect&quot; in the trial mechanism itself).Â  Whether an error\r\n  is harmless depends on the circumstances of the case.Â  State v. Reeves,\r\n  301 S.C. 191, 193, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â  The materiality and prejudicial\r\n  character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire\r\n  case.Â  Id.Â  An error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless\r\n  where &quot;guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that\r\n  no other rational conclusions can be reached.&quot;Â  State v. Pagan, 369\r\n  S.C. 201, 212, 631 S.E.2d 262, 267 (2006). \r\nIn\r\n  my view, the evidence presented at trial conclusively proved that Lee-Grigg was\r\n  guilty of the crime of forgery.Â  Forgery involves the false making or material\r\n  alteration, with the intent to defraud, prejudice, or damage another, of an\r\n  instrument which serves as the foundation for legal liability.Â  State v.\r\n    Walton, 107 S.C. 353, 356, 93 S.E. 5, 6 (1917).Â  The State presented overwhelming\r\n  evidence of Lee-Grigg's guilt.Â  The jury considered uncontroverted evidence\r\n  that Lee-Grigg applied to SCVAN to obtain reimbursement for expenses she\r\n  admittedly did not incur.Â  At no time did Lee-Grigg attempt to say that she\r\n  incurred the expenses for which she sought reimbursement.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  evidence presented at trial conclusively established that Lee-Grigg altered the\r\n  city's receipts that she used to support her application for reimbursement.Â  In\r\n  short, Lee-Grigg admitted at trial that even though she represented to SCVAN\r\n  that she incurred the expenses for which she sought reimbursement, they were\r\n  actually incurred by the city.Â  Additionally, Lee-Grigg admitted at trial that\r\n  she was aware that the reimbursement application form submitted to SCVAN\r\n  misrepresented, concealed, or otherwise communicated false information.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  determining that the error was not harmless, the court of appeals was persuaded\r\n  by the details of the jury's deliberation, specifically its request for an instruction\r\n  as to the definition of criminal intent.Â  I view this analysis of the\r\n  relationship between criminal intent and good character as simply another way\r\n  of asserting a &quot;good faith&quot; defense to forgery.Â  The fact that\r\n  Lee-Grigg's forgery was motivated by a desire to help her non-profit\r\n  organization does not impact the analysis of whether she intended to commit\r\n  this crime.Â  \r\nIn my view, the uncontroverted evidence presented at\r\n  trial conclusively established that Lee-Grigg knowingly made specific\r\n  misrepresentations in her application for reimbursement from SCVAN and\r\n  supported those misrepresentations by altering the city's documentation and\r\n  claiming it as her own.Â  Lee-Grigg admitted these facts at trial.Â  Even if the\r\n  jury were instructed on its use of character evidence, given the uncontroverted\r\n  evidence presented at trial, the jury could only have reached one logical\r\n  conclusion - that Lee-Grigg was guilty of forgery.Â  Thus, I would find that the\r\n  failure to charge the jury on its use of character evidence was harmless error\r\n  and the court of appeals should be reversed on this issue.Â Â  \r\nActing Justice James E. Moore, concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A fuller version of the facts can be found in the Court of Appeals opinion.\r\n[2] The dissent characterizes the reference to a &quot;good faith&quot; defense in Brown as made &quot;hypothetically in dicta.&quot; While it may have been\r\n  hypothetical, it is not dicta.Â  Brown was a malicious prosecution case\r\n  against a bank which had instigated forgery charges against Brown. Â At the\r\n  criminal trial, Brown had admitted knowingly fabricating notes and mortgages\r\n  and witnessing/probating forged signatures on these documents.Â  Her defense to\r\n  the criminal charge was that she acted without any fraudulent intent, that is,\r\n  in good faith.Â  Brown was acquitted by a jury in her first criminal trial and\r\n  the judge directed a verdict in her favor at the second trial.Â  This malicious\r\n  prosecution suit followed.Â  The reference to the good faith defense in Brown is made during the Court's discussion of the relevancy and admissibility of\r\n  certain hearsay evidence, the holding being that while the disputed evidence\r\n  might have been competent to prove the good faith defense at the criminal\r\n  trial, it was not admissible in this malicious prosecution suit.\r\n[3] Relying upon this Court's opinion in Brown v.\r\n  Bailey, 215 S.C. 175, 54 S.E.2d 769 (1949), the majority concludes that\r\n  &quot;good-faith&quot; is a defense to forgery in South Carolina.Â  However, Brown does not recognize a good-faith defense to forgery, merely referencing the\r\n  concept hypothetically in dicta.Â  215 S.C. at 191, 54 S.E.2d at 776.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26804","title":"In the Matter of Glenburn M.

Williams, Assistant Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\t\t\t\tDesa A.\r\n  Ballard, of Law Offices of Desa Ballard, PA, of West Columbia, for\r\n  respondent.Â Â Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the\r\n  imposition of a public reprimand, definite suspension not to exceed two (2)\r\n  years, or an indefinite suspension.[1]Â \r\n  We accept the agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice\r\n  of law in this state.Â  Further, respondent agrees that, prior to seeking\r\n  reinstatement or returning to the active practice of law,[2] he will pay restitution to Attorneys'\r\n  Title Insurance Fund, Inc.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as\r\n  follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  served as a title agent for Attorneys' Title Insurance Fund, Inc. (the Fund).Â \r\n  As a title agent, respondent collected title insurance premiums from clients in\r\n  conjunction with closings he performed.Â  On at least one hundred and\r\n  seventy-two (172) occasions, respondent failed to forward the collected title\r\n  insurance premiums to the Fund.Â  On at least thirty-seven (37) of those\r\n  occasions, final title policies were not issued to the insured.Â  The amount\r\n  owed to the Fund for premiums collected by respondent but not forwarded to the\r\n  Fund is $47,456.42.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable\r\n  diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.15(d) (lawyer\r\n    shall promptly deliver to third person any funds that the third\r\n  person is entitled to receive); Rule\r\n    8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to\r\n    administration of justice).Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7,\r\n  RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding\r\n  professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in\r\n  conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts\r\n  or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to\r\n  practice law).Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn mitigation, respondent claims that he\r\n  did not intentionally withhold the Fund's title insurance premiums but failed\r\n  to disburse the premiums as a result of computer failures and inadequate manual\r\n  reconciliations of his trust account.Â  Further, respondent asserts he is in\r\n  poor health and unable to work.Â  We do note that respondent has been a member\r\n  of the South Carolina Bar for almost forty (40) years and has no prior\r\n  disciplinary history.Â  \r\nAccordingly, in light of these mitigating\r\n  circumstances, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and\r\n  indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law. Â Respondent shall not\r\n  seek reinstatement until he has paid the Fund restitution in the amount of\r\n  $47,456.42.[3]Â \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender his\r\n  certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court\r\n  and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied\r\n  with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Since formal charges were not filed prior to\r\n  January 1, 2010, an indefinite suspension remains a possible sanction under\r\n  prior Rule 7(b)(2), RLDE. Â See Amendments to the South Carolina Rules\r\n  for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Order dated October 16, 2009 (previous\r\n  disciplinary rules apply, including possible sanction of indefinite suspension,\r\n  if disciplinary complaint is pending on January 1, 2010, and formal charges\r\n  have not been filed). \r\n[2] Respondent is an inactive member of the South\r\n  Carolina Bar.Â  \r\n[3]Â The parties agree that, in the event the Lawyers\r\n  Fund for Client Protection makes any payments to the Fund as a result of\r\n  respondent's misconduct, respondent shall fully reimburse the Lawyers Fund for\r\n  Client Protection prior to seeking reinstatement.Â Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Hendricks v.

Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-45 (B) (Supp. 2009).&nbsp; Rule 60(b) provides, in part:\r\n\r\n   Mistakes;  Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court  may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order,  or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n   (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n   (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been  discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\r\n   (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;\r\n   (4) the judgment is void;\r\n   (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior  judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it  is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n   The motion shall be  made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than  one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\r\n\r\n Section 17-27-45 (B), which provides a statute of  limitations for filing PCR actions, states:\r\n\r\n   When a court whose decisions are binding upon the Supreme Court of  this State or the Supreme Court of this State holds that the Constitution of  the United States or the Constitution of South Carolina, or both, impose upon  state criminal proceedings a substantive standard not previously recognized or  a right not in existence at the time of the state court trial, and if the  standard or right is intended to be applied retroactively, an application under  this chapter may be filed not later than one year after the date on which the  standard or right was determined to exist.\r\n\r\n In  the present case, petitioner is asserting that a new substantive constitutional  standard that is to be applied retroactively entitles him to relief from the  prior judgment in this PCR case. &nbsp;Under  Section 17-27-45 (B), a claim based a new substantive constitutional standard is  to be sought by filing an application for PCR, not by filing a motion.&nbsp; Further, the statutory provision and the rule  provision on which petitioner relies are inconsistent in that a motion under Rule  60(b)(5) must be made within a reasonable period of time while statutory  provision contains a one year statute of limitations.\r\n Where, as here, the  General Assembly has provided a specific procedure to be followed in PCR cases,  and that method is inconsistent with the more general procedure of the SCRCP,  the statutory procedure must be followed.&nbsp;  Rule 71.1, SCRCP (&quot;The procedure for post-conviction relief is provided by the Uniform  Post-Conviction Procedure Act (Act), S.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 17-27-10 to -120  (1985).&nbsp; The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply to the  extent that they are not inconsistent with the Act.&quot;).&nbsp; Accordingly, we  hold that petitioner was not entitled to seek relief based on an alleged new  substantive constitutional standard by filing a motion under Rule 60(b).\r\n We dismiss the notice of  appeal and remand this matter to the circuit court with instructions to  consider his Rule 60(b) motion as an application for PCR relief.&nbsp; The motion to appoint counsel for this  appellate proceeding is denied as moot. &nbsp;The  remittitur will be sent as provided by Rule 221, SCACR.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n     s/Jean H.

(Appellant), a minor, pled guilty to two counts of\r\n  assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature&nbsp; (ABHAN).Â  The family court\r\n  ordered him committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) suspended\r\n  upon probation, and required him to register as a sex offender.Â  Appellant\r\n  appealed the requirement that he register as a sex offender.Â  We certified the\r\n  appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR and affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 2007, four juvenile petitions were filed against Appellant,\r\n  alleging lewd acts with a minor, assault with intent to commit sexual battery,\r\n  and sexual battery.Â  At issue were several instances of sexual contact\r\n  Appellant, who was fourteen years old at the time of the incidents, had with\r\n  both a ten year old boy and a twelve year old boy.[1]Â  Appellant\r\n  admitted delinquency to two amended charges of ABHAN, and all other charges\r\n  were dismissed.\r\nAt the hearing when Appellant admitted to the two charges of\r\n  ABHAN, the solicitor recommended to the judge that Appellant undergo an\r\n  inpatient evaluation and be placed on the private sex offender registry.[2]Â  The judge agreed that an inpatient\r\n  evaluation was warranted, but retained jurisdiction to render a final\r\n  disposition regarding the registry after Appellant completed the inpatient\r\n  evaluation and the report was available to the parties and the court.Â  The\r\n  inpatient sex offender evaluation was ordered to determine his risk of\r\n  re-offending and what treatment measures were necessary.Â  \r\nAfter the evaluation, Appellant appeared for the dispositional hearing.Â \r\n  After hearing arguments from both the solicitor and Appellant's counsel, and\r\n  statements from concerned individuals, Appellant was committed to DJJ,\r\n  suspended on probation.Â  As a condition of his probation, he was ordered to\r\n  undergo inpatient sexual offender treatment at the Coastal Evaluation Center\r\n  (the Center), as recommended in the Center's psychosocial evaluation report.Â \r\n  Additionally, the judge ordered Appellant to be placed on the private sex\r\n  offender registry. \r\nAt the hearing and in his order denying Appellant's motion to\r\n  alter or amend the order of probation, the judge enumerated the issues\r\n  identified in the Center's report that constitute good cause for requiring\r\n  Appellant to register, including: multiple offenses; multiple younger, same-sex\r\n  victims; a sense of victimization; denial of harm to others; borderline\r\n  intellectual functioning; and the Center's recommendation that Appellant\r\n  receive inpatient sexual offender treatment. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial\r\n  judge has broad discretion in sentencing within statutory limits.Â  Brooks v.\r\n    State, 325 S.C. 269, 271, 481 S.E.2d 712, 713 (1997).Â  A judge must be\r\n  permitted to consider any and all information that reasonably might bear on the\r\n  proper sentence for a particular defendant.Â  State v. Hicks, 377 S.C.\r\n  322, 325, 659 S.E.2d 499, 500 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  A sentence will not be\r\n  overturned absent an abuse of discretion when the ruling is based on an error\r\n  of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.Â  State v. Rice,\r\n  375 S.C. 302, 315, 652 S.E.2d 409, 415 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues that the judge improperly ordered him to register\r\n  as a sex offender because the evidence failed to support a finding of good\r\n  cause.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs Appellant notes, good cause is not defined in the statute, nor\r\n  has it been defined previously by this Court.Â  Appellant urges that without a\r\n  given definition the judge could not have articulated properly a basis for\r\n  placing Appellant on the registry.Â  However, we hold that a finding of good\r\n  cause in this context means only that the judge must consider the facts and\r\n  circumstances of the case to make the determination of whether or not the\r\n  evidence indicates a risk to reoffend sexually.Â  Such a determination is a\r\n  matter of the judge's discretion.\r\nAt the dispositional hearing, the solicitor introduced the\r\n  Center's evaluation report to support the request for Appellant to be placed on\r\n  the private sex offender registry.Â  The judge relied on the professional\r\n  findings and recommendations in that report in concluding good cause existed\r\n  for placing Appellant on the registry.Â  The record is clear that the judge\r\n  considered all the facts and circumstances of this case, both aggravating and\r\n  mitigating, in determining that there is a risk of sexual reoffense.Â  Such a\r\n  determination is supported by the evidence in the record.\r\nAccordingly, we hold the judge did not abuse his discretion in\r\n  ordering Appellant to be placed on the private sex offender registry.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, we affirm the family court's requirement that Appellant be\r\n  placed on the registry.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Appellant was friends with the two boys.Â  On two separate occasions, Appellant\r\n  entered a bathroom stall with one of the boys and attempted to get the boy to\r\n  touch Appellant's penis.Â  Twice, Appellant showed the younger boys pornographic\r\n  videos while he openly masturbated in the same room.Â  After one such incident,\r\n  Appellant performed oral sex on the older of the two boys.Â  During the second\r\n  incident, Appellant pushed the older boy onto a bed and unsuccessfully tried to\r\n  have anal sex with him. \r\n[2] Information on the private registry is not available to the general public, but\r\n  only to certain individuals, organizations, and businesses.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann.

Smoak, of Savage, Royall &amp; Sheheen, of Camden, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: This is a direct appeal from the family\r\n  courtâ€™s order requiring appellant, Timothy L. Webb (Father), to contribute to\r\n  college expenses for his son, respondent Timothy Loren Webb, Jr. (Son).Â  Because\r\n  we find that Risinger v. Risinger, 273 S.C. 36, 253 S.E.2d 652 &nbsp;(1979) was wrongly\r\n  decided and that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(A)(17)[1],\r\n  as interpreted, is unconstitutional, we reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nFather and respondent Janice Rush Sowell (Mother) divorced\r\n  in 1994.Â  Father and Mother had two children born of the marriage; Son is the\r\n  older of the two children.Â  Son turned 18 on April 13, 2005, and started\r\n  college in the fall of that same year.Â  In April 2006, Father brought an action\r\n  to reduce child support based on Sonâ€™s emancipation.Â  Mother counterclaimed for\r\n  college expenses for Son who eventually joined the legal action as a third party\r\n  defendant.Â  Mother and Father agreed to reduce Fatherâ€™s child support\r\n  obligation to reflect only support for their daughter, but the case proceeded\r\n  to trial on Motherâ€™s counterclaim regarding Sonâ€™s college expenses.\r\nMotherâ€™s\r\n  counterclaim was heard in January 2007, during Sonâ€™s fourth semester.Â  At the\r\n  outset of the hearing, Father moved to dismiss Motherâ€™s counterclaim based on\r\n  the Equal Protection clause of the federal and state constitutions.Â  In an\r\n  order denying Father's motion, the family court observed:\r\n\r\n\tWhile the Court has reviewed the motion\r\n  with some interest and follows the logic proposed by the Plaintiff, the Court\r\n  is bound by the case of Risinger v. Risinger and its progeny and\r\n  therefore determines that until there is further ruling by either the Court of\r\n  Appeals or the Supreme Court, it is appropriate in this instance to require the\r\n  Plaintiff to contribute to the support of his son's college education.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the Plaintiff's motion to dismiss on the constitutional grounds is denied.\r\n\r\nThe family court required Son to apply for â€œall grants,\r\n  scholarships and loansâ€ as well as â€œearn as much money as he can during the\r\n  summer months and holidays to defray his expenses.â€Â  Further, the family court\r\n  specifically found that Son â€œhas the obligation to carry as much of the burden\r\n  as he can.â€Â  The family court found that thereafter, Mother and Father would equally\r\n  divide all reasonable college expenses, to include tuition, books, room, board,\r\n  spending money, meals, supplies, fees, health insurance, transportation, and\r\n  any other incidental expenses.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUE\r\nDoes the family courtâ€™s order obligating Father to contribute to\r\n  Sonâ€™s college expenses violate the Equal Protection Clause?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nFather argues that this Courtâ€™s interpretation in Risinger of the statute now found at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(A)(17) violates equal\r\n  protection.Â  We agree, and find no rational basis for a rule that permits a\r\n  family court to order a parent subject to a child support order to contribute\r\n  to an emancipated child's post-secondary education.\r\n\r\n\tS.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-3-530 provides, in relevant part:\r\n\t(A)&nbsp; The family court has exclusive jurisdiction:\r\n\t. . .\r\n\t(17)Â  To make all orders for support run until further\r\n  order of the court, except that orders for child support run until the child is\r\n  eighteen years of age or until the child is married or becomes self-supporting,\r\n  as determined by the court, whichever occurs first; or without further order,\r\n  past the age of eighteen years if the child is enrolled and still attending\r\n  high school, not to exceed high school graduation or the end of the school year\r\n  after the child reaches nineteen years of age, whichever is later; or in\r\n  accordance with a preexisting agreement or order to provide for child support\r\n  past the age of eighteen years; or in the discretion of the court, to\r\n  provide for child support past age eighteen where there are physical or mental\r\n  disabilities of the child or other exceptional circumstances that warrant the\r\n  continuation of child support beyond age eighteen for as long as the physical\r\n  or mental disabilities or exceptional circumstances continue.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530 (2007).\r\nThe statute provides that child support orders terminate when the\r\n  child reaches age 18, marries, or becomes self-supporting.[2]Â  However, a court may order the\r\n  continuation of support beyond age 18 for certain &quot;exceptional\r\n  circumstances.&quot;Â  In Risinger, this Court held that a desire to\r\n  attend college may constitute such &quot;exceptional circumstances.&quot;Â  The\r\n  Court explained as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe need for education is the most likely additional\r\n  â€œexceptional circumstanceâ€ which might justify continued financial support.\r\n  Children over 18 with a physical or mental disability, and children over 18 in\r\n  need of further education, have much in common.Â  In each case, the childâ€™s\r\n  ability to earn is either diminished or entirely lacking.Â  In each case, most\r\n  parents feel an obligation to help, and do help the child.\r\n\r\nRisinger, 273 S.C. at 38, 253 S.E.2d at 653.\r\nAs\r\n  the above passage makes clear, the Risinger Court focused on the\r\n  interests of the child.Â  The instant case, however, requires us to examine the\r\n  rights of the parents.Â  Because the statute only allows for the continuation of support beyond the age of 18, the effect of the Risinger decision is\r\n  that a court may order a parent subject to a support order at the time his or\r\n  her child reaches age 18 to pay college expenses.Â  However, the statute grants\r\n  the court no such power over a parent not subject to such an order,[3] nor is there any common law duty on parents to pay for an adult childâ€™s\r\n  post-secondary education.[4]\r\nThe Equal Protection clauses of both the\r\n  federal and state constitutions provide that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.Â  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1;\r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.Â  To satisfy the Equal Protection Clause, a legislative classification must bear a reasonable relation to the\r\n  legislative purpose sought to be achieved, the members of the class must be\r\n  treated alike under similar circumstances, and the classification must rest on\r\n  some rational basis.Â  See German\r\n    Evangelical Lutheran Church of Charleston v. City of Charleston,&nbsp;352\r\n  S.C. 600, 608, 576 S.E.2d 150, 154&nbsp;(2003).\r\nWe view the appropriate\r\n  class as those parents subject to a child support order at the time of the\r\n  child's emancipation and can discern no\r\n  rational basis for the varied treatment of the class as compared to those\r\n  parents who are not subject to such an order.[5]Â \r\n  We therefore find that the statute, as interpreted by Risinger, fails\r\n  the rational basis test and thus, does not meet the constitutional requirements\r\n  of Equal Protection.[6]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find\r\n  that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(A)(17), as interpreted in Risinger,\r\n  violates the Equal Protection Clause.Â  We therefore reverse the trial court's\r\n  denial of Father's motion to dismiss.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER and\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion. KITTREDGE,\r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal: I\r\n  respectfully dissent.Â  Appellant argues that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(A)(17),\r\n  as interpreted by Risinger v. Risinger, 273 S.C. 36, 253 S.E.2d 652\r\n  (1979), violates the equal protection clauses of the United States and South\r\n  Carolina constitutions.Â  I disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;In reviewing a statute challenged on equal\r\n  protection grounds, great deference is given to the classification created, and\r\n  it will be sustained if supported by any reasonable hypothesis and not plainly\r\n  arbitrary.&quot;Â  Mitchell v. Owens, 304 S.C. 23, 24-25, 402 S.E.2d 888,\r\n  889 (1991), citing Samson v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 295 S.C. 359,\r\n  368 S.E.2d 665 (1988).Â  Furthermore, a statute enacted pursuant to legislative\r\n  power is presumptively constitutional. Â Nichols v. S.C. Research Auth., 290 S.C. 415, 351 S.E.2d 155 (1986).Â Finally,\r\n  this Court has consistently held it will not construe a statute to do that\r\n  which is unconstitutional.Â  See Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 19, 538\r\n  S.E.2d 245, 247 (2000), citing Mitchell v. Owens, 304 S.C. 23, 402\r\n  S.E.2d 888 (1991) (holding that statutes are presumed to be constitutional and\r\n  will be construed so as to render them valid).Â  \r\nAs a threshold matter, I must address the\r\n  classification relied upon by the majority because it is not one before the\r\n  Court.Â  The majority holds that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(A)(17), as\r\n  interpreted by Risinger, violates the equal protection clauses of the\r\n  United States and South Carolina constitutions, finding that there is no\r\n  rational basis for what it perceives to be the government's disparate treatment\r\n  of parents subject to support orders prior to a child's emancipation and\r\n  parents not subject to support orders prior to a child's emancipation.Â \r\n  Appellant did not raise this argument,[7] but rather asserted that section 63-3-530(A)(17) violates equal protection\r\n  because it treats divorced and non-divorced parents differently.Â  Thus, in my\r\n  view, the majority erroneously relies upon an argument not before the Court.Â Â Â  \r\nNonetheless, assuming Appellant raised the\r\n  classification relied upon by the majority, section 63-3-530(A)(17) does not\r\n  treat such classes disparately.Â  Section 63-3-530(A)(17) grants the family\r\n  court jurisdiction to order continuation of a support order entered prior to a\r\n  child's emancipation, but the jurisdiction granted to the family court is not\r\n  confined to such situations.Â  Section 63-3-530(A)(17) also grants jurisdiction\r\n  to award support for post-secondary education &quot;in the discretion of the\r\n  court.&quot;Â  That is, the court may order a parent to provide support to cover\r\n  the expenses of exceptional circumstances encountered by an emancipated child,\r\n  such as post-secondary education, whether or not there was a support order in\r\n  effect prior to the child's emancipation.[8]Â  \r\nTurning to the classification actually raised by\r\n  Appellant, I do not agree that section 63-3-530(A)(17) treats divorced parents\r\n  and non-divorced parents differently.Â  Section 63-3-530(A)(17) does not apply\r\n  only to divorced parents.[9]Â \r\n  As this Court has noted in a case that dealt with support for an unemancipated\r\n  disabled adult child, this statutory section &quot;treats divorced parents the\r\n  same as all other parents.&quot;Â  Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 236, 578\r\n  S.E.2d 3, 6 (2003).Â  In Riggs, we therefore found no merit to the\r\n  husband's equal protection argument.Â  Accordingly, pursuant to Riggs,\r\n  there can be no equal protection violation in the instant case because no such\r\n  legislative classification is made by the applicable clause of section\r\n  63-3-530(A)(17).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFor these reasons, I would hold that the family court's order\r\n  should be affirmed.Â  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  I join Chief Justice Toal in dissent in rejecting the equal\r\n  protection challenge to section 63-3-530(A)(17) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  I write separately because my view of the equal protection challenge\r\n  and Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 578 S.E.2d 3 (2003) differs from that of\r\n  the Chief Justice.Â  Because I would affirm the family court, I would address\r\n  Appellant's remaining issue.Â  I believe legislative intent concerning a\r\n  parent's potential obligation to financially contribute to his or her child's\r\n  college education includes a limitation to the cost of a South Carolina\r\n  publicly supported college or university.Â  I would, therefore, remand to the\r\n  family court to determine if Appellantâ€™s contribution should be modified.\r\nI.\r\nI join the Chief Justice in result as to the\r\n  constitutionality of section 63-3-530(A)(17) (Supp. 2008) (the successor\r\n  statute to section 20-7-420(A)(17) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007)) insofar\r\n  as it reflects legislative intent to authorize the family court to order parents\r\n  to contribute to their childâ€™s college educational expenses under the Risinger[10] framework.Â  Risingerâ€™s construction of legislative intent has stood the\r\n  test of time, as the Legislature has amended many subsections of this\r\n  jurisdictional statute through the intervening thirty years, but the\r\n  â€œexceptional circumstancesâ€ language in subsection (A)(17) remains largely\r\n  unchanged.\r\nAs Chief Justice Toal notes, the majority has ignored\r\n  our issue preservation rules and redefined the class in a manner not presented\r\n  â€œbelow, in brief, or at oral argument.â€ Â (Toal, C.J., dissent at n. 1). Â The\r\n  majority so acknowledges in footnote 5, â€œ[t]hough Appellant does not raise this\r\n  specific classification, we note that this Court is asked, on appeal, to\r\n  reconsider the validity of Risinger.&quot;Â  \r\nFrom a\r\n  policy standpoint, the decision of the majority may be easily understood.Â  A\r\n  legislative policy of treating children of separated, divorced, or unmarried\r\n  parents differently than children of married parents for purposes of requiring\r\n  parental financial support to attend college is most assuredly a debatable\r\n  proposition.Â  Because no suspect classification is involved, however, the\r\n  standard of review is deferential.Â  Against an equal protection challenge\r\n  implicating no suspect classification, a court must sustain the legislation if\r\n  it is reasonably related to the legislative purpose sought to be achieved, members\r\n  of the class are treated alike under similar circumstances, and the classification\r\n  rests on some rational relationship.Â  German Evangelical Lutheran Church of\r\n    Charleston v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 600, 608, 576 S.E.2d 150, 154\r\n  (2003); see also In re Marriage of Vrban, 293 N.W.2d 198, 201\r\n  (Iowa 1980) (applying the rational relationship test as neither a suspect class\r\n  nor a fundamental right are implicated); In re Marriage of Kohring, 999\r\n  S.W.2d 228, 232-33 (Mo. 1999) (finding no equal protection violation because\r\n  there was no involvement of a suspect class, no infringement of a fundamental\r\n  right, and the existence of a rational relationship to legitimate state\r\n  interest); Childers v. Childers, 575 P.2d 201, 209 (Wash. 1978)\r\n  (applying rational relationship test).\r\nAlthough the policy rationale underlying section\r\n  63-3-530(A)(17) is subject to debate, I believe the statute survives an equal\r\n  protection challenge.Â  I thus vote to affirm the family court and uphold the\r\n  statute on the basis that it satisfies the rational basis test.Â  Having\r\n  rejected the equal protection argument, I return to this Courtâ€™s construction\r\n  in Risinger of the â€œexceptional circumstancesâ€ statutory language.Â  In\r\n  this regard, I am especially mindful of the more than three decades that the\r\n  Legislature has left the statutory interpretation of Risinger in place. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 736 (1977) (recognizing that\r\n  â€œconsiderations of stare decisis weigh heavily in the area of statutory\r\n  construction, where Congress is free to change\r\n  this Court's interpretation of its legislationâ€).Â  I would defer to the Legislature, and if the\r\n  Legislature, as a policy matter, wants to overrule Risinger's statutory\r\n  construction, they are certainly free to do so.Â  Â \r\n\r\nII.\r\nI respectfully disagree with Chief Justice Toalâ€™s view,\r\n  as extrapolated from Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 578 S.E.2d 3 (2003),\r\n  that the Legislature intended to authorize the family court to order parents of\r\n  intact families to contribute to the college educational expenses of their\r\n  children.Â  I do not read Riggs that broadly.Â  Riggs dealt with a\r\n  disabled adult child and targeted statutory language authorizing the family\r\n  court to order â€œchild support past age eighteen where there are physical or\r\n  mental disabilities.â€Â  Id. at 234, 578 S.E.2d at 5 (quoting from S.C.\r\n  Code Â§ 20-7-420(A)(17), the predecessor to Â§ 63-3-530(A)(17)).Â  The Court\r\n  relied initially on â€œa common law duty of parental support for a child who has\r\n  reached majority but is so physically or mentally disabled as to be unable to\r\n  support herself.â€ Â Id. at 234-35, 578 S.E.2d at 5.Â  Riggs observed\r\n  that â€œ[w]here the disability prevents the child from becoming emancipated, the\r\n  presumption of emancipation upon reaching majority is inapplicable.â€Â  Id. at 235, 578 S.E.2d at 5.\r\nThe Court in Riggs next construed the language\r\n  of section 20-7-420(A)(17) which authorized the family court to order â€œchild\r\n  support past age eighteen where there are physical or mental disabilities.â€Â  Id. at 234-35, 578 S.E.2d at 5.Â  Riggs found the statutory provision â€œto be\r\n  consistent with this common law duty and h[e]ld the family court is vested with\r\n  jurisdiction to order child support for an unemancipated disabled adult\r\n  child.â€Â  Id. at 235, 578 S.E.2d at 5.\r\nThe issue of an unemancipated disabled adult child,\r\n  with its common law underpinnings, is a far cry from a non-disabled adult child\r\n  who wants to attend college.Â  Imposing a duty of support in the former\r\n  situation (through the common law and statutorily) is easily understandable.Â \r\n  In the absence of a clear expression of legislative intent, I would not venture\r\n  beyond Risinger.Â  Accordingly, I would hold that legislative approval\r\n  for the family court ordering a parent to contribute to his or her adult\r\n  childâ€™s college educational expenses is limited to children of separated,\r\n  divorced, or unmarried parents.\r\nIII.\r\nBecause I reject Appellantâ€™s constitutional challenge\r\n  and vote to affirm the family court, I would address Appellantâ€™s contention\r\n  concerning the scope of his financial obligation.Â  My assessment of legislative\r\n  intent is that a parentâ€™s contribution should be determined and limited based\r\n  on the cost of a South Carolina publicly supported college or university.Â  Respondent\r\n  suggests it is unfair to limit a childâ€™s selection to a South Carolina publicly\r\n  supported college or university.Â  I agree with Respondent on that point, but I\r\n  view the issue differently.Â  The issue, as I see it, is to what degree the\r\n  Legislature has authorized the family court to compel the contribution of a\r\n  parent to an adult childâ€™s college education.Â  Given that Risinger discerned legislative intent from the â€œexceptional circumstancesâ€ provision, I\r\n  find it incongruous that the Legislature would place no reasonable limitation\r\n  on a parentâ€™s contribution.\r\nThe Risinger framework entails a host of limitations\r\n  as a function of legislative intent, including consideration of the adult\r\n  childâ€™s ability to work to defray college expenses, exhaustion of scholarships,\r\n  availability of student loans, and the parentâ€™s ability to contribute. Â Regardless\r\n  of a parentâ€™s wealth, the Risinger factors will apply in all cases.Â  As\r\n  I construe legislative intent, it matters not that a parent can easily afford\r\n  the most expensive college education.Â  Parents will often allow an adult child\r\n  to attend the college of his or her choice, but that is a voluntary decision\r\n  free from governmental interference.[11]Â \r\n  I do not believe the Legislature has authorized the family court to accept an\r\n  adult childâ€™s college selection without regard to the costs.Â  I believe a\r\n  limitation to a South Carolina publicly supported college or university is in\r\n  accord with legislative intent as set forth in Risinger.\r\nIV.\r\nI respectfully dissent.Â  I would affirm the order of\r\n  the family court requiring Appellant, pursuant to section 63-3-530(A)(17), to\r\n  contribute to the sonâ€™s college educational expenses.Â  But I would limit\r\n  Appellantâ€™s contribution to what his pro rata assessment would have been at a South Carolina publicly supported college or university. Â Accordingly, I would remand to\r\n  the family court to determine if Appellantâ€™s contribution should be modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; This statute was previously codified at Â§ 20-7-420(17).\r\n[2]&nbsp; Of course, this portion of the statute and the Risinger case do not\r\n  address situations in which a parent seeks to enforce an agreement regarding\r\n  post-secondary education expenses. \r\n[3]&nbsp; We disagree with the Chief Justice's interpretation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-3-530(A)(17).Â  Though statutes are presumed constitutional and, if possible,\r\n  will be construed to render them valid, we cannot ignore the plain reading of\r\n  the statute.Â  See State v. Mills, 360 S.C. 621, 624, 602 S.E.2d\r\n  750, 752 (2004) (despite rule of construction, &quot;when the terms of the\r\n  statute are clear and unambiguous, we are constrained to give them their\r\n  literal meaning.&quot;).Â  The portion of the statute cited by the Chief\r\n  Justice's dissent plainly allows only for the &quot;continuation of\r\n  child support beyond age eighteen . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-3-530(A)(17) (emphasis added).\r\n[4]&nbsp; We confine our opinion to post-secondary education only.\r\n[5]&nbsp; Though Appellant does not raise this specific classification, we note that this\r\n  Court is asked, on appeal, to reconsider the validity of Risinger.Â \r\n  Having found that this Court's prior interpretation of the statute created an\r\n  unconstitutional classification, we feel bound to remedy the error.Â  See Am. Petroleum Inst. v. South Carolina Dep't of Revenue, 382 S.C. 572,\r\n  580, 677 S.E.2d 16, 20 (2009) (duty of this Court to determine if statute\r\n  exceeds the bounds of the constitution).\r\n[6]&nbsp; Because we find that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(A)(17), as interpreted by Risinger,\r\n  violates Equal Protection, we need not decide the remaining issue.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (appellate court need not discuss remaining issues when\r\n  disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n[7]&nbsp; Appellant never raised this argument below, in brief, or at oral argument.Â  \r\n[8]&nbsp; The majority ignores this reading of section 63-3-530(A)(17) as well as\r\n  precedent requiring it, where possible, to construe statutes in a\r\n  constitutional manner.Â  See Ward, 343 S.C. at 19, 538 S.E.2d at 247\r\n  (holding this Court will not construe a statute to do that which is\r\n  unconstitutional).\r\n[9]&nbsp; In relevant part, the statute at issue provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe family court\r\n  has exclusive jurisdiction: â€¦\r\n\t(17) To make all\r\n  orders for support run until further order of the court, except that orders for\r\n  child support run until the child is eighteen years of age or until the child\r\n  is married or becomes self-supporting, as determined by the court, whichever occurs\r\n  first; or without further order, past the age of eighteen years if the child is\r\n  enrolled and still attending high school, not to exceed high school graduation\r\n  or the end of the school year after the child reaches nineteen years of age,\r\n  whichever is later; or in accordance with a preexisting agreement or order\r\n    to provide for child support past the age of eighteen years; or in the\r\n    discretion of the court, to provide for child support past age eighteen where\r\n    there are physical or mental disabilities of the child or other exceptional\r\n    circumstances that warrant the continuation of child support beyond age\r\n    eighteen for as long as the physical or mental disabilities or exceptional\r\n    circumstances continue.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n[10]&nbsp; Risinger v.

Jones's (Petitioner) request for a\r\n  writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision in Jones v. Lott, 379 S.C. 285, 665 S.E.2d 642\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008) affirming the trial court's grant of a directed verdict in\r\n  favor of Leon Lott (Respondent).\r\nFacts/Procedural History\r\nLinn Pitts (Pitts)\r\n  and Gilbert Gallegos (Gallegos), members of Richland County Sheriff's\r\n  Department, attempted to pull over Chad Jones (Jones) because Jones committed a\r\n  traffic violation.Â  When the officers checked the tags on the vehicle, they\r\n  were alerted it was stolen.Â  Jones refused to stop so the officers pursued\r\n  him.Â  Eventually, Jones wrecked into an air conditioning unit at the Waverly\r\n  Street apartments.Â  Jones fled the scene on foot and dropped a .22 caliber\r\n  revolver.Â  The officers found Jones in the laundry room of a nearby house\r\n  where, after a brief struggle, he was apprehended.Â  The officers found a clear\r\n  plastic container they believed contained crack cocaine.[1]Â \r\n  The officers handcuffed Jones and placed him in the rear of Pitts's police\r\n  cruiser while they began preparing the requisite paperwork accompanying the\r\n  arrest.Â Â Â  \r\nJones was arrested\r\n  for ten criminal and traffic offenses.[2]Â \r\n  At the time of his arrest, Jones gave officers a false name.Â  However, a\r\n  Columbia Police Department officer on the scene correctly identified Jones.Â  A\r\n  check revealed Jones had outstanding warrants for attempted burglary, assault\r\n  with intent to kill, and assault and battery with intent to kill.Â  \r\nWhile the officers\r\n  were preparing their paperwork, Pitts and Gallegos noticed Jones fidgeting in\r\n  the backseat of the cruiser.Â  A third officer, Clark Frady (Frady), who had\r\n  arrived with a transport van, assisted Gallegos in removing Jones from the\r\n  cruiser and conducting a pat down search.Â  The officers again secured Jones in\r\n  the backseat of the cruiser with his hands handcuffed behind his back and his\r\n  seatbelt fastened.Â  Initially, the officers left the cruiser windows open, but\r\n  closed them because Jones continued to yell out to passersby.Â  Because it was a\r\n  warm day, Pitts left the engine running so the air conditioning could operate,\r\n  and opened the interior Plexiglas window to let the air reach Jones. \r\nThereafter, Jones\r\n  maneuvered his handcuffed hands to the front of his body, squeezed through the\r\n  open Plexiglas window into the driver's seat, and locked the doors.Â  The\r\n  officers noticed Jones in the front seat when they heard the sound of him\r\n  turning the key to the already running cruiser.Â  The officers yelled for Jones\r\n  to stop and unlock the doors.Â  Gallegos unsuccessfully attempted to break the\r\n  front driver's side window with his baton.Â  Gallegos then ran to his own\r\n  cruiser, anticipating another pursuit, while Pitts tried to unlock the\r\n  passenger side door with his key.\r\nJones placed the\r\n  cruiser in reverse, backed up, and stopped.Â  Both Pitts and Frady positioned\r\n  themselves in front of the cruiser and shouted at Jones to stop the vehicle and\r\n  turn off the engine.Â  Jones placed the cruiser in drive, slumped in the\r\n  driver's seat, accelerated, and cut left toward Pitts.Â  Pitts moved out of the\r\n  way and fired a shot into the rear hubcap.Â  Jones then turned the cruiser and\r\n  drove directly at Frady, who fired twice into the vehicle.Â  One of Frady's\r\n  shots struck Jones in the back of the head, killing him.Â  \r\nJones's estate\r\n  brought a wrongful death and survival action against Respondent, Pitts,\r\n  Gallegos, and Frady, individually and in their official capacities with the\r\n  Richland County Sheriff's Department based on allegations of negligence and\r\n  civil conspiracy.Â  The circuit court granted a motion for summary judgment to\r\n  the defendants below, but allowed the case to proceed against Respondent in his\r\n  official capacity as to the gross negligence claim.Â  The circuit court\r\n  ultimately granted Respondent's motion for a directed verdict at the close of\r\n  Petitioner's case on the following grounds: (1) the deputies did not owe a duty\r\n  to Jones to secure him in the back of the cruiser in a manner that made it\r\n  impossible to escape; (2) any negligence on the deputies' part in securing\r\n  Jones in the cruiser was outweighed as a matter of law under our comparative\r\n  negligence standard by Jones's actions in his escape attempt; (3) the use of deadly\r\n  force by the deputies in that situation was objectively reasonable as a matter\r\n  of law; and (4) the Sheriff's Department was entitled to immunity under S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(6) (2005) for the method of providing police protection.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal to the court of appeals, Petitioner argued the circuit court erred in\r\n  granting Respondent's motion for a directed verdict on the following grounds:\r\n  (1) the deputies had no duty to Jones with respect to the manner in which they\r\n  confined and secured him upon taking him into custody; (2) the use of deadly\r\n  force by the deputies was objectively reasonable as a matter of law; and (3)\r\n  Jones's attempted escape outweighed any negligence on the part of the deputies\r\n  in failing to secure him.Â  The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court on\r\n  two grounds: (1) because Petitioner failed to appeal the circuit court's grant\r\n  of a directed verdict on the issue of Respondent's immunity under section\r\n  15-78-60(6), the circuit court's ruling on that issue became the law of the\r\n  case and warranted affirmance under the two issue rule, and (2) section\r\n  15-78-60(21) provided an additional sustaining ground upon which to affirm the\r\n  circuit court.[3]\r\nIssues\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in finding that the \r\n\t\t\tlower court's ruling under section 15-78-60(6) was not raised as an \r\n\t\t\tissue for appeal?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in finding that \r\n\t\t\tRespondent was entitled to immunity under section 15-78-60(21) as an \r\n\t\t\tadditional sustaining ground?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen\r\n  considering a directed verdict motion, the trial court is required to view the\r\n  evidence and the inferences that can be drawn from that evidence in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Hinkle v.

Â For example, if a court directs a\r\n  verdict for a defendant on the basis of the defenses of statute of limitations\r\n  and contributory negligence, the order would be affirmed under the &quot;two\r\n  issue&quot; rule if the plaintiff failed to appeal both grounds or if one of the\r\n  grounds required affirmance.\r\n\r\nAnderson v.

S.C. Dep't of Corrs., 297 S.C. 95, 105, 374 S.E.2d 910, 916&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1988).Â  &quot;When a governmental entity asserts multiple exceptions to\r\n  the waiver of immunity and at least one of the exceptions contains a gross\r\n  negligent standard, we must interpolate the gross negligence standard into the\r\n  other exceptions.&quot;Â  Proctor v. Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control,\r\n  368 S.C. 279, 311, 628 S.E.2d 496, 513&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  However, this\r\n  Court has held that &quot;the better practice is to allow the government to\r\n  assert all relevant exceptions, and apply the gross negligence standard to all\r\n  when it is contained in one applicable exception.&quot;Â  Steinke v. S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 397, 520 S.E.2d 142,\r\n  154&nbsp;(1999).\r\nPetitioner argues\r\n  he appealed the trial court's grant of a directed verdict on the issue of\r\n  Respondent's immunity under section 15-78-60(6) because the argument was subsumed\r\n  in the central issue of the case, which addresses the trial judge's ruling that\r\n  the officers were not negligent or grossly negligent.Â  Petitioner contends that\r\n  in issue two of his appellate brief to the court of appeals he argued that\r\n  where multiple exceptions to the waiver of immunity are invoked and at least\r\n  one of those exceptions contains a gross negligence standard, the courts must\r\n  interpolate the gross negligence standard into the other exceptions.Â \r\n  Specifically, Petitioner argues the gross negligence standard of section\r\n  15-78-60(25) applies to all claims of immunity raised by Respondent, including\r\n  sections 15-78-60(6) and (21).Â  \r\nPetitioner's second\r\n  issue on appeal to the court of appeals states, &quot;Did the trial court err\r\n  in finding the use of deadly force by the Richland County deputies was\r\n  objectively reasonable, as a matter of law, and that the officers were not\r\n  negligent, as a matter of law?&quot;Â  There was no mention of section\r\n  15-78-60(6) or Tort Claims Act immunity.Â  Moreover, the second issue does not\r\n  reference a &quot;gross negligence&quot; standard.Â  This left the court of\r\n  appeals to &quot;grope in the dark&quot; to ascertain the precise point at\r\n  issue.Â  The issue raised by Petitioner was not concise and direct, but rather a\r\n  broad general statement that ought to be disregarded by this Court.Â  Hence,\r\n  because Petitioner failed to preserve the issue for review, it became the law\r\n  of the case under the two issue rule.Â  Therefore, the court of appeals was\r\n  correct in holding Respondent was entitled to immunity under section\r\n  15-78-60(6).Â Â Â  \r\nPetitioner's\r\n  contention that section 15-78-60(25)'s gross negligence standard should be\r\n  interpolated into the other pleaded exceptions is misplaced.Â  Respondent never\r\n  raised an affirmative defense that contained a gross negligence standard.Â \r\n  Thus, under this Court's holding in Steinke, the gross negligence\r\n  standard is not interpolated into either section 15-78-60(6) or (21).Â  Also,\r\n  Respondent raised section 15-78-60(21) as an additional ground in his directed\r\n  verdict motion.Â  Petitioner's central objection to section 15-78-60(21) is that\r\n  the gross negligence standard applies to that section.Â  However, as noted above\r\n  the gross negligence standard does not apply because Respondent did not plead a\r\n  section containing a gross negligence standard.Â  Thus, the court of appeals\r\n  correctly held that section 15-78-60(21) was an additional sustaining ground.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nB.&nbsp; Edwards\r\nPetitioner\r\n  also contends this Court's recent decision in Edwards v. Lexington County\r\n    Sheriff's Dep't,&nbsp;__ S.C. __, 688 S.E.2d 125&nbsp;(2010) supports the\r\n  proposition that the officers owed a duty of care to Jones by virtue of a\r\n  special relationship they had with Jones.Â  In Edwards, this Court held\r\n  the Lexington County Sheriff's Department (Lexington) owed Teresa Edwards\r\n  (Edwards) a duty of care because Lexington created a situation in which it was\r\n  foreseeable that Allen Baker (Baker) would harm Edwards.Â  Edwards, __\r\n  S.C. at __, 688 S.E.2d at 130.Â  In that case, Lexington was well aware of Baker's unrelenting violent\r\n  tendencies toward Edwards.[5]Â  Id. Â Moreover, this Court stressed that our holding in Edwards resulted from the unique facts of that case. Â Id.\r\nThe\r\n  present case is simply inapposite to our holding in Edwards.Â  Jones was\r\n  trying to escape the custody of a governmental entity.Â  Jones's attempted\r\n  escape places this case squarely within one of the exceptions in section\r\n  15-78-60.Â  Section 15-78-60(21) provides a governmental entity is not liable\r\n  for a loss resulting from &quot;the decision to or implementation of release,\r\n  discharge, parole, or furlough of any persons in the custody of any\r\n  governmental entity . . . or the escape of these persons.&quot;Â  Hence, even if\r\n  all of Petitioner's issues were preserved for review, the deputies would still\r\n  be immune from suit pursuant to section 15-78-60(21) because Jones was trying\r\n  to escape.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nBecause\r\n  Petitioner failed to appeal the circuit court's holding that Respondent was\r\n  entitled to immunity under section 15-78-60(6), that finding became the law of\r\n  the case under the two issue rule.Â  Also, the court of appeals correctly held\r\n  that section 15-78-60(21) provided an additional sustaining ground to the\r\n  circuit court's findings.Â  Lastly, even if all of Petitioner's issues were\r\n  preserved for review, the deputies would still be immune from suit pursuant to\r\n  section 15-78-60(21).Â  Hence, for the aforementioned reasons, the decision of\r\n  the court of appeals is affirmed.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  and Acting Justice Steven H.

Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\t\t\t\tJane\r\n  Matthews Moody, of Blackville, pro se.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter,\r\n  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the\r\n  imposition of a definite suspension not to exceed two (2) years with conditions\r\n  and payment of costs.Â  See Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  She requests the suspension be made retroactive to the\r\n  date of her interim suspension. [1]Â \r\n  We accept the Agreement and impose a definite suspension of two years with\r\n  conditions and payment of costs.Â  The suspension shall run retroactively from the\r\n  date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the\r\n  Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  operated a solo practice in Barnwell for approximately fifteen years.Â  In\r\n  October 2007, she closed her law office after training to teach high school.Â \r\n  At the time, respondent had more than fourteen active clients.Â  She did not\r\n  notify her clients, opposing counsel, or the courts that she had ceased\r\n  practicing law. Â Further, although she had ceased going to her office, she did\r\n  not make arrangements to have her mail forwarded or to notify the South\r\n  Carolina Bar of her current mailing address.Â  \r\nIn April 2008,\r\n  respondent was suspended from the practice of law for non-payment of license\r\n  fees.Â  In June 2008, she was suspended for failure to comply with mandatory\r\n  continuing legal education requirements.Â  Respondent did not notify her clients\r\n  that she had been suspended.\r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to respond to several inquiries from ODC and to Notices of Full\r\n  Investigation.Â  Although she did appear to give statements pursuant to subpoena\r\n  in two matters, she did not produce all of the subpoenaed records or her trust\r\n  account records.Â  On October 1, 2009, respondent was placed on interim\r\n  suspension after she failed to respond to subsequent disciplinary inquiries and\r\n  failed to appear for a Rule 19(c), RLDE, interview in September 2009.Â  Id.Â \r\n  At the time of her interim suspension, respondent still had not informed her\r\n  clients that she had closed her law office.Â  \r\nMatter I\r\nOn October 30,\r\n  2007, ODC sent respondent the complaint from Complainant A with a request that\r\n  she respond in writing within fifteen days.Â  When no response was received by\r\n  December 4, 2007, ODC sent respondent a reminder letter requesting her\r\n  immediate response.Â  Respondent did not open either letter because she had\r\n  allowed mail to gather and remain unopened in her law office.Â  \r\nOn January 22,\r\n  2008, ODC issued a Notice of Full Investigation which was subsequently returned\r\n  by the post office marked &quot;unclaimed.&quot;Â  On February 27, 2008, a SLED\r\n  agent served the notice on respondent at the high school where she was employed.Â \r\n  The notice required respondent to provide a written response within thirty\r\n  days, but respondent did not respond.Â  On May 6, 2008, respondent appeared at\r\n  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel pursuant to subpoena and gave a Rule\r\n  19(c)(5), RLDE, statement under oath.Â  Â \r\nBased on\r\n  respondent's statement and review of the client file, ODC has determined that\r\n  respondent was appointed to represent Complainant A in a post-conviction relief\r\n  action in the summer of 2006.Â  Respondent appeared on Complainant A's behalf at\r\n  the PCR hearing in August 2007.Â  The PCR judge indicated that he was denying\r\n  the PCR application and instructed the attorney for the State to prepare a\r\n  formal order.Â  At that time, respondent briefly discussed the denial of the\r\n  application with Complainant A and told him that, while an appeal was possible,\r\n  she did not believe there were any meritorious issues.Â  \r\nAfter the\r\n  hearing respondent took no action on behalf of Complainant A.Â  At the time she\r\n  closed her law office in October 2007, she had not received the proposed order\r\n  from the attorney for the State.Â  Respondent neither notified Complainant A,\r\n  the court, or opposing counsel that she had closed her office, nor provided\r\n  them with new contact information.Â  Respondent did not regularly collect or\r\n  open her mail at the law office from October 2007 forward.Â  \r\nAs of May 2008,\r\n  when respondent appeared at ODC pursuant to Rule 19(c)(5), RLDE, she did not\r\n  know the status of Complainant A's case.Â  In June 2008, respondent had a\r\n  colleague send Complainant A a copy of the order in his PCR action.Â  At no time\r\n  did respondent file a notice of appeal, advise Complainant A of the time\r\n  limitations on his ability to appeal, or provide him with his file so that he\r\n  could pursue the matter.Â  \r\nMatter\r\n  II\r\nIn late 2004, Complainant B retained\r\n  respondent to file for reconsideration of a denial of Social Security\r\n  benefits.Â  Respondent filed the request for reconsideration; it was denied in\r\n  July 2005.Â  Respondent then filed a request for an administrative hearing.Â  Because\r\n  of the delay in obtaining administrative hearings, it was respondent's practice\r\n  to wait a year from the date of the request before contacting the Social\r\n  Security Administration about the status of the request for a hearing.Â  However,\r\n  respondent took no action on Complainant B's behalf after filing the request\r\n  for hearing.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  did not communicate with Complainant B after the first of 2006.Â  She did not\r\n  notify Complainant B or the Administrative Law Judge's office that she closed\r\n  her law office in October 2007.Â  Respondent did not receive or respond to a\r\n  certified letter sent to her by Complainant B in March 2008 because she did not\r\n  routinely retrieve or open mail sent to her law office address.Â  Â \r\nRespondent\r\n  did submit a response to the Notice of Full Investigation in this matter.Â  She\r\n  appeared to give an interview on October 3, 2008.Â  Respondent had been served\r\n  with a subpoena to bring the client file, but she did not produce the client\r\n  file at the interview.Â  She stated she had mailed the original file to\r\n  Complainant B, but had retained a copy.Â  At the conclusion of the interview, ODC instructed respondent to deliver the file immediately.Â  As of the date of\r\n  the Agreement, respondent had not produced the file and had not responded to\r\n  further contact from ODC.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nOn April\r\n  13, 2007, Mr. and Mrs. Doe paid respondent $1,100.00 to assist them in adopting\r\n  the child of their deceased daughter-in-law.Â  On April 17, 2007, the Does' son\r\n  signed a termination of parental rights.Â  Respondent's file contained a draft\r\n  Complaint and Petition for Appointment of Guardian ad Litem dated June 29,\r\n  2007.Â  Respondent took no action in the matter after June 29, 2007.Â  Respondent\r\n  did not communicate with Mr. and Mrs. Doe after June 2007, did not notify them\r\n  that she closed her office in October 2007, or that she was suspended in April\r\n  2008.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  did not submit a written response to the Notice of Full Investigation in this\r\n  matter.Â  She did respond to questions when she appeared at ODC in October\r\n  2008.Â  At that time, respondent was unsure if she actually filed the action for\r\n  Mr. and Mrs. Doe.Â  She agreed at that time to contact the court to find out and\r\n  provide the information to ODC within fifteen days.Â  Respondent did not provide\r\n  the information as requested and did not communicate with ODC about this matter\r\n  since that time.Â  \r\nAt the\r\n  time respondent represented Mr. and Mrs. Doe, she did not maintain a client\r\n  trust account.Â  It was her practice to convert payments received from her clients\r\n  to cash and hold it in the file until she needed it for filing fees and other\r\n  expenses.Â  Respondent charged flat fees for her work, but did not hold the\r\n  funds in trust until earned.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nOn May 31, 2007, respondent received a fee of $700.00\r\n  to handle a name change for Complainant C.Â  Respondent did not hold the fee in\r\n  trust until it was earned.Â  Respondent did not take any meaningful action on\r\n  behalf of Complainant C and, to date, respondent had not returned the fee.Â \r\n  Respondent did not respond to the Notice of Full Investigation in this matter.Â  \r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Complainant D in a domestic matter that was concluded in July\r\n  2007.Â  Sometime after the end of that representation, Complainant D asked\r\n  respondent for her client file.Â  Because Complainant D moved out of state,\r\n  disconnected her local telephone number, and changed her name, respondent was\r\n  unable to contact her in order to make arrangements to deliver the file.Â  \r\nComplainant D provided her current contact\r\n  information when she filed a grievance complaining that she had not received\r\n  her file from respondent.Â  ODC gave respondent the contact information on\r\n  October 3, 2008.Â  At the time of respondent's interim suspension in October\r\n  2009, respondent still had not provided Complainant D with her client file.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to appear at ODC pursuant to subpoena in September 2009 for a\r\n  Rule 19(c), RLDE, interview.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nIn April 2007, Complainant E paid respondent $475.00\r\n  to handle a divorce matter.Â  Respondent failed to diligently pursue the\r\n  matter.Â  \r\nOn July 9, 2007, respondent wrote Complainant E and\r\n  informed her she was going to start teaching school.Â  In the letter, respondent\r\n  stated she would not be closing her law office and agreed to continue to handle\r\n  Complainant E's case, however, respondent closed her law office in October 2007\r\n  without informing Complainant E and took no further action on the case.\r\nComplainant E left numerous telephone messages\r\n  for respondent.Â  The messages were not returned.Â  Complainant E wrote\r\n  respondent and asked for a refund, but respondent did not respond or comply.Â  \r\nRespondent did\r\n  not respond to the Notice of Full investigation in this matter.Â  She did not\r\n  appear for the Rule 19(c), RLDE, interview in September 2009.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule\r\n  7(a)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct\r\n  of lawyers).Â  In addition, respondent admits she has violated the following\r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer\r\n  shall provide competent representation to client ); Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall\r\n  consult with client about objectives of representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall\r\n  act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule\r\n  1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter,\r\n  promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain matter to\r\n  extent reasonably necessary to permit client to make informed decisions\r\n  regarding the representation); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not charge unreasonable\r\n  fee); Rule 1.15(a) (lawyer shall safeguard client property); Rule 1.15(c)\r\n  (lawyer shall deposit into client trust account unearned legal fees and expenses\r\n  paid in advance, to be withdrawn by lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses\r\n  incurred); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall take\r\n  steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect clientâ€™s interests,\r\n  including reasonable notice to client, refunding of unearned advance payment\r\n  fee, and surrendering property to which client is entitled); Rule 8.1(a)\r\n  (lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact in\r\n  connection with a disciplinary matter); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly\r\n  fail to respond to lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority); and \r\nRule 8.4(a) (it is professional\r\n    misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and impose a definite suspension of two years, subject to the following\r\n  condition:Â Â  within ninety days of this opinion, respondent shall pay\r\n  restitution as follows: Â $1,100.00 to Mr. and Mrs. Doe, $700.00 to Complainant\r\n  C's mother, and $475.00 to Complainant E; if the Lawyers Fund for Client\r\n  Protection (the Fund) paid or pays any claims on respondent's behalf,\r\n  respondent shall reimburse the Fund within thirty days of payment.[2] Â Respondent's suspension shall be imposed retroactively to October 1, 2009, the\r\n  date of her interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Moody, supra.\r\nFurther, within thirty days of the date\r\n  of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs incurred in the investigation\r\n  and prosecution of this matter to the ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.Â \r\n  Finally, should she seek reinstatement, in addition to any other requirements\r\n  imposed by this Court upon reinstatement, respondent shall 1) enter into a\r\n  two-year monitoring contract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers[3] and 2) within one year of reinstatement, complete the South Carolina Bar Legal\r\n  Ethics and Practice Program Trust Account School and Ethics School.Â  Within\r\n  fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit\r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was placed on interim suspension on October\r\n  1, 2009.Â  In the Matter of Moody, 385 S.C. 239, 684 S.E.2d 175 (2009).Â  \r\n[2] If the Fund paid claims to the individuals listed herein, respondent shall not\r\n  be required to pay the individuals but to reimburse the Fund. \r\n[3] On a quarterly basis during the contract period, respondent shall be required\r\n  to file an affidavit with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct attesting to her\r\n  compliance with the terms of the contract. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26810","title":"In the Matter of Charleston County Magistrate

Standard of\r\n  Review applied under the Base Load Review ActÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nInitially, Appellant contends this Court should apply a new\r\n  standard of review to the analysis of the Commission below, because this is the\r\n  first combined application the Commission has decided under the Base Load\r\n  Review Act.[5]Â \r\n  Appellant maintains a new standard of &quot;heightened scrutiny&quot; is the\r\n  appropriate standard this Court should apply to decisions of the Commission\r\n  under the Base Load Review Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nOrdinarily, the Court's application of varying degrees of scrutiny\r\n  is limited to those cases where a statute's constitutionality is being\r\n  challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.Â  See U.S.\r\n  Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.Â  The application of\r\n  heightened, or strict scrutiny is warranted in cases where &quot;a\r\n  classification trammels fundamental personal rights or is drawn upon inherently\r\n  suspect distinctions such as race, religion, or alienage . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  Fraternal Order of Police v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 352 S.C.\r\n  420, 431, 574 S.E.2d 717, 722 (2002) (quoting City of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303 (1976)).Â  Appellant cites no authority for the proposition\r\n  that application of this level of scrutiny is necessary to review the utility\r\n  regulation decisions of the Commission, and moreover fails to identify a\r\n  fundamental right that has been abridged.Â  At the core of Appellant's argument\r\n  is its assertion that the Base Load Review Act so fundamentally changes the\r\n  landscape of Commission review of a company's proposal, a heightened level of\r\n  scrutiny is necessary on the front end of the review process.Â  We find\r\n  Appellant's claim unsubstantiated and against the plain reading of the Base\r\n  Load Review Act.Â  Section 58-33-240(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009)\r\n  specifically provides that &quot;[e]xcept as otherwise specified in this\r\n  article, all procedural requirements that apply to general rate proceedings by\r\n  law or regulation shall apply to proceedings and combined proceedings, to\r\n  revised rates proceedings, and to the judicial review of orders issued under\r\n    this article.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  As a result, we find no basis for\r\n  the application of a heightened level of scrutiny to appeals under the Act.\r\nConsequently, &quot;[t]his Court employs a deferential standard of\r\n  review when reviewing a decision of the Public Service Commission and will\r\n  affirm that decision when substantial evidence supports it.&quot;Â  Duke\r\n    Power Co. v. Public Service Comm'n of South Carolina, 343 S.C. 554, 558,\r\n  541 S.E.2dÂ  250, 252 (2001) (citing Porter v. South Carolina Public Service\r\n    Comm'n, 333 S.C. 12, 507 S.E.2d 328 (1998)).Â  In applying a substantial\r\n  evidence test, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for the\r\n  judgment of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact,\r\n  unless its findings or conclusions are clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n  reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. Â Lark v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla; rather, it is\r\n  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds\r\n  to reach the same conclusion as the agency.Â  Lark at 135-36, 276 S.E.2d\r\n  at 306-07.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the Court may not substitute its judgment for the\r\n  Commission's on questions about which there is room for a difference of\r\n  intelligent opinion.Â  Duke Power Co., 343 S.C. at 558, 541 S.E.2d at\r\n  252. Â Because the Commission's findings are presumptively correct, the party\r\n  challenging a Commission order bears the burden of convincingly proving the\r\n  decision is clearly erroneous, or arbitrary or capricious, or an abuse of\r\n  discretion, in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nII.Â  Alleged\r\n  Failings of the SCE&amp;G Application \r\nAppellant\r\n  next contends SCE&amp;G failed to update its integrated resource plan (IRP) or\r\n  complete a review of potential energy efficiency and demand side management\r\n  (DSM) load reductions, thus SCE&amp;G has failed to adequately demonstrate the\r\n  need for the proposed capacity expansion of the Facility.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Commission's order references SCE&amp;G's then-forthcoming DSM\r\n  reports, as well as the company's requirement under section 58-37-20 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) to file an IRP.Â  Based on the evidence and\r\n  testimony included in SCE&amp;G's combined application, both in favor and\r\n  against, the Commission determined SCE&amp;G had adequately accounted for and\r\n  addressed these concerns in its forecasts.Â  The consensus reached by the\r\n  Commission was that SCE&amp;G had demonstrated a need to build the Facility,\r\n  irrespective of the concerns.Â  \r\nDSM programs are designed to reduce the overall energy consumption\r\n  of customers.Â  There are two general types of DSM programs:Â  first, demand\r\n  reduction programs that involve motivating customers to shift their use of\r\n  power away from peak energy usage periods, thus limiting or reducing the growth\r\n  of energy consumption during a utility's peak demand; and second, energy\r\n  efficient programs which seek to reduce customers' overall energy consumption\r\n  through customer information and energy conservation programs designed to\r\n  educate the energy-consuming public.Â  With respect to SCE&amp;G's DSM reports,\r\n  the Commission noted that SCE&amp;G, at the time of the order, was exploring\r\n  the revitalization of its programs in light of the current energy prices,\r\n  general economic conditions, and the increased environmental concerns of its\r\n  customers.Â  In addition, the Commission acknowledged that SCE&amp;G could have\r\n  made a better effort at establishing its energy efficiency programs in the\r\n  past, and stated its anticipation at reviewing the company's new DSM programs\r\n  in June of 2009.Â  Nonetheless, viewing the entirety of the evidence before it,\r\n  the Commission determined that DSM programs were not a viable substitute for\r\n  the base load capacity for which SCE&amp;G had established a need, and sought\r\n  to fulfill in the construction of the Facility.Â  \r\nAppellant also contends SCE&amp;G's most recent IRP update, which was\r\n  completed in May of 2008, was not done close enough in time to the Application,\r\n  and failed to give an accurate portrayal of the need SCE&amp;G was facing.Â \r\n  According to the Commission:\r\n\r\n\tThe objective of the IRP process is the development of a plan that\r\n  results in the minimization of the long run total costs of the utility's\r\n  overall system and produces the least cost to the consumer consistent with the\r\n  availability of an adequate and reliable supply of electricity while\r\n  maintaining system flexibility and considering environmental impacts. In conjunction with the overall objective, the IRP should contribute toward\r\n  the outcomes of improved customer service, additional customer options, and\r\n  improved efficiencies of energy utilization.\r\n\r\nOrder No.\r\n  1991-885, August 28, 1991.Â  Under section 58-37-40(A) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2009), electrical utilities are required to file a detailed,\r\n  fifteen year IRP with the State Energy Office, every three years, with updates\r\n  made annually.\r\nAppellant maintains that, because SCE&amp;G did not conduct a\r\n  separate IRP specifically for this combined application -- and based on its\r\n  typical IRP schedule, SCE&amp;G's last IRP filing was in May of 2008 -- the\r\n  data and forecasts that were a part of their most recent IRP were unreliable.Â \r\n  As part and parcel to this argument, Appellant contends SCE&amp;G failed to\r\n  consider alternatives to nuclear power, such as solar, wind, landfill gas,\r\n  biomass, natural gas, and coal.Â  However, this argument is contradicted by the\r\n  direct testimony of SCE&amp;G's experts and employees, wherein they stated\r\n  SCE&amp;G considered each of the seven types of energy generation facilities\r\n  listed above. \r\nFinally, Appellant argues the Commission should have deferred its\r\n  decision on SCE&amp;G's combined application, or in the alternative, should\r\n  have prospectively limited the company's ability to make adjustments in the\r\n  approved schedule or budget for completion of the Facility.Â  This argument is\r\n  made, in principal part, due to the Application's alleged inadequacies\r\n  regarding SCE&amp;G's IRP and DSM plans.Â  However, under the plain reading of\r\n  the Base Load Review Act, neither of these requests are contemplated or\r\n  authorized; therefore, Appellant's contentions are without merit.Â  The General\r\n  Assembly specifically provided that the Commission must rule and issue an\r\n  order, either approving or disapproving, a request made by a utility, including\r\n  requests made in an application under the Base Load Review Act, within nine\r\n  months of the filing of the combined application.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-33-240(E)\r\n  (Supp. 2009) (modifying, for the purposes of the Base Load Review Act, the\r\n  Commission's traditional requirement that all orders be filed within six\r\n  months).Â  This provision grants the Commission no discretion to delay the\r\n  issuance of its order.Â  Furthermore, section 58-33-270(E) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2009) provides that once a final order by the Commission has been\r\n  issued, a &quot;utility may petition the commission . . . for an order modifying\r\n  any of the schedules, estimates, findings, class allocation factors, rate\r\n  designs, or conditions that form part of any base load review order issued\r\n  under this section.&quot;Â  Clearly the General Assembly did not contemplate the\r\n  Commission's ability to prevent subsequent modification of its orders under the\r\n  Base Load Review Act, as subsection (E) expressly provides the utility that\r\n  right.\r\nAs explained above, based on the overwhelming amount of evidence\r\n  in the record, the Commission's determination that SCE&amp;G considered all\r\n  forms of viable energy generation, and concluded that nuclear energy was the least\r\n  costly alternative source, is supported by substantial evidence.\r\nIII.Â  Failure\r\n  of SCE&amp;G to prove a need for the Facility\r\nAppellant\r\n  finally contends the Commission erred in finding SCE&amp;G had established the\r\n  proper need and prudency of building the Facility, given: Â SCE&amp;G's size\r\n  relative to other utility companies; the steep economic downturn the country\r\n  and South Carolina is facing; and the fact that SCE&amp;G will be the first\r\n  utility to build this type of facility.Â  Because the record demonstrates the\r\n  Commission adequately considered each of the requirements under the Base Load\r\n  Review Act, and its determinations are supported by substantial evidence in the\r\n  record, we disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  58-33-240(D) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) provides that in\r\n  proceedings before the Commission, upon the filing of a combined application,\r\n  &quot;the utility shall have the burden of proving that the decision to build\r\n  the plant was prudent, and shall have the burden of proof as to all matters on\r\n  which the commission is required to enter findings under Section 58-33-270(A),\r\n  (B), (C), (D), and (E).&quot;Â  Furthermore, under the new requirements of the\r\n  Base Load Review Act, the Commission is obligated to go beyond the findings\r\n  required under the Siting Act to conduct a full pre-construction prudency\r\n  review of the Facility and the Engineering, Procurement and Construction\r\n  Contract under which it will be built, including setting out the construction\r\n  and annual capital cost schedules establishing the prudency and reasonableness\r\n  of the Facility's costs.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-33-270 (Supp. 2009).Â  Section\r\n  58-33-270 requires the Commission to hold a hearing, and thereafter, if the\r\n  application is approved, issue an order setting out the following findings:\r\n\r\n\t(1) that the utility's decision to proceed with construction of\r\n  the plant is prudent and reasonable considering the information available to\r\n  the utility at the time; \r\n\t(2) for plants located in this State, that\r\n  the utility has satisfied the requirements of Section 58-33-160 of the Utility\r\n  Facility Siting and Environmental Protection Act, either in a past proceeding\r\n  or in the current proceeding if the current proceeding is a combined proceeding;\r\n  and \r\n\t(3) for plants located outside South\r\n  Carolina, that the utility has satisfied the requirements of Section 58-33-160(1)(a),\r\n  58-33-160(1)(d), and 58-33-160(1)(f) of the Utility Facility Siting and\r\n  Environmental Protection Act. \r\n\t(B) The base load review order shall\r\n  establish:\r\n\t(1) the anticipated construction schedule\r\n  for the plant including contingencies; \r\n\t(2) the anticipated components of capital\r\n  costs and the anticipated schedule for incurring them, including specified\r\n  contingencies; \r\n\t(3) the return on equity established in\r\n  conformity with Section 58-33-220(16); \r\n\t(4) the choice of the specific type of\r\n  unit or units and major components of the plant; \r\n\t(5) the qualification and selection of\r\n  principal contractors and suppliers for construction of the plant; and \r\n\t(6) the inflation indices used by the\r\n  utility for costs of plant construction, covering major cost components or\r\n  groups of related cost components. Each utility shall provide its own indices,\r\n  including: the source of the data for each index, if the source is external to\r\n  the company, or the methodology for each index which is compiled from internal\r\n  utility data, the method of computation of inflation from each index, a\r\n  calculated overall weighted index for capital costs, and a five-year history of\r\n  each index on an annual basis. \r\n\t(C) If revised rates are requested, the\r\n  base load review order shall specify initial revised rates reflecting the\r\n  utility's current investment in the plant which must be determined using the\r\n  standards set forth in Section 58-33-280(B) and implemented according to\r\n  Section 58-33-280(D).\r\n\t(D) The base load review order shall\r\n  establish the rate design and class allocation factors to be used in\r\n  calculating revised rates related to the plant. In establishing revised rates,\r\n  all factors, allocations, and rate designs shall be as determined in the\r\n  utility's last rate order or as otherwise previously established by the\r\n  commission, except that the additional revenue requirement to be collected\r\n  through revised rates shall be allocated among customer classes based on the\r\n  utility's South Carolina firm peak demand data from the prior year.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the decision of the Commission under a statute for which it is\r\n  charged with the administration, the Commission is &quot;the 'expert' designated\r\n  by the legislature to make policy determinations regarding utility rates; thus,\r\n  the role of a court reviewing such decisions is very limited.&quot; Hamm v.\r\n    South Carolina Public Service Comm'n, 289 S.C. 22, 25, 344 S.E.2d 600, 601\r\n  (1986) (quoting Patton v. South Carolina Public Service Comm'n, 280 S.C.\r\n  288, 291, 312 S.E.2d 257, 259 (1984)).Â  &quot;[The Court has] traditionally\r\n  given the [Commission], just as any other agency, respectful consideration in\r\n  their interpretation of a statute.Â  Where an agency is charged with the\r\n  execution of a statute, the agency's interpretation should not be overruled\r\n  without cogent reason.&quot;Â  Nucor Steel, a Div. of Nucor Corp. v. South\r\n    Carolina Public Service Comm'n, 310 S.C. 539, 543, 426 S.E.2d 319, 321\r\n  (1992).\r\nWithout addressing all of the considerations SCE&amp;G advanced to\r\n  establish its need for the Facility in the Application, the record is replete\r\n  with evidence from which the Commission could come to the conclusion that SCE&amp;G's\r\n  need was satisfactorily established.Â  The crux of Appellant's argument is that\r\n  SCE&amp;G is too small of a utility to be the guinea pig for these types of\r\n  nuclear facilities, and that given the cost of capital estimates associated\r\n  with projects of this magnitude, coupled with the downturn in the economy, the\r\n  costs for this risky facility would ultimately be passed on to the SCE&amp;G\r\n  customers.Â  While this is a valid and noteworthy point, the Commission\r\n  addressed each and every concern Appellant presented, over and above the\r\n  findings it was required to make under section 58-33-270.Â  At the end of the\r\n  day, the Commission, in a very thorough and reasoned order, determined\r\n  SCE&amp;G has appropriately established a need for the Facility, and thereafter\r\n  approved SCE&amp;G's proposed rate increases as reasonable costs to be passed on\r\n  to the customers for the construction of the Facility.Â  Without a doubt, these\r\n  determinations are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nOn balance, Appellant essentially asks this Court to substitute\r\n  its judgment for that of the Commission, in an area in which the Commission is\r\n  recognized as the expert.Â  Although Appellant's concerns are deserving of\r\n  evaluation, SCE&amp;G's Application, as well as the Commission's thorough and\r\n  well-reasoned order, reveal these considerations were adequately considered in\r\n  the determination to approve the Application.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the\r\n  Commission is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.\r\n  Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

(Supp. 2009).\r\n[3] In addition to\r\n  Appellant, the Commission also received timely petitions to intervene from CMC\r\n  Steel South Carolina, Pamela Greenlaw, Mildred A. McKinley, Lawrence P. Newton,\r\n  the South Carolina Energy User Committee, Ruth Thomas, Maxine Warshauer, Samuel\r\n  Baker, and Joseph Wojcicki.Â  Although petitions for rehearing from the order on\r\n  appeal were filed by the South Carolina Energy User Committee and Wojcicki, in\r\n  addition to that filed by Appellant, none of the above-listed intervenors are a\r\n  part of the appeal before us. \r\n[4] South Carolina\r\n  Department of Health and Environmental Control, South Carolina Department of\r\n  Natural Resources, South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism,\r\n  and the Town of Jenkinsville were all listed as parties based on the provisions\r\n  of section 58-33-140 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009), but did not\r\n  appear or take part in the proceedings.Â  \r\n[5] The General\r\n  Assembly enacted the Base Load Review Act in 2007, by Act No. 16 , effective\r\n  upon signature of the Governor on May 3, 2007.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
