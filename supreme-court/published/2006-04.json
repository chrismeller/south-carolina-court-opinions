Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Charles N. Pearman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nJustin Oâ€™Toole Lucey, Mount Pleasant, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension of ninety (90) days.Â  We accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for a ninety (90) day period.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent served as a title insurance agent for a title insurance company.Â  During a routine audit, the title insurance company determined there were unpaid premiums due from respondent for the title insurance companyâ€™s share of premiums for title insurance issued by respondent.[1]  \r\nThe amount claimed due from respondent by the title insurance company after the audit was approximately $12,000.Â  The title insurance company requested payment of that amount from respondent, but respondent advised the title insurance company he did not have adequate funds to make payment at that time, but would do so in the future on a periodic basis under a plan agreed to by the title insurance company and respondent.Â  Respondent represents that, unbeknownst to him, the premiums had been placed in his firmâ€™s operating account and then disbursed by his now deceased non-lawyer assistant.Â Â  Â  \r\nApproximately one year later, the title insurance company conducted another audit of respondentâ€™s operations.Â  As a result, the title insurance company determined there was an additional sum of approximately $12,524 due from respondent for premiums which had been collected but for which policies had not been issued.Â  These un-issued policies were in connection with real estate closings which, in some cases, had taken place several months prior to the second audit.Â  \r\nAfter the second audit, the title insurance company terminated its agency agreement with respondent and took possession of its title insurance policies and files related to policies where commitments/binders had been issued and closings conducted, but final policies had not been issued by respondent.[2]Â  The title insurance company did the work necessary to complete the closings and issued final policies for those files in accordance with the commitments/binders previously issued by respondent as its agent.Â  \r\nAfter it became dissatisfied with respondentâ€™s progress in paying the past-due premiums, the title insurance company reported the foregoing to ODC.[3]Â  ODC then made inquiries and determined that the amounts collected by respondent for title insurance premiums had been deposited into respondentâ€™s escrow account and then transferred into his operating account.Â  Thereafter, portions of these funds were expended out of the operating account for the cost of operation of respondentâ€™s firm, for respondentâ€™s benefit, or for other purposes than intended.Â Â  \r\nRespondent now recognizes that, in addition to being contrary to the provision of Rule 1.15, Rule 407, SCACR, his handling of the insurance premiums was contrary to the provisions of the agency agreement between respondent and the title insurance company.Â  The agency agreement provided that funds collected for title insurance premiums would be maintained by respondent in an account separate from respondentâ€™s own funds or those of his law firm. \r\nRespondent represents, however, that the title insurance company was aware of his method in handling the insurance premiums and did not object.Â  To the best of ODCâ€™s knowledge, this was, in fact, true.Â  Moreover, the agency agreement did not specifically address how often or under what circumstances the title insurance companyâ€™s portion of premiums would be transmitted by respondent to the title company.Â  Nevertheless, respondent recognizes the funds should have been maintained in a separate account.Â  Should he ever collect premiums for title insurance companies in the future, respondent agrees to place insurance premiums in a separate account.Â  Respondent admits he did not personally reconcile his escrow account in strict compliance with the provisions of Rule 417,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp; \r\nBy way of mitigation and not as a defense, respondent represents the following:Â  that he had a very capable, experienced paralegal who worked extensively on loan closings and related title insurance matters and who was his principal point of contact with the title insurance company; that the arrangement for the handling of title insurance policies and title insurance premiums was handled by the paralegal; that the title insurance company had previously audited respondentâ€™s firm, escrow account, and the title insurance operations, was aware of the paralegalâ€™s role, and was apparently satisfied with respondentâ€™s performance as an agent until past due premiums came to light; that even after the title insurance company determined there were amounts due for policies previously issued, it continued its agency agreement with respondent for quite some time thereafter until it became dissatisfied with respondentâ€™s progress in repaying the premiums it felt it was due; that the paralegal died as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident and another key non-lawyer employee left respondentâ€™s firm, causing respondent to fall behind in completion of closings (which included failing to issue final title insurance policies and transmitting premiums to the title insurance company).Â  According to respondent, immediately prior to the final audit, an employee of the title insurance company advised respondent that his books and records were in excellent shape.[4]Â  Â Â \r\nRespondent now recognizes that he should have more closely supervised his non-lawyer staff, especially in connection with the handling of premiums collected for title insurance policies; that the premiums should have been maintained in his escrow account or in some other account separate from his operating account and should not have been expended except for their intended purpose; that respondent should have strictly complied with the recordkeeping and money handling requirements of Rule 417, SCACR; that he should have maintained better records as to what amounts were due the title insurance company including, but not limited to respective policy numbers, file numbers, and premium amounts due for each policy; that he should have been more prompt in making payment to the title insurance company of its share of premiums collected; that he should have reduced his intake of new real estate files until he was able to catch up on the backlog of completed closings and issuance of title insurance policies after the loss of his two key non-lawyer employees; that, due to the foregoing, respondent was not as diligent as he should have been in handling real estate matters for his clients which, in turn, caused the quality of services provided those clients not to have been as competent as they should have been.Â  \r\nTo date, in spite of considerable expenditures of time and effort, ODC has been unable to reconcile to its satisfaction the exact amounts due the title insurance company and must, instead, rely on the agreement between the title insurance company and respondent as to the amounts due.Â  Complicating ODCâ€™s investigation is the fact that the title insurance company applied premiums for subsequent policies issued by respondent to past due premiums.Â  As a result, the title insurance companyâ€™s records show as paid amounts it later claimed were unpaid and show as unpaid amounts that cancelled checks from respondent demonstrate have been paid.\r\nRespondent represents he no longer handles real estate closings and, at this time, does not plan to do so in the future.Â  However, should he become involved with real estate closings in the future, respondent warrants he will maintain funds for title insurance either in his escrow account or in an account separate from his own money, keep detailed records as to what funds are due for each policy, and promptly remit the premiums to the insuring title insurance company, together with information specifying which portions of the amount submitted should be applied to each policy issued.Â  The Court specifically adopts these restrictions.Â  Accordingly, if respondent handles real estate closings in the future, he shall comply with each of the restrictions set forth in the Agreement.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to his client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of third persons in his possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 5.3 (partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that a non-lawyer assistantâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer);\r\nRule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â \r\nIn addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to bring the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  Finally, respondent admits that his misconduct constitutes a violation of the financial recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for ninety (90) days.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of the suspension, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\nRespondent shall pay all title premiums due the title insurance company as a result of the misconduct reported herein and shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of ODC, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, and the Court that he has paid all title premiums due the title insurance company before he shall be permitted to resume the practice of law in this state.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. WALLER, J., not participating. \r\n\r\n[1] Under the terms of the agency agreement between respondent and the title insurance company, respondent typically received sixty percent of the premiums and the title insurance company received forty percent of the premiums.Â  Â \r\n[2] During this period of time, respondentâ€™s non-lawyer assistant who handled his title insurance work and was the principal point of contact between respondentâ€™s firm and the title insurance company died in an accident and another non-lawyer assistant left respondentâ€™s employ.Â  The loss of these two employees caused the title insurance company to become concerned about whether respondent had sufficient staff, especially in view of the backlog of non-issued final policies created after the loss of the two employees.Â  According to the Agreement, the title insurance company terminated its agency agreement with respondent primarily because of the staffing shortage at respondentâ€™s firm.Â Â  Â Â Â \r\n[3] The title insurance companyâ€™s report to ODC occurred quite some time after it conducted the two audits.Â  \r\n[4] ODC disagrees with the opinion of the title insurance company employee and respondent now recognizes that, in regard to title insurance premiums, there were irregularities in his recordkeeping and money handling procedures notwithstanding the apparent lack of disapproval by the title insurance company.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26132 ","title":"SC State Ports Authority v.

Â The South Carolina State Ports Authority (SCSPA) seeks a declaratory judgment determining whether it has the exclusive authority to develop a port or terminal on the Savannah River.Â  The SCSPA further seeks determination of whether it has a superior right over Jasper County (County) to condemn land on the Savannah River for port or terminal development, and thus a superior right to port or terminal development.Â  The SCSPA does not have the exclusive authority to develop a port or terminal on the Savannah River.Â  Further, County has the power and authority, which is consistent with the Constitution and general law of this State, to develop a county-owned public marine terminal. Â However, we find the SCSPAâ€™s eminent domain power is superior to Countyâ€™s power. \r\nÂ FACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nAfter several years of rejecting the idea of building a public\r\nmarine terminal in County, the SCSPA informed County in early 2004 of its interest in 1,776 acres of land located along the Savannah River (Proposed Site) and that it intended to conduct studies and evaluations of the land as a necessary precursor to condemning the land for the purpose of a port.[1]Â  In October 2004, Jasper County Council (Council) voted to establish its own ports authority as part of a plan to acquire the Proposed Site. \r\nOn January 7, 2005, Council adopted Resolution #05-01, which\r\nauthorized County to enter into development and management agreements with South Atlantic International Terminal, LLC (SAIT), a private company. Â Under Resolution #05-01, County would own the land and the public marine terminal.[2]Â  SAIT would assist County in developing and managing Countyâ€™s terminal, and SAIT would serve as Port Developer/Manager for County.Â  On the same day, County had a first reading of County Ordinance #05-02 which allowed County to enter into a loan agreement with SAIT for preliminary financing of a public marine terminal.Â  Also on January 7, 2005, County offered to purchase the Proposed Site from the landowner, Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT).Â  County notified GDOT that it would commence condemnation proceedings if negotiations to purchase the land failed, and on January 19, 2005, County filed a Notice of Condemnation against GDOT.[3]  \r\nOn January 18, 2005, the SCSPAâ€™s board of directors unanimously approved a resolution to undertake efforts to acquire the Proposed Site, including commencing a condemnation action.Â  The board also approved the step of commencing this lawsuit.Â  On the same day, the SCSPA requested permission, as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-70 (1991), from GDOT to enter the Proposed Site in anticipation of condemning the land.Â  The SCSPA commenced this action in the Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction on January 19, 2005, seeking declaratory judgments and injunctive relief.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Does the SCSPAâ€™s Enabling Act preempt County from developing a county-owned public marine terminal on the Savannah River?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         If County is not preempted, does County have the power and authority to create a county-owned public marine terminal?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.\r\n         If County has the power and authority to create a county-owned public marine terminal, is that power consistent with the Constitution or the general law of the\r\n          Stat\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDetermining whether a local ordinance is valid is essentially a\r\ntwo-step process. Bugsyâ€™s, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 87, 93, 530 S.E.2d 890, 893 (2000). The first step is to ascertain whether the county had the power to enact the ordinance.Â  If the state has preempted a particular area of legislation, then the ordinance is invalid.Â  If no such power existed, the ordinance is invalid and the inquiry ends.Â  However, if the county had the power to enact the ordinance, then the Court ascertains whether the ordinance is inconsistent with the Constitution or general law of this state.Â  Id.Â  See also Hospitality Assâ€™n of South Carolina, Inc. v. County of Charleston, 320 S.C. 219, 224, 464 S.E.2d 113, 117 (1995). \r\nI. Preemption\r\nThe SCSPA argues the General Assembly has preempted the field of developing and constructing harbors and seaports, including terminals, on the Savannah River, through its Enabling Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 54-3-110 through -1050 (1992 &amp; Supp. 2004). We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTo preempt an entire field, an act must make manifest a legislative intent that no other enactment may touch upon the subject in any way.Â  Town of Hilton Head Island v. Fine Liquors, Ltd., 302 S.C. 550, 552, 397 S.E.2d 662, 663 (1990).[4]Â  We have not expressly followed the same preemption analysis in deciding whether a state law preempts a local law as we have applied in deciding whether a federal law preempts a state law or regulation.Â  Compare Fine Liquors, Ltd., 302 S.C. at 552-53, 397 S.E.2d at 663 with State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 186, 525 S.E.2d 872, 877 (2000) (federal law may preempt a state law as follows: (1) Congress may explicitly define the extent to which it intends to preempt state law, (2) Congress may indicate an intent to occupy an entire field of regulation, or (3) federal law may preempt state law to the extent the state law actually conflicts with the federal law, such that compliance with both is impossible or the state law hinders the accomplishment of the federal lawâ€™s purpose); accord Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers Assâ€™n v. Agricultural Marketing &amp; Bargaining, 467 U.S. 461, 469, 104 S.Ct. 2518, 2523, 81 L.Ed.2d 399 (1984).Â  We find it appropriate to address the SCSPAâ€™s preemption arguments using the three categories previously recognized when discussing federal law preemption, any of which is a method by which the General Assemblyâ€™s intent may be made manifest.[5]Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe following provisions of the SCSPAâ€™s Enabling Act are at issue:\r\n\r\nThrough the [SCSPA], the State may engage in promoting, developing, constructing, equipping, maintaining, and\r\noperating the harbors or seaports within the State.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 54-3-110. \r\nThe [SCSPA] is created as an instrumentality of the State for\r\nthe accomplishment of the following general purposes:. . .(8)To promote, develop, construct, equip, maintain and operate a harbor or harbors within this State on the Savannah River, and in furtherance thereof have all of the powers, purposes and authority given by law to the [SCSPA] in reference to the harbors and seaports of Charleston, Georgetown and Port Royal [see Â§ 54-3-410]; and (9) In general to do and perform any act or function which may tend to or be useful toward the development and improvement of such harbors and seaports of this State and to the increase of water-borne commerce, foreign and domestic, through such harbors and seaports. Id. Â§ 54-3-130. \r\n[F]or the acquiring of property necessary for the development of a harbor or harbors within this State on the Savannah River, the [SCSPA] may purchase them by negotiation or may condemn them. The power of eminent domain shall apply not only to all property of private persons or corporations but also as to property\r\nalready devoted to public use. Id. Â§ 54-3-150. \r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Express Preemption\r\nExpress preemption occurs when the General Assembly declares in express terms its intention to preclude local action in a given area.Â  See e.g. Wrenn Bail Bond Service, Inc., 335 S.C. at 28, 515 S.E.2d at 522. Â See also Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers Assâ€™n., 467 U.S. at 469; 56 Am.Jur.2d Municipal Corporations Â§392 (2000); 5 McQuillin Municipal Corporations Â§15.18 (rev. 3d ed 2004).Â  The General Assembly has not expressly preempted the field of developing harbors, ports, and terminals on the Savannah River.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Implied Field Preemption\r\nUnder implied preemption, an ordinance is preempted when\r\nthe state statutory scheme so thoroughly and pervasively covers the subject so as to occupy the field or when the subject mandates statewide uniformity. Â See Denene, Inc., 352 S.C. at 213, 574 S.E.2d at 199 (â€œ[i]t would have been unnecessary for the legislature to refer to municipalitiesâ€™ authority to regulate the hours of operation of retail sales of beer and wine if the General Assembly intended to occupy the entire fieldâ€); McAbee v. Southern Ry. Co., 166 S.C. 166, 166, 164 S.E. 444, 445 (1932) (â€œthe question [of] whether a conflict exists [between a statute and an ordinance] depends upon whether the state has occupied the whole field of prohibitory legislation with respect to the subject. If such is the case it is held that a conflict exists.â€). Â See also Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers Assâ€™n, 467 U.S. at 469; 56 Am.Jur.2d Municipal Corporations Â§Â§ 329, 392; 5 McQuillin Municipal Corporations Â§ 15.18.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe SCSPA contends that the specific provisions in S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 54-3-130 and -150 manifest a legislative intent to occupy the field.Â  The SCSPA, relying on Barnhill, 333 S.C. at 486-87, 511 S.E.2d at 363-64, asserts that the statutory purpose of acquiring property and developing ports within the State on the Savannah River makes manifest a legislative intent that no other enactment may touch upon that subject.Â  In Barnhill, the applicable statute provided that â€œthe provisions of this chapter. . . shall govern the operating [sic], equipment, numbering and all other matters relating thereto whenever any vessel shall be operated on the waters of this State. . . .â€ Id. at 487 n.2, 511 S.E.2d at 363 n.2 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-21-30) (emphasis in original).Â  The SCSPAâ€™s reliance on Barnhill is misplaced.Â  The applicable statute in that case manifested a clear legislative intent that state lawâ€”not local lawâ€”regulate watercraft on navigable waters.Â  Unlike the statutory provisions in Barnhill, the SCSPAâ€™s Enabling Act does not manifest a clear legislative intent that state law control all aspects of port and terminal development.\r\nIn construing statutory language, the statute must be read as a\r\nwhole and sections which are a part of the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one given effect.Â  TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Dept. of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998).Â  A statute should not be construed by concentrating on an isolated phrase. Laurens County School Districts 55 and 56 v. Cox, 308 S.C. 171, 417 S.E.2d 560 (1992).\r\nIn construing S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 54-3-110, -130 and -150 in their entirety, we discern no language prohibiting entities other than the SCSPA from developing a terminal on the Savannah River; nor is there a manifest intent that the SCSPA be the only developer of ports and terminals on the Savannah River.Â  Section 54-3-150 enables the SCSPA to condemn property for port development but does not manifest an intent that other public entities are prohibited from condemning property for port or terminal development.Â  The consistent use of the permissive â€œmayâ€ in describing the SCSPAâ€™s powers and the absence of language referring to other enactments touching upon the subject indicate that the General Assembly did not intend to occupy the field. \r\nSeveral other factors demonstrate the General Assembly did not intend to occupy the field of port or terminal development.Â  For example, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 54-3-410 gives the SCSPA the authority to supervise terminals in Charleston.Â  Under Â§ 54-3-130(8), the SCSPA has this same general supervision over any port or terminal on the Savannah River.[6]Â  This general supervisory authority is a manifestation that the General Assembly contemplated the development of terminals by other entities.\r\nMoreover, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 54-5-10 through -110 (1992) allows cities with a population in excess of 50,000 and which are located on a navigable stream to develop port and terminal utilities.[7]Â  Also, municipalities, including counties, are authorized to construct terminals pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 6-21-5 through -570 (2004).Â  These provisions further reveal the absence of a legislative intent to place exclusive authority to develop a port or terminal in the SCSPA. \r\nThe presence of non-SCSPA-owned terminals in the state further\r\nindicates the field is not occupied.[8]Â  If the General Assembly had manifested an intent to preempt the field, then the SCSPA would be the sole developer of ports and terminals, and other entities, private and public alike, would be prohibited from such facilities.Â  \r\nThe SCSPA argues that its grant of jurisdiction to oversee harbors within the state is a manifestation of a legislative intent to preempt the field. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 54-3-120 (â€œThe jurisdiction of the Authority in any of said harbors or seaports within the State shall extend over the waters and shores of such harbors or seaportsâ€¦.â€).Â  This argument is unpersuasive because the statutory provision does not deal with port or terminal development within the State, but rather specifies the extent of the SCSPAâ€™s authority.Â  \r\nThe SCSPA also argues that the field of port and terminal development is occupied because the management of South Carolinaâ€™s ports requires statewide uniformity of purpose and application.Â  In our opinion, the SCSPAâ€™s supervisory power set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 54-3-410 indicates that uniformity is not required, but that the SCSPA has general supervisory powers over owners of terminals, including any terminal owned by County.Â  In Bugsyâ€™s, Inc., we noted that â€œwhile the General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive scheme regulating many aspects of video poker machines, the scheme does not manifest an intent to prohibit any other enactment from touching on video poker machines.â€Â  340 S.C. at 94, 530 S.E.2d at 893.Â  Similarly, we find the SCSPAâ€™s Enabling Act to be a comprehensive scheme regulating many aspects of port and terminal development, ownership, and maintenance in this state, but the scheme does not evidence an intent to prohibit other entities, public or private, from developing a marine terminal on the Savannah River.Â  Â Â \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Implied Conflict Preemption\r\nConflict preemption occurs when the ordinance hinders the accomplishment of the statuteâ€™s purpose or when the ordinance conflicts with the statute such that compliance with both is impossible.Â  See Peoples Program for Endangered Species v. Sexton, 323 S.C. 526, 530, 476 S.E.2d 477, 480 (1996) (â€œTo determine whether the ordinance has been preempted by Federal or State law, we must determine whether there is a conflict between the\r\nordinance and the statutes and whether the ordinance creates any obstacle to the fulfillment of Federal or State objectives.â€); 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. at 186, 525 S.E.2d at 877 (describing federal law conflict preemption); 56 Am.Jur.2d Municipal Corporations Â§ 392 (â€œ[i]mplied conflict preemption occurs when an ordinance prohibits an act permitted by a statute, or permits an act prohibited by a statuteâ€); 5 McQuillin Municipal Corporations Â§15.18.\r\nThe SCSPA contends that Countyâ€™s efforts to condemn the Proposed Site and develop a terminal on the site are in direct conflict with the specific provisions in the SCSPAâ€™s Enabling Act and serve to complicate and burden the SCSPA in accomplishing one of its express purposes.Â  Specifically, the SCSPA argues that Countyâ€™s efforts conflict with S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 54-3-130(8), -140(4),[9] and -150.Â  In our opinion, the General Assembly has not preempted the field.Â  The statutory provisions do not manifest an intent that other public entities are prohibited from developing ports and terminals or from exercising their eminent domain powers for such development.Â  Compliance with both is possible and Countyâ€™s efforts do not conflict with the SCSPAâ€™s Enabling Act.[10]Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Countyâ€™s Power and Authority\r\nThe SCSPA contends that County does not have the power and\r\nauthority to develop and operate a terminal on the Savannah River.Â  We disagree. \r\nCountyâ€™s Resolution provides: \r\n\r\n[T]here is hereby established a public marine terminal for\r\nand of Jasper County on the Terminal Property to be named\r\nthe South Atlantic International Terminal. . .[T]here is hereby appointed. . .South Atlantic International Terminal, LLC as\r\nPort Developer/Manager to provide assistance to the County in the form of turnkey development and management\r\nservices. . . .Â  \r\n\r\nCountyâ€™s Ordinance provides: â€œTo adopt a Loan Agreement between the County and South Atlantic International Terminal, LLC and to authorize the borrowing of money as provided therein.â€Â  The Resolution and Ordinance both find that: \r\n\r\na public marine terminal will serve the best interests of the citizens of Jasper County to (i) provide transportation\r\nfacilities, (ii) remedy a shortage of marine cargo loading, unloading, and transshipment capacity in Jasper County, the State of South Carolina and the Lowcountry region, (iii) foster development of commerce in Jasper County, (iv) meet Jasper Countyâ€™s unrealized potential as a regional transportation nexus, and (v) reduce local unemployment. \r\n\r\nArticle VIII of the South Carolina Constitution â€œmandates â€˜home\r\nruleâ€™ for local governmentsâ€ and requires â€œall laws concerning local government [to] be liberally construed in their favor.â€ S.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ 17; see also Quality Towing Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 29, 37, 530 S.E.2d 369, 373 (2000).Â  County contends that under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-25 (Supp. 2004),[11] its Resolution, Ordinance, and proposed terminal are valid because the terminal will promote the general welfare of the county and enhance the countyâ€™s economy.Â  Section 4-9-25, especially when read in conjunction with Article VIIIâ€™s mandatory liberal construction, authorizes County to pass a resolution and enact an ordinance promoting the general welfare of Countyâ€™s residents by building and maintaining a public marine terminal on the Savannah River.Â  See Hospitality Assâ€™n of South Carolina, 320 S.C. at 219, 464 S.E.2d at 113, (Â§ 5-7-30, analogous to Â§ 4-9-25, authorized the Town of Hilton Head to enact an ordinance promoting the health, safety, and welfare of its residents by raising funds to improve, maintain, and nourish the Townâ€™s beaches).Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Validity of Ordinance\r\nThe SCSPA argues that Countyâ€™s Resolution and Ordinance are\r\ninconsistent with the Constitution and general law of this state.Â  We disagree, but find the SCSPAâ€™s eminent domain power is superior to Countyâ€™s power. \r\nWhere an ordinance is not preempted by state law, the ordinance\r\nis valid if there is no conflict with State law.Â  Bugsyâ€™s Inc., 340 S.C. at 95, 530 S.E.2d at 894.Â  A conflict between a state statute and a county ordinance exists when â€œboth contain either express or implied conditions which are inconsistent with each other. . . . If either is silent where the other speaks, there can be no conflict between them.Â  Where no conflict exists, both laws stand.â€ Â Fine Liquors, 302 S.C. at 553, 397 S.E.2d at 664.Â \r\nFirst, the SCSPA contends that Countyâ€™s Resolution and Ordinance conflict with Article VIII, Â§ 14 of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Section 14 prohibits local governments from â€œset[ting] asideâ€¦the structure and the administration of any governmental service or function, responsibility for which rests with the State government or which requires statewide uniformity.â€Â  Countyâ€™s Ordinance and Resolution do not â€œset asideâ€ the structure or administration of developing ports or terminals because as previously explained, that function does not rest exclusively with the state government and does not require statewide uniformity.Â  Cf. Town of Hilton Head Island v. Coalition of Expressway Opponents, 307 S.C. 449, 456, 415 S.E.2d 801, 805 (1992) (an ordinance is defective under Article VIII, Â§ 14 because it attempted to limit the authority granted to the Department of Highways by state law). \r\nSecond, the SCSPA argues that Countyâ€™s Resolution and Ordinance are inconsistent with the S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 54-3-110 through -140.Â  We conclude the statutory provisions and the ordinance are consistent because the provisions are silent on the issue of\r\nwhether public entities may develop a terminal on the Savannah River.Â  We discern no conflict between these provisions and Countyâ€™s Resolution and Ordinance. \r\nThird, the SCSPA argues that Countyâ€™s Resolution and\r\nOrdinance are inconsistent with the general law of the state because the SCSPA claims to have a superior eminent domain power with regard to developing a port or terminal and thus a superior development power.Â  The SCSPA argues that Â§ 54-3-150 gives it a â€œsuperâ€ power of condemnation, so that even if County had the power to condemn the Proposed Site and develop a terminal, the SCSPA would have an overriding authority to condemn the previously condemned land and hence has a superior right to develop a port or terminal.Â  We conclude the statutory provision and the ordinance are consistent because the provision is silent on the issue of whether the SCSPA can prevent other entities from port or terminal development. \r\nYet, we address the issue of priority of eminent domain rights between the SCSPA and County because there are ripening seeds of a controversy.Â  See Sunset Cay v. City of Folly Beach, 357 S.C. 414, 593 S.E.2d 462 (2004).Â  Eminent domain is an attribute of sovereignty.Â  Because condemnation by a state agency is on behalf of the State, a state agencyâ€™s power of eminent domain is superior to that of a political subdivision.Â  Riley v. S.C. Hwy. Dept., 238 S.C. 19, 118 S.E.2d 809 (1961).Â  We conclude the SCSPAâ€™s right of condemnation regarding the Proposed Site is superior to Countyâ€™s condemnation right.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude County is not preempted from the field of port\r\nand terminal development on the Savannah River because the General Assembly has not manifested an intent that no other enactment touch upon the subject.Â  Further, County has the power and authority to create a county-owned public marine terminal on the Savannah River, and this power is consistent with the Constitution and general law of the State.Â  However, the SCSPAâ€™s right of condemnation is superior to Countyâ€™s right.Â  Finally, we find it unnecessary to address the SCSPAâ€™s request for injunctive relief. See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issues is dispositive).Â Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  Acting Justice John C. Few concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\nActing Justice Few:Â  I agree that Jasper County has the power to construct a marine shipping terminal on the Savannah River.Â  I also agree that under normal circumstances this action would not conflict with State law, and therefore would not be preempted.Â  Under the specific facts of this case, however, I believe that the Countyâ€™s ordinance is in conflict with the Ports Authorityâ€™s enabling legislation in two important respects.Â  First, the ordinance interferes with and hinders specific action being taken by the Ports Authority to acquire the Proposed Site.Â  Second, it creates problems of interstate relations with the State of Georgia, the current owner of the Proposed Site.Â  In these two ways, the County ordinance creates significant obstacles to the ability of the Ports Authority to fulfill the objectives set forth in the Ports Authorityâ€™s enabling legislation, and it hinders the accomplishment of the purpose of that legislation.Â  Therefore, the County ordinance is preempted.Â  See State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 186, 525 S.E.2d 872, 877 (2000).Â  To this extent, I respectfully dissent.Â  I would grant an injunction prohibiting the implementation of Jasper Countyâ€™s ordinance so long as the Ports Authority is actively pursuing efforts to condemn the Proposed Site and build a marine terminal there.\r\nThe County ordinance interferes with and hinders the Ports Authorityâ€™s efforts to acquire the Proposed Site.Â  The Ports Authority has unanimously adopted a resolution to undertake efforts to acquire, and if necessary condemn, the Proposed Site.Â  Pursuant to that resolution, the Ports Authority has exercised its responsibility to have the property appraised as required in South Carolina Code Â§ 28-2-70, and it has initiated this lawsuit.Â  Jasper County has also initiated efforts to condemn the Proposed Site, and has actually filed a condemnation action.Â  When two governmental entities attempt to condemn the same property, there is an obvious conflict between those efforts.Â  As the majority makes clear, the Ports Authorityâ€™s condemnation power is superior to that of Jasper County.Â  Therefore, the simple fact that Jasper County is trying to condemn the same property interferes with and hinders the efforts of the Ports Authority to acquire it.Â  \r\nIn addition, there are specific ways in which Jasper Countyâ€™s condemnation efforts conflict with the efforts of the Ports Authority.Â  For example, the Ports Authority has attempted to exercise its condemnation power by first initiating negotiations with the State of Georgia to purchase the Proposed Site.Â  The Ports Authority has said it wants to file a condemnation action only if the negotiations fail.Â  The existence of Jasper Countyâ€™s condemnation proceeding has very real potential to make these negotiation efforts impractical, if not impossible.Â  In the face of this competing action by Jasper County, the Ports Authority will have to change its approach, and initiate its own condemnation action as a first resort, instead of as a last resort.Â  Therefore, the County ordinance authorizing the Jasper County condemnation is interfering with the Ports Authorityâ€™s ability to accomplish its goal in the manner it chooses.Â  This interference is a significant obstacle to the fulfillment of the objectives of Ports Authorityâ€™s enabling act.\r\nThe Countyâ€™s ordinance also poses potential problems of interstate relations because the ordinance seeks to condemn property owned by the State of Georgia.Â  The issue regarding these problems is not whether there really is a potential problem.Â  Rather, the issue is whether the Ports Authority, as the arm of State government with irrefutable authority to handle interstate relations regarding the harbor and lower end of the River,[12] reasonably believes there is a potential problem.Â  It is not for this Court, and it is certainly not for Jasper County, to say that the Ports Authority is incorrect in its assessment as to what the issues and potential problems are in this Stateâ€™s relations with Georgia on the subject of a port on the Savannah River.Â  Interstate relations are, at least in this instance, an executive branch issue.Â  In any instance, interstate relations should be handled on the State level; Counties should play no role in affecting relations between the States.Â  The Ports Authorityâ€™s determination that Jasper Countyâ€™s ordinance interferes with interstate relations regarding the Savannah River requires a finding that the ordinance is an obstacle to accomplishing the purposes and objectives of the Ports Authorityâ€™s enabling act.\r\nThe first potential problem of interstate relations pointed out by the Ports Authority is that an ongoing dispute between two governmental entities in South Carolina as to which has the power to condemn the property puts both of them at a negotiating disadvantage with the State of Georgia.\r\nNext, the Ports Authority points out that Jasper County has already failed in one effort to condemn this same property, and the record in this case reveals several potential problems with the current condemnation.Â  In particular, the question arises from the record in this case as to whether the proposed condemnation is for public use, given the manner in which the County proposes to construct and operate the terminal.Â Â  The existence of a competing condemnation proceeding with such significant potential defects has the potential to be a major distraction to the Ports Authorityâ€™s efforts to acquire the property, and an advantage to the State of Georgia.\r\nEven more importantly, the Ports Authority points out that the ongoing litigation between the County and Georgia is a significant obstacle to the efforts of South Carolina to negotiate a compact with the State of Georgia on all issues regarding the Savannah River, from its headwaters in the Northwestern corner of our State, to the coast, including, but certainly not limited to, the development and operation of a port.Â  The Ports Authority has publicly stated that it wants to try to negotiate a resolution of these issues with Georgia, rather than to litigate them.Â  \r\nFinally, the existence of the Jasper County condemnation, and the danger of further litigation, give rise to the possibility that the State could be brought into a lawsuit in the federal courts of Georgia.\r\nTurning to the applicable law, the federal courts, and this Court, have recognized three separate ways in which federal law preempts state or local law.Â  Michigan Canners and Freezers Assâ€™n v. Agricultural Marketing &amp; Bargaining, 467 U.S. 461, 469, 104 S.Ct. 2518, 2523, 81 L.Ed.2d 399 (1984);Â  State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 186, 525 S.E.2d 872, 877 (2000).Â  The majority has adopted this approach to determining whether State law preempts local law.Â  Under the third of these preemption categories, sometimes referred to as â€œimplied conflict preemption,â€ local law is preempted â€œwhen the [local] law â€˜stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of [State law].â€™â€ Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers, 467 U.S. at 469, 104 S.Ct. at 2523 (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941)).Â  As stated by this Court, under this third category, local law is preempted â€œ. . . to the extent . . . the [local] law hinders the accomplishment of the [State] lawâ€™s purpose.â€Â  192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. at 186, 525 S.E.2d at 877.Â  \r\nTwo of the purposes of the Ports Authorityâ€™s enabling act are to allow the Ports Authority to purchase or condemn land for the construction and operation of port and shipping facilities,[13] and to manage interstate relations with Georgia regarding a port on the Savannah River. [14] Â  Jasper Countyâ€™s condemnation ordinance hinders the accomplishment of these purposes by interfering with the actions of the Ports Authority as described above.Â  The ordinance is therefore preempted.\r\nThe next question is whether or not it is appropriate for this Court to use its injunctive power.Â  I believe that it is.Â  \r\nThe majority makes clear that the Ports Authorityâ€™s condemnation power is superior to that of Jasper County.Â  It should follow that the Ports Authority can exercise that power in the manner it chooses.Â  Once a governmental entity decides to exercise its lawful authority to do anything, it is within the discretion of that governmental entity to decide how it wants to accomplish the task.Â  The Ports Authority could choose to initiate its own condemnation action, and by doing so, stop the pending action by Jasper County.Â  However, the Ports Authority has stated it does not choose to immediately initiate a condemnation proceeding, but rather prefers to exercise its condemnation power by first attempting to negotiate a solution with Georgia.Â  \r\nThis course of action has numerous obvious advantages over immediate litigation, including the possibility of avoiding litigation altogether.Â  In addition, it is consistent with sound public policy, and is contemplated by statutory provisions regarding condemnation.Â  See, e.g., South Carolina Code Â§ 28-2-70. \r\nAs explained above, however, the existence of the action by Jasper County interferes with the Ports Authorityâ€™s ability to pursue its statutory authority to negotiate before filing a lawsuit.Â  Therefore, I believe it is not enough merely to declare the superiority of the Ports Authorityâ€™s condemnation authority.Â  Going no farther than this would require the Ports Authority to take a course of action it does not deem to be advisable, immediate litigation, in order to exercise its condemnation power.Â  Rather, the only way the Ports Authority can exercise the superior power the majority of this Court recognizes it has, in the manner the Ports Authority should be allowed to choose, is for this Court to stop Jasper Countyâ€™s condemnation action by issuing an injunction.\r\n\r\n[1] Â County disputes this fact and asserts that the SCSPA did not contact or inform County of the SCSPAâ€™s intent to condemn the Proposed Site prior to this case.\r\n[2] Â The parties disagree over whether County has proposed to build a marine terminal or a port on the Savannah River. Whether County intends to develop a port or a marine terminal and the potential difference in the meaning of those terms is not determinative of the issues in this case.\r\n[3] Â County previously attempted to condemn the same land for construction of a terminal.Â  Georgia Dept. of Transp. v. Jasper County, 355 S.C. 631, 586 S.E.2d 853 (2003).Â  We found that condemnation to be unlawful.Â  We held that â€œCountyâ€™s proposed marine terminal does not meet our restrictive definition of public use.&nbsp; The private lessor, SAIT, will finance, design, develop, manage, and operate the marine terminal.&nbsp; The terminal itself will be a gated facility with no general right of public access.â€ Id. at 639, 586 S.E.2d at 857.Â  In holding the condemnation unlawful for lack of a public purpose, we noted that the lease arrangement in which County planned to lease the land to SAIT for ninety-nine years defeated the validity of the condemnation. Id.\r\n[4] Â See also Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 574 S.E.2d 196 (2002) (no preemption where ordinance affected the hours of operation of beer and wine retailers when Department of Revenue had authority to regulate operation of retailers of beer, ale, porter and/or wine); Barnhill v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 333 S.C. 482, 511 S.E.2d 361 (1999) (finding preemption of regulating watercraft on navigable waters where statute required local laws to be identical to statute); Wrenn Bail Bond Service, Inc. v. City of Hanahan, 335 S.C. 26, 28, 515 S.E.2d 521, 522 (1999) (finding preemption of the field of professional licensing for bail bondsmen through a statute providing, â€œ[no] license may be issued to a professional bondsman or runner except as provided in this chapterâ€);Â  Hospitality Assâ€™n of South Carolina, Inc., 320 S.C. at 228 n.9, 464 S.E.2d at 119 n.9 (no preemption of field of local sales taxation because of absence of legislative intent); AmVets Post 100 v. Richland County Council, 280 S.C. 317, 313 S.E.2d 293 (1984) (no preemption of the regulation of bingo but rather that the statute contemplated further regulation by counties and municipalities). \r\n[5] Other courts have recognized the three federal law preemption categories when considering whether a state law preempts a local law.Â  See Phantom of Clearwater, Inc. v. Pinellas County, 894 So.2d 1011 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005); Goodell v. Humboldt County, 575 N.W.2d 486 (Iowa 1998); Worton Creek Marina, LLC v. Claggett, 850 A.2d 1169 (Md. Ct. App. 2004); State ex rel. City of Alma v. Furnas County Farms, 667 N.W.2d 512 (Neb. 2003).\r\n[6]Â  Section 54-3-410 provides:\r\n\r\nThe [SCSPA] shall have general supervision on the port of Charleston of all wharves, warehouses and terminal facilities of all transmitting and transporting corporations and of all wharves, warehouses and terminal facilities of persons engaged in business of public warehousemen or wharfingers . . . . \r\n\r\n[7]Â  The SCSPA admits that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 54-5-10 provides a\r\nstatutory exception but argues that we should apply the statutory construction maxim expressio unius est exclusion alterius or â€œto express one thing implies the exclusion of the other, or the alternative.â€Â  Riverwoods, LLC v. County of Charleston, 349 S.C. 378, 563 S.E.2d 651 (2002).Â  In our opinion, the maxim does not apply because it would revive Dillonâ€™s Rule, which has been overruled by Home Rule.Â  See Williams v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 311 S.C. 417, 422, 429 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1993) (recognizing that Dillonâ€™s Rule had been abolished when Home Rule was enacted); Hospitality Assâ€™n of South Carolina, 320 S.C. at 225 n.4, 464 S.E.2d at 117 n.4 (prior to Home Rule, under S.C. Const., art. VIII, Â§ 17, courts strictly and narrowly construed any grant of local government power under Dillonâ€™s Rule).Â  \r\n[8] Â Non-SCSPA owned terminals have existed since the SCSPAâ€™s creation. See History of the South Carolina Ports Authority 88, 101, 128, 134 (R.L. Bryan Co., 1991).Â  Other private terminals in South Carolina include terminals owned by Nucor Steel, BP Amoco, MeadWestvaco, Chem-Marine, Shell, Exxon-Mobil, Allied, Salmon Dredging, Chevron-Texaco, Amerada Hess, Kinder Morgan, and the United States Navy.Â Â  In the Port of Charleston, the SCSPA operates five public terminals and oversees, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 54-3-410, nine other private terminals and seven bulk commodity terminals.Â  \r\n[9]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 54-3-140 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIn order to enable it to carry out the purposes of this chapter, the\r\n[SCSPA]:â€¦(4) May acquire, construct, maintain, equip and operate wharves, docks, ships, piers, quays, elevators, compresses, refrigeration storage plants, warehouses and other structures and any and all facilities needful for the convenient use of the same in the aid of commerceâ€¦. \r\n\r\n[10]Â  Further, if County develops a terminal on the Savannah River, this terminal would be under the SCSPAâ€™s general supervision pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 54-3-130, -410.\r\n[11]Â  Section 4-9-25 provides: \r\n\r\nAll counties of the State . . . have authority to enact regulations, resolutions, and ordinances, not inconsistent with the Constitution and general law of this State, including the exercise of these powers. . . respecting any subject as appears to them necessary and proper for the security, general welfare, and convenience of counties. . . .The powers of a county must be liberally construed in favor of the county and the specific mention of particular powers may not be construed as limiting in any manner the general powers of counties.\r\n\r\n[12] See footnote 3.\r\n[13] South Carolina Code Â§Â§ 54-3-130(2); 54-3-140(2); and 54-3-150.\r\n[14] While the purpose to â€œmanage interstate relationsâ€ is not explicitly stated in the enabling act, it is clearly implied.Â  With regard to ports, the State acts through the Ports Authority.Â  See generally South Carolina Code Â§ 54-3-110.Â  In some sections specifically, such as in section 54-3-130(8), and generally in others, the Ports Authority is given the responsibility of developing port facilities on the Savannah River.Â  The introductory paragraph to section 54-3-130, which sets forth the â€œpurposes,â€ states that the specifically listed â€œpurposesâ€ are â€œintended to broaden and not to restrict any other powers . . . .â€Â  Therefore, if the State is going to develop port facilities on that River, the Ports Authority is the entity that must manage relations with Georgia, to the extent that is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Jack L.

Booth, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nRobert L. Widener and Robert W. Dibble, Jr., both of McNair Law Firm, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This appeal raises the issue of whether the circuit court properly dismissed the plaintiffâ€™s complaint for failure state a claim against two defendants because the defendants were innocent or bona fide purchasers for value of real property without notice of the plaintiffâ€™s adverse claim or alleged title defect.Â  We certified this case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn May 1999, the late Floyd D. Spence (Owner 1) executed and delivered a deed conveying a parcel of real property located in Spence Plantation, a development at Lake Murray in Lexington County, to his wife, Deborah W. Spence (Owner 2).Â  This 1999 deed, which was not recorded at the time, identified a 0.72-acre parcel.Â  The parcel was a portion of some 163 acres originally owned by Owner 1, according to allegations in the complaint.\r\nIn January 2000, Owner 2 agreed to sell the lakefront lot to Wayne K. Wilkes and Susan A. Wilkes (Owner 3) for $250,000.Â  Robert P. Wilkins, Jr. (Agent), an attorney at law and a real estate agent, acted as agent for Owner 2.[1]Â  The lot was independently surveyed by Owner 3 after questioning the boundaries verbally described by Agent in an on-site inspection. \r\nOwner 2 alleges in her complaint she signed a deed conveying 0.72 acre to Owner 3 on April 3, 2000, with the understanding Agent would hold the deed until the closing date.Â  Owner 2 alleges she and Owner 1 denied Agentâ€™s request, made on behalf of Owner 3, to redefine the lotâ€™s boundaries so that it contained 0.82 acre - one-tenth of an acre more. \r\nOwner 2 further alleges Agent wrongfully and without her permission or knowledge (1) modified, submitted to county planning officials for approval, and caused to be recorded on April 20, 2000, a revised plat dated February 1, 2000, which shows a 0.82-acre parcel as Lot 42; (2) substituted a new page for the first page of the 1999 deed, which Owner 1 previously had signed conveying the lot to Owner 2, to identify a 0.82-acre parcel as Lot 42; and (3) substituted a new page for the first page of the 2000 deed, which Owner 2 previously had signed conveying the lot to Owner 3, to identify a 0.82-acre parcel as Lot 42 and the revised plat showing the new lot. \r\nThe closing on the sale of the lot occurred April 20, 2000.Â  The 1999 gift deed and the 2000 sale deed were publicly recorded with the Lexington County Register of Deeds four days later. \r\nIn 2002, Owner 3 sold the 0.82-acre lot to Donna T. Cromer and Roy Bunyan Cromer, Jr. (Owner 4), respondents, for $340,000.Â  According to allegations in the complaint, documents pertaining to Lot 42 then on record with the register of deeds were:Â  (1) the 1999 gift deed from Owner 1 to Owner 2 conveying Lot 42 consisting of 0.82 acre; (2) two earlier deeds described in the derivation clause of the 1999 deed, of which Lot 42 was a portion; (3) the 2000 sale deed from Owner 2 to Owner 3 conveying Lot 42 consisting of 0.82 acre; (4) the Spence Plantation - Phase IV plat with a revision date of February 1, 2000, showing Lot 42 consisting ofÂ  0.82 acre; and (5) the original 1997 plat of Spence Plantation - Phase IV, which did not show Lot 42, but revealed that the area next to Lot 41 and from which Lot 42 later was later created was held by Owner 1.Â  Furthermore, the complaint alleges the original 1999 gift deed from Owner 1 to Owner 2 conveying a 0.72-acre lot in the area of Lot 42 was never publicly recorded. \r\nOwner 2 seeks reformation of the deeds due to mutual mistake, seeks a declaratory judgment that the lot size is 0.72 acre, and alleges Agent committed legal malpractice by negligently altering the deeds.Â  Owner 4 moved pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, to dismiss Owner 2â€™s complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against them. \r\nThe circuit court granted the motion and dismissed the case against Owner 4 with prejudice, ruling the â€œComplaint gives rise to no reasonable interpretation other than that the Cromers [Owner 4] were bona fide purchasers for value.â€Â  The circuit court denied Owner 2â€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in dismissing with prejudice, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, Owner 2â€™s claims against Owner 4 because Owner 4 was an innocent or bona fide purchaser for value of the lot in question without notice of an alleged title defect or adverse claim?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  In considering such a motion, the trial court must base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  If the facts and inferences drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999).Â  In deciding whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, the appellate court must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief.Â  Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 522 S.E.2d 137 (1999).Â  A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should not be granted if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom entitle the plaintiff to relief under any theory.Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, the complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the action.Â  Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nOwner 2 presents four arguments alleging the circuit court erred in dismissing with prejudice her claims against Owner 4 pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  \r\nA.Â  DUTY TO FURTHER EXAMINE TITLE \r\nOwner 2 contends the circuit court erred in dismissing her complaint against Owner 4 because Owner 4 had a duty of inquiry to further examine a potential title defect or adverse claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nA purchaser may assert a plea in equity of a bona fide purchaser for value, without notice of defect in his title, by showing (1) he has actually paid in full the purchase money (giving security for the payment is not sufficient, nor is past indebtedness a sufficient consideration); (2) he purchased and acquired the legal title, or the best right to it; and (3) he purchased bona fide, i.e., in good faith and with integrity of dealing, without notice of a lien or defect.Â  The bona fide purchaser must show all three conditions - actual payment, acquiring of legal title, and bona fide purchase - occurred before he had notice of a title defect or other adverse claim, lien, or interest in the property.Â  S.C. Tax Commn. v. Belk, 266 S.C. 539, 543, 225 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1976); Jones v. Eichholz, 212 S.C. 411, 422, 48 S.E.2d 21, 25-26 (1948); Kirton v. Howard, 137 S.C. 11, 36, 134 S.E. 859, 868 (1926); Black v. Childs, 14 S.C. 312, 318 (1880); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (Supp. 2004);[2] 92A C.J.S. Vendor &amp; Purchaser Â§ 483 (2000).\r\nThere are two basic forms of notice by which a purchaser may be charged with knowledge of the rights of another in real property:Â  actual notice and constructive/inquiry notice.Â  Belk, 266 S.C. at 544-43, 225 S.E.2d at 179; Jones, 212 S.C. at 422, 48 S.E.2d at 25-26; Epps v. McCallum Realty Co., 139 S.C. 481, 498-99, 138 S.E. 297, 302 (1927). \r\n1.Â  ACTUAL NOTICE\r\nWe have explained in the context of an action brought under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act that â€œ[a]ctual notice means all the facts are disclosed and there is nothing left to investigate.Â  Notice is regarded as actual where the person sought to be charged therewith either knows of the existence of the particular facts in question or is conscious of having the means of knowing it, even though such means may not be employed by him.Â  Generally, actual notice is synonymous with knowledge.â€Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commn., 332 S.C. 54, 64 n.6., 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 n.6 (1998) (citations omitted).Â  Moreover, â€œ[a]ctual notice may be shown by direct evidence or inferred from factual circumstances.â€Â  Id. at 65, 504 S.E.2d at 123.\r\nSimilarly, in the context of a real estate transaction, a purchaser of real property has actual notice of a title defect or other claim, lien, or interest adverse to his own in a particular property when he actually knows about the defect or claim, or when a reasonable person, if made aware of the same information known to the buyer, would be charged with actual notice of the defect or claim.Â  Actual notice may consist of facts or conditions observed by a prospective purchaser as well as information conveyed orally or in writing to him.Â  E.g. Adams v. Willis, 225 S.C. 518, 522, 83 S.E.2d 171, 173 (1954) (purchaser with actual knowledge that property was subject to lease, as well as fact that service station existed on lot, was charged with knowledge of the lease); Walker v. Taylor, 104 S.C. 1, 15, 88 S.E. 300, 303-04 (1916) (where land buyer prior to sale had actual notice, orally and in writing, of stepdaughterâ€™s claim of one-third interest in property, buyer was not a bona fide purchaser for value without notice; the stepdaughterâ€™s claim â€œwas of interest to him, and he is charged with all the knowledge he could have had that day for the asking.Â  He is charged with this full and complete information in ordinary fairness as well as in law.â€).\r\nThe complaint in the present case does not allege any fact or theory of recovery indicating Owner 4 had actual notice of a title defect or adverse claim with regard to Lot 42.\r\n2.Â  CONSTRUCTIVE OR INQUIRY NOTICE\r\nWe have explained in the context of an action brought under the Tort Claims Act that â€œ[c]onstructive notice is a legal inference which substitutes for actual notice.Â  It is notice imputed to a person whose knowledge of facts is sufficient to put him on inquiry; if these facts were pursued with due diligence, they would lead to other undisclosed facts.Â  Therefore, this person is presumed to have actual knowledge of the undisclosed facts.â€Â  Strother, 332 S.C. at 64 n.6., 504 S.E.2d at 122 n.6.\r\nThe proper execution and delivery of a deed is effective to convey real property from grantor to grantee.Â  As between grantor and grantee, a properly drawn deed is valid and dispositive of their respective ownership and rights in the property regardless of whether the deed is publicly recorded.Â  Epps, 139 S.C. at 497, 138 S.E. at 302; Martin v. Quattlebaum, 14 S.C.L. 205, 207 (3 McCord) (1825).Â  \r\nHowever, constructive or inquiry notice in the context of a real estate transaction often is grounded in an examination of the public record because it is the proper recording of documents asserting an interest or claim in real property which gives constructive notice to the world.Â  The recording of a document alerts all future grantees of the rights of the recorder because the law assumes the grantee will search the index and discover the interest or claim.Â  Epps, 139 S.C. at 499, 138 S.E. at 303 (â€œrecording amounts to notice, whether known or unknown, because the means of information are at handâ€); Franklin Bank, N.A. v. Bowling, 74 P.3d 308, 313 (Colo. 2003) (en banc) (constructive notice in real estate transaction essentially is record notice).\r\nRecording acts dating back to the days when South Carolina was an English colony - at least since 1698 - have provided that innocent or bona fide purchasers of real property, who pay valuable consideration, are protected from the claims of creditors or lienholders whose claims were not on record at the time of conveyance to the bona fide purchaser.Â  Epps, 139 S.C. at 496-511, 138 S.E. at 302-07 (discussing development and importance of recording acts, and holding that mere possession of real property by person who held unrecorded contract of sale for deed did not constitute constructive notice of that claim, such that further investigation by subsequent mortgagee was required); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (Supp. 2004); accord Belcher v. Powers, 573 S.E.2d 12, 19 (W. Va. 2002) (party is not entitled to protection as a bona fide purchaser, without notice, unless he looks to every part of the title he is purchasing, neglecting no source of information respecting it which common prudence suggests); Tauber v. Com. ex rel. Kilgore, 562 S.E.2d 118, 127 (Va. 2002) (purchaser of real property is bound by both actual and constructive notice and has no right to shut his eyes or ears to the inlet of information, and then say he is a bona fide purchaser for value without notice).\r\nConstructive or inquiry notice in the context of a real estate transaction also may arise when a party becomes aware or should have become aware of certain facts which, if investigated, would reveal the claim of another.Â  The party will be charged by operation of law with all knowledge that an investigation by a reasonably cautious and prudent purchaser would have revealed.Â  As this Court has explained in a case involving the transfer of real property,\r\n\r\nIf there are circumstances sufficient to put a party upon the inquiry, he is held to have notice of everything which that inquiry, properly conducted, would certainly disclose; but constructive notice goes no further.Â  It stands upon the principle that the party is bound to the exercise of due diligence, and is assumed to have the knowledge to which that diligence would lead him; but he is not held to have notice of matter which lies beyond the range of that inquiry and which that diligence might not disclose.Â  There must appear to be, in the nature of the case, such a connection between the facts disclosed and the further facts to be discovered, that the former could justly be viewed as furnishing a clue to the latter.\r\n\r\nBlack v. Childs, 14 S.C. 312, 321-22 (1880) (buyers did not have actual or constructive/inquiry notice that master-in-equity who oversaw the property sale had illegally bought it through a friend, or notice of masterâ€™s alleged interest in the property; therefore, subsequent grantee was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice and the tainted sale six years earlier would not be voided).\r\nâ€œThis Court has been most exacting in determining what actions satisfy the requirements of inquiry notice.Â  We have denied subsequent purchasers comfort under the umbrella of a bona fide purchaser when the exercise of prudence would have avoided the difficulty.â€Â  Belk, 266 S.C. at 544, 225 S.E.2d at 179 (claim of bona fide purchaser for value will be defeated when â€œsufficient record notice is available to charge the purchaser with a duty to inquire which, if pursued with due diligence would have supplied him with knowledge of the rights of other partiesâ€); accord Adams v. Willis, 225 S.C. 518, 522, 83 S.E.2d 171, 173 (1954) (purchaser had duty to make reasonable inquiry and investigation as to commencement date of lease, and he was chargeable with notice of effective date, when he had both actual and constructive notice that property was subject to lease); Cathcart v. Matthews, 115 S.C. 1, 6, 104 S.E. 180, 181 (1920) (trial court properly submitted defense of bona fide purchaser to jury where facts were in dispute about constructive or inquiry notice). \r\nThe complaint in the present case alleges facts and a theory of recovery based on constructive or inquiry notice grounded in the public record.Â  The question in this instance is whether the deeds and plats on record at the date of the conveyance from Owner 3 to Owner 4 imposed on Owner 4 a duty to inquire further about potential title defects or adverse claims.Â  In other words, did the public record raise a â€œred flagâ€ requiring further inquiry by Owner 4?Â  \r\nOwner 2 points to two facts alleged in her complaint which should have alerted Owner 4 to a potential title defect or adverse claim.Â  First, Owner 2 cites the â€œlong delayâ€ between the execution date of the first deed in May 1999 and the preparation in February 2000 of the revised subdivision plat, which was recorded in April 2000.Â  Second, Owner 2 cites the fact that the original 1997 plat recorded for Spence Plantation did not include Lot 42.Â  Owner 4 should have investigated why the revised 2000 plat referenced in the deeds was not prepared until some nine months after the deed from Owner 1 to Owner 2 was executed.\r\nWe conclude neither of these facts would prompt a reasonable purchaser to conduct further inquiry after examining this public record.Â  The record notice to Owner 4 as of the closing date in 2002 revealed Owner 1, according to the original 1997 plat, held additional acreage from which Lot 42 was drawn.Â  Owner 1 conveyed the 0.82-acre Lot 42 to Owner 2, his wife, by deed executed in May 1999.Â  This recorded deed referred, in a notation stamped in the margin, to the revised plat showing Lot 42.Â  In February 2000, two months before Owner 2â€™s conveyance of Lot 42 to Owner 3, the original 1997 plat was revised to show the newly created Lot 42.Â  The 1999 gift deed conveying the 0.82-acre Lot 42 to Owner 2 and the 2000 sale deed conveying the 0.82-acre Lot 42 to Owner 3 - both of which referred to the revised 2000 plat showing the 0.82-acre Lot 42 - were duly recorded in April 2000.Â  The public record contains no mention of a 0.72-acre Lot 42. \r\nA buyer examining the public record would reasonably have concluded that a legitimate chain of title existed with regard to Lot 42.Â  The 1999 deed was recorded and the 1997 plat was revised in 2000 only when Owner 3 entered the picture as an unrelated purchaser who, naturally, would want the public record to accurately set forth the existence, chain of title, and boundaries of a lot costing $250,000. \r\nWe affirm the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of Owner 2â€™s claim against Owner 4 because the facts as alleged in the complaint raise no issue of actual or constructive/inquiry notice with regard to Owner 4â€™s purchase of Lot 42.Â  Owner 4, under the facts alleged, is a bona fide purchaser for value because they actually paid the purchase money in full, purchased and acquired the legal title, and purchased in good faith and with integrity of dealing without notice of a lien or defect.Â  \r\nB.Â  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE NOT PROPERLY RAISED\r\nOwner 4 did not file and serve an answer to Owner 2â€™s complaint.Â  Instead, Owner 4 filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), asserting the defense of bona fide purchaser for value.Â  The grounds for the motion were debated at a subsequent hearing.Â  Owner 2 argues the circuit court erred in dismissing her complaint against Owner 4 because Owner 4 is prohibited from asserting the affirmative defense of bona fide purchaser for value in a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nOwner 2 correctly cites the principle that an affirmative defense ordinarily may not be asserted in a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) unless the allegations of the complaint demonstrate the existence of the affirmative defense.Â  See Crocker v. Barr, 295 S.C. 195, 197, 367 S.E.2d 471, 472 (Ct. App. 1988) (stating the general principle), overruled on other grounds, 305 S.C. 406, 409 S.E.2d 368 (1991).Â  This rule arises out of the notion that consideration of an affirmative defense usually requires reference to factual allegations and matters which are beyond the scope of allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Therefore, because the factual analysis of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is confined to the four corners of the complaint, an affirmative defense usually must be pled in an answer and either resolved in later motions such as summary judgment or directed verdict or at trial. Â 5 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Civil 3d, Â§ 1277 (2004).\r\nIn cases decided long before the adoption of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure in 1985, this Court stated that the affirmative defense of bona fide purchaser for value usually must be pled and proved.Â  See Carr v. Mouzon, 93 S.C. 161, 167, 76 S.E. 201, 203 (1912) (plea of bona fide purchaser when relied on as defense must be pleaded); Lupo v. True, 16 S.C. 579, 586 (1882) (purchaser for valuable consideration without notice is an equitable defense and must be set out in the answer and sustained by the defendant); L.S. Tellier, Pleading Bona Fide Purchase of Real Property As Defense, 33 A.L.R.2d 1322, Â§Â§ 1(b) and 2(a) (1954) (â€œit is recognized that, in order to avail himself of such defense, a defendant must aver in his pleadings that he was a bona fide purchaserâ€).\r\nHowever, the general prohibition against pleading an affirmative defense in a motion to dismiss has been relaxed in modern practice.Â  Most courts allow such defenses to be raised in a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b) â€œwhen there is no disputed issue of fact raised by an affirmative defense, or the facts are completely disclosed on the face of the pleadings, and realistically nothing further can be developed by pretrial discovery or a trial on the issue raised by the defense. . . .â€Â  Wright and Miller, supra, Â§ 1277.Â  This view is in keeping with the pleading and discovery system established by the Rules of Civil Procedure, which allow a party to raise Rule 12(b) defenses in a pre-answer motion.Â  See Rule 12(b), SCRCP and accompanying notes (allowing certain defenses to be raised by pre-answer motion at option of pleader) and Rule 12(a), SCRCP (altering deadline for defendantâ€™s answer when defendant serves a pre-answer motion). \r\nOwner 4 in this instance properly asserted the affirmative defense of bona fide purchaser for value in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.Â  The defense did not raise a disputed issue of fact and the relevant facts were completely disclosed in the complaint.Â  Owner 2 has not shown that further facts could be developed by pretrial discovery or a trial on the defense of bona fide purchaser for value.Â  The circuit court properly dismissed the complaint against Owner 4.\r\nC.Â  â€œNO-TITLEâ€ ARGUMENT\r\nOwner 2 argues the circuit court erred in dismissing her claims against Owner 4 because she never gained legal title to the disputed tenth of an acre; therefore, she could not and did not convey that tenth of an acre to Owner 3, meaning Owner 3 could not and did not convey it to Owner 4.Â  We disagree.\r\nOwner 2 correctly cites the principle that a grantee ordinarily may not claim bona fide purchaser status if his grantor never had title to the property in question.Â  See Cook v. Eller, 298 S.C. 395, 397, 380 S.E.2d 853, 854 (Ct. App. 1989) (stating the general principle); 92A C.J.S. Vendor &amp; Purchaser Â§ 484 (2000) (stating â€œdoctrine of bona fide purchaser without notice generally does not apply where there is a total absence of title in the vendor, and the good faith of the purchaser cannot create a title where none existsâ€).\r\nThis principle is inapplicable in the present case because the title conveyed to Owner 4 was apparently perfect, good at law, and made by a regular conveyance.Â  See 92A C.J.S. Vendor &amp; Purchaser Â§ 484.Â  Owner 1 conveyed legal title in the 0.82-acre Lot 42, a portion of a larger tract in which he held legal title, to Owner 2 by a deed duly executed and delivered in 1999 and recorded in 2000.Â  Owner 2 conveyed legal title in exactly the same lot to Owner 3 by a deed duly executed, delivered, and recorded in 2000.Â  Owner 3 conveyed legal title in exactly the same lot to Owner 4 by deed duly executed, delivered, and recorded in 2002.Â  \r\nThe issues of whether the conveyance of 0.82-acre from Owner 1 to Owner 2, and from Owner 2 to Owner 3, was a mutual mistake or the result of alleged negligence by Agent apparently remain pending in circuit court against the remaining defendants.Â  But the factual allegations contained in the complaint reveal Owner 1 held valid legal title to the area from which the 0.82-acre lot was created, and the lot was properly conveyed from Owner 1 to subsequent owners.Â  The circuit court properly dismissed the complaint against Owner 4.\r\nChief Justice Toal, dissenting, would hold the alleged material alteration of the deed by Agent without the consent of Owner 2 prevented title in the additional tenth of an acre from passing to Owner 3 or Owner 4. Â We agree generally with the principle of law stated by the Chief Justice, i.e., that a fraudulent deed is void ab initio and, because it is a nullity, it ordinarily may not convey valid title to the grantee.Â  However, we do not find this single principle dispositive in this case.Â  Owner 2 in her complaint does not allege Agent acted with an intent to defraud Owners 1 and 2 of a portion of their property by materially altering the deeds and plat.Â  Owner 2â€™s complaint seeks only reformation of the deeds due to a mutual mistake, seeks a declaratory judgment that the lot size is 0.72 acre, and alleges Agent committed legal malpractice by negligently altering the deeds and plat.Â  Furthermore, the proposition of law stated by the Chief Justice is incomplete, standing alone, to resolve this case because Owner 4 properly has asserted the defense of bona fide purchaser for value as previously explained.\r\nJustice Pleicones, dissenting, would find the complaint states a declaratory judgment action that title in the disputed tenth of an acre did not pass to Owner 4 because Owner 2 never acquired title to that portion.Â  Justice Pleicones agrees with us the complaint alleges an agency relationship between Agent and Owners 1 and 2.Â  See footnote 1.Â  But, he reasons, Agent lacked the authority to alter the deeds and plat because the complaint alleges Owners 1 and 2 did not give Agent actual authority to alter them and it does not allege Agent had apparent authority to do so.Â  He would find Agentâ€™s actions may not be imputed to Owners 1 or 2 due to the lack of authority, which means Owner 2â€™s allegation she never acquired title to the tenth of an acre is sufficient to defeat Owner 4â€™s motion to dismiss.\r\nThe doctrine of apparent authority provides that the principal is bound by the acts of his agent when he has placed the agent in such a position that persons of ordinary prudence, reasonably knowledgeable with business usages and customs, are led to believe the agent has certain authority and they in turn deal with the agent based on that assumption.Â  Fernander v. Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140, 143, 293 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1982); Frasier v. Palmetto Homes of Florence, Inc., 323 S.C. 240, 244, 473 S.E.2d 865, 868-69 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  A principal may be held liable to a third person in a civil lawsuit for the fraud, deceit, concealment, misrepresentation, negligence, and other omissions of duty of his agent which occur in the scope of the agentâ€™s employment, even when the principal did not authorize, participate in, or know of such misconduct or even when the principal forbade or disapproved of the act in question.Â  West v. Service Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., 220 S.C. 198, 66 S.E.2d 816 (1951).Â  This rule â€œis founded upon public policy and convenience, for in no other way could there be any safety to third persons in their dealings, either directly with the principal, or indirectly with him through the instrumentality of agents. Â In every such case the principal holds out his agent as competent and fit to be trusted, and thereby, in effect, he warrants his fidelity and good conduct in all matters within the scope of the agency. . . . Seeing that some one must be loser by the deceit, it is more reasonable that he who employs and confides in the deceiver should be the loser than a stranger.â€Â  Id. at 202, 66 S.E.2d at 817 (internal quotes omitted); accord Jones v. Elbert, 211 S.C. 553, 558, 34 S.E.2d 796, 798 (1945) (as a matter of public policy, principal who selects agent and directs manner in which agent executes his role, in justice to third person with whom agent may deal and who are not responsible either for his selection or conduct, is liable for agentâ€™s torts committed in furtherance of principalâ€™s business); Federal Land Bank of Columbia v. Ledford, 194 S.C. 347, 359, 9 S.E.2d 804, 809 (1940) (where agency is established and there is a wrong committed by agent, principal must ordinarily bear the loss whether the agency is actual or apparent; and equity intervenes under the rule where one of two innocent persons must suffer, he who brings about the loss must bear it); 3 Am.Jur.2d Agency Â§Â§ 262-270 (2002).\r\nThese agency principles are rooted in the same ground as the doctrine of bona fide purchaser for value which applies in this case.Â  In both instances, a third party may be entitled to rely on the actions of an authorized agent or the public record of land conveyances.Â  In our view, the only reasonable conclusion which may be drawn from the facts and allegations set forth in the complaint is that Agent had apparent authority to act on behalf of Owners 1 and 2 in the 1999 gift conveyance and the 2000 sale.Â  The complaint does not allege otherwise and, as previously noted, Owner 2 asserts in her complaint she had an attorney-client relationship with Agent.Â  Consequently, it is appropriate to impute Agentâ€™s allegedly negligent actions to Owner 2.Â  To hold otherwise would allow Owner 2 to avoid the doctrine of bona fide purchaser for value and seek damages from Owner 4 simply by asserting that her admitted Agent, although he had apparent authority to act generally on her behalf in the transactions, did not have authority to perform the specific, negligent acts alleged in the complaint.[3]\r\nD.Â  DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE\r\nOwner 2 in a motion made pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, asked the circuit court to grant her at least fifteen days to file and serve an amended complaint instead of dismissing the complaint with prejudice.Â  Owner 2 contends the circuit court erred in denying her motion to amend the complaint, i.e., the court should have dismissed the complaint without prejudice instead of with prejudice.Â  We disagree.\r\nDismissal of a case â€œwithout prejudiceâ€ means a plaintiff may\r\nreassert her complaint by curing defects that led to the dismissal.Â  In contrast, dismissal of a complaint â€œwith prejudiceâ€ is intended to bar relitigation of the same claim.Â  Collins v. Sigmon, 299 S.C. 464, 467, 385 S.E.2d 835, 837 (1989).\r\nDismissal of a complaint does not bar a subsequent action brought before expiration of the statute of limitations if the dismissal is based merely on the insufficiency of the complaint.Â  Sealy v. Dodge, 289 S.C. 543, 347 S.E.2d 504 (1986); Hennegan v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 211 S.C. 357, 45 S.E.2d 331 (1947).Â  Dismissal of a case precludes relitigation only on matters actually decided in the dismissal.Â  Sealy, 289 S.C. at 544, 347 S.E.2d at 505 (dismissal for improper joinder and lack of capacity to sue precluded only those issues).\r\nWhen a complaint is dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the dismissal generally is without prejudice.Â  The plaintiff in most cases should be given an opportunity to file and serve an amended complaint.Â  See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (rules of civil procedure should be liberally construed to do substantial justice and lower court erred in denying motion to amend complaint where amendment would have stated alternative theory of recovery); Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 442-44, 175 S.E.2d 802, 804 (1970) (affirming dismissal of complaint for failure to proceed, but finding it should have been dismissed without prejudice); Dockside Assn., Inc. v. Deytens, Simmons &amp; Carlisle, 297 S.C. 91, 374 S.E.2d 907 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing Rule 15(a), SCRCP, that plaintiff generally is allowed to amend a complaint to correct deficiencies which resulted in dismissal under provisions of Rule 12(b)); Davis v. Lunceford, 279 S.C. 503, 507, 309 S.E.2d 791, 793 (Ct. App. 1983) (trial court properly dismissed action in which plaintiff served summons but failed to timely serve complaint, but dismissal with prejudice was improper because such a dismissal is in nature of discontinuance of action and is not an adjudication on the merits; action should have been dismissed without prejudice); accord Arkansas Dept. of Environ. Quality v. Brighton, 102 S.W.3d 458, 468 (Ark. 2003) (complaint dismissed for failure to state facts upon which relief can be granted should be dismissed without prejudice in order for plaintiff to decide whether to serve amended complaint or appeal); Thacker v. Bartlett, 785 N.E.2d 621, 624 (Ind. App. 2003) (dismissal for failure to state a claim is without prejudice because the complaining party may either file an amended complaint or stand upon complaint and appeal); Giuliani v. Chuck, 620 P.2d 733, 737 (Haw. App. 1980) (complaint is not subject to dismissal with prejudice unless it appears to a certainty that no relief can be granted under any set of facts that can be proved in support of its allegations); James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 95 (2d ed. 1996) (party who loses a motion to dismiss normally is given the right to amend the complaint to cure the defect).\r\nWhen a complaint is dismissed without prejudice and the plaintiff is given the opportunity to file and serve an amended complaint, but instead chooses to appeal, the plaintiff ordinarily waives the right to amend his complaint.Â  The appellate court may affirm the dismissal with prejudice if it determines the lower court properly dismissed the complaint.Â  Brighton, 102 S.W.3d at 468; Swink v. Ernst &amp; Young, 908 S.W.2d 660, 663 (Ark. 1995) (when trial court dismisses complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state facts upon which relief can be granted, dismissal is without prejudice; plaintiff then has the election to plead further or appeal). \r\nWhen a plaintiff is not given the opportunity to file and serve an amended complaint, but is left with no choice but to appeal after dismissal of her case with prejudice, an appellate court which affirms the dismissal may modify the lower courtâ€™s order to find the dismissal is without prejudice.Â  When the statute of limitations has expired, the appellate court may in its discretion impose a reasonable period of time in which to amend the complaint.Â  An appellate court should follow this procedure when the plaintiff presents additional factual allegations or a different theory of recovery which, taken as true in a well-pleaded complaint, may state a claim upon which relief may be granted.Â  Potter, Prescott, Jamieson &amp; Nelson, P.A. v. Campbell, 708 A.2d 283, 286-87 (Me. 1998) (trial court acted within its discretion in dismissing case with prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) where plaintiff was unable to show how he would cure defects in his complaint if granted leave to amend it); Barkley v. Good Will Home Assn., 495 A.2d 1238 (Me. 1985) (in absence of bad or dilatory motives on the part of plaintiff or undue prejudice to defendant, the trial court abused its discretion by denying the plaintiff an opportunity to amend her complaint after it was dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)); Baker v. Town of Middlebury, 753 N.E.2d 67, 74 (Ind. App. 2001) (dismissal of complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) with prejudice was harmless error because plaintiff failed to show how he would have amended his complaint to avoid dismissal).\r\nOn the other hand, when a complaint is dismissed with prejudice and the plaintiff erroneously is denied the opportunity to file and serve an amended complaint, but the plaintiff fails to present additional factual allegations or a different theory of recovery which may give rise to a claim upon which relief may be granted, the appellate court may in its discretion affirm the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice.Â  Potter, 708 A.2d at 286-87; Baker, 753 N.E.2d at 74.\r\nApplying these principles in the present case, we conclude this case falls in the final category.Â  Owner 2â€™s complaint was dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) when ordinarily the dismissal would have been without prejudice.Â  However, Owner 2 has failed to present any additional factual allegations or a different theory of recovery which may give rise to a cause of action upon which relief may be granted against Owner 4.Â  Owner 2 in her Rule 59(e) motion and on appeal merely reiterates the same allegations originally pleaded in her complaint.Â  Those factual allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action against Owner 4, as previously discussed.Â  Furthermore, Owner 2 has not asserted or shown the need for additional time to discover facts pertaining to Owner 4â€™s potential liability in this matter.Â  Cf. Baughman v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991) (â€œsummary judgment must not be granted until the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discoveryâ€).Â  Accordingly, the circuit court properly dismissed the complaint with prejudice against Owner 4.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal with prejudice of Owner 2â€™s complaint against Owner 4 pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., and PLEICONES, J., dissenting in separate opinions.\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the deed executed by Mrs. Spence (Owner) was fraudulent because the deed was materially altered prior to delivery to Buyer 3.Â  As a result, I would reverse the ruling of the trial judge dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim.\r\nThe majority holds that Buyer 4 was a bona fide purchaser who took title from Buyer 3 in good faith and without notice.Â  I disagree.Â  In my opinion, the majority fails to address the black-letter law which provides that a fraudulent deed is void ab initio and constitutes a nullity.Â  26A C.J.S.Â  Deeds Â§ 114 (2001).Â  As a result, the deed cannot be the basis for superior title against an original grantor, even under the equitable doctrine of a bona fide purchaser.Â  Id; see also Concord Corp. v. Huff, 355 P.2d 73, 76 (Colo. 1960) (holding that void deeds do not convey title); Andre v. Hoffman, 95 S.E. 84, 87 (W. Va. 1918) (holding that the grantee of a forged deed cannot acquire title under the forged instrument).\r\nIn the present case, Owner 2 executed a deed to convey 0.72 of an acre to Owner 3 in 2000.Â  Prior to the delivery of the instrument to Owner 3, the deed was altered without the consent of Owner 2, by an Agent for Owner 2.Â  The alteration made the instrument reflect a conveyance of 0.82 of an acre.Â Â Â  Owner 3 then conveyed the 0.82 of an acre to Owner 4. Â However, Owner 2 wished to only convey 0.72 of an acre and signed an instrument that reflected such.Â  The majority focuses on the intent of the person that made the alteration, Agent, however, this does not address the issue that instrument did not reflect the intent of Owner 2.Â  As a result, the alteration of the instrument by Agent, regardless of Agentâ€™s intent, prevented title from passing.\r\nConsequently, I would hold that the change by the agent without the consent of Owner 2 constituted a material alteration.Â  In my opinion, this would prevent title from passing to Owner 3 or Owner 4 because the unauthorized change in acreage resulted in a fraudulent deed.Â  Accordingly, I would reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision dismissing the compliant.Â Â  \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I agree with the majority that neither Owner 3 nor Owner 4 had any notice of a defect in the chain of title.Â  I agree with the Chief Justice, however, that it can be reasonably deduced from the face of the complaint that Owner 2 never acquired title to the tenth of an acre at issue and that Owner 4 therefore cannot be a good faith purchaser for value.Â  Consequently, I would reverse the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a cause of action for declaratory judgment.\r\nâ€œA ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss must be based solely upon the allegations set forth on the face of the complaint.â€Â  Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, , 416, 357 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1987).Â  Regardless whether the court believes that the plaintiff is likely to prevail on the merits, â€œ the motion cannot be sustained if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe majority is correct that the complaint alleges an agency relationship between Wilkins and Owners 1 and 2.Â  That is not dispositive, as the complaint further alleges that neither Owner 1 nor Owner 2 invested Wilkins with actual authority to alter the deeds or the plat at issue.Â  Furthermore, the complaint does not aver that Wilkins had apparent authority to alter the instruments, nor can such be reasonably deduced from its four corners.Â  If Wilkins lacked actual or apparent authority to perform these acts, then his conduct cannot be imputed to Owner 1 or Owner 2.Â  Thus, principles of agency do not facially negate the allegation that Owner 2 never acquired title to the tenth of an acre.Â  That allegation, on its face, is thus sufficient to defeat the claim that Owner 4 is a good faith purchaser for value.\r\nI find troubling that the complaint fails to spell out the relief sought by Owner 2.Â  The complaint does not allege that Owner 2 would be entitled to the tenth of an acre, as devisee or heir, if the disputed acreage were returned to Owner 1â€™s estate.Â  Nevertheless, the complaint reasonably indicates Owner 2â€™s desire to insulate herself from a potential breach-of-warranty action.Â  Further factual development is necessary to determine whether her concern is legitimate.Â  I would therefore hold that the complaint states a cause of action for declaratory judgment.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Owner 2 in her reply brief objects to any description of Robert P. Wilkins, Jr., as her agent because Wilkins purportedly did not admit such a relationship in his answer and the circuit courtâ€™s order did not make such a finding of fact.Â  We note that Owner 2 in her complaint asserts she had an attorney-client relationship with Wilkins in the 1999 gift conveyance and in the 2000 sale.Â  Owner 2 is bound by that factual assertion in an appeal of a ruling made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), in which the facts asserted by the plaintiff in her complaint are deemed to be true.Â  While Wilkins is deemed to be Owner 2â€™s agent for purposes of this appeal, the parties and other litigants are not bound by this designation because it may present a factual issue in ongoing litigation of this matter.\r\n[2]Â  Section 30-7-10 provides, in pertinent part:\r\nAll deeds of conveyance of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, either in fee simple or for life . . . and generally all instruments in writing conveying an interest in real estate required by law to be recorded in the office of the register of deeds or clerk of court . . . are valid so as to affect the rights of subsequent creditors (whether lien creditors or simple contract creditors), or purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, only from the day and hour when they are recorded in the office of the register of deeds or clerk of court of the county in which the real property affected is situated.Â  In the case of a subsequent purchaser of real estate, or in the case of a subsequent lien creditor on real estate for valuable consideration without notice, the instrument evidencing the subsequent conveyance or subsequent lien must be filed for record in order for its holder to claim under this section as a subsequent creditor or purchaser for value without notice, and the priority is determined by the time of filing for record.\r\n[3]Â  We find instructive the following observation made during a discussion of how to determine which acts of an agent fall within the scope of employment:\r\n\r\n  It is not that the master or principal authorized the negligent act which\r\n  caused the damage, but that the servant or agent acted negligently in carrying out the orders or in doing the work of the master or principal.Â &nbsp;\r\nTo illustrate: Â The master or principal is responsible for the negligent act\r\nof the servant or agent in doing the work which he is directed to perform. Â If the master or principal\r\ndirect[s] the servant or agent to drive an automobile carefully along the crowded street, and the latter does drive along such street, but by his negligence another is injured by such driving, the master or principal\r\ncannot escape responsibility by showing that the servant neglected his orders to drive carefully.Â  Again, if one dictates a letter to a stenographer, and, at the conclusion of the dictation, directs the stenographer to transcribe the letter, sign his principalâ€™s name thereto, and forward to the correspondent, can it be doubted that the employer in such case would be responsible for any negligent error of the stenographer in so transcribing and forwarding the letter, whereby the correspondent was misled to his damage?\r\n\r\nEureka Cotton Mills v. Western Union Tel. Co., 88 S.C. 498, 70 S.E. 1040, 1050 (1911).Â  Similarly, Owners 1 and 2 directed Agent to prepare documents conveying real property to another.Â  Owner 2 may not shift the burden of a loss caused by alleged errors in those documents to Owner 4 simply by asserting her admitted agent neglected to follow her instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26133","title":"Erickson v.

of action for defamation, invasion of privacy, and negligence against Jones Street Publishers, LLC (Newspaper).Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nNewspaper publishes the Charleston City Paper, a free weekly newspaper with a circulation of about 30,000.Â  Newspaper on January 19, 2000, published a front-page news story titled â€œIn A Childâ€™s Best Interest:Â  Is the guardian ad litem program giving children a voice?â€Â  In a promotional teaser in the table of contents on page three, Newspaper stated:\r\n\r\nProtecting the Children\r\nThe Guardian Ad Litem program has come under fire recently for a series of transgressions.Â  One high profile case has a Guardian reportedly becoming romantically involved with the father of a child.Â  Critics claim volunteers with a lack of training and professional expertise have too much authority.Â  How did this happen, and what is being done to remedy the situation?Â \r\n\r\nIn introductory paragraphs preceding the main body of the article, Newspaper stated:\r\nEvery child in the judicial system needs to have a voice.\r\n\r\nParents have the benefit of experience, age, and lawyers to make their case.Â  But what of a 7-year-old boy whose family is crumbling right in front of him and only sees himself to blame - who is to speak for him?\r\nIn South Carolina, they are called Guardian Ad Litems (GALs).Â  In a perfect world, they provide an objective perspective for whatâ€™s best for the child - momâ€™s house, dadâ€™s house, neither.\r\nBut what happens if their objectivity is compromised?Â  What if, while carrying out their duties, they step across the line, like sleeping with the clientâ€™s father?\r\nItâ€™s already happened, and the result is a public effort to abolish half of the GAL system and radically modify the other half.Â \r\n\r\nThe article then began with a subsection titled â€œWhom to Believe?â€Â  In that first subsection, Newspaper recounted the claims of Pat Beal, a Summerville grandmother who said her daughter and two grandchildren had moved into her home to escape the daughterâ€™s physically abusive husband.Â  Pat Beal said her â€œthen six-year-old granddaughter began to complain of pain in her â€˜private area - vaginal painâ€™â€ and that â€œher granddaughter would cry out â€˜No, Daddyâ€™ in her dreams.â€Â  The family took the granddaughter to doctors to investigate â€œpossible molestations,â€ as well as to a lawyer who ultimately contacted the Department of Social Services, according to the article.\r\nIn the article, Pat Beal stated that â€œthe [guardian] assigned to the case did not do a thorough job of interviewing the family and did not even talk to the granddaughterâ€; the guardian prevented an arrangement between the parents in which the mother (Pat Bealâ€™s daughter) would get full custody of the children; the guardian â€œmanipulated the judge into barring [Pat Beal] from contacting her granddaughter without supervisionâ€; and the guardian, in the final divorce decree, â€œhad it written that she [Pat Beal] could have no contact with either of her minor grandchildren.â€Â  Pat Beal further stated in the article that she â€œbecame incensed when a second psychologist said that she had â€˜coachedâ€™ her granddaughter into alleging sexual abuse at the hands of her fatherâ€; that she and her husband had â€œspent $64,000 fighting the decree in court, and were eventually successfulâ€; and that she had joined a court reform movement begun by those who have been through â€œequally harrowing experiences with custody and abuse battles.â€\r\nThe article did not name the guardian who represented Pat Bealâ€™s granddaughter.Â  Appellant testified there were only a handful of private, non-lawyer guardians in Dorchester County at the time.Â  Two local lawyers testified they and others involved in the Dorchester County family court system were familiar with the â€œBeal case,â€ and knew Appellant was the guardian who had worked on it.Â  Furthermore, it apparently is undisputed Appellant was sufficiently identified in the article because Newspaper did not attempt to defend on that ground.[1]\r\nAppellant alleged the teaser, introductory paragraphs, and â€œWhom to Believeâ€ subsection constituted defamation by libel.Â  Appellant alleged and testified the false and defamatory statements included the charge she failed to properly investigate the case or speak with the child she represented, that she improperly blocked and tried to prevent the mother from getting full custody of the children, that she manipulated a family court judge, that she caused a court order to be written preventing Pat Beal from having visitation with her granddaughter, and that she had a sexual relationship with the father of a child she represented. \r\nAppellant presented evidence that the childâ€™s â€œvaginal painâ€ was actually caused by pinworms.Â  Investigations by Appellant, DSS, physicians, and a psychologist revealed no evidence William Litchfield had sexually abused his daughter.Â  Appellant testified she concluded Pat Beal had coached her granddaughter to falsely accuse her father of sexual molestation in order to gain an advantage in the divorce and custody battle.Â  A psychologist reached the same conclusion.Â  Appellant testified the child, unprompted, said she â€œtold the doctor that my daddy did something that he really didnâ€™t.Â  My nana [Pat Beal] told me to because she wanted me to - my nana asked me to tell the doctor that my daddy hurt me and he really didnâ€™t.Â  And my mama and grandpa are afraid weâ€™re going to get in trouble.â€Â  \r\nThe family court judge in the Litchfield divorce decree ordered the parties to deny access or visitation of Pat Beal with the grandchildren until she â€œhas completed a course of counseling which addresses the issues of coaching and interfering with the relationship of these parents and children.â€Â Â  The order, the result of a settlement between the parties, was not appealed and Pat Bealâ€™s visitation rights were restored after she completed the required counseling.\r\nAppellant exemplified something of a Horatio Alger tale.Â  She testified she had a somewhat troubled childhood and adolescence, growing up in New York with an alcoholic father.Â  She left home, dropped out of school at the age of sixteen, and had a failed relationship with a heroin addict.Â  She later met and married and the couple had two children, moving to Charleston after her husband joined the Air Force.Â  Appellantâ€™s husband was killed in a car wreck when she was twenty-five years old.Â  Appellant passed tests of General Educational Development, obtaining her â€œGED.â€Â  She then went to college for eight years while working part-time jobs and taking care of her children, eventually obtaining a bachelorâ€™s degree in sociology.Â  Appellant ultimately obtained a masterâ€™s degree in counseling and, finally, realizing part of her dream, became a licensed professional counselor able to work with children and families. \r\nAppellant had planned to begin her own counseling business in Dorchester County, but Appellant and two lawyers testified her reputation and chance to start a counseling business were ruined by the defamatory newspaper article.Â  No lawyer needing a guardian ad litem or family counselor could take a chance on hiring such a controversial person because it would simply bring too many extraneous issues and problems into a case. \r\nAppellant testified she worked from her home as a guardian ad litem and counselor in divorce and other family-related cases, and she considered her role to be a private, confidential one involving very personal matters.Â  She understood that legislators, family court officials, and others at the time were publicly debating potential changes in the guardian system, but she did not speak out publicly on the topic.\r\nNewspaper defended the case primarily on the grounds the information in the article was true and accurate, i.e., Appellant had not properly investigated the case, had reached erroneous conclusions and recommendations too summarily, and had manipulated the family court.Â  The author of the article, Bill Davis, testified he and Newspaper handled the story carefully and appropriately.Â  Davis testified he tried to contact Appellant before publishing it even though none of his notes contained her telephone number.Â  He did not try to contact attorneys involved in the Beal case.Â  Davis conceded his only source for the â€œWhom to Believeâ€ subsection was a fifteen- to thirty-minute telephone conversation with Pat Beal.Â  Davis admitted he could have obtained the Litchfieldsâ€™ publicly recorded divorce decree, which refuted or at least called some of Pat Bealâ€™s claims into question.[2]Â  In addition, Newspaper contended Appellant was a public figure or public official required to prove constitutional actual malice, which she was unable to do, in order to prevail in the lawsuit. \r\nThe trial initially progressed in the usual manner.Â  It appears that, by the third day, Wednesday, the trial judge expressed concern about the potential length of the trial.[3]Â  Newspaper suggested the evidence initially should be limited to issues of Appellantâ€™s status and whether she had presented sufficient evidence of actual malice to submit the case to the jury.Â  The judge, in turn, suggested the parties agree to bifurcate the case between liability and damages, an idea Appellant initially resisted.Â  By Friday morning, the decision to bifurcate the case apparently had been agreed upon and was understood by the parties, as the judge directed Appellant, â€œI donâ€™t want you to put on any damage witnesses right now.Â  Weâ€™re only talking about liability.â€[4]\r\nOn Friday afternoon, the trial judge explained to the parties he would instruct the jury after Appellant rested her case on liability and the parties presented closing arguments.Â  He would then hear arguments and rule on Newspaperâ€™s directed verdict motion on whether Appellant was a private figure, public figure, or public official while the jury deliberated.Â  The judge subsequently explained to the jury that he had â€œlimited the amount of testimony that you have heard to only questions that involve the issue of liability.â€Â  The jury would be given a special verdict form after hearing closing arguments and instructions on the law.Â  Neither party objected to the procedure.Â  Newspaper did not attempt to offer any witnesses or evidence during the liability phase of the trial.\r\nThe parties and judge discussed the jury charges and special verdict form at length.Â  Both parties made closing arguments to the jury, focusing only on whether the article was false and defamatory, and whether Appellant had shown Newspaper acted negligently or with actual malice.Â  \r\nThe judge instructed the jury it was only to determine the issue of liability, not damages, and charged the jury on the elements of a defamation action.Â  The judge told the jury not to consider the statement regarding a guardian who had a sexual relationship with the father of a child she represented.Â  The judge earlier had ruled that statement did not have a defamatory meaning with regard to Appellant because the article clearly identified another guardian accused of that act.Â  Because he had not yet ruled on the issue of Appellantâ€™s status, the judge charged the jury on both private figure and negligence law, and the concepts of public figure, public official, and constitutional actual malice.Â  The judge explained the special verdict form in detail to the jury.\r\nWhile the jury was out, the judge heard arguments on Newspaperâ€™s directed verdict motion that Appellant was a public figure or public official who must prove Newspaper acted with actual malice, a burden she had failed to meet.Â  The judge did not rule on the motion before the jury returned with its verdict.\r\nThe special verdict form approved by both parties posed four yes/no questions:Â  (1) whether Appellant had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Newspaper published a statement about Appellant that was false; (2) whether Appellant had proven by a preponderance that the false statement about Appellant was defamatory; (3) whether Appellant had proven by a preponderance that Newspaperâ€™s publication of a false and defamatory statement about Appellant was negligent; and (4) whether Appellant had proven by clear and convincing evidence that Newspaper acted with actual malice in publishing a false and defamatory statement about Appellant.[5]Â  The jury answered â€œyesâ€ to all four questions.\r\nThe trial judge told jurors they would have to return the following week to consider evidence of Appellantâ€™s damages, and sent them out to discuss when they would prefer to return.Â  The judge then denied Newspaperâ€™s directed verdict motion, ruling Appellant was a private figure required to prove negligence to recover damages in her defamation action.\r\nAt this point the case took an unusual procedural turn.Â  Newspaper moved for a mistrial because the judge had told jurors they would return only to determine damages, but Newspaper had not yet presented a defense.Â  The judge agreed to correct his â€œmisstatement.â€Â  He called the jurors back in and told them that they would return to hear evidence of Appellantâ€™s damages and Newspaperâ€™s defense.Â  The questions the jury answered in the special verdict form were only â€œadvisory interrogatories.â€ \r\nOn Monday morning, Newspaper restated its objection to the process followed.Â  Counsel stated it had â€œnever crossed my mind, of course, that you would let the case go out to the jury if there was any - if you had anything going on in your mind that I was going to put up a defense. . . . I thought you were sending a clear signal to me that I wasnâ€™t putting up a defense in this case.Â  What else could it be to send the jury out before I put up a defense?â€Â  Newspaper believed the judge planned to dismiss the case on its directed verdict motion even if the jury returned with all â€œyesâ€ answers.Â  The jury was tainted in Appellantâ€™s favor by already discussing the merits of the case and ruling on â€œadvisory interrogatories.â€ \r\nAfter much discussion, the judge instructed the jury the â€œspecial interrogatoriesâ€ it had answered â€œare not binding upon you during the remainder of the trial.â€Â  Appellant would present evidence of damages and Newspaper would present its defense.Â  The case would be submitted anew to the jury, which would not be bound by its earlier answers in the special verdict form. \r\nAccordingly, Appellant presented evidence of damages to her reputation, emotional distress and accompanying physical problems, and loss of the opportunity to start her own counseling business, then rested her case.Â  Newspaper renewed its directed verdict motion on Appellantâ€™s status, which was denied.\r\nNewspaper presented its defense, recalling the reporter (who already had testified in Appellantâ€™s case), Appellant, and the psychologist mentioned by Pat Beal in the article.Â  Newspaper questioned Appellant about Karen Winner, the author of the â€œWinner reportâ€ which discussed the actions of private guardians in several family court cases.Â  Appellant testified she had separately sued Winner and several other persons for defamation.Â  Appellant testified she asked another guardian ad litem (Marilyn Lassiter, who was named and accused of wrongdoing in the same article) to attend a publicly advertised meeting and secretly tape-record it because she had been told â€œthat a group had been formed to ruin me [and] to try to put me in jail.â€Â  Appellant also had listened to audiotapes secretly made by two other friends who had attended the groupâ€™s meetings.Â  Newspaper questioned Appellant about three private letters she wrote in 1999 regarding the guardian reform controversy and questions about her education and training to two Governorâ€™s Office officials.Â  \r\nNewspaper renewed its directed verdict motion on Appellantâ€™s status and the judge heard additional arguments.Â  Reversing his earlier decision, the judge ruled Appellant was a limited public figure who had not presented clear and convincing evidence to prove Newspaper acted with actual malice.Â  Therefore, the judge granted Newspaperâ€™s directed verdict motion.Â  The case was not resubmitted to the jury.\r\nNewspaperâ€™s motions to dismiss Appellantâ€™s claims for negligence and invasion of privacy had been previously granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, after a pretrial hearing by another circuit judge. Â Appellant appealed the rulings of both judges.Â  This appeal was certified to the Court on motion of the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\nSCACR.&nbsp; \r\nAppellant raises numerous issues.Â  We find it necessary to discuss only three issues and we affirm the remaining issues pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the trial judge err in ruling that Appellant, a private guardian ad litem appointed to represent the childrenâ€™s interests in a divorce and child custody dispute, was a limited public figure who must prove constitutional actual malice in order to recover damages in a defamation action?\r\nII.Â  Does sufficient evidence support the juryâ€™s finding of constitutional actual malice such that Appellant, if she is determined to be a private figure, is entitled to recover punitive damages from Newspaper?\r\nIII.Â  Did Newspaper agree to bifurcation of the trial on liability and damages, consequently waiving the right to object to bifurcation or its decision not to present evidence during the liability phase of the trial?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court must view the evidence and the inferences which reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  The trial court must deny the motion when either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Strange v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994).Â  When considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Creech v. S.C. Wildlife and Marine Resources Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997).Â  The appellate court must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.Â  Bultman v. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 7, 281 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1981).Â  If the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury.Â  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998).\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for summary judgment or directed verdict in a defamation action, the court must review the evidence using the same substantive evidentiary standard of proof the jury is required to use in a particular case.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 451-54, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874-75 (2001).Â  An appellate court reviews the granting of such a motion using the same standard.Â  Id.\r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of the appellate court extends merely to the correction of errors of law, and a factual finding by the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence which reasonably supports the juryâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assoc, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  APPELLANTâ€™S STATUS AS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL, PUBLIC FIGURE, OR PRIVATE FIGURE\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in granting Newspaperâ€™s directed verdict motion that Appellant, a private guardian ad litem appointed to represent the childrenâ€™s interests in a divorce and child custody dispute, was a limited public figure who must prove constitutional actual malice in order to recover damages.Â  Prior to publication of the article, Appellant was not famous, had no special access to the media, never sought the publicâ€™s attention, did not thrust herself voluntarily into a public controversy, and did not assume any special prominence in the resolution of an issue of public concern.Â  While the debate about potential reform of the guardian system was a public controversy, Appellant contends she was a private figure who must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Newspaper acted negligently in publishing false and defamatory statements about her in order to recover damages.Â  We agree in part.\r\nThe tort of defamation allows a plaintiff to recover for injury to his or her reputation as the result of the defendantâ€™s communications to others of a false message about the plaintiff.Â  Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 508, 506 S.E.2d 497, 501 (1998) (Holtzscheiter II).Â  Defamatory communications take two forms:Â  libel and slander.Â  Slander is a spoken defamation while libel is a written defamation or one accomplished by actions or conduct.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn order to prove defamation, the plaintiff must show (1) a false and defamatory statement was made; (2) the unprivileged publication was made to a third party; (3) the publisher was at fault; and (4) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 494, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002); Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 506, 506 S.E.2d at 518 (Toal, J., concurring).\r\nA defamation action is analyzed primarily under the common law in cases in which the plaintiff is a private figure.Â  A statement is classified as defamatory per se when the meaning or message is obvious on its face.Â  A statement is classified as defamatory per quod when the defamatory meaning is not clear unless the hearer knows facts or circumstances not contained in the statement itself, and the plaintiff must introduce extrinsic facts to prove the defamatory meaning.Â  Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 508-09, 506 S.E.2d at 501.Â  In addition to those classifications, a statement may be actionable per se, in which case the defendant is presumed to have acted with common law malice and the plaintiff is presumed to have suffered general damages.Â  Or a statement may be not actionable per se, in which case nothing is presumed and the plaintiff must plead and prove both common law malice and special damages.Â  The determination of whether or not a statement is actionable per se is a matter of law for the court to resolve.Â  Id. at 509-10, 506 S.E.2d at 501-02.[6]  \r\nUnder the common law, â€œ[l]ibel is actionable per se if it involves written or printed words which tend to degrade a person, that is, to reduce his character or reputation in the estimation of his friends or acquaintances, or the public, or to disgrace him, or to render him odious, contemptible, or ridiculous.â€Â  Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 510-11, 506 S.E.2d at 502.Â  Essentially, all libel is actionable per se, while only certain categories of slander are actionable per se.[7]Â  Id. Â Common law malice means the defendant acted with ill will toward the plaintiff, or acted recklessly or wantonly, i.e., with conscious indifference of the plaintiffâ€™s rights.Â  Padgett v. Sun News, 278 S.C. 26, 32, 292 S.E.2d 30, 34 (1982).\r\nThere are three important caveats with regard to private-figure plaintiffs, resulting from the need to balance First Amendment rights with the right of individuals to be compensated for damage caused by defamatory statements.Â  First, in a case involving an issue of public controversy or concern where the libelous statement is published by a media defendant, the common law presumptions the defendant acted with common law malice and the plaintiff suffered general damages do not apply.Â  Instead, the private-figure plaintiff must plead and prove common law malice and show â€œactual injuryâ€ in the form of general or special damages. Â Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 346-50, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3010-12, 41 L.Ed.2d 789, 809-11 (1974); Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 512, 506 S.E.2d at 503 (plurality opinion); Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 519-20, 506 S.E.2d at 506-07 (Toal, J., concurring).Â  Second, in a case involving an issue of public controversy or concern where the libelous statement is published by a media defendant, the common law presumption that the libelous statement is false is not applied.Â  Instead, the private-figure plaintiff must prove the statement is false.Â  Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767, 775-79, 106 S.Ct. 1558, 1563-65, 89 L.Ed.2d 783, 791-94 (1986); Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 512, 506 S.E.2d at 503; Parker v. Evening Post Pub. Co., 317 S.C. 236, 243, 452 S.E.2d 640, 644 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Third, in order to recover punitive damages from a media defendant, a private-figure plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with constitutional actual malice, i.e., the defendant published the statement with knowledge it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.Â  Gertz, 418 U.S. at 346-50, 94 S.Ct. at 3010-12, 41 L.Ed.2d at 809-11; Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 512, 506 S.E.2d at 503. \r\nConcepts of common law defamation have been significantly modified since the 1960s by the First Amendment jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court.Â  See Holtzscheiter II 332 S.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d 497 (plurality and concurring opinions discussing impact of First Amendment-based principles).Â  â€œCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. I.Â  Since New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), federal and state courts have â€œsought to define the accommodation required to assure the vigorous debate on public issues that the First Amendment was designed to protect while at the same time affording protection to the reputations of individuals.â€Â \r\nHutchinson v. Proxmire, 443 U.S. 111, 133-34, 99 S.Ct. 2675, 2687, 61 L.Ed.2d 411, 430 (1979).\r\nâ€œ[T]here is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.Â  Neither the intentional lie nor the careless error materially advances societyâ€™s interest in uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate on public issues.â€Â  Gertz, 418 U.S. at 340, 94 S.Ct. at 3007, 41 L.Ed.2d at 805.Â  Errors, however, are inevitable.Â  â€œ[P]unishment of error runs the risk of inducing a cautious and restrictive exercise of the constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech and press.Â  Our decisions recognize that a rule of strict liability that compels a publisher or broadcaster to guarantee the accuracy of his factual assertions may lead to intolerable self-censorship.â€Â  Id.\r\nConsequently, to prove fault in a defamation action, a plaintiff who is a public official or public figure must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with actual malice in publishing a false and defamatory statement about the plaintiff.Â  New York Times, 376 U.S. at 279-80, 84 S.Ct. at 726, 11 L.Ed.2d at 706; Time, Inc. v. Firestone, 424 U.S. 448, 453-55, 95 S.Ct. 958, 964-66, 47 L.Ed.2d 154, 162-63 (1976); Curtis v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 162-65, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 1995-96, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094, 1115-17 (1967) (Warren, Ch.

New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U.S. 496, 510, 111 S.Ct. 2419, 2429, 115 L.Ed.2d 447, 468 (1991).\r\nThus, an important initial step in analyzing any defamation case is determining whether a particular plaintiff is a public official, public figure, or private figure.[8]Â  This determination is a matter of law which must be decided by the court, on a case by case basis after a careful examination of the facts and circumstances, before the jury is charged on the law or asked to resolve a case.Â  This ruling is needed in order for the court to determine whether to instruct the jury on law applicable to private-figure or public-figure and public-official plaintiffs.[9]Â  See Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U.S. 75, 87, 86 S.Ct. 669, 677, 15 L.Ed.2d 597, 606 (1966) (trial judge generally has duty of in first instance to determine whether allegedly libeled party is a public official); Foretich v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 37 F.3d 1541, 1551 (4th Cir. 1994) (question of whether defamation plaintiff is a limited-purpose public figure is an issue of law for the court); Mead Corp. v. Hicks, 448 So.2d 308, 310 (Ala. 1983) (stating same principle); Tracey A. Bateman, Who is â€œPublic Figureâ€ for Purposes of Defamation Action, 19 A.L.R.5th 1, 57 (1994) (stating same principle); cf. Sanders v. Prince, 304 S.C. 236, 403 S.E.2d 640 (1991) (directing trial judge to charge only constitutional actual malice principles in retrial of case involving public official, and forbidding charge on inapplicable principles of common law malice).Â  \r\nA.Â  PUBLIC OFFICIAL\r\nNeither the Supreme Court nor this Court has provided a precise or all-encompassing definition of â€œpublic official,â€ although it is clear the category does not include all public employees.Â  See Hutchinson, 443 U.S. at 119 n.8, 99 S.Ct. at 2680 n.8, 61 L.Ed.2d at 421 n.8.Â  In general, a public official is a person who, among the hierarchy of government employees, has or appears to the public to have â€œsubstantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs.â€Â  Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 520 n.4, 506 S.E.2d at 507 n.4 (Toal, J., concurring) (quoting Rosenblatt, 383 U.S. at 85, 86 S.Ct. at 676, 15 L.Ed.2d at 605).Â  â€œIn considering the question of whether one is a public official, the employeeâ€™s position must be one which would invite public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding it, entirely apart from the scrutiny and discussion occasioned by the particular charges in controversy.â€Â  Id. (quoting Rosenblatt) (internal quotes omitted).Â  â€œThe status of a public official may be deemed sufficient to warrant application of the New York Times privilege, not because of the government employeeâ€™s place on the totem pole, but because of the public interest in a government employeeâ€™s activity in a particular context.â€Â  McClain v. Arnold, 275 S.C. 282, 284, 270 S.E.2d 124, 125 (1980) (holding that police officer wrongly identified in lawsuit as officer who falsely arrested plaintiff while working as agent of grocery store was a public official required to prove newspaper acted with actual malice); see also Miller v. City of West Columbia, 322 S.C. 224, 471 S.E.2d 683 (1996) (treating assistant police chief as public official for purposes of defamation action); Goodwin v. Kennedy, 347 S.C. 30, 43-45, 552 S.E.2d 319, 326-27 (Ct. App. 2001) (concluding assistant school principal was not public official under circumstances of case).\r\nThe parties have not cited, nor have we found, any authority directly addressing whether a private guardian ad litem in a family court case is a public official.Â  Newspaper relies on Press, Inc. v. Verran, 569 S.W.2d 435 (Tenn. 1978), Villarreal v. Harte-Hanks Commun., Inc., 787 S.W.2d 131 (Tex. App. 1990), and Kahn v. Bower, 284 Cal. Rptr. 244 (Cal. App. 1 Dist. 1991).Â  Those cases are distinguishable from the case sub judice.Â  The plaintiffs in those cases were found to be public officials because they were employees of state social service agencies who had the authority to investigate allegations of child abuse, decide which version of events to believe, and take actions such as removing a child from a home.Â  In contrast, Appellant is a guardian who investigates a case on behalf of the family court and makes recommendations when asked, but has no unilateral authority to resolve care or custody issues.Â  See Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 287, 555 S.E.2d 386, 389 (2001) (â€œGAL functions as a representative of the court, appointed to assist the court in making its determination of custody by advocating for the best interest of the children and providing the court with an objective viewâ€; Court set forth base-line standards on duties and responsibilities of a GAL); Fleming v. Asbill, 326 S.C. 49, 53, 483 S.E.2d 751, 753-54 (1997) (private guardian ad litem is not an agent or employee of the State, but functions as a representative of the court to assist the court in properly protecting the interests of an incompetent person; guardian does not create or resolve legal relationships between the court and third parties); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1545 to -1557 (Supp. 2005) (South Carolina Private Guardian Ad Litem Reform Act, enacted in 2002 and establishing duties and responsibilities of guardian).\r\nNewspaper further urges us to find Appellant is a public official because a private guardian ad litem generally enjoys immunity from lawsuits.Â  See Fleming, 326 S.C. at 54-58, 483 S.E.2d at 754-56 (private persons appointed as guardians ad litem in private custody proceedings are afforded absolute quasi-judicial immunity for acts performed within scope of their appointment). Â Newspaper argues that a private guardian should be deemed a public official because, given that a person affected by the guardianâ€™s allegedly offensive or wrongful statements or actions likely is prohibited from suing the guardian, then the wronged person is left without a remedy.Â  He will not only be unable to sue but also forced to stand silent, prevented from criticizing or opposing the guardian for fear of prompting a defamation suit brought by a guardian who enjoys the less rigorous standard of proof afforded private-figure plaintiffs.\r\nImmunity to suit is an appropriate factor to consider in analyzing whether a particular individual is a public official for purposes of a defamation action, and immunity may lend support to reaching such a conclusion in an appropriate case.Â  However, no one factor is dispositive in the analysis and Newspaperâ€™s argument is not persuasive in the present case.Â  It is not necessary to take the unwarranted step of designating a private guardian ad litem as a public official to enable litigants or persons who believe they have been wronged sufficient latitude to criticize or oppose the guardianâ€™s statements or conclusions.Â  The law of defamation does not prevent a person from expressing and publishing truthful or non-defamatory statements - including pointed criticisms - of a guardianâ€™s actions in a particular case, regardless of whether the guardian is designated a public official, public figure, or private figure.Â  Furthermore, as we explained in Fleming, other safeguards exist to control a wayward guardian.Â  Such safeguards include the fact a guardian is not immune from suit for actions beyond the scope of her duty; the fact an opponent may cross-examine the guardian and supporting witnesses at a deposition and at trial, as well as present his own evidence in opposition; and the review and oversight powers which both trial and appellate courts wield over a guardian.Â  Fleming, 326 S.C. at 56-57, 483 S.E.2d at 755-56. Â \r\nAccordingly, we conclude Appellant, a private guardian ad litem who represented children in a divorce and child custody dispute, is not a public official.Â  Appellant is not a government employee, much less an official who has or would appear to the public to have substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of government affairs.Â  The position of a private guardian ad litem is not one which invites public scrutiny and discussion of the person holding it, entirely apart from the scrutiny and discussion occasioned by the particular charges in controversy.\r\nB.Â  PUBLIC FIGURE\r\nThe United States Supreme Court generally has defined a public figure as follows:Â  â€œFor the most part those who attain this status [of public figure] have assumed roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society.Â  Some occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all purposes.Â  More commonly, those classed as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.Â  In either event, they invite attention and comment.â€Â  Gertz, 418 U.S. at 345, 94 S.Ct. at 3009, 41 L.Ed.2d at 808 (an attorney was not a public figure even though he voluntarily exposed himself in a case certain to receive extensive media exposure); Time, 424 U.S. 448, 452-55, 95 S.Ct. at 964-66, 47 L.Ed.2d at 161-63 (New York Times actual malice standard did not apply to wife of wealthy industrialist allegedly defamed by media defendant in high-profile divorce case because she was not a public figure); Â George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001) (plaintiff candidateâ€™s engineering firm was a limited public figure under Gertz test in defamation action arising from statements made during political campaign); Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 523 n.8, 506 S.E.2d at 508 n.8 (1998) (Toal, J., concurring and discussing Gertz) \r\nA limited public figure, the type more commonly found, is an individual who â€œvoluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues.Â  In either case such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public questions.â€Â  Gertz, 418 U.S. at 351, 94 S.Ct. at 3013, 41 L.Ed.2d at 812.Â  In determining whether a claimant is a private or public figure, the court must focus on the â€œnature and extent of an individualâ€™s participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.â€Â  Gertz, 418 U.S. at 352, 94 S.Ct. at 3013, 41 L.Ed.2d at 812; Wolston v. Readerâ€™s Digest Assn., Inc., 443 U.S. 157, 167, 99 S.Ct. 2701, 2707, 61 L.Ed.2d 450, 460 (1979); Parker v. Evening Post Pub. Co., 317 S.C. 236, 243 n.3, 452 S.E.2d 640, 644 n.3 (Ct. App. 1994) (automobile dealer invited publicâ€™s attention through extensive media advertising and, as to statements regarding his dealership, was a public figure).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court identified a third category of involuntary public figures who become public figures through no purposeful action of their own.Â  However, â€œthe instances of truly involuntary public figures must be exceedingly rare.â€Â  Gertz, 418 U.S. at 345, 94 S.Ct. at 3009, 41 L.Ed.2d at 808.\r\nAll three types of public figures, just as public officials, must meet the New York Times standard of actual malice in order to recover damages for defamation.Â  Public figures and public officials are entitled to less protection from defamation than private figures because they enjoy greater media access and are less vulnerable to injury from defamatory statements due to their ability to publicly rebut such statements.Â  Furthermore, both public figures and public officials are less deserving of protection because they have voluntarily exposed themselves to the increased risk of defamation.Â  Foretich, 37 F.3d at 1552 (discussing Gertz).\r\nThe court must focus on facts and circumstances relating to the claimantâ€™s status at the time the issue of public concern or controversy arose.Â  â€œA private individual is not automatically transformed into a public figure just by becoming involved in or associated with a matter that attracts public attention.â€Â  Wolston, 443 U.S. at 167, 99 S.Ct. at 2707, 61 L.Ed.2d at 460.Â  â€œ[T]hose charged with defamation cannot, by their own conduct, create their own defense by making the claimant a public figure.â€Â  Hutchinson, 443 U.S. at 134-135, 99 S.Ct. at 2687-88, 61 L.Ed.2d at 430-32 (focusing on whether plaintiff research professor was a public figure prior to controversy engendered by senatorâ€™s awarding of â€œGolden Fleeceâ€ to claimantâ€™s research project).Â  A defendant may not transform a private figure into a limited public figure by dragging an unwilling participant into the spotlight of a public controversy through the defendantâ€™s own words or actions.Â  Wolston, 443 U.S. at 166, 443 U.S. 157, 167, 99 S.Ct. at 2706-07, 61 L.Ed.2d at 459-60 (claimant, by refusing to comply with grand jury subpoena in espionage case, did not voluntarily thrust himself into the public controversy; â€œIt would be more accurate to say that petitioner was dragged unwillingly into the controversy.â€).Â  These principles do not, of course, mean a private figure may never become a limited public figure; such a transformation may occur by virtue of a private figureâ€™s own actions or words during the course of a public controversy.\r\nAppellant does not fall into the first category of public figure.Â  Appellant did not occupy a position of such persuasive power and influence that she is a public figure for all purposes.Â  It is equally obvious that hers is not one of the exceedingly rare cases in which Appellant somehow became an involuntary public figure through no purposeful action of her own.\r\nWe agree with the analysis set forth by the Fourth Circuit in Foretich, 37 F.3d 1541, to determine whether Appellant is a limited public figure which, as we previously noted, is a matter of law for the court to decide before submitting a case to a jury.Â  In order for the court to properly hold that a plaintiff is a public figure for the limited purpose of comment on a particular public controversy, the defendant must show: (1) the plaintiff had access to channels of effective communication; (2) the plaintiff voluntarily assumed a role of special prominence in the public controversy; (3) the plaintiff sought to influence the resolution or outcome of the controversy; (4) the controversy existed prior to the publication of the defamatory statement; and (5) the plaintiff retained public-figure status at the time of the alleged defamation.Â  Foretich, 37 F.3d at 1553.\r\nIn the present case, Appellant had no more access to channels of effective communication, such as the media, than any ordinary, private person.Â  Appellant did not voluntarily assume a role of special prominence in the controversy over reforming the guardian system, and she did not seek to influence the outcome of that controversy.Â  In fact, the record shows Appellant tried to avoid the spotlight and the controversy.Â  The private letters Appellant wrote to the Governorâ€™s Office were intended to correct misinformation about her alleged lack of education and training, and to express concern over false accusations made by people upset about particular family court cases.Â  The public meetings which Appellantâ€™s friends secretly tape-recorded for her do not constitute attempts to thrust herself into the controversy.Â  Appellant simply was trying to learn what admittedly angry participants in a divorce and custody dispute were saying about her.Â  The public controversy regarding the guardian system existed before Newspaper published the article.Â  But neither the person who made the statements (Pat Beal) nor the publisher (Newspaper) may, by their own words and actions, transform Appellant into a limited public figure by dragging her unwillingly into the controversy over reform of the guardian system.\r\nThe trial judge erred in ruling Appellant is a limited public figure.Â  Appellant, under the facts and circumstances of this case, is a private-figure plaintiff as a matter of law.Â  As such, she is entitled to recover under the common law defamation principles set forth above.Â  \r\nStatements regarding Appellantâ€™s lack of investigation and manipulation of a judge were in the form of libel per se and were actionable per se; the statements regarding Appellantâ€™s attempts to prevent the mother from getting full custody and blocking the grandmotherâ€™s visitation rights constituted libel per quod and also were actionable per se.Â  The statements were published by a media defendant on an issue of public controversy or concern, i.e., reforms purportedly needed in the private guardian ad litem system.Â  Consequently, even though she is a private figure, Appellant may not benefit from any of the common law presumptions.Â  Appellant is required to plead and prove common law malice, demonstrate the falsity of the statements, and show actual injury in the form of general or special damages.Â  Appellant bears the burden of proving her case by a preponderance of the evidence. \r\nIn this case, the judge charged the jury that a private-figure plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Newspaper acted negligently in publishing a false and defamatory statement.Â  No party objected to this charge and it was, in fact, the charge the parties requested and desired.Â  Chief Justice Toal in Holtzscheiter II suggested we join the majority of jurisdictions which have adopted a negligence standard for private-figure plaintiffs.Â  Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 523, 506 S.E.2d at 508-9.[10]Â  However, the plurality of the Court in Holtzscheiter II chose to retain common law malice and accompanying presumptions in private-figure actions.Â  We do not revisit the issue in this case because no party objected to use of the negligence standard; therefore, it is the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance); Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 177 S.E.2d 544 (1970) (same).Â  Moreover, a party may not complain on appeal of error or object to a trial procedure which his own conduct has induced.Â  E.g. Shearer v. DeShon, 240 S.C. 472, 484, 126 S.E.2d 514, 520 (1962); Floyd v. Thornton, 220 S.C. 414, 425-26, 68 S.E.2d 334, 339 (1951).\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the trial judgeâ€™s grant of a directed verdict to Newspaper on the issues of Appellantâ€™s status and liability for defamation.Â  We conclude as a matter of law Appellant, under the facts and circumstances of this case, is a private-figure plaintiff.Â  Appellant, as shown by the special verdict form, proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the statements were false and defamatory.Â  The jury found Newspaper liable for defamation pursuant to instructions which were grounded in negligence and which were agreed upon by the parties.Â  Therefore, Appellant is entitled upon remand to seek actual damages, i.e., general and special damages.\r\nII.Â  CONSTITUTIONAL ACTUAL MALICE\r\nThe jury in its special verdict form determined Appellant had proven by clear and convincing evidence Newspaper acted with constitutional actual malice, i.e., Newspaper published the statement with knowledge it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.Â  This finding is relevant in Appellantâ€™s case because, as a private figure, she is entitled to recover punitive damages from a media defendant only if she proves actual malice.Â  See Gertz, 418 U.S. at 346-50, 94 S.Ct. at 3010-12, 41 L.Ed.2d at 809-11; Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 512, 506 S.E.2d at 503.Â  Newspaper argues the record does not support a finding of actual malice.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhether evidence is sufficient to support a juryâ€™s finding of constitutional actual malice in a defamation action is a question of law.Â  The trial court must make such a determination before submitting the issue to a jury.Â  When the jury makes such a finding, the appellate court must independently examine the record to determine whether the evidence sufficiently supports a finding of actual malice.Â  Elder v. Gaffney Ledger, 341 S.C. 108, 113, 533 S.E.2d 899, 901-02 (2000) (citing Harte-Hanks Commun., Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 685-86, 109 S.Ct. 2678, 2694-95, 105 L.Ed.2d 562, 587 (1989).Â  This review is necessary due to the â€œunique character of the interest protected by the actual malice standard.Â  Our profound national commitment to the free exchange of ideas, as enshrined in the First Amendment, demands that the law of libel carve out an area of â€˜breathing spaceâ€™ so that protected speech is not discouraged.â€Â  Harte-Hanks Commun., 491 U.S. at 686, 109 S.Ct. at 2695, 105 L.Ed.2d at 587; accord George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 456-57, 548 S.E.2d 868, 876 (2001).\r\nAs we explained in Elder, \r\n\r\nActual malice is a subjective standard testing the publisherâ€™s good faith belief in the truth of his or her statements. Â The constitutional actual malice standard requires a public official to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defamatory falsehood was made with the knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for its truth.Â  A â€œreckless disregardâ€ for the truth, however, requires more than a departure from reasonably prudent conduct.Â  There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.Â  There must be evidence the defendant had a high degree of awareness of . . . probable falsity.\r\nFailure to investigate before publishing, even when a reasonably prudent person would have done so, is not sufficient to establish reckless disregard.Â \r\nActual malice may be present, however, where one fails to investigate and there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant.\r\n\r\nElder, 341 S.C. at 114, 533 S.E.2d at 902 (citations, quotes, and emphasis omitted).Â  â€œA subjective awareness of probable falsity can be shown if there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or accuracy of his report.â€Â  Anderson v. Augusta Chronicle, 365 S.C. 589, 596, 619 S.E.2d 428, 432 (2005) (citing Harte-Hanks Commun., 491 U.S. at 688, 109 S.Ct. at 2696, 105 L.Ed.2d at 589).Â  â€œThe right of a free press is not absolute in a society that demands social responsibility and personal integrity. . . . Â In the interests of justice, we will not allow a publication to go so unchecked as to promote the tyrannical imposition of false and misleading information - the very concern our forefathers sought to eliminate in demanding the press be free.â€Â  Anderson , 365 S.C. at 599-600, 619 S.E.2d at 433 (Burnett, J., concurring).\r\nIn the present case, Newspaper published allegations in a front-page story about a private figure which, on their face, appear potentially devastating to the reputation of a private guardian ad litem.Â  Evidence supporting the juryâ€™s finding of actual malice includes (1) the fact that the portion of the article pertaining to Appellant was based solely on a fifteen- to thirty-minute telephone conversation with Pat Beal, an admittedly â€œincensedâ€ person; (2) the fact Newspaper purportedly failed to even try to contact Appellant to discuss the matter with her; (3) the fact Newspaper failed to contact attorneys or others involved in the Litchfield case; and (4) the fact Newspaper failed to even try to obtain the publicly recorded divorce decree in the Litchfield case, a reading of which would have called into question or refuted Pat Bealâ€™s allegations.Â  This evidence does not indicate merely a failure to investigate which, standing alone, would be insufficient to uphold a finding of actual malice.Â  This evidence constitutes a failure to investigate before publishing an article when there were obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of Pat Beal or the accuracy of her report.Â  Thus, the evidence indicates Newspaperâ€™s subjective awareness of probable falsity of the report and is sufficient to support the juryâ€™s finding of actual malice.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the juryâ€™s finding of actual malice and remand this case for a jury to consider the issue of punitive damages.\r\nIII.Â  NEWSPAPERâ€™S WAIVER OF OBJECTION TO BIFURCATIONÂ Â Â  \r\nA jury has not yet determined whether Appellant is owed any money damages in this matter.Â  In reversing the trial judgeâ€™s grant of a directed verdict to Newspaper on the issues of Appellantâ€™s status and liability, and remanding for a jury to determine whether to award damages, we must necessarily address whether the juryâ€™s verdict on liability must stand or whether this case should be remanded for a new trial absolute.\r\nAppellant asserts the trial judge plainly bifurcated the case on liability and damages.Â  After doing so, the judge was without authority to subsequently reopen the liability issue or disturb the juryâ€™s verdict on liability by treating it as a response to â€œadvisory interrogatoriesâ€ which could be ignored in reaching a new verdict addressing both liability and damages.Â  Newspaper made a â€œcalculated tactical decisionâ€ in declining to present a defense during the liability phase.Â  Appellant argues Newspaper acquiesced to the procedure followed because Newspaper anticipated tired jurors would quickly return a defense verdict.[11]\r\nNewspaper, at trial, in its brief, and at oral argument before us freely admitted it fully expected the judge to rule in Newspaperâ€™s favor on the directed verdict motion regardless of any verdict returned by the jury.Â  In its brief, Newspaper states it â€œconsented to the procedure advocated by the trial judge because there was more than enough evidence in the record at the time to ensure a directed verdict.Â  By sending the jury out to deliberate, counsel assumed, incorrectly, that the trial judge did not want [jurors] to spend a week of their lives in the jury box for nothing.Â  The belief that the trial judge would not send a jury out to deliberate before hearing all the evidence led the [Newspaperâ€™s] attorney to assume he would not be offering a defense to a deliberating jury.Â  A granting of [Newspaperâ€™s] motion for directed verdict was thus perfunctory.â€Â  (Emphasis in original.)Â  Newspaper asserts the procedure followed, while unusual, was acceptable and â€œ[t]here was no harm suffered by Appellant due to the procedure.â€\r\nThe resolution of factual issues may be submitted to an advisory jury in a case arising in equity.Â  See Momeier v. McAlister, Inc., 190 S.C. 529, 538-39, 3 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1939) (judge in equity case has the right and power to refer issues to a jury for the enlightenment of his conscience and is not bound to accept juryâ€™s findings or verdict); First State Sav. and Loan Assn. v. Nodine, 291 S.C. 445, 448, 354 S.E.2d 51, 52-53 (Ct. App. 1987) (same); Neal v. Darby, 282 S.C. 277, 283, 318 S.E.2d 18, 22 (Ct. App. 1984) (same); Rule 39(c), SCRCP (providing for advisory jury in all actions not triable of right by a jury); Rule 52(a), SCRCP (requiring court to state findings of fact and conclusions of law in case tried with advisory jury).\r\nThe instant case in which Appellant seeks money damages for defamation arises in law, not in equity.Â  See Cooper v. Poston, 326 S.C. 46, 483 S.E.2d 750 (1997) (parties in legal action for recovery of money damages are constitutionally entitled to a jury trial).Â  It is improper in a law case to submit factual issues to a jury in the form of non-binding â€œadvisory interrogatories.â€Â  A juryâ€™s resolution of factual issues in a law case is binding on trial and appellate courts.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  Moreover, it is improper in any case - arising in either law or equity - to ask jurors to resolve factual issues and then, after hearing additional evidence, reconsider the same issues and render another verdict.Â  In this case, the deliberations and decision of the jury would have been irrevocably tainted if, after it had discussed the case and rendered a verdict in favor of Appellant on the issue of liability, it was asked to ignore the earlier verdict and reconsider the issue of liability.Â  Therefore, the trial judge erred to the extent he attempted, at Newspaperâ€™s insistence, to transform the juryâ€™s verdict on liability into â€œadvisory interrogatoriesâ€ which could be reconsidered in a subsequent verdict addressing both liability and damages.Â  We do not condone this unusual trial procedure.\r\nThe trial judge plainly bifurcated the case on liability and damages with the consent of both parties.Â  That is the procedure the parties discussed and the ruling the judge made, as shown by facts discussed above.Â  The parties participated in the preparation of a special verdict form on liability, made closing arguments on liability, the judge instructed the jury and stated it was to consider only the liability issue and not damages, and the issues of liability were presented to the jury in the special verdict form.Â  Contrary to Newspaperâ€™s argument, the record contains no indication the trial judge initially submitted the case to jurors simply to allow them to participate fruitlessly in the trial process because they had spent more than a week listening to testimony and evidence.\r\nFurther, Newspaper chose, whether for tactical or other reasons, to acquiesce to bifurcation and not present a defense during the liability phase.Â  Newspaper waived any objection it may have to bifurcation of the case, as well as its decision not to present evidence during the liability phase.Â  See e.g. Charleston Lumber Co., 338 S.C. at 175, 525 S.E.2d at 871 (unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance).Â  It would be patently inappropriate and unfair to Appellant, as well as a violation of well-established preservation of error principles and notions of judicial economy, to give Newspaper a second chance under these circumstances to present its evidence regarding liability to a different jury in a new trial absolute.Â  See e.g. Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (preservation of error rules â€œprevent[] a party from keeping an ace card up his sleeve - intentionally or by chance - in the hope that an appellate court will accept that ace card and, via a reversal, give him another opportunity to prove his caseâ€); Shearer, 240 S.C. at 484, 126 S.E.2d at 520 (party may not complain on appeal of error or object to trial procedure which his own conduct has induced). \r\nIn sum, we conclude the case was bifurcated on liability and damages, and Newspaper waived any objection it may have to bifurcation and its decision not to present evidence during the liability phase.Â  Therefore, we reinstate the juryâ€™s liability verdict and remand this case for a jury to consider the issues of actual and punitive damages.\r\nIV.Â  REMAINING ISSUES\r\nFirst, Appellant contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Newspaper on her cause of action for invasion of privacy pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We affirm the dismissal of that action because we find it unnecessary to address it given our disposition of other issues raised in this appeal.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive); Rule 220(c), SCACR (appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record).\r\nIn doing so, however, we do not intend to unwittingly limit evidence Appellant may present about her damages.Â  The types of damages awarded in defamation and invasion of privacy actions often overlap.Â  Viewed in general terms and not necessarily in the context of this case, a person may suffer emotional distress for two simultaneous reasons - the ruining of his reputation by a libelous statement and the wrongful publicizing of a private matter.Â  See Snakenberg v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 299 S.C. 164, 170-71, 383 S.E.2d 2, 5-6 (Ct. App. 1989) (identifying three causes of action which may arise under rubric of invasion of privacy:Â  wrongful appropriation of personality, wrongful publicizing of private affairs, and wrongful intrusion into private affairs); Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 422, 483 S.E.2d 477, 484 (Ct. App. 1997) (noting no South Carolina case has recognized a â€œfalse lightâ€ invasion of privacy claim).Â  Similarly, a private figure who is defamed may feel that the veil of relative privacy most people enjoy has been shredded, wrongfully and unfairly exposing his actions, work, or life to the world.Â  A private figure such as Appellant who proves she has been defamed is not barred from asserting damages rooted in the loss of her privacy simply because they are raised in a defamation action and not in an invasion of privacy action.Â  \r\nSecond, Appellant contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Newspaper on her cause of action for negligence pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We affirm the ruling of the circuit court.Â  A claim that a statement constitutes libel or slander must be brought in a defamation cause of action, which is grounded in and affected by both common and constitutional law.Â  Again, in affirming the dismissal of the negligence action, we do not intend to limit evidence Appellant may present about her damages.Â  This defamation case was brought, argued, charged, and resolved in part on a negligence theory; therefore, the types of damages generally available to a plaintiff who proves negligence are available to Appellant.\r\nThird, Appellant contends the trial judge erred in granting a partial directed verdict on her allegation that the article may be read to say that Appellant was the guardian who had an illicit relationship with the father of the child she had been appointed to represent, a child who allegedly had been sexually molested by the father.Â  Appellant asserts a reader may reasonably link the promotional teaser in the table of contents and introductory paragraph - both of which mentioned a guardian who had slept with a represented childâ€™s father - to Appellant.Â  Appellant further notes two lawyers testified they understood the article to state she had slept with a represented childâ€™s father.Â  We disagree with Appellant and affirm this ruling of the trial judge.\r\nâ€œ[T]he intent and meaning of an alleged defamatory statement must be gathered not only from the words singled out as libelous, but from the context; all of the parts of the publication must be considered in order to ascertain the true meaning, and words are not to be given a meaning other than that which the context would show them to have.â€Â  Boone v. Sunbelt Newspapers, Inc., 347 S.C. 571, 582, 556 S.E.2d 732, 738 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Jones v. Garner, 250 S.C. 479, 485, 158 S.E.2d 909, 912 (1968)).\r\nThe article states one guardian had been accused of sleeping with the father of a child she represented, and plainly identifies that guardian. Â We agree with the trial judge that a reading of the article as a whole would make clear to a reasonable reader the identity of the guardian linked to this allegation of wrongdoing.Â  Consequently, Appellant may not recover damages for this statement because the trial judge properly ruled it did not refer to her and the juryâ€™s liability verdict was not based on it.\r\nWe affirm the trial judgeâ€™s rulings on remaining issues raised by Appellant because it is unnecessary to address them given our disposition of this appeal.Â  See Whiteside, 311 S.C. at 340, 428 S.E.2d at 889; Rule 220(c), SCACR.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the trial judgeâ€™s grant of a directed verdict to Newspaper on the issues of Appellantâ€™s status and liability for defamation.Â  Appellant, as a matter of law under the facts and circumstances of this case, is a private-figure plaintiff who demonstrated Newspaper was liable for defaming her pursuant to a jury charge agreed upon by both parties.Â  The jury determined by a preponderance of the evidence that the published statements were false and defamatory, and that Newspaper acted negligently in defaming Appellant as a private figure. Â These factual findings are supported by evidence in the record and will not be disturbed on appeal. Â The jury further determined Appellant had proven by clear and convincing evidence Newspaper acted with constitutional actual malice in publishing the statements.Â  Our independent examination of the record reveals evidence which sufficiently supports the juryâ€™s finding of actual malice. \r\nThe case was bifurcated on liability and damages with the consent of both parties.Â  Newspaper waived any objection it may have to bifurcation.Â  Therefore, we reinstate the juryâ€™s verdict holding Newspaper liable for the defamatory statements.Â  We remand this case for a jury to consider the issues of actual and punitive damages to Appellant.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s rulings on remaining issues raised by Appellant are affirmed.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, J., and Acting Justice Clyde N. Davis, Jr., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I agree with the majority opinion that Appellant was a private figure and that the directed verdict on the defamation action should be reversed.[12]Â  I respectfully dissent from the majority opinionâ€™s decision to â€œreinstate the juryâ€™s verdict holding Newspaper liable for defamatory statements.â€Â  In my opinion, there is no jury verdict to reinstate, and I would therefore remand the case for a new trial on liability and damages.Â  \r\nAs the majority observes, â€œthe record contains no indication the trial judge initially submitted the case to jurorsâ€ for the purpose of rendering an advisory verdict.Â  Further, the majority opinion correctly observes that Newspaper did not object to the trial judgeâ€™s submission of the case to the jury despite Newspaperâ€™s having not yet presented a defense on liability.Â  Because of this failure, Newspaper would ordinarily be bound by the juryâ€™s factual determinations.Â  Appellant herself, however, never objected to the trial courtâ€™s subsequent ruling that the juryâ€™s factual determinations were merely advisory.Â  The court and the parties proceeded under the ruling that the jury had not yet delivered a verdict on liability, and the court directed a verdict in favor of Newspaper before the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Finding no jury verdict to â€œreinstate,â€ and finding the direction of a verdict improper, I would remand the case for a new trial on liability and damages.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The parties and witnesses often referred to â€œthe Beal case,â€ as it was commonly known.Â  The divorce case was William Litchfield v. Carla Litchfield, who were divorced by an order filed April 13, 1998, about two years before the article was published.Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  Davis repeatedly stated the article accurately and truthfully reported Pat Bealâ€™s comments and opinions on the guardian ad litem system and her daughterâ€™s custody battle.Â  Newspaper repeats this same comment in its brief, stating it planned at trial to â€œdemonstrate conclusively that there were four statements and the [Newspaperâ€™s] source honestly thought them to be true.â€Â  This position distorts the concept that truth is a defense to defamation when, as occurred in this case, it is undisputed that certain statements were uttered and later published accurately in written form.Â  A defendant or publisher asserting truth as a defense must prove that the statement or purported fact is true, not that the person quoted actually made the statement.Â  E.g. Curtis Pub. Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 151 (1967) (truth is an absolute defense in almost all libel and slander cases); Boone v. Sunbelt Newspapers, Inc., 347 S.C. 571, 580, 556 S.E.2d 732, 737 (Ct. App. 2001) (publisher may avoid liability in any type of defamation case by proving the statement is true).\r\n[3] The trial lasted eight days, from March 22-30, 2004.Â  Appellant was on the witness stand from Monday, March 22, through Thursday morning, March 25. \r\n[4]Â  Newspaper states that the trial judge communicated his decision regarding bifurcation of the trial in off-the-record discussions on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning. \r\n[5]Â  The form instructed the jury to answer Question 2 only if the answer to Question 1 was â€œyes,â€ and to answer Questions 3 and 4 only if it answered â€œyesâ€ to the first two questions.Â  The form further instructed the jury that Question 3 applied only if the Court found Appellant was a private figure, and Question 4 applied only if the Court found Appellant was a public figure or public official.\r\n[6]Â  General damages include injury to reputation, mental suffering, hurt feelings, emotional distress, and similar types of injuries which are not capable of definite money valuation.Â  Special damages are tangible losses or injuries to the plaintiffâ€™s property, business, occupation, or profession in which it is possible to identify a specific amount of money as damages.Â  Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 510 n.4, 506 S.E.2d at 502 n.4.\r\n[7]Â  Under the common law, slander is actionable per se only when it charges the plaintiff with one of five types of acts or characteristics:Â  (1) commission of a crime of moral turpitude; (2) contraction of a loathsome disease; (3) adultery; (4) unchastity; or (5) unfitness in oneâ€™s business or profession.Â  Holtzscheiter II, 332 S.C. at 511 n.5, 506 S.E.2d at 502 n.5.\r\n[8]Â  The United States Supreme Court has explained that deciding whether a particular topic is a matter of public controversy or concern, while important in the analysis of a defamation action, is of lesser import than determining a plaintiffâ€™s status.Â  â€œWhatever their general validity, use of such subject-matter classifications to determine the extent of constitutional protection afforded defamatory falsehoods may too often result in an improper balance between the competing interests in this area. Â It was our recognition and rejection of this weakness in the Rosenbloom test which led us in Gertz to eschew a subject-matter test for one focusing upon the character of the defamation plaintiff.â€Â  Time, 424 U.S. at 454-56, 95 S. Ct. at 965-66, 47 L.Ed.2d at 164 (citing Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, 403 U.S. 29, 91 S. Ct. 1811, 29 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971)).\r\n[9]Â  The ruling could be made before trial pursuant to a pretrial motion when facts pertaining to a plaintiffâ€™s status are either stipulated or sufficiently known, or made during trial after pertinent facts are sufficiently established.Â  An earlier ruling may better focus the attention of the court and parties on pertinent issues and evidence.\r\n[10]Â  This Court upheld a jury verdict in favor of a private-figure plaintiff against a media defendant that apparently was grounded in negligence, although the issue was not addressed.Â  Jones v. Sun Publishing Co., 278 S.C. 12, 292 S.E.2d 23 (1982).Â  We have found no other South Carolina authority addressing the issue of using a negligence standard in private-figure defamation cases. \r\n[11]Â  Appellant needlessly muddles this issue by stating the jury was â€œdischarged,â€ which caused the circuit court to lose subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The jury was not discharged Friday evening.Â  It was sent home for the weekend and told to return Monday.Â  There is no issue of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n[12]&nbsp;\r\nI agree with the majority opinion that the partial directed verdict regarding the language in the article about a guardianâ€™s relationship with a man should be affirmed.Â  I additionally agree with all other holdings in section IV of the majority opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26134 ","title":"Anthony Law v.

Clenten Campbell, both of Bogoslow, Jones, Stephens &amp; Duffie, PA, of Walterboro, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Anthony Law, Vondeste Mole, Mark Holmes, Arthur Vaughan, Harry Jenkins, and Kenneth Green (Appellants) appeal the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment for South Carolina Department of Corrections (Respondent) on their malicious prosecution claims, the trial courtâ€™s grant of directed verdict for Respondent on their wrongful termination claims, and the trial courtâ€™s grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) for Respondent on their false imprisonment claims.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn early 1999, Willie Harrison, an inmate at the Allendale Correctional Institution (Institution), contacted Geraldine Miro, the Institutionâ€™s warden.Â  Harrison alleged Appellants, who were correctional officers at Institution, were trafficking drugs into and within the Institution.Â  He further alleged Appellants gave him drugs to sell to other inmates and he, in return, gave them money from those drug transactions.Â  Harrison also claimed Appellants would shake him down to collect the monetary proceeds from the drug sales.Â  Miro contacted Al Waters, Director of Internal Affairs for Respondent, who set up an internal investigation and assigned Investigators Melissa Nettles and Joseph Baker to the case. \r\nAs part of the internal investigation, Nettles contacted the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department to verify Harrisonâ€™s credibility, and they advised her that Harrison had provided them with reliable information on prior occasions.Â  Nettles and Baker interviewed at least four inmates prior to March 25, 1999, who corroborated Harrisonâ€™s allegations.Â  At trial, Nettles gave the following examples of information corroborated prior to March 25: inmate Larry David asserted Holmes was his drug supplier; inmate Eckerin Frazier said he received marijuana from Holmes and had paid Holmes over $4,700 from June 1998 to January 1999; Frazier also claimed Law, Holmes, Jenkins, and Green worked together to sell drugs in the Institution; and inmate Terry Fuller said he observed Law and Holmes give drugs to Harrison.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nNettles and Baker interviewed at least thirty-eight inmates at the Institution from March 15, 1999 to April 20, 1999, with at least twenty inmates corroborating Harrisonâ€™s allegations.Â  Nettles and Baker also searched bank records for Mole and Vaughan which showed large cash deposits and wire transfers during the latter part of 1998 and the early part of 1999.\r\nNettles testified Harrison told her that Vaughan had purchased a mobile home with the money received from Harrison through the drug deals.Â  Harrison gave Nettles a specific description of the mobile home, including where Vaughan purchased it and the purchase price.Â  Nettles confirmed these two details.Â  Harrison also picked Vaughanâ€™s mobile home from a photo lineup.\r\nWaters testified the senior staff met and decided Nettles and Baker would apply for arrest warrants for Appellants.Â  Nettles testified she assisted in preparing the affidavits and she and Baker gave sworn, oral testimony to support the warrants.Â  She told the magistrate that Harrisonâ€™s allegations had been corroborated and gave the magistrate the same kind of examples of corroboration that she gave during trial. \r\nOn March 25, 1999, Law, Mole, Holmes, Jenkins, and Vaughan were charged with conspiracy to traffic cocaine greater than 100 grams.Â  Law, Holmes, Jenkins, and Vaughan were arrested while at work and were held at the Institution from approximately 6:30 p.m. on March 25 until 2:00 a.m. on March 26, at which time they were transported to the county jail.Â  Mole was also arrested by the Dorchester County Police Department on March 25 while traveling through Dorchester County.\r\nUpon arrest, Holmes admitted he had received $200 from Harrison in exchange for one ounce of marijuana but denied giving Harrison the marijuana.Â  Upon arrest, Law admitted receiving money from Harrison and accused Holmes, Vaughan, Jenkins, and Green of running a drug ring within the Institution.Â  On March 26, 1999, Law and Holmes were charged with misprision of a felony, common law, and acceptance of rebates or extra compensation, and Mole was charged with misprision of a felony, common law. \r\nGreen was arrested at work on April 15, 1999 and detained for approximately six to seven hours.Â  He was charged with conspiracy to traffic crack cocaine, greater than 10 grams but less than 28 grams.Â  \r\nBased on the charges and the ongoing investigation, Respondent administratively suspended Appellants effective on the date of their arrests.Â  A review meeting before the warden was scheduled for each Appellant.Â  Respondent sent letters of termination to several Appellants but later rescinded the terminations.Â  \r\nJenkins and Law voluntarily resigned on March 29, 1999; Green and Holmes voluntarily resigned on April 30, 1999, and May 21, 1999, respectively.Â  None of the Appellants who voluntarily resigned filed a grievance with Respondent, but Green did request a review hearing.Â  Mole was terminated on May 7, 1999, and Vaughan was terminated on May 20, 1999.Â  After his termination, Mole filed a grievance report with Respondent and an investigative review was conducted by Respondentâ€™s General Counselâ€™s Office.Â  The Deputy Director of Operations upheld Moleâ€™s termination and the Director of Respondent subsequently upheld the termination.Â  Also after his termination, Vaughan filed a grievance.\r\nThe indictments against Appellants were nolle prossed because â€œ[t]he arresting agency has chosen to pursue these charges in federal court.â€Â  Nettles and Baker testified after making the arrests they consulted with Solicitor Randolph Murdaugh, who decided to turn the cases over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Nettles and Baker continued to help the FBI with the investigation until the end of their employment with Respondent.\r\nAfter filing verified claims with Respondent, Appellants individually sued Respondent on February 21, 2001.Â  Each Appellant sued under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act[1] for: (1) civil conspiracy, (2) defamation, (3) false imprisonment, (4) malicious prosecution, and (5) wrongful discharge.Â  Respondent simultaneously filed motions to dismiss and Answers on April 16, 2001.\r\nAppellantsâ€™ cases were consolidated for trial.Â  Prior to trial, Appellantsâ€™ causes of actions for defamation and civil conspiracy were dismissed by Appellantsâ€™ consent.Â  Respondent also moved for summary judgment on all causes of action.Â  The trial judge granted summary judgment on the malicious prosecution claims only.Â  \r\nAt the close of Appellantsâ€™ cases, the trial judge granted a directed verdict for Respondent on the wrongful termination claims.Â  The jury returned a verdict for Appellants on their false imprisonment claims, awarding $25,000 to each Appellant.Â  The trial judge granted Respondentâ€™s motion for JNOV.Â  This appeal follows, and this Court certified the case for review from the Court of Appeals, pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in granting Respondentâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the malicious prosecution claims?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in granting Respondentâ€™s motion for directed verdict on the wrongful termination claims?Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in granting Respondentâ€™s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the false imprisonment claims?Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Under Rule 56, SCRCP, a party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.&nbsp; In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist for summary judgment purposes, the evidence and all the inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493-94, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002); Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 462, 560 S.E.2d 606, 610 (2002). \r\nIn ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions and to deny the motions where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003).Â  The appellate court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a JNOV motion only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or where the ruling is controlled by an error of law.Â  Hinkle v. Natâ€™l Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Summary Judgment on Malicious Prosecution\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in granting Respondentâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the malicious prosecution claims.[2]Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nâ€œ[T]o maintain an action for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must establish: (1) the institution or continuation of original judicial proceedings; (2) by or at the instance of the defendant; (3) termination of such proceedings in plaintiffâ€™s favor; (4) malice in instituting such proceedings; (5) lack of probable cause; and (6) resulting injury or damage.â€ Parrott v. Plowden Motor Co., 246 S.C. 318, 321, 143 S.E.2d 607, 608 (1965); Eaves v. Broad River Elec. Co-op., Inc., 277 S.C. 475, 477, 289 S.E.2d 414, 415 (1982).Â  An action for malicious prosecution fails if the plaintiff cannot prove each of the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence, including malice and lack of probable cause.Â  Parrott, 246 S.C. at 322, 143 S.E.2d at 609.\r\nRespondent admitted to the institution of original judicial proceedings by its instance, elements 1 and 2, but contends Appellants did not prove the remaining elements of malicious prosecution.\r\nAppellants contend the trial judged erred in finding the original proceedings had not been sufficiently terminated in their favor.Â  Appellants argue that the criminal proceedings were terminated in their favor because the charges were nolle prossed, Respondent has not commenced a federal action, lapse of time, and lack of tangible evidence of the alleged crimes.Â  \r\nFirst, Appellants failed to establish a favorable determination of their prior criminal charges.Â  In\r\nMcKenney v. Jack Eckerd Co., 304 S.C. 21, 22, 402 S.E.2d 887, 888 (1991), the Court held â€œwhere an accused establishes that charges were nolle prossed for reasons which imply or are consistent with innocence, an action for malicious prosecution may be maintained.â€Â  On the underlying charges in the present cases, the reason stated for the nolle prosse was that the arresting agency had chosen to pursue the charges in federal court.Â  This reasoning does not imply and is not consistent with Appellantsâ€™ innocence.\r\nSecond, an essential element of malicious prosecution is the institution of judicial proceedings without probable cause against the plaintiff.Â \r\nKinton v. Mobile Home Indus., Inc., 274 S.C. 179, 262 S.E.2d 727 (1980).Â  The burden is on the plaintiff to show that the prosecuting person or entity lacked probable cause to pursue a criminal or civil action against him.Â  Parrott, 246 S.C. at 322, 143 S.E.2d at 609.Â  Probable cause means â€œthe extent of such facts and circumstances as would excite the belief in a reasonable mind acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor that the person charged was guilty of a crime for which he has been charged, and only those facts and circumstances which were or should have been known to the prosecutor at the time he instituted the prosecution should be considered.â€ Â Id.Â  In determining the existence of probable cause, the facts must be â€œregarded from the point of view of the party prosecuting; the question is not\r\nwhat the actual facts were, but what he honestly believed them to be.â€ &nbsp;Eaves,&nbsp;277\r\nS.C. at 478, 289 S.E.2d at 415-16&nbsp;(citing 54 C.J.S. Malicious Prosecution \r\nÂ§ 20, p. 977).&nbsp; South Carolina\r\nhas long embraced the rule that a true bill of indictment is prima facie\r\nevidence of probable cause in an action for malicious prosecution.&nbsp; Kinton,\r\n274 S.C. at 182, 262 S.E.2d at 728.&nbsp; Although the question of whether\r\nprobable cause exists is ordinarily a jury question, it may be decided as a\r\nmatter of law when the evidence yields but one conclusion. Parrott,&nbsp;246 S.C. at 323, 143 S.E.2d at 609.&nbsp; \r\nAppellants were indicted by the Allendale County Grand Jury in September 1999.Â  Prior to the arrests on March 25, 1999, Nettles and Baker interviewed Harrison at least three times and interviewed several other inmates who corroborated Harrisonâ€™s allegations.Â  Nettles and Baker also searched bank records of Mole and Vaughan which revealed numerous, large cash deposits and wire transfers during the months prior to the investigation.Â  Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Appellants, Appellants failed to establish a lack of probable cause because the indictments are prima facie evidence of probable cause and because the facts support a finding that Respondent had probable cause to pursue criminal charges.\r\nThird, Appellants did not establish Respondentâ€™s malice in instituting the original proceedings.Â  Malice is defined as â€œthe deliberate intentional doing of an act without just cause or excuse.â€Â  Eaves, 277 S.C. at 479, 289 S.E.2d at 416.Â  Malice does not necessarily mean a defendant acted out of spite, revenge, or with a malignant disposition, although such an attitude certainly may indicate malice.Â  Malice also may proceed from an ill-regulated mind which is not sufficiently cautious before causing injury to another person.Â  Moreover, malice may be implied where the evidence reveals a disregard of the consequences of an injurious act, without reference to any special injury that may be inflicted on another person.Â  Malice also may be implied in the doing of an illegal act for oneâ€™s own gratification or purpose without regard to the rights of others or the injury which may be inflicted on another person.Â  In an action for malicious prosecution, malice may be inferred from a lack of probable cause to institute the prosecution.Â  Margolis v. Telech, 239 S.C. 232, 122 S.E.2d 417, 420 (1961).\r\nThe record reveals Respondent conducted an internal investigation based upon an inmateâ€™s allegations that Appellants were trafficking drugs in the Institution.Â  The two primary investigators interviewed Harrison and at least four other inmates prior to the arrests and interviewed no less than 38 inmates at the Institution during the entire investigation.Â  Before completing the investigation, Nettles and Baker discussed the evidence with Waters who thought that arrests should be made based on historical conspiracy.Â  The institution of the original proceedings against Appellants was the result of a thorough investigation, and Appellants failed to establish malice.\r\nWe conclude the trial judge properly granted summary judgment for Respondent because Appellants failed to establish termination of the original proceedings in their favor, lack of probable cause, and malice, all elements of malicious prosecution.\r\nII. Directed Verdict on Wrongful Termination\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in ruling they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and in granting a directed verdict for Respondent on their wrongful termination claims.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe general rule is that administrative remedies must be exhausted absent circumstances excusing application of the general rule.Â  Hyde v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental Health, 314 S.C. 207, 442 S.E.2d 582 (1994); Andrews Bearing Corp. v. Brady, 261 S.C. 533, 201 S.E.2d 241 (1973).Â  â€œA general exception to the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies exists when a party demonstrates that a pursuit of them would be a vain or futile act.â€Â  Moore v. Sumter County Council, 300 S.C. 270, 273-74, 387 S.E.2d 455, 458 (1990) (citing 82 Am.Jur.2d Zoning and Planning Â§ 332 at 903 (1976)).&nbsp;\r\nFutility, however, must be demonstrated by a showing comparable to the administrative agency taking â€œa hard and fast position that makes an adverse ruling a certainty.â€Â  Thetford Properties IV Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. U.S. Depâ€™t of Hous. and Urban Dev., 907 F.2d 445, 450 (4th Cir. 1990).Â  \r\nThe question of whether to require the plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Andrews Bearing Corp., 261 S.C. at 536, 201 S.E.2d at 243.Â  A matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Tri County Ice and Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782 (1990).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs where the trial judge was controlled by an error of law or where his order is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.â€ Id.  \r\nRespondent, as a state agency, is governed by the State Employee Grievance Procedure Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 8-17-310 through 380 (1996 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  Section 8-17-330 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nEach agency shall establish an agency employee grievance procedure. . . .A covered employee who wishes to appeal the\r\ndecision of the agency grievance procedure to the State Human Resources Director shall file an appeal within ten calendar days\r\nof receipt of the decision from the agency head or his designee or within fifty-five calendar days after the employee files the\r\ngrievance with the agency, whichever occurs later.Â  The covered employee or the employeeâ€™s representative shall file the request\r\nin writing with the State Human Resources Director.Â  Failure to file an appeal with the State Human Resources Director within\r\nten calendar days of the agencyâ€™s final decision or fifty-five calendar days from the initial grievance, whichever occurs later,\r\nconstitutes a waiver of the right to appeal. . . . As used in this article, a covered employee may file a grievance or appeal\r\nconcerning the following adverse employment actions: terminations, suspensions, involuntary reassignments, and\r\ndemotions. . . .A covered employee has the right to appeal to the State Human Resources Director an adverse employment action\r\ninvolving the issues specified in this section after all administrative remedies to secure relief within the agency have\r\nbeen exhausted.\r\n\r\nAppellants contend the trial court misinterpreted the State Employee Grievance Procedure Act as requiring an employee to appeal to the State Human Resources Director upon an adverse ruling by the agency hearing the appeal.Â  Appellants argue the statute uses permissive language regarding the appeal to the State Human Resources Director.\r\nAppellants further argue the general rule of exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable to them because they have demonstrated the pursuit of such remedies would have been vain or futile.Â  Specifically, Appellant Moleâ€™s appeal was denied by the Director of Respondent; therefore his attempt was futile and because all Appellants were similarly situated, their attempts would have been futile.Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ Law, Holmes, Jenkins, and Green voluntarily resigned.Â  Therefore, we affirm the directed verdict for Respondent on their wrongful termination claims because they failed to state a cause of action.[3]Â  See  Troutman v. Facetglas, Inc., 281 S.C. 598, 316 S.E.2d 424 (Ct. App. 1984) (former employee who resigned under alleged threat to fire him did not state a cause of action for wrongful discharge).Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ Mole and Vaughan were terminated because conspiracy to traffic crack cocaine violated Respondentâ€™s internal policy regarding employee behavior.Â  Appellants had a grievable action\r\nunder the State Employee Grievance Procedure Act which they voluntarily did not appeal.[4]Â  Failure to file an appeal with the State Human Resources Director within the statutory time period constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-17-330. Â Furthermore, if Appellants were concerned of bias during the Respondentâ€™s appellate process because Respondent sought the charges, then an appeal to the State Human Resources Director, who was outside the agency, should have allayed any concerns of bias.Â  The trial judge correctly determined their wrongful termination claims were foreclosed under the State Employee Grievance Procedure Act because they did not exhaust their administrative remedies.Â  \r\nIII. JNOV on False Imprisonment\r\nAppellants argue the trial judge erred in granting Respondentâ€™s motion for JNOV on the false imprisonment claims.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe essence of the tort of false imprisonment consists of depriving a person of his liberty without lawful justification.Â  Jones v. City of Columbia, 301 S.C. 62, 389 S.E.2d 662 (1990); Thomas v. Colonial Stores, Inc., 236 S.C. 95, 113 S.E.2d 337 (1960).Â  To prevail on a claim for false imprisonment, the plaintiff must establish: (1) the defendant restrained the plaintiff, (2) the restraint was intentional, and (3) the restraint was unlawful. \r\n    Gist v. Berkeley County Sheriffâ€™s Depâ€™t, 336 S.C. 611, 521 S.E.2d 163 (Ct. App. 1999); Jones by Robinson v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 318 S.C. 171, 456 S.E.2d 429 (Ct. App. 1995); Caldwell v. K-Mart Corp., 306 S.C. 27, 410 S.E.2d 21 (Ct. App. 1991); see also Jones,&nbsp;301 S.C. at 64, 389 S.E.2d at 663&nbsp;(an action for false imprisonment cannot be maintained where one is arrested by lawful authority).\r\nThe fundamental issue in determining the lawfulness of an arrest is whether there was probable cause to make the arrest.Â  Gist, 336 S.C. at 615, 521 S.E.2d at 165.Â  Probable cause is defined as a good faith belief that a person is guilty of a crime when this belief rests on such grounds as would induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious man, under the circumstances, to believe likewise.Â  Jones v. City of Columbia,&nbsp;301 S.C. at 65, 389 S.E.2d at 663.Â  Although the question of whether probable cause exists is ordinarily a jury question, it may be decided as a matter of law when the evidence yields but one conclusion. Parrott,&nbsp;246 S.C. at 323, 143 S.E.2d at 609.\r\nâ€œAll proceedings before magistrates in criminal cases shall be commenced on information under oath, plainly and substantially setting forth the offense charged, upon which, and only which, shall a warrant of arrest issue.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-710 (1989).Â  A warrant affidavit that is â€œinsufficient in itself to establish probable cause may be supplemented before a magistrate by sworn oral testimony.â€Â  State v. Crane, 296 S.C. 336, 338, 372 S.E.2d 587, 588 (1988).\r\nBecause Respondent admitted the first and second elements, the determinative issue is whether probable cause to make the arrests existed.Â  \r\nAppellants assert their situation is similar to Gist.Â  Gist sued the Berkeley County Sheriffâ€™s Department for false arrest and false imprisonment.Â  The sheriffâ€™s department conceded the affidavit supporting the warrant for Gistâ€™s arrest did not establish probable cause, but relied on the investigating officerâ€™s testimony that he orally told the judge information that was not referenced in the affidavit to establish probable cause.Â  However, the record did not contain any evidence as to whether the affidavit was accompanied by sworn, oral testimony before the judge. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment for the sheriffâ€™s department.Â  The court found viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Gist, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the judge was presented sworn, oral testimony concerning a photographic lineup when the probable cause determination was made.Â  Gist, 336 S.C. at 615-17, 521 S.E.2d at 165-66.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the magistrate, who issued the arrest warrants, testified he routinely conducted an oral report, under oath, in addition to the affidavits presented to him before making a probable cause determination.Â  Nettles testified she and Baker gave sworn, oral testimony to the magistrate, which included examples of corroboration of Harrisonâ€™s allegations.[5]Â  \r\nThe present situation is distinguishable from Gist because the record contains evidence the affidavits were supplemented with sworn, oral testimony.Â  The facts known to the magistrate at the time of the probable cause determination included information from the affidavits[6] and from sworn, oral testimony.Â  We conclude, as a matter of law, the facts known to the magistrate â€œwould induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious man, under the circumstances, to believeâ€ that Appellants had committed the offenses.&nbsp; Jones,&nbsp;301 S.C. at 65, 389 S.E.2d at 663.Â  The trial judge correctly granted Respondentâ€™s JNOV because Appellants failed to establish the restraint was unlawful. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of Respondentâ€™s motions for summary judgment on the malicious prosecution claims and for JNOV on the false imprisonment claims.Â  We affirm as modified the directed verdict for Respondent on the wrongful termination claims.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, J., and Acting Justice Clyde N. Davis, Jr., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I agree with the majority opinion that the grant of summary judgment on the malicious-prosecution claims and the directed verdict on the wrongful-termination claims should be affirmed.Â  I respectfully dissent from the affirmance of JNOV on the false-imprisonment claims, because the evidence in the record yields at least one inference that supports the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  See Strange v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Highways and Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994) (providing the standard for ruling on motions for\r\nJNOV).&nbsp; \r\nThe lawful-authority determination here turns on whether the insufficient warrant affidavits were sufficiently supplemented by sworn oral testimony pursuant to State v. Crane, 296 S.C. 336, 338, 372 S.E.2d 587, 588 (1988).Â  If so, then the warrants were valid and lawful authority to arrest was present.Â  If not, then the warrants were not issued pursuant to legal process, and lawful authority to arrest was absent.Â  The relevant evidence is the trial testimony of the magistrate and the trial testimony of Investigator Nettles.Â  As stated in the majority opinion, â€œthe magistrate, who issued the arrest warrants, testified he routinely conducted an oral report, under oath, in addition to the affidavits presented to him before making a probable cause determination.Â  Nettles testified she and Baker gave sworn, oral testimony to the magistrate, which included examples of corroboration of Harrisonâ€™s allegations.â€Â  The majority holds that this trial testimony proves the warrant affidavits were orally supplemented.Â  In so holding, the majority necessarily passes on the credibility of witness.Â  I disagree with the holding because it was within the juryâ€™s province to believe or disbelieve this trial testimony.Â  See Curcio v. Caterpillar, Inc., 355 S.C. 316, 585 S.E.2d 272 (2003) (holding that â€œ[w]hen considering a JNOV, neither an appellate court, nor the trial court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or the evidence&quot;) (internal quotation omitted).Â  In my opinion, the evidence yields at least one reasonable inference that the warrant affidavits were not orally supplemented.Â  That inference supports a conclusion that the warrants were not issued pursuant to legal process and that lawful authority was therefore absent.Â  Consequently, I would reverse the grant of JNOV and reinstate the juryâ€™s verdict on Appellantsâ€™ false-imprisonment claims.Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to -200 (2005).\r\n[2] Â In support of its motion, Respondent presented the following evidence: affidavits of Nettles, Miro, Elizabeth Stewart, Robin Gracien, and Magistrate Walter Griffin; deposition of Baker; and several internal policies of Respondent.Â  Appellants did not file additional evidence.\r\n[3] Â This court may affirm the trial court based on any ground found\r\nin the record. Rule 220(c), SCACR; Iâ€™On, LLC v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 418, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000).\r\n[4] Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 8-17-320(7), -330 (defining â€œgrievanceâ€ to include dismissal from employment).\r\n[5]Â  At trial, Nettles testified as follows: \r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  And did you give sworn testimony to?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir, both myself and Officer Baker or Investigator Baker did.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  And did you tell [the magistrate] essentially the same things that\r\nyou told the Court here today?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir, I told [the magistrate] essentially what is written on the\r\naffidavits of each warrant, yes, sir.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Did you tell him about the corroboration of Mr. Harrison?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  And give him the same kinds of examples that youâ€™ve given us\r\nhere today?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes, sir, I did.\r\n[6]Â  For example, the affidavit supporting the warrant for Law provides: \r\nThat between May 1997 thru March 25, 1999 while at Allendale Correctional Institution located in Allendale County South Carolina, the defendant Anthony F.

McCue, both of Collins &amp; Lacy, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This is a legal malpractice action.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment, found the plaintiff to be in contempt, and dismissed the complaint as a sanction.Â  In addition, the trial court sentenced the plaintiff to six months imprisonment, issued a restraining order, and awarded court costs and attorneysâ€™ fees to the defendant.Â  The plaintiff appealed.Â  We hold that the trial court properly granted summary judgment, and properly issued criminal and civil contempt sanctions.Â  Additionally, the court correctly awarded costs.Â  Therefore, we affirm.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nThis legal malpractice action arose out of a land transaction in Allendale County.Â  Donald M. Brandt (Brandt) sued Elizabeth K. Gooding, the law firm of Gooding &amp; Gooding (Gooding), the lender, Edisto Farm Credit Service (Edisto Farm), and Ronald L. Summers (Summers), Senior Vice President of Edisto Farm, for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and civil conspiracy stemming from Goodingâ€™s representation of Brandt in the land transaction.[1]\r\nIn 1999, the court dismissed the claims against Summers and Edisto Farm.Â  The court found that those parties were sham parties named in the complaint by Brandt to establish venue in Orangeburg County.Â  As a result, venue was transferred to Allendale County.\r\nDuring discovery, Brandt produced a document (Edisto Farm Letter), which appeared to have been sent by Summers of Edisto Farm to Brandt on September 18, 1995.Â  Brandt also provided the letter to his malpractice expert, Professor John Freeman.Â  The letter was introduced in Professor Freemanâ€™s deposition and used by him to opine that Gooding had committed malpractice.Â  Brandt first caused the document to enter the case on April 3, 2001 when he provided a supplemental response to a request to produce.Â  In addition, Brandt introduced the deposition into evidence in the case as an attachment to his Memorandum in Support of Motion for Reconsideration on January 18, 2002. \r\nThe document, if authentic, would have imputed knowledge to Gooding of a conflict of interest related to the representation of Brandt in the land transaction.Â  But Gooding claimed that the document was fraudulent, and as a result, requested a hearing to determine whether the document was authentic.Â  In addition, Gooding asked the court to issue a citation of contempt if the document proved to be a forgery.Â  However, the circuit court judge delayed a contempt hearing until it could be determined if the document was authentic.\r\nIn subsequent motions before a second circuit court judge (trial court), Gooding moved for summary judgment, dismissal of the cause of action, and contempt.Â  At the hearing on the second motions, Gooding presented the testimony of Marvin Dawson (Dawson), an expert in document examination and authenticity.Â  Dawson opined that the letter was fraudulent.\r\nDawson testified that the Edisto Farm Letter was printed on a type of paper that was not developed until 2000, almost five years after the letter allegedly was sent.Â  In addition, Dawson found that the letter did not contain the appropriate watermark.Â  In a report, Dawson cited numerous inconsistencies and characteristics indicating that the document was a forgery.\r\nAlthough Brandt was not represented by counsel, Brandt cross-examined Dawson as to the authenticity of the document.Â  Brandt testified that he could not find anyone to represent him.Â  He did, however, bring a potential expert witness to court, but decided not to put the witness on the stand.Â  \r\nThe trial court found Brandt introduced a fraudulent document into a court proceeding.Â  As a result, the trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice as a sanction.Â  In addition, the trial court granted summary judgment.Â  The trial court also held Brandt in criminal contempt for perpetrating a fraud upon the court and sentenced him to six-months imprisonment.Â  Finally, the trial court awarded court and attorneysâ€™ fees to Gooding.Â  Subsequent to the trial courtâ€™s finding that the Summers letter was fraudulent, Professor Freeman withdrew his opinion, stating:\r\n\r\nThe Courtâ€™s meticulously detailed Order finds that the Brandt letter was â€œfabricated, forged and fraudulent,â€ and the [sic] Mr. Brandt committed a fraud on the Court in bringing the evidence forward . . . it appears to me that my services were used in an attempt to perpetrate a fraud on the Court.\r\n. . . . \r\n. . . I have no choice but to withdraw and disaffirm my opinion testimony offered in the Gooding case.\r\n\r\nBrandt filed a motion for reconsideration.Â  The trial court suspended the sentence pending review.Â  Upon review, the trial court sustained its earlier ruling and Brandt was taken into custody.Â  Another motion for reconsideration was filed and denied.Â  Brandt appealed.\r\nThis Court certified the following issues for review from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\nSCACR:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court have the authority to hold a contempt proceeding even though the first judge ruled that a contempt hearing should be delayed?\r\n          \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n        Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment?\r\n          \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.\r\n         Did the trial court err in dismissing the complaint as a sanction for civil contempt of court?\r\n          \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in holding Brandt in direct criminal contempt?\r\n          \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        V.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in issuing a restraining order?\r\n          \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees and costs?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw\r\n/ Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAuthority of the Trial Court\r\nBrandt argues that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to grant summary judgment or cite him for contempt of court.[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen determining whether to grant summary judgment, a court must examine both the facts and the law.Â  Royster Co. v. Eastern Distribution, Inc., 301 S.C. 18, 20, 389 S.E.2d 863, 864 (1990).Â  Because a court must conduct the examination of law and facts, such an examination constitutes a trial.Â  Id.Â  As a result, a summary judgment motion, when granted, constitutes the final determination of all the issues that exist between the parties.Â  Id.Â  See also Baird v. Charleston, 333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1999) (holding that summary judgment is an adjudication on the merits).\r\nIn support of his argument that the trial court did not have the authority to rule on contempt, Brandt relies on authority that prohibits one circuit court judge from reversing the standing order of another circuit court judge.Â  For example, in Cook v. Taylor, this Court held that a circuit court judge does not have the authority to reverse another circuit court judgeâ€™s determination of the proper mode of trial.Â  272 S.C. 536, 538, 252 S.E.2d 923, 924 (1979).Â  Moreover, a circuit court judge cannot deny the use of an amended complaint in light of an order of another circuit judge that permitted use of the amended complaint.Â  Enoree Baptist Church v. Fletcher, 287 S.C. 602, 603, 340 S.E.2d 546, 547 (1986).\r\nIn the present case, the first judge issued an order on Goodingâ€™s motion for a rule to show cause as to whether the Edisto Farm Letter was authentic.Â  If the letter was proven to be a forgery, Gooding wanted to go forward with contempt proceedings against Brandt.Â  The first judge dismissed the petition without prejudice because a contempt proceeding was premature until after the documentâ€™s authenticity was determined.Â  In addition, the first judge established a procedure to examine the document and examples of similar documents from Edisto Farm.Â  In essence, the first judge took the logical steps to leave the issue of contempt to be addressed after such a determination had been made.Â  Gooding then brought subsequent motions before the trial court with testimony from an expert that the document was a forgery.Â  In the second battery of motions, Gooding moved for summary judgment, for citation of contempt, and for dismissal of the complaint.Â  After a hearing, the trial court granted summary judgment, dismissed the complaint, and held Brandt in contempt of court.\r\nBecause the first judge delayed a contempt hearing, the trial court did not reverse a standing order of the first judge.Â  Instead, the trial court acted in accordance with the steps outlined by the first judge and ruled on the issue of contempt after the documentâ€™s authenticity could be determined.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the trial court had the authority to grant summary judgment.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary Judgment\r\nBrandt contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Gooding.Â  We disagree.\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997).Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id.Â  The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).\r\nIn a legal malpractice action, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant was negligent, (2) the defendantâ€™s negligence proximately caused the plaintiffâ€™s injuries, and (3) damages resulted.Â  Summer, 328 S.C. at 42, 492 S.E.2d at 58.\r\nIn the present case, the trial court granted summary judgment on the ground that Gooding did not proximately cause Brandt any injury.Â  In addition, the trial court found that because the case against Lombard in the Aiken County matter settled, Gooding was released from any liability.Â  Further, the trial court found Brandt could not show damages.Â  To the contrary, Brandt profited from the sale of outparcels from the land purchased in the transaction involved in this legal malpractice action.\r\nBecause Brandt did not suffer any injury, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCivil Contempt \r\nBrandt contends that the trial court erred ordering civil contempt and dismissing the complaint as a sanction for the contempt.Â  We disagree.\r\nCourts have the power to punish for both civil and criminal contempt.Â  In re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1998).Â  On appeal, a decision regarding contempt should be reversed only if it is without evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused his discretion.Â  Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 840-41 (1988) (citing Means v. Means, 277 S.C. 428, 431, 288 S.E.2d 811, 812-813 (1982)).Â  \r\nA defendant may move to dismiss the plaintiffâ€™s complaint on the ground that the plaintiff has no right to relief based on the facts and the law.Â  Rule 41, SCRCP; Shepard v. S.C. Dept. of Corrections, 299 S.C. 370, 372, 385 S.E.2d 35, 36 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Furthermore, a complaint may be dismissed with prejudice for failure to comply with these rules or any other order of the court.Â  Rule 41(b), SCRCP\r\nIn the present case, the trial court found Brandt to be in contempt of court for introducing a fraudulent document.Â  In response, the trial court dismissed the complaint as a sanction for perpetrating a fraud upon the court.\r\nWe hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint as a sanction for civil contempt.Â  Dismissal of the complaint is a proper sanction against a complainant who submits fraudulent documents to the court.Â  Therefore, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision. \r\nIV.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Criminal Contempt\r\nBrandt contends the trial court erred in holding him in direct criminal contempt.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion to punish by fine or imprisonment all contempts of authority before the court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-5-320 (1976).Â  In addition, courts have the inherent power to punish for offenses that are calculated to obstruct, degrade, and undermine the administration of justice.Â  State ex rel. McLeod v. Hite, 272 S.C. 303, 305, 251 S.E.2d 746, 747 (1979).\r\nDirect contempt involves contemptuous conduct in the presence of the court.Â  State v. Kennerly, 337 S.C. 617, 620, 524 S.E.2d 837, 838 (1999).Â  A person may be found guilty of direct contempt if the conduct interferes with judicial proceedings, exhibits disrespect for the court, or hampers the parties or witnesses.Â  State v. Havelka, 285 S.C. 388, 389, 330 S.E.2d 288 (1985).Â  Direct contempt that occurs in the courtâ€™s presence may be immediately adjudged and sanctioned summarily.Â  Intâ€™l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 827 (1994).\r\nâ€œSouth Carolina courts have always taken a liberal and expansive view of the â€˜presenceâ€™ and â€˜courtâ€™ requirements.â€Â  Kennerly, 337 S.C. at 620, 524 S.E.2d at 838.Â  The â€œpresence of the courtâ€ extends beyond the mere physical presence of the judge or the courtroom to encompass all elements of the system.Â  Id. \r\nThis Court has recognized that depositions are judicial proceedings and are within the â€œpresence of the court.â€Â  Matter of Golden, 329 S.C. 335, 496 S.E.2d 619 (1998).Â  In Golden, the Court held that â€œalthough a deposition is not conducted in a courtroom in the presence of a judge, it is nonetheless a judicial setting.â€Â  Because there is no presiding authority, it is even more incumbent upon attorneys to conduct themselves in a professional and civil manner during a deposition.Â  Id. at 343, 496 S.E.2d at 623.\r\nÂ In the present case, the record shows that Brandt presented a fraudulent document to the court.Â  The document was introduced at the deposition of Professor John Freeman.Â  In addition, the deposition was introduced into evidence in the case as an attachment to his Memorandum in Support of Motion for Reconsideration.Â  Further, the record shows that Brandt was the sole cause of the introduction of the document into this case when he provided a supplemental response to the request to produce one day before Professor Freemanâ€™s deposition.Â  We hold that the introduction of the document into the deposition constituted an introduction of the document into the presence of the court, warranting a citation for direct contempt.\r\nTherefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in citing Brandt for direct criminal contempt.Â Â Â  \r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restraining Order\r\nBrandt argues that the trial court abused its discretion by issuing a restraining order.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision of whether to issue a restraining order is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion.Â  State v. Hill, 266 S.C. 49, 52, 221 S.E.2d 398, 399 (1976).\r\nIn the present case, the record indicates that the judge did not abuse his discretion when he issued a restraining order.Â  Brandt testified that he would spend ten years and a million dollars to get justice against Summers and Edisto Farm Credit.Â  Further, Brandt used threatening conduct toward parties involved in the litigation.Â  For example, Brandt told Ronald Summers, after he was dismissed from the lawsuit, that he â€œwasnâ€™t out of the woods yet.â€\r\nThe issuance of a restraining order was arguably necessary to prevent Brandt from harassing Gooding and other parties involved in the litigation.Â  Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\r\nVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFees and Costs \r\nBrandt contends that the trial court erred in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees and costs.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of attorneysâ€™ fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  An award for civil contempt is appropriate when a party has caused unnecessary litigious activity as a result of the contemptuous behavior.Â  Curlee v. Howe, 277 S.C. 377, 386, 287 S.E.2d 915, 920 (1982).\r\nIn the present case, Brandt presented a fraudulent document.Â  The introduction of this document unnecessarily prolonged this case.Â  Therefore, the award of fees and costs is an appropriate award because of the unnecessary litigation directly related to the introduction of the letter.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the award.\r\nConclusion\r\nIn sum, we hold that summary judgment was proper.Â  Additionally, the citations for civil and criminal contempt were proper.Â  Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a restraining order and awarding attorneysâ€™ fees and costs.Â  Accordingly, the ruling of the trial court is affirmed.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Brandt also sued the Lombard Corporation (Lombard) in Aiken County.Â  Lombard was a partner in the land transaction with Brandt.Â  The parties settled.\r\n[2] The circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction in this matter.Â  See Johnson v. S.C. Dept. of Labor Licensing and Regulation, Op. No. 26015 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 25, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 30 at 41) (outlining the history of this Courtâ€™s restrictive view of subject mater jurisdiction); Dove v. Gold Kist, 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598 (1994) (stating that subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong); S.C. Const. Art. V, Â§ 11 (stating that the circuit court is the general trial court and has original jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters).Â  As a result, we address the issue with regard to whether the circuit court had the authority to rule on the issue of summary judgment and contempt.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26136","title":"Collins Entertainment  v.

Quinn, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER: We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Collins Ent. Corp. v. Coats &amp; Coats Rental Amuse., 355 S.C. 125, 584 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The sole issue on certiorari is whether the Court of Appeals erred in utilizing the â€œlost volume sellerâ€ doctrine to calculate damages.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1996, Collins Entertainment Corporation (Collins) contracted to lease video poker machines to two bingo hall operations known as Ponderosa Bingo and Shipwatch Bingo.[1]Â  The six-year lease required that any purchaser of the premises assume the lease.Â  In 1997, American Bingo and Gaming Corporation (American) purchased the assets of the bingo parlors.Â  American failed to assume the lease and removed Collinsâ€™ machines from the premises.Â  Collins brought this action against American alleging unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and intentional interference with contract.Â  The matter was referred to a master in equity for trial.Â  The master found American liable for intentional interference with contract and awarded Collins actual damages of $157,449.66 and punitive damages of $1,569,013.00.[2]Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Collins Ent. Corp. v. Coats &amp; Coats Rental Amuse., 355 S.C. 125, 584 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in utilizing the â€œlost volume sellerâ€ doctrine to hold Collins did not have a duty to mitigate its damages?Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nComment f to Section 347 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts states, in part, â€œif the injured party could and would have entered into the subsequent contract, even if the contract had not been broken, and could have had the benefit of both, he can be said to have lost volume and the subsequent transaction is not a substitute for the broken contract.â€Â  This theory of damages has come to be known as the â€œlost volume sellerâ€ doctrine.[3]Â  A lost volume seller is one whose willingness and ability to supply is, as a practical matter, unlimited in comparison to the demand for the product.Â  Thus, â€œ[t]he lost volume seller theory allows [for the] recovery of lost profits despite resale of the services that were the subject of the terminated contract if the seller . . . can prove that he would have entered into both transactions but for the breach.â€Â  Gianetti v. Norwalk Hosp., 833 A.2d 891 (Conn. 2003).Â  See also Comeq, Inc. v. Mitternight Boiler Works, 456 So.2d 264, 268-69 (Ala. 1984) (the reason for the rule is based on the idea that the lost volume seller would have received two profits, not just one, if the buyer had not breached, so that a recovery of both profits is necessary to put the seller in as good a position as if there had been no breach).Â  Although the lost volume seller theory is commonly understood to apply to contracts involving the sale of goods, it applies with equal force to contracts involving the performance of personal services.Â  Id. citing 22 Am.Jur.2d 592, Damages Â§ 509 (1988).Â  Whether a seller is a lost volume seller is a question of fact.Â  Bill's Coal Co. v. Board of Public Utilities, 887 F.2d 242, 245 (10th Cir.1989); Rodriguez v. Learjet, Inc., 833 A.2d 891, 897 (Kan. 1997); Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 347, Comment f (1979).Â  \r\nAmerican asserts adoption of the lost volume seller doctrine eliminates a sellerâ€™s duty to mitigate damages.Â  It contends we should adopt the position advanced by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Northeastern Vending Company v. PDO, Inc., 606 A.2d 936 (Pa. 1992), in which the court declined to adopt the lost volume seller doctrine stating, summarily, that it would erode the duty to mitigate damages.[4]Â  We decline to adopt the Pennsylvania approach because we do not find the doctrine erodes the duty to mitigate damages.Â  On the contrary, the doctrine realizes that in certain situations, even where a buyer does mitigate, if the seller would have made the second sale in any event, then the â€œlost volumeâ€ measure of damages places him in the same position he would have been had the buyer not repudiated.[5]Â  As the Court in Davis Chemical v. Diasonics Inc., 826 F.2d 678, 683, n. 3 (7th Cir. 1987), stated, â€œby definition, a lost volume seller cannot mitigate damages through resale. Resale does not reduce a lost volume sellerâ€™s damages because the breach has still resulted in its losing one sale and a corresponding profit.â€ See also Storage Technology Corp. v. Trust Co., 842 F.2d 54, 56 n. 2 (3rd Cir.1988) (pointing out that resale does not make a lost-volume seller whole); Matthews, infra,Â  51 U. Miami L.Rev. at 1214 (noting that the philosophical heart of the lost volume theory is that the seller would have generated a second sale irrespective of the buyerâ€™s breach such that it follows that the lost volume seller cannot possibly mitigate damages).\r\nFurther, we find the legislatureâ€™s adoption of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2A-528(2) is consistent with adoption of the lost volume seller doctrine.Â  Section 36-2A-528(2) (dealing with leased goods)[6] tracks the language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-708(2) (sellerâ€™s damages for sales).Â  Section 36-2-708 clearly tracks the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code section (UCC Â§ 2-708(2)) upon which the lost volume seller doctrine is premised.Â  See generally, Jerald B. Holisky, Finding the Lost Volume Seller; Two Independent Sales Deserve Two Profits Under Illinois Law, 22 J. Marshall L. Rev. 363 (Winter 1988) (recognizing that the lost profit seller doctrine emanates from UCC 2-708(2)); Jonathan J. Lautt, Contract Law: A Clean Start for Lost Volume Lessees, 34 Washburn L.J. 136 (Fall 1994) (recognizing that section 82-2-708 (2) of the Kansas Statutes codifies the lost volume recovery for the sale of goods).Â  By adoption of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2A-528(2), we find the Legislature has tacitly approved of the lost volume seller doctrine.Â Â  \r\nAmerican next asserts there is insufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate that Collins is a lost volume seller.Â  We disagree.Â  There is no one set test to determine whether one is a lost volume seller.Â  According to one commentator: \r\n\r\nProfessor Harris has developed three main requirements that a lost volume seller must meet: (1) the person who bought the resold entity would have been solicited by the plaintiff had there been no breach or resale; (2) the solicitation would have been successful; and (3) the plaintiff could have performed that additional contract.Â  Most American courts and commentators have adopted these requirements.[7]  \r\n\r\nSaidov, The Methods for Limiting Damages Under the Vienna Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods, 14 Pace Intâ€™l L. Rev. 307 (Fall 2002), citing Jerald B. Holisky, Finding the Lost Volume Seller: Two Independent Sales Deserve Two Profits under Illinois Law, 22 J. Marshall L. Rev. 363, 375 (1998).\r\nHere, there is testimony in the record which indicates that Collins had surplus machines on hand and that, had another location been available, it could and would have supplied those locations with video machines.Â  Further, Collins did place 19 of the 20 machines which were removed from Shipwatch and Ponderosa into other premises.Â  As found by the Master, it is patent that Collins had excess inventory with which to supply and rotate machines through all of its customers.Â  \r\nAmerican argues there has been no showing by Collins that the specific type of machines removed from the Shipwatch and Ponderosa were available at its warehouses, such that it has failed in its burden to demonstrate it had excess capacity.Â  We disagree.Â  Initially, although American argued there was insufficient evidence of excess capacity below, it made no argument with respect to the specific types of machines at issue.Â  Accordingly, as this specific argument was not raised below, it is not preserved.Â  In any event, Collins presented testimony from its assistant comptroller for accounting that, although there were ten machines in each location (i.e., the Shipwatch and Ponderosa), a total of 48 machines rotated through the locations.Â  Livingston also testified that â€œwe had machines in the warehouse that could have easily replaced these 48 at the 130 locations.â€ Livingstonâ€™s testimony is sufficient to establish that Collins had more supply capacity of these machines than it had demand.Â  Moreover, the lease agreement between Collins and Coats and Coats Rental gives Collins the right to furnish â€œall video game terminals and all coin operated music and amusement machines, to include a special multi-player Black Jack/Poker unit.â€Â  We find no requirement (other than one multi-player poker unit) that Collins place any particular machines on the premises, such that Collins was free to have utilized any of its machines at the Ponderosa and Shipwatch.Â  Accordingly, Collins was not required to demonstrate excess capacity as to a specific type of machine.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nContrary to the arguments raised by American, we find adoption of the lost volume seller doctrine does not eliminate a sellerâ€™s duty to mitigate his damages.Â  The doctrine simply recognizes that, in situations in which the seller has excess capacity and would, in any event, have made both sales, the lost volume measure of damages is necessary to place the seller in the same position he would have been had the buyer not repudiated.Â  Further, there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Collins was, in fact, a lost volume seller in this case.Â  Accordingly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals utilizing the lost volume seller doctrine is affirmed.[8]\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n MOORE, J., concurs.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.Â  \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s express adoption of the lost-volume-seller doctrine and in the result.Â  A lost-volume seller, or lessor, cannot mitigate his damages, so there is no duty to try.Â  Evidence in the record supports the finding that Collins is a lost-volume lessor.Â  I write separately because my analysis differs from the majorityâ€™s on some issues.\r\nIn note 8, the majority asserts that the issue whether the lost-volume-seller doctrine can apply in contract but not tort, an issue addressed in the dissent, is not preserved.Â  I disagree.Â  The issue is within the ambit of the main issue in the case ... whether the doctrine ever applies.Â  I nonetheless disagree with the dissent that the lost-volume-seller doctrine can apply in breach-of-contract cases but not in tortious-interference cases.Â  \r\nAs noted in the dissent:Â  â€œThe nexus between the two causes of action [breach of contract and tortious interference with contract] is the breach of the contract, for ... breach of the contract is an element of both causes of action.Â  This is the element from which the injured partyâ€™s actual damages flow on both the contract and tort claims.â€Â  Collins Music Co. v. Smith, 332 S.C. 145, 147, 503 S.E.2d 481, 481 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting Ross v. Holton, 640 S.W.2d 166, 173 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982)).Â  In sum, contract damages are part of tortious-interference damages.Â  The nature of the claim, whether contract or tort, does not affect the method of determining the damages flowing from the plaintiffâ€™s loss of contract expectations, and the lost-volume-seller doctrine merely provides one such method.Â  There is no reason that the doctrine cannot apply in a tortious-interference case. \r\nWith respect to the dissentâ€™s conclusion that Collins has received a double recovery, I agree, but the writ of certiorari that we granted did not encompass the issue.Â  The only issues before us are whether the lost-volume-seller doctrine can apply in South Carolina and whether it applies in this case.\r\nFor the reasons above, I concur in the result reached by the majority.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the â€œlost volume sellerâ€ doctrine should not be adopted and applied in this case.Â  Moreover, in my view, the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s calculation of damages.Â  Therefore, I would reverse and remand.Â Â Â  \r\nThe lost volume seller doctrine is a measure of damages applied in cases involving breach-of-contract claims. See, e.g., Gianetti v. Norwalk Hosp., 833 A.2d 891 (Conn. 2003); Jetz Serv. Co., Inc. v. Salina Properties, 865 P.2d 1051 (Ct. App. Kan. 1993).Â  \r\nThe present case, however, involves an allegation of tortious interference with contract.[9]Â  As its name implies, tortious interference with contract is a tort, requiring the plaintiff to establish, among other things, intentional procurement of the contractâ€™s breach. Â See, e.g., Camp v. Spring Mortg. Co., 310 S.C. 514, 517, 426 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1993); Todd v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 287 S.C. 190, 192-93, 336 S.E.2d 472, 473 (1985).Â  Consequently, damages for tortious interference of contract â€œare not measured by contract rules.â€Â  Collins Music Co., Inc. v. Smith, 332 S.C. 145, 147, 503 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting Ross v. Holton, 640 S.W.2d 166 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982)).Â  \r\nBecause the lost volume seller doctrine applies in breach-of-contract cases only, and because the present case involves a tort, the court of appeals, in my view, erred in adopting and applying the doctrine.Â  \r\nMoreover, in my view, the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s calculation of damages.Â  A plaintiff may not recover twice for the same injury.Â  Riddle v. City of Greenville, 251 S.C. 473, 478, 163 S.E.2d 462, 464 (1968); Collins Music Co., Inc. v. Smith, 332 S.C. 145, 147, 503 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In Smith, Collins brought an action against one party for breach of contract and against a second party for tortious interference with contractual relations.Â  The jury awarded $10,000 in actual damages on the breach-of-contract claim and $10,000 in actual damages for the tortious-interference claim.Â  After granting the defendantsâ€™ motions to amend the judgment, the trial court entered a single judgment of $10,000.Â  The court of appeals affirmed.Â  Id.\r\nIn affirming the award of a single judgment, the court explained as follows:\r\n\r\nWhile the causes of action [of breach and tortious interference] involve separate and distinct wrongful acts committed by different parties, there are important commonalities which affect the damages question. The nexus between the two causes of action is the breach of the contract, for . . . breach of the contract is an element of both causes of action. This is the element from which the injured partyâ€™s actual damages flow on both the contract and tort claims. This does not mean, however, that the measure of actual damages on both causes of action are coextensive. \r\n\r\n  Under the contract claim the injured party can recover actual damages for the direct and natural consequences of the breach, or for damages that were within\r\nthe contemplation of the contracting parties. The damages recoverable for intentional interference are not measured by contract rules. The injured party can recover from the tortfeasor: the pecuniary loss of the benefits of the contract; consequential losses for which the interference is the legal cause; and, emotional distress or actual harm to reputation if they are reasonably to be expected to result from the interference. Thus, the actual damages under the contract claim and tort claim will be coextensive only with respect to the lost benefits of the contract which were a direct and natural consequence of the breach, or within the contemplation of the contracting parties.\r\n[The injured party] cannot collect double recovery (once from each defendant) for actual damages which are coextensive under the contract and tort claims. \r\n\r\nId. at 147-48, 503 S.E.2d at 482 (quoting Ross v. Holton, 640 S.W.2d 166 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982) (internal citations omitted)) (emphasis added).\r\nIn the present case, Collins was awarded actual damages for the breach-of-contract claim in the amount of $232,628.00,[10] plus $66,255.00 in pre-judgment interest.Â  Collins was also awarded $157,449.66[11] in actual damages for the tortious-interference claim, plus $1,569,013.00 in punitive damages.Â  \r\nIn my view, Collins should not have received two separate actual damages awards for a single breach of contract.Â  By awarding damages under both the breach-of-contract and tortious-interference claims, the trial court improperly awarded Collins the lost benefits of the contract twice.Â  Because the evidence regarding damages was the direct and natural consequence of a single breach, Collins was not entitled to the full amount of actual damages under both causes of action.\r\nWhile I disagree that the lost volume seller doctrine is applicable in a tort case, I would urge that if the doctrine is to be adopted that the doctrine be applied correctly.Â  \r\nGenerally, the lost volume seller doctrine allows for the recovery of the lost profits resulting from the breach by showing that the party would have been able to enter into the beached contract and a subsequent contract even if there was no breach.Â  Unique Designs, Inc. v. Pittard Machinery Co., 200 Ga.App. 647, 649, 409 S.E.2d 241, 243 (Ga. Ct. App. 1991).Â  However, the majorityâ€™s application of the doctrine allows for the double recovery from the same breach.Â  In essence, the application of the doctrine by the majority allows for the recovery of one set of damages for the breach-of-contract and second recovery in tort for the tortious-interference with contract claim resulting from the same breach but brought about by joint actors.Â  \r\nAs outlined above, in the present case, Collins settled its claim for breach of contract against Coats.Â  In addition, Collins sought damages against American Bingo for tortious interference of contract.Â  As a result, any recovery from American Bingo would have to be set off against any recovery from Coats.Â  See Restatement 2d Torts Â§ 774(2) (stating that payments made by the third person in settlement of the claim must be credited against the liability for causing the breach and go to reducing the damages for the tort).Â  Accordingly, I write to prevent a third recovery on the part of Collins.\r\nIn addition, I disagree with the concurrence that the issue of double recovery is not before the Court.Â  In my opinion, the issue arrives before this Court within the issue of when and how the lost volume seller doctrine is applied. Â As a result, I believe the Court should hold that the any recovery from American Bingo represents a double recovery and this amount should be offset from the Coatsâ€™ settlement. \r\nTherefore, in my view, the court of appeals erred in using the lost volume seller doctrine to affirm the damages award.Â  Moreover, in my view, the trial courtâ€™s calculation of damages was incorrect.Â  Consequently, I would reverse and remand this case for a re-calculation of damages.[12] Â \r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The parlors were owned by Coats and Coats Rental Amusements, and the Coatsâ€™ son, Wayne Coats.Â  The Coats were named in the complaint, but are not parties to this appeal. \r\n[2]Â  The master dismissed the civil conspiracy claim, and found for American on the unfair trade practices claim.Â  \r\n[3] Â The term â€œlost volume sellerâ€ was coined by Professor Robert J. Harris in his article A Radical Restatement of the Law of Seller's Damages: Sales Act and Commercial Code Results Compared, 18 Stan.L.Rev. 66 (1965).Â  As noted by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Famous Knitwear Corp. v. Drugfair Inc., 493 F2d 251 (4th Cir. 1974):\r\nAssume a contract for the sale of a washing machine with a list price of $500. Buyer breaches, and seller resells that washing machine at the same list price that buyer had been willing to pay. However, the resale buyer is one of seller's regular customers who had intended to purchase a washing machine from him anyway. If the seller's total cost per machine was $300, he stood to gain an aggregate profit of $400, that is, $200 profit from each of two sales. Clearly the [UCC] 2-708 contract-market differential formula is inadequate in this situation since it gives no damages to the seller who has lost a $200 profit because of the breach.Â  In such a case the damage award should be the lost profit, that is, $200, for this will place the seller in as good a position as performance would have done.\r\nFamous Knitwear, 493 F.2d at 254, n. 5 citing J. White &amp; R. Summers, Handbook of the Law Under the Uniform Commercial Code, 7-9, at 226-27 (1972).Â  \r\n[4]Â  It appears Pennsylvania is the only jurisdiction which rejects the concept of the lost volume seller.Â  See Gianetti v. Norwalk Hosp., 779 A.2d 847 (Conn. 1997), revâ€™d in part on other grounds 833 A.2d 891 (2003).Â  \r\n[5] Â As stated by one commentator, the â€œNortheastern court's concern over the potential idleness of the lost volume seller is completely unwarranted. . . . as a general rule, the nonbreaching party has a duty to mitigate its damages by entering into a similar contract. However, the important qualification to this rule is that if the subsequent contract would have been made regardless of the breach, then that contract is not taken into consideration to minimize the damages. This is exactly the rule articulated by the second Restatement of Contracts and which the Northeastern court chose to ignore.â€Â  Daniel Matthews, Should the Doctrine of Lost Volume Seller Be Retained: A Response to Professor Breen, 51 U. Miami L.Rev. 1195, 1214 (1997) (hereinafter Matthews article).\r\n[6]Â  That section provides, in part, â€œ[i]f the measure of damages . . . is inadequate to put a lessor in as good a position as performance would have, the measure of damages is the present value of the profit, including reasonable overhead, the lessor would have made from full performance . . . together with any incidental damages . . .due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of distribution.\r\n[7]Â  Other â€œtestsâ€ have been adopted.Â  For example, in Sunrich v. Pacific Foods of Oregon, 2004 WL 1124492 (D. Or. 2004), the District Court for the District of Oregon held that â€œ[a]s an alleged lost volume seller, Pacific therefore bears the burden of establishing that its production capacity was such that, if Sunrich had not breached the Packing Agreement, Pacific would have been able to meet Sunrich's requirements, as well as the needs of alternative buyers.â€Â  See also Van Ness Motors v. Vikram, 535 A.2d 510, 511 (N. J. Super. 1987) (recognizing that â€œ[m]ost other jurisdictions have held that to qualify as a â€˜lost volumeâ€™ seller under Section 2-708(2), the seller needs to show only that it could have supplied both the breaching purchaser and the resale purchaser); Iran v. Boeing Co., 771 F.2d 1279 (9th Cir. 1985); Teradyne, Inc. v. Teledyne Industries, 676 F.2d 865, 868 (1st Cir.1982); Autonumerics, Inc. v. Bayer Industries, 696 P.2d 1330, 1340-41 (Ariz. App.1984); National Controls, Inc. v. Commodore Business Machines, Inc., 163 Cal.App.3d 688, 696-98, 209 Cal.Rptr. 636, 641-43 (1985).Â  An even more lenient test, as set forth by the Georgia Court of Appeals, requires that â€œ[the seller] must prove that even though he later resold the repudiated contract goods, the sale to the third party would have been made regardless of the buyer's breach so that the seller would have realized two profits from two sales. The key inquiry is the sellersâ€™ ability to provide the product to both the breaching buyer and the resale buyer.Â  Unique Designs, Inc. v. Pittard Machinery Co., 409 S.E.2d 241, 243 (Ga. 1991) (emphasis supplied).\r\n[8] Â Â The dissent contends adoption of the lost volume seller doctrine is inappropriate, claiming the doctrine does not apply to tort claims.Â Â  However, American never argued below that the doctrine did not apply to Collinsâ€™ claim for tortious interference with contract.Â  Although American argued, generally, against adoption of the lost volume seller doctrine, it did not raise the argument now advanced by the dissent.Â  Accordingly, in my opinion the dissent errs in raising and addressing this issue sua sponte.Â  See State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 107, 504 S.E.2d 324, 327 (1998) (Toal dissenting) (issue which is procedurally barred should not be raised sua sponte by this Court); Rule 226(d)(2), SCACR (issue must have been raised in initial arguments to Court of Appeals).Â Â  See also Â Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nMoreover, as noted by Justice Pleiconesâ€™ concurrence, the only issue on certiorari is whether or not to adopt the lost-volume seller doctrine, and whether it applies in this case.Â  The issue of double recovery as addressed in Justice Toalâ€™s dissent is not before this Court.\r\n[9] This cause of action is also referred to as â€œintentional interference with contract.â€Â  Todd v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 287 S.C. 190, 192, 336 S.E.2d 472, 473 (1985).\r\n[10] This award was calculated based on the terms of the contract signed by Collins and the other defendants, Coats and Coats Rental Amusements and Wayne Coats.Â  The contract provides that in the event of a breach, Collins shall be â€œentitled to liquidated damages in an amount equal to Collinsâ€™ average weekly share of the contents of the coin boxes, prior to said breach, multiplied by the number of weeks remaining in the unexpired term of this agreement.â€Â  \r\n[11] Like the award for breach of contract, the award for tortious interference was calculated by taking Collinsâ€™ average revenue experience prior to the breach, multiplied by the number of weeks remaining in the contract.Â  The difference in this award, though, is that license fees and other operating expenses were deducted from the final amount.\r\n[12] On remand, the court should also reconsider the award of punitive damages.Â  See McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 344 S.C. 466, 545 S.E.2d 286 (2001) (there must be an award of actual or nominal damages for a verdict of punitive damages to be supported).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Pamela Buchanan-Lyon","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2006-04-06-01","description":"This is an order transferrring an attorney to incapacity inactive status and appointing an attorney to protect the attorney's clients' interests.","date":"2006-04-12","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of \r\n  Pamela Buchanan-Lyon, Respondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n The Office of Disciplinary Counsel has filed a petition requesting respondent be transferred to incapacity inactive status pursuant to Rule 17(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and requesting appointment of an attorney to protect the interests of respondent&rsquo;s clients pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.

Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor David Michael Pascoe, Jr., of St. Matthews, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant was found guilty for intimidation of a court official and was sentenced to seven years in prison.Â  He argues the trial court erred by failing to grant a directed verdict in his favor. Â We certified this case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and now affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDonna Sands was appointed to represent appellant in a post-conviction relief (PCR) action.Â  After appellant received an unfavorable ruling from Judge Diane Goodstein in the case, he wrote Sands three letters.Â  Sands gave the third letter she received to Judge Goodstein because appellant wished to terminate her representation and because she was concerned about an alleged threat to her and Judge Goodstein contained in the letter.Â  Sands filed a motion for reconsideration on appellantâ€™s behalf after receiving the letter, but she was ultimately relieved from representing him.\r\nAppellantâ€™s third letter stated, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nDear Donna,\r\n. . . I am most highly displeased over your lack of loyalty &amp; professionality in handling my case.Â  . . . I must hereby terminate you from my case . . .\r\nDo not do anything else, since you donâ€™t know how to force a ruling out of that incipant [sic] judge, who made that personally biased comment from the bench, when she stated that she had no intention of ordering my release.Â  I will not stop until I put you &amp; her out of practice, since you personally acquise [sic] with her actions.Â  Send me that file.Â  . . .\r\n\r\nJudge Goodstein testified that, after receiving the letter from Sands, she asked the solicitorâ€™s office to investigate the alleged threat.Â  Following the investigation, Judge Goodstein was shown the other two letters written by appellant[1] and she learned appellant was scheduled to be released from prison in approximately two years.Â  She testified she already knew that appellant had been convicted of a violent crime.Â  She believed appellant intended to threaten the court and interfere with the courtâ€™s process.Â  Although appellant did not directly contact her, Judge Goodstein stated she personally felt threatened and intimidated by him given his history.[2]Â  Further, she said she was frightened by the three letters, which she found to be â€œabsolutely vicious,â€ appellantâ€™s release date, and his statement to a SLED officer.Â  She interpreted appellantâ€™s statement in the letter that he would â€œput . . . her out of practiceâ€ as a threat to her personally and not to her law license.Â  Judge Goodstein testified that when she subsequently received the motion to reconsider in appellantâ€™s PCR case, she recused herself because she could not be fair and impartial given that appellant had injected her personally into the case.\r\nAs part of the investigation into the alleged threat, SLED Officer John Garrison interviewed appellant while he was incarcerated.Â  When Garrison asked appellant if, when he got out, he intended to go see Sands and Judge Goodstein, appellant replied, â€œI donâ€™t know, I think Iâ€™ll have to go see them.â€Â  Garrison testified appellant made no other statement during the interview that was threatening other than that he was going to see Judge Goodstein when he was released.Â  Garrison stated his opinion was that a threat had been made against Judge Goodstein.\r\nFollowing the close of the Stateâ€™s evidence, appellantâ€™s directed verdict motion was denied.Â  The jury returned a verdict of guilty and appellant moved for a new trial.Â  The court denied the motion because there was evidence to support the juryâ€™s verdict.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by failing to grant a directed verdict in appellantâ€™s favor?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by failing to grant a directed verdict in his favor where there was insufficient evidence of his guilt.[3]\r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001).Â  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 555 S.E.2d 402 (2001).Â  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. McHoney, supra.\r\nAppellant was charged with intimidation of a court official pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-340 (2003).Â  Section 16-9-340 states:\r\n\r\n(A)&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unlawful for a person by threat or force to:\r\n  \r\n(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; intimidate or impede a judge . . . in the discharge of his duty as such; or\r\n(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; destroy, impede, or attempt to obstruct or impede the administration of justice in any court.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe trial court did not err by denying the motion for a directed verdict.Â  There was evidence reasonably tending to prove appellantâ€™s guilt of the stated crime.Â  The statements in the letters combined with appellantâ€™s violent history, his impending release date, and his statement to Officer Garrison that he was going to see Judge Goodstein after he was released, qualified as a threat and an attempt to interfere with the courtâ€™s process.Â  Judge Goodsteinâ€™s ability to discharge her duty as a judge was impeded when she had to recuse herself from appellantâ€™s case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and because there is evidence sufficient to survive a directed verdict motion, the trial court appropriately submitted this case to the jury.Â  Therefore, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Mark Hayes, II, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]The first letter appellant wrote to Sands contained the following statements:Â  â€œI hope to see you in Hell, because you are not going to like what I have to do just for you.Â  . . . There is a price for everything, and you will find it particularly bitter.â€\r\nThe second letter contained the following statements:\r\n\r\n. . . I have a plan for you.Â  I hope that you enjoyed that $500 you got for selling me out, because you will regret what you have done, and I will guarantee it.Â  . . . How valuable is your practice to you?Â  . . . If you think that you can do anything to a walking dead man, hit me with your best shot, because I will handle you . . . .Â  I am set to destroying you, just like pulling the wings off of a fly, do you understand this?Â  For whom does the bell toll?Â  . . . By your own incompetent hand are you destroyed, when you reap as you have sown.Â  Do you think that I will at all spare your images?\r\n\r\n[2]Appellant was incarcerated in approximately 1981 for criminal sexual conduct and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.\r\n[3]The State argues the issue is not preserved for review because appellant did not renew his motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence.Â  However, because appellant did not present any evidence, he was not required to renew that motion.Â  Cf. State v. Bailey, Op. No. 4079 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 23, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 4 at 91, 95, n.4) (if defendant presents evidence after denial of his directed verdict motion at the close of the Stateâ€™s case, he must make another directed verdict motion at the close of all evidence in order to appeal the sufficiency of the evidence).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26138","title":"Thomas v.

Blackwell, of Lancaster, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES: Â Appellant Floyd Thomas, Jr. (Appellant) brought this action in the family court against Respondent Pearlie Mae McGriff (Respondent), as Personal Representative of the Estate of Ella Mae McGriff, for a declaration that Appellant and Ella Mae McGriff were common-law spouses on the date of Ella Maeâ€™s death.Â  The family court granted Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, holding that because Ella Mae was deceased and her probate estate was open, the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.Â  We certified the case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and we now reverse the family courtâ€™s decision and remand the case to the family court for further proceedings.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the family court erred in dismissing Appellantâ€™s action for\r\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAs the family court noted, this case turns on the interpretation of two statutes: South Carolina Code sections 20-7-420(5)[1] and 62-1-302(a)(1).[2]Â  Section 20-7-420(5) provides:Â  â€œThe family court shall have exclusive jurisdiction ... [t]o hear and determine actions to determine the validity of marriages.â€ Â Section 62-1-302(a)(1) provides:Â  â€œTo the full extent permitted by the Constitution, and except as otherwise specifically provided, the probate court has exclusive original jurisdiction over all subject matter related to ... estates of decedents, including the contest of wills, construction of wills, and determination of heirs and successors of decedents and estates of protected persons.â€[3]\r\nThe family court ruled that section 20-7-420(5) does not apply when one of the parties to the purported common-law marriage is deceased.Â  Rather, the court held, section 62-1-302(a)(1) applies, because a determination that a party was the common-law spouse of the decedent is really a determination that the party is an heir of the decedent.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nReading the statutes together, jurisdiction to determine the existence of a common-law marriage depends upon the ultimate issue before the court.Â  If the ultimate issue is heirship, which is within the probate courtâ€™s exclusive jurisdiction, then the probate court has jurisdiction to resolve the threshold issue whether the decedent was a party to a common-law marriage.Â  If the existence of a common-law marriage is itself the ultimate issue, then the family court has exclusive jurisdiction. Â Cf. Neely v. Thomasson, 365 S.C. 345, 350-51, 618 S.E.2d 884, 887-88 (2005) (recognizing the difference between jurisdiction over an action and jurisdiction over an issue, and holding that although section 20-7-420(7)[4] vests the family court with exclusive jurisdiction over actions to determine paternity, under section 62-1-302(a)(1) the probate court has jurisdiction to resolve the issue of paternity when the issue is essential to the probate courtâ€™s determination of heirs). \r\nHere, Appellant brought an action for a declaration that he and Ella Mae McGriff were in a common-law marriage on the date of Ella Maeâ€™s death.Â  Appellant admits that he might seek to utilize the declaration, if the family court makes it, to claim in the probate court that he is an heir of Ella Mae.Â  While it would have been more judicially economical for Appellant to claim heirship in the probate court and allow the probate court to resolve the common-law-marriage issue, nothing prohibited Appellant from first bringing this action in the family court.Â  The family court therefore erred in dismissing the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family court has exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction to determine an action for a declaration that a common-law marriage exists or existed.Â  The probate court has exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction to determine heirs, which might involve the issue whether a common-law marriage existed.Â  Whether the family court or probate court has jurisdiction over the issue of common-law marriage depends on the nature of the action in which the issue arises.Â  Here, Appellantâ€™s action is for a declaration that he and Ella Mae McGriff were parties to a common-law marriage on the date of Ella Maeâ€™s death.Â  Appellant does not now seek a determination that he is an heir of Ella Maeâ€™s estate.Â  Consequently, the family court has exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction over Appellantâ€™s action.Â  We therefore reverse the dismissal of the action and remand the case to the family court for further proceedings.Â  \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice J.

McIntosh,\r\nAssistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey A. Jacobs, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT: Â Jeroid John Price (Appellant) was convicted of the murder of Carl Smalls and was sentenced to thirty-five years imprisonment.Â  Appellant appeals and this Court certified the case for review from the Court of Appeals, pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn December 6, 2002, Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity hosted a party at Club Voodoo in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  During the party, a confrontation between rival gangs, the Bloods and the Crips, occurred.Â  Appellant, who conceded he was affiliated with the Bloods, and Smalls, a member of the Crips, confronted each other. Â \r\nAround 2:00 a.m. on December 7, the party ended.Â  Ryan Brooks retrieved a semi-automatic pistol from his car to protect himself and\r\nAppellant retrieved a pistol from his car for protection while his friends counted the money collected at the door that night.Â  Derrick Watson testified around 2:00 a.m. Smalls asked him for a gun, but Watson did not have one.Â  \r\nBrooks saw Appellant and Smalls talking in the club.Â  He testified Appellant reached towards his own waist and Smalls rushed Appellant; the two men struggled over Appellantâ€™s pistol.Â  During the struggle, the pistol was pointed towards Brooks, who fired his own gun and shot Smalls.Â  After firing his weapon, Brooks ran out of the club and heard more gunshots.[1] Â \r\nMarcus Jones heard the first gunshot and saw the victim on the ground.Â  He then saw two more shots and described the gunfire as â€œcoming straight down.â€Â  Jones testified the victim did not appear to have a gun and the gunman did not appear to be in danger.Â  He later identified Appellant as the gunman.Â  \r\nInvestigator James Richardson was qualified as an expert in gangs and gang activity.Â  Richardson testified about the history of the Bloods and the Crips, gang activities in Columbia, gang clothing, and gang hand signals.Â  During direct examination, Richardson testified Appellant was a member of the Bloods and was a supreme or officer within the gang.Â  \r\nThe trial judge overruled defense counselâ€™s objection to the hearsay testimony that Appellant was an officer in the Bloods.Â  On cross-examination, Richardson conceded he did not know Appellant and that his testimony regarding Appellant was based on information from informants and not on his own personal knowledge.\r\nThe State presented the following evidence seized from Appellantâ€™s apartment as part of its theory that Appellant was a member of the Bloods:Â  photographs of men, including Appellant, making Blood hand signals and wearing Blood colors; a gang code book; red clothing and hats; bullet-proof vests; and a document containing a pledge of allegiance to the United Blood Nation.Â  \r\nAppellant admitted shooting Smalls but asserted he acted in self-defense.Â  Appellant testified he was not a Blood, but he was affiliated with that gang.Â  He further testified Smalls was physically larger than him and, on the night of the shooting, Smalls attacked him without provocation.Â  He testified they struggled over his gun and during this struggle the gun discharged, wounding Smalls. \r\nThe trial judge instructed the jury on murder and self-defense.Â  Appellant was found guilty of murder, and this appeal follows.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial judge err in admitting testimony from an expert\r\nwitness in the areas of gangs and gang activity that Appellant was an officer in a gang when the expert based his testimony on\r\nstatements from informants? \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to admit or exclude testimony from an expert witness rests within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 570 S.E.2d 176 (2002); State v. Caldwell, 283 S.C. 350, 322 S.E.2d 662 (1984).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision to admit expert testimony will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Myers, 359\r\nS.C. 40, 596 S.E.2d 488 (2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support. Â State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506 (2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  Hearsay\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in admitting testimony from Investigator Richardson that Appellant was a supreme or an officer within the Bloods because the testimony was improper hearsay.Â  We agree.\r\nThe State contends the testimony was admissible under Rules 702 and 703, SCRE,[2] because, when the testimony is viewed in context, Richardson did not solely base his opinion on hearsay information.Â  This argument is without merit. Â Richardson did not testify to his expert opinion, but rather relayed information from informants.Â  \r\nHearsay is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein.Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE; State v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 451 S.E.2d 888 (1994).Â  The rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of evidence of an out of court statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception to the rule applies. Rule 802, SCRE; Simpkins v. State, 303 S.C. 364, 401 S.E.2d 142 (1991).\r\nAlthough Richardson identified items seized from Appellantâ€™s apartment as related to the Bloods (e.g., photograph with Appellant throwing a gang sign, notebook with a reference to Bloods, code book referring to the Bloods, and red clothing which is significant to the Bloods), Richardson did not testify he relied on these items in forming an opinion that Appellant was a supreme or officer in the Bloods.Â  Furthermore, Richardson testified he solely based his testimony that Appellant was a supreme on statements from informants.Â  This testimony was hearsay and was not admissible under any exception to the hearsay rule.\r\nAlthough the testimony was improperly admitted, Appellant has not demonstrated reversible error.Â  See State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (improper admission of hearsay evidence is reversible error only when the admission causes prejudice).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989); Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420 S.E.2d 834, 842 (1992). Â Where a review of the entire record establishes the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be reversed.Â  State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 531, 466 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1996).Â  \r\nDefense counsel impeached Richardsonâ€™s improper testimony by eliciting that his testimony was solely based on information from informants.Â  Also, the inadmissible hearsay testimony was merely cumulative.Â  See State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003) (admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) (any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence is harmless).Â  Brooks testified Appellant was a Blood.Â  Further, Lieutenant James Smith testified bullet-proof vests were seized from Appellantâ€™s apartment and Richardson properly testified officers within gangs may have bullet-proof vests.Â  After reviewing the entire record, we find the improper admission of hearsay testimony that Appellant was an officer in the Bloods was harmless.\r\nB.Â  Confrontation Clause\r\nAppellant also argues Richardsonâ€™s testimony violated his right to confront witnesses under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Â§ 14, of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  This issue is not preserved for appellate review because Appellant did not properly raise the issue in the trial court.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe admission of Richardsonâ€™s testimony that Appellant was a supreme or officer within the Bloods was harmless error and we affirm Appellantâ€™s conviction.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Brooks was also charged with the murder of Smalls.Â  \r\n[2] Rule 702, SCRE, states: \r\nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the\r\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training,\r\nor education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.Â  \r\nRule 703, SCRE, provides: \r\nThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an\r\nopinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the&nbsp; expert at or before the hearing.

all of her papers related to the bankruptcy were located in respondentâ€™s office.Â  Respondent also possessed important documents regarding Complainant Aâ€™s deceased parentsâ€™ estates, their wills, and the deed to their property.Â  Â Â \r\nComplainant A attempted to contact respondent on numerous occasions to obtain the documents relating to her parents and to her own bankruptcy petition.Â  Respondent did not communicate with Complainant A.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges he was in possession of the estate papers and other documents.Â  He also acknowledges his secretary informed him several times of Complainant Aâ€™s attempts to contact him.Â  Respondent states he did not adequately communicate with Complainant A because she did not fully pay him to file her Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.Â  \r\nII.\r\nComplainants B and C hired respondent to assume representation in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy which had already been filed by another attorney.Â  The complainants attempted to contact respondent on several occasions to learn the status of their case and to seek an explanation as to why the trustee might dismiss their petition.Â  Respondent asserts the new electronic filing rules and his antiquated software were the cause of part of the problems associated with the amended bankruptcy plan.Â  \r\nRespondent states he has no record of Complainants B and C contacting him with the frequency that they claim.Â  He blames his answering machine for possibly not receiving some of their messages.Â Â  Nevertheless, respondent admits he did not adequately communicate the bankruptcy process and its obligations to Complainants B and C.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nComplainant D hired respondent to represent her in a motor vehicle accident.Â  She attempted to contact respondent on numerous occasions to obtain a status report on her case.[1]\r\nIn his response to the Notice of Full Investigation, respondent essentially stated he was working on Complainant Dâ€™s case.Â  According to his records, she was still under the care of her treating physician and he asked her for updated medical bills and a wage statement.Â  Respondent did not adequately address his failure to communicate with Complainant D.Â  He now acknowledges he did not provide Complainant D with diligent representation and that he did not adequately communicate with her.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nComplainant E hired respondent to represent her minor children who were involved in a motor vehicle accident.Â  Complainant E attempted to contact respondent on many occasions to obtain the status of her childrenâ€™s case.Â  Respondent failed to communicate with respondent concerning the status of the case.Â  Complainant E resorted to personally contacting the insurance company to determine what was happening with her childrenâ€™s case.Â  \r\nIn his response to the Notice of Full Investigation, respondent indicated he had been working on the case but was unable to settle the matter since another individual injured in the accident was still being treated.Â  Respondent did not adequately address his failure to communicate with Complainant E.Â  \r\nRespondent now acknowledges he did not diligently represent Complainant E.Â  He further acknowledges he did not adequately communicate with Complainant E.Â  \r\nV.\r\nRespondent represented Complainant F in a criminal matter.Â  While in the midst of a post-conviction relief action, Complainant F contacted respondent by mail on two occasions and asked for his file.\r\nRespondent failed to surrender Complainant Fâ€™s file.Â  Respondent acknowledges he received one request from the complainant about the file and told him he would provide the file to his post-conviction relief attorney if requested by the attorney or that he would provide the file to Complainant F at the conclusion of the post-conviction relief action.Â  \r\nIn his response to the Notice of Full Investigation, respondent stated he â€œhad no objectionâ€ to sending the file to Complainant F as soon as he had an opportunity to copy the file.Â  Respondent acknowledges he failed to return Complainant Fâ€™s file in a timely fashion.Â  \r\nVI.\r\nIn 2001, Complainants G and H retained respondent to file an action in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  The case was apparently dismissed in May 2003 without the complainantsâ€™ knowledge.Â  \r\nRespondent claims he was not aware the case had been dismissed.[2]Â  Complainants G and H attempted to contact respondent on numerous occasions to obtain the status of the case, but respondent did not return their telephone calls or schedule an appointment to discuss the case.Â  Respondent now acknowledges he did not provide these complainants with competent or diligent representation and he did not adequately communicate with them concerning the status of their case.Â  \r\n_______\r\nRespondent acknowledges his extensive disciplinary history.Â  See In the Matter of Blackmon, 361 S.C. 641, 606 S.E.2d 777 (2004); In the Matter of Blackmon, 344 S.C. 83, 543 S.E.2d 559 (2001); In the Matte of Blackmon, 309 S.C. 400, 424 S.E.2d 472 (1992); In the Matter of Blackmon, 295 S.C. 333, 368 S.E.2d 465 (1988).Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly deliver to client any property client is entitled to receive); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall surrender property to which client is entitled);\r\nRule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice).\r\nÂ Finally, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for a sixty (60) day period.Â  In addition, respondent shall pay any and all costs associated with ODCâ€™s inquiry into this matter, including the court reporterâ€™s fee of $60.00.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] Complainant D states she attempted to contact respondent on more than one hundred occasions.Â  \r\n[2] Respondent states the case was dismissed due to lack of service of process which was usually handled by the magistrateâ€™s court.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Carter, of South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the grant of post-conviction relief (PCR) and now reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was convicted of first degree burglary after he broke into a home at night and barricaded himself in the bathroom.Â  When police officers arrived, respondent threatened to kill himself and the officers by spilling lamp oil and lighting it.Â  On appeal, respondentâ€™s conviction was affirmed.[1]Â  He then commenced this action for PCR.\r\nThe PCR judge granted relief on the ground trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an additional charge emphasizing that the intent to commit a crime must exist at the time of entry, and limiting the juryâ€™s consideration of intent to whether there was intent to commit the crime set forth in the indictment.[2]Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nWas counsel ineffective for failing to request an additional charge?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nFirst degree burglary is defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (2003):\r\n\r\n(A) A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling, and either:\r\n(1) when, in effecting entry or while in the dwelling or in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n  \r\n(a) is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive;Â  or\r\n  \r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n  \r\n(c) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument;Â  or\r\n  \r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n(3) the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n\r\nAt trial, in addition to defining the aggravating circumstances regarding explosives, a dangerous instrument, or entry in the nighttime, the trial judge charged the following:\r\n\r\nIâ€™m going to read from you directly from the law.Â  It says a person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein and either - and there are three other alternatives, and if any of these alternatives are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, along with entering without consent and with intent to commit a crime then that would be burglary in the first degree.Â  Again, if you find that that has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Those three alternatives are:Â  while entering or being in the dwelling or in leaving the dwelling he is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive.Â  The other is that while entering or being in the dwelling or leaving the dwelling he uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument.Â  And the third is that the entering or remaining occurred in the nighttime. . . .\r\nNow again, burglary in the first degree must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant entered the dwelling without consent.Â  It must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that when he entered, when he entered that he had intent to commit a crime therein.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThis charge adequately instructed the jury that the State must prove that the intent to commit a crime existed at the time of entry.[3]Â  Counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a more emphatic or specific charge since the charge adequately stated the elements of first degree burglary.Â  See State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000) (failure to provide specific jury instructions not error when the given instructions use proper test for determining the issues); State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989) (if the trial judge refuses to give a specific charge, there is no error if the charge given sufficiently covers substance of the request).\r\nFurther, there is no requirement that the intent element is satisfied only by proving an intent to commit the specific crime that is charged in the indictment as an aggravating circumstance.Â  The only requirement is that there be intent to commit any crime at the time of entry.Â  Cf.\r\nState v. Peterson, 336 S.C. 6, 518 S.E.2d 277 (Ct. App. 1999) (to constitute burglary it is not necessary that the intended crime be committed).Â  \r\nIn conclusion, the charge given was adequate and counsel was not ineffective for failing to request an additional charge.Â  See Cartrette v. State, 323 S.C. 15, 448 S.E.2d 53 (1994) (counsel not ineffective for failing to request additional charge covered by substance of charge given).Â  The grant of PCR is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n[1] On appeal, respondent argued he was entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal because there was no evidence he intended to commit a crime at the time he entered the dwelling.Â  The Court of Appeals agreed and reversed respondentâ€™s conviction.Â  On review of that decision, however, we found respondentâ€™s actions after he entered the house were some evidence of his intent to commit a crime.Â  State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 529 S.E.2d 526 (2000).Â  After remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of an alternative ground of appeal, respondentâ€™s conviction was affirmed in an unpublished opinion.\r\n[2] The indictment alleges that respondent did willfully and unlawfully enter a dwelling without consent and with the intent to commit a crime therein and \r\n\r\nwas armed with a deadly weapon or explosive while in the dwelling and/or used or threatened the use of a dangerous instrument while in the dwelling, and/or did enter or remain in the dwelling in the nighttime, to wit: [respondent] did pour kerosene on himself and the floor of the dwelling and threatened to light it and threatened to set responding officers on fire. . . .\r\n\r\n[3] At the PCR hearing, counsel testified that in her opinion the charge given covered this element but â€œin retrospectâ€ she wished she had asked for a more specific charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of William J.
