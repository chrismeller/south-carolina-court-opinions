Clary, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25786\r\nHeard January 7, 2004 - Filed March \r\n  1, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDeputy Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, all of Columbia, \r\n  and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER: Appellant, Richard \r\n  Benjamin Moore, was convicted of murder, armed robbery, assault with intent \r\n  to kill, and possession of a firearm during commission of a violent crime; he \r\n  was respectively sentenced to death, thirty years, ten years and five years.  \r\n  This appeal combines his direct appeal with this Court's mandatory sentencing \r\n  review pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (1985).  We affirm the convictions \r\n  and sentences. \r\nFACTS\r\nThe charges in this case stem from the \r\n  September 16, 1999, armed robbery of Nikkiâ€™s, a convenience store on Highway \r\n  221 in Spartanburg.  According to Terry Hadden, an eyewitness, Moore walked \r\n  into Nikkiâ€™s at approximately 3:00a.m. and walked toward the cooler.  Hadden \r\n  was playing a video poker machine, which he did routinely after working his \r\n  second shift job.  Hadden heard Jamie Mahoney, the store clerk, yell, â€œWhat \r\n  the hell do you think youâ€™re doing?â€  Hadden turned from the poker machine to \r\n  see Moore holding both of Mahoneyâ€™s hands with one of his hands.  Moore turned \r\n  towards Hadden, pointed a gun at  him, and told him not to move.  Moore shot \r\n  at Hadden, and Hadden fell to the floor and pretended to be dead.  After several \r\n  more shots were fired, Hadden heard the doorbell to the store ring.  He heard \r\n  Mooreâ€™s pickup truck and saw him drive off on Highway 221.  Hadden got up and \r\n  saw Mahoney lying face down, with a gun about two inches from his hand; he then \r\n  called 911.  Mahoney died within minutes from a gunshot wound through his heart.  \r\n  A money bag with $1408.00 was stolen from the store.   \r\nShortly after the incident, Deputy Bobby \r\n  Rollins patrolled the vicinity looking for the perpetrator of the crime.  Approximately \r\n  one and one-half miles from the convenience store, Deputy Rollins took a right \r\n  onto Hillside drive, where he heard a loud bang, the sound of Mooreâ€™s truck \r\n  backing into a telephone pole.  He turned his lights and saw Moore sitting in \r\n  the back of a pickup truck bleeding profusely from his left arm.  As Deputy \r\n  Rollins ordered him to the ground, Moore advised him, â€œI did it. I did it.  \r\n  I give up.  I give up.â€  A blood covered money bag was recovered from the front \r\n  seat of Mooreâ€™s pick-up truck.  The murder weapon, a .45 caliber automatic pistol, \r\n  was found on a nearby highway shortly before daylight.  \r\nMoore was tried for the crimes in October \r\n  2001.  The jury convicted him of all counts.  In a separate sentencing proceeding, \r\n  the jury recommended a sentence of death.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.\r\n         Did the trial court err \r\n  in limiting the scope of Mooreâ€™s closing argument to the guilt phase jury?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         2.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err \r\n  in limiting the scope of Mooreâ€™s closing argument to the sentencing phase jury? \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GUILT PHASE CLOSING  \r\nMoore contends he should have been permitted to \r\n  argue, to the guilt phase jury, that he was on trial for his life, and that \r\n  his life was in jeopardy.  We disagree. \r\nPrior to the opening statements of counsel in this \r\n  case, the trial court advised the jury that this was a death penalty trial which \r\n  would be bifurcated into two parts.  The jury was advised that a separate sentencing \r\n  would be held if and only if the defendant were convicted of murder.  The trial \r\n  court went on to specifically advise the jury that â€œthe purpose of my telling \r\n  you this is to emphasize that you are not to consider punishment or sentence \r\n  at this phase of the case.  You are only to determine the innocence or guilt \r\n  of the defendant based upon the evidence that will be introduced in the \r\n  trial of the case.â€          \r\nMoore did not testify \r\n  at the guilt phase of trial, but did elect to personally address the jury, pursuant \r\n  to S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-28 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2002). [1]   Moore advised the jury that \r\n  he was nervous and didnâ€™t know what to say.  He then stated, â€œAll I know is \r\n  my life is in jeopardy here a second time.â€  The stateâ€™s objection was sustained \r\n  and Moore was advised to â€œlimit yourself to the testimony and evidence. . . \r\n  they are to determine the guilt or innocence sir.â€  Moore then proceeded, â€œThe \r\n  state is seeking the death penalty on me, which means my very life is at stake.â€  \r\n  The court once again admonished Moore that the jury was simply determining guilt \r\n  or innocence at this point and to limit himself to that.  The court took a brief \r\n  recess to allow Moore to speak with his attorney, after which the court advised \r\n  him as follows: \r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Moore, I want you to understand that you certainly \r\n  have the right to make the closing argument to the jury.  Thatâ€™s provided by \r\n  for law.  But, once again, you have to do it within the confines of the testimony \r\n  and evidence that has been presented.  You cannot go beyond that.  You cannot, \r\n  since you elected not to take the stand, you cannot testify. . . . You may not \r\n  testify.  You gave that right up.  You can comment on the facts, what the evidence \r\n  has revealed in this case.  Insofar as mentioning punishment, you are not \r\n  to mention that, because we are not about that right now.  And if there \r\n  are any violations of what I am laying out at this time, you are going to stand \r\n  over here.  Then I am going to stop your argument.  And then we will proceed \r\n  into the charge on the law.  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).  Moore succinctly concluded \r\n  his argument; the jury convicted him of all counts.  Moore now asserts the trial \r\n  court committed reversible error in precluding him from commenting on the fact \r\n  that his life was at stake.  We disagree. \r\nWe have previously recognized that a capital defendantâ€™s \r\n  right to personally address the jury applies at both the guilt-or-innocence \r\n  and sentencing phases of trial.  State v. Hall, 312 S.C. 95, 439 S.E.2d \r\n  278 (1994); State v. Rodgers, 270 S.C. 285, 242 S.E.2d 215 (1978).  However, \r\n  we have not specifically addressed the parameters of that right, particularly \r\n  as it pertains to the guilt phase of a capital trial.  We find that allowing \r\n  the defendant to stress to the jury that his life is at stake during the guilt \r\n  phase of trial would mislead the jury to believe that it was permitted to consider \r\n  punishment at the guilt phase of trial.  This simply is not so; this phase of \r\n  a capital trial is limited solely to the determination of guilt or innocence.\r\nOur holding is consistent with our recent opinion \r\n  in Franklin v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 563, 552 S.E.2d 718 (2001).  In Franklin \r\n  v. Catoe, supra, we found the defendant did not knowingly waive his \r\n  statutory right to personally address the guilt phase jury.  However, we found \r\n  Franklin had demonstrated no prejudice from denial of this right, stating, â€œthis \r\n  error occurred during the guilt phase, where the jury is confined to determining \r\n  whether Franklin committed the crime, not whether he deserved the death penalty.  \r\n  Had Franklin been apprised of his right to address the jury during closing, \r\n  and had he chosen to do so, he would have been arguing for his innocence, not \r\n  pleading for his life.â€  346 S.C. at 573, 552 S.E.2d at 724.  It is patent from \r\n  this language in Franklin that a guilt phase closing argument pursuant \r\n  to Â§ 16-3-28 does not encompass the right to stress that the defendant is â€œon \r\n  trial for his life.â€  \r\nFurther, as noted previously, the trial \r\n  court here specifically instructed the jury that it was not permitted to consider \r\n  punishment at the guilt-or-innocence stage, but that, if Moore were found guilty, \r\n  there would be a second, sentencing phase of trial at which his punishment would \r\n  be determined.  We find the trial court properly limited Mooreâ€™s argument.  \r\n  See Hoeffner v. The Citadel, 311 S.C. 361, 429 S.E.2d 190 (1993) \r\n  (noting that arguments which invite the jury to base its verdict on considerations \r\n  not relevant to the merits of the case are improper); State v. Patterson, \r\n  324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997) (trial judge is allowed discretion in dealing \r\n  with the range and propriety of closing argument to the jury, and rulings on \r\n  such matters will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion).  \r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SENTENCING PHASE CLOSING  \r\nAt the sentencing phase of trial, prior to closing \r\n  arguments, the court advised Moore that he once again had the right to â€œhave \r\n  a closing argument regarding the sentence imposed. . . . and, once again, the \r\n  statement that you would make to the jury would have to be confined to the evidence \r\n  that has been presented and to the issues concerning the sentence imposed.â€  \r\n  Moore advised the trial court that he would not address the sentencing phase \r\n  jury.  \r\nMoore now asserts his waiver of the right to make \r\n  a closing argument to the sentencing jury was involuntary due to the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  admonition to him that â€œonce again, the statement that you would make to the \r\n  jury would have to be confined to the evidence that has been presented and to \r\n  the issues concerning the sentence imposed.â€  Essentially, Moore asserts this \r\n  limitation prevented him the opportunity to make a closing argument asking for \r\n  mercy and/or expressing feelings of remorse, such that his waiver of the right \r\n  to address the sentencing phase jury was not knowing and voluntary.  \r\nThis argument is procedurally \r\n  barred.  At trial, Moore did not assert that the trial judgeâ€™s comments prohibited \r\n  him from asking for mercy and/or expressing feelings of remorse; he simply advised \r\n  the court that he did not intend to address the sentencing phase jury.  His \r\n  failure to raise this contention to the trial judge precludes review of the \r\n  issue on appeal.  State v. Perez, 334 S.C. 563, 514 S.E.2d 754 (1999);  \r\n  State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 401 S.E.2d 168 (1991)(issue must be \r\n  raised to and ruled upon by trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).  \r\n\r\nMoreover, to the extent the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  comment could feasibly be viewed as limiting Mooreâ€™s ability to express remorse \r\n  to the sentencing phase jury, the matter is more appropriately addressed in \r\n  a post conviction relief (PCR) action.  As noted above, the only comment made \r\n  by the trial court was that Moore could address the sentencing jury as to â€œthe \r\n  issues concerning the sentence to be imposed.â€  This statement arguably encompasses \r\n  the right to argue remorse and mercy.  There is no further explanation of what \r\n  this sentence means, nor any objection to it.  On the present record, it is \r\n  simply impossible to determine precisely what the trial court meant by this \r\n  statement, or what Moore understood it to mean.  In the PCR context, however, \r\n  a court could analyze all the facts surrounding the trial to determine if Moore \r\n  knowingly and intelligently waived his rights under section 16-3-28.  See \r\n  Franklin v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 563, 552 S.E.2d 718 (2001)(noting that PCR process \r\n  is specifically designed to allow for an inquiry into the relevant facts surrounding \r\n  the adequacy of a defendant's information and/or waiver of rights).  Accordingly, \r\n  given the lack of objection and failure to raise the present issue at trial, \r\n  Mooreâ€™s remedy, if any, is through PCR.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nMooreâ€™s convictions and sentences are \r\n  affirmed.  The death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any \r\n  other arbitrary factor, and the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances \r\n  is supported by the evidence.  Further, the death penalty is not excessive or \r\n  disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar capital cases.  See \r\n  State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57, cert. denied, 520 \r\n  U.S. 1277 (1996); State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996), \r\n  cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1123 (1997); State v.

Appellant Dukes lost \r\n  the election to respondent Redmond by a three-vote margin.  Dukes protested, \r\n  claiming nine voters were non-residents and therefore ineligible to vote in \r\n  the municipal election under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-5-610 (Supp. 2003). [1]   The Florence County Board of Canvassers (Board) \r\n  [2]  found Dukesâ€™s protest was procedurally barred and, in any event, only \r\n  one voter had voted illegally [3]  which did not affect the result of the election.  Dukesâ€™s protest \r\n  was denied.  We reverse.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Is Dukesâ€™s protest procedurally barred\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          2.\r\n        \r\n           Were two voters whose residence is outside the city limits ineligible \r\n  to vote in the mayoral election?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.  Procedural bar\r\nThe Board found Dukesâ€™s protest was not timely because he should \r\n  have discovered before the election that the contested voters were not properly \r\n  included on the voter registration list.  Dukes contends this was error because \r\n  his protest was based on after-discovered evidence pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 7-13-810 (Supp. 2003).  We agree.\r\nSection 7-13-810 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n A candidate may protest an election in which he is a candidate \r\n  pursuant to 7-17-30 when the protest is based in whole or in part on evidence \r\n  discovered after the election.  This evidence may include, but is not limited \r\n  to, after-discovered evidence of voters who have voted in a precinct or for \r\n  a district office other than the one in which they are entitled by law to vote. \r\n  [4] \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  The evidence presented by Dukes that \r\n  voters included on the voter registration list were not in fact city residents \r\n  qualifies as after-discovered evidence under this section.  Dukesâ€™s protest \r\n  therefore is not procedurally barred.\r\n2.  Ineligible voters\r\nRicky and Danette Foshee voted in the mayoral election and testified \r\n  at the protest hearing.  They are husband and wife and reside together.  The \r\n  Foshees own two contiguous lots, one in the city on which they pay city taxes, \r\n  and one outside the city on which they do not pay city taxes.  Their actual \r\n  residence is located on the back lot which is outside the city and comprises \r\n  about four-fifths of the total property.  The front lot, which is in the city, \r\n  borders on the road and is about fifty feet deep.  The Fosheesâ€™ driveway extends \r\n  from the road to the residence on the back lot.  The Board found that because \r\n  the Fosheesâ€™ contiguous lots had a single residential use, the Foshees were \r\n  city residents.  Dukes contends this was error.\r\nThe issue of a voterâ€™s residence when his actual dwelling is on the \r\n  part of his property outside the voting district is a novel one.  We agree with \r\n  the decision of the New York court in In re: Davy, 281 A.D. 137 (N.Y. \r\n  App. Div. 1952), that a personâ€™s residence is the part of his property on which \r\n  the dwelling is actually located.  Because the Fosheesâ€™ actual residence is \r\n  outside the city limits, they were not eligible to vote in the mayoral election.\r\nThis Court will employ every reasonable presumption to sustain a \r\n  contested election; we will not set aside an election due to mere irregularities \r\n  or illegalities unless the result is changed or rendered doubtful.  George \r\n  v. Municipal Election Comm'n of City of Charleston, 335 S.C. 182, 516 S.E.2d \r\n  206 (1999).  Because three votes, including the Fosheesâ€™ two votes, were cast \r\n  illegally, and the margin of victory was only three votes, the result of this \r\n  election is rendered doubtful.  The denial of Dukesâ€™s protest is therefore \r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  Alexander S. Macaulay.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] This \r\n    section includes the requirement that an eligible voter â€œhas resided within \r\n    the corporate limits of any incorporated municipality in this State for thirty \r\n    days previous to any municipal election.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2] The City of Johnsonville transferred authority \r\n    over its municipal elections to the county election commission pursuant to \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-145 (Supp. 2003). \r\n\r\n \r\n    [3] Jared Decamps testified at the hearing that he \r\n    voted in the mayoral election although he had moved outside the city two or \r\n    three years before the election. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] This \r\n    section was amended in 1996 after our decision in Hill v. South Carolina \r\n    Election Commâ€™n, 304 S.C. 150, 403 S.E.2d 309 (1991); see also Greene \r\n    v. South Carolina Election Comm'n, 314 S.C. 449, 445 S.E.2d 451 (1994).  \r\n    In Hill, we held that discrepancies between the district where a voter \r\n    actually resided and the voterâ€™s district designation on the voter registration \r\n    list could have been discovered prior to the election and did not constitute \r\n    after-discovered evidence.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25788","title":"Wilson v.

McCann, of Charleston, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We granted certiorari to review the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ decision [1]  affirming the trial courtâ€™s exclusion \r\n  of petitionerâ€™s expert on biomechanics.  We reverse.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by affirming the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of the \r\n  videotaped deposition of petitionerâ€™s biomechanics expert?\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was a passenger in a car stopped at a red light.  A car driven by \r\n  petitioner struck respondentâ€™s car from behind.  At the time of impact, respondent, \r\n  who was sitting in the front passenger seat, was wearing his seat belt and was \r\n  leaning forward to retrieve his keys from the floorboard.\r\nRespondent initially did not seek medical treatment because he did \r\n  not believe he was injured.  Subsequently, he began experiencing pain and soreness \r\n  in his lower back.  He maintained he did not have a prior medical history of \r\n  back injuries or problems.  Respondent was treated for several months by his \r\n  general practitioner before it was discovered he had a herniated disc.  He was \r\n  then treated by Dr. Stephen Rawe, a neurosurgeon, and by Dr. Jeffrey Wingate, \r\n  an orthopedist who specializes in reconstructive surgery of the spine.  When \r\n  their initial treatment failed, surgery was performed to remove the disc and \r\n  a metal cage was inserted in its place.\r\nBoth Dr. Rawe and Dr. Wingate testified it was their opinion the \r\n  ruptured disc resulted from the collision.  Both stated respondentâ€™s position \r\n  during the collision made him more vulnerable to injury.  Dr. Rawe testified, \r\n  however, that it was his opinion respondent suffered from degenerative disc \r\n  disease prior to the accident.\r\nPetitionerâ€™s expert, Dr. Barry F. Jeffries, a radiologist, testified \r\n  respondentâ€™s herniated disc was not caused by the accident.  Dr. Jeffries opined \r\n  the herniation was a result of degenerative disc disease that predated the accident \r\n  and that the herniation could have been caused by â€œoccupational or lifestyle \r\n  habits.â€\r\nPetitioner sought to introduce the videotaped deposition of Dr. Richard \r\n  Harding as an expert in the field of biomechanics. \r\n  [2]   Respondent objected and Dr. Hardingâ€™s testimony was proffered.\r\nAfter Dr. Harding received his medical degree from the University \r\n  of London, he worked as a family practice physician in the British Royal Air \r\n  Force.  While in the Air Force, he obtained his Ph.D. in human physiology and \r\n  was appointed as a consultant in aerospace medicine.  Since 1995, he has been \r\n  working as a consultant at Biodynamics Research Corporation (BRC).  BRC provides \r\n  consulting services in the field of biomechanics and, specifically, in the study \r\n  of vehicle impacts.\r\nDr. Harding further testified he is a qualified biomechanic because \r\n  he has a strong background in aerospace medicine, which is founded in biomechanics, \r\n  and because he has a background in physiology.  Dr. Harding testified he had \r\n  expertise in the application of physics to an understanding of the human response \r\n  to impacts or events.\r\n&nbsp;Dr. Harding testified he co-authored a published paper entitled â€œThe \r\n  Biomechanics of Whiplash,â€ and a chapter, which at the time of the deposition \r\n  was not published, on the same subject.  He stated he has attended two traffic \r\n  accident reconstruction conferences.  He further stated he has conducted over \r\n  800 impact and injury causation analyses, and has been qualified as an expert \r\n  in the field of biomechanics in other states.\r\nIn the instant case, Dr. Harding reviewed the depositions of respondentâ€™s \r\n  physicians, Dr. Jeffries, and respondent.  He also reviewed the pleadings and \r\n  answers to interrogatories, photographs of the vehicles, the accident report, \r\n  and the repair cost estimates of both vehicles.  He also reviewed respondentâ€™s \r\n  medical records.\r\nA review of the materials, combined with his knowledge of independent \r\n  testing by Consumer Reports and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety on \r\n  the types of vehicles involved, led Dr. Harding to conclude the delta V [3]  on the vehicle in which respondent was a passenger, \r\n  was no greater than five miles per hour and the impact came from directly behind.  \r\n  Dr. Harding stated the force was not of sufficient magnitude or direction to \r\n  cause respondentâ€™s herniated disc.\r\nTo determine what happened during the accident, Dr. Harding stated \r\n  he relied upon the impact analysis, which gave him a magnitude of the impact \r\n  and the direction, and he also relied upon respondentâ€™s description of how he \r\n  was positioned during the impact.  Dr. Harding stated the fact respondent was \r\n  leaned over would increase his risk of musculoskeletal injury in his neck and \r\n  his risk of developing a muscle strain from top to bottom in his back, but would \r\n  not increase his risk of having a herniated disc.  To have a herniated disc, \r\n  he stated, there has to be a combination of top-to-bottom loading associated \r\n  with some rotation at the same time.  Dr. Harding concluded the forces as they \r\n  occurred in the accident were not appropriate to produce a herniated disc.  \r\n  He believed other activities which respondent engaged in after the accident \r\n  could have caused his injury, such as sneezing, moving a cabinet, or working \r\n  on his vehicle.\r\nThe trial court concluded Dr. Harding was qualified regarding medical \r\n  matters, but not regarding biomechanics.  The court excluded the testimony pursuant \r\n  to Rule 403, SCRE, because the testimony would be confusing to the jury.  A \r\n  majority of the Court of Appeals found there was evidence to support the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision.\r\nJudge Shuler, in a well-reasoned dissent, found there was no evidence \r\n  to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Dr. Hardingâ€™s proposed testimony would \r\n  be confusing to the jury.  Judge Shuler found the exclusion of Dr. Hardingâ€™s \r\n  testimony prejudiced petitioner, who offered it to support his defense that \r\n  the low-speed, low-impact accident could not have caused respondentâ€™s back injury, \r\n  the major dispute at trial.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision to exclude Dr. Hardingâ€™s expert testimony.\r\nThe test for qualification of an expert is a relative one that is dependent \r\n  on the particular witnessâ€™s reference to the subject.  Lee v. Seuss, \r\n  318 S.C. 283, 457 S.E.2d 344 (1995) (finding trial court erred by finding plastic \r\n  reconstructive surgeon unqualified to give expert opinion in field of family \r\n  practice because limited exposure of surgeon to field of family practice merely \r\n  goes to weight of testimony and not its admissibility).\r\nRule 702, SCRE, provides that a witness qualified as an expert may \r\n  testify when scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist \r\n  the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.  \r\n  However, even if an expertâ€™s testimony is admissible under the rules, the trial \r\n  court may exclude the testimony if its probative value is outweighed by the \r\n  danger of, among other things, unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or \r\n  misleading the jury.  Rule 403, SCRE.\r\nThe trial court abused its discretion by not qualifying Dr. Harding \r\n  as an expert in biomechanics.  See Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. \r\n  392, 570 S.E.2d 176 (2002) (trial courtâ€™s ruling to exclude or admit expert \r\n  testimony will not be disturbed on appeal absent clear abuse of discretion).  \r\n  Dr. Hardingâ€™s specialized knowledge would assist the jury to determine the facts \r\n  in issue.  Further, he was better qualified than the jury to evaluate the force \r\n  of a moving vehicle on the human body.  See id. (for court to \r\n  find witness competent to testify as expert, witness must be better qualified \r\n  than jury to form opinion on particular subject of testimony).  \r\nAlthough Dr. Harding did not have a degree in biomechanics, he was a medical \r\n  doctor with a doctorate in human physiology and training in biomechanics and \r\n  he had been qualified as an expert in the field of biomechanics in other states.  \r\n  Any defects in the amount of his education and experience, if any, go to the \r\n  weight of his testimony and not its admissibility.  See Lee v. Seuss, \r\n  supra (generally, defects in amount and quality of education and experience \r\n  go to weight of expertâ€™s testimony and not its admissibility).  Dr. Harding \r\n  was qualified to render an opinion on the forces created by an impact and on \r\n  the general effects on the human body caused by such forces and, because Dr. \r\n  Harding is a medical doctor, an opinion regarding the cause of respondentâ€™s \r\n  particular medical problems.  See, e.g., Smelser v. Norfolk Southern \r\n  Ry. Co., 105 F.3d 299 (6th Cir. 1997) [4]  (biomechanics expert qualified to render opinion \r\n  on forces generated in rear-end collision and to speak generally about types \r\n  of injuries forces would generate, but because not medical doctor, testimony \r\n  about plaintiffâ€™s specific injuries were beyond expertise); Dorsett v. American \r\n  Isuzu Motors, Inc., 805 F. Supp. 1212 (E.D. Pa. 1992) (expert qualified \r\n  to opine plaintiff injured when head came in contact with vehicle roof during \r\n  rollover accident where expert testified work in Navy related to biomechanics, \r\n  specifically to cause of skull fractures, and where lectured on biomechanics \r\n  of vehicle impact); Maâ€™ele v. Arrington, 45 P.3d 557 (Wash. App. 2002) \r\n  (biomechanical engineer, who taught at medical school and conducted federally \r\n  funded research on low-speed collisions, properly testified as expert witness \r\n  that maximum force that could have impacted plaintiffâ€™s body does not cause \r\n  injuries).\r\nFurther, the court erred by finding Dr. Hardingâ€™s testimony should \r\n  be excluded under Rule 403 because it would be confusing to the jury.  Contrary \r\n  to the findings of the Court of Appeals, Dr. Harding did not solely rely on \r\n  the damage to the car in reaching his conclusion.  Dr. Harding considered depositions, \r\n  medical records, photographs, impact tests, and the accident report in reaching \r\n  his conclusion.  Additionally, Dr. Hardingâ€™s conclusion was based on his reliance \r\n  upon respondentâ€™s description of how he was positioned during the impact, i.e. \r\n  leaning over to retrieve his keys from the floorboard.  Dr. Harding discussed \r\n  in detail what injuries would occur as a result of this position.  Further, \r\n  Dr. Harding fully explained the method he used to reach his conclusion and did \r\n  not contradict himself.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by affirming \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision to exclude Dr. Hardingâ€™s testimony because it was \r\n  confusing.\r\nFurthermore, the probative value of Dr. Hardingâ€™s testimony outweighs \r\n  any prejudicial effect to respondent.  Dr. Harding would have testified the \r\n  low-impact collision, as it occurred, could not have caused respondentâ€™s back \r\n  injury.  Whether respondentâ€™s injury occurred due to a pre-existing degenerative \r\n  disc disease or due to the accident was the major issue at trial.  Therefore, \r\n  we reverse the opinion of the Court of Appeals. \r\n  [5] \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Wilson \r\n    v. Rivers, 350 S.C. 536, 567 S.E.2d 482 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Biomechanics \r\n    is the application of mechanics to the interaction of biological systems with \r\n    their external environment.  When investigating an accident, biomechanical \r\n    analysis can be used to reconstruct a victimâ€™s motion and relate it to his \r\n    injuries.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Dr. \r\n    Harding described the delta V, or the impact-related change in velocity, as \r\n    the difference between a vehicleâ€™s velocity before an accident and its velocity \r\n    as a consequence of the accident.  He stated the higher the delta V, the more \r\n    likely an injury will occur because the change in velocity occurs over a very \r\n    short period of time and imposes accelerations and therefore force on the \r\n    individuals in the vehicle.  He compared respondentâ€™s vehicleâ€™s delta V of \r\n    5 to being hit by a bumper car at an amusement park. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Cert. \r\n    denied, 522 U.S. 817 (1997).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Although \r\n    Dr. Harding is an expert in biomechanics, the trial court has not addressed \r\n    the question whether the underlying science of biomechanics is reliable to \r\n    determine what injuries could have been caused by this particular accident.  \r\n    See State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508, cert. denied \r\n    528 U.S. 1050 (1999) (to determine whether underlying science of expertâ€™s \r\n    testimony is reliable, court will look at several factors, including:  (1) \r\n    publications and peer review of technique; (2) prior application of method \r\n    to type of evidence involved in case; (3) quality control procedures used \r\n    to ensure reliability; and (4) consistency of method with recognized scientific \r\n    laws and procedures).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to the Rules of the Board of Law Examiners","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2004-02-20-01","description":"The Court approved the Board of Law Examiners' request to amend Section B.2(c) and B.3(b) to correspond to the special accommodations filing deadlines established by Rule 402(d)(3), SCACR.","date":"2004-03-01","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nRE: Amendment to the Rules of the Board \r\n  of Law Examiners\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEffective September 1, 2003, this \r\n  Court made extensive amendments to Rule 402, SCACR, relating to admission to \r\n  practice law.Â Â  One change established new deadlines for bar examination applicants \r\n  requesting special accommodations.Â  Rule 402(d)(3), SCACR.Â  The Board of Law \r\n  Examiners requests permission to amend its rules to reflect the new deadlines.Â   \r\n\r\nThe Boardâ€™s motion is granted.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, Section B.2(c) of the Rules of the Board of Law Examiners (contained \r\n  in Appendix A to Part IV of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules) is amended \r\n  to read:Â  â€œAn applicant must submit a written request for special testing accommodations \r\n  on forms prescribed by the Board no later than November 1st for the \r\n  February examination and April 1st for the July examination.Â  This \r\n  filing deadline may be extended upon good cause as determined by the Chairman \r\n  of the Board.â€Â Â Â   \r\nIn addition, Section B.3(b) of \r\n  the Rules of the Board of Law Examiners (contained in Appendix A to Part IV \r\n  of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules) is amended to read:Â  â€œAt the request \r\n  of a blind or sight impaired applicant, the Board may provide the examination \r\n  in braille or in large print; provided, the request is made no later than November \r\n  1st for the February exam and April 1st for the July exam.â€Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n  \t \r\n\t\r\n     \r\n      s/Jean H.

Burch, Circuit Court Judge\r\n A. Victor Rawl, Post-Conviction Relief \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25789\r\nSubmitted January 22, 2004 - Filed March \r\n  8, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney \r\n  General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nJoseph Edward Cadmus, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Respondent was convicted of entering a bank with intent \r\n  to steal, armed robbery, grand larceny, and possession of a weapon during the \r\n  commission of a crime.  The trial judge vacated the grand larceny conviction \r\n  and sentenced respondent to thirty years for armed robbery, thirty years concurrent, \r\n  for entering a bank with intent to steal, and two years consecutive, for possession \r\n  of a weapon during commission of a crime.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the \r\n  convictions and sentences.  State v. Tisdale, 338 S.C. 607, 527 S.E.2d \r\n  389 (Ct. App. 2000).  \r\nRespondent filed an \r\n  application for post-conviction relief (PCR).  The PCR court granted respondent \r\n  relief and ordered a new appeal, finding respondent received ineffective assistance \r\n  of appellate counsel.  We reverse the PCR court.  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the PCR court err in holding appellate counsel was ineffective \r\n  for failing to raise all meritorious issues on appeal?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe PCR court held that respondentâ€™s appellate counsel was ineffective \r\n  because she had an obligation to raise all meritorious issues on appeal.  We \r\n  disagree.  \r\nA defendant is entitled to effective assistance of appellate counsel.  \r\n  Southerland v. State, 337 S.C. 610, 615, 524 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1999).  \r\n  Although appellate counsel is required to provide effective assistance of counsel, \r\n  â€œappellate counsel is not required to raise every nonfrivolous issue \r\n  that is presented by the record.â€  Thrift v. State, 302 S.C. 535, 539, \r\n  397 S.E.2d 523, 526 (1990) citing Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745 (1983) \r\n  (emphasis supplied).  â€œFor judges to second-guess reasonable professional judgments \r\n  and impose onâ€¦counsel a duty to raise every â€˜colorableâ€™ claim suggested by a \r\n  client would disserve the very goal of vigorous and effective advocacyâ€¦.â€  Jones, \r\n  463 U.S. at 754.  \r\nIn the case at hand, the order granting respondent PCR stated:\r\n\r\nAppellate Counsel testified during the PCR Hearing that she made a tactical \r\n  decision to raise only two preserved issues on appealâ€¦Where counsel articulates \r\n  a valid reason for employing a certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed \r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.  However, this should not be the rule for \r\n  appellate counsel.  Effective Appellate Counsel has an obligation to raise all \r\n  meritorious issues on appeal.  The strategy of choosing one or two issues \r\n  on direct appeal when several meritorious issues exist deprives the applicant \r\n  of effective assistance of counsel.  (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nWe find that the PCR judge decided this case using an incorrect standard.  \r\n  See Thrift, 397 S.E.2d at 526; Jones, 463 U.S. at 754.  \r\n  Further, the State failed to call this error of law to the PCR judgeâ€™s attention \r\n  by way of a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion.  Therefore, due to the unusual circumstances \r\n  of this case, we reviewed the grounds that respondent claims were meritorious \r\n  but were not raised by appellate counsel.  We find no merit to respondentâ€™s \r\n  claims.  The burden of proof is on respondent to show that counselâ€™s performance \r\n  was deficient as measured by prevailing professional norms, and that respondent \r\n  was prejudiced by this deficiency.  See Strickland v. Washington, \r\n  466 U.S. 668 (1984), Southerland, 524 S.E.2d at 836.  Because respondent \r\n  is unable to prove prejudice, the PCR courtâ€™s decision is reversed.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe REVERSE the PCR courtâ€™s decision that appellate counsel was ineffective.  \r\n\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25790","title":"John Black v.

Church, of Turner, Padget, Graham &amp; Laney, \r\n  P.A., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:  We granted the \r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in \r\n  Black v. Patel, 352 S.C. 76, 562 S.E.2d 295 (Ct. App. 2002).  We affirm \r\n  as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nBy general warranty deed dated January 1, 1988, \r\n  respondent Dr. Abraham Karrottukunnel conveyed to petitioners Jagdish and Usha \r\n  Patel a tract of land for the sum of $460,000.  The general warranty deed contains \r\n  the following standard language:\r\n\r\nAnd the Grantor does hereby bind himself and his Heirs, Executors \r\n  and Administrators, to warrant and forever defend all and singular the \r\n  said premises unto the said Grantee and the Granteeâ€™s Heirs and Assigns, against \r\n  the Grantor and the Grantorâ€™s Heirs and against every person whomsoever lawfully \r\n  claiming, or to claim, the same or any part thereof.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nIn 1989, petitioners added a one-story motel building \r\n  to the property.  Plaintiffs, the heirs of a neighboring landowner, brought \r\n  the instant action for trespass and nuisance against petitioners in 1997, asserting \r\n  that the one-story building encroached on their land.  Plaintiffs sought to \r\n  demolish the encroaching portion of the building and recover from petitioners \r\n  a proportion of the rents and profits generated by the motel.\r\nPetitioners informed respondent about \r\n  the lawsuit and, pursuant to the terms of the general warranty deed, requested \r\n  he provide a defense; no response was made to their letter.  Consequently, petitioners \r\n  answered plaintiffsâ€™ complaint and brought a third-party complaint against respondent \r\n  wherein petitioners sought an order that respondent defend the action brought \r\n  by plaintiffs.  Petitioners also requested recovery of any costs, expenses and \r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees incurred by them to defend plaintiffsâ€™ lawsuit.\r\nThe case went to trial in front of a Master-in-Equity.  \r\n  Although respondent never â€œtook overâ€ the defense of the action for petitioners, \r\n  he participated at the trial as third-party defendant.  Plaintiffs presented \r\n  two surveyors on their behalf who relied primarily on courses and distances \r\n  to establish paramount title to the disputed property; respondent presented \r\n  expert testimony from his own surveyor who relied on several artificial markers \r\n  to determine that the property line was as respondent had conveyed in the deed.  \r\n  Finding artificial markers control over a survey using courses and distances, \r\n  the Master decided that petitioners successfully defended their title to the \r\n  land.\r\nIn a separate order, the Master granted \r\n  petitionersâ€™ request for costs against respondent, but denied attorneysâ€™ fees, \r\n  citing Jeter v. Glenn, 43 S.C.L. (9 Rich.) 374 (1856).  Petitioners appealed, \r\n  and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Black v. Patel, supra.  The \r\n  Court of Appeals agreed with the Master that this Courtâ€™s 1856 decision in Jeter \r\n  v. Glenn prevented it from awarding attorneysâ€™ fees to petitioners.  Petitioners \r\n  now appeal to this Court. [1] \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming \r\n  the denial of attorneysâ€™ fees?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioners argue it was error to deny \r\n  their request for attorneysâ€™ fees.  Specifically, they contend that Jeter \r\n  v. Glenn is distinguishable from the instant case because the issue here \r\n  is a breach of the duty to defend, whereas in Jeter, the issue involved \r\n  the breach of the warranty of freedom from encumbrances.  In addition, petitioners \r\n  argue that Jeter should be reconsidered and overruled because the warranty \r\n  to defend is hollow without the availability of the remedy of attorneysâ€™ fees.\r\nIn Jeter, the defendant (Glenn) \r\n  had conveyed property by a general warranty deed to Ferdinand Scaife, who in \r\n  turn later conveyed the land to the plaintiff (Jeter).  The widow of an adjoining \r\n  landowner successfully brought suit against Jeter and recovered her dower \r\n  plus costs. [2]   Jeter then sued Glenn for breach of warranty.  The jury found \r\n  in Jeterâ€™s favor and awarded him the amount of the dower, but not any costs.\r\nBoth parties appealed.  The Jeter Court \r\n  made several observations regarding the general warranty deed.  For example, \r\n  the Court stated that there are five covenants in the general warranty deed, \r\n  to wit: (1) the vendor is seised in fee (i.e., the covenant of seisin); (2) \r\n  the vendor has the right to convey; (3) the vendee, his heirs and assigns, shall \r\n  quietly enjoy; (4) the property is free from all encumbrances; and (5) the covenant \r\n  for further assurances.  In addition, the Court noted the following regarding \r\n  the warranty to defend:\r\n\r\nBut taking our general warranty according to its words, \r\n  without any reference to the usual covenants for title, and interpreting the \r\n  word warrant according to its modern sense, we see that a covenant â€œto warrant \r\n  and forever defend all and singular the premises against all persons lawfully \r\n  to claim the same or any part thereof,â€ binds the covenantor to defend every \r\n  portion of the land conveyed, against all suits of which due notice shall be \r\n  given to him, and in case of the lawful eviction of the vendee or his assigns, \r\n  to pay the legal damages occasioned thereby.\r\n\r\nJeter, 9 Rich. at 379.\r\nFinding that Jeterâ€™s right to quietly enjoy his \r\n  land and to be free from encumbrances had been breached, the Jeter Court \r\n  affirmed the decision in favor of Jeter.  As to Jeterâ€™s claims for costs and \r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees, the Court agreed he was entitled to costs, but not to \r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees, stating there was â€œno authority for including counsel fees \r\n  in the damages recoverable upon contracts.â€  Id. at 380-81.\r\nAs to petitionersâ€™ argument \r\n  that Jeter is distinguishable from their case because this is one based \r\n  upon the general warranty to defend, the Court of Appeals refused to â€œread Jeter \r\n  so narrowly.â€  Black v. Patel, 352 S.C. at 79, 572 S.E.2d at 297.  The \r\n  Court of Appeals found Jeter was not distinguishable on this basis, and \r\n  we agree.\r\nPetitioners also argue that \r\n  the law set out in Jeter is antiquated and inequitable and therefore \r\n  should be overruled.  On the contrary, however, the analysis apparently used \r\n  by the Jeter Court appears to reflect the general rule today:  attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.  E.g., \r\n  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997).  In the instant \r\n  case, the â€œcontractâ€ at issue is the general warranty deed, and thus we must \r\n  determine whether, under the language of the deed, attorneysâ€™ fees are authorized. [3] \r\nThe general rule for cases \r\n  in this context is that only â€œlawfulâ€ - that is, successful - claims \r\n  asserted against title justify an award of attorneysâ€™ fees where the covenantor \r\n  has failed to defend.  See Outcalt v. Wardlaw, 750 N.E.2d 859, \r\n  863 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001) (â€œBecause the covenant of warranty does not protect \r\n  against every adverse claim, â€˜the covenantee is not entitled to demand of his \r\n  covenantor expenses incurred in the defense of a suit which sustains the conveyed \r\n  title as valid.â€™â€) (citation omitted); 20 Am.Jur.2d Covenants Â§Â§ 139, \r\n  140 (1995) (reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees are recoverable in an unsuccessful \r\n  attempt to defend the title to the premises); 21 C.J.S. Covenants Â§ 22 \r\n  (1990) (â€œA covenant of warranty in a deed has been defined as â€¦ an obligation \r\n  to defend and protect the covenantee against any rightful claims and \r\n  demands.â€) (footnotes omitted, emphasis added); see also id. \r\n  at Â§ 60(b).  The covenantor must, of course, have been notified of the action \r\n  and have failed to defend.  See Outcalt, 750 N.E.2d at 863; 20 \r\n  Am.Jur.2d Covenants Â§ 140; see also 21 C.J.S. Covenants \r\n  Â§ 60(c) (liability of covenantor is generally dependent on giving proper notice \r\n  of the litigation). [4]   \r\nWe believe this rule makes \r\n  logical sense.  First, the covenantor has not conveyed bad title in any way, \r\n  so it seems unfair to shift the burden of the costs of defense to him.  Moreover, \r\n  if the covenantor decides against taking over a defense of title after being \r\n  notified of litigation, that is his risk to bear because if title is unsuccessfully \r\n  defended by the covenantee, then the covenantor would be liable for breach of \r\n  the general warranty deed.  \r\nSecond, and more importantly, \r\n  the language in the general warranty deed itself (which is based upon state \r\n  statute) compels application of this rule.  The general warranty deed specifically \r\n  states that the duty to defend goes to defending only against those people â€œlawfully \r\n  claimingâ€ the land.  The court in Outcalt held that â€œin the context \r\n  of the covenant of warranty, a â€˜lawful claimâ€™ necessarily means a successful \r\n  claim.â€  Outcalt, 750 N.E.2d at 864.  We agree that in this context, \r\n  the language that a claim to title must be â€œlawfulâ€ in order to trigger the \r\n  duty to defend indicates that the duty extends only to claims which are ultimately \r\n  successful.  Cf. Murchie v. Hinton, 848 S.W.2d 436 (Ark. Ct. App. \r\n  1993) (where the court allowed appellant attorneysâ€™ fees after successfully \r\n  defending her title since the covenant to warrant and defend specifically \r\n  stated that â€œall claims whateverâ€ would be defended).  In \r\n  other words, a covenant of warranty simply â€œdoes not protect against every unfounded \r\n  adverse claim.â€  20 Am.Jur.2d Covenants Â§ 139 (emphasis added).  \r\nAccordingly, we find that \r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees were correctly denied to petitioners since title was successfully \r\n  defended against plaintiffsâ€™ claims. [5] \r\nNonetheless, petitioners argue there is South Carolina \r\n  precedent that establishes a duty to defend any claim of paramount title.  \r\n  See Greer v. McFadden, 295 S.C. 14, 366 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App. 1988).  \r\n  We disagree.  \r\nIn Greer v. McFadden, the Court of Appeals \r\n  stated the following:\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that Greer gave McFadden notice of the prior \r\n  suit and demanded that he come in and defend.  And it is the general law of \r\n  the land that whenever an action is brought upon a paramount claim against any \r\n  person who is entitled to the benefit of a general warranty deed, for the grantee \r\n  of the general warranty deed to give proper notice to his grantor of the pendency \r\n  of the suit, requiring him to come in and defend it, and thus to relieve himself \r\n  from the burden of proving, in an action for the breach of the covenant, the \r\n  validity of the alleged paramount claim.  See 21 C.J.S. Covenants \r\n  Section 89 (1940) and the cases therein cited.  The purpose of the notice is \r\n  that the grantor of a general warranty deed shall understand that a suit is \r\n  pending asserting a superior title to the one he has warranted, and by which \r\n  it is or may be in peril, and to inform him that it is for the recovery of the \r\n  property he sold and that he is thereby called on to defend the title.\r\n\r\nGreer, 295 S.C. at 19, 366 S.E.2d at 266.\r\nWhile this language in Greer does \r\n  seem to state there is an absolute duty to defend any claim of paramount title, \r\n  we note the Court of Appeals in Greer also emphasized that the obligation \r\n  to defend under the general warranty deed was against lawful claims.  \r\n  Id.  Furthermore, Greer is both legally and factually distinguishable \r\n  from the instant case.  First, it did not deal with what was the appropriate \r\n  measure of damages allowed by a breach of this duty.  As we have just discussed, \r\n  this damages question is controlled by whether title is successfully defended.  \r\n  Second, the Greer court concluded its discussion about the duty to defend \r\n  by stating that the covenantor was â€œbound by the resultsâ€ of the lawsuit between \r\n  the third party and the covenantee where the third party prevailed.  \r\n  Id. at 20, 366 S.E.2d at 267.  In other words, the facts of Greer \r\n  involved a prior suit where paramount title had been established, which is not \r\n  the instant case. Thus, Greer is unavailing to petitioners. \r\n  [6]&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we follow the general rule that \r\n  where a covenantee successfully defends title, he is not entitled to attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees from the covenantor.  Consequently, the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision affirming \r\n  the denial of attorneysâ€™ fees is\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice James R. Barber, III., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The amount of attorneysâ€™ fees at issue is $24,119.02.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The facts of Jeter indicate that the widow â€œvouchedâ€ Glenn \r\n    â€œto defend the suit,â€ but it is not clear whether he participated in any way \r\n    in the widowâ€™s lawsuit.  As the Court of Appeals noted, â€œvouching inâ€ is a \r\n    common law procedural device which has now been replaced by third-party practice.  \r\n    See Black v. Patel, 352 S.C. at 79 n.2, 572 S.E.2d at 297 n.2.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]   We note the language in the general warranty deed is based upon \r\n    state statute.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-7-10 (1991).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  There are exceptions to this rule, for example, where it is the wrongful \r\n    act of the covenantor which causes the covenantee to be in litigation with \r\n    the third party, then the covenantor would be liable for costs despite the \r\n    fact that the covenantee prevailed.  Outcalt, 750 N.E.2d at 864; 21 \r\n    C.J.S. Covenants Â§ 60(a).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  We note that the Jeter Court actually deviated from the general \r\n    rule.  As stated above, Jeter unsuccessfully defended title in the \r\n    lawsuit with the widow.  While the Court awarded costs, it did not allow Jeter \r\n    to recover his attorneysâ€™ fees from Glenn.  Therefore, to the extent Jeter \r\n    is inconsistent with our holding in the instant case, it is hereby overruled.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  In any event, we note that under the somewhat unusual facts of the \r\n    instant case, respondent was brought into the case as a third party defendant \r\n    and actually participated in the defense of title by providing his own surveyor \r\n    at trial.  This testimony proved crucial to petitionersâ€™ success in defending \r\n    title.  Therefore, to some extent, respondent did â€œrelieveâ€ petitioners of \r\n    â€œthe burdenâ€ of proving their valid title.  Greer, 295 S.C. at 19, \r\n    366 S.E.2d at 266.  Stated differently, respondent ultimately provided a meaningful \r\n    defense of the premises he had conveyed against plaintiffsâ€™ claims to paramount \r\n    title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25791","title":"Cowan v.

Defense Trial Attorneyâ€™s Association.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES: In 1993, the Court of Appeals \r\n  held that an insuredâ€™s violation of a cooperation clause in his insurance policy \r\n  did not void the policy as to an innocent third party, to the extent the policy \r\n  provided statutory minimum limits coverage.  Shores v. Weaver, 315 S.C. \r\n  347, 433 S.E.2d 913 (Ct. App. 1993) cert. denied March 18, 1994.  In \r\n  1997, the legislature amended many of the automobile insurance statutes, and \r\n  adopted Â§ 38-77-142, effective March 1, 1999.\r\n We granted certiorari to consider a Court of Appealsâ€™ decision holding that \r\n  Â§ 38-77-142(B) (2002) modified the holding in Shores. Cowan v. Allstate \r\n  Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 626, 571 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App. 2002).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent (Allstate) \r\n  issued an automobile liability policy to Griffis.  Griffis permitted Johnson \r\n  to drive the car. [1]   While Johnson was operating Griffisâ€™ car, she was involved \r\n  in an accident with petitioners.  Petitioners sued Johnson, who failed to answer.  \r\n  Johnson was subsequently held in default.\r\nThe summons and complaint \r\n  in the Johnson suit were filed October 13, 1999, and served on Johnson on December \r\n  13, 1999.  On October 22, 1999, petitionersâ€™ law firm notified Allstate that \r\n  it represented petitioners with regard to the Johnson accident; on November \r\n  11, 1999, Allstate acknowledged receipt of the representation letter and informed \r\n  petitionersâ€™ firm which adjusters were handling the file.  The October letter \r\n  to Allstate did not mention that a summons and complaint had been filed but \r\n  not yet served.  In fact, the pleadings were not served on Johnson until more \r\n  than a month after Allstateâ€™s response to the letter of representation.  \r\nIn April 2000, petitioners moved for a default judgment \r\n  in the Johnson suit, and a default order was filed in May 2000.  In June 2000, \r\n  petitionersâ€™ attorney notified Johnson of the damages hearing scheduled for \r\n  July 5, 2000.  Following that hearing, a default judgment was filed July 11, \r\n  2000. Allstateâ€™s first notice of the Johnson suit and judgment was a letter \r\n  from petitionersâ€™ attorney requesting payment of the judgment.  That letter \r\n  is dated August 11, 2000.  Allstate refused to pay.\r\nPetitioners then brought this declaratory judgment action seeking \r\n  an order declaring that Allstate was liable for the judgment. [2]   Allstate denied liability, citing \r\n  Â§ 38-77-142(B), contending that Johnsonâ€™s failure to give it notice of the filing \r\n  of the suit, of the default motion, and of the damages hearing relieved it of \r\n  responsibility for the judgment under this statute.\r\nPetitioners and Allstate filed cross-motions for summary judgment \r\n  in the declaratory judgment action.  The trial court granted Allstateâ€™s motion, \r\n  finding it had no obligation to pay the Johnson judgment in light of Â§ 38-77-142(B), \r\n  which it held modified Shores v. Weaver.  Petitioners appealed, and the \r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\nDoes Â§ 38-77-142(B) relieve an insurance company of its obligation under Shores \r\n  v. Weaver to pay a judgment up to the minimum limits where its insured failed \r\n  to notify the company of the suit and/or motion for judgment?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn Shores v. Weaver, the Court of Appeals held that â€œa liability \r\n  insurance policy required by statute before one can register a motor vehicle \r\n  may not be defeated or voided after a loss by the insuredâ€™s failure to forward \r\n  to the insurer the pleadings in an action brought against the insured by a third \r\n  party victim of the insuredâ€™s negligence.â€  Id. at 351, 433 S.E.2d at \r\n  915.  The Court held that since South Carolina was a mandatory insurance state, \r\n  public policy required that an insuredâ€™s failure to cooperate not void mandatory \r\n  minimum coverage for an innocent third party.\r\nApproximately four years \r\n  later, the General Assembly enacted Â§ 38-77-142, effective March 1, 1999.  This \r\n  statute, entitled â€œPolicies or contracts of bodily injury or property damage \r\n  liability insurance covering liability; required provisionsâ€ includes the following \r\n  sentence:\r\n\r\nIf an insurer has actual notice of a motion for \r\n  judgment or complaint having been served on an insured, the mere failure of \r\n  the insured to turn the motion or complaint over to the insurer may not be a \r\n  defense to the insurer, nor void the endorsement or provision, nor in any way \r\n  relieve the insurer of its obligations to the insured, provided the insured \r\n  otherwise cooperates and in no way prejudices the insurer.\r\nÂ§ 38-77-142(B).\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  held that while this statutory language addressed only the situation where the \r\n  insurance company has actual knowledge of the suit, it clearly implied that \r\n  where neither the insured nor the innocent third party gave notice to the company, \r\n  a cooperation clause was enforceable against that third party.  Cowan v. \r\n  Allstate Ins. Co., supra.  The Court found that in enacting this \r\n  statute, the legislature balanced the rights of the innocent third party against \r\n  those of the uninformed insurance company, and created an incentive for the \r\n  third party to inform the insurer of the suit, and to keep it informed of the \r\n  suitâ€™s status. Id.\r\nWe disagree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ interpretation of Â§ 38-77-142(B).  \r\n  In plain and ordinary terms, this sentence in Â§ 38-77-142(B) governs only the \r\n  relationship between an insurer and its insured.  It provides that despite an \r\n  insuredâ€™s failure to comply with a cooperation clause requiring him to forward \r\n  pleadings, the insurer must honor all its obligations under the policy if it \r\n  has actual notice of those pleadings.  The sentence also provides that if the \r\n  insured fails to cooperate in other ways to the prejudice of the insurance company, \r\n  those acts may relieve the company â€œof its obligation to the insured.â€  \r\n  (emphasis supplied).\r\nOur construction of the sentence involves only the two entities \r\n  named in it: the insured and the insurer.  The trial court and the Court of \r\n  Appeals exceeded the bounds of statutory construction when they inverted the \r\n  statute and interpolated the term â€˜third partyâ€™ into it.  Further, by its terms, \r\n  the statute is intended to deal with an insuredâ€™s â€œmere failureâ€¦to turn the \r\n  motion or complaint over to the insurerâ€¦.â€  By providing that actual notice \r\n  is sufficient, the statute effects a â€œcommon senseâ€ resolution where, for example, \r\n  an insured notifies its insurer by phone, but neglects to forward the pleadings. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that Â§ 38-77-142(B) does not impact the holding in Shores \r\n  v. Weaver, supra.  We reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision affirming \r\n  the trial court order granting Allstate summary judgment on that basis.

Thayer Rivers, Jr., of Ridgeland, \r\n  for petitioner.\r\nW. Hugh McAngus, of McAngus, Goudelock &amp; Courie, LLC, of Columbia, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MOORE:  We granted this \r\n  writ of certiorari to determine whether the Court of Appeals erred by affirming \r\n  the workersâ€™ compensation commissionâ€™s denial of benefits. [1]   We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner was injured in a single car accident while driving one of  respondentsâ€™ \r\n  (Morris Roofing) trucks to work from his home to a job site.  He filed a workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation claim. \r\nAt the hearing, petitioner testified he often drove one of Morris \r\n  Roofingâ€™s vehicles to and from work, but sometimes he was a passenger in a Morris \r\n  Roofing van.  Morris Roofing subtracted thirty-five dollars from his paycheck \r\n  every week for transportation, regardless of whether he was allowed to drive \r\n  a company vehicle home or whether he was transported in a company vehicle.\r\nGeorge Morris (George), one of the owners of Morris Roofing, testified petitioner \r\n  was not supposed to take the truck home the night before the accident.  He testified \r\n  petitioner called him the day before the accident and acknowledged that Paul \r\n  Morris (Paul), the other owner of Morris Roofing, told petitioner he could not \r\n  take the truck home.  Petitioner told George that Paul instructed him not to \r\n  take the truck home anymore because he was late almost every day.  George testified \r\n  he told petitioner he would not contravene Paulâ€™s orders.  When petitioner was \r\n  finished working, he was supposed to report to another job site and someone \r\n  from that location would have driven him home with the rest of the employees.  \r\n  George testified petitioner never showed up at the other job site, though the \r\n  workers at the site waited for him.  Paul and a former Morris Roofing employee \r\n  corroborated Georgeâ€™s testimony.         \r\nThe full commission affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s decision finding \r\n  that, at the time of the accident, petitioner was not within the scope of his \r\n  employment because he violated an order not to take the company truck.  The \r\n  circuit court and the Court of Appeals affirmed the full commission.  \r\nISSUE I\r\n\r\nDid petitioner leave the scope of his employment by violating orders not to \r\n  drive a company vehicle home?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn a workersâ€™ compensation case, the full commission is the ultimate fact-finder.  \r\n  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000).  It is not \r\n  the task of this Court to weigh the evidence as found by the full commission \r\n  and we must affirm the findings of fact made by the commission if they are supported \r\n  by substantial evidence.  Id.; McCraw v. Mary Black Hosp., 350 \r\n  S.C. 229, 565 S.E.2d 286 (2002).  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla \r\n  of evidence, but is evidence that, considering the record as a whole, would \r\n  allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.  Id.  \r\n  The question of whether an accident arises out of and is in the course and scope \r\n  of employment is largely a question of fact for the full commission.  Wright \r\n  v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 314 S.C. 152, 442 S.E.2d 186 (Ct. App. 1994).  \r\nThe controlling question \r\n  in this case is whether petitioner left the scope of his employment by violating \r\n  his employerâ€™s direct instructions not to drive the company vehicle home.  When \r\n  an employer limits the scope of employment by specific prohibitions, injuries \r\n  incurred while violating these prohibitions are not in the scope of employment \r\n  and, therefore, not compensable.  Wright, supra (citing Black \r\n  v. Town of Springfield, 217 S.C. 413, 60 S.E.2d 854 (1950)).  Here, the \r\n  substantial evidence establishes petitioner left the scope of his employment \r\n  by violating the specific order not to drive the company vehicle home.  Accordingly, \r\n  the full commission did not err by finding petitionerâ€™s injuries not compensable.  \r\n  See Wright, supra (grocery baggerâ€™s death not compensable \r\n  where bagger violated employerâ€™s prohibition against approaching or apprehending \r\n  suspected shoplifters); Black, supra (police chiefâ€™s death not \r\n  compensable where police chief violated Cityâ€™s express prohibition against riding \r\n  a fire truck). [2] \r\nISSUE \r\n  II\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by holding Morris Roofing did not provide \r\n  transportation to its employees? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe full commission and \r\n  the Court of Appeals found Morris Roofing did not provide transportation to \r\n  petitioner because petitioner was required to pay for that transportation.  \r\n  These rulings are in error.\r\nAs a general rule, an employee \r\n  going to or coming from the place where his work is to be performed is not engaged \r\n  in performing any service growing out of and incidental to his employment and, \r\n  therefore, an injury sustained by accident at such time does not arise out of \r\n  and in the course of his employment.  Medlin v. Upstate Plaster Service, \r\n  329 S.C. 92, 495 S.E.2d 447 (1998).  However, where, in going to and returning \r\n  from work, the employer provides the means of transportation, the employee is \r\n  within the scope of his employment.  Id.  The question is whether the \r\n  fact petitioner paid Morris Roofing $35 a week for the use of or for transportation \r\n  in one of the company vehicles means that Morris Roofing was â€œproviding the \r\n  means of transportationâ€ such that petitionerâ€™s injuries could have been compensable \r\n  had he not left the scope of his employment by driving the truck against his \r\n  employerâ€™s specific instructions.\r\nThe decision of the Court \r\n  of Appeals improperly suggests that, even if an employer charges an employee \r\n  a nominal fee for transportation to and from work, that employee is not covered \r\n  under workersâ€™ compensation.  However, if an employer does not charge for transportation, \r\n  the employee is covered.                  \r\nAccording to Larsonâ€™s \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 15.01[2] (1999), when an employee pays out of \r\n  his or her own pocket for transportation furnished in the employerâ€™s own conveyance, \r\n  the employer still controls the element of risk and is liable in workersâ€™ compensation.  \r\n  The employer remains liable for the journey even though it charges the employee \r\n  an amount for the trip sufficient to cover its cost.  See 99 C.J.S. Workmenâ€™s \r\n  Compensation Â§ 441 (2000) (fact employerâ€™s charge for transportation is \r\n  deducted from employeeâ€™s wages definitely indicates connection of transportation \r\n  with contract of employment); see also Thayer v. Iowa, 653 N.W.2d \r\n  595 (Iowa 2002) (allowing workersâ€™ compensation benefits where employer provided \r\n  transportation and employees paid fee for that transportation); Securex, \r\n  Inc. v. Couto, 627 So.2d 595 (Fla. App. 1993) (rejecting argument that transportation \r\n  must be free to fall within exception to going and coming rule); Schauder \r\n  v. Pfeifer, 570 N.Y.S.2d 179 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991) (allowing workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  benefits where company furnished transportation and employees paid for transportation); \r\n  Neyland v. Maryland Casualty Co., 28 So.2d 351 (La. App. 1946) (where \r\n  employee paid employer for transportation, employee was riding as incident to \r\n  employment and was entitled to benefits); Peski v. Todd &amp; Brown, Inc., \r\n  158 F.2d 59 (7th Cir. 1946) (allowing benefits where employer furnished \r\n  transportation and employee paid for transportation).\r\nAccordingly, we hold the \r\n  Court of Appeals erred by finding that an employer does not provide the means \r\n  of transportation to an employee if that employer receives payment from the \r\n  employee for the transportation.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., and Acting Justice G.

However, at the relevant time, petitioner \r\n    still was violating his employerâ€™s instructions not to take the truck home.  \r\n    His effort to return the truck does not place him back inside the scope of \r\n    his employment.

Utecht, of Haynsworth Sinkler Boyd, P.A., of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER: \r\n  These two direct appeals arise from the same mechanicâ€™s lien case and therefore \r\n  have been combined for our review.  We affirm on both.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn Spring 1999, appellant Henry \r\n  Orr [1]  entered into an oral contract with respondent \r\n  Raby Construction for the construction/renovation of a restaurant in Greenville \r\n  to be known as the South City Grill.  The contract was a â€œcost plusâ€ agreement \r\n  whereby Orr would pay respondent, as general contractor, the actual costs of \r\n  the project, plus a 12% fee.  On September 12, 2000, Orr signed a Statement \r\n  of Account showing that the total project amount was $1,047,000 and that Orr \r\n  had already paid $810,000.  The statement expressly stated that the total amount \r\n  due was $237,000.  Both Orr, and Michael Raby, respondentâ€™s principal, signed \r\n  the document.  It is undisputed that Orr made no payments after signing the \r\n  Statement of Account.\r\nRespondent filed a mechanicâ€™s lien for \r\n  $237,000 on November 3, 2000, and in January 2001, respondent filed an action \r\n  to foreclose on the lien.  In his answer, Orr denied the allegations that $237,000 \r\n  remained due on the project.  The litigation proceeded through discovery, [2]  and trial was set for December 11, 2001.  However, on December \r\n  8, 2001, the parties entered into a settlement wherein Orr agreed to pay respondent \r\n  $150,000 by January 24, 2002.  Significantly, the settlement \r\n  provided that if the $150,000 payment was not made by that date, then a confession \r\n  of judgment would be filed for $200,000, plus interest and any attorneysâ€™ fees \r\n  incurred in connection with foreclosure of the property.  Furthermore, both \r\n  the settlement and the confession of judgment stated that Orr would not oppose \r\n  or contest any foreclosure on the property.\r\nOrr did not pay the $150,000 settlement amount, \r\n  and an order of judgment for $200,000 was entered in February 2002.  Shortly \r\n  thereafter, the trial court issued an order of foreclosure which required Orr \r\n  to pay $200,000, plus interest, as well as attorneysâ€™ fees in the amount of \r\n  $15,000.\r\nOn April 4, 2002, Orr filed a motion pursuant \r\n  to Rule 60(b)(2) and (3), SCRCP, to vacate the orders of judgment and foreclosure.  \r\n  Orr alleged that relief from the orders was warranted because they were the \r\n  product of respondentâ€™s fraud and misconduct, and also because of after-discovered \r\n  evidence.  The Rule 60(b) motion was based on a sworn statement from Jan Bailey, \r\n  a former employee of respondent.  Bailey gave testimony that respondent had \r\n  failed to produce computer records related to the South City Grill, including \r\n  evidence of bills that had not been paid by respondent, and that she had fabricated \r\n  backup documentation that was produced to Orr.\r\nBailey worked for respondent from November \r\n  1999 until January 2002.  In her own words, the circumstances under which she \r\n  left respondent â€œwere very strained.â€  There is some contention as to what position \r\n  Bailey held while employed with respondent.  She, at one point, stated that \r\n  she was â€œbookkeeper, office manager, secretary, anything.â€  Raby called her \r\n  his secretary in his deposition.  Notably, however, in its response to Orrâ€™s \r\n  first set of interrogatories, respondent identified Bailey (who was formerly \r\n  known as Jan Whitfield) as follows:\r\n\r\nMs. Whitfield is an employee of [respondent], and she may \r\n  testify as to [respondentâ€™s] accounting for the South City Grill project and \r\n  the amounts owed on the project.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nThe trial court conducted \r\n  an evidentiary hearing on the Rule 60(b) motion at which both Bailey and Raby \r\n  testified at length.  The gravamen of Baileyâ€™s testimony was that the computer \r\n  records were not disclosed, they were more accurate than the manual ledgers \r\n  (which had been produced during discovery), and that the computer accounting \r\n  system revealed that respondent had overcharged Orr by at least $30,000.  According \r\n  to her own calculations based on the computer records, Bailey estimated that \r\n  Orr owed respondent just under $140,000. \r\nRaby, on the other hand, testified \r\n  that the computer accounting system was started several months after \r\n  the South City Grill project began, and therefore, the computer system was not \r\n  as accurate as the manual ledgers.  In addition, Raby stated that respondent \r\n  remained liable for the unpaid bills that the computer records indicated.\r\nThe trial court denied Orrâ€™s \r\n  motion for relief and his subsequent motion for reconsideration.  The trial \r\n  court specifically noted that the order of foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien \r\n  remained â€œin full force and effectâ€ except with certain date changes for the \r\n  auction of the property.  On July 15, 2002, Orr filed his notice of appeal from \r\n  the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.\r\nMeanwhile, the proceedings for the sale \r\n  of the property had continued pursuant to the February order of foreclosure.  \r\n  Indeed, just days before Orr filed the Rule 60(b) motion, a Contract of Sale \r\n  for the property had been executed on April 1, 2002.  After the trial court \r\n  denied the Rule 60(b) motion, Orr filed a motion to stay the judicial sale of \r\n  the property.  The sale of the property was finalized in October 2002; however, \r\n  respondent was still left with a deficiency in the judgment.  Orr then filed \r\n  a petition for appraisal in November 2002.   Respondent opposed the motion and \r\n  filed its own motion for attorneysâ€™ fees.  After a hearing, the trial court \r\n  dismissed the petition for appraisal and granted respondent additional attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees in the amount of $31,025.75.  Orr moved for reconsideration, but the motion \r\n  was denied.\r\nOrr now appeals from both the denial of \r\n  the Rule 60(b) motion and the granting of additional attorneysâ€™ fees.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court err in denying Orrâ€™s Rule 60(b) motion?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         2.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court lack jurisdiction to award additional attorneysâ€™ fees?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n1.  Rule 60(b) Motion\r\nOrr argues that the trial court erred \r\n  in denying him relief from judgment because respondent withheld documents and \r\n  fabricated evidence.  Specifically, Orr contends the trial court erred by: (1) \r\n  applying the intrinsic/extrinsic fraud distinction since the judgment was not \r\n  more than one year old; (2) finding there was no extrinsic fraud; and (3) applying \r\n  improper standards on after-discovered evidence.  Respondent disputes these \r\n  arguments and raises several additional sustaining grounds.\r\n Rule 60, SCRCP, is entitled â€œRelief from \r\n  Judgment or Order,â€ and subsection (b) states in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered \r\n  Evidence; Fraud, etc.  On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court \r\n  may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, \r\n  or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence \r\n  could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\r\n(3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an \r\n  adverse party;\r\n(4) the judgment is void;\r\n(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, \r\n  or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, \r\n  or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\nThe motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and \r\n  for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order \r\n  or proceeding was entered or taken.  A motion under this subdivision (b) \r\n  does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation.  This rule \r\n  does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve \r\n  a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment for \r\n  fraud upon the court.\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nWhether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) \r\n  lies within the sound discretion of the judge.  Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 \r\n  S.C. 491, 494, 413 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1992).  Our standard of review, therefore, \r\n  is limited to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion.\r\nThe trial court found that relief under \r\n  Rule 60 for fraud is only available for extrinsic fraud and because the \r\n  allegations of fraud in the instant case amounted to intrinsic fraud, there \r\n  could be no relief from judgment.  Orr argues this was error because the intrinsic/extrinsic \r\n  fraud analysis should only be used if the attack is on a judgment more \r\n  than one year old. [3]   We disagree.\r\nOrr relies in part on Mr. G v. Mrs. \r\n  G, 320 S.C. 305, 465 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995), for his argument that relief \r\n  for intrinsic fraud may be had if a Rule 60(b)(3) motion is brought within one \r\n  year of the judgment.  In that case, the Court of Appeals stated the following:  \r\n  â€œA party may not use intrinsic fraud to mount an attack upon a judgment \r\n  if the judgment is more than one year old.â€  Id. at 307-08, 465 \r\n  S.E.2d at 102-03 (citing Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP; emphasis added).  Looking at \r\n  the above emphasized language, the Court of Appeals arguably indicated that \r\n  if the judgment is less than a year old, intrinsic fraud could be the basis \r\n  for relief.  \r\nHowever, the Court of Appeals also discussed the \r\n  distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud and stated that intrinsic \r\n  fraud is not a valid ground for setting aside a judgment.  Id. at 308, \r\n  465 S.E.2d at 103.  In addition, we note that factually, the Mr. G v. Mrs. \r\n  G case involved a request for relief from judgment two and a half years \r\n  after the original divorce decree was entered.  Therefore, this opinion by itself \r\n  does not resolve the issue presented by Orr.  Instead, the issue of whether \r\n  relief under Rule 60(b)(3) may be had for intrinsic fraud if the motion is brought \r\n  within one year is a novel one.\r\nHistorically, this Court \r\n  has held that in order to obtain equitable relief from a judgment based on fraud, \r\n  the fraud must be extrinsic.  See Bryan v. Bryan, 220 S.C. 164, \r\n  66 S.E.2d 609 (1951).  In Bryan, we explained as follows:\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that a court \r\n  of equity has inherent power to grant relief from a judgment on the ground of \r\n  fraud.  However, not every fraud is sufficient to move a court of equity to \r\n  grant relief from a judgment.  Generally speaking, in order to secure equitable \r\n  relief, it must appear that the fraud was extrinsic or collateral to the question \r\n  examined and determined in the action in which the judgment was rendered; intrinsic \r\n  fraud is not sufficient for equitable relief. \r\n\r\nId. at 167-68, 66 S.E.2d \r\n  at 610.\r\nAs recently as last year, we discussed \r\n  the important distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud.  See \r\n  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 579 S.E.2d 605 (2003). \r\n  [4]   We reiterated in Chewning that â€œ[i]n order to secure equitable \r\n  relief on the basis of fraud, the fraud must be extrinsic.â€  Id. at 80, \r\n  579 S.E.2d at 610 (citing Bryan v. Bryan, supra).  â€œExtrinsic \r\n  fraud is â€˜fraud that induces a person not to present a case or deprives a person \r\n  of the opportunity to be heard.â€™â€  Id. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (citation \r\n  omitted).  Intrinsic fraud, on the other hand, is fraud which misleads a court \r\n  in determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating \r\n  the fraud.  Id.  The classic case of intrinsic fraud is perjured testimony \r\n  or presenting forged documents at trial.  See, e.g., Bryan \r\n  v. Bryan, 220 S.C. at 169, 66 S.E.2d at 611; James F. Flanagan, South Carolina \r\n  Civil Procedure at 485 (2d ed. 1996).  Allegations that a party failed to disclose \r\n  documents also generally amount to intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, fraud.  \r\n  Chewning, 354 S.C. at 82, 579 S.E.2d at 610-11.\r\nâ€œRelief is granted for extrinsic \r\n  but not intrinsic fraud on the theory that the latter deceptions should be discovered \r\n  during the litigation itself, and to permit such relief undermines the stability \r\n  of all judgments.â€  Mr. G v. Mrs. G, 320 S.C. at 308, 465 S.E.2d at 103  \r\n  (citation omitted); see also Bryan v. Bryan, 220 S.C. at \r\n  168, 66 S.E.2d at 610 (â€œrelief from a judgment is denied in cases of intrinsic \r\n  fraud, on the theory that an issue which has been tried and passed upon in the \r\n  original action should not be retried in an action for equitable relief against \r\n  the judgmentâ€).  \r\nFurthermore, it is significant \r\n  to note that when considering whether to grant relief from final judgments, \r\n  â€œa court must balance the interest of finality against the need to provide a \r\n  fair and just resolution of the dispute.â€  Chewning, 354 S.C. at 80, \r\n  579 S.E.2d at 609.  We recognized in Chewning both this Courtâ€™s longstanding \r\n  policy towards final judgments and that â€œimportant benefits are achieved by \r\n  the preservation of final judgments.â€  Id. at 86, 579 S.E.2d at 613.\r\nThus, the weight of South Carolina \r\n  authority clearly leads us to reject the argument that relief from judgment \r\n  is permitted for intrinsic fraud if raised within one year of the judgment.  \r\n  This conclusion is compelled not simply from our precedents, as discussed above, \r\n  but also from comparing our State rule to the Federal Rule.  The corresponding \r\n  clause in Federal Rule 60(b)(3) states that relief from judgment may be had \r\n  due to â€œfraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), \r\n  misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party.â€  Rule 60(b)(3), \r\n  Fed.R.Civ.P. (emphasis added).  Significantly, however, this emphasized language, \r\n  does not appear in South Carolinaâ€™s rule.  Accord Flanagan, South \r\n  Carolina Civil Procedure at 485 (Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP, â€œpreserves state practice \r\n  that distinguishes between â€˜intrinsicâ€™ and â€˜extrinsicâ€™ fraud.â€).\r\nAccordingly, we hold that South \r\n  Carolina maintains the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud, even \r\n  when the allegations are raised through a Rule 60(b)(3) motion filed within \r\n  one year of the entry of judgment.  The trial court therefore properly analyzed \r\n  the issue as one dependent on the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic \r\n  fraud.  Because this is clearly a case where the allegations rise only to the \r\n  level of intrinsic fraud, [5]  \r\n  the trial court correctly denied relief under Rule 60(b)(3).  Consequently, \r\n  we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.\r\nIn any event, we also \r\n  agree with respondentâ€™s arguments that, based on various additional sustaining \r\n  grounds, the trial courtâ€™s denial of relief should be affirmed. [6]   We are particularly persuaded by respondentâ€™s \r\n  argument that Orr is not entitled to relief for after-discovered evidence, pursuant \r\n  to Rule 60(b)(2), or for any alleged fraud or misconduct pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3), \r\n  because the evidence that was presented in the motion could have been discovered \r\n  during the litigation.\r\nPursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), \r\n  SCRCP, a court may order relief from judgment based on newly discovered evidence \r\n  â€œwhich by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a \r\n  new trial under Rule 59(b).â€  Likewise, â€œa party may not prevail on a Rule 60(b)(3) \r\n  motion on the basis of fraud where he or she has access to disputed information \r\n  or has knowledge of inaccuracies in an opponentâ€™s representations at the time \r\n  of the alleged misconduct.â€  Ojeda-Toro v. Rivera-Mendez, 853 F.2d 25, \r\n  29 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Bowman v. Bowman, \r\n  Op. No. 3726 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 20, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 3 at \r\n  67) (where a party could have discovered the â€œnewâ€ evidence prior to trial, \r\n  the party is not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(2) or (3)). \r\n  [7] \r\nBailey was identified in respondentâ€™s \r\n  answers to interrogatories as a witness who could testify as to the accounting \r\n  for the South City Grill project and the amounts owed on the project.  \r\n  Yet Bailey was not deposed.  In her testimony at the Rule 60(b) hearing, she \r\n  acknowledged that if she had been deposed prior to the settlement and asked \r\n  if there were computer records, she would have testified as to the existence \r\n  of those records.  Therefore, we find that all of the evidence Bailey \r\n  presented to support Orrâ€™s Rule 60(b) motion could have been discovered by due \r\n  diligence.\r\nAdditionally, testimony given by Raby in his deposition \r\n  (taken on December 6, 2001, just two days before the parties settled) clearly \r\n  put Orr on notice of the computer accounting system.  Raby testified about this \r\n  computer system, and how it was brought â€œup piece by piece.â€  Orrâ€™s counsel \r\n  then specifically stated:  â€œOkay.  Well, you didnâ€™t produce any of these \r\n  records,â€ to which Raby essentially responded that the computer records were \r\n  not the â€œofficialâ€ records for the project.  The following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Okay.  But you havenâ€™t produced these [computer \r\n  time sheets]?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         A.\r\n        I have no idea.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Q.&nbsp;\r\n         Well, Iâ€™ll \r\n  represent to you that you havenâ€™t produced these.  So do you have these documents \r\n  available?  \r\n      \r\n      \r\n         A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Those documents are available for certain time frames.  I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re \r\n  available for this job.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        â€¦\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Okay.  \r\n  Well, you were requested to produce all of your records in connection with this \r\n  case.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         A.&nbsp;\r\n         And to my knowledge, I have produced them all.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Okay.  \r\n  Well, if you can find where you produced this to me, Iâ€™ll stand corrected and \r\n  offer you my humble apology, but I donâ€™t believe itâ€™s produced in this particular \r\n  form, is it?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n (Emphasis added).\r\nThus, Rabyâ€™s deposition alone \r\n  establishes Orr became aware that computer records were kept by respondent and \r\n  had not been produced.  Notwithstanding this information, Orr settled this case \r\n  without further inquiry.  We find it obvious that Orr could have discovered \r\n  the alleged â€œmisconductâ€ and the â€œafter-discovered evidenceâ€ that form the basis \r\n  of his Rule 60(b) motion.  For this additional reason, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision to deny relief from judgment.\r\n2.  \r\n  Award of Additional Attorneysâ€™ Fees\r\nOrr also argues the \r\n  trial court lacked jurisdiction to award additional attorneysâ€™ fees because \r\n  the filing of the notice of appeal regarding the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion \r\n  stayed the matters on appeal.  We disagree.\r\nThe general rule is \r\n  that â€œthe service of a notice of appeal in a civil matter acts to automatically \r\n  stay matters decided in the order on appeal, and to automatically stay the relief \r\n  ordered in the appealed order, judgment, or decree.â€  Rule 225(a), SCACR.  The \r\n  automatic stay â€œcontinues in effect for the duration of the appealâ€¦. The lower \r\n  court retains jurisdiction over matters not affected by the appeal including \r\n  the authority to enforce any matters not stayed by the appeal.â€  Id. \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nThe order of foreclosure \r\n  which directed the sale of the property is simply not a matter that was stayed \r\n  by the appeal of the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion; it was a separate order \r\n  which Orr did not appeal.  Thus, the award of additional attorneysâ€™ fees, \r\n  which was requested pursuant to that former order, was within the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  jurisdiction.  See id.\r\nIn other words, because \r\n  the only appeal pending at the time the trial court awarded additional attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees was the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion, that is the only order that would \r\n  be automatically stayed; the general rule does not authorize a stay of the \r\n  underlying order of judgment or order of foreclosure.  Cf. \r\n  In re Zapata Gulf Marine Corp., 941 F.2d 293, 295 (5th Cir. \r\n  1991) (where the court, applying analogous federal rules, reversed the district \r\n  courtâ€™s stay of execution of the underlying judgment where the only appeal pending \r\n  was the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion).\r\nAccordingly, Orrâ€™s argument \r\n  that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award additional attorneysâ€™ fees \r\n  is without merit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above stated \r\n  reasons, the trial courtâ€™s denial of the Rule 60(b) motion and the award of \r\n  additional attorneysâ€™ fees are both\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, \r\n  JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Brogdon, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  While both Orr and H&amp;D Capital, LLC d/b/a the South City Grill \r\n    are appellants in one of these appeals, only Orr is appellant in the second.  \r\n    For ease of reading, we refer solely to Orr.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  It appears from the record that discovery involved requests for production, \r\n    requests for admission, interrogatories, and depositions; the only people \r\n    deposed were Raby and Orr.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  We note that the trial court initially made a finding that where \r\n    there is a consent judgment, it is generally conclusive and not subject to \r\n    collateral attack, citing Johnson v. Johnson, 310 S.C. 44, 425 S.E.2d \r\n    46 (Ct. App. 1992).  Respondent argues that because Orr has not appealed this \r\n    finding, it is the law of the case.  We disagree.  In its order, the trial \r\n    court correctly stated the general rule.  See id. at \r\n    46, 425 S.E.2d at 48 (â€œOrdinarily, where a judgment or order is entered \r\n    by consent, it is binding and conclusive and cannot be attacked by the parties \r\n    either by direct appeal or in a collateral proceeding.â€) (emphasis added).  \r\n    Furthermore, we note the Johnson court ultimately granted relief pursuant \r\n    to Rule 60(b)(5); therefore, even consent judgments are subject to attack \r\n    under particular circumstances.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  We recognize that Chewning \r\n    was not a Rule 60 matter, but instead was an independent action for \r\n    fraud upon the court.  In that case, we found that where the attorney \r\n    allegedly suborned perjury and concealed documents, a claim for extrinsic \r\n    fraud had been sufficiently stated.  Nevertheless, our general discussion \r\n    on extrinsic and intrinsic fraud is instructive on the issue raised in this \r\n    case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Allegations of perjury, failure to produce requested discovery, or \r\n    use of forged documents amount only to intrinsic fraud.  See, e.g., \r\n    Chewning, 354 S.C. at 82, 579 S.E.2d at 610-11; Bryan v. Bryan, \r\n    220 S.C. at 169, 66 S.E.2d at 611; Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure \r\n    at 485.  These are the types of allegations made by Orr, and so we reject \r\n    Orrâ€™s alternative argument that this is a case of extrinsic fraud.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. \r\n    406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (â€œThe appellate court may review respondentâ€™s \r\n    additional reasons and, if convinced it is proper and fair to do so, rely \r\n    on them or any other reason appearing in the record to affirm the lower courtâ€™s \r\n    judgment.â€); Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, \r\n    order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  Indeed, even in cases of extrinsic fraud, a party does not have a \r\n    claim â€œif he failed to exercise due diligence in discovering the existence \r\n    of facts or documents during the underlying litigation.â€  Chewning, \r\n    354 S.C. at 82 n.6, 579 S.E.2d at 611 n.6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25794","title":"In the Matter of an Anonymous Former Probate Judge","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25794","description":"In this opinion, the Court issues a public reprimand where a former probate judge collected fees for performing marriage ceremonies and retained the fees for his personal use.","date":"2004-03-22","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:windowtext;}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:windowtext;}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of an Anonymous Former Probate Judge,\r\nRespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25794\r\nSubmitted February 18, 2004 - Filed \r\n  March 22, 2004\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nBen C. Harrison, of Spartanburg, for respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 502, SCACR. [1]   In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admitted misconduct and consented to the imposition of a public reprimand.  \r\n  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand for the misconduct set \r\n  forth herein.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent began serving as probate judge for Cherokee County \r\n  in 1951.  For years, respondent and his staff routinely charged fees to perform \r\n  marriage ceremonies.  All or a portion of the fees were retained by respondent \r\n  for his personal use.  Respondent did not report the receipt of these fees on \r\n  the annual reports he was required to file with South Carolina Court Administration \r\n  pursuant to Canon 5(H)(2) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR, \r\n  nor did he report the additional compensation on his annual report filed with \r\n  the South Carolina Ethics Commission.\r\nOn October 10, 1994, the Advisory Committee on Standards \r\n  of Judicial Conduct issued Opinion No. 26-1994 regarding, among other things, \r\n  the propriety of a probate judge charging a fee for performing marriage ceremonies \r\n  and the propriety of a probate judge accepting and retaining an honorarium for \r\n  performing marriage ceremonies.  Therein, the Committee advised that probate \r\n  judges in South Carolina could perform marriage ceremonies only if authorized \r\n  to do so by the governing body of their respective counties.  \r\nRelying on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-21-760 (1976), the Committee also advised that \r\n  probate judges could collect fees for performing marriage ceremonies but only \r\n  if the fees charged were authorized by the governing body of their respective \r\n  counties and if the fees collected were deposited into the county's general \r\n  fund. [2]   The Committee noted \r\n  that this Court, in In the Matter of Johnson, 302 S.C. 532, 397 S.E.2d \r\n  522 (1990), had held that (1) fees collected for services rendered by a probate \r\n  judge in his capacity as probate judge are governed by Article 7 whether specifically \r\n  enumerated therein or not, and (2) failure to deposit fees in the county fund \r\n  was a violation of Canons 1 and 2A of the Code of Judicial Conduct, which require \r\n  a judge to observe high standards of conduct and respect and comply with the \r\n  law.\r\nFinally, the Committee advised that a probate judge cannot accept nor retain \r\n  an honorarium for performing marriage ceremonies.  The Committee advised that \r\n  a judge who accepts an honorarium for performing marital services is exploiting \r\n  his judicial position for his own personal gain in violation of former Canon \r\n  5C(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, now Canon 4D(1), and that the honorarium \r\n  cannot be accepted as a gift because it arises directly from duties and powers \r\n  conferred upon the judge.\r\nSouth Carolina Court Administration sent a copy of the advisory \r\n  opinion to each of the probate judges in South Carolina.  Respondent acknowledged \r\n  he received a copy of the opinion in late 1994 or early 1995.\r\nOn February 7, 1995, respondent entered into a contract \r\n  with Cherokee County which authorized respondent to perform marriages, established \r\n  a $10 fee to be charged by the probate court for the issuance of a marriage \r\n  license, and stated that &quot;no less than monthly, [respondent] shall turn \r\n  over the county's portion of funds collected . . . to the treasurer together \r\n  with a report of activity covered by the payment.&quot;  However, the contract \r\n  did not set or specifically authorize a fee to be paid to respondent for the \r\n  performance of marriage ceremonies, it did not specifically authorize \r\n  respondent to charge a fee for conducting marriage ceremonies, and it did not \r\n  specifically authorize respondent to retain such a fee for respondent's own \r\n  use, except for the vague reference to &quot;the county's portion.&quot;\r\nThereafter, respondent and his staff continued to perform \r\n  marriage ceremonies and collect, in addition to the fees due the county, a fee \r\n  for the performance of marriage ceremonies in the amount of $10 for residents \r\n  of Cherokee County and $20 for non-residents.  The fees were retained by respondent \r\n  for his personal use even when ceremonies were performed by respondent's staff \r\n  instead of respondent. [3] \r\nIn 1998, this Court issued an opinion holding former Jasper \r\n  County Probate Judge Harry C. Brown in contempt for willfully violating an order \r\n  of the Court instructing him to refrain from retaining for his personal use \r\n  any further compensation for performing marriage ceremonies. [4]   In the Matter of Brown, \r\n  333 S.C. 414, 511 S.E.2d 351 (1998).  Respondent estimated he became aware of \r\n  the Brown opinion approximately one month after it was issued.\r\nOn December 16, 1999, the Advisory Committee on Standards \r\n  of Judicial Conduct issued another advisory opinion on this subject, specifically \r\n  addressing the propriety of a probate judge accepting all or a percentage of \r\n  a fee collected by the judge for performing marriage ceremonies.  The Committee \r\n  concluded a probate judge may collect a fee for performing marriage ceremonies \r\n  if (1) the fee is authorized by the county governing body and if (2) the fee \r\n  collected is deposited in the general fund of the county.  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 8-21-760 (fees and costs received under the provisions of Article 7 by \r\n  the officials of a county must be accounted for and paid into the general fund \r\n  of the county as directed by the governing body of that county).  \r\nSouth Carolina Court Administration sent a copy of the opinion to all of the \r\n  probate judges in the state.  Respondent acknowledged he received a copy.  However, \r\n  respondent and his staff continued to collect fees for the performance of marriage \r\n  ceremonies until Disciplinary Counsel served respondent with a notice of full \r\n  investigation on September 23, 2003.\r\nOn October 14, 2003, the Chief Justice of this Court issued \r\n  a memorandum to all judges in the state regarding the retention of compensation \r\n  for performing marriage ceremonies.  Therein, the Chief Justice stated that \r\n  no judge can retain for personal compensation any fees collected for performing \r\n  marriage ceremonies, even if the fees are characterized as an honorarium or \r\n  gift.  The Chief Justice pointed out that the practice of retaining such fees \r\n  had been declared a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct in this Court's \r\n  opinions in Johnson and Brown, as well as in Advisory Committee \r\n  Opinion No. 26-1994.  The Chief Justice stated further that the impropriety \r\n  of retaining such fees should be clear from reading S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-21-760 \r\n  and Canons 1, 2A, 2B, 4D(1) and 4D(5) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.\r\nThe Chief Justice also stated in the memorandum that neither \r\n  the governing body of a county nor a local act of the legislature can authorize \r\n  a judge to personally retain compensation for performing marriages contrary \r\n  to the Code of Judicial Conduct, and that the prohibition against a judge receiving \r\n  compensation for performing marriage ceremonies applies to all judges regardless \r\n  of when or where or under what circumstances the marriage ceremony is performed, \r\n  or in what capacity the judge takes the oath, whether as a judge or a notary \r\n  public, all arguments which were made in the Brown matter.\r\nThe Chief Justice instructed any judge who had retained \r\n  compensation for the performance of marriages while serving as a judge in the \r\n  South Carolina Unified Court System to promptly make a report of having done \r\n  so to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, initiate an audit to determine the \r\n  amount of compensation retained, and repay that compensation to the general \r\n  fund of their respective county.\r\n&quot;With the advantage of hindsight, the Chief Justice's \r\n  Memorandum, and the advice of counsel,&quot; respondent admitted that charging \r\n  fees for the performance of marriage ceremonies and retaining those fees for \r\n  his own use and benefit violated the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-21-760, \r\n  the published of opinions of this Court in Johnson and Brown, \r\n  and the Code of Judicial Conduct.  Thereafter, respondent ceased charging fees \r\n  for the performance of marriage ceremonies.  \r\nIn addition, at the request of Disciplinary Counsel, respondent provided an \r\n  accounting of the fees collected by the Probate Court of Cherokee County, and \r\n  retained and paid over to respondent for his personal use and benefit, from \r\n  July 1, 1998 until the time he stopped collecting the fees. [5]   Based on that accounting, it \r\n  was estimated respondent and his staff collected, and respondent retained, approximately \r\n  $51,380 during that time.  Respondent agreed that the fees collected and retained \r\n  by him or his staff during that time should have been paid into the general \r\n  fund of Cherokee County and that he was obligated to repay the funds.  Respondent \r\n  remitted that amount to the general fund of Cherokee County.  Respondent further \r\n  represented that no refund, rebate, bonus or any other compensation based on \r\n  the amount refunded was paid by Cherokee County to respondent.  Respondent agreed \r\n  that it would be inappropriate under statutory law, this Court's opinions in \r\n  Johnson and Brown, and the Code of Judicial Conduct, for respondent \r\n  to accept forgiveness, a refund or a bonus of any portion of the amount remitted \r\n  to Cherokee County, and respondent agreed not to accept such a refund, bonus \r\n  or forgiveness of the amount owed in the future, although it was agreed this \r\n  proviso would not operate to prevent Cherokee County from raising respondent's \r\n  salary in a fashion provided by law as long as no such raise was contingent \r\n  on fees collected by the probate court.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admitted that his conduct was in violation of the following canons \r\n  of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:  Canon 1 (a judge \r\n  shall uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary); Canon \r\n  1A (a judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing \r\n  high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that \r\n  the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 \r\n  (a judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of \r\n  the judge's activities); Canon 2A (a judge shall respect and comply with the \r\n  law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in \r\n  the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 3B(2) (a judge shall \r\n  be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it); Canon 3C(1) \r\n  (a judge shall diligently discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities \r\n  and maintain professional competence in judicial administration); Canon 4D(1)(a) \r\n  (a judge shall not engage in financial dealings that \r\n  may reasonably be perceived to exploit the judge's judicial position); Canon \r\n  4D(1)(b) (a judge shall not engage in financial dealings that involve the judge \r\n  in frequent transactions or continuing business relationships with those lawyers \r\n  or other persons likely to come before the court on which the judge serves); \r\n  Canon 4D(5) (a judge shall not accept a gift, bequest, favor or loan \r\n  from anyone except for in certain situations not applicable to this case); Canon \r\n  4H(1) (a judge may receive compensation and reimbursement of expenses for extra-judicial \r\n  activities permitted by this Code, if the source of such payments does not give \r\n  the appearance of impropriety); and Canon 4H(2) (a judge shall report the date, \r\n  place and nature of any activity for which the judge received compensation, \r\n  and the name of the payor and the amount of compensation so received; the judge's \r\n  report shall be made at least annually and shall be filed as a public document \r\n  in the Office of Court Administration). \r\nRespondent also admitted that his conduct constitutes grounds for discipline \r\n  under the following provisions of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 502, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge \r\n  to violate or attempt to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct) and \r\n  Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to willfully violate \r\n  a valid court order issued by a court of this state or another jurisdiction).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue \r\n  a public reprimand in this matter.  We take the unusual step of issuing this \r\n  reprimand, despite respondent's death, because of the recurring nature of this \r\n  problem.\r\nFurther, we take this opportunity to address our concern over the ongoing and \r\n  willful violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-21-760, this Court's opinions, and opinions \r\n  of the Advisory Committee on Standards of Judicial Conduct by probate judges \r\n  in this state.  \r\nJust recently, the Advisory Committee on Standards of Judicial Conduct was \r\n  asked to issue yet another opinion on this topic - an opinion very similar to \r\n  the one it was asked to issue in 1994.  In Opinion No. 20-2003, the Committee \r\n  addressed the propriety of a county procedure which grants probate judges a \r\n  percentage of the fees collected by the probate court for performing marriage \r\n  ceremonies. [6]   Relying on Canon 4D(1)(a) of the Code of Judicial \r\n  Conduct, the Committee advised that while a county may take into consideration \r\n  all of a probate judge's duties, such as performing marriage ceremonies, when \r\n  determining the judge's salary, that salary must remain constant and may not \r\n  be dependent on fees the probate judge collects for the performance of marriage \r\n  ceremonies.  The Committee advised that a judge who accepts a percentage of \r\n  the court's fees for marital services performed is exploiting his judicial position \r\n  for his own personal gain in violation of Canon 4D(1)(a).  The Committee further \r\n  advised that by merely keeping a portion of a fee charged for a marriage ceremony \r\n  and granting the balance to the probate judge for his or her services, a county \r\n  is granting the probate judge an honorarium.  Finally, the Committee advised \r\n  that the fee split cannot be accepted as a gift under Canon 4D(5)(a)-(c) because \r\n  it arises directly from duties and powers conferred upon the judge.    \r\nStatutory law and judicial standards are clear on the prohibition \r\n  against probate judges being compensated for the performance of marriage ceremonies.  \r\n  Despite this fact, this Court and the Advisory Committee on Standards of Judicial \r\n  Conduct continue to be faced with judges intent on flouting the law and governmental \r\n  entities intent on devising schemes to circumvent the law.  The fact that the \r\n  Chief Justice was forced, due to the refusal of certain judges to comply with \r\n  the opinions, to issue a &quot;cease and desist&quot; memorandum reiterating \r\n  that the practice violates statutory law and the Code of Judicial Conduct, is \r\n  a clear indication that this matter is not being taken seriously.  The Chief \r\n  Justice, in her memorandum, directed any judge who has retained compensation \r\n  for the performance of marriages while serving as a judge in the South Carolina \r\n  Unified Court System to promptly make a report of having done so to the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel, initiate an audit to determine the amount of compensation \r\n  retained, and repay that compensation to the general fund of their respective \r\n  county.  We take this opportunity to reiterate that directive.  Judges who fail \r\n  to promptly comply with this directive and who continue to exhibit a cavalier \r\n  attitude toward the statutory law, the opinions of this Court, the opinions \r\n  of the Advisory Committee on Judicial Standards and the provisions of the Code \r\n  of Judicial Conduct regarding this subject will receive a harsher sanction than \r\n  those who promptly comply.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.   \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Respondent passed away after entering into the \r\n    agreement.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]                Section 8-21-760 states the following:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n  The probate judges must receive salaries for performance \r\n    of their duties pursuant to Section 8-21-765.\r\n  A probate judge who is receiving a salary \r\n    greater than provided for his position under the provisions of this chapter \r\n    must not be reduced in salary during his tenure in office.  Tenure in office \r\n    continues at the expiration of a term if that judge is reelected.\r\n  The governing body of the county shall \r\n    provide the salary, equipment, facilities, and supplies of the support personnel \r\n    and staff of the probate judge, together with all other costs necessary for \r\n    the efficient operation of the court, including but not limited to, court \r\n    reporters, secretaries, clerks, per diem, travel, educational, and other benefits \r\n    for the judge and his staff.  A probate judge is not prohibited from acting \r\n    as special referee with the agreement of the county governing body, but no \r\n    probate judge is eligible to serve as a standing master-in-equity.\r\n  The probate judge in each county must serve \r\n    full time and shall carry out all duties assigned by law.\r\n  Fees and costs received under the provisions \r\n    of this article by the officials of a county must be accounted for and paid \r\n    into the general fund of the county as directed by the governing body of that \r\n    county.  Any remuneration received by a probate judge for performing duties \r\n    assigned by the Department of Mental Health must be remitted by the probate \r\n    judge to the county treasurer for deposit into the general fund of the county.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  For several months during 2003, when respondent \r\n    was unable to perform his judicial duties due to an injury, his staff continued \r\n    to perform marriage ceremonies and collect fees for performing the ceremonies, \r\n    and then paid the fees collected to respondent or someone acting on respondent's \r\n    behalf.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The Court had previously issued a private admonition \r\n    stating that the personal retention of payment for performing marriages involved \r\n    an exploitation of judicial office for the judge's own personal gain.  The \r\n    Court stated further that even if it was assumed the payments were gratuitously \r\n    given, the personal retention of the payments was improper since it involved \r\n    a gift from a person who appeared before the judge in his official capacity \r\n    as a probate judge.  Moreover, the Court noted that it gave rise to a strong \r\n    appearance of impropriety for a probate judge to personally retain compensation \r\n    for performing marriages.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  The parties agreed on a date of July 1, 1998 because \r\n    it is approximately thirty days after the issuance of this Court's opinion \r\n    in Brown, supra.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  The opinion states that Spartanburg County Council \r\n    has recently approved a contract which provides that a minimum fee of $35 \r\n    will be charged for the performance of marriage ceremonies, that the probate \r\n    judge may establish a different, larger fee for ceremonies that require additional \r\n    efforts, and that for each ceremony performed by the probate judge or his \r\n    staff, the county will receive $25, with the balance going to the probate \r\n    judge or his designee for his services in performing the ceremonies, collecting \r\n    the fees and maintaining proper records.  The contract also states that fees \r\n    received by the probate judge or his designee shall be in addition to the \r\n    salary paid to the judge or his designee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25795","title":"Jerome Mackey v.

Haile, \r\n  of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Allen Bullard,\r\nAssistant Attorney General W. Bryan Dukes, all of \r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: On May 11, 1995, Petitioner \r\n  was indicted for grand larceny, resisting arrest and first-degree burglary. \r\n  On June 27, 1995, the prosecution nolle prossed Petitionerâ€™s indictments.  \r\n  Although Petitioner was never re-indicted, he was tried and convicted of these \r\n  charges on May 30, 1996.  We vacate Petitionerâ€™s conviction and sentences.&nbsp; \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn May 30, 1996, Petitioner was convicted of grand \r\n  larceny, resisting arrest and first-degree burglary and received an aggregate \r\n  sentence of fifteen-years imprisonment. \r\n  [1]   The Court of Appeals affirmed Petitionerâ€™s conviction.  State v. \r\n  Mackey, 97-UP-566 (filed October 30, 1997).  \r\nPetitioner filed an application \r\n  for post-conviction relief (â€œPCRâ€) dated January 21, 1999.  On December 8, 1999, \r\n  the State filed an amended return and motion to dismiss the case for failure \r\n  to file within the statute of limitations. The Honorable A. Victor Rawl granted \r\n  the Stateâ€™s motion without a hearing and dismissed the case by written order \r\n  dated August 12, 2000. \r\nOn January 24, 2002, this Court granted Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari to review the following question:\r\n\r\nDid the State need to re-indict Petitioner so that the trial court could retain \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction and convict him after the indictments were nol \r\n  prossed?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner argues that \r\n  because his charges were nol prossed, the State needed to re-indict him \r\n  so that the trial court would retain subject matter jurisdiction.  We agree \r\n  that Petitioner needed to be re-indicted, but we do not need to conduct a subject-matter-jurisdiction \r\n  analysis to reach this conclusion.\r\nA nolle prosequi is an \r\n  entry by the prosecuting officer indicating that he has decided not to prosecute \r\n  a case.  State v. Gaskins, 263 S.C. 343, 347, 210 S.E.2d 590, 592 (1974).  \r\n  This Court has held that all proceedings following an entry of a nolle prosequi \r\n  are void because the indictment was no longer valid.  State v. Charles, \r\n  183 S.C. 188, 199, 190 S.E. 466, 470 (1937).  In the case In re Brown, \r\n  this Court has also held that a solicitorâ€™s nolle prosequi of an indictment \r\n  charging police officer with fatally shooting third party prevented the trial \r\n  court from taking jurisdiction, thus rendering any subsequent proceedings void.  \r\n  294 S.C. 235, 237, 363 S.E.2d 688, 689 (1988).  Given this precedent, we hold \r\n  that when a solicitor enters a nolle prosequi, charges are extinguished.\r\nIn this case, the solicitor did, \r\n  however, retain the right to re-indict Petitioner because jeopardy does not \r\n  attach until a jury has been empaneled and sworn. In fact, this Court has held \r\n  that â€œif the nolle prosequi is entered prior to the jury being empaneled \r\n  and sworn, there is no bar to further prosecution for the same offense because \r\n  the innocence or the guilt of the defendant would not have been adjudicated.â€ \r\n  State v. Patrick, 318 S.C. 352, 357, 457 S.E.2d 632, 636 (1996).  In \r\n  Patrick, the solicitor re-indicted the defendant before seeking a conviction \r\n  upon charges that were nol prossed.  In the case at bar, the solicitor \r\n  should have re-indicted Petitioner.  \r\nConclusion\r\nA requirement of re-indictment \r\n  upon charges nol prossed should not be based upon a subject-matter-jurisdiction \r\n  analysis.  This type of analysis would suggest that subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  attaches upon indictment and in turn detaches upon a solicitorâ€™s entry of nolle \r\n  prosequi.  \r\nWe adopt a specific, bright-line \r\n  rule that (1) establishes that a nolle prosequi upon charges extinguishes \r\n  the Stateâ€™s prosecution upon those charges; (2) treats charges nol prossed \r\n  as if they never existed; and (3) requires a court to dismiss charges when a \r\n  solicitor has nol prossed the charges and failed to re-indict a criminal \r\n  defendant upon those charges.  \r\nBased upon the foregoing reasoning, \r\n  we Reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling and Vacate Petitionerâ€™s sentences and convictions.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  These documents were not provided in the Record \r\n    on Appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25796","title":"Joseph Sheppard v.

Haile, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Chief Capital and Collateral Litigation Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Deputy \r\n  Attorney General Allen Bullard, and Assistant Attorney General Christopher L. \r\n  Newton, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We granted this writ of certiorari \r\n  to determine whether the post-conviction relief (PCR) court erred by denying \r\n  petitionerâ€™s request for a belated appeal.  We reverse the PCR court and, after \r\n  a review of petitionerâ€™s direct appeal issues, we affirm his convictions for \r\n  murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.\r\nPROCEDURAL FACTS\r\nPetitioner was convicted of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission \r\n  of a violent crime and received consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for \r\n  murder and five years on the firearm charge.  No direct appeal was taken.  Thereafter, \r\n  petitioner filed a PCR application seeking a belated review of his direct appeal \r\n  issues pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).  \r\n  Following the White hearing, the PCR court issued an order finding petitioner \r\n  was not entitled to a belated review of his direct appeal issues.\r\nPost-Conviction Relief Issue\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err by failing to grant petitioner a belated review of his \r\n  direct appeal issues? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner contends the PCR court erred by finding he voluntarily waived his \r\n  right to a direct appeal because trial counsel misadvised him that if his convictions \r\n  were reversed on appeal, the State could again seek the death penalty.\r\nTo waive a direct appeal, a defendant must make a knowing and intelligent decision \r\n  not to pursue the appeal.  Davis v. State, 288 S.C. 290, 342 S.E.2d 60 \r\n  (1986).  The Court will reverse a PCR courtâ€™s decision when it is controlled \r\n  by an error of law.  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 526 S.E.2d 222 (2000).\r\nPetitioner was convicted of murdering a Greenville city police officer.  During \r\n  the sentencing hearing, the State introduced evidence of only one aggravating \r\n  circumstance, that the victim was a law enforcement officer killed during the \r\n  performance of his duties.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(7) (2003).  \r\n  The jury found the aggravating circumstance was present, but recommended life \r\n  imprisonment instead of death.\r\nAt the White hearing, petitioner testified he called trial counselâ€™s \r\n  office the day after his trial and told counsel to appeal his case.  Counsel \r\n  met with petitioner and told him it would be unreasonable to file an appeal \r\n  because the State could seek the death penalty again if he was granted a new \r\n  trial.  Based on counselâ€™s advice, petitioner did not file a direct appeal.  \r\n  Trial counsel confirmed the facts as stated by petitioner.  Counsel testified, \r\n  however, that he believed, and continues to so believe, the State would do everything \r\n  to execute petitioner, including attempting to have a pertinent United States \r\n  Supreme Court case overturned.\r\nThe general rule in capital punishment cases is that when a defendantâ€™s conviction \r\n  is reversed on appeal, the original conviction is nullified and the slate is \r\n  wiped clean.  Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 552 S.E.2d 26 (2001).  If \r\n  the defendant is convicted again on retrial, the death penalty may be validly \r\n  imposed.  This doctrine is known as the clean slate rule and was enunciated \r\n  by the United States Supreme Court (USSC) in United States v. Ball, 163 \r\n  U.S. 662 (1896), and North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711 (1969).\r\nIn Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430 (1981), the USSC recognized a \r\n  limited exception to the clean slate rule -- when a jury or appellate court \r\n  finds the prosecution has failed to â€œprove its caseâ€ for the death penalty, \r\n  and a life sentence is imposed, the clean slate rule does not apply, and the \r\n  State cannot seek a harsher sentence upon retrial.  Id.  The USSC held \r\n  that where the first jury returns a unanimous verdict of life imprisonment, \r\n  the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment bars the imposition of the \r\n  death penalty on retrial.  The first jury, by choosing life, impliedly decides \r\n  the prosecution has not proved its case for death, and impliedly acquits the \r\n  defendant of the death penalty.  According to Bullington, the clean slate \r\n  rule is inapplicable whenever a jury agrees or an appellate court decides the \r\n  prosecution has not proved its case.\r\nUnder South Carolinaâ€™s sentencing scheme, there are three possible outcomes \r\n  following the juryâ€™s determination that a statutory aggravating circumstance \r\n  is present:  (1) the jury recommends death and the trial judge imposes death; \r\n  (2) the jury fails to recommend death and the trial judge imposes life without \r\n  parole; or (3) the jury is deadlocked as to whether death should be imposed \r\n  and the trial judge imposes a sentence of life imprisonment.  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-3-20 (2003).  \r\nIn the instant case, the sentencing jury found the presence of a statutory \r\n  aggravating circumstance and failed to recommend death.  Therefore, counselâ€™s \r\n  advice that petitioner would face the death penalty was erroneous given the \r\n  juryâ€™s actions constituted an acquittal of the death penalty under Bullington, \r\n  supra.  Although counsel testified he believed the State would attempt \r\n  to overturn Bullington, counselâ€™s speculation about what the State would \r\n  argue is not a sufficient justification for his failure to correctly explain \r\n  the law or effectively convey to petitioner that his advice was based on speculation \r\n  about the Stateâ€™s strategy, rather than the law.  Further, petitioner desired \r\n  to file an appeal, but chose not to after counsel informed him he could face \r\n  the death penalty if he was retried.  Accordingly, the PCR court erred by finding \r\n  petitioner voluntarily waived his right to a direct appeal.\r\nDirect Appeal\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the day of the crime, Officer James Russell Sorrow attempted to arrest petitioner \r\n  pursuant to a felony warrant.  The officer eventually chased petitioner into \r\n  the home of petitionerâ€™s aunt, Nancy Workman.  The officer cornered petitioner \r\n  and attempted to place handcuffs on him.  Petitioner was able to escape from \r\n  the officer and another chase ensued.  Subsequently, petitioner shot the officer \r\n  two times in the face, four times in the back of his head, and once in the buttocks.  \r\n  The officer died as a result of his wounds.  Petitioner was captured a few days \r\n  later at a local motel.  He was charged with murder and possession of a firearm \r\n  during the commission of a violent crime.  After a trial, the jury convicted \r\n  petitioner of both charges.\r\nISSUE I\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by denying petitionerâ€™s motion for a change of venue \r\n  due to pretrial publicity?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues his motion to change venue should have been granted \r\n  due to the nature of the crime, i.e. a â€œcop killing,â€ and due to the \r\n  large percentage of potential jurors that were aware of the media coverage.  \r\n  He argues this established inherent prejudice because the case was easily remembered.\r\nDuring voir dire, the trial court asked eighty-seven prospective \r\n  jurors whether they had been exposed to pretrial publicity.  Out of eighty-seven \r\n  potential jurors, all but five had been exposed to pretrial publicity.  The \r\n  trial court then asked these prospective jurors whether they had formed an opinion \r\n  about the case and whether they could put aside what they had heard and base \r\n  their verdict on the evidence presented at trial.  Fourteen of the prospective \r\n  jurors indicated they had formed an opinion that petitioner was guilty.  Out \r\n  of those fourteen, eight prospective jurors stated they could not set it aside.  \r\n  Of the eight who said they could not set it aside, only one of these was qualified \r\n  to be in the pool from which the jury would be empanelled. [1]   This person was not seated on the jury. \r\n  [2] \r\nThe trial court denied petitionerâ€™s motion for a change of venue based on excessive \r\n  pretrial publicity.  The court stated pervasive pretrial publicity alone was \r\n  not sufficient to relocate the trial.  The court concluded the jury pool, after \r\n  being subjected to extensive voir dire, was fair and impartial.\r\nA motion to change venue is addressed to the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.  \r\n  State v. Manning, 329 S.C. 1, 495 S.E.2d 191 (1997) (finding trial court \r\n  abused discretion by granting Stateâ€™s motion to change venue based on pretrial \r\n  publicity because no evidentiary facts supported finding of actual juror prejudice \r\n  toward State).  When a trial judge bases the denial of a motion for a change \r\n  of venue because of pretrial publicity upon an adequate voir dire examination \r\n  of the jurors, his decision will not be disturbed absent extraordinary circumstances.  \r\n  State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990).  When jurors \r\n  have been exposed to pretrial publicity, a denial of a change of venue is not \r\n  error when the jurors are found to have the ability to set aside any impressions \r\n  or opinions and render a verdict based on the evidence presented at trial.  \r\n  State v. Manning, supra.  Therefore, mere exposure to pretrial \r\n  publicity does not automatically disqualify a prospective juror.  Id.  \r\n  Instead, the relevant question is not whether the community remembered the case, \r\n  but whether the jurors had such fixed opinions that they could not judge impartially \r\n  the guilt of the defendant.  Id.  It is the defendantâ€™s burden to demonstrate \r\n  actual juror prejudice as a result of such publicity.  State v. Caldwell, \r\n  supra.\r\nThe trial court properly denied petitionerâ€™s motion for a change \r\n  of venue because petitioner did not show extraordinary circumstances why this \r\n  decision should be disturbed given the adequacy of the voir dire examination \r\n  of the jurors.  See State v. Caldwell, supra.  The potential \r\n  jurorsâ€™ mere exposure to the pretrial publicity did not automatically disqualify \r\n  them.  See State v. Manning, supra. \r\nPetitioner has not met his burden of demonstrating actual juror prejudice \r\n  as a result of the publicity.  See State v. Caldwell, supra \r\n  (no abuse of discretion where eleven of seated jurors and two alternates acknowledged \r\n  awareness of media coverage but stated they could be impartial and decide case \r\n  based on evidence presented).  His mere assertion he established inherent prejudice \r\n  due to the nature of the crime and the large percentage of prospective jurors \r\n  who remembered the case is insufficient to show actual prejudice.  See \r\n  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998) (defendantâ€™s mere \r\n  assertion that jurors could have been subconsciously affected by media exposure \r\n  is insufficient to show prejudice).  Although there was intense pretrial media \r\n  coverage, there was no indication the trial courtâ€™s voir dire failed to produce \r\n  an impartial jury.  See id.\r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err by denying the motion to \r\n  change venue due to pretrial publicity.\r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by denying the motion to quash the indictment because \r\n  racial discrimination existed in the county grand jury selection process?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPrior to trial, petitioner moved to quash the indictment because there was \r\n  racial discrimination in selecting and seating jurors for the Greenville County \r\n  grand jury.  For purposes of the motion, it was assumed by all parties that \r\n  the African American population in Greenville County was about 16-18%.  At the \r\n  request of the trial court, the county clerk compiled information regarding \r\n  the race of the grand jurors for the years 1994 to 1997.  The clerk was also \r\n  questioned by the court and testified the selection procedures for the grand \r\n  jurors had not deviated from the law.  The trial court denied the motion and \r\n  stated petitioner had not established a presumption of racial discrimination \r\n  based on the statistical data available.\r\nIn Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482 (1977), the United States \r\n  Supreme Court outlined the following test to be utilized when a defendant makes \r\n  a grand jury discrimination claim:\r\n\r\n[I]n order to show . . . an equal protection violation[,] . . . [t]he first \r\n  step is to establish that the group is one that is a recognizable, distinct \r\n  class, singled out for different treatment under the laws, as written or as \r\n  applied.  Next, the degree of under-representation must be proved, by \r\n  comparing the proportion of the group in the total population to the proportion \r\n  called to serve as grand jurors, over a significant period of time.  . . .  \r\n  Finally, . . . a selection procedure that is susceptible of abuse or \r\n  is not racially neutral supports the presumption of discrimination raised by \r\n  the statistical showing.  Once the defendant has shown substantial under-representation \r\n  of his group, he has made out a prima facie case of discriminatory purpose, \r\n  and the burden then shifts to the State to rebut that case.\r\n\r\nState v. George, 331 S.C. 342, 503 S.E.2d 168 (1998), cert. denied, \r\n  525 U.S. 1149 (1999) (quoting Castaneda, 430 U.S. at 494-95) (emphasis \r\n  added by George).\r\nUnder the Castaneda test, petitioner satisfied the first element \r\n  of belonging to a group that is a recognizable, distinct class, i.e. \r\n  African American.  The second element of the Castaneda test is that the \r\n  degree of under-representation must be proved by comparing the proportion of \r\n  the group in the total population to the proportion called to serve as grand \r\n  jurors, over a significant period of time.\r\nIn 1994, 13.6 % of the seated grand jurors, including alternates, \r\n  were African Americans.  In 1995, 15.7% were African Americans.  In 1996, 23% \r\n  were African Americans.  In 1997, 21% were African Americans.  Given the Greenville \r\n  County African American population was assumed to be 16-18% at trial, these \r\n  statistics do not indicate racial discrimination in the composition of the grand \r\n  jury.  Therefore, petitioner cannot meet the second element of the Castenada \r\n  test.\r\nAccordingly, petitioner has not made a prima facie showing under \r\n  the Castenada test, and, as a result, the trial court did not err by \r\n  denying petitionerâ€™s racial discrimination claim.\r\nISSUE III\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by denying petitionerâ€™s motion for a mistrial due to \r\n  the Stateâ€™s failure to submit witness statements to the defense?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues the trial court erred by denying his motion for a mistrial \r\n  due to the Stateâ€™s failure to produce two prior statements of Reggie Cole until \r\n  the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s direct examination of the witness. [3]   Petitioner argues the Stateâ€™s \r\n  failure to produce the statements violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. \r\n  83 (1963).\r\nAs noted previously, following a chase in petitionerâ€™s neighborhood, \r\n  a struggle in Nancy Workmanâ€™s home, and another chase, petitioner shot Officer \r\n  Sorrow six times in the head.  Petitionerâ€™s forensic expert testified on his \r\n  behalf that the evidence of the two gunshot wounds to the officerâ€™s face was \r\n  consistent with the position of defendant being held by the neck and reaching \r\n  his gun over and shooting the officer, which coincided with petitionerâ€™s testimony \r\n  at trial. [4] \r\nReggie Cole, who was charged with accessory after the fact of murder \r\n  for allowing petitioner to stay in his home and acquiring a hotel room for petitioner, \r\n  testified for the State at trial.  Cole testified petitioner admitted the officer \r\n  was chasing him and that after petitioner exited Workmanâ€™s home, the officer \r\n  told petitioner to freeze.  Petitioner did so and raised his hands.  When the \r\n  officer holstered his gun and pulled out the handcuffs, Cole testified petitioner \r\n  stated he said â€œMan, I canâ€™t go to jailâ€ and he made a motion indicating he \r\n  shot the officer.  This testimony conflicted with petitionerâ€™s testimony of \r\n  how the shooting occurred.  See footnote 4 infra.\r\nCole gave two statements to the police, one a week after the crime \r\n  and one almost a month after the crime.  In the first statement, Cole did not \r\n  relate the alleged statements petitioner made about the killing.  Later, Coleâ€™s \r\n  attorney advised him it would be to his benefit to tell everything he knew.  \r\n  As a result, Cole made another statement and this statement correlated with \r\n  what he testified at trial.\r\nPrior to cross-examining Cole, defense counsel alleged a Brady \r\n  violation had occurred because the State had failed to produce Coleâ€™s statements \r\n  until after the State had completed its direct examination of Cole.  Defense \r\n  counsel asked the court to consider the appropriate sanction because petitionerâ€™s \r\n  right to impeach the witness was impeded.  Defense counsel noted they would \r\n  have liked the opportunity to investigate Coleâ€™s second statement because, in \r\n  that statement, Cole indicated he had been at a bar for several hours before \r\n  petitioner allegedly told him about how the shooting occurred.  Defense counsel \r\n  wanted to determine how intoxicated Cole was at the time.  The State countered, \r\n  as to the second statement, that it had been read into the record at the preliminary \r\n  hearing so defense counsel had advance notice of that statement.  The court \r\n  reserved ruling until after the testimony was proffered.\r\nFollowing the proffer of Coleâ€™s testimony, the court found Coleâ€™s \r\n  statements were not within Brady and that the new information did not \r\n  amount to impeachment on issues that were substantive or germane to the issues \r\n  in the case.  During the cross-examination before the jury, Cole admitted he \r\n  was intoxicated at the time he allegedly heard the statement by petitioner and \r\n  he agreed that drinking could affect a personâ€™s ability to recall the details \r\n  of a conversation.  \r\nPursuant to Brady, the suppression by the prosecution of evidence \r\n  favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence \r\n  is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith \r\n  or bad faith of the prosecution.  Duncan v. State, 281 S.C. 435, 315 \r\n  S.E.2d 809 (1984).  A Brady claim is complete if the accused can demonstrate \r\n  (1) the evidence was favorable to the accused, (2) it was in the possession \r\n  of or known to the prosecution, (3) it was suppressed by the prosecution, and \r\n  (4) it was material to guilt or punishment.  Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. \r\n  515, 514 S.E.2d 320 (1999).  This rule applies to impeachment evidence as well \r\n  as exculpatory evidence.  Id. (citing United States v. Bagley, \r\n  473 U.S. 667 (1985)).\r\nFavorable evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability \r\n  that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding \r\n  would have been different.  United States v. Bagley, supra; State \r\n  v. Hinson, 293 S.C. 406, 361 S.E.2d 120 (1987).  A â€œreasonable probabilityâ€ \r\n  is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.  Id.\r\nPetitioner has not established a Brady claim.  The prosecution \r\n  did not suppress the evidence because Coleâ€™s second statement, which related \r\n  what petitioner allegedly told Cole, was read into the record at the preliminary \r\n  hearing.  Further, the contents of the statements the State initially failed \r\n  to produce do not create a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding \r\n  would have been different had the information been disclosed.  See State \r\n  v. Thompson, 276 S.C. 616, 281 S.E.2d 216 (1981) (Stateâ€™s failure to disclose \r\n  does not warrant reversal unless defendant deprived of fair trial).\r\nPetitioner had the opportunity to review and use the inconsistent \r\n  statements in his cross-examination of Cole.  Cf. Kyles v. Whitley, \r\n  514 U.S. 419 (1995) (Brady violation where prosecution failed to disclose, \r\n  until collateral review of Kylesâ€™ conviction, various statements, made to police \r\n  by informant who did not testify at trial, that showed informant could have \r\n  been actual perpetrator of the crime).  During cross-examination, defense counsel \r\n  acquired an admission by Cole that he was intoxicated at the time petitioner \r\n  allegedly made the statements.  However, he chose not to impeach Cole any further \r\n  with his previous inconsistent statements.  Given the fact he was given Coleâ€™s \r\n  statements in time for cross-examination, there is not a reasonable probability \r\n  the outcome of the trial would have been different had the statements been disclosed \r\n  prior to trial.\r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err by denying petitionerâ€™s \r\n  Brady claim. \r\n\r\nISSUE IV\r\nDid the trial court err by allowing hearsay testimony?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues the court erred by allowing Melinda Lynch to testify regarding \r\n  statements she overheard petitioner make a few days before he killed the officer.\r\nLynch testified at trial that a few days before the officer was killed, \r\n  she overheard petitioner talking with his friends.  At this point, petitioner \r\n  made a hearsay objection.  Lynch testified in camera she heard petitioner \r\n  say there was a warrant for his arrest and that â€œbefore I let an MF, mother \r\n  fucker cop take me down, police take me down I will shoot and kill one of the \r\n  SOBâ€™s.â€  Lynch testified she told petitioner that no one has a right to kill \r\n  another person.  Petitioner then stated, â€œfuck that, before I let them take \r\n  me down I will shoot and kill one of the SOBâ€™s.â€ [5] \r\nThe court, citing Rule 803(3), SCRE, [6]  ruled the statements were admissible as a clear \r\n  exception to the hearsay rule, and that the statement was relevant.  Lynch repeated \r\n  her testimony in front of the jury. \r\nPetitioner argues Lynchâ€™s testimony is inadmissible hearsay and does \r\n  not fall into the category of nonhearsay as set out in Rule 801(d)(1)(A), SCRE.\r\nRule 801(d)(1)(A) provides that a statement is not hearsay if the \r\n  declarant [7]  testifies at the \r\n  trial and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the \r\n  statement is inconsistent with the declarantâ€™s testimony.  Due to the Stateâ€™s \r\n  admission of Lynchâ€™s testimony during its case, petitioner is correct that the \r\n  statement is not nonhearsay under Rule 801(d)(1)(A).  While the declarant, \r\n  i.e. petitioner, testified at the trial and was subject to cross-examination \r\n  concerning the statement and the statement was inconsistent with petitionerâ€™s \r\n  testimony that he unintentionally killed the officer, the State offered Lynchâ€™s \r\n  testimony prior to petitionerâ€™s testimony.  Accordingly, Rule 801(d)(1)(A) \r\n  is inapplicable. [8]   See State v. Anders, 331 S.C. \r\n  474, 478, 503 S.E.2d 443, 444, n.3 (1998) (error in admitting declarantâ€™s prior \r\n  inconsistent statement without declarant first taking stand and denying having \r\n  made it is not cured when declarant is subsequently called as witness by defendant; \r\n  once declarantâ€™s statement was introduced by State, declarant has little alternative \r\n  but to take stand and either explain or deny statement attributed to him).\r\nTherefore, the statement was hearsay and could not be admitted before \r\n  petitioner testified unless an exception to the hearsay rule applied.  As noted \r\n  previously, the trial court ruled the statement was admissible under Rule 803(3), \r\n  SCRE.  Because petitioner does not appeal the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the \r\n  statement is a Rule 803(3) exception to the hearsay rule, that ruling is the \r\n  law of the case. [9]   See State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d \r\n  837 (2001) (unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is law of the case).  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial court did not err by admitting Lynchâ€™s testimony.\r\nISSUE V\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by commenting on the facts in his malice charge to the \r\n  jury?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues the court erred when charging malice to the jury.  The court \r\n  charged the jury:\r\n\r\nMurder is defined as the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.  \r\n  . . . Malice may be either expressed as if it is stated in no uncertain terms \r\n  . . .\r\nThe malice does not have to exist for any appreciable period of time before \r\n  the killing occurs.  The malice may be conceived at the moment that the act \r\n  occurs.  But there must be a conjunction, that is a coincidence in time of the \r\n  act, the guilty act and the state of mind.  Even if the defendant had had \r\n  malice at some point in the past he has not committed murder unless the malice \r\n  actually existed at the time of the killing.  \r\n It may be expressed, malice can be expressed where there is manifested \r\n  a deliberate intention to violently and unlawfully take the life of another \r\n  human being.  For instance with words.  Or it may be inferred, that is deduced \r\n  by you from certain circumstances.  . . .\r\n\r\n          One of the ways that malice can be inferred is from the use of a deadly \r\n  weapon.  . . .\r\n\r\nThe term deadly weapon means any weapon, device, instrument, material \r\n  or substance which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used is known \r\n  to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury, that is what a deadly \r\n  weapon is.\r\n\r\n          Under the law of our State a pistol is a deadly weapon.\r\n(Emphases added).\r\nPetitioner objects to the malice charge on the basis the court instructed \r\n  the jury could find express malice where, by the use of words, there is manifested \r\n  a deliberate intention to violently and unlawfully take the life of another.  \r\n  Petitioner argues this language comments on the facts of the case because the \r\n  State was attempting to rely on prior statements by the defendant in an effort \r\n  to show malice.  See State v. Jackson, 297 S.C. 523, 377 S.E.2d \r\n  570 (1989) (trial court should refrain from all comment that tends to indicate \r\n  to jury his opinion on credibility of witnesses, weight of evidence, or guilt \r\n  of accused). \r\nThe charge given does not refer to prior statements.  The \r\n  trial court indicated malice could be expressed with words, that malice must \r\n  accompany the physical act of killing, that there must be a coincidence \r\n  in the guilty act and the state of mind, and that, â€œ[e]ven if the defendant \r\n  had . . . malice at some point in the past he has not committed murder unless \r\n  the malice actually existed at the time of the killing.â€  Further, the court \r\n  instructed the jury that it was the sole arbiter of the facts and the credibility \r\n  of the witnesses.  Accordingly, the courtâ€™s instructions to the jury when considered \r\n  as a whole are not reversible.  See State v. Jackson, supra \r\n  (jury instructions must be considered as whole and, if as whole, they are free \r\n  from error, any isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute \r\n  reversible error).\r\nAdditionally, as stated in State v. Jackson, the test is what \r\n  a reasonable juror would have understood the charge as meaning.  It is unlikely \r\n  that a reasonable juror would have singled out this portion of the charge and \r\n  interpreted it as an opinion on the facts of this case or as an instruction \r\n  as to the weight to be given the evidence.\r\nPetitioner also objects to the courtâ€™s statement that a pistol is \r\n  a deadly weapon under South Carolina law as a comment on the facts of the case.  \r\n  However, under the law of South Carolina, a pistol is a deadly weapon.  See \r\n  State v. Campbell, 287 S.C. 377, 339 S.E.2d 109 (1985) (deadly weapon \r\n  is generally defined as any article, instrument or substance which is likely \r\n  to produce death or great bodily harm); cf. State v. Heck, 304 \r\n  S.C. 345, 404 S.E.2d 514 (Ct. App. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1043 \r\n  (1992) (BB gun found to be deadly weapon for purposes of armed robbery charge).  \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court properly charged the jury on the law, i.e. \r\n  that a pistol is a deadly weapon for the purposes of inferring malice.\r\nISSUE VI\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by commenting on the facts when explaining deadly force \r\n  to the jury?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues the court erred when explaining deadly force to the jury.  \r\n  The court charged the jury:\r\n\r\nExamples of an act of provocation which would be sufficient would \r\n  be an unprovoked assault.  By the same token, the exercise of a legal right \r\n  no matter how offensive to another is never in the law deemed a provocation \r\n  sufficient to justify or to mitigate an act of violence.  That which is perfectly \r\n  justifiable on the part of the deceased cannot in anyway [sic] be legal provocation \r\n  to the slayer.\r\n In that regard, a person, a law enforcement officer may use whatever \r\n  force is necessary to effect the arrest of a felon including deadly force, if \r\n  necessary, to effect that arrest.\r\n\r\n(Emphases added).\r\nIn general, the trial court is required to charge only the current \r\n  and correct law of South Carolina.  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, \r\n  565 S.E.2d 298 (2002).  A jury charge is correct if it contains the correct \r\n  definition of the law when read as a whole.  Id.\r\nThe trial court correctly stated that an exercise of a legal right \r\n  is never deemed a provocation sufficient to justify or to mitigate an act of \r\n  violence.  The trial court also properly charged that an officer may use whatever \r\n  force is necessary to effect the arrest of a felon including deadly force to \r\n  effect that arrest.  See Tennessee v.  Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985) \r\n  (during felony arrest, if arresting officer has probable cause to believe suspect \r\n  poses threat of serious physical harm, officer may prevent escape by using deadly \r\n  force).  This correct legal charge also conformed to the evidence in this case.  \r\n  See State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 260 S.E.2d 719 (1979) (trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s inclusion of lack of consent was not impermissible charge on facts of \r\n  case, but rather correct statement of law, in conformity with the evidence).  \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in his explanation of deadly force.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision to deny petitionerâ€™s request \r\n  for a belated review of his direct appeal issues.  After a review of petitionerâ€™s \r\n  direct appeal issues, we affirm.\r\nREVERSE, GRANT BELATED REVIEW, AND AFFIRM.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Out \r\n    of the fourteen who said they had formed an opinion petitioner was guilty, \r\n    six persons stated they could set that opinion aside for trial.  Of those \r\n    six persons, one was empanelled as an alternate on the jury. \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2] The jury that was empanelled consisted of eleven people who had been \r\n    exposed to the pretrial publicity and had not formed an opinion as to petitionerâ€™s \r\n    guilt.  One person had not been exposed to the publicity.  The three alternates \r\n    consisted of two people who had not formed an opinion from the publicity and \r\n    one person who had formed the opinion that petitioner was guilty but that \r\n    person stated he could set that opinion aside.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Petitioner \r\n    also argues the State failed to produce two prior statements of Nancy Workman \r\n    until the conclusion of Workmanâ€™s direct testimony.  However, Workmanâ€™s statements \r\n    were not included in the record.  Accordingly, the Stateâ€™s failure to produce \r\n    Workmanâ€™s statements to petitioner will not be considered.  See Rule \r\n    210(h), SCACR (â€œExcept as provided by Rule 212 and Rule 208(b)(1)(C) and (2), \r\n    the appellate court will not consider any fact which does not appear in the \r\n    Record on Appeal.â€).\r\n  Further, although counsel was given Workmanâ€™s prior \r\n    statements before cross-examination commenced, counsel did not question Workman \r\n    as to those statements.  When defense counsel brought to the courtâ€™s attention \r\n    that the State had failed to timely produce the statements, the court informed \r\n    defense counsel that Workman could be recalled for whatever purpose counsel \r\n    desired.  Defense counsel did not recall Workman to testify.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Petitioner \r\n    testified, the second time he fled from the officer, the officer was not chasing \r\n    him and so he hid behind a barn.  He then saw the officer running down the \r\n    street and he assumed the officer was gone.  Suddenly, an unknown person choked \r\n    him from behind.  He could not get the person to stop choking him so he reached \r\n    in his back pocket, retrieved his gun and shot two times.  He testified he \r\n    was still being choked and when he finally got the person off of his neck, \r\n    he turned around and shot without trying to see who had been choking him.  \r\n    He shot until his gun was empty.  He testified he then realized he had shot \r\n    the officer.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Later, \r\n    in his direct testimony, petitioner denied making the statements and denied \r\n    he saw Lynch.  Thereafter, on cross-examination, petitioner testified Lynch \r\n    may have overheard something he and his friends were talking about.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] Rule \r\n    803(3) provides that a statement of the declarantâ€™s then existing state of \r\n    mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, \r\n    design) is excluded from the hearsay rule, even if the declarant is available \r\n    as a witness.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] â€œDeclarantâ€ \r\n    is defined as a person who makes a statement.  Rule 801(b), SCRE. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8] If \r\n    the State had cross-examined petitioner and obtained a denial that he made \r\n    the statement, the State could have admitted Lynchâ€™s testimony in its reply \r\n    as nonhearsay under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). \r\n\r\n \r\n   [9] In \r\n    any event, the statement is admissible under Rule 803(3) because it is a statement \r\n    of petitionerâ€™s intent to kill a police officer if an officer attempted to \r\n    arrest him.  See State v. Garcia, 334 S.C. 71, 512 S.E.2d 507 \r\n    (1999) (statement must relate to present or look to future, but cannot look \r\n    back to past condition).   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25797","title":"Helena Chemical Company v.

The trial court granted summary judgment \r\n  for the insurers, and Helena appeals.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nHelena is in the business of formulating, \r\n  distributing, and selling agricultural chemicals, including pesticides, to the \r\n  farming industry. [1]   Helena began its South Carolina \r\n  operations in 1970 when it merged with Blue Chemical Company.  At issue in the \r\n  instant case are three of Helenaâ€™s South Carolina sitesâ€”Fairfax, Cameron, and \r\n  Mayesvilleâ€”where, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \r\n  and the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), \r\n  Helena conducted extensive cleanups of polluted soil.\r\nThe majority of the costs Helena is seeking \r\n  relate to the Fairfax site.  In December 1988, the EPA advised Helena in a letter \r\n  that it considered Helena a â€œpotentially responsible partyâ€ (PRP) for pollution \r\n  at the Fairfax site.  The EPA told Helena that pursuant to the Comprehensive \r\n  Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), it \r\n  was â€œconsidering spending public funds to respond to the release and threatened \r\n  release of hazardous substances and contaminated materialsâ€ at the Fairfax site, \r\n  unless such action would be done â€œproperly by a responsible party.â€  The letter \r\n  encouraged Helena to â€œundertake voluntary cleanup activitiesâ€ and invited Helena \r\n  to commence â€œformal negotiationsâ€ with the agency.\r\nIn response to the letter, Helena entered \r\n  into an agreement with the EPA and conducted a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility \r\n  Study (RI/FS).  The RI/FS revealed that there was significant environmental \r\n  damage to the soil, and Helena conducted a major removal and off-site disposal \r\n  action of pesticide-contaminated soil.  In its complaint, Helena sought legal \r\n  defense costs and over $8 million for â€œresponding to and addressingâ€ the claims \r\n  made by the EPA and DHEC.\r\nWith regard to pollution at Helenaâ€™s Cameron \r\n  site, DHEC informed Helena in 1994 that it considered Helena to be a â€œpotentially \r\n  responsible partyâ€ (PRP) under CERCLA.  Although Helena did not enter into any \r\n  formal agreement, it did conduct a removal of pesticide-contaminated soil at \r\n  the Cameron site, incurring over $1 million in costs.  \r\nWith regard to pollution at Helenaâ€™s Mayesville \r\n  site, DHEC notified Helena in 1995 that it had found pesticide contamination, \r\n  and Helena conducted a cleanup there as well.\r\nThe insurers denied Helena coverage for \r\n  the monies expended for the cleanups.  Helena instituted this declaratory judgment \r\n  action seeking reimbursement for all costs incurred.  The trial court granted \r\n  summary judgment in the insurersâ€™ favor.  Specifically, the trial court found \r\n  there was no insurance coverage because: (1) Helenaâ€™s cleanup costs were not \r\n  â€œdamagesâ€ and (2) Helenaâ€™s claims fell under the insurance policiesâ€™ pollution \r\n  exclusion.  Additionally, the trial court granted summary judgment on Helenaâ€™s \r\n  bad faith claims, holding that the insurers had a reasonable basis to deny coverage.\r\nHelena now appeals, asking this Court \r\n  to consider the following issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court err in finding that the costs incurred by Helena were not \r\n  â€œdamagesâ€ within the meaning of the insurance policies?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court err in finding that the pollution releases were not â€œsudden \r\n  and accidental,â€ and therefore Helenaâ€™s claims were barred under the policiesâ€™ \r\n  pollution exclusion?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment on Helenaâ€™s bad faith claims?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.       â€œDamagesâ€\r\nEach insurance policy issued to Helena \r\n  specifies that the insurer will pay the insured for all sums the insured is \r\n  â€œlegally obligated to payâ€ as â€œdamagesâ€ because of property damage. [2]   Helena argues the trial court erred when it \r\n  decided as a matter of law that the environmental cleanup costs did not qualify \r\n  as â€œdamages.â€  We agree.\r\nThe trial court found that the plain, \r\n  ordinary, and popular meaning of the term â€œdamagesâ€ does not include environmental \r\n  cleanup costs because these costs are not sums payable to a third party as a \r\n  result of a lawsuit brought by that party.  The trial court relied primarily \r\n  on two Fourth Circuit cases:  Maryland Cas. Co. v. Armco, Inc., 822 F.2d \r\n  1348 (4th Cir. 1987) and Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Milliken and Co., \r\n  857 F.2d 979 (4th Cir. 1988).\r\nIn Armco, the Fourth Circuit was predicting \r\n  Maryland law.  The Armco court noted Marylandâ€™s rule of construction \r\n  for insurance contracts that the policy terms should be given their ordinary \r\n  meaning.  Armco, 822 F.2d at 1352.  Nonetheless, the court held that \r\n  the term â€œâ€˜damagesâ€™ is to be construed in consonance with its â€˜accepted technical \r\n  meaning in law.â€™â€  Id. (emphasis added, citation omitted).  The court \r\n  explained there was a difference between legal and equitable damages, and this \r\n  technical meaning of â€œdamagesâ€ encompassed only legal damages, i.e., payments \r\n  to a third party who has a legal claim for damages.  Id. (citation omitted).\r\nThe underlying lawsuit in Armco was an action \r\n  brought by the United States against Armco for reimbursement of remedial costs \r\n  and injunctive relief in connection with the cleanup of a hazardous waste site.  \r\n  Because the relief sought by the United States was equitable and remedial in \r\n  nature, the Armco court held there was no insurance coverage:  â€œThe general \r\n  comprehensive liability policy â€¦ covers â€˜damages,â€™ but not the expenditures \r\n  which result from complying with the directives of regulatory agencies.â€  Id.  \r\n  The court noted that if â€œdamagesâ€ were given a broad meaning, then the term \r\n  â€œdamagesâ€ in the contract â€œwould become mere surplusage, because any obligation \r\n  to pay would be covered.â€  Id.\r\nIn Milliken, the Fourth Circuit applied \r\n  South Carolina law and followed Armcoâ€™s reasoning:\r\n\r\nWe perceive no material distinctions between the South Carolina \r\n  and Maryland laws in the construction and interpretation of insurance policies \r\n  that should cause us to deviate from Armco â€¦.  Absent ambiguity, in South \r\n  Carolina the language of an insurance policy is given its plain, ordinary, and \r\n  popular meaning.â€¦  In the insurance context the word â€œdamagesâ€ is not ambiguous.  \r\n  It means legal damages.â€¦  We have no doubt that South Carolina law, in concert \r\n  with Maryland and Missouri, would recognize that a general comprehensive liability \r\n  policy which obligated the insurer to pay â€œall sums which the insured shall \r\n  become legally obligated to pay as damagesâ€ would not cover claims for which \r\n  the insured is equitably obligated to pay.\r\n\r\n857 F.2d 980-81 (citations omitted).\r\nBut when faced with the same issue presented \r\n  in the instant case, the highest state court in Maryland flatly rejected \r\n  the reasoning and holding of Armco.  See Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v. \r\n  Utica Mut. Ins. Co., 625 A.2d 1021 (Md. 1993).  The Bausch &amp; Lomb \r\n  court held that the ordinary and accepted meaning of damages was not a narrow, \r\n  technical one, but instead was a broad one, encompassing environmental response \r\n  costs, even when those costs are incurred without a government directive.  \r\n  The Maryland court stated as follows:\r\n\r\nTo the extent it suggests that the term â€œdamagesâ€ imports \r\n  a distinctively legal meaning in insurance matters, Armco misperceives \r\n  the law of Maryland.â€¦ [W]e accord to words their usual and accepted signification.  \r\n  â€œDamagesâ€ in common usage means the reparation in money for a detriment or injury \r\n  sustained.  The reasonably prudent layperson does not cut nice distinctions \r\n  between the remedies offered at law and in equity.  Absent an express provision \r\n  in the document itself, insurance policy-holders surely do not anticipate that \r\n  coverage will depend on the mode of relief, i.e. a cash payment rather than \r\n  an injunction, sought by an injured party.  Policy-holders will, instead, reasonably \r\n  infer that the insurer's pledge to pay damages will apply generally to compensatory \r\n  outlays of various kinds, including expenditures made to comply with administrative \r\n  orders or formal injunctions.  The ordinary person understands â€œdamagesâ€ as \r\n  meaning money paid to make good an insured loss.â€¦ In this context, environmental \r\n  response costs fall within that definition.\r\n\r\nId. at 1032-33 (footnote omitted).\r\nWe agree with the reasoning of the Bausch \r\n  &amp; Lomb court.  As that court pointed out, the Fourth Circuitâ€™s logic \r\n  contains an inherent paradox:  although insurance policy terms are to be construed \r\n  in their ordinary and usual way, the Armco and Milliken courts \r\n  both accorded the term â€œdamagesâ€ a narrow, technical meaning.  This goes against \r\n  South Carolina precedent which holds that this Court must give policy language \r\n  its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.  E.g., Century Indem. Co. \r\n  v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 565, 561 S.E.2d 355, 358 (2002).  \r\n\r\nThe plain, ordinary meaning of â€œdamagesâ€ is monies \r\n  paid on an insuredâ€™s loss, in this case, from property damage.  An â€œordinaryâ€ \r\n  meaning of the term is not a legalistic one dependent on whether the damages \r\n  are classified as legal versus equitable.  See, e.g., Bausch \r\n  &amp; Lomb, 625 A.2d at 779; A.Y. McDonald Indus., Inc. v. Ins. Co. of \r\n  N. Am., 475 N.W.2d 607, 619 (Iowa 1991) (â€œThe policy language, â€˜all sums \r\n  which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of \r\n  property damage,â€™ can reasonably be interpreted to cover any claim asserted \r\n  against the insured arising out of property damage, which requires the expenditure \r\n  of money, regardless of whether the claim can be characterized as legal or equitable \r\n  in nature.â€); Farmland Indus., Inc. v. Republic Ins. Co., 941 S.W.2d \r\n  505, 510 (Mo. 1997)  (â€œTo give words in an insurance contract a technical meaning \r\n  simply by reading them â€˜in the insurance context,â€™ would render meaningless \r\n  our lawâ€™s requirement that words be given their ordinary meaning unless a technical \r\n  meaning is plainly intended.â€).\r\nWe note further that there \r\n  is a split of authority over whether environmental cleanup costs constitute \r\n  â€œdamagesâ€ under an insurance policy.  The majority of state courts have held \r\n  that there is coverage for these costs.  See, e.g., Outboard \r\n  Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 607 N.E.2d 1204 (Ill. 1992); A.Y. \r\n  McDonald Indus., Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 475 S.W.2d at 622; Bausch \r\n  &amp; Lomb,625 A.2d at 1033; Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Travelers \r\n  Indem. Co., 457 N.W.2d 175 (Minn. 1990); Farmland Indus., Inc. v. Republic \r\n  Ins. Co., 941 S.W.2d at 509; Coakley v. Maine Bonding and Cas. Co., \r\n  618 A.2d 777 (N.H. 1992); C.D. Spangler Constr. Co. v. Indus. Crankshaft \r\n  &amp; Engâ€™g Co., 388 S.E.2d 557 (N.C. 1990); Boeing Co. v. Aetna Cas. \r\n  and Sur. Co., 784 P.2d 507 (Wash. 1990).  But see Certain \r\n  Underwriters at Lloydâ€™s of London v. Superior Court, 16 P.3d 94, 106 (Cal. \r\n  2001); Patrons Oxford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Marois, 573 A.2d 16 (Me. 1990).\r\nMoreover, the fact that â€œdifferent \r\n  courts have construed the language of an insurance policy differently is some \r\n  indication of ambiguity.â€  Greenville County v. Ins. Reserve Fund, 313 \r\n  S.C. 546, 548, 443 S.E.2d 552, 553 (1994).  Where the words of an insurance \r\n  policy are capable of two reasonable interpretations, the construction most \r\n  favorable to the insured should be adopted.  Id. at 547-48, 443 S.E.2d \r\n  at 553 (citations omitted).  Therefore, the split of authority amongst the other \r\n  courts that have addressed this issue militates in favor of a finding of ambiguity \r\n  and an interpretation in favor of the insured.  Id.; accord A.Y. McDonald \r\n  Indus., 475 N.W.2d at 619 (viewing the term â€œdamagesâ€ as ambiguous and holding \r\n  that â€œthe ordinary meaning of â€˜damagesâ€™ is broad enough to include government \r\n  mandated response or cleanup costs under CERCLA and similar state environmental \r\n  protection statutesâ€); C.D. Spangler Constr. Co. v. Indus. Crankshaft and \r\n  Engâ€™g Co., 388 S.E.2d at 569 (finding that â€œdamagesâ€ is capable of â€œseveral \r\n  reasonable interpretationsâ€ and concluding that â€œa â€˜reasonable person in the \r\n  position of the insuredâ€™ may have understood that the term â€˜damagesâ€™ included \r\n  state-ordered environmental cleanup costsâ€). \r\nNonetheless, in the present case, the insurers \r\n  argue that the trial courtâ€™s ruling is correct pursuant to the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion in Braswell v. Faircloth, 300 S.C. 338, 387 S.E.2d 707 (Ct. App. \r\n  1989).  Braswell, however, does not support the insurersâ€™ argument.  \r\n  In Braswell, a lessee of property (the insured) left hazardous waste \r\n  on the lessorâ€™s property.  The corrosive chemicals left by the insured ate through \r\n  a valve on one of the storage tanks and 1000 gallons of chemicals spilled onto \r\n  a field adjacent to the tank.  DHEC later issued an administrative consent order \r\n  requiring the cleanup of the property.  When the lessor sued the insured, the \r\n  insurer denied coverage.  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor \r\n  of the insurer, finding neither an â€˜occurrenceâ€™ nor â€˜property damage.â€™\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed in part, finding \r\n  the chemical spill constituted an â€˜occurrence,â€™ and therefore the cleanup costs \r\n  associated with the spill should be covered by the insurer.  But because most \r\n  of the costs were for removal of stored wastes that had not leaked, the Court \r\n  of Appeals held these costs were not recoverable since no property damage had \r\n  yet resulted.  In making this holding, the Court of Appeals cited both Armco \r\n  and Milliken, apparently approving of these cases.  The courtâ€™s holding, \r\n  however, clearly rested upon a finding that there was no â€˜property damage,â€™ \r\n  not on an interpretation of the term â€˜damages.â€™  For this reason, the Braswell \r\n  courtâ€™s reliance on the Fourth Circuit cases was misplaced. [3] \r\nFor all of the above reasons, we find the trial \r\n  court erred in ruling that Helenaâ€™s environmental cleanup costs were not â€œdamagesâ€ \r\n  contemplated under the insurance policies.  We specifically reject the reasoning \r\n  of Armco and Milliken, and instead, align South Carolina with \r\n  the majority of jurisdictions that have allowed insurance coverage for this \r\n  type of loss, provided that an exclusion does not apply.\r\nII.      Pollution Exclusion\r\nNext, Helena argues the trial court erred in finding the pollution exclusion \r\n  in the insurance policies barred Helenaâ€™s claims.  Helena contends there is \r\n  a genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment on this issue.  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAll of the insurance policies contain a pollution \r\n  exclusion, which states that coverage does not apply to:\r\n\r\nproperty damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release \r\n  or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids \r\n  or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into \r\n  or upon land, the atmosphere or any water course or body of water; but this \r\n  exclusion does not apply if such discharge, release or escape is sudden and \r\n  accidental.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). [4]   Accordingly, property damage \r\n  caused by pollution arising from ordinary business operations is not covered.  \r\n  But if the damage were caused by a â€œsudden and accidentalâ€ discharge, release, \r\n  or escape of pollutants, then the insurers must provide coverage. \r\nIn Greenville County \r\n  v. Ins. Reserve Fund, 313 S.C. 546, 443 S.E.2d 552 (1994), this Court specifically \r\n  held that the term â€œsuddenâ€ is to be interpreted as â€œunexpected.â€  Consequently, \r\n  we must determine whether the discharge, release, or escape of the pesticide \r\n  was unexpected and accidental.\r\nThe trial court found \r\n  that Helena had not put forth any evidence on the cause of the contamination \r\n  and thus had not met its burden to create a factual issue. [5]   According to the trial court, \r\n  the evidence showed that the pesticide contamination resulted from the â€œincidental \r\n  release of pesticides during the routine operations of grinding pesticide into \r\n  dust, loading, unloading, bagging and formulating pesticides.â€  Respondents \r\n  argue that because the contamination was caused by Helenaâ€™s â€œroutineâ€ operations, \r\n  the releases of pesticide could not be considered unexpected and accidental.  \r\n  Helena, on the other hand, argues the releases were not â€œroutine,â€ and thus \r\n  the evidence permits the conclusion that the releases were unexpected and accidental.  \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the \r\n  record, we find that the contamination at the various sites was caused by Helenaâ€™s \r\n  routine business operations and was, therefore, not unexpected and accidental.  \r\n  For that reason, we hold that Helenaâ€™s claims do not fall within the exception \r\n  to the pollution exclusion, and thus the insurance companies are not liable \r\n  for the environmental cleanup in this case.   \r\nHelena employees tell \r\n  a story of routine contamination that occurred during the ordinary course of \r\n  operations.  First, Bobby Pace, who worked for Helena for 38 years, testified \r\n  about the release of dust into the air during grinding operations:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         Q.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  And dust, is that referring to the fact that dust at some points in the operations \r\n  at Fairfax escaped into the environment?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  There would be some dust.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Do you know in general how that dust would have escaped during the formulating \r\n  process?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Yes. â€¦ In formulation you have a grinding operation.  Creates a lot of dust.  \r\n  And you normally call it a baghouse that collects the dust, but it did not collect \r\n  100 percent of it so some dust would get out into the atmosphere.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Q.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  All right.  So even during Helenaâ€™s operations, do I understand correctly that \r\n  at least some percentage of the dust that is released by the grinding operation \r\n  would have actually escaped out of the processing area?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Itâ€™s possible, if the dust collectors were not operating 100 percent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n Pace also explained that bags \r\n  of pesticide would break open during the loading and unloading process, causing \r\n  pesticide particles to escape into the air and onto the loading docks.  Pace \r\n  described the breaking open of bags as just â€œsomething that happens.â€     \r\nSecond, James Blue, the founder \r\n  of Blue Chemical Company (which merged with Helena around 1970), testified as \r\n  to dust spillage:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q.&nbsp;\r\n         In the regular day-to-day usage of the facility was \r\n  there ever any just in the normal in the course of doing operations amounts \r\n  that were spilled?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Well, generally if you take a dust mill, sure, youâ€™ve \r\n  got spillage on the floor.  But that stuff is swept up, put back in the blender \r\n  and bagged back up.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn addition to dust \r\n  spillage, Blue testified as to the spillage of liquid pesticide that occurred \r\n  when pesticide was transferred from rail cars and trucks to Helenaâ€™s storage \r\n  tanks.  He stated there â€œprobably was someâ€ spillage when the liquid pesticide \r\n  was pumped into the storage tanks.  Further, in the absence of a major, accidental \r\n  spill, Blue explained that any liquid release would be â€œvery small.â€  He also \r\n  admitted that such spillage, though small, was a normal part of operations, \r\n  and he could not recall a single instance in which a sudden or accidental spill \r\n  occurred at the various sites.                \r\nThird, Charles Hooks, a Blue Chemical \r\n  salesman, testified that liquid contaminants routinely spilled onto the ground.  \r\n  Hooks explained that the liquid chemical toxaphene was brought in by rail and \r\n  tank cars.  Upon arrival, the chemical would be pumped into storage tanks through \r\n  a hose.  When the hose was disconnected, small amounts of toxaphene would drip \r\n  out.  Hooks testified that â€œ[t]here was probably a small amount [of leakage] \r\n  every time you disconnected the couplings from the bottom of the tank car.â€  \r\n  Finally, Hooks testified that it was standard procedure, at the time, to deliver \r\n  toxaphene to the sites in this manner.     \r\nA plant inspection conducted by \r\n  Helena at the Mayesville site in 1985â€”to â€œlook at possible environmental problemsâ€â€”confirmed \r\n  that contamination had occurred in the area where the trucks and railroad cars \r\n  unloaded as described by Hooks.  In addition, the inspection revealed that â€œthe \r\n  railroad track area around the warehouse door show[ed] signs of contamination.â€  \r\n\r\nLastly, James Whosendove, \r\n  a Helena employee of 13 years, testified that he could not remember any unexpected \r\n  events in which tanks leaked, fell over, exploded, or otherwise caused a sudden \r\n  emission of pesticides into the atmosphere or ground.  \r\nTogether, these testimonies lead \r\n  to no other conclusion than that routine discharge of pollutants occurred at \r\n  the various Helena facilities during ordinary operations.     \r\nSummary judgment is \r\n  proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  R. J. Hendricks, II v. Clemson \r\n  Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 455, 578 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2003) (citation omitted).  \r\n  This Court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light \r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Id. at 455-56, 578 S.E.2d at \r\n  714.  Furthermore, since it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be \r\n  cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a \r\n  trial on disputed factual issues.  Baughman v. Am. Tel. and Tel. Co., \r\n  306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991).\r\nGiven that Helena did not present \r\n  any evidence that the pollution damages at issue here were the result of unexpected \r\n  or accidental discharges of pesticide and other contaminants, we find that the \r\n  trial court properly resolved an issue of fact when it decided that the pollution \r\n  releases were not sudden and accidental.  Accordingly, the exception to the \r\n  pollution exclusion does not apply, and the insurance companies are not liable \r\n  for the environmental cleanup.\r\nIII.    Bad Faith Claims\r\nThe trial court also decided that \r\n  the insurers were entitled to summary judgment on Helenaâ€™s bad faith claims.  \r\n  Helena argues this was error.  We disagree.\r\nUnder South Carolina law, an insurer \r\n  acts in bad faith when there is no reasonable basis to support the insurerâ€™s \r\n  decision.  Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. \r\n  1, 466 S.E.2d 727 (1996).  But â€œ[i]f there is a reasonable ground for contesting \r\n  a claim, there is no bad faith.â€  Crossley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \r\n  Co., 307 S.C. 354, 360, 415 S.E.2d 393, 397 (1992).\r\nThe insurers had a reasonable \r\n  ground for contesting the claims associated with recovering the environmental \r\n  cleanup costs.  The Fourth Circuitâ€™s Milliken decision, which predicted \r\n  South Carolina law, certainly provides a reasonable basis for finding that the \r\n  cleanup costs were not â€œdamagesâ€ within the meaning of the policies.  Therefore, \r\n  the insurers did not improperly contest coverage, and the trial court correctly \r\n  granted summary judgment on the bad faith claims. [6] \r\nConclusion\r\nIn sum, we hold that the plain, ordinary meaning \r\n  of â€œdamagesâ€ includes environmental cleanup costs.  Therefore, the trial court \r\n  erred in granting summary judgment on this issue.  But because no genuine issue \r\n  of material fact was presented that would lead a jury to conclude that the manner \r\n  in which pollutants were discharged on the property was sudden and accidental, \r\n  the trial judge properly granted summary judgment in favor of the insurers as \r\n  to the pollution exclusion issue.  Finally, given that the insurers had a reasonable \r\n  ground for contesting Helenaâ€™s claims, summary judgment was properly granted \r\n  as to the bad faith claims as well.  \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is AFFIRMED IN \r\n  PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice J. Ernest \r\n  Kinard, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Pesticide formulation consists of mixing a product with agricultural \r\n    chemicals in order to get the desired concentration.  Helena formulates both \r\n    dry and liquid pesticides.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Although the exact language in the policies differs somewhat, this \r\n    is essentially how the policies define general coverage.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Further, despite the seemingly positive treatment of Armco \r\n    and Milliken, Braswell ultimately allowed insurance coverage \r\n    for environmental cleanup costs where property damage had occurred.  Thus, \r\n    it is questionable whether Braswell actually applied the holdings of \r\n    Armco and Milliken.  Indeed, in a recent Fourth Circuit case, \r\n    a concurring judge has made this same observation.  See Ellett Brothers, \r\n    Inc. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 275 F.3d 384, 389 (4th \r\n    Cir. 2001) (Michael, J., concurring), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 818, 123 \r\n    S. Ct. 94 (2002) (where Judge Michael stated that â€œthe ultimate holding in \r\n    Braswell appears to conflict with Millikenâ€™s legal/equitable \r\n    distinctionâ€).  We agree with Judge Michael that Braswell actually \r\n    rejected Millikenâ€™s â€œcategorical rule excluding equitable relief from \r\n    the term â€˜damages.â€™â€  Id. at 390.  Thus, to the extent Braswell \r\n    could be read to approve of the logic in Armco and Milliken, \r\n    it is hereby modified.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  There are minor variations among the pollution exclusion clauses.  \r\n    Some policies state that the exception to the exclusion applies if the pollution \r\n    is caused by a â€œsudden, unintended, and unexpected happening.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [5]  We note the trial court \r\n    also made a finding that while the insurers bear the burden of proving that \r\n    the exclusion applies, Helena bears the burden of proving the exception to \r\n    the exclusion.  This is a novel issue in South Carolina, and there exists \r\n    a split of authority in other jurisdictions.  Compare N. Ins. Co. \r\n    v. Aardvark Assocs., Inc., 942 F.2d 189, 194-95 (3d Cir. 1991) (noting \r\n    split on the question but predicting that under Pennsylvania law, the insured \r\n    bears the burden) with New Castle County v. Hartford Accident &amp; \r\n    Indem. Co., 933 F.2d 1162, 1181-82 (3d Cir. 1991) (also noting split, \r\n    but predicting that under Delaware law, the insurer bears the burden).  We \r\n    agree with the trial court that it is the insured who bears the burden of \r\n    proving an exception to the exclusion.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  In their brief, respondents raise an additional sustaining ground \r\n    for summary judgment involving an issue related to the excess insurers on \r\n    which the trial court did not rule.  We decline to address this issue.  \r\n    Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d \r\n    716, 723 (2000) (â€œIt is within the appellate courtâ€™s discretion whether to \r\n    address any additional sustaining grounds.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
