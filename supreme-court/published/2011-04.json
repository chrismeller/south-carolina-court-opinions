McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney\r\n        General Deborah R. J. Shupe, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia, Solicitor Scarlett Anne Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:&nbsp; Ferris Geiger Singley was convicted of burglary and armed robbery in an incident involving a home which he jointly owned with his\r\nmother and brother.&nbsp; On appeal, Singley argues his first degree burglary conviction must be reversed because of his ownership interest in the house.&nbsp;\r\nWe granted certiorari to review the decision of the court of appeals, which affirmed Singley's conviction.&nbsp; We likewise affirm and find ownership does not\r\npreclude a burglary conviction as a matter of law, and we take this opportunity to expand upon the reasoning of the court of appeals.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBy virtue of intestate succession, Singley inherited a 12.5 percent interest in his childhood home from his father in August 2001.&nbsp; His brother owns an\r\nadditional 12.5 percent, and his mother owns the remaining 75 percent.&nbsp; Singley remained in the house until his early twenties, and then returned again in\r\nApril 2005.&nbsp; He resided there for three weeks, until his mother &quot;put him out&quot; of the house.&nbsp; He did not return his key to his mother,\r\ntelling her that he had lost it.&nbsp; As between Singley and his mother, Singley did not have permission to return to the house.&nbsp; It was not until one\r\nnight in early October 2005, some six months later, that he did so.\r\nOn that night, Singley's mother was at a bar with friends, returning home at approximately 2:30 am.&nbsp; While she was out of the house, Singley entered\r\nthrough a back window after climbing a small stepladder.&nbsp; When she returned, Singley jumped out from behind her and put a knife to her throat.&nbsp; He\r\nthreatened to kill her if she screamed, and then demanded money from her.&nbsp; After she complied with his requests, he forced her into her bedroom and tied\r\nher to the bed using jogging pants, medical tape, and pajamas.&nbsp; He threw her telephone out the window and ordered her to wait twenty minutes before\r\nattempting to find help.&nbsp; Once she was sure Singley had left and would not return, his mother freed herself from her restraints and went to a neighbor's\r\nhouse to call the police.&nbsp; Police arrested Singley at his residence, which was around the corner from his mother's house.\r\nSingley was indicted for first degree burglary, armed robbery, and kidnapping.&nbsp; Singley moved for a directed verdict on all charges.&nbsp; As to the\r\nburglary charge, Singley argued that because he is a part owner of the house and there was no order of protection or similar legal instrument divesting him of\r\nhis right to enter it, the State failed to prove that he entered the house without the consent of a person in lawful possession.&nbsp; In essence, he argued\r\nthat because he was a person in lawful possession, he could enter freely without his mother's consent.&nbsp; The circuit court denied Singley's motion.&nbsp;\r\nThe jury found Singley guilty of burglary and armed robbery, but it acquitted him of kidnapping.&nbsp; The circuit court sentenced Singley to consecutive\r\nsentences of life without parole.&nbsp; On appeal to the court of appeals, Singley challenged only his burglary conviction. State v. Singley, 383 S.C.\r\n441, 441, 679 S.E.2d 538, 539 (Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp; He repeated the arguments he made at the directed verdict stage that one cannot commit burglary by breaking\r\ninto one's own dwelling. Id.&nbsp; The court of appeals affirmed, holding that Singley's mother was the sole possessor of the dwelling when the burglary\r\noccurred, and therefore her consent was needed to enter. Id. at 447, 679 S.E.2d at 542.\r\nISSUE PRESENTED\r\nSingley raises one issue on appeal: does his ownership interest in the home preclude a conviction of burglary as a matter of law?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe trial court must grant a motion for directed verdict of acquittal when the State fails to produce any evidence of the crime charged. State v. Parris,\r\n363 S.C. 477, 481, 611 S.E.2d 501, 502 (2005).&nbsp; At that juncture, the court is concerned only with the existence of evidence, not its weight. Id. at\r\n481, 611 S.E.2d at 502-03.&nbsp; &quot;If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the\r\naccused, the Court must find the case properly submitted to the jury.&quot; Id. at 481, 611 S.E.2d at 503.&nbsp; We will view all evidence in the light\r\nmost favorable to the State. Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSingley argues that because he has an ownership interest in the house without any legal impediment to his right to possess, he cannot be guilty of burglary\r\nas a matter of law.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe statute for first degree burglary provides, in pertinent part, &quot;A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a dwelling\r\nwithout consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling, and . . . the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n16-11-311(A)(3) (2003).&nbsp; It goes on to define entering without consent in part as, &quot;[t]o enter a building without the consent of the person in lawful\r\npossession.&quot; Id. Â§ 16-11-310(3)(a).&nbsp; The code provides no further guidance.&nbsp; Singley only challenges the possession element of\r\nburglary.&nbsp; More specifically, he only argues his ownership interest insulates him from a conviction of burglary; he does not contend he had consent from\r\nhis mother to enter the home, and he does not allege his mother did not have a possessory interest in it.\r\nWe have maintained consistently for well over one hundred years that burglary is a crime against possession and habitation, not a crime against ownership. State\r\nv. Clamp, 225 S.C. 89, 102, 80 S.E.2d 918, 924 (1954); State v. Alford, 142 S.C. 43, 45, 140 S.E. 261, 262 (1927); State v. Trapp, 17 S.C.\r\n467, 471 (1882).&nbsp; In those cases, we held that the victim listed in the indictment need not be the owner of the dwelling burglarized; it is sufficient that\r\nthe alleged victim was the occupant and possessor of the dwelling. See Clamp, 225 S.C. at 102, 80 S.E.2d at 924; Alford, 142 S.C. at 45Â­Â­Â­, 140\r\nS.E. at 262; Trapp 17 S.C. at 472.[1]&nbsp; The focus accordingly was on the victim's possessory interest, and\r\nthe defendant's ownership or possession of the dwelling was not an issue.&nbsp; The same is true for the cases from other jurisdictions relied upon by the court\r\nof appeals in its decision. See Murphy v. State, 234 S.E.2d 911, 914 (Ga. 1977) (&quot;The defendant contends that the state failed to prove that\r\nthe dwelling was entered 'without authority' of the owner.&nbsp; The state proved that the dwelling was entered without authority from the victim, the lawful\r\noccupant.&nbsp; This was sufficient to allow the case to go to the jury for decision . . . .&quot;); State v. Harold, 325 S.E.2d 219, 222 (N.C. 1985)\r\n(finding that although the state did not prove the victim owned the house in question, it did show she lived there for five months prior to the incident and she\r\nwas occupying it on the night of the incident).\r\nWe have had only one previous opportunity to address the defendant's interest in the burglarized premises under section 16-11-310(3)(a).&nbsp; In State\r\nv. Coffin, 331 S.C. 129, 502 S.E.2d 98 (1998), the defendant moved into his girlfriend's mobile home; in accordance with her lease, he was approved as a\r\nvisitor, and the landlord affixed a copy of his driver's license to the lease with the notation that he was &quot;a legal qualified person living in that mobile\r\nhome.&quot; Id. at 130-31, 502 S.E.2d at 98-99.&nbsp; The defendant did not sign the lease himself, although he did pay rent on occasion. Id. at\r\n131, 502 S.E.2d at 99.&nbsp; According to the Court, the defendant's girlfriend &quot;threw him out&quot; of the house and refused to let him back in following\r\nan argument. Id.&nbsp; He later returned, pried open the front door, murdered his girlfriend, and stabbed her companion. Id.&nbsp; On appeal of\r\nhis conviction of burglary, the defendant alleged that he was a person in lawful possession of the mobile home and therefore did not need his girlfriend's\r\nconsent to enter. Id.&nbsp; We rejected that argument:\r\n\r\n  This evidence supports the inference [defendant] was a guest in [his girlfriend's] home and she was entitled to terminate [defendant's] lawful possession\r\n  by evicting him as she did before the stabbings occurred.&nbsp; Accordingly, this evidence presents a jury issue whether appellant was in lawful possession of\r\n  the mobile home at the time of the stabbings.\r\n\r\nId. at 132, 502 S.E.2d at 99.\r\nIn Coffin, the facts demonstrated that the defendant did not have an absolute right to possess the property.&nbsp; Instead, his rights were dependent\r\nsolely on his girlfriend's good graces.&nbsp; Here, it appears Singley did have an undivided right to possess the home equal to that of his mother by virtue of\r\nhis ownership interest in it. See Watson v. Little, 224 S.C. 359, 365, 79 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1953) (holding tenants in common have equal rights to\r\npossess the whole of the property, regardless of their fractional ownership shares); see also S.C. Juris. Cotenancy Â§ 9 (citing Rabb v. Aiken, 7\r\nS.C. Eq. (2 McCord) 118 (1827)) (stating when two or more beneficiaries inherit the property of an intestate, they take as tenants in common).&nbsp; However, we\r\nbelieve that the mere holding of title to property is not dispositive of whether the owner can be convicted of burglarizing it.\r\nIt is axiomatic that &quot;one cannot commit the offence of burglary by breaking into his own home.&quot; Trapp, 17 S.C. at 470.&nbsp; However, the\r\nconcept of what is one's &quot;own home&quot; must be examined in light of the very purpose behind the law of burglary. &quot;The law of burglary is primarily\r\ndesigned to secure the sanctity of one's home, especially at nighttime, when peace, solitude and safety are most desired and expected. . . . To preserve this\r\nsecurity and this sanctity the law has created safeguards and imposed severe penalties on their infringement.&quot; State v. Brooks, 277 S.C. 111,\r\n112-13, 283 S.E.2d 830, 831 (1981).&nbsp; Therefore, our burglary laws protect an interest separate and apart from ownership: the right to be safe and secure in\r\none's home. See also People v. Smith, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 378, 384 (Ct. App. 2006) (noting the difference between possessory right under the burglary\r\nstatute and family law); State v. McMillan, 973 A.2d 287, 292 (N.H. 2009) (&quot;[W]hile the defendant had some proprietary interest in the apartment as\r\na co-lessee, this fact did not automatically give him license to enter under [the burglary statute]. . . . [T]he entry here interfered with the security and\r\nsafety of the occupant, thus implicating the very interests the burglary statute was designed to protect.&quot;); State v. Lilly, 717 N.E.2d 322, 327\r\n(Ohio 1999) (&quot;Because the purpose of burglary law is to protect the dweller, we hold that custody and control, rather than legal title, is dispositive.&nbsp;\r\nThus, in Ohio, one can commit a trespass and burglary against property of which one is the legal owner if another has control or custody of that\r\nproperty.&quot;).&nbsp; Thus the core of a dwelling constituting one's home for burglary purposes is the expectation of peace and security therein.&nbsp; Mere\r\nownership does not automatically confer this status on a person.&nbsp; That ownership interest must be examined in light of who possesses that expectation of\r\nsanctity in the dwelling.\r\nTherefore, the proper test is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a burglary defendant had custody and control of, and the right and\r\nexpectation to be safe and secure in, the dwelling burglarized. See McMillan, 973 A.2d at 292 (&quot;We . . . conclude that holding a legal\r\ninterest in property . . . is not dispositive on the issue of license or privilege.&nbsp; Consistent with the majority of jurisdictions that have confronted\r\nthis issue, we believe that the fact finder must look beyond legal title and evaluate the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a defendant had\r\nlicense or privilege to enter.&quot;).&nbsp; If so, he is a person in lawful possession and cannot be convicted of burglary.&nbsp; If not, the jury must then\r\ndetermine whether the alleged victim had this interest and whether the defendant invaded it.&nbsp; We wish to emphasize that this is an inherently\r\nfact-intensive inquiry.&nbsp; In the end, while an ownership interest is probative of whether the defendant was a person in lawful possession, it is not\r\ndispositive.[2]&nbsp; It is instructive that our statutes do not define burglary in terms of who owns the property,\r\nbut rather in light of who possesses it.&nbsp; If section 16-11-310(3)(a) defined &quot;without consent&quot; as &quot;to enter a building without consent of\r\nthe lawful owner,&quot; our inquiry would be very different.&nbsp; Instead, the General Assembly specifically couched burglary in terms of possession.\r\nIn this case, we are concerned only with whether Singley had the requisite interest in the home.&nbsp; Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the\r\nfacts of this case warranted the submission of the case to the jury.&nbsp; A reasonable jury could conclude that Singley did not have any expectation of peace\r\nand security in the dwelling at issue nor custody and control of it, despite his ownership interest.&nbsp; He left with little protest when his mother requested\r\nhe leave, took up residence elsewhere, and did not return until six months later when he was required to enter through a back window.&nbsp; Therefore, the jury\r\ncould find that the home was not Singley's &quot;own home&quot; for burglary purposes.&nbsp; Accordingly, the court of appeals correctly held the circuit court\r\ndid not err in denying Singley's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals.&nbsp; Once again, we wish to emphasize that the inquiry into whether a defendant\r\nhas a sufficient possessory interest in the dwelling burglarized is highly factual.&nbsp; A defendant's ownership interest in the dwelling will not preclude a\r\nconviction of burglary as a matter of law.&nbsp; Rather, the jury must determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant used the\r\ndwelling in such a manner that it could be said to be his own home, therefore making him a person in lawful possession.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Trapp is very much a product of its time.&nbsp; There, the issue was whether a woman could have a\r\nsufficient possessory interest in a dwelling. Trapp, 17 S.C. at 468-69.&nbsp; It was actually conceded that the woman was the legal owner of the property\r\nin question, id. at 172, and her name was listed in the indictment as the victim, id. at 469.&nbsp; The argument on appeal was that the husband\r\nwas the &quot;domiciliary proprietor,&quot; and therefore only he could have a sufficient possessory interest to support a conviction of burglary. Id. at\r\n468-69.&nbsp; The Court rejected this argument. Id. at 472.\r\n[2] For example, a defendant may not have a sufficient possessory interest where he is the lessor of certain\r\nproperty he owns or a court has issued an order of protection preventing the defendant from entering a dwelling in which he has an ownership interest.&nbsp; In\r\nboth of those situations, there is some legal impediment that prevents the defendant from exercising his right to possess the property in question.&nbsp; In the\r\nsituation before us, the defendant retained his legal right to enter the property, but he may have acceded his right to possess it as a homeâ€”with the\r\nattendant safety, security, peace, and privacyâ€”to another individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26955","title":"Berberich v.

Jack after he slipped and fell from a wet ladder while working at\r\nher home.&nbsp; Berberich alleged Jack engaged in reckless, willful, and wanton conduct that proximately caused his injuries because she refused to turn off a\r\nlawn sprinkler system while he was working.&nbsp; Berberich appeals from a jury verdict in favor of Jack, arguing, in a case of first impression, that the trial\r\ncourt abused its discretion in denying his request to charge the jury on the definitions of recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness and to instruct the jury\r\nthat heightened forms of wrongdoing could not be compared to ordinary negligence under comparative negligence.&nbsp; Berberich alternatively asserts the jury\r\nshould have been instructed that heightened degrees of wrongdoing are entitled to greater weight than ordinary negligence.&nbsp; He also asserts error in the\r\ndenial of his new trial motion.&nbsp; We reverse and remand.\r\nI.&nbsp; FACTS\r\nOn July 1, 2002, Berberich entered into a contract with Jack to perform work on her home in Florence, South Carolina.&nbsp; During the course of the project,\r\na controversy arose regarding Jack's use of an automatic sprinkler system, which came on in various zones in the yard to water the lawn.&nbsp; According to\r\nBerberich, he told Jack that he and his crew were having difficulty working with the sprinklers on and asked that they be shut off.&nbsp; Jack refused and told\r\nhim to &quot;make the best of the situation and work around it.&quot;&nbsp; Jack became upset when Berberich turned the sprinklers off on several occasions and\r\nthreatened to lock the controls if they were turned off again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJack maintained she never received a complaint about the system or a request to turn it off, and she never threatened to lock the controls.&nbsp; However,\r\nshe stated when the system was turned off a second time, she instructed one of the crew members that her sprinkler system was not to be shut off again.&nbsp;\r\nOn August 9, 2002, Berberich was working alone on a punch list of items to finish the project when he observed the sprinklers come on in one area of the\r\nyard.&nbsp; Berberich noticed the controls had been locked so he could not turn the system off.&nbsp; Berberich moved to the front of the house, away from the\r\nsprinklers, to work on the windows.&nbsp; He then ascended an eight-foot ladder to reach the top of a tall bay window to clean some caulking.&nbsp; As he was\r\nworking, the sprinklers came on in the zone where his ladder was located.&nbsp;\r\nWhile coming back down the ladder, Berberich slipped on a wet rung and fell to the ground, injuring himself.&nbsp; Berberich told Jack he had fallen and\r\nasked her to call for an ambulance, but she ignored his request.&nbsp; As he walked away from Jack's home, Berberich collapsed in her driveway.&nbsp; Berberich\r\nused his cell phone to call for an ambulance, which arrived shortly after his call.&nbsp; Berberich received medical treatment for his injuries, which included\r\na lumbar strain and contusion, abrasions on his back and his left shoulder, and a swollen right ankle.&nbsp;\r\nJack, in contrast, asserts Berberich came to her door to talk about the payment due.&nbsp; She denies Berberich told her he had fallen and that he had asked\r\nher to call an ambulance.&nbsp; She maintains Berberich did not fall at her house and that she is unaware an ambulance came to her home.\r\nOn April 29, 2004, Berberich brought this negligence action against Jack, alleging his injuries &quot;were directly and proximately caused by the negligence,\r\nwil[l]fulness, wantonness and recklessness of&quot; Jack.&nbsp; Berberich sought recovery for medical expenses, lost wages, and other actual damages.&nbsp; He\r\nalso sought an award of punitive damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt trial, Berberich contended Jack's actions in locking the controls and refusing to turn off the sprinklers constituted reckless, willful, and wanton\r\nconduct.&nbsp; He withdrew his request for punitive damages before the case was submitted to the jury, but he asked the trial court to charge the jury on the\r\ndefinitions of recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness and to instruct the jury that ordinary negligence is not a defense to a heightened degree of\r\nwrongdoing, so that his ordinary negligence could not be compared to Jack's allegedly reckless, willful, and wanton conduct.&nbsp; He also sought a verdict form\r\nwith special interrogatories in accordance with these proposed charges.&nbsp; The trial court denied the requests, stating it believed the definitions Berberich\r\nsought were relevant only if punitive damages were at issue, and the charge requested by Berberich was not the law in South Carolina.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court charged the jury on comparative negligence.&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict for the defense.&nbsp; The jury found Berberich was 75%\r\nnegligent and Jack was 25% negligent in causing the accident, resulting in no recovery for Berberich.&nbsp; Berberich's motions for a judgment notwithstanding\r\nthe verdict (JNOV) and a new trial (based on the allegedly erroneous jury charge and verdict form, as well as juror bias) were denied. &nbsp;Berberich appeals.\r\nII.&nbsp; STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, this Court may correct only errors of law.&nbsp; Watson v. Ford Motor Co., 389 S.C. 434, 699\r\nS.E.2d 169 (2010); Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).&nbsp; The factual findings of the jury will not be disturbed\r\nunless no evidence reasonably supports the jury's findings.&nbsp; Townes Assocs., 266 S.C. at 85, 221 S.E.2d at 775.\r\nIII.&nbsp; LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Comparative Negligence Charge\r\nBerberich first argues the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request to charge the jury on the definitions of recklessness, willfulness, and\r\nwantonness and to further instruct the jury that a plaintiff's ordinary negligence is not a defense to a defendant's conduct that is reckless, willful, and\r\nwanton.&nbsp; Berberich contends reckless, willful, and wanton conduct constitutes a heightened degree of wrongdoing that cannot properly be compared to\r\nordinary negligence.&nbsp; In the alternative, Berberich argues the trial court abused its discretion in failing to instruct the jury that it should give more\r\nweight to conduct that is reckless, willful, and wanton.&nbsp; Berberich asserts this case presents a novel issue regarding tort law since the adoption of\r\ncomparative negligence in this state.\r\n&quot;An appellate court will not reverse the trial court's decision regarding jury instructions unless the trial court committed an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.&quot;&nbsp; Cole v. Raut, 378 S.C. 398, 404, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33&nbsp;(2008). &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling\r\nis based on an error of law or is not supported by the evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nAn erroneous jury instruction will not result in reversal unless it causes prejudice to the appealing party.&nbsp; Id. at 405, 663 S.E.2d at 33; see\r\nalso Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 390, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000) (&quot;When instructing the jury, the trial court is required to charge only\r\nprinciples of law that apply to the issues raised in the pleadings and developed by the evidence in support of those issues.&quot;).&nbsp; &quot;A jury charge\r\nconsisting of irrelevant and inapplicable principles may confuse the jury and constitutes reversible error where the jury's confusion affects the outcome of the\r\ntrial.&quot;&nbsp; Cole, 378 S.C. at 404, 663 S.E.2d at 33.\r\n(1)&nbsp; Contributory Negligence versus Comparative Negligence&nbsp;\r\nPrior to the adoption of comparative negligence in 1991, the doctrine of contributory negligence was the long-prevailing standard for tort recovery in South\r\nCarolina.&nbsp; &quot;Contributory negligence is a want of ordinary care upon the part of a person injured by the actionable negligence of another, combining\r\nand concurring with that negligence, and contributing to the injury as a proximate cause thereof, without which the injury would not have occurred.&quot;&nbsp; Gladden\r\nv. S. Ry. Co., 142 S.C. 492, 522-23, 141 S.E. 90, 99&nbsp;(1928) (citation omitted).\r\nUnder contributory negligence, if a plaintiff was negligent to any extent in contributing to his own injury, the plaintiff was completely barred from\r\nrecovering damages from a negligent defendant.&nbsp; Gladden, 142 S.C. at 523, 141 S.E. at 100; S.C. Ins. Co. v. James C. Greene &amp; Co., 290\r\nS.C. 171, 348 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nTo ameliorate the harsh results that could occur under this general rule, an exception developed that a defendant could not assert the contributory\r\nnegligence of a plaintiff as a total defense in cases where the defendant's conduct was reckless, willful, or wanton; under such circumstances, the plaintiff's\r\nown contributory negligence would not bar the plaintiff's recovery.&nbsp; Dawson v. S.C. Power Co., 220 S.C. 26, 66 S.E.2d 322&nbsp;(1951); Orangeburg\r\nSausage Co. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 331, 450 S.E.2d 66&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994).&nbsp; However, if the plaintiff was also contributorily reckless, the\r\nplaintiff could not recover for the defendant's similarly reckless conduct.&nbsp; Ardis v. Griffin,&nbsp;239 S.C. 529, 123 S.E.2d 876&nbsp;(1962).\r\nIn 1991, South Carolina abolished the doctrine of contributory negligence and adopted comparative negligence as its tort standard in Nelson v. Concrete\r\nSupply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783 (1991).&nbsp; In Nelson, this Court stated that, under comparative negligence &quot;a plaintiff in a\r\nnegligence action may recover damages if his or her negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 245, 399 S.E.2d at\r\n784.&nbsp; &quot;The amount of the plaintiff's recovery shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of his or her negligence.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nThe Court adopted a modified version of comparative negligence known as the &quot;less than or equal to&quot; approach, by which the plaintiff in a\r\nnegligence action could recover damages if his or her negligence is 50% or less or, stated another way, if the plaintiff's negligence does not exceed 50%.&nbsp;\r\nSingleton v. Sherer, 377 S.C. 185, 205, 659 S.E.2d 196, 206&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).&nbsp; &quot;The determination of respective degrees of negligence\r\nattributable to the plaintiff and the defendant presents a question of fact for the jury, at least where conflicting inferences may be drawn.&quot;&nbsp; Hurd\r\nv. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 429, 611 S.E.2d 488, 492&nbsp;(2005).\r\n(2)&nbsp; Negligence versus Recklessness, Willfulness, and Wantonness&nbsp;\r\nThis Court has long noted the &quot;troublesome question of the distinction to be made in the degrees of negligence.&quot;&nbsp; Hicks v. McCandlish,\r\n221 S.C. 410, 414, 70 S.E.2d 629, 631&nbsp;(1952).&nbsp; An examination of these distinctions will be helpful in considering Berberich's arguments.\r\n&quot;[N]egligence is the failure to use due care,&quot; i.e., &quot;that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence and reason would exercise under\r\nthe same circumstances.&quot;&nbsp; Hart v. Doe, 261 S.C. 116, 122, 198 S.E.2d 526, 529&nbsp;(1973).&nbsp; It is often referred to as either ordinary\r\nnegligence or simple negligence.\r\n&quot;Recklessness implies the doing of a negligent act knowingly&quot;; it is a &quot;conscious failure to exercise due care.&quot; &nbsp;Yaun v.\r\nBaldridge, 243 S.C. 414, 419, 134 S.E.2d 248, 251&nbsp;(1964) (citation omitted).&nbsp; If a person of ordinary reason and prudence would have been\r\nconscious of the probability of resulting injury, the law says the person is reckless or willful and wanton, all of which have the same meaningâ€”the conscious\r\nfailure to exercise due care.&nbsp; Id.; see also Rogers v. Florence Printing Co., 233 S.C. 567, 577, 106 S.E.2d 258, 263&nbsp;(1958)\r\n(&quot;The test by which a tort is to be characterized as reckless, wil[l]ful or wanton is whether it has been committed in such a manner or under such\r\ncircumstances that a person of ordinary reason or prudence would then have been conscious of it as an invasion of the plaintiff's rights.&quot;).&nbsp; The\r\nelement distinguishing actionable negligence from willful tort is inadvertence.&nbsp; Rogers, 233 S.C. at 578, 106 S.E.2d at 264.\r\n&quot;It is well settled 'that negligence may be so gross as to amount to recklessness, and when it does, it ceases to be mere negligence and assumes very\r\nmuch the nature of willfulness.'&quot;&nbsp; Jeffers v. Hardeman, 231 S.C. 578, 582-83, 99 S.E.2d 402, 404&nbsp;(1957) (quoting Hicks v. McCandlish,\r\n221 S.C. 410, 415, 70 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1952)).[1]\r\n&quot;[T]he terms 'willful' and 'wanton' when pled in a negligence case are synonymous with 'reckless,' and import a greater degree of culpability than mere\r\nnegligence.&quot;&nbsp; Marcum v. Bowden,&nbsp;372 S.C. 452, 458 n.5, 643 S.E.2d 85, 88 n.5&nbsp;(2007). &quot;Evidence that the defendant's conduct\r\nbreached this higher standard entitles the plaintiff to a charge on punitive damages.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\nPunitive damages are appropriate where there is evidence the tortfeasor's conduct was reckless, willful, or wanton.&nbsp; Cartee v. Lesley, 290 S.C.\r\n333, 350 S.E.2d 388 (1986).&nbsp; &quot;Ordinarily, the test is whether the tort has been committed in such a manner or under circumstances that a person of\r\nordinary reason or prudence would have been conscious of it as an invasion of the plaintiff's rights.&quot; &nbsp;Id. at 337, 350 S.E.2d at 390.\r\n(3) &nbsp;South Carolina Historical Perspective and Other Authorities\r\nAlthough there is no South Carolina case specifically addressing whether reckless, willful, and wanton conduct can be compared to ordinary or simple\r\nnegligence after the adoption of comparative negligence in this state, there is a trio of cases from our appellate courts that are instructive in this regard.\r\nIn Stockman v. Marlowe, 271 S.C. 334, 247 S.E.2d 340 (1978), this Court considered whether reckless, willful, and wanton conduct could be compared to\r\nordinary negligence in a case interpreting former section 15-1-300 of the South Carolina Code.[2]&nbsp; This statute\r\ncreated an exception applying comparative negligence in cases involving motor vehicle accidents, although contributory negligence was then still the general\r\nrule in tort cases.&nbsp; The appellant argued that, since the statute refers only to &quot;negligence,&quot; conduct that was reckless, willful, and wanton\r\ncould not be compared to ordinary negligence.\r\nWe rejected that contention, holding although recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness are technically distinct from ordinary negligence, they are so\r\n&quot;inextricably connected and interwoven to the extent that 'negligence' in its broadest sense is often said to encompass conduct of the former\r\nvariety.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 338, 247 S.E.2d at 342.&nbsp; We observed that recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness &quot;are extensions of the law of\r\nnegligence&quot; and that the term &quot;negligence&quot; necessarily embodies all of these &quot;kindred concepts.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; We found the\r\nlegislative purpose of the &quot;comparative negligence&quot; scheme for automobile cases could not be achieved unless the broad spectrum of conduct was\r\nconsidered so that a jury could evaluate the overall culpability of each party and bar the plaintiff's recovery only if the plaintiff's &quot;fault&quot; is\r\ngreater than that of the defendant.&nbsp; Id.\r\nSection 15-1-300 was later declared unconstitutional in Marley v. Kirby, 271 S.C. 122, 245 S.E.2d 604 (1978) for violating equal protection since it\r\napplied comparative negligence only to individuals involved in automobile accidents.&nbsp; However, the discussion in Stockman regarding the broad\r\nspectrum of conduct that is embodied under &quot;comparative negligence&quot; and its reasoning regarding the function of comparative negligence is instructive\r\nnow that comparative negligence is the general rule in tort cases.\r\nIn a later case arising after South Carolina's adoption of a general comparative negligence scheme, Weaver v. Lentz, 348 S.C. 672, 561 S.E.2d 360 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2002), the Court of Appeals found &quot;no error&quot; where the trial court reduced the plaintiff's award for actual damages in a wrongful death action\r\nbased on the decedent's percentage of negligence, even though the plaintiff had been awarded punitive damages.&nbsp; Id. at 684, 561 S.E.2d at 366.&nbsp;\r\nThe plaintiff argued the award of punitive damages necessarily meant the jury had found the defendant had acted recklessly; therefore, the decedent's ordinary\r\nnegligence should not have been compared to the defendant's recklessness under our system of comparative negligence.&nbsp; Id.\r\nThe Court of Appeals rejected the plaintiff's argument, holding the award for actual damages was properly reduced by 50% for the amount of the decedent's\r\nnegligence.&nbsp; Id. at 684-85, 561 S.E.2d at 367.&nbsp; The court reasoned that the rule that the plaintiff's ordinary negligence could not be compared\r\nto a defendant's reckless conduct served &quot;a valid purpose under the very different contributory negligence scheme; however, the validity of this rationale\r\nis undercut by the offset inherent in the comparative negligence framework.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 684, 561 S.E.2d at 367.&nbsp; These comments must be\r\nviewed as dicta, however, because there was no objection to the jury charge at issue and, therefore, no issue was preserved in this regard.\r\nIn another case, Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000), this Court considered whether punitive damages should be reduced based on a\r\nplaintiff's negligence.&nbsp; The Court held the award of punitive damages should not be proportionally reduced because to do so would nullify the punishment\r\nand deterrence goals underlying punitive damages.&nbsp; Id. at 379-80, 529 S.E.2d at 534.&nbsp; Reduction of the actual damages, however, was deemed\r\nappropriate.&nbsp; Id. at 381, 529 S.E.2d at 534.&nbsp; We observed that &quot;the overwhelming majority of other jurisdictions considering this issue\r\nhave concluded that an award of punitive damages is not reduced under comparative negligence.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 380, 529 S.E.2d at 534.\r\nThus, in Clark, the plaintiff's ordinary negligence was compared to a defendant's reckless conduct in assessing actual damages.&nbsp; However, in Clark\r\nwe noted:&nbsp; &quot;The parties agree that Nelson [Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783 (1991)] requires the reduction of\r\n[the] plaintiff's actual damages.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 378, 529 S.E.2d at 533.&nbsp; Thus, we were not asked to specifically address the issue presented in\r\nthe current appealâ€”whether a plaintiff's ordinary negligence may be compared to a defendant's recklessness under our comparative negligence scheme.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, we now expressly answer this question in the affirmative.\r\nSince the ruling in Nelson, the trial courts of this state have, as a matter of course, permitted juries to compare the conduct of the parties to\r\ndetermine each party's culpability and, where the defendant's conduct was found to be reckless, willful, or wanton, the plaintiff has been additionally deemed\r\nentitled to punitive damages for this heightened level of misconduct.&nbsp; See, e.g., Fairchild v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp., 385 S.C. 344,\r\n683 S.E.2d 818 (Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp;\r\nIn the current appeal, Berberich argues a question arises whether South Carolina's version of comparative negligence is a comparative &quot;negligence&quot;\r\ndoctrine or a comparative &quot;fault&quot; scheme and argues ordinary &quot;negligence&quot; and recklessness differ in kind and should not be compared.\r\n&nbsp;In contrast, Jack asserts Berberich expressly consented to the case going to the jury on actual damages alone.&nbsp; Consequently, there was no need to\r\ninstruct the jury on legal terms relevant only to an award of punitive damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA review of cases from other jurisdictions, as well as South Carolina, indicates the terms &quot;comparative negligence&quot; and &quot;comparative\r\nfault&quot; are frequently used interchangeably, with no discernable difference in application.&nbsp; In one case a court made an interesting distinction in\r\nthese terms based on which party was at &quot;fault,&quot; but this did not fundamentally alter the general concepts as suggested by Berberich.&nbsp; See\r\nVeazey v. Elmwood Plantation Assocs., 650 So. 2d 712, 715&nbsp;(La. 1994) (&quot;These provisions of the comparative fault law all share a common\r\ncharacteristic; '[they all] use the term 'fault' when referring to tortfeasor conduct and 'negligence' when referring to victim conduct.'&quot; (alteration in\r\noriginal) (citation omitted)).\r\nProsser and Keeton have noted that the use of the terms &quot;negligence&quot; and &quot;fault&quot; can cause confusion.&nbsp; See W. Page Keeton, et\r\nal., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts Â§ 65, at 453 (5th ed. 1984) (&quot;It is perhaps unfortunate that contributory negligence is called\r\nnegligence at all.&nbsp; 'Contributory fault' would be a more descriptive term.&nbsp; Negligence as it is commonly understood is conduct which creates an undue\r\nrisk of harm to others.&nbsp; Contributory negligence is conduct which involves an undue risk of harm to the actor himself.&nbsp; Negligence requires a duty, an\r\nobligation of conduct to another person.&nbsp; Contributory negligence involves no duty, unless we are to so ingenious as to say that the plaintiff is under an\r\nobligation to protect the defendant against liability for the consequences of the plaintiff's own negligence.&quot;&nbsp; (footnotes omitted)).&nbsp;\r\nSouth Carolina's system is essentially a comparative fault system, but comparative negligence is the term most often used in this state, and we recognize the\r\nterms as equivalent.&nbsp; Further, although there is a divergence of opinion in courts that have considered the question, we hold the sounder reasoning\r\nsupports the determination that comparative negligence encompasses the comparison of ordinary negligence with heightened forms of misconduct such as\r\nrecklessness, willfulness, and wantonness.&nbsp; See Annotation, Application of Comparative Negligence in Action Based on Gross Negligence,\r\nRecklessness, or the Like, 10 A.L.R.4th 946 (1981 &amp; Supp. 2010); 57A Am. Jur. 2d Negligence Â§ 243 (2004) (stating reckless, willful, or wanton\r\nconduct &quot;constitute merely a higher level of negligence&quot; and, although the concepts are technically distinct, they &quot;can be thought of as\r\nextensions of the law of negligence&quot; (citing Stockman v. Marlowe, 271 S.C. 334, 247 S.E.2d 340 (1978)); see also Rickner v. Haller,\r\n116 N.E.2d 525, 530 (Ind. App. 1954) (stating &quot;'negligence' is generally, if loosely, used to describe numerous kinds of misconduct, including\r\nwil[l]fulness and wantonness&quot; and observing &quot;in common parlance, 'wil[l]ful and wanton misconduct' are considered a kind of 'negligence' and are so\r\ntreated under the title of 'Negligence' in our most reputable texts (citing American Jurisprudence and Corpus Juris Secundum)).\r\nIn a case that is the subject of the American Law Reports annotation cited above, the California Court of Appeal held the doctrine of comparative\r\nnegligence should apply even when one party's conduct is willful and wanton:\r\n\r\n  [W]e conclude that no defensible reason exists for categorizing willful and wanton misconduct as a different kind of negligence not suitable for comparison\r\n  with any other kind of negligence. The adoption of comparative negligence in Li [Li v. Yellow Cab Co., 532 P.2d 1226 (1975)] rendered such a separate\r\n  category unnecessary since contributory negligence on the part of a plaintiff was no longer a total bar to recovery for a tortious injury. &nbsp;We apply an\r\n  old axiom, &quot;when the need for a rule ceases the rule ceases.&quot;\r\n\r\nSorensen v. Allred, 169 Cal. Rptr. 441, 446 (Ct. App. 1980). &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn Martel v. Montana Power Co., 752 P.2d 140 (Mont. 1988), the Supreme Court of Montana overruled a prior decision that held willful and wanton\r\nconduct was distinguishable from &quot;mere negligence&quot; and that comparative negligence was not applicable when the defendant's conduct was willful and\r\nwanton.&nbsp; The court stated this distinction was based on &quot;faulty&quot; reasoning as it was applicable only under the prior rule that contributory\r\nnegligence by the plaintiff constituted a total bar to tort recovery as the distinction served to ameliorate the harshness of the contributory negligence\r\nrule.&nbsp; Id. at 142-43.&nbsp; The court observed, &quot;Fortunately, we now operate under a scheme of comparative negligence where there is no danger\r\nof a plaintiff's slight negligence barring all recovery against a willful and wanton or grossly negligent defendant.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 143.&nbsp;\r\nConsequently, &quot;[t]he rationale for the rule . . . no longer exists&quot; and &quot;all forms of conduct amounting to negligence in any form . . . are to be\r\ncompared with any conduct that falls short of conduct intended to cause injury or damage.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\nWe agree that the former rule that a plaintiff's ordinary negligence is not a defense to reckless conduct was meant to ameliorate the harshness of the\r\n&quot;all or nothing&quot; result under contributory negligence.&nbsp; Since the abandonment of contributory negligence in this state and the adoption of\r\ncomparative negligence, the need for this concept has been eliminated.&nbsp;\r\nWe hold that, under our comparative negligence system, all forms of conduct amounting to negligence in any form, including, but not limited to, ordinary\r\nnegligence, gross negligence, and reckless, willful, or wanton conduct, may be compared to and offset by any conduct that falls short of conduct intended to\r\ncause injury or damage.[3]&nbsp; By this method, each party's relative fault in causing the plaintiff's injury will\r\nbe given due consideration.&nbsp; A trial court should instruct the jury on the definitions of these various terms, in addition to ordinary negligence, when so\r\nrequested by a party, even if punitive damages are not at issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn the case now before us, the trial court declined Berberich's request to define the concepts of ordinary negligence versus recklessness, willfulness, and\r\nwantonness, but did instruct the jury on assumption of the risk[4] and other concepts.&nbsp; We find this\r\nhad the potential to confuse the jury and skew the apportionment of fault in a manner that favored the defendant.&nbsp; For this reason, we reverse and remand\r\nfor a new trial.&nbsp;\r\nWe reject, however, Berberich's contention that the jury should have been instructed that any negligence on his part could not be a defense to reckless\r\nconduct.&nbsp; For the reasons outlined above, a jury may compare all forms of negligence as part of its assessment of fault.&nbsp; We likewise reject\r\nBerberich's alternative argument that the jury should have been instructed that heightened degrees of wrongdoing should be accorded greater weight than ordinary\r\nnegligence.[5]&nbsp; The relative significance of each party's conduct and its overall contribution to the\r\nplaintiff's injury are accounted for in the offsets inherent in our comparative negligence system.&nbsp;\r\nB.&nbsp; New Trial Motion\r\nBerberich contends the trial court erred in denying his new trial motion based on (1) the jury charge and verdict form and (2) his claim of juror bias.&nbsp;\r\nDue to our reversal and remand on other grounds, we need not address Berberich's remaining issues.\r\nIV.&nbsp; CONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude that, under South Carolina's comparative negligence system, all forms of conduct amounting to negligence in any form, including, but not limited\r\nto, ordinary negligence, gross negligence, and reckless, willful, or wanton conduct, may be compared to and offset by any conduct that falls short of conduct\r\nintended to cause injury or damage.&nbsp; A trial court should instruct the jury on the definitions of these various forms of negligence whenever requested by a\r\nparty.&nbsp; Because the jury instructions in this case had the potential to confuse the jury, we reverse and remand for a new trial in accordance with this\r\ndecision.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] &quot;Gross negligence is defined as 'the failure to exercise slight care.'&quot;&nbsp; Doe v.

South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., 336\r\nS.C. 373, 395, 520 S.E.2d 142, 153 (1999)).&nbsp; &quot;It has also been defined as 'the intentional, conscious failure to do something which it is incumbent\r\nupon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.'&quot;&nbsp; Id. &quot;Gross negligence 'is a relative term, and means the\r\nabsence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.'&quot; Id.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Section 15-1-300 then provided:&nbsp; &quot;In any motor vehicle accident, contributory negligence shall\r\nnot bar recovery in any action by any person or legal representative to recover damages for negligence resulting in death or in injury to person or property, if\r\nsuch contributory negligence was equal to or less than the negligence which must be established in order to recover from the party against whom recovery is\r\nsought.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-1-300 (1976).&nbsp;\r\n[3]&nbsp; Conduct that is not comparable includes intentional torts, such as assault, battery, and false\r\nimprisonment, as well as any other conduct intended to cause injury or damage.&nbsp; See, e.g., Longshore v.

Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Prop. Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998), in which we held assumption of the risk had been largely subsumed by\r\nthe adoption of comparative negligence. &nbsp;&quot;Although assumption of the risk is no longer recognized as a complete defense in a negligence action, it\r\nremains a facet of comparative negligence which may be charged to the jury.&quot;&nbsp; Howard v.

Burney, of Turner &amp; Burney, of Laurens, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; We granted certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision in this constructive trust case brought by respondent against\r\nhis three children (petitioners) seeking title to his home and the return of certain funds.&nbsp; Foster v. Foster, 384 S.C. 380, 682 S.E.2d 312 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2009).&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2004, respondent purported to deed his home to petitioner Burbage.&nbsp; In the deed, he conveyed the house to &quot;JEAN F. BURBAGE, AS TRUSTEE&quot;\r\nwhile reserving for himself a life estate.&nbsp; On the same day the deed was signed, respondent's attorney executed an affidavit to the effect that the\r\nproperty transfer was exempt from the recording fee because the deed &quot;Transferr[ed] realty to member(s) of the family and retain[ed] a life estate\r\ninterest.&quot;\r\nBurbage also wrote checks on respondent's joint checking account, from which she paid his expenses and into which funds were occasionally deposited.&nbsp;\r\nBurbage opened a money market account in her own name, and deposited in it $73,800 of funds from the joint account.&nbsp; Among the funds deposited first in the\r\njoint account and then into the money market account were the proceeds from a $45,000 certificate of deposit (CD).\r\nThe circuit court judge granted respondent's motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; He voided the deed, finding there was no trust and thus the purported\r\nconveyance to Burbage as trustee of a nonexistent trust was a nullity, and concluded the property belonged to respondent.&nbsp; The circuit court judge also\r\nordered petitioners to return $73,800, the amount petitioner Burbage had removed from the joint account and divided among herself and her brothers, the other\r\npetitioners, finding respondent had established a constructive trust as to this amount.\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.&nbsp; It found there was a genuine issue of material fact whether $45,000 of the\r\n$73,800, that is, the amount derived from the CD's proceeds, constituted a gift.&nbsp; Therefore, the court affirmed summary judgment only as to $28,800 of the\r\n$73,800.&nbsp; The court also affirmed the voiding of the purported trust deed, and held that petitioners' claim that they were entitled to an offset of at\r\nleast $6,800 against the $28,800 for funds spent to pay respondent's assisted care expenses was not preserved for appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp; Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the circuit court judge's decision to set aside the deed?\r\n  2)&nbsp; Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that petitioners must return $28,800?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Deed\r\nAt the time this deed was executed, the South Carolina Probate Code required that a trust which includes real property be proved by a writing.&nbsp; See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-401 (1986).&nbsp; A trust in land may be proved by more than one writing, so long as each writing is signed by the settlor and the\r\nwritings indicate they relate to the same transaction. Ramage v. Ramage, 283 S.C. 239, 322 S.E.2d 22 (Ct. App. 1984).&nbsp; Moreover, one who\r\nappears to hold title to property in her own name can be shown to have acknowledged that she in fact holds title as trustee under the terms of the grantor's\r\nwill.&nbsp; Rutledge v. Smith, 6 S.C. Eq. (1 McCord Eq.) 119 (1825).&nbsp;\r\nPetitioners' reliance on Rutledge is misplaced, as this is not a situation where a party is seeking to impose a trust, but rather one where the\r\npurported settlor denies the existence of a trust in land.&nbsp; Moreover, there is no written evidence of the purported trust's terms or its beneficiaries in\r\ndocument(s) signed by respondent.\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the circuit court correctly found no evidence of a proper trust in land as there are no documents signed by\r\nrespondent referring to a trust other than the deed.\r\nB.&nbsp; Return of Money\r\nIn their brief before this Court, petitioners maintain that the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in requiring them to return the entire $28,800 to\r\nrespondent because this result does not give them credit for bills paid on respondent's behalf out of these funds.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe trial court found that petitioner Burbage removed $73,800 from a joint account at Carolina First in five separate transactions between October 24, 2006,\r\nand January 4, 2007, depositing all monies into her own account.&nbsp; Viewed in the light most favorable to petitioners, there is a passage in Ms. Burbage's\r\ndeposition where she stated that the two transfers in December 2006 totaling $4,800 into her money market account &quot;would have been paid to&quot; the\r\nnursing facility where respondent lived until December 2006.&nbsp; However, the only evidence of the nursing home bill was respondent's testimony that it was\r\naround $2,000 per month.&nbsp; A review of the partial bank records in the Appendix suggests that the December 2006 nursing home charge was paid from the joint\r\nchecking account on November 14, 2006.&nbsp; There is no evidence that any January 2007 nursing home bill was paid at all, much less that it was paid from\r\nBurbage's money market account, especially as respondent had left the facility before January 1, 2007.\r\nThe trial court's order is silent on the issue whether petitioners were entitled to an offset against the funds admittedly moved out of respondent's account\r\nfor monies spent for respondent's care.&nbsp; In their appellate brief, however, petitioners argued that &quot;[t]he [circuit] court erred in ordering the\r\nreturn of any funds which had been expended in support of [respondent].&quot;&nbsp; Then, as now, petitioners are unable to specify evidence of any such\r\npayments in the appellate record.\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that petitioners' claim for a credit against the money Burbage took from the Carolina First account was not preserved for direct\r\nappeal since the petitioners never argued to the circuit court that any of these funds were used for respondent's care.&nbsp; On certiorari, petitioners contend\r\nthe Court of Appeals erred in finding this claim not preserved.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nIn order to preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must both raise that issue to the trial court and obtain a ruling.&nbsp; E.g., Linda Mc\r\nCo., Inc. v. Shore, 390 S.C. 543, 703 S.E.2d 499 (2010).&nbsp; Here, petitioners did neither, and the Court of Appeals properly declined to address this\r\nclaim.&nbsp; Moreover, a careful review of the record discloses no evidence that any of the monies transferred to petitioner Burbage's account and then to her\r\nsiblings was actually expended on their father's care.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Court of Appeals properly affirmed the circuit court's ruling on the deed issue, and properly declined to address the credit/offset claim raised for the\r\nfirst time on appeal.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26957","title":"State v.

Corley,\r\n383 S.C. 232, 679 S.E.2d 187 (Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp; We affirm as modified.\r\nI.\r\nAt approximately 2:50 in the morning, Greenwood City police officer Nicholas Futch saw Petitioner Glenn Ireland Corley drive up to a known drug house,[1] get out of his vehicle, walk to the back of the house, stay for less than two minutes, return to his vehicle and\r\nleave.&nbsp; Officer Futch briefly followed Corley's vehicle, then stopped Corley when Corley failed to use a turn signal.&nbsp; While Futch requested Corley's\r\nlicense, insurance, and registration documents, he noticed Corley was nervous, &quot;fidgety,&quot; short of breath and avoiding eye contact.&nbsp; As a result,\r\nFutch asked Corley to step out of his vehicle.\r\nOfficer Futch asked Corley about his presence in the neighborhood so early in the morning.&nbsp; Corley informed Futch that he had just left a particular\r\nhome, but not the residence he had actually visited.&nbsp; Futch confronted Corley with the false information, which soon resulted in Corley's admission that he\r\npurchased crack cocaine from the drug house he visited immediately prior to the stop.&nbsp; The traffic stop lasted approximately five to seven minutes. Corley\r\nwas arrested and charged with possession of crack cocaine.\r\nFollowing Corley's unsuccessful motion to suppress his statements during the traffic stop and the drugs that were recovered, he was convicted.&nbsp; The\r\ncourt of appeals affirmed.\r\nII.\r\nWe affirm the court of appeals' excellent opinion, with one modification.&nbsp; The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's determination that Officer\r\nFutch had probable cause to stop Corley and investigate for possible drug activity.&nbsp; This was error.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the vehicle stop was justified\r\nbased on the presence of reasonable suspicion.[2]&nbsp; See State v. Foster, 269 S.C. 373, 378, 237\r\nS.E.2d 589, 591 (1977) (&quot;It is recognized that the police may briefly detain and question a person upon a reasonable suspicion, short of probable cause for\r\narrest, that he is involved in criminal activity.&quot;); State v.

Price, 380 S.C. 419, 670 S.E.2d 374 (Ct. App. 2008), which held the claimant was an employee rather than an independent\r\ncontractor.&nbsp; After applying the common law standard reinstated in Wilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transportation Co., 382 S.C. 295, 676 S.E.2d 700\r\n(2009) to consider the jurisdictional question of employment status, we affirm.&nbsp;\r\nI.\r\nRAP Financial Services is a business owned by Richard A. Price that specializes in the recovery of collateral, primarily automobiles, for banks and other\r\nlienholders.&nbsp; The claimant, Ernest Lee Paschal, was hired by RAP in January 1999 as a &quot;repo driver&quot; to repossess vehicles for RAP's\r\nclients.&nbsp; Paschal also worked for RAP briefly in 1998.\r\nOn October 25, 2000, Paschal was severely injured while repossessing a vehicle for RAP.&nbsp; A tire blew out on the repossessed vehicle he was towing,\r\ncausing him to lose control of the vehicle he was driving.&nbsp; Paschal was rendered a paraplegic as a result of the accident.&nbsp;\r\nPaschal filed a workers' compensation claim on June 5, 2002, asserting he was an employee of RAP and that he was entitled to lifetime benefits for a total\r\nand permanent disability.&nbsp; RAP admitted Paschal was injured, but asserted he was an independent contractor, not an employee.&nbsp;\r\nOn February 17, 2005, a commissioner of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission concluded Paschal was an employee of RAP, that he sustained a\r\ncompensable injury rendering him a paraplegic, and that he was entitled to lifetime benefits for a total and permanent disability.&nbsp; The commissioner\r\nspecifically found &quot;Richard Price's testimony was inconsistent, evasive, often unresponsive, [and] untruthful,&quot; and that &quot;Paschal was credible\r\nand believable even though he had a lack of memory in his initial testimony.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nThe Appellate Panel of the Commission unanimously adopted the order of the commissioner, and both the circuit court and the court of appeals &nbsp;affirmed.\r\nII.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act (&quot;APA&quot;) provides the standard for judicial review of workers' compensation decisions.&nbsp; Lark v. Bi-Lo,\r\nInc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).&nbsp; Under the APA, this Court can reverse or modify the decision of the Commission if the substantial rights of\r\nthe appellant have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and\r\nsubstantial evidence on the whole record.&nbsp; Transp. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 389 S.C. 422, 427, 699 S.E.2d 687, 689-90 (2010)\r\n(citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;1-23-380(5)(d), (e) (Supp. 2009)).\r\nBecause the question presented is one of jurisdiction, this Court may take its own view of the facts upon which jurisdiction is dependent.&nbsp; Wilkinson,\r\n382 S.C. at 299, 676 S.E.2d 702; Wilson v. Georgetown County, 316 S.C. 92, 447 S.E.2d 841 (1994).&nbsp; The question whether a claimant is an employee or\r\nan independent contractor is a jurisdictional matter subject to our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; Wilkinson, 382 S.C. at 299, 676\r\nS.E.2d 702.\r\nIII.\r\nRAP contends the determination of the court of appeals that Paschal was an employee of RAP should be reversed because that court relied upon the now\r\nerroneous legal standard set forth in Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 534 S.E.2d 700 (2000).&nbsp;\r\nUnder South Carolina law, the primary consideration in determining whether an employer/employee relationship exists is whether the alleged employer has the\r\nright to control the employee in the performance of the work and the manner in which it is done.&nbsp; Kilgore Group, Inc. v. South Carolina Employment Sec.\r\nComm'n,&nbsp;313 S.C. 65, 68, 437 S.E.2d 48, 49&nbsp;(1993) (citing Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991)).&nbsp; &quot;The\r\ntest is not the actual control exercised, but whether there exists the right and authority to control and direct the particular work or undertaking.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nId.\r\nThe four principal factors indicating the right of control are (1) direct evidence of the right to, or exercise of, control; (2) the method of payment; (3)\r\nthe furnishing of equipment; and (4) the right to fire.&nbsp; South Carolina Workers' Comp. Comm'n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546, 459\r\nS.E.2d 302 (1995); Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. 196, 174 S.E.2d 397 (1970).\r\nIn Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 534 S.E.2d 700 (2000), this Court, citing the treatise of Professor Larson, departed from our traditional common\r\nlaw approach and opted for the following approach:\r\n\r\n  [F]or the most part, any single factor is not merely indicative of, but, in practice, virtually proof of, the employment relation; while, in the opposite\r\n  direction, contrary evidence is as to any one factor at best only mildly persuasive evidence of contractorship, and sometimes is of almost no such force at\r\n  all.\r\n\r\nId. at 439, 534 S.E.2d at 703 (alteration in original) (quoting 3 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larson's Workers' Compensation Law,\r\nÂ§&nbsp;61.04 (2000)).\r\nWe granted certiorari in this case because in Wilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transportation Co. we recently overruled the Dawkins approach.&nbsp;\r\nIn Wilkinson, we &quot;return[ed] to our jurisprudence that evaluates the four factors with equal force in both directions.&quot;&nbsp; 382 S.C. at 300,\r\n676 S.E.2d at 702.\r\nAlthough we may take our own view of the preponderance of the evidence on matters affecting jurisdiction, to the extent these four factors turn on\r\ncredibility, this broader scope of review does not require this Court to ignore the findings of the Commission, which was in a superior position to evaluate\r\nwitness credibility.&nbsp; See Shealy v. Aiken County,&nbsp;341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000) (stating the final determination of witness\r\ncredibility is reserved to the Commission); cf. Wallace v. Milliken &amp; Co., 300 S.C. 553, 389 S.E.2d 448 (Ct. App. 1990) (observing in matters\r\nwhere this Court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, an appellate court need not disregard the findings of the hearing tribunal, which\r\noccupies a much better position to evaluate the credibility of witnesses).&nbsp; It is clear from the commissioner's observations that he found Paschal to be\r\nmore credible than Price, and this finding was adopted by the Appellate Panel.\r\nIn evaluating this case, we rely not only on the thorough and well-reasoned opinion of the court of appeals, but also upon our own review of the record using\r\nthe common law approach reinstated by Wilkinson.&nbsp; After this review, we are firmly convinced that the factors manifestly preponderate in favor of\r\nfinding an employment relationship, especially as to the factors of direct evidence of the right of control, the furnishing of equipment, and the right to\r\nfire.&nbsp; Our view of the evidence is entirely consistent with that of the court of appeals.\r\nAdmittedly, a close question is presented as to the remaining factor, the method of payment.&nbsp; In this regard, there are some facts that indicate the\r\npresence of an independent contractor relationship, while other facts indicate Paschal was an employee, as properly analyzed by the court of appeals.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, after viewing all four factors in a balanced and equally-weighted approach as required by Wilkinson, we are persuaded that the factors\r\npreponderate in a finding that Paschal was an employee of RAP and that he is, therefore, entitled to workers' compensation benefits.\r\nIV.\r\nWe affirm and commend the court of appeals, which held Paschal was an employee of RAP and that he is entitled to lifetime workers' compensation benefits for\r\na total and permanent disability.[1]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice G. Thomas Cooper, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Although we granted certiorari to consider the ruling of the court of appeals that Paschal was entitled\r\nto lifetime workers' compensation benefits pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 based on his paraplegia, we now dismiss certiorari on this question on the\r\nbasis it was improvidently granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26959","title":"Miller v.

App. filed Feb. 13, 2008).&nbsp; We reverse.\r\nI.\r\nPetitioner Janet Miller brought this negligence action against Respondents FerrellGas and its driver, Kenneth Ellis, arising from a motor vehicle\r\naccident.&nbsp; Ellis properly stopped at a stop sign and then attempted a left turn onto the favored highway.&nbsp; Ellis entered the intersection although his\r\nview was obstructed by a temporary construction sign, and he could not see if there was oncoming traffic.&nbsp; FerrellGas's vehicle, driven by Ellis, collided\r\nwith a vehicle in the intersection on the favored highway.&nbsp; Miller, a passenger in the vehicle on the favored highway, was seriously injured in the\r\ncollision.&nbsp; It is conceded that the vehicle in which Miller was traveling was within the speed limit and free from any negligence.\r\nAt the close of Respondents' case, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of Miller, finding Ellis[1] was\r\nnegligent as a matter of law when he blindly pulled into the intersection.&nbsp; Following a plaintiff's verdict, Respondents appealed, contending that the\r\ndirected verdict was in error because a question of fact was presented on the issue of negligence.&nbsp; The court of appeals agreed with Respondents and\r\nreversed the grant of the directed verdict.&nbsp; We reverse the court of appeals and reinstate the jury verdict in favor of Miller.\r\nII.\r\nIn an appeal from the grant of a directed verdict, we must, like the trial court and court of appeals, view the evidence in a light most favorable to the\r\nnon-movant, Ellis.&nbsp; Baggerly v. CSX Transp. Inc., 370 S.C. 362, 368, 635 S.E.2d 97, 100 (2006) (&quot;[T]he evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\ntherefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the verdict was directed.&quot; (emphasis omitted)).&nbsp; When viewed in that\r\nlight, if there is any evidence that may be reasonably construed as creating a question of fact, the motion must be denied and the matter submitted to the\r\njury.&nbsp; Id., 635 S.E.2d at 100 - 01 (&quot;If the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to\r\nthe jury.&quot;).\r\nIII.\r\nWe view the statutory and common law as clear in this area.&nbsp; South Carolina law speaks to a driver's duty when approaching a stop sign:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if\r\n  none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has\r\n  a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in\r\n  the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such driver is moving across or within\r\n  the intersection or junction of roadways.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2330(b) (2006); see also Â§ 56-5-2320 (&quot;The driver of a vehicle intending to turn to the left within an intersection or\r\ninto an alley, private road or driveway shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or\r\nso close thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.&quot;); Warren v. Watkins Motor Lines, 242 S.C. 331, 340, 130 S.E.2d 896, 901 (1963) (&quot;When a\r\nmotorist on an unfavored highway approaches a through highway he must bring his car to a stop for such a time and in such a position as to be able to observe\r\nthe traffic conditions on the favored highway and govern his conduct accordingly.&quot;).\r\nIt is Respondents' position that evidence of due care on Ellis's part exists &quot;because what otherwise would have been in his plain view was, unbeknownst\r\nto him, obscured&quot; by the temporary road sign. (Br. of Respondents 7.)&nbsp; Ellis further presents a series of rhetorical questionsâ€”in essence, what is a\r\nreasonable driver to do under these circumstances?&nbsp; Miller's response answers the question and accurately states the law: &quot;If a motorist cannot see\r\nwhat may be approaching from the left while [he is] stopped at a stop sign, the one thing a reasonable person does not do is take a chance and pull out to an\r\narea of potential danger . . . in which [he] cannot see.&quot;&nbsp; (Reply Br. of Petitioner 12).\r\nThere may be motor vehicle accident cases in which a question of fact is presented when a driver pulls from the unfavored highway to the favored\r\nhighway.&nbsp; But this is not one of those cases.&nbsp; Where, as here, a driver enters the favored highway, knowing his view is obstructed and he cannot see\r\nif there is oncoming traffic, we find such a driver negligent as a matter of law. See Crosby v. Sawyer, 291 S.C. 474, 354 S.E.2d 387 (1987)\r\n(finding directed verdict appropriate on the issue of negligence when driver properly stopped before pulling into intersection but nonetheless collided with\r\nanother vehicle); Lufkin v. Kyle, 275 S.C. 90, 267 S.E.2d 533 (1980) (finding a directed verdict appropriate where motorist blinded by the sun caused an\r\naccident); Odom v. Steigerwald, 260 S.C. 422, 196 S.E.2d 635 (1973) (finding a directed verdict appropriate when driver approaching favored highway\r\nproperly stopped, looked both ways, and entered the intersection but collided with a vehicle approaching the intersection on the favored highway); Edwards v.\r\nBloom, 246 S.C. 346, 143 S.E.2d 614 (1965) (finding a directed verdict appropriate when motorist blinded by the sun caused an accident); Horton v\r\nGreyhound Corp., 241 S.C. 430, 128 S.E.2d 776 (1962) (finding the driver on the unfavored highway negligent for turning into path of oncoming vehicle); Epps\r\nv. S.C. State Hwy. Dep't, 209 S.C. 125, 39 S.E.2d 198 (1946) (finding negligence where driver's view obscured by fog). &nbsp;\r\nIV.\r\nEllis raised additional issues to the court of appeals, which were not reached.&nbsp; We elect to review those additional issues.&nbsp; We find these\r\nremaining issues manifestly without merit and affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:&nbsp; Gamble v. Int'l Paper Realty Corp\r\nof S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438 (1996) (finding the admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed\r\nabsent a clear abuse of discretion); Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 466 S.E.2d 727 (1996) (finding the denial of a new\r\ntrial motion is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion).&nbsp;\r\nV.\r\nWe reverse the court of appeals and reinstate the jury verdict.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice G. Thomas Cooper, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The case was tried and verdict rendered against driver Ellis and his vicariously liable employer,\r\nFerrellGas.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26924","title":"In the Matter of J.

Cameron Halford,&nbsp;Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.&nbsp; 26924\r\nSubmitted January 7, 2011 - Re-Filed April 11, 2011&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        J. Cameron Halford, of Fort Mill, pro se.&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule\r\n21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a letter of caution, admonition, or a public reprimand.&nbsp;\r\nWe accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.&nbsp; The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn a two day period in May 2008, twenty-two checks were presented on respondent's real estate trust account on insufficient funds.&nbsp; Upon notice from his\r\nbank, respondent immediately reviewed his most recent transactions and discovered that the mistake was due to user error in submitting an electronic bank\r\ndeposit.&nbsp; At the time, respondent used a scanner provided by the bank that was linked through an internet connection to the bank's computer.&nbsp; The\r\ndevice allowed the depositor to scan a deposit item in his office without having to physically go to the bank.&nbsp; Respondent failed to properly transmit the\r\nscanned image of a deposit before disbursing the funds at closing.&nbsp; Respondent acknowledges his failure to insure funds were available prior to\r\ndisbursement violated Rule 1.15, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nIn October 2008, four checks were presented on insufficient funds in respondent's litigation trust account.&nbsp; The bank honored two of the checks and\r\nreturned two of the checks.&nbsp; The overdrafts were the result of two errors by respondent which related to the acceptance of fee payments by credit\r\ncard.&nbsp; The first error occurred when respondent accidently refunded a payment to a client's credit card account rather than charging the payment to the\r\naccount.&nbsp; The second error was respondent's failure to account for individual clients' credit card transactions fees assessed by the credit card\r\ncompanies.&nbsp; Respondent did not realize that credit card transaction fees varied depending on the amount of the transactions and the account type.&nbsp;\r\nInstead, respondent assumed that the credit card transaction fees were the same for each transaction.&nbsp; As a result, respondent overpaid several client\r\naccounts in the amount of $814.12.&nbsp; Respondent acknowledges his repeated mathematical errors in calculating credit card transaction fees and his failure to\r\nclosely examine his monthly financial records violated Rule 1.15, RPC.\r\nIn December 2008, eleven checks written on respondent's real estate trust account were presented on insufficient funds.&nbsp; These overdrafts occurred as\r\nthe result of a real estate closing in which respondent electronically deposited the lender's check, but did not wait for the check to clear the bank before\r\nissuing checks on the account.&nbsp;&nbsp; After disbursing the funds, respondent learned that the lender had stopped payment on the loan check due to a\r\nrecording defect.&nbsp; Respondent acknowledges that the lender's check did not constitute &quot;good funds&quot; and that Rule 1.15, RPC, required he wait to\r\ndisburse the funds until after the lender's check had been collected by his bank.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAlthough respondent ensured his trust accounts were reconciled with his monthly bank statements, he did not reconcile his client ledger balances.&nbsp;\r\nReview of his records for 2008 and 2009 reveal numerous negative client ledger balances.&nbsp; These negative ledge balances resulted from errors, not from any\r\nmisappropriation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some negative ledger balances were the result of a failure to account for the correct credit card transaction fees as discussed\r\nabove.&nbsp; In those instances, respondent withdrew his legal fees without accounting for the actual credit card transaction fee amounts, resulting in\r\nshortages to those particular client ledgers.&nbsp; Respondent has restored those funds to his trust account and corrected the ledgers.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nOther negative ledger balances occurred when respondent collected &quot;flat fees&quot; or payments toward &quot;flat fees&quot; and deposited them directly\r\nto his operating account. &nbsp;When respondent learned he was required to deposit all fees, including flat fees, into his trust account until the fees were\r\nactually earned, he converted his system to create client ledgers for his flat fee clients.&nbsp; Respondent's bookkeeper, however, did not transfer the\r\nprevious fee payments to the new ledgers, resulting in negative client ledger balances.&nbsp; Respondent has now made the ledger corrections.[1]&nbsp;\r\nRespondent admits his conduct in failing to accurately document transactions with and on behalf of clients and his failure to conduct complete monthly\r\nreconciliations violated the requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.&nbsp; Respondent has now completed the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Trust Account\r\nSchool.&nbsp; Further, he has retained an outside accounting service to conduct his monthly reconciliations and has ensured that the service is familiar with\r\nRule 417, SCACR.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:&nbsp; Rule 1.15(c)\r\n(lawyer shall deposit into a client trust account unearned legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees\r\nare earned or expenses incurred) and Rule 1.15(f)(1)(A) (lawyer shall not disburse funds from an account containing the funds of more than one client or third\r\nperson unless the funds to be disbursed have been deposited in the account and are collected funds).&nbsp; Respondent further admits that he did not comply with\r\nthe financial recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.&nbsp; Respondent acknowledges his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE,\r\nspecifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of\r\nlawyers).&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.&nbsp; Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly\r\nreprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent stipulates that the deposit of &quot;flat fees&quot; into his operating account was a violation of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp; We accept the stipulation here for purposes of honoring the Agreement for Discipline by Consent.&nbsp; The handling of\r\n&quot;flat fees&quot; is a complex matter, and we do not intend in this opinion to set forth a categorical rule addressing &quot;flat\r\nfees.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Allendale County School District, 381 S.C. 262, 672\r\nS.E.2d 809 (Ct. App. 2009), in which the Court of Appeals held Sandra Bartley was entitled to benefits for an injury to her neck that resulted in a thirty\r\npercent permanent disability to her back, but denied all other benefits.&nbsp; On appeal, Bartley contends her physical injury combined with her pre-existing\r\nimpairments[1] resulted in a substantially greater disability that is compensable pursuant to Ellison v.\r\nFrigidaire Home Products, 371 S.C. 159, 638 S.E.2d 664 (2006).&nbsp; We reverse and remand.\r\nI.&nbsp; FACTS\r\nOn September 26, 2002, Bartley was working as a special needs teacher with the Allendale County School District when a child accidently collided with her\r\nduring recess and knocked her down while trying to give her a hug.&nbsp; Bartley fell onto a chain link fence and landed on the ground on top of some tree\r\nroots, and the child fell on top of her.&nbsp;\r\nBartley sought medical treatment and was thereafter referred to an orthopedic medical practice.&nbsp; Bartley told the orthopedic physician that she could\r\nnot lift her arm and that she had pain in her right shoulder and her arm muscles, as those were the problems that most concerned her.&nbsp; The orthopedic\r\nphysician noted in early April 2003 that Bartley's original physician had unfortunately misdiagnosed Bartley as having tendonitis bursitis of the shoulder and\r\nhad referred her for physical therapy, which worsened the condition.[2]&nbsp; However, the orthopedic physician\r\nstated an MRI\r\nconfirmed Bartley had &quot;severe foraminal stenosis at C5-6&quot;[3] and that this was a &quot;cervical\r\nradiculopathy type process rather than shoulder pathology&quot; that was &quot;clearly . . . related to her original injury at work.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nOn May 14, 2003, Bartley underwent surgery for a cervical fusion.&nbsp; After that, Bartley seemed to be doing better and believed that she could return to\r\nteaching.&nbsp; Bartley filed a Form 50 on July 18, 2003 noting injuries to her neck, right arm, right hand, and left knee, as well as the occurrence of\r\nmigraine headaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn August 2003 Bartley began a new job teaching for Richland County School District One in Columbia.&nbsp; From August to October of 2003, Bartley began\r\nhaving more pain.&nbsp; Bartley attributed this to her teaching duties, which required her to work long hours and to lift a lot of equipment and other\r\nitems.&nbsp; In October 2003, a student picked up a desk and threatened to throw it at Bartley.&nbsp; She was not physically harmed, but according to Bartley,\r\nthe threat brought back memories of being injured in 2002 and made her fearful that she could be injured again.&nbsp;\r\nBartley's physician prescribed a medical leave of absence after October 2003, stating her &quot;neuropathic parascapular pain&quot; was &quot;definitely\r\nrelated to the incident on September 26, 2002&quot; and was &quot;most likely going to result in temporary or total disability to perform her work as she did\r\nprior to these injuries.&quot;&nbsp; Bartley returned to work briefly in January 2004 before her physician again prescribed a medical leave of absence.[4]&nbsp;\r\nOn December 10, 2004, Bartley filed a second Form 50 seeking a hearing.&nbsp; Bartley noted injuries to her cervical spine that resulted in pain, tingling\r\nand numbness down the right side of her body (including the neck/shoulder/arm/hand/buttocks/leg); dizziness; headaches; ringing in her ears; and\r\nemotional/mental problems (post-traumatic stress disorder).&nbsp;\r\nA hearing was held in August 2005 before a commissioner of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission.&nbsp; Bartley submitted a &quot;Psychological\r\nDischarge Summary&quot; dated January 4, 2005 from Dr. Clay Drummond, a clinical psychologist, who diagnosed her as having a pain disorder associated with both\r\npsychological factors and a general medical condition, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic intractable pain, and cognitive degradation.&nbsp; Dr. Drummond\r\nstated: &quot;It is most psychologically probable that her disorders were either caused by or exacerbated by her at work accident.&quot; &nbsp;Dr. Drummond\r\nfound the &quot;combination of [Bartley's] physical and emotional difficulties precludes her from doing any type of meaningful work&quot; and that &quot;[s]he\r\nwill continue to need maintenance psychiatric medications and likely need periodic maintenance visits with a mental health professional.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nBartley also submitted a February 28, 2005 assessment from Joel D. Leonard, a Vocational Consultant, who reported that Bartley's &quot;work-related injury\r\nfrom September 26, 2002 has had a severe and adverse effect on her ability to perform gainful work activity&quot; and that she &quot;is . . . totally disabled .\r\n. . due to the combined implications of her physio-vocational and psycho-vocational status.&quot;&nbsp; Leonard concluded &quot;Bartley's work-related accident\r\nhas had a catastrophic effect on her ability to access the open labor market and her ability to garner a weekly wage.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nThe commissioner found Bartley had suffered an injury to her neck in the 2002 accident and a resulting thirty percent loss of use of her back, but that\r\nBartley had failed to prove &quot;that she suffered an injury to any body part other than her neck or that her psychological condition has worsened as a result\r\nof this injury.&quot;&nbsp; The commissioner denied Bartley's &quot;claims for benefits for the buttocks, low back, right leg, dizziness, ringing in the ears or\r\npsychological disorder&quot; on the basis they were barred by the statute of limitations and &quot;these conditions were not caused by [Bartley's] injury at\r\nwork.&quot;&nbsp; The commissioner stated that he &quot;d[id] not doubt that the Claimant's future prospects of employment will be limited,&quot; but that he\r\nwas &quot;not allowed to stack her personal ailments with her work injury to make a finding of disability,&quot; citing Ellison v. Frigidaire Home Products,\r\n360 S.C. 236, 600 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 2004) (Ellison I).&nbsp; The commissioner observed, &quot;It appears that Dr. Drummond and Joel Leonard have done\r\nexactly that in making their assessments of employability.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nThe Appellate Panel affirmed the commissioner's order with certain amendments and adopted the commissioner's findings of fact and conclusions of law.&nbsp;\r\nSpecifically, the Appellate Panel affirmed the commissioner's finding that Bartley suffered a thirty percent permanent loss of use of her back as a result of\r\nher neck injury that occurred on September 26, 2002.&nbsp; The Appellate Panel found the claims for benefits for the buttocks, low back, right leg, dizziness,\r\nringing in the ears, and psychological overlay were not barred by the statute of limitations in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40, although it agreed with the\r\ncommissioner's finding that these conditions were not caused by Bartley's work injury.[5]&nbsp; The Appellate Panel\r\nfound Bartley was not disabled from work because of her neck injury &quot;since she began work with Richland School District One in August 2003.&quot; &nbsp;The\r\ncircuit court and the Court of Appeals affirmed.&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp; STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act (&quot;APA&quot;) provides the standard for judicial review of workers' compensation decisions.&nbsp; Pierre v. Seaside\r\nFarms, Inc.,&nbsp;386 S.C. 534, 689 S.E.2d 615 (2010); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).&nbsp; Under the APA, this Court can\r\nreverse or modify the decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission if the substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the decision is\r\naffected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.&nbsp; Transp.

Â§&nbsp;1-23-380(5)(d), (e) (Supp. 2009)).\r\nThe Commission is the ultimate fact finder in workers' compensation cases.&nbsp; Jordan v. Kelly Co., 381 S.C. 483, 674 S.E.2d 166 (2009); Shealy\r\nv. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000).&nbsp; As a general rule, this Court must affirm the findings of fact made by the Commission if they\r\nare supported by substantial evidence.&nbsp; Pierre, 386 S.C. at 541, 689 S.E.2d at 618.&nbsp; &quot;Substantial evidence is that evidence which, in\r\nconsidering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Commission reached.&quot;&nbsp; Hill v. Eagle Motor Lines,\r\n373 S.C. 422, 436, 645 S.E.2d 424, 431&nbsp;(2007).&nbsp; &quot;The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the\r\nCommission's finding from being supported by substantial evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\nIII.&nbsp; LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBartley contends the Court of Appeals erred in failing to reverse and remand her case to the Commission in light of this Court's decision in Ellison v.\r\nFrigidaire Home Products, 371 S.C. 159, 638 S.E.2d 664 (2006) (Ellison II), which reversed the Ellison I case relied upon by the single\r\ncommissioner and the Appellate Panel.&nbsp; Bartley contends she has suffered a greater disability than the specific injury to her neck.&nbsp; The Court of\r\nAppeals found Ellison II to be inapplicable.\r\nEllison fractured his leg while operating a forklift for Frigidaire and sustained a twenty percent impairment to his leg.&nbsp; Ellison v. Frigidaire,\r\n360 S.C. 236, 238, 600 S.E.2d 120, 121 (Ct. App. 2004).&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of his accident, Ellison had been suffering for several years from hypertension\r\nand prostate cancer.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; After his accident, Ellison was also diagnosed with sleep apnea, diabetes, and congestive heart failure.&nbsp; Id.\r\nEllison argued the combination of his accidental leg injury and his other medical ailments rendered him totally and permanently disabled.&nbsp; Id.\r\nFrigidaire, in contrast, argued Ellison was limited to the scheduled member benefits of a twenty percent impairment for his leg because only his leg was injured\r\nin his workplace accident.&nbsp; Id.\r\nThe commissioner and the Appellate Panel concluded the combination of Ellison's workplace injury and his other ailments rendered him totally disabled, and\r\nthe circuit court affirmed.&nbsp; Id. at 238-39, 600 S.E.2d at 121.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals reversed, finding S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400 (relied upon\r\nby Ellison) was inapplicable and that he was limited to benefits for a scheduled member (the leg) because there was no evidence that his workplace injury\r\naffected any body part other than his leg.&nbsp; Id. at 241, 600 S.E.2d at 122.\r\nThis Court reversed in Ellison v. Frigidaire Home Products, 371 S.C. 159, 638 S.E.2d 664 (2006).&nbsp; The Court held that Ellison's workplace injury,\r\ncombined with his pre-existing physical conditions (including hypertension, sleep apnea, prostate cancer, diabetes, and congestive cardiac disease), rendered\r\nhim physically unable to return to work and left him permanently and totally disabled. &nbsp;This Court interpreted section 42-9-400, which provided in relevant\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a) If an employee who has a permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin incurs a subsequent disability from injury by accident arising\r\n  out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in compensation and medical payments liability or either, for disability that is substantially\r\n  greater, by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and subsequent injury or by reason of the aggravation\r\n  of the preexisting impairment, than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer or his insurance carrier shall in the first\r\n  instance pay all awards of compensation and medical benefits provided by this Title; but such employer or his insurance carrier shall be reimbursed from the\r\n  Second Injury Fund. . . .\r\n  . . . .\r\n  (d) As used in this section, &quot;permanent physical impairment&quot; means any permanent condition, whether congenital or\r\n  due to injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if the\r\n  employee should become unemployed.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 161-62, 638 S.E.2d at 665.\r\nThis Court held there is no requirement that the pre-existing condition aggravated the work injury or that the work injury aggravated the pre-existing\r\ncondition; rather, the question to be considered was whether the combined effects of the condition and the workplace injury resulted in a greater disability\r\nthan would otherwise have existed:\r\n\r\n  The language of Â§ 42-9-400(a) and (d) indicates the legislature clearly envisioned that a claimant may recover for greater disability than that incurred\r\n  from a single injury to a particular body part if the combination with any pre-existing condition hinders reemployment. There is no requirement that the\r\n  pre-existing condition aggravated the injury, or that the injury aggravated the pre-existing condition, so long as there is a greater disability simply from\r\n  the &quot;combined effects&quot; of the injury and the pre-existing condition.\r\n\r\nId. at 164, 638 S.E.2d at 666 (emphasis added).[6]\r\nIn the current appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the determination of the Appellate Panel that Bartley was limited to benefits for an injury to her neck\r\nand a resulting thirty percent impairment to her back.&nbsp; Bartley v. Allendale County Sch. Dist., 381 S.C. 262, 672 S.E.2d 809 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nThe Court of Appeals rejected Bartley's argument that she is totally disabled and that her psychological and physical problems affect more than just her back\r\nand hinder her employment, entitling her to additional benefits.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals ruled there was substantial evidence to support the Appellate\r\nPanel's determination that the 2002 accident did not cause or aggravate Bartley's other conditions.&nbsp; Id. at 274-75, 672 S.E.2d at 815.&nbsp; The\r\nCourt of Appeals further observed that this Court's decision in Ellison II was not applicable to Bartley:\r\n\r\n  Although Bartley presented some evidence the Allendale incident [when she was accidently knocked down by a student on September 26, 2002] aggravated\r\n  Bartley's pre-existing conditions, the record also contains substantial evidence the Allendale incident did not cause or aggravate her conditions.&nbsp;\r\n  Substantial evidence may support finding either the Richland incident aggravated her pre-existing conditions or that her pre-existing conditions were not\r\n  aggravated at all because she was experiencing the same problems before the accident.&nbsp; Accordingly, Ellison II does not apply.&nbsp; The\r\n  Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder and when the facts conflict, as they do here, its findings are conclusive.&nbsp; The record contains substantial\r\n  evidence supporting the Appellate Panel's decision.\r\n\r\nId. at 275, 672 S.E.2d at 815 (emphasis added).&nbsp; The &quot;Richland incident&quot; referred to above by the Court of Appeals occurred when a\r\nstudent threatened to throw a desk at Bartley.&nbsp;\r\nIn Bartley it appears the Court of Appeals focused on whether Bartley's 2002 accident caused her other medical conditions or whether it aggravated\r\nher pre-existing conditions.&nbsp; However, in Ellison II this Court held that aggravation was not a requirement but an alternative\r\nanalysis:&nbsp; &quot;There is no requirement that the pre-existing condition aggravated the injury, or that the injury aggravated the pre-existing condition,\r\nso long as there is a greater disability simply from the 'combined effects' of the injury and the pre-existing condition.&quot;&nbsp; Ellison II, 371\r\nS.C. at 164, 638 S.E.2d at 666.\r\nThe Court of Appeals recited the Ellison II standard in Bartley and noted that &quot;the statute provides for the aggravation of a pre-existing\r\ncondition as an alternative to the combined effects provision.&quot;&nbsp; Bartley, 381 S.C. at 273 n.4, 672 S.E.2d at 814 n.4.&nbsp; However, the\r\nCourt of Appeals stated Bartley &quot;has a long history of suffering from depression and migraine headaches&quot; as well as other ailments, and her problems\r\ncould have been caused by circumstances that were unrelated to her 2002 workplace injury.[7]&nbsp; Id. at 275,\r\n672 S.E.2d at 815.&nbsp; Thus, it seems to rely upon the absence of proof of aggravation or causation.\r\nIt is not the province of this Court or the Court of Appeals to engage in fact-finding, as that is solely the function of the Commission.&nbsp; The orders of\r\nboth the commissioner and the Appellate Panel (which incorporated much of the commissioner's order) were affected by an error of law.&nbsp; The commissioner\r\nstated that he &quot;d[id] not doubt that the Claimant's future prospects of employment will be limited,&quot; but that he &quot;is not allowed to stack her\r\npersonal ailments with her work related injury to make a finding of disability,&quot; citing Ellison I.&nbsp; The Appellate Panel incorporated this\r\nfinding into its order.&nbsp; Thus, the Commission has not considered Bartley's claims applying the proper legal standard and has not made specific factual\r\nfindings as to Bartley's other conditions because it made an initial determination that they could not be considered.\r\nThe Court of Appeals did not remand this case to the Commission but instead concluded Ellison II was not applicable.&nbsp; In doing so, it arguably\r\nmade findings of fact (such as the effect of the &quot;Richland incident&quot;) that were not made by the Commission and it also did not properly apply the\r\nlegal standard in Ellison II because it focused on an aggravation analysis instead of a combined effects analysis, although it recited the language in Ellison\r\nII that indicated aggravation was not required.\r\nThe Commission, had it considered the application of the law in Ellison II, would have made additional findings of fact pertinent to this analysis\r\nthat are missing from the record.&nbsp; Thus, a remand to the Commission is necessary to allow it to make the necessary factual findings and legal conclusions\r\nto resolve Bartley's claims.&nbsp; See, e.g., Fox v. Newberry County Mem'l Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, 280, 461 S.E.2d 392, 394&nbsp;(1995) (&quot;The\r\nduty to determine facts is placed solely on the Commission and the court reviewing the decision of the Commission has no authority to determine factual issues\r\nbut must remand the matter to the Commission for further proceedings.&nbsp; The reviewing court may not make findings of fact as to basic issues of liability\r\nfor compensation, where, to do so, would impose upon the court the function of determining such facts from conflicting evidence.&quot; (internal citation\r\nomitted)); cf. Smith v. NCCI, Inc., 369 S.C. 236, 252, 631 S.E.2d 268, 276-77&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;When an administrative agency acts\r\nwithout first making the proper factual findings required by law, the proper procedure is to remand the case and allow the agency the opportunity to make those\r\nfindings.&quot;).[8]\r\nIV.&nbsp; CONCLUSION\r\nBartley has a long and complicated history of medical problems, and determining the extent, cause, and effects of her conditions has been the subject of\r\ndebate among her treating physicians. &nbsp;The commissioner expressly applied the holding in Ellison I in finding Bartley was not allowed to\r\n&quot;stack&quot; her ailments in order to determine her overall disability, and this finding was adopted by the Appellate Panel.&nbsp; The commissioner made no\r\nadditional findings after making the initial determination that other conditions could not be considered.&nbsp; The Commission's decision was affected by an\r\nerror of law; therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the matter to the Commission for consideration of Bartley's claims in light\r\nof this Court's decision in Ellison II.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Bartley has a complex medical history of physical ailments along with psychological conditions such as\r\npanic attacks and depression that have affected her for much of her adult life.\r\n[2]&nbsp; When Bartley reported pain throughout her body, the original physician also opined that she had\r\nfibromyalgia, which she had experienced previously.\r\n[3]&nbsp; &quot;Foraminal stenosis&quot; refers to a narrowing (stenosis) of the foramen (opening), i.e., the hole\r\nin a bone through which a spinal nerve passes as it exits the spine.&nbsp; A foramen is at each level of the spine, with one on each side.&nbsp; When the nerve\r\nbecomes compressed, it can cause pain and numbness, tingling, and sensory abnormalities on the affected side.&nbsp; See generally http://www.nervous-system-diseases.com/foraminal-stenosis.html.&nbsp;\r\nDepending on the location of the nerve being compressed, stenosis can result in a variety of problems, including pain that travels to the buttocks, leg, calf,\r\nand foot, or to the shoulder, arm, and hand. See, e.g., http://www.laserspineinstitute.com/back_problems/foraminal_stenosis/symptoms.\r\n[4] &nbsp;Bartley thereafter suffered several other conditions requiring medical treatment.&nbsp; In September\r\n2004, she had fusion surgery in her lower back at levels four and five due to the discovery of a facet cyst.&nbsp; Bartley did not believe this lower back\r\ncondition was related to her injury.&nbsp; In May 2005, she had surgery on her right ankle.&nbsp;\r\n[5] &nbsp;This Court denied certiorari on the question whether the statute of limitations would preclude Bartley's\r\nclaims.&nbsp; Consequently, no issue is before the Court in this regard.\r\n[6]&nbsp; Section 42-9-400(a) was later amended to refer to a &quot;disability that is substantially greater and\r\nis caused by aggravation of the preexisting impairment than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone,&quot; and it has omitted the\r\n&quot;combined effects&quot; language.&nbsp; Act No. 111, Pt. II, Â§ 3, 2007 S.C. Acts 599 (emphasis added).&nbsp; However, this change is applicable only to\r\ninjuries that occur on or after July 1, 2007 and the parties do not argue the new version applies here.\r\n[7]&nbsp; To the extent Bartley contends her pre-existing conditions included a psychological disorder, this Court\r\nhas previously held that a claimant is entitled to benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition of depression. &nbsp;See Anderson v. Baptist\r\nMed. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001).\r\n[8]&nbsp; We note that many of the symptoms Bartley suffered (such as the pain radiating down to her buttocks,\r\nleg, and foot, and her complaints of numbness and tingling) have been reported to be associated with a diagnosis of foraminal stenosis, but this is a question\r\nof fact that should be evaluated by the Commission in the first instance, along with her arguments concerning the combined effects of her conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26961","title":"State v.

McDuffie Stone, of Bluffton, for Petitioner-Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:&nbsp; In this belated direct appeal, we are asked to determine whether the State produced enough evidence to survive a directed verdict\r\nmotion by Roger Bostick during his murder trial for the death of Sarah Polite.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we find the State's evidence only raised a suspicion of\r\nguilt, we reverse.&nbsp;\r\nFACTS\r\nPolite was an older woman who served as the treasurer and secretary of her church. Her son, Rudy, lived with her in her house in Pineland, South Carolina,\r\nbut her other son, Carl, lived two miles away. Typically, Polite would bring home a briefcase containing money from the church on Sunday for deposit at the bank\r\non Monday.\r\nThe fire department was called to Polite's house on a Sunday afternoon after her house caught on fire. As the fire department attempted to extinguish the\r\nfire, Polite's body was found in the kitchen and removed by firefighters. She had been struck in the head with a blunt force object, but a subsequent autopsy\r\nrevealed that she actually died as a result of carbon monoxide from the fire. Rudy testified he had left the house earlier that day to go to an auto parts store\r\nto purchase a part for his mother's car.&nbsp; When he returned approximately an hour later, the house was engulfed in flames and it appeared ransacked when he\r\nlooked through the window. He was present when the fire department kicked in the back door and found his motherâ€™s body in the kitchen. Arson investigators\r\ndetermined the fire originated in Rudy's bedroom, and gasoline was used as an accelerant.\r\nTwo days after the fire, investigators discovered the following items belonging to Polite in a burn pile at a neighboring house belonging to Bostickâ€™s\r\nmother: two sets of car keys, toenail clippers, pens, burned paper, a metal clapsed ring of a purse, and a watch.[1]\r\nIt was later determined that a heavy petroleum product, such as kerosene or diesel fuel, was used as an accelerant in the burn pile.&nbsp; Bostick's mother,\r\nLouise, testified that she did not use kerosene or diesel fuel in the burn pile because she was afraid of those accelerants. The investigators also found a\r\nblood-spattered briefcase under Polite's kitchen table.[2]\r\nAfter interviewing Roger Bostick, the investigators asked for his clothing and shoes, which Bostick willingly delivered to them. Blood was found on his\r\njeans, and a DNA analysis was performed and cross-referenced with a standard from Polite.[3] &nbsp;The DNA analysis\r\ncame back inconclusive, and the agent who reviewed the DNA analysis findings, Nancy Skraba, testified that while ninety-nine percent of the population could be\r\nexcluded as contributing to the sample, she was unable to determine whether the blood sample actually came from Polite. The chemical analysis of the shoes\r\nrevealed a relatively fresh pattern that matched gasoline. At the close of the State's case-in-chief, Bostick moved for a directed verdict, which was\r\ndenied.&nbsp;\r\nBostick testified in his own defense, telling the jury he drank at a cookout before the fire and returned to his mother's house to take a nap before the fire\r\nengine sirens woke him up. Bostick's second witness, his sister Gladys, recounted the events of the night of the fire, and testified specifically about Rudy\r\nPolite's demeanor.&nbsp; She stated she observed Rudy entering Polite's house on the day of the fire at around six oâ€™clock as she was leaving her mother's\r\nhouse. &nbsp;When Polite's body was carried out of the house and placed on the ground, Gladys told the jury that after Rudy looked at his mother, he started to\r\nsmoke a cigarette and &quot;didn't express any emotion or feeling.&quot; &nbsp;Gladys also said she could not tell whether the house was ransacked because there\r\nwas too much smoke.\r\nBostick's final witness was his oldest sister, Sarah Howell. &nbsp;Sarah recounted an argument she overheard between Rudy and Polite on the day of the fire,\r\nwherein Polite was allegedly upset that Rudy fixed everyone's car except hers, threw her keys at him, and then went inside the house.&nbsp; According to Sarah,\r\nRudy drove off in a truck a few moments later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Bostick closed his case, he moved for a directed verdict, which was also denied.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe jury found Bostick guilty of Polite's murder, and the circuit court sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment. &nbsp;Bostick did not file a direct\r\nappeal.&nbsp; Bostick filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief (PCR), claiming his counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him about his\r\nappeal rights. The PCR judge denied his request, and this Court denied certiorari. &nbsp;Bostick filed a federal habeas corpus petition against the warden of\r\nBroad River Correctional Institution in the federal district court. Judge Joseph F. Anderson granted summary judgment in favor of the warden, and Bostick\r\nappealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Fourth Circuit reversed Judge Anderson's order, finding Bostick was denied effective assistance of counsel\r\nbecause his counsel did not file a direct appeal following Bostick's conviction.&nbsp; Judge Anderson subsequently filed an order directing that Bostick be\r\nreleased from prison unless the State of South Carolina granted him a direct appeal within a reasonable time. This Court issued a writ of certiorari so that it\r\ncould review Bostick's direct appeal issues.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBostick argues that the evidence submitted did not rise to the level of substantial circumstantial evidence necessary to submit the case to the jury.[4]&nbsp; The State submits that more than sufficient evidence was presented to submit the murder charge to the jury,\r\nand Bostick's arguments go more to the weight the jury should have accorded the State's evidence.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nA case should be submitted to the jury when the evidence is circumstantial &quot;if there is any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the\r\nguilt of the accused or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127\r\n(2000); see also State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 332, 468 S.E.2d 626, 629 (1996).&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The jury weighs the evidence but when there\r\nis an absence of evidence, it becomes the duty of the trial judge to direct a verdict . . . .&quot; State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 134, 322 S.E.2d 450,\r\n452-53 (1984). Evidence must constitute positive proof of facts and circumstances which reasonably tends to prove guilt.&nbsp; Id. at 133, 322 S.E.2d 452\r\n(citing State v. Manis, 214 S.C. 99, 51 S.E.2d 370 (1949)).&nbsp; &quot;Unless there is a total failure of competent evidence as to the charges alleged,\r\nrefusal by the trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal is not error.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 543, 243 S.E.2d 195, 197 (1978)\r\n(citing State v. Massey, 267 S.C. 432, 229 S.E.2d 332 (1976)).&nbsp; On appeal of the denial of a directed verdict of acquittal, this Court must look at\r\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the State.&nbsp; State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 602, 533 S.E.2d 572, 574 (2000).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe begin our analysis with three seminal cases from our jurisprudence analyzing the proof necessary in cases with circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; In Schrock,\r\nthe sheriff's department responded to the report of a fire at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Strickland. Schrock, 283 S.C. at 130, 322 S.E.2d at\r\n451.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Strickland's body was found amid the remains of the burned home, and Mrs. Strickland's body was floating in a small pond 200 feet from the\r\nresidence. Id. at 131, 322 S.E.2d at 451.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cigarette butts, an empty oil can, and a rolled-up newspaper were found on the premises. Id.\r\nBetween the house and the garage, a footprint was found and photographed, and a plaster cast was made. Id.&nbsp; Schrock was eventually indicted and\r\ntried for the murders.&nbsp; Id. at 130, 322 S.E.2d at 451.\r\nAs here, the evidence against Schrock produced at trial was exclusively circumstantial.&nbsp; Nothing placed Schrock at the scene of the crime, and experts\r\ncould not definitively testify that the footprint was made by shoes belonging to Schrock. Id. at 132, 322 S.E.2d at 452.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, while\r\nwitnesses could testify that Schrock was wearing tennis shoes the afternoon before the fire and the next morning, they could not place him less than three or\r\nfour miles away from the Strickland home, and the shoes presented as evidence were not identified by any witness who had seen Schrock wearing tennis\r\nshoes.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Although Schrock admitted to smoking the same Marlboro brand cigarettes located at the scene, tests run by the FBI did not\r\nindicate that Schrock had smoked the butts found. Id. at 131-32, 322 S.E.2d at 451.&nbsp; This Court found that the State had not been able to muster\r\nsubstantial circumstantial evidence warranting submission of the case to the jury; therefore, a directed verdict in favor of Schrock should have been granted by\r\nthe circuit court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Id. at 134, 322 S.E.2d at 453.\r\nIn State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 605 S.E.2d 529 (2004), the victim, Jennings Cox, was shot, and his body was found off a dirt road in Colleton\r\nCounty. 361 S.C. at 388, 605 S.E.2d at 530.&nbsp; On the last day Cox was seen alive, he borrowed a friend's BMW Z3 to go to a dentist's appointment. Id.\r\nat 388, 605 S.E.2d at 530. &nbsp;Evidence showed he withdrew money from an ATM on that day, but he was not seen again until his body was discovered. Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe car driven by Cox was found in a parking lot in Johnson City, Tennessee, and one of the State's witness testified that Arnold called him from his father's\r\nhome phone ten miles from where the car was found. &nbsp;Id. at 389, 605 S.E.2d at 530.&nbsp; While no blood was found in the car, the car had some\r\nunspecified scratches on it, and a coffee cup lid containing Arnold's fingerprint was found in the center console. Id. The court of appeals found there\r\nwas no substantial evidence to submit the case to the jury and held a directed verdict of acquittal should have been granted. Id. at 390, 605 S.E.2d at\r\n531.\r\nThis Court held that Arnold's fingerprint on the lid established only that he was in the borrowed BMW on the same day Cox was last seen alive. Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAdditionally, there was no evidence that Arnold was at the scene of the crime, which presumably was in Colleton County. Id. Even though both Arnold and\r\nthe BMW were found in Tennessee, we held the evidence only raised a suspicion of guilt and was not sufficient to show that Arnold killed Cox. Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, we affirmed the decision of the court of appeals.\r\nFinally, in Mitchell, Hugh Mathis's home was burglarized and two guns were stolen. Mitchell, 341 S.C. at 408, 535 S.E.2d at 127.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitchell had been a guest at Mathis's home on several occasions. Id.&nbsp; The day after the burglary was reported, investigators found a\r\nfingerprint on a screen leaning up against the house which matched Mitchell. Id.&nbsp; Mitchell was arrested and convicted of burglary; during his trial,\r\nMitchell moved for a directed verdict, which was denied by the circuit court. Id.\r\nThe fingerprint was the only evidence linking Mitchell to the burglary. Id. at 409, 535 S.E.2d 126.&nbsp; After first commenting that the evidence\r\npresented was entirely circumstantial, this Court determined &quot;the fact that [Mitchell's] fingerprint was on a screen that was propped up against the house\r\ndoes not prove entry where [Mitchell] had been in and around [Mathis's] house at least three times prior to the burglary.&quot; Id. &nbsp;The State did\r\nnot produce any evidence concerning whether the screen was on the window when the window was broken or when the screen had been removed. Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe accordingly affirmed the court of appeals' ruling that Mitchell was entitled to a directed verdict.&nbsp; Id.\r\n&nbsp;Analyzing the evidence presented by the State in the light most favorable to it, we believe the State's evidence here raised only a suspicion of guilt\r\nby Bostick.&nbsp; No direct evidence linked Bostick to the crime scene or the items found in the burn pile.&nbsp; Moreover, there was no testimony tending to\r\nestablish that Bostick had control over the burn pile.&nbsp; When the State closed its case against Bostick, the following pieces of circumstantial evidence of\r\nhis guilt had been presented: (1) Polite's car keys, calculator, and other items from her home were found in the Bostick family's burn pile;&nbsp; (2) the fire\r\nin the burn pile was accelerated with either kerosene or diesel fuel, and Bostickâ€™s mother did not use those accelerants when she burned things in the pile;\r\n(3) Bostick had a pattern that matched gasoline on his shoes and gasoline was the accelerant used for the house fire; and (4) while the DNA from the blood found\r\non Bostick's jeans excluded about ninety-nine percent of the population, the blood could not be matched to Polite's DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the weapon\r\nused to beat Polite in the head was never introduced into evidence.&nbsp; Finally, no evidence was introduced concerning Bostick's knowledge that Polite may\r\nhave had money in the briefcase or if indeed any money was in the briefcase on that particular Sunday.&nbsp; The evidence presented by the State raised, at\r\nmost, a mere suspicion that Bostick committed this crime.&nbsp; Under settled principles, the trial court should grant a directed verdict motion when the\r\nevidence presented merely raises a suspicion of guilt. State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 594, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004). &nbsp;Therefore, we find the\r\ncircuit court erred in failing to direct a verdict in favor of Bostick.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore, we reverse the circuit court and remand it back with instructions to issue a judgment consistent with our ruling.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The burn pile was in the Bostick family's immediate back yard, which was approximately a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom Polite's home.\r\n[2] No evidence was introduced concerning the contents of the briefcase.\r\n[3] No blood standard was taken from Bostick.&nbsp;\r\n[4] Because of our disposition of this issue, we decline to address Bostick's remaining evidentiary issue relating\r\nto improper character evidence.&nbsp; See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that if\r\nan appellate court's ruling on a particular issue is dispositive of an appeal, rulings on remaining issues are unnecessary).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Joseph W.

Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-160 (2002 &amp; Supp.\r\n2010).&nbsp; One type of project that requires a CON is &quot;the acquisition of medical equipment which is to be used for diagnosis or treatment,&quot; if the\r\ntotal project cost for the acquisition exceeds $600,000.&nbsp; Id. Â§ 44-7-160(6); 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 102(1)(f) (1976 &amp; Supp. 2010).\r\nWhen there is a question about whether a particular project exceeds the $600,000 threshold, the &quot;potential applicant&quot; must request &quot;a formal\r\ndetermination by the Department as to the applicability of the certificate of need requirements to [that] project.&quot;&nbsp; 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§\r\n102(3). &nbsp;A formal determination that the total project cost does not exceed $600,000 is called a Non-Applicability Determination (&quot;NAD&quot;).\r\nSouthern MRI requested a NAD for MRI equipment to be located at a new imaging center in Hilton Head, South Carolina.&nbsp; The imaging center would also\r\ninclude a host of other equipment, specifically a computed tomography (&quot;CT&quot;) unit, two ultrasound machines,[1]\r\na DEXA (which is used for measuring bone density), and an x-ray unit.&nbsp; These various forms of imaging equipment are referred to throughout the record, and\r\nthis opinion, as &quot;modalities.&quot;\r\nDHEC treated each of these six modalities as a separate project for the purpose of the NAD request.&nbsp; However, because all six modalities would be\r\nlocated in a single building, they shared certain capital costs.&nbsp; For this reason, DHEC attributed a portion of each shared cost to each modality.&nbsp;\r\nSignificantly, DHEC chose to allocate each modality an equal share.&nbsp; Using this allocation method, DHEC determined the total project cost for the MRI was\r\nless than $600,000.&nbsp; Thus, DHEC issued a NAD to Southern MRI, allowing Southern MRI to construct the imaging center and acquire the MRI.\r\nAppellants MRI at Belfair and Hilton Head Regional Medical Center challenged the NAD in a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Court (&quot;ALC&quot;),\r\narguing the total project cost for the MRI exceeded $600,000.[2]&nbsp; The ALC upheld the NAD.&nbsp; The appeal was\r\ncertified to this Court pursuant to Rule 204, SCACR.\r\nOn appeal, the parties present us with two main disputes.&nbsp; First, Appellants contend DHEC's method for allocating shared costs equally among the six\r\nmodalities was improper.&nbsp; Second, Appellants contend DHEC undervalued the land and building leased by Southern MRI.&nbsp; Appellants contend that a proper\r\ncalculation of the value of the property and a proper allocation of shared costs would result in a determination that the total project cost for the MRI\r\nexceeded $600,000.\r\nII.\r\nOn appeal from a final decision of the ALC in a contested case, we &quot;may reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights of the [Appellants]\r\nhave been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or decision is: . . . (d) affected by [an] error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\nprobative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise\r\nof discretion.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B) (2005 &amp; Supp. 2010).\r\nIII.\r\nA. Allocation of Shared Costs\r\n\r\n  DHEC regulations define &quot;total project cost&quot; as:\r\n  [T]he estimated total capital cost of a project including land cost, construction, fixed and moveable equipment, architect's fee, financing cost, and other\r\n  capital costs properly charged under generally accepted accounting princip[le]s as a capital cost.&nbsp; The determination of project costs involving leased\r\n  equipment o[r] buildings will be calculated based on the total value (purchase price) of the equipment or building being leased.\r\n\r\n24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 103(25).&nbsp; The six modalities in the imaging center shared several of the costs enumerated in this definition.&nbsp;\r\nFor example, they shared common areas of the leased building, certain fixed and moveable equipment, and financing costs.&nbsp; Appellants argue it was improper\r\nfor DHEC to allocate these shared costs equally among the modalities.&nbsp; We agree under the circumstances of this case.\r\nThe parties have focused much debate on whether DHEC was required to apply generally accepted accounting principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;) when allocating shared\r\ncosts.&nbsp; Each party contends application of GAAP can only lead to one result, and that result is the one advocated by its expert.&nbsp; The competing\r\nopinions of the GAAP experts refute the premise of a single answer.&nbsp; GAAP are not a precise science.&nbsp; GAAP require the exercise of professional\r\njudgment and can lead to varying results.&nbsp; Here, the parties presented conflicting expert testimony with regard to whether DHEC's method of allocating\r\nshared costs was GAAP-compliant.&nbsp; Thus, given the inherent mix of objective and subjective considerations at play in a GAAP determination, application of\r\nGAAP is easier said than done.&nbsp; There is no bright-line application of GAAP in this case that easily answers the CON monetary threshold.&nbsp; Instead, we\r\nturn to &quot;[t]he cardinal rule of statutory construction&quot; that we must &quot;ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever\r\npossible.&quot;&nbsp; Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).\r\nThe express purposes of the CON Act are &quot;to promote cost containment, prevent unnecessary duplication of health care facilities and services, guide the\r\nestablishment of health facilities and services which will best serve public needs, and ensure that high quality services are provided in health facilities in\r\nthis State.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-120 (2002).&nbsp; The calculation of total project cost, then, is part of the mechanism by which the CON Act\r\nachieves its goal of cost containment.&nbsp; As such, DHEC must calculate total project cost in a manner that reflects the true cost of the project at\r\nissue.&nbsp; If a reasonable estimate of the cost of a project exceeds $600,000, it would be directly contrary to the purposes of the CON Act to allow that\r\nproject to avoid CON review.&nbsp; See id. (&quot;To achieve these purposes, this article requires: (1) the issuance of a Certificate of Need\r\nbefore undertaking a project prescribed by this article . . . .&quot;).&nbsp; The CON regulations require DHEC to use &quot;[c]ommon practice and common\r\nsense&quot; in determining whether a proposal presents a single expenditure for purposes of the $600,000 threshold, and further provide that &quot;[a]n\r\napplicant should not be allowed to split what is really one expenditure into two or more for the purpose of avoiding review.&quot;&nbsp; 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n61-15 Â§ 102(2).&nbsp; Accordingly, DHEC must not allow a potential CON applicant to avoid the CON process based on an arbitrary factor.&nbsp; DHEC's method for\r\nallocating shared costs in this case had precisely that effect.\r\nAt the contested case hearing, DHEC witnesses explained that DHEC had recently changed its approach to allocating shared costs in imaging centers.&nbsp;\r\nPreviously, DHEC's practice had been to calculate the total project cost using two alternative allocation methods, then use whichever figure was higher to make\r\nits Non-Applicability Determination.&nbsp; DHEC would (1) divide shared costs by the number of modalities and (2) allocate shared costs in proportion to the\r\namount of clinical space dedicated to each modality.&nbsp; The latter method, referred to as the &quot;relative square footage&quot; method, is one of the\r\nallocation methods now advanced by Appellants.\r\nWhen a new DHEC employee assumed responsibility for NAD requests, she proposed a change to DHEC's practice.&nbsp; This employee testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  [I]t made more sense to -- to allocate as a percentage [of] clinical space with physician practices because often within physician practices there's only\r\n  one modality.&nbsp; And that's certainly not their -- their sole practice or -- or their main function.&nbsp; Their main function is to see patients, and this\r\n  is there as a service to their patients.\r\n  With an imaging center there's often more than one modality, and their main function is to provide imaging services.&nbsp; It made sense to\r\n  me to prorate based on the amount of clinical space to physician's practices and to prorate based on the number of modalities with imaging centers.\r\n\r\nOn the suggestion of this employee, DHEC began allocating shared costs in imaging centers by dividing by the number of modalities.&nbsp; DHEC nevertheless\r\ncontinued to apply the relative square footage method advanced by Appellants to other entities, such as physicians' offices, that submitted NAD requests for the\r\nsame equipment.\r\nWe find this distinction arbitrary because the differing purposes of imaging centers, physicians' offices and other facilities have no real impact on the\r\ncost of the equipment each might seek to acquire. &nbsp;Clearly, DHEC's policy shift and distinction in allocation method can have a profound impact on the\r\ntotal project cost.&nbsp; For example, using the relative square footage method, the MRI in this case would have been allocated 32.422 percent of each shared\r\ncost, rather than one-sixth (16.667 percent) of each shared cost.[3]&nbsp; Moreover, the statutory and regulatory\r\nframework contemplates that imaging centers seeking to purchase the same equipment as other facilities must compete with those other facilities in the CON\r\nprocess.&nbsp; See 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 307(2) (&quot;In the case of competing applications, [DHEC] shall award a Certificate of\r\nNeed, if appropriate, on the basis of which [application], if any, most fully complies with the requirements, goals, and purposes of the [CON] program, State\r\nHealth Plan, project review criteria, and any regulations developed by [DHEC].&quot;). &nbsp;Thus, DHEC's calculation of total project cost was affected by an\r\narbitrary factor that strayed substantially from legislative intent and worked substantial prejudice to Southern MRI's competitors.\r\nGiven legislative intent, specifically the need for DHEC's calculation to reflect the practical reality of the proposal, it follows that the function of\r\nmultiple modalities in a single facility can be relevant to the choice of an appropriate allocation method.&nbsp; For example, if the equipment sought to be\r\npurchased forms the main basis for the construction of the facility as a whole, then it might be reasonable in light of the purposes of the CON Act to charge\r\nthat equipment with a greater portion of the overhead costs of the facility than might be charged to other, smaller projects within the same building.&nbsp; In\r\nthis way, DHEC retains the flexibility to choose an allocation method that best suits the realities, and more accurately captures the true capital cost, of a\r\nproject proposal.&nbsp; Cf. 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§ 102(2) (requiring DHEC to apply &quot;[c]ommon practice and common sense,&quot; to prevent\r\napplicants from splitting &quot;what is really one expenditure into two or more for the purpose of avoiding review,&quot; and to avoid &quot;lump[ing] projects\r\ntogether arbitrarily to bring them under review&quot;).&nbsp; Where, as here, DHEC's chosen method has no basis in the facts of the proposal and arbitrarily\r\nallows a potential applicant to avoid the CON review process, it is contrary to the purposes of the CON Act and therefore an error of law.\r\nWe note that by maintaining a rational fit between the allocation method and the proposal at issue, DHEC can avoid creating incentives for potential\r\napplicants to manipulate the NAD process and avoid CON review.&nbsp; If DHEC always divides shared costs by the number of modalities in an imaging center, an\r\nimaging center seeking to avoid CON review could purchase unnecessary but inexpensive equipment in order to drive down the total project cost of other, more\r\nexpensive equipment.&nbsp; This danger is especially pronounced where, as here, the modalities at issue are different in every meaningful way.&nbsp; For\r\nexample, DHEC acknowledged at oral argument that the MRI was significantly more expensive and required considerably more space than the other imaging\r\nmodalities.&nbsp; The MRI was also expected to generate more patient traffic and more revenue than the other modalities.&nbsp; DHEC's current allocation method\r\nleft such disparities in the investment in and importance of each modality unaccounted for, making the NAD process vulnerable to manipulation.[4]\r\nIn sum, DHEC's policy shift concerning imaging centers and its choice of allocation method in this case are manifestly at odds with legislative intent.&nbsp;\r\nThus, the deference we normally accord an agency's policy determinations is not warranted.&nbsp; See S.C. Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nHealth and Envtl. Control, 363 S.C. 67, 75, 610 S.E.2d 482, 486 (2005) (&quot;Courts defer to the relevant administrative agency's decisions with respect to\r\nits own regulations unless there is a compelling reason to differ.&quot;). &nbsp;Where modalities are truly similar, a division by modalities may be an\r\nappropriate method of capturing and allocating total project costs for CON purposes.&nbsp; Here, however, DHEC conceded that the MRI was the key financial\r\nproducer and main expenditure for the proposed imaging center.[5]&nbsp; Treating the other lesser modalities equally\r\ndid not reflect the true cost of this project.&nbsp; DHEC's approval of an equal allocation of costs among manifestly unequal modalities resulted in an\r\nartificial reduction in total project cost.&nbsp; As a result, we find that DHEC erred as a matter of law.&nbsp; In so holding, we do not mandate any particular\r\nallocation formula, nor do we foreclose the possibility that DHEC might return to its previous practice of applying the highest figure obtained under any\r\nallocation method.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the method chosen by DHEC must provide a reasonable estimate of the true cost of the project at issue.\r\nWe turn now to Appellants' challenge to the appraised value of the property.\r\nB. Value of the Property\r\nAs defined by regulation, the total project cost for the MRI included the cost of leasing the building in which the imaging center was located, and this cost\r\nwas to be calculated &quot;based on the total value (purchase price) of the . . . &nbsp;building being leased.&quot;&nbsp; 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 Â§\r\n103(25).&nbsp; Thus, Southern MRI provided DHEC with an appraisal by Gary Beaver, an appraiser licensed in South Carolina, valuing the property at\r\n$500,000.&nbsp; DHEC accepted this appraisal and attributed one-sixth of that cost to the MRI project.&nbsp; The ALC upheld this decision.&nbsp; Appellants\r\ncontend the ALC erred in relying on the Beaver appraisal.&nbsp; We vacate this finding and place the property valuation issue before the ALC for a de novo\r\ndetermination.\r\nAt the contested case hearing, Appellants presented evidence that Beaver was disciplined by the Colorado Board of Real Estate Appraisers for failure to\r\nproperly understand and employ recognized appraisal methods, and his license in Colorado was eventually revoked.&nbsp; More importantly for our purposes on\r\nappeal, Appellants presented evidence that several assumptions underlying the $500,000 appraisal in this case were inaccurate.&nbsp; For example, Appellants\r\npresented evidenceâ€”and the ALC foundâ€”that the building measured 5,083 square feet.&nbsp; Beaver's appraisal, however, stated the building was 5,016 square\r\nfeet.&nbsp; As another example, Beaver made deductions from the appraised value of the building to account for the cost of mold remediation estimated at\r\n$30,000, but Appellants presented evidence that the actual cost of mold remediation was only $1,200.&nbsp; Appellants offered an alternative value for the\r\nproperty of $775,000, based on their expert's appraisal.&nbsp; Southern MRI also offered an alternative value through Thomas Pietras, a certified public\r\naccountant and GAAP expert.&nbsp; Pietras valued the property at $634,500.\r\nThe ALC found Appellants &quot;did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it was contrary to the applicable regulations to rely on Beaver's\r\nappraisal.&quot;&nbsp; However, the ALC acknowledged the Beaver appraisal was questionable, stating:\r\n\r\n  Applying GAAP to Beaver's appraisal may bring into question its reliability.&nbsp; In that event, the court is persuaded by Pietras's land valuation, which\r\n  he determined by capitalizing the purchase option contained in the lease executed between Southern MRI and its landlord.&nbsp; The market value of the land\r\n  and building would then be $634,500.\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, the total project cost must be a reasonable estimate of the true capital cost of the project at issue.&nbsp; Accordingly, to show that\r\nusing Beaver's appraisal was &quot;contrary to the applicable regulations,&quot; Appellants needed only show that Beaver's appraisal was unreasonable.&nbsp; To\r\nthe extent the ALC's decision implies Appellants needed to make some additional showing, the decision was affected by an error of law.&nbsp; It appears to us\r\nthat the ALC felt constrained to follow DHEC's acceptance of the Beaver appraisal; as the fact-finder, the ALC was free to make factual findings based on its\r\nview of the credibility and weight of the evidence.&nbsp; The reasonableness of an appraisal is clearly an issue of fact, subject to the substantial evidence\r\nstandard of review.&nbsp; Here, the ALC did not make a finding that Beaver's appraisal was reasonable and expressly found a higher value for the property\r\n&quot;persuasive.&quot;&nbsp; We vacate and remand for a de novo determination of the value of the property.\r\nIV.\r\nThe express purposes of the CON Act, which include preventing unnecessarily duplicative facilities and services and containing costs, require DHEC to\r\ncalculate total project cost in a manner that reflects the true cost of the project at issue.&nbsp; DHEC's method of allocating shared costs in this caseâ€”which\r\nwas accepted by the ALCâ€”permitted Southern MRI to reduce its total project cost based on a factor unrelated to the realities of its proposed imaging center.\r\nThis was an error of law, and we reverse the portion of the ALC's order that relied on an equal division of shared costs. &nbsp;Moreover, the ALC failed to\r\nrecognize that it would be contrary to the CON Act and its applicable regulations to rely on an appraisal that was not a reasonable estimate of the value of the\r\nproperty leased by Southern MRI.&nbsp; Thus, if the Beaver appraisal was unreasonable, it was error to rely on it.&nbsp; For this reason, we vacate the portion\r\nof the ALC's order that relied on the Beaver appraisal. &nbsp;We remand for further proceedings.\r\nREVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Southern MRI later determined that it would not pursue a second ultrasound machine.&nbsp; Instead, it\r\nentered into a purchase agreement for a mammography unit.\r\n[2]&nbsp; After receiving its NAD, Southern MRI successfully moved to lift the automatic stay imposed by section\r\n1-23-600 of the South Carolina Code during the pendency of the contested case.&nbsp; Southern MRI proceeded with construction, opened the imaging center, and\r\nbegan serving patients.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The ALC found the imaging center included 616.86 square feet of clinical space dedicated to the MRI and\r\n1285.72 square feet of clinical space dedicated to the other imaging modalities.&nbsp; Thus, the MRI accounted for 32.422 percent of the total clinical space in\r\nthe imaging center.\r\n[4]&nbsp; Other allocation methods could also invite manipulation.&nbsp; For example, a relative square footage\r\nmethod could be manipulated by placing inexpensive equipment in unnecessarily large rooms.&nbsp; The key to avoiding such gamesmanship is to look at the\r\npractical realities of the proposal.\r\n[5]&nbsp; At oral argument, DHEC referred to the six modalities as &quot;one big thing and five little\r\nthings.&quot;&nbsp; The &quot;one big thing&quot; was the MRI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26963","title":"In the Matter of J.M.

Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970).&nbsp; The remaining counts of indecent\r\nexposure were dismissed by the prosecutor.&nbsp; Respondent was sentenced to thirty (30) days in jail or a fine of $300 on each count.&nbsp; Respondent paid the\r\nfines.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following Rule of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:&nbsp; Rule 8.4(b) (it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer\r\nin other respects). &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, respondent admits that his actions constitute grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(5), RLDE,\r\nRule 413, SCACR (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts\r\nor the legal profession into disrepute).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for nine (9) months, retroactive to the date of his interim\r\nsuspension.&nbsp; Further, respondent shall obtain mental health counseling for a period of one (1) year from the date of this opinion and shall provide\r\nquarterly reports from his mental health counselor to the Commission certifying his cooperation with counseling.&nbsp; Respondent shall pay the costs incurred\r\nin the investigation and prosecution of this matter no later than thirty (30) days from the date of this opinion.&nbsp; Within fifteen days of the filing of\r\nthis opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit demonstrating he has complied with the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] On March 1, 2010, the Court placed respondent on interim suspension.&nbsp; In the Matter of Long, 387\r\nS.C. 19, 690 S.E.2d 774 (2010).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26964","title":"In the Matter of Anonymous Member of the South Carolina Bar","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26964","description":"","date":"2011-04-25","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Anonymous Member of the South Carolina Bar, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.&nbsp; 26964\r\nHeard September 22, 2010 - Filed April 25, 2011&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLETTER OF CAUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Disciplinary Counsel Lesley M. Coggiola and Deputy Disciplinary Counsel Barbara M. Seymour, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        David Dusty Rhoades, of Charleston, and Cynthia Barrier Patterson, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; In this attorney discipline matter, the Hearing Panel (the Panel) determined Respondent was subject to discipline for violating Rule\r\n7(a)(5), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and Rule 8.4(e), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, both of which provide that a lawyer may be disciplined for engaging in conduct tending to\r\npollute the administration of justice or bring the legal profession into disrepute, and Rule 7(a)(6), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, which provides it is a ground for\r\ndiscipline for an attorney to violate the attorney's oath of office.&nbsp; A majority of the Panel concluded Respondent's action warranted an admonition and\r\nwould require Respondent to pay the costs of this proceeding, while one member of the Panel recommended Respondent receive a Letter of Caution with a finding of\r\nminor misconduct.&nbsp; We find that Respondent did violate the rules outlined above, but we disagree with the majority of the Panel's recommendation.&nbsp; We\r\nfind Respondentâ€™s acknowledgement of misconduct and remorse to be sincere and effective in the mitigation of our sanction.&nbsp; Accordingly, we issue a\r\nprivate Letter of Caution with a finding of minor misconduct to Respondent.\r\nAdditionally, for the benefit of the bar, we take this opportunity to address what we see as a growing problem among the bar, namely the manner in which\r\nattorneys treat one another in oral and written communication.&nbsp; We are concerned with the increasing complaints of incivility in the bar.&nbsp; We believe\r\nUnited States Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's words elucidate a lawyer's duty: &quot;More civility and greater professionalism can only enhance the\r\npleasure lawyers find in practice, increase the effectiveness of our system of justice, and improve the public's perception of lawyers.&quot;&nbsp; Sandra Day\r\nO'Connor, Professionalism, 76 Wash. U. L.Q. 5, 8 (1998).\r\nFACTS\r\nThe formal charges in this matter arose out of a disciplinary complaint regarding an e-mail message Respondent sent to opposing counsel (Attorney Doe) in a\r\npending domestic matter.&nbsp; Respondent represented the mother and Attorney Doe represented the father in an emotional and heated domestic dispute.&nbsp; It\r\nwas within this context that Respondent sent Attorney Doe the following e-mail (the &quot;Drug Dealer&quot; e-mail):\r\n\r\n  I have a client who is a drug dealer on . . . Street down town [sic].&nbsp; He informed me that your daughter, [redacted] was detained for buying cocaine\r\n  and heroine [sic].&nbsp; She is, or was, a teenager, right?&nbsp; This happened at night in a known high crime/drug area, where alos [sic] many shootings take\r\n  place.&nbsp; Lucky for her and the two other teens, they weren't charged.&nbsp; Does this make you and [redacted] bad parents?&nbsp; This incident is far\r\n  worse than the allegations your client is making.&nbsp; I just thought it was ironic.&nbsp; You claim that this case is so serious and complicated.&nbsp;\r\n  There is nothing more complicated and serious than having a child grow up in a high class white family with parents who are highly educated and financially\r\n  successful and their child turning out buying drugs from a crack head at night on or near . . . Street.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Am I right?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAttorney Doe's spouse, also an attorney, filed the complaint in this matter after Attorney Doe disclosed the &quot;Drug Dealer&quot; e-mail to him.&nbsp; At\r\nthe hearing, Respondent admitted that Attorney Doe's daughter had no connection to the domestic action.&nbsp;\r\nAt the hearing, Respondent asserted that the e-mail was in response to daily obnoxious, condescending, and harassing e-mails, faxes, and hand-delivered\r\nletters from Attorney Doe.&nbsp; These communications allegedly commented on the fact that Respondent is not a parent and therefore could not advise\r\nRespondent's client appropriately.[1]&nbsp; In support of this contention, Respondent submitted five e-mail exchanges\r\nbetween Respondent and Attorney Doe, four of which were dated after the &quot;Drug Dealer&quot; e-mail.&nbsp; In further support of Respondent's assertions,\r\nRespondent claimed to possess ten banker's boxes full of e-mails and other documents that constituted daily bullying from Attorney Doe; however, these documents\r\nwere not produced.&nbsp; Due to a lack of evidence supporting Respondent's assertions, the Panel found Respondent's testimony to be entirely lacking in\r\ncredibility.&nbsp; Ultimately, the Panel found Respondent was subject to discipline for sending the &quot;Drug Dealer&quot; e-mail to Attorney Doe.&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;This Court has the sole authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the record.&quot; &nbsp;In\r\nre Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000) (citations omitted). &quot;Although this Court is not bound by the findings of the Panel and\r\nCommittee, these findings are entitled to great weight, particularly when the inferences to be drawn from the testimony depend on the credibility of the\r\nwitnesses.&quot; &nbsp;In re Marshall, 331 S.C. 514, 519, 498 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1998) (citation omitted). &nbsp;&quot;However, this Court may make its own\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.&quot; &nbsp;Id. (citation omitted).\r\nLAW\r\nI. Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\r\n&quot;It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.&quot; &nbsp;Rule 8.4(e),\r\nRPC, Rule 407, SCACR.&nbsp; Additionally, a lawyer is subject to discipline for &quot;engag[ing] in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or\r\nto bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Rule 7(a)(5), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp; This Court has stated that a lawyer\r\n&quot;must act in a dignified and professional manner, with proper respect for the parties, witnesses, opposing counsel, and for the Court. When a lawyer fails\r\nto conduct himself appropriately, he brings into question the integrity of the judicial system, and, as well, disserves his client.&quot;&nbsp; In re Goude,\r\n296 S.C. 510, 512, 374 S.E.2d 496, 497&nbsp;(1988).\r\nWe agree with the Panel that Respondent's e-mail was conduct tending to bring the legal profession into disrepute and was prejudicial to the administration\r\nof justice.&nbsp; By sending the &quot;Drug Dealer&quot; e-mail to Attorney Doe, Respondent was doing a disservice to Respondent's client.&nbsp; An e-mail such\r\nas the one sent by Respondent can only inflame the passions of everyone involved, make litigation more intense, and undermine a lawyer's ability to objectively\r\nrepresent his or her client.&nbsp; This kind of personal attack against a family member of opposing counsel with no connection to the litigation brings into\r\nquestion the integrity of the judicial system and prejudices the administration of justice.&nbsp;\r\nII. Violation of the Lawyer's Oath\r\nRespondent contends that the civility clause contained within the lawyer's oath is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nRespondent took the lawyer's oath which includes the following clause, &quot;To opposing parties and their counsel, I pledge fairness, integrity, and\r\ncivility, not only in court, but also in all written and oral communications . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Rule 402(k), SCACR.&nbsp; The United States Supreme Court has\r\nnoted that lawyers are not entitled to the same First Amendment protections as laypeople.&nbsp; See In re Snyder,&nbsp;472 U.S. 634, 644-45, 105 S. Ct.\r\n2874, 2881&nbsp;(1985).&nbsp; Moreover, attorneys' &quot;[o]bedience to ethical precepts may require abstention from what in other circumstances might be\r\nconstitutionally protected speech.&quot;&nbsp; In re Sawyer, 360 U.S. 622, 646-47, 79 S. Ct. 1376, 1388&nbsp;(1959) (Stewart, J., concurring).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;Even outside the courtroom, . . . lawyers in pending cases [are] subject to ethical restrictions on speech to which an ordinary citizen would not\r\nbe.&quot;&nbsp; Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada,&nbsp;501 U.S. 1030, 1071, 111 S. Ct. 2720, 2743&nbsp;(1991).\r\nA. Vague\r\n&quot;The concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the constitutional principle that procedural due process requires fair notice and proper standards\r\nfor adjudication.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Albert, 257 S.C. 131, 134, 184 S.E.2d 605, 606&nbsp;(1971).&nbsp; &quot;A law is unconstitutionally vague if it\r\nforbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that a person of common intelligence must necessarily guess as to its meaning and differ as to its\r\napplication.&quot;&nbsp; Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 572, 549 S.E.2d 591, 598&nbsp;(2001) (citation omitted).&nbsp;\r\nIn Grievance Administrator v. Fieger,&nbsp;719 N.W.2d 123&nbsp;(Mich. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1205, 127 S. Ct. 1257 (2007), an attorney\r\nchallenged the constitutionality of Michigan's &quot;civility&quot; and &quot;courtesy&quot; rules for lawyers.&nbsp; That court held, &quot;Such a challenge\r\ncannot be successfully advanced here because there is no question that even the most casual reading of these rules would put a person clearly on notice that the\r\nkind of language used by Mr. Fieger would violate MRPC 3.5(c) and MRPC 6.5(a).&quot;&nbsp; Fieger,&nbsp;719 N.W.2d at 139.&nbsp; In this case, there is\r\nno question that even a casual reading of the attorney's oath would put a person on notice that the type of language used in Respondent's &quot;Drug\r\nDealer&quot; e-mail violates the civility clause.&nbsp; Casting aspersions on an opposing counsel's offspring and questioning the manner in which an opposing\r\nattorney was rearing his or her own children does not even near the margins of the civility clause.&nbsp; While no one argued it in this case, it could be\r\nargued that the language used by Respondent in the &quot;Drug Dealer&quot; e-mail constituted fighting words.&nbsp; Moreover, a person of common intelligence\r\ndoes not have to guess at the meaning of the civility oath.&nbsp; We hold, as the court held in Fieger, that the civility oath is not unconstitutionally\r\nvague.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nB. Overbroad\r\n&quot;The First Amendment overbreadth doctrine is an exception to the usual rules regarding the standards for facial challenges.&quot;&nbsp; In re Amir\r\nX.S.,&nbsp;371 S.C. 380, 384, 639 S.E.2d 144, 146&nbsp;(2006).&nbsp; Under the overbreadth doctrine, &quot;the party challenging a statute simply must\r\ndemonstrate that the statute could cause someone elseâ€”anyone elseâ€”to refrain from constitutionally protected expression.&quot;&nbsp; Id. (citation\r\nomitted).&nbsp; The overbreadth doctrine has &quot;been implemented out of concern that the threat of enforcement of an overly broad law may deter or 'chill'\r\nconstitutionally protected speechâ€”especially when the overly broad law imposes criminal sanctions.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 384-85, 639 S.E.2d at 146\r\n(citation omitted).&nbsp; The overbreadth doctrine:\r\n\r\n  &nbsp;. . . permits a court to wholly invalidate a statute only when the terms are so broad that they punish a substantial amount of protected free speech\r\n  in relation to the statute's otherwise plainly legitimate sweepâ€”until and unless a limiting construction or\r\n  partial invalidation narrows it so as to remove the threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression.\r\n\r\nId. at 385, 639 S.E.2d at 146-47 (citation omitted).\r\nA court analyzing whether a disciplinary rule violates the First Amendment must balance &quot;the State's interest in the regulation of a specialized\r\nprofession against a lawyer's First Amendment interest in the kind of speech that was at issue.&quot;&nbsp; Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S.\r\n1030, 1073, 111 S. Ct. 2720, 2744&nbsp;(1991).&nbsp; &quot;In those instances where a lawyer's unbridled speech amounts to misconduct which threatens a\r\nsignificant state interest, a state may restrict the lawyer's exercise of personal rights guaranteed by the Constitutions.&quot;&nbsp; In re Johnson, 729\r\nP.2d 1175, 1178&nbsp;(Kan. 1986) (citing N.A.A.C.P. v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438, 83 S. Ct. 328, 340-41 (1963)).&nbsp; &quot;A layman may,\r\nperhaps, pursue his theories of free speech . . . until he runs afoul of the penalties of libel or slander, or into some infraction of our statutory law.&nbsp;\r\nA member of the bar can, and will, be stopped at the point where he infringes our Canon of Ethics.&quot;&nbsp; In re Woodward, 300 S.W.2d 385, 393-94&nbsp;(Mo.\r\n1957).\r\nThe interests protected by the civility oath are the administration of justice and integrity of the lawyer-client relationship.&nbsp; The State has an\r\ninterest in ensuring a system of regulation that prohibits lawyers from attacking each other personally in the manner in which Respondent attacked Attorney\r\nDoe.&nbsp; Such conduct not only compromises the integrity of the judicial process, it also undermines a lawyer's ability to objectively represent his or her\r\nclient.&nbsp; There is no substantial amount of protected free speech penalized by the civility oath in light of the oath's plainly legitimate sweep of\r\nsupporting the administration of justice and the lawyer-client relationship.&nbsp; Thus, we find the civility oath is not unconstitutionally overbroad.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Respondent violated Rule 7(a)(5), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and Rule 8.4(e), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, both of which provide that a lawyer may be\r\ndisciplined for engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or bring the legal profession into disrepute, and Rule 7(a)(6), RLDE, Rule\r\n413, SCACR, which provides it is a ground for discipline for an attorney to violate the attorney's oath of office.&nbsp; Because we find Respondentâ€™s\r\nacknowledgement of misconduct and remorse to be sincere, we issue a private Letter of Caution with a finding of minor misconduct to Respondent.&nbsp; We publish\r\nthis Letter of Caution in the In re Anonymous format so as to provide guidance to the bar.&nbsp; We caution the bar that henceforth, this type of conduct\r\ncould result in a public sanction.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Tenney (Respondent)[1] is the fee simple owner of Little Jack Rowe Island (Little Jack\r\nRowe), a 15.45 acre undeveloped island located in Beaufort County.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFacts/ Procedural Background\r\nThis action was precipitated by OCRM's refusal to process Respondent's dock permit application without proof of a sovereign's grant to the property.&nbsp; In\r\n2003, then Attorney General Henry D. McMaster (AG) issued an opinion in response to DHEC's question of whether it is legal to grant permits for bridges to\r\nislands that are presumed to be owned by the State, without a showing of a sovereign's grant.&nbsp; That opinion stated in accordance with Coburg, Inc. v.\r\nLesser, 309 S.C. 252, 422 S.E.2d 96 (1992) (Coburg I) and Coburg Dairy, Inc. v. Lesser, 318 S.C. 510, 458 S.E.2d 547 (1995) (Coburg II)\r\n(collectively, Coburg), the State is the presumptive owner of all &quot;marsh islands,&quot; and therefore, permit applicants must produce\r\n&quot;an original grant from the State or predecessor sovereign&quot; to demonstrate ownership. &nbsp;2003 S.C. AG LEXIS 231 (Dec. 5, 2003).&nbsp; Based on this\r\nopinion, on February 19, 2004, DHEC published a public notice advertising that all applicants seeking permits to build structures on undeveloped islands must\r\nprovide a sovereign's grant as proof of ownership.&nbsp; This requirement was not statutory, as the South Carolina Code required only &quot;[a] copy of the\r\ndeed, lease or other instrument under which the applicant claims title, possession or permission from the owner of the property to carry out the proposal.&quot;\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-140 (1987 &amp; Supp. 1993).\r\nOn September 20, 2005, DHEC submitted draft regulations to the Board of Health and Environmental Control (Board) that would amend 23A S.C. Reg. 30-2 and\r\n30-12(N).&nbsp; This draft proposed that the State was the presumptive owner of marshes and coastal islands, and therefore, in order that an applicant be\r\ngranted a permit to build a structure in these areas, the applicant must supply the following as proof of ownership: (1) a copy of a document that shows an\r\noriginal grant of the island from a sovereign, (2) an attorney's title opinion, (3) a title abstract, and (4) a deed to the applicant.&nbsp;\r\nOn June 23, 2006, the General Assembly adopted coastal island regulations promulgated by DHEC.&nbsp; The draft regulation described above was not included in\r\nthese adopted regulations.&nbsp; Under section 48-39-140 of the South Carolina Code and in volume 23A of the South Carolina Code of Regulations, regulation\r\n30-2-(B)(4), it remained that proof of ownership required only a copy of the deed or other document under which the applicant claimed ownership or authority to\r\nbuild.&nbsp; Nevertheless, on November 10, 2006, DHEC submitted a second public notice informing all interested parties that proof of ownership of undeveloped\r\nislands for which an applicant seeks to obtain a dock permit requires the applicant submit proof of a sovereign's grant, an attorney's title opinion, and an\r\naccompanying abstract of title.\r\nOn September 27, 2005, Respondent purchased Little Jack Rowe for $875,000 from Bradbury Dyer, III (Dyer) by way of general warranty deed.&nbsp; The chain of\r\ntitle to Little Jack Rowe dates back to 1865 when the United States government issued a Federal Tax Certificate as a measure to collect delinquent taxes from\r\n&quot;insurrectionary districts within the United States.&quot;&nbsp; Little Jack Rowe is a 15.452 acre island located in Bluffton Township, Beaufort County,\r\nSouth Carolina.&nbsp; Before Respondent purchased Little Jack Rowe from Dyer, the island was historically sold as part of Jack Rowe Island.&nbsp; Jack Rowe\r\nIsland is roughly 53 acres in size and is connected to Little Jack Rowe by a causeway approximately 100 yards in length that can be walked across at high\r\ntide.&nbsp; Jack Rowe Island currently has five docks connected to it.&nbsp; Similar to Jack Rowe Island, Little Jack Rowe is bordered on one side by the Cooper\r\nRiver,[2] a deep saltwater tidal river which is part of the Intracoastal Waterway.&nbsp; The remaining majority of\r\nthe island is bordered by tidal marshland.\r\nDyer, the previous owner of the island, held a dock permit approved by OCRM, which expired on May 12, 2005, four months prior to Respondent's purchase of the\r\nisland.&nbsp; Respondent planned to build a house on the island, and the only convenient way to access the island is by mooring a boat to a dock.&nbsp; On\r\nNovember 7, 2005, Respondent submitted a critical area permit application to OCRM, seeking to construct a dock from Little Jack Rowe to the Cooper River.&nbsp;\r\nOn November 29, 2005, OCRM forwarded the application to the AG's office.\r\nOn July 19, 2006, Respondent's attorney contacted the AG's office by letter, seeking to discern the AG's position regarding the dock permit and requesting\r\nthe AG either approve or deny the application.&nbsp; The AG's office responded by letter stating that Respondent must produce a sovereign grant covering Little\r\nJack Rowe in order that the office may review the application.&nbsp;\r\nBy Complaint dated February 27, 2007, Respondent brought this action to quiet title to Little Jack Rowe, in addition to several other causes of action. Each\r\nparty submitted Motions for Summary Judgment, and the master denied each of these motions following a hearing, with the exception that the master ordered OCRM\r\nto either grant or deny Respondent's permit application.&nbsp; On March 26, 2008, DHEC issued Respondent a letter denying her permit application.\r\nAfter trial and oral argument, the master issued an Order granting judgment for the Respondent on the ground that Little Jack Rowe is not a marsh island\r\nunder Coburg, that Respondent was entitled to quieted title under the forty year statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-380 (2005), that the Federal Tax\r\nCertificate of 1865 represented a sovereign's grant, and that Respondent qualified for a dock permit under section 48-39-140 of the South Carolina Code and\r\naccompanying regulations.&nbsp; This case is before the Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nIssue\r\nI.&nbsp; Whether Respondent holds fee simple title to Little Jack Rowe Island.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis action was commenced as both a quiet title action and a request for declaratory judgment.&nbsp; Typically, an action to remove a cloud on and quiet\r\ntitle to land is one in equity.&nbsp; Cathcart v. Jennings, 137 S.C. 450, 135 S.E. 558, 562 (1926).&nbsp; However, &quot;when the defendant's answer\r\nraises an issue of paramount title to land, such as would, if established, defeat the plaintiff's action, the issue of title is legal.&quot; &nbsp;Dargan v.\r\nTankersley, 380 S.C. 480, 483, 671 S.E.2d 73, 74 (2008).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;Declaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable and, therefore, the standard of review depends on the nature of the underlying\r\nissues.&quot; Judy v. Martin, 381 S.C. 455, 458, 674 S.E.2d 136, 141 (2009).&nbsp; In this case, the Court must determine the reach of its prior case\r\nlaw.&nbsp; Thus, this is an action at law.&nbsp; In an action at law tried before a master, the appellate court &quot;will affirm the master's factual findings\r\nif there is any evidence in the record which reasonably supports them.&quot;&nbsp; Query v. Burgess, 371 S.C. 407, 410, 639 S.E.2d 455, 456&nbsp;(Ct.\r\nApp. 2006).&nbsp; However, &quot;[a]n appellate court may determine questions of law with no particular deference to the trial court.&quot;&nbsp; Verenes v.\r\nAlvanos, 387 S.C. 11, 14, 690 S.E.2d 771, 772-73 (2010).\r\nAnalysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Title to Little Jack Rowe Island\r\nAppellants argue the master erred in finding Little Jack Rowe was not subject to a presumption of State ownership, as set forth in Coburg.&nbsp; After\r\nmuch consideration, we take this opportunity to overturn the specific holding of Coburg that &quot;[t]itle to islands situate within marshland follows\r\ntitle to the marshland.&quot; Coburg II, 318 S.C. at 513, 458 S.E.2d at 548.&nbsp;\r\nIn Coburg I, Lesser received a permit from the South Carolina Coastal Council to construct a walkway and floating dock on marshland that contained two\r\nsmall islands, Glass Island and Small Island.&nbsp; Coburg I, 309 S.C. at 253, 422 S.E.2d at 97.&nbsp; These islands were bordered on one side by the\r\nWappoo Creek, a navigable tidal stream on the Intracoastal Waterway, and on the remaining sides by marshland.&nbsp; Coburg brought an action to quiet title to\r\nthe marshland and islands, claiming ownership pursuant to a 1967 deed which traced back to a 1703 grant from the Lords Proprietors to Robert Gibbes.&nbsp; Coburg\r\nII, 318 S.C. at 512, 458 S.E.2d at 548.&nbsp; After reciting the established principle that &quot;[p]resumption of title to marshland rests in the State of\r\nSouth Carolina, to be held in trust for the benefit of the public,&quot; Coburg I, 309 S.C. at 253, 422 S.E.2d at 97, this Court followed, stating\r\n&quot;ownership of islands situate within marshland follows ownership of the marshland.&quot;&nbsp; Id. (comparing with McCullough v. Wall,\r\n4 Rich. 68, 53 Am. Dec. 715 (1850)).&nbsp; This Court remanded the case so the State could be added as a party.&nbsp; Id. at 255, 422 S.E.2d at 98.\r\nIn Coburg II, this Court found the Lord Proprietors grant upon which Coburg relied did not contain specific language showing the intent to convey land\r\nbelow the high water mark of Wappoo Creek.&nbsp; Coburg II, 318 S.C. at 513, 458 S.E.2d at 548.&nbsp; This Court then repeated its statement from Coburg\r\nI that &quot;[t]itle to islands situate within marshland follows title to the marshland;&quot; ultimately concluding the marshland and the islands in\r\nquestion belonged to the State.&nbsp; Id.\r\nUnder the public trust doctrine, the State holds presumptive title to tidal land below the high water mark to be held in trust for the benefit of all people\r\nof South Carolina.&nbsp; McQueen v. S.C. Coastal Council, 354 S.C. 142, 149, 580 S.E.2d 116, 119 (2003); State v. Pacific Guano Co., 22 S.C. 50,\r\n84 (1884).&nbsp; In areas subject to the public trust doctrine, presumption of State ownership &quot;may be overcome only by showing a specific grant from the\r\nsovereign which is strictly construed against the grantee.&quot;&nbsp; McQueen, 354 S.C. at n.6, 580 S.E.2d at n.6.\r\nThe proposition that the public trust doctrine extends to lands above the high water mark first appeared in Coburg I, 309 S.C. at 253, 422 S.E.2d at\r\n97.&nbsp; The proposition was supported by a comparison citation to McCullough v. Wall, 4 Rich. At 68, 53 Am.Dec. at 715, which involved a dispute over\r\nthe ownership of a fishing rock located in the Catawba River.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The defendant in that case argued if the area of the river surrounding the\r\nrock was navigable by boat, the fishing rock was for the enjoyment of the public.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; However, if this area was non-navigable, the plaintiff,\r\nwho allegedly owned the land to the west of the river, possessed title to the rock under the principle of medium filum aquoe, which imposes an imaginary\r\nproperty line at the center of the river.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; This Court found the plaintiff owned the rock pursuant to his deed to the bordering riparian\r\nland.&nbsp; In dicta this Court stated, â€œ[i]slands in rivers fall under the same rule as to the ownership of the soil and its incidents as the soil under\r\nwater does.â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nWe decide today that neither the facts, nor the holding of McCullough v. Wall offer a substantial enough foundation for the principle propounded in Coburg.&nbsp;\r\nImportantly, McCullough involved riparian rights.&nbsp; McCullough, 4 Rich. At 68, 53 Am.Dec. at 715.&nbsp; This Court has long recognized that\r\nriparian property rights differ from the rights of landowners subject to the ebb and flow of tides.&nbsp; See State v. Pacific Guano Co., 22 S.C.\r\nat 79 (&quot;It is a settled principle of the English law that the right of owners of land bounded by the sea or on navigable rivers where the tide ebbs and\r\nflows, extends to high water mark . . . . But grants of land bounded on rivers . . . carry the exclusive right and title of the grantee to the centre of the\r\nstreamâ€).&nbsp; The brief statement in Coburg that title to marsh islands follows title to the surrounding marsh has not been subsequently\r\napplied by this States' courts to quiet title in the State.&nbsp; Instead, our jurisprudence has continued to reflect the longstanding principle that the public\r\ntrust doctrine extends only up to the land below the high water mark.&nbsp; See State v. Fain, 273 S.C. 748, 752, 259 S.E.2d 606, 608 (1979) (to prove\r\nits case that it owned certain lands, the State provided photographic evidence that the disputed land was covered by normal high tide); see also State v.\r\nHardee, 259 S.C. 535, 543, 193 S.E.2d 497, 501 (1972) (&quot;In the absence of specific language, either in the deed or on the plat, showing that it was\r\nintended to go below high water mark, the portion of the land between high and low water mark remains in the State in trust for the benefit of the\r\npublic&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nThe principle that the State is unqualifiedly the presumptive owner of all marsh islands situated in state-owned marsh appears to be unique to South\r\nCarolina.&nbsp; In limited instances, some states have found islands to be state-owned based on a lack of permanence.&nbsp; See Giles v. Basore, 154 Tex.\r\n366, 374, 278 S.W.2d 830, 835 (1955) (islands formed in river by deposits of silt, soil, and logs that were not in existence at time land was granted is\r\nproperty of the owner of that area at the time it was granted, in that case the state); see also Mulry v. Norton, 55 Sickels 424, 432, 3 N.E. 581, __\r\n(N.Y. 1885) (&quot;if marine increase be by small and almost imperceptible degrees, it goes to the owner of the land; but if it be sudden and considerable it\r\nbelongs to the sovereign&quot;).&nbsp; In Coburg, the islands in question were described in Coburg's predecessor's deeds since 1843 and appeared on plats\r\nsince at least 1853.&nbsp; Coburg, Inc. v. Lesser, No. 90-CP-10-2034R (S.C. Ct. Com. Pl. Mar. 13, 1991).&nbsp; Thus, the Coburg principle was not\r\npremised on permanence.&nbsp; We decline to diminish the bright line of the public trust doctrine with a test that requires case by case determination.&nbsp;\r\nCoastal lands are notoriously subject to the volatility of changing tides, erosion, and accretion.&nbsp; Landowners and potential landowners are well aware of\r\nthe long-standing principle that the State is presumptive owner of lands below the high water mark.&nbsp; Accordingly, a person who possesses title to land\r\nespecially vulnerable to this volatility takes title with the knowledge their land is at risk of loss to the State by natural forces.\r\nOther grounds by which this Court might narrow the reach of Coburg are similarly flawed.&nbsp; The master in this case found the Coburg\r\nprinciple did not apply to Little Jack Rowe for two reasons: (1) the physical characteristics of the islands differed; and (2) Respondent in this case held a\r\nspecific title to Little Jack Rowe, whereas in Coburg, there was no evidence of a specific deed or history of record title for the small islands.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough we recognize the master's effort to reach an equitable solution, in our view, an attempt to limit Coburg, either by physical characteristic or\r\ntitle history, will sacrifice clarity and uniformity for the sake of stare decisis.&nbsp;\r\nThe master found Little Jack Rowe was not &quot;situate within marshland&quot; because it is located on the Cooper River.&nbsp; In our view this is a\r\ndistinction without a difference because both the Coburg islands and Little Jack Rowe are bordered by navigable waterways on the Intracoastal\r\nWaterway.&nbsp; Therefore, when this Court established the principle that the State is the presumed owner of marsh islands, it did not intend to limit that\r\npresumption only to islands completely surrounded by marshland.&nbsp;\r\nThe master additionally distinguished the islands by size, stating the Coburg islands were insubstantial &quot;marsh hummocks,&quot;[3] while Little Jack Rowe is a substantial island of more than fifteen acres.[4]&nbsp;\r\nBased on the definition given hammocks by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (DNR),[5] both the Coburg\r\nislands and Little Jack Rowe are considered hammock islands.&nbsp; For clarity, we believe marsh hammocks to be the technical term for &quot;islands situate\r\nwithin marshland,&quot; Coburg II, 318 S.C. at 513, 458 S.E.2d at 548.&nbsp; Because marsh hammocks can vastly vary in size,[6] the State and its courts cannot practically and uniformly apply the presumption of State ownership theory based on an island's\r\nsize.&nbsp; In our view, an attempt to confine Coburg to include only &quot;smaller&quot; hammocks would arbitrarily extend the public trust doctrine and\r\nwould likely cloud titles of thousands of coastal islands.[7]\r\nLastly, the master distinguished the Coburg islands by noting those islands lacked a specific deed or history of record title.&nbsp; In Coburg,\r\nCoburg's deed description included the two islands; however, the sovereign grant upon which Coburg relied, did not include a specific description of those\r\nislands. Coburg II, 318 S.C. at 512, 458 S.E.2d at 548.&nbsp; This case presents a similar factual scenario, as Respondent's deed described Little Jack\r\nRowe, but the Federal Tax Certificate upon which Respondent relied did not specifically describe the island.&nbsp; Therefore, this is another distinction\r\nwithout a difference.&nbsp; It is common for ancient coastal deeds to convey groups of islands, without mention of specific island names.&nbsp; It is equally\r\ncommon for these islandsâ€™ names to have changed over time.&nbsp; In our view, narrowing Coburg on the ground the State is the presumptive owner of\r\nmarsh islands whose sovereign grant lacks a specific description of the island claimed would cloud title to a vast number of marsh islands in this State, many\r\ncontaining homes, businesses, and infrastructure.[8]\r\nIn sum, the jurisprudence of this State is consistent that &quot;[p]resumption of title to marshland rests in the State of South Carolina, to be held in\r\ntrust for the benefit of the public.&quot;&nbsp; Coburg I, 309 S.C. at 253, 422 S.E.2d at 97.&nbsp; However, the proposition that the State is the\r\npresumed owner of land that remains above the high water mark is at odds with coastal property jurisprudence that predated Coburg, and expands the public\r\ntrust doctrine beyond its historic bounds.&nbsp; Of the 3,467 coastal islands in South Carolina, the DNR estimates that 72% of these are privately owned.&nbsp;\r\nWe do not see a practical and uniform way to narrow the scope of Coburg without clouding the title of potentially thousands of marsh islands.[9] &nbsp;&nbsp;We do not underestimate the importance of these islands as the vestiges of our State's most fragile\r\necosystems, and we recognize the State's interest in protecting and preserving these lands for the enjoyment of all citizens.&nbsp; DHEC and other agencies of\r\nthis State have the regulatory authority to prevent or limit the development of our State's pristine coastal areas, and our opinion today leaves them at liberty\r\nto continue those efforts.&nbsp; Current and potential marsh island owners should be keenly aware of this regulatory risk.&nbsp; However, we do not believe the\r\nprotection and preservation of these islands should be effected through the unprecedented expansion of the public trust doctrine. Therefore, we overrule the\r\nspecific principle found in the Coburg cases that &quot;ownership of islands situate within marshland follows ownership of the marshland.&quot; Coburg\r\nI, 309 S.C. at 253, 422 S.E.2d at 97.\r\nConclusion\r\nAppellants raised the additional issues of whether the master erred in declaring Respondent's forty years of record title defeated the state's presumption of\r\ntitle, finding the 1865 Federal Tax Certificate represented a sovereign grant, and addressing permitting issues that were not before the court.&nbsp; In light\r\nof our disposition of this case, we do not find it necessary to address these remaining issues.&nbsp; Futch v. McCallister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999).&nbsp; Today we overturn the specific holding of the Coburg cases that &quot;[t]itle to islands situate\r\nwithin marshland follows title to the marshland.&quot;&nbsp; Coburg II, 318 S.C. at 513, 458 S.E.2d at 548.&nbsp; Therefore, we quiet title to Little\r\nJack Rowe island in favor of Respondent.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

The\r\nDNR Report reveals the majority of marsh hammocks are very smallâ€”53.7% are less than one acre and 81.5% are less than five acres.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\n[7] South Carolina has &quot;approximately 3,467 coastal islands, not including the larger â€˜Sea\r\nIslandsâ€™ such as Hilton Head.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[8] Developed marsh islands include many of the marsh islands in the Folly and Kiawah regions, for example.&nbsp; Id.\r\n[9] Currently, DHEC requires a sovereign's grant for only undeveloped marsh islands.&nbsp; Although DHEC has\r\nchosen to apply the Coburg principle sparingly, without modification, there is little to preclude DHEC, or any other state entity, from extending the\r\npresumption of state ownership to all 3,467 marsh islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of George E.
