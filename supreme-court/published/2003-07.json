Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nElizabeth Van Doren Gray, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand.  Respondent has also resigned \r\n  his judicial position and has agreed never to apply for a judicial office in \r\n  South Carolina without permission from the Supreme Court of South Carolina.  \r\n  We accept the agreement and publicly reprimand respondent, the most severe sanction \r\n  we are able to impose under these circumstances.  The facts as set forth in \r\n  the agreement are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nOn June 12, 2002, respondent was arrested in connection \r\n  with cocaine found in his possession. \r\n  [1]   Respondent pled guilty on November 14, 2002, to two counts of possession \r\n  of cocaine and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, suspended upon payment \r\n  of a fine and service of two years of  probation, with conditions for substance \r\n  abuse counseling and random drug testing.  At the time of the commission of \r\n  the criminal acts admitted in the guilty plea, respondent was serving as a Sumter \r\n  County Magistrate.  Subsequent to his arrest, respondent resigned his judicial \r\n  position and his resignation was accepted by the Governor of South Carolina.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that these allegations constitute grounds \r\n  for discipline pursuant to Rules 7(a)(1) and (3), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.  Respondent \r\n  also admits that he has violated the following provisions of the Code of Judicial \r\n  Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:  Canon 1 (a judge shall uphold the integrity and independence \r\n  of the judiciary); Canon 2 (a judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance \r\n  of impropriety in all of the judge's activities); Canon 2(A)(a judge shall respect \r\n  and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes \r\n  public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); and Canon \r\n  4(A)(2)(a judge shall conduct his extra-judicial activities so that they do \r\n  not demean the judicial office).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe accept the agreement for a public reprimand because respondent is no longer \r\n  a magistrate and because he has agreed not to hereafter seek nor accept another \r\n  judicial position in South Carolina without first obtaining permission from \r\n  this Court. [2]   As previously \r\n  noted, this is the strongest punishment we can give respondent, given the fact \r\n  that he has already resigned his duties as a magistrate.  See In re \r\n  Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996)(&quot;A public reprimand is \r\n  the most severe sanction that can be imposed when the respondent no longer holds \r\n  judicial office.&quot;)  Accordingly, respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded \r\n  for his conduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  By orders of this Court dated June 17, 2002, respondent, \r\n    who is licensed to practice law in this state, was placed on interim suspension \r\n    with regard to his judicial position and the practice of law.

In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to a two year suspension from the practice of \r\n  law, retroactive to June 17, 2002, the date he was placed on interim suspension. [1]   We accept the agreement and \r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law for two years.  The facts, as set \r\n  forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nOn June 12, 2002, respondent was arrested in connection \r\n  with cocaine found in his possession.  Respondent pled guilty on November 14, \r\n  2002, to two counts of possession of cocaine and was sentenced to two years' \r\n  imprisonment, suspended upon payment of a fine and service of two years of  \r\n  probation, with conditions for substance abuse counseling and random drug testing.  \r\n  At the time of the commission of the criminal acts admitted in the guilty plea, \r\n  respondent was serving as a Sumter County Magistrate.  Subsequent to his arrest, \r\n  respondent resigned his judicial position and his resignation was accepted by \r\n  the Governor of South Carolina.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 8.4(a)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer \r\n  to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness \r\n  or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); and Rule 8.4(e)(it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration \r\n  of justice).  In addition, respondent admits that his actions constitute grounds \r\n  for discipline under the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary \r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4)(it \r\n  shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to be convicted of a crime of \r\n  moral turpitude or a serious crime); and Rule 7(a)(5)(it shall be a ground for \r\n  discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration \r\n  of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or \r\n  conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find a two year suspension is the appropriate sanction \r\n  for respondent's misconduct.  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for two years, retroactive \r\n  to the date of his interim suspension.  Respondent shall not be eligible for \r\n  reinstatement until he has successfully completed all conditions of his sentence, \r\n  including, but not limited to, any period of probation.  Rule 33(f)(10), RLDE.  \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In re Curtis, 350 S.C. 277, 565 S.E.2d \r\n    309 (2002).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25675","title":"Lydia v.

Outten, John Patrick Riordan, both of Leatherwood Walker Todd &amp; \r\n  Mann, of Greenville, for Petitioner.\r\nAndrew C. Barr, of Fulton &amp; Barr, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  We granted certiorari to review the Court \r\n  of Appealsâ€™ determination that Petitioner is liable on a first party negligent \r\n  entrustment claim because he allowed an intoxicated person to borrow his car.  \r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nAccording to the Complaint, Respondent, \r\n  Mitchell Lydia (â€œLydiaâ€), was intoxicated on April 27, 1995, when Petitioner, \r\n  Steve Horton (â€œHortonâ€), allowed Lydia to borrow his car.  Lydiaâ€™s Complaint \r\n  alleges that Horton either knew or should have known that Lydia was not competent \r\n  to operate the vehicle.  Lydia then drove the car in his intoxicated state and \r\n  wrecked the vehicle in a single-car accident that rendered him a quadriplegic.  \r\n\r\nLydia brought an action against Horton for first \r\n  party negligent entrustment.  The trial court granted Hortonâ€™s motion for judgment \r\n  on the pleadings holding that Lydiaâ€™s admitted negligence precluded any recovery \r\n  on his part because, under South Carolinaâ€™s modified comparative negligence \r\n  system, his negligence outweighed Hortonâ€™s negligence.  The Court of Appeals \r\n  reversed and remanded, holding that a first party negligence claim can be brought \r\n  in this state.  Lydia v. Horton, 343 S.C. 376, 540 S.E.2d 102 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000). \r\nThis Court granted Hortonâ€™s \r\n  petition for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals decision.  Horton raises \r\n  the following issue on appeal: \r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in recognizing a first \r\n  party negligent entrustment cause of action brought by an adult who was intoxicated \r\n  when injured?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nHorton argues that the \r\n  Court of Appeals erred in adopting a first party negligent entrustment cause \r\n  of action asserted by an intoxicated party.  We agree.\r\nWhether South Carolina recognizes a first \r\n  party negligent entrustment claim is a novel question of law.  In finding that \r\n  this state should recognize the cause of action, the Court of Appeals adopted \r\n  the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 308 and 390 (1965).\r\nSection 308 provides:\r\n\r\nIt is negligence to permit a third person to use a thing \r\n  or to engage in an activity which is under the control of the actor, if the \r\n  actor knows or should know that such person intends or is likely to use the \r\n  thing or to conduct himself in the activity in such a manner as to create an \r\n  unreasonable risk of harm to others.\r\n\r\nSection 390 provides:\r\n\r\nOne who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel \r\n  for the use of another whom the supplier knows or has reason to know to be likely \r\n  because of his youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to use it in a manner involving \r\n  unreasonable risk of physical harm to himself and others whom the supplier should \r\n  expect to share in or be endangered by its use, is subject to liability for \r\n  physical harm resulting to them.\r\n\r\nWe conclude that the policy considerations which support \r\n  the legal theory of third party negligent entrustment are undermined by applying \r\n  them to a first party cause of action.  The Restatement provides seven illustrations \r\n  of when a negligent entrustment claim arises.  Only one illustration, Illustration \r\n  7, refers to a first party claim, and we do not believe that a pure first party \r\n  claim can be extrapolated from the illustration. [1]   The example involves a lessee/lessor \r\n  relationship where a third-party is injured, which is not analogous to the facts \r\n  of this case.  \r\n We hold that Lydia cannot recover on a first party \r\n  negligent entrustment cause of action for two reasons: (1) South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  modified comparative negligence scheme would bar recovery for this type of claim, \r\n  and (2) public policy considerations addressed by this Court in Tobias v. \r\n  Sports Club, Inc., 332 S.C. 90, 504 S.E.2d 318 (1998).  \r\nModified Comparative Negligence System\r\nIn South Carolina, a plaintiff is barred from \r\n  recovery if his negligence outweighs the defendantâ€™s.  Nelson v. Concrete \r\n  Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783 (1991).  We believe that this stateâ€™s \r\n  modified comparative negligence system also bars an intoxicated adultâ€™s recovery \r\n  on a first party negligent entrustment cause of action.  We cannot imagine how \r\n  one could be more than fifty percent negligent in loaning his car to an intoxicated \r\n  adult who subsequently injured himself. \r\n  [2]  We agree with the trial judge that Lydiaâ€™s admission that he was â€œappreciably \r\n  impairedâ€ and that he lost control of the vehicle supports only one conclusion, \r\n  that Lydiaâ€™s negligence exceeded Hortonâ€™s.  See Creech v. South Carolina \r\n  Wildlife &amp; Marine Resources Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997) \r\n  (if the evidence supports only one conclusion, then the comparative fault of \r\n  the plaintiff and defendant becomes a question of law for the trial judge).\r\nPublic Policy\r\nEven in a situation where comparative negligence \r\n  would not bar a claim for negligent entrustment, South Carolinaâ€™s public policy \r\n  prohibits a first party negligent entrustment action under this factual scenario.  \r\n  The public policy considerations which govern our decision as to whether to \r\n  allow civil suits based on negligent entrustment grow out of South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  regulation of the sale of alcohol.\r\nSouth Carolina first criminalized the sale of \r\n  alcohol to an intoxicated person in 1874.  The state had no statutorily or judicially \r\n  imposed civil liability. Nationally, in this era, many states were adopting \r\n  â€œdram shop laws,â€ imposing civil liability on tavern owners for injuries caused \r\n  by intoxicated patrons to whom the tavern owner had sold alcohol.  Meanwhile, \r\n  in 1909, South Carolina enacted total prohibition, 10 years before federal Prohibition \r\n  was adopted. The federal Prohibition amendment was repealed in 1933. Although \r\n  alcohol sales were also legalized in South Carolina in 1933, this state did \r\n  not permit full-blown sale of liquor by the drink until 1973. [3]  Nationally, after Prohibition ended, many states with a more \r\n  developed system of legalized bars began to repeal their dram shop laws.  \r\n  [4] \r\nAt common law in American courts, a tavern owner \r\n  could not be held civilly liable for injuries caused by an over served, intoxicated \r\n  patron.  With the repeal of dram shop laws in all but 18 states, the majority \r\n  of states did not impose liability upon tavern owners. [5]   In the 1950s, several state \r\n  supreme courts began to develop a theory of tavern owner civil liability based \r\n  on violations of state criminal statutes forbidding the serving of alcohol to \r\n  intoxicated patrons. [6] \r\nBy 1987, 41 states had some form of tavern liability. [7]  South Carolinaâ€™s General Assembly did not enact a dram shop \r\n  law, but in 1985, the South Carolina Court of Appeals held that a bar ownerâ€™s \r\n  violation of the criminal statute forbidding service to intoxicated persons \r\n  could support a civil suit against the bar for injuries caused by the intoxicated \r\n  patron.  Christiansen v. Campbell, 258 S.C. 164, 328 S.E.2d 351 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985).  In Christiansen, the plaintiff was struck by an automobile \r\n  as he stepped off the curb in front of a bar where he had consumed a number \r\n  of beers.  The bar owner had continued to serve Christiansen after he became \r\n  intoxicated.  Christiansen sued the automobile driver and the bar owner.  The \r\n  Court of Appeals held that Christiansen had a private right of action against \r\n  the bar owner based on the violation of a penal statute.  The Court of Appeals \r\n  found that the statute existed both to protect the public and to protect intoxicated \r\n  persons.  Id. \r\nIn Tobias v. Sports Club, Inc., 332 S.C. 90, 504 \r\n  S.E.2d 318 (1998), this Court expressly overruled Christiansen holding \r\n  that we would not permit an intoxicated adult to bring a first party cause of \r\n  action against a tavern proprietor predicated on a violation of the dram shop \r\n  statutes.  This Court stated, â€œpublic policy is not served by allowing the intoxicated \r\n  adult patron to maintain a suit for injuries which result from his own conduct.â€ \r\n  Id. at 90, 504 S.E.2d at 320.  Our Court noted that its decision did \r\n  not preclude a third party from bringing a cause of action under the statutes.  \r\n  Id. at 90, 504 S.E.2d at 319.     \r\n We apply these same public policy considerations \r\n  to this case.  We disagree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion that Tobias \r\n  public policy considerations only have bearing in comparing fault but have no \r\n  bearing on whether or not to impose an outright bar to a first party negligent \r\n  entrustment cause of action.  The essence of this case and the Tobias \r\n  case are the same, for in both cases, the plaintiff, who was voluntarily intoxicated \r\n  when the accident occurred, is attempting to deflect the responsibility that \r\n  should be imposed upon himself towards another.  Just as this plaintiff cannot \r\n  bring a first party cause of action to challenge the discretionary conduct of \r\n  the tavern owner, he cannot bring the same action to challenge the discretionary \r\n  conduct of his entrustor.       \r\nConclusion\r\nWe REVERSE the Court of Appeals and conclude that \r\n  Lydiaâ€™s first party negligent entrustment claim is barred because his negligence \r\n  outweighed Hortonâ€™s and because of the public policy considerations we set forth \r\n  in Tobias.  We also decline to adopt sections 308 and 390 of the Restatement \r\n  based on this set of facts.  \r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring \r\n  in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I concur in the result reached by the\r\nmajority, but would ground the decision solely in public policy.  I write separately \r\n  because I am not willing to hold, as the majority does, that in all events the \r\n  fault of the entrustor is outweighed by the fault of the intoxicated adult.  \r\n  I would hold only that public policy precludes a voluntarily intoxicated adult \r\n  from bringing such a first party negligent entrustment action.  \r\n BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] The Restatement provides the following illustrations:\r\n  1. A gives a loaded gun \r\n    to B, a feeble-minded girl of ten, to be carried by her to C. While B is carrying \r\n    the gun she tampers with the trigger and discharges it, harming C. A is subject \r\n    to liability to C. \r\n  2. A permits B, a boy of \r\n    ten, who has never previously driven a motor car, to drive his motor car on \r\n    an errand of B's own. B drives the car carelessly, to the injury of C. A is \r\n    subject to liability to C. \r\n  3. A permits B, his chauffeur, \r\n    who to his knowledge is in the habit of driving at an excessive speed, to \r\n    use his car to take B's family to the seashore. While driving the car for \r\n    this purpose, B drives at an excessive rate of speed and harms C. A is subject \r\n    to liability to C. \r\n  4. A lends his car to his \r\n    friend B for B to use to drive a party of friends to a country club dance. \r\n    A knows that B has habitually become intoxicated at such dances. On the particular \r\n    occasion B becomes intoxicated and while in that condition recklessly drives \r\n    the car into the carefully driven car of C, and causes harm to him. A is subject \r\n    to liability to C. \r\n  5. A rents an automobile \r\n    to B, a young man who announces his purpose to drive it from Boston to New \r\n    York on a bet that he will do so in three hours. A is subject to liability \r\n    if the excessive speed at which the car is driven causes harm to travelers \r\n    on the highway. \r\n  6. A sells or gives an automobile \r\n    to B, his adult son, knowing that B is an epileptic, but that B nevertheless \r\n    intends to drive the car. While B is driving he suffers an epileptic seizure, \r\n    loses control of the car, and injures C. A is subject to liability to C.\r\n  7. A, who makes a business \r\n    of letting out boats for hire, rents his boat to B and C, who are obviously \r\n    so intoxicated as to make it likely that they will mismanage the boat so as \r\n    to capsize it or to collide with other boats. B and C by their drunken mismanagement \r\n    collide with the boat of D, upsetting both boats. B, C, and D are drowned. \r\n    A is subject to liability to the estates of B, C, and D under the death statute, \r\n    although the estates of B and C may also be liable for the death of D.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Comment C to section 390 explains the interplay \r\n    between the theory of negligent entrustment and the contributory and comparative \r\n    negligence defenses:\r\n  c. The rule stated in this Section sets out the conditions \r\n    under which a supplier of a chattel is subject to liability.  As always this \r\n    phrase denotes that a supplier is liable if, but only if, his conduct is the \r\n    legal cause of the bodily harm complained of and if the person suffering \r\n    the harm is not subject to any defense such as contributory negligence, \r\n    which will prevent him from recovering damages therefore.  One who accepts \r\n    and uses a chattel knowing that he is incompetent to use it safely or who \r\n    associates himself in the use of a chattel by one whom he knows to be so incompetent, \r\n    or one who is himself careless in the use of the chattel after receiving it, \r\n    is usually in such contributory fault as to bar recovery.  If, however, \r\n    the person to whom the chattel is supplied is one of a class which is legally \r\n    recognized as so incompetent as to prevent them from being responsible for \r\n    their actions, the supplier may be liable for harm suffered by him, as when \r\n    a loaded gun is entrusted to a child of tender years.  So too, if the supplier \r\n    knows that the condition of the person to whom the chattel is supplied is \r\n    such as to make him incapable of exercising the care which it is reasonable \r\n    to expect of a normal sober adult, the supplier may be liable for harm sustained \r\n    by the incompetent although such person deals with it in a way which may render \r\n    him liable to third persons who are also injured.\r\n  (emphasis added).  While the analysis in Comment C \r\n    is consistent with our position that Lydiaâ€™s first party negligent entrustment \r\n    claim is barred since his comparative fault outweighed Hortonâ€™s, we decline \r\n    to adopt the Comment or sections 308 and 390 of the Restatement based on these \r\n    facts presented.    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  1973 S.C.

James, 346 S.C. 303, 551 S.E.2d 591 (Ct. App. 2001).   \r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nOn the afternoon of April 5, 1997, Ramona and Richard \r\n  Granger observed Petitioner, Tommy Lee James (â€œJamesâ€), on the front porch of \r\n  the home of Edyth Richards and Frances Gilbert.  The Grangers cared for Ms. \r\n  Richards and Ms. Gilbertâ€™s lawn and knew that the ladies were not at home on \r\n  that day.  While Mrs. Granger was mowing the lawn, her husband ran several errands. [1]   When Mr. Granger returned from \r\n  the last errand, he and Mrs. Granger noticed that a bicycle was propped against \r\n  the fence.  Soon after they noticed the bicycle, they testified that they saw \r\n  James on the porch of the home. [2] \r\n  \r\nMrs. Granger asked James \r\n  if she could help him with anything. James responded that he was looking for \r\n  the â€œrent man.â€  Mrs. Granger told James there was no such man at that address.  \r\n  James continued walking off the porch to his bike and began riding away.  Mrs. \r\n  Granger checked the front door and found it was ajar.  She told her husband, \r\n  and he pursued James in his truck, and called the police from his cell phone.  \r\n  Mr. Granger testified that he lost James more than once as he followed him, \r\n  but quickly found him again each time.  Finally, James dismounted from his bike \r\n  and attempted to hide behind a tree.  Bystanders pointed James out to Mr. Granger \r\n  and helped Mr. Granger hold James until the police arrived soon thereafter.  \r\n\r\nJames had a screwdriver in his pocket and admitted \r\n  to being on Ms. Richards and Ms. Gilbertâ€™s porch, but claimed he was looking \r\n  for the â€œrent manâ€ and that he did not steal anything from the residence. [3]   Both of the Grangers identified \r\n  James at trial as the man they saw on the porch.  Additionally, a neighbor testified \r\n  that James knocked on his door the same day.  When the neighbor answered the \r\n  door, James asked whether a camper parked in the neighborâ€™s driveway was for \r\n  sale. [4]   After James left his \r\n  house, the neighbor testified that he saw James enter the gate of Ms. Richards \r\n  and Ms. Gilbertâ€™s home.\r\nJames was indicted for first-degree burglary in \r\n  violation of South Carolina Code section 16-11-311, which provides:\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if \r\n  the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime \r\n  in the dwelling, and either:\r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when, in effecting entry or while in the \r\n  dwelling or in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n    \r\n  (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive; \r\n  or\r\n  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   causes physical injury to a person who \r\n  is not a participant in the crime; or\r\n  (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uses or threatens the use of a dangerous \r\n  instrument; or\r\n  (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displays what is or appears to be a knife, \r\n  pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm; or\r\n    \r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the burglary is committed by a person \r\n  with a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking \r\n  or a combination of both.\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime. \r\n\r\n  \r\n(B) Burglary in the first degree is a felony punishable by life imprisonment.  \r\n  For purposes of this section, â€œlifeâ€ means until death.  The court in its discretion \r\n  may sentence the defendant to a term of not less than fifteen years.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (Supp. \r\n  2002) (emphasis added).  The burglary in this case was committed during the \r\n  day without a weapon.  The State based Jamesâ€™s indictment for first-degree burglary \r\n  on Jamesâ€™s prior convictions for burglary.  The State submitted certified copies \r\n  of seven of Jamesâ€™s prior convictions for burglary over Jamesâ€™s objection. [5]      \r\nJames was convicted of first-degree burglary \r\n  and sentenced to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole. [6]   The Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction \r\n  and sentence.  State v. James, 346 S.C. 303, 551 S.E.2d 591 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001).  The Court of Appeals denied Jamesâ€™s petitions for rehearing and rehearing \r\n  en banc.   This Court granted Jamesâ€™s petition for certiorari to address \r\n  the following issue:\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in upholding the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision to allow evidence of seven prior burglary convictions pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2) when that statute only requires the State \r\n  to establish two prior burglary convictions?\r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\nJames argues that the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow evidence of seven \r\n  of Jamesâ€™s prior burglary convictions.  We agree.\r\nThe admission of evidence is left to the \r\n  discretion of the trial judge, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an \r\n  abuse of discretion by the trial judge.  Carlyle v. Tuomey Hosp., 305 \r\n  S.C. 187, 407 S.E.2d 630 (1991).\r\nThis Court addressed the constitutionality \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2) in State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 228 (2000).  In Benton, the defendant offered to stipulate \r\n  that he had two prior burglary convictions in lieu of the State introducing \r\n  evidence of the burglary convictions.  Id.  The State refused to accept \r\n  the stipulation, and the trial judge declined to require the State to accept \r\n  it based on the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in State v. Hamilton, 327 \r\n  S.C. 440, 486 S.E.2d 512 (Ct. App. 1997) (upholding trial courtâ€™s refusal to \r\n  accept defendantâ€™s offer to stipulate to two prior convictions for purposes \r\n  of section 16-11-311(A)(2) in lieu of prosecutionâ€™s introduction of evidence \r\n  of the two prior convictions). [7]   Benton, 338 S.C. at 154, 526 S.E.2d at 229.  \r\n  The Benton Court agreed that the State could not be forced to accept \r\n  the defendantâ€™s stipulation, and thereby affirmed Hamilton and upheld \r\n  the validity of section 16-11-311(A)(2).  Id. at 155, 526 S.E.2d at 230.\r\nIn upholding section 16-11-311(A)(2), the Benton \r\n  Court discussed the impact of Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. \r\n  172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997).  In Old Chief, the defendant \r\n  was charged with three crimes:  (1) assault with a dangerous weapon, (2) using \r\n  a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and (3) violation of 18 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 922(g)(1) (possession of a firearm by anyone with a prior felony conviction).  \r\n  Id.  In Old Chief, the prosecution relied on the defendantâ€™s prior \r\n  indictment for â€œassault causing serious bodily injuryâ€ to establish a violation \r\n  of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 922(g)(1), and introduced the order of judgment and commitment \r\n  for the defendantâ€™s prior assault conviction.  Id.  The Supreme Court \r\n  found that, although relevant under Rule 402, FRE, the evidence of the \r\n  name and nature of the crime was unnecessary to prove the gun charge, and was \r\n  highly prejudicial to the defendant as it was similar to the current assault \r\n  charges pending against the defendant. Id.  Weighing the probative value \r\n  of the name and nature of the crime against its prejudicial impact, the Court \r\n  held that introducing these details was unduly prejudicial under Rule 403, FRE.  \r\n  Id.  The Court found that the defendantâ€™s admission that he committed \r\n  a qualifying crime to be sufficient for purposes of proving a violation of 18 \r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 922(g)(1) under these circumstances. \r\n  [8]   Id.  \r\nIn Benton, this Court applied Rule 403, \r\n  SCRE, and concluded that the â€œprobative value of admitting the defendantâ€™s prior \r\n  burglary and/or housebreaking convictions is not outweighed by its prejudicial \r\n  effect.â€  338 S.C. at 156, 526 S.E.2d at 230.  Through this statement we recognized \r\n  the potential for improper conviction resulting from the introduction of a defendantâ€™s \r\n  prior burglary convictions under section 16-11-311(A)(2).  We even established \r\n  steps for the trial judge to take to avoid such an improper conviction:\r\n\r\n[t]o ensure a defendant is not convicted on an improper \r\n  basis while allowing the State to prove the elements of first-degree burglary, \r\n  the trial court should limit the evidence to the prior burglary and/or housebreaking \r\n  convictions as it did here.  Particular information regarding the prior crimes \r\n  should not be admitted.  Additionally, the trial court, as it did here, should, \r\n  on request, instruct the jury on the limited purpose for which the prior crime \r\n  evidence can be considered.\r\n\r\nId. at 156, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  at 231.\r\nIn Benton, the \r\n  State offered evidence of two prior convictions, the minimum number required \r\n  by section 16-11-311(A)(2) to establish first-degree burglary.  Thus, our Courtâ€™s \r\n  statement that the probative value of the defendantâ€™s prior convictions is not \r\n  outweighed by their prejudicial effect was specific to that factual scenario.  \r\n  We recognized the interplay of Rule 403 and section 16-11-311(A)(2) in Benton, \r\n  and after conducting a Rule 403 analysis, found introduction of the two prior \r\n  convictions to be more probative than prejudicial.  \r\nIn this case, the trial court \r\n  did not weigh the probative value of the seven prior convictions against their \r\n  prejudicial impact.  The trial judge expressed dislike for the structure of \r\n  the statute generally, and gave appropriate limiting instructions to the jury, \r\n  but he did not conduct a Rule 403 balancing analysis.  The trial judge had reservations \r\n  about the propriety of admitting seven convictions, but was compelled to follow \r\n  existing precedent in the absence of any direction from this Court to the contrary.  \r\n  The following discussion took place regarding the number of convictions the \r\n  State could admit:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:  You can put certified copies of his prior record in.\r\n[THE STATE]:  Okay\r\nTHE COURT:  As to two prior burglaries, is that what youâ€™re relying on? \r\n[THE STATE]:  Thereâ€™s actually, I think, about a total of ten.  And I was not \r\n  going to submit the ones that are most serious offenses.\r\nTHE COURT:  All youâ€™ve got to do is put two in.\r\n[THE STATE]:  You want me to go with a minimum of two, then?\r\nTHE COURT:  Pick any two you want, as long as they qualify.\r\n[THE STATE]:  Well, it says two or more, so I thought about admitting them all.  \r\n  If you prefer, I understand.\r\nTHE COURT:  I think that is a little bit of a problem.  I mean -\r\n[THE STATE]:  Okay.  I realize - Iâ€™ll submit two.\r\nTHE COURT:  Well, letâ€™s see how you do.  Two or more.  Are  you talking about \r\n  burglaries, Mr. Seay?\r\n[THE STATE]:  Burglaries and housebreakings.  He has both.\r\nTHE COURT:  Well, Iâ€™m not going to - [Defense Counsel], have you a position \r\n  about that?  Obviously, you donâ€™t want it?\r\n[DEFENSE]:  I would object to more than two going in.\r\nTHE COURT:  Iâ€™m going to let you put as many as you want in, because if itâ€™s \r\n  a problem with two, itâ€™s a problem with ten.\r\n[DEFENSE]:  Then Iâ€™d like to know which ones heâ€™s putting in.\r\nTHE COURT:  Show him which ones youâ€™re going to offer.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  upheld the trial courtâ€™s decision on the ground that section 16-11-311(A)(2) \r\n  does not limit the number of prior convictions and specifically states that \r\n  evidence of â€œtwo or moreâ€ convictions will satisfy the statute.  James, \r\n  346 S.C. 303, 551 S.E.2d at 591.  The Court of Appeals placed great weight \r\n  on the â€œtwo or moreâ€ language in the statute, reasoning that â€œhad the \r\n  General Assembly intended to limit the use of prior convictions the State may \r\n  use to two in order to prevent the possibility of undue prejudice to the defendant, \r\n  it could have easily done so.â€  Id. at 309, 551 S.E.2d at 593.  The Court \r\n  of Appeals found that the trial judge had avoided prejudice in this case by \r\n  â€œinstructing the jury to limit its consideration of Jamesâ€™ convictions to the \r\n  particular purpose for which the convictions were offered.â€  Id. at 309, \r\n  551 S.E.2d at 594 (citing Benton; Hamilton).\r\nIn a concurring opinion, \r\n  Judge Shuler agreed with the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm, but wrote separately \r\n  to express his view that the admissibility of prior convictions under section \r\n  16-11-311(A)(2) should be examined in light of traditional rules of evidence.  \r\n  Id. at 310, 551 S.E.2d at 594.  Judge Shuler noted, â€œHamilton \r\n  and Benton do not dispense with the requirement that all evidence be \r\n  more probative than prejudicial.  Instead, these cases merely hold that two \r\n  prior convictions for burglary, where necessary to prove an essential element \r\n  of the crime charged, are inherently more probative than prejudicial.â€  Id. \r\n  at 310-11, 551 S.E.2d at 595.  (emphasis added).  \r\nWe agree with Judge \r\n  Shuler.  Hamilton stands for the proposition that the State cannot be \r\n  forced to accept a defendantâ€™s stipulation to prior convictions because that \r\n  would interfere with the Stateâ€™s right to prove its case with â€œevidence of its \r\n  own choosing.â€  327 S.C. at 445, 486 S.E.2d at 514 (citing Old Chief).  \r\n  Benton upheld the constitutionality of the statute as applied in Hamilton \r\n  and Benton, and found that the probative value of the two prior convictions \r\n  was not outweighed by prejudicial effect.  Nothing in Hamilton, however, \r\n  suggests that any number of prior convictions would be admissible \r\n  in a first-degree burglary prosecution.    Further, none of the relevant \r\n  authorities nullify the trial judgeâ€™s traditional role in weighing the probative \r\n  value of evidence versus its prejudicial effect or suggest that Rule 403 is \r\n  displaced by operation of section 16-11-311(A)(2).  \r\nIn our opinion, the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ observation that the General Assembly could easily have limited \r\n  the number of prior convictions the State may enter to two in order to prevent \r\n  the possibility of undue prejudice if it had so intended, ignores the judiciaryâ€™s \r\n  traditional role in determining the admissibility of evidence.  The admissibility \r\n  of prior convictions is always limited by the traditional rules of evidence.  \r\n  Accordingly, we find the probative value of Jamesâ€™s seven convictions should \r\n  have been weighed against their likely prejudicial effect under Rule 403.  In \r\n  balancing these interests, â€œâ€˜[t]he probative worth of any particular bit of \r\n  evidence is obviously affected by the scarcity or abundance of other evidence \r\n  on the same point.â€™â€ Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 185, 117 S.Ct. at 652, 136 \r\n  L.Ed.2d at 590 (quoting 22 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, Federal Practice &amp; \r\n  Procedure, Â§ 5250, pp. 546-47 (1978)).   Although the State is entitled to submit \r\n  evidence of â€œits own choosing,â€ it must do so within the confines of the established \r\n  rules of evidence.  \r\nIf the State had submitted evidence \r\n  of two of Jamesâ€™s prior burglary convictions, the jury would have had sufficient \r\n  evidence to convict James of first-degree burglary without the prejudice accompanying \r\n  admission of seven prior convictions.  Under the rule of Old Chief, the \r\n  probative value of the convictions entered beyond the two required by the statute \r\n  decreases because of the already sufficient evidence submitted to prove that \r\n  element.  Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 185, 117 S. Ct. at 652, 136 L.Ed.2d \r\n  at 590.  Although there may be rare occasions where the admission of more than \r\n  two prior burglary convictions is more probative than prejudicial and therefore \r\n  proper, the potential for undue prejudice - for the impermissible interpretation \r\n  of such evidence as propensity or character evidence - warrants great caution.  \r\n\r\nWe believe the probative value \r\n  of all seven prior convictions was outweighed by the very great potential for \r\n  prejudice to James, and crossed the line established in Old Chief, regardless \r\n  of the judgeâ€™s limiting instructions to the contrary.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  we REVERSE the Court of Appeals and REMAND for a new trial.\r\n WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice John W. \r\n  Kittredge, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Mr. Granger returned to the house in between errands.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Apparently, Mrs. Granger saw James first, three or four feet away \r\n    from the front door, and Mr. Granger saw him a little further out on the porch.  \r\n    Both testified that the front screen door was closed when they saw James.  \r\n    Mr. Granger signed a statement on the night of the burglary that he saw James \r\n    coming out of the door, but, at trial, he claimed that was incorrect.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Several items were missing from the home including thirteen rolls \r\n    of quarters and some antique coins.  The police recovered all of the stolen \r\n    items, but the jury heard no testimony regarding where the police recovered \r\n    the items because of a search and seizure violation.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The camper was not advertised for sale.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The prior convictions admitted were for first-degree burglary, which \r\n    was charged in each case based on Jamesâ€™s prior convictions for burglary.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (B) makes life without parole a sentencing \r\n    option, but the State served notice that it also sought life imprisonment \r\n    under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A).  The trial judge noted that the life sentence \r\n    he imposed was appropriate under both section 16-11-311(B) and section 17-25-45(A) \r\n    because burglary in the first-degree is a most serious offense. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  Benton had not been decided at the time of Jamesâ€™s trial, \r\n    but Hamilton had been decided by the Court of Appeals and was the law \r\n    of this state at the time of Jamesâ€™s trial.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  Violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 922(g)(1) is triggered by prior convictions \r\n    for many different crimes.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2) requires proof \r\n    of prior convictions for only two specific crimes:  burglary and housebreaking. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Dennis J.

McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen Bullard, all of \r\n  Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, of the South Carolina Office \r\n  of Appellate Defense of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  We granted certiorari to review \r\n  the lower courtâ€™s decision granting Clyde Easter (â€œEasterâ€) post-conviction \r\n  relief (â€œPCRâ€).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nEaster was indicted for \r\n  armed robbery, kidnapping, and assault and battery with intent to kill.  The \r\n  State served notice of its intent to seek a sentence of life without parole \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-45(A) (Supp. 2001), based on Easterâ€™s two \r\n  previous convictions in New York.\r\nPrior to trial, Easter challenged the application of Â§ 17-15-45 asserting the \r\n  statute violated his constitutional rights and, alternatively, was inapplicable \r\n  because his prior convictions could not support the sentence enhancement.  The \r\n  trial court denied Easterâ€™s motions.\r\nEaster pled guilty to all charges.  While Easter did not dispute his guilt \r\n  he did object to the life without parole sentence imposed.  His appeal was dismissed.  \r\n  State v. Easter, Op. No. 99-UP-013 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 13, 1999).  \r\n\r\nEaster filed a PCR application \r\n  alleging various instances of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate \r\n  counsel.  The PCR court granted relief on trial counselâ€™s ineffectiveness in \r\n  advising Easter to enter a conditional guilty plea.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err in finding trial counsel provided\r\nineffective assistance in advising Easter to plead \r\n  guilty? \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe burden is on the applicant in a post-conviction proceeding to prove the \r\n  allegations in his application by showing counselâ€™s performance was deficient, \r\n  and the deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case.  Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); Cherry \r\n  v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).  \r\nThe PCR court found trial counsel deficient because he advised Easter to plead \r\n  guilty while preserving for appeal his objection to the imposition of the sentence \r\n  of life without parole.  The PCR court found by objecting to the sentence Easter \r\n  involuntarily entered an invalid conditional plea.  We disagree.         \r\nTo be valid, a guilty plea must be unconditional.  State v. Peppers, \r\n  346 S.C. 502, 552 S.E.2d 288 (2001); see, e.g., State v. Oâ€™Leary, \r\n  302 S.C. 17, 18, 393 S.E.2d 186, 187 (1990); State v. Truesdale, 278 \r\n  S.C. 368, 296 S.E.2d 528 (1982).  Sentencing, although often combined with the \r\n  admission of guilt in a hearing, is a separate issue from guilt and a distinct \r\n  phase of the criminal process.  See Gilbert v. State, 538 S.E.2d \r\n  104 (Ga. Ct. App. 2000).  Therefore, when Easter entered his guilty plea but \r\n  objected to his sentence he did not enter an invalid, conditional guilty plea.  \r\n  Trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nWe REVERSE.\r\n MOORE, A.C.J., WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.

Falkner Wilkes, of Meglic &amp; Wilkes, LLC, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  Respondent David Jackson, Jr., \r\n  (Jackson) was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.  Concluding \r\n  trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request \r\n  a self-defense charge, the post-conviction relief (PCR) judge granted Jacksonâ€™s \r\n  PCR application.  We reverse.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err by concluding trial counsel rendered \r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request a self-defense charge?  \r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nTo establish \r\n  a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the PCR applicant must establish \r\n  that trial counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness \r\n  and that, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability the result \r\n  would have been different.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 \r\n  S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).  â€œA reasonable probability is a probability \r\n  sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcomeâ€ of trial.  Id. 466 \r\n  U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698.  The PCR judgeâ€™s findings \r\n  will be upheld by this Court when they are supported by any competent evidence \r\n  in the record.  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).  \r\n  However, the Court will not uphold the findings of the PCR court if no probative \r\n  evidence supports those findings.  Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 \r\n  S.E.2d 378 (1996).  \r\nA.\r\nThe State contends the PCR \r\n  judge erred by concluding trial counsel was ineffective because he did not request \r\n  a charge on self-defense.  It claims Jackson was not entitled to a self-defense \r\n  charge because 1) Jackson was at fault in bringing on the difficulty and a reasonably \r\n  prudent person would not have believed he was in danger of losing his life and \r\n  2) Jackson and the victim were engaged in mutual combat.  We disagree.  \r\nA defendant is entitled to a self-defense \r\n  charge if there is evidence establishing: (1) he was without fault in bringing \r\n  on the difficulty; (2) he believed he was in imminent danger of losing his life \r\n  or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) he had no means of avoiding the danger; \r\n  and (4) that a reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and courage would \r\n  have entertained the same belief about the danger.  State v. Bruno, 322 \r\n  S.C. 534, 473 S.E.2d 450 (1996).  \r\nMutual combat exists when there \r\n  is â€œmutual intent and willingness to fight.â€  State v. Graham, 260 S.C. \r\n  449, 450, 196 S.E.2d 495 (1973).  Mutual intent is â€œmanifested by the acts and \r\n  conduct of the parties and the circumstances attending and leading up to the \r\n  combat.â€  Id.  Mutual combat bars a claim of self-defense because it \r\n  negates the element of â€œnot being at fault.â€  Id.  \r\nAt trial, Jacksonâ€™s father (Father) \r\n  testified Jackson drove Thomasina Smith (Smith) to the home the two men shared.  \r\n  Jackson and Smith went into Jacksonâ€™s bedroom with their four month old baby.  \r\n  Father testified he heard Jackson and Smith â€œscrapping back there, fighting \r\n  or whatever.â€  Jackson ran out of the bedroom.  While carrying a gun, Smith \r\n  chased Jackson, shouting profanities.  Jackson and Smith ran outside.  Between \r\n  one and two hours later, Jackson returned inside.  Father did not know where \r\n  Smith had gone.  \r\nJackson testified, on the night \r\n  of the shooting, he told Smith he intended to change jobs and wanted his family \r\n  to see the baby more often.  Smith â€œgot hot-tempered about it.â€  Smith strangled \r\n  and beat Jackson;  Jackson was able to get away.  He ran outside and attempted \r\n  to get into the garage, but found it locked.  He stated when he headed back \r\n  down the garage steps, Smith fired a shot at him.  He and Smith ran into each \r\n  other, fell down the garage steps, wrestled, and he managed to get the gun from \r\n  her.  Jackson stated he â€œguess I fell back and was - - was firing.â€  He testified \r\n  the â€œgun just went off.â€  He explained the semiautomatic 25-caliber weapon, \r\n  owned by Smith, had an â€œeasyâ€ or â€œhairyâ€ [sic] trigger.  Jackson agreed the \r\n  line of fire would have been slightly upward.  \r\nJackson testified Smith was still \r\n  alive and he was able to get her into the car.  He intended to take her to the \r\n  hospital.  Jackson stated he panicked when he realized Smith was no longer moving.  \r\n  On cross-examination, Jackson admitted dumping Smithâ€™s body in a ditch on the \r\n  side of the road approximately one-quarter of a mile from his home.  \r\nJackson testified, in general, Smith \r\n  was â€œmore quick-tempered than anything and she would jump on me basically.â€  \r\n  When she â€œjumped onâ€ Jackson, he believed she was â€œaiming to hurt [him]â€ and \r\n  he would run.  Jackson testified Smith was heavier and stronger than himself.  \r\n\r\nJackson was entitled to a self-defense \r\n  charge.  Contrary to the Stateâ€™s claim, Jackson presented evidence he was not \r\n  at fault in bringing on the difficulty.  According to Jacksonâ€™s testimony, Smith \r\n  physically attacked him after he told her he intended to change jobs and wanted \r\n  his family to have the opportunity to see the baby more often.  Furthermore, \r\n  a reasonably prudent person would have believed he was in danger of losing his \r\n  life or sustaining seriously bodily injury when being chased by an individual \r\n  who had just attempted to strangle and beat him and had shot at him with a gun. \r\n\r\nMoreover, Jackson and Smith were \r\n  not engaged in mutual combat.  According to Jackson, he and Smith did not have \r\n  a mutual willingness to fight but, rather, Smith was angry with Jacksonâ€™s decision \r\n  to change jobs and his request that his family have a greater opportunity to \r\n  see the baby and she physically attacked him.  State v. Taylor, Op. No.25637     \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 28, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 62) (mutual \r\n  combat is triggered when both parties contribute to the resulting fight).  Jackson \r\n  and Smith were not engaged in mutual combat.  \r\nThe evidence supports the PCR judgeâ€™s \r\n  conclusion trial counsel provided deficient representation by failing to request \r\n  a charge on self-defense.  Cherry v. State, supra.  \r\nB.\r\nThe State contends Jackson was not \r\n  prejudiced by trial counselâ€™s failure to request a self-defense charge.  We \r\n  agree.\r\nIn Ford v. State, 314 S.C. \r\n  245, 442 S.E.2d 604 (1994), the Court found that, while trial counsel provided \r\n  deficient representation by failing to request an alibi charge, the PCR applicant \r\n  was not prejudiced because, in light of the overwhelming evidence, there was \r\n  not a reasonable probability that, had the charge been given, the outcome of \r\n  trial would have been different.  Similarly, in Battle v. State, 305 \r\n  S.C. 460, 409 S.E.2d 400 (1991), the Court suggested that prejudice does not \r\n  automatically result from the conclusion that trial counsel provided deficient \r\n  performance by failing to request a particular charge.  See also \r\n  Stone v. State, 294 S.C. 286, 288, 363 S.E.2d 903, 904 (1988) (â€œbecause \r\n  the Stateâ€™s case rested primarily on the testimony of the victim and police \r\n  officers, [PCR applicant] was prejudiced by counselâ€™s failure to request [self-defense] \r\n  instruction.â€).     \r\nOur confidence in the outcome of \r\n  Jacksonâ€™s trial is not undermined by his failure to receive a self-defense charge.  \r\n  Jacksonâ€™s testimony was unsupported by the physical evidence and highly incredible.\r\nFirst, Smith had been shot six times, once \r\n  in the back.  At least four of the gunshot wounds were made from a downward \r\n  angle, contrary to Jacksonâ€™s statement he fired the gun in an upward angle.  \r\n  Furthermore, contrary to Jacksonâ€™s testimony, forensic tests revealed Smith \r\n  had no gunshot residue on her hands, indicating she had not fired a gun before \r\n  her death.    \r\nSecond, while the twenty-five caliber handgun \r\n  was not recovered, ammunition and a magazine for a twenty-five caliber handgun \r\n  were recovered from Jacksonâ€™s bedroom.  Jackson testified he did not know what \r\n  happened to the weapon he used to shoot Smith.  \r\nThird, Jackson gave inconsistent statements \r\n  and testified he did not remember noteworthy events.  For instance, Jackson \r\n  initially told the police he and Smith had a verbal argument and she walked \r\n  away.  He also testified he did not recall Smithâ€™s mother and sister coming \r\n  to his home and inquiring as to Smithâ€™s whereabouts shortly after the shooting.  \r\n  He stated he did not remember the encounter even though Smithâ€™s sister physically \r\n  knocked him to the ground.  \r\nAccordingly, while Jackson would have been entitled \r\n  to a self-defense charge, we conclude the instruction would not have affected \r\n  the outcome of trial due to the overwhelming evidence of Jacksonâ€™s guilt.

He was sentenced to three years, \r\n  consecutive, on each charge.  We affirm.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.\r\n       \r\n  Did the trial judge err by failing to quash the contributing to the delinquency \r\n  of a minor indictment on the grounds the underlying statute was void for vagueness? \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n       \r\n  Did the trial judge err by admitting propensity evidence? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nAppellant contends the trial judge erred \r\n  by denying his motion to quash the indictment for contributing to the delinquency \r\n  of a minor on the basis the indictment was void for vagueness.  In particular, \r\n  he claims the phrase â€œendanger the morals or healthâ€ is unconstitutionally overbroad \r\n  and vague.  We disagree. \r\nAppellant was indicted for violating South \r\n  Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-490(10) (2003) which provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\nIt shall be unlawful for any person over eighteen years of \r\n  age to knowingly and willfully (sic) encourage, aid or cause or to do any act which shall cause or influence a minor: \r\n\r\n. . . . \r\n\r\n(10) To so deport himself or herself as to willfully (sic) \r\n  injure or endanger his or her morals or health or the morals or health \r\n  of others.  \r\n\r\n(Underline added).                    \r\nAn indictment is sufficient if it â€œcharges \r\n  the crime substantially in the language of the common law or of the statute \r\n  prohibiting the crime. . . .â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003).  An indictment \r\n  is adequate if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity \r\n  to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, the defendant to know \r\n  what he is called upon to answer, and acquittal or conviction to be placed in \r\n  bar to any subsequent prosecution.  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 \r\n  S.E.2d 745 (2001); State v. Crenshaw, 274 S.C. 475, 266 S.E.2d 61 (1980).\r\nThe phrase â€œendanger the morals or healthâ€ \r\n  in the indictment against appellant derives directly from the language of the \r\n  underlying statute appellant was accused of violating.  The indictment was sufficient.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003).  \r\nAppellantâ€™s chief complaint is that Â§ \r\n  16-17-490(10) is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.  We disagree.\r\nStatutes are to be construed in favor \r\n  of constitutionality; the Court will presume a legislative act is constitutionally \r\n  valid unless a clear showing to the contrary is made.  State v. Brown, \r\n  317 S.C. 55, 451 S.E.2d 888 (1994).  â€œThe concept of vagueness or indefiniteness \r\n  rests on the constitutional principle that procedural due process requires fair \r\n  notice and proper standards for adjudication.â€  Curtis v. State, 345 \r\n  S.C. 557, 571, 549 S.E.2d 591, 598 (2001), cert. denied 535 U.S. \r\n  926 (2002), quoting City of Beaufort v. Baker, 315 S.C. 146, 152, \r\n  432 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1993).  The constitutional standard for vagueness is the \r\n  practical criterion of fair notice to those to whom the law applies.  A law \r\n  is unconstitutionally vague if it forbids or requires the doing of an act in \r\n  terms so vague that a person of common intelligence must necessarily guess as \r\n  to its meaning and differ as to its application.  Toussaint v. State Bd. \r\n  of Med. Examâ€™rs, 303 S.C. 316, 400 S.E.2d 488 (1991).  One to whose conduct \r\n  the law clearly applies does not have standing to challenge it for vagueness.   \r\n  Id.\r\nAt trial, the victim testified appellant \r\n  offered him marijuana and beer in exchange for sex.  The victim stated he told \r\n  appellant he was seventeen years old.  Appellantâ€™s act of encouraging a minor \r\n  to drink beer and smoke marijuana, conduct which is illegal, clearly endangers \r\n  the morals, if not the health, of the minor.  Accordingly, appellant lacks standing \r\n  to challenge the constitutionality of Â§ 16-17-490(10).  Toussaint v. State \r\n  Bd. of Med. Examâ€™rs, supra.  \r\nIn any event, the phrase â€œendangering \r\n  the morals or healthâ€ is not unconstitutionally vague.  A person of ordinary \r\n  intelligence and judgment need not guess at conduct which would â€œendanger the \r\n  morals or healthâ€ of a minor.  \r\nAppellant relies on State v. Flinn, \r\n  208 S.E.2d 538 (W.Va. 1974), in which the West Virginia Supreme Court held the \r\n  statutory language â€œ[d]eports himself so as to willfully injure or endanger \r\n  the morals or health of himself or othersâ€ was unconstitutionally vague because \r\n  the language was facially subjective.  The court concluded that portion of the \r\n  statute violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.  \r\n  U.S. Const. amend. XIV.  \r\nAt least two other courts have upheld \r\n  challenges to â€œhealth and moralsâ€ language in their statesâ€™ contributing to \r\n  the delinquency of a minor statutes.  Brockmueller v. State, 340 P.2d \r\n  992 (Ariz.), cert. denied 361 U.S. 913 (1959) (statute which prohibits \r\n  encouraging acts which have effect of injuring morals or health of a child has \r\n  long history of common law interpretation which renders sufficiently clear and \r\n  meaningful language which might otherwise be vague and uncertain); James \r\n  v. State, 635 S.W.2d 653 (Tex. Ct. App. 1982) (statute providing â€œany act \r\n  which tends to debase or injure the morals, health or welfare of [a] child. \r\n  . . .â€ is not unconstitutionally vague).  Moreover, numerous other jurisdictions \r\n  have denied vagueness challenges to contributing to the delinquency of a minor \r\n  statutes even though the statutes do not define with specificity the conduct \r\n  which is prohibited.  State v. Barone, 124 So.2d 490 (Fla. 1960); McDonald \r\n  v. Commonwealth, 331 S.W.2d 716 (Ky. 1960); State v. Simants, 155 \r\n  N.W.2d 788 (Neb. 1968); State v. McKinley, 202 P.2d 964 (N.M. 1949); \r\n  State v. Sparrow, 173 S.E.2d 897 (N.C. 1970); State v. Coterel, \r\n  123 N.E.2d 438 (Ohio Ct. App. 1953), appeal dismissed 120 N.E.2d \r\n  590 (Ohio 1954); Birdsell v. State, 330 S.W.2d 1 (Tenn. 1959); State \r\n  v. Tritt, 463 P.2d 806 (Utah 1970); State v. Friedlander, 250 P. \r\n  453 (Wash. 1926), error dismissed 275 U.S. 573 (1927).       \r\nSection 16-17-490(10) is constitutional.  \r\n\r\nII.\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred \r\n  by denying his motion to redact a portion of his written statement on the basis \r\n  the objectionable portion was inadmissible propensity evidence.  We disagree.\r\nPrior to trial, appellant requested the \r\n  trial judge redact nine sentences from his written statement to the police on \r\n  the basis that the noted portion constituted inadmissible propensity evidence \r\n  under Rule 404(b), SCRE.  The trial judge agreed to redact the last six sentences \r\n  from the statement, but declined to redact three other sentences.  \r\nOver appellantâ€™s objection, the State \r\n  entered appellantâ€™s redacted statement during the testimony of a police detective. \r\n  The three sentences at issue are as follows:\r\n\r\nI donâ€™t understand why I was attracted to him.  I think I \r\n  was attracted to him because he looked like he was fifteen.  When I found out \r\n  he was older it seemed perfect.         \r\n\r\nThe trial judge properly overruled appellantâ€™s \r\n  objection to the admission of the three sentences.  The three sentences do not \r\n  constitute propensity evidence under Rule 404(b), SCRE.  The sentences at issue \r\n  do not refer to any â€œcrimes, wrongs, or actsâ€ which are generally inadmissible \r\n  under Rule 404(b).  Rule 404 (b) (evidence of defendantâ€™s other crimes, wrongs, \r\n  or acts to prove defendantâ€™s guilt for crime charged inadmissible); see \r\n  Anderson v. State, Op. No. 25656 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 27, 2003) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 30 at 13) (threatening statement is not a bad act); State v. \r\n  Beck, 342 S.C. 19, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000) (statement of intent to commit \r\n  a crime is not a bad act).  Accordingly, the trial judge properly overruled \r\n  appellantâ€™s Rule 404(b) objection to the three sentences.  \r\nAppellantâ€™s convictions and sentences \r\n  are AFFIRMED.  \r\n TOAL, C.J., \r\n  MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25680","title":"Johnson v.

Arbabi, 347 S.C. \r\n  132, 553 S.E.2d 453 (Ct. App. 2001).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn January 1981, respondent Mohammad B. \r\n  Arbabi (â€œDr. Arbabiâ€) and his wife, Akram Arbabi (â€œMrs. Arbabiâ€), entered into \r\n  a â€œLand Contract and Agreement for Deedâ€ with the Island Club Investment Company \r\n  (â€œICICâ€) to purchase a condominium on Hilton Head Island.  The Arbabis live \r\n  in Michigan and were buying the property as an investment.  The sale price was \r\n  $90,000, and ICIC financed the transaction.  Title to the property was to remain \r\n  in ICICâ€™s name until the Arbabis paid their debt.  The parties agreed not to \r\n  record the contract in Beaufort Countyâ€™s public records; therefore, ICIC remained \r\n  the owner of record.\r\nIn 1989 or 1990, the Arbabis decided to \r\n  pay off the balance on the condominium.  On April 22, 1991, Dr. Arbabiâ€™s Michigan \r\n  attorney wrote the Beaufort County Assessorâ€™s office to request copies of the \r\n  property tax bills for 1988, 1989, and 1990.  The attorney additionally asked \r\n  the Assessorâ€™s office to send all future tax bills directly to Dr. Arbabi at \r\n  3739 White Trillium Drive East in Saginaw, Michigan (â€œWhite Trillium addressâ€).  \r\n\r\nOn September 3, 1991, the Arbabis recorded their \r\n  deed in the names of â€œMohammad B. Arbabi and Akram Arbabiâ€ with the White Trillium \r\n  address listed for the Arbabis.  ICIC, however, had not paid the property taxes \r\n  for 1990, and the County had seized the property on July 2, 1991.  During September \r\n  1991, the County Treasurer advertised the tax sale with ICIC as the owner of \r\n  record. [1]   The tax sale took \r\n  place in October 1991, and petitioner Gary Johnson bought the condominium for \r\n  $7,000.\r\nIn a letter dated September 1, 1992, which was \r\n  addressed jointly to â€œMohammad B. &amp; Akram Arabiâ€ [sic], the County \r\n  Treasurer informed the Arbabis that the property had been sold at a tax sale \r\n  and could be redeemed by paying $2,329.40 by October 7, 1992.  This redemption \r\n  notice was sent to the White Trillium address. \r\nMrs. Arbabi apparently signed for and \r\n  received this notice.  However, Dr. and Mrs. Arbabi were experiencing marital \r\n  problems, and in April 1991, Dr. Arbabi had moved out of the White Trillium \r\n  home.  Their divorce proceedings occurred between August and November 1992, \r\n  and at some point during these proceedings (but after the redemption \r\n  period had expired), Mrs. Arbabi disclosed the redemption notice to Dr. Arbabi.\r\nIn November 1992, the County Treasurer \r\n  issued Petitioner a tax deed.  The deed stated that the tax collector had, via \r\n  â€œcertified mail, return receipt requested, deliver to addressee only,â€ mailed \r\n  â€œa Notice addressed to Mohammad B. and Akrem Arabi,â€ [sic] as the owner of record, \r\n  informing them of the right to redeem.\r\nIn January 1993, petitioner commenced \r\n  the instant action to quiet title.  Dr. Arbabi filed an answer and brought a \r\n  third-party complaint against the Beaufort County Treasurerâ€™s Office and the \r\n  County Treasurer, individually. [2]   Mrs. Arbabi never answered the complaint.  \r\n\r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to Dr. \r\n  Arbabi and the tax deed was declared invalid.  Upon petitionerâ€™s motion to alter \r\n  or amend the judgment, the court modified its order, declared Mrs. Arbabi to \r\n  be in default, and granted petitioner relief - but only as to Mrs. Arbabiâ€™s \r\n  undivided half-interest.  Dr. Arbabi appealed, and in an unpublished opinion, \r\n  Johnson v. Arbabi, Op. No. 96-UP-008 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 8, \r\n  1996), the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.\r\nOn remand, the case was assigned to a \r\n  Master-in-Equity and a full hearing was held.  Dr. Arbabi testified that after \r\n  he left the marital home, he did not return to get his mail.  He stated Mrs. \r\n  Arbabi â€œwould bring it to me or she would give it to my attorney.â€ \r\nThe Master found the County Treasurer complied \r\n  with the statutory requirements in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-120 when it sent only \r\n  one redemption notice to the White Trillium address.  The Master decided Mrs. \r\n  Arbabi acted as Dr. Arbabiâ€™s agent in receiving the notice because Dr. Arbabi \r\n  did not stop Mrs. Arbabi from receiving his mail and never notified the County \r\n  of a change of address.  Thus, the Master concluded that petitioner held a valid \r\n  title to the condominium.\r\nIn a 2-1 decision, the Court of Appeals reversed.  \r\n  The majority held:  (1) Mrs. Arbabi was not Dr. Arbabiâ€™s authorized agent when \r\n  she received the redemption notice; (2) section 12-51-120 requires that each \r\n  co-tenant be sent a separate notice of the right to redeem, and therefore \r\n  the single, joint notice sent in this case did not comply with the statute; \r\n  and (3) the entire tax sale should be invalidated.  Judge Stilwell dissented, \r\n  finding that where multiple owners provide only one address for notice purposes, \r\n  separate notices need not be sent.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Does section 12-51-120 require separate redemption \r\n  notices for joint owners at the same address?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       2.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the Court of Appeals err in finding Mrs. \r\n  Arbabi was not Dr. Arbabiâ€™s agent for purposes of accepting the redemption\r\n        notice?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nInitially, we note this is an action in equity.  See \r\n  Bryan v. Freeman, 253 S.C. 50, 52, 168 S.E.2d 793, 793 (1969) (â€œAn action \r\n  to remove a cloud on and quiet title to land is one in equityâ€).  Therefore, \r\n  we are free to find the facts according to our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, \r\n  221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).   \r\n1.  Notice under section 12-51-120\r\nPetitioner argues the \r\n  Court of Appeals erred in finding that section 12&#8209;51-120 requires separate \r\n  redemption notices be sent to joint owners of a property even when they reside \r\n  at the same address.  We agree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-120 (Supp. 1991) provides \r\n  that a notice be sent to the property owner informing the owner that the end \r\n  of the redemption period is approaching.  Specifically, the section requires \r\n  that notice should be sent by â€œcertified mail, return receipt requested--deliver \r\n  to addressee only,â€ [3]  and that \r\n  the notice be mailed to â€œthe best address of the owner available.â€  Section \r\n  12-51-120 also states â€œthe return of the certified mail â€˜undeliveredâ€™ is not \r\n  grounds for a tax title to be withheld or be found defective and ordered set \r\n  aside or canceled of record.â€\r\nBecause notice under the tax sales is constructive rather \r\n  than actual, this Court has consistently held that tax sales must be conducted \r\n  in strict compliance with statutory requirements.  See In re Ryan \r\n  Inv. Co., 335 S.C. 392, 395, 517 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1999); Dibble v. Bryant, \r\n  274 S.C. 481, 483, 265 S.E.2d 673, 675 (1980); Aldridge v. Rutledge, \r\n  269 S.C. 475, 478, 238 S.E.2d 165, 166 (1977).  For example, the failure to \r\n  mail a redemption notice by restricted delivery mail is grounds to invalidate \r\n  a tax sale.  See Manji v. Blackwell, 323 S.C. 91, 473 S.E.2d 837 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).  Even actual notice is insufficient to uphold a tax \r\n  sale where strict compliance with statutory requirements is absent.  See \r\n  Aldridge v. Rutledge, supra.\r\nIn the instant case, the \r\n  Court of Appeals found the County Treasurer failed to provide Dr. Arbabi notice \r\n  under the statute because each co-tenant is equally entitled to separate \r\n  notice.  Johnson v. Arbabi, supra.  Judge Stilwell dissented on \r\n  this issue stating the following:  â€œIt makes little sense to me that where multiple \r\n  owners provide only one address for notice purposes each one must be sent a \r\n  separate notice but all to the same address.â€  Johnson v. Arbabi, 347 \r\n  S.C. at 147, 553 S.E.2d at 461 (Stilwell, J., dissenting).\r\nGiven the particular circumstances of this case, we agree \r\n  with Judge Stillwell.  Here, the co-tenants were spouses with the same address \r\n  (the White Trillium address in Michigan), and this address certainly was \r\n  â€œthe best addressâ€ available.  Indeed, this was the only address ever \r\n  given to County officials.  It was the address the Arbabis put on the deed and \r\n  which also was specified by the letter sent from Dr. Arbabiâ€™s Michigan attorney \r\n  in April 1991.  Moreover, we note there is no question that the Treasurer utilized \r\n  the correct method of mailing:  certified mail, return receipt requested--deliver \r\n  to addressee only.  Thus, we find there was strict compliance with the constructive \r\n  notice provisions in section 12-51-120.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that under the facts of this \r\n  case, separate redemption notices were not required in order to satisfy section \r\n  12-51-120.\r\n2.  Mrs. Arbabi as Agent for Dr. Arbabi\r\nPetitioner also argues the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  in reversing the Masterâ€™s ruling that Mrs. Arbabi acted as Dr. Arbabiâ€™s implied \r\n  agent in receiving the redemption notice.  We agree.\r\nWhether an agency relationship \r\n  exists is a question of fact to be determined by the relation, the situation, \r\n  the conduct, and the declarations of the party sought to be charged as principal.  \r\n  American Fed. Bank, FSB v. Number One Main Joint Venture, 321 S.C. 169, \r\n  467 S.E.2d 439 (1996); Hinson v. Roof, 128 S.C. 470, 122 S.E. 488 (1924).  \r\n  In Barber v. Carolina Auto Sales, 236 S.C. 594, 115 S.E.2d 291 (1960), \r\n  this Court stated the following:\r\n\r\nIt is well settled that the \r\n  wife is not the agent of her husband by virtue of the marital relationship between \r\n  them.â€¦ He may, however, make her his agent and be bound by her acts as such.  \r\n  â€˜The agency relationship in such case ordinarily rests upon the same considerations \r\n  as any other agency; she is his agent, and he is bound by her acts as his \r\n  agent, only when her agency is express, implied, or ostensible.â€™\r\n\r\n236 S.C. at 597, 115 S.E.2d \r\n  at 293 (emphasis added, citations omitted); see also Hinson, \r\n  supra (the marriage relation of the parties is not necessarily enough \r\n  to establish the fact that the one is the agent of the other; there must be \r\n  other proof of agency); 41 C.J.S. Husband &amp; Wife Â§ 56 (1991) (â€œA spouse \r\n  may constitute the other spouse as an agent either expressly or impliedly; but, \r\n  if agency is implied, it must be by conduct, and not merely from a partyâ€™s position \r\n  as a spouse.â€) (emphasis added, footnotes omitted).\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  [4]  found an implied agency cannot satisfy the requirements relating to \r\n  the receipt of a redemption notice.  Furthermore, looking at the postal regulations, \r\n  the Court of Appeals held Mrs. Arbabi was not Dr. Arbabiâ€™s agent when she received \r\n  the notice because Dr. Arbabi had not expressly authorized her as his \r\n  agent.  Johnson v. Arbabi, 347 S.C. at 139-40, 553 S.E.2d at 457. \r\n  [5] \r\nWe find the Court of Appeals erred in ruling there \r\n  cannot be implied agency in this situation.  The rule regarding agency between \r\n  spouses is that while a spouse is not automatically an agent for the other spouse, \r\n  an implied agency can arise by conduct of the parties.  See Barber, \r\n  supra; Hinson, supra. \r\n  [6]   Accordingly, the issue is whether Mrs. Arbabi was Dr. Arbabiâ€™s implied \r\n  agent.  \r\nWe agree with the Masterâ€™s view of the evidence in this \r\n  case that the factual circumstances establish the agency relationship.  By Dr. \r\n  Arbabiâ€™s own testimony, and his actions, Mrs. Arbabi was his implied agent.  \r\n  Dr. Arbabi left the marital home in April 1991.  Yet, on April 22, 1991, his \r\n  attorney wrote the County a letter requesting the Assessorâ€™s office to send \r\n  all future tax bills directly to Dr. Arbabi at the White Trillium address.  \r\n  Moreover, Dr. Arbabi stated he never returned to the marital home and Mrs. Arbabi \r\n  delivered the mail either to him or his attorney.  This arrangement apparently \r\n  went on from April 1991 through, at least, November 1992 - over a year and a \r\n  half.  Certainly, Dr. Arbabi knew he was going to receive mail related to the \r\n  Hilton Head property during that time period.  Yet, there is no evidence \r\n  in the record that Dr. Arbabi at any time filed a change of address form with \r\n  the post office or wrote the County with another, more appropriate, address \r\n  for him.  Under this evidence, we find that Dr. Arbabi, by his actions, appointed \r\n  Mrs. Arbabi his agent for receiving any and all mail that was directed to the \r\n  White Trillium address.\r\nWhile it is unfortunate that Mrs. Arbabiâ€™s failure to act \r\n  on the redemption notice and failure to disclose it to Dr. Arbabi in a timely \r\n  fashion resulted in their loss of the property, equity nonetheless favors petitioner \r\n  in this action since any â€œfaultâ€ is on the part of the Arbabis.  See \r\n  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 107, 531 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000) \r\n  (â€œHe who seeks equity must do equity.â€) (quoting Norton v. Matthews, \r\n  249 S.C. 71, 152 S.E.2d 680 (1967)).\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that \r\n  implied agency cannot satisfy the requirements for the receipt of a redemption \r\n  notice, and instead find that by his conduct, Dr. Arbabi made Mrs. Arbabi his \r\n  implied agent.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that section 12-51-120 does not require separate redemption \r\n  notices to joint owners residing at the same address.  We further hold \r\n  that Mrs. Arbabi was Dr. Arbabiâ€™s implied agent for purposes of receiving the \r\n  joint redemption notice.  Therefore, we agree with the Masterâ€™s conclusion that \r\n  petitionerâ€™s tax deed is valid.  The Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  It appears that although the Arbabis had become the official owners \r\n    when the deed was recorded on September 3, 1991, the County did not have this \r\n    information at the time it advertised the tax sale.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The third-party action eventually was dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  This statute has been amended twice since the tax sale at issue in \r\n    this case.  The statute now requires the notice be mailed by â€œcertified mail, \r\n    return receipt requested-restricted delivery.â€  (Emphasis added).  \r\n    â€œRestricted deliveryâ€ is the equivalent of â€œdeliver to addressee only.â€  See \r\n    In re Ryan Inv. Co., 335 S.C. 392, 394 n.1, 517 S.E.2d 692, 693 n.1 \r\n    (1999).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  We note that Judge Stilwell agreed with the majority opinionâ€™s analysis \r\n    and result on the agency issue, and therefore there was no dissent on this \r\n    issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Citing United States Postal Services Domestic Mail Manual Â§ S916.3.1 \r\n    (â€œMail marked â€˜Restricted  Deliveryâ€™ is delivered only to the addressee or \r\n    to the person authorized in writing as the addresseeâ€™s agent to receive the \r\n    mail....â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  The Court of Appealsâ€™ focus on the postal regulations requiring express, \r\n    written authorization from the addressee to the agent is misplaced.

Just as postal regulations \r\n    cannot excuse the failure to comply with the statute, see id., \r\n    these regulations should not be the basis for changing the well-settled rules \r\n    on agency between spouses.

Harvey appeals his 1999 commitment pursuant to the South Carolina Sexually \r\n  Violent Predator Act (â€œthe SVP Actâ€).  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-10 \r\n  et seq. (2002).  He also appeals from his 2000 annual review trial.  \r\n  See Â§ 44-48-110.  We reverse the 1999 order of commitment and remand.\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAs a juvenile, Harvey was adjudicated delinquent \r\n  in 1994 for committing first degree CSC with a minor.  In 1998, at age 19, he \r\n  was paroled.  Within weeks of being paroled, the State petitioned for Harveyâ€™s \r\n  commitment under the SVP Act.  In February 1999, a bench trial was conducted, \r\n  and the trial court found Harvey to be a sexually violent predator.  Harvey \r\n  appealed.  While the appeal was pending, Harvey received an annual status review, \r\n  and a jury trial was held in October 2000 to determine whether his status had \r\n  changed.  See Â§ 44-48-110.  The jury found Harvey should remain committed \r\n  under the SVP Act.\r\nFACTS [1] \r\nHarvey was born in 1978.  Prior to turning 14, \r\n  Harvey was both the victim of sexual abuse as well as a perpetrator.  At the \r\n  age of approximately eight, he was molested by a married couple that had a daughter \r\n  Harveyâ€™s age.  The abuse involved the four engaging in various sexual activities \r\n  and went on for a prolonged period of time.  Harvey also reported being sexually \r\n  assaulted by an older boy where the boy forced Harvey to perform oral sex.  \r\n\r\nAt the age of ten while visiting relatives in Michigan, \r\n  Harvey was involved in an incident with twin boys who were at least six years \r\n  old.  While at the twinsâ€™ pool, Harvey suggested they all take off their clothes, \r\n  and the three boys walked around naked for about 20 minutes.  When the twinsâ€™ \r\n  parents found out, they pressed charges against Harvey.  As a result, he attended \r\n  a sex offender therapy program in Georgia. \r\n  [2]   \r\nWhen Harvey was approximately 13 years old, he \r\n  had his younger brother, who was about five years old, perform oral sex on him.  \r\n  This conduct was the basis for his delinquency adjudication in 1994.\r\nThe State presented expert testimony from psychiatrist \r\n  Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts.  Dr. Schwartz-Watts diagnosed Harvey with pedophilia. \r\n  [3]   In her written report, she explained that her diagnosis was based \r\n  on Harveyâ€™s â€œacts over the past that demonstrate he has arousal to children.â€  \r\n  At the bench trial, however, Dr. Schwartz-Watts stated that during her evaluation \r\n  of Harvey, he had admitted having â€œsome recurrent urgesâ€ even since turning \r\n  16. [4]   Furthermore, Dr. Schwartz-Watts \r\n  opined Harvey met the criteria for a sexually violent predator and that outpatient \r\n  treatment was not yet appropriate for Harvey.\r\nOn cross-examination, Dr. Schwartz-Watts \r\n  stated that Harvey was not a sociopath or an antisocial personality.  She explained \r\n  she used the DSM-IV criteria to make her diagnosis and that although Harveyâ€™s \r\n  past acts did not occur after he was 16, he admitted to her that he had urges \r\n  about having sex with children.  She acknowledged her written report did not \r\n  state that Harvey had recurrent urges over a six-month period.\r\nOver Harveyâ€™s objection, the trial court \r\n  allowed into evidence a â€œLog of Critical Incidents and Clinically Significant \r\n  Eventsâ€ (â€œthe Logâ€).  The Log is an unsigned document kept by the Generations \r\n  Group Home (â€œGGHâ€), a treatment center for juveniles with sexually aggressive \r\n  behaviors. [5]   The Log details various incidents involving \r\n  Harvey and explanations of these incidents. [6]   Dr. Schwartz-Watts reviewed \r\n  the Log as part of her evaluation, and she testified â€œthere were some things \r\n  there [she] was concerned about.â€  She also stated, however, that she did not \r\n  base her diagnosis on the document.\r\nHarvey objected to the admission of the Log based \r\n  on hearsay.  He argued it did not comply with the business record hearsay exception \r\n  since it contained personal judgments and opinions.  See Rule 803(6), \r\n  SCRE.  The trial court, however, found it only contained â€œfacts and dataâ€ and \r\n  admitted the document. \r\nAs part of Harveyâ€™s \r\n  case, he called Dr. Karl Bodtorf as an expert in forensic psychology.  Dr. Bodtorf \r\n  also evaluated Harvey, but he did not diagnose Harvey with pedophilia.  Because \r\n  of Harveyâ€™s age at the time of his offense, and the age difference between the \r\n  children in the Michigan incident, Dr. Bodtorf did not feel that pedophilia, \r\n  as defined by the DSM-IV, was an appropriate diagnosis.  In addition, Dr. Bodtorf \r\n  reported that Harvey denied interest in children, and he stated that the psychological \r\n  testing did not show Harvey had proclivities toward children.  Dr. Bodtorf opined \r\n  that outpatient treatment, which he could provide, would be an appropriate option \r\n  for Harvey.\r\nThe trial court found beyond a reasonable doubt \r\n  that Harvey suffered from pedophilia and therefore ordered his commitment pursuant \r\n  to the SVP Act.\r\nISSUES\r\nHarvey raises two issues from the February 1999 bench trial:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Did the State fail to offer sufficient evidence Harvey was a sexually violent \r\n  predator?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       2.&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;Did the trial court err in admitting the Log?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.  \r\n  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nHarvey argues the evidence \r\n  at the bench trial was insufficient to meet two components of the SVP definition:  \r\n  mental abnormality and likelihood of sexual violence.\r\nIn an appeal regarding sufficiency \r\n  of the evidence in a SVP case, the appellate court may only reverse the trial \r\n  court if there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.  In re \r\n  Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 646, 550 S.E.2d 311, 315 (2001), cert. denied, \r\n  535 U.S. 1062 (2002).  In other words, the court is concerned with the existence \r\n  of evidence, not its weight.  Id.\r\nUnder the SVP Act, the State bears \r\n  the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is a sexually \r\n  violent predator.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100 (2002).  A sexually \r\n  violent predator is defined as a person who:  (a) has been convicted of a sexually \r\n  violent offense; and (b) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder \r\n  that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined \r\n  in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.  Â§ 44-48-30(1)(a) \r\n  &amp; (b).  The Act defines â€œ[l]ikely to engage in acts of sexual violenceâ€ \r\n  to mean the personâ€™s â€œpropensity to commit acts of sexual violence is of such \r\n  a degree as to pose a menace to the health and safety of others.â€  Â§ 44-48- \r\n  30(9).\r\nHarvey contends the State failed \r\n  to prove he is a pedophile because Dr. Schwartz-Wattsâ€™ diagnosis of pedophilia \r\n  was inconsistent with the DSM-IV criteria.  Specifically, Harvey maintains that \r\n  his acts of sexual misconduct which occurred before he was 16 should not be \r\n  the basis of a pedophilia diagnosis.  Since the DSM-IV criteria clearly indicate \r\n  that a pedophilia diagnosis is only appropriate if the person is over 16, we \r\n  share Harveyâ€™s concern with the focus placed on his acts.  See footnote \r\n  3, supra.  Moreover, we note the Michigan incident does not satisfy the \r\n  DSM-IV criteria since Harvey was not five years older than the twin boys.  Nonetheless, \r\n  there remain portions of Dr. Schwartz-Wattsâ€™ testimony which justify her diagnosis.  \r\n  She testified that Harvey reported having urges after turning sixteen and her \r\n  diagnosis was based on his present mental state.  Technically, this meets the \r\n  definition of pedophilia.  Thus, there was sufficient evidence of a mental abnormality \r\n  or disorder.  See In re Matthews, supra (the court is concerned \r\n  with the existence of evidence, not its weight).\r\nHarvey also argues the State failed \r\n  to prove that the pedophilia made him â€œlikely to engage in acts of sexual violence \r\n  if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.â€  \r\n  Harveyâ€™s argument is based primarily on the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s holding \r\n  in Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407 (2002), that there must be proof of \r\n  a lack of ability to control behavior.\r\nIn  In re Luckabaugh, 351 \r\n  S.C. 122, 568 S.E.2d 338 (2002), this Court noted that the Crane decision \r\n  â€œdoes not mandate a court must separately and specially make a lack of control \r\n  determination, only that a court must determine the individual lacks control \r\n  while looking at the totality of the evidence.â€  Id. at 143, 568 S.E.2d \r\n  at 348.  The Luckabaugh Court went on to state the following:\r\n\r\nInherent within the mental abnormality \r\n  prong of the Act is a lack of control determination, i.e. the individual can \r\n  only be committed if he suffers from a mental illness which he cannot sufficiently \r\n  control without the structure and care provided by a mental health facility, \r\n  rendering him likely to commit a dangerous act.\r\n\r\nId. at 144, 568 S.E.2d \r\n  at 349.  Thus, the Court concluded the requirements of the SVP Act â€œare the \r\n  functional equivalent of the requirement in Crane.â€  Id.\r\nAccordingly, given Dr. Schwartz-Wattsâ€™ \r\n  diagnosis of pedophilia and her testimony that Harvey met the statutory SVP \r\n  definition, we do not agree the State failed to present evidence of present \r\n  dangerousness.  See In re Matthews, supra. [7] \r\n2.  \r\n  Admission of the Log\r\nHarvey next argues the trial court \r\n  erred in admitting the Log from GGH over his hearsay objection.  We agree.\r\nHearsay is a statement, which may be written, other \r\n  than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial, offered in evidence \r\n  to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  Rule 801, SCRE.  Hearsay is not \r\n  admissible unless there is an applicable exception.  See Rule 802, SCRE.  \r\n  The business record exception reads as follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nA memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any \r\n  form, of acts, events, conditions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, \r\n  or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the \r\n  course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular \r\n  practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or \r\n  data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified \r\n  witness, unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of \r\n  preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness;  provided, however, that subjective \r\n  opinions and judgments found in business records are not admissible.    \r\n\r\n\r\nRule 803(6), SCRE (emphasis added).\r\nAt trial, the State called Terri Copilevitz, the \r\n  clinical director at GGH.  She stated the Log was a summary â€œwritten by our \r\n  clinical director at the time and [Harveyâ€™s] treatment coordinator providing \r\n  a summary of the critical incidents that [Harvey] had been a part of.â€  She \r\n  explained that â€œcritical incidentsâ€ are â€œthe way that we have staff report \r\n  to us any behaviors that are significant that need to be followed up \r\n  by the clinical staff.â€  (Emphasis added).\r\nHarvey argues the Log is replete with subjective \r\n  opinions and judgments and therefore is inadmissible hearsay.  We agree.  Even \r\n  the description of what this document is indicates its highly subjective nature.  \r\n  Moreover, it is an unsigned document which repeatedly offers judgments about \r\n  the progress of Harveyâ€™s treatment and his behaviors.  Because the document \r\n  did not meet the business record exception, we hold the trial court erred in \r\n  admitting this document.  See Rule 803(6), SCRE.\r\nNonetheless, the State argues that any error is \r\n  not prejudicial.  We disagree.\r\nUnless the appellant was prejudiced by the erroneous admission \r\n  of hearsay, reversal is not required.  E.g., State v. Mitchell, \r\n  286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985).  The Mitchell court explained as \r\n  follows:\r\n\r\nWhether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances \r\n  of the particular case.  No definite rule of law governs this finding; rather, \r\n  the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from \r\n  its relationship to the entire case.  Error is harmless when it â€œcould not reasonably \r\n  have affected the result of the trial.â€  \r\n\r\nId. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151 (quoting State v. \r\n  Key, 256 S.C. 90, 180 S.E.2d 888 (1971)).\r\nThe State argues there could be no prejudice from \r\n  the Logâ€™s admission because the trial court orally indicated it would not consider \r\n  this document.  The State contends the trial courtâ€™s comments from the bench \r\n  show it relied primarily on Dr. Schwartz-Wattsâ€™ evaluation and testimony in \r\n  reaching its decision.  However, we note that (1) the trial court admitted the \r\n  Log over objection, (2) Dr. Schwartz-Watts specifically commented on it during \r\n  her testimony, and (3) the State used it to impeach Dr. Bodtorfâ€™s opinion and \r\n  lend support to Dr. Schwartz-Wattsâ€™ diagnosis of pedophilia.  Therefore, the \r\n  Log entered into the trial in a significant way.  Moreover, despite the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s oral comments about the Log, the courtâ€™s written order does not state \r\n  that it, in fact, disregarded the Log.  See Ford v. State Ethics Commâ€™n, \r\n  344 S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001) (â€œThe written order is the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s final order and as such constitutes the final judgment of the court.â€).\r\nAccordingly, we find the erroneous admission of the Log \r\n  was not harmless.  See Mitchell, supra.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, due to \r\n  the erroneous and prejudicial admission of the Log, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  1999 order finding Harvey to be a sexually violent predator.\r\nBecause we find error with the \r\n  initial determination of SVP status, we need not review the issues raised from \r\n  the 2000 annual review trial.  Clearly, if Harvey had not been adjudicated a \r\n  sexually violent predator in 1999, he would not be confined and subject to annual \r\n  review.  The sole issue at an annual review trial is whether a person remains \r\n  a sexually violent predator.  See Â§ 44-48-110 (â€œThe burden of proof at \r\n  the trial is upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the committed \r\n  personâ€™s mental abnormality or personality disorder remains such that \r\n  the person is not safe to be at large and, if released, is likely to engage \r\n  in acts of sexual violence.â€) (emphasis added).  Moreover, we note that whatever \r\n  the jury found in the 2000 trial certainly could not in any way â€œcureâ€ an error \r\n  that occurred at the initial trial.\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, \r\n  BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Because we are reversing from the 1999 proceeding, we confine the \r\n    factual presentation to that trial, except where otherwise noted.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  We note that at the 1999 trial, the twin boys were repeatedly referred \r\n    to as Harveyâ€™s victims.  It was not until the review trial in 2000 that the \r\n    precise details of this Michigan incident were revealed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  At the Stateâ€™s request, the trial court took judicial notice of the \r\n    Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. \r\n    1994) (â€œDSM-IVâ€) as the document regularly relied upon for the diagnosis of \r\n    mental disorders.

App. 2002).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nCrosby was convicted \r\n  of voluntary manslaughter in connection with the December 28, 1998 shooting \r\n  death of Lavaris Dunham (Victim).  He asserts the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to charge the jury on the law of involuntary manslaughter.  We agree.\r\nOn the day of the shooting, \r\n  a number of people were gathered at the apartment of Monica Tucker and Shawanda \r\n  Knox.  Several of the people had spent the previous night at the apartment, \r\n  including Crosby.  Shawanda and her brother, Ryan, left their jobs at Western \r\n  Sizzlin and went to the apartment where they found several people inside drinking \r\n  and playing cards.  Shawanda asked Monica to make the people leave and, when \r\n  Monica refused to do so, Shawanda went across the street and called police.  \r\n  A policeman came and requested Shawanda spend the night elsewhere.  During this \r\n  timeframe, Crosby and his girlfriend Ketura Young were inside the apartment.  \r\n  Crosby became upset when the Victim, who had been drinking, told Crosby that \r\n  he would â€œtake his girlfriend.â€  Crosby went outside to clear his head.  \r\nBelieving he had diffused \r\n  the situation the police officer left.  Shawanda and Monica began fighting again, \r\n  along with Monicaâ€™s cousin Jenelle Outten, and Shawandaâ€™s brother Ryan.  As \r\n  Shawanda was leaving, Monica and Jenelle followed her down the stairs and another \r\n  fight broke out on the landing.  According to the statement Crosby gave to police \r\n  shortly after the incident, Monica and Jenelle started â€œdouble teamingâ€ Shawanda, \r\n  so he and Ryan tried to break up the fight, and he attempted to pull one of \r\n  them off of Shawanda.  At that point, Victim told him â€œDonâ€™t put your hand on \r\n  her. . . Matter of fact, donâ€™t touch her at all.â€  Crosby turned around and \r\n  then saw Victim â€œcharging at me with his hand behind his back.  I went in my \r\n  pocket and pulled that gun out.  I closed my eyes and pulled the trigger.  \r\n  I didnâ€™t even know I pulled the trigger.  I was scared.  I seen my life \r\n  in danger.  I didnâ€™t know how to react.â€ \r\n  [1]   Victim died of a gunshot wound which severed the carotid artery and \r\n  transected the spinal cord.  \r\nAt trial, Shawanda \r\n  Knox testified that as the group got into a car and fled the scene, Crosby told \r\n  them it was an accident and he didnâ€™t mean to do it.  Ryan Knox also testified \r\n  Crosby had told him he didnâ€™t mean to do it.  Another witness, Calvin Hill,  \r\n  testified Crosby told him â€œhe didnâ€™t mean to do itâ€ and that the gun had slipped.   \r\n\r\nCrosby testified that \r\n  as he attempted to break the girls apart, the Victim told him not to put his \r\n  hand on Jenelle.  Crosby told him he didnâ€™t want to fight, and Victim pushed \r\n  him.  Crosby attempted to push his girlfriend Ketura back into the apartment, \r\n  and he glanced back and saw someone charging at him.  He saw him â€œcoming at \r\n  me with his hand behind his back.  So I couldnâ€™t tell if he had a weapon or \r\n  not. . . . When I glanced back, I seen his hands behind his back.  So I ainâ€™t \r\n  know what kind it was.  Thatâ€™s when I reached in my pocket and turned around.  \r\n  By the time I turned around, he was already up on me, and I just pow. . . . \r\n  As I turned around, before I could turn around, Iâ€™ve done hit that pocket.  \r\n  He came up, I turned around and boom.â€  \r\nDuring the charge conference, \r\n  defense counsel waived his request to charge the defense of accident, agreeing \r\n  â€œthere was no testimony it was an accidental shooting.â€ [2]   However, counsel maintained that the testimony \r\n  that the shooting was not intentional, and that Crosby didnâ€™t even know he had \r\n  pulled the trigger were sufficient to demonstrate that he handled the gun with \r\n  a reckless disregard for the safety of others, such that he was entitled to \r\n  a charge on involuntary manslaughter.  The trial court disagreed.  The Court \r\n  of Appeals affirmed, finding no evidence which would support a charge of involuntary \r\n  manslaughter.  It found Crosbyâ€™s actions were intentional and unlawful, such \r\n  that he was not entitled to the charge.  348 S.C. at 397, 559 S.E.2d at 352.  \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals \r\n  err in ruling there was no evidence to support a charge of involuntary manslaughter?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe law to be charged \r\n  must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.  State v. Cole, \r\n  338 S.C. 97, 525 S.E.2d 511 (2000).   A trial court should refuse to charge \r\n  a lesser-included offense only where there is no evidence the defendant committed \r\n  the lesser rather than the greater offense.  Involuntary manslaughter is (1) \r\n  the unintentional killing of another without malice, but while engaged in an \r\n  unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm;  \r\n  or (2) the unintentional killing of another without malice, while engaged in \r\n  a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety of others.  State \r\n  v. Chatman, 336 S.C. 149, 519 S.E.2d 100 (1999).  To constitute involuntary \r\n  manslaughter, there must be a finding of criminal negligence, statutorily defined \r\n  as a reckless disregard of the safety of others.  Casey v. State, 305 \r\n  S.C. 445, 409 S.E.2d 391 (1991); S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-60 (1985).\r\nIn State v. Burriss, \r\n  334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999), this Court held that a person can be acting \r\n  lawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession of a weapon, if he was entitled \r\n  to arm himself in self-defense at the time of the shooting.  In Burriss, \r\n  the defendant was threatened and then attacked by the victim and another male.  \r\n  After being pushed to the ground, the defendant drew a gun and fired two rounds \r\n  into the ground.  One attacker backed away, but urged his accomplice--the victim--to \r\n  attack the defendant again.  At this point, the defendant was on the ground, \r\n  separated from his gun.  When the victim began moving threateningly toward Burris, \r\n  he snatched his gun up and it fired.  Burriss stated he was scared and his hand \r\n  was shaking when the gun went off:  &quot;It was an accident.  I didn't try \r\n  to shoot nobody.&quot;   Burriss, 334 S.C. at 263, 513 S.E.2d at 108.  \r\n  At one point, however, Burris also testified that &quot;my hand was on the trigger.  \r\n  The trigger was pulled or whatever.&quot;  \r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  found the present case distinguishable from Burris.  It found that â€œCrosby \r\n  consistently stated he deliberately retrieved the gun from his pocket and pulled \r\n  the trigger. . . . Crosby admitted he intentionally shot the gun.  Furthermore \r\n  no evidence was presented that the gun accidentally discharged.â€  348 S.C. at \r\n  395, 559 S.E.2d at 357.  \r\nThe evidence does not \r\n  support the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusions.  We find there is ample evidence \r\n  from which the jury could have inferred Crosby did not intentionally discharge \r\n  the weapon.  As noted, three witnesses testified that Crosby told them immediately \r\n  after the shooting that it had been an accident, and that he hadnâ€™t meant to \r\n  do it.  Witness Hill testified Crosby told him the gun had slipped.  In his \r\n  trial testimony, Crosby testified that â€œwhen I glanced back, I seen his hands \r\n  behind his back.  So I ainâ€™t know what kind it was.  Thatâ€™s when I reached in \r\n  my pocket and turned around.  By the time I turned around, he was already up \r\n  on me, and I just pow. . . . As I turned around, before I could turn around, \r\n  Iâ€™ve done hit that pocket.  He came up, I turned around and boom.â€  (emphasis \r\n  supplied).  In his statement to police immediately after the shooting, Crosby \r\n  stated, â€œI closed my eyes and pulled the trigger.  I didnâ€™t even know I pulled \r\n  the trigger.  I was scared.  I seen my life in danger.  I didnâ€™t know how to \r\n  react.â€  \r\nIn our view, the only \r\n  evidence which appears to directly support the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling is Crosbyâ€™s \r\n  statement to police in which he stated he closed his eyes and pulled the trigger.  \r\n  However, this  ignores the fact that Crosby immediately added that he didnâ€™t \r\n  even know he had pulled the trigger.  The effect of the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  holding is that if there is any evidence a shooting was intentional, all evidence \r\n  from which any other inference is may be drawn is negated.  This is not the \r\n  law of this state.  State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 433 S.E.2d 848 (1993)(charge \r\n  must be given if there is any evidence to support it; trial court commits reversible \r\n  error if it fails to give a requested charge on an issue raised by the evidence).  \r\n  We hold Crosby was entitled to a jury charge on the law of involuntary manslaughter.  \r\n  The Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is \r\n REVERSED.   \r\n\r\n MOORE, A.C.J., BURNETT, \r\n  J., and Acting Justices C. Victor Pyle, Jr., and L. Casey Manning, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]    This was the statement Crosby gave to police \r\n    shortly after the shooting.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]    The state asserts that, because Crosby waived \r\n    an instruction on accident, he likewise waived any entitlement to a charge \r\n    on involuntary manslaughter.  We disagree.  To satisfy the legal defense of \r\n    accident, it must be shown that the defendant used due care in the handling \r\n    of the weapon.  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999).  \r\n    A defendant is, however, entitled to a charge on involuntary manslaughter \r\n    where the evidence shows a reckless disregard of the safety of others.

Harvey, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent/Petitioner.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  Respondent/Petitioner James Breeden \r\n  (&quot;Breeden&quot;) was awarded workers' compensation benefits from petitioners/respondents \r\n  TCW, Inc./Tennessee Express (â€œEmployerâ€) and Granite State Insurance Company \r\n  (&quot;Carrier&quot;) for injuries he sustained in an automobile accident.  \r\n  Breeden settled his claim against the tortfeasor and notified the Workers' Compensation \r\n  Commission (â€œCommissionâ€) of the settlement.  Breeden then moved the Commission \r\n  to determine the amount of Carrier's lien and to determine the distribution \r\n  scheme of any remaining settlement proceeds.  \r\nThe Commission reduced Carrier's lien and ordered that the remaining settlement \r\n  proceeds be placed in a trust account to pay future compensation.  The Commission \r\n  further found that &quot;compensation&quot; did not include future medical expenses.  \r\n  The trial court affirmed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in \r\n  part, and remanded.  Breeden v. TCW, Inc./Tennessee Express, 345 S.C. \r\n  201, 546 S.E.2d 657 (Ct. App. 2001).  Breeden and Carrier each sought writs \r\n  of certiorari, both of which were granted.  We reverse in part, and affirm in \r\n  part.  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 14, 1993, Breeden \r\n  was injured when a truck owned by Piggly Wiggly crossed the center line and \r\n  hit Breeden's truck head on.  Breeden filed a workers' compensation claim.\r\nOn July 28, 1995, Breeden filed a Form 50 \r\n  [1]  alleging he was totally disabled as a result of a traumatic physical \r\n  brain injury and was awarded lifetime benefits pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  42-9-10 (Supp. 2000).  There was no appeal from this Order.  \r\nDuring this time, Breeden pursued a third party claim against Piggly \r\n  Wiggly.  Piggly Wiggly had $11 million in liability insurance coverage, and \r\n  the parties acknowledge liability was clear.  Breeden alleged economic losses \r\n  alone that were in excess of $9 million, including future medical expenses, \r\n  and a range of total cognizable damages \r\n  [2]  from $18 to $25 million.  The Commissioner held the total cognizable \r\n  damages were $13.5 million.  No lawsuit was filed, and Breeden's claim was settled \r\n  for $4.2 million while his wife's loss of consortium claim was settled for $1.8 \r\n  million.  Breeden's attorney explained the claims were settled for such a low \r\n  amount compared to the amount of insurance available because &quot;[w]e had \r\n  to.  This family was coming apart at the seams.&quot;  \r\nAfter settling the third party claim against Piggly Wiggly, Breeden \r\n  notified the Commission of the settlement and moved to have the Commission determine \r\n  Carrier's lien and the balance remaining to be paid to Carrier under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(g) (1985).  At the hearing, Breeden took the position that Carrier's \r\n  lien should be reduced using the equitable reduction provision of S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(f) (1985).  Both sides introduced detailed life care plans projecting \r\n  Breeden's future medical needs.  \r\nThe Commission held that the probable future expenditures in Â§ 42-1-560(g) \r\n  were subject to the lien reduction provisions of Â§ 42-1-560(f).   The Commission \r\n  also held that under Â§ 42-1-560, the Carrierâ€™s lien â€œdoes not include future \r\n  medical expenses which have not yet been incurred at the time of third party \r\n  settlement.  Rather, the lien includes compensation, both past and future, as \r\n  defined by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-100, and those medical expenses paid, or incurred \r\n  but not yet paid, at the time of the third party settlement.â€    Finally, the \r\n  Commission found that a reduction of Carrierâ€™s lien was equitable to all parties \r\n  concerned, and reduced the lien in the same proportion as the third party settlement \r\n  bore to the total cognizable damages. \r\n  [3]    \r\nThe Court of Appeals agreed that the Carrierâ€™s lien should be reduced \r\n  but held that the Commission misapplied the Kirkland \r\n  [4]  factors and the reduction formula and therefore may have ordered \r\n  an excessive reduction.  The Court of Appeals also held that the lien reduction \r\n  subsection, Â§ 42-1-560(f), applies to future compensation.  Finally, it held \r\n  that future medical expenses are to be considered in calculating the amount \r\n  of Carrierâ€™s lien, and for the purpose of establishing a fund to pay future \r\n  compensation benefits.  The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Commission \r\n  to recalculate the value of the lien.  \r\nLAW\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560 is a subrogation statute.  \r\n  The injured employee may bring an action against a third-party tortfeasor in \r\n  order to recover from the ultimate wrongdoer  under Â§ 42-1-560(b).  If the employee \r\n  recovers in that action, whether through a judgment, settlement or otherwise, \r\n  â€œthe carrier shall have a lien on the proceeds of any recoveryâ€¦to the extent \r\n  of the total amount of compensation, including medical and other expenses, paid, \r\n  or to be paid by such carrierâ€¦to the extent the recovery shall be deemed to \r\n  be for the benefit of the carrier.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(b).  If the employee \r\n  enters into a settlement for an amount less than the employeeâ€™s estimated total \r\n  cognizable damages, then the Commission may reduce the amount of the carrierâ€™s \r\n  lien in the proportion that the settlement bears to the Commissionâ€™s evaluation \r\n  of the employeeâ€™s total cognizable damages at law, if the Commission finds that \r\n  a reduction is equitable to all parties and serves the interests of justice.  \r\n  Â§ 42-1-560(f).  Once the lien and other specified expenses [5]  are paid, any balance remaining is placed into a fund which \r\n  shall be â€œapplied as a credit against future compensation benefits for the same \r\n  injury or death and shall be distributed as provided in subsection (g).â€  Â§ \r\n  42-1-560(b).  \r\nThe policy issues surrounding subrogation in a workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation setting include imposing the burden of payment upon the actual \r\n  wrongdoer, and avoiding double recovery for the injured employee.  12 Larsonâ€™s \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§Â§ 110.01-110.02.  The â€œcentral objective [of \r\n  a subrogation statute] is to provide the mechanics that will achieveâ€¦the third \r\n  party paying what it would normally pay if no compensation question were involved; \r\n  the employer and carrier â€˜coming out evenâ€™ by being reimbursed for their compensation \r\n  expenditure; and the employee getting any excess of the damage recovery over \r\n  compensation.â€  Id. at Â§116.02.  \r\nWorkersâ€™ compensation benefits do not include all the \r\n  various types of damages that may be recovered in a personal injury suit against \r\n  a third party tortfeasor.    See, e.g., Garrett v. Limehouse \r\n  &amp; Sons, Inc., 293 S.C. 539, 360 S.E.2d 519 (Ct. App. 1987)(The total \r\n  cognizable damages at law are â€œdamages which are legally recoverable in the \r\n  type of action in which the settlement occurs.â€)  For example, in a personal \r\n  injury suit, the â€œloss compensable in a personal injury action includes such \r\n  elements as pain and suffering, disfigurement, medical expenses, and lost earning \r\n  capacity.â€ F. Patrick Hubbard &amp; Robert L. Felix, The South Carolina Law \r\n  of Torts 555 (2d ed. 1997). The workersâ€™ compensation claimantâ€™s  benefits, \r\n  however, fall into two categories â€œbenefits to the worker for physical injury, \r\n  and benefits to the dependents in case of death.  Benefits for physical injury, \r\n  in turn, are of two kinds: wage-loss payments based on the concept of disability; \r\n  and payment of hospital and medical expenses occasioned by any work-connected \r\n  injury, regardless of wage loss or disability.â€  Larsonâ€™s, supra, \r\n  Â§ 80.01.  Since a personal injury settlement with a third party tortfeasor includes \r\n  elements that are not included in the workersâ€™ compensation benefits, it follows \r\n  that the carrierâ€™s lien should not always be satisfied in full from the settlement \r\n  proceeds. In Kirkland v. Allcraft Steel, 329 S.C. 389, 496 S.E.2d 624 \r\n  (1998), this Court set out examples of factors to be considered by the Commission \r\n  when deciding whether or not it is â€œequitable to all parties concerned and serve[s] \r\n  the interests of justiceâ€ to reduce the carrierâ€™s lien.  The four suggested \r\n  factors included â€œstrength of the claimantâ€™s case, likelihood of third party \r\n  liability, claimantâ€™s desire to settle, and whether carrier is unreasonably \r\n  refusing to consent to the settlement.â€  Kirkland, supra at 394, \r\n  496 S.E.2d at 626.  \r\nISSUES\r\nI.  Did the Court of Appeals err in including future medical expenses in Carrierâ€™s \r\n  lien under Â§ 42-1-560(f)?\r\nII.  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that the fund established under \r\n  Â§42-1-560(g) is subject to the reduction formula in Â§42-1-560(f)?\r\nIII. Did the Court of Appeals err in its application of the Kirkland \r\n  factors?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.  Future Medical Expenses and Carrierâ€™s Lien\r\nOne of the questions before us is whether the Carrierâ€™s lien, which \r\n  can be discounted by subsection (f), includes medicals that have not yet been \r\n  incurred, and whether â€œfuture compensation benefitsâ€ for which a fund is established \r\n  under subsection (g), includes future medical expenses.  We find the Commission \r\n  properly held that the Carrierâ€™s lien includes only those medical expenses paid \r\n  or accrued but not yet paid at the time of the third party settlement, and does \r\n  not include future medical expenses.  Rather, future medicals are to be included \r\n  in the fund designated to pay future compensation benefits under subsection \r\n  (g).  \r\nBreeden argues that the \r\n  definition of compensation in the fund provided for in subsection (g) includes \r\n  only future economic benefits and not future medicals because that subsection \r\n  of Â§ 42-1-560 only uses the term compensation. [6]   While this argument is facially \r\n  persuasive, we must decline to read the statute that way.  If we were to accept \r\n  Breedenâ€™s argument that â€˜compensationâ€™ includes only that described in Â§ 42-1-100, \r\n  then there would be no reason for subsection (g) to exist. [7]   Under Â§ 42-1-560(b), the Carrierâ€™s lien includes â€œthe total \r\n  amount of compensation, including medical and other expenses, paid, or \r\n  to be paid by such carrier....â€ (emphasis supplied).  Pursuant to the statute \r\n  the carrier's lien includes the &quot;total amount of compensation...paid \r\n  or to be paid.&quot;  If we were to construe the language in subsection \r\n  (b) to include compensation only as set forth in Â§ 42-1-100, then the fund in \r\n  subsection (g) would be unnecessary, as there would be nothing to put into that \r\n  fund.  This is because all of the compensation, including all future economic \r\n  damages and medicals, would be folded into the Carrierâ€™s lien, leaving nothing \r\n  for a fund under (g).  We hold that the language in Â§ 42-1-560(f) must be read \r\n  to require the Carrierâ€™s lien to include those medical expenses paid, or accrued \r\n  but not yet paid, at the time of the settlement and does not include medical \r\n  expenses that have not yet accrued.   \r\nAfter the lien is calculated, \r\n  and reduced if equitable, â€œâ€¦any balance remaining after payment of necessary \r\n  expenses and satisfaction of the carrierâ€™s lien shall be applied as a credit \r\n  against future compensation benefits for the same injury or death and shall \r\n  be distributed as provided in subsection (g) of this section.â€  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-1-560(b).  We hold that â€œfuture compensation benefits for the same injury \r\n  or deathâ€ includes future medicals in addition to economic compensation.  It \r\n  would be inequitable to allow the employee to recover damages based on future \r\n  medicals, and then disallow recovery for the Carrier.   â€œThe â€˜compensationâ€™ \r\n  expenditure for which the insurer is entitled to reimbursement includes not \r\n  only wage benefits but hospital and medical payments as well; this is usually \r\n  expressly stated, but is the correct result even if the reimbursement provision \r\n  speaks only of â€˜compensationâ€™ paidâ€¦The obvious intention of the legislature \r\n  in these [subrogation] statutes is to make the insurer whole, not to repay the \r\n  insurer certain selected and stipulated parts of its compensation costs.â€  Larsonâ€™s, \r\n  supra, Â§ 117.03.  While we reverse the Court of Appeals to the extent \r\n  that it held future medicals are included in the Carrierâ€™s lien we affirm the \r\n  decision that future medicals are to be included in establishing the amount \r\n  of the fund under Â§ 42-1-560(g).\r\nII.  Application of Lien Reduction to Future Compensation\r\nWe disagree with the Court of Appeals that the future compensation \r\n  fund established pursuant to Â§ 42-1-560(g) is subject to the lien reduction \r\n  under Â§ 42-1-560(f).  Section 42-1-560(f) permits reduction of the Carrier's \r\n  lien as defined by Â§ 42-1-560(b).  Subsection (g) specifically states that &quot;[w]hen \r\n  there remains a balance of five thousand dollars or more...after...satisfaction \r\n  of carrier's lien...which is applicable as a credit against future compensation \r\n  benefits for the same injury...the entire balance shall in the first instance \r\n  be paid to the carrier by the third party.&quot;  (emphasis supplied).  The \r\n  Carrier's lien is a separate pot of money that is not included in the same pool \r\n  of money creating the fund under subsection (g).  As we held above, future medicals \r\n  are to be included in the fund under subsection (g), but are not included in \r\n  the carrier's lien under subsection (f).  Because the statute clearly separates \r\n  the carrier's lien from the fund for future reimbursement, and because there \r\n  is no provision for the fund under subsection (g) to be reduced under subsection \r\n  (f), we reverse the Court of Appeals to the extent that it held subsection (g) \r\n  was subject to the reduction provisions under subsection (f).\r\nIII. Kirkland Factors\r\nIn S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(f), the General \r\n  Assembly set out the formula for if and how a carrierâ€™s lien may be reduced. \r\n  The Commission determines whether or not it is equitable to both parties and \r\n  in the interest of justice to reduce the lien using, among other considerations, \r\n  the four factors suggested in Kirkland.  The Commission is not required \r\n  to consider all of the factors, and is free to consider different factors than \r\n  the ones listed in Kirkland if implicated by the facts.  The Commission \r\n  does not need to follow specific Kirkland factors in deciding whether \r\n  or not it is equitable to reduce the carrierâ€™s lien, but instead the Commission \r\n  should look at the policy behind subrogation, and judge whether or not a reduction \r\n  is warranted on a case-by-case basis.  The Commission should be given wide discretion \r\n  in deciding which factors to consider, and what weight to give each factor.  \r\n  The factors are to be used only to decide whether to reduce the lien and have \r\n  no bearing on the amount of the reduction.  Section 42-1-560(f) sets \r\n  forth a specific formula [8]  \r\n  that should be followed if the Commission determines that the lien should be \r\n  reduced. [9]   \r\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals correctly held that the Commission erred \r\n  in its application of some of the Kirkland factors.  The four suggested \r\n  factors include â€œstrength of the claimantâ€™s case, likelihood of third party \r\n  liability, claimantâ€™s desire to settle, and whether carrier is unreasonably \r\n  refusing to consent to the settlement.â€  Kirkland, supra at 394, \r\n  496 S.E.2d at 626.  The likelihood of third party liability weighs against reduction \r\n  of the lien because the employer should not have to shoulder an undue proportion \r\n  of the liability for claimantâ€™s damages if there is clear third party liability.  \r\n  The strength of the claimantâ€™s case also weighs against reduction where the \r\n  claimant has a strong case.  The claimantâ€™s desire to settle relates to the \r\n  settlement with the third party, not against the employer or carrier.  This \r\n  third factor weighs in favor of a reduction of the lien in this case because \r\n  Claimant needed to settle for the benefit of his family.  The fourth factor, \r\n  whether the carrier is unreasonably refusing to consent to a settlement, weighs \r\n  in favor of the equitable reduction of the lien, if the Carrier is unreasonably \r\n  refusing to agree to the settlement.  \r\nThe Commission also considered three additional \r\n  factors: Carrierâ€™s conduct in fulfilling its statutory obligations; whether \r\n  the Carrier has actual exposure \r\n  [10] ; and, the extent of the Claimantâ€™s injuries.  The Court of Appeals \r\n  held that the first two factors should not be considered, and that the third \r\n  factor could be considered as a subset of the strength of the Claimantâ€™s case.  \r\n  We agree with the Court of Appeals that whether the Carrier has actual exposure \r\n  should not be a factor in determining whether the lien should be reduced. A \r\n  carrier should not be penalized for protecting its interests by buying re-insurance.   \r\n  However, the Court of Appeals erred in determining that the Commission should \r\n  not have considered the carrierâ€™s conduct in fulfilling its statutory obligations, \r\n  and the extent of the claimantâ€™s injuries.  Once again, the Commission should \r\n  apply only factors implicated by the evidence in the case before it, and apply \r\n  these on a case-by-case basis.  \r\nBoth the Commission and the Court of Appeals \r\n  held that it was equitable to reduce the lien, after application of the Kirkland \r\n  factors. We agree.  Because we hold that the Kirkland factors only apply \r\n  to the determination of whether to reduce the lien, and not to the amount by \r\n  which to reduce it, we reverse the Court of Appeals to the extent that it remanded \r\n  the case to the Commission to determine the percentage by which the lien should \r\n  be reduced.  However, we uphold the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision that a reduction \r\n  in the Carrierâ€™s lien is warranted, and reinstate the Commissionâ€™s determination \r\n  that the lien should be reduced by a factor of .31.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the Kirkland factors are a non-exclusive list, which can be \r\n  applied to determine whether it is equitable to both parties and in the interests \r\n  of justice to reduce the lien.  Once it is determined that a reduction is appropriate, \r\n  no decision is needed on the amount of the reduction, rather there is a mechanical \r\n  application of the statuteâ€™s formula.   We hold that future medicals are not \r\n  included in the carrier's lien under subsection (f), only those medicals which \r\n  have already been paid or accrued but not yet paid at the time of the settlement.  \r\n  We also hold that future medicals are to be included in the future compensation \r\n  fund under subsection (g), which is not subject to the lien reduction under \r\n  subsection (f).  \r\nWe reinstate the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  calculation of the Carrierâ€™s lien to include compensation, paid and accrued \r\n  but not yet paid, and medical benefits paid, or accrued but not yet paid.  We \r\n  also reinstate the Commissionâ€™s determination of the factor by which the lien \r\n  should be reduced.  However, the Commission must recalculate the fund under \r\n  subsection (g) to include future medical benefits.  We remand this case to the \r\n  Commission for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER \r\n  and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  A Form 50 is an Employeeâ€™s Notice of Claim and/or \r\n    Request for Hearing.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The total cognizable damages are â€œthose damages \r\n    which are legally recoverable in the type of action in which [a] settlement \r\n    occurs.â€  Garrett v.

App. 1987).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The formula in Â§42-1-560(f) applies if the settlement \r\n    amount is less than  employeeâ€™s estimated total damages.  The formula is: \r\n    (third party settlement divided by total cognizable damages)lien - carrierâ€™s \r\n    share of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs = recovery by carrier.  In this case, the \r\n    total cognizable damages were set at $13.5 million, and the settlement was \r\n    for $4.2 million.  4,200,000/13,500,000=.3111.  Therefore, the amount of the \r\n    reduced lien was computed by multiplying the original lien by .31.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Kirkland v.

(â€œEMSâ€).\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nOn November 1, 1992, \r\n  EMS and Laurens County Health Care System (â€œHospitalâ€) entered into a contract \r\n  in which EMS agreed to provide emergency services for the Hospital.  Under the \r\n  contract, EMS was responsible for employing emergency room physicians and a \r\n  medical director for the Hospitalâ€™s emergency department.  The contract required \r\n  the Hospital to employ and assign non-physician personnel to the emergency department \r\n  to perform the departmentâ€™s administrative work.\r\nDr. Gail Bundow, managing partner and \r\n  principal shareholder of EMS, was appointed as the medical director for the \r\n  Hospitalâ€™s emergency department.  The Hospital hired Anita Raines (â€œRainesâ€) \r\n  to be the secretary to Dr. Bundow in her capacity as the medical director. [1]   From 1995 to 1997, Raines stole \r\n  thousands of dollars from EMS before the theft was finally detected.  As a result, \r\n  EMS sued the Hospital, alleging several causes of action, including negligent \r\n  hiring, retention, and supervision of Raines; breach of contract for failure \r\n  to provide qualified and competent employees and for permitting improper and \r\n  illegal activities; and indemnification.  EMS sought indemnification for its \r\n  losses pursuant to a clause in its contract with the Hospital.  The indemnification \r\n  clause provided,\r\n\r\nThe Hospital will indemnify and hold [EMS] and the Emergency \r\n  Physicians harmless from and against any and all claims[,] actions, liability, \r\n  or expenses (including judgments, court costs, and reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees) \r\n  caused by or resulting from allegations of wrongful acts or omissions of Hospital \r\n  employees, servants, agents.  Upon notice by [EMS], the Hospital shall resist \r\n  and defend, and at its own expense, and by counsel reasonably satisfactory to \r\n  [EMS], such claim or action.\r\n\r\nHospital admitted Raines \r\n  was its employee, but asserted several defenses, including that EMS was contributorily \r\n  negligent in failing to procedurally safeguard against theft or detect it once \r\n  it occurred.  EMS moved for summary judgment on the indemnification cause of \r\n  action.  Hospital moved for summary judgment on all causes of action.  Hospital \r\n  argued any losses suffered by EMS were the result of EMSâ€™ failure to properly \r\n  monitor its own affairs and Raines, and, therefore, that it was not obligated \r\n  to indemnify EMS.  \r\nThe trial court granted \r\n  EMSâ€™ motion for summary judgment, finding that EMS was entitled to indemnification \r\n  by the Hospital for the wrongful acts of Raines, as the Hospitalâ€™s employee.  \r\n  The trial court went on to award EMS $76,709.32 in damages.  Upon the Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  motion for reconsideration, however, the trial court reversed summary judgment \r\n  on the damages issue, finding that the amount of damages was a question \r\n  of fact for the jury to decide.\r\nThe Hospital appealed, \r\n  arguing that the absence of a third party claim against EMS relieves the Hospital \r\n  from indemnifying EMS.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, and found that the parties \r\n  to a contract may agree to indemnify each other even when no third party claim \r\n  has been filed.  Laurens Emergency Med. Specialist, P.A. v. M.S. Bailey &amp; \r\n  Sons Bankers, 348 S.C. 191, 558 S.E.2d 531 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\n  [2]   Applying the general principles of contract interpretation, the Court \r\n  of Appeals held that the parties intended for the Hospital to indemnify EMS \r\n  for losses suffered at the hands of the Hospitalâ€™s employees, and that embezzlement \r\n  counted as an expense, a term used in the indemnification clause of the contract.  \r\n  Id.  The Court of Appeals found the absence of language restricting the \r\n  obligation to indemnify EMS for losses resulting form third party claims to \r\n  be significant.  Id.  Similarly, the Court of Appeals found that any \r\n  negligence on the part of EMS was irrelevant because the contract did not condition \r\n  indemnification on a lack of negligence.  Id. (citing United States \r\n  v. Hollis, 424 F.2d 188, 190 (4th Cir. 1970)).\r\nThe Court granted certiorari \r\n  to review the following issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.\r\n       Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that \r\n  Hospital was obligated to indemnify EMS for losses caused by the Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  employee in the absence of a third party claim?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.\r\n       Did the Court of Appeals err in refusing to consider whether \r\n  EMSâ€™ negligence impacted the Hospitalâ€™s obligation to indemnify EMS?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\n  I.&nbsp; Indemnification \r\n   \r\nHospital argues that \r\n  EMS is not entitled to indemnification for the money Raines embezzled in the \r\n  absence of a third party claim.  We agree.\r\nIn reviewing a summary \r\n  judgment motion, the facts and circumstances must be viewed in the light most \r\n  favorable to the non-moving party.  City of Columbia v. Town of Irmo, 316 \r\n  S.C. 193, 447 S.E.2d 855 (1994).  Summary judgment is appropriate when it is \r\n  clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is \r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  CafÃ© Assocs., Ltd. v. Gerngross, \r\n  305 S.C. 6, 406 S.E.2d 162 (1991).  Summary judgment should not be granted \r\n  even when there is no dispute as to the evidentiary facts, if there is a dispute \r\n  as to the conclusions to be drawn therefrom.  MacFarlane v. Manly, 274 \r\n  S.C. 392, 264 S.E.2d 838 (1980).  Upon review, an appellate court reviews the \r\n  grant of summary judgment under the same standard as the trial court.  George \r\n  v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548 S.E.2d 868 (2001).\r\nSouth Carolina courts \r\n  have consistently defined indemnity as â€œthat form of compensation in which a \r\n  first party is liable to pay a second party for loss or damage the second party \r\n  incurs to a third party.â€  Campbell v. Beacon Mfg. Co., Inc., 313 S.C. \r\n  451, 454, 438 S.E.2d 271, 272 (Ct. App. 1993); see also Winnsboro v. Wiedeman-Singleton, \r\n  Inc., 303 S.C. 52, 398 S.E.2d 500 (Ct. App. 1990), affâ€™d, 307 S.C. \r\n  128, 414 S.E.2d 118 (1992); 41 Am. Jur. 2d. Indemnity Â§Â§ 41-44 (1995).  \r\n  In a second party action to recover attorneyâ€™s fees for breach of contract, \r\n  this Court denied attorneyâ€™s fees, stating that the standard indemnification \r\n  clause at issue limited recovery â€œto the reimbursement for damages, costs, expenses, \r\n  etc. incurred in third party actions, not actions between the contracting parties \r\n  themselves.â€  Smoak v. Carpenter Enterprises, Inc., 319 S.C. 222, 224, \r\n  460 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1995).  In Smoak, the purchase and sale agreement \r\n  executed by the parties contained a provision requiring the defendant/buyer \r\n  to â€œâ€˜indemnify and hold [Sellers] harmlessâ€™ for certain damages, costs, and \r\n  expenses.â€  Smoak, 319 S.C. at 224, 460 S.E.2d at 383.  \r\n  [3]    \r\n In the present case, \r\n  the Court of Appeals acknowledged this general rule, but reasoned that parties \r\n  may craft an indemnity clause to provide for other forms of compensation, including \r\n  one in which a first party is liable to a second party for a loss or damage \r\n  the second party might incur.  Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists, 348 \r\n  S.C. 191, 194, 558 S.E.2d 531.  In support of this proposition, the Court of \r\n  Appeals cites to a decision by the Texas Supreme Court: Dresser Industries, \r\n  Inc. v. Page Petroleum, Inc., 853 S.W.2d 505, 508 (Tex. 1983).  In Dresser, \r\n  however, the indemnity clause expressly provided for second party indemnity, \r\n\r\n\r\n[Page] shall indemnify [Dresser] \r\n  and hold [Dresser] free and harmless from all claims for . . . subsurface damage \r\n  or injury to the well . . . including claims alleging that injuries or damages \r\n  were caused by [Dresserâ€™s] negligence, whether such claims are made by \r\n  [Page], by [Pageâ€™s] employees, or by third parties.\r\n\r\n853 S.W.2d at 506-07 (emphasis \r\n  added).  \r\nThere is no such provision for \r\n  second party indemnification in the indemnity agreement between EMS and Hospital \r\n  presently before the Court.  Infra, page 2.  This Courtâ€™s decision in \r\n  Smoak indicates that the default rule of interpretation for indemnity \r\n  clauses is that third party claims are a prerequisite to indemnification.  319 \r\n  S.C. at 224, 460 S.E.2d at 383.  In Smoak, the Court concluded that the \r\n  indemnification provision was limited to reimbursement for expenses incurred \r\n  in third party actions based on the clause itself and on a reading of the entire \r\n  agreement between the parties.  Id.  \r\nIn our opinion, the \r\n  clause at issue in this case is a typical indemnity agreement, much like the \r\n  clause presented in Smoak.  The contract between EMS and the Hospital \r\n  contains reciprocal indemnification provisions; both parties agreed to indemnify \r\n  each other under the same circumstances.  In our view, the circumstance EMS \r\n  and the Hospital contemplated in including an indemnity provision in their contract \r\n  was a third party claim brought against one of them for the wrongful acts of \r\n  the other.  As such, we find that it cannot be invoked absent a third party \r\n  claim against the second party, EMS.\r\nWe base this conclusion on the \r\n  language of the clause itself:\r\n\r\nThe Hospital will indemnify and hold [EMS] and the Emergency \r\n  Physicians harmless from and against any and all claims[,] actions, liability, \r\n  or expenses (including judgments, court costs, and reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees) \r\n  caused by or resulting from allegations of wrongful acts or omissions of Hospital \r\n  employees, servants, agents.  Upon notice by [EMS], the Hospital shall resist \r\n  and defend, and at its own expense, and by counsel reasonably satisfactory to \r\n  [EMS], such claim or action.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  The above quoted language, so similar \r\n  to the indemnity agreement in the Smoak contract, supports the \r\n  interpretation that the intended purpose of this indemnification clause was \r\n  protection against third party claims, not reimbursement for claims between \r\n  the parties themselves.  Smoak.  \r\nWe believe the business arrangement between \r\n  EMS and Hospital make the purpose for the mutual indemnity clauses within their \r\n  contract clear.  EMS contracted to perform emergency services that would otherwise \r\n  be provided by the Hospital.  EMS would be liable to third parties for its physicians \r\n  and other employeesâ€™ negligence, but it did not want to assume liability to \r\n  third parties for the actions of the Hospitalâ€™s employees.  Similarly, the Hospital \r\n  did not want to assume liability to third parties for the actions of EMSâ€™ employees.  \r\n  Based on these circumstances and this Courtâ€™s indemnity clause jurisprudence, \r\n  we decline to broaden the scope of a standard indemnity clause to include recovery \r\n  for second party claims when the agreement does not explicitly contemplate those \r\n  claims.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEMSâ€™ Negligence \r\n   \r\nHospital argues that the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  in holding that EMSâ€™ own negligence was irrelevant in determining Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  obligation to indemnify.  We agree.\r\nIn determining that EMSâ€™ negligence (if there \r\n  was any) had no impact on the Hospitalâ€™s obligation to indemnify, the Court \r\n  of Appeals attached considerable importance to the contractâ€™s failure to condition \r\n  the Hospitalâ€™s liability on anything related to negligence by EMS.  In doing \r\n  so, the Court of Appeals overlooked the rule requiring strict construction of \r\n  a contract containing an indemnity provision purporting to relieve an indemnitee \r\n  from the consequences of its own negligence.  Federal Pacific Elec. v. Carolina \r\n  Production Enterprises, 298 S.C. 23, 378 S.E.2d 56 (Ct. App. 1989).  â€œIndeed, \r\n  most courts agree with the basic rule that a contract of indemnity will not \r\n  be construed to indemnify the indemnitee against losses resulting from its own \r\n  negligent acts unless such intention is expressed in clear and unequivocal terms.â€  \r\n  Id. at 26, 378 S.E.2d at 57; 41 Am. Jur. 2d. Indemnity Â§ 20.   \r\n  Specifically, the Federal Pacific court found that the indemnification \r\n  clause did not meet this standard.  The court held â€œthat the use of the general \r\n  terms â€˜indemnify . . . against any damage suffered or liability incurred . . \r\n  . or any loss or damage of any kind in connection with the Leased Premises during \r\n  the term of [the] leaseâ€™ does not disclose an intention to indemnify for consequences \r\n  arising from [the indemniteeâ€™s] own negligence.â€  Federal Pacific, 298 \r\n  S.C. at 28, 378 S.E.2d at 58-59.\r\nIn this case, the indemnity provision is even \r\n  narrower than the provision in Federal Pacific; it does not have the \r\n  loss or damage â€œof any kindâ€ language that the court found to be insufficient \r\n  in Federal Pacific.  The standard language in the indemnification clause \r\n  here does not disclose an intention by the parties to relieve EMS of the consequences \r\n  of its own negligence.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE \r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming summary judgment in favor of \r\n  EMS and REMAND for entry of summary judgment in favor of the Hospital \r\n  on EMSâ€™ indemnification cause of action.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT., JJ., concur.

Leadbitter, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE \r\n  TOAL:  Petitioner, Robert L. Mathis (â€œPetitionerâ€), challenges his first \r\n  degree burglary conviction alleging that the circuit court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to convict him.  In the alternative, Petitioner argues that the \r\n  Court of Appeals erred in affirming the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of his petition \r\n  for writ of habeas corpus.\r\nFactual \r\n  / Procedural Background\r\nPetitioner was convicted in \r\n  absentia of first-degree burglary in 1990.  After the jury returned with \r\n  the verdict, the trial judge issued a sealed sentence.  In 1995, Petitioner \r\n  appeared with his attorney to have the sentence - life imprisonment - read to \r\n  him.  Petitioner appealed and was informed by his attorney on January 3, 1997, \r\n  that his conviction had been affirmed on direct appeal. \r\n  [1]   \r\nOn October 5, 1999, Petitioner \r\n  filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the circuit court.  The State \r\n  filed a return and motion to dismiss, arguing that Petitioner must file a petition \r\n  for writ of habeas corpus in the original jurisdiction of this Court because \r\n  he had not exhausted his remedies in PCR.\r\nThe circuit court dismissed the \r\n  petition accordingly, agreeing that petitioning this Court in its original jurisdiction \r\n  was Petitionerâ€™s only remedy because he had not exhausted his PCR remedies nor \r\n  shown that PCR was not available to him.  Petitioner appealed, and the Court \r\n  of Appeals affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal.  Mathis v. State, Op. \r\n  No. 2001-UP-300 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 31, 2001).\r\nAfter the Court of Appeals denied \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s motion for rehearing, Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari.  \r\n  All five members of this Court granted certiorari.  Subsequently, Petitioner \r\n  filed a motion to vacate his conviction for first degree burglary on grounds \r\n  that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict him of \r\n  that offense because the indictment failed to name all the elements of first \r\n  degree burglary enumerated in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311.  The Court granted \r\n  Petitioner leave to address the subject matter jurisdiction issue in this proceeding.  \r\n\r\nThe following issues are presently \r\n  before the Court:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Did the circuit court have subject matter jurisdiction to convict Petitioner \r\n  of first degree burglary when the indictment did not name a circumstance of \r\n  aggravation?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.\r\n       \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the dismissal of Petitionerâ€™s petition \r\n  for writ of habeas corpus rather than treating the petition as an application \r\n  for PCR?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI.  Indictment\r\nPetitioner argues that the circuit court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to convict him of first degree burglary because \r\n  the indictment failed to state an element of the crime: a circumstance of aggravation.  \r\n  We agree.\r\nIssues related to subject matter jurisdiction may \r\n  be raised at any time.  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 465 S.E.2d 358 \r\n  (1995); State v. Funderburk, 259 S.C. 256, 191 S.E.2d 520 (1972).  A \r\n  circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction if: (1) there has been an indictment \r\n  that sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has been a waiver of the indictment; \r\n  or (3) the charge is a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment.  \r\n  Cutner v. State, Op. No. 25644 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 28, 2003).  â€œThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be \r\n  made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements \r\n  of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant \r\n  of what he must be prepared to meet.â€  Browning, 320 S.C. at 368, 465 \r\n  S.E.2d at 359 (citing State v. Munn, 292 S.C. 497, 357 S.E.2d 461 (1987)).\r\nIn Browning, defendant was convicted of \r\n  seven counts of second degree burglary after pleading guilty.  320 S.C. at 367-68, \r\n  465 S.E.2d at 359.  At the time of the indictments in question, second-degree \r\n  burglary of a building required that the burglary be accompanied by a circumstance \r\n  of aggravation as defined by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(B). [2]  Id. (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(B) (Supp. 1993)).  \r\n  None of the seven indictments in Browning stated any circumstances of \r\n  aggravation.  Consequently, the Court found that the indictment failed to â€œcontain \r\n  the necessary elements of second degree burglary.â€  Browning, \r\n  320 S.C. at 369, 465 S.E.2d at 359.  The Court held, â€œ[b]ecause no circumstances \r\n  of aggravation were stated, the indictments were insufficient, and the circuit \r\n  court lacked jurisdiction to accept [defendantâ€™s] guilty plea to second degree \r\n  burglary.â€  Id.  The Court then vacated the defendantâ€™s plea and sentence \r\n  for second degree burglary.  Id. [3]   \r\nIn the present case, Petitioner was indicted for \r\n  first and second degree burglary in 1990, and convicted in absentia of \r\n  first degree burglary in 1995.  In 1990, first degree burglary was defined as \r\n  follows:  \r\n\r\nA person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the \r\n  person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein, \r\n  and either:\r\n(1) When effecting entry or while in the dwelling or in \r\n  immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n  (a) Is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive; or\r\n  (b) Causes \r\n  physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime:\r\n  (c) Uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or\r\n  (d) Displays what is or appears to be a knife, \r\n  pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm; or\r\n(2) The burglary is committed by a person with a prior record \r\n  of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a combination of \r\n  both; or\r\n(3) The entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A) \r\n  (Supp. 1990).\r\nPetitionerâ€™s indictment \r\n  fails to list any of the circumstances of aggravation provided for in section \r\n  16-11-311(A) (1), (2), or (3).  It does not indicate that Petitioner had a weapon, \r\n  harmed anyone, or threatened to use force, nor does it indicate that Petitioner \r\n  had prior burglary convictions or that the burglary occurred at night.  Accordingly, \r\n  we find that the indictment failed to state the necessary elements of the offense \r\n  under Lynch and Browning.  Therefore, the circuit court \r\n  lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict Petitioner of first degree burglary, \r\n  and Petitionerâ€™s conviction for that offense must be vacated. \r\n  [4] \r\nII.  Habeas Petition\r\nPetitioner argues that \r\n  his petition to the circuit court for writ of habeas corpus should have been \r\n  evaluated as a PCR application because he was deprived of his â€œone bite of the \r\n  appleâ€ in PCR.  Based on our conclusion that the circuit court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to convict Petitioner due to an insufficient indictment, \r\n  it is unnecessary for us to address this issue.  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  we VACATE Petitionerâ€™s first-degree burglary conviction. [5] \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The letter from Petitionerâ€™s attorney stated, â€œYou will need to try \r\n    other avenues for your appeal,â€ but did not mention post-conviction relief \r\n    (â€œPCRâ€) specifically or that Petitioner had one year from the filing of the \r\n    final decision of the appeal in which to file a PCR application.  S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (Supp. 1995 &amp; 2002). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Section 16-11-312(B) lists three types of aggravating circumstances.  \r\n    The first category occurs when the burglar enters the building with some type \r\n    of weapon, threatens to use a dangerous instrument, or physically harms any \r\n    person who is not a participant in the crime.  The second category makes any \r\n    burglary second degree if the person committing it has two or more prior burglary \r\n    convictions.  The third category applies to all burglaries that occur at nighttime.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  See also State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 545 S.E.2d 511 (2001) \r\n    (finding that although it is only one element of the crime, the aggravating \r\n    circumstance is â€œâ€˜the essenceâ€™ of first degree burglaryâ€ and must be included \r\n    on the indictment presented to the grand jury to confer subject matter jurisdiction \r\n    on the circuit court).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  In reaching this conclusion, we considered the impact of S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (Supp. 2002).  First enacted in 1887, section 17-19-90, requires \r\n    objections to defects apparent on the face of an indictment be made before \r\n    the jury is sworn.  This section has not been amended since its original enactment \r\n    and has not been cited in recent years by this Court in its discussion of \r\n    the sufficiency of indictments.  In our opinion, this statutory provision \r\n    applies to defects in an indictment that do not affect the subject matter \r\n    jurisdiction of the circuit court.  Our modern jurisprudence makes it clear \r\n    that failure to list an aggravating circumstance does affect subject matter \r\n    jurisdiction, and that subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and may \r\n    be raised at any time.  Thus, we believe section 17-19-90 does not limit a \r\n    courtâ€™s consideration of indictment defects that affect subject matter jurisdiction, \r\n    no matter when such issues are raised.  Lynch; Browning\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The State argues that this Court should direct the entry of judgment \r\n    against Petitioner on the lesser included offense of second degree burglary \r\n    for which Petitioner was also indicted.  This Court exercised its option to \r\n    do so in State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 559 S.E.2d 847 (2002) (sentencing \r\n    defendant to lesser included offense of strong arm robbery after finding that \r\n    insufficient evidence was submitted to support conviction for greater offense).  \r\n    In this case, although Petitioner was indicted for second degree burglary, \r\n    the record on appeal reflects that second degree burglary was never presented \r\n    to the jury as an option and was not charged to the jury at the close of the \r\n    case.  Under the circumstances presented in this case, we decline to direct \r\n    the entry of judgment on the lesser offense.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25685","title":"In the Matter of R.

Richardson, Jr., and Assistant Deputy Attorney General J. Emory Smith, \r\n  Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nR. Dean Welch, of Surfside Beach, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, a full panel of the \r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct recommended respondent be disbarred.  We agree \r\n  and disbar respondent, retroactive to the date he was placed on interim suspension \r\n  for the misconduct which led to his indefinite suspension and to the conviction \r\n  which forms the basis for disbarment. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 26, 1999, respondent was placed on indefinite suspension \r\n  for failing to supervise an employee who engaged in a check kiting scheme which \r\n  involved trust and title accounts. \r\n  [2]   In the Matter of Welch, 335 S.C. 613, 518 S.E.2d 821 (1999).  \r\n  On August 29, 2000, respondent pled guilty to one count of bank fraud stemming \r\n  from his involvement in the scheme.  \r\nThereafter, Disciplinary Counsel filed formal charges against respondent based \r\n  on respondent's conviction and on misrepresentations he allegedly made during \r\n  an examination under oath pursuant to Rule 19, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and in \r\n  an affidavit in mitigation submitted with the previous Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent.  The sub-panel and full panel recommended respondent be disbarred \r\n  and required to pay $365.14 in costs.  The recommendation was based on respondent's \r\n  conviction and a finding that admissions made during his guilty plea rendered \r\n  false respondent's allegations and representations made under oath during the \r\n  Rule 19 examination leading up to, and in the affidavit submitted with, the \r\n  previous Agreement for Discipline by Consent.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in \r\n  which discipline is given rests entirely with this Court.  In re Barker, \r\n  352 S.C. 71, 572 S.E.2d 460 (2002).  The Court may make its own findings of \r\n  fact and conclusions of law and is not bound by the Panel's recommendation.  \r\n  Id.  The Court must administer the sanction it deems appropriate after \r\n  a thorough review of the record.  Id.\r\nRespondent has argued throughout these proceedings that \r\n  his admissions made during his guilty plea in federal court did not conflict \r\n  with prior statements made to Disciplinary Counsel and this Court.  We find \r\n  respondent's statements made to Disciplinary Counsel and this Court in conjunction \r\n  with the prior disciplinary matter were neither false nor misleading.\r\nRespondent does not, however, dispute the fact that, subsequent \r\n  to his indefinite suspension, he pled guilty to bank fraud, nor does he argue \r\n  that he should not be disciplined as a result.  In In re Chastain, 340 \r\n  S.C. 356, 532 S.E.2d 264 (2000), this Court held that an attorney's criminal \r\n  conviction, which involves a matter for which the attorney was sanctioned in \r\n  a prior disciplinary proceeding, provides a separate basis for an additional \r\n  sanction.  The following factors are to be considered in determining whether \r\n  to impose an additional sanction:  (1) whether an additional sanction is necessary \r\n  to protect the public; (2) whether an additional sanction is necessary to protect \r\n  the integrity of the legal system or the administration of justice; (3) whether \r\n  the criminal proceeding resulted in any information the Court did not consider \r\n  in imposing the prior sanction; (4) whether the convicted lawyer would be unable \r\n  to practice law due to incarceration, probation or parole; (5) whether the disciplinary \r\n  or criminal processes have been improperly manipulated to harass or intimidate \r\n  the lawyer; (6) whether imposing an additional sanction would be unfair to the \r\n  lawyer; and (7) any other factor the Court deems relevant.\r\nWe find that this is a case in which the imposition of an \r\n  additional sanction would not be unfair to the lawyer.  Bank fraud is a serious \r\n  crime as defined by Rule 2(z), RLDE, and is a ground for discipline pursuant \r\n  to Rule 7(a)(4), RLDE.  A bank fraud conviction also constitutes a violation \r\n  of Rule 8.4(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, which \r\n  prohibits an attorney from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, \r\n  deceit or misrepresentation.  Moreover, we find there is precedent for imposition \r\n  of the sanction of disbarment for such misconduct.  See In re Holt, \r\n  328 S.C. 169, 492 S.E.2d 793 (1997)(attorney's federal conviction of one count \r\n  of bank fraud warranted disbarment); see also In re Thompson, \r\n  343 S.C. 1, 539 S.E.2d 396 (2000) (disbarment for mishandling of trust account, \r\n  commingling of funds, and use of trust accounts in check kiting scheme); In \r\n  re Yarborough, 343 S.C. 316, 540 S.E.2d 462 (2000)(use of escrow funds to \r\n  pay margin call on stock purchased for personal use, engaging in check kiting \r\n  scheme, and bank fraud conviction warranted disbarment); In re Gibbes, \r\n  323 S.C. 80, 450 S.E.2d 588 (1994)(engaging in check kiting scheme and misappropriating \r\n  and converting client funds warrant disbarment); In re Gates, 311 S.C. \r\n  246, 428 S.E.2d 716 (1993) (writing checks on trust accounts without sufficient \r\n  funds in accounts to cover checks, writing checks on trust and escrow accounts \r\n  for personal matters, and engaging in check kiting schemes in violation of federal \r\n  law warrants disbarment).  \r\nAccordingly, we disbar respondent retroactive to February 19, 1998, the date \r\n  he was placed on interim suspension for the misconduct which led to his indefinite \r\n  suspension and to the conviction which forms the basis for the current sanction.  \r\n  Respondent is also ordered to pay $365.14, the costs of these proceedings.\r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent \r\n  shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied \r\n  with Rule 30, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate \r\n  of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n DISBARRED.     \r\n MOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and \r\n  Acting Justice C.

Richardson, Jr., and Deborah Stroud McKeown, both of Columbia, for \r\n  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nC. Bradley Hutto, of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   Respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into \r\n  an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, Rules for Judicial \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.  Therein, respondent admits he violated \r\n  the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR, and agrees to the imposition \r\n  of a confidential admonition, a public reprimand or a definite suspension not \r\n  to exceed six months.  We accept the agreement and suspend respondent for six \r\n  months. \r\nFacts\r\nThe facts, as stated in the agreement, are as follows.  \r\n  On occasions prior to 1997, respondent conducted sales of abandoned or stored \r\n  motor vehicles pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-15-10 without turning the proceeds \r\n  from the sale of the vehicles over to the county treasurer or the clerk of court.  \r\n  Instead, respondent kept the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles for his \r\n  personal use.  Since 1997, when respondent was confronted about this matter \r\n  by another magistrate, respondent has turned the proceeds from the sale of the \r\n  vehicles over to the county.  Respondent maintains he was not aware that the \r\n  proceeds from the sale of the vehicles had to be turned over to the county until \r\n  the other magistrate advised him of the requirement.  The South Carolina Law \r\n  Enforcement Division investigated the matter and found that respondent failed \r\n  to turn over $870 in proceeds to the county.  Respondent has since paid that \r\n  amount to the clerk of court.  In addition, respondent represents that he has \r\n  corrected his procedures for the sale of vehicles pursuant to section 29-15-10 \r\n  and now complies with the statutory requirements.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that these allegations constitute grounds \r\n  for discipline under Rules 7(a)(1) and (4), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.  Respondent \r\n  also admits that he has violated the following provisions of the Code of Judicial \r\n  Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:  Canon 1 (a judge shall uphold the integrity and independence \r\n  of the judiciary); Canon 2 (a judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance \r\n  of impropriety in all of the judge's activities); Canon 2(A)(a judge shall respect \r\n  and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes \r\n  public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon \r\n  3(a judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently); \r\n  Canon 3(B)(2)(a judge shall be faithful to the law and maintain professional \r\n  competence in it); Canon 3(B)(8)(a judge shall dispose of all judicial matters \r\n  promptly, efficiently and fairly); and Canon 3(C)(1)(a judge shall diligently \r\n  discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities without bias or prejudice \r\n  and maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and should \r\n  cooperate with other judges and court officials in the administration of court \r\n  business).\r\nConclusion\r\n&nbsp;We find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a six month \r\n  suspension.  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent \r\n  and suspend respondent for six months.  Bamberg County is under no obligation \r\n  to pay respondent his salary during the period of suspension.

State v. Cobb, 349 S.C. 126, 561 S.E.2d \r\n  631(Ct. App. 2002).  We reverse and remand.  \r\nPetitioner was indicted for:  distribution of marijuana to a person under 18 \r\n  years of age, distribution of marijuana, second degree sexual exploitation of \r\n  a minor, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.  The jury found \r\n  petitioner not guilty of distribution of marijuana to a person under 18 years \r\n  of age; guilty of distribution of marijuana; and guilty of sexual exploitation \r\n  of a minor.  Petitioner was found not guilty of possession with intent to distribute, \r\n  but guilty of the lesser-included offense of possession of marijuana.  Petitioner \r\n  received a 20 year sentence for distribution \r\n  [2] , a consecutive five year sentence for exploitation of a minor, and \r\n  a concurrent one year sentence for possession.  \r\nPetitioner appealed the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to sentence petitioner on the \r\n  distribution charge under the accommodation statute, and the Court of Appeals \r\n  affirmed his sentence.  State v. Cobb, supra.  We granted petitionerâ€™s \r\n  petition for writ of certiorari to review this decision, and now reverse and \r\n  remand to the circuit court.  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals \r\n  err in finding that the trial court properly refused to consider the distribution \r\n  charge as an accommodation and therefore mitigate petitionerâ€™s sentence?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-460 (2002) allows a person who is \r\n  found guilty of distributing certain controlled substances, such as marijuana, \r\n  to have a hearing and \r\n\r\nif the convicted person establishes by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence that he delivered or possessed with intent to deliver a controlled \r\n  substanceâ€¦only as an accommodation to another individual and not with intent \r\n  to profit thereby nor to induce the recipientâ€¦of the controlledâ€¦substance to \r\n  use or become addicted upon the substance, the court shall sentence the person \r\n  as if he had been convicted of [simple possession].\r\n\r\nPetitioner, an adult, drove victim, a sixteen year old minor, and her girlfriend \r\n  (â€œgirlfriendâ€), a seventeen year old minor, to his home at victimâ€™s request, \r\n  because she wanted to â€œget drunk.â€  When they got to petitionerâ€™s home, petitioner \r\n  did not offer victim marijuana, but victim asked if she could smoke some of \r\n  the petitionerâ€™s marijuana.  Victim testified that petitioner did not force \r\n  victim to smoke the marijuana. Later that evening, victim and girlfriend began \r\n  â€œmaking outâ€ and petitioner took a picture of the girls having sex with each \r\n  other.  \r\nThe next day, police \r\n  took victim into custody because she was a runaway, and the victim recounted \r\n  the events of the previous night to the police.  The police obtained a search \r\n  warrant for petitionerâ€™s home and found a tin can with four ounces of marijuana \r\n  in it, as well as the photo of the nude girls.  \r\nDuring the accommodation hearing [3] , the trial judge held that this event was not \r\n  an accommodation distribution because petitioner profited by  satisfying his \r\n  prurient interests.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  holding this was not an accommodation distribution because â€œ[petitioner] benefited \r\n  from his furnishing of the marijuana to the victim because he watched the girls \r\n  undress and engage in a sexual act.  [Petitioner] also used the opportunity \r\n  to take [a] naked picture[] of the girls.â€  State v. Cobb, supra \r\n  at 128, 561 S.E.2d at 633.    We disagree with the Court of Appeals that the \r\n  phrase â€œintent to profitâ€ as used in the accommodation statute is tantamount \r\n  to â€œbenefitâ€.  \r\nThe General Assemblyâ€™s use of the phrase \r\n  â€œintent to profitâ€ clearly demonstrates it was distinguishing transactions that \r\n  are commercial in nature wherein the defendant intends to profit in a material \r\n  sense, from those of a more â€˜personalâ€™ nature [4] .  See e.g., State v. McNabb, \r\n  241 N.W.2d 32, 35 (Iowa 1976)(defining â€œprofitâ€ in Iowaâ€™s accommodation statute \r\n  as â€œthe excess of returns over expenditures in a given transaction or series \r\n  of transactionsâ€); Barlow v. Commonwealth, 494 S.E.2d 901, 905 (Ct. App. \r\n  Va. 1998)(defining â€œprofitâ€ as â€œany commercial transaction in which there is \r\n  consideration involvedâ€).  We hold that â€œintent to profitâ€ in the statute does \r\n  not mean the distributor merely received a â€œbenefit.â€  Instead the statute requires \r\n  profit in a commercial sense or a quid pro quo, as where the marijuana \r\n  is used as a medium of exchange.  If â€œintent to profitâ€ as used in the statute \r\n  means â€œbenefitâ€ as the Court of Appeals implies, the statute would be eviscerated \r\n  as â€œbenefitâ€ has a broader meaning than â€œintent to profitâ€ and would arguably \r\n  apply in any situation.\r\nIn the case at hand, the victim testified that petitioner \r\n  did not offer the marijuana to her, but rather that she asked if she could smoke \r\n  it.  The victim also testified that she did not pay petitioner for the marijuana \r\n  nor did she do anything in return for its provision.  The victim testified that \r\n  her girlfriend, initiated the kissing, and that both victim and girlfriend initiated \r\n  sex, not petitioner.  The situation presented in this case is a classic accommodation \r\n  sale.  We note that there could be situations when sex is involved in a commercial \r\n  sense, and thus a â€œprofitâ€ would be realized.  That does not apply here because \r\n  there was no agreement that the drugs were in exchange for the girls having \r\n  sex or for petitioner taking pictures of them.  Moreover, there is no evidence \r\n  that the pictures were intended for commercial use by petitioner. \r\nThe petitionerâ€™s actions, while reprehensible, fit \r\n  clearly within the General Assemblyâ€™s definition of accommodation.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.  There \r\n  is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s decision not to sentence petitioner \r\n  under the accommodation statute.  We remand the case to the circuit court to \r\n  sentence petitioner under the accommodation statute.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  BURNETT, J., dissenting \r\n  in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  I dissent.  The majority narrowly \r\n  defines â€œintent to profitâ€ as provided in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-460 (2002) \r\n  as a net commercial gain.  The majority overlooks the factual differences which \r\n  may make a distribution an accommodation in one instance but not in another. \r\nFirst, in my opinion, the majorityâ€™s limitation \r\n  of â€œintent to profitâ€ to the commercial setting defeats legislative intent.  \r\n  The majorityâ€™s citation to McNabb defining â€œprofitâ€ as â€œthe excess of \r\n  returns over expendituresâ€ dismisses other ways drug dealers may â€œprofitâ€.  \r\n  See Walker v. Commonwealth, Case No. 2974-01-4 (Va. Ct. App. Filed \r\n  March 4, 2003) available at 2003 WL 722239 (no accommodation where \r\n  man provided undercover detectives with cocaine in hopes of sharing the drugs); \r\n  Barlow v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 421, 494 S.E.2d 901 (Va. Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (denying accommodation charge where heroin dealer sold drugs at â€œcostsâ€).\r\nThe majority limits the definition of â€œintent to profitâ€ to either a benefit \r\n  of a personal nature or a profit in a commercial, material sense.  Our task \r\n  as a Court is not to divine the metaphysical distinction between those two choices, \r\n  but merely to give effect to the intent of the legislature.  State v. Ramsey, \r\n  311 S.C. 555, 561, 430 S.E.2d 511, 515 (1993).\r\nThe intent of the Legislature in enacting Â§ 44-53-460 was to differentiate \r\n  between suppliers of drugs who, while committing an illegal act, are different \r\n  from dealers who supply a drug in exchange for a tangible benefit.  While I \r\n  agree with the majority that â€œintent to profitâ€ necessarily means something \r\n  more than the distributor gained some intangible benefit from the exchange, \r\n  this case illustrates the difficulty of narrowly defining the term.  The quid \r\n  pro quo of a transaction may often be deduced, as in this case, from the \r\n  historical relationship between the parties.\r\nSecond, an attempt to strictly define â€œprofitâ€ in \r\n  this statute subverts the Legislatureâ€™s intent to differentiate \r\n  between the two types of distributors of illegal drugs. \r\nA specific definition of â€œintent to profitâ€ may provide a superficial benefit, \r\n  but only at the sacrifice of comprehensiveness explicit in the statutory language.  \r\n  It is difficult to determine, and thus define, whether a person who supplies \r\n  marijuana to another is acting in mere benevolence or with a design to obtain \r\n  some tangible benefit from the transaction.  \r\nThis Court would better discern \r\n  legislative intent by refusing to strictly define the term â€œintent to profit.â€  \r\n  Instead, we should acknowledge that whether a particular act amounts to an accommodation \r\n  is a case-specific fact inquiry.  As stated above, the quid pro quo or \r\n  the distributorâ€™s intent to profit from a transaction may be deduced by the \r\n  relationship among the parties.\r\nThe victimâ€™s testimony reveals her relationship with \r\n  Cobb.  She regularly visited his house to smoke marijuana provided by him and \r\n  would allow Cobb to take nude pictures of her.  The behavior of Cobb and the \r\n  victim on the night in question is a continuation of their historical relationship \r\n  in which the victim received illegal drugs and Cobb satisfied his prurient interests, \r\n  in exchange.\r\nThis evidence establishes Cobb did not deliver the marijuana as a mere accommodation \r\n  but intended to profit tangibly from the exchange by satisfying his prurient \r\n  interests.  See, e.g., State v. McDaniel, 265 N.W.2d 917, \r\n  927 (Iowa 1978) (Uhlenhopp, dissenting).\r\nAccordingly, I would affirm.\r\n TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-460 (2002).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Petitionerâ€™s maximum sentence exposure was enhanced \r\n    by two prior drug offenses.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Petitioner moved for an accommodation hearing \r\n    pursuant to S.C.

Curcio v. Caterpillar, Inc., 344 \r\n  S.C. 266, 543 S.E.2d 264 (Ct. App. 2001).  We granted certiorari, and now reverse. [1] \r\nFACTS [2] \r\nThe deceased was killed \r\n  while working on a track loader manufactured by respondent (â€œCATâ€).  Petitioner \r\n  alleged two bases for her strict liability claim: (1) a design defect theory \r\n  and (2) an inadequate warning theory.  The jury returned a general verdict in \r\n  the amount of $500,000 for petitioner on her strict liability claim.\r\nFollowing the verdict, \r\n  CAT moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (â€œJNOVâ€).  As to the design \r\n  defect theory, CAT argued that the alternate design proposed by petitionerâ€™s \r\n  expert would not have prevented the accident.  CAT argued that it was entitled \r\n  to a JNOV on the inadequate warning theory as well, contending the warning given \r\n  was adequate as a matter of law.  The trial judge issued an order (â€œJNOV orderâ€) \r\n  holding that the warning was adequate as a matter of law, but finding that there \r\n  was evidence to support the design defect theory.  Accordingly, CATâ€™s JNOV motion \r\n  was denied.\r\nCAT then filed a motion \r\n  to reconsider the JNOV order.  CAT argued that the finding in the JNOV order \r\n  that the warning was adequate precluded petitionerâ€™s recovery on the design \r\n  defect theory as a matter of law.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-73-10 and \r\n  -30 (1976) (adopting Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 402A and incorporating \r\n  comments to Â§ 402A as the legislative intent of the Chapter); see, e.g. \r\n  Allen v. Long Mfg. NC, Inc., 332 S.C. 422, 505 S.E.2d 354 (Ct. App. 1998) \r\n  (â€œIf a warning is given which, if followed, makes the product safe for use, \r\n  the product cannot be deemed defective or unreasonably dangerous.â€); Anderson \r\n  v. Green Bull, Inc., 322 S.C. 268, 471 S.E.2d 708 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œA product \r\n  bearing a warning that the product is safe for use if the user follows the warning \r\n  is neither defective nor unreasonably dangerous; therefore the seller is not \r\n  liable for any injuries caused by the use of the product if the user ignores \r\n  the warningâ€).  The trial court agreed, and set aside the verdict.\r\nPetitioner appealed, \r\n  and the Court of Appeals held that the verdict was properly set aside on both \r\n  theories.  Curcio v. Caterpillar, Inc., supra.\r\nISSUE\r\nWas the verdict properly set aside?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAs explained below, \r\n  we agree with Chief Judge Hearnâ€™s dissent and find that there was evidence to \r\n  support the inadequate warning verdict.  Since the jury returned a general verdict, \r\n  we need find only that there was evidence to support either the inadequate warning \r\n  theory or the design defect theory in order to reinstate that verdict.  Andersen \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highway and Public Transportation, 322 S.C. 417, \r\n  472 S.E.2d 253 (1996)(two issue rule applied to general verdict). Accordingly, \r\n  we address only the warning evidence.\r\nThe majority of the \r\n  Court of Appeals held that the JNOV on the warning theory should be upheld on \r\n  a procedural ground.  Specifically, it reviewed the trial courtâ€™s JNOV order \r\n  and extracted one sentence from that order: â€œHad the batteries been disconnected \r\n  the accident would not have happened.â€  The Court of Appealsâ€™ majority characterized \r\n  this sentence as constituting an â€œindependent groundâ€  \r\n  [3]  to support the JNOV on the warning theory.  Since the majority found \r\n  that petitioner had failed to challenge this â€œindependent groundâ€ on appeal, \r\n  the Court of Appeals upheld the JNOV on the warning theory.\r\nThere is no question \r\n  that CAT warned against working on the loaderâ€™s engine without disconnecting \r\n  the batteries first, and that had the batteries been disconnected, the accident \r\n  would not have occurred.  As Chief Judge Hearn correctly pointed out in her \r\n  dissent, however, this explicit warning was contradicted by other instructions \r\n  and warnings given by CAT.  The trial courtâ€™s observation, seized upon by the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ majority, is no doubt a true statement.  It is not, however, \r\n  dispositive of the issue before the trial judge when deciding the JNOV:  Whether \r\n  there was any evidence that the warnings, as a whole, were inadequate. The majority \r\n  of the Court of Appeals erred in relying on this mere observation by the trial \r\n  judge as an â€œindependent groundâ€ to uphold the JNOV on the warning theory.\r\nSince the case comes \r\n  before us on CATâ€™s claim of entitlement to a directed verdict/JNOV, we review \r\n  the facts in the light most favorable to Curcio.  Sabb v. South Carolina \r\n  State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d 231 (2002). In considering a JNOV, \r\n  the trial judge is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.  \r\n  When considering a JNOV, â€œneither [an appellate] court, nor the trial court \r\n  has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony \r\n  or the evidence.â€  Reiland v. Southland Equip. Serv., Inc. 330 S.C. 617, \r\n  500 S.E.2d 145 (Ct. App. 1998).  The adequacy of a warning is generally a jury \r\n  question.  See, Allen v. Long Mfg. NC, Inc., supra. The \r\n  juryâ€™s verdict must be upheld unless no evidence reasonably supports the juryâ€™s \r\n  findings.  Horry County v. Laychur, 315 S.C. 364, 434 S.E.2d 259 (1993).  \r\n\r\nCurcioâ€™s expert testified that, \r\n  although the service manual stated that the batteries should be disconnected \r\n  before any work is done on the loader, the manual also stated in various places \r\n  that the engine â€œcould be startedâ€ when the loaderâ€™s cab is tilted in the 24Â° \r\n  position.  The expert also testified that the words crank, start, and run had \r\n  different meanings, and were used with different meanings in the manual.  We \r\n  recognize that there was conflicting evidence, but note that the trial judge \r\n  is concerned with the existence of evidence, not the weight of the evidence, \r\n  or credibility of the witness. [4] \r\n    \r\nWe have reviewed the record and \r\n  agree with Chief Judge Hearn that the trial judge improperly weighed the evidence \r\n  rather than merely considering its existence in granting CATâ€™s JNOV motion on \r\n  the inadequate warning theory. We therefore\r\nREVERSE.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, \r\n  WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We reinstate the jury award, subject to an unappealed \r\n    order requiring a new trial on the issue whether petitioner was the common \r\n    law wife of the deceased.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  A full exposition of the facts and procedural \r\n    history of this case can be found in the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, \r\n    338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  E.g., in the JNOV Order, the trial judge stated \r\n    that â€œ[a]lthough not essential for purposes of this ruling, I note that Mr. \r\n    Warren has absolutely no experience with heavy equipment.  Conversely, all \r\n    witnesses with such experience understood the term â€˜startâ€™ to include any \r\n    notion that the engine was to be â€˜turned-overâ€™ by the electrical starter motor.â€  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
