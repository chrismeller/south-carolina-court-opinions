Â In April 2003, the\r\n  Hospital, pursuant to the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (HCQIA)\r\n  found at 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 11101-52, filed a report regarding Dr. Wieters's status\r\n  with the National Practitioners Data Bank (NPDB).[2]Â \r\n  In November 2004, Dr. Wieters filed the underlying action in state court.[3]Â \r\n  The Hospital's Answer presented many affirmative defenses, including immunity\r\n  under the HCQIA for any statement reported to the NPDB.Â  In December 2004,\r\n  Appellants removed the case to federal court for the first time under 28\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§ 1441(b),[4] alleging Dr. Wieters's &quot;right to relief necessarily depends upon\r\n  resolution of a substantial question of federal law.&quot;Â  Dr. Wieters filed a\r\n  Motion to Remand, asserting the Complaint alleged only state causes of action,\r\n  and the Hospital could not defend its way into federal court.Â  United States\r\n  District Court Judge Weston Houck granted Dr. Wieters's motion to remand in\r\n  January 2005. Â Five years of discovery and mediation ensued.Â  In 2009, the case\r\n  was assigned to the Charleston County State Court multi-week docket, and a\r\n  detailed scheduling order was issued setting the trial date for March 8, 2010. Â In\r\n  early 2010, the defendants at trial filed Motions for Summary Judgment, and the\r\n  court denied the motions of the Hospital and four senior executives (defendants\r\n  Carroll, Ellison, Deal, and Kelley).Â  \r\nThe state court trial was\r\n  re-scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. on March 2, 2010.Â  In his February 8 Memo in\r\n  Opposition to the Motions for Summary Judgment, Dr. Wieters disputed the\r\n  Hospital's alleged immunity under the HCQIA, stating at several points that the\r\n  HCQIA expressly allows defamation suits, and further referenced the HCQIA. Â The\r\n  trial judge denied the Hospital's motion for summary judgment.Â  On March 1, Dr.\r\n  Wieters filed his Pretrial Brief and Proposed Jury Instructions, all of which again\r\n  stated the HCQIA allows for suit when party knowingly makes false statements to\r\n  the NPDB. \r\nOn the morning of March 2,\r\n  2010, three hours before the trial was scheduled to begin, Appellants removed\r\n  the case to the federal district court for the second time, relying upon Dr.\r\n  Wieters's Pretrial Brief filed the evening before.Â  Appellants claimed the\r\n  Pretrial Brief, along with the jury instructions and February 8 Memo in\r\n  Opposition to the Motions for Summary Judgment, constituted &quot;other\r\n  paper&quot; under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1446(b).[5]Â \r\n  This &quot;other paper,&quot; they claimed, indicated that Dr. Wieters was\r\n  bringing a case under the HCQIA, thereby making removable a previously\r\n  non-removable case.Â  Thus, Appellants' argument went, Dr. Wieters presented a\r\n  question of federal law by referencing the HCQIA, and removal then was proper.Â \r\n  State Circuit Court Judge Baxley held a hearing at 2 p.m. on March 2 to\r\n  question the Appellants regarding the removal and to make clear that if the\r\n  case was remanded back to the jurisdiction of the state court, Appellants could\r\n  expect sanctions for its misbehavior in waiting until the last minute before\r\n  trial to remove the case again when Appellants had the information regarding\r\n  Dr. Wieters's references to the HCQIA since early February and the grounds for\r\n  removal were the same as in 2004.\r\nAs Judge Baxley expected,\r\n  United States District Court Judge Houck remanded the case to state court on\r\n  March 18, 2010.Â  Judge Houck explained in his Order that the Complaint does not\r\n  state a federal question, nor can one be inferred, and the Complaint has never\r\n  been amended since his original remand order in 2005.Â  Further, he stated\r\n  whether the HCQIA creates a private right of action such that Dr. Wieters could\r\n  bring a claim under the HCQIA has not been determined by the Fourth Circuit\r\n  Court of Appeals, but that the First, Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuit\r\n  Courts of Appeals have all determined that it does not.Â  Judge Houck noted the\r\n  Hospital raised federal law as a defense, and that is insufficient to create\r\n  federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 to justify removal.Â  Judge\r\n  Houck found that &quot;[b]ecause a potential defense will not support federal\r\n  question jurisdiction under Section 1331, it follows that federal question\r\n  jurisdiction will not obtain by a mere reference to the HCQIA&quot; in the\r\n  filing relied upon by the Hospital.\r\nAs promised, Judge Baxley\r\n  issued a Notice of Sanctions Hearing on March 24 for the Appellants to show\r\n  cause as to why sanctions should not be ordered &quot;for delaying the trial of\r\n  this case by frivolously filing for removal to the Federal Court on the morning\r\n  of the day this jury trial was to begin.&quot;Â  Dr. Wieters filed for Rule 11\r\n  sanctions the following day, requesting reasonable expenses and attorneys'\r\n  fees.Â  The sanctions hearing was held on April 19, 2010, and Judge Baxley\r\n  issued his Order for Sanctions on July 1.Â  In his Order, Judge Baxley found the\r\n  Hospital's second removal was based upon the same grounds as the first removal,\r\n  was without merit, and was interposed solely for delay.Â  In ordering the\r\n  sanctions, Judge Baxley considered the complexity of the multi-week docket and\r\n  the difficulty and expense involved in cancelling one case and calling\r\n  another.Â  He appeared particularly perturbed by the inference that Appellants\r\n  had been considering removal since Dr. Wieters filed his February 8 Memo in\r\n  Opposition, and that the hassle and expense could have been avoided if\r\n  Appellants had been upfront with the court regarding its intentions to remove a\r\n  second time.[6]Â  \r\nThe sanctions ordered totaled\r\n  roughly $68,000.00 and are summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n   $53,685.65 for lost income to Dr.\r\n  Wieters, trial costs and fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees;[7]\r\n    \r\n   $6,313.00 payable to the SouthÂ \r\n  Carolina Judicial Department to reimburse the cost of the salary and benefits of\r\n  Judge Baxley, his law clerk, and the court reporter for being unable to operate\r\n  the week for which trial was scheduled;\r\n  \r\n   $5,000.00 to the Access to Justice\r\n  Commission for denying the public access to the court during the scheduled\r\n  trial week, along with a letter to Executive Director Robin Wheeler explaining\r\n  the reason for the payment;\r\n  \r\n   $2,550.00 to the Charleston County\r\n  Clerk of Court to reimburse the cost of summoning and administering the jury\r\n  panel for that week; and\r\n  \r\n   $50.00 to each juror for the\r\n  inconvenience they suffered, along with a letter of apology and explanation.\r\n\r\nAppellants appeal those\r\n  sanctions beyond the lost income, costs, and fees, arguing a good faith removal\r\n  to federal court cannot be the basis for sanctions, and that the trial judge\r\n  abused his discretion in the order of sanctions.\r\nIssues\r\nAppellants\r\n  present the following issues for review:\r\n I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can removal be the basis for an\r\n  order of sanctions?\r\n II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial judge abuse his\r\n  discretion in ordering sanctions?\r\nStandard of Review\r\nA trial court may impose\r\n  sanctions on a party, a party's attorney, or both for filing a pleading, motion,\r\n  or other paper to cause delay or when no good grounds exist to support the\r\n  filing.Â  See Rule 11, SCRCP; Runyon v. Wright, 322 S.C. 15, 19,\r\n  471 S.E.2d 160, 162 (1996).Â  &quot;A court imposing sanctions under Rule 11\r\n  should, in its order, describe the conduct determined to constitute a violation\r\n  of the Rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed.&quot;Â  Runyon,\r\n  322 S.C. at 19, 471 S.E.2d at 162.Â  When reviewing judge's order of sanctions,\r\n  the appellate court takes its own view of the facts.Â  Father v. S.C. Dep't\r\n  of Soc. Servs., 353 S.C. 254, 260-61, 578 S.E.2d 11, 14 (2003).Â \r\n  &quot;[W]here the appellate court agrees with the trial court's findings of fact,\r\n  it reviews the decision to award sanctions, as well as the terms of those\r\n  sanctions, under an abuse of discretion standard.&quot;Â  Id. at 261, 578\r\n  S.E.2d at 14.Â  An abuse of discretion may be found if the trial court's\r\n  conclusions lack reasonable factual support.Â  Runyon, 322 S.C. at 19,\r\n  471 S.E.2d at 162.Â  Â  \r\nAnalysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Ability to Sanction\r\nAppellants argue they should\r\n  not have been sanctioned for the second removal because it was done in good\r\n  faith.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nRule 11 states, \r\nThe\r\n  signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him that he has\r\n  read the pleading, motion or other paper; that to the best of his knowledge,\r\n  information and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not\r\n  interposed for delay.\r\n\r\nRule 11, SCRCP.Â  A trial\r\n  court may impose sanctions on a party, a party's attorney, or both for filing a\r\n  pleading, motion, or other paper to cause delay or when no good grounds exist\r\n  to support the filing.Â  See Runyon, 322 S.C. at 19, 471 S.E.2d at\r\n  162.Â  The sanctions may include: an order to pay the reasonable costs and\r\n  attorneys' fees incurred by the party defending against the action brought in\r\n  bad faith; a reasonable fine to be paid to the court; a reasonable monetary\r\n  penalty to the party defending the action brought in bad faith; or a directive\r\n  of a nonmonetary nature designed to deter the party or the party's attorney\r\n  from bringing any future action in bad faith.Â  Id. Â \r\nWe agree with both Judge\r\n  Baxley's version of the facts and his conclusion that the second removal was not\r\n  based on good grounds and was interposed solely for delay. While Rule 11 is\r\n  evaluated by a subjective standard,[8] the rule still may be violated with a filing that is so patently without merit\r\n  that no reasonable attorney could have a good faith belief in its propriety.Â \r\n  We find such is the case here.Â  Regarding the grounds for removal, first, it is\r\n  clear that although Appellants cite different federal statutes to support their\r\n  2004 and 2010 removals, the underlying reason for both removals remains the\r\n  sameâ€”Appellants' alleged defense under the HCQIA.Â  The fact that they relied\r\n  upon 2010 documents for their second removal does not change the reality that\r\n  they were attempting to remove primarily because of their asserted defense\r\n  under the HCQIA.Â  Second, as Judge Houck noted, removal is based upon the\r\n  claims alleged in the initial pleading.Â  Dr. Wieters's complaint alleged a\r\n  state law defamation claim, not a federal cause of action, and he never amended\r\n  his pleading.Â  As a defense, Appellants asserted the HCQIA provided absolute\r\n  immunity from tort liability for defamation, and any reference Dr. Wieters's later\r\n  made to the HCQIA was in response to that defense.Â  Dr. Wieters simply asserted\r\n  the HCQIA permitted the state law claim, meaning that it was not preempted or\r\n  barred by the HCQIA, not that the HCQIA created an individual cause of action\r\n  under which they were bringing the suit.Â  Viewing all the pleadings and papers\r\n  in context of each other and the lengthy history of this litigation, we find\r\n  Appellants could not have formed a good faith belief the second removal was\r\n  appropriate.Â  We will not approve attorneys engaging in semantic games with the\r\n  courts and allow artful crafting of &quot;new&quot; grounds for removal when no\r\n  evidence exists to support a subjective belief that the plaintiff was asserting\r\n  a federal cause of action.Â  \r\nAs to the delay, Appellants\r\n  were first aware of Dr. Wieters's references to the HCQIA in early February\r\n  when they received the Memo in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment.Â  Even\r\n  when Appellants received the pretrial brief and jury instructions the evening\r\n  before the trial, they did not bring to the court the question of whether the\r\n  filings created a basis for removal; instead, they sought the advice of a\r\n  practicing member of the Bar and a law professor on the removability question.Â \r\n  Appellants waited until mere hours before the commencement of the multi-week\r\n  jury trial before filing for removal.Â  Judge Baxley characterized this action\r\n  as &quot;a thinly veiled effort at a continuance.&quot;Â  We agree with Judge\r\n  Baxley's assessment.Â  We do not suggest that Appellants were under an\r\n  obligation to seek clarification from the court before filing for removal.Â \r\n  However, Appellants continually contend the lateness of their removal was a\r\n  result of not learning of Dr. Wieters's references to the HCQIA until the\r\n  eleventh hour.Â  This was simply not the case as they had received nearly\r\n  identical language in the February 8 memo almost a month before receiving the\r\n  proposed jury instructions and pretrial brief.Â  Â \r\nWe take this opportunity to\r\n  state definitively that vexatious removal is sanctionable conduct, and parties\r\n  will be held accountable for the unnecessary expense and delay caused by abuses\r\n  of the right to removal.[9]Â \r\n  We want to make clear that we do not intend to chill a defendant's exercise of\r\n  its removal rights, and we are cognizant that a defendant may remove a case up\r\n  to the very minute before trial.Â  We note that Appellants in this case are not\r\n  being sanctioned for removing at the last minuteâ€”Appellants' behavior goes far beyond\r\n  simply exercising their right to remove a case to federal court.Â  A finding of\r\n  vexatious removal should be rare, but the case before us is an extreme one, and\r\n  the coalescence of all the facts merit appropriate sanctions.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find Judge Baxley did not err in ordering sanctions against Appellants.\r\n II. Propriety of the Sanctions\r\nAs explained in Runyon v.\r\n  Wright, a trial judge has wide discretion in ordering sanctions.Â  Judge\r\n  Baxley found Appellants' second removal attempt to be reprehensible and an\r\n  improper delay tactic that cost the court system and the other party\r\n  significant resources, time, and money.Â  For that reason, Judge Baxley imposed\r\n  stiff sanctions.Â  While the unappealed portion of the ordered sanctions are standard\r\n  and appropriate, we find the sanctions appealed from exceed the bounds of a\r\n  judge's discretion.\r\nThe award to the other party of\r\n  its detailed, itemized costs and fees incurred as a result of the improper\r\n  removal plainly is allowed under the express language of Rule 11, SCRCP.Â  However,\r\n  we find Judge Baxley abused his discretion in going beyond the conventional\r\n  awards of costs and fees when he required Appellants to reimburse the South\r\n  Carolina Judicial Department for the cost of the court's salary and benefits\r\n  for the week it was unable to proceed with the scheduled trial, to reimburse\r\n  the Charleston County Clerk of Court for the expense it incurred in summoning\r\n  and administering the jury panel, to pay $5,000.00 to the Access to Justice\r\n  Commission with a letter of apology to Robin Wheeler, and to pay $50.00 to each\r\n  juror with a letter of apology.Â  Accordingly, we reverse those sanctions.\r\nConclusion\r\nUnder the specific facts of\r\n  this case, we find Appellants' second attempt at removal to be sanctionable.Â \r\n  Further, the appealed sanctions were an abuse of the trial judge's discretion.Â \r\n  Therefore, we affirm Judge Baxley's order as modified to remove the sanctions\r\n  not relating to reimbursing the other party for its costs and fees.Â  \r\nBEATTY and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.Â \r\n  HEARN, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur but write separately as I would find no\r\n  sanctionable conduct here. [10]Â \r\n  I agree with Justice Hearn that these appellants had a good faith basis for\r\n  removing this case in March 2010.Â  I disagree with both the majority and with\r\n  Justice Hearn, however, that it was appellants' burden to take further action\r\n  after receiving Dr. Wieters' February 8 &quot;Memo in Opposition to the Motion\r\n  for Summary Judgment.&quot;Â  Moreover, having received opinions on March 2 from\r\n  three attorneys and a law professor that the new assertions in Dr. Weiters'\r\n  Pre-Trial Brief, filed at 11:48 pm on March 1, rendered the case removable,\r\n  appellants timely filed this removal motion at 1:07 pm on March 2.Â  In my\r\n  opinion, the delay occasioned by this request for removal, while inconvenient,\r\n  is no more than that attendant to any such removal, and therefore I find no\r\n  evidence it was interposed for delay.\r\nI concur in the majority's\r\n  decision to reverse all sanctions challenged in this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  HEARN:Â  I concur in the result reached by the majority.Â  I wholeheartedly\r\n  agree with the majority's statement that vexatious removal can warrant\r\n  sanctions, and I agree that the sanctions before us on appeal should be\r\n  reversed.Â  While I further agree with the finding that the second removal was\r\n  interposed for delay, it is my opinion that Appellants had a good faith belief\r\n  in the legal underpinnings of the second removal.\r\nIn my view, the majority places too much emphasis on\r\n  the original pleadings filed in this case.Â  All parties agree that based on the\r\n  district court's resolution of the original removal, the complaint itself does\r\n  not raise questions of federal law.Â  However, removal is not always &quot;based\r\n  upon the claims alleged in the initial pleading&quot;; 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1446(b)\r\n  specifically permits removal &quot;[i]f the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable&quot; and it later becomes removable based on an\r\n  &quot;amended pleading, motion, order or other paper.&quot; (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  At this juncture, we must therefore examine Appellants' belief that\r\n  these other papers stated a federal question, not whether the complaint\r\n  implicated questions of federal law.\r\nIn 2004, Appellants' removal was premised upon the\r\n  necessity of resolving substantial questions of federal law raised by a state\r\n  law cause of action, not traditional federal question jurisdiction.[11]Â \r\n  The district court remanded this matter because the only federal questions\r\n  raised related to Appellants' defenses.Â  However, Appellants did remove\r\n  specifically on the basis of pure federal question jurisdiction in 2010.[12]Â \r\n  Although the complaint itself only raised state law claims, Appellants relied\r\n  on section 1446(b) to remove based on Dr. Wieters' submissions to the circuit\r\n  court in the weeks leading up to trial.Â  Appellants accordingly removed because\r\n  these other papersâ€”the memorandum, pre-trial brief, and proposed jury\r\n  instructions stating that the HCQIA grants &quot;explicit authority&quot; for\r\n  his claims and even preempts certain areas of state lawâ€”purported to raise a\r\n  federal law-based claim.Â  Thus, contrary to the view of the circuit court and\r\n  accepted by the majority, Appellants did not seek to remove on the same grounds\r\n  in 2010 as they did in 2004.Â  Furthermore, the second removal was not based on\r\n  Appellants' defenses, but rather on Dr. Wieters' statements that he was\r\n  bringing his claims under the explicit authority of federal law.\r\nGiven the statements contained in Dr. Wieters' filings\r\n  and the advice Appellants sought from their general counsel, counsel for their\r\n  insurance company, a law professor, and a highly respected local attorney, I\r\n  believe the only reasonably conclusion is that Appellants had a good faith\r\n  basis for removal in 2010.Â  Based on the record before the Court, it is purely\r\n  conjectural to conclude otherwise.Â  Additionally, in my opinion the removal was\r\n  not based on frivolous grounds but rather on the novel issue within the Fourth\r\n  Circuit of whether the HCQIA provides for an independent cause of action.Â  The\r\n  fact that the district court predicted the Fourth Circuit would not find a\r\n  private cause of action has no bearing on Appellants' subjective beliefs. Â Therefore,\r\n  this is not a situation with &quot;attorneys engaging in semantic games with\r\n  the courts&quot; but rather attorneys paying close attention to arguments made\r\n  by their adversaries during litigation.Â  While this undoubtedly is a fine line\r\n  to walk, the record before us in this case convinces me that Appellants had a\r\n  good faith belief in the grounds supporting the second removal. \r\nHowever, I agree with the circuit court's conclusion\r\n  that the removal was interposed for delay. Â I too wish to reiterate that a defendant\r\n  generally has a right to remove a case up to the start of trial.Â  Holding\r\n  otherwise would undoubtedly chill the statutory right a defendant has to remove\r\n  a case to federal court.Â  The record shows Appellants received notice of Dr.\r\n  Wieters' arguments knowing full well that the trial had a date certain set less\r\n  than one month away.Â  Moreover, Appellants could and should have sought\r\n  clarification from Dr. Wieters or taken some other action to determine whether\r\n  he was raising a federal question before receiving the additional filings on\r\n  the eve of trial.Â  Given the impending date certain for trial, there certainly\r\n  were steps Appellants could have taken to ameliorate the inevitable delay their\r\n  removal would cause.Â  Because they did not do so in spite of this knowledge, I\r\n  do not believe the circuit court abused its discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Allen P. Carroll, the Administrator of the Hospital; William B. Ellison, Jr,\r\n  M.D., the President of the Professional Staff; Jeffrey M. Deal, M.D., the\r\n  President of the Professional Staff following Dr. Ellison; and Sharron C.\r\n  Kelley, the Medical Staff Coordinator; Pennie Peralta, Senior Nurse Executive;\r\n  and Esther Lerman Freeman, M.D., a mental health professional, were also named\r\n  defendants. \r\n[2] Dr. Wieters was also suspended from Roper Hospital for similar behavior.Â  He\r\n  filed a similar suit against Roper Hospital after Roper Hospital posted a\r\n  report with the NPDB.Â  The trial court granted Roper Hospital's motion for\r\n  summary judgment. \r\n[3] The underlying action does not contest the suspension, only the content and\r\n  publication of the report with the NPDB.\r\n[4] This statute reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nAny civil action of which the\r\n  district courts have original jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising\r\n  under the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States shall be\r\n  removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties.\r\n\r\n[5] This statute reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIf the case stated by the initial\r\n  pleading is not removable, a notice of removal may be filed within thirty days\r\n  after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of an\r\n  amended pleading, motion, order or other paper from which it may first be\r\n  ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable . . . .\r\n\r\n[6] This inference arises from William Cleveland's affidavit, which states\r\n  Appellants &quot;said that the first time such arguments [allegedly supporting\r\n  removal] had been made were in Plaintiff's memorandum in opposition to a motion\r\n  for summary judgment&quot; filed in February.Â  Thus, Appellants were not\r\n  blindsided by the references to the HCQIA the night before trial, but had been\r\n  aware of Dr. Wieters' position for nearly one month.\r\n[7] These sanctions have been resolved separately by the parties and are not at\r\n  issue in this appeal.\r\n[8] Prior to its 1983 amendment, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\r\n  provided a subjective standard for determining whether an attorney's actions\r\n  violated the rule.Â  The amendment, however, changed it to an objective\r\n  standard.Â  See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 47 (1991)\r\n  (recognizing the change from a subjective standard to an objective standard\r\n  with the 1983 amendment to Rule 11).Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure, however, did not undergo a similar amendment.Â  The notes to the rule\r\n  demonstrate that the subjective standard has not been changed.Â  Rule 11, SCRCP\r\n  note (&quot;This version of Rule 11(a) is not nearly so stringent as the latest\r\n  version of the Federal Rule which became effective August 1, 1983.&quot;)Â  \r\n[9] Several other jurisdictions have upheld sanctions for improper and abusive\r\n  removals.Â  See ITT Indus.

Knobel, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 27017\r\nSubmitted June 22, 2011 - Filed August 1,\r\n  2011Â Â \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nBrian\r\n  A. DiMarco, of Greenville, pro se, Petitioner\r\nKim\r\n  R. Varner, of Varner &amp; Segura, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  TOAL: Brian A. DiMarco (Petitioner)\r\n  sought a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision that\r\n  affirmed as modified the family court's contempt order against him.Â  We reverse\r\n  the court of appeals because the sanction ordered by the family court violates\r\n  Petitioner's rights under the Sixth Amendment of the United States\r\n  Constitution.\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nPetitioner was subject to a\r\n  court order to make monthly child support payments to Cheryl A. DiMarco\r\n  (Mother).Â  According to Petitioner, he had made child support payments for over\r\n  ten years before Mother filed for an increase in 2006.Â  The family court instead\r\n  decreased the support order and ordered the payments be made through the court\r\n  beginning on April 1, 2008.Â  Petitioner asserts he timely attempted to make the\r\n  first payment to the court, but the court lacked record of the order and could\r\n  not accept the payment.\r\nOn May 13, 2008, the clerk of\r\n  the family court filed a Rule to Show Cause because Petitioner was behind on\r\n  his child support payments.Â Â Â  The hearing was scheduled for June 25, 2008, at\r\n  nine o'clock in the morning.Â  On June 23, 2008, Petitioner paid the arrearage,\r\n  bringing his child support account to a zero balance. \r\nOn the morning of June 25,\r\n  Petitioner did not appear on time for the Rule to Show Cause hearing before\r\n  Judge Johnson.Â  Accordingly, Judge Johnson issued a warrant for Petitioner's\r\n  arrest.Â  No testimony was taken on whether or not Petitioner had failed to pay\r\n  child support.Â  Shortly thereafter, Petitioner arrived at the courthouse.Â \r\n  Because Judge Johnson discovered he and Petitioner were members of the same\r\n  Rotary Club, Judge Johnson asked Judge Knobel to preside over the hearing.Â  \r\nDuring the hearing before\r\n  Judge Knobel, everyone who spoke noted Petitioner did not owe any outstanding\r\n  child support at that time: the clerk of court (&quot;Our records show that he\r\n  has a zero balance at this time.&quot;), Mother's attorney (&quot;I understand\r\n  that since then he did pay the correct amount.Â  So I don't think there's any\r\n  dispute.&quot;), Judge Knobel (&quot;I know you have a zero balance at this\r\n  time.&quot;), and Petitioner.Â  During his argument, Mother's attorney stated,\r\n  &quot;I think the court needs to very much impress upon him taking the law into\r\n  his own hands and not showing up, not being here on time it's just, just it's\r\n  driving everyone nuts.&quot; \r\n\r\nFrom the bench, Judge Knobel\r\n  gave the following order:\r\nThe\r\n  sentence is going to be 12 months, it'll be civil contempt I will suspend that\r\n  he is to have a $250.00 court cost that'll be due by July 11th. Â We'll let him\r\n  out of detention at this point in time.\r\n\r\nHis written order also\r\n  indicates a twelve month suspended confinement and $250.00 in court costs\r\n  payable no later than July 11, 2008.Â  The court of appeals affirmed as\r\n  modified, holding Petitioner was sentenced to twelve months incarceration,\r\n  suspended upon his payment of $250.00 in court costs.Â  We granted a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review that decision.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nA finding of contempt rests\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Durlach v. Durlach, 359\r\n  S.C. 64, 70, 596 S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004) (citation omitted).Â  Such a finding\r\n  should not be disturbed on appeal unless it is unsupported by the evidence or\r\n  the judge has abused his discretion.Â  Id.Â  Â Â \r\nAnalysis\r\nPetitioner argues the court\r\n  of appeals erred in affirming as modified the family court's contempt order.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nCivil contempt must be shown\r\n  by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 113,\r\n  502 S.E.2d 86, 89 (1998). Criminal contempt must be shown beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.Â  Id.Â  In determining whether a contempt sanction is criminal or\r\n  civil, one must identify the purpose for which the sanction is imposed.Â \r\n  Whereas civil contempt is either coercive or remedial in nature, criminal\r\n  contempt is purely punitive.Â  Id. at 111, 502 S.E.2d at 88.Â \r\n  Incarceration may be either civil or criminal.Â  Id. at 112, 502 S.E.2d\r\n  at 89.Â  The distinguishing factor is whether the incarceration is for a\r\n  definite period of time, which is the hallmark of criminal contempt, or whether\r\n  the contemnor may avoid or cut short the incarceration by complying with the\r\n  court's directive, which indicates civil contempt.Â  Id.Â  The difference\r\n  between the two is substantial because the constitutional safeguards provided\r\n  in the Sixth Amendment[1] may be triggered in criminal contempt proceedings.Â  A contemnor has a\r\n  constitutional right to a jury trial before a criminal sentence of more than\r\n  six months incarceration may be imposed.Â  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377,\r\n  385, 287 S.E.2d 915, 919 (1982).Â  \r\nJudge Knobel, as the court of\r\n  appeals noted, stated he intended to hold Petitioner in civil contempt, not\r\n  criminal contempt.Â  The court of appeals said &quot;the family court's contempt\r\n  sanction has elements of both civil and criminal contempt.&quot;Â  DiMarco v.\r\n  DiMarco, Op. No. 2010-UP-289 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 24, 2010).Â  The civil\r\n  element of the sanction, the court found, was that the incarceration would not\r\n  be imposed unless Petitioner failed to pay the $250.00 to the court.Â  The criminal\r\n  element was that if Petitioner failed to pay the $250.00, he would be\r\n  incarcerated for a definite period of time.Â  To remedy the family court's\r\n  unclear sanction, the court of appeals modified the order and held Petitioner\r\n  must pay the $250.00 in court costs, and if he failed to do so by the deadline\r\n  established, then he would be incarcerated for twelve months.Â  In doing so, the\r\n  court of appeals crafted a sanction that violates Petitioner's Sixth Amendment\r\n  rights.\r\nWe disagree with the court of\r\n  appeals that the ordered sanction had elements of both civil and criminal\r\n  contempt.Â  A sanction is either civil or criminal; it cannot be both because\r\n  they serve different purposes.Â  A judge certainly may order both a civil and a\r\n  criminal contempt sanction, and, in that case, the sanctions should be separate\r\n  and distinct.Â  That is not what the family court judge did in this case.Â  The\r\n  ordered sanction was purely punitive in nature as Petitioner was in full\r\n  compliance with the support order and there was no necessary act to be\r\n  compelled through the contempt sanction.Â  \r\nThe $250.00 in court costs,\r\n  ostensibly for appearing late to the first Rule to Show Cause hearing that day,\r\n  was an allowable criminal contempt sanction because it punished Petitioner for\r\n  his tardiness and lack of respect for the court.Â  The fine itself, in that\r\n  regard, is unobjectionable.Â  However, ordering a definite twelve month\r\n  incarceration if Petitioner failed to pay the court costs on time violates\r\n  Petitioner's right to a jury trial.Â  Curlee, 277 S.C. at 385, 287 S.E.2d\r\n  at 919.\r\nWhen incarceration is for a\r\n  definite period of time and the contemnor may not purge the contempt by\r\n  compliance with a court order, it is criminal incarceration and may trigger the\r\n  protections of the Sixth Amendment.Â  The court of appeals recognized the\r\n  incarceration was for a definite period of time, but attempted to introduce a\r\n  civil contempt element by saying Petitioner could avoid the sentence altogether\r\n  by paying the court costs as ordered.Â  There is no doubt Petitioner could avoid\r\n  the incarceration by paying the costs, but clearly any litigant can avoid\r\n  further sanctions by simple compliance.Â  The problem with this order is that his\r\n  noncompliance would trigger a twelve month, definite, non-purgeable\r\n  incarceration, and our law requires Petitioner be afforded a jury trial before\r\n  receiving such a sentence.Â  The trial transcript is clear that Petitioner was\r\n  not allowed a jury trial, nor was he allowed to have his attorney present.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the above reasons, we\r\n  reverse the court of appeals' decision and the ordered sanctions.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

Labor Finders of South Carolina, 384\r\n  S.C. 21, 682 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2009). Â We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employment\r\n  History\r\nPetitioner began\r\n  working for respondent in respondent's Charleston office around 1990.Â  During\r\n  petitioner's employment, respondent planned to open a second office location in\r\n  the Charleston area and informed petitioner she would be promoted to regional sales\r\n  manager for both Charleston locations.Â  In 2004, petitioner signed an agreement\r\n  acknowledging her status as an at-will employee and setting her compensation as\r\n  &quot;straight commission&quot; of 3% of customer payments deposited and posted\r\n  by both Charleston offices each week, to be paid within ninety days of the\r\n  invoice date. \r\nThe second\r\n  Charleston office opened in September 2004 and began earning income that\r\n  November.Â  In January of the following year, petitioner became concerned that\r\n  respondent had not paid her the full amount of commissions she had earned.Â \r\n  Petitioner relayed her concerns and subsequently met with her supervisor to\r\n  discuss the matter.Â  During the meeting, petitioner showed the supervisor a\r\n  copy of the compensation agreement, of which the supervisor was previously\r\n  unaware.Â  The supervisor contacted respondent's owner, who acknowledged that,\r\n  due to an oversight, he forgot to pay petitioner the commissions from the new\r\n  Charleston location.Â  Petitioner never filed a written complaint with the Department\r\n  of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, as outlined by the Payment of Wages Act (&quot;the\r\n  Act&quot;).[1]Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  terminated petitioner's employment the next day, stating it was forced to\r\n  downsize in light of recent budget cuts.Â  Eight or nine days later, respondent\r\n  issued petitioner a check in excess of the amount she was owed for commissions.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procedural\r\n  History\r\nPetitioner\r\n  instituted this action, alleging violations of the Act, breach of contract,\r\n  breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and wrongful termination in\r\n  violation of public policy.Â  The\r\n  circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent as to all causes\r\n  of action.Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  appealed the entry of summary judgment as to her wrongful termination claim.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of\r\n  Appeals err in affirming the circuit court's grant of summary judgment as to\r\n  petitioner's wrongful termination claim?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing\r\n  the grant of summary judgment, appellate courts apply the same standard applied\r\n  by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350\r\n  S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when the\r\n  pleadings, depositions, affidavits and discovery on file show there is no\r\n  genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  Id.; Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any\r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Fleming, supra.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues\r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in holding she could not maintain a wrongful\r\n  termination claim under the public policy exception to the at-will employment\r\n  doctrine.Â  While we agree the Court of Appeals erred in its analysis, we\r\n  nonetheless affirm as modified.\r\nIn South\r\n  Carolina, employment at-will is presumed absent the creation of a specific\r\n  contract of employment.Â  Mathis v. Brown &amp; Brown of S.C., Inc., 389\r\n  S.C. 299, 310, 698 S.E.2d 773, 778 (2010).Â  An at-will employee may be\r\n  terminated at any time for any reason or for no reason, with or without cause.Â  Id.Â  Under the &quot;public policy exception&quot; to the at-will\r\n  employment doctrine, however, an at-will employee has a cause of action in tort\r\n  for wrongful termination where there is a retaliatory termination of the at-will\r\n  employee in violation of a clear mandate of public policy.Â  Ludwick v. This\r\n  Minute of Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 337 S.E.2d 213 (1985).Â  The public\r\n  policy exception clearly applies in cases where either:Â  (1) the employer\r\n  requires the employee to violate the law, Ludwick, supra, or (2)\r\n  the reason for the employee's termination itself is a violation of criminal\r\n  law.Â  Culler v. Blue Ridge Elec. Co-op., Inc., 309 S.C. 243, 422 S.E.2d\r\n  91 (1992) (employee was terminated after he refused to contribute to political\r\n  action fund, and his termination violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§16-17-560).\r\nWhile the public\r\n  policy exception applies to situations where an employer requires an employee\r\n  to violate the law or the reason for the termination itself is a violation of\r\n  criminal law, the public policy exception is not limited to these situations.Â  See Garner v. Morrison Knudsen Corp., 318 S.C. 223, 456 S.E.2d 907 (1995); Kieger\r\n  v. Citgo, Coastal Petroleum, Inc., 326 S.C. 369, 482 S.E.2d 792 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997).Â  In both of these cases, the courts declined to address whether the\r\n  public policy exception applied because, in their procedural posture, it was\r\n  not appropriate to decide the novel issue without further developing the facts\r\n  of the case.Â  Garner, 318 S.C. at 227, 456 S.E.2d at 910 n.3 (appeal\r\n  from a grant of a 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss); Kieger, 326 S.C.\r\n  at 373, 482 S.E.2d at 794 (same).Â  Both cases make clear, however, that an\r\n  at-will employee may have a cause of action for wrongful termination even if\r\n  the discharge itself did not violate criminal law or the employer did not\r\n  require the employee to violate the law.\r\nThe public policy\r\n  exception does not, however, extend to situations where the employee has an\r\n  existing statutory remedy for wrongful termination.Â  See Dockins v.\r\n  Ingles Markets, Inc., 306 S.C. 496, 413 S.E.2d 18 (1992) (employee\r\n  allegedly terminated in retaliation for filing complaint under Fair Labor\r\n  Standards Act had existing statutory remedy for wrongful termination); see also Epps v. Clarendon County, 304 S.C. 424, 405 S.E.2d 386) (1991) (employee had an\r\n  existing remedy for wrongful termination under Title 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983).Â  \r\nHere, relying\r\n  largely on Lawson v. S.C. Dep't of Corrections, 340 S.C. 346, 532 S.E.2d\r\n  259 (2000), the Court of Appeals held the public policy exception did not apply\r\n  as petitioner was not asked to violate the law and the reason for her\r\n  termination itself was not a violation of criminal law.Â  Barron, at 28,\r\n  682 S.E.2d at 274.Â  We find the Court of Appeals misread Lawson as\r\n  limiting the public policy exception to these two situations.Â  In Lawson,\r\n  we determined the employee could not establish a claim for wrongful termination\r\n  under the public policy exception where the employee alleged he was terminated\r\n  in retaliation for reporting hiring policy violations under the Whistleblower\r\n  statute.Â  Although we initially noted the employee's allegations did not\r\n  support a wrongful termination claim as he was not asked to violate the law and\r\n  his termination itself did not violate the criminal law, we ultimately found\r\n  the public policy exception did not apply because the employee was limited to\r\n  the existing statutory remedy for wrongful termination provided by the\r\n  Whistleblower statute.Â  Lawson, at 350, 532 S.E.2d at 261.Â  \r\nHere, the Court\r\n  of Appeals correctly recognizes that the public policy exception applies to\r\n  situations where an employer requires an employee to violate the law, or the\r\n  reason for the termination itself is a violation of criminal law.Â  We find the\r\n  court erred, however, in holding the exception is limited to these situations\r\n  where our courts have explicitly held the public policy exception is not so\r\n  limited.Â  Garner, supra; Kieger, supra.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we overrule the Court of Appeals' opinion to the extent it holds the public\r\n  policy exception applies only in situations where the employer asks the\r\n  employee to violate the law or the reason for the termination itself is a\r\n  violation of criminal law.\r\nAlthough we find\r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in its analysis, we nonetheless affirm its holding\r\n  that summary judgment was proper here.Â  Petitioner largely relies on Evans v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co., 337 S.C. 95, 522 S.E.2d 350 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999) to support her contention she can maintain a claim for wrongful termination\r\n  in violation of public policy.Â  Specifically, petitioner argues she can pursue\r\n  a claim for wrongful termination under Evans because there was evidence\r\n  respondent fired her in retaliation for complaining internally about her unpaid\r\n  wages.Â  Because Evans has never been reviewed by this Court, we take the\r\n  opportunity to address the holdings set forth in that opinion, as relates to\r\n  petitioner's argument.\r\nIn Evans,\r\n  the Court of Appeals held an employee may maintain a claim for wrongful termination\r\n  in violation of public policy when he is terminated in retaliation for\r\n  reporting a violation of the Act to the Department of Labor.Â  In that case, several\r\n  employees filed wage complaints with the Department of Labor, which prompted an\r\n  investigation of the employer.Â Â  Id. at 98, 522 S.E.2d at 351.Â  Shortly\r\n  after the investigation was complete, the employer terminated all of the\r\n  employees.Â  Id.Â  A jury awarded the employees damages for wrongful termination.Â  Id. at 99, 522 S.E.2d at 351.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the jury\r\n  verdict, holding the employees could maintain a claim for wrongful termination\r\n  in violation of public policy because, while the law of this state provides a\r\n  remedy for the recovery of wages which remain unpaid after termination, it does\r\n  not provide a remedy for wrongful termination itself.Â  Id. at 102, 522\r\n  S.E.2d at 353.Â  The court also found there was sufficient evidence to affirm\r\n  the jury's determination that discharging an employee in retaliation for filing\r\n  a complaint with the Department of Labor was a violation of the public policy\r\n  of this state.Â  Id. at 103, 522 S.E.2d at 354.Â  \r\n\r\nWe overrule Evans to the extent it holds that a jury may determine whether discharging an\r\n  employee on certain grounds is a violation of public policy. Â In this state, an at-will employee has a cause of action\r\n  for wrongful termination where there is a retaliatory termination of the\r\n  at-will employee in violation of a clear mandate of public policy.Â  Ludwick, supra.Â  The determination of what constitutes public policy is a\r\n  question of law for the courts to decide.Â  See Citizens'\r\n  Bank v. Heyward, 135 S.C. 190, 133 S.E. 709, 713 (1925) (&quot;The primary\r\n  source of the declaration of public policy of the state is the General\r\n  Assembly; the courts assume this prerogative only in the absence of legislative\r\n  declaration.&quot;).Â  It is not a function of the jury to determine questions\r\n  of law such as what constitutes public policy.Â  Rather, once a public policy is\r\n  established, the jury would determine the factual question whether the\r\n  employee's termination was in violation of that public policy.\r\nWhile we overrule Evans to that extent, we agree with the Evans court that there is\r\n  no existing statutory remedy for wrongful termination within the Act that would\r\n  prohibit an employee from maintaining a claim based upon a violation of\r\n  public policy.Â  The Act provides a statutory remedy whereby an employee may\r\n  recover wrongfully withheld wages.Â  SeeÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-80(C) (Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  The Act does not, however, provide a statutory remedy whereby an\r\n  employee may recover damages for wrongful termination.Â  Because the Act does\r\n  not provide a statutory remedy for wrongful termination, we find an action for\r\n  wrongful termination cannot be precluded under the holdings outlined in Dockins, supra, and Epps, supra.\r\nAlthough we agree\r\n  with the Evans court that there is no statutory remedy within the Act\r\n  that would preclude an employee from maintaining a wrongful termination\r\n  action, we nevertheless decline to address whether the public policy exception\r\n  applies when an employee is terminated in retaliation for filing a wage\r\n  complaint with the Department of Labor. Â We find the Court of Appeals properly\r\n  affirmed the circuit court's grant of summary judgment because there is simply\r\n  no evidence the Act was ever implicated.Â  Petitioner never filed a complaint with the Department of Labor as\r\n  required by the Act, nor did she ever indicate to respondent she had filed or\r\n  intended to file a complaint.Â  Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to petitioner, there is no genuine issue of material fact whether\r\n  petitioner was terminated in retaliation for availing herself of the\r\n  protections of the Act.Â  Fleming, supra.\r\nWe do not\r\n  foreclose the possibility that a claim for wrongful termination in violation of\r\n  public policy may exist when an employee is terminated in retaliation for\r\n  instituting a claim under the Act.Â  We simply decline to address the issue at\r\n  this time because there is no evidence petitioner was terminated in retaliation\r\n  for filing or threatening to file such a claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWhile the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in its analysis, we nonetheless find the circuit court's grant of\r\n  summary judgment was properly affirmed.Â  Accordingly, the opinion of the Court\r\n  of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice Brooks Goldsmith, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Act requires an employer timely\r\n  pay all wages due to an employee.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-40 (Supp. 2010).Â  Section\r\n  41-10-60 of the South Carolina Code states the Department of Labor may institute an\r\n  investigation when an employee alleges a violation of the Act. Â S.C.

Frazer, No. 26859, 2010 WL 3219472 (S.C. Sup.\r\n  Ct. Aug. 16, 2010). This Court granted a petition for rehearing and we now\r\n  withdraw that opinion and substitute this opinion, which also reverses the\r\n  master-in-equity's grant of equitable subrogation.\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nIn\r\n  1998, Appellant brought suit against the Frazers in California.Â  In 2000, the\r\n  Frazers moved to South Carolina, and defaulted in Appellant's California\r\n  lawsuit.\r\nIn January 2001, the Frazers purchased a home in Greenville\r\n  County.Â  That mortgage was assigned to Matrix in June 2001.Â  In September 2001,\r\n  Matrix and the Frazers entered into a loan commitment to refinance the January\r\n  2001 mortgage.Â  A title search was conducted on September 18, 2001.Â  The\r\n  parties closed the refinance loan on November 26, 2001, but the new mortgage was\r\n  not recorded until April 3, 2002.Â  \r\nMeanwhile, on September 4, 2001, Appellant obtained a default\r\n  judgment against the Frazers in California, and enrolled that judgment in\r\n  Greenville County on October 31, 2001.Â  \r\nThe Frazers filed bankruptcy, and Matrix sought to foreclose its\r\n  November 2001 refinance mortgage.Â  Appellant counterclaimed, alleging his\r\n  judgment had priority over Matrix's mortgage because it had been recorded\r\n  first.Â  Matrix, attempting to gain the primary priority position, then sought\r\n  to have the refinance mortgage equitably subrogated to the rights of the\r\n  January 2001 mortgage.Â  The master-in-equity granted Matrix's request, and\r\n  Appellant appeals that order.Â  \r\nIssues\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.\r\n       Did the master-in-equity err in granting\r\n  Matrix equitable subrogation to the rights of the January 2001 mortgage, giving\r\n  Matrix priority over Appellant's judgment lien?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.&nbsp;\r\n       Does the doctrine of unclean hands\r\n  prevent Matrix from receiving the remedy of equitable subrogation?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Equitable Subrogation\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the master-in-equity erred in holding Matrix was entitled to equitable\r\n  subrogation.Â  We agree.\r\n The requirements a\r\n  mortgagee must meet to qualify for equitable subrogation are: (1) the party\r\n  claiming subrogation has paid the debt; (2) the party was not a volunteer, but\r\n  had a direct interest in the discharge of the debt or lien; (3) the party was\r\n  secondarily liable for the debt or for the discharge of the lien; (4) no\r\n  injustice will be done to the other party by the allowance of equitable\r\n  subrogation; and (5) the party asserting the doctrine did not have actual\r\n  notice of the prior mortgage.Â  Dedes v. Strickland, 307 S.C. 155, 158,\r\n  414 S.E.2d 134, 136 (1992).\r\nIn Dedes,\r\n  a bank refinanced its initial mortgage and sought to be equitably subrogated to\r\n  the rights of that mortgage to gain priority over the rights of an intervening\r\n  mortgagee.Â  The Court held that the bank could not meet the elements of\r\n  equitable subrogation because it merely paid &quot;itself [the] outstanding\r\n  debt by refinancing the balance owed&quot; and had no &quot;direct interest\r\n  necessitating discharge of the debt . . . .&quot; Id. at 159, 414 S.E.2d\r\n  at 136.Â  The Court further stated, &quot;The record is silent as to what\r\n  secondary liability [the bank] could have had for [the mortgagor's] debt\r\n  secured by its own first mortgage lien.&quot;Â  Id.Â  While the Dedes Court appears to have conflated the requirements of secondary liability and a\r\n  direct interest in discharging the debt,[1] the heart of its reasoning was that the bank could not be subrogated to the\r\n  rights of its own prior mortgage.Â  This conclusion comports with the general\r\n  view that equitable subrogation contemplates a third party satisfying the\r\n  original mortgage, not the same party to whom the original debt is owed. Â See Restatement (Third) of Property (Mortgages) Â§ 7.6 cmt. e (1995) (&quot;Obviously\r\n  subrogation cannot be involved unless the second loan is made by a different\r\n  lender than the holder of the first mortgage; one cannot be subrogated to one's\r\n  own previous mortgage.&quot;); Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009)\r\n  (&quot;Subrogation: Â The substitution of one party for another whose debt the\r\n  party pays, entitling the paying party to rights, remedies, or securities that\r\n  would otherwise belong to the debtor.&quot;).\r\nThus,\r\n  equitable subrogation is simply not a remedy available to a lender that\r\n  refinances the original debt owed to it.Â  This seems to yield the proper\r\n  result, as opposed to the mangled logic that comes about when reasoning that a\r\n  lender refinancing the original debt owed to it cannot prove secondary liability\r\n  or a direct interest in discharging the debt. Â Matrix is not asserting priority\r\n  under a theory of replacement and modification.Â  Matrix expressly pled\r\n  equitable subrogation in its reply to Appellant's counterclaim.Â  Both Dedes,\r\n  controlling South Carolina precedent, and section 7.6 of the Restatement stand\r\n  for the proposition that a lender that refinances its own debt is not entitled\r\n  to equitable subrogation.Â  We do not decide whether a lender that refinances\r\n  its own debt could attain priority under the theory of replacement and\r\n  modification illustrated in section 7.3 of the Restatement (Third) of Property\r\n  (Mortgages).\r\nII.&nbsp; Unclean Hands\r\n Appellant also\r\n  argues Matrix is not entitled to an equitable remedy because it closed the\r\n  refinance loan unlawfully, and thus has unclean hands.Â  We do not believe the\r\n  doctrine of unclean hands is the appropriate basis for resolution of this\r\n  case.Â  However, we do agree that even if Matrix met the requirements for\r\n  equitable subrogation, Matrix would be precluded from receiving that remedy\r\n  because of its unauthorized practice of law.\r\nAll real estate and mortgage loan closings must be\r\n  supervised by an attorney.Â  Doe v. McMaster, 355 S.C. 306, 585 S.E.2d\r\n  773 (2003); State v. Buyers Serv. Co., 292 S.C. 426, 357 S.E.2d 15\r\n  (1987). Performing a title search, preparing title and loan documents, and\r\n  closing a loan without the supervision of an attorney constitutes the\r\n  unauthorized practice of law.Â  Buyers Serv., 292 S.C. at 430-34, 357\r\n  S.E.2d at 17-19. \r\n In Wachovia Bank\r\n  v. Coffey, 398 S.C. 76, 698 S.E.2d 244 (Ct. App. 2010), Wachovia closed a\r\n  home equity loan without the supervision of an attorney and later instituted\r\n  foreclosure proceedings.Â  Our court of appeals held that Wachovia, having\r\n  committed the unauthorized practice of law in closing the loan without attorney\r\n  supervision, came to the court with unclean hands and thus was barred from\r\n  seeking equitable relief.Â  In so holding, the court of appeals said:\r\nThe\r\n  unauthorized practice of law is inherently prejudicial to not only the parties\r\n  involved in the instant transaction but also to the public at large for the\r\n  reason so cogently stated in Buyers: \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  reason preparation of instruments by lay persons must be held to constitute the\r\n  unauthorized practice of law is not for the economic protection of the legal\r\n  profession.Â  Rather, it is for the protection of the public from the\r\n  potentially severe economic and emotional consequences which may flow from\r\n  erroneous advice given by persons untrained in the law.\r\n\r\nCoffey, 389 S.C. at 76, 698 S.E.2d at 248 (citing State\r\n  v. Buyers Serv. Co., 292 S.C. 426, 431, 357 S.E.2d 15, 18 (1987)).Â  \r\nSimilarly,\r\n  in this case Matrix hired LandAmerica OneStop to perform the title search,\r\n  prepare the documents, and close the refinance loanâ€”all admittedly without the\r\n  supervision of a licensed attorney.Â Â  Thus, Matrix committed the unauthorized\r\n  practice of law in closing the refinance mortgage, clearly violating South Carolina\r\n  law.[2]Â \r\n  Matrix now comes to this Court, seeking equitable relief, based upon a mortgage\r\n  contract it entered into in violation of the laws of this state.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court has previously held the presence of attorneys in real estate loan\r\n  closings is for the protection of the public and that &quot;protection of the\r\n  public is of paramount concern&quot; in loan closings.Â  Buyers Serv.,\r\n  292 S.C. at 433, 357 S.E.2d at 19.Â  Enforcing this requirement will come as no\r\n  surprise to any lender.Â  Lenders cannot ignore established laws of this state\r\n  and yet expect this Court to overlook their unlawful disregard.Â  We take this\r\n  opportunity to definitively state that a lender may not enjoy the benefit of\r\n  equitable remedies when that lender failed to have attorney supervision during\r\n  the loan process as required by our law.Â  We apply this ruling to all filing\r\n  dates after the issuance of this opinion. Â \r\nConclusion\r\n For the above\r\n  reasons, we hold Matrix is not entitled to equitable subrogation.Â  The\r\n  master-in-equity's order is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  J., and Acting Justice John H. Waller, Jr., concur. KITTREDGE, J., concurring\r\n  in result in a separate opinion. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â  I concur in result.Â  I join\r\n  Chief Justice Toal and vote to reverse due to Matrix's unauthorized practice of\r\n  law.Â  I would not reach the issue of whether Matrix otherwise satisfied the\r\n  requirements of equitable subrogation. Â Concerning the majority's broader\r\n  holding voiding a real estate mortgage secured through the unauthorized\r\n  practice of law, I join today's result because of its prospective-only\r\n  application.Â  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would affirm the master's\r\n  order equitably subrogating Matrix's refinanced mortgage to its original\r\n  mortgage, and would not impose the draconian remedy of denying equitable relief\r\n  to lenders who &quot;fail[â€¦]to have attorney supervision during the loan\r\n  process as required by law.&quot;\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equitable Subrogation\r\nEquitable subrogation is a remedy favored by the courts, and it is\r\n  to be liberally and expansively applied.Â  So. Bank and Trust Co. v. Harrison\r\n    Sales Co., Inc., 285 S.C. 50, 328 S.E.2d 60 (1985).Â  The doctrine:\r\n\r\nis founded on the fictional premise that an obligation\r\n  extinguished by a payment made by a third person is to be treated as still\r\n  subsisting for the benefit of such third person, whereby he is substituted to\r\n  the rights of the creditor when he has made such payment.\r\nSt. Paul - Mercury\r\n  Indem. Co. v. Donaldson,\r\n  225 S.C. 476, 83 S.E.2d 159 (1954) citing Aetna\r\n    Life Ins. Co. of Hartford v. Town of Middleport, 124 U.S. 534 (1888).\r\n\r\n&quot;The purpose of\r\n  subrogation is to prevent a junior lien holder from converting the mistake of\r\n  the lender into a magical gift for himself.&quot;Â  United States v. Baron,\r\n  996 F.2d. 25 (2nd Cir. 1993) (internal citation omitted). \r\n It appears that the\r\n  majority would agree with me that a refinancer has a right to lien priority, if\r\n  that refinancer uses the theory of &quot;replacement and modification&quot;\r\n  rather than equitable subrogation.Â  Heretofore, South Carolina has used the\r\n  doctrine of equitable subrogation to restore a refinancer's lien to priority,\r\n  and I would not reverse this order because it used this theory rather than the\r\n  newly announced &quot;replacement and modification&quot; rule.Â  \r\n In 1927, this Court\r\n  held that a lender who pays the original mortgage itself, or furnishes money to\r\n  the mortgagor to pay off an existing mortgage, pursuant to an agreement by\r\n  which the lender will give a new mortgage, has the equitable right to be\r\n  subrogated to the paid-off mortgage.Â  Enterprise Bank v. Fed. Land Bank,\r\n  139 S.C. 397, 138 S.E. 146 (1927).Â  In this situation, the lender furnishing\r\n  the money is not a volunteer, and becomes secondarily liable for the discharge\r\n  of the first mortgage under the instruments creating the new mortgage which\r\n  require the satisfaction of the first mortgage as a condition of the giving of\r\n  the second.Â  Id.;[3] see also James v. Martin, 150 S.C. 75, 147 S.E. 752 (1929)\r\n  (applying Enterprise Bank and quoting: â€œOne satisfying a lien note at\r\n  the request of the property owner, upon the understanding that he is to have\r\n  new security upon the property released, acting in ignorance of a second\r\n  mortgage lien upon the property, although it is on record, is entitled to\r\n  subrogation to the rights of the first lien holderâ€).Â  \r\n As the Washington\r\n  Supreme Court explained, several considerations support a rule that, absent\r\n  material prejudice to a junior lienholder, equitable subrogation should be\r\n  automatically available to a mortgage refinancer who can show it expected to\r\n  have first priority:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1)\r\n      Equitable subrogation preserves\r\n  priorities by keeping mortgages and other liens in their proper recordation\r\n  order;\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2)\r\n      Equitable subrogation\r\n  accomplishes substantial justice and rests on the maxim that no one (here, the\r\n  junior lienholder) should be enriched by another's loss;\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      3)\r\n       Facilitating refinancing helps\r\n  prevent foreclosures; and\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      4)\r\n       A liberal equitable subrogation\r\n  policy reduces title insurance premiums.[4]\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBank of America v. Prestance Corp., 160 Wash. 2d 560, 160 P.3d 17 (2007). \r\n The majority would\r\n  punish the respondent in this case for failing to anticipate the majority's\r\n  decision to alter the theory under which respondent pled, proved, and obtained\r\n  the result it sought below.Â  I would affirm the master's decision to equitably\r\n  subrogate Matrix's second mortgage to its first, a result which is consistent\r\n  with both our existing law and sound public policy.Â  Cf. Rule 220(c),\r\n  SCACR (court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record). \r\nB.&nbsp; Unclean Hands\r\n The majority also\r\n  would expand the relief afforded by the Court of Appeals to a mortgagor who has\r\n  been the &quot;victim of the unauthorized practice of law&quot; to all\r\n  lienholders of that mortgagor.Â  See Wachovia Bank v. Coffey, 398\r\n  S.C. 76, 698 S.E.2d 244 (Ct. App. 2010) cert. pending (mortgagee cannot\r\n  foreclose mortgage where loan closed without attorney supervision); compare Hambrick v. GMAC Mort. Corp., 370 S.C. 118, 634 S.E.2d 5 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. dismissed April 5, 2007 (mortgagor has no private right of action\r\n  against mortgagee for the unauthorized practice of law).Â  The purpose of\r\n  equitable subrogation/replacement and modification is to prevent a windfall to\r\n  a junior lienholder.Â  I cannot square the policy underlying this purpose with\r\n  the Court's proclamation that refusing equitable relief to &quot;bad&quot;\r\n  lenders will somehow protect the public at loan closings.Â  I see only detriment\r\n  to the borrowing public[5] and a windfall to junior lienholders in this decision which would deny all\r\n  equitable relief to any &quot;lender who fail[s] to have attorney supervision\r\n  during the loan process as required by our lawâ€¦[in] all filing dates[6] after the issuance of this opinion.&quot;Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n I respectfully\r\n  dissent and would affirm the Master's order.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The logic surrounding the elements of secondary liability and direct interest\r\n  has been tortured in our case law because the current definition does not\r\n  distinguish between a party who pays off the prior debt and a party who\r\n  advances funds to the debtor for the purpose of paying off the prior debt.Â \r\n  Judge Howard's concurrence in Dodge City of Spartanburg, Inc. v. Jones,\r\n  317 S.C. 491, 454 S.E.2d 918 (Ct. App. 1995), explains the difficulties our\r\n  courts have encountered concerning this issue.Â  While we disagree with Judge\r\n  Howard's conclusion that the lender in Dodge City could receive\r\n  equitable subrogation when it refinanced the debt already owed to it, we agree\r\n  with his analysis that a lender who either pays the debt itself or provides the\r\n  debtor funds with the understanding the debtor will satisfy the obligation may\r\n  seek equitable subrogation.\r\n[2] Buyers Service established in 1987 that attorney supervision is required\r\n  for the four steps in the residential real estate loan and mortgage process:Â \r\n  preparation of deeds, notes, and other instruments; preparation of title\r\n  abstracts; the closing; and recording the instruments.Â  292 S.C. at 430-34, 357\r\n  S.E.2d at 17-19.Â  No language, analysis, or discussion in Buyers Service indicates the Court intended to limit the holding to purchase money mortgages.Â \r\n  In Doe v. McMaster, the petitioner suggested to the Court that Buyers\r\n    Service's holding did not apply because the buyer and lender were\r\n  refinancing an existing mortgage rather than purchasing new property.Â  355 S.C.\r\n  at 312, 585 S.E.2d at 776. Â The Court said, &quot;This distinction is without\r\n  significance&quot; because &quot;[i]n refinancing a real estate mortgage the\r\n  four steps in the initial purchase still exist.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Doe v.\r\n    McMaster did not change the landscape regarding refinance loans, but simply\r\n  stated the existing law.Â Â  \r\n[3] It appears that the lender in Dedes v. Strickland, 307 S.C. 155, 414\r\n  S.E.2d 134 (1992) was denied equitable subrogation because it failed to present\r\n  evidence that its refinancing was conditioned upon the repayment of the first\r\n  loan.Â  Id. at 159, 414 S.E.2d at 136.\r\n[4] Citing Nelson &amp; Whitman, Adopting Restatement Mortgage\r\n  Subrogation Principles: Saving Billions of Dollars for Refinancing Homeowners,\r\n  2006 BYU L.Rev. 305.\r\n[5] I suspect that many mortgagees, denied hope of equitable relief, including the\r\n  ability to foreclose if an attorney should fail to supervise any of the acts\r\n  required of him in a loan closing, will choose not to do business in South\r\n  Carolina, or choose to increase fees to cover potential unrecoverable\r\n  liabilities.\r\n[6] I am unsure what filing date the majority is referring to in this passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27019","title":"In the Matter of Jody Vavra Bentley","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=27019","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court suspended a lawyer.","date":"2011-08-08","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Jody Vavra\r\n      Bentley, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 27019\r\nSubmitted July 12, 2011 - Filed August 8, 2011Â Â Â \r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, Sabrina C.

[1]Â \r\n  We accept the Agreement and impose a definite suspension of two years,\r\n  retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set\r\n  forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n Respondent\r\n  was admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1989.Â  For most of her career,\r\n  respondent was a sole practitioner. Â In September 2008, respondent was\r\n  diagnosed with breast cancer.Â  She underwent treatment, including chemotherapy,\r\n  surgery, and radiation.Â  \r\nMatter I\r\n In May 2005, Complainant\r\n  A hired respondent to pursue her claims arising from an automobile accident.Â \r\n  Respondent did not keep Complainant A adequately informed about the status and\r\n  progress of her case and failed to adequately respond to her reasonable\r\n  requests for information.Â  \r\n In December\r\n  2008, Complainant A began trying to reach respondent by telephoning her\r\n  office.Â  At that time Complainant A had not heard from respondent since October\r\n  2008.Â  As of February 2, 2009, the date of Complainant A's letter to ODC,\r\n  respondent had not responded to any of Complainant A's telephone calls.Â \r\n  Respondent had closed her office as a result of her health problems, but did\r\n  not give proper notice to Complainant A or take steps to protect her\r\n  interests.Â  \r\n Although\r\n  respondent did respond to ODC's initial inquiry, she submitted her response\r\n  more than one month after it was due.Â  After her initial response, she did not\r\n  respond to further inquiries from ODC regarding the complaint or otherwise\r\n  cooperate with ODC's investigation.Â  Her telephone number on file with the\r\n  South Carolina Bar was disconnected.Â  All of ODC's certified mail regarding\r\n  this matter was returned unclaimed. \r\nMatter II\r\n Respondent\r\n  represented several individuals injured in an automobile accident.Â  She failed\r\n  to keep her clients adequately informed of the status and progress of their\r\n  case.Â  In her initial response to the complaint in this matter, respondent\r\n  indicated her clients' case was expected to be called for trial soon, but noted\r\n  she was under an order of protection because of her medical condition.Â  She\r\n  indicated that, because of her medical problems, she intended to refer her\r\n  clients to new counsel.Â  \r\nSometime after her\r\n  response in this matter, respondent closed her law office.Â  However, she did\r\n  not refer her clients to new counsel and stopped communicating with opposing\r\n  counsel and the court.Â  Further, respondent stopped communicating with ODC and\r\n  stopped cooperating with its investigation into this matter.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\n Respondent\r\n  failed to maintain adequate and accurate records of the funds she held in her\r\n  trust account.Â  She also commingled her personal funds with those she was\r\n  holding in trust by failing to timely remove earned fees and expended costs\r\n  from the account.Â  \r\n Respondent\r\n  represents she failed to timely remove these funds because of her mistaken\r\n  belief that a minimum account balance was required to avoid monthly fees.Â \r\n  Because of respondent's inadequate financial recordkeeping and her commingling\r\n  of funds, she was unable to identify the owner(s) of more than $5,500 in her\r\n  trust account at the time she was placed on interim suspension.Â  \r\nLAW\r\n Respondent\r\n  admits that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413,\r\n  RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction\r\n  regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground\r\n  for discipline for lawyer to knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for\r\n  information from a disciplinary authority).Â  In addition, respondent admits\r\n  she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to\r\n  client); Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall consult with client about objectives of\r\n  representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and\r\n  promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably\r\n  informed about status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for\r\n  information, and explain matter to extent reasonably necessary to permit client\r\n  to make informed decisions regarding the representation); Rule 1.15(a) (lawyer shall\r\n  hold client funds separately from lawyerâ€™s own funds); Rule 1.16 (upon\r\n  termination of representation, lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably\r\n  practicable to protect clientâ€™s interests, including reasonable notice to\r\n  client); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful\r\n  demand for information from disciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for\r\n    lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Â Respondent further\r\n    admits she violated the recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and impose a definite suspension of two years, retroactive to the\r\n  date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of\r\n  this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court\r\n  showing that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.

Preston Strom, Jr., of Strom Law Firm,\r\n  LLC, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent\r\n  have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to the\r\n  imposition of either an admonition or public reprimand. Â We accept the\r\n  agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the\r\n  agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\n From December 2003\r\n  through early September 2004, respondent conducted numerous closings involving\r\n  Johnny Hoy.Â  On more than twelve occasions Hoy purchased a parcel of land and,\r\n  in a back-to-back transaction, sold the parcel and a mobile home on it to\r\n  another purchaser.Â  In these back-to-back transactions, Hoy financed his\r\n  purchase of the parcel with the proceeds of his sale of the parcel and mobile\r\n  home.Â  The individuals who purchased the properties from Hoy secured financing\r\n  though Branch Banking &amp; Trust (BB&amp;T).Â  \r\n Respondent's contact\r\n  at BB&amp;T was loan officer Robert Byron Green.Â  Respondent used the\r\n  instructions Green provided for completing the HUD-1 settlement statements.Â \r\n  The settlement statements respondent submitted to BB&amp;T failed to reflect that\r\n  Hoy used the proceeds he received from his sale of each parcel and mobile home\r\n  to fund his purchase of the parcel.Â  Additionally, the settlement statements\r\n  for Hoy's sale of the properties indicated the purchasers made substantial down\r\n  payments to Hoy outside of closing.Â  Respondent notes that Green advised him\r\n  that BB&amp;T would not review the HUD-1 settlement statements prior to closing\r\n  and that BB&amp;T was aware of the back-to-back transactions.Â Â Â  \r\n In June 2004,\r\n  respondent had his office staff attend a South Carolina Bar seminar where they learned\r\n  they should be on the lookout for closings like the Hoy back-to-back closings.Â \r\n  On July 20, 2004, the Court issued In the Matter of Barbare, 360 S.C.\r\n  560, 602 S.E.2d 382 (2004), which addressed the importance of ensuring that\r\n  HUD-1 statements submitted to lenders accurately reflect the transactions of\r\n  the buyer, seller, and lender.Â  After learning of the Barbare decision,\r\n  respondent immediately changed all closings involving Hoy and began requiring\r\n  Hoy to bring certified funds to the closings where he was purchasing\r\n  properties.Â  In early September 2004, Hoy stopped using respondent's\r\n  services.Â Â  \r\n Hoy, Green, and\r\n  several others were indicted by a federal grand jury for one count of\r\n  conspiracy to commit bank fraud and thirty-nine counts of making (and aiding\r\n  and abetting each other in making) false statements to BB&amp;T, a federally\r\n  insured financial institution.Â  The superseding indictment explained that Hoy,\r\n  Green and the other defendants conspired with each other to deceive BB&amp;T as\r\n  to the credit-worthiness of certain mortgage loan applicants.Â  Some of the\r\n  properties on which respondent had conducted the back-to-back closings were\r\n  identified in the superseding indictment.Â  \r\nLAW \r\n Respondent admits that,\r\n  by his misconduct, he has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR, particularly Rule 1.16(a)(1) (lawyer shall not represent client where\r\n  representation will result in violation of Rules of Professional Conduct or\r\n  other law), Rule 4.1(a) (in course of\r\n  representing client, lawyer shall not knowingly make false statement of\r\n  material fact to third person), Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for\r\n  lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 8.4(d) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty,\r\n  fraud, deceit or misrepresentation), and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct\r\n  for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of\r\n  justice).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for\r\n  discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer\r\n  to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We find that\r\n  respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept\r\n  the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for\r\n  his misconduct.Â  \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27021","title":"In the Matter of Joseph P.

Â Respondent\r\n  acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the\r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We find that\r\n  respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  In addition, respondent\r\n  shall:Â  1) read and require each of his employees to read the South Carolina\r\n  Notary Public manual published by the South Carolina Secretary of State within\r\n  twenty days of the date of this opinion and provide timely proof of completion\r\n  of this requirement to the Commission; 2) complete the Ethics School portion of\r\n  the South Carolina Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program at his own expense within\r\n  one year of the imposition of discipline and provide timely proof of completion\r\n  of this requirement to the Commission; and 3) pay the costs incurred in the\r\n  investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission within\r\n  thirty days of the date of this opinion.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement\r\n  for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his\r\n  misconduct.Â  \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27022","title":"In the Matter of Tammie Lynn Hoffman","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=27022","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court suspended a lawyer.","date":"2011-08-08","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Tammie Lynn Hoffman, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  27022\r\nSubmitted July 7, 2011 - Filed August 8, 2011Â \r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Sabrina C. Todd, Assistant Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nTammie\r\n  Lynn Hoffman, of North Charleston, pro se.Â Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  consents to the imposition of a public reprimand or definite suspension not to\r\n  exceed two (2) years.Â  In addition, she agrees to complete the South Carolina\r\n  Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust Account School\r\n  within one (1) year of the issuance of a sanction and before filing a Petition\r\n  for Reinstatement, if a suspension is imposed.Â  Respondent also agrees to pay\r\n  the costs incurred by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission)\r\n  in the investigation and prosecution of this matter.Â  We accept the Agreement\r\n  and impose a definite suspension of two (2) years, order respondent to complete\r\n  the South Carolina Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and\r\n  Trust Account School within one (1) year of the date of this opinion and before\r\n  filing a Petition for Reinstatement, and direct respondent to pay the costs\r\n  incurred by ODC and the Commission in the investigation and prosecution of this\r\n  matter.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\n Respondent\r\n  represented Client A, a veteran, in a disability appeal before the United\r\n  States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.Â  She failed to respond to three\r\n  orders of the Court and, as a result, the appeal was dismissed.Â  \r\n Respondent\r\n  maintains she had not heard from Client A for an extended period of time and he\r\n  was not responding to her letters.Â  She did not, however, move to be relieved\r\n  or ask the Court to hold the appeal in abeyance.Â  \r\n Client A\r\n  asserts he did not receive respondent's letters and, although he was in a coma\r\n  during a portion of the representation, his family was available to respond to\r\n  respondent.Â  Respondent failed to notify Client A that his appeal had been dismissed.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\n Respondent\r\n  represented Client B, another veteran, in a disability appeal before the United\r\n  States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.Â  Respondent failed to comply with\r\n  the Court's rules in several respects and, when she failed to correct these deficiencies,\r\n  the Court dismissed the appeal.Â  \r\nRespondent asserts she\r\n  failed to respond to some Court directives and orders because the Clerk's\r\n  Office sent mail to her at an old address and, later, to an incomplete\r\n  address.Â  Respondent was aware of the communication problem and asserts she\r\n  notified the Clerk's Office by telephone.Â  However, when the problem continued,\r\n  rather than notifying the Clerk's Office of the problem in writing, she relied\r\n  on updates from Client B and sporadic reviews of the Court's docketing system\r\n  to keep track of the progress of the appeal.Â  \r\nAfter learning of the\r\n  dismissal, respondent moved to reinstate the appeal.Â  The Court held\r\n  respondent's motion in abeyance pending her compliance with Court rules.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to fully comply with the Court's rules and the Court issued a\r\n  final order dismissing the appeal.Â  Thereafter, the Court received and rejected\r\n  respondent's brief.Â  Respondent failed to inform Client B that his appeal had\r\n  been dismissed.Â  \r\nAdditionally, although\r\n  respondent advised the Court that she represented Client B pro bono,\r\n  she admits Client B paid her $100.00.Â  Respondent issued a refund check to\r\n  Client B during ODC's investigation, but he declined to cash the check.Â Â  \r\nMatter III\r\n Client\r\n  C hired respondent to handle an estate.Â  During the representation, the estate\r\n  sold two residential rental properties.Â  The first sale netted proceeds\r\n  totaling $95,585.51 which the closing attorney disbursed to respondent as\r\n  attorney for the estate.Â  Rather than deposit the proceeds into her trust account\r\n  as required by Rule 417(b)(1), SCACR, respondent deposited $88,585.51 into her\r\n  trust account and took the remaining $7,000 in cash.Â  She maintains she\r\n  intended to use the cash to purchase certified funds to pay the estate's\r\n  creditors.Â  Instead, however, she issued checks on the trust account to pay the\r\n  estate's creditors.Â Â  Â \r\n After\r\n  paying the estate's creditors, respondent was holding $81,375.99 in her trust\r\n  account and the $7,000 she had not deposited into the trust account.Â  Several\r\n  months later, the balance in respondent's trust account was $47,858.59.Â \r\n  Respondent explains that, in addition to paying the estate's creditors, she\r\n  paid herself $17,000 in legal fees and an additional $12,000 in error.Â \r\n  Respondent is unable to account for the remaining $4,517.40 missing from the\r\n  trust account.Â  \r\n The\r\n  estate's second property was sold for substantially less than the mortgage\r\n  balance and, as a result, respondent was required to transfer $64,916.76 to the\r\n  attorney who closed that transaction.Â  In the ten days before the transfer,\r\n  respondent deposited $25,500 into her trust account in four deposits.Â  These\r\n  funds were from personal sources and were not associated with any client or\r\n  third party for whom respondent was holding money in trust.Â  \r\n When\r\n  respondent issued her final billing statement to Client C, it did not reflect\r\n  any payments she had made to herself, the $7,000 she failed to deposit, or a\r\n  $400 payment Client C made to her at the onset of representation.Â  \r\n During\r\n  the investigation of this matter, ODC issued a subpoena for respondent's\r\n  financial records maintained pursuant to Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Although respondent\r\n  provided multiple responses to the subpoena, the records were incomplete.Â  She\r\n  was unable to produce a complete copy of her receipt and disbursement journal,\r\n  copies of her check stubs, records of her deposits, client ledgers, or\r\n  reconciliation reports for the period of time she held funds for the estate.Â \r\n  Respondent also failed to retain copies of the invoices she contends she\r\n  regularly provided to Client C in accordance with the fee agreement.Â  Further,\r\n  although Client C requested an accounting of the funds held by respondent, respondent\r\n  was unable to demonstrate that she ever provided Client C an accounting of the\r\n  funds held in trust. Â \r\n Additionally,\r\n  a review of available trust account records revealed that, on at least one\r\n  occasion, respondent withdrew funds from her account for her fees in cash and\r\n  without identifying the representation associated with the fees.Â  Respondent\r\n  also issued checks in connection with real estate matters her office handled\r\n  without identifying the specific property involved.Â  \r\nLAW\r\n Respondent\r\n  admits that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413,\r\n  RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct\r\n  of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to\r\n  pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal\r\n  profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\n  Â In addition, respondent admits she has violated the following provisions of\r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to client ); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with\r\n  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer\r\n  shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter, promptly comply\r\n  with reasonable requests for information, and explain matter to extent\r\n  reasonably necessary to permit client to make informed decisions regarding the\r\n  representation); Rule 1.15 (a) (lawyer shall hold property of clients that is in\r\n  lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from lawyerâ€™s\r\n  own property; complete records of such account funds and other property shall\r\n  be kept by lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of six years after\r\n  termination of the representation; lawyer shall comply with Rule 417, SCACR); Rule\r\n  1.15(d) (upon request by client, lawyer shall promptly render a full accounting\r\n  regarding funds held by lawyer for client); Rule 3.3 (lawyer shall not\r\n  knowingly make false statement of fact to tribunal); Rule 8.4(d) (it\r\n  is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty,\r\n  fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule\r\n    8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in\r\n  conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent\r\n  further admits she failed to comply with the financial recordkeeping,\r\n  depository, and withdrawal requirements imposed by Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and impose a definite suspension of two (2) years.Â  Within one (1) year of the date of this opinion and before\r\n  she files a Petition for Reinstatement, respondent shall complete the South\r\n  Carolina Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust\r\n  Account SchoolÂ  Within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent\r\n  shall pay the costs incurred by ODC and the Commission in the investigation and\r\n  prosecution of this matter.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of\r\n  this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court\r\n  showing that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27023","title":"In the Matter of Municipal Court Judge Sheryl Polk McKinney","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=27023","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court definitely suspended a judge.","date":"2011-08-08","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Municipal Court\r\n      Judge Sheryl Polk McKinney, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 27023\r\nSubmitted July 20, 2011 -Â Â  Filed August 8, 2011\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph P. Turner, Jr., Assistant Attorney\r\n  General, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nRichard\r\n  Alexander Murdaugh, of Hampton, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary\r\n  matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule\r\n  502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the\r\n  imposition of a public reprimand or a definite suspension not to exceed thirty (30)\r\n  days pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and\r\n  impose a thirty (30) day suspension.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement\r\n  are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n Respondent's sister, who was the Clerk\r\n  of the Town of Varnville, was arrested and charged with embezzlement of public\r\n  funds, forgery, and misconduct in office.Â  Respondent's sister was accused of\r\n  issuing checks in respondent's name, forging respondent's name to the checks,\r\n  and converting the money for her personal use over an eight year period.Â  \r\n The South Carolina Law Enforcement\r\n  Division (SLED) determined that respondent was not involved in any of the\r\n  alleged misconduct in office involving her sister.Â  There is no allegation or\r\n  evidence that respondent was even aware of the alleged conduct leading to her\r\n  sister's charges.Â  \r\n In the course of its investigation, SLED\r\n  discovered checks made payable to respondent from the Varnville Police\r\n  Department Victim's Assistance Fund and endorsed by respondent.Â  These checks\r\n  were from the Varnville Police Department and approved by the Chief of Police\r\n  who wanted to supplement respondent's salary for extra work she performed after\r\n  hours.[1]Â \r\n  ODC has confirmed that the Chief of Police had approved the checks.\r\n Respondent reports that her sister gave\r\n  her the checks at the Clerk's Office and that she, in turn, endorsed the checks,\r\n  and thereafter, respondent's sister gave her cash from the Clerk's Office.Â \r\n  Respondent submits she was unaware that the funds came from a Victim's\r\n  Assistance Fund as she just endorsed the checks and received the cash.Â Â  ODC\r\n  found no evidence that respondent ever took possession of the checks and can\r\n  confirm that she never deposited them into her personal account.Â  Respondent\r\n  acknowledges that she was aware that the funds were from the Varnville Police\r\n  Department, but she believed they were being provided to the town so that the\r\n  town was actually supplementing her salary.Â  \r\n From 2002 until 2006, respondent\r\n  received 43 checks totaling $4,890.00.Â  The checks ranged from $50.00 to $200.00.Â \r\n  Respondent submits she was unaware it would be improper for her to receive\r\n  supplemental payments from the police department who prosecuted cases before\r\n  her.Â  She submits that the checks from the police department never affected her\r\n  judicial decisions, but she now realizes the payments could give the impression\r\n  she was not impartial.Â Â  \r\nThere is no allegation or evidence\r\n  that respondent ever ruled a particular way due to the payments from the police\r\n  department.Â  There is no allegation or any evidence that the judge made any\r\n  decision not fully supported by the evidence. \r\nRespondent has cooperated in ODC's\r\n  investigation.Â  Further, she has been forthright and honest in answering all of\r\n  ODC's questions.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\n By her misconduct, respondent has\r\n  violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â \r\n  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity\r\n    and independence of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should maintain and enforce high standards of\r\n      conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and\r\n      independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the\r\n        appearance of impropriety in all activities); and Canon 2A (judge shall respect\r\n        and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes\r\n        public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary).\r\n In addition, respondent admits her misconduct constitutes a\r\n  violation of Rule 7, RJDE, of Rule 502, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it\r\n  shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate Code of Judicial Conduct)\r\n  and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate\r\n  Judge's Oath of Office contained in Rule 502.1, SCACR).&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n We find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants\r\n  a suspension from judicial duties.Â  We therefore accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent for thirty (30) days.Â  \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent is a part-time judge who initially\r\n  was paid $100 per month and is now paid $250 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

App. 2009).Â  This Court granted Trotter's petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the opinion of the Court of Appeals.Â  We reverse.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nTrotter\r\n  was employed by Spherion, a temporary agency, in August 2004.Â  At that time,\r\n  she was sent to work for a 90-day trial period with Trane, a manufacturer of\r\n  industrial air-conditioners in Blythewood, South Carolina. \r\nAfter\r\n  completing the probationary period, Trotter was hired by Trane for a permanent\r\n  position in November 2004.Â  Trotter worked at &quot;the turb and trim\r\n  station,&quot; which consisted of using an &quot;air driver&quot; (a\r\n  screwdriver with a blade) to trim down tubes to the same length, and then\r\n  &quot;turbulating&quot; the tubes by putting a spring into each tube.Â  Trotter\r\n  was on her feet most of the day and had to &quot;push&quot; into the tubes and\r\n  move her lower body, particularly her hips, back and forth to perform her work.Â \r\n  She spent approximately ninety percent of each workday, from 5:30 a.m. to 4:00\r\n  p.m., engaged in this activity.Â  \r\n According to\r\n  Trotter, she began having spasms and some lower back pain that extended down\r\n  her legs in December 2004, which she mentioned to her Team Leader, Darryl\r\n  Cloud, and to Duane DeBoo,[1] Trane's Safety Coordinator.Â  Trotter continued to work with increasing\r\n  discomfort in December 2004 and January 2005.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  Monday, January 31, 2005, Trotter was &quot;turbulating the coil&quot; when she\r\n  felt &quot;like something popped in [her] back&quot; and experienced\r\n  &quot;excruciating pain.&quot;Â  Trotter stated she reported this incident to\r\n  Cloud, her Team Leader.Â  \r\n Trotter worked all\r\n  that week with worsening pain and &quot;really bad&quot; back spasms.Â  On\r\n  Friday, February 4, 2005, she reportedly told Cloud and her supervisor, Pat\r\n  Charleston, that she had hurt her back while turbulating and that she was in\r\n  pain and needed to have something done.Â  Trotter stated Charleston advised her\r\n  that he would get DeBoo to come over and talk to her, but she did not see DeBoo\r\n  before her shift ended and she went home.Â Â Â  \r\nThat\r\n  same Friday, Trotter made an appointment for the following Monday to see Dr. W.\r\n  Scott James, III, a physician with Carolina Orthopaedic Surgery Associates.Â  However,\r\n  on Saturday, February 5th, Trotter had &quot;[t]errible pain,&quot; so she went\r\n  to the emergency room at Piedmont Medical Center in Rock Hill.\r\n Trotter was seen by\r\n  Dr. James on Monday, February 7, 2005.Â  She told him that she had been having\r\n  pain at work for the past &quot;several months.&quot;Â  He scheduled an MRI and\r\n  gave her a doctor's note to stay off work.Â  Trotter called Trane's personnel\r\n  office and spoke to Carlos Mays, who told her to bring in the doctor's slip.Â \r\n  She did so and allegedly showed it to her Supervisor, Charleston, who made a copy\r\n  of it. Â Trotter did not return to work after February 4, 2005.Â  \r\nThe MRI\r\n  revealed Trotter had a large, herniated disc at L5-S1 with marked compression\r\n  of the right S1 nerve root.Â  Following Dr. James's recommendation, Trotter underwent\r\n  surgery on February 21, 2005.[2] Â Dr. James indicated in his notes that Trotter likely had a bad disc in her\r\n  back that was aggravated by her job change.Â  \r\nWithin\r\n  a week after her surgery, Trotter called DeBoo and left a message regarding her\r\n  work injury, but he did not return her call.Â  Trotter called the personnel\r\n  office and spoke to Adrian Barnhill, Trane's Human Resources Manager, who\r\n  arranged a conference call on February 28, 2005 with Barnhill, DeBoo, Charleston, Mays, and Trotter.Â  Trotter told them that she had had a work-related accident\r\n  and that the turbulator had caused her to suffer a back injury.Â  Trotter had\r\n  never filed a workers' compensation claim before, so she asked them what she\r\n  needed to do.Â  They asked her to submit a written statement providing details\r\n  of the accident, which she did on April 14, 2005.\r\nOn\r\n  May 11, 2005, Trotter filed a Form 50 alleging an injury by accident to her\r\n  back. Trane denied the claim, maintaining it did not receive notice of the\r\n  injury until after Trotter's surgery and that there was insufficient proof of a\r\n  work-related injury.Â  \r\n A hearing was held\r\n  on September 20, 2005 before a single commissioner.[3]Â  By order filed May 5,\r\n  2006, the commissioner found Trotter had established a compensable claim for\r\n  her back and that Trane was responsible for all causally-related medical\r\n  treatment, both past and future as directed by Dr. James, and &quot;temporary\r\n  total benefits from Mrs. Trotter's last day of work and continuing.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  commissioner noted that she had denied Trane's motions for a continuance or to\r\n  leave the record open in order to take the depositions of Dr. James and Charleston and to add Spherion as a party.Â  The commissioner stated Trane had the\r\n  opportunity to depose Dr. James prior to the hearing, but it chose not to do so\r\n  at that time for strategic reasons.Â  Further, Charleston was scheduled to\r\n  appear at the hearing, but he became incapacitated suddenly due to illness.Â \r\n  She twice granted motions to hold the record open for Charleston's deposition\r\n  to be taken, but no deposition was ever scheduled due to Charleston's\r\n  continuing incapacity, so she closed the record.Â  Finally, as to adding\r\n  Spherion as a defendant, the commissioner found Trotter was employed with\r\n  Trane, not Spherion, at the time of her injury.Â  \r\n An Appellate Panel\r\n  of the Commission unanimously upheld the commissioner's order and adopted the\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law contained therein in full.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed.Â Â Â  \r\nTrane\r\n  appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed in part, vacated in part, and\r\n  remanded.Â  Trotter v. Trane Coil Facility, 384 S.C. 109, 681 S.E.2d 36\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009).Â  The Court of Appeals found the Commission abused its\r\n  discretion in denying Trane's motions for a continuance or to hold the record\r\n  open for the depositions of Dr. James and Charleston to be taken.Â  Id. at 118, 681 S.E.2d at 41.Â  It found Trane had exercised due diligence to obtain\r\n  the depositions and the testimony was necessary to the case.Â  Id. at\r\n  117-19, 681 S.E.2d at 41.Â  The Court of Appeals vacated the remainder of the\r\n  circuit court's order and remanded &quot;all issues&quot; to the Commission for\r\n  reconsideration following the taking of the additional testimony.Â  Id. at 119, 681 S.E.2d at 42.Â  This Court has granted Trotter's petition for a writ\r\n  of certiorari.\r\nII.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial\r\n  review of workers' compensation decisions.Â  Pierre v. Seaside Farms,\r\n    Inc.,&nbsp;386 S.C. 534, 689 S.E.2d 615 (2010); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc.,\r\n  276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â  Under the APA,\r\n  this Court can reverse or modify the decision of the Commission where the\r\n  substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the decision\r\n  is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence considering the record as a whole.Â  Transp.\r\n    Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 389 S.C. 422, 699 S.E.2d 687\r\n  (2010); Pierre, 386 S.C. at 540, 689 S.E.2d at 618.\r\nIII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Requests for\r\n  Continuance &amp; to Leave Record Open\r\n On appeal, Trotter\r\n  contends the Court of Appeals erred in finding the denial of Trane's requests\r\n  for a continuance or to leave the record open to depose Pat Charleston and Dr.\r\n  James constituted an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nA\r\n  commissioner has the authority to postpone a scheduled hearing in a workers'\r\n  compensation matter for &quot;good cause,&quot; which includes such reasons as\r\n  illness and the need for additional discovery.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-613(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2010); see also id. 67-215(A)(5) (motions). \r\nThe\r\n  granting or refusal of a request for a continuance rests in the sound\r\n  discretion of the hearing commissioner, whose ruling will not be disturbed\r\n  unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown.Â  Gurley v. Mills Mill, 225\r\n  S.C. 46, 80 S.E.2d 745 (1954); see also Williams v. Bordon's, Inc.,\r\n  274 S.C. 275, 279, 262 S.E.2d 881, 883&nbsp;(1980) (&quot;It has long been the\r\n  rule in this State that motions for a continuance are addressed to the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial judge, and his ruling will not be upset unless it\r\n  clearly appears that there was an abuse of discretion to the prejudice of\r\n  appellant.&quot;).\r\nFor\r\n  appellate purposes, an abuse of discretion occurs where the ruling is based on\r\n  an error of law or, where the ruling is grounded upon factual findings, is\r\n  without evidentiary support.Â  Sundown Operating Co. v. Intedge Indus., Inc.,\r\n  383 S.C. 601, 681 S.E.2d 885 (2009); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369,\r\n  529 S.E.2d 528 (2000); Bartlett v. Rachels, 375 S.C. 348, 652 S.E.2d 432\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007); Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 574 S.E.2d 218 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002). \r\n&quot;Of\r\n  necessity it must be left to the commission to\r\n  determine whether or not a case shall proceed to trial or be continued.&quot;Â  Gurley,\r\n  225 S.C. at 51-52, 80 S.E.2d at 747.Â  Where a party is not prejudiced by the\r\n  denial of a motion for a continuance, reversal is not required.Â  Wright v.\r\n    Hiester Constr. Co., 389 S.C. 504, 698 S.E.2d 822 (Ct. App. 2010).Â  \r\n(1)Â  Pat Charleston\r\nAs\r\n  to Charleston, he was supposed to testify at the September 20th hearing, and\r\n  his unavailability was sudden.Â  He was hospitalized on the weekend before the\r\n  hearing and had surgery the day of the hearing.Â  The commissioner granted\r\n  Trane's request to hold the record open for 14 days from the hearing date and,\r\n  when Charleston was still incapacitated at the end of that time, the\r\n  commissioner granted Trane's October 4, 2005 request for a two-week extension\r\n  and agreed to hold the record open until October 20, 2005.[4]Â \r\n  No deposition was ever scheduled, and the commissioner closed the record on\r\n  October 20, 2005.Â  Based on everything in the record, we find the commissioner did\r\n  not commit a clear abuse of discretion in closing the record.Â  \r\nWe agree\r\n  with Trane that it was not &quot;at fault&quot; in failing to obtain Charleston's\r\n  deposition, as Charleston was ill.Â  However, the Court of Appeals specifically\r\n  acknowledged that &quot;the exact date on which Charleston would become\r\n  available for a deposition was unknown[.]&quot;Â  Trotter, 384 S.C. at\r\n  117, 681 S.E.2d at 41.Â  The only medical information submitted to the\r\n  commissioner by Trane at that time came from Charleston's treating physician,\r\n  who indicated Charleston was still hospitalized, that he was unable to\r\n  participate in a deposition, and that his prognosis was &quot;poor.&quot;Â  Charleston\r\n  was suffering from a life-threatening illness (cancer) with no certain recovery\r\n  date. Â After a month, during which time no deposition was scheduled and no\r\n  update had been received from Trane, the commissioner closed the record.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the Court of Appeals states Trane did not ask the commissioner to leave the\r\n  record open &quot;indefinitely,&quot; that is, in effect, what is being urged\r\n  on appeal as there is no indication in the record that Charleston would have been\r\n  available for a deposition at any time prior to the issuance of the\r\n  commissioner's order in May 2006.Â  Trane did maintain at the appeal before the\r\n  circuit court that Charleston was then well enough to provide a deposition, but\r\n  that was in 2007, well after the 2005 hearing in this matter and the issuance\r\n  of the commissioner's order in 2006. Â To further delay the resolution of\r\n  Trotter's claim due to the continuing illness of a witness, however unfortunate\r\n  the circumstances, would not serve the interests of justice, and was a factor\r\n  necessarily considered by the commissioner in making her decision to close the\r\n  record.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  Trane has shown no prejudice on appeal.Â  Charleston's e-mail of February 28,\r\n  2005 to DeBoo was admitted into evidence.Â  The e-mail set forth the essence of Charleston's\r\n  expected testimony, i.e., that Trotter reported a back injury to him on Friday,\r\n  February 4, 2005, but she did not report it as being work-related.Â  Charleston further\r\n  stated in his e-mail that Trotter went home on Friday, February 4th, and the\r\n  next time she called, Trotter reported that she had undergone surgery and would\r\n  be out of work for a few months.Â  Thus, Charleston's account of events was in\r\n  the record for consideration by the commissioner, and Trane has not shown any\r\n  other material information that Charleston would have been able to contribute.[5]Â  No error of\r\n  law has been alleged or shown, and the commissioner's factual findings in this\r\n  regard are fully supported by the record.\r\n(2)Â  Dr. James\r\nAs\r\n  for Dr. James, we agree with Trotter that the Court of Appeals mischaracterized\r\n  the evidence when it stated Trane &quot;sought to depose Dr. James prior to the\r\n  hearing, but due to scheduling difficulties, the deposition was\r\n  scheduled for a date after the hearing.&quot;Â  Trotter, 384 S.C. at\r\n  118-19, 681 S.E.2d at 41 (emphasis added).Â  Upon reviewing the record, we find\r\n  there is evidentiary support for the commissioner's finding that Trane had the\r\n  opportunity to depose Dr. James on the agreed-upon date of September 7, 2005;\r\n  however, it chose to cancel the deposition for strategic reasons.Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 5, 2005, the Commission sent all parties a &quot;Notice of Hearing&quot;\r\n  advising them that the hearing on Trotter's claim would be held on September\r\n  20, 2005.Â  The parties initially scheduled the depositions of both Trotter and\r\n  Dr. James for August 23, 2005, but when other, unrelated hearings arose for\r\n  that date, the parties agreed to take both depositions on September 7, 2005.Â \r\n  On August 11, 2005, Trane formally noticed the depositions of both Trotter and\r\n  Dr. James for the agreed-upon date of September 7th.Â  Both Trotter and Dr.\r\n  James confirmed their availability.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  on August 29, 2005, Trane told Trotter's counsel that it wanted to postpone Dr.\r\n  James's deposition so it could have the transcript of Trotter's deposition in\r\n  hand before deposing Dr. James.Â  Trotter's counsel opposed the rescheduling,\r\n  stating she did not believe this was a legitimate reason to postpone the\r\n  proceedings.Â  Counsel stated that Dr. James would be available on September 7th\r\n  unless the Commission ordered otherwise.Â  \r\nTrane\r\n  filed a motion for a continuance with the Commission on August 31, 2005.Â  On\r\n  September 1, 2005, before a ruling had been made on the motion, Trane sent\r\n  Trotter's counsel a letter informing her that it was changing Dr. James's\r\n  deposition date from September 7th to September 14th.Â  Trane apparently\r\n  contacted Dr. James's office directly and reset the date without consulting\r\n  Trotter's counsel.Â  Trotter's counsel again opposed the rescheduling, stating\r\n  she already had three other depositions set for September 14th. Therefore, she\r\n  planned to remain available for the deposition to proceed on September 7th as\r\n  previously agreed.\r\nOn\r\n  September 7th, Trane took Trotter's deposition as noticed.Â  Dr. James was\r\n  available, but Trane cancelled his deposition and chose not to depose him at\r\n  that time.Â  The commissioner thereafter denied Trane's motion for a continuance\r\n  of the hearing, finding Trane had the opportunity to depose Dr. James, but had\r\n  elected not to proceed on the agreed-upon date of September 7th for strategic\r\n  reasons.Â  Trane's motion to hold the record open for Dr. James's deposition to\r\n  be taken on a date after the hearing was likewise denied. \r\nWe\r\n  conclude the commissioner did not abuse her discretion in denying Trane's\r\n  motions for a continuance or to hold the record open for the taking of Dr.\r\n  James's deposition.Â  Trane could have attempted to schedule the depositions\r\n  sequentially in the beginning in order to achieve its goal of having the\r\n  transcript of Trotter's deposition before deposing Dr. James.Â  However, once all\r\n  parties had consented to taking the depositions on September 7th and Trane had\r\n  formally noticed the depositions for that date, its options became more\r\n  limited.Â  Contrary to Trane's assertion, it does not have an unfettered right\r\n  to postpone the hearing simply to implement a better strategy for itself.Â \r\n  Trane assumed the risk that its motion would be denied, which was not prudent since\r\n  a continuance is not a matter of right, but of discretion.Â  See 17\r\n  C.J.S. Continuances Â§ 4 (2011) (observing continuances are not favored\r\n  and &quot;[a] party has no absolute right to a continuance as a matter of\r\n  law&quot; (footnote omitted)).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, Trane has not demonstrated any prejudice.Â  Dr. James's medical notes\r\n  were submitted to the commissioner and considered as part of the record, and on\r\n  appeal Trane has shown no material information that Dr. James would have\r\n  provided that is not already included in the record.Â  Dr. James's notes fully\r\n  address his diagnosis and treatment of Trotter's medical condition, and he\r\n  specifically conceded in his notes that he had no direct knowledge of the\r\n  circumstances surrounding Trotter's injury.Â  Consequently, we hold the\r\n  commissioner did not abuse her discretion in denying the requests for a\r\n  continuance or to hold the record open for the deposition of Dr. James to be\r\n  taken.\r\nLastly,\r\n  we discern nothing &quot;inconsistent&quot; in the commissioner's rulings to\r\n  initially leave the record open for the deposition of Charleston to be taken,\r\n  but not Dr. James, as found by the Court of Appeals.Â  Trotter, 384 S.C.\r\n  at 119 n. 2, 681 S.E.2d at 42 n.2.Â  Trane's request pertaining to Charleston\r\n  was based on medical necessity and arose suddenly, and the request as to Dr.\r\n  James was based on Trane's desire to obtain a strategic advantage.Â  The circumstances\r\n  were not similar and need not have been treated in the same manner by the\r\n  commissioner.\r\nA tribunal\r\n  necessarily exercises wide discretion in managing a case, and decisions denying\r\n  a request for a continuance are &quot;rarely&quot; overturned.Â  Morris v.\r\n    State, 371 S.C. 278, 283, 639 S.E.2d 53, 56&nbsp;(2006) (citing State v.\r\n      Lytchfield, 230 S.C. 405, 95 S.E.2d 857 (1957)); M &amp; M Group, Inc.\r\n        v. Holmes,&nbsp;379 S.C. 468, 475, 666 S.E.2d 262, 265&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n  &quot;Every reasonable presumption in favor of a proper exercise of the trial\r\n  court's discretion will be made.&quot;Â  17 C.J.S. Continuances Â§ 5\r\n  (2011).Â  Based on the foregoing, we reverse the decision of the Court of\r\n  Appeals and reinstate the order of the Commission, which had adopted the single\r\n  commissioner's findings and conclusions in full.\r\nB.&nbsp; Scrivener's Error\r\n  Regarding Date of Accident\r\n Trotter next\r\n  contends the Court of Appeals repeated a scrivener's error made by the\r\n  commissioner regarding the date of the accident and asks this Court to correct\r\n  the error or to grant her leave to petition the Commission for correction of\r\n  the date.\r\n In her order, the\r\n  commissioner stated in her &quot;Findings of Fact&quot; that (1)&nbsp;Trotter\r\n  first experienced back pain in December 2004, (2)&nbsp;Trotter felt a\r\n  &quot;pop&quot; in her back and had &quot;excruciating pain&quot; while &quot;turbulating&quot;\r\n  at work on January 31, 2005, and (3) Trotter's injury occurred &quot;in\r\n  2005.&quot;Â  All of these findings are supported by the evidence.\r\n Trotter points out,\r\n  however, that in the &quot;Conclusions of Law&quot; portion of her order, the\r\n  commissioner incorrectly states:Â  &quot;That on or about December 31, 2004 Mrs.\r\n  Trotter felt a pop in her back while working.&quot;Â  Trotter asserts the\r\n  December 31, 2004 date is incorrect as all parties concede Trotter was not even\r\n  working that day, so it is obviously a scrivener's error.Â  \r\n The Court of\r\n  Appeals stated in its recitation of the facts that Trotter felt a\r\n  &quot;pop&quot; in her back on January 31, 2005 while she was working.Â  Trotter,\r\n  384 S.C. at 112, 681 S.E.2d at 38.Â  It later quoted a passage from the\r\n  commissioner's order that contained the December 31, 2004 date that Trotter\r\n  contends is a scrivener's error.Â  Id. at 115, 681 S.E.2d at 39-40.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  response, Trane contends the issue whether the December 31, 2004 reference is a\r\n  scrivener's error is not preserved as Trotter did not attempt to resolve this\r\n  question at the Commission or in the circuit court.Â  Trane further argues the\r\n  Court of Appeals noted the inconsistencies in the dates in its opinion.Â  Trane\r\n  states Trotter cannot now argue that the inconsistency was merely a scrivener's\r\n  error, and it &quot;requests that this date, along with the date[s] of January\r\n  31, 2005 and February 4, 2005, [the date on the Form 50] remain in the record\r\n  to be resolved on remand.&quot;Â  \r\n Contrary to Trane's\r\n  assertion, the Court of Appeals did not discuss the discrepancies in the\r\n  commissioner's order.Â  Trotter did raise the issue in her petition for\r\n  rehearing to the Court of Appeals, but rehearing was denied.Â  In addition, we\r\n  find Trotter's request is not barred by principles of error preservation.Â  Cf. Rule 60(a), SCRCP (stating no explicit time limit for the correction of clerical\r\n  errors).Â  \r\nTrane\r\n  acknowledged during oral argument that the commissioner's order also contains a\r\n  second reference to the December 31, 2004 date in the &quot;Conclusions of\r\n  Law,&quot; wherein she stated Trane's workers' compensation carrier &quot;shall\r\n  reimburse Mrs. Trotter's private insurance carrier for all causally related\r\n  medical treatment incurred since the accident date of December 31, 2004.&quot;Â \r\n  Because all parties concede that Trotter was not working on December 31, 2004\r\n  and since linking the date for reimbursing medical expenses to this 2004 date\r\n  could cause confusion, we grant Trotter's request that this Court correct what\r\n  are clearly scrivener's errors.Â  We additionally direct the Commission to\r\n  correct its records to change the December 31, 2004 references to January 31,\r\n  2005.\r\nIV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\n We conclude the\r\n  Court of Appeals erred in finding the Commission abused its discretion in\r\n  denying Trane's motions for a continuance or to keep the record open for the\r\n  depositions of Charleston and Dr. James to be taken.Â  Consequently, we reverse\r\n  the opinion of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the order of the Commission.[6]Â  However, we\r\n  grant Trotter's request to correct the scrivener's errors regarding the date of\r\n  Trotter's accident and additionally direct the Commission to correct its\r\n  records to reflect this change.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Several versions of\r\n  DeBoo's name appear in the decisions of this case, but the spelling above is\r\n  supported by the record. \r\n[2]Â  Dr. James's medical notes of April 22, 2005 indicate\r\n  that due to her significant pain and the fact there could be a delay in\r\n  obtaining approval of a workers' compensation claim, he discussed with Trotter\r\n  the option of going under her regular insurance, but told her that it was her\r\n  decision and he would be willing to treat her, either way.Â  Trotter decided to\r\n  proceed under her regular insurance rather than delay her surgery. \r\n[3]Â  DeBoo, Charleston,\r\n  Cloud, and Mays were not present at the hearing.Â  Trane had terminated Cloud\r\n  for misconduct, including not following procedures, not showing up for work,\r\n  and taking part in inappropriate conversations, and his whereabouts were\r\n  unknown.Â  Charleston was hospitalized and scheduled to have surgery the day of\r\n  the hearing.Â  Barnhill Â was the only Trane employee to appear and testify for\r\n  the employer. Â No explanation was given for Traneâ€™s failure to call DeBoo and\r\n  Mays as witnesses. \r\n[4]Â  Trane contends it was\r\n  not notified of the second extension until the date the extension period\r\n  expired.Â  However, the question of notice was not addressed by the Court of\r\n  Appeals and, thus, is not properly before this Court.\r\n[5]Â  Trane need not have\r\n  relied only upon Charleston regarding notice.Â  For example, Trotter testified\r\n  that she had called the personnel office and spoke to Mays about her work injury\r\n  prior to her surgery, but we note Trane did not call Mays as a witness to\r\n  refute this testimony.Â  Additionally, Trotter and Trane note in their briefs\r\n  that Charleston is now deceased.Â  Thus, we find granting an order of remand for\r\n  his testimony would serve no purpose.\r\n[6]Â  Based on our decision, we\r\n  need not address Trotter's remaining issue, in which she argued the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in vacating the remainder of the circuit court's order and remanding\r\n  all issues to the Commission. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27025","title":"Clarendon County v.

Brunner,\r\n  Annotation, Comment note: availability of tax exemption to property held on\r\n    lease from exempt owner, 54 A.L.R.3d 402 Â§ 15, 513 (1973).\r\n\r\n In South Carolina,\r\n  this question has been answered by section 12-37-950 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2000), which provides:\r\nWhen any\r\n  leasehold estate is conveyed for a definite term by any grantor whose\r\n    property is exempt from taxation to a grantee whose property is not exempt,\r\n  the leasehold estate shall be valued for property tax purposes as real estate.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).\r\n Despite the plain\r\n  language of section 12-37-950, Tykat attempts to extrapolate a rule from our\r\n  decisions in South Carolina Public Service Authority v. Summers, 282\r\n  S.C. 148, 318 S.E.2d 113 (1984), and Charleston County Aviation Authority v.\r\n    Wasson, 277 S.C. 480, 289 S.E.2d 416 (1982), that would extend the article\r\n  X, section 3 tax exemption to lessees of property owned by a tax-exempt entity so\r\n  long as the lessees use the property for a public purpose.Â  We are constrained\r\n  to reject this approach because the cases relied on by Tykat do not address the\r\n  tax status of lessees and because the plain language of section 12-37-950\r\n  precludes the result Tykat desires.\r\n The precedents\r\n  relied upon by Tykat address whether a tax-exempt owner in fee simple retains its tax exemption when it leases real property to a private entity.Â \r\n  These cases make no mention of a tax exemption for a lessee.Â  See Summers,\r\n  282 S.C. at 150, 318 S.E.2d at 114 (&quot;The Authority paid the taxes under\r\n  protest and instituted this action to recover them . . . .&quot;); Taylor v.\r\n    Davenport, 281 S.C. 497, 316 S.E.2d 389 (1984) (holding, in a dispute between\r\n  Greenwood County and the counties of Newberry and Laurens, that property owned\r\n  by Greenwood County and leased to a private entity was exempt from taxation); Wasson,\r\n  277 S.C. at 483, 289 S.E.2d at 418 (&quot;The Authority, excepting to the\r\n  assessor's determination, sought review . . . .&quot;); cf. Quirk v.\r\n    Campbell, 302 S.C. 148, 151-53, 394 S.E.2d 320, 322-23 (1990) (holding\r\n  that, because a property was owned by Richland County and used for a public\r\n  purpose, a fee in lieu of taxes agreement concerning the property did not\r\n  violate constitutional provisions requiring uniformity in ad valorem tax\r\n  rates).\r\n By contrast, section\r\n  12-37-950 is directly on point.Â  Section 12-37-950 unambiguously requires that\r\n  Tykat's leasehold estate &quot;be valued for property tax purposes as real\r\n  estate,&quot; and it makes no mention of an exemption if the leasehold estate\r\n  is used for a public purpose.Â  Tykat has not argued section 12-37-950 runs\r\n  afoul of article X, section 3.Â  Accordingly, we are bound by the plain language\r\n  of the statute. Â See Wynn ex rel. Wynn v. Doe, 255 S.C. 509, 512,\r\n  180 S.E.2d 95, 96 (1971) (&quot;Where the language of [a] statute is plain and\r\n  unambiguous . . . the court has no right to look for or impose another\r\n  meaning.&quot;).Â  Thus, our holding is limited to Tykat's effort to apply the Summers-Wasson line of cases to lessees of real property where the grantor is exempt from\r\n  taxation.Â  Applying the plain language of section 12-37-950, we hold that\r\n  Tykat's leasehold interest was not exempt from ad valorem taxation, regardless\r\n  of whether Tykat used that interest for a public purpose.[1]Â  \r\n For these reasons,\r\n  we affirm the order of the ALC as to the issues raised in Tykat's appeal.[2]Â \r\n  We turn now to the appeal by the county.\r\nB.Â  County Appeal\r\n While the county\r\n  concedes that Tykat's argument on appeal is not frivolous, it contends Tykat\r\n  presented additional arguments that were frivolous, and therefore, the ALC\r\n  erred in failing to award attorneys' fees and costs to the county under the\r\n  Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 (2005\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2010).Â  We disagree.Â  The county focuses on certain of Tykat's\r\n  arguments below and characterizes them as frivolous.Â  We have reviewed the\r\n  ALC's denial of an award of attorneys' fees and costs under the Frivolous Civil\r\n  Proceedings Sanctions Act, and we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR. Â \r\nIII.\r\n We affirm the\r\n  decision of the ALC.Â  Based on the limited challenge raised by Tykat, its\r\n  leasehold interest was subject to ad valorem taxation under the plain language\r\n  of section 12-37-950.Â  Thus, we are bound to apply the statute as written.Â  Our Summers-Wasson line of cases does not alter this result.Â \r\n  Further, we affirm the denial of Clarendon County's request for attorneys' fees\r\n  and costs.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We note that pending legislation, if\r\n  adopted, would alter the application of section 12-37-950.Â  Specifically, Senate\r\n  Bill 844, 119th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (S.C. 2011), would amend South\r\n  Carolina Code section 12-37-220 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2010) to provide that,\r\n  &quot;[n]otwithstanding the provisions of Section 12-37-950, a leasehold\r\n  interest conveyed by the South Carolina Public Service Authority, regardless of\r\n  the use made of the leasehold interest,&quot; is exempt from ad valorem\r\n  taxation.Â  This pending legislation does not alter the resolution of Tykat's\r\n  appeal.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Tykat has\r\n  argued in the alternative that summary judgment was premature and that\r\n  additional discovery was needed.Â  However, Tykat filed a cross-motion for\r\n  summary judgment wherein it asserted there were no genuine issues of material fact\r\n  in this case.Â  Accordingly, Tykat cannot now be heard to assert that summary\r\n  judgment was premature.Â  In addition, the ALC did not rule on this issue, and\r\n  Tykat did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion seeking a ruling thereon.Â  See Home Medical Systems, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 382 S.C. 556,\r\n  562-63, 677 S.E.2d 582, 585-86 (2009) (finding issue preservation rules and\r\n  Rule 59, SCRCP, were applicable to proceedings before the ALC); Rule 29(D), SCRALC\r\n  (permitting a party to &quot;move for reconsideration of a final decision of an\r\n  administrative law judge . . . to alter or amend the final decision, subject to\r\n  the grounds for relief set forth in Rule 59, SCRCP&quot;).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27026","title":"Hilton Head v.

South Carolina Department of Transportation, 371 S.C. 598, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  437 (2007).Â  As\r\n  in Hardin, the property owner in this case was deprived of immediate left turn access to an abutting highway, but it retained a reasonable means of\r\n  ingress and egress from that highway.Â  Because Hilton Head Automotive (&quot;HHA&quot;)\r\n  was not deprived of a reasonable means of ingress and egress from Highway 278,\r\n  it did not suffer a material injury to its easement of access to that highway,\r\n  and therefore, did not suffer a compensable taking.\r\nI.\r\n In response to population growth and\r\n  business development along U.S. Highway 278 in Beaufort County, the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Transportation (&quot;the Department&quot;) engaged\r\n  experts for the purpose of streamlining the flow of traffic on that highway.Â  Relying\r\n  on the opinions of those experts, the Department determined that it should widen\r\n  the highway, close two median crossovers, and open a new median crossover at a\r\n  central location between the two intersections that bound HHA's property: Burnt\r\n  Church Road and Bluffton Road/Highway 46.\r\n The properties on the north side of Highway\r\n  278 agreed among themselves to share the cost of modifying and/or building\r\n  private roads that would allow left turn access to all of their properties by\r\n  way of the new median crossover.Â  The properties on the south side of the\r\n  highway, however, were unable to reach such an agreement.Â  As a result, HHA's\r\n  propertyâ€”which is on the south side of the highwayâ€”lost its immediate left turn\r\n  access to and from Highway 278.Â  Nonetheless, HHA retained direct right turn\r\n  access to and from the eastbound lanes of Highway 278.Â  Moreover, HHA could be\r\n  reached from the westbound lanes of Highway 278 by making a U-turn at the new\r\n  median crossover or at the lighted intersection with Bluffton Road/Highway 46.Â \r\n  Correspondingly, a vehicle exiting HHA's property could reach westbound Highway\r\n  278 by making a U-turn at Burnt Church Road.[1]\r\nHHA sought monetary and declaratory relief for\r\n  inverse condemnation, violation of its due process and equal protection rights\r\n  under the South Carolina Constitution, and civil conspiracy.Â  The Department\r\n  successfully moved for summary judgment on all causes of action.Â  We certified HHA's\r\n  appeal pursuant to Rule 204, SCACR.\r\nII.\r\n Summary judgment\r\n  &quot;shall be rendered . . . if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\nA.\r\nInverse Condemnation \r\n The South Carolina\r\n  Constitution provides, &quot;[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this\r\n  Constitution, private property shall not be taken for private use without the\r\n  consent of the owner, nor for public use without just compensation being first\r\n  made for the property.&quot;Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 13(A).Â  In an inverse\r\n  condemnation action, a private property owner seeks to establish that a\r\n  government entity has taken his or her property.Â  The governmental conduct at\r\n  issue generally takes one of two forms: (1) the entity has physically\r\n  appropriated private property or (2) the entity has imposed restrictions on the\r\n  use of the property that deprive the owner of the property's &quot;economically\r\n  viable use.&quot;Â  See, e.g., Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365\r\n  S.C. 650, 656-58, 620 S.E.2d 76, 79-80 (2005).Â  In this case, HHA has alleged\r\n  that the Department physically appropriated private property by materially\r\n  injuring an easement appurtenant thereto.[2]\r\n Following Hardin,\r\n  a proper analysis of an inverse condemnation claim premised on an alleged physical\r\n  taking must begin with a determination of the scope of the property rights at\r\n  issue.Â  371 S.C. at 605, 609, 641 S.E.2d at 441, 443 (explaining that a court\r\n  evaluating an inverse condemnation claim premised on a physical taking should &quot;focus\r\n  . . . on a landowner's actual property interests; that is, his easements&quot;).Â \r\n  As an abutting property owner, HHA had &quot;an easement for access&quot; to\r\n  Highway 278, &quot;regardless of whether [it had] access to and from an\r\n  additional public road.&quot;Â  Id. at 606, 641 S.E.2d at 442.Â  In addition,\r\n  HHA had &quot;an easement for access to and from the public road system.&quot;Â  Id.[3]Â  If governmental action\r\n  materially injured either of these easements, such that HHA no longer enjoyed\r\n  the reasonable means of access to which it was entitled, a physical taking has\r\n  occurred.[4]Â  E.g., S.C.\r\n    State Highway Dep't v. Allison, 246 S.C. 389, 393, 143 S.E.2d 800, 802\r\n  (1965) (&quot;[A]n obstruction that materially injures or deprives the abutting\r\n  property owner of ingress or egress to and from his property is a 'taking' of\r\n  the property, for which recovery may be had.&quot;); Sease v. City of\r\n    Spartanburg, 242 S.C. 520, 524-25, 131 S.E.2d 683, 685 (1963) (&quot;The\r\n  protection of [the South Carolina &quot;takings&quot; clause] extends to all\r\n  cases in which any of the essential elements of ownership has been destroyed or\r\n  impaired as the result of the construction or maintenance of a public\r\n  street.&quot;); Brown v. Hendricks, 211 S.C. 395, 403-04, 45 S.E.2d 603,\r\n  606-07 (1947) (&quot;The accessibility of one's property may in some instances\r\n  constitute a great part of its value, and to permit a material impairment of\r\n  his access would result in the destruction of a great part of the value . . .\r\n  and his property is therefore as effectually taken as if a physical invasion\r\n  was made thereon and a physical injury done thereto.&quot; (quoting with\r\n  approval Foster Lumber Co. v. Arkansas Valley &amp; Western Ry. Co., 95\r\n  P. 224, 228 (Okla. 1908))).\r\n The gravamen of\r\n  HHA's claim is that its easements included a right to make an immediate left\r\n  turn to and from Highway 278, and such right could not be infringed without\r\n  just compensation.Â  We disagree.Â  As recognized in Hardin, a regulation\r\n  or traffic control device preventing immediate left turns to or from one's\r\n  property does not result in a taking, provided it does not otherwise cause a\r\n  material injury to the abutter's easements of access.Â  371 S.C. at 607, 641\r\n  S.E.2d at 442 (&quot;[A] landowner has no right to access abutting roads in\r\n  more than one direction.&quot; (citing C.C. Marvel, Annotation, Power to\r\n    restrict or interfere with access of abutter by traffic regulations, 73\r\n  A.L.R.2d 689, 691-98 (1960))).Â  The relevant inquiry, then, is whether the\r\n  abutter has retained a reasonable means of access to and from abutting roads\r\n  and the public road system.Â  Cf. Roland F. Chase, Annotation, Abutting\r\n    owner's right to damages for limitation of access caused by conversion of\r\n    conventional road into limited-access highway, 42 A.L.R.3d 13, Â§ 3, 30\r\n  (1972) (&quot;In numerous cases . . . courts have held or recognized that an\r\n  owner of property abutting on a public street or highway is entitled to\r\n  damages where such street or highway is converted into a limited-access\r\n  highway, if as a result of such conversion access to and from his\r\n  property is made unreasonably circuitous or difficult.&quot; (first and\r\n  second emphases added)).Â  Historically, courts have rejected the view that a\r\n  regulation regarding the direction of travel upon a particular road, without\r\n  more, materially impaired an abutter's easement of access.Â  Marvel, supra,\r\n  73 A.L.R.2d at Â§ 3, 692 (&quot;Regulations and regulatory devices, applicable\r\n  to all traffic, such as . . . prohibitions against certain turns, etc., which\r\n  merely impose some circuity of route upon the abutter, have been universally\r\n  upheld against contentions that access was impaired.&quot;); see also S.C.\r\n    State Highway Dep't v.

State Highway Dep't v. Wilson, 254 S.C. 360,\r\n  365-66, 175 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1970) (recognizing that the &quot;clear weight of\r\n  authority from other jurisdictions is to the effect that the construction of a\r\n  median, or other traffic control device[], is an exercise of the police power&quot;).Â \r\n  HHA has not presented any evidence that would justify a departure from this\r\n  well-established rule.Â  Rather, the undisputed facts reveal that HHA could\r\n  access the westbound lanes of Highway 278 with only minor inconvenience.Â  As a\r\n  matter of law, HHA's abutter's access to Highway 278 has not been materially\r\n  impaired. Â Therefore, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in\r\n  favor of the Department.\r\n At oral argument,\r\n  HHA relied heavily on our decision in South Carolina State Highway\r\n    Department v. Wilson.Â  Wilson concerned whether, in the context of a\r\n  clear exercise of the power of eminent domain, a median closure could form a\r\n  compensable element of the damages.[5]Â  In this case, we find no\r\n  taking has occurred, and therefore, we do not reach the issue of damages.Â  Wilson does not apply.\r\n For these reasons,\r\n  we uphold the circuit court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of\r\n  the Department on HHA's inverse condemnation claim.\r\nB.\r\nCollateral Claims \r\n As part of the same\r\n  project to streamline traffic on Highway 278, the Department initially planned\r\n  to condemn a portion of HHA's property and construct a deceleration lane serving\r\n  vehicles turning right onto that property.Â  However, the Department later\r\n  changed its plans to avoid the need to acquire property from HHA.Â  HHA alleged the\r\n  Department's decision in this regard amounted to a civil conspiracy\r\n  orchestrated to put HHA at a strategic disadvantage by forcing it to bring an\r\n  inverse condemnation claim, in violation of HHA's right to due process of law.Â \r\n  In addition, because the Department compensated certain other property owners\r\n  for damages caused by the project and included some owners in discussions\r\n  regarding the placement of the new median crossover, HHA claimed the Department\r\n  violated HHA's right to equal protection.Â  Having carefully reviewed the record,\r\n  we find HHA has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to these collateral\r\n  claims.\r\nIII.\r\n The median closure in\r\n  this case did not work a material injury to HHA's easements of access to\r\n  Highway 278, and therefore, did not amount to a physical taking of HHA's\r\n  property.Â  Further, HHA has failed to create a genuine issue of fact as to its\r\n  collateral claims.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court granting summary\r\n  judgment in favor of the Department is\r\n\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Bluffton Road is approximately 0.6 miles west\r\n  of the entrance to HHA's property.Â  Burnt Church Road is a mere 0.3 miles east\r\n  of the entrance.\r\n[2]&nbsp; HHA has presented this matter to us solely\r\n  in the context of a physical taking; we resolve the issue in the manner\r\n  presented to us.\r\n[3]&nbsp; In City of Rock Hill v. Cothran,\r\n  this Court also recognized an abutter's right to proceed upon the abutting road\r\n  to the next intersection.Â  209 S.C. 357, 369, 40 S.E.2d 239, 244 (1946)\r\n  (&quot;[T]he right of an abutting landowner to passage at least to the next\r\n  intersection is a substantial property right . . . .&quot;); see also Powell\r\n    v. Spartanburg County, 136 S.C. 371, 374-76, 134 S.E. 367, 368 (1926)\r\n  (holding that, where a portion of a road was formally discontinued and a new\r\n  road was built to route traffic around the discontinued portion such that the\r\n  two roads formed a semicircle pattern, property owners abutting on the old road\r\n  &quot;could not rightfully be deprived of the privilege of still using it to\r\n  reach the newly located portion [of the road] in either direction,&quot;\r\n  and therefore, nonsuit was improper where access to the new road was cut off at\r\n  the south end of the old road, even though the new road was accessible from the\r\n  north end of the old road (emphasis added)).Â  While Hardin overruled Cothran in certain respects, it did not expressly overrule the existence of this\r\n  property right.Â  We take no position regarding the status of this right, as HHA\r\n  has not lost the ability to proceed upon Highway 278 to the next intersection.\r\n[4]&nbsp; Certain language in Hardin might suggest\r\n  this &quot;material injury&quot; test is no longer good law.Â  We take this\r\n  opportunity to clarify.Â  The &quot;material injury&quot; test is firmly rooted\r\n  in our jurisprudence, and Hardin did not overrule this well-established\r\n  aspect of our takings analysis.Â  See Hardin, 371 S.C. at 609, 641\r\n  S.E.2d at 443 (&quot;We therefore overrule the 'special injury' analysis . . .\r\n  and specify that our focus in these cases is on how any road re-configuration\r\n  affects a property owner's easements.&quot;); id. at 609 n.4, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  at 443 n.4 (&quot;[N]either landowner . . . has been deprived of ingress\r\n  or egress . . . nor have these landowners been injured in their\r\n  ability to enter or exit their property.&quot; (emphasis added)).\r\n[5]&nbsp; 254 S.C. at 368-69, 175 S.E.2d at 396\r\n  (&quot;[I]n the instant case the proposed median is only an incidental part of\r\n  the overall Department plans . . . .

Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â Â Â Â  In this appeal from\r\n  convictions for criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, kidnapping, and assault\r\n  and battery of a high and aggravated nature, Petitioner Roy Otis Tennant\r\n  challenges the trial court's rulings on several evidentiary issues.Â  In\r\n  particular, Tennant argues the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of\r\n  a forensic psychologist, erred in excluding a note written by Tennant and\r\n  addressed to the victim, and erred in excluding proffered statements regarding\r\n  the sexual history between the victim and the defendant.Â  We affirm the court\r\n  of appeals' opinion as modified.\r\nI.\r\n The allegations\r\n  against Tennant, according to the victim's testimony, were as follows.Â  The\r\n  victim was married to Tennant for approximately nine or ten years prior to the\r\n  incident in question, which occurred on November 26, 2001.Â  However, the victim\r\n  had lived separately from Tennant since February 2001 and had obtained an order\r\n  of protection against him.Â  On November 26, 2001, Tennant and the victim\r\n  attended a hearing regarding their pending divorce.Â  Following the hearing, the\r\n  victim took some clothes to a laundromat and then went to work.Â  Tennant called\r\n  the victim several times during her shift, saying that he did not want to\r\n  divorce her and that he had &quot;something&quot; for her.\r\n After work, the\r\n  victim proceeded to the home of Tennant's grandmother, who watched the victim's\r\n  children while the victim worked.Â  Tennant lived at his grandmother's home.Â \r\n  Upon the victim's arrival, Tennant approached her car and began accusing her of\r\n  seeing another man.Â  Tennant entered the vehicle and sat on the passenger\r\n  side.Â  Suddenly, Tennant placed a rope or cord around the victim's neck and began\r\n  to strangle her.Â  Tennant then pulled the victim from her car, dragging her on\r\n  the ground, and placed her in the trunk of her own vehicle.Â  At some point\r\n  during this attack, the victim passed out.\r\n The victim awoke in\r\n  the trunk of a car. Â From the trunk, she managed to push the car's speakers up\r\n  and out of their proper place, onto the ledge behind the back seat.Â  The car\r\n  stopped, and Tennant opened the trunk.Â  The victim found that Tennant had taken\r\n  her to a dark, wooded area.Â  At some point, Tennant duct taped the victim's\r\n  arms together, but the victim later persuaded him to remove the tape.Â  Tennant\r\n  showed the victim a knife and threatened to stab her if she attempted to flee.\r\n Tennant apologized\r\n  for his actions and explained that he did not want a divorce.Â  Tennant then\r\n  asked the victim to have sex with him.Â  Under the circumstances, the victim\r\n  relented.Â  She testified that she did so out of fear for her life.Â  Tennant\r\n  removed the victim's clothing, spread the clothing from the laundromat on the\r\n  ground, and had sex with the victim.Â  Tennant then helped the victim get\r\n  dressed, and he asked her whether she was going to tell the police what had\r\n  occurred.Â  Tennant told the victim that he would run if the victim reported his\r\n  actions.\r\n Tennant drove the\r\n  victim back to his grandmother's house.Â  Upon their arrival at the house,\r\n  Tennant instructed the victim to go to a bedroom and remain there until she\r\n  took the children to school the next morning.Â  During the night, Tennant again had\r\n  sex with the victim.Â  While taking the children to school, the victim flagged\r\n  down a police officer and reported the incident.Â  According to the victim,\r\n  Tennant's grandmother's car passed in front of the police station &quot;once or\r\n  a few times&quot; while the victim's car was parked at the station.Â  Tennant\r\n  was arrested later that day.Â  According to evidence proffered by Tennant, at\r\n  the time of his arrest, Tennant had overdosed on prescription medication.\r\n At trial, the State\r\n  introduced testimony from several witnesses corroborating aspects of the victim's\r\n  story.Â  For example, the officer to whom the victim first reported the incident\r\n  confirmed the victim had &quot;marks around her neck.&quot;Â  In addition, the\r\n  nurse who collected evidence from the victim using a sexual assault kit testified\r\n  that, during the examination, she noticed abrasions on the victim's lower back,\r\n  breast, shin, knee, and knuckles.Â  She also noticed leaves in the victim's hair\r\n  and on the victim's body.[1] Moreover, the State\r\n  introduced several articles of clothing with dirt and grass stains on them,\r\n  along with a videotape showing the victim's car with the speakers displaced\r\n  onto the ledge behind the back seat.\r\n The State also introducedâ€”without\r\n  objectionâ€”a letter written by Tennant to the victim approximately eight to nine\r\n  months following the attack.Â  In this letter, Tennant apologized for &quot;everything\r\n  that happened back in November.&quot;Â  Pursuant to Rule 106, SCRE, Tennant then\r\n  sought to introduce a note found by law enforcement when Tennant was served\r\n  with the arrest warrant on the day following the attack.Â  Tennant has\r\n  consistently referred to this note as a &quot;suicide note&quot; because he had\r\n  overdosed on prescription medication around the time it was written.Â  The note\r\n  makes no mention of suicide, however.Â  Rather, it simply recounts Tennant's view\r\n  that his sexual encounter with the victim was consensual.Â  The trial court denied\r\n  Tennant's request to introduce the note.\r\n On\r\n  cross-examination, Tennant questioned the victim about whether she had visited\r\n  Tennant in jail after she obtained the order of protection against him.Â  He\r\n  also questioned her about whether she had Thanksgiving dinner at Tennant's\r\n  grandmother's house prior to the incident. Â The victim testified she did not\r\n  remember either visit.Â  She did admit, however, that she was wearing Tennant's\r\n  shirt when the attack occurred and that she had retained &quot;three or four&quot;\r\n  other shirts belonging to Tennant because she &quot;wanted to keep&quot; them.Â  \r\n Once the State\r\n  rested, Tennant proffered testimony by Dr. Donna Marie Schwartz-Watts, an\r\n  expert in forensic psychology, regarding Tennant's mental condition and his\r\n  perception that his relationship with the victim was ongoing.Â  This testimony\r\n  included references to the purported suicide note.Â  Tennant also proffered evidence\r\n  regarding the victim's sexual history.Â  The trial court excluded the proffered\r\n  evidence.Â  Ultimately, Tennant did not testify in his own defense or call any\r\n  other witnesses.Â  In closing, Tennant argued his relationship with the victim\r\n  was ongoing and the sexual encounter was consensual.\r\n Tennant was\r\n  convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, kidnapping, and\r\n  assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. Â The court of appeals\r\n  affirmed.Â  State v. Tennant, 383 S.C. 245, 678 S.E.2d 812 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009).Â  We granted Tennant's petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\nII.\r\n In this appeal,\r\n  Tennant argues the trial court erred in excluding Dr. Schwartz-Watts' testimony.Â \r\n  Tennant further argues the trial court erred in excluding the purported suicide\r\n  note.Â  Finally, Tennant argues proffered information regarding the sexual\r\n  history between the victim and the defendant was not barred by South Carolina's\r\n  &quot;rape shield&quot; statuteâ€”S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-659.1 (2003)â€”and\r\n  therefore, the trial court erred in excluding it.Â  We consider each issue in\r\n  turn.\r\nA.\r\nTestimony of Dr.\r\n  Schwartz-Watts\r\nTennant contends that Dr. Schwartz-Watts' testimony\r\n  was admissible to show Tennant's &quot;state of mind at the time of the alleged\r\n  crime.&quot;Â  In addition, he contends Dr. Schwartz-Watts' testimony should\r\n  have been admitted for the purpose of impeaching the victim's credibility with\r\n  regard to whether the victim visited Tennant while he was in jail.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n In general, a\r\n  witness may not testify as to matters about which she has no personal\r\n  knowledge.Â  An exception to this rule permits testimony by an expert witness.Â  Rule\r\n  602, SCRE.Â  An expert may testify &quot;[i]f scientific, technical, or other\r\n  specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence\r\n  or to determine a fact in issue&quot; and the witness is duly qualified.Â  Rule\r\n  702, SCRE.\r\n In this case, the\r\n  only states of mind relevant to Tennant's guilt were (a) Tennant's capacity to\r\n  tell right from wrong; (b) Tennant's ability to conform his actions to the requirements\r\n  of law; and (c) the issue of consent.[2]Â  Dr. Schwartz-Watts\r\n  opined that &quot;although [Tennant] was suffering from Schizoaffective\r\n  Disorder and cocaine dependence at the time of the offense, these illnesses did\r\n  not prevent him from knowing legal and moral right from wrong, nor did they\r\n  prevent him from recognizing the wrongfulness of his actions.&quot;Â  In\r\n  addition, she opined that Tennant &quot;did have the capacity to conform his\r\n  conduct to the requirements of the law.&quot;Â  Thus, the only state of mind\r\n  left in contention was the matter of consent.\r\n As Dr.\r\n  Schwartz-Watts recognized, the issue of consent was a matter &quot;outside the\r\n  realm of [her] expertise.&quot;Â  Nonetheless, Tennant attempted to use the\r\n  doctor as a conduit for the introduction of his own statements regarding his\r\n  belief that the victim consented to their encounter.Â  For example, Dr.\r\n  Schwartz-Watts testified Tennant reported to her that he believed the sex was\r\n  consensual.Â  These statements were inadmissible hearsay.Â  See Rule\r\n  803(3), SCRE.\r\n Tennant also sought\r\n  to use Dr. Schwartz-Watts to introduce his out-of-court assertions that the\r\n  victim had visited him in jail after having obtained an order of protection\r\n  against him.Â  These assertions were made to another doctor and recorded in that\r\n  doctor's notes.Â  Dr. Schwartz-Watts had no personal knowledge of the victim's\r\n  alleged visits with Tennant, and this factual issue required no special\r\n  expertise.Â  Thus, the testimony was properly excluded. Â Rule 602, SCRE\r\n  (requiring a witness other than an expert to have personal knowledge of the matters\r\n  testified to); cf. State v. Douglas, 380 S.C. 499, 501-03 &amp;\r\n  n.2, 671 S.E.2d 606, 608-09 &amp; n.2 (2009) (holding a forensic interviewer's\r\n  personal observations of alleged victims did not require specialized knowledge,\r\n  and therefore, qualification as an expert was unnecessary).\r\n In sum, because Dr.\r\n  Schwartz-Watts could offer no &quot;scientific, technical, or other specialized\r\n  knowledge&quot; that would assist the jury in deciding the issue of consent,\r\n  and because she had no personal knowledge regarding the factual issues raised\r\n  by Tennant, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr.\r\n  Schwartz-Watts' testimony.Â  See State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201,\r\n  208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006) (&quot;The admission of evidence is within the\r\n  discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;).\r\nB.\r\nThe Purported Suicide Note\r\nTennant's second and third issues on appeal address\r\n  the admissibility of the purported suicide note.Â  As with any issue regarding\r\n  the admissibility of evidence, we review the trial court's ruling for abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Id.\r\n The purported\r\n  suicide note read as follows:\r\n\r\n [Victim]\r\nYou told the police that I raped you and you know I\r\n  did not you told me that you wanted to make love to me from the first day I got\r\n  out of jail and you hadn't [al]ready because you said I may try and use it\r\n  against you in our divorce I asked you did you want to make love to me and you\r\n  said yes and started kissing me[.]\r\n\r\n1. Rule 106, SCRE\r\n Tennant argues the trial\r\n  court erred in excluding the purported suicide note because, pursuant to Rule\r\n  106, SCRE, it should have been admitted as a matter of &quot;fairness&quot;\r\n  once the State introduced a letter in which Tennant apologized to the victim.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  However, because the court of appeals' opinion suggests an\r\n  improper standard for the application of Rule 106, we affirm the court of\r\n  appeals' opinion as modified.\r\n The apologetic\r\n  letter introduced by the State read in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n [Victim]\r\nHey you just can't imagine how happy I was to get your\r\n  letter.Â  I understand exactly what you [meant] and in response to your letter,\r\n  I want you to know that I am very deeply sorry for everything that happened\r\n  back in November and I pray desperately each night that the Lord will help you\r\n  forgive me and put this behind us an[d] ease your pain.Â  All I can do right now\r\n  is pray.Â  And its [sic] very important to me that you accept my apology. . . .\r\n  [Y]ou will find that the spirit of the Lord will convict you to forgive me for\r\n  what happened.Â  There are a lot of things that I want to openly express my\r\n  fe[e]lings about you and the heart of all of this confu[sion].Â  But to write\r\n  you a letter explaining fe[e]lings and emotions would may well do more harm\r\n  than good.Â  Thats [sic] why I haven't done it [al]ready. . . . [Victim] I need\r\n  you to forgive me for more than one reason but two.Â  One is because I am\r\n  real[l]y and tru[ly] sorry for what happened and unless I fe[e]l that you have\r\n  forgiven me it will be hard for me to be at peace with myself.Â  And the second\r\n  reason is because I want to do what God expects me to do. . . . \r\n. . . .\r\nYou ask\r\n  me how can I talk about the Gospel of Jesus Christ after doing such a horrible\r\n  thing.Â  \r\n  \r\n Ask\r\n  someone that [sic] knows the word of God . . . .\r\n Saul\r\n  once killed Christians . . . yet God found favor with Saul . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\n According to the\r\n  victim, this letter was one of a series of three letters.Â  The first letter was\r\n  written by Tennant to the victim; in that letter, Tennant discussed his belief\r\n  in God and his desire to be the victim's friend.Â  The victim responded with a\r\n  letter expressing that she &quot;couldn't understand how he could bring God out\r\n  of his mouth after he did what he did, [and] wouldn't even tell [her] . . .\r\n  that he was sorry for doing what he done.&quot;Â  The apologetic letter quoted\r\n  above was Tennant's response to the victim.Â  The purported suicide note, on the\r\n  other hand, was written at least eight months prior to this three-letter\r\n  exchange.Â  Moreover, the &quot;suicide note&quot; was a unilateral statement by\r\n  Tennant; it was not part of an ongoing conversation between Tennant and the\r\n  victim.\r\n\r\n Rule 106 provides:\r\nWhen a\r\n  writing, or recorded statement, or part thereof is introduced by a party, an\r\n  adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or\r\n  any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be\r\n  considered contemporaneously with it.\r\n\r\n The court of\r\n  appeals found &quot;[t]he trial court did not err by rejecting [Tennant's Rule\r\n  106 argument] because the contents of the suicide note and the response letter\r\n  are starkly different, and the writings were not contemporaneous or responsive\r\n  to one another.&quot;\r\n Rule 106 does not require\r\n  that the writings at issue be written contemporaneously.Â  Rather, the temporal\r\n  element of Rule 106 concerns the order of proof.Â  State v. Taylor, 333\r\n  S.C. 159, 170-71, 508 S.E.2d 870, 876 (1998) (&quot;Rule 106 . . . is a\r\n  procedural device governing the timing of completion evidence; the Rule\r\n  is 'primarily designed to affect the order of proof.'&quot; (emphasis added)\r\n  (quoting U.S. v. Walker, 652 F.2d 708, 713 (7th Cir. 1981))).Â  Moreover,\r\n  Rule 106 does not require that the writings at issue be &quot;responsive to one\r\n  another.&quot;Â  The plain language of the rule permits introduction of &quot;any\r\n  other part or any other writing . . . which ought in fairness to be\r\n  considered contemporaneously.&quot;Â  (Emphasis added).Â  The standard here is &quot;fairness,&quot;\r\n  not responsiveness.Â  See generally Fed. R. Evid. 106 advisory committee's\r\n  note (1972 proposed rules) (&quot;The [corresponding federal] rule is based on\r\n  two considerations.Â  The first is the misleading impression created by taking\r\n  matters out of context.Â  The second is the inadequacy of repair work when\r\n  delayed to a point later in the trial.&quot;).Â  In sum, the court of appeals\r\n  erred to the extent it upheld the trial court's exclusion of the purported suicide\r\n  note on the ground that the note was not written contemporaneously with, or in\r\n  response to, the apologetic letter introduced by the State.\r\n Nevertheless, the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tennant's request to admit\r\n  the purported suicide note pursuant to Rule 106.Â  Tennant's note disclaiming\r\n  responsibility for the alleged crime, while relevant, was not so inextricably\r\n  connected to the letter introduced by the State that its omission was patently\r\n  unfair.Â  Thus, we defer to the trial court's exercise of discretion.\r\n We turn now to the\r\n  question of whether the purported suicide note was admissible via an exception\r\n  to the hearsay rule.\r\n2. Hearsay\r\nTennant\r\n  further argues the purported suicide note was admissible because it was\r\n  probative of his state of mind and of the issue of consent.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe &quot;state\r\n  of mind&quot; exception to the hearsay rule is set forth in Rule 803(3), SCRE:\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is\r\n  available as a witness:\r\n. . . .\r\n(3) Then\r\n  Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition. Â A statement of the\r\n  declarant's then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical\r\n  condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and\r\n  bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove\r\n    the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution,\r\n  revocation, identification, or terms of declarant's will.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).\r\n In the purported\r\n  suicide note, Tennant recounted that the victim consented to their sexual\r\n  encounter.Â  This statement of Tennant's memory regarding his sexual encounter\r\n  with the victim was offered to prove the truth of the matter assertedâ€”that his\r\n  memory was correct.Â  Therefore, the note was hearsay.Â  The note was properly excluded\r\n  according to the plain language of Rule 803(3) because it was &quot;a statement\r\n  of memory or belief [offered] to prove the fact remembered or believed.&quot;Â \r\n  As we explained in State v. Garcia:\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  purpose of th[e] exclusion [in Rule 803(3)] is &quot;to avoid the virtual\r\n  destruction of the hearsay rule which would otherwise result from allowing\r\n  state of mind, provable by a hearsay statement, to serve as a basis for an\r\n  inference of the happening of the event which produced the state of mind.&quot;Â \r\n  Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(3), FRE. Â Consequently, while the present\r\n  state of the declarant's mind is admissible as an exception to hearsay, the\r\n    reason for the declarant's state of mind is not. Â United States v. Cohen,\r\n  631 F.2d 1223, 1225 (5th Cir. 1980) (&quot;But the state-of-mind exception does\r\n  not permit the witness to relate any of the declarant's statements as to why he\r\n  held the particular state of mind, or what he might have believed that would\r\n  have induced the state of mind.Â  If the reservation in the text of the rule\r\n    is to have any effect, it must be understood to narrowly limit those admissible\r\n    statements to declarations of condition-'I'm scared'-and not belief-'I'm scared\r\n    because [someone] threatened me'.&quot;).\r\n\r\n334 S.C. 71, 76, 512 S.E.2d\r\n  507, 509 (1999) (emphasis added).Â  Accordingly, Tennant could not introduce the\r\n  note for the purpose of showing that the victim wanted to make love to him.[3]\r\n For these reasons, we\r\n  hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the purported suicide\r\n  note.Â  We affirm the court of appeals' decision as modified in order to clarify\r\n  the proper analysis of Rule 106, SCRE.\r\nC.\r\nRape Shield\r\n Last, Tennant argues\r\n  the court of appeals erred in upholding the trial court's determination that South\r\n  Carolina Code section 16-3-659.1 barred any evidence regarding the sexual\r\n  history between the victim and Tennant.Â  We agree.Â  Nevertheless, because the\r\n  proffered testimony was not relevant, we affirm as modified.\r\n Statutory\r\n  interpretation is a question of law.Â  See Bryant v. State, 384\r\n  S.C. 525, 529, 683 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (citing Catawba Indian Tribe of\r\n    S.C. v. State, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007)).Â  &quot;We\r\n  are free to decide a question of law with no particular deference to the\r\n  circuit court.&quot; Catawba Indian Tribe, 372 S.C. at 524, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  at 753.Â  &quot;A statute's language must be construed in light of the intended\r\n  purpose of the statute. \r\n\r\nWhenever possible,\r\n  legislative intent should be found in the plain language of the statute itself.&quot; State v. Gaines, 380 S.C. 23, 33, 667 S.E.2d 728, 733 (2008).\r\n\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina Code section 16-3-659.1(1) provides:\r\nEvidence\r\n  of specific instances of the victim's sexual conduct, opinion evidence of the\r\n  victim's sexual conduct, and reputation evidence of the victim's sexual conduct\r\n  is not admissible in prosecutions under Sections 16-3-615 and 16-3-652 to\r\n  16-3-656; however, evidence of the victim's sexual conduct with the defendant\r\n  or evidence of specific instances of sexual activity with persons other than\r\n  the defendant introduced to show source or origin of semen, pregnancy, or\r\n  disease about which evidence has been introduced previously at trial is\r\n  admissible if the judge finds that such evidence is relevant to a material fact\r\n  and issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not\r\n  outweigh its probative value. Â Evidence of specific instances of sexual\r\n  activity which would constitute adultery and would be admissible under rules of\r\n  evidence to impeach the credibility of the witness may not be excluded.\r\n\r\nThis is commonly known as the\r\n  &quot;rape shield&quot; statute.\r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals held the phrase &quot;introduced to show source or origin of\r\n  semen, pregnancy, or disease&quot; operated to preclude evidence of the victim's\r\n  sexual conduct with the defendant unless introduced to show the source\r\n  or origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease.Â  Tennant arguesâ€”and we agreeâ€”that this\r\n  construction was improper.\r\nBy\r\n  our reading, the word &quot;or&quot; separating evidence of the victim's\r\n  conduct with the defendant from evidence of the victim's conduct with other\r\n  persons has the effect of creating two distinct forms of permissible evidence:\r\n  (1) evidence of the victim's conduct with the defendant; and (2) evidence of\r\n  specific instances of the victim's conduct with a third party introduced for\r\n  the purpose of showing the source or origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease.Â  Thus,\r\n  the requirement of an evidentiary nexus to &quot;source or origin of semen,\r\n  pregnancy, or disease&quot; applies only to evidence of the victim's sexual conduct\r\n  with persons other than the defendant.Â  The rape shield statute imposes no such\r\n  limitation concerning a victim's sexual conduct with a defendant.\r\nMany\r\n  jurisdictions separate these two forms of permissible evidence in their rape\r\n  shield statutes.Â  See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 412(b) (&quot;In a criminal\r\n  case, the following evidence is admissible, if otherwise admissible under these\r\n  rules: (A) evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior . . . offered to\r\n  prove that a person other than the accused was the source of semen, injury or\r\n  other physical evidence; (B) evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior\r\n  . . . with respect to the person accused . . . offered by the accused to prove\r\n  consent or by the prosecution . . . .&quot;); Colo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 18-3-407(1) (2010)\r\n  (creating a presumption that evidence of a victim's sexual conduct is &quot;irrelevant&quot;\r\n  except &quot;(a) Evidence of the victim's . . . sexual conduct with the actor;\r\n  (b) Evidence of specific instances of sexual activity showing the source or\r\n  origin of semen . . . or any similar evidence of sexual intercourse offered for\r\n  the purpose of showing that the act or acts charged were or were not committed\r\n  by the defendant.&quot;); N.J. Stat. Ann. Â§ 2C:14-7 (West 2005);[4] Va. Code Ann. Â§ 18.2-67.7(A) (2009) (amended 2011) (listing as permissible: &quot;1.\r\n  Evidence offered to provide an alternative explanation for physical evidence of\r\n  the offense charged . . . limited to evidence designed to explain the presence\r\n  of semen, pregnancy, disease, or physical injury . . .; or 2. Evidence of\r\n  sexual conduct between the complaining witness and the accused offered to\r\n  support a contention that the alleged offense was not accomplished by force,\r\n  threat or intimidation . . . .&quot;).\r\nMontana's\r\n  rape shield statute is particularly similar to our own.Â  The Montana Code\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\nEvidence\r\n  concerning the sexual conduct of the victim is inadmissible in prosecutions\r\n  under this part except evidence of the victim's past sexual conduct with the\r\n  offender or evidence of specific instances of the victim's sexual activity to\r\n  show the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease that is at issue in the\r\n  prosecution.\r\n\r\nMont. Code Ann. Â§ 45-5-511(2)\r\n  (2009). Â The Montana Supreme Court interpreted this statute to permit two\r\n  distinct types of evidence: (a) evidence of &quot;conduct involv[ing] the defendant\r\n  as a participant&quot; and (b) &quot;where an issue exists as to the origin of\r\n  semen, pregnancy or disease . . . conduct [that] is probative on that issue.&quot;Â  State ex rel. Mazurek v. District Court, 922 P.2d 474, 477 (Mont. 1996).\r\n  Â We find these authorities persuasive.\r\n For these reasons,\r\n  we find that section 16-3-659.1 does not bar evidence of a victim's sexual\r\n  conduct with a defendant, provided that such evidence is otherwise admissible.Â \r\n  The trial court and court of appeals erred in limiting evidence of this kind to\r\n  circumstances in which it is introduced to show the source or origin of semen,\r\n  pregnancy, or disease.Â  Â Â Â Â  Nonetheless, Tennant was not prejudiced the error.\r\n Tennant's proffered\r\n  evidence included a wide range of allegations regarding the victim's sexual\r\n  behavior and her relationship with Tennant.Â  However, the only allegations at\r\n  issue in this appeal are those concerning sexual conduct between Tennant and\r\n  the victim.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily, no point\r\n  will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on\r\n  appeal.&quot;).Â  Specifically, Tennant argues the jury was deprived of evidence\r\n  that the victim wanted Tennant &quot;to hurt her&quot; in order to achieve\r\n  sexual satisfaction and that Tennant refused to do so.Â  Tennant contends this\r\n  evidence was relevant to his defense of consent.\r\n There is nothing in\r\n  the record to suggest that the sexual conduct that formed the basis of the\r\n  crimes charged involved &quot;rough sex&quot; or an attempt to sexually satisfy\r\n  the victim through the infliction of pain.Â  The physical examination of the\r\n  victim on the day following the attack did not reveal any signs of vaginal\r\n  trauma.Â  The victim testified to violence while Tennant choked her and placed\r\n  her in the trunk of her vehicle, but there is no evidence that Tennant engaged\r\n  in violence during the sexual activities that followed.Â  Rather, the victim\r\n  testified she peacefully submitted to Tennant's request for sex out of fear for\r\n  her life.Â  In short, evidence that the victim might have enjoyed &quot;rough\r\n  sex&quot; with Tennant during their marriage did not tend to show that the\r\n  victim consented to the sexual encounter on the night in question.[5]\r\n Because we find the\r\n  proffered evidence regarding sexual conduct between Tennant and the victim was\r\n  irrelevant, we find Tennant was not prejudiced by the trial court's error in\r\n  interpreting section 16-3-659.1.Â  See Taylor, 333 S.C. at 172,\r\n  508 S.E.2d at 876 (&quot;[I]n order for this Court to reverse a case based on\r\n  the erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence, prejudice must be shown.&quot;);\r\n  Rule 220(c), SCACR (&quot;The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order,\r\n  decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.&quot;). \r\nIII.\r\n In sum, we agree\r\n  that the court of appeals' opinion requires clarification in two respects: (1)\r\n  Rule 106, SCRE, does not require that the writings at issue be created\r\n  contemporaneously or in response to one another; and (2) South Carolina Code\r\n  section 16-3-659.1 (the rape shield statute) does not bar evidence of sexual\r\n  conduct between the victim of a sexual crime and the accused, so long as that\r\n  evidence is otherwise admissible.Â  We find no prejudice from these errors, and\r\n  therefore, we uphold Tennant's convictions and sentence. \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; It is undisputed that Tennant's DNA matched\r\n  the semen recovered during this examination.\r\n[2]&nbsp; As explained in Gill v. State, the\r\n  defense of &quot;diminished capacity&quot; is not recognized in this State.Â \r\n  346 S.C. 209, 220, 552 S.E.2d 26, 32 (2001).Â  Even if diminished capacity could\r\n  have been a defense, Tennant repeatedly disclaimed any desire to set forth a\r\n  diminished capacity defense, and Dr. Schwartz-Watts offered no evidence that\r\n  would support a diminished capacity theory in this case.Â  Specifically, she testified\r\n  there was &quot;no evidence that because of a psychiatric disorder . . .\r\n  [Tennant] could have perceived it to be consent.&quot;Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n[3]&nbsp; To the extent Tennant contends the note was\r\n  not hearsay because it was offered for the purpose of showing his state of mind\r\n  (rather than for the truth of the matters asserted), we note that Tennant's\r\n  state of mind at or near the time of his arrest was not at issue.Â  This\r\n  self-serving declaration of innocence, made after the crime was complete and\r\n  after Tennant became aware that the victim had reported his actions to the\r\n  police, was not probative of Tennant's state of mind at the time of the sexual\r\n  encounter.Â  Thus, if the note was not hearsay, it also was not relevant.\r\n[4]&nbsp; See infra n.5.\r\n[5]&nbsp; The potential relevance of evidence\r\n  regarding a victim's sexual conduct with a defendant is aptly explained in New\r\n  Jersey's rape shield statute, which provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\nc.\r\n  Evidence of previous sexual conduct with persons other than the defendant . . .\r\n  shall not be considered relevant unless it is material to proving the source of\r\n  semen, pregnancy or disease. \r\nd.\r\n  Evidence of the victim's previous sexual conduct with the defendant shall be\r\n  considered relevant if it is probative of whether a reasonable person, knowing\r\n  what the defendant knew at the time of the alleged offense, would have\r\n    believed that the alleged victim freely and affirmatively permitted the sexual\r\n    behavior complained of.\r\n\r\nN.J.

Brewton Hagood, of Rosen Rosen &amp; Hagood, LLC,\r\n          of Charleston, for Amicus Curiae Charleston County School District.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n___________\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE: In this\r\n  commercial general liability (&quot;CGL&quot;) policy dispute, we issued an\r\n  opinion on January 7, 2011, finding no coverage.Â  We subsequently granted a\r\n  rehearing petition and received numerous amici briefs.Â  Today, we withdraw our\r\n  initial opinion and issue this opinion, finding the CGL policies provide\r\n  coverage for the stipulated progressive property damages.\r\nAppellant/Respondent\r\n  Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company (&quot;Harleysville&quot;) issued a series\r\n  of standard CGL policies to the Respondent developers or their predecessors (collectively\r\n  &quot;Crossmann&quot;) for a series of condominium projects in the Myrtle Beach\r\n  area of South Carolina.Â  The exterior components of the condominium projects were\r\n  negligently constructed, which resulted in water penetration and progressive\r\n  damage to otherwise nondefective components of the condominium projects.Â  The homeowners\r\n  settled their lawsuits against Respondents.Â  Crossmann then filed this declaratory\r\n  judgment action to determine coverage under Harleysville's policies.Â  Prior to\r\n  trial, several of Crossmann's other insurers settled with Crossmann, providing\r\n  coverage for the homeowners' claims. Â Based on the remaining parties'\r\n  stipulations and our suggestion in L-J, Inc. v. Bituminous Fire &amp; Marine\r\n    Insurance Co., 366 S.C. 117, 123 n.4, 621 S.E.2d 33, 36 n.4 (2005), that a\r\n  &quot;CGL policy may . . . provide coverage in cases where faulty workmanship\r\n  causes . . . damage to other property,&quot; the trial court determined the\r\n  homeowners' claims were covered by Harleysville's policies.[1]Â \r\n  We affirm the finding of coverage.\r\nThe finding of\r\n  coverage requires that we address a matter not reached in our initial and now\r\n  withdrawn opinion.Â  Harleysville appeals from the trial court's determination\r\n  that its liability to Crossmann is joint and several with Crossmann's other CGL\r\n  insurers.Â  We reverse the finding of joint and several liability and find the\r\n  scope of Harleysville's liability is limited to damages accrued during its\r\n  &quot;time on the risk.&quot;Â  In so ruling, we adhere to our holding in Joe Harden Builders, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp;\r\n    Surety Co., 326 S.C. 231, 486 S.E.2d\r\n  89 (1997), but overrule Century Indemnity Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc.,\r\n  348 S.C. 559, 561 S.E.2d 355 (2002).Â  Using our &quot;time on risk&quot;\r\n  framework, the allocation of the damage award against Crossmann must conform to the actual distribution of property damage across the\r\n  progressive damage period.Â  Where proof of the actual property damage\r\n  distribution is not available, the allocation formula adopted herein will serve\r\n  as an appropriate default method for dividing the loss among Crossmann's\r\n  insurers.Â  We remand to the trial court for further consideration of the &quot;time on risk&quot; allocation.\r\nI.\r\nCrossmann constructed multiple\r\n  condominium projects from 1992 through 1999, which are at issue in this case.Â \r\n  Crossmann utilized subcontractors to construct the condominium projects.Â  In\r\n  2001, the homeowners filed suit against Crossmann after they discovered\r\n  construction defects and resulting problems with the units.Â  The homeowners\r\n  alleged Crossmann defectively constructed the units, and as a result, the units\r\n  experienced substantial decay and deterioration.Â  Crossmann settled with the\r\n  homeowners for approximately $16.8 million.\r\nFollowing the settlement, Crossmann\r\n  sought coverage for damages arising out of the lawsuit pursuant to their CGL\r\n  policies issued by Harleysville, but Harleysville denied that coverage was\r\n  triggered.Â  Crossmann filed a declaratory judgment action to determine whether\r\n  the policies covered the homeowners' damages.Â  The parties stipulated to the\r\n  facts and amount of damages and only presented the coverage and allocation\r\n  questions to the trial court.\r\nThe parties' stipulations\r\n  presented the coverage question on the basis of the presence or absence of an &quot;occurrence.&quot;Â \r\n  The parties stipulated to, among other things, the amount of damages, that the\r\n  damage resulting from water intrusion constituted &quot;property damage,&quot; that\r\n  the damage began within thirty days after the certificate of occupancy was\r\n  issued for each building, that the damage progressed \r\n\r\nuntil repaired or until\r\n  Beazer Homes paid to settle the homeowners' claims, and that the parties would\r\n  not argue the applicability of any policy exclusions.\r\nRelying on L-J, Inc. v. Bituminous Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., 366 S.C. 117, 123 n.4, 621 S.E.2d 33, 36 n.4 (2005), and\r\n  the ambiguity in the language of the CGL policies, the trial court ruled\r\n  that the progressive damage &quot;that resulted from, and was in addition to,\r\n  the subcontractors' negligent work itself&quot; was caused by an &quot;occurrence.&quot;Â \r\n  The trial court issued its order prior to our recent decision in Auto Owners\r\n    Insurance Co. v. Newman (&quot;Newman&quot;), 385 S.C. 187, 684\r\n  S.E.2d 541 (2009).Â  However, as discussed below, Newman further supports\r\n  this result.Â  The trial court also ruled that Harleysville was jointly and\r\n  severally liable and was not entitled to a set-off based on other insurers'\r\n  pre-trial settlements with Crossmann.[2]Â  Additionally, the trial\r\n  court found that Crossmann was entitled to an award of post-judgment interest\r\n  but not prejudgment interest.Â  Both parties have appealed the trial court's\r\n  order.\r\nII.\r\n&quot;A\r\n  declaratory judgment action is neither legal nor equitable, and therefore, the\r\n  standard of review is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.&quot;Â  Newman, 385\r\n  S.C. at 191, 684 S.E.2d at 543. Â &quot;When the purpose of the underlying\r\n  dispute is to determine whether coverage exists under an insurance policy, the action\r\n  is one at law.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;In an action at law tried without a\r\n  jury, the appellate court will not disturb the trial court's findings of fact\r\n  unless there is no evidence to reasonably support them.&quot;Â  Id. Â In this case, the parties have stipulated to the facts, and thus we are\r\n  presented with a question of law.Â  Where the action presents a question of law,\r\n  as does this declaratory action, this Court's review is plenary and without\r\n  deference to the trial court.Â  J.K.\r\n    Constr., Inc. v. W. Carolina Reg'l Sewer Authority, 336 S.C. 162, 166, 519\r\n  S.E.2d 561, 563 (1999).\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nCommercial General\r\n  Liability Policies and the Coverage Question in a Progressive Damage Case\r\nA.\r\nWe affirm the trial court's finding of coverage based\r\n  on an &quot;occurrence.&quot;Â  An occurrence was once simply defined as an &quot;accident.&quot;Â \r\n  However, in 1966, the occurrence definition was expanded to include &quot;continuous\r\n  or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.&quot;[3]Â \r\n  This Court, among others, has struggled to discern the meaning of the expanded\r\n  occurrence definition in the context of progressive damage cases.Â  The lack of\r\n  a clear meaning, we believe, leaves us with an ambiguity, which we must\r\n  construe against the insurer. Â See Super Duper, Inc. v. Pennsylvania\r\n    Nat'l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., 385 S.C. 201, 210, 683 S.E.2d 792, 796 (2009) (&quot;Ambiguous\r\n  terms must be construed in favor of the insured.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  construe the ambiguous definition of occurrence in favor of the insured,\r\n  Crossmann, and find the insuring language of the policies was triggered by the\r\n  damages caused by repeated water intrusion.[4]\r\nB.\r\nWhile we adhere to the result\r\n  in Newman, because progressive damage cases often are highly complex and\r\n  involve many stakeholders, we elect to clarify the applicable legal framework\r\n  for determining whether coverage is triggered.\r\nIn Newman, a homeowner\r\n  brought a suit against a builder alleging breach of warranty, breach of\r\n  contract, and negligence.Â  The homeowner established that a subcontractor\r\n  negligently applied stucco to the side of her house and, as a result,\r\n  progressive damage ensued as water seeped into the home causing damage to the\r\n  home's framing and exterior sheathing.\r\nWe held that the costs of\r\n  replacing the defective application of the stucco were not covered by the\r\n  builder's CGL policy, but the damage caused by the continuous moisture\r\n  intrusion resulting from the subcontractor's negligence did fall within the CGL's\r\n  expansive definition of an occurrence.Â  We analyzed Newman solely\r\n  through the lens of whether there was an occurrence, specifically a &quot;continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same\r\n  harmful conditions.&quot;Â  385 S.C at 194, 684 S.E.2d at 544-45 (citing Travelers\r\n    Indem. Co. of America v. Moore &amp; Assocs., Inc., 216 S.W.3d 302, 309\r\n  (Tenn. 2007)).\r\nWe believe a more complete\r\n  understanding of the coverage issue in this kind of progressive property damage\r\n  case should involve the policy term &quot;property damage.&quot;Â  The standard\r\n  CGL policy defines &quot;property damage&quot; in two different ways, as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  a.Â  Physical injury to tangible property, including\r\n    all resulting loss of use of that property.Â  All such loss of use shall be\r\n    deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or\r\n  b.Â  Loss of use of tangible property that is not\r\n    physically injured.Â  All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time\r\n    of the &quot;occurrence&quot; that caused it.[5]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first\r\n  quoted definition of &quot;property damage,&quot; the critical phrase is &quot;physical\r\n  injury,&quot; which suggests the property was not defective at the outset, but\r\n  rather was initially proper and injured thereafter.Â  We emphasize the &quot;difference\r\n  between a claim for the costs of repairing or removing defective work, which is\r\n  not a claim for 'property damage,' and a claim for the costs of repairing\r\n  damage caused by the defective work, which is a claim for 'property damage.'&quot;Â  See United States Fire Ins. Co., 979 So. 2d at 889-90 (citing\r\n  cases adopting this approach); see also Wm. C. Vick Constr. Co. v. Pennsylvania\r\n    Nat'l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., 52 F. Supp. 2d 569, 582 (E.D.N.C. 1999) (&quot;[T]he property allegedly damaged has to have been\r\n  undamaged or uninjured at some previous point in time.&quot;), aff'd, 213\r\n  F.3d 634 (4th Cir. 2000) (unpublished table\r\n  decision); L-J, Inc. v. Bituminous Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co.,\r\n  366 S.C. 117, 124, 621 S.E.2d 33, 36 (2005) (&quot;In the present case, the\r\n  complaint did not allege property damage beyond the improper performance of the\r\n  task itself.&quot;); Travelers Indem. Co. of America, 216 S.W.3d at 311\r\n  (&quot;[W]e hold that claims alleging only damages for replacement of a\r\n  defective component or correction of faulty installation do not allege 'property damage.'&quot;).\r\nFurther, we note\r\n  it is only after &quot;property damage&quot; has been alleged that the question\r\n  of &quot;occurrence&quot; is reached.Â  With respect to the components of a\r\n  project that sustained physical injury, we look to the definition of\r\n  occurrence, which is ambiguous and must be construed in favor of the insured,\r\n  and find coverage was triggered.\r\nReturning to Newman and viewing those facts through the lens of both &quot;property damage&quot;\r\n  and &quot;occurrence,&quot; we clarify that the costs to replace the\r\n  negligently constructed stucco did not constitute &quot;property damage&quot;\r\n  under the terms of the policy.Â  The stucco was not &quot;injured.&quot;Â \r\n  However, the damage to the remainder of the project caused by water penetration\r\n  due to the negligently installed stucco did constitute &quot;property damage.&quot;Â \r\n  Based on those allegations of property damage and \r\n\r\nconstruing the\r\n  ambiguous occurrence definition in favor of the insured, the insuring language of the policy in Newman was triggered by the property damage caused by repeated water intrusion.[6]\r\nIn sum, we\r\n  clarify that negligent or defective construction resulting in damage to\r\n  otherwise non-defective components may constitute &quot;property damage,&quot;\r\n  but the defective construction would not.Â  We find the expanded definition of &quot;occurrence&quot;\r\n  is ambiguous and must be construed in favor of the insured, and the facts of\r\n  the instant case trigger the insuring language of Harleysville's policies.Â  We\r\n  note, however, that various exclusions may preclude coverage in some\r\n  instances.Â  Because the parties in the present case stipulated not to raise the\r\n  issue, we do not address any policy exclusions and exceptions.\r\nIV.\r\nHarleysville next challenges\r\n  the trial court's decision to impose &quot;joint and several&quot;[7] liability.Â  We adopt the &quot;time on risk&quot; framework, and therefore\r\n  overrule our decision in Century Indemnity Co. v. Golden Hills Builders,\r\n    Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 561 S.E.2d 355 (2002).Â  In our view, the &quot;time on\r\n  risk&quot; approach best conforms to the terms of a standard CGL policy and to the\r\n  parties' objectively reasonable expectations.Â  In particular, the &quot;time on\r\n  risk&quot; approach requires a policyholder to bear a pro rata portion of the\r\n  loss corresponding to any portion of the progressive damage period during which\r\n  the policyholder was not insured or purchased insufficient insurance.Â  The\r\n  parties entered the following stipulations relevant to this issue:\r\n\r\n  8.Â  The\r\n    parties agree that the following matters are the only issues of law to be\r\n    addressed by [the trial court]:\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  b.Â  In the event the Court finds that there\r\n  was an occurrence or occurrences, how shall the $7.2 million in insured damages\r\n  referred to in paragraph 1 above be allocated, whether by &quot;joint and\r\n  several&quot; or by &quot;time on the risk;&quot;\r\n\r\n  Â c.Â  In the event judgment is entered for\r\n    Plaintiffs, and that the Court determines that &quot;time on the risk&quot; is\r\n    the proper allocation method, what is the proper period over which the &quot;time\r\n    on the risk&quot; should be calculated.Â  All parties reserve their right to\r\n    argue, from the applicable facts and law, the appropriate start date and end\r\n    date for any pro rata time on the risk allocation period.Â  Alternatively, in\r\n    the event that judgment is entered for the Plaintiffs and the Court determines\r\n    that &quot;joint and several&quot; is the proper allocation method, whether\r\n    Harleysville or Cincinnati is entitled to any set-off under South Carolina law\r\n    in light of Plaintiffs' settlement with other insurers and, if set-off is\r\n    appropriate, the amount of any such set-off.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found the\r\n  allocation issue was controlled by Century Indemnity Co. v. Golden Hills\r\n    Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 561 S.E.2d 355 (2002).Â  The trial court determined\r\n  that Century Indemnity mandated a &quot;joint and several&quot; approach\r\n  and, therefore, ordered Harleysville to indemnify the full $7.2 million in stipulated\r\n  damages. Â We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\r\nAn analysis of the proper\r\n  method for allocating a loss among successive insurers must begin with the\r\n  threshold question of what must happen in order to trigger the potential for\r\n  coverage under a particular policy.Â  See Montrose Chemical Corp. of\r\n    California v. Admiral Ins. Co., 913 P.2d 878, 880 n.2 (Cal. 1995) (en banc)\r\n  (explaining that &quot;trigger of coverage&quot; is a description of &quot;what\r\n  must take place within the policy's effective dates&quot; in order for there to\r\n  be a potential of coverage (emphasis omitted)).Â  Only after determining how policies are triggered will it be possible to decide which policies were\r\n  triggered by a progressive injury[8] and, correspondingly, how much of the loss caused by the injury is\r\n  covered by each.Â  The threshold issue of the trigger of coverage was resolved\r\n  in South Carolina by the case of Joe Harden Builders, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty\r\n    &amp; Surety Co., 326 S.C. 231, 486 S.E.2d 89 (1997).\r\nFollowing Joe Harden,\r\n  we were confronted in Century Indemnity with a question regarding the\r\n  scope of a triggered insurer's obligation to its insured.Â  In Century\r\n    Indemnity, only one policy was at issue, and we were asked to determine\r\n  whether it would cover &quot;only the amount of property damage that occurred\r\n  during the policy period&quot; or &quot;all sums [the policyholder]\r\n  becomes legally obligated to pay[,] if property damage occurs during the policy\r\n  period.&quot;Â  348 S.C. at 564, 561 S.E.2d at 357 (emphasis in original).Â \r\n  These two alternatives are a classic statement of the difference between a &quot;time\r\n  on risk&quot; and a &quot;joint and several&quot; approach to allocating losses\r\n  in progressive property damage cases.Â  We determined that the policy must cover\r\n  &quot;damage that occurred during the policy period and . . . any\r\n  continuing damage.&quot;Â  Id., 561 S.E.2d at 358 (emphasis in original).Â \r\n  This result was consistent with the &quot;joint and several&quot; approach to\r\n  allocation because it made one policy responsible for the entire loss caused by\r\n  a progressive injury.\r\nThe question addressed in Century\r\n  Indemnity was one which has caused much consternation among the courts of\r\n  this country. Because Century Indemnity gave only a conclusory analysis\r\n  to this complex issue and because it relied on an incorrect interpretation of Joe\r\n    Harden in doing so, we overrule Century Indemnity and confront the\r\n  allocation issue anew.Â  After a detailed review of the policy language and the\r\n  relevant case law, we find that each triggered insurer must indemnify only for\r\n  the portion of the loss attributable to property damage that occurred during\r\n  its policy period.Â  Accordingly, we adopt a &quot;time on risk&quot; approach\r\n  to the allocation of damages caused by progressive injuries.\r\nA.Â  Harleysville's CGL Policies\r\nWe begin with the basic\r\n  principle that insurance policies are contracts to be interpreted in accord\r\n  with contract law.Â  Accordingly, our discussion begins with the language of the\r\n  policies themselves.Â  Harleysville's CGL policies provided, in relevant part,\r\n  that they would cover &quot;those sums that the insured becomes legally\r\n  obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to\r\n  which this insurance applies.&quot;Â  The insurance applied &quot;only if: (1)\r\n  The 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' [was] caused by an 'occurrence' . . .;\r\n  and (2) The 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' occur[red] during the policy\r\n  period.&quot;[9]\r\nThis policy language, or\r\n  language that is substantially the same, is typical of a standard CGL policy.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the interpretation of Harleysville's policies would be controlled\r\n  by Joe Harden and Century Indemnity.Â  See Century\r\n    Indemnity Co., 348 S.C. at 561, 561 S.E.2d at 356 (&quot;We accepted the\r\n  following question[] certified by the United States Fourth Circuit Court of\r\n  Appeals: 1. Does a standard commercial general liability insurance policy . . .\r\n  provide coverage for continuing damage that begins during the policy period?&quot;); Joe Harden Builders, Inc., 326 S.C. at 232, 486 S.E.2d at 89 (&quot;This\r\n  case is before us on certification from the United States District Court to\r\n  interpret the language of a standard occurrence insurance policy.&quot;).Â  We\r\n  turn now to an analysis of those cases.\r\n\r\nB.Â  Joe Harden\r\nIn Joe Harden, we were\r\n  asked to answer the following certified question: &quot;Where defective\r\n  construction causes progressive property damage that is otherwise covered by\r\n  insurance, is the property damage deemed to occur: 1. When the concrete frame\r\n  is constructed out of plumb; 2. When the masonry contractor knowingly builds\r\n  the defective brick wall; 3. When the failure of the brick wall is manifest; 4.\r\n  When the owner actually discovers the failure of the brick wall; or 5. At some\r\n  other time?&quot;Â  326 S.C. at 232-33, 486 S.E.2d at 89-90.Â  Clearly, this\r\n  question focused on what must happen in order to trigger coverage under a\r\n  particular policy.Â  We surveyed four common theories.\r\nFirst, we looked to the\r\n  theory that coverage is triggered at the time of the &quot;injury-causing\r\n  event.&quot;Â  We explained that, &quot;[u]nder this theory, coverage is\r\n  triggered at the time of the underlying injury-causing event, even though no\r\n  damage has yet occurred, and the policy in effect at the time of this\r\n  underlying event covers all the ensuing damage.&quot;Â  Id. at 234, 486\r\n  S.E.2d at 90.Â  The final phrase of this explanationâ€”&quot;covers all the\r\n  ensuing damage&quot;â€”is the logical result of the theory itself.Â  If coverage\r\n  results from the injury-causing event, and there is only one event,\r\n  responsibility for full coverage would rest with a single policy.Â  Coverage\r\n  responsibility could only be spread among multiple policies if the court\r\n  considered the &quot;underlying event&quot; to have been ongoing or repetitive,\r\n  such that it spanned multiple policy periods.\r\nThe next theory we considered\r\n  was that coverage is triggered &quot;when [the] injury manifested.&quot;Â  We\r\n  said, &quot;[u]nder this theory, damage is deemed to occur at the time it is\r\n  manifested or discovered, thus triggering coverage for all the ensuing damage\r\n  under the policy in effect at the time of manifestation, even if some damage\r\n  actually occurred earlier but was undetected.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Like the first\r\n  theory, the logical result here would be to place full responsibility on a\r\n  single policy, unless the manifestation of an injury could somehow be construed\r\n  as ongoing or repetitive.\r\nThe third theoryâ€”which we\r\n  ultimately adoptedâ€”was different from the first two.Â  We explained:\r\n\r\n  Under\r\n    this [third] theory, coverage may be triggered at any point from the time of\r\n    the underlying injury-causing event until the damage is complete, allowing\r\n      coverage under any policy in effect during this entire time.Â  Some courts\r\n    have adopted this theory to give effect to the language in the standard\r\n    occurrence policy which provides coverage for a &quot;continuous or repeated\r\n    exposure to conditions.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. at 235, 486 S.E.2d at 91 (emphasis added).Â  What\r\n  makes this theory unique versus the first two is that it is logically\r\n  consistent with indemnity under multiple policies: it &quot;allow[s] coverage\r\n  under any policy in effect during th[e] entire&quot; progression of the\r\n  damage.Â  Notably missing from our explanation, then, was the mention of any one\r\n  policy covering &quot;all ensuing damage.&quot;\r\nThough we adopted this\r\n  continuous trigger theory, thereby allowing coverage under multiple policies, we expressed disapproval regarding the aspect of the theory that\r\n  allowed coverage under policies that preceded the first actual\r\n  injury:\r\n\r\n  We find\r\n    this trigger gives effect to the policy provision regarding a continuous or\r\n    repeated exposure but that it suffers from the same problem as the first\r\n      theory discussed above because it triggers coverage from the time of\r\n    the injury-causing event even if no damage has yet occurred.Â  Again,\r\n    such an interpretation conflicts with the plain language of the policy which\r\n    provides that damage must occur during the policy period. Accordingly, we\r\n      adopt a continuous trigger theory but modify it as discussed below.\r\n\r\nId. at 236, 486 S.E.2d at 91 (emphasis added).Â  For that\r\n  reason, we adopted what we called a &quot;modified&quot; continuous trigger.Â \r\n  The modification was that, rather than defining the damage period as beginning\r\n  with the injury-causing event and ending with manifestation, we defined the damage\r\n  period as the term during which actual injuries occurred.\r\nBefore we made this\r\n  modification, however, we described the fourth general theory regarding the\r\n  trigger of coverageâ€”that coverage is triggered &quot;at the time of an\r\n  injury-in-fact&quot;â€”as follows: &quot;Under this theory, coverage is triggered\r\n  whenever the damage can be shown in fact to have first occurred, even if\r\n  it is before the damage became apparent, and the policy in effect at the time\r\n  of the injury-in-fact covers all the ensuing damages.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Like the first two theories we discussed and rejected, this theory is\r\n  logically consistent with indemnity only by a single policy:\r\n  an injury can only have &quot;first occurred&quot; on a single occasion.Â  See Montrose Chemical Corp., 913 P.2d at 895 n.17 (noting an insurer's\r\n  argument that &quot;once an injury-in-fact is established, even\r\n  retrospectively, all potential coverage is cut off . . . and only the insurer\r\n  on the risk at the time the injury-in-fact first 'occurs' is liable to\r\n  indemnify the insured&quot;).\r\nIn order to make an\r\n  injury-in-fact trigger consistent with coverage under multiple policies,\r\n  we had to recognize the ongoing or repetitive nature of the injuries in a\r\n  progressive damage case.Â  We did precisely that by (a) adopting the continuous\r\n  trigger theory (theory three), and (b) modifying it to require an\r\n  injury-in-fact during each policy period.Â  Thus, we stated:\r\n\r\n  Because\r\n    we find the injury-in-fact trigger consistent with the policy's requirement\r\n    that damage occur during the policy period, we adopt it in\r\n      conjunction with a continuous trigger of coverage.Â  See U.S.\r\n        Gypsum Co. v.

Co., 399 N.W.2d 156 (Minn. [Ct.] App.1987) (rejecting\r\n    argument that there can be only one occurrence in continuous injury case and\r\n    applying actual injury rule).\r\n\r\n326 S.C. at 236, 486 S.E.2d\r\n  at 91 (emphasis added).Â  The Industrial Steel Container Co. case we\r\n  cited in support explains that where a court considers there to have been\r\n  ongoing injuries-in-fact, there is the potential for coverage under more than\r\n  one policy.Â  399 N.W.2d at 159 (&quot;We view this 'actual injury' rule to be\r\n  sufficiently broad to recognize that in cases involving long exposure to a\r\n  toxic substance there can be damage with more than one manifestation and more\r\n  than one insurance policy can afford coverage.Â  We reject the argument that\r\n  there can be only one occurrence in a case where property damage results from\r\n  continuous or repeated conditions of exposure.&quot;).\r\nOur holding in Joe Harden was this: &quot;We hold coverage is triggered at the time of an injury-in-fact\r\n  and continuously thereafter to allow coverage under all policies in effect from\r\n  the time of injury-in-fact during the progressive damage.&quot;Â  326 S.C. at\r\n  236, 486 S.E.2d at 91.Â  This statement was a complete answer to the certified\r\n  question before the Court.Â  Unlike theories one, two, and fourâ€”which\r\n  contemplated that a single policy would cover &quot;all ensuing damage&quot;â€”theory\r\n  three included no statement as to the scope of coverage that would be provided\r\n  by each triggered policy.Â  Thus, the holding in Joe Harden did not\r\n  answer the allocation question with which we are now presented.\r\nYet the Joe Harden Court then went one step further, making a statement in dictum that has been\r\n  the source of much confusion.Â  We said: &quot;[T]his theory of coverage will\r\n  allow the allocation of risk among insurers when more than one insurance policy\r\n  is in effect during the progressive damage.&quot;Â  Id. at 237, 486\r\n  S.E.2d at 91.Â  This statement could be taken as a mere summation of the fact\r\n  that theory three allows coverage under multiple policies.Â  Nevertheless, it may\r\n  be mistakenly construed to mean that (1) risk can only be allocated\r\n  among insurers, and no portion of the risk can be borne by policyholders who\r\n  allow insurance to lapse during some portion of the damage period; and (2)\r\n  where there is only one insurance policy in effect during the progressive\r\n  damage, that policy must bear the full risk.Â  We attribute no such weighty meaning\r\n  to this dictum.\r\nWe turn now to Century\r\n  Indemnity, in which we were squarely presented with a question as to how\r\n    much coverage each triggered insurer must provide.\r\nC.Â  Century Indemnity\r\nIn Century Indemnity,\r\n  we accepted the following certified question:\r\n\r\n  Does a\r\n    standard commercial general liability insurance policy that explicitly provides\r\n    coverage only for property damage occurring during the policy period provide\r\n    coverage for continuing damage that begins during the policy period?\r\n\r\n348 S.C. at 561, 561 S.E.2d\r\n  at 356.Â  In Century Indemnity, the policyholder purchased coverage from\r\n  December 7, 1989, to December 7, 1990.Â  The parties stipulated that moisture began\r\n  to cause property damage prior to the end of the policy period, and that the\r\n  damage was &quot;continuous since that time.&quot;Â  Id. at 562, 561\r\n  S.E.2d at 356.Â  The CGL policy at issue was identical in all relevant respects\r\n  to the policies in this case.Â  Id. at 563, 561 S.E.2d at 357.Â  We\r\n  reasoned:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    issue is whether the policy should cover (1) only the amount of property damage\r\n    that occurred during the policy period, i.e., between December 7, 1989,\r\n    and December 7, 1990; or (2) all sums Insured becomes legally obligated\r\n    to pay if property damage occurs during the policy period.\r\n\r\nWe\r\n    believe this issue can be resolved solely by reference to Joe Harden\r\n      Builders, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 326 S.C. 231, 486 S.E.2d 89\r\n    (1997).Â  In Joe Harden, the Court adopted a modified continuous trigger\r\n    theory for determining when coverage is triggered under a standard occurrence\r\n    policy. &quot;Under this theory, coverage is triggered whenever the damage can\r\n    be shown in fact to have first occurred, even if it is before the damage became\r\n    apparent, and the policy in effect at the time of the injury-in-fact covers all\r\n    the ensuing damages.&quot; Id. at 236, 486 S.E.2d at 91.Â  Coverage is\r\n    also triggered under every policy applicable thereafter.\r\nBecause\r\n  the policy at issue here contains substantially the same language as the policy\r\n  at issue in Joe Harden, the modified continuous trigger theory applies\r\n  in the instant case. Â As a result, the insurance policy provides coverage for\r\n  property damage that occurred during the policy period and for any\r\n  continuing damage.\r\nId. at 564, 561 S.E.2d at 357-58 (emphasis in original).\r\nThis analysis fundamentally\r\n  misinterpreted Joe Harden and is profoundly at odds with the insurance\r\n  contract.Â  The Joe Harden language relied upon in Century Indemnity was taken from the description of theory four, treating theory four as if it\r\n  was the holding in Joe Harden.Â  The actual holding in Joe Harden,\r\n  adopting theory three and then modifying it using the injury-in-fact trigger\r\n  from theory four, was that &quot;coverage is triggered at the time of an\r\n  injury-in-fact and continuously thereafter to allow coverage under all policiesin effect from the time of injury-in-fact during the progressive\r\n  damage.&quot;Â  326 S.C. at 236, 486 S.E.2d at 91 (emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  fundamental difference is this: while the theory quoted in Century Indemnity would make a single policy responsible for full indemnity, the modified\r\n  continuous trigger theory adopted in Joe Harden makes multiple policies\r\n  responsible.\r\nThe error in Century\r\n  Indemnity is further evident in its statement that &quot;property damage relates\r\n    back in time to the time of the occurrence, that is, when the first injury\r\n  occurred to the property.&quot;Â  348 S.C. at 563, 561 S.E.2d at 357 (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Again, a &quot;first injury&quot; can only occur once.Â  Thus, Century\r\n    Indemnity would collapse all property damage into a single policy period.Â \r\n  This would leave no logical basis for finding that later policies were also\r\n  triggered.Â  Joe Harden, on the other hand, expressly contemplated that\r\n  property damage would span multiple policy periods, triggering coverage under\r\n  each policy.\r\nIn sum, the actual holding in Joe Harden gave no guidance as to how much coverage would be\r\n  provided by each triggered policy.Â  Because Century Indemnity relied on\r\n  a single trigger theory, rather than on the modified continuous trigger theory\r\n  adopted in Joe Harden, the Century Indemnity opinion gave short\r\n  shrift to this complex issue.Â  For this reason, we overrule Century\r\n    Indemnity and confront the issue anew.Â  We turn now to an analysis of the\r\n  two theories regarding the scope of coverage advocated by the parties in this\r\n  case.\r\nD. Â &quot;Joint and Several&quot; vs. Pro Rata/&quot;Time\r\n  on Risk&quot;\r\nIn this case, Crossmann\r\n  argues in favor of a &quot;joint and several&quot; approach to the allocation\r\n  of damages, while Harleysville advocates a pro rata/&quot;time on risk&quot;\r\n  approach.Â  We adopt the pro rata/&quot;time on risk&quot; approach.\r\nCourts adhering to the &quot;joint\r\n  and several&quot; theory require each triggered insurer to indemnify its\r\n  policyholder for the entire loss caused by the progressive injury, up to the\r\n  policy limit, even if the majority of the loss occurred after the policy period\r\n  expired.Â  A key feature of this approach is that a policyholder may be\r\n  indemnified in full despite its failure to purchase CGL coverage throughout the\r\n  entire progressive damage period.Â  Further, under this theory, where multiple\r\n  insurance policies are triggered, the policyholder often is permitted to choose\r\n  the policy from which it will seek indemnity.Â  The chosen insurer may then seek\r\n  partial reimbursement from any other insurers triggered by the progressive\r\n  injury.[10]Â  Because &quot;joint and\r\n  several&quot; jurisdictions typically allow a selected insurer to bring a\r\n  separate lawsuit seeking such reimbursement, many have criticized the theory as\r\n  inefficient and wasteful of judicial resources.Â  E.g., Boston Gas Co.,\r\n  910 N.E.2d at 311.\r\nThe seminal case advocating a\r\n  &quot;joint and several&quot; approach is Keene Corporation v. Insurance\r\n    Company of North America, 667 F.2d 1034 (D.C. Cir. 1981).Â  Keene rested primarily on the view that a policyholder's purchase of insurance\r\n  entitled it to certainty that it had limited its liability to the cost of the\r\n  policy itself.Â  Id. at 1047-48.Â  Advocates of a &quot;joint and several&quot;\r\n  approach typically contend that the plain language of the insuring agreement\r\n  requires an insurer to pay &quot;all sums&quot; or &quot;those sums&quot; the\r\n  insured becomes legally obligated to pay, as long as some property\r\n  damage occurs during the policy period.Â  See, e.g., Goodyear Tire\r\n    &amp; Rubber Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 769 N.E.2d 835, 841 (Ohio\r\n  2002).[11]Â \r\n  As we detail below, we believe this \r\n\r\ninterpretation ignores\r\n  critical language limiting the insurer's obligation to pay to sums that are attributable\r\n  to property damage that occurred during the policy period.\r\nIn contrast to the &quot;joint\r\n  and several&quot; approach, courts adhering to a &quot;pro rata&quot; theory of\r\n  the scope of each triggered insurer's obligation to its insured hold each\r\n  insurer responsible only for some pro rata portion of the loss caused by a progressive\r\n  injury, regardless of whether there are other triggered insurers available to\r\n  cover the remainder.Â  Thus, unlike jurisdictions using a &quot;joint and\r\n  several&quot; theory, courts subscribing to a pro rata theory generally require\r\n  the policyholder to bear the portion of the loss attributable to the\r\n  policyholder's assumption of the risk.Â  Boston Gas Co., 910 N.E.2d at\r\n  303 (&quot;One important feature of a pro rata allocation is that courts\r\n  adopting this type of allocation generally require the policyholder to\r\n  participate in the allocation . . . for those periods of no insurance,\r\n  self-insurance, or insufficient insurance.&quot; (alteration in original) (quoting\r\n  J.M. Seaman &amp; J.R. Schulze, Allocation of Losses in Complex Insurance\r\n    Coverage Claims Â§ 4:3[c], at 4-21 (2d ed. 2008))). Â As a result, for those\r\n  periods of &quot;no insurance, self-insurance, or insufficient insurance&quot;\r\n  during the progressive damage period, a portion of the loss will be borne by the\r\n  policyholder.\r\nPro rata theorists have\r\n  developed several different methods for calculating each insurer's pro rata\r\n  portion of the loss, each supported by its own notions of fairness and the\r\n  nature of CGL insurance.Â  &quot;Time on risk&quot; is one such method, and in\r\n  our opinion, is the method most consistent with the language of a standard CGL\r\n  policy.[12]\r\nOur approach relies heavily\r\n  on the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Boston Gas\r\n    Company v. Century Indemnity Company, which provides the reading of the\r\n  relevant policy language that we believe is correct:\r\n\r\n  Once the\r\n    policy is triggered . . . the insuring agreement provides that [the insurer]\r\n    will indemnify [the insured] only for the &quot;ultimate net loss&quot; that\r\n    [the insured] is &quot;legally obligated to pay [as damages] 'because of'\r\n    . . . 'property damage' . . . 'to which this policy applies.'&quot;Â \r\n    [The insurer] then looks to the &quot;Policy Period, Territory&quot; provision\r\n    as supplying a definition of the phrase &quot;to which this policy applies.&quot;\r\n    Â That provision states that &quot;[t]his policy applies to . . . property\r\n      damage . . . which occurs anywhere during the policy period.&quot;Â \r\n    [The insurer] concludes that the policy provides coverage only for [the insured's]\r\n    liability resulting from property damage occurring during the policy period.\r\n\r\n910 N.E.2d at 305 (emphasis\r\n  in original); id. at 306-07 (adopting this interpretation of the policy\r\n  language).Â  This interpretation is consistent with various other courts around\r\n  the country, including, among others, the Second and Sixth Circuit Courts of\r\n  Appeal and the courts of Minnesota, New York, and Vermont.Â  Id. at 307\r\n  n.34 (citing cases).\r\nWhile Boston Gas dealt\r\n  with an excess insurance policy, rather than a standard CGL policy, the key\r\n  language is the same.Â  As in Boston Gas, Harleysville agreed to pay for\r\n  damages incurred &quot;because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to\r\n    which this insurance applies.&quot;Â  The insurance applies &quot;only if . . . [t]he 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' occur[red] during the policy\r\n  period.&quot;Â  In other words, the insurance does not apply to property\r\n  damage that did not occur during the policy period.Â  Though the insurer in Boston\r\n    Gas agreed to pay the &quot;ultimate net loss&quot; above a certain\r\n  threshold amount while a standard CGL policy promises payment for &quot;those\r\n  sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages,&quot; both\r\n  phrases are modified by the requirement that covered damages must be &quot;because\r\n    of . . . 'property damage' to which th[e] insurance applies.&quot;Â  This\r\n  requirement limits the promise of payment, obligating the insurer to pay only\r\n  those damages caused by property damage that &quot;occurs during the policy\r\n  period.&quot;\r\nNot only does the Boston\r\n  Gas interpretation give effect to each part of the insuring agreement\r\n  (rather than focusing solely on the terms &quot;all sums&quot; or &quot;those\r\n  sums&quot;), it is consistent with the objectively reasonable expectations of\r\n  the contracting parties.Â  As the Boston Gas Court explained:\r\n\r\n  [W]e\r\n    doubt that an objectively reasonable insured reading the relevant policy\r\n    language would expect coverage for liability from property damage occurring\r\n    outside the policy period. . . . No reasonable policyholder could have expected\r\n    that a single one-year policy would cover all losses caused by [a progressive\r\n    injury] over the course of several decades.Â  Any reasonable insured purchasing\r\n    a series of occurrence-based policies would have understood that each policy\r\n    covered it only for property damage occurring during the policy year.\r\n  &quot;[T]here\r\n    is no logic to support the notion that one single insurance policy among 20 or\r\n    30 years worth of policies could be expected to be held liable for the entire\r\n    time period. Â Nor is it reasonable to expect that a single-year policy would be\r\n    liable, for example, if the insured carried no insurance at all for the other\r\n    years covered by the occurrence.&quot;\r\n\r\n910 N.E.2d at 309-10 (quoting Public Service Co. of Colorado v. Wallis &amp; Cos., 986 P.2d 924, 940\r\n  (Colo. 1999) (en banc)).\r\n\r\nFurther, this interpretation\r\n  forwards important policy goals.Â  Specifically, it preserves the incentive for\r\n  businesses to purchase sufficient insurance, which in turn promotes stability\r\n  in the marketplace.Â  See id. at 311 (&quot;[T]he pro rata\r\n  allocation method . . . engenders stability and predictability in the insurance\r\n  market, provides incentive for responsible commercial behavior, and produces an\r\n  equitable result.&quot;).Â  By contrast, the &quot;joint and several&quot;\r\n  theory &quot;creates a false equivalence between an insured who has purchased\r\n  insurance coverage continuously for many years and an insured who has purchased\r\n  only one year of insurance coverage.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Public Serv.\r\n    Co. of Colo., 986 P.2d at 939-940).\r\nFor these reasons, we reverse\r\n  the trial court's order allocating the entire $7.2 million in stipulated\r\n  damages to Harleysville and hold that the proper method for allocating damages\r\n  in a progressive property damage case is to assign each triggered insurer a pro\r\n  rata portion of the loss based on that insurer's time on the risk.[13]Â  We remand\r\n  for further proceedings consistent with a &quot;time on risk&quot; approach.Â \r\n  To aid the trial court in applying the &quot;time on risk&quot; framework, we\r\n  provide guidance in the section below.\r\nE.Â  Application of the &quot;Time on Risk&quot;\r\n  Approach\r\nAn ideal application of the &quot;time\r\n  on risk&quot; approach would require the finder of fact to determine precisely\r\n  how much of the injury-in-fact occurred during each policy period and precisely\r\n  what quantum of the damage award in the underlying suit was attributable to that injury.Â  Unfortunately, it is often &quot;both scientifically and\r\n  administratively impossible&quot; to make such determinations.Â  Boston Gas\r\n    Co., 910 N.E.2d at 301 (quoting Michael G. Doherty, Comment, Allocating\r\n      Progressive Injury Liability Among Successive Insurance Policies, 64 U.\r\n  Chi. L. Rev. 257, 257-58 (1997)).Â  This unique difficulty has been described as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  &quot;Most\r\n    liability policies are designed to respond to losses, such as automobile\r\n    accidents, which occur instantaneously.Â  Losses of this nature are relatively\r\n    easy to identify because damages are both immediate and finite, and can be\r\n    measured quite simply against the limits of the policy or policies in effect on\r\n    the date of the accident.\r\n  On the\r\n    other hand, losses where damage develops unrecognized over an extended period\r\n    of time, such as bodily injury claims for toxic exposures and property damage\r\n    claims for environmental contamination, are more difficult to pinpoint both in\r\n    time and in degree.Â  In these cases, correlating degrees of damage to\r\n    particular points along the loss timeline may be virtually impossible. This has\r\n    led to substantial uncertainty as to how responsibility for such losses should\r\n    be allocated where multiple insurers have issued successive policies to the\r\n    insured over the period of time the damage was developing.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. at 300 n.20 (quoting William R. Hickman &amp; Mary R.\r\n  DeYoung, Allocation of Environmental Cleanup Liability Between Successive\r\n    Insurers, 17 N. Ky. L. Rev. 291, 292 (1990)).\r\nIn cases where it is\r\n  impossible to know the exact measure of damages attributable to the injury that\r\n  triggered each policy, courts have looked to the total loss incurred as a\r\n  result of all of the property damage and then devised a formula to divide that\r\n  loss in a manner that reasonably approximates the loss attributable to each\r\n  policy period.Â  The basic formula consists of a numerator representing the\r\n  number of years an insurer provided coverage and a denominator representing the\r\n  total number of years during which the damage progressed.[14]Â  This fraction is\r\n  multiplied by the total amount the policyholder has become liable to pay as\r\n  damages for the entire progressive injury.Â  In this way, each triggered insurer\r\n  is responsible for a share of the total loss that is proportionate to its time\r\n  on the risk.[15]\r\nThis formula is not a perfect\r\n  estimate of the loss attributable to each insurer's time on the risk.Â  Rather,\r\n  it is a default rule that assumes the damage occurred in equal portions\r\n  during each year that it progressed.Â  If proof is available showing\r\n  that the damage progressed in some different way, then the allocation of losses\r\n  would need to conform to that proof.Â  However, absent such proof, assuming an\r\n  even progression is a logical default.\r\nIn this case, a strict\r\n  application of the basic &quot;time on risk&quot; formula might be\r\n  inappropriate.Â  There were numerous buildings involved in the underlying\r\n  lawsuit against Crossmann, each with its own certificate of occupancy, and the\r\n  parties have stipulated that the damage began &quot;within 30 days after the\r\n  Certificate of Occupancy was issued for each building.&quot;Â  Further, the\r\n  parties stipulated that the damage &quot;progressed until repaired or until\r\n  Beazer Homes paid to settle the underlying cases, whichever came first.&quot;Â \r\n  Accordingly, it may be that, as to each building, each policy was &quot;on the\r\n  risk&quot; for a slightly different proportion of the total damage period.Â  We\r\n  leave it to the sound discretion of the trial court to determine whether it is\r\n  necessary to apply the &quot;time on risk&quot; formula separately to each\r\n  individual building or whether, instead, it would be prudent to modify the\r\n  default formula to arrive at a reasonable methodology for this case.Â  Thus, we\r\n  emphasize that trial courts employing the &quot;time on risk&quot; approach may\r\n  alter the default formula set forth above where a strict application would be\r\n  unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the circumstances of a\r\n  particular case.Â  However, any such alterations must remain within the bounds of\r\n  a pro rata/&quot;time on risk&quot; approach: the formula must result in a reasonable\r\n  approximation of the amount of property damage that occurred during each\r\n  insurer's policy period.[16]\r\nIn sum, we construe the\r\n  standard CGL policy to require that each insurer cover only that portion of a\r\n  loss attributable to property damage that occurred during its policy period.Â \r\n  In light of the difficulty in proving the exact amount of damage incurred\r\n  during each policy period, we adopt the formula above as the default method for\r\n  allocating shares of the loss.Â  Trial courts may vary from this default formula\r\n  where appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case, but they must\r\n  remain faithful to the premise that each insurer is responsible only for a pro\r\n  rata portion of the total loss, and each pro rata portion must be defined by\r\n  the insurer's time on the risk.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial court's\r\n  finding that coverage was triggered by an &quot;occurrence.&quot;Â  We overrule Century\r\n    Indemnity and impose a &quot;time on risk&quot; approach to defining the\r\n  scope of each CGL insurer's obligation to its insured in a progressive damage\r\n  case.Â  This equitable approach best harmonizes with policy language limiting\r\n  coverage to the &quot;policy period.&quot;Â  Moreover, the &quot;time on risk&quot;\r\n  framework lends itself to a logical default formula that is easily applied when\r\n  the actual quantum of damage incurred during each policy period is not known.Â \r\n  We remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[17]\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Prior to the trial court's decision, Crossmann\r\n  consented to the dismissal of its claims against Defendant Associated Insurors,\r\n  Inc.\r\nDefendant Cincinnati\r\n  Insurance Company only issued excess insurance policies to Crossmann.Â  Because\r\n  the trial court found Harleysville's policies were sufficient to indemnify the\r\n  entire $7.2 million in stipulated damages, it did not rule on whether\r\n  Cincinnati's policies provided coverage, though it did find that the homeowners\r\n  in the underlying lawsuits suffered property damage during Cincinnati's policy\r\n  periods.\r\n[2] Prior to trial, Crossmann settled with their other\r\n  insurance companies for $8.6 million.\r\n[3] Although not necessary to the disposition of this\r\n  appeal, we note that languageÂ  included in the 1966 occurrence definition requiring\r\n  the property damage to be neither expected nor intended was eliminated from the\r\n  definition during the 1986 CGL revisions.Â  However, the unexpected and\r\n  unintended concept was retained in a policy exclusion.\r\n[4] We are aware that this construction may be at odds\r\n  with a more limited nature of coverage actually intended by policyholders and\r\n  the insurance industry.Â  However, if insurers intend to preclude this\r\n  construction, it is incumbent upon them to include clear language accomplishing\r\n  this result.Â  See United States Fire Ins. Co. v. J.S.U.B, Inc.,\r\n  979 So. 2d 871, 884 (Fla. 2007) (finding it is incumbent upon insurers to\r\n  include clear language expressing the parties' intent regarding the scope of coverage and noting the availability of\r\n  particular endorsements to address or clarify the parties' intent).\r\n[5] Harleysville's policies employed these standard\r\n  definitions, with the exception that some of its policies omitted the second\r\n  sentence from definition &quot;a.&quot;\r\n[6] In disposing of this appeal, we elect to adhere to\r\n  our precedent in Newman.Â  We do not address recent legislation that\r\n  seeks in part to impose a construction on existing insurance policies in\r\n  pending actions.Â  See Act No. 26, 2011 S.C. Acts.\r\n[7] The term &quot;joint and several&quot; is a\r\n  misnomer.Â  While each insurer is fully responsible for indemnifying its\r\n  policyholder, this result does not stem from any kind of shared duty to the\r\n  policyholder as the term might suggest in a tort setting.Â  Rather, the duties\r\n  of each insurer are contractual in nature, and are defined by the terms of each\r\n  policy.Â  Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indem. Co., 910 N.E.2d 290, 301 n.24\r\n  (Mass. 2009).\r\n[8] A progressive injury is an injury that results from\r\n  an event or set of conditions that occurs repeatedly or continuously over time,\r\n  such as long-term exposure to asbestos fibers or the continual intrusion of\r\n  water into a building.\r\n[9] Some of Harleysville's policies used slightly\r\n  different wording to define when the insurance applied, but the differences\r\n  were non-substantive.\r\n[10] In this way, an allocation among insurers based on each insurer's time on the risk can be consistent with a &quot;joint\r\n  and several&quot; approach.Â  In this context, &quot;time on risk&quot; is\r\n  simply an equitable method of spreading the loss among several insurers, each\r\n  of whom is liable to the insured for the loss in full.Â  See Sentinel Ins. Co. v. First Ins. Co. of Hawai'i, 875 P.2d 894, 919 (Haw.\r\n  1994) (&quot;Equity, under the circumstances of this case, dictates that the\r\n  court allocate contribution among the liable insurers in proportion to the time\r\n  periods their policies covered.&quot;).Â  As we will discuss, under the\r\n  &quot;time on the risk&quot; theory of the scope of each insurer's obligation\r\n  to its insured, each insurer's initial obligation to its insured is limited to\r\n  a pro rata portion of the loss.Â  The loss could not then be redistributed among\r\n  the insurers based on simple notions of equity.\r\n[11] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Goodyear Court explained its\r\n  position as follows:\r\n\r\n  There\r\n    is no language in the triggered policies that would serve to reduce an\r\n    insurer's liability if an injury occurs only in part during a given policy\r\n    period.Â  The policies covered [the insured] for &quot;all sums&quot; incurred\r\n    as damages for an injury to property occurring during the policy period.Â  The\r\n    plain language of this provision is inclusive of all damages resulting from a\r\n    qualifying occurrence.\r\n\r\n769\r\n  N.E.2d at 841.\r\n[12] Another common method is a &quot;years and\r\n  limits&quot; allocation, whereby shares are determined by each insurer's\r\n  proportion of the total available coverage.Â  This is accomplished by dividing\r\n  the sum of the insurer's policy limits by the sum of all policy limits\r\n  purchased during the damage period.Â  Thus, if insurer A issued two policies at\r\n  $1 million each and insurer B issued four policies at $4 million each, the\r\n  total available coverage would be $18 million, and insurer A would be\r\n  responsible for 2/18 of the loss while insurer B would be responsible for 16/18\r\n  of the loss.&nbsp; In this way, a court applying a &quot;years and limits&quot;\r\n  method attempts to allocate the loss in proportion to the amount of risk\r\n  assumed by the insurer over the course of the damage period.Â  See, e.g., Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Admiral Ins. Co., 712 A.2d 1116 (N.J. 1998)\r\n  (Part II); Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. United Ins. Co., 650 A.2d 974 (N.J.\r\n  1994) (Parts IV through VI).Â  The effect of a &quot;years and limits&quot;\r\n  allocation is to assign greater shares of the loss to insurers that offered\r\n  higher policy limits.Â  Because we believe the language of a standard CGL policy\r\n  requires each insurer to bear only that portion of the loss attributable to\r\n  damage that occurred during its policy period, we reject the &quot;years and\r\n  limits&quot; approach.\r\n[13] The parties have also raised the issue of whether\r\n  Harleysville is entitled to any set-off against the amounts already paid by\r\n  other insurers.Â  The parties have couched this as an alternative argument,\r\n  applicable only if the Court chooses to follow a &quot;joint and several&quot;\r\n  approach to allocation.Â  Given our disposition, we need not reach the set-off\r\n  issue.\r\n[14] By making the denominator the total number of years\r\n  during which the damage progressed, a policyholder who chose not to purchase\r\n  coverage for certain years will be left with the responsibility for whatever\r\n  portion of the total loss is attributed to those uninsured years.\r\n[15] Because this formula allocates the total loss caused\r\n  by a progressive injury in equal shares across all policy periods, there might\r\n  arise a situation in which the portion of the loss attributed to a particular\r\n  policy exceeds that policy's limit of coverage.Â  The portion of the loss that\r\n  exceeds the policy limit would either fall back onto the policyholder or be\r\n  covered by an excess insurance policy.Â  This result is equitable and in line\r\n  with the policyholder's objectively reasonable expectations: the policyholder\r\n  could only have expected each policy to indemnify up to its limit of coverage\r\n  and, as we have explained above, should have expected that each policy would\r\n  cover only the damage that occurred during its policy period.\r\n[16] Some courts have created an\r\n  &quot;unavailability&quot; exception to the &quot;time on risk&quot; rule and\r\n  therefore altered the default formula to exclude years during which coverage\r\n  was either not offered by the insurance industry or not offered to the particular\r\n  policyholder.Â  See Boston Gas Co., 910 N.E.2d at 315 &amp; n.41\r\n  (citing cases).Â  Alterations of this kind would exceed the trial court's\r\n  authority, as the effect is to shift losses from one policy period to another\r\n  in order to create coverage where none was purchased.Â  As observed in Boston\r\n    Gas, an unavailability exception &quot;effectively provides insurance where\r\n  insurers made the calculated decision not to assume risk and not to\r\n  accept premiums.&quot;Â  Id. at 315 (emphasis added).\r\n[17] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Crossmann has\r\n  cross-appealed from the denial of its request for prejudgment interest.Â  We\r\n  affirm the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest pursuant to Rule\r\n  220(b)(1), SCACR.Â  See Great Games, Inc. v. South Carolina Dep't of\r\n    Revenue, 339 S.C. 79, 85, 529 S.E.2d 6, 9 (2000) (stating that where the\r\n  trial court fails to address a nonprevailing party's argument, and the party\r\n  fails to bring the omission to the court's attention in a Rule 59, SCRCP,\r\n  motion, the argument is not preserved for review).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27028","title":"In the Matter of Craig Poff","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=27028","description":"This is an attorney discipline matter.","date":"2011-08-22","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Craig J.

Poff (Respondent) and the Office\r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) take exception to the findings and\r\n  recommendations of the hearing panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct\r\n  (Panel).Â  After a full hearing, two Panel members recommended a six month\r\n  suspension, and two Panel members recommended a ninety day suspension of\r\n  Respondent from the practice of law.Â  The Panel additionally recommended\r\n  Respondent be required to pay the costs of the proceedings, an appropriate\r\n  fine, and complete the South Carolina Bar's Legal Ethics Practice Program and\r\n  Trust Account School (LEAP program) prior to reinstatement to the practice of\r\n  law.Â  We order Respondent's suspension from the practice of law for a period of\r\n  six months, and additionally require Respondent to complete the LEAP program\r\n  and reimburse the ODC for the costs of the proceedings prior to reinstatement.Â \r\n  However, we decline to impose a fine.\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe ODC filed formal charges\r\n  against Respondent on January 21, 2010, alleging the violation of a variety of\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) arising out of his dealings with a former\r\n  assistant (Assistant).Â  The ODC alleged Respondent aided Assistant in\r\n  committing Medicaid Fraud, failed to specify and memorialize a fee agreement\r\n  with Assistant for representing her in a divorce proceeding, disclosed confidential\r\n  information about that divorce settlement with a third party, paid Assistant on\r\n  several occasions out of his trust account, and sent a series of e-mails to a\r\n  third party containing unauthorized photographs of Assistant and language\r\n  objectifying Assistant in a sexual manner during the time she was his client.Â \r\n  Respondent denied the majority of the allegations, but acknowledged he revealed\r\n  confidential information about Assistant's divorce settlement to a third party.Â \r\n  On May 11 and 12, 2010, the Panel heard testimony and arguments relating to the\r\n  formal charges.Â  The Panel issued its report on January 4, 2011 with the\r\n  recommendations listed above.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent is a sole\r\n  practitioner in Beaufort, South Carolina and has been a member of the South\r\n  Carolina Bar since 1990.Â  Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1979.Â \r\n  In 1993, Respondent opened his own practice, renting space from another\r\n  attorney.Â  While working out of this office, Respondent came to know Assistant,\r\n  who was then working as a legal assistant for the other attorney.Â  Respondent\r\n  moved offices in 1995 and did not have contact with Assistant until June 2005,\r\n  when Assistant made an appointment to meet with him to discuss obtaining a\r\n  divorce from her husband. \r\n\r\nThe Fee Agreement\r\nPrior to meeting with\r\n  Respondent, Assistant consulted two other attorneys about her divorce, but was\r\n  unable to pay the retainer fee they required.Â  At their initial meeting on June\r\n  4, 2005, Respondent quoted Assistant a retainer fee of $1,500, but she informed\r\n  him she could not pay that amount without an alternative arrangement.Â  Because\r\n  Assistant was not working during the month of June, Respondent suggested she\r\n  come to work for him on a part-time basis to pay off the retainer fee.Â  The\r\n  parties did not execute a written retainer agreement.Â  The terms of their\r\n  verbal agreement were uncertain.Â  Assistant believed she would be working the\r\n  entire summer, while Respondent testified the arrangement was for her to work\r\n  for two weeks to pay off the fee.Â  On June 23, 2005, after two weeks of work,\r\n  Respondent began paying Assistant a regular pay check.Â  Shortly thereafter, he\r\n  asked her to work for him permanently, and Assistant agreed.Â  Over the next two\r\n  years, Respondent represented Assistant in her divorce action and in alimony\r\n  and child support collection efforts without requesting payment for the\r\n  services.Â  \r\nRespondent's Trust Account and Payments to Assistant\r\nDuring Assistant's employment\r\n  with Respondent, he wrote checks to her directly from his trust account on four\r\n  occasions.Â  Respondent testified one of these checks was for child support,\r\n  given to him by Assistant's former mother-in-law.Â  Assistant denies the check\r\n  was for child support.Â  Respondent's trust account records indicate two checks\r\n  were for &quot;wages,&quot; and a third check was for a &quot;bonus.&quot;Â  In\r\n  his Response to Formal Charges, Respondent admitted to paying Assistant bonuses\r\n  directly from his trust account, but asserted there was no &quot;meaningful\r\n  difference between that needlessly convoluted process&quot; of disbursing money\r\n  first to his operating account before writing a bonus check to employees and\r\n  the shortcut he employed by paying Assistant directly from the trust account.\r\n  At the hearing, Respondent admitted this action was an improper\r\n  &quot;shortcut.&quot;Â  Respondent further admitted he most likely gave Assistant\r\n  these three checks as a share of fees from a personal injury settlement.Â \r\n  Respondent also paid Assistant periodic bonuses based on a percentage of\r\n  outstanding fees she collected or as a percentage of any retainer fees\r\n  Respondent collected when Assistant referred clients.Â  \r\nAssistant's Medicaid Benefits \r\nDuring their initial\r\n  consultation meeting on June 4, 2005, Assistant testified she told Respondent\r\n  her income with the local school district qualified her for Medicaid, and that\r\n  she needed to maintain that insurance for herself and her two children.Â \r\n  Respondent denies they discussed Medicaid at this meeting. Â Respondent did not\r\n  provide Assistant health insurance benefits because the premium quotations\r\n  Respondent received were too expensive.Â  Assistant testified Respondent knew it\r\n  was important for her to remain a part-time employee so she could qualify for\r\n  Medicaid benefits.Â  From June 7, 2005 until January 31, 2006, Respondent\r\n  reported Assistant's income using a 1099 form.[1]Â \r\n  In December, 2005, Assistant began working full-time for Respondent.Â  Assistant\r\n  testified she and Respondent discussed that her increased hours and pay could\r\n  jeopardize her ability to receive Medicaid benefits.Â  She claims Respondent\r\n  proposed the idea of splitting her income between an IRS 1099-Misc Form and a\r\n  W-2 form.[2]Â \r\n  According to Assistant, Respondent suggested that her assistance with his\r\n  bankruptcy practice could be reported as 1099 income and her secretarial work\r\n  could be reported as W-2 income.Â  She testified that during this discussion she\r\n  relayed her fear of going to jail if DHHS became aware of her actual income,\r\n  and he told her, at worst, she would have to pay the money back and that she\r\n  would get a letter stating she was disqualified from ever receiving Medicaid\r\n  again.Â Â Â  \r\nRespondent denies all of\r\n  Assistant's claims that he initiated and assisted her in defrauding DHHS to\r\n  receive Medicaid benefits. Respondent maintains he paid Assistant in this\r\n  fashion at her request and he naively assumed she preferred to split her\r\n  compensation this way for tax purposes.Â  The record indicates that Respondent\r\n  reported all of Assistant's income to the IRS, and paid all required taxes on\r\n  her wages.\r\nOn at least two occasions,\r\n  Assistant submitted letters understating her income to DHHS for the continued\r\n  receipt of Medicaid benefits.Â  These letters were written on Respondent's letterhead\r\n  and purportedly bore his signature, but Assistant admitted she signed\r\n  Respondent's name to resemble his signature on both letters.Â  Assistant\r\n  maintains Respondent authorized her to sign his name to the letters and\r\n  approved the letters before she sent them to DHHS.Â  Respondent, on the other\r\n  hand, alleges Assistant submitted these letters on her own accord, without his\r\n  knowledge, and he first learned of the letters from an Attorney General\r\n  investigator after Assistant left his employment.Â  \r\nThe first letter was dated\r\n  December 19, 2005, when Respondent was in Florida attending to matters related\r\n  to his father's death.Â  Assistant claims that on December 19th, she discussed\r\n  with Respondent by phone that her verification was expiring soon, and he told her\r\n  to draft the letter, sign it, and mail it because they did not have the time to\r\n  wait.Â  She testified she nevertheless held the letter until the next day when\r\n  he returned, and he again reiterated she should mail it as soon as possible so\r\n  her Medicaid benefits would not be interrupted.Â  She stated he even made a\r\n  comment about how close the signature looked to his.Â  Respondent denies all of\r\n  Assistant's testimony regarding this letter.\r\nAssistant printed these\r\n  letters on letterhead containing only Respondent's name, although the printed\r\n  letterhead used in the office during Assistant's employment was embossed with\r\n  her name, as legal assistant.Â  Assistant claims the office kept supplies of\r\n  both letterheads.Â  Respondent asserts Assistant altered the letterhead to\r\n  remove her name to prevent any perception she was a full-time employee.Â  \r\nOn July 30, 2007, two months\r\n  after Assistant left Respondent's employment, Respondent replied by letter to a\r\n  DHHS questionnaire, notifying the agency that Assistant may have underreported\r\n  her income to continue receiving Medicaid benefits.Â  Notably, in early May,\r\n  Respondent received notice that Assistant planned to file a malpractice suit\r\n  against him.Â  On August 27, 2007, Respondent made a complaint to the Office of\r\n  the Attorney General that Assistant engaged in Medicaid fraud.Â  On September\r\n  24, 2007, and again on October 9, 2007, Respondent sent letters to the Attorney\r\n  General's investigator detailing the amount he paid Assistant over the course\r\n  of her employment, and denying that he had any knowledge of the renewal letters\r\n  sent to DHHS.Â  Authorities arrested Assistant for Medicaid fraud and detained\r\n  her on October 19, 2007.Â  She acknowledged wrongdoing and entered an agreement\r\n  for pre-trial intervention.Â  \r\nDisclosure of Confidential Client Information\r\nRespondent admits to\r\n  violating Rule 1.6(a), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, by disclosing private details of\r\n  the circumstances surrounding Assistant's divorce action to his friend through e-mail.Â \r\n  These disclosures included intimate details about Assistant's marital relationship\r\n  and the financial settlement Respondent secured for her. \r\nDetails of Assistant's Departure from Employment\r\nAssistant worked for\r\n  Respondent from June 7, 2005 until May 4, 2007.Â  During this time, they shared\r\n  a good working relationship and Assistant considered them to be friends.Â \r\n  Assistant claims she was unaware that Respondent had feelings beyond friendship\r\n  until May 2, 2007, when Respondent gave her a romantic birthday card coupled\r\n  with a typed note that revealed his feelings for her.Â  \r\nOn May 4th, while looking in\r\n  Respondent's office for a client file, Assistant noticed an e-mail on\r\n  Respondent's computer of which she was the subject.Â  The e-mail referenced\r\n  Assistant in a sexually explicit manner. Assistant immediately printed the\r\n  e-mail and left the office with the intention of never returning.Â  \r\nAt home, Assistant used\r\n  Respondent's password to access his e-mail and printed the e-mails Respondent\r\n  exchanged with his friend during the time she worked for Respondent.Â  These\r\n  e-mails contained offensive and objectifying language about Assistant,\r\n  unauthorized photographs of Assistant, and confidential information about her\r\n  divorce settlement.Â  It is undisputed she accessed Respondent's e-mails for her\r\n  own purposes and not in furtherance of any duty she owed Respondent as an\r\n  employee.Â  \r\nOther Relevant Legal Proceedings\r\nAfter Assistant quit working\r\n  for Respondent, the South Carolina Employment Security Commission (SCESC)\r\n  awarded Assistant unemployment benefits upon finding she had been sexually\r\n  harassed at work.Â  Additionally, Assistant filed a legal malpractice suit\r\n  against Respondent and settled the suit for $300,000, $25,000 of which Respondent\r\n  paid personally.Â  Finally, during the pendency of this lawsuit, Assistant\r\n  executed a deed transferring her interest in her home to a third party.Â  This\r\n  deed included a handwritten notation, &quot;Prepared by Law Office of C.J.\r\n  Poff.&quot;Â  Respondent did not prepare the deed and testified the notation was\r\n  made in Assistant's handwriting.Â  Assistant denies making the notation.Â  The\r\n  deed was subsequently corrected.\r\nThe Panel's Findings\r\nThe Panel found Respondent in\r\n  violation of the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:\r\n\r\n  Â·&nbsp; Rule 1.6(a) (Confidentiality of\r\n    Information)\r\n  Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 1.15(a) (Safekeeping of\r\n    Property)\r\n  Â·&nbsp; Rule 5.4(a) (Professional\r\n    Independence of a Lawyer)\r\n  Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 8.4(a), (d), and (e) (Misconduct)\r\n\r\nThe Panel additionally found\r\n  Respondent in violation of the following Rules of Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement (RLDE), Rule 413, SCACR:\r\n\r\n  Â·&nbsp; Rule 7(a)(1) (violating or\r\n    attempting to violate the RPC)\r\n  Â·&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 7(a)(5) (conduct intending to\r\n    pollute administration of justice)\r\n  Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 7(a)(6) (violating lawyers'\r\n    oath of office)\r\n\r\nRespondent does not take\r\n  exception to the Panel's finding that he violated Rules 1.6(a) and 1.15, RPC.Â  However,\r\n  Respondent takes exception to the remaining Rule violations as found by the\r\n  Panel.\r\nThe Panel found that\r\n  Respondent did not violate the following Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:\r\n\r\n  Â·&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 1.2(d) (Scope of\r\n    Representation)\r\n  Â·&nbsp; Rule 1.5(b) (Fees)\r\n  Â·&nbsp; Rule 1.7(a)(2) (Conflict of\r\n    Interest: Current Clients)\r\n  Â·&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 1.8 (a) and (b) (Conflict of\r\n    Interest: Specific Rules)\r\n  Â·&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 1.16(a)(1) (Declining or\r\n    Terminating Representation)\r\n\r\nThe ODC does not take\r\n  exception to the Panel's finding that Respondent did not violate Rules 1.5(b)\r\n  and 1.8(b).Â  However, the ODC takes exception to the Panel's findings on the\r\n  remaining Rules listed.\r\nAggravating Factors\r\nThe Panel considered\r\n  Respondent's prior disciplinary history an aggravating factor in recommending a\r\n  sanction.Â  This Court suspended Respondent for a period of sixty days in\r\n  connection with his handling of a real estate closing.Â  In re Poff, 336\r\n  S.C. 542, 623 S.E.2d 642 (2005).Â  Additionally, the Panel determined Respondent\r\n  made false statements and engaged in deceptive practices during the\r\n  disciplinary process.Â  Finally, the Panel found Respondent failed to\r\n  acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct.\r\nMitigating Factors\r\nThe\r\n  Panel considered in mitigation of the charges the character testimony of Felix\r\n  &quot;Butch&quot; Clayton that Respondent is &quot;a hard worker and he has a\r\n  good reputation as an attorney throughout,&quot; and Respondent's personal\r\n  contribution of $25,000 toward a malpractice settlement with Assistant.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\nI.&nbsp;  Whether the Panel had\r\n  sufficient evidence to support its finding that Respondent knowingly aided Assistant\r\n  in misrepresenting her income, in violation of Rules 8.4(d) and (e), RPC, Rule\r\n  407, SCACR. \r\nII.&nbsp; Whether the Panel properly\r\n  considered aggravating circumstances.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Whether Respondent had\r\n  sufficient notice he was subject to discipline under Rule 5.4, RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Whether the Panel's finding\r\n  that Respondent violated Rules 7.4(a)(5) and (6), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR lacked\r\n  sufficient definiteness.\r\nV.&nbsp; Whether the Panel erred in\r\n  finding Respondent did not violate Rules 1.2(d), 1.7(a)(2), 1.8(b), and\r\n  1.16(a)(1), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nVI.&nbsp; Whether the Panel's\r\n  recommendation of a ninety day or six month suspension is a sufficient penalty\r\n  for Respondent's actions.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe sole authority to\r\n  discipline attorneys and decide appropriate sanctions after a thorough review\r\n  of the record rests with this Court.Â  In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10-11,\r\n  539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  In such matters, this Court may draw its own\r\n  conclusions and make its own findings of fact. Â Id.Â  Nonetheless, the\r\n  findings and conclusions of the Panel are entitled much respect and\r\n  consideration.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nRespondent has not\r\n  taken exception to the Panel's finding he violated the Rules relating to the\r\n  disclosure of confidential client information, Rule 1.6(a); the safekeeping of\r\n  a lawyer's trust account, Rule 1.15(a); and violating the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 8.4(a).Â  The Panel found Respondent's failure to reduce his fee\r\n  agreement with Assistant to writing did not violate Rule 1.5(b) because the Rule\r\n  does not require a fee agreement to be in writing.Â  The Panel also found the\r\n  ODC failed to establish Respondent violated Rule 1.8(a) by entering into a\r\n  business transaction with his client.Â  The ODC does not take exception to these\r\n  findings.Â  By not taking exception, the parties are deemed to have accepted the\r\n  Panel's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations as to these\r\n  Rules.Â  Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Therefore, as an initial matter, we\r\n  find Respondent violated Rules 1.6 (a), 1.15(a), and 8.4(a), RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR, but that he did not violate Rules 1.5(b) and 1.8(a), RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR, as charged.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rules 8.4(d) and (e), RLDE\r\n  (Misconduct)\r\nRespondent takes exception to the Panel's finding that\r\n  he violated Rules 8.4(d) and (e) by knowingly aiding Assistant in committing\r\n  Medicaid fraud.Â Â  In an attorney discipline action, the ODC is required to\r\n  establish by clear and convincing evidence a violation of the charged Rule.Â  Rule\r\n  8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In our opinion, the hearing testimony and admissible\r\n  exhibits, as a whole, establish that Respondent knowingly aided Assistant in misleading\r\n  DHHS as to Assistant's income.Â Â  \r\nThis issue presents a classic case of &quot;he said,\r\n  she said.&quot;Â  Assistant gave detailed testimony of the conversations she and\r\n  Respondent had regarding her need to maintain Medicaid coverage, his suggestion\r\n  that they split her income between a 1099 and W-2 form, and their exchanges\r\n  about the verification letters to be sent to DHHS.Â  Respondent denies ever\r\n  having these conversations and maintains Assistant asked him to split her\r\n  income and he naively complied.Â  The Panel found Assistant's testimony to be\r\n  more credible than Respondent's.Â  A reading of the record as a whole convinces\r\n  us of the same.Â  Although the Panel held inadmissible the e-mails and pictures\r\n  exchanged between Respondent and his friend, the ODC read them into evidence\r\n  for impeachment purposes.Â  The evasive and patently dishonest manner in which\r\n  Respondent answered questions about the documents, in our view, denigrates his\r\n  credibility in this factual determination.Â  For instance, the ODC asked\r\n  Respondent about pictures taken of Assistant in the office, a space only they\r\n  shared, and taken of her walking outside the office from the vantage point of\r\n  Respondent's office window. Â Respondent testified he did not recall taking any\r\n  of the pictures, although he knew of no one else who could have taken them.Â  The\r\n  ODC produced over seventy e-mails ostensibly exchanged between Respondent and\r\n  his friend.Â  Respondent testified he could not recall writing any of the\r\n  content of the e-mails.Â  Although it is conceivable that one might not\r\n  specifically recall writing every word of past correspondence, we believe it unlikely\r\n  that Respondent does not remember taking any of the pictures or writing any of the content included in approximately eighty exhibits.Â  Respondent's\r\n  testimony regarding the e-mails and pictures calls his credibility into\r\n  question.\r\nFurthermore, Respondent had a personal interest in\r\n  assuring Assistant maintained her Medicaid benefits because he wished to bring\r\n  her on full time, but he was either unwilling or unable to pay the costs of her\r\n  health insurance.Â  The record establishes their close relationship and\r\n  Respondent's desire to help Assistant in her personal matters.Â  Respondent's\r\n  interest in assuring Assistant maintained health coverage weighs in our factual\r\n  determination that Respondent aided Assistant in misrepresenting her income to\r\n  the government.\r\nAlthough Respondent testified he was unaware of the\r\n  specifics of Assistant's Medicaid coverage, we believe he was fully apprised of\r\n  her coverage, having represented her during her domestic case.Â  With knowledge\r\n  of her dependence on Medicaid, Respondent testified he believed Assistant\r\n  requested the split in income for legitimate tax planning purposes, and that it\r\n  suddenly &quot;dawned on him&quot; a month after Assistant left his employment,\r\n  and shortly after he was notified she planned to pursue a legal malpractice\r\n  suit against him.Â  \r\nIn its entirety, we find Assistant's rendering of the\r\n  facts regarding the representation of her income more credible than\r\n  Respondent's.Â  Therefore, we conclude Respondent violated Rules 8.4(d) and\r\n  8.4(e), RCP, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nII. Sufficient Notice of\r\n  Discipline \r\nRespondent argues he did not receive sufficient notice\r\n  he was subject to discipline under Rule 5.4(a), which prohibits a lawyer from\r\n  sharing fees with non-lawyers, because the ODC did not include this Rule in its\r\n  list of Rule violations in the Notice of Formal Charges, and the issue was not\r\n  raised at the hearing.Â  Formal charges must give the lawyer fair and adequate\r\n  notice of the nature of the alleged misconduct.Â  Rule 22, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.Â  We believe Respondent had adequate notice he could be sanctioned under\r\n  Rule 5.4(a).Â  The ODC's formal charges included the allegation that Respondent\r\n  committed misconduct by providing &quot;[Assistant] with periodic bonuses based\r\n  on a percentage of any outstanding fees collected or a percentage of the\r\n  retainer fee paid to Respondent from any referrals she brought into\r\n  Respondent's office.&quot;Â  (Notice of Formal Charges at 3.)Â  Respondent denied\r\n  that allegation in his reply, explaining the bonuses were discretionary and\r\n  given on an ad hoc basis, and stating the bonuses &quot;cannot be\r\n  reasonably categorized as any sort of 'fee-sharing' beyond the common sense\r\n  notion that general firm proceeds create funds for general employee\r\n  compensation.&quot;Â  (Resp. to Formal Charges at 6.)Â  The ODC's allegation of\r\n  fee sharing in its Notice of Formal Charges, and Respondent's subsequent denial\r\n  of that claim is enough to establish he had fair and adequate notice of\r\n  potential sanctions for violating this Rule. \r\nAs to the merits of this issue, the record includes\r\n  clear and convincing evidence Respondent violated the fee sharing prohibition\r\n  by sharing a portion of settlement and retainer fee proceeds with Assistant.Â \r\n  The only exception to the prohibition against fee sharing that might apply is\r\n  under subsection 4, which states, &quot;a lawyer . . . may include nonlawyer\r\n  employees in a compensation or retirement plan, even though the plan is based\r\n  in whole or in part on a profit-sharing arrangement.&quot; Rule 5.4(a)(4), RPC,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR.Â  Respondent stated in his Response to Formal Charges he converted\r\n  the fees to a &quot;one-time bonus,&quot; and that the bonuses were\r\n  &quot;arbitrary&quot; and &quot;discretionary.&quot;Â  This type of bonus does\r\n  not fall within the exception of Rule 5.4(a)(4), which allows fee sharing as\r\n  part of a compensation plan. Â Therefore, we find Respondent in violation of\r\n  Rule 5.4(a), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Aggravating Factors\r\nRespondent takes issue with two of the aggravating\r\n  factors considered by the Panel when determining appropriate sanctions:\r\n  Respondent's submission of false evidence, statements, or other deceptive\r\n  practices during the disciplinary process and his refusal to acknowledge the\r\n  wrongful nature of his conduct.Â  Respondent denies his involvement with the\r\n  Medicaid fraud, and argues the Panel's finding that he lied on the stand is a\r\n  direct incorporation of its finding he committed the fraud.Â  He additionally\r\n  argues the Panel improperly considered his evasive and indirect responses to\r\n  questioning about the e-mails and photographs because this evidence was\r\n  excluded.Â  The ODC read the e-mails into evidence and referenced the\r\n  photographs for impeachment purposes, so in our opinion, it was within the\r\n  Panel's purview to consider the veracity of Respondent's responses an\r\n  aggravating factor.Â  Regardless, this Court has the sole authority to decide an\r\n  appropriate sanction for Respondent, and considering only Respondent's\r\n  disciplinary history as an aggravating factor, a sanction of six months suspension\r\n  from the practice of law is merited for his misconduct.\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Definiteness of Findings\r\n  under Rules 7.4(a)(5) and (6), RLDE\r\nRespondent argues the Panel Report lacked sufficient\r\n  definiteness when finding Respondent in violation of Rules 7.4(a)(5) and (6),\r\n  and therefore Respondent had no basis upon which to take exception to those\r\n  findings.Â  Rule 7, RLDE, merely enumerates the grounds on which a lawyer may be\r\n  disciplined.Â  Rule 7.4(a)(5) provides a venue for discipline when a lawyer\r\n  engages in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or conduct\r\n  that brings disrepute to the legal profession. Â Respondent's assistance in deceiving\r\n  the government, engagement in fee sharing, mishandling of his trust account,\r\n  and improper disclosure of confidential client information to a third party\r\n  certainly brought disrepute to the legal profession.Â  Rule 7.4(a)(6) provides a\r\n  ground for discipline when a lawyer violates the oath of office.Â  Respondent's\r\n  actions caused him to violate his oath that he would &quot;respect and preserve\r\n  inviolate the confidences of my clients&quot; and would &quot;maintain the\r\n  dignity of the legal system.&quot;Â  Rule 402(k), SCACR.Â  We do not believe it was\r\n  necessary for the Panel to expound upon its reasoning for finding these grounds\r\n  for discipline, as they are commensurate with its finding that Respondent\r\n  committed numerous violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  Like the\r\n  Panel, we find Respondent in violation of Rule 7(a)(1), 7(a)(5), and 7(a)(6),\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nV.&nbsp; Exceptions taken by the ODC\r\n  to the Panel's findings\r\nA.&nbsp; Rule 1.2(d), RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR (Scope of Representation)\r\nThe ODC argues the Panel\r\n  erred in finding that Rule 1.2(d) was inapplicable to Respondent.Â  We agree.\r\nRule 1.2(d) states that a\r\n  lawyer may not counsel or otherwise assist a client in conduct the lawyer knows\r\n  is criminal or fraudulent.Â  The Panel found that the scope of Respondent's\r\n  representation of Assistant was limited to the domestic matter, and because she\r\n  was not his client for purposes of qualifying for Medicaid benefits, this Rule\r\n  did not apply.Â  We do not interpret Rule 1.2(d) as narrowly.Â  The Rule seeks to\r\n  prevent attorneys from perpetuating fraud or crime by leveraging the influence\r\n  and knowledge gained through an attorney-client relationship.Â  There is nothing\r\n  in the Rule limiting its application to criminal or fraudulent activity that\r\n  spawns from the underlying representation.Â  Given our belief that Respondent aided\r\n  Assistant in misrepresenting her income to DHHS during the time Assistant was\r\n  Respondent's client, we find him in violation of Rule 1.2(d), RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conflict of Interest and Terminating Representation\r\n  under Rules 1.7(a)(2) and 1.16(a)(1), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR\r\nThe ODC takes exception to the Panel's finding that\r\n  Respondent's romantic feelings toward Assistant did not create a conflict of\r\n  interest under Rule 1.7(a)(2).Â  In this case, a violation of Rule 1.7(a)(2)\r\n  necessarily invokes a violation Rule 1.16(a)(1), which provides that a lawyer should\r\n  discontinue representation of a client if continued representation will result\r\n  in a violation of the Rules.Â  The Panel found there was no evidence that\r\n  Respondent's personal feelings toward Assistant negatively affected his\r\n  representation of her in the domestic case.Â  We believe it is ill-advised to\r\n  represent, or to continue to represent, a client for whom the lawyer harbors\r\n  romantic feelings.Â  However, we agree with the Panel's finding that Respondent\r\n  did not violate these Rules.Â  Respondent's unrevealed romantic interest in\r\n  Assistant, in the absence of any evidence of its effect on his representation,\r\n  does not, in our view, represent a conflict that rises to the level of a Rule\r\n  violation.Â  Therefore, we accept the Panel's finding that Respondent did not\r\n  violate Rules 1.7(a)(2) and 1.16(a)(1).Â  \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conflict of Interest under Rule\r\n  1.8(b), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR\r\nThe ODC takes exception to the Panel's finding that\r\n  Respondent's action of reporting Assistant's Medicaid fraud to authorities did\r\n  not violate Rule 1.8(b), which prohibits a lawyer from using &quot;information relating\r\n    to representation of a client to the disadvantage of the client . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  Rule 1.8(b), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR (emphasis supplied).Â  We believe this\r\n  Rule speaks for itself.Â  Although Respondent's report to the authorities may be\r\n  considered retaliatory, in our opinion, this Rule is not applicable to\r\n  Respondent's conduct because Assistant's receipt of Medicaid benefits was not\r\n  related to Respondent's representation of her in the domestic matter.Â \r\n  Therefore, we find that Respondent did not violate Rule 1.8(b), RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR, as charged.\r\nVI.&nbsp; The Panel's Recommendation\r\nThe ODC takes exception to the Panel's recommendation\r\n  that Respondent should receive a definite suspension of only ninety days or six\r\n  months.Â  The ODC urges this Court to impose, at a minimum, a nine month\r\n  suspension so that, prior to his reinstatement, Respondent must appear before\r\n  the Committee on Character and Fitness.Â  We believe Respondent's conduct,\r\n  aggravated by prior disciplinary history, warrants a six month suspension from\r\n  the practice of law.\r\nRespondent admitted to sharing with his friend\r\n  confidential information about Assistant's domestic matter.Â  This included\r\n  intimate information about Assistant's finances, as well as her physical\r\n  relationship with her husband.Â  We believe the nature of Respondent's disclosure\r\n  to be the most offensive type.Â  Additionally, Respondent engaged in the\r\n  practice of fee sharing, aggravated by paying those shared fees to Assistant\r\n  directly out of his trust account.Â  This trust account mishandling, if\r\n  unchecked, could put other clients' money at risk.Â  Finally, we believe\r\n  Respondent knew of Assistant's \r\n\r\nplan to underrepresent her income to DHHS, and aided\r\n  her in doing so by splitting her income between W-2 and 1099 forms.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we believe Respondent's egregious conduct warrants a six month suspension. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we find Respondent improperly disclosed\r\n  confidential client information to a third party, mishandled his trust account,\r\n  engaged in fee sharing with a non-lawyer, and aided Assistant in\r\n  misrepresenting her income to the government.Â  For these offenses, we find\r\n  Respondent violated Rules 1.2(d), 1.6(a), 1.15(a), 5.4(a), 8.4(d), and 8.4(e),\r\n  RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, and Rules 7(a)(1), 7(a)(5), and 7(a)(6), RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.Â  Considering this misconduct, and Respondent's prior disciplinary\r\n  history, we order Respondent's suspension from the practice of law for a period\r\n  of six months.Â  We accept the Panel's additional recommendations that\r\n  Respondent be required to pay the costs of these proceedings and complete the\r\n  LEAP program prior to reinstatement into the practice of law.Â  However, we\r\n  decline to impose a fine.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The IRS's 1099 Miscellaneous form is used to report\r\n  the income of non-employees, typically independent contractors.Â  Income\r\n  distributed on a 1099 basis is not subject to federal or state income tax\r\n  withholding.\r\n[2] Because the Department of Health and Human\r\n  Services (DHHS) only reviews an applicant's W-2 income, splitting her income in\r\n  this fashion would allow Assistant to maintain her Medicaid benefits.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27029","title":"Clea v.

Silvernail, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES: Â Appellant\r\n  filed suit to recover for personal injuries sustained by her son (Trevon) after\r\n  he was bitten by respondent Essix Shannon's dog.[1] Â The circuit court granted summary\r\n  judgment in favor of respondent. Â We affirm in part and reverse in part,\r\n  finding there is a material question of fact whether the landlord is liable\r\n  under the theories of strict liability and common law negligence.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent owned\r\n  an apartment complex consisting of two buildings.Â  Shannon, one of respondent's\r\n  tenants, owned a dog that he kept chained to a tree in a common area near the\r\n  back of the complex.Â  At the time of the incident, Shannon had kept the dog\r\n  chained to the tree for nearly ten years.Â  Shannon never kept the dog inside of\r\n  his apartment.Â  According to Shannon, respondent would occasionally &quot;come over\r\n  there and sit down and . . . give [the dog] a little - a handful [of food], sit\r\n  and play with him.&quot;Â  Respondent never otherwise cared for the dog.Â  \r\nOn the day of the\r\n  incident, appellant had taken her three children to visit her sister, who lived\r\n  at the apartment complex.Â  Appellant's aunt also lived in the apartment complex\r\n  in the building opposite appellant's sister's residence.Â  At some point during\r\n  the day, appellant agreed to take her aunt to the store and began walking with\r\n  her three children to the aunt's building.Â  As she walked, appellant was\r\n  carrying her baby and talking on a cordless phone.Â  As they approached the\r\n  aunt's apartment, two-year-old Trevon saw the dog and ran over to it.Â  The dog\r\n  ran to the end of its chain and began attacking Trevon. Â Neither Shannon nor\r\n  respondent were present at the complex at the time of the incident.Â  Trevon\r\n  suffered numerous injuries, for which his medical bills totaled approximately\r\n  $17,000.\r\nAfter the incident, appellant\r\n  discovered the dog had previously attacked a six-year-old-boy.Â  Appellant's sister told her respondent had threatened to require\r\n  Shannon get rid of the dog after the previous attack, but never did so.\r\nAppellant\r\n  instituted this action, arguing respondent was liable for Trevon's injuries\r\n  under three theories: (1) strict liability under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-3-110\r\n  (1987); (2) common law negligence; and (3) attractive nuisance.Â  The circuit\r\n  court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent as to all causes of\r\n  action.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I. Did the circuit court\r\n    err in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent as to appellant's\r\n    strict liability claim?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp; Did the circuit court\r\n    err in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent as to appellant's\r\n    common law negligence claim?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp; Did the circuit court\r\n    err in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent as to appellant's\r\n    attractive nuisance claim?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing an order\r\n  granting summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard as the\r\n  trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.Â  Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of material fact\r\n  exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may\r\n  be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party.Â  Fleming, 350 S.C. at 493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860.\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;Strict Liability\r\nAppellant first\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of\r\n  respondent as to appellant's strict liability claim.Â  We agree.\r\nOur state's\r\n  &quot;dog bite&quot; statute imposes strict liability against the owner of the\r\n  dog or any other person having the dog in its care or keeping:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Whenever any person is bitten or otherwise\r\n    attacked by a dog while the person is in a public place or is lawfully in a\r\n    private place, including the property of the owner of the dog or other person\r\n    having the dog in his care or keeping, the owner of the dog or other person\r\n      having the dog in his care or keeping is liable for the damages suffered by\r\n    the person bitten or otherwise attacked.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-3-110 (1987) (emphasis supplied).\r\n&quot;The\r\n  Legislature's use of the phrase 'care or keeping' clearly requires that the\r\n  'other person' act in a manner which manifests an acceptance of responsibility\r\n  for the care or keeping of the dog.&quot;Â  Harris v. Anderson County\r\n    Sheriff's Office, 381 S.C. 357, 364, 673 S.E.2d 423, 427 (2009).Â  &quot;To\r\n  this degree, the Legislature retained the common law principle of duty in\r\n  determining the liability of the 'other person.'&quot;Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  presence or absence of a duty determines liability in situations that involve a\r\n  statutory claim against a person having the dog in his care or keeping. Â Id. at 365, 673 S.E.2d at 427.Â  There are three scenarios under Â§ 47-3-110 when the\r\n  attack is unprovoked and the injured party is lawfully on the premises:\r\n\r\n  First, the dog owner is strictly liable and common law principles\r\n    are not implicated.Â  Second, a property owner is liable when he exercises\r\n    control over, and assumes responsibility for, the care and keeping of the dog.Â \r\n    Third, a property owner is not liable under the statute when he has no control\r\n    of the premises and provides no care or keeping of the dog.\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  365-66, 673 S.E.2d at 427.\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  granted summary judgment in favor of respondent as to appellant's claim for strict\r\n  liability, finding respondent was neither the dog's owner, nor was the dog in\r\n  respondent's care or keeping.Â  \r\nWe find the\r\n  circuit court erred in granted summary judgment in favor of respondent as to\r\n  the strict liability claim.Â  Because respondent was not the dog's owner, in\r\n  order to be liable as a property owner, respondent would have to have exercised\r\n  control over the premises and assumed some duty to care for or keep the dog\r\n  before liability could attach.Â  Harris, supra.Â  It is clear\r\n  respondent exercised exclusive control over the common area where the dog was\r\n  kept.Â  Moreover, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellant,\r\n  we find there was a genuine issue of material fact whether respondent assumed\r\n  responsibility for the keeping of the dog.Â  Fleming, supra.Â  Respondent\r\n  knew the dog was chained to the tree in the common area over which he had\r\n  control.Â  Because the dog was continuously kept in this area, we find there was\r\n  a genuine issue of material fact whether respondent had the dog in his keeping\r\n  and reverse the circuit court's grant of summary judgment as to appellant's\r\n  strict liability claim.Â  Cf. Nesbitt v. Lewis, 335 S.C. 441, 517\r\n  S.E.2d 11 (Ct. App. 1999) (partial owner of the residence at which a minor\r\n  child was attacked by dogs who had not lived at the residence for over five\r\n  years and did not care for the dogs did not owe a duty to the injured child\r\n  because she lacked possession over the house and the dogs).\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Common law\r\nnegligence\r\nAppellant also argues\r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent on\r\n  appellant's claims of common law negligence.Â  Specifically, appellant argues\r\n  the circuit court erred in dismissing her complaint on the basis that a\r\n  landlord is not liable for injuries caused by a tenant's dog kept on leased\r\n  property.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder the common\r\n  law of our state, a landlord is not liable to a tenant's invitee for injuries\r\n  inflicted by an animal kept by a tenant on leased property.Â  See Gilbert\r\n    v. Miller, 356 S.C. 25, 586 S.E.2d 861 (Ct. App. 2003) (circuit court\r\n  granted summary judgment on negligence claim, finding landlord was not liable\r\n  where one tenant's dog attacked another tenant); see also Bruce\r\n    v. Durney, 341 S.C. 563, 534 S.E.2d 720 (Ct. App. 2000) (landlord was not\r\n  liable where a dog kept on tenant's leased property bit a child).\r\nIn Fair v.\r\n  United States of America, 334 S.C. 321, 513 S.E.2d 616 (1999), the Court\r\n  discussed whether the Residential Landlord Tenant Act (RLTA) altered the common\r\n  law rule that a landlord is not liable to a tenant's invitee for an injury\r\n  caused by a tenant's dog.Â  The Court held that under the &quot;fit and\r\n  habitable&quot;[2] provision of the RLTA, a landlord is liable only for defects relating to the\r\n  inherent physical state of the leased premises.Â  Fair, 334 S.C. at\r\n  323-24, 513 S.E.2d at 617.Â  The Court therefore held the RLTA does not alter\r\n  the common law rule.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe RLTA further\r\n  provides that a landlord shall &quot;keep all common areas of the premises in a\r\n  reasonably safe condition . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-440(a)(3)\r\n  (2007).\r\nWhether a\r\n  landlord can be liable for injuries inflicted upon an invitee or licensee where\r\n  the attack occurs in the common area of an apartment complex, i.e.\r\n  whether Â§ 27-40-440(a)(3) alters the common law rule, is a novel issue in this\r\n  state.Â  We therefore turn to other jurisdictions for guidance on this issue.\r\nIn Lidster v.\r\n  Jones, 176 Ga.App. 392, 336 S.E.2d 287 (Ga. App.1985), the Georgia Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment as to the appellant's negligence\r\n  action, holding a landlord could be liable where a tenant's dog bit a child.Â \r\n  The appellant alleged the landlord had actual knowledge of the dog's vicious\r\n  propensities because he knew the dog had previously attacked another child, and\r\n  that the landlord did nothing to keep the dog out of the complex's common area.\r\n  The court held that summary judgment was improper because a landlord who\r\n  retains control over the common areas of a complex to which tenants and others\r\n  were allowed access had a duty under a statute similar to the RLTA[3] to keep the common areas safe.Â  Further, the court distinguished that case from\r\n  another case in which the court determined a landlord was not liable because he\r\n  did not own or maintain the dog that bit the victim, noting that the case did\r\n  not involve a landlord's obligation to keep the common areas of the leased\r\n  premises safe.\r\nIn Gentle v.\r\n  Pine Valley Apartments, 631 So.2d 928 (Ala. 1994), the Alabama Supreme\r\n  Court held the presence of a tenant's vicious dog in a common area constituted\r\n  a dangerous condition and that a landlord must exercise reasonable care to\r\n  prevent injuries from such a dangerous condition, but only to the extent he was\r\n  aware of its existence. \r\nHere, the circuit\r\n  court found respondent could have no liability for common law negligence\r\n  because a landlord is not liable for injuries caused by an animal kept by a\r\n  tenant on leased property.Â  The court further found the fact that the dog was\r\n  kept in a common area did not affect respondent's liability since &quot;leased\r\n  property&quot; includes common areas.\r\nWe find the\r\n  circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent as to\r\n  appellant's common law negligence claims.Â  While it is true that a landlord is\r\n  typically not liable to someone attacked by a tenant's dog while that person is\r\n  on the leased property, this case is distinguishable from other cases in our\r\n  jurisdiction because those cases did not involve attacks occurring in common\r\n  areas.Â  We find this case is consonant with those cases from other\r\n  jurisdictions where the landlord could be liable where the attack occurred in a\r\n  common area.Â  There was evidence respondent had actual knowledge of the dog's\r\n  vicious propensity as it had previously attacked \r\n\r\na child, and\r\n  respondent failed to remedy the situation.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding respondent could not be liable for the attack under a\r\n  common law negligence theory.\r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attractive nuisance\r\n\r\nAppellant finally\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of\r\n  respondent as to appellant's attractive nuisance claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe attractive nuisance\r\n  doctrine provides that where the owner or occupier of land brings or\r\n  artificially creates something which, from its nature, is especially attractive\r\n  to children, he is bound to take reasonable pains to see that the dangerous\r\n  thing is so guarded that children will not be injured in coming into contact\r\n  with it.Â  Henson ex rel. Hunt v. International Paper Co., 374 S.C. 375,\r\n  381, 650 S.E.2d 74, 77 (2007).\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the presence of\r\n  the dog in the common area constituted an attractive nuisance.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the circuit court found the presence of the dog was not an &quot;artificial\r\n  condition&quot; on the land. \r\nWhether a dog can be\r\n  considered an &quot;artificial condition&quot; for the purposes of determining\r\n  a property landowner's liability under the attractive nuisance theory is a\r\n  novel issue in this state.Â  We are persuaded by the jurisprudence of several\r\n  other states that have determined dogs and other domesticated animals cannot be\r\n  considered an artificial condition.Â  See Hartsock v. Bandhauer, 158\r\n  Ariz. 591, 764 P.2d 352 (Ariz. App. 1988) (dogs are not considered an\r\n  &quot;artificial condition&quot; as required for liability under the attractive\r\n  nuisance doctrine); see also Aponte v. Castor, 155 Ohio\r\n  App.3d 553, 802 N.E.2d 171 (Ohio App. 2003) (finding no authority in Ohio law\r\n  that establishes a horse is an artificial condition); Gonzalez v. Wilkinson,\r\n  68 Wis.2d 154, 227 N.W.2d 907 (Wis. 1975) (a dog cannot qualify as an\r\n  attractive nuisance because &quot;[a]lthough such a condition need not be\r\n  permanently erected upon the land, it must be 'artificially construed.'&quot;).\r\nWe hold the\r\n  circuit court properly found a dog cannot be considered an &quot;artificial\r\n  condition&quot; under an attractive nuisance theory. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the\r\n  circuit court erred in granting summary judgment as to appellant's strict\r\n  liability and common law negligence claims.Â  We find the circuit court properly\r\n  granted summary judgment as to appellant's attractive nuisance claim.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Appellant settled the case with respect to respondent Shannon.Â  Shannon's\r\n  co-defendant, Edward Carter, died after the action was instituted.Â  Although\r\n  the personal representative of Carter's estate is technically the respondent\r\n  here, for simplicity, we refer to Carter himself as &quot;respondent.&quot; \r\n[2] S.C.

(Eagle I), from Eagle I's bankruptcy\r\n  estate.[1]Â \r\n  In 2000, homeowners constructed a residence using defective windows\r\n  manufactured by Eagle I.Â  In 2006, homeowners settled their construction claims\r\n  against the appellant contractor.\r\nThe contractor\r\n  and its insurer (appellants) then brought this contribution[2] suit against\r\n  respondent as successor to Eagle I.Â  The circuit court granted respondent's\r\n  motion to dismiss, holding (1) dismissal was required under Rule 12(b)(6)\r\n  because the bankruptcy order expressly precluded any state law successor liability\r\n  actions since the sale was &quot;free and clear&quot; under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 363(f)\r\n  of the Bankruptcy Code; [3] and (2) that dismissal was proper under Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, because the\r\n  bankruptcy court in Ohio which issued the Eagle I order retained jurisdiction\r\n  over any claims against respondent for successor liability\r\nI.&nbsp; Free and Clear Sale\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  held that, because the Ohio bankruptcy order allowed the sale of Eagle I's\r\n  assets free and clear under Â§ 363(f), this suit should be dismissed.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe Eagle I bankruptcy order's &quot;free and clear&quot;\r\n  provisions are:\r\n\r\n  I.Â  The\r\n    sale, conveyance and assignment of the Assets under the Final Agreement, except\r\n    as otherwise specified in the Final Agreement, are free and clear of all liens,\r\n    claims, encumbrances, and interests, including without limitation, mortgages,\r\n    deeds of trust, security interests, conditional sale or title retention\r\n    agreements, pledges, liens, judgments, demands, encumbrances, easements,\r\n    restrictions, constructive or resulting trusts, or charges of any kind,\r\n    including but not limited to any restriction on the use, voting, transfer,\r\n    receipt of income, or other exercise of any attribute of ownership and all\r\n    debts arising in any way in connection with any acts of the Debtors, claims (as\r\n    that term is defined in Bankruptcy Code Â§ 101(5)), obligations, demands,\r\n    guarantees, options, rights, contractual commitments, claims related to the\r\n    design, manufacture, sale or distribution of products sold by the Debtors or\r\n    their predecessors, and claims related to pollution or other adverse effects on\r\n    human health or the environment, including but not limited to the release in\r\n    connection with any of the Debtors' (or their predecessors') operations or any\r\n    of the Assets or a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, or other\r\n    substance regulated under any local, state, or federal law, ordinance, or\r\n    regulation, and claims related to the Debtors' (or their predecessors') failure\r\n    to comply with any such law, statute, regulation, or ordinance restrictions,\r\n    interests in matters of any kind or nature, arising before closing of the sale\r\n    of the Assets (the &quot;Effective Time,&quot; as further defined in the\r\n    Final Agreement), and whether imposed by an agreement, understanding, law,\r\n    equity, or otherwise (collectively, &quot;Interestsâ€), with all such\r\n    Interests released, terminated, and discharged as to the Assets and EWD\r\n    Acquisition and to attach and be satisfied from the proceeds for the sale of\r\n    the Assets authorized by this Order.\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n  K.Â  EWD\r\n    Acquisition [respondent's predecessor] is only a purchaser of the Assets and is\r\n    not a successor in interest to Eagle or any other Debtor, nor does EWD\r\n    Acquisition's purchase of the Assets reflect a substantial continuity of the\r\n    operations of the Debtors' businesses.Â  Accordingly, except as otherwise\r\n    specifically and expressly provided in the Final Agreement, transfer of the\r\n    Assets to EWD Acquisition and assumption and assignment to EWD Acquisition of\r\n    the Assigned Contracts, will not subject EWD Acquisition to any liability\r\n    whatsoever with respect to the operation of Eagle's business before the\r\n    Effective Time based, entirely or partly, directly or indirectly, on any theory\r\n    of law or equity including without limitation any theory of antitrust or\r\n    successor or transferee liability.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  in original).\r\nParagraph I of the Eagle I bankruptcy\r\n  order first discharged respondent from all claims &quot;arising before the sale\r\n  of the Assets&quot; directing that any such claims &quot;attach&quot; to the\r\n  sales proceeds.Â  This paragraph refers to an action in rem against the\r\n  proceeds paid to the debtor, while a post-sale tort action against the\r\n  successor entity is not an action against the sale proceeds received by the\r\n  debtor, but rather an in personam action against the successor itself.Â  See In re Grumman Olson Indus. Inc., 445 B.R. 243 (Bkrtcy. S.D.N.Y. 2011).Â \r\n  Nothing in Paragraph I bars this suit.\r\nIn Grumman, the\r\n  bankruptcy court explained that under a Â§ 363(f) &quot;free and clear&quot;\r\n  sale, the purchaser of a bankrupt's assets need not fear that a creditor of the\r\n  bankruptcy estate can enforce its claim against those assets because the effect\r\n  of the free and clear sale is to limit that creditor to in rem relief\r\n  against the sale proceeds.Â  Whether a party is limited to proceeding in rem against\r\n  these proceeds, or is one whose claim lies against the purchaser, is determined\r\n  first by 11 U.S.C. Â§ 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.Â  If the creditor does not\r\n  have a Â§ 101(5) claim, then his right to proceed against the purchaser is\r\n  determined by state law.Â  \r\nThe test to determine\r\n  the type of claim a party has is:\r\n\r\n  [A]n\r\n    individual has a Â§ 101(5) claim [which is limited by the free and clear sale to in rem against the sale proceeds held by the Debtor] against a debtor\r\n    manufacturer if (i) events occurring before confirmation create a relationship,\r\n    such as contact, exposure, impact, or privity, between the claimant and the\r\n    debtor's product; and (ii) the basis for liability is the debtor's prepetition\r\n    conduct in designing, manufacturing and selling the allegedly defective or\r\n    dangerous product.Â  The debtor's prepetition conduct gives rise to a claim to\r\n    be administered in a [bankruptcy] case only if there is a relationship\r\n    established before confirmation between an identifiable claimant or group of\r\n    claimants and that prepetition conduct.\r\n\r\nEpstein v. Official\r\n  Committee of Unsecured Creditors (In re Piper Aircraft Corp.), 58 F.3d 1573 (11th Cir. 1995).Â  (Piper).\r\nHere, appellants, standing in\r\n  the shoes of the homeowners, are not barred by Â§ 101(5).Â  Specifically, the\r\n  homeowners dealt with the contractor, not the window manufacturer, and there\r\n  was no preexisting relationship between the manufacturer and the homeowner\r\n  giving rise to a claim within the meaning of the asset sale order.Â  Piper, supra; see also Kuney, Misinterpreting Bankruptcy Code Section\r\n    363(f) and Undermining the Chapter 11 Process, 76 Am. Bankr. L.J. 235\r\n  (Spring 2002).Â  Compare e.g. In re Leckie Smokeless Coal Co.,\r\n  99 F.3d. 573 (4th Cir. 1996) (existing creditors of bankrupt company\r\n  with Â§ 101(5) status unsuccessfully contested Â§ 363 &quot;free and clear&quot;\r\n  sale).Â  Paragraph I does not bar this suit.\r\nThe Eagle I bankruptcy order\r\n  provides in Paragraph K that respondent &quot;is only a purchaser of the Assets\r\n  and is not a successor in interest&quot; and thus is not subject &quot;to any\r\n  liability whatsoever with respect to the operation of [Eagle I's] business . .\r\n  . based . . . on any theory of law or equity including . . . successor . . .liability.&quot;Â \r\n  While this sentence facially appears to support the circuit court's decision,\r\n  it does not.Â  Having established that they are not Â§ 101(5) claimants, whether\r\n  appellants will be able to hold respondent liable under a successor liability\r\n  theory is a question of state law. Â See Simmons v. Mark Lift Indust.,\r\n    Inc., 366 S.C. 308, 622 S.E.2d 213 (2005). \r\nSimmons decided three certified questions:\r\n\r\n  1)Â  May\r\n    a South Carolina plaintiff pursue a products liability action under a successor\r\n    liability theory against a defendant which purchased the predecessor's assets\r\n    out of a bankruptcy sale?\r\n  2)Â \r\n    What is the test for determining successor liability of a company which\r\n    purchased the assets of an unrelated company?\r\n  3)Â  May\r\n    the South Carolina plaintiff maintain such a suit where there are one or more\r\n    other viable defendants?\r\n\r\nThe Simmons majority\r\n  answered question 2 first, holding that the test for successor liability is\r\n  that found in Brown v. American Ry. Express Co., 128 S.C. 428, 123 S.E.\r\n  97 (1924).Â  Simmons held that if the plaintiff could establish successor\r\n  liability under one of the Brown tests, then it could maintain a suit\r\n  against the successor corporation.\r\nBrown establishes four tests for determining whether a\r\n  successor corporation may be liable for the debts of its predecessor:\r\n\r\n  (1)Â \r\n    there was an agreement to assume these debts; or\r\n  (2)Â \r\n    the circumstances surrounding the transaction support a finding of\r\n    consolidation or merger of the two corporations; or\r\n  (3)Â \r\n    the successor is a mere continuation of the predecessor; or\r\n  (4)Â \r\n    the transaction was fraudulent, that is, to wrongfully defeat the predecessor's\r\n    creditors' claims.\r\n\r\nHere, Paragraph K provides\r\n  only that respondent is not liable under a successor liability theory for the\r\n  conduct of Eagle I, but does not absolve respondent of liability for its own\r\n  conduct.Â  See Grumman, supra.Â  If appellants can establish\r\n  that respondent's conduct meets one or more of the Brown tests, then\r\n  respondent may be liable to them.Â  Simmons, supra.\r\nWe reverse the finding that\r\n  the Ohio bankruptcy order's &quot;free and clear&quot; sale of Eagle I's assets\r\n  deprived the appellants of the ability to bring this state court action.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reservation of Jurisdiction\r\nThe circuit court also\r\n  dismissed this action, finding that the Ohio bankruptcy order had expressly\r\n  retained jurisdiction over all successor liability claims related to Eagle I in\r\n  this paragraph:\r\n\r\n  22.Â \r\n    The Court retains jurisdiction to enforce and implement the terms and\r\n    provisions of the Final Agreement, all amendments to it, any waivers and\r\n    consents under it, and of each of the agreements executed in connection with it\r\n    in all respects, including but not limited to retaining jurisdiction to resolve\r\n    any disputes arising under or related to the Final Agreement (except as\r\n    provided otherwise in the Final Agreement) and interpret, implement, and\r\n    enforce the provisions of this Order.\r\n\r\nAppellants' claim does not\r\n  arise under either the Agreement or the order, nor does their claim arise under\r\n  Â§ 101(5) or relate to Eagle I.Â  Rather, it is predicated upon respondent's\r\n  post-sale conduct which, appellants contend, exposes it to successor liability\r\n  under South Carolina state law.Â  See Simmons, supra.Â  The\r\n  circuit court erred in dismissing this suit under Paragraph 22.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order dismissing\r\n  appellants' claim under Rule 12(b) is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The chain through which respondent came to own Eagle I is irrelevant to the\r\n  issues raised on appeal.\r\n[2] See Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, S.C.

Sammataro, of Turner, Padget, Graham &amp; Laney, of Columbia, and O. Shayne\r\n          Williams, of Turner, Padget, Graham &amp; Laney of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        Marion\r\n          Clyde Fairey, Jr., of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  This is a direct appeal in a workers' compensation\r\n  case from a master's order reversing the Full Commission and finding respondent's\r\n  decedent[1] is totally disabled as the result of an occupational disease.Â  On appeal,\r\n  appellant (Employer) contends this matter should have been dismissed because\r\n  respondent's admittedly untimely appeal to the Commission deprived the\r\n  Commission of jurisdiction.Â  We agree that the untimely appeal to the\r\n  Commission requires that we vacate both the master's order and the decision of\r\n  the Full Commission.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did\r\n    respondent's failure to file a Form 30 with the Commission within fourteen days\r\n    of receiving notice of the single commissioner's order deprive that body of\r\n    appellate jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-17-50 (Supp. 2010) provides for an appeal to the Commission from the\r\n  decision of a single commissioner if the &quot;application for review is made\r\n  to the Commission within fourteen days from the date when notice of the award\r\n  shall have been given. . . .&quot;Â  25A S.C. Reg. 67-701 (Supp. 2010) provides\r\n  that such review shall be done by a Form 30, and that &quot;the fourteen day\r\n  period is jurisdictional.&quot;Â  Reg. 67-701 A.Â  Here, respondent did not file\r\n  his Form 30 within fourteen days of receiving notice of the single\r\n  commissioner's order, and Employer moved before the Commission to dismiss the\r\n  appeal arguing the Commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The\r\n  Commission denied the motion, emphasizing the appeal was only two days late and\r\n  that it resulted from respondent's attorney's error.Â  The Commission upheld the\r\n  single commissioner's denial of benefits. \r\nÂ Employer took no immediate\r\n  appeal from the interlocutory order denying its motion to dismiss, but raised\r\n  the denial in respondent's appeal to the circuit court.Â  The master determined\r\n  that by Employer's failure to take an immediate appeal, the ruling that the\r\n  Commission had &quot;subject matter&quot; jurisdiction over respondent's appeal\r\n  was rendered the law of the case.Â  This was error.\r\nEmployer argues, and we\r\n  agree, that it could not immediately appeal the order denying the motion to\r\n  dismiss.Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-60 (1990), an appeal from the\r\n  Commission may be taken to circuit court &quot;under the same terms and\r\n  conditions as govern appeals in ordinary civil actions.&quot;Â  This statutory\r\n  language has been interpreted to allow an immediate appeal from an\r\n  interlocutory order of the Commission only where the order &quot;affects the\r\n  merits.&quot;Â  Chastain v. Spartan Mills, 228 S.C. 61, 88 S.E.2d 836\r\n  (1955); see also King v. Singer Co. Power Tool Div., 276 S.C.\r\n  419, 279 S.E.2d 367 (1981); Brunson v. Am. Koyo Bearings, 367 S.C. 161,\r\n  623 S.E.2d 870 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  A circuit court order denying a motion to\r\n  dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not directly appealable\r\n  because, among other things, it does not affect the merits.Â  Woodward v.\r\n    Westvaco Corp., 319 S.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995) overruled in part on\r\n      other grounds Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 231 (2002).Â  The master erred in holding that the Commission's denial of\r\n  Employer's motion to dismiss was immediately appealable.\r\nThe master also held that the\r\n  Commission had &quot;subject matter&quot; jurisdiction to hear respondent's\r\n  appeal despite the untimeliness of the Form 30.Â  We now clarify that this issue\r\n  is properly couched as one of appellate jurisdiction rather than subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  See Great Games, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Rev., 339\r\n  S.C. 79, 529 S.E.2d 6 (2000).Â  A court's subject matter jurisdiction is\r\n  determined by whether it has the authority to hear the type of case in\r\n  question.Â  E.g., Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 442\r\n  S.E.2d 598 (1994).Â  This same principle applies to administrative agencies.Â  The\r\n  Commission has the authority to review decisions of a single commissioner, and\r\n  under the Gold Kist standard, there is no subject matter jurisdiction issue\r\n  here.Â  We now clarify that the question of compliance with rules, regulations,\r\n  and statutes governing an appeal is one of appellate jurisdiction, see In\r\n    re November 8, 2008 Bluffton County Election, 385 S.C. 632, 686 S.E.2d 685\r\n  (2009), and overrule prior decisions to the extent they pose the question of an\r\n  executive agency's authority to hear an appeal as one of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  E.g., Bursey v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl.\r\n    Control, 369 S.C. 176, 631 S.E.2d 899 (2006); S.C. Dep't of Corrections\r\n      v. Tomlin, 387 S.C. 652, 694 S.E.2d 25 (Ct. App. 2010); Hamilton v. Bob\r\n        Bennett Ford, 336 S.C. 72, 518 S.E.2d 599 (Ct. App. 1999) modified on\r\n          other grounds 339 S.C. 68, 528 S.E.2d 667 (2000).\r\nOn the merits, we hold that\r\n  the Commission lacks the authority to extend the fourteen days permitted for\r\n  the filing of an appeal from the decision of a single commissioner.Â  See Goodman v. City of Columbia, 318 S.C. 488, 458 S.E.2d 531 (1995)\r\n  (construing a pro se letter sent within fourteen days as satisfying the notice\r\n  requirements of Â§ 42-17-50 and Reg. 67-701).Â  This holding is consistent with\r\n  the general rule that an appellate body may not extend the time to appeal.Â  E.g.,\r\n  Rule 263(b), SCACR; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(1) (Supp. 2010); S.C.\r\n    Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, 380\r\n  S.C. 349, 669 S.E.2d 849 (Ct. App. 2008) overruled on other grounds 390\r\n  S.C. 418, 702 S.E.2d 246 (2010); Sadisco of Greenville, Inc. v. Greenville\r\n    County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 340 S.C. 57, 530 S.E.2d 383 (2000).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nSince the Full Commission\r\n  lacked jurisdiction to hear respondent's appeal, the decision of that\r\n  Commission as well as the master's order are \r\nVACATED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent's decedent (Benjamin Allison) died in 2008 and his estate has been\r\n  substituted.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Charles E.

A communication violates this rule if it:\r\n(a) contains a material misrepresentation of fact or  law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not  materially misleading;\r\n(b) is likely to create an unjustified expectation  about results the lawyer can achieve, or states or implies that the lawyer can  achieve results by means that violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or  other law; \r\n(c) compares the lawyer&rsquo;s services with other lawyers&rsquo;  services, unless the comparison can be factually substantiated;\r\n(d) contains a testimonial about, or endorsement  of, the lawyer \r\n\r\n  (1) without identifying the  fact that it is a testimonial or endorsement; \r\n  (2) for which payment has  been made, without disclosing that fact; \r\n  (3) which is not made by an  actual client, without identifying that fact; \r\n  and \r\n  (4) which does not clearly  and conspicuously state that any result the endorsed lawyer or law firm may  achieve on behalf of one client in one matter does not necessarily indicate  similar results can be obtained for other clients.\r\n\r\n  (e) contains a nickname, moniker, or trade name that  implies an ability to obtain results in a matter.\r\n Comment\r\n  [1]  This Rule governs all communications about a lawyer's services, including  advertising permitted by Rule 7.2. Whatever means are used to make known a  lawyer's services, statements about them must be truthful. The prohibition  in paragraph (b) of statements that may create &ldquo;unjustified expectations&rdquo; and  the prohibition in paragraph (d) of testimonials would ordinarily preclude  advertisements about results obtained on behalf of a client, such as the amount  of a damage award or the lawyer's record in obtaining favorable verdicts, and  advertisements containing client endorsements. Such information may create the  unjustified expectation that similar results can be obtained for others without  reference to the specific factual and legal circumstances.\r\n[2]  Truthful statements that are misleading are also prohibited by this Rule. A  truthful statement is misleading if it omits a fact necessary to make the  lawyer's communication considered as a whole not materially misleading. A  truthful statement is also misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that  it will lead a reasonable person to formulate a specific conclusion about the  lawyer or the lawyer's services for which there is no reasonable factual  foundation.\r\n[3] An  advertisement that truthfully reports a lawyer's achievements on behalf of  clients or former clients may be misleading if presented so as to lead a  reasonable person to form an unjustified expectation that the same results  could be obtained for other clients in similar matters without reference to the  specific factual and legal circumstances of each client's case. Similarly, an  unsubstantiated comparison of the lawyer's services or fees with the services  or fees of other lawyers may be misleading if presented with such specificity  as would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the comparison can be  substantiated. The inclusion of an appropriate disclaimer or qualifying  language may preclude a finding that a statement is likely to create  unjustified expectations or otherwise mislead a prospective client.\r\nFor  instance, the prohibition in paragraph (b) on statements likely to create  &ldquo;unjustified expectations&rdquo; may preclude, and the limitations in paragraph (d)  on testimonials and endorsements does preclude, advertisements about results  obtained on behalf of a client, such as the amount of a damage award or the  lawyer's record in obtaining favorable verdicts, unless they state clearly and  conspicuously that any result the lawyer or law firm may have achieved on  behalf of clients in other matters does not necessarily indicate similar  results can be obtained for other clients. Such information may create the  unjustified expectation that similar results can be obtained for others without  reference to the specific factual and legal circumstances.\r\n[4]  Paragraph (e) precludes the use of nicknames, such as the &ldquo;Heavy Hitter&rdquo; or  &ldquo;The Strong Arm,&rdquo; that suggest the lawyer or law firm has an ability to obtain  favorable results for a client in any matter. A significant possibility exists  that such nicknames will be used to mislead the public as to the results that  can be obtained or create an unsubstantiated comparison with the services  provided by other lawyers. See also Rule 8.4(f)(prohibition against  stating or implying an ability to influence improperly a government agency or  official or to achieve results by means that violate the Rules of Professional  Conduct or other law).\r\n\r\nRULE 7.2: ADVERTISING\r\n(a)  Subject to the requirements of this Rule and Rules 7.1 and 7.3, a lawyer may  advertise services through written, recorded or electronic communication,  including public media.&nbsp; All  advertisements shall be predominately informational such that, in both quantity  and quality, the communication of factual information rationally related to the  need for and selection of a lawyer predominates and the communication includes  only a minimal amount of content designed to attract attention to and create  interest in the communication.&nbsp; \r\n  (b) A  lawyer is responsible for the content of any advertisement or solicitation  placed or disseminated by the lawyer and has a duty to review the advertisement  or solicitation prior to its dissemination to reasonably ensure its compliance  with the Rules of Professional Conduct. The lawyer shall keep a copy or  recording of every advertisement or communication for two (2) years after its  last dissemination along with a record of when and where it was disseminated.\r\n(c) A  lawyer shall not give anything of value to a person for recommending the  lawyer's services except that a lawyer may\r\n(1) pay  the reasonable costs of advertisements or communications permitted by this  Rule;\r\n(2) pay  the usual charges of a legal service plan or a not-for-profit lawyer referral  service, which is itself not acting in violation of any Rule of Professional  Conduct; and\r\n(3) pay  for a law practice in accordance with Rule 1.17.\r\n(d) Any  communication made pursuant to this Rule shall include the name and office  address of at least one lawyer responsible for its content.\r\n(e) No  lawyer shall, directly or indirectly, pay all or a part of the cost of an  advertisement by a lawyer not in the same firm unless the advertisement  discloses the name and address of the nonadvertising lawyer, the relationship  between the advertising lawyer and the nonadvertising lawyer, and whether the  advertising lawyer may refer any case received through the advertisement to the  nonadvertising lawyer.\r\n(f)  A lawyer shall not make statements in advertisements or written communications  which are merely self laudatory or which describe or characterize the quality  of the lawyer&rsquo;s services; provided that this provision shall not apply to  information furnished to a prospective client at that person&rsquo;s request or to  information supplied to existing clients.\r\n(gf)  Every advertisement that contains information about the lawyer's fee shall  disclose whether the client will be liable for any expenses in addition to the  fee and, if the fee will be a percentage of the recovery, whether the  percentage will be computed before deducting the expenses.\r\n(hg)  A lawyer who advertises a specific fee or range of fees for a particular  service shall honor the advertised fee or fee range for at least ninety (90)  days following dissemination of the advertisement, unless the advertisement  specifies a shorter period; provided that a fee advertised in a publication  which is issued not more than annually, shall be honored for one (1) year  following publication.\r\n(ih)  All advertisements shall disclose the geographic location, by city or town, of  the office in which the lawyer or lawyers who will actually perform the  services advertised principally practice law. &nbsp;If the office location is  outside a city or town, the county in which the office is located must be  disclosed. &nbsp;A lawyer referral service shall disclose the geographic area  in which the lawyer practices when a referral is made.\r\nComment\r\n[1] To  assist the public in obtaining legal services, lawyers should be allowed to  make known their services not only through reputation but also through  organized information campaigns in the form of advertising. &nbsp;Advertising  involves an active quest for clients, contrary to the tradition that a lawyer  should not seek clientele. &nbsp;However, the public's need to know about legal  services can be fulfilled in part through advertising. &nbsp;This need is  particularly acute in the case of persons of moderate means who have not made  extensive use of legal services. &nbsp;The interest in expanding public  information about legal services ought to prevail over considerations of  tradition. &nbsp;Nevertheless, advertising by lawyers entails the risk of  practices that are misleading or overreaching.\r\n[2]  This Rule permits public dissemination of information concerning a lawyer's  name or firm name, address and telephone number; the kinds of services the  lawyer will undertake; the basis on which the lawyer's fees are determined,  including prices for specific services and payment and credit arrangements; a  lawyer's foreign language ability; names of references and, with their consent,  names of clients regularly represented; and other information that might invite  the attention of those seeking legal assistance.\r\n[3]  Questions of effectiveness and taste in advertising are matters of speculation  and subjective judgment. &nbsp;Some jurisdictions have had extensive  prohibitions against television advertising, against advertising going beyond  specified facts about a lawyer, or against &quot;undignified&quot; advertising.  &nbsp;Television is now one of the most powerful media for getting information  to the public, particularly persons of low and moderate income; prohibiting  television advertising, therefore, would impede the flow of information about  legal services to many sectors of the public. &nbsp;Limiting the information  that may be advertised has a similar effect and assumes that the bar can  accurately forecast the kind of information that the public would regard as  relevant. &nbsp;Similarly, electronic media, such as the Internet, can be an  important source of information about legal services, and lawful communication  by electronic mail is permitted by this Rule, but see Rule 7.3(a) for the  prohibition against the solicitation of a prospective client through a real  time electronic exchange that is not initiated by the prospective client.\r\n[4] Regardless  of medium, a lawyer's advertisement should provide only useful, factual  information presented in an objective and understandable fashion so as to  facilitate a prospective client's ability to make an informed choice about  legal representation.&nbsp; A lawyer should  strive to communicate such information without the use of techniques intended  solely to gain attention and which demonstrate a clear and intentional lack of  relevance to the selection of counsel, as such techniques hinder rather than  facilitate intelligent selection of counsel.&nbsp;  A lawyer's advertisement should reflect the serious purpose of legal  services and our judicial system.&nbsp; The  state has a significant interest in protecting against a public loss of  confidence in the legal system, including its participants, and in protecting  specifically against harm to the jury system that might be caused by lawyer  advertising.&nbsp; The effectiveness of the  legal system depends upon the public&rsquo;s trust that the legal system will operate  with fairness and justice.&nbsp; Public trust  is likely to be diminished if the public believes that some participants are  able to obtain results through inappropriate methods.&nbsp; Public confidence also is likely to be  diminished if the public perceives that the personality of their advocate,  rather than the legal merit of their claim, is a key factor in determining the  outcome of their matter.&nbsp; It is necessary  to ensure that lawyer advertisements do not have these detrimental  impacts.&nbsp; This rule is intended to  preserve the public&rsquo;s access to information relevant to the selection of  counsel, while limiting those advertising methods that are most likely to have  a harmful impact on public confidence in the legal system and which are of  little or no benefit to the potential client.\r\n[45]  Neither this Rule nor Rule 7.3 prohibits communications authorized by law, such  as notice to members of a class in class action litigation.\r\nRecord  of Advertising \r\n  [56]  Paragraph (b) imposes upon the lawyer who disseminates an advertisement or  causes its disseminationthe  responsibility for reviewing each advertisement prior to dissemination to  ensure its compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct.&nbsp; It also  requires that a record of the content and use of advertising be kept in order  to facilitate enforcement of this Rule.\r\n Paying  Others to Recommend a Lawyer\r\n  [67]  Lawyers are not permitted to pay others for channeling professional work.  Paragraph (c)(1), however, allows a lawyer to pay for advertising and communications  permitted by this Rule, including the cost of print directory listings, on-line  directory listings, newspaper ads, television and radio airtime, domain-name  registrations, sponsorship fees, banner ads, and group advertising. &nbsp;A  lawyer may compensate employees, agents and vendors who are engaged to provide  marketing or client-development services, such as publicists, public relations  personnel, business development staff and website designers. &nbsp;See Rule 5.3  for the duties of lawyers and law firms with respect to the conduct of  nonlawyers who prepare marketing materials for them.\r\n[78]  A lawyer may pay the usual charges of a legal service plan or a not for profit  lawyer referral service, which is itself not acting in violation of the  Rules of Professional Conduct. &nbsp;A legal service plan is a prepaid or  group legal service plan or a similar delivery system that assists prospective  clients to secure legal representation. &nbsp;A lawyer referral service, on the  other hand, is any organization that holds itself out to the public as a lawyer  referral service. &nbsp;Such referral services are understood by laypersons to  be consumer-oriented organizations that provide unbiased referrals to lawyers  with appropriate experience in the subject matter of the representation and  afford other client protections, such as complaint procedures or malpractice  insurance requirements. &nbsp;Consequently, this Rule only permits a lawyer to  pay the usual charges of a not-for-profit lawyer referral service. &nbsp;The  &ldquo;usual charges&rdquo; may include a portion of legal fees collected by a lawyer from  clients referred by the service when that portion of fees is collected to  support the expenses projected for the referral service.\r\n[89]  A lawyer who accepts assignments or referrals from a legal service plan or  referrals from a lawyer referral service must act reasonably to assure that the  activities of the plan or service are compatible with the lawyer's professional  obligations. &nbsp;See Rule 5.3. &nbsp;Legal service plans and lawyer  referral services may communicate with prospective clients, but such  communication must be in conformity with these Rules. &nbsp;Thus, advertising  must not be false or misleading, as would be the case if the communications of  a group advertising program or a group legal services plan would mislead  prospective clients to think that it was a lawyer referral service sponsored by  a state agency or bar association. &nbsp;See also Rule 7.3(b).\r\n\r\nRULE 7.3: DIRECT CONTACT WITH PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS\r\n(a) A lawyer shall not by in person, live telephone or  real time electronic contact solicit professional employment from a prospective  client when a significant motive for the lawyer&rsquo;s doing so is the lawyer's  pecuniary gain, unless the person contacted:\r\n(1) is a lawyer; or\r\n(2) has a family, close personal, or prior  professional relationship with the lawyer.\r\n(b) A lawyer shall not solicit professional employment  from a prospective client by direct written, recorded or electronic  communication or by in person, telephone, telegraph, facsimile or realtime  electronic contact even when not otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a), if:\r\n(1) the prospective client has made known to the  lawyer a desire not to be solicited by the lawyer;\r\n(2) the solicitation involves coercion, duress,  harassment, fraud, overreaching, intimidation or undue influence;\r\n(3) the solicitation concerns an action for personal  injury or wrongful death or otherwise relates to an accident or disaster  involving the person solicited or a relative of that person unless the accident  or disaster occurred more than thirty (30) days prior to the solicitation;\r\n(4) the solicitation concerns a specific matter and  the lawyer knows, or reasonably should know, that the person solicited is  represented by a lawyer in the matter; or\r\n(5) the lawyer knows, or reasonably should know, that  the physical, emotional, or mental state of the person makes it unlikely that  the person would exercise reasonable judgment in employing a lawyer.\r\n(c) Every written or recorded communication subject  to this Rule, except those directed only to other lawyers, family members,  close personal friends, or persons with whom the sender has a prior or existing  professional relationship, shall be filed with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct  within ten (10) days after any written communication is sent or any recorded  communication is made together with a fee of $50.00. If a written communication  is sent or a recorded communication is made generally to persons similarly  situated, a representative copy may be filed with a listing of those persons to  whom the communication was sent. Any lawyer who uses written, or recorded, or electronic solicitation shall maintain a file for two years  showing the following:\r\n(1) the basis by which the lawyer knows the person  solicited needs legal services; and\r\n(2) the factual basis for any statements made in the  written, or recorded, or electronic communication.\r\n(d) Every written, recorded or electronic  communication from a lawyer soliciting professional employment from a  prospective client known to be in need of legal services in a particular  matter, and with whom the lawyer has no family, close personal or prior  professional relationship, shall conform to Rules 7.1 and 7.2 and, in addition,  must conform to the following provisions:\r\n(1) The words &quot;ADVERTISING MATERIAL,&quot;  printed in capital letters and in prominent type, shall appear on the front of  the outside envelope and on the front of each page of the material. Every such  recorded or electronic communication shall clearly state both at the beginning  and at the end that the communication is an advertisement.&nbsp; If the solicitation is made by computer,  including, but not limited to, electronic mail, the words &quot;ADVERTISING  MATERIAL,&quot; printed in capital letters and in prominent type, shall appear  in any subject line of the message and at the beginning and end of the  communication.\r\n(2) Each written or recorded solicitation must  include the following statements:\r\n(A) &quot;You may wish to consult your lawyer or  another lawyer instead of me (us). You may obtain information about other  lawyers by consulting directories, seeking the advice of others, or the  Yellow Pages or by calling the South Carolina Bar Lawyer Referral Service  at 799-7100 in Columbia or toll free at 1-800-868-2284. If you have already  engaged a lawyer in connection with the legal matter referred to in this  communication, you should direct any questions you have to that lawyer&quot;  and\r\n(B) &quot;The exact nature of your legal situation  will depend on many facts not known to me (us) at this time. You should  understand that the advice and information in this communication is general and  that your own situation may vary.&quot;\r\nWhere the solicitation is written, the above  statements must be in a type no smaller than that used in the body of the  communication.\r\n(3) Each written or recorded solicitation must  include the following statement: &quot;ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS COMMUNICATION LETTER (OR RECORDING) OR THE REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY LAWYER MAY BE  DIRECTED TO THE COMMISSION ON LAWYER CONDUCT, 1015 SUMTER STREET, SUITE 305,  COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA 29201 &ndash; TELEPHONE NUMBER 803-734-2037.&quot; Where the  solicitation is written, this statement must be printed in capital letters and  in a size no smaller than that used in the body of the communication.\r\n(e) Written communications mailed to prospective  clients shall be sent only by regular U.S. mail, not by registered mail or  other forms of restricted or certified delivery.\r\n(f) Written communications mailed to prospective  clients shall not be made to resemble legal pleadings or other legal documents.\r\n(g) Any written communication prompted by a specific  occurrence involving or affecting the intended recipient of the communication  or a family member shall disclose how the lawyer obtained the information  prompting the communication.\r\n(h) A written communication seeking employment by a  specific prospective client in a specific matter shall not reveal on the  envelope, or on the outside of a self mailing brochure or pamphlet, the nature  of the client's legal problem.\r\n(i) If a lawyer reasonably believes knows that a lawyer other than the lawyer whose name or signature appears on the  communication will likely be the lawyer who primarily handles actually  handle the case or matter, or that the case or matter will be referred to  another lawyer or law firm, any written communication concerning a specific  matter shall include a statement so advising the potential client.\r\n(j) Notwithstanding the prohibitions in paragraph (a),  a lawyer may participate with a prepaid or group legal service plan operated by  an organization not owned or directed by the lawyer that uses in person or  telephone contact to solicit memberships or subscriptions for the plan from  persons who are not known to need legal services in a particular matter covered  by the plan. A lawyer may participate with a prepaid or group legal service  plan only if the plan is established in compliance with all statutory and  regulatory requirements imposed upon such plans under South Carolina law.  Lawyers who participate in a legal service plan must make reasonable efforts to  assure that the plan sponsors are in compliance with Rules 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3(b).\r\nComment\r\n[1] There is a potential for abuse inherent in direct  in person or, live telephone or real time electronic contact by a lawyer with a  prospective client known to need legal services. These forms of contact between  a lawyer and a prospective client subject the layperson to the private  importuning of the trained advocate in a direct interpersonal encounter. The  prospective client, who may already feel overwhelmed by the circumstances  giving rise to the need for legal services, may find it difficult to fully  evaluate all available alternatives with reasoned judgment and appropriate self  interest in the face of the lawyer's presence and insistence upon being  retained immediately. The situation is fraught with the possibility of undue  influence, intimidation, and overreaching.\r\n[2] The use of general advertising and written  recorded or electronic communications to transmit information from lawyer to  prospective client, rather than direct in person live telephone or real time  electronic contact, will help to assure that the information flows cleanly as  well as freely. The contents of advertisements and communications permitted  under Rule 7.2 can be permanently recorded so that they cannot be disputed and  may be shared with others who know the lawyer. This potential for informal  review is itself likely to help guard against statements and claims that might  constitute false, misleading, deceptive, or unfair communications, in violation  of Rule 7.1. The contents of direct in person live telephone or real time  electronic conversations between a lawyer and a prospective client can be  disputed and may not be subject to third party scrutiny. Consequently, they are  much more likely to approach, and occasionally cross, the dividing line between  accurate representations and those that are false and misleading.\r\n[3] There is far less likelihood that a lawyer would  engage in abusive practices against an individual who is a former client, or  with whom the lawyer has a close personal or family relationship, or in  situations in which the lawyer is motivated by considerations other than the  lawyer's pecuniary gain. Nor is there a serious potential for abuse when the  person contacted is a lawyer. Consequently, the general prohibition in Rule  7.3(a) and the requirements of Rule 7.3(d) are not applicable in those  situations. Also, paragraph (a) is not intended to prohibit a lawyer from  participating in constitutionally protected activities of public or charitable  legal service organizations or bona fide political, social, civic, fraternal,  employee or trade organizations whose purposes include providing or  recommending legal services to its members or beneficiaries.\r\n[4] But even permitted forms of solicitation can be  abused. Thus, any solicitation which contains information which is false,  misleading, deceptive or unfair within the meaning of Rule 7.1; which involves  coercion, duress, harassment, fraud, overreaching, intimidating or undue  influence within the meaning of Rule 7.3(b)(2); which involves contact with a  prospective client who has made known to the lawyer a desire not to be  solicited by the lawyer within the meaning of Rule 7.3(b)(1); which involves  contact with a person the lawyer reasonably should know is represented by  another lawyer in the matter; or which involves contact with a prospective  client the lawyer reasonably should know is physically, emotionally or mentally  incapable of exercising reasonable judgment in choosing a lawyer under Rule  7.3(b)(5) is prohibited. Moreover, if after sending a letter or other  communication to a client as permitted by Rule 7.2, the lawyer receives no  response, any further effort to communicate with the prospective client may  violate the provisions of Rule 7.3(b).\r\n[5] The public views direct solicitation in the  immediate wake of an accident as an intrusion on the personal privacy and  tranquility of citizens. The 30-day restriction in paragraph (b)(3) is meant to  forestall the outrage and irritation with the legal profession engendered by  crass commercial intrusion by attorneys upon a citizen&rsquo;s personal grief in a  time of trauma. The rule is limited to a brief period, and lawyer advertising  permitted under Rule 7.2 offers alternative means of conveying necessary  information about the need for legal services and the qualifications of  available lawyers and law firms to those who may be in need of legal services  without subjecting the prospective client to direct persuasion that may  overwhelm the client&rsquo;s judgment.\r\n[6] This Rule is not intended to prohibit a lawyer  from contacting representatives of organizations or groups that may be  interested in establishing a group or prepaid legal plan for their members,  insureds, beneficiaries or other third parties for the purpose of informing  such entities of the availability of and details concerning the plan or  arrangement which the lawyer or lawyer's firm is willing to offer. This form of  communication is not directed to a prospective client. Rather, it is usually  addressed to an individual acting in a fiduciary capacity seeking a supplier of  legal services for others who may, if they choose, become prospective clients  of the lawyer. Under these circumstances, the activity which the lawyer  undertakes in communicating with such representatives and the type of  information transmitted to the individual are functionally similar to and serve  the same purpose as advertising permitted under Rule 7.2.\r\n[7] The requirement in Rule 7.3(d) that certain  communications be marked &quot;Advertising Material&quot; does not apply to  communications sent in response to requests of potential clients or their  spokespersons or sponsors. General announcements by lawyers, including changes  in personnel or office location, do not constitute communications soliciting  professional employment from a client known to be in need of legal services  within the meaning of this Rule.\r\n[8] Requiring communications to be marked as  advertisements sent only by regular U.S. mail and prohibiting communications  from resembling legal documents is designed to allow the recipient to choose  whether or not to read the solicitation without fear or legal repercussions. In  addition, the lawyer or law firm should reveal the source of information used  to determine that the recipient has a potential legal problem. Disclosure of  this information source will help the recipient understand the extent of  knowledge the lawyer or law firm has regarding the recipient&rsquo;s particular  situation and will avoid misleading the recipient into believing that the  lawyer has particularized knowledge about the recipient&rsquo;s matter if the lawyer  does not. \r\n[9] Paragraph (j) of this Rule permits a lawyer to  participate with an organization which uses personal contact to solicit members  for its group or prepaid legal service plan, provided that the personal contact  is not undertaken by any lawyer who would be a provider of legal services  through the plan. The organization referred to in paragraph (j) must not be  owned by or directed, whether as manager or otherwise, by any lawyer or law  firm that participates in the plan. For example, paragraph (j) would not permit  a lawyer to create an organization controlled directly or indirectly by the  lawyer and use the organization for the in person or telephone solicitation of  legal employment of the lawyer through memberships in the plan or otherwise.  The communication permitted by these organizations also must not be directed to  a person known to need legal services in a particular matter, but is to be  designed to inform potential plan members generally of another means of  affordable legal services.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27032","title":"CFRE v.

William Ray, of Greenville, for Appellant,\r\n        Jeffrey D. Wile, County of Greenville, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING\r\n  JUSTICE MOORE:Â  CFRE, LLC appeals the decision of the Administrative Law\r\n  Court (ALC) that real estate owned by the company is not entitled to the\r\n  residential tax ratio under Section 12-43-220(c) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  Furthermore, CFRE argues the ALC erred in not sanctioning the\r\n  Greenville County Assessor (Assessor) for failing to respond to discovery\r\n  requests from CFRE.Â  While we hold the ALC did not abuse its discretion in not\r\n  sanctioning the Assessor, we reverse the ALC's conclusion regarding CFRE's\r\n  entitlement to the legal residence tax ratio and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nSherry Ray purchased residential property\r\n  in Greenville County, South Carolina, in 1991 and has lived there continuously\r\n  ever since.Â  Because she owned no other residential property, the property was\r\n  taxed at the four percent legal residence tax ratio.\r\nIn\r\n  2004, Ray formed CFRE, a single-member limited liability company with herself\r\n  as the sole member.Â  CFRE conducts no business and was formed solely for estate\r\n  planning and asset protection purposes.Â  To that end, Ray declined to have CFRE\r\n  taxed as a corporation and, in 2006, deeded the title in her home to it.Â \r\n  Because there was a conveyance by deed of the property, the Assessor\r\n  automatically commenced a reassessment of the property for the 2007 tax year.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the property was subjected to the default property tax ratio of\r\n  six percent until CFRE could prove entitlement to the lower ratio under section\r\n  12-43-220.[1]\r\nWhen\r\n  CFRE sought the four percent ratio, the Assessor denied it eligibility.Â  CFRE\r\n  then requested a personal interview with the Assessor's office, which is the\r\n  next step in the appeals process.Â  During that interview, Ray met with Debbie\r\n  Adkins, who is the manager for the group within the Assessor's office\r\n  responsible for property classifications.Â  Adkins refused to change the ratio\r\n  back to four percent because she believed, based primarily on an Attorney\r\n  General's Opinion from 2003, a limited liability company categorically cannot\r\n  qualify for it.Â  CFRE then appealed to the Greenville County Board of\r\n  Assessment Appeals, which affirmed the Assessor's decision.[2]Â  Accordingly, CFRE requested a\r\n  contested case hearing before the ALC.\r\nFollowing\r\n  assignment to the ALC, CFRE filed interrogatories and a request for production\r\n  on the Assessor.Â  After not receiving a response to either of these, CFRE filed\r\n  a motion to compel.Â  Apparently in response to CFRE's motion, the ALC ordered\r\n  the Assessor to produce certain documents pertaining to the case; however, the\r\n  court did not specifically order the Assessor to respond to the interrogatories\r\n  or requests for production.Â  Although the Assessor never did respond to CFRE's discovery\r\n  requests, it fully complied with the court's order, submitting its preliminary\r\n  tax appeal statement, which set forth a statement of the facts and legal\r\n  authority it planned to use, and a filing titled &quot;Exchange of Evidence and\r\n  Foundation for Documents.&quot;Â  Furthermore, the Assessor twice supplemented\r\n  these filings.\r\nJust days\r\n  before the hearing, CFRE moved to prevent the Assessor from presenting any\r\n  evidence or argument due to its failure to respond to the discovery requests.Â \r\n  The Assessor steadfastly maintained that it had provided CFRE all the\r\n  information in the Assessor's possession regarding this dispute and asked the\r\n  court to permit the case to proceed.Â  Although the ALC sua sponte offered\r\n  to grant CFRE a continuance and order the Assessor to specifically respond to CFRE's\r\n  discovery requests, CFRE declined the court's invitation because it believed\r\n  the Assessor would simply respond that there is no additional information it\r\n  could provide.Â  \r\nUltimately,\r\n  the ALC found CFRE was not entitled to the four percent ratio.Â  In particular,\r\n  the ALC held that only a &quot;natural person&quot; could qualify for the legal\r\n  residence ratio.Â  The court further found that the General Assembly's failure\r\n  to adopt two amendments to section 12-43-220 specifically stating that\r\n  single-member limited liability companies could qualify demonstrates the General\r\n  Assembly's original intent that they could not.Â  Finally, the court supported\r\n  its ruling with two Attorney General's Opinions stating these companies cannot\r\n  receive the four percent ratio.Â  CFRE appealed to the court of appeals, and\r\n  this case was certified to us pursuant to Rule 204, SCACR.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\nThree\r\n  issues are raised on appeal:[3]\r\nI.&nbsp; Did the ALC err in\r\n  concluding that a single-member limited liability company that is not taxed as\r\n  a corporation cannot qualify for the four percent legal residence property tax\r\n  ratio?\r\nII.&nbsp; Did the ALC err in not\r\n  sanctioning the Assessor for its failure to respond to CFRE's discovery\r\n  requests?\r\nIII. Is CFRE entitled to\r\n  costs and attorney's fees?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; ELIGIBILITY FOR\r\n  FOUR PERCENT RATIO\r\nCFRE argues the ALC erred in concluding that section 12-2-25(B)(1)\r\n  only applies to income taxes[4] and only natural persons can qualify for the legal residence ratio.Â  We agree.\r\nTax appeals to the ALC are subject to the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act (APA). Long Cove Home Owners' Ass'n v. Beaufort County Tax\r\n    Equalization Bd., 327 S.C. 135, 139, 488 S.E.2d 857, 860 (1997).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we review the decision of the ALC for errors of law. S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(d) (Supp. 2010).Â  Questions\r\n  of statutory interpretation are questions of law, which we are free to decide\r\n  without any deference to the court below. City of Rock Hill v. Harris,\r\n  391 S.C. 149, 152, 705 S.E.2d 53, 54 (2011).\r\n&quot;The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to\r\n  ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.&quot; Sloan v.\r\n    Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 498, 640 S.E.2d 457, 459 (2007).Â  In doing so, we\r\n  must give the words found in the statute their &quot;plain and ordinary meaning\r\n  without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's\r\n  operation.&quot; Id. at 499, 640 S.E.2d at 459.Â  Thus if the words are\r\n  unambiguous, we must apply their literal meaning. Id. at 498, 640 S.E.2d\r\n  at 459.\r\nHowever, &quot;the statute must be read as a whole and sections\r\n  which are part of the same general statutory law must be construed together and\r\n  each one given effect.&quot; S.C. State Ports Auth. v. Jasper County,\r\n  368 S.C. 388, 398, 629 S.E.2d 624, 629 (2006).Â  We therefore should not\r\n  concentrate on isolated phrases within the statute. Id.Â  Instead, we\r\n  read the statute as a whole and in a manner consonant and in harmony with its\r\n  purpose. State v. Sweat, 379 S.C.\r\n  367, 376, 665 S.E.2d 645, 650 (Ct. App. 2008), aff'd, 386 S.C. 339, 688\r\n  S.E.2d 569 (2010).Â  In that\r\n  vein, we must read the statute so &quot;that no word, clause, sentence,\r\n  provision or part shall be rendered surplusage, or superfluous,&quot; id. at 377, 665 S.E.2d at 651, for &quot;[t]he General Assembly obviously intended\r\n  [the statute] to have some efficacy, or the legislature would not have enacted\r\n  it into law&quot; id. at 382, 665 S.E.2d at 654.\r\nIn this case, interlaced with these standard canons of statutory\r\n  construction is our policy of strictly construing tax exemption statutes\r\n  against the taxpayer. See Se.-Kusan, Inc. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 276 S.C.\r\n  487, 489, 280 S.E.2d 57, 58 (1981).Â  &quot;This rule of strict construction\r\n  simply means that constitutional and statutory language will not be strained or\r\n  liberally construed in the taxpayer's favor.Â  It does not mean that we will\r\n  search for an interpretation in [DOR]'s favor where the plain and unambiguous\r\n  language leaves no room for construction.&quot; Id.Â  It is &quot;[o]nly\r\n  when the literal application of the statute produces an absurd result will we\r\n  consider a different meaning.&quot; Id. at 499-90, 280 S.E.2d at 58. \r\n\r\nSection 12-43-220\r\n  provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  (c)(1)Â \r\n    The legal residence and not more than five acres contiguous thereto, when owned\r\n    totally or in part in fee or by life estate and occupied by the owner of the\r\n    interest, . . . are taxed on an assessment equal to four percent of the fair\r\n    market value of the property.Â  If residential real estate is held in trust and\r\n    the income beneficiary of the trust occupies the property as a residence, then\r\n    the assessment ratio allowed by this item applies . . . .Â  If this property has\r\n    located on it any . . . business for profit, this four percent value does not\r\n    apply to those businesses . . . .Â  For purposes of the assessment ratio . . .,\r\n    a residence does not qualify as a legal residence unless the residence is\r\n    determined to be the domicile of the owner-applicant.\r\n\r\nSection 12-2-25(B) further\r\n  provides that &quot;[f]or South Carolina tax purposes: (1) a single-member\r\n  limited liability company, which is not taxed for South Carolina income tax\r\n  purposes as a corporation, is not regarded as an entity separate from its\r\n  owner.&quot;\r\nIn\r\n  the case before us, it is undisputed that the residence is on less than five\r\n  acres, owned in fee by CFRE, has no business for profit conducted on it, and is\r\n  Ray's sole domicile.Â  It is further undisputed that CFRE is a single-member\r\n  limited liability company that conducts no business for profit, is not taxed as\r\n  a corporation, and has no other location besides the property in question.Â \r\n  Thus, the only question presented is whether section 12-2-25(B)(1) permits\r\n  single-member limited liability companies in the same position as CFRE to\r\n  receive the lower ratio provided for in section 12-43-220.\r\nÂ Initially, we note\r\n  that section 12-2-25(B)(1) appears in the &quot;General Provisions&quot;\r\n  chapter of Title 12, which ostensibly applies to all the different forms of\r\n  taxation provided for therein, be it income tax, corporate license fees, deed\r\n  recording fees, gasoline tax, sales and use tax, county property tax, or any of\r\n  the other myriad taxes imposed through that title.Â  Furthermore, this section\r\n  contains no language limiting its application within Title 12 in any way;\r\n  rather, it simply applies generally for &quot;South Carolina tax purposes.&quot;[5]Â \r\n  Thus, the plain language of section 12-2-25(B)(1) renders it applicable to all\r\n  forms of taxation in Title 12, and we would have to &quot;search for an\r\n  interpretation in [DOR]'s favor&quot; to hold otherwise.Â  If the General\r\n  Assembly had intended its scope to be limited, say to just income taxes, it should\r\n  have placed this language in the chapter pertaining to those taxes as opposed\r\n  to the general provisions.Â  Indeed, in this very case the Assessor did not\r\n  impose a deed recording fee for Ray's transfer of the property to CFRE, a fee\r\n  it would have been subject to but for section 12-2-25(B)(1). See S.C.\r\n  Rev. Rul. 04-6, 2004 WL 1277696, at *12 (&quot;Deeds that transfer realty to\r\n  the SMLLC from its single member, and deeds that transfer realty to the single\r\n  member of the SMLLC from the SMLLC, are not subject to the deed recording fee\r\n  if the SMLLC is ignored for all tax purposes under the provisions of Code Section\r\n  12-2-25(B).&quot;).Â  \r\nEven under the\r\n  principles of strict construction, we cannot ignore the plain language of\r\n  section 12-2-25(B)(1) that contains no restrictions on its applicability within\r\n  Title 12.Â  See Se.-Kusan, 276 S.C. at 490, 280 S.E.2d at 59 (&quot;The\r\n  clear language [of the exemption] does not restrict or condition the exemption\r\n  upon use [of the machinery] by the owner.Â  To allow Southeastern to claim this\r\n  exemption produces no absurd result . . . . Â For these reasons, Southeastern\r\n  may claim the exemption . . . .&quot;).Â  In fact, restricting its application\r\n  to solely income taxes would render it completely superfluous.Â  Under the\r\n  income tax provisions in Title 12, an entity that is not taxed as a corporation\r\n  under State law will be taxed through the individual member. S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-6-510 (2000); Anonymous Taxpayer v. S.C. Dep't of Rev., No.\r\n  07-ALJ-17-0189-CC, 2007 WL 2782804, at *2-3 (S.C. Admin. L. Judge Div. Aug. 23,\r\n  2007).Â  Thus, for income tax purposes the company is already &quot;not regarded\r\n  as an entity separate from its owner,&quot; irrespective of any other provision;\r\n  there would be no need for section 12-2-25(B)(1) if its scope were limited to\r\n  just income taxes.\r\nWe further note\r\n  that DOR, the agency charged with administering this State's revenue laws, has\r\n  consistently interpreted section 12-2-25(B)(1) as applying broadly.Â  &quot;The\r\n  construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be\r\n  accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent\r\n  compelling reasons.&quot; Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Exam'rs in Optometry,\r\n  291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987).Â  For example, we will reject an\r\n  agency's interpretation if it conflicts with the statute's plain language. Brown\r\n    v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 440, 581 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2003).\r\nAt the hearing,\r\n  CFRE introduced five publications from DOR which contain DOR's opinion that\r\n  section 12-2-25(B)(1) applies to all taxes, not just income taxes: (1) a report\r\n  from 2004 on legislative changes stating that the definitions in section\r\n  12-2-25 apply to all titles administered by DOR; (2) an undated tax worksheet\r\n  that states &quot;if a single member LLC is disregarded as an entity separate\r\n  from its owner for federal income tax purposes, it is similarly disregarded for\r\n  South Carolina income tax purposes&quot; but then, in a later section, states\r\n  generally that section 12-2-25(B)(1) &quot;provides that a single member LLC\r\n  which is not taxed as a corporation will be ignored for all South Carolina tax\r\n  purposes&quot;; (3) a business tax guide from 2007 that provides, &quot;A\r\n  single member limited liability corporation [sic] that elects to be disregarded\r\n  for federal income tax purposes will be disregarded for state tax purposes&quot;;\r\n  and (4) two publications concerning tax incentives for economic development,\r\n  one from 2008 and one from 2009, stating that this section &quot;provides that\r\n  a single member limited liability company that is not taxed as a corporation\r\n  for South Carolina income tax purposes will be ignored for all South Carolina\r\n  tax purposes.&quot;\r\nDOR has also\r\n  applied section 12-2-25(B)(1) to provide this tax treatment in specific\r\n  situations beyond income taxes.Â  We have already noted that DOR believes the\r\n  company is exempt from deed recording fees if it meets the criteria of section\r\n  12-2-25(B)(1). See S.C. Rev. Rul. 04-6, 2004 WL 1277696, at *12.Â  DOR\r\n  also found section 12-2-25(B)(1) means &quot;these entities are treated as part\r\n  of their member . . . for South Carolina sales and use tax purposes as well as\r\n  South Carolina income tax purposes.&quot; S.C. Rev. Advis. Bull. 01-1, 2001 WL\r\n  34035772, at *2; see also S.C. Priv. Rev. Op. 00-4, 2000 WL 33941904, at\r\n  *1-2.Â  Additionally, DOR concluded that, based on section 12-2-25(B)(1), these\r\n  single-member limited liability companies are not required to pay corporate\r\n  license fees. S.C. Rev. Rul. 98-11, 1998 WL 34035222, at *2. \r\n Because there is\r\n  no limitation within section 12-2-25(B)(1) as to which areas of taxation it\r\n  applies, DOR's construction of this sectionâ€”both before and after the amendment\r\n  removing the word &quot;all&quot;â€”comports with its plain language.Â \r\n  Furthermore, we cannot find any compelling reasons to disregard DOR's\r\n  interpretation, and the Assessor has pointed to none.Â  DOR's own broader\r\n  interpretation also militates against any effects of strictly construing this\r\n  statute against CFRE.Â  Therefore, we accord due deference to this agency's view\r\n  and hold that section 12-2-25(B)(1) generally applies to all forms of taxation\r\n  under Title 12 absent some other provision limiting it.[6]\r\nWe also hold the\r\n  ALC erred in finding that only a natural person can qualify for the legal\r\n  residence ratio.[7]Â \r\n  Strictly construing section 12-43-220, it does appear at first blush that only\r\n  a natural person can qualify for that ratio.Â  However, we cannot examine\r\n  section 12-43-220 in isolation, and the ALC's order overlooked the specific impact\r\n  of section 12-2-25(B)(1).Â  That section disregards the corporate form for\r\n  single-member limited liability companies that are not taxed as corporations, thereby\r\n  merging the existence of the company and its member for all tax purposes.Â  This\r\n  means the company will qualify for any tax benefits its member qualifies for.Â  Section\r\n  12-2-25(B)(1) is therefore the General Assembly's conferral of a special\r\n  benefit on these companies that is not available for other business\r\n  organizations that are also legally separate entities.Â  It is not that the\r\n  company itself is eligible independently, but rather it is eligible\r\n  derivatively through its member; if that member is a natural person who meets\r\n  all the criteria imposed by section 12-43-220 with respect to property titled\r\n  in the company's name, then the company is entitled to this lower ratio. Â Because\r\n  it is undisputed that Ray herself meets all the requirements of section\r\n  12-43-220 with respect to CFRE's property, CFRE is entitled to the legal\r\n  residence ratio.Â  Accordingly, we remand this matter for a determination of the\r\n  precise refund owed to it.Â  \r\nAs a\r\n  final matter, we wish to address the ALC's reliance on two unenacted pieces of\r\n  legislation specifically incorporating single-member limited liability\r\n  companies within section 12-43-220 as demonstrative of the General Assembly's\r\n  intent with respect to the current version of section 12-2-25(B)(1).[8]Â \r\n  The ALC's logic in relying on these bills went as follows: because an amendment\r\n  presumably changes a statute, these bills would only be necessary to change\r\n  section 12-2-25(B)(1)'s impact on section 12-43-220(c), which means\r\n  12-2-25(B)(1) currently does not permit these companies to receive the lower\r\n  ratio. See Key Corporate Capital, Inc. v. County of Beaufort, 373 S.C.\r\n  55, 60, 644 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2007) (&quot;We have long acknowledged the\r\n  presumption that in adopting an amendment to a statute, the Legislature\r\n  intended to change the existing law.&quot;).\r\nHowever, the\r\n  Supreme Court of the United States has stated the problem of relying on\r\n  unenacted legislation quite succinctly:\r\n\r\n  We have\r\n    stated, however, that failed legislative proposals are &quot;a particularly\r\n    dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute.Â \r\n    Congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance because several equally\r\n    tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction, including the inference\r\n    that the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change.&quot;\r\n\r\nCent. Bank of Denver, N.A.\r\n    v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A.,\r\n    511 U.S. 164, 187 (1994) (quoting Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp.,\r\n    496 U.S. 633, 650 (1962)).Â  &quot;The interpretation placed upon an existing\r\n    statute by a subsequent group of Congressmen who are promoting legislation and\r\n    who are unsuccessful has no persuasive significance here.&quot; United\r\n      States v. Wise, 370 U.S. 405, 411 (1962).Â  Therefore, &quot;[w]hether\r\n    Congress thought the proposal unwise . . . or unnecessary, we cannot tell;\r\n    accordingly, no inference can properly be drawn from the failure of the\r\n    Congress to act.&quot; United States v. Price, 361 U.S. 304, 312 (1960); see also Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 9, 492 S.E.2d 777, 781 (1997) (&quot;Generally,\r\n    the legislature's subsequent acts 'cast no light on the intent of the\r\n    legislature which enacted the statute being construed.'&quot;).\r\nThe present case\r\n  perfectly illustrates the very folly of relying on unenacted legislation.Â  Both\r\n  CFRE and the Assessor could use the General Assembly's failure to enact Senate\r\n  Bills 1313 and 230 equally to their advantage: the Assessor could argue the\r\n  bills' failure demonstrates the General Assembly's intent to exclude\r\n  single-member limited liability companies from section 12-43-220, while CFRE\r\n  could argue that because an amendment presumes a change to the existing\r\n  statute, these bills were unnecessary as sections 12-2-25(B)(1) and 12-43-220\r\n  already conferred this benefit.Â  Bills are introduced and fail in the General\r\n  Assembly for any number of reasons, and it would be beyond speculation for us\r\n  or any court to divine some import and meaning from the mere fact that the\r\n  bills did not become law.Â  Absent something more, it was error for the ALC to\r\n  rely on them. Cf. Stardancer Casino, Inc. v. Stewart, 347 S.C. 377, 385\r\n  n.13, 556 S.E.2d 357, 361 n.13 (2001) (stating it was permissible to rely, in\r\n  part, on unenacted amendments because the failed bills were proposed by the\r\n  same General Assembly that passed the legislation in question).\r\nII.&nbsp; DISCOVERY REQUESTS\r\nCFRE\r\n  next argues that the ALC erred by not sanctioning the Assessor for its failure\r\n  to formally respond to CFRE's interrogatories and production requests. Â We\r\n  disagree. \r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, CFRE has waived this issue. Â A litigant cannot concede an\r\n  issue at trial and then raise it on appeal. Southern Ry. v. Routh, 161\r\n  S.C. 328, 333, 159 S.E. 640, 642 (1930). Â At the hearing, CFRE moved to prevent\r\n  the Assessor from presenting any evidence or arguments because the Assessor\r\n  never responded to CFRE's discovery requests.Â  During arguments on the motion,\r\n  the court sua sponte offered to continue the proceedings and order a\r\n  formal response from the Assessor.Â  However, CFRE declined the court's\r\n  invitation and agreed that a continuance would be unlikely to produce anything\r\n  further.Â  CFRE then admitted &quot;there are no material facts in dispute and\r\n  the controversy [is] one of the law.&quot; Â This concession before the\r\n  ALC that CFRE would receive no further information from the Assessor and there\r\n  were no facts in dispute amounts to a waiver of any discovery issues. Â If CFRE\r\n  wished to have the discovery process formally completed because there truly\r\n  were undisclosed facts, it should have taken the sua sponte offer\r\n  compelling formal responses given by the court.\r\nHowever,\r\n  CFRE contends it has not waived this issue because it learned of the existence\r\n  of another witness after CFRE's initial concessions to the ALC.Â  Adkins, in\r\n  cross examination, revealed that her staff makes the initial classification of\r\n  which tax ratio should be applied to the taxpayer, but she alone has the final\r\n  decision of which ratio to apply.Â  CFRE therefore contends that there is\r\n  another person who has come in contact with this case previously unknown to\r\n  it.Â  However, Adkins' testimony makes clear that the unknown witness would not add\r\n  any material facts or clarify any facts in dispute.Â  Therefore, the existence\r\n  of this witness is immaterial and CFRE's concession that it would receive\r\n  nothing more of substance from the Assessor still stands.\r\nEven\r\n  if CFRE has not waived this issue, the ALC did not abuse its discretion in not\r\n  ordering sanctions against the Assessor.Â  &quot;In determining the\r\n  appropriateness of a sanction, the court should consider such factors as the\r\n  precise nature of the discovery and the discovery posture of the case,\r\n  willfulness, and degree of prejudice.&quot; McNair v. Fairfield County,\r\n  379 S.C. 462, 467, 665 S.E.2d 830, 832 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  A trial court's\r\n  decision on whether or not to impose discovery sanctions is reviewed for abuse\r\n  of discretion. Jamison v. Ford Motor Co., 373 S.C. 248, 270, 644 S.E.2d\r\n  755, 767 (Ct. App. 2007); see also Original Blue Ribbon Taxi Corp. v.\r\n    SC Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 380 S.C. 600, 604, 670 S.E.2d 674, 676 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008) (stating that the reviewing tribunal may affirm, reverse, or remand\r\n  the decision of the ALC if &quot;the substantive rights of the petitioner has\r\n  been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or decision is . . . arbitrary\r\n  or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted\r\n  exercise of discretion.&quot;).\r\nAn\r\n  affirmative duty does exist to answer interrogatories and respond to\r\n  requests to produce. See Rule 33(a), SCRCP (&quot;Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected\r\n  to, in which event the reasons for objections shall be stated in lieu of an\r\n  answer.&quot; (emphasis added)); Rule 34(b), SCRCP (&quot;The party upon whom\r\n  the request is served shall serve a written response . . . .&quot;\r\n  (emphasis added)); see also Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 109-10,\r\n  495 S.E.2d 213, 215-16 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating that parties must disclose all\r\n  evidence, or at least the existence of evidence, that relates to the case, not\r\n  only evidence which they intend to use at trial).[9]\r\nHere,\r\n  the Assessor failed to formally answer any of the standard interrogatories or\r\n  production requests. Â However, the ALC required the Assessor to produce\r\n  various documents and enter them into the record, an order with which the\r\n  Assessor fully complied.Â  Furthermore, the documents submitted to the court\r\n  created a complete record of the facts.Â  Thus, despite arguing that it has been\r\n  &quot;prevented from being fully prepared for trial,&quot; there is no evidence\r\n  of what material facts were not produced to CFRE, and anything CFRE contends is\r\n  missing immaterial and irrelevant.Â  Therefore, CFRE ultimately received all pertinent\r\n  and material information it would have been entitled to had the Assessor\r\n  specifically answered CFRE's requests.\r\nThus,\r\n  notwithstanding the duty to formally answer the interrogatories and production\r\n  requests, CFRE was not prejudiced by the Assessor's failure to do so.Â  Although\r\n  CFRE argues that Downey v. Dixon, 294 S.C. 42, 362 S.E.2d 317 (Ct. App.\r\n  1987), mandates that prejudice be presumed where there has been a failure of\r\n  discovery, it fails to relay the remainder of the sentence in question from Downey:\r\n  &quot;[P]rejudice must be presumed and, unless the party who has\r\n    failed to submit to discovery can show lack of prejudice, reversal\r\n  is required.&quot; Id. at 46, 362 S.E.2d at 319 (emphasis added). Â As\r\n  the Assessor correctly notes, CFRE itself conceded that there was nothing more\r\n  the Assessor could produce that is of any consequence.Â  The sole undiscovered\r\n  fact that CFRE contends exists is the identity of an unnamed employee of the\r\n  Assessor whom CFRE believes could be an additional witness, but that witness\r\n  would provide no additional information.Â  Accordingly, the Assessor has met its\r\n  burden in proving that CFRE suffered no prejudice as a result of its merely\r\n  technical failure to comply with this Court's discovery rules.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  hold that the ALC did not abuse its discretion in not sanctioning the Assessor.\r\nIII.&nbsp; COSTS\r\nIn\r\n  its brief, CFRE requested that this Court award costs in the amount of $646.50,\r\n  the same amount it requested from the ALC.Â  Furthermore, in its reply brief,\r\n  CFRE requested an award of attorney's fees.Â  However, &quot;[i]n an action\r\n  covered by [the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act (SCRPA)], no costs or\r\n  disbursements may be charged or allowed to either party, except for the service\r\n  of process and attendance of witnesses.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-3350\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  As this action is governed by the SCPRA in the tribunals below, see\r\n    id. Â§ 12-60-2510, et seq., CFRE is not entitled to attorney's fees\r\n  but may be entitled to some costs.Â  Because CFRE did not identify which costs,\r\n  if any, are attributable to service of process or attendance of witnesses, the\r\n  court on remand is to determine which costs are appropriate for CFRE to\r\n  receive.Â  To the extent CFRE desires an award of costs and attorney's fees incurred\r\n  before this Court, it must make the appropriate motion at the appropriate time.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore, we hold\r\n  that CFRE was entitled to the four percent legal residence ratio for the 2007\r\n  tax year.Â  Accordingly, we remand this case to the ALC for a determination of\r\n  the refund due to CFRE.Â  A remand is also in order for a determination of which\r\n  costs, if any, CFRE may receive.Â  However, we affirm the ALC's denial of\r\n  sanctions against the Assessor for its failure to respond to CFRE's discovery\r\n  requests.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This reassessment also resulted in an increase in the\r\n  property's fair market and taxable market values.Â  CFRE and the Assessor\r\n  reached a separate agreement with respect to this increase that is not the\r\n  subject of this appeal.\r\n[2] At some point during this process, Adkins told Ray\r\n  that if she were to retain a life estate in the property, with CFRE having the\r\n  remainder, she could receive the four percent ratio.Â  Ray amended the 2006 deed\r\n  to reflect this and accordingly has received this lower ratio for all subsequent\r\n  years.Â  Thus, CFRE is only appealing the imposition of the six percent ratio\r\n  for the 2007 tax year.Â  We express no opinion regarding whether this transfer\r\n  was valid. \r\n[3] We have consolidated CFRE's Issues on Appeal I, II,\r\n  and IV because they all concern the ALC's interpretation of Section\r\n  12-2-25(B)(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010).Â  Furthermore, we have\r\n  restated CFRE's Issue on Appeal III to reflect the thrust of CFRE's argument as\r\n  it solely concerns the harm CFRE suffered as a result of the Assessor's conduct\r\n  during discovery.\r\n[4] It is not clear whether the ALC actually held section\r\n  12-2-25(B)(1) applies only to income taxes.Â  In fact, the only reference to\r\n  income taxes comes from the court's quotation of an Attorney General's Opinion\r\n  and not from any holding of the court.Â  However, because both parties argue\r\n  this point in their briefs and it would be an additional sustaining ground\r\n  under Rule 220(c), SCACR, we address this issue in full.\r\n[5] Prior to the 2001 amendments to section 12-2-25(B), that\r\n  section explicitly stated that single-member limited liability companies\r\n  received this treatment for &quot;all South Carolina tax purposes.&quot;\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-2-25(B) (2000) (emphasis added).Â  The 2001 amendments\r\n  removed the word &quot;all&quot; from the language, but they also added a host\r\n  of other provisions to subsection (B) that are not relevant to this case. See 2001 Act No. 89 Â§ 5.Â  We do not believe this deletion was substantive, and as\r\n  discussed infra, the Department of Revenue (DOR) has not treated it as\r\n  such.\r\n[6] In reaching this conclusion, we assign no weight to\r\n  the two Attorney General's Opinions relied upon the ALC. See Eargle v. Horry\r\n    County, 344 S.C. 449, 455, 545 S.E.2d 276, 280 (2001) (&quot;[T]his Court\r\n  is not bound by opinions of the Attorney General.&quot;).Â  The first one did\r\n  not address the impact of section 12-2-25(B)(1) on section 12-43-220. See\r\n    generally Op. S.C. Att'y Gen. (Sept. 23, 2003), 2003 WL 22378701.Â  The\r\n  second found section 12-2-25(B)(1) was the General Assembly's attempt to enact\r\n  a State counterpart to the federal statutes disregarding the corporate form in\r\n  these circumstances for income tax purposes without citing any authority for\r\n  this proposition. See Op. S.C. Att'y Gen. (Feb. 26, 2009), 2009 WL\r\n  580568, at *4.Â  Furthermore, the second relied on the fact that this section\r\n  references income tax in support of its argument that its scope is limited, see\r\n    id., but such a reading renders those words meaningless.Â  The reference to\r\n  income taxes merely is a threshold requirement.\r\n[7] The ALC based its ruling mainly on the use of the\r\n  first person in the following certification signed by the applicant:\r\n\r\n  Under\r\n    penalty of perjury, I certify that:\r\n  (A)&nbsp; the residence which is the subject\r\n    of this application is my legal residence and where I am domiciled at the time\r\n    of this application and that I do not claim to be a legal resident of a\r\n    jurisdiction other than South Carolina for any purpose; and\r\n  (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;that neither I nor any other\r\n    member of my household is residing in or occupying any other residence which I\r\n    or any member of my immediate family has qualified for the special assessment\r\n    ratio allowed by this section.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-43-220(c)(2)(ii); see also 27 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 117-1800.1(2)\r\n  (Supp. 2010) (&quot;For property tax purposes the term 'Legal Residence' shall\r\n  mean the permanent home or dwelling place owned by a person and\r\n  occupied by the person thereof or where he or she is domiciled.&quot;\r\n  (emphasis added)).\r\n[8] In 2008, the following language was proposed to\r\n  be added to section 12-43-220(c)(2)(i):\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    single-member limited liability company where the single-member is an\r\n    individual and that is not taxed for South Carolina income tax purposes as a\r\n    corporation shall be considered an owner-occupant for purposes of the special\r\n    property tax assessment ratio allowed by this item, if the single-member\r\n    limited liability company is able to meet all the requirements of subsection\r\n    (c).\r\n\r\nS. 1313, 117th Gen.\r\n  Assem. (S.C. 2008).Â  The proposed amendment did not pass.Â  The following year,\r\n  an identical amendment was introduced and never left the committee. See S. 230, 118th Gen. Assem. (S.C. 2009).\r\n[9] Rule 21 of the Â­Â­Â­Â­Rules of Procedure for the\r\n  Administrative Law Court states that &quot;[d]iscovery shall be conducted according\r\n  to the procedures in Rules 26-37, SCRCP, except that only the standard\r\n  interrogatories provided by SCRCP 33(b), as applicable to the pending contested\r\n  case, are permitted.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27033","title":"Terry v.

Few, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 27033\r\n  Heard June 21, 2011 - Filed August 29,\r\n2011\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\nTeresa\r\n  L. Norris, of Blume Weyble and Norris, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney\r\n  General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy\r\n  Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Senior Assistant Attorney General\r\n  William Edgar Salter, III, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES: Â Petitioner\r\n  was sentenced to death for murder, life imprisonment for first-degree burglary,\r\n  thirty years' imprisonment for first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and ten\r\n  years' imprisonment for malicious injury to a telephone system.Â  All sentences\r\n  were consecutive.Â  This Court affirmed petitioner's convictions and sentences\r\n  on direct appeal.Â  State v. Terry, 339 S.C. 352, 529 S.E.2d 274 (2000), cert.\r\n    denied, 531 U.S. 882 (2000).\r\nWe\r\n  granted a writ of certiorari to review the denial of petitioner's application\r\n  for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe underlying facts, as taken from Terry, supra,\r\n  are as follows:Â  the victim, forty-seven-year-old Urai Jackson, was found\r\n  beaten to death in her Lexington County home.Â  The window on the carport door\r\n  to her home had been broken out and the telephone wires had been pulled from\r\n  the phone box.Â  Victim's mostly nude body was found in her living room, and\r\n  semen was found in her vagina.Â  She had several blunt trauma wounds to the\r\n  head, and a number of defensive wound injuries.Â  The cause of death was blunt\r\n  trauma with skull fracture and brain injury.\r\n After\r\n  his arrest, petitioner gave a statement to police in which he maintained he had\r\n  gone to victim's house and had consensual sex with her. According to\r\n  petitioner, the victim became angered when he started to leave and grabbed him\r\n  by the hair.Â  He lost his temper and began hitting her with an object.Â  He\r\n  could not recall the object but believed the victim may have brought it with\r\n  her from the bedroom.Â  He hit her several times, then left.\r\n\r\nPrior to trial, the State requested a Jackson v. Denno[1] hearing to determine the voluntariness of petitioner's statement.Â  The trial\r\n  judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the statement was voluntary.\r\nIn an\r\n  attempt to minimize the statement's effect on the jury, trial counsel alluded\r\n  to the statement in his opening statement.Â  Trial counsel stated:\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, [petitioner] over here told the police that\r\n  he did it.Â  He told the police that he had sexual intercourse with [victim].Â \r\n  He told the police that he killed her, okay.Â  It's called a confession and he\r\n  made one.Â  He told the police he did it.Â  So what in the world are we doing\r\n  here?Â  Why are we even having one of these guilt phases?\r\nThe State did not\r\n  seek to introduce the statement in the guilt phase of trial.\r\nAs part of its case in chief, the State called the police officer\r\n  who took petitioner's statement.Â  Before the officer testified, the State moved in limine to prevent the admission of the statement.Â  Trial counsel\r\n  argued the statement was admissible pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, as a\r\n  statement against interest.Â  The trial court ruled the statement was\r\n  inadmissible under Rule 804 because petitioner procured his unavailability by exercising\r\n  his right to remain silent.\r\nPetitioner elected not to testify at trial.Â  Although the\r\n  statement was never introduced in the guilt phase of trial, the State did\r\n  introduce it during the penalty phase.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Were trial counsel\r\n  ineffective for failing to object to the exclusion of petitioner's statement\r\n  based on prosecutorial misconduct?\r\n\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Were trial counsel\r\n  ineffective for failing to adjust their strategy and continuing to pursue a\r\n  &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; defense?\r\n\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  On\r\n    certiorari in a PCR action, the Court applies the &quot;any evidence&quot;\r\n    standard of review.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624,\r\n    626 (1989).Â  Accordingly, the Court will affirm if any evidence of probative\r\n    value in the record exists to support the findings of the PCR court.Â  Id. at 119, 386 S.E.2d at 626.\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI. Petitioner's\r\n  Statement\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues trial counsel were ineffective in failing to\r\n  argue during the hearing on the State's in limine motion that the\r\n  statement should have been introduced because of the State's misconduct and\r\n  trial counsels' detrimental reliance on the State's &quot;apparent intent&quot;\r\n  to offer the statement into evidence.Â  Petitioner contends the State engaged in\r\n  trickery and abandoned its duty to seek justice by improperly arguing during\r\n  the pre-trial Jackson v. Denno hearing that the statement was\r\n  admissible, when the State never intended to introduce the statement at the\r\n  guilt phase of trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nA PCR applicant bears the burden of establishing he is entitled to\r\n  relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 525 S.E.2d 514 (2000).Â  To\r\n  prove counsel was ineffective, the applicant must show counsel's performance\r\n  was deficient and the deficient performance caused prejudice to the applicant's\r\n  case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  To show\r\n  prejudice, the applicant must show that, but for counsel's errors, there is a\r\n  reasonable probability the result of trial would have been different.Â  Johnson\r\n    v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).Â  A reasonable probability is\r\n  a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.Â  Strickland, supra.\r\n&quot;[I]t is generally recognized that the prosecution and the\r\n  defense should be afforded wide discretion in the selection and presentation of\r\n  evidence.&quot;Â  State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114, 525 S.E.2d 519 (2000)\r\n  (citing State v. Richardson, 253 S.C. 468, 171 S.E.2d 717 (1969).Â  It is\r\n  &quot;unquestionably true as a general matter&quot; that &quot;the prosecution\r\n  is entitled to prove its case by evidence of its own choice . . . .&quot;Â  Old\r\n    Chief v. U.S., 519 U.S. 172 (1997).\r\nTrial counsel testified he assumed the State would try to\r\n  introduce the statement during the guilt phase because the State argued at the Jackson\r\n    v. Denno hearing that the statement was voluntarily given.Â  He\r\n  acknowledged, however, that no one from the prosecution team told him\r\n  affirmatively that the State intended to introduce the statement during the\r\n  guilt phase.\r\nOne solicitor testified the State decided well before trial not to\r\n  present petitioner's statement during the guilt phase because it was contrary\r\n  to what the State sought to prove.Â  The solicitor opined that, without the\r\n  statement, petitioner would have to testify and subject himself to cross-examination\r\n  in order to present his version of the incident in the guilt phase.Â  The State\r\n  therefore moved in limine to bar petitioner from introducing the\r\n  statement when the police officer to whom the statement was made was called as\r\n  a witness during the guilt phase.\r\nAnother solicitor testified the prosecution decided not to use the\r\n  statement in the guilt phase unless petitioner testified.Â  The solicitor also\r\n  stated that even if trial counsel had approached him before opening argument\r\n  and asked whether the State intended to introduce the statement, he would not\r\n  have disclosed that information because whether or when to introduce the\r\n  statement was part of their strategy in trying the case.\r\nWe find there is evidence to support the PCR judge's finding trial\r\n  counsel were not ineffective.Â  Cherry, supra.Â  The State\r\n  requested the Jackson v. Denno hearing to determine the voluntariness of\r\n  the statement for use in the penalty phase and in the event it decided to\r\n  introduce the statement to cross-examine petitioner, should he choose to\r\n  testify.Â  In doing so, the State used the wide discretion it is afforded in the\r\n  selection and presentation of evidence.Â Â  Johnson, supra.Â  The\r\n  solicitors' decision not to present petitioner's statement during its case in\r\n  chief did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct, but was a matter of trial\r\n  strategy.Â  For this reason, we affirm the PCR judge's order.\r\nII.&nbsp; Trial strategy\r\nPetitioner contends trial counsel were ineffective in failing to\r\n  adjust their defense strategy in the guilt phase of trial in order to maintain\r\n  credibility with the jury during sentencing.Â  Specifically, petitioner argues\r\n  trial counsel had a duty, after stating during the opening statement that\r\n  petitioner &quot;confessed,&quot; to adjust their trial strategy and not\r\n  continue to pursue a reasonable doubt defense.Â  We disagree.\r\nAssuming\r\n  trial counsel were deficient in not changing their trial strategy to gain credibility\r\n  with the jury, petitioner has failed to meet his burden of showing he was\r\n  prejudiced.Â  Strickland, supra.Â  Considering the evidence the\r\n  State presented during the guilt phase of trial, petitioner cannot show the\r\n  outcome of the penalty phase would have been different had trial counsel conceded\r\n  petitioner's guilt in the guilt phase.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause there is evidence to support the dismissal of petitioner's\r\n  application for PCR, the order of the PCR judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY, J., and Acting Justice James E.

We reverse and remand for a new trial.[1]\r\nI.\r\nAppellant\r\n  Stivers Automotive of Lexington, Inc. (Stivers) and Respondent South Carolina\r\n  Federal Credit Union (SCFCU) were parties to a Dealer Agreement (Agreement),\r\n  under which SCFCU agreed to purchase sales contracts between Stivers and\r\n  purchasers of its vehicles.Â  Among other provisions in the Agreement, Stivers\r\n  warranted with respect to its sales contracts assigned to SCFCU:\r\n\r\n  (5) the\r\n    Contract is genuine and the statements and amounts inserted therein are\r\n    correct;\r\n  . . . . \r\n  (9) the\r\n    collateral and/or service have been sold, provided and delivered to and\r\n    accepted by buyer;\r\n  . . . . \r\n  (16)\r\n    Dealer has not knowingly communicated to Lender incorrect information relating\r\n    to the buyer's application or credit statement or knowingly failed to\r\n    communicate information relating to such application or credit statement;\r\n  (17) the\r\n    facts set forth in the Contract are true;\r\n  (18)\r\n    buyer has no defense or counterclaim to payment of the obligation evidenced by\r\n    the Contract;\r\n  (19)\r\n    buyer is . . . not a minor and has legal capacity to execute this Contract and\r\n    is liable thereon . . . .\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Agreement also provided that Stivers would be in default &quot;if any warranty,\r\n  representation or statement made or furnished by or on behalf of [Stivers] in\r\n  connection with this Agreement or any Contract purchased by [SCFCU] is false or\r\n  has been breached in any material respect.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  November 2005, Hiram Riley (Riley) sought to purchase a vehicle from Stivers\r\n  but was unable to qualify for financing.Â  Stivers' salesman, Tom Roper (Roper),\r\n  indicated that Riley could get the car if he found a co-signer.Â  Riley\r\n  contacted his sister, Mildred Higgins (Higgins), who agreed to co-sign for the\r\n  car.Â  Upon receiving that information from Riley, Roper contacted Higgins to\r\n  check her credit and prepare the appropriate documents.[2]Â  Roper then visited\r\n  Higgins at her home in Charleston to sign the appropriate paperwork. After\r\n  Roper thoroughly explained the documents, Higgins indicated she understood and\r\n  signed the paperwork.Â  As it turned out,\r\n  the paperwork was drafted so that Higgins was the sole purchaser of the car,\r\n  not a co-signer.Â  \r\nUltimately,\r\n  SCFCU approved the loan to Higgins for the purchase price.Â  Riley picked up the\r\n  vehicle, with the understanding that he was to make the payments.Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, Riley drove the vehicle to Charleston, and Higgins told him that\r\n  she wanted to see &quot;what she signed for.&quot;Â  After viewing the car, she\r\n  and Riley again visited in her home.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  making initial payments, one of Riley's checks bounced.[3]Â  At that point, Riley\r\n  stopped making payments on the car, stopped driving it, and told SCFCU where it\r\n  could recover the car.Â  SCFCU hired an agent to repossess the vehicle, which\r\n  was subsequently sold in July 2006 at an auction.\r\nIn December\r\n  2006, SCFCU filed a complaint against Higgins, given that her name was on the\r\n  loan.Â  Higgins denied the allegations in the complaint, stating that she was\r\n  incompetent at the time of the execution of the contract.Â  Subsequently, SCFCU\r\n  amended its complaint, alleging Stivers breached the Agreement.Â  \r\nA\r\n  jury trial was held in December 2008.Â  At the conclusion of the testimony, the\r\n  trial court granted SCFCU's motion for a directed verdict against Stivers, finding\r\n  Higgins lacked capacity to contract and Stivers breached the Agreement in that\r\n  regard.Â  The trial court's initial order focused solely upon the issue of capacity.Â \r\n  In February 2009, the trial court amended its order, affirming its initial\r\n  order, but adding that Stivers committed &quot;six unequivocal breaches of the\r\n  contract,&quot; including the capacity issue.[4]Â \r\n  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\nII.\r\nStivers\r\n  raises six issues on appeal. \r\n(1) Did the trial\r\n  court err by granting a directed verdict motion on the issue of Higgins'\r\n  capacity?\r\n(2) Did the trial\r\n  court err by concluding Stivers breached other warranties contained in the\r\n  Agreement?\r\n(3) Did the trial\r\n  court err by granting SCFCU's directed verdict motion on the issue of damages?\r\n(4) Did the trial\r\n  court err by concluding Stivers conducted a &quot;straw purchase&quot; in\r\n  violation of the Agreement?\r\n(5) Did the trial\r\n  court abuse its discretion in the amount of attorney's fees it awarded?\r\n(6) Did the trial\r\n  judge abuse his discretion by not removing himself from the case due to alleged\r\n  bias?\r\nWe\r\n  dispose of this appeal on the basis of the first three issues and need not\r\n  reach the remaining issues.\r\nIII.\r\nWhen\r\n  considering a directed verdict motion, the trial court should view the evidence\r\n  and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002) (citing Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing\r\n    &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999)).Â  &quot;If\r\n  more than one reasonable inference can be drawn . . . the case should be\r\n  submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  Chaney v. Burgess, 246 S.C. 261, 266, 143\r\n  S.E.2d 521, 523 (1965) (citing Mahon v. Spartanburg County, 205 S.C. 441,\r\n  449, 32 S.E.2d 368, 371 (1944)).Â  The trial court should be &quot;concerned\r\n  only with the existence or non-existence of evidence,&quot; not its credibility\r\n  or weight.Â  Jones v. General Elec. Co., 331 S.C. 351, 356, 503 S.E.2d\r\n  173, 176 (1998) (citing Garrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 99, 419 S.E.2d\r\n  842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992)).Â  We view the evidence in a light most favorable to\r\n  Stivers, as our standard of review requires.\r\nA.\r\nWe\r\n  find that the trial court erred by directing a verdict against Stivers on the\r\n  issue of capacity.[5]Â \r\n  There was sufficient evidence to submit the issue of capacity to the jury.Â  Riley's\r\n  testimony, if believed, pointed to Higgins' capacity.Â  Riley had contact with\r\n  his sister, Higgins, including interaction with her shortly after the\r\n  transaction.Â  Riley's testimony, as well as Roper's, tended to establish that\r\n  Higgins had capacity to contract.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the testimony of Higgins' physician was less than conclusive as to whether\r\n  Higgins was suffering from dementia at the time the sales contract was\r\n  executed.[6]Â \r\n  Moreover, Higgins maintained a valid driver's\r\n  license and was still driving at the time.Â  She also maintained an open line of\r\n  credit for a home equity loan and a credit card, both of which were current.\r\nThe trial\r\n  court erred by weighing the evidence presented.Â  Garrett, 309 S.C. at\r\n  99, 419 S.E.2d at 845 (stating that the trial court should not be concerned\r\n  with the credibility or weight of evidence, only its existence).Â  The trial\r\n  court stated, &quot;It is not what the car salesman on one brief visit may have\r\n  thought Higgins' condition was, it is what it actually was based on her\r\n  doctor's exams and her husband's experience with her that is important.&quot;Â  That\r\n  statement reflects the trial court's favoring of one party's evidence and\r\n  improper weighing of credibility.Â  There may be a clear basis for the\r\n  fact-finder to reject the testimony of Riley and Roper, but that credibility\r\n  determination lies with the jury, not the court at the directed verdict stage.Â \r\n  We hold the evidence under the proper standard of review presented a question\r\n  of fact as to Higgins' capacity.Â  \r\nB.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We additionally\r\n  hold that the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict to SCFCU as to\r\n  the other warranties contained in the contract, as well as the amount of\r\n  damages due SCFCU.Â  As stated above, the trial court's original order held\r\n  Stivers breached the warranty as to capacity.Â  Following Stivers' motion to\r\n  reconsider, the trial court expanded upon its initial and sole basis for a\r\n  directed verdict by adding that Stivers breached other warranties as well,\r\n  providing only a conclusory discussion and analysis.Â  It is unclear whether the\r\n  trial court's post-trial attempt to expand the directed verdict grounds was in\r\n  recognition of the improper grant of a directed verdict based on Higgins' lack\r\n  of capacity to contract.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  recognize the option to remand the matter for further development of the\r\n  additional warranty issues.Â  We decline a remand limited to the liability issue\r\n  because a new trial is warranted on the issue of damages in any event.Â  The\r\n  vehicle was repossessed only months after the sale.Â  Following repossession of\r\n  the car by SCFCU, it was sold at auction for approximately $9,700, which was\r\n  less than fifty percent of its original sale price. Â We are aware the sale\r\n  price included the finance charges and a sale at auction would bring less.Â  Stivers\r\n  challenged the reasonableness of SCFCU's disposition of the car and presented\r\n  evidence calling into question the commercial reasonableness of SCFCU's actions.Â \r\n  The evidence creates a question of fact on the issue of damages.Â  Because a new\r\n  trial is warranted and given the circumstances in which a directed verdict was\r\n  granted on the liability question, we remand for a new trial on liability and\r\n  damages.[7]Â  \r\nIn light of our\r\n  reversal of the trial court's grant of a directed verdict, we decline to\r\n  address any remaining issues raised by Stivers.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and\r\n  PLEICONES, J., concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in\r\n  a separate opinion in which HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â \r\n  Having reviewed the facts in the light most favorable to Stivers, I would\r\n  affirm the trial judge's granting of a directed verdict on the breach of\r\n  warranty claim; however, I would reverse on the damages issue and remand.\r\nIt is undisputed\r\n  that the collateral was delivered to Riley not Higgins.Â  This violated\r\n  paragraph (9) of the warranties agreement.Â  Roper knew that he had prepared the\r\n  documents to reflect Higgins as the buyer although Riley was the true\r\n  purchaser.Â  This resulted in Higgins being a &quot;straw purchaser,&quot; which\r\n  violated paragraph (9).\r\nIt is also\r\n  undisputed that Roper never informed SCFCU of Riley's involvement in the\r\n  purchase and that the application for credit was actually for Riley and that\r\n  Higgins should have been a co-signer.Â  This arguably caused SCFCU to lower its\r\n  interest rate because Higgins had good credit; it also deprived SCFCU of an\r\n  opportunity to fairly assess the loan's risk.Â  This failure to disclose\r\n  material information violated paragraph (16) of the warranties agreement.\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons I would affirm the directed verdict. I concur in the majority's\r\n  decision to remand the damages issue for further consideration.\r\nHEARN, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â The underlying case involved a claim\r\n  against Mildred R. Higgins.Â \r\n  The original claim by SCFCU against Higgins was dismissed at the conclusion of\r\n  the evidence and that dismissal is not challenged on appeal.Â  While the retrial\r\n  will require the remaining parties to litigate the issue of Higgins' capacity\r\n  as it relates to the Dealer Agreement, Higgins is no longer a party to this\r\n  case. \r\n[2] Higgins' credit report reflected that she\r\n  had good credit, including a home equity line of credit and a credit card, both\r\n  of which were current.Â  \r\n[3] In February 2006, SCFCU discovered the\r\n  vehicle was not insured and included a forced insurance policy on the vehicle,\r\n  essentially doubling the payments.Â  SCFCU purchased the insurance because\r\n  Higgins' insurance (which appeared on the sales contract) did not cover Riley.Â \r\n  It appears that the addition of the insurance to the monthly payment was more\r\n  than Riley could afford. \r\n[4] In its initial order, the trial judge\r\n  referenced his personal experience with family who suffered from dementia.Â  Based\r\n  on this newly disclosed information, coupled with the trial court's handling of\r\n  the trial, Stivers moved for the judge's recusal based on alleged bias.Â  The trial\r\n  court denied the recusal motion.Â  The trial judge also increased the award of\r\n  attorney's fees in the amended order to an amount he essentially acknowledged\r\n  was excessive.\r\n[5] We summarily reject as meritless SCFCU's\r\n  position that Stivers is precluded from challenging the directed verdict\r\n  because Higgins is not a party on appeal.Â  Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.\r\n[6] The evidence from Dr. Little indicated that\r\n  in December of 2006, Higgins was &quot;experiencing some decreased\r\n  memory/secondary to early stage dementia.&quot;Â  Although Dr. Little\r\n  subsequently opined that Higgins' diagnosis was &quot;early stage dementia\r\n  which began early November 2005,&quot; his December 18, 2006, letter concludes\r\n  that Higgins &quot;is not capable of making business decisions â€¦ at this\r\n  time.&quot;Â  The medical evidence may not be viewed as expressing a definitive\r\n  opinion as to Higgins' capacity at the time of the November 2005 transaction. \r\n[7] We do not foreclose upon retrial the\r\n  consideration and grant of a directed verdict, if appropriate.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27035","title":"School District Fairfield v.

Res. 135, 118th Gen. Assem., 1st Reg. Sess. (S.C.\r\n  2010).Â  On March 4, 2010, the Senate voted 1 to 0 to override the Governor's\r\n  veto.Â  S.J. Res. 135, 118th Gen. Assem., 1st Reg. Sess. (S.C. 2010).Â  On that\r\n  day, although a quorum of the Senate was present, only Fairfield County Senator\r\n  Creighton Coleman voted.Â  The 1 to 0 vote was in accordance with a purported\r\n  &quot;long-held precedent in the Senate where members do not vote on\r\n  legislation affecting solely one county, also known as local\r\n  legislation.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 27, 2010, the Board filed a complaint against the State in circuit court\r\n  challenging the constitutionality of Act 308.Â  The circuit court granted the\r\n  Board a temporary restraining order.Â  The General Assembly then moved to\r\n  intervene, after which the Board and the State jointly petitioned this Court to\r\n  take the case in its original jurisdiction.Â  We granted the original\r\n  jurisdiction petition.\r\nII.\r\nArticle IV, section 21 of\r\n  the South Carolina Constitution\r\nArticle\r\n  IV, section 21 of the constitution provides that if the Governor vetoes a bill\r\n  or resolution, the bill or resolution is returned with objections to the\r\n  originating house, and:Â  \r\nIf after\r\n  such reconsideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass it,\r\n  it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it\r\n  shall be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that house it\r\n  shall have the same effect as if it had been signed by the Governor.\r\nS.C. Const. art. IV, Â§ 21\r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  question before the Court is: what does the constitutional mandate\r\n  &quot;two-thirds of that house shall agree&quot; mean?Â  This Court's precedent\r\n  and a plain reading of this unambiguous constitutional provision combine to\r\n  compel a construction that the two-thirds requirement means two-thirds of a\r\n  quorum &quot;shall agree.&quot;Â  Indeed, that has been the General Assembly's\r\n  longstanding understanding and application of its veto override authority,\r\n  until relatively recently.\r\nA.\r\nWe begin\r\n  with the acknowledgement that absent a constitutional mandate providing\r\n  otherwise, each house in the General Assembly determines its rules of procedure\r\n  free from interference from the judicial and executive branches. S.C. Const.\r\n  art. III, Â§ 12.Â  We further note the premise that, absent a constitutional\r\n  provision to the contrary, the legislature acts and conducts business through\r\n  majority vote.Â  The South Carolina Constitution provides &quot;a majority of\r\n  each house shall constitute a quorum to do business . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Const. art.\r\n  III, Â§ 11.Â  Yet, the people of South Carolina, through their constitution, have\r\n  established certain areas that require a supermajority of the legislature to\r\n  act.Â  The constitutional grant of legislative authority to override a\r\n  governor's veto is one such example.Â  See also S.C. Const. art. XV, Â§ 1\r\n  (&quot;The affirmative vote of two-thirds of all [Representatives] elected\r\n  shall be required for an impeachment.&quot;); art. XV, Â§ 2 (&quot;No person\r\n  shall be convicted except by a vote of two-thirds of all [Senators]\r\n  elected.&quot;); art. XVI, Â§ 1 (requiring two-thirds &quot;of the members\r\n  elected to each House&quot; to approve a constitutional amendment); art. XVI, Â§\r\n  3 (requiring &quot;two-thirds of the members elected to each branch of the\r\n  General Assembly&quot; to call a constitutional convention).\r\nIn Smith\r\n  v. Jennings, 67 S.C. 324, 45 S.E. 821 (1903), this Court considered the\r\n  meaning of the legislature's constitutional veto override authority juxtaposed to\r\n  other constitutional provisions requiring a supermajority:\r\n\r\n  While\r\n    the Constitution, in article 3, Â§ 3, declares that the House of Representatives\r\n    shall consist of 124 members, it also declares, in section 11, art. 3, that a\r\n    majority of each house shall constitute a quorum to do business.Â  A quorum,\r\n    therefore, possesses the power of the whole body in all matters of business\r\n    wherein the action of a larger proportion of the entire membership is not\r\n    clearly and expressly required. So, ordinarily, when a quorum is present\r\n    acting, the House is present, acting in all its potentiality.Â  When the\r\n    Constitution speaks of &quot;two-thirds of that house&quot; as the vote\r\n    required to pass a bill or joint resolution over the veto of the Governor, it\r\n    means two-thirds of the house as then legally constituted, and acting upon the\r\n    matter.Â  Whenever the framers of the Constitution intended otherwise, the\r\n    purpose was expressly declared, as in article 15, Â§ 1, &quot;a vote of\r\n    two-thirds of all members elected shall be required for an impeachment,&quot;\r\n    and in article 16, Â§ 1, where, in proposing amendments to the Constitution,\r\n    &quot;two-thirds of the members elected to each house&quot; must agree\r\n    thereto.Â  Questions like this arose under the Constitution of 1868, and were\r\n    decided in accordance with the view we take.Â  Morton, Bliss &amp; Co. v.\r\n      Comptroller General, 4 S.C. 462; Bond Debt Cases, 12 S.C. 285.Â  See also, Cooley's Constitutional Limitations (5th ed.) p. 170; State v.\r\n        McBride, 4 Mo. 303, 29 Am. Dec. 636.Â  As the house at the time of the\r\n    passage of the joint resolution was lawfully constituted, with 85 members\r\n    present, and, as 60 of these voted for its passage, the vote was\r\n    &quot;two-thirds of that house,&quot; in the sense of section [21], art. 4, of\r\n    the Constitution.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 328-329, 45 S.E. at 823.Â  \r\n\r\nWe\r\n  interpret Smith v. Jennings to manifestly require two-thirds of a quorum\r\n  to override a governor's veto.[1]Â  We find further support\r\n  for our view in the authorities favorably cited in Smith v. Jennings,\r\n  including Morton, Bliss &amp; Co. v. Comptroller General, 4 S.C. 430\r\n  (1873).Â  In Morton, Bliss, we were asked to determine, in the context of\r\n  bills creating public debt, whether the constitution required &quot;two-thirds\r\n  of a quorum of each House, or â€¦ two-thirds of the whole membership of each\r\n  House.&quot;Â  Id. at 462.Â  The Court emphasized that a quorum is\r\n  authorized to act in the name of the body[2] and &quot;if the rule is\r\n  that of two-thirds, then two-thirds of such quorum must concur for effective\r\n    action.&quot;Â  Id. at 463 (emphasis added).Â  The Court concluded\r\n  &quot;that a vote of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote\r\n    was taken satisfies the requirements of the Constitution.&quot;Â  Id. at 467 (emphasis added).\r\nCooley\r\n  on Constitutional Limitations,\r\n  referenced in Morton, Bliss, correctly states the rule in light\r\n  of the unambiguous language in article IV, section 21:\r\n\r\n  For the\r\n    vote required in the passage of any particular law the reader is referred to\r\n    the constitution of his State.Â  A simple majority of a quorum is sufficient,\r\n    unless the constitution establishes some other rule; and where, by the\r\n      constitution, a two-thirds or three-fourths vote is made essential to the\r\n      passage of any particular class of bills, two-thirds or three-fourths of a\r\n      quorum will be understood, unless the terms employed clearly indicate that\r\n    this proportion of all the members, or of all those elected, is intended.\r\n\r\nThomas M. Cooley, A\r\n  Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations Which Rest Upon the Legislative\r\n  Power of the States of the American Union 169-70 (5th ed. 1883) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nB.\r\nWe\r\n  are further persuaded that the constitutional two-thirds voting requirement\r\n  demands that we reject the General Assembly's view that it lawfully overrides a\r\n  governor's veto with a vote of 1 to 0 when a quorum is present.Â  The constitution\r\n  allows the legislative branch to override the executive branchâ€”but that\r\n  legislative power is limited and circumscribed by the heightened vote\r\n  requirement.[3]Â  We described the\r\n  significantly important check and balance inherent in the two-thirds\r\n  requirement in Morton, Bliss:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    object of this provision was to create a check, operating directly on the\r\n    respective Houses of the General Assembly, tending to limit the exercise of the\r\n    power of creating public debt to cases where its expediency was determined as\r\n    the result of a clear and solid judgment of the legislative body.Â  Experience\r\n    had shown that a mere majority does not necessarily express a conviction of\r\n    that nature, but often depends on a mere accident, that, according to its\r\n    occurrence, at one time or another, may reverse the conclusions of the\r\n    deliberating body . . . . These considerations have led to constitutional\r\n    provisions requiring, in certain cases, that a greater number than a mere\r\n    majority should unite where acts of a certain class of a more important\r\n    character than the ordinary subjects of legislation are involved.\r\n\r\nMorton,\r\n  Bliss, 4 S.C. at 462-63.Â  \r\nC.\r\nPlaintiff\r\n  has provided research detailing well over one thousand veto override votes by\r\n  one or both houses since our decision in Smith v. Jennings.Â  For\r\n  generations, the General Assembly followed Smith v. Jennings and the clear\r\n  constitutional requirementâ€”two-thirds of a house in article IV, section 21 means\r\n  two-thirds of the quorum.Â  The data shows that beginning in 1980, the House of\r\n  Representatives began the practice of overriding local bills with less than\r\n  two-thirds of a quorum.Â  It appears that practice became customary in the House\r\n  of Representatives by the mid-1980s.\r\nThe\r\n  data further reveals that in the 104 years following Smith v. Jennings,\r\n  the Senate never declared any bill, statewide or local, to be overridden with\r\n  less than two-thirds of a quorum, except for once in 1989 and once in 2006.Â \r\n  Beginning in 2008, the Senate changed its posture and the vast majority of\r\n  local bills passed as overrides were enacted without obtaining the vote of\r\n  two-thirds the quorum.Â  We conclude that what the General Assembly contends is\r\n  a &quot;long-held precedent in the Senateâ€ is not as rooted as the General\r\n  Assembly represents.[4]\r\nIn\r\n  support of their defense of the veto override, the State and General Assembly offer\r\n  parliamentary manuals, Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure and Jefferson's Manual of Parliamentary Practice, which generally construe the quorum\r\n  requirement in terms of &quot;present and voting.&quot;Â  The ability of the\r\n  General Assembly to determine its procedural rules, however, is constrained\r\n  where the constitution mandates a particular procedure.Â  The parliamentary\r\n  manuals cited by the State and General Assembly are replete with the\r\n  recognition that their general rules may apply &quot;in the absence of a\r\n  contrary provision.&quot;Â  See, e.g., Mason's Manual of Legislative\r\n    Procedure Â§ 503.3 (&quot;Under the generally accepted rules of\r\n  parliamentary procedure in the absence of a contrary provision . . . .); Mason's Â§ 512.3 (a two-thirds vote requirement &quot;unless otherwise\r\n    specified, means two-thirds of the legal votes cast, not two-thirds of the\r\n  members present . . . . &quot;) (emphasis added).Â  We observe that\r\n  article IV, section 21 of the constitution specifies otherwise.Â  In short,\r\n  these parliamentary authorities cannot be invoked to trump a constitutional\r\n  provision.[5]Â  \r\nII.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, the two-thirds mandate in article IV, section 21 of the South Carolina Constitution\r\n  requires two-thirds of a quorum.Â  Assuming full membership, the minimum quorum\r\n  in the House of Representatives is 63 and the minimum quorum in the Senate is\r\n  24; two-thirds of those numbers would be 42 Representatives and 16 Senators,\r\n  respectively.Â  Here, a quorum was present in each house.Â  We hold the veto\r\n  override votes of 33 to 10 in the House of Representatives and 1 to 0 in the\r\n  Senate fell short of the constitutionally mandated two-thirds requirement.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we hold the Governor's veto of H. 4431 was sustained and enter judgment for\r\n  Plaintiff.Â  Having rendered judgment for Plaintiff, the Court need not reach\r\n  the Article III, section 34 special legislation challenge.\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n  FOR PLAINTIFF.\r\nPLEICONES and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in a separate opinion. TOAL, C.J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â \r\n  I concur with the majority; however, I write separately to express my view that\r\n  Act 308 is also unconstitutional special legislation beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.Â  Article III, Section 34 of the South Carolina Constitution prohibits\r\n  special laws where general laws can be made applicable.Â  There is no evidence\r\n  in the record of this case that distinguishes The Board of Trustees of the\r\n  School District of Fairfield County from the majority of school district\r\n  governing bodies in this state; all are susceptible to fiscal mismanagement.Â  \r\nFurther, Act 308\r\n  clearly conflicts with provisions of Title 59 of the South Carolina Code which\r\n  grant authority to boards of trustees to manage and control school districts.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-19-10 (2004). Budget making authority is inherent in\r\n  the board of trustees' management and control mandate.Â  Moreover, Title 59\r\n  specifically authorizes school trustees to set the salaries of teachers (Â§\r\n  59-19-90(2)), charge fees (Â§ 59-19-90(8)), sell or lease property (Â§\r\n  59-19-250), and purchase land (Â§ 59-19-180).Â  These powers are manifestations\r\n  of the Legislature's intent that school boards of trustees manage the finances\r\n  of school districts.Â  Act 308 is in direct conflict with general law and is\r\n  therefore unconstitutional.Â  See Henry v. Horry County, 334 S.C.\r\n  461, 514 S.E.2d, 122 (1999).[6]\r\nAllegations of\r\n  fiscal ineptness and mismanagement by school boards are plentiful throughout\r\n  this state.Â  Assuming that Act 308 is efficacious, its tenets could prove\r\n  beneficial to the entire state, not just Fairfield County.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Respectfully, I dissent.Â  In my opinion, the General Assembly\r\n  effectively overrode the gubernatorial veto of Act 308.Â  Accordingly, I would\r\n  reach the merits of the Board's second constitutional challenge and find Act\r\n  308 is constitutional special legislation.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I.&nbsp;The Veto Override \r\nI\r\n  agree with the majority's acknowledgement that &quot;absent a constitutional\r\n  mandate providing otherwise, each house in the General Assembly determines its\r\n  rules of procedure free from interference with judicial and executive\r\n  branches.&quot;Â  However, I disagree with the majority's determination that our\r\n  constitution provides otherwise.Â  The majority reads Article IV, section 21 of\r\n  the South Carolina Constitution to require the affirmative vote of two-thirds\r\n  of a full quorum to override a gubernatorial veto, rather than abiding by our\r\n  long-standing precedent requiring the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the\r\n  membership present and acting upon the matter, so long as a quorum is\r\n  present to conduct business.Â  The majority's approach focuses on the number of\r\n  affirmative votes cast, rather than the ratio of votes constitutionally\r\n  required.Â  For instance, two-thirds of a quorum of the House equals 42 members.Â Â \r\n  Under the majority's holding, a vote of 42-0 in the House is sufficient to\r\n  override a governor's veto, as long as a quorum of the House is present.Â  However,\r\n  a vote of 41-1 would be insufficient to override a veto because the number of\r\n  affirmative votes does not equal two-thirds of the full quorum.Â  A vote of 41-1\r\n  is a ratio that far exceeds two-thirds of the votes cast.Â  In my view, this is\r\n  contrary to the plain language of our constitution and contrary to our opinions\r\n  thus far interpreting constitutional vote requirements.\r\nThe concept that a\r\n  vote ratio prescribed by our constitution applies only to those members voting\r\n  in the presence of a quorum dates back to 1873.Â  In Morton, Bliss &amp; Co.\r\n    v. Comptroller General, we stated, &quot;If the rule is the mere majority\r\n  rule, then a majority of the quorum present and acting is intended; if\r\n  the rule is that of two-thirds, then two thirds of such quorum [present and\r\n  acting] must concur for effective action.&quot;Â  4 S.C. 430, 463 (1873)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  This Court specifically applied this concept to the\r\n  constitutional provision at issue in this case in Smith v. Jennings.Â  In\r\n  that case, the Court determined &quot;[w]hen the Constitution speaks of\r\n  'two-thirds of that house' as the vote required to pass a bill or joint\r\n  resolution over the veto of the governor, it means two-thirds of the house as\r\n  then legally constituted and acting upon the matter.&quot;Â  Smith v.\r\n    Jennings, 67 S.C. 324, 328, 45 S.E. 821, 823 (1903) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nThe General\r\n  Assembly has since relied upon our holdings in Morton, Bliss and Smith\r\n    v. Jennings when establishing its rules.Â  While debating a concurrent\r\n  resolution in 1984, a point of order was raised concerning the amount of votes\r\n  required to pass the resolution. Â H.R. Con. Res. 3947, 106th Gen. Assem., 1st\r\n  Reg. Sess. (S.C. 1984).Â  It was urged that the House adopt the Smith veto override standard that two-thirds of the house means &quot;two-thirds vote\r\n  of those present and voting, a quorum being present.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Following a discussion on the matter, the Speaker of the House of\r\n  Representatives ruled that &quot;it takes two-thirds of those present and\r\n  voting to adopt a Resolution.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Along these same lines, the\r\n  current Rules of the Senate and Rules of the House provide that a veto may be\r\n  overridden by a two-thirds vote of the members present and voting.Â  Rules of\r\n  the Senate of South Carolina 50 (2009); Rules of the House of Representatives\r\n  10.3 (2010-11).Â  \r\nThis Court's\r\n  precedent combines with parliamentary authority to solidify the concept that\r\n  legislation may be passed as long as a quorum is present and those voting meet\r\n  the constitutionally prescribed ratio of votes required.Â  Mason's Manual of\r\n    Legislative Procedure, the preferred parliamentary authority of the South\r\n  Carolina House of Representatives, states &quot;[t]he requirement of a\r\n  two-thirds vote, unless otherwise specified, means two-thirds of the legal\r\n  votes cast, not two-thirds of the members present, or two-thirds of all the\r\n  members.&quot;Â  Mason's Â§ 512.3 (2000).Â  The majority quotes this\r\n  authority, but finds that our constitution specifies otherwise.Â  In my view,\r\n  the only means of finding a different specification in our constitution is to\r\n  ignore the constitutional interpretation provided in Morton and Smith\r\n    v. Jennings, which focuses on those voters acting upon the matter rather\r\n  than the threshold number of votes required.Â  \r\nThe parliamentary\r\n  rules of the United States Congress additionally support the General Assembly's\r\n  &quot;voting and present&quot; requirement.Â  The preferred parliamentary manual\r\n  of the South Carolina Senate is an amalgamated version of the United States\r\n  Constitution and Jefferson's Manual of Parliamentary Practice, which\r\n  contains commentary on the provisions of these documents written by the United\r\n  States Congress.Â  The Senate of South Carolina, Constitution of the United\r\n  States and Jefferson's Manual (1989) (unpublished pamphlet, on file with the\r\n  South Carolina Senate).Â  In this document, the commentary of Article I, section\r\n  5 of the United States Constitution[7] recounts events that took\r\n  place in the late nineteenth century that &quot;established the principle that\r\n  a quorum present made valid any action by the House, although an actual quorum\r\n  might not vote.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 54.Â  The United States Supreme Court\r\n  sustained that principle in United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 12 S.\r\n  Ct. 507 (1892).Â  \r\nÂ \r\n  For over a century, the General Assembly has relied upon our interpretation of\r\n  Article IV, section 21 and the common standards of parliamentary procedure when\r\n  voting on bills and joint resolutions.Â  The doctrine of &quot;[s]tare\r\n    decisis exists to 'insure a quality of justice which results from certainty\r\n  and stability.'&quot; State v. One Coin-Operated Video Game Mach., 321\r\n  S.C. 176, 181, 467 S.E.2d 443, 446&nbsp;(1996) (quoting McCall v. Batson,\r\n  285 S.C. 243, 256, 329 S.E.2d 741, 747 (1985) (Chandler, J., concurring)).Â \r\n  Therefore, in the interest of promoting the stability of existing laws, and\r\n  with recognition that the execution of parliamentary procedure is generally\r\n  within the purview of the legislature, I would find that when a quorum of the\r\n  voting body is present, it is equipped to conduct business, and as such, the\r\n  General Assembly effectively overrides a gubernatorial veto when two-thirds of\r\n  the votes cast affirm the passage of that bill.Â  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II.&nbsp; Special Legislation\r\nBecause\r\n  I believe the General Assembly validly passed Act 308, I find it necessary to\r\n  reach the Board's second constitutional challenge.Â  The Board argues that Act\r\n  308 is unconstitutional under Article III, section 34(IX) of the South Carolina\r\n  Constitution because it is a special, or local, law that conflicts with the\r\n  general law; or alternatively, that it is a special law where a general law can\r\n  be made applicable.Â  I do not believe that Act 308 conflicts with an existing general\r\n  law.Â  Further, in my view, the history of special legislation addressing the\r\n  manner and means of school district budget preparation in individual counties\r\n  precludes a finding that a general law could be made applicable statewide.\r\n  Therefore, I would find that Act 308 complies with Article III, section 34(IX)\r\n  of the South Carolina Constitution, and is wholly constitutional.Â Â  \r\nArticle\r\n  III, section 34 of the South Carolina Constitution prohibits the General\r\n  Assembly from enacting local laws in several enumerated instances.Â  Of note in\r\n  this case, subsection IX of that section restricts the passage of local laws\r\n  &quot;where a general law can be made applicable.&quot; S.C. Const. art. III, Â§\r\n  34(IX).Â  This provision not only prevents the enactment of special legislation\r\n  where a general law is already applicable, but also where an applicable general\r\n  law may be created. Â Horry County v. Horry County Higher Educ. Com'n,\r\n  306 S.C. 416, 418, 412 S.E.2d 421, 423 (1991) (citations omitted). Â The\r\n  purpose of restricting local or special legislation is to promote uniformity in\r\n  the laws of the state where possible, and to &quot;avoid duplicative or\r\n  conflicting laws on the same subject.&quot;Â  Med. Soc'y of S.C. v. Med.\r\n    Univ. of S.C., 334 S.C. 270, 279, 513 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1999).Â  Also\r\n  pertinent to this issue, subsection X of Article III, section 34 states that\r\n  &quot;nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the General Assembly\r\n  from enacting special provisions in general laws.&quot;Â  S.C. Const. art. III,\r\n  Â§ 34(X).Â Â Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court is deferential to the General Assembly when determining the\r\n  constitutionality of a local law and will not declare that law unconstitutional\r\n  &quot;unless its repugnance to the Constitution is clear beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt,&quot; Â Med. Soc'y of S.C., 334 S.C. at 279, 513 S.E.2d at\r\n  357, or &quot;there has been a clear and palpable abuse of legislative\r\n  discretion.&quot; Â Sirrine v. State, 132 S.C. 241, 248, 128 S.E. 172,\r\n  174 (1925), overruled on other grounds, McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243,\r\n  329 S.E.2d 741 (1985).Â  Even greater deference is afforded the General Assembly\r\n  when evaluating local laws relating to school matters.Â  See McElveen v.\r\n    Stokes, 240 S.C. 1, 10, 124 S.E.2d 592, 596 (1962).Â  When local legislation\r\n  involves public education, the constitutional restriction on the enactment of\r\n  local laws must be viewed in light of the General Assembly's Article XI duty to\r\n  &quot;provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free public\r\n  schools open to all children in the State . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Const. art. XI,\r\n  section 3; McElveen, 240 S.C. at 10, 124 S.E.2d at 596.Â  In McElveen\r\n    v. Stokes, this Court summarized this jurisprudence as follows:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    determining whether a statute pertaining to school matters is obnoxious to\r\n    subsection IX of Section 34, Article III, it is well settled that this\r\n    subsection must be construed in connection with the applicable provisions of\r\n    Article XI, which deal with education and various school matters.Â  It is clear\r\n    from a study of these cases and the constitutional provisions that the scope of\r\n    the legislative power is much broader in dealing with school matters than is\r\n    the scope in dealing with various other subjects.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Accordingly, this Court traditionally sustains local\r\n  laws relating to the state's public education system.Â  Bradley v. Cherokee\r\n    Sch. Dist., 322 S.C. 181, 470 S.E.2d 570 (1996); Smythe v. Stroman,\r\n  251 S.C. 277, 289, 162 S.E.2d 168, 173 (1968); Moseley v. Welch, 209\r\n  S.C. 19, 33, 39 S.E.2d 133, 140 (1946); Walker v. Bennett, 125 S.C. 389,\r\n  118 S.E. 779 (1923).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  constitutional prohibition against local laws not only includes local laws that\r\n  conflict with an existing general law, but also local laws that are passed when\r\n  a general law could be made applicable.Â  Horry County, 306 S.C. at 418,\r\n  412 S.E.2d at 423.Â  Therefore, to arrive at whether a general law could be made\r\n  applicable, this Court has stated:\r\n\r\n  There\r\n    must . . . be a substantial distinction having reference to the subject matter\r\n    of the proposed legislation, between the objects or places embraced in such\r\n    legislation and the objects and places excluded. The marks of distinction upon\r\n    which the classification is founded must be such, in the nature of things, as\r\n    will in some reasonable degree, at least, account for or justify the\r\n    restriction of the legislation. \r\n\r\nId.Â  Thus, &quot;the General Assembly must have a\r\n  'logical basis and sound reason' for resorting to special legislation.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Gillespie v. Pickens County, 197 S.C. 217, 14 S.E.2d 900\r\n  (1941)).Â  \r\n\r\n  A. Whether Act 308 is a\r\n    Special Provision in a General Law\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  State and General Assembly first argue that Act 308 is a special provision in a\r\n  general law, acceptable under subsection X of Article III, section 34.[8]Â \r\n  Therefore, they argue, Act 308 is not subject to the prohibition against local\r\n  laws where general laws can be made applicable found in subsection IX of\r\n  Article III, section 34.Â  I disagree.\r\nLocal\r\n  laws and general laws are distinctly different session laws and are treated as\r\n  such in the Statutes at Large published each year.Â  The Statutes at Large, a\r\n  publication of the Acts and Joint Resolutions passed by the General Assembly\r\n  during a calendar year, is divided into two parts.Â  The first part contains general\r\n  and permanent laws that will ultimately be codified in the South Carolina\r\n  Code.Â  The second part contains local and temporary laws which are not\r\n  codified, but are executed as session laws.Â  It is my opinion that where the\r\n  constitution states &quot;nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the\r\n  General Assembly from enacting special provisions in general laws,&quot; S.C.\r\n  Const. art. III, Â§ 34(X), it is referring to special provisions that are\r\n  contained within the codified general law.Â  These special provisions may make a\r\n  general lawâ€™s effect different in certain counties, but they may not exempt a\r\n  county from the general lawâ€™s entire operation.Â  Horry County, 306 S.C.\r\n  at 419, 412 S.E.2d at 423.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Act 308 cannot be fairly construed as a special provision in a general law.Â \r\n  The General Assembly passed Act 308 as an amendment to a local law relating to\r\n  the manner of selection of the Board of Trustees of the Fairfield County School\r\n  District.Â  It will not be codified in Title 59 of the South Carolina Code as\r\n  will other acts and resolutions involving education.Â  If this Court found that\r\n  acts passed as local laws can be considered special provisions in general laws,\r\n  subsection X of Article III, section 34 would be left with few limitations.Â \r\n  Such a reading would permit subsection X to essentially swallow subsection IX's\r\n  prohibition on local laws where general laws can be made applicable.Â  I do not\r\n  believe this to be the intention of the constitutionâ€™s drafters, and therefore,\r\n  I believe Act 308 should be analyzed under the constraints of Article III,\r\n  section 34(IX).\r\n\r\n  B. Whether Act 308 Directly\r\n    Conflicts with a General Law\r\n\r\nThis Court has on two occasions invalidated a local\r\n  law involving county school districts because of a conflict with existing\r\n  general law.Â  In Smythe v. Stroman, a provision in the act at issue\r\n  provided that a newly consolidated school district would not assume the bonded\r\n  indebtedness of its original school districts.Â  251 S.C. at 282, 162 S.E.2d at\r\n  170.Â  The general law required that when school districts are consolidated, the\r\n  consolidated district shall take on the liabilities of the original districts.Â  Id.Â  Finding that provision to be in direct conflict with the general\r\n  law, this Court struck the provision from the act, while upholding the remainder\r\n  of the act as a special provision in a general law under subsection X of\r\n  Article III, section 34.Â  Id. at 289, 162 S.E.2d at 173.Â Â Â  \r\nIn Kearse\r\n  v. Lancaster, a school district had been previously created by\r\n  consolidating the Olar and the Three-Mile districts.Â  172 S.C. 59, 61, 172 S.E.\r\n  767, 768 (1934).Â  The Three-Mile district wished to withdraw from the\r\n  consolidated district and re-establish itself as it formerly existed.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The act at issue allowed only those residing in the Three-Mile district to vote\r\n  in an election to determine the question of whether it should be withdrawn from\r\n  the consolidated district.Â  Id.Â  This Court found that the local law\r\n  conflicted with the general law that addressed school incorporation, and as such,\r\n  the act violated subsection IX of Article III, section 34.Â  Id. at 63,\r\n  172 S.E. at 769.\r\nÂ In\r\n  my opinion, the South Carolina Code does not include a general law that\r\n  explicitly vests budget-making authority with a school district's board of\r\n  trustees.Â  The Board cites to several provisions within Title 59 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code to support its contention there is a direct conflict between Act\r\n  308 and the general law.Â  Of note, section 59-19-10 provides that &quot;[e]ach\r\n  school district shall be under the management and control of the board of\r\n  trustees . . . .&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-19-10 (2004).Â  Act 308 vests sole\r\n  budget-making authority with a finance committee and requires its approval for\r\n  a list of enumerated expenses.Â  H. 4431, Act 308 of S.C. Acts 2010.Â  Outside of\r\n  this function, however, the ability to execute the budget provisions made by\r\n  the finance committee and the duty to establish the policy of the school\r\n  district remains with the Board.Â  Id.Â  Act 308 does not affect the\r\n  Board's ability to promulgate rules and regulations regarding standards of\r\n  achievement or conduct within the district, to call meetings, or generally, to\r\n  control the educational interests of the district.Â  Therefore, I do not believe\r\n  Act 308 squarely conflicts with section 59-19-10 of the Code.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  general law also provides that school trustees have the power to manage and\r\n  control school property, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-19-90(5) (2004), to provide\r\n  suitable school houses,Â  Id. Â§ 59-19-90(1), and to purchase, rent, and\r\n  lease supplies and equipment necessary for the operation of the public schools\r\n  of the district, Id. Â§ 59-19-130.Â Â  Again, Act 308 does not conflict\r\n  with any of these laws because under the act, the finance committee is charged\r\n  only with preparing the annual budget and approving any fiscally related\r\n  activity of the district.Â  The Board continues to be the body that acquires the\r\n  goods necessary for the upkeep and operation of its schools.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Board has not directed this Court to a provision in the Code that explicitly\r\n  grants a board of trustees the budget-making power that Act 308 has now taken\r\n  away.Â  For the reasons stated above, I do not believe that Act 308 conflicts\r\n  with an existing general law.Â  \r\n\r\n  C. Whether a General Law Can\r\n    be Made Applicable\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  determining whether a general law could be fashioned to standardize school\r\n  district budget-making statewide, this Court's decision in Moseley v. Welch is instructive on both points of fact and law. 209 S.C. 19, 24, 39 S.E.2d 133,\r\n  135 (1946).Â  In that case, plaintiffs sought to have declared invalid an act\r\n  that would abolish the Williamsburg County Board of Education, replacing it\r\n  with a new board consisting of seven members to be appointed by the governor\r\n  upon the recommendation of the local delegation from that county.Â  Id. at 24, 39 S.E.2d at 136.Â  In pertinent part, the act empowered the new\r\n  board with the final authority to approve budgets submitted by trustees in the\r\n  individual districts within the county, to set teacher salaries, to borrow\r\n  funds, and to order the construction and repair of buildings.Â  Id. at\r\n  25, 39 S.E.2d at 136.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  that case, it was urged that the act was a special law where a general law\r\n  could be made applicable.Â  Id. at 27, 39 S.E.2d at 137.Â  This Court\r\n  explained that the chapter in the 1942 South Carolina Code containing general\r\n  school law was followed by a chapter containing special legislation relating\r\n  mostly to the fiscal affairs of the schools in each of the forty-six counties\r\n  in the state.Â  Id.Â Â Â  This Court recognized that the General Assembly's\r\n  opinion that &quot;conditions in the various counties . . . preclude uniformity\r\n  of treatment in relation to the administration of school affairs . . . . is\r\n  entitled to much respect and in doubtful cases should be followed.&quot;Â  Id. at 27-28, 39 S.E.2d at 137.Â  The Court further observed that, although public\r\n  education is a matter of general concern across the state, the act in question\r\n  only related to the fiscal operation of the schools, and did not invade the\r\n  general field of education.Â  Id. at 30, 39 S.E.2d at 138.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the act did not \r\n\r\n  regulate\r\n    the textbooks to be used or the subjects to be taught . . . , the\r\n    qualifications of teachers or the manner in which they shall be elected, school\r\n    attendance or enrollment of pupils, the length of the school term, or various\r\n    other matters pertaining to the general field of education.Â  The general law\r\n    regulating all these subject areas is left undisturbed.\r\n\r\nId.Â  This Court ultimately found the act was\r\n  constitutional as a special provision in a general law.Â  Id. at 28-29,\r\n  39 S.E.2d at 138.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  General Assembly, which has been granted wide authority to legislate the field\r\n  of education, has chosen not to enact a law that explicitly vests budget-making\r\n  authority with district boards of trustees.Â  Because the general law is silent\r\n  on the matter, local legislation in several counties specifically grants this\r\n  authority to a district's board of trustees.Â  See, e.g., H. 3655, Act\r\n  578 of S.C. Acts 1984 (&quot;In addition to the powers and duties of the board\r\n  of trustees of the School District of Calhoun County provided by the law, the\r\n  board shall prepare and adopt the budget for the operation of the district . .\r\n  . .&quot;); H. 3069, Act 268 of S.C. Acts 1977 (&quot;The county board of\r\n  education (board) shall be granted all of the powers and charged with all of\r\n  the duties otherwise provided by law and shall have executive, financial and\r\n  administrative control of the public schools in the school district . . .\r\n  .&quot;). \r\nSince\r\n  this Courtâ€™s holding in Moseley, the manner in which school district budgets\r\n  are formulated and approved continues to vary county by county.Â  For instance,\r\n  in Aiken County, the board of trustees has the authority to prepare the annual\r\n  budget; however, if the proposed budget exceeds the budget of the previous\r\n  year, the Aiken County Legislative Delegation must approve it.Â  H. 3069, Act\r\n  268 of S.C. Acts 1977.Â  In Anderson County, the board of trustees of\r\n  each district prepares the annual budget and then recommends to the Anderson\r\n  County Board of Education the amount of tax millage, H. 3589, Act 96 of S.C.\r\n  Acts 2009, while in Orangeburg County, the board of trustees directly notifies\r\n  the county auditor of the tax levy needed, H. 2788, Act 245 of S.C. Acts 1983.Â \r\n  In Horry County, the budget may be prepared by the board of trustees,\r\n  superintendents, or principals of the several schools, who are then to\r\n  submit the prepared budgets to the county board of education.Â  S.492, Act 239\r\n  of S.C. Acts 1983 (emphasis added).Â  Thus, by passing local laws in this area\r\n  instead of enacting a general law that standardizes the school district\r\n  budget-making process, the General Assembly has signaled its belief that a\r\n  tailored approach best meets the needs of the varied districts within our\r\n  state.\r\nIn\r\n  recognition of the General Assembly's constitutional duty to provide for the\r\n  maintenance and support of a public school system, I believe the following\r\n  statement in Moseley aptly states my opinion on this issue: &quot;[i]t\r\n  is exceedingly doubtful whether a general law, uniform in operation throughout\r\n  the State, regulating . . . the extent of the control which should be vested in\r\n  the county boards of education, could be made applicable.&quot;Â  Moseley,\r\n  209 S.C. at 28, 39 S.E.2d at 138.Â  I would find Act 308 is sustainable under\r\n  Article III, section 34(IX).Â  Therefore, I would enter judgment for the\r\n  Defendants and Defendant-Intervenors. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] That requirement was met in Smith v. Jennings,\r\n  as a quorum was present with 85 House members and 60 of those &quot;voted for\r\n  its passage.&quot;Â  Id. at 329, 45 S.E. at 823.Â  \r\n[2] The full quorum discussion inÂ  Morton,\r\n  Bliss is as follows:\r\n\r\n  [O]ur\r\n    Constitution fixes the quorum competent to transact business on a numerical\r\n    basis.Â  A majority of each House is competent to transact all business not\r\n    embraced in certain special provisions requiring for action the concurrence of\r\n    a greater number of votes than the number required to constitute such quorum.\r\n    [citation omitted] A quorum is, then, when competent to act for all legal\r\n    interests and purposes, the 'Senate,' or the 'House,' as the case may be; and\r\n    whatever authority is conferred on the bodies designated by such names, or upon\r\n    the General Assembly as a whole, must be regarded as fully vested, for all\r\n    actual purposes, in the quorum thus constituted . . . . It would follow that\r\n    provisions ascertaining the mode in which the body should divide, in order to\r\n    complete action in any given case, whether by a mere majority or by a still\r\n    greater proportion, must be interpreted primarily as applicable to the body as\r\n    legally organized at the time such action is taken.Â  If the rule is the mere\r\n    majority rule, then a majority of the quorum present and acting is intended; if\r\n    the rule is that of two-thirds, then two-thirds of such quorum must concur for\r\n    effective action.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 463. \r\n[3] See also James L. Underwood, The\r\n  Constitution of South Carolina, Volume 1: The Relationship of the Legislative, Executive,\r\n  and Judicial Branches 86 (1986) (stating the executive veto serves as a\r\n  check and balance against the General Assembly's plenary power).Â  \r\n[4] Similarly, the dissent's efforts to support\r\n  the 1 to 0 veto override fall short.Â  The dissent posits that the General\r\n  Assembly has been &quot;voting on bills and joint resolutions&quot; in reliance\r\n  on our precedent &quot;for over a century.&quot;Â  We agree.Â  As established\r\n  above, the General Assembly for generations followed the clear language of our\r\n  constitution (&quot;[i]f â€¦ two-thirds of that house shall agree to\r\n  pass [the override]&quot;) in its efforts to override a governor's veto.Â  The\r\n  historical practice of the General Assembly has, in fact, mirrored our Morton,\r\n    Bliss and Smith v. Jennings precedent requiring that &quot;two-thirds of [a] quorum must concur for effective\r\n  action.&quot;Â  Today we adhere to stare\r\n    decisis and reject the General Assembly's recently adopted practice, which\r\n  circumvents and violates the constitutionally mandated two-thirds requirement for\r\n  overriding a governor's veto.Â  \r\n[5] Mason's and other parliamentary resource\r\n  manuals provide default rules in the absence of specific requirements\r\n  &quot;otherwise.&quot;Â  In a sense, these parliamentary resource manuals fill\r\n  in gaps.Â  See Mason's Â§ 37.1 (&quot;All matters of procedure not\r\n  governed by constitutional provisions . . . are governed by the rules of the\r\n  general parliamentary law.&quot;).Â  But when the constitution unambiguously\r\n  declares the process to be followed, and there are no gaps to be filled, as is\r\n  the case here, the constitution controls.Â  See Mason's Â§ 6.2 (&quot;A\r\n  constitutional provision regulating procedure controls over all other rules of\r\n  procedure.&quot;); Mason's Â§ 7.1 (&quot;Constitutional provisions\r\n  prescribing exact or exclusive time or methods for certain acts are mandatory\r\n  and must be complied with.&quot;); Mason's Â§ 12.1 (&quot;A legislative\r\n  body cannot make a rule that evades or avoids the effect of a rule prescribed\r\n  by the constitution governing it . . . .&quot;).Â  \r\n[6] The dissent illuminates in part this court's history\r\n  of turning a blind eye to legislative constitutional infractions when it comes\r\n  to public education.Â  I would posit that the sordid reasons for having turned a\r\n  blind eye supposedly no longer exist so we should cleanse our eyes with the\r\n  &quot;moistened clay&quot; of justice and rule accordingly.Â  It is time to end\r\n  this court-created education exception to our constitutional mandate.\r\n[7] Article I, section 5 of the United States\r\n  Constitution requires a &quot;Quorum to do Business.&quot;Â  U.S. Const. art. I,\r\n  Â§ 5.Â  Between 1861 and 1891, a quorum in the United States Congress was\r\n  determined only by noting the number of members voting. The Senate of South\r\n  Carolina, Constitution of the United States and Jefferson's Manual Â§ 54.Â  This\r\n  method of determining the existence of a quorum encouraged a practice where\r\n  members would refuse to vote in order to break the quorum and &quot;obstruct\r\n  the public business.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In 1890, the Speaker of the House\r\n  directed the clerk to enter on the Journal as part of the record of votes the\r\n  names of the members present, but not voting.Â  Since, the standard method of\r\n  ascertaining the presence of a quorum is to count all members present, even if\r\n  not voting.Â  Id.\r\n[8] &quot;[N]othing contained\r\n  in this section shall prohibit the General Assembly from enacting special\r\n  provisions in general laws.&quot;Â  S.C.

(FACES) instituted this\r\n  action against respondent for breach of \r\n  contract, breach\r\n  of the duty of loyalty, and injunctive relief.Â  The circuit court granted\r\n  summary judgment in favor of respondent as to all causes of action.Â  FACES\r\n  appeals.[1]Â \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTSÂ Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACES, a for-profit company headquartered in South Carolina,\r\n  recruits teachers from outside the United States and places them with schools\r\n  within the state pursuant to the Mutual\r\n  Educational and Cultural Exchange Program.Â  See 22 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 2451 et\r\n  seq.Â  In 2003, respondent, a Romanian citizen,\r\n  contracted with FACES to participate in its program, and entered the United\r\n  States on a J-1 visa.Â  Pursuant to the &quot;foreign residency\r\n  requirement&quot; of the J-1 visa, respondent was required to return to her home country and remain\r\n  there for at least two years following departure from the United States.Â  See 8 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1182(e).Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  respondent had taught for two years, she and FACES entered into a revised\r\n  agreement for the term of an additional school year.Â  The agreement included a\r\n  &quot;covenant not to compete&quot; stating respondent would not teach within\r\n  the state for two years after leaving the FACES program, consonant with the\r\n  foreign residency requirement.Â  The new contract also increased respondent's\r\n  salary and contained an acknowledgement that respondent would return home for\r\n  two years after the contract expired.Â  Finally, the revised agreement contained a liquidated damages provision providing that, in\r\n  the event of a breach of contract, FACES would be entitled to an award including,\r\n  but not limited to, monetary damages in an amount not less than $36,000.\r\nShortly\r\n  after executing the new contract, respondent married a former FACES teacher.Â \r\n  Respondent applied for, and was granted, a waiver of the J-1 foreign residency\r\n  requirement, allowing her to remain in the United States.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  respondent accepted a full-time position with another school district and\r\n  received an H-1B visa allowing her to remain in the United States after the\r\n  expiration of her J-1 visa.\r\nFollowing\r\n  respondent's failure to return to Romania as contracted,Â  FACES instituted this\r\n  action for breach of contract, breach of duty of loyalty, and injunctive\r\n  relief.\r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent\r\n  as to all of FACES' claims, finding: (1) the covenant not to compete was\r\n  unenforceable; (2) respondent did not violate the covenant not to compete; (3)\r\n  the grant of an injunction requiring respondent to return home would be\r\n  pre-empted by federal immigration law; (4) the liquidated damages provision was\r\n  unenforceable; and (5) respondent did not breach any duty of loyalty.Â  \r\nThe circuit court also denied FACES' motion for partial summary\r\n  judgment, concluding a ruling that the acknowledgement and covenant not to\r\n  compete were enforceable on foreign policy grounds would amount to an advisory\r\n  opinion.[2]\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI. Did the circuit court\r\n  err in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent as to FACES' breach of\r\n  contract claim?\r\n\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Did the circuit court\r\n  err in granting summary judgment in favor of respondent as to FACES' breach of\r\n  duty of loyalty claim?\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing an\r\n  order granting summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard\r\n  as the trial court.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.Â  Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of material fact\r\n  exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may\r\n  be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\n  party.Â  Fleming, 350 S.C. at 493-94, 567 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe reverse the circuit court's order granting summary judgment,\r\n  finding there are material questions of fact whether respondent breached the\r\n  revised contract by not returning to her home country and accepting another job,\r\n  whether FACES suffered any actual as opposed to liquidated damages, and whether\r\n  respondent breached the duty of loyalty implied in every employment contract.\r\nI.&nbsp; Breach of Contract\r\nFACES argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment\r\n  in favor of respondent as to FACES' breach of contract claim.Â  We agree.\r\nA.&nbsp;Respondent's\r\n  failure to return home\r\nThe circuit court only addressed respondent's failure to return\r\n  home in terms of FACES' claim for injunctive relief, finding an order requiring\r\n  respondent to return home would be pre-empted by federal immigration law.Â  The\r\n  circuit court did not consider that respondent's failure to return home could\r\n  be considered a breach of contract.Â  Rather, the circuit court granted summary\r\n  judgment as to FACES' breach of contract claim, focusing solely on the\r\n  enforceability of the covenant not to compete and respondent's continuing to\r\n  teach within the state.\r\nWe find the circuit court erred by simply finding the covenant not\r\n  to compete was unenforceable and failing to address that respondent's failure\r\n  to return home could itself be considered a breach of contract.Â  The fact\r\n  respondent was granted a waiver does not preclude FACES' ability to enforce the\r\n  contract because FACES' claim for breach of contract is not pre-empted by\r\n  federal immigration law.Â  While the circuit court may have correctly found it\r\n  did not have the power to order respondent to return home through injunctive\r\n  relief, the separate breach of contract action does not involve respondent's\r\n  immigration status.\r\nB. Covenant not to\r\n  compete\r\nWe are also persuaded by FACES' argument that the non-compete\r\n  provision, although inartfully named, is not actually a covenant not to\r\n  compete, but rather an agreed upon contract term, the purpose of which was to\r\n  ensure respondent complied with the foreign residency requirement.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in applying the common law\r\n  governing covenants not to compete and in granting summary judgment for this\r\n  reason.\r\nC.&nbsp;Damages\r\nFACES argues the circuit court erred in finding the liquidated\r\n  damages provision in the revised agreement was unenforceable.Â  FACES maintains\r\n  that, in the alternative, it has also suffered actual damages as a result of\r\n  respondent's failure to return home.Â  Specifically, FACES contends it lost its\r\n  significant investment in respondent because she diverted the funds provided\r\n  for her own personal use.Â  FACES further claims its sponsorship designation is\r\n  at risk because of the large numbers of teachers who, like respondent, do not\r\n  complete the foreign residency requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Parties to a contract may stipulate as to the amount\r\n  of liquidated damages owed in the event of nonperformance.&quot;Â  Lewis v.\r\n  Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 172, 568 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2002).Â \r\n  &quot;Where, however, the sum stipulated is plainly disproportionate to any\r\n  probable damage resulting from breach of contract, the stipulation is an\r\n  unenforceable penalty.&quot;Â  Id.Â  If a clause is held to be a penalty,\r\n  the plaintiff may still recover any actual damages that can be proved to have\r\n  resulted from the breach.Â  Tate v. LeMaster, 231 S.C. 429, 99 S.E.2d 39\r\n  (1957).\r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit court found the liquidated damages provision\r\n  contained in the parties' agreement constituted an unenforceable penalty\r\n  because it had no relationship to any actual damages FACES might sustain as a\r\n  result of respondent's alleged breach.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the circuit court properly concluded the liquidated\r\n  damages provision is unenforceable because $36,000 is plainly disproportionate\r\n  to any probable damage resulting from respondent's failure to return home.Â \r\n  FACES' purported &quot;lost investment&quot; in respondent, totaling $29,400,\r\n  accounts for the majority of that stipulated amount.Â  We agree with respondent\r\n  that the money FACES invested in respondent is a &quot;sunk cost&quot; over\r\n  which respondent's failure to return home had no effect.Â  In other words, FACES\r\n  would have invested that money regardless whether respondent returned home.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court properly found the amount of liquidated\r\n  damages constituted an unenforceable penalty.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nRegarding actual damages, initially, FACES' argument that\r\n  respondent's failure to return home somehow financially harmed FACES appears\r\n  largely speculative.Â  Other than the threat of losing its sponsor designation\r\n  and its lost investment in respondent, FACES claims to have lost the future net\r\n  income it would have received by placing a new teacher in the place occupied by\r\n  respondent for three to six years while in her new position, in addition to\r\n  less readily quantifiable damages such as FACES' lost goodwill.Â  It is\r\n  questionable whether FACES' lost income and goodwill would constitute an\r\n  appropriate award of actual damages.Â  We nonetheless find the circuit court\r\n  erred in only addressing the liquidated damages provision to support its grant\r\n  of summary judgment as to FACES' breach of contract claim.Â  Assuming the\r\n  circuit court correctly found the liquidated damages provision was\r\n  unenforceable, it is possible FACES is alternatively entitled to actual\r\n  damages, and more factual development is necessary to make that determination.Â  Tate, supra.\r\n  \r\n  II.&nbsp; Breach of Duty of\r\n    Loyalty\r\n  FACES also argues the circuit court erred in granting summary\r\n    judgment in favor of respondent as to FACES' tort action for breach of the duty\r\n    of loyalty.Â  We agree.\r\n  &quot;It is implicit in any contract for employment that the\r\n    employee shall remain faithful to the employer's interest throughout the term\r\n    of employment. An employee has a duty of fidelity to his employer.&quot;Â  Berry\r\n      v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 270 S.C. 489, 491, 242 S.E.2d 551, 552\r\n    (1978).Â  This Court has recognized a tort action for breach of the duty of\r\n    loyalty.Â  See Lowndes Products, Inc. v. Brower, 259 S.C. 322,\r\n    335-39, 191 S.E.2d 761, 767-70 (1972) (key employees who contacted and met with\r\n    investors and a customer of current employer to lay plans to start a competing\r\n    textile company, who left their employer without notice, and who leased space\r\n    and ordered materials to build manufacturing equipment were guilty of\r\n    disloyalty, and owed damages to employer).\r\n  While we express no opinion as to the viability of the breach of\r\n    the duty of loyalty claim as one independent of the breach of contract action,\r\n    we find the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because respondent\r\n    did not seek summary judgment as to this claim.\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  \r\n  The\r\n  circuit court erred in granting summary judgment as to FACES' claims for breach\r\n  of contract and breach of the duty of loyalty.Â  Accordingly, the order of the\r\n  circuit court is\r\n  \r\n  REVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, BEATTY, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n  HEARN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion in\r\n  which KITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  HEARN:Â  Respectfully, I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I agree with\r\n  the majority that the circuit court erroneously granted summary judgment as to\r\n  FACES' duty of loyalty claim because Tripon did not move for summary judgment\r\n  on it.Â  I further agree that Tripon's failure to return to Romania can\r\n  constitute a breach of contract, the so-called covenant not to compete does not\r\n  fit this Court's definition of one, and the liquidated damages provision in the\r\n  contract is unenforceable.Â  However, in my opinion FACES' claim for actual\r\n  damages is too speculative and cannot withstand summary judgment.Â  I would\r\n  therefore affirm the circuit court's dismissal of FACES' breach of contract\r\n  claim.[3]\r\nFACES'\r\n  claim for damages falls into two groups.Â  The first is what FACES terms its\r\n  &quot;lost investment&quot; in Tripon, which it measures by the expenditures it\r\n  incurred in bringing her to the United States, providing her benefits, training\r\n  and certifying her, and other related costs.Â  However, those are all sunk costs\r\n  that FACES would have expended regardless of whether Tripon left the country as\r\n  planned or remained.Â  Thus, they were not caused by her alleged breach of the\r\n  contract and are not recoverable. See Branche Builders, Inc. v. Coggins,\r\n  386 S.C. 43, 48, 686 S.E.2d 200, 202 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating a plaintiff must\r\n  prove the breach caused damages). \r\nThe second group of damages is loss of goodwill and\r\n  future profits stemming from FACES' tarnished reputation and potential\r\n  decertification due to teachers refusing to leave the country as they\r\n  originally agreed to do.Â  The amount of lost profits or diminution in goodwill\r\n  must be at least reasonably certain. See Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins,\r\n  309 S.C. 237, 242, 421 S.E.2d 402, 405 (1992) (&quot;In claiming lost profits,\r\n  the degree of proof required is that of reasonable certainty.&quot;);\r\n  Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 352 cmt. a (1981) (&quot;Damages need not\r\n  be calculable with mathematical accuracy and are often at best approximate.Â \r\n  This is especially true for items such as loss of good will as to which great\r\n  precision cannot be expected.&quot;).Â  &quot;The proof must pass the realm of\r\n  conjecture, speculation or opinion not founded on facts, and must consist of\r\n  actual facts from which a reasonably accurate conclusion regarding the cause\r\n  and the amount of the loss can be logically and rationally drawn.&quot; Sterling\r\n    Dev. Co., 309 S.C. at 242, 421 S.E.2d at 405.Â  All that is necessary is\r\n  &quot;a certain standard or fixed method&quot; to estimate losses &quot;with a\r\n  fair degree of accuracy.&quot; Collins Holding Corp. v. Landrum, 360\r\n  S.C. 346, 350, 601 S.E.2d 332, 334 (2004) (quoting S.C. Fin. Corp. of\r\n    Anderson v. W. Side Fin. Co., 236 S.C. 109, 123, 113 S.E.2d 329, 336\r\n  (1960)).\r\nFrom my review of the record, FACES' claim for damages\r\n  is too speculative even when viewed in the light most favorable to it.Â  Because\r\n  proving lost profits and loss of goodwill can be difficult, only reasonable\r\n  certainty, as opposed to mathematical precision, is required.Â  Here, however,\r\n  FACES has provided nothing but bald assertions and conjecture, with no real\r\n  factual support, that it will be damaged in the future as a result of Tripon's\r\n  actions.Â  Indeed, it is exceedingly difficult to fathom, absent pure\r\n  speculation, how FACES was actually and monetarily damaged by Tripon's failure\r\n  to return to her own country.Â  In my view, allowing this case to proceed to\r\n  trial will place a jury in the impossible position of assessing damages where\r\n  none can even be articulated, let alone proven.Â  Accordingly, I do not believe\r\n  the information contained in the record is sufficient to withstand summary\r\n  judgment and would affirm the circuit court's dismissal of FACES' breach of\r\n  contract claim.\r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] FACES does not appeal the grant of summary judgment as to the action for\r\n  injunctive relief.\r\n[2] While FACES purports to appeal this denial of partial summary judgment,\r\n  we decline to address this issue as the denial of the motion for summary\r\n  judgment was not a final determination of the merits of the case, and therefore\r\n  it is not immediately appealable.Â  See Ballenger v. Bowen, 313\r\n  S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1994) (denial of summary judgment motion that decides\r\n  nothing about the merits of the case is not immediately appealable).\r\n[3] I recognize that the circuit court's order did not address FACES' actual\r\n  damages.Â  However, FACES requested the court consider actual damages in its\r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion and raised this issue elsewhere as well.Â  This issue\r\n  therefore appears in the record and I would affirm the circuit court on that\r\n  basis. See Rule 220(c), SCACR.Â  FACES at no point argues summary\r\n  judgment was premature, and the majority therefore errs in reversing on this\r\n  ground.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
