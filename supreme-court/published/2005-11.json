Templeton and Graham P. Powell, of Elmore &amp; Wall, P.A., of Charleston, for plaintiff.\r\nMary Leigh Arnold, of Mt. Pleasant; and Steven L. Smith, of Smith, Collins &amp; Newton, of Charleston, for defendants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  We accepted this certified question to determine the meaning of the term â€œoccurrenceâ€ in a commercial general liability insurance policy.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe underlying action in this federal case is a products liability class action arising from the sale of defective Parex, a synthetic stucco distributed by Defendant CGD, Inc.[1]Â  The defective stucco allegedly caused water intrusion that damaged class membersâ€™ property.Â  CGD was insured at the time under a commercial general liability insurance policy issued by Plaintiff Owners Insurance Company (Insurer).Â  Insurer sought a declaratory judgment that the policy in question does not provide coverage for this class action.\r\nThe district court ruled in favor of coverage but found an issue remains regarding the amount of coverage depending upon the meaning of the term â€œoccurrence.â€Â  The policy defines â€œoccurrenceâ€ as â€œan accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.â€Â  If distribution of the stucco to various buyers is considered one occurrence, the policyâ€™s per occurrence limit of $1 million applies; if each sale is an occurrence, the aggregate limit of $2 million applies.Â  \r\nThe following question was certified to this Court:\r\n\r\nTo determine the number of occurrences for purposes of a commercial general liability insurance policyâ€™s liability limit, will South Carolina adopt the majority or minority rule?\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nIs each individual sale of a defective product an occurrence\r\nor is the general act of distribution a single occurrence?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAs discussed in various treatises, the majority rule in interpreting the meaning of â€œoccurrenceâ€ in a liability policy is the so-called â€œcause testâ€ which focuses on the cause of the damage rather than the number of claimants or injuries.Â  The minority view, on the other hand, focuses on the effect of the insuredâ€™s action and considers each event or each injury a separate occurrence.Â  See generally Michael Sullivan, Annotation, What Constitutes Single Accident or Occurrence within Liability Policy Limiting Insurerâ€™s Liability to a Specified Amount Per Accident or Occurrence, 64 A.L.R.4th 668 (2004); Am.L. Prod. Liab. 3d Â§ 58:28 (2005); 46 C.J.S. Insurance Â§ 1129 (2005).Â  The discussion of a majority-versus-minority view summarizes an amalgam of cases, including vehicle accidents, flooding, fist-fights, and so on,[2] and is not limited to product liability cases.Â  Notably, there is no prevailing view in the specific context of product liability cases involving the distribution of a defective product.Â  Compare Champion Internatâ€™l Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co., 546 F.2d 502 (2d Cir. 1976) (repeated sale of defective paneling was only one occurrence), and Murice Pincoffs Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 447 F.2d 204 (5th Cir. 1971) (each sale of defective bird feed was separate occurrence). Â In light of the diverse contexts in which the meaning of â€œoccurrenceâ€ may arise, we decline the district courtâ€™s invitation to simply choose the majority or minority view and instead focus narrowly on the issue at hand. \r\nThis case involves the distribution of inherently defective goods, and not the defective distribution of otherwise satisfactory goods.[3]Â  There is no indication CGD defectively distributed the product in question.Â  Further, the policy here provides coverage for an â€œoccurrenceâ€ including a â€œcontinuous and repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.â€ Â Because the distributor has taken no distinct action giving rise to liability for each sale, we conclude under this policy definition that placing a defective product into the stream of commerce is one occurrence. \r\nAccordingly, we limit our ruling on this issue by focusing on the specific context and policy language before us and conclude there has been a single occurrence.\r\nQUESTION ANSWERED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]The seller of defective goods may be liable under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 (2005). \r\n[2]See Annot., supra, Â§Â§ 8-19. \r\n[3]We are persuaded by Insurerâ€™s argument that Michigan Chem. Corp. v. American Home Assurance Co., 728 F.2d 374 (6th Cir. 1984), a products liability case, is distinguishable from the case before us.Â  In that case, the federal court, applying Illinois law, concluded that each shipment was a separate occurrence where the insured accidentally shipped flame retardant instead of a feed supplement.Â  The flame retardant was mixed into livestock feed sold to farmers whose animals had to be destroyed as a result of the contamination.Â  It was the insuredâ€™s defective distribution which caused the damage rather than an inherent defect in the product as manufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26060","title":"Tillotson v.

Mims.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This is an appeal from the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant a preliminary injunction preventing a â€œspecial auditâ€ of the Berkeley County Clerk of Courtâ€™s Office.Â  The individual members of the Berkeley County Council cross-appeal the denial of their motion to dismiss Mary P. Brownâ€™s claims for defamation, defamation per se, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  This case was certified for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThis is a dispute between branches of Berkeley County Government.Â  Mary P. Brown (Brown) has served as the Berkeley County Clerk of Court (the Clerk) since being first elected to that office in 1983.Â  Under South Carolina law, Berkeley County (the County) is subject to an annual financial audit conducted by independent and outside auditors.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-150 (Supp. 2004).Â  The outside financial audit for the fiscal year 2002-2003 began in early August, 2003.Â  \r\nIn November of 2003, the outside auditor issued a financial report to the County.Â  The auditor found no major instances of noncompliance, but did report some â€œimmaterial instances of noncompliance.â€Â  Over the course of the next few months, the auditor raised concerns regarding Brownâ€™s use of the county credit card, the reporting of interest earned on the Clerkâ€™s escrow accounts, and instances of payments to employees that may not have been reported on the proper federal tax forms.Â  The auditor also observed that certain details of the Clerkâ€™s handling of discretionary funds, specifically funds collected by the issuance of professional or surety bondsman licenses, were not maintained in accordance with the applicable statutes.Â  Throughout this process of investigation, the auditor maintained that these findings did not materially alter the November report.Â  The auditor instead classified these findings as â€œopportunities for strengthening internal controls and operating efficiency.â€Â  \r\nThe dispute in this case involves the actions of the Berkeley County Council (the County Council) during this same time period.Â  In November of 2003, the County Council enacted a written request for Brown to produce financial documentation for the past two years regarding ten (10) county bank and credit card accounts.Â  In reply to the County Councilâ€™s request, Brown asserted that the County Council violated the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by authorizing the request to produce in a closed executive session.Â  Brown additionally claimed that James H. Rozier, Jr., Supervisor and Chairman of the County Council, improperly accused Brown of misusing the county credit card.Â  Following three months of discourse between the clerkâ€™s office and the County Council, the County Council enacted a resolution approving an â€œexpanded audit[1]â€ of the clerkâ€™s office.Â  Brown filed suit seeking, among other forms of relief, a preliminary injunction prohibiting the audit of the clerkâ€™s office, and damages against the County, the County Council, and the individual council members for defamation, defamation per se, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\r\nThe trial court denied Brownâ€™s motion for a preliminary injunction, relying largely on the language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-150.[2] Â Â The trial court found that the County Council was not free to interfere with the operation of the clerkâ€™s office in a manner that was unreasonable, unduly burdensome, or of a harassing nature, but the trial court found no evidence of such action in this case.\r\nIn the same order, the trial court declined to dismiss the individual council members â€œat this early stage.â€Â  The individual council members had moved for dismissal from the lawsuit citing the terms of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act and absolute legislative immunity.\r\nBoth parties appealed, and the following issues have been raised for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in denying Brownâ€™s request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the expanded audit?Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in denying the individual council membersâ€™ motion to dismiss?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Brownâ€™s Request for a Preliminary Injunction.\r\nBrown argues that the trial court erred in denying her request for a preliminary injunction.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nGenerally, actions for injunctive relief are equitable in nature.Â  Wiedemann v. Town of Hilton Head, 344 S.C. 233, 236, 542 S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App. 2001). Â In equitable actions, the appellate court may review the record and make findings of fact in accordance with its own view of the evidence.Â  Doe v. Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 276, 457 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1995).Â  To obtain an injunction, a party must demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, and the absence of an adequate remedy at law.Â  County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 669, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).  \r\nBrown claims that the special audit ordered by the County Council is invalid because the County Council did not articulate specific reasons why such an audit was necessary.Â  The relevant portion of the code provides in part:\r\n\r\nThe council shall provide for an independent annual audit of all financial records and transactions of the county and any agency funded in whole by county funds and may provide for more frequent audits as it considers necessary.Â  Special audits may be provided for any agency receiving county funds as the county governing body considers necessary.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-150 (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nClear and unambiguous words in a statute should be given their plain and ordinary meaning.Â  In re Vincent J., 333 S.C. 233, 235, 509 S.E.2d 261, 262 (1998) (citing Gilstrap v. S.C. Budget and Control Bd., 310 S.C. 210, 423 S.E.2d 101 (1992)).Â  In this case, the plain language of the statute unequivocally allows a county government to order special audits whenever the county government considers the audit necessary.Â  \r\nThe instant case does not require this Court to look beyond the plain words of the statute and interpret the meaning of the phrase â€œconsiders necessary.â€Â  The resolution adopted by the County Council clearly outlines (1) that the County Council has previously made requests for the Clerk to provide financial information, including documentation in support of certain financial transactions, (2) that the Clerk has refused to provide the requested documentation, (3) that the funds involved are public funds, and (4) that the County Council feels that the most appropriate method of ensuring the proper use of public funds is to request a special audit of the clerkâ€™s office. Â This constitutes the functional equivalent of articulating necessity, and no reasonable construction of the statute at issue could require the County Council to do more in the way of offering justification for a special audit.Â  Were we to adopt the position advocated by Brown, our conclusion would inevitably be the same.[3]Â  For this reason, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision denying Brownâ€™s request for a preliminary injunction.[4]\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The Motion to Dismiss the Individual Defendants.\r\nThe individual council members argue that they should be dismissed from Brownâ€™s suit pursuant to the principle of absolute immunity and the terms of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  We disagree and instead hold that the denial of the individual council membersâ€™ motion to dismiss is not reviewable at this time.\r\nIt is well settled that an interlocutory order is not immediately appealable unless it involves the merits of the case or affects a substantial right.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (Supp. 2003); Woodward v. Westvaco Corp., 319 S.C. 240, 243, 460 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1995); Mid-State Distributors, Inc. v. Century Importers, 310 S.C. 330, 334-35, 426 S.E.2d 777, 780 (1993); Shields v. Martin Marietta Corp., 303 S.C. 469, 470, 402 S.E.2d 482, 483 (1991).Â  To involve the merits of a case, the order must â€œfinally determine some substantial matter forming the whole or a part of some cause of action or defense.â€Â  Woodward, 319 S.C. at 243, 460 S.E.2d at 394.Â  To affect a substantial right, the order must â€œdetermine the action and prevent a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinue the action.â€ Â Id.Â  We decide, then, whether the trial courtâ€™s order denying the individual council membersâ€™ motion to dismiss is an immediately appealable order.\r\nIndividual members of a local county council are not entitled to absolute immunity. Â See Richardson v. McGill, 273 S.C. 142, 146, 255 S.E.2d 341, 343 (1979) (noting that privilege depends not on rigid requirements but is determined by consideration of public policy).Â  Furthermore, the trial courtâ€™s denial of the individual council membersâ€™ motion to dismiss does not preclude the individual council members from raising the issues presented in their motion at a later point in the case.Â  See Frazier v. Badger, 361 S.C. 94, 101, 603 S.E.2d 587, 590 (2004) (stating that immunity under the Tort Claims Act is an affirmative defense that must be proved at trial); Sanders v. Prince, 304 S.C. 236, 240, 403 S.E.2d 640, 643 (1991) (stating that when a government employeeâ€™s conduct constitutes actual malice, he is not entitled to immunity from suit).Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Tort Claims Act provides â€œ[n]othing in this chapter may be construed to give an employee of a governmental entity immunity from suitâ€¦if it is proved that the employeeâ€™s conduct was not within the scope of his official duties or that it constituted actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70 (b) (2005).Â  Were we to recognize that the individual members of the county council enjoyed absolute immunity from suit, the above statute would be meaningless.Â  Additionally, the individual council members will be free to raise such issues as qualified immunity, qualified privilege, and the provisions of the Tort Claims Act, at later stages of this case. Â For these reasons, we hold that the denial of the individual council membersâ€™ motion to dismiss is not presently reviewable.[5]\r\nConclusion\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s refusal to issue a preliminary injunction preventing a special audit of the Berkeley County Clerk of Courtâ€™s Office. Because the grounds laid out in the County Councilâ€™s resolution authorizing the special audit constitute the functional equivalent of articulating necessity, we need not answer the question of whether a county government must articulate necessity in authorizing a special audit under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-150 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nBecause the denial of the individual members of the Berkeley County Councilâ€™s motion to dismiss is an interlocutory order and neither involves the merits nor affects a substantial right of the parties, we hold that this motion is not presently subject to appellate review.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The terms â€œspecial auditâ€ and â€œexpanded auditâ€ are used interchangeably.Â  The County Councilâ€™s resolution calls for an â€œexpanded audit,â€ and the statute at issue, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-150 (Supp. 2004), uses the term â€œspecial audit.â€Â  Both terms refer to the same activity.\r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-150 (Supp. 2004) states that special audits may be provided for any agency receiving county funds as the governing body considers necessary.\r\n[3] Brown asks this Court to interpret Â§ 4-9-150 to require the County Council to articulate why a special audit is necessary.\r\n[4] Brown also argues that through the special audit, the County Council is exerting improper control over the constitutionally created office of the Clerk of Court and that the Clerkâ€™s Office would be irreparably harmed by the auditorâ€™s â€œopen ended and burdensomeâ€ demand for documents and information.Â  We decline to address the issue of harm as the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the temporary injunction is affirmed for reasons already stated. \r\n[5] Courts have made a practice of accepting appeals of denials of interlocutory orders not ordinarily immediately appealable when these appeals are companion to issues that are reviewable. Pitts v. Jackson Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 338, 574 S.E.2d 502, 512 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Morris v. Anderson County, 349 S.C. 607, 610, 564 S.E.2d 649, 651 (2002)).Â  In the instant case, however, the two issues argued on appeal (the denial of a preliminary injunction preventing a special audit and the denial of a motion to dismiss claims for defamation, defamation per se, and intentional infliction of emotional distress) lack a sufficient nexus or companionship to justify this Courtâ€™s exercise of immediate appellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26063","title":"Smith v.

Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nJohn D. Elliott, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Jane Smith (Smith) brought this action to establish paternity and award child support.Â  The family court declared that John Doe (Doe) was the father and ordered Doe to pay child support.Â  The court of appeals held that Doe had an ongoing duty to support the child (Danielle) and that the action was not barred by the statute of limitations.Â  On appeal, the court of appeals held that the amount of the child support award was reasonable.Â  We affirm the court of appeals.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nThe child in the present case, Danielle, was thirty-four years old when this action was commenced.Â  Danielle is the child of Doe and Smith.Â  Smith and Doe met in 1964, and although Doe was married at the time, the two had an affair.Â  Danielle, the result of the affair, was born in July of 1965.\r\nDanielle is mentally handicapped and has the mental capacity of a six-year-old.Â  Danielle does not have the capacity to read, do math, cook, or drive.Â  In addition, Danielle cannot be left unsupervised, and as a result, she is under childcare supervision most of the day.Â  \r\nDoe was aware Danielleâ€™s birth but did not have a relationship with her or offer support to her.Â  Out of concern for Danielleâ€™s well being, Smith asked Doe if he would recognize Danielle as his daughter in order to allow Danielle to receive Social Security benefits upon Doeâ€™s death.Â  Doe refused to recognize Danielle as his child.Â  As a result, Smith filed an action against Doe seeking a declaration of child support and paternity.Â  \r\nDoe filed a motion to dismiss, denying that he was Danielleâ€™s father and arguing that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  The family court denied the motion and ordered the parties to undergo paternity testing.Â  The paternity test revealed that Doe was Danielleâ€™s father.\r\nAs a result, the court ordered Doe to pay $91.00 per week in child support starting from the commencement of the action and the court also ordered Doe to pay attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The court of appeals affirmed the decision of the family court, rejecting Doeâ€™s argument that the statute of limitations barred the action.Â  Doe appealed and this Court granted certiorari to review the following issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Does the general statute of limitations bar Smithâ€™s paternity and child support actions?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the family court err in awarding child support?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nStatute of Limitations \r\nDoe argues that the court of appeals erred in holding that the statute of limitations did not bar the paternity and child support actions.Â  We disagree.Â  The action to determine paternity and the action for child support are separate actions, however, in the present case the actions were brought together.Â  We will address the support obligation first.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSupport Obligation \r\nWhen a child is so physically or mentally disabled that the child cannot support himself or herself, the parentâ€™s duty to support the child continues beyond the child reaching the age of majority.Â  Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 234-35, 578 S.E.2d 3, 5 (2003).Â  When the disability prevents the child from becoming emancipated, the presumption of emancipation upon reaching the age of majority is inapplicable.Â  Parker v. Parker, 230 S.C. 28, 31, 94 S.E.2d 12, 13 (1956).\r\nIn Riggs v. Riggs, this Court held that a parentâ€™s support obligation continued past the age of majority even when the disability was not diagnosed until after the child reached age eighteen.Â  353 S.C. at 235, 578 S.E.2d at 5 (2003).Â  The child in Riggs was diagnosed with Leighâ€™s Syndrome after reaching eighteen.Â  As a result of the degenerative condition, the child was not able to function above the level of a ten-year-old and had mobility problems.Â  The Court held that even though the child had reached the age of majority, the disability prevented the child from being emancipated.Â  Id. Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, Danielle is thirty-four years old, but unlike the child in Riggs, Danielleâ€™s condition manifested at birth.Â  However, due to her disability, Danielle is incapable of being emancipated.Â  As a result, we hold that Doeâ€™s support obligation did not terminate when Danielle reached the age of majority.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision holding that the action for support was not barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPaternity \r\nDoe argues that the paternity action is barred by the general statute of limitations.[1]Â  We disagree.Â  This Court has not directly addressed the issue of whether an action to determine paternity can be barred by the statute of limitations.Â  \r\nAs noted by the court of appeals, some jurisdictions have placed a statute of limitations on bringing an action for paternity.Â  See e.g., 23 PA. Cons. Stat. Ann. Â§ 4343(b) (2003) (requiring that a paternity action be instituted within eighteen years of the childâ€™s birth).\r\nThe South Carolina legislature has passed statutes addressing both a parentâ€™s support obligation and a procedure outlining paternity testing.[2]Â  Nowhere in this stateâ€™s statutory law is a there a time limit for when an action for paternity may be commenced.[3]Â  \r\nThe statutory authority read in conjunction with this Courtâ€™s common law makes it clear that the legislature did not intend to impose a statute of limitations on paternity actions because the Legislature did not specifically include one in the statutory scheme.Â  See Gilstrap v. S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 310 S.C. 210, 214, 423 S.E.2d 101, 103 (1992) (holding that the Court will give statutory provisions reasonable and practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy of the entire act). \r\nAs a result, we affirm the court of appeals, but hold that there is no statute of limitations that is applicable for an action to determine paternity.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAmount of Child Support \r\nDoe argues that the court of appeals erred in determining the amount of child support.Â  We disagree.\r\nChild support awards are within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 92, 320 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1984).Â  The trial court abuses its discretion when factual findings are without evidentiary support or a ruling is based upon an error of law.Â  McKnight v. McKnight, 283 S.C. 540, 543, 324 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nIn the present case, the family court accounted for all income received by Danielle.Â  The court recognized that Danielle received social security benefits of $275 per month.Â  In addition, the court noted that Danielle receives between $250 and $350 per\r\nmonth from her job at the Babcock Center.Â  The family court used the child support guidelines and ordered Doe to pay $91.00 per week in support.Â  The court refused to deviate from the guidelines.\r\nWe hold that the family court did not err in determining the amount of support to which Danielle was entitled.Â  The court followed the child support guidelines and accounted for all income Danielle was receiving in order to reach the total amount of support Doe is obligated to pay.\r\nAs a result, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision finding that the family court did not err in awarding child support.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we affirm the court of appeals.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  The general Statute of limitations is codified at\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Section 15-3-530 (Supp. 2004).\r\n[2] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-952 (Supp. 2003) (allowing paternity actions by and on behalf of children older than eighteen); S.C. Code Ann Â§ 20-7-90 (Supp. 2004) (requiring parents to provide support for their legitimate and illegitimate children).\r\n[3] Upon review of this Courtâ€™s jurisprudence, it seems that statute of limitations issues have arisen only in limited situations involving a parentâ€™s duty of support.Â Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Serv. v. Lowman, 269 S.C. 41, 236 S.E.2d 194 (1977).Â  In Lowman, this Court held that the general statute of limitations applied to a support obligation but only in an action to seek retroactive child support.Â  Id. at 47, 236 S.E.2d at 196.Â  Further, the Court stated that although a claim for retroactive support might be barred, â€œthe duty of support is a continuing obligation.Â  New causes of action arise over the years with each instance of a putative fatherâ€™s failure to support his child.â€Â  Id. at 48, 236 S.E.2d at 196.Â  (citation omitted). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26064","title":"In the Matter of Darren S.

Haley, of Greenville, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand or a definite suspension not to exceed thirty (30) days.Â  See Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for a thirty (30) day period.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent admits he was not as diligent as he should have been in handling a domestic case.Â  He failed to adequately communicate with his client. \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent admits he was not diligent in notifying his client of the hearing dates.Â  In addition, he did not meet with his client to prepare her for a hearing.Â  He admits he failed to respond in a timely manner to ODCâ€™s request for additional information.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent failed to perfect service of a summons and complaint and later failed to file an amended complaint in a timely manner.Â  Both actions were dismissed.Â  Respondent failed to respond to ODCâ€™s initial inquiry and did not respond in a timely manner to ODCâ€™s second letter of inquiry.Â  Respondent agrees to repay this clientâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $750.00 within one year of the date he signed the Agreement.[1]\r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent failed to diligently pursue his clientâ€™s domestic action.Â  He failed to adequately communicate with his client.\r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent failed to respond to a motion for summary judgment and failed to appear at the summary judgment hearing.Â  Summary judgment was granted to the opposing party.Â  \r\nRespondent maintains he had expected his client to either obtain other counsel or contact him if she wanted him to respond to the summary judgment motion, however, he failed to obtain his clientâ€™s written consent or the approval of the court to withdraw from representation.Â  In addition, on an earlier occasion, respondent failed to communicate with the client.\r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent failed to diligently defend a civil forfeiture action against his client.Â  As a result, the answer was late and a default judgment was entered.Â  Respondent failed to adequately communicate with his client and failed to return the $3,000.00 retainer fee he did not earn.Â  Respondent also delayed in responding to inquiries from\r\nODC.\r\nRespondent agrees to repay the $3,000.00 fee to his client within one year of the date he signed the Agreement.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nRespondent signed his clientâ€™s name to a bond assignment form without authorization.Â  The form provided that $7,500.00 of the posted bond money was to be assigned to respondentâ€™s firm for its fee.Â  Although he did not have the authority to sign the form, the amount of the fee was not in dispute.Â  Respondent was not prosecuted. \r\nMatter VIII\r\nRespondent failed to diligently handle a case and to adequately communicate with his client.Â  Respondent failed to safely maintain the clientâ€™s file and the file was lost.Â  Respondent agrees to return the clientâ€™s retainer fee of $1,200.00 within one year of signing the Agreement.\r\nMatter IX\r\nIn this matter, respondent failed to serve and file a notice of appeal from a clientâ€™s conviction.Â  He failed to continue to represent the client until relieved by the court.Â  \r\nRespondent further admits he unsuccessfully tried to establish personal relationships with a female client and with a woman who hired him to represent a third person.Â  Respondent now recognizes such relationships are to be avoided because they often lead to a conflict of interest.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a) (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed concerning the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.7 (lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s own interests); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly deliver funds and property to a client; lawyer shall promptly deliver an accounting about client property); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall take steps to extent reasonably practicable to protect the clientâ€™s interests);\r\nRule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice).[2]\r\nÂ Respondent further admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for a thirty (30) day period.Â  Furthermore, as part of the Courtâ€™s sanction, we adopt respondentâ€™s agreement to repay his clients in the amounts stated herein within one year from the date respondent signed the Agreement.Â  See Footnote 1. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent signed the Agreement on June 30, 2005.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26065","title":"In the Matter of Lillie R.

of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a definite suspension not to exceed two years or any lesser sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the Agreement and impose a two year definite suspension from the practice of law.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows:Â  \r\nFACTS \r\nOn January 28, 2002, respondent was suspended from the practice of law for twenty (20) months.Â  In the Matter of Davis, 348 S.C. 199, 599 S.E.2d 573 (2002).[1]Â  At the time of her suspension, respondent assured ODC that she would close her practice in an orderly manner and that it was not necessary to appoint an attorney to protect her clientsâ€™ interests.Â  \r\nIn connection with her suspension and the closing of her practice, respondent executed an affidavit on February 12, 2002, in which she attested to her compliance with Rule 30, RLDE.Â  In relevant part, respondentâ€™s affidavit states:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        4.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        In accordance with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCAR [sic] I have notified by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, all clients\r\n          being represented by me in a pending matter.Â  \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        5.&nbsp;\r\n         The notice advises the client of the suspension and of the consequent inability to act as an attorney.Â  The notice also advises the client to seek legal advice of the clientâ€™s own\r\n          choice elsewhere, and, if the matter involves pending litigation or administrative proceedings, of the desirability of the prompt substitution of another lawyer to act as the clientâ€™s attorney in the proceeding.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        6.&nbsp;\r\n        I have also notified or caused to be notified, any co-counsel in any pending matter and any opposing counsel, or in the absence of opposing counsel, the adverse parties, of the suspension and the consequent inability of the lawyer to act as an attorney.Â  The notice states my place of residence.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        7.&nbsp;\r\n        In the event the client did not obtain substitute counsel within ten days of the notice, I moved in the court or agency in which the proceedings were pending for leave to withdraw.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        I have promptly refunded any fees paid in advance that have not been earned.Â  I have delivered to all clients being represented in pending matters any papers of [sic] other property to which they are entitled and notified them of and any counsel representing them of a suitable time and place where the papers and other property may be obtained, calling attention to any urgency for obtaining the papers and other property.\r\n      \r\n

and shall make these records available to disciplinary counsel upon request.Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nUnderline added.Â  \r\nMatter I\r\nOn or about January 23, 2002, Client A met with and retained respondent for a domestic matter.Â  At that meeting, Client A executed a fee agreement for $2,500 and paid respondent $200 towards that fee.Â  Client A paid the balance of the fee, $2,300, a few days later.Â  \r\nAfter learning respondentâ€™s telephone had beenÂ  disconnected, Client A alleges she telephoned the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and discovered respondent had been suspended.Â  Although Client A acknowledges she learned of respondentâ€™s suspension before respondent executed the above-referenced affidavit of compliance with Rule 30, Client A alleges she did not subsequently receive written notice as respondent represented in the affidavit.Â  Respondent does not dispute Client Aâ€™s allegation for purposes of the Agreement, but explains she believes Client was sent notice in compliance with Rule 30.Â  \r\nRespondent did not refund the unearned portion of Client Aâ€™s fee as represented in her affidavit.Â  Client A petitioned the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection (Lawyersâ€™ Fund) which determined Client A was entitled to $2,500. \r\nMatter II\r\nAt the time of her suspension on January 28, 2002, respondent was shown on the records of the United States Bankruptcy Court as counsel of record in twelve pending bankruptcy matters, though respondent represents two of the matters had been concluded. Â As of February 27, 2002, fifteen days after executing the above-referenced affidavit, respondent remained counsel of record in nine bankruptcy matters according to the records of the Bankruptcy Court.Â  Orders of substitution in two of those matters were not submitted to the Bankruptcy Court until May 2002.Â  \r\nRespondent explains that she may have continued to appear as counsel on the bankruptcy courtâ€™s records because some of the matters had been dismissed, but orders had not yet been issued, and because other matters were inactive and clients were making payments. \r\nMatter III\r\nIn February 2001, Client B paid respondent $1,200 in fees for a divorce matter.Â  Client B alleges that she made several long distance telephone calls and trips to Columbia from Orangeburg to attempt to contact respondent, but usually reached respondentâ€™s Â answering machine or was told that respondent was not â€œinâ€ but would be â€œin touch.â€Â  Respondent represents that she met with Client B whenever Client B had a scheduled appointment, but has no knowledge of Client Bâ€™s trips to Columbia or long distance telephone calls.Â  \r\nIn addition, Client Bâ€™s complaint to ODC, dated March 25, 2002, alleged that respondent had not notified her that she had been suspended from the practice of law.Â  \r\nRespondent provided ODC with a copy of an unsigned letter dated May 2, 2002, from respondent to Client B, in which respondent notified Client B of the suspension, purported to return Client Bâ€™s file, and offered to substitute respondentâ€™s brother or â€œa couple of my colleaguesâ€ as counsel or, alternatively, return $550 in unearned fees.\r\nRespondentâ€™s response to the Notice of Full Investigation dated November 21, 2002, acknowledges that Client Bâ€™s file was sent by overnight mail at a date later than May 2, 2002, and further states that respondent â€œstill plans to make every effort to refund $550 to [Client B] as soon as she is able to do so.â€Â  \r\nAs of the date of the Agreement, respondent had not refunded the $550 to Client B.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nClient C retained respondent in a domestic matter and paid her $2,190.Â  The court subsequently ordered Client Câ€™s husband to pay $1,188 of Client Câ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Respondent received and retained the $1,188 as additional fees for herself. \r\nRespondent represents that the attorneyâ€™s fee award by the court was for additional work on behalf of Client C for which Client C had not paid.Â  In her Response to Notice of Full Investigation, respondent stated:\r\n\r\nThe hearing proceedings went on for an extended period of time.Â  The Court was not able to break for lunch, because what was intended to be a hearing took the length of a trial.Â  In the Courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees and other awards, the Court noted a lot of the Courtâ€™s time had been expended on the [Client C] matter.Â  Accordingly, it required unanticipated attorney time, which [respondent] believes entitled her to additional fees. In any event, [respondentâ€™s] time spent on the matter exceeded the attorneyâ€™s fees paid.Â  \r\n\r\nMatter V\r\nClient D hired respondent to represent him in a Department of Social Services matter.Â  Client D agreed to pay respondent $2,500. Â Client D made the last payment of $250 to respondent on December 14, 2001.Â  Respondent was suspended on January 28, 2002.Â  The matter had not been concluded at the time of respondentâ€™s suspension.Â  \r\nClient D alleges respondent failed to inform him of her suspension and that respondent told him in May 2002 that respondent had made arrangements for another attorney to handle his case.Â  However, when Client D called the other attorney, he was told the attorney would not be able to take his case because respondent had already been paid the full fee.Â  \r\nIn her response to the Notice of Full Investigation, respondent stated:\r\n\r\nÂ [she] represented [Client D] in a matter brought against him by the Department of Social Services, performing various specific tasks for which he would make periodic payments to her.Â  [Respondent] represented him in Court, met with witnesses, and met with the Department of Social Services among other things.Â  [Respondent] was suspended from the practice of law on January 28, 2002 and it was [her] understanding that [Client D] signed an order substituting [another attorney] as his attorney in this matter.Â  [Respondent] understood that [the other attorney] would complete the representation of [Client D] and first learned of [Client Dâ€™s] allegations on receipt of the Notice of Full Investigation.\r\n\r\nRespondent acknowledges she did not pay any portion of the fee Client D had paid to her to the attorney she arranged to handle Client Dâ€™s case.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent represented Client E on municipal court charges of failing to register a vehicle, driving under suspension, and operating an uninsured vehicle.Â  At a court appearance on March 29, 2000, respondent told Client E to wait in the hall.Â  Client E alleges that, after approximately one hour, respondent came out and told him â€œeverything was straightened outâ€ and handed Client E his driverâ€™s license. \r\nOn July 14, 2002, Client E was stopped for another traffic violation and charged with third offense driving under suspension.Â  One of the prior DUS convictions that caused the July 2002 violation to be a third offense was the matter on which respondent represented Client E in March 2000.Â  \r\nRespondent did not respond to ODCâ€™s requests in this matter.Â  Respondent notified ODC on December 17, 2003, that she was in the process of locating her file and that a response to the Notice of Full Investigation would be submitted as soon as possible.Â  As of the date of the Agreement, respondent has neither responded to the Notice of Full Investigation nor submitted her file to ODC.Â  Respondent represents that she has not been able to locate her file and believed that she responded to the Notice of Full Investigation by submitting to questioning under oath by ODC.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nIn January 2001, Client F was injured in a car accident; Client F retained respondent.Â  After resolving the matter, respondent disbursed the proceeds.Â  Client F alleged respondent failed to pay $98 to a medical provider.Â  \r\nRespondent believes all disbursements were made, but has not been able to locate her file to confirm this belief.Â  For purposes of this Agreement, respondent does not dispute Client Fâ€™s claim and takes the position that any failure to disburse funds was inadvertent.Â  \r\nMatter VIII\r\nRespondentâ€™s clients made claims to the Lawyersâ€™ Fund totaling $11,470.Â  The Lawyersâ€™ Fund awarded respondentâ€™s clients $10,420, including the $2,500 awarded to Client A.Â  Respondent has not reimbursed her clients or the Lawyersâ€™ Fund.Â  She acknowledges her statement â€œI have promptly refunded any fees paid in advance that have not been earnedâ€ in her February 12, 2002 affidavit was inaccurate.Â Â Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that she had not fully cooperated with ODC in the investigation of these matters.Â  She agreed to appear at ODCâ€™s office on January 7, 2004, for an appearance under oath pursuant to Rule 19(c)(4), RLDE, and agreed to bring with her files previously subpoenaed by ODC.Â  Although respondent appeared, she did not produce the files.Â  Respondent explained that the files were in storage and she had not had time to locate them despite the fact that prior subpoenas for the files had been\r\nissued. \r\nDuring her appearance on January 7, 2004, respondent agreed to retrieve the files and provide them to ODC.Â  The appearance was recessed to give respondent the opportunity to retrieve the files.Â  As of the date of the Agreement, respondent had not provided the files to ODC.Â  Respondent represents she has not been able to locate the files.Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 30 (listing requirements for suspended lawyer).Â  In addition, respondent admits she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Â Â Â Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall charge reasonable fee); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly deliver funds which belong to third person); Rule 1.16(d) (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect clientâ€™s interests, including giving reasonable notice to client and refunding unearned funds)Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand from disciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4(a) (it shall be professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).[2]  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and impose a two year definite suspension from the practice of law.Â  We deny respondentâ€™s request to apply the suspension retroactively to the date of her previous suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\nIn addition, respondent shall pay restitution to all presently known and/or subsequently identified clients, banks, and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of her misconduct in connection with these matters.Â  Respondent shall also reimburse the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for any claims paid as a result of her misconduct in connection with these matters.Â  ODC is directed to establish a restitution plan for respondent.[3]Â Â  \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent has not sought to be reinstated pursuant to Rule 33, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n[3] We note respondent has specifically agreed not to apply for reinstatement unless and until all restitution has been paid in full.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Gibbs, Jr., of Gibbs &amp; Holmes, of Charleston, for respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension not to exceed two years or an indefinite suspension, provided the indefinite suspension is made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.[1]Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows. \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Domestic Matters\r\nIn two family court actions, respondent did not complete qualified domestic relations orders and submit filings in a timely manner.Â  Respondent did not respond to his clientsâ€™ inquiries which caused delays and, in some instances, prejudice to the rights of his clients.Â  \r\nThe Criminal Matters\r\nIn two matters, respondent took fees for criminal representations he did not complete.Â  In a third matter, respondent did not consult with his client before accepting the solicitorâ€™s offer to resolve a pending criminal charge and did not return the clientâ€™s file upon request, thereby causing difficulties with his clientâ€™s defense.Â  \r\nThe Client Abandonment Matter\r\nIn late March 2003, respondent was admitted to a rehabilitation center for alcohol abuse for approximately three weeks.Â  Upon his release from the center, respondent spent the weekend with his family and then left town, leaving no forwarding address, no notice to his clients, and no instructions.Â  Respondent withdrew approximately $4,000 of client funds from his escrow account prior to his departure and used these funds for his own purposes.Â  Respondent made no arrangements for his clients.Â  Â Â \r\nSubsequently, respondent was placed on interim suspension by the Court.Â  See Footnote 1.Â  Since that time, respondent has had difficulties in recovery and has attempted suicide.Â  \r\nOn March 23, 2004, respondent effectively completed a six month recovery program.Â  He is continuing his outpatient efforts and is currently employed in the construction field.Â  \r\n_______\r\nRespondent has fully cooperated with ODC in connection with this matter.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep clients informed); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not charge excessive fee); Rule 1.15\r\n(lawyer shall promptly deliver to client any funds or other property to which client is entitled; lawyer shall keep client funds separate from his own funds); Rule 1.16 (lawyer shall withdraw from representation if his physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyerâ€™s ability to represent the client); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall expedite litigation consistent with interests of client); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice).[2]\r\nÂ In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  The suspension shall be retroactive to the date respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  ODC shall 1) determine the amount of restitution owed to respondentâ€™s clients and others who have been harmed as a result of respondentâ€™s misconduct and 2) institute a meaningful restitution plan.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender his certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n INDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] On April 30, 2003, respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Norton, 365 S.C. 284, 618 S.E.2d 295 (2003).Â  \r\n[2] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Â§ 44-53-370(b)(2002).Â  On February 18, 2005, he pled guilty and was sentenced to five years imprisonment and fined $12,500.00, suspended upon payment of $2,000.00 and three years probation with certain conditions.[1]Â  \r\nODC is informed respondent cooperated with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the State Grand Jury.Â  To the best of its knowledge, ODC states respondent has cooperated with its investigation.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).[2]Â Â Â  Respondent further admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline for a lawyer to be convicted of a serious crime or crime of moral turpitude); and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year.Â  Respondentâ€™s request that the suspension be applied retroactively to the date of his interim suspension is denied.[3]Â  Within fifteen days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit demonstrating he has complied with the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] As indicated during the plea proceeding, sometime around January 2003, respondent began purchasing or receiving cocaine from attorney Todd Anthony Strich and others in increments ranging from one-quarter gram to three or four grams at a time.Â  Respondent used most of the cocaine himself, but would occasionally provide it to Strich, attorney Tara Anderson Thompson, and others.Â  Respondent represented that, on several occasions, he and others pooled their money to purchase cocaine; he stated he did not profit from the transactions.Â  Respondent estimated that, during the period from approximately January 2003 until April 2004, he received approximately twenty to thirty grams of cocaine from his sources.Â  \r\n[2] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n[3] On May 24, 2004, respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Cook, 359 S.C. 81, 597 S.E.2d 141 (2004).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26068","title":"In the Matter of Todd Anthony Strich","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26068","description":"This is a disciplinary matter in which the Court imposed a definite suspension.","date":"2005-11-21","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Todd Anthony\r\nStrich, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26068\r\nSubmitted September 27, 2005 - Filed November 21, 2005\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B.

Â§ 44-53-370(b)(2002).Â  On February 18, 2005, he pled guilty and was sentenced to three years imprisonment and fined $12,500.00, suspended upon payment of $1,000.00 and two years probation with certain conditions.[1]Â  \r\nODC is informed respondent cooperated with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the State Grand Jury.Â  To the best of its knowledge, ODC states respondent has cooperated with its investigation.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).[2]Â Â Â  Respondent further admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline for a lawyer to be convicted of a serious crime or crime of moral turpitude); and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year.Â  Respondentâ€™s request that the suspension be applied retroactively to the date of his interim suspension is denied.[3]Â  Within fifteen days of the filing of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit demonstrating he has complied with the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] As indicated during the plea proceeding, on February 24, 2004, respondent sold 2.25 grams of cocaine to an undercover operative working for the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) for $160.00. This transaction occurred near the Indigo Creek apartment complex in Charleston.Â  On March 11, 2004, respondent sold 2.26 grams of cocaine to an undercover operative working for SLED in the parking lot of a â€œChuck E. Cheeseâ€ restaurant located on Sam Rittenburg Boulevard in Charleston.\r\nOn March 29, 2004, SLED agents approached respondent and, after waiving his rights, respondent admitted receiving a total of approximately 25 grams of cocaine from one of his cocaine sources during the period of March 2003 through approximately August 2003.Â  Although respondent used some of the cocaine himself, he distributed the majority to others, including attorneys Tara Anderson and Damon Cook, who often provided respondent with money to purchase the cocaine.\r\n[2] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n[3] On May 24, 2004, respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Strich, 359 S.C. 83, 597 S.E.2d 781 (2004).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26069","title":"In the Matter of Tara Anderson Thompson","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26069","description":"This is a disciplinary opinin in which the Court disbarred an attorney.","date":"2005-11-21","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Tara\r\nAnderson Thompson, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26069\r\nSubmitted September 27, 2005 - Filed November 21, 2005\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert E.

Â§ 44-53-370(b)(2002).Â  On February 18, 2005, she pled guilty and was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and fined $12,500.00, suspended upon payment of $2,000.00 and three years probation with certain conditions.[1]Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent represented Client A, a defendant who was in arrears on child support payments.Â  Client Aâ€™s mother made a partial payment of $1,000.00 on behalf of Client A and respondent arranged for the plaintiff to execute an affidavit that she had received the payment.Â  The plaintiff executed the affidavit.Â  \r\nThereafter, respondent altered the affidavit by â€œwhitening outâ€ the $1,000.00 figure and entering the full amount of Client Aâ€™s arrearage.Â  At the hearing, respondent represented to the court that full payment had been made by or on behalf of Client A and offered the affidavit in support of that representation.Â  The court did not accept the affidavit and required the plaintiff to be present to testify.Â  \r\nAt a subsequent hearing, the plaintiff testified that $1,000.00 had been the amount shown on the affidavit when she signed it.Â  It was discovered during this hearing that the original amount had been â€œwhited outâ€ and that a different amount had been written in.Â  \r\nRespondent denied having altered the affidavit in her response to ODCâ€™s Notice of Full Investigation and, again, during her Rule 19(c)(4) interview, but now acknowledges that she did alter the affidavit and her representations to the contrary were not correct.\r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent was scheduled to appear in magistrateâ€™s court for a trial at 2:00 p.m.Â  Respondentâ€™s secretary telephoned the magistrateâ€™s office at approximately 12:15 p.m. and said she was unsure respondent would be able to attend the trial.Â  Respondentâ€™s secretary was instructed to call back after 1:00 to speak with a certain member of the judgeâ€™s staff.Â  Respondentâ€™s secretary called as instructed and reported that respondent would not be able to attend due to a sick child.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe magistrate was informed of respondentâ€™s secretaryâ€™s call and called the secretary.Â  The judge denied a continuance because this was the third time respondent had called requesting a continuance just prior to the hearing.Â  \r\nAfter swearing the jury, the judge was notified that respondent wanted to speak with him by telephone.Â  The judge informed respondent that the continuance was denied and gave his reasons for the ruling.Â  The judge reported respondent became upset and began using profane language toward him and continued to do so despite five or six requests to refrain from such conduct.Â  The judge eventually ended the conversation by hanging up the telephone.Â  Respondent acknowledges being upset with the judgeâ€™s denial of the continuance and to using obscenities in her conversation with the judge.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nAfter receiving an unfavorable ruling in court, respondent raised her voice while being addressed by the judge.Â  The judge\r\nadmonished respondent to lower her voice or be held in contempt.Â  Shortly after respondent left the courtroom, a loud thumping noise was heard along the wall bordering the jury box.Â  The noise startled the entire court, including the jury.Â  \r\nUpon hearing the commotion, the judge ordered a bailiff to bring the person causing the disturbance into the courtroom.Â  Respondent was brought in and gave the explanation that she stomped her foot in an attempt to reseat the heel on her shoe and denied intentionally disrupting the court.Â  A sheriffâ€™s deputy who was present in the hallway gave a written statement that he saw respondent kick the wall in the hallway and heard respondent call the judge a â€œgod damn asshole.â€Â  Â Â \r\nIn response to ODC, respondent denied using the term â€œgod damnâ€ but acknowledged calling the judge an â€œassholeâ€ under her breath.Â  Respondent further explained her heel came loose so she stamped the heel of her shoe back against the wall twice.Â  \r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent represented Client B on a probation revocation matter.Â  On the day before the scheduled hearing, respondent requested a continuance on the grounds that she was required to be in federal court, but did not confirm whether the continuance was granted.Â  The hearing went forward and Client Bâ€™s probation was revoked.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent represented Client C on a charge of driving under the influence.Â  Client C alleges court was scheduled on four occasions, that he appeared as required, but that respondent did not appear at any time.Â  He further alleges respondent did not inform him that she was not able to appear.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that Client Câ€™s matter had been scheduled for court on a number of occasions but that she was required to be in a court of higher jurisdiction and that, in any event, the delays were ultimately in Client Câ€™s best interest.Â  Respondent further represents that she thought Client C had been notified of the conflicts but acknowledges that, in the press of business, such notification may not have been sent.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nRespondent represented Client D on various traffic charges pending in Charleston Municipal Court.Â  Respondent made inconsistent statements to the prosecutor concerning receipt of notice of certain court proceedings and requests for continuances.Â  Client Dâ€™s case was removed from the jury roster after it became apparent respondent failed to appear.Â  \r\nMatter VIII\r\nRespondent ordered a transcript from a court reporter.Â  She failed to pay for the transcript.Â Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by her misconduct, she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 3.1 (lawyer shall not assert an issue unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with interests of client); Rule 3.3 (lawyer shall not make false statement of fact to tribunal); Rule 3.4 (lawyer shall not unlawfully alter a document having potential evidentiary value; lawyer shall not falsify evidence); Rule 3.5 (lawyer shall not engage in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal); Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client, lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).[2]Â Â  Respondent further admits that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline for a lawyer to be convicted of a serious crime or crime of moral turpitude); and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  Respondentâ€™s request that the disbarment be made retroactive to the date she was placed on interim suspension is denied.[3]Â Â Â  \r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender her Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\n DISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] As indicated during the plea proceeding, respondent â€œhiredâ€ attorney Todd Anthony Strich sometime around April 2003 to work in her law office in Charleston County.Â  (ODC asserts Strich did not actually work for respondent but that respondent shared her office space at no cost in exchange for Strich attending some hearings for respondent and rendering other legal assistance when necessary).Â  Sometime after this arrangement began, respondent began purchasing cocaine from Strich in amounts ranging from one to three and one-half grams.Â  From April 2003 to April 2004, respondent received approximately eight grams of cocaine a month from Strich and others.Â  The cocaine was used by respondent and others.Â  Although respondent never accompanied Strich or others to buy cocaine, on approximately twenty occasions she pooled her money with him and with others so that cocaine could be purchased.Â  \r\n[2] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n[3] On May 24, 2004, respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Thompson, 359 S.C. 82, 597 S.E.2d 141 (2004).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct =

County of Charleston, 360 S.C. 390, 602 S.E.2d 39 (2004) (Brackenbrook I), the parties cross-appealed from a number of circuit court orders, including one denying Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss the matter pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-3390 (2000 and Supp. 2003).Â  We found this issue dispositive of both appeals, and â€œreverse[d] the circuit court orders and remand[ed] this matter with instructions to dismiss the suit without prejudice to [Appellantsâ€™] rights to pursue their refund requestsâ€ through administrative remedies.Â  Id. at 399, 602 S.E.2d at 44-45.Â  Following this disposition of the appeals, the Court ordered the following extraordinary relief to, as Appellants characterize them in their brief, â€œwronged non-party taxpayers:â€\r\n\r\nWe are deeply concerned that other taxpayers within the class certified by the circuit court judge in this case may have forgone their administrative remedies in reliance on the orders issued in this case.Â  For this reason, and because County concedes, as it must, that it is required to return the unlawfully collected taxes, we instruct that all taxpayers within the class who have not yet filed administrative refund actions shall have 120 days after the remittitur is sent to file such claims.Â  Notice of this right shall be given to all eligible taxpayers, in writing, by County within thirty days of the filing of this opinion.\r\n\r\nId. at 399-400, 602 S.E.2d at 45.\r\nAfter the remittitur in Brackenbrook I was returned to the circuit court, Appellants filed a â€œPetition and Motion for Award of Attorneysâ€™ Feesâ€ and a â€œMotion to Shorten Time and Determine Compliance with Supreme Court Order.â€ Â The Compliance Motion sought to have the circuit court decide whether Respondents had properly identified and notified all eligible non-party taxpayers as required by this Court in Brackenbrook I; to determine whether Respondents had accurately calculated the amount of the refunds; to determine when those refunds would be received; and to hear any other issues which might arise from the implementation of this Courtâ€™s order requiring Respondents to give notice.\r\nOn November 16, 2004, a circuit court order was filed which implemented this Courtâ€™s mandate in Brackenbrook I by dismissing Appellantsâ€™ suit without prejudice pursuant to Â§ 12-60-3390.Â  Several days later, the circuit court issued an order denying Appellantsâ€™ request for attorneysâ€™ fees and their Compliance Motion, finding that the â€œcase is ended and the action concludedâ€ by the November 16, 2004 dismissal order.Â  Appellants appeal from this order.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1)\r\n         Whether the circuit court properly dismissed Appellantsâ€™ motion for attorneysâ€™ fees?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2)&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the circuit court properly declined to entertain Appellantsâ€™ motion to determine compliance with our order?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  Attorneysâ€™ Fees\r\nAppellantsâ€™ requests for attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (2005)[1] was dismissed by the circuit court, apparently because the court concluded that once the underlying civil action had been dismissed, it no longer had jurisdiction over the request.Â  Appellants contend this was error, and we agree.Â  Under the fee shifting statutes at issue here, [2] a request for attorneysâ€™ fees shall be made â€œwithin thirty days following final disposition of the case.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-310 (2005).Â  Where there has been an appeal, â€œfinal disposition of the caseâ€ occurs when the remittitur is filed in the circuit court.Â  McDowell v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Serv., 300 S.C. 24, 386 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Appellantsâ€™ attorneysâ€™ fees request was made within thirty days of the circuit courtâ€™s filing of the Brackenbrook I remittitur and was therefore timely under Â§ 15-77-310.\r\nThe circuit court erred in finding it lacked jurisdiction to consider Appellantsâ€™ statutory attorneysâ€™ fees request.Â  Jurisdiction over the case vests in the circuit court upon receipt of the remittitur from the appellate court.Â  See e.g. Martin v. Paradise Cove Marina, Inc., 348 S.C. 379, 559 S.E.2d 348 (Ct. App. 2001) (jurisdiction of the circuit court to hear matters related to case after the issuance of remittitur is well-established).Â  We find, however, that Appellants cannot show prejudice warranting reversal stemming from the circuit courtâ€™s error.Â  \r\nSection 15-77-300 permits the prevailing party in a civil action to recover attorneysâ€™ fees from an opposing political subdivision party under certain conditions.Â  Attorneysâ€™ fees may be awarded if the court finds the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim, and if there are no special circumstances that would make an attorneyâ€™s fee award unjust.Â  Id.Â  Here, the â€œclaimâ€ pressed by Respondents in Brackenbrook I was that the circuit court was not the proper forum for adjudicating Appellantsâ€™ tax refund request, the very issue upon which Respondents prevailed on appeal.Â  Appellants cannot meet the statutory requirement of demonstrating that Respondents acted without substantial justification.[3]Â  Accordingly, they are not entitled to reversal on this ground.Â  Owners Ins. Co. v. Clayton, 364 S.C. 555, 614 S.E.2d 611 (2005) (error without prejudice does not require this Court to reverse).Â  \r\nB.Â  Motion to Shorten Time and Determine Compliance\r\nAppellants contend that upon receipt of the remittitur, the circuit court was vested with authority to enforce this Courtâ€™s mandate in Brackenbrook I.Â  We agree.Â  E.g., Martin v. Paradise Cove, supra. The mandate is the â€œ[o]fficial mode of communicating judgment of appellate court to lower court, directing action to be taken or disposition to be made of cause by trial court.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 867 (5th Ed. 1978).Â  Here, the â€˜disposition of the causeâ€™ was the dismissal of Appellantsâ€™ suit without prejudice since it had been brought in the wrong forum. Â On the other hand, our instruction to Respondents to promptly notify all affected taxpayers[4] who had not already brought an administrative action of their right to a refund was not a part of Appellantsâ€™ cause, and thus not a part of our mandate.Â  It was instead a directive to a party to take action for the benefit of non-parties.Â  \r\nThe notification requirement originated with this Court in an effort to treat non-parties fairly, and to expedite the refunds due them.Â  Respondentsâ€™ failure to comply with this directive would offend this Court, not the circuit court.Â  If a person within the class created by our directive were aggrieved by Respondentsâ€™ failure to comply with it, then her remedy would be a Rule to Show Cause filed in this Court.\r\nThe circuit court did not err in finding it lacked jurisdiction over\r\nAppellantsâ€™ â€œMotion to Shorten Time and Determine Compliance with Supreme Court Order.â€ \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court properly declined to entertain Appellantsâ€™ Motion to Shorten Time and Determine Compliance.Â  While it erred in refusing to hear Appellantsâ€™ motion for a statutory attorneysâ€™ fee, Appellants cannot demonstrate any resulting prejudice.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Appellants also sought to recover attorneysâ€™ fees under a â€œcommon fundâ€ theory.Â  See e.g. Petition of Crum, 196 S.C. 528, 14 S.E.2d 21 (1941) (under certain circumstances court has equitable jurisdiction to award an attorneyâ€™s fee to a party creating or preserving a common fund).Â  At oral argument, however, Appellants informed the Court they were no longer pursuing this theory as the basis for a fee award.\r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-77-300 through -340 (2005).\r\n[3] We do not suggest that Respondentsâ€™ conduct throughout this entire tax fiasco has been â€˜substantially justified.â€™Â  The statutory attorneysâ€™ fees relate to the civil action only, where Respondentsâ€™ defense was successful.\r\n[4] Appellants, having already filed for an administrative refund, were not beneficiaries of the Courtâ€™s notification directive to Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26071","title":"State v.

Pascoe, Jr., of Summerville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n___________\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant was charged with murder and third-degree arson.Â  The jury found appellant guilty as charged and he was sentenced to death for the murder charge and a ten-year imprisonment term for the arson charge.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 17, 2001, Kandee Martinâ€™s (victimâ€™s) body was found in the trunk of her burned car.Â  She had been shot to death before being placed in the trunk.\r\nThe previous day, several people gathered at Hank Kogerâ€™s house to socialize and drink alcohol.Â  Appellant, who was wearing black pants, arrived at Kogerâ€™s house around 11:00 a.m. that day.Â  He subsequently left to purchase meat.Â  When appellant returned, he became upset because his gun had been moved.Â  He accused James Tywan Gadson (Gadson)[1] of taking the gun out of the trash barrel located on Kogerâ€™s property.Â  Hiram Johnson intervened and told appellant he had moved the gun.Â  The gun was a .380 caliber pistol that appellant had purchased a few weeks before in the presence of Gadson and Travis Felder.Â  After retrieving his gun, appellant left Kogerâ€™s house.\r\nLater that afternoon, appellant was riding in the car of his sister, Yolanda Bowman, with another woman, Katrina West.Â  Appellant, who had a gun in his back pocket, was sitting in the back seat.Â  He instructed Yolanda to park beside the victimâ€™s car. Â At the time, the victim was speaking to a man.Â  Appellant tried to get the victimâ€™s attention, but she indicated to him that he should wait a moment.Â  The man, Yolanda, and Katrina testified as to what appellant said next.Â  The man stated that appellant said, â€œFuck waiting a minute.Â  Iâ€™m about to kill this bitch.â€Â  Yolanda stated that appellant said, â€œFuck it, that bitch.Â  That bitch be dead by dark.â€Â  Katrina stated that appellant said, â€œFuck that ride.Â  That bitch be dead by dark fall.â€Â  After appellantâ€™s comments, Yolanda drove away and appellant informed her the victim owed him money.\r\nAround 7:30 p.m. that evening, Tywan Gadson saw appellant riding with the victim in her car.Â  They stopped and appellant told Gadson to get in. Â Gadson had been drinking alcohol since 1:00 and was â€œfeeling in good shape.â€Â  The victim stopped for gas and they drove off without paying.Â  Appellant allegedly instructed the victim where to drive and instructed her to stop on Nursery Road.Â  Gadson and appellant then exited the vehicle and walked down the road while the victim remained in the car.Â  Appellant told Gadson he was going to kill the victim because she had on a wire.Â  The victim then came down the road, grabbed appellantâ€™s arm and stated she was scared.Â  At this point, a car drove by and they all jumped into the woods.Â  Then, the victim started walking to the car with appellant following her.Â  Appellant allegedly shot his gun three times.Â  Gadson stated the victim ran toward him and then stopped and faced appellant and told him to please not shoot her anymore because she had a child to take care of.Â  Gadson stated appellant shot two more times.Â  The victim fell to the ground and appellant dragged her body into the woods.Â  Gadson stated he jumped into the car.\r\nAfterwards, appellant and Gadson parked the victimâ€™s car and later retrieved Yolandaâ€™s car.Â  They then went to a store to purchase beer and went back to Kogerâ€™s house around 8:00 p.m.Â  Later, Gadson stayed at Kogerâ€™s house and appellant left.Â  Around 11:30 p.m., appellant and Hiram Johnson approached James Gadson, Gadsonâ€™s father.Â  Appellant gave him money to buy four pairs of gloves.\r\nAppellant, Gadson, Hiram Johnson, and Darian Williams, then drove to Murrayâ€™s Club in the victimâ€™s car.Â  Appellant handed out the gloves for the occupants to wear and stated he had stolen the car.Â  They reached the club around midnight.Â  Once at the club, appellant tried to sell the victimâ€™s car.Â  Appellant, according to Hiram Johnson, said, â€œI killed Kandee, heh, heh, heh.â€Â  Appellant had a gun with him while at the club.Â  They left the club an hour or two after arriving there.\r\nThree people, Carolyn Brown, Valorna Smith, and Travis Felder, left the club together.Â  They stopped by a gas station about 3:00 a.m. before proceeding to Valornaâ€™s home.Â  Not long after they were there, appellant knocked on the door and asked for Travis.Â  Travis left and came back after a few minutes.Â  He seemed normal upon his return. \r\nTravis testified appellant, who was wearing black jeans at the time, stated he needed Travisâ€™ help to park a car which turned out to be the victimâ€™s car.Â  Travis followed appellant to Nursery Road.Â  Appellant parked the car, went into the woods and pulled the victimâ€™s body out by her feet.Â  Appellant then put her body in the trunk.Â  While putting her body in the trunk, Travis saw a gun tucked into appellantâ€™s waist.Â  Appellant allegedly told Travis, â€œyou didnâ€™t think I did it, did you?â€Â  Travis testified appellant also stated, â€œI killed Kandee Martin.â€ Â Appellant lit the car on fire.Â  Travis then took appellant to his home and went back to Valornaâ€™s house.[2]\r\nA resident of Nursery Road who had previously heard gunshots was awakened late in the night by a loud noise.Â  He investigated and discovered a car on fire.Â  The fire was reported at 3:54 a.m.Â  There were .380 Winchester cartridge casings found not far from the scene.Â  The casings, a blood stain, and a shoe were located with the help of a man who had driven by and seen the victimâ€™s car stopped on the road around 8:00 p.m. the previous evening.\r\nThe next day, police arrested appellant at his wifeâ€™s house and seized his black pants.Â  His wife testified he had been wearing the pants when he arrived at the house.Â  They found a wristwatch belonging to the victim in appellantâ€™s pants.\r\nAfter the police left, appellantâ€™s wife, Dorothy Bowman, found appellantâ€™s gun in a chair in her home.Â  She allegedly gave the gun to appellantâ€™s father.Â  The next day, appellantâ€™s father, Yolanda, and appellantâ€™s other sister, Kendra, took the gun and dropped it off a bridge into the Edisto River.Â  It was later retrieved from the Edisto River and determined to be the gun that was used in the murder.\r\nThe arson investigator testified there was the presence of a heavy petroleum product on appellantâ€™s jeans, but the product was not gasoline.Â  The items found in the car had gasoline on them indicating that was the product used to start the fire.\r\nWhile the following evidence did not come out during the guilt phase, during the sentencing phase, a video was introduced during Travis Felderâ€™s testimony.Â  The video showed Travis purchasing gasoline in a gasoline can at about 3:14 a.m.Â  Appellant was not with him on the video.Â  Travis stated appellant gave him the can for the gas and told him he needed $2-3 worth.Â  When appellant set fire to the victimâ€™s car, he retrieved the gas can from Travisâ€™ car.\r\nAt the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jury found appellant guilty of murder and third-degree arson.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err by failing to instruct the jury on the substantial impairment mitigating circumstance?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.\r\n         Did the trial court err by refusing to grant a mistrial when the solicitor cross-examined a witness about the possibility of escape and did the trial court abuse its discretion by allowing the solicitor on re-cross examination of the witness to ask him about prison conditions?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.\r\n         Was the trial court without subject matter jurisdiction to try appellant for capital murder?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        IV.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err by refusing to suppress the watch and liquid material found on appellantâ€™s pants because the pants were seized during an allegedly illegal\r\n          arrest?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nDuring the sentencing phase of appellantâ€™s trial, appellant offered mitigating evidence that there was a history of heavy alcohol use on his motherâ€™s side of the family. Â In the fourth grade, he began experimenting with alcohol by stealing sips from his uncleâ€™s drinks.Â  By age 14, appellant was selling drugs and drinking on the weekends.Â  Subsequently, he was drinking every day.\r\nAt the end of the sentencing phase, appellant requested the trial court charge the mitigating circumstance that his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired.[3]Â  The State objected that evidence of this mitigating circumstance was not before the jury because appellant did not want to bring up a diagnosis, if any, regarding a mental health condition that he might have.Â  The trial court ruled the record was void of the requested mitigating factor.\r\nThe trial court charged the jury on the mitigating circumstances that appellant did not have a significant history of prior criminal convictions involving the use of violence against another person, that the jury should consider appellantâ€™s age or mentality at the time of the crime, and that the jury should consider any other non-statutory mitigating factors.\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by failing to charge the jury on the statutory mitigating circumstance regarding substantial impairment based on the evidence of appellantâ€™s history of substance abuse, the evidence appellant had been drinking the day of the murder, and the evidence of the â€œparty atmosphereâ€ throughout the day.\r\nThe trial court must submit for the juryâ€™s consideration any statutory mitigating circumstances supported by the evidence.Â  State v. Vazquez, 364 S.C. 293, 613 S.E.2d 359 (2005). Â The trial judge must make an initial determination of which statutory mitigating circumstances have evidentiary support and then allow the defendant to request any additional statutory mitigating circumstances supported in the record.Â  Id.Â  Absent a request by counsel to charge the mitigating circumstances, the issue is not preserved for review.Â  Id.Â  However, when there is evidence the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the crime, the trial court is required to submit the mitigating circumstances in Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(2), (6), and (7).Â  Id. (citing State v. Stone, 350 S.C. 442, 567 S.E.2d 244 (2002) (holding trial court is required to submit mitigating circumstances if there is evidence of intoxication regardless of whether they are requested)); see also State v. Pierce, 289 S.C. 430, 346 S.E.2d 707 (1986)[4] (evidence of voluntary intoxication is proper matter for consideration by jury in mitigation of punishment).Â  Where there is evidence the defendant was extremely intoxicated during the commission of the crime, the failure to instruct the jury on statutory mitigating circumstances (2), (6), and (7)[5] is not harmless error.Â  State v. Stone, supra.\r\nIn the present case, there was evidence presented that appellant possessed beer at different points in the day but none of the evidence indicated appellant was drinking the beer.Â  There was evidence appellant had a history of alcohol and drug abuse; however, his history is irrelevant to whether he was in fact intoxicated on the day of the murder.Â  Appellant presented no evidence he was actually intoxicated at the time of the crime.Â  The evidence indicated appellant may have been drinking that day, but this is not enough to warrant a charge to the jury for the mitigating factor outlined in Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(6).Â  See, e.g., State v. Vazquez, supra (holding that even though drinking was admitted, there was no evidence defendant was intoxicated at time crime was committed; therefore, court did not err by failing to charge the jury on mitigating circumstances relating to intoxication); State v. Drayton, 293 S.C. 417, 361 S.E.2d 329 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1079 (1988) (same).Â  Cf. State v. Young, 305 S.C. 380, 409 S.E.2d 352 (1991) (where there is evidence defendant was intoxicated at time of crime, trial judge required to submit mitigating circumstances relating to intoxication).Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s decision not to charge the jury on the mitigating circumstances relating to intoxication was not in error.\r\nII\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by refusing to grant a mistrial when the State asked James Aiken, a correctional consultant testifying on behalf of appellant, about the possibility of escape and by allowing the State, on re-cross examination, to ask Aiken about prison conditions.\r\nDuring the sentencing phase, Aiken testified that, as a consultant, he assists in the classification of prisoners and in the training of prison wardens.Â  He testified that if appellant received a life without parole sentence, then he would stay in prison until he was dead.Â  Aiken stated appellant has adjusted relatively well to jail in the past and that he could adapt to prison life in the future.Â  Aiken mentioned appellant would be kept behind gun towers, fences, bars, and concrete.\r\nOn cross-examination, Aiken testified inmates can move to less restrictive environments within prison based on their behavior.Â  He stated appellant would never be allowed in a work-release program.Â  He further stated he did not anticipate appellant being disruptive in prison.\r\nOn redirect examination by appellantâ€™s attorney, Aiken testified appellant would not be going to a â€œkiddy campâ€ or a place where he could have â€œpicnic lunches outside the gate.â€Â  Aiken stated appellant would work because the inmates are usually required to perform cheap labor to pay back society.Â  He further testified that while appellant would stay in prison for life, he could salvage his life and have redeeming qualities.\r\nOn re-cross examination by the State, Aiken repeated his testimony that appellant would never get out of prison if he received a life without parole sentence.Â  The State then asked, â€œDuring the time that you have been affiliated with the Department of Corrections of South Carolina, how many inmates have escaped?â€Â  Appellant immediately objected.Â  A bench conference was held outside the presence of the jury.Â  The State argued appellant opened the door to the testimony by eliciting testimony from Aiken that appellant â€œwill never get out of that prison.â€\r\nThe trial court concluded the escape testimony should not be presented to the jury.Â  The trial court distinguished appellantâ€™s situation from the situation in State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E.2d 619, cert. denied, Arnold v. South Carolina, 467 U.S. 1265 (1984), because Plath himself was an escapee[6] and, therefore, escape testimony was relevant in that case.Â  Appellant made a motion for mistrial of the sentencing phase based on the escape question.Â  The court denied the motion and offered to give a curative instruction instead.Â  The court instructed the jury upon their return:\r\n\r\n. . . there was a question that was asked before you left and I have ruled that the question was not a proper question and Iâ€™m going to ask you to disavow that from your minds for this reason:Â  There are two sentences that you will concern yourselves and weâ€™re going to have an opportunity during my charge to talk about them at great length, but for this moment I will tell you, and I think I am reminding you based on the instructions that you have received even preliminarily, but there are two sentences that you will concern yourselves.Â  One, the death penalty, and the other is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.Â  The statute says until the death of the defendant.Â  Those would be the two sentences that you will concern yourselves.\r\n\r\nPrior to the motion for mistrial, the State requested that, because appellant had established prison was not a â€œkiddy campâ€ and that appellant would probably not be in super maximum security, the State would like to pursue those areas by asking about certain conditions of the general population, such as the work conditions appellant had already covered.Â  The court ruled the State could do so.Â  Appellant responded, â€œWeâ€™re on recross, Judge.â€Â  The court replied that it understood, but ruled the State could go into those areas because those issues â€œare certainly before the jury at this point.â€\r\nThe re-cross examination of Aiken continued after the curative instruction was given.Â  Aiken testified appellant would not be in super maximum security and he would be able to work and earn a small amount of money.Â  Aiken testified appellant would most likely have certain opportunities in prison, such as bible study, continuing his education, participating in anger management programs, playing basketball, exercising, reading books, and watching movies and possibly television.Â  Aiken made it clear that all of these activities would occur under continuous security.\r\nMistrial due to Escape Question\r\nWe have held in the past that evidence of a prior escape is proper reply to a defendantâ€™s presentation of evidence of his good conduct while in prison.Â  See State v. Woomer, 278 S.C. 468, 299 S.E.2d 317 (1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1229 (1983).Â  We have also held that evidence the defendant was an escapee at the time he committed a murder was admissible evidence in the sentencing phase.Â  See State v. Plath, supra.Â  Appellantâ€™s situation, however, is distinguishable from Woomer and Plath in the sense that he has never been an escapee and there was no evidence he had ever attempted to escape confinement.Â  The trial court therefore properly refused to allow Aiken to answer the Stateâ€™s question.\r\nWe find the courtâ€™s curative instruction removed any prejudice because it made it clear that the question asked by the State was improper and asked the jury to disavow that question from their minds.Â  Further, the curative instruction, without mentioning the contents of the escape question again, emphasized that the jury was to be concerned with only two sentences:Â  death and life without the possibility of parole, and that life without parole meant â€œuntil the death of the defendant.â€ Â This instruction was sufficient to cure any alleged prejudice caused by the Stateâ€™s question.Â  Therefore, we hold the trial court did not err by refusing to grant a mistrial in light of its curative instruction.Â  See State v. Vazquez, 364 S.C. 293, 613 S.E.2d 359 (2005) (mistrial should be ordered only when an incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect cannot be removed).\r\nPrison Conditions Questions\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by allowing the State, on re-cross examination, to ask Aiken about prison conditions.\r\nWe find this issue is not preserved for review because appellant did not raise this issue to the trial court before the testimony was presented and did not make a contemporaneous objection when the testimony was actually elicited.Â  Further, the trial court did not rule on this issue as now stated by appellant.Â  See State v. Moore, 357 S.C. 458, 593 S.E.2d 608 (2004) (to be preserved for appeal, issue must be raised to and ruled on by trial court); State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997) (party cannot argue one ground below and then argue different ground on appeal).Â  See also State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 609 S.E.2d 520 (2005) (to preserve an issue for review there must be a\r\ncontemporaneous objection that is ruled upon by the trial court).\r\nWe take this opportunity, however, to caution the State and the defense that the evidence presented in a penalty phase of a capital trial is to be restricted to the individual defendant and the individual defendantâ€™s actions, behavior, and character.Â  Generally, questions regarding escape and prison conditions are not relevant to the question of whether a defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole.Â  We emphasize that how inmates, other than the defendant at trial, are treated in prison; and whether other inmates have escaped from prison, is inappropriate evidence in the penalty phase of a capital trial.Â  We admonish both the State and the defense that the penalty phase should focus solely on the defendant and any evidence introduced in the penalty phase should be connected to that particular defendant.\r\nIII\r\nAppellant argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence him to death because the murder indictment did not allege an aggravating circumstance.Â  He argues that Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), holds that aggravating factors are elements of the offense of capital murder that must be charged in the indictment.\r\nWe have recently addressed this issue in several cases.Â  See State v. Crisp, 362 S.C. 412, 608 S.E.2d 429 (2005) (under South Carolina law, aggravating circumstances need not be alleged in murder indictment); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 135, 607 S.E.2d 57 (2004), cert. denied, Â Â Â Â Â U.S. Â Â Â Â , 125 S.Ct. 2942 (2005) (same); State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 604 S.E.2d 377 (2004) (same).Â  As stated in those cases, the aggravating factors enumerated in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a) (2003) are sentencing factors, not elements of murder, and they need not be in the indictment.Â  Therefore, the instant indictment is valid.\r\nIV\r\nAppellant argues his pants were seized during an illegal warrantless arrest and that the watch and liquid material found in and on the pants should have been suppressed.\r\nThe murder occurred in Dorchester County.Â  Appellant was arrested, on February 17, 2001, at his wifeâ€™s home in Orangeburg County pursuant to an Orangeburg County arrest warrant for receiving stolen goods that was issued on December 1, 2000.\r\nOn the morning following the murder, several officers went to the residence of appellantâ€™s wife, Dorothy.Â  The officers present were a Branchville police officer, an Orangeburg County deputy, and two officers from Dorchester County.Â  The Branchville officer testified that, although he did not have the original, he had a certified copy of the Orangeburg County warrant and that the officers went to Dorothyâ€™s house[7] pursuant to that warrant.Â  He further testified Dorothy invited him into the house and he stepped inside and told her they were looking for appellant.Â  He stated he showed Dorothy a copy of the arrest warrant.Â  Dorothy replied to him that she did not know where appellant was and indicated it was okay for the officers to look around.Â  The Branchville officer stated he did not pull out a consent to search form before searching Dorothyâ€™s home.\r\nDorothy confirmed the officers said they had a warrant and that she stated the officers could come in and search her home.Â  Dorothy testified she let the officers in voluntarily and they had her permission to search the home.\r\nAppellant was found hiding behind a bed.Â  He was arrested pursuant to the receiving stolen goods warrant at that time and was transported to the Branchville Police Department.Â  At the time of his arrest, appellant was wearing only underwear and he asked for his clothes.Â  Before his wife could give him his black pants, an officer intervened to search the pants.Â  The officer wanted to check the pants for weapons for safety purposes.Â  When the officer found a ladyâ€™s watch inside the pants, the officer decided the pants needed to be confiscated.\r\nAppellant argues the trial court should have suppressed the evidence seized at Dorothyâ€™s home because the arrest was unlawful and because Dorothy had not consented to the search.\r\nInitially, the State argues this issue is not preserved for review because appellant did not renew his objection to the evidence when it was received at trial.\r\nIn most cases, making a motion in limine to exclude evidence at the beginning of trial does not preserve the issue for review because a motion in limine is not a final determination.Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d 837 (2001); State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1277 (1997) (same).Â  The moving party must make a contemporaneous objection when the evidence is introduced.Â  Id.Â  An exception to this rule is where a\r\njudge makes a ruling on the admission of evidence on the record immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question.Â  In that case, the aggrieved party does not need to renew the objection.Â  State v. Forrester, supra. \r\nAppellant did not renew his objection when the evidence of the watch found inside the pants and the petroleum on the pants was introduced.Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision to allow the evidence was not made immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.\r\nDespite the lack of preservation, we will address the merits.Â  When reviewing a Fourth Amendment search and seizure case, an appellate court must affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling if there is any evidence to support the ruling.Â  State v. Missouri, 361 S.C. 107, 603 S.E.2d 594 (2004).Â  The appellate court will reverse only when there is clear error.Â  Id.\r\nAppellant was legally arrested pursuant to a valid warrant.Â  The record indicates a warrant for receiving stolen goods had been issued prior to appellantâ€™s arrest and that the arresting officer, while possibly not in possession of the warrant itself, was acting pursuant to the warrant when the arrest was made.Â  Consequently, the trial court did not err by refusing the motion to suppress on this ground.Â  See State v. Holmes, 320 S.C. 259, 464 S.E.2d 334 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1248 (1996) (arrest of defendant properly made and clothes seized from defendant at time of arrest could be admitted in murder prosecution, where warrant had been issued prior to arrest and arresting officer was acting pursuant to warrant, even though warrant not physically in officerâ€™s possession); State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1103 (1992) (arresting officer who was aware but not in possession of valid arrest warrants was authorized to enter motel room to make arrest).\r\nFurther, appellant argues the motion to suppress should have been granted because his wife did not consent to the search of her home.Â  This argument is without merit because appellantâ€™s wife specifically testified she gave the officers permission to enter and search the home.Â  There is no evidence to support appellantâ€™s assertion.Â  Cf. Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204 (1981) (warrantless searches of a home are impermissible absent consent or exigent circumstances).\r\nAdditionally, the search of appellantâ€™s pants and the seizure of those pants and the watch were permissible as a search incident to arrest.Â  After being arrested, appellant requested that he be allowed to put on his pants.Â  However, before being given the pants, the officer determined the pants should be searched for â€œsafety purposes.â€Â  This search was reasonable.Â  See Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969) (ample justification for a search of arresteeâ€™s person and area within his immediate control, that is, the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence); State v. Crowe, 258 S.C. 258, 188 S.E.2d 379, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1077 (1972) (same).Â  See also State v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581, 347 S.E.2d 882 (1986) (search may be conducted incident to an arrest only if it is substantially contemporaneous with the arrest and is confined to the immediate vicinity of the arrest).\r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err by refusing to suppress the evidence as requested by appellant.Â  See State v. Missouri, supra (appellate court must affirm trial courtâ€™s ruling if there is any evidence to support the ruling).\r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nUnder State law, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(3) (2003) requires us to determine in a death case â€œ[w]hether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.â€Â  There is no requirement the sentence be proportional to any particular case; however, death sentences have been imposed in similar cases.Â  See State v. Binney, 362 S.C. 353, 608 S.E.2d 418, cert. denied, 2005 WL 1333888 (2005); State v.

Vaught, individually and\r\nas trustee for several relatives (Appellants), raises the issue of whether the trial court erred in excluding evidence of replacement costs as part of the measure of damages for destroyed noncommercial trees.Â  We certified this case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and conclude the trial court erred in excluding evidence of the measure of damages.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial. Â \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellants own a 754-acre tract of land in Horry County which they use primarily for hunting and family picnics.Â  A few days prior to May 28, 2002, employees of A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc. (Respondent) burned debris for construction of Highway 31 on land adjacent to Appellantsâ€™ property.Â  On May 28, windy conditions reignited a smoldering pile of debris, and embers were blown into neighboring woods.Â  The resulting fire burned approximately 21 acres of Appellantsâ€™ tract, destroying an historic tar kiln and more than 1,200 trees, including 116 live oaks. \r\nOn January 13, 2003, Appellants filed this lawsuit alleging\r\nRespondent negligently ignited a fire on real estate adjacent to their property and allowed that fire to escape onto the Appellantsâ€™ property.Â  Respondentâ€™s Motion in Limine requesting the trial court exclude testimony from Travis Cork, Appellantsâ€™ forestry consultant, was denied, and the trial judge ruled the proper measure of damages was the difference between the value of the property before and after the fire.Â  The trial judge determined the destroyed trees were relevant only to the extent their destruction diminished the overall value of the land. \r\nAppellant James Vaught testified the destruction of the tar kiln and trees devalued the land by approximately $500,000.Â  Further, the value of the burned merchantable timber was approximately $25,000, although the property had never been used for commercial purposes.Â  Cork testified he had determined the species, number, and size of the dead trees.Â  He testified the destroyed trees had little or no value as timber.Â  He proferred testimony that Appellants could be made whole by replacement of the destroyed trees.Â  Eli Adams, a nursery owner, was qualified as an expert and proferred testimony that the cost of replacing the trees was approximately $658,000, including $66,000 to replace the destroyed live oaks.\r\nJames Ryan, a forester and Respondentâ€™s witness, testified\r\nthe merchantable value of the destroyed trees was $1,070.25.Â  Ryan further testified that if the destroyed live oaks naturally resprouted, they would grow to the size of the destroyed trees in 25 to 40 years. \r\nThe trial judge charged that shade trees and certain other type trees had value only by reason of their connection to the land, and that the fair measure of damages to such property â€œis the injury to the premises as a whole, which would be fixed by ascertaining the difference between the value of the entire premises before and after the fire . . . . [T]he difference in value rule of land before and after the fire applies to undeveloped growing timber, shade and ornamental trees.â€ \r\nThe jury returned a verdict for Appellants in the amount of Â $20,000.Â  Appellants moved for a new trial absolute or for a new trial nisi additur, which were both denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by prohibiting Appellants from introducing evidence of replacement costs of destroyed noncommercial trees on property used for recreational purposes?Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the\r\njurisdiction of this Court extends merely to the correction of errors of law, and a factual finding of the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence which reasonably supports the juryâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).Â  The admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and absent a clear abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law, the trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal. Hofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736, 742 (1989).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467, 611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005); Carlyle v. Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, 193, 407 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1991).Â  To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the wrongly admitted or excluded evidence.Â  Conner, 363 S.C. at 467, 611 S.E.2d at 908; Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1997). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in ruling the\r\nproper measure of damages for destroyed noncommercial trees on property used for recreational purposes was the value of the property before and after the fire and the trial court erred in excluding evidence of replacement costs of the destroyed trees.Â  We agree. \r\nActual damages are properly called compensatory damages, meaning to compensate, to make the injured party whole, to put him in the same position he was in prior to the damages received insofar as this is monetarily possible. See Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000).Â  The goal is to restore the injured party, as nearly as possible through the payment of money, to the same position he was in before the wrongful injury occurred. Id. at 378, 529 S.E.2d at 533. \r\nIn Hall v. Seaboard Airline Railway Co., 126 S.C. 330,\r\n332-33, 119 S.E. 910, 910-11 (1923), the Court identified two classes of property damaged by fire: \r\n\r\n(1) That which is essentially connected with the premises and has value only by reason of that connection, such as fruit trees, ornamental and shade trees and shrubs, the young growth of a forest, hedge, grass, and the like; (2) that which has a value independent and separate from the premises as such, such as buildings, fences, merchantable timber, corded or cut wood, and the like, the loss or damage to which is capable of practically exact estimation.Â  \r\n\r\nAt issue in the present case is property described in the first category.Â  Two general rules of damages have been applied to this type of property: diminution in value and restoration costs.Â  See 22 Am.Jur.2d Damages Â§ 276 (2003) (noting courts generally use the diminution in value rule for damage to shade or ornamental trees but under certain facts and circumstances replacement costs may be the proper measure of damages). [1]Â  To fully compensate the injured party, a court may allow the jury to consider more than one measure of damages, but damages may be awarded under only one theory. Id.Â  \r\nThe Restatement (Second) Torts Â§ 929 (1979) supports restoration costs as the proper measure of damages for injury to real property in certain circumstances.Â  Section 929 provides in part,&nbsp; \r\n\r\n(1) If one is entitled to a judgment for harm to land resulting from a past invasion and not amounting to a total destruction of value, the damages include compensation for (a) the difference between the value of the land before the harm and the value after the harm, or at his election in an appropriate case, the cost of restoration that has been or may be reasonably incurred . . . . \r\n\r\nComment (b) to Â§ 929 further states, \r\n\r\nEven in the absence of value arising from personal use,\r\nthe reasonable cost of replacing the land in its original position is ordinarily allowable as the measure of recovery . . . . If, however, the cost of replacing the land in its original condition is disproportionate to the diminution in the value of the land caused by the trespass, unless there is a reason personal to the owner for restoring the original condition, damages are measured only by the difference between the value of the land before and after the harm.\r\n\r\nSeveral courts cite with approval Â§ 929 of the Restatement.Â  See, e.g., Osborne v. Hurst, 947 P.2d 1356 (Alaska 1997); Dixon v. City of Phoenix, 845 P.2d 1107 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1993); Worthington v. Roberts, 803 S.W.2d 906 (Ark. 1991); Heninger v. Dunn, 162 Cal.Rptr. 104 (Cal. Ct. App. 1980); Klingshirn v. McNeal, 520 S.E.2d 761 (Ga. App. 1999);Leavitt v. Continental Tel. Co. of Maine, 559 A.2d 786 (Me. 1989); Rector, Wardens and Vestry of St. Christopherâ€™s Episcopal Church v. C.S. McCrossan, Inc., 235 N.W.2d 609 (Minn. 1975); Keitges v. VanDermeulen, 483 N.W.2d 137 (Neb. 1992); Denoyer v. Lamb, 490 N.E.2d 615 (Ohio Ct. App. 1984);Gross v. Jackson Township, 476 A.2d 974 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984); Threlfall v. Town of Muscoda, 527 N.W.2d 367 (Wis. Ct .App. 1994).Â  See also Kristine Cordier Karnezis, Annotation, Measure of Damages for Injury to or Destruction of Shade or Ornamental Tree or Shrub, 95 A.L.R.3d 508 Â§ 4 (1979 &amp; Supp. 2005) (discussing cases that allow replacement costs under certain circumstances).\r\nIn Keitges, the Nebraska Supreme Court was presented\r\n with the novel question of â€œwhether a plaintiff is entitled to recover the cost of restoring trees and vegetation on land which he holds for residential or recreational purposes when a portion of a natural woods is destroyed.â€ 483 N.W.2d at 140.Â  The Nebraska court concluded\r\nRestatement (Second) Torts Â§ 929 was consistent with a prior decision which stated that â€œthe principle underlying allowance of damages is to place the injured party in the same position, so far as money can do it, as he would have been had there been no injury or breach of duty, that is, to compensate him for the injury actually sustained.â€ Id. at 142 (quoting â€œLâ€ Investments, Ltd. v. Lynch, 322 N.W.2d 651, 656 (1982)).Â  The Nebraska court further asserted:\r\n\r\nOne personâ€™s unsightly jungle may be another personâ€™s enchanted forest; certainly the owner of such land should be allowed to enjoy it free from a trespasserâ€™s bulldozer. Indeed, a trespasser should not be allowed, with impunity, to negligently or willfully wreak havoc on a landownerâ€™s natural woods, and the landownerâ€™s attempted recovery for such injury should not be entirely frustrated by the fact that the market does not reflect his personal loss.\r\n\r\nId. at 143.Â  The court held that a landowner who intends to use land for recreational or residential purposes, may recover restoration costs, which may not exceed the market value of the property before the injury, when trees and other growth are destroyed.\r\nIn Osborne, the plaintiffs sought to recover for damaged\r\ntrees destroyed by a fire set by defendant.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment on the issue of the measure of damages for defendant and held that restoration costs were not the proper measure of damages.Â  The Supreme Court of Alaska reversed the ruling and remanded the case to determine damages in accordance with Restatement (Second) Torts Â§ 929.Â  The court had previously recognized that â€œâ€˜a plaintiff who has been injured by an invasion of his land not totally destroying its value may elect as damages either the loss in valueâ€™ or reasonable restoration costs.â€ 947 P.2d at 1358 (citing G &amp; A Contractors, Inc. v. Alaska Greenhouses, Inc., 517 P.2d 1379, 1385 (Alaska 1974)). The court also noted its prior holding that Â§ 929 should be used to determine whether restoration costs are appropriate. Id. at 1359.Â  Further, the court held that if the jury found the plaintiffs had a personal reason for restoring the property, then plaintiffs could elect restoration costs as the proper measure of damages.\r\nIn Rector, the plaintiff sought damages for defendantâ€™s\r\nnegligent suffocation of roots of shade trees on plaintiffâ€™s property.Â  That court noted: \r\n\r\nSince [1912], courts throughout the country have placed a greater emphasis on the rights of a property owner to enjoy the aesthetic value of trees and shrubbery, notwithstanding the fact they may have little commercial value or that their destruction may, indeed, even enhance the market value of the property. \r\n\r\n235 N.W.2d at 610.Â  The Minnesota Supreme Court departed from the traditional measure of damages which was diminution in value of the land and held â€œwhere trees and shrubbery have aesthetic value to the owner as ornamental and shade trees or for purposes of screening sound and providing privacy, replacement cost may be considered to the extent that the cost is reasonable and practical.â€ Id. at 611.Â  The court held the jury could consider restoration costs and the value of the land before and after the damage.Â  But see Baillon v. Carl Bolander &amp; Sons Co., 235 N.W.2d 613, 615 (Minn. S.Ct. 1975) (refusing to apply the replacement cost rule when destroyed trees were â€œfor the most part, quite small, ill-formed, and not particularly desirable as shade trees or ornamental trees but did serve to prevent erosion and act as a sound barrierâ€).\r\nThe reasoning expressed in the Restatement (Second) Torts Â§ 929, Keitges, Osborne, and Rector is persuasive on the measure of damages for damaged/destroyed noncommercial trees, shrubs, and related vegetation.Â  We adopt the following as the measure of damages:Â  The general measure of damages for damaged/destroyed noncommercial trees, shrubs, and related vegetation is the difference in the value of the entire parcel of land - damaged and undamaged portions - immediately before and after the loss. Â When the property is restorable to its former condition at a cost less than the diminution in value, then the cost of restoration that has been or may be reasonably incurred or the diminution in value may be the proper measure of damages. When the cost of restoration exceeds the diminution in value, then the greater cost of restoration will be allowed when the landowner has a personal reason relating to the land for restoring the land to its original condition and when the cost of restoration is reasonable in relation to the damage inflicted.Â  However, the landowner may not recover restoration costs which exceed the market value of the entire parcel prior to the loss.Â  See 22 Am.Jur.2d Damages Â§ 256. Â Â Further, the jury may consider factors in determining the diminution in value, including but not limited to: the types and sizes of the damaged or destroyed trees and shrubs, the purpose for which the destroyed or damaged trees and shrubs were grown or maintained, the reasonable and practicable replacement costs, and the use of the particular land, including any aesthetic value to the landowners of such trees and shrubs.Â  SeeÂ  Harper v. Morris, 365 S.E.2d 176, 177-78 (N.C. Ct. App. 1988); 75 Am.Jur.2d Damages Â§ 136. \r\nThe trial judge abused his discretion by excluding evidence\r\nof replacement costs of the destroyed noncommercial trees.Â  There is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the excluded evidence because the jury was not permitted to hear and consider all relevant evidence relating to damages. See Conner, 363 S.C. at 467, 611 S.E.2d at 908. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the trial court erred in excluding evidence of\r\nreplacement costs of the destroyed noncommercial trees and there is a reasonable probability the excluded evidence influenced the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  We decline to address Respondentâ€™s additional sustaining ground. See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (the Court in its discretion may address an additional sustaining ground).Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial in accordance with this opinion.Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  See Thatcher v. Lane Construction Co., 254 N.E.2d 703, 707 (Ohio Ct. App. 1970) (â€œThe general rule that the measure of damages for injury to real estate shall not exceed the difference in the market value of the entire tract immediately before and immediately after the injury is not an arbitrary or exact formula to be applied in every case without regard to whether its application would compensate the injured party fully for losses which are the proximate result of the wrongdoerâ€™s conduct.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
