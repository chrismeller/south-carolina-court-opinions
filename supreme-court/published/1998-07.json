OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoffatt G. McDonald, of Haynsworth, Marion, McKay\r\n&amp; Gu&eacute;rard, L.L.P., of Greenville, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n WALLER, A.J.: In 1992, respondent TNS Mills, Inc. filed\r\namended tax returns for tax years 1985 through 1991 asking for exemptions\r\nfor its pollution control equipment.  After a hearing, the Commission of the\r\nDepartment of Revenue1 refused TNS's request.  The circuit court reversed\r\nthe Commission's decision.  This appeal is from the order of the circuit court,\r\nWe reverse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTS \r\n  \r\n TNS operates greige mills in Spartanburg and Cherokee Counties.  TNS\r\nwas entitled to an exemption for pollution control equipment for the tax years\r\n1986 through 1991 pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-220(A)(8) (Supp. 1980-\r\n1992).  Property tax returns have a line on which taxpayers report certain\r\npollution control equipment in order to have that amount exempted from the\r\nassessed value of their property.  On its tax returns for 1986 through 1991,\r\nTNS left these lines blank. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Pollution control equipment typically forms an integral part of the\r\nproduction process in a greige mill; therefore, assigning a separate value to\r\na greige mill's pollution control equipment is difficult.  To remedy this\r\nproblem, the South Carolina Textile Manufacturer's Association (SCTMA) and\r\nthe Department negotiated and agreed in the mid-1980s that the Department\r\nwould reduce the assessed value of greige mills by 20%.  TNS was not a\r\nmember of the SCTMA, and the Department reproachably did not publish the\r\npolicy, so TNS was unaware of the 20% compromise.  The Department\r\nassessed TNS's greige mills at 100% of their value throughout the late 1980s. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In 1992, TNS filed amended property tax returns with the Department\r\nclaiming a property tax exemption for pollution control equipment for tax \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Until its name was changed in 1993, the Department was known as\r\nthe South Carolina Tax Commission.  In 1993, it became the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Revenue and Taxation, and in 1996, its name was shortened\r\nto the South Carolina Department of Revenue.  Until February 1, 1995, the\r\nDepartment was governed by three Commissioners.  To avoid confusion, this\r\nopinion will refer to the agency as the Department and the three men who\r\ninitially heard the case as the Commission. \r\n  \r\np.4\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears 1986 through 1991.  The Property Division of the Department (Property\r\nDivision) granted the exemptions and mailed amended assessment notices to\r\nSpartanburg and Cherokee Counties, thereby reducing the assessed value of\r\nTNS's mills and entitling TNS to a refund.  Spartanburg County issued TNS\r\na refund in excess of $400,000.  Cherokee County (County) and Cherokee\r\nCounty School District Number I (School District) opposed the granting of the\r\nexemptions and appealed to the Commission.  After a hearing, the\r\nCommission determined TNS was not entitled to the retroactive property tax\r\nexemptions it was trying to claim.  On appeal, the circuit court reversed the\r\ndecision of the Commission.  County, School District, and Department,\r\nreferred to collectively hereafter as appellants, are appealing this decision.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n ISSUES \r\n  \r\nI.    Did TNS fulfill the statutory requirements for applying for the pollution\r\n control exemption when it filed its original tax returns? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII.   Did the Department have the authority under section 12-4-730 of the\r\n South Carolina Code to grant TNS a retroactive exemption? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIII.  Does section 12-37-975 of the Code give the Department the authority\r\n to grant a retroactive exemption? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIV.   Does section 12-47-420 of the Code allow a refund? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nV.    Did the Commission's decision violate equal protection? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nVI.   Did the Commission err when it refused to let James Brodie testify? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nVII.  Was the 20% policy a valid exercise of the Department's authority? \r\n  \r\n DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI     Original tax returns \r\n  \r\n The circuit court found TNS did in fact timely apply for the exemptions\r\nfor pollution control equipment by merely signing its tax returns for the years\r\nin question.  Appellants argue this was error.  We agree. \r\n  \r\n\r\n2The only issue about which appellants and appellant/respondent\r\ndisagree is whether the 20% policy was a valid exercise of the Department's\r\nauthority.  With regard to this issue, the Department is a respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.5\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Initially, this issue should not have been addressed by the circuit court\r\nbecause TNS admitted in its brief to the Commission that it filed its tax\r\nreturns for the years in question without claiming an exemption for pollution\r\ncontrol equipment.  An issue conceded in a lower court may not be argued\r\non appeal. Ex parte McMillan, 319 S.C. 331, 461 S.E.2d 43 (1995).\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court erred when it considered this issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n If the issue had been disputed, the findings of the circuit court would\r\nbe erroneous.  The General Assembly has the power to provide for methods\r\nand procedures in applying for exemptions for the purpose of property taxes,\r\nS.C. Const. Art. X, Â§ 3. According to the General Assembly, a taxpayer does\r\nnot automatically get an exemption for pollution control equipment, but must\r\napply for it.  During the tax years in question and at the time TNS filed its\r\namended returns, a taxpayer was required to file an application before the\r\nsixteenth day of the fourth month after the close of the accounting period\r\nregularly employed by the taxpayer for income tax purposes to claim an\r\nexemption for pollution control equipment.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-4-720 (Supp.\r\n1991-1992) (amended in 1994 and 1995); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-3-145(B) (Supp,\r\n1985-1990) (repealed 1991).  The Department was required to determine\r\nannually which exemptions it would grant and notify the appropriate county\r\nofficials by June first of each year.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-4-710 (Supp. 1991-\r\n1992); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-3-145(A) (Supp. 1985-1990) (repealed 1991). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The burden is on claimants to prove their rights to an exemption by\r\nbringing themselves clearly within the conditions imposed by the statute.\r\nYork County Fair Assoc. v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 249 S.C. 337, 341,\r\n154 S.E.2d 361, 363 (1967); see also Asmer v. Livingston, 225 S.C. 341, 82\r\nS.E.2d 465, 466 (1954)(a refund of taxes is solely a matter of governmental\r\ngrace, and taxpayers seeking such relief must bring themselves clearly within\r\nthe terms of the statute authorizing a refund).  One is estopped to claim an\r\nexemption with respect to property included in the list of taxable properties\r\nand for which no exemption has been claimed before the taxing officers. 84\r\nC.J.S. Taxation Â§ 226 (1954). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n TNS did not clearly comply with the requirements for applying for an\r\nexemption.  Taxpayers may apply for exemptions separately from their tax\r\nreturns, thereby filing two forms instead of one.  Or, as most taxpayers do,\r\nthey may apply for an exemption on their tax returns.  TNS did not file a\r\nseparate application, nor did it apply on its tax returns.  As noted above,\r\nSchedule 55, Gross Plant Account Summary, appears on TNS's filed tax\r\nforms.  This schedule instructs the taxpayer to list gross capitalized cost of\r\nseven different items in order to have their value exempted from the \r\n  \r\np.6\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxpayer's taxable property.  Item number six is \"Water &amp; Air Pollution\r\nEquip.\" In order to claim an exemption for this type of equipment, a\r\ntaxpayer must indicate the value of the equipment on line six and attach a\r\nlist of this type of equipment.  On all of its returns, TNS left item number\r\nsix blank and did not attach a list, thereby including its pollution control\r\nequipment in its taxable properties.  Clearly, TNS did not intend to apply for\r\nthis exemption when it filed its tax returns. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The tax forms filed by TNS had the following preprinted language\r\nabove the preparer's signature line: \"By filing this return within the time\r\nprescribed by law, I hereby make application for exemption from county taxes\r\nin accordance with the provisions of Section 12-37-220(A)(7)(8) Code of Laws\r\nof South Carolina.\" Relying on the presence of preprinted language, the\r\ncircuit court found, \"TNS made a request for all exemptions for pollution\r\ncontrol devices by executing this pre-printed form.\" Appellants argue this\r\nfinding is erroneous.  We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The preprinted language has effect only if the taxpayer acts as the form\r\nrequires by claiming an amount of exempted property on Schedule 55 and\r\nseparately listing property.    The presence of this language without the\r\nrequired information does not comprise an application for an exemption.\r\nFurthermore, testimony at the hearing revealed the purpose of the preprinted\r\nlanguage was not to give the exemption to every taxpayer who signed a\r\nreturn, but to enable a taxpayer to apply for an exemption and file tax\r\nreturns with the same form. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Accordingly, the lower court should not have decided this issue, and its\r\nfinding that TNS timely filed exemption applications for tax years 1986\r\nthrough 1991 was erroneous because TNS's tax filings were too incomplete\r\nto clearly satisfy the requirements of the code. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII.   Authority to grant retroactive exemptions \r\n  \r\n The circuit court found the plain language and the history of S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 12-4-730 (Supp. 1992) gave the Department the authority to grant\r\nretroactive exemptions.  Appellants argue this was error.  We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA.    Plain Language\r\n Section 12-4-730 states,\r\n The [Department], upon receipt of an application and upon proper \r\n  \r\np.7\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestigation, may declare the real and personal property of a\r\nproperty owner qualifying for an exemption from ad valorem\r\ntaxation identified in this chapter as exempt and shall certify the\r\nexemption to the auditor's office in the county in which the\r\nproperty is located.  Upon certification by the [Department], the\r\nauditor shall void any tax notice applicable to the property. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. 12-4-730 (Supp. 1992).  In construing statutory language, the\r\nstatute must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of the same\r\ngeneral statutory law must be construed together and each one given effect.\r\nHiggins v. State, 307 S.C. 446, 415 S.E.2d 799 (1992).  The Court must\r\npresume the legislature did not intend a futile act, but rather intended its\r\nstatutes to accomplish something. State ex rel.  McLeod v. Montgomery, 244\r\nS.C. 308, 136 S.E.2d 778 (1964).  The language of a tax exemption statute\r\nmust be given its plain, ordinary meaning and must be strictly construed\r\nagainst the claimed exemption. John D. Hollingsworth On Wheels, Inc. v.\r\nGreenville County Treasurer, 276 S.C. 314, 278 S.E.2d 340 (1981). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n TNS asserts the lack of deadline in section 12-4-730 means the\r\nDepartment can grant retroactive exemptions.  However, this section must\r\nbe read together with the other sections in Article 7, and nothing in this\r\nsection modifies section 12-4-720(A)(2)'s mandatory deadline for applying for\r\nan exemption.3 In fact, if 12-4-730 is interpreted as allowing retroactive\r\nexemptions, the mandatory deadlines set by the General Assembly are\r\nrendered meaningless.  As the Commission noted, \"[T]here would be no\r\npurpose in establishing deadlines if failure to meet them was of no\r\nconsequence.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Furthermore, an interpretation allowing retroactive exemptions would\r\nnot fit with the procedural scheme set out by the General Assembly.  The\r\nCode requires the Department to make annual determinations concerning\r\nexemptions and to notify the appropriate county officials of what property \r\n  \r\n\r\n3Section 12-4-720(A)(2) (Supp. 1991-1992) states, \"Owners of property\r\nexempt under [the pollution control exemption] shall file an application\r\nbefore the sixteenth day of the fourth month after the close of the accounting\r\nperiod regularly employed by the taxpayer for income tax purposes. . . .\"\r\n(emphasis added).  Ordinarily, the use of the word \"shall\" in a statute means\r\nthat the action referred to is mandatory. South Carolina Dep't of Highways\r\nand Pub.  Transp. v. Dickinson, 288 S.C. 189, 191, 341 S.E.2d 134, 135 (1986).\r\nThe plain language is clear; a taxpayer is required to apply for the exemption\r\nby the stated deadline. \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas exempted from taxation by June first.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-4-710 (Supp.\r\n1992).  The interpretation advanced by TNS would negate the purpose of\r\nnotifying county officials by June first because the information given them\r\nwould be worthless; the amount of exempted property, would change every\r\ntime the Department granted a retroactive exemption. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The plain language of these Code sections, when read together, show\r\nthe legislature intended to set clear deadlines for applying for exemptions as\r\npart of an overall plan to enable counties and school districts to plan budgets\r\nfor each fiscal year.  Any interpretation allowing the Department to grant\r\nexemptions after the deadline would negate the benefit of this plan. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nB.    Statutory History \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 1.    Brodie's Interpretation \r\n  \r\n In support of its construction of the statute, TNS points to the\r\ninterpretation James Brodie, the Director of the Property Division, gave to\r\nsection 12-4-730's predecessor, section 12-3-145(B).  According to Brodie's July\r\n3, 1990 memo which was sent to all assessors, auditor, treasurers, and tax\r\ncollectors, the new amendments4 to this section gave the Department the\r\nauthority to accept applications for exemptions at any time.  This amendment\r\ndid not give the Department the authority to accept late applications, but\r\nmerely clarified that it had the authority to decide whether any property, not\r\njust that of churches, parsonages, and burying grounds, met the requirements\r\nfor exemptions. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Although Brodie believed the Department had the authority to grant\r\nretroactive exemptions, and exemptions may have been granted under this\r\nerroneous view, neither the Commission nor the courts are bound by his\r\nerroneous interpretation. Fennell v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 233 S.C.\r\n43, 48, 103 S.E.2d 424, 427 (1958); Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins.  Co. v. South\r\nCarolina Tax Comm'n, 233 S.C. 129, 151, 103 S.E.2d 908, 919 (1958). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2.   Other Statutory History \r\n  \r\n\r\n4TNS incorrectly argues Brodie's memo referred to the 1991 revision\r\nwhich moved the procedure for applying for exemptions from section 12-3-145\r\nto sections 12-4-710 through -760.  However, Brodie's memo was written in\r\n1990; the amendments he was addressing in his memo could not have been\r\nthe 1991 revisions which were not effective until July 1, 1991. \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n According to the circuit court, \"[t]he history of this statute demonstrates\r\nthat, at one time, almost all manufacturers were late in filing their\r\napplications and that this statute was designed and amended to give [the\r\nDepartment] the authority to accept late applications.\" We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n As noted earlier, during the tax years in question, a taxpayer who\r\nwished to file an application to exempt pollution control equipment had to do\r\nso by the sixteenth day of the fourth month after the close of the accounting\r\nperiod regularly employed by the taxpayer for income tax purposes.5 S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 12-3-145(B) (Supp. 1985-1990) (repealed 1991).  The Department\r\nwas required to determine annually which exemptions it would grant and\r\nnotify the appropriate county officials by June first of each year.  S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 12-3-145(A) (Supp. 1985-1990) (repealed 1991).  For good cause shown,\r\nthe Department could waive the required deadline for applying for\r\nexemptions, but it could not extend the deadline beyond the penalty date for\r\ntaxes due, and the late taxpayer was penalized.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-3-\r\n145(F) (Supp. 1985-1990). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In 1985, the legislature added language to section 12-3-145(B) which\r\nallowed the Department to declare churches, parsonages, and burying\r\ngrounds exempt.  Act No. 3, 1985 S.C. Acts 5 (effective March 1, 1985).  Two\r\nmonths later, the legislature added a provision allowing churches and\r\nparsonages to file an application for an exemption at any time.  Act No. 53,\r\n1985 S.C. Acts 95 (effective April 29, 1995, codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§12-3-\r\n146 (Supp. 1985)). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Testimony at the hearing revealed the procedure for applying for\r\nexemptions outlined in section 12-3-145 created an administrative problem\r\nbecause the deadline for applying for an exemption was two weeks earlier\r\nthan the deadline for filing returns.  Since as a practical matter, most\r\ntaxpayers requested their exemptions with their returns, the Department\r\nwould have to deny exemptions for being late.  Then the General Assembly\r\nwould grant extensions, and the Department would then grant the\r\nexemptions it had previously denied. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In 1985, the General Assembly extended the deadline for filing\r\nexemption applications for the 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985 tax years\r\nuntil July 1, 1985.  Act No. 3, 1985 S.C. Acts 5. In 1987, the deadline for\r\napplying for exemptions for the 1985, 1986, and 1987 tax years was extended \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n5For calendar year taxpayers like TNS, the deadline for applying for an\r\nexemption would be April 15. \r\n  \r\np.10 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuntil July 1, 1987.  Act No. 64, 1987 S.C. Acts 126.  In 1988, the deadline for\r\nthe 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988 tax years was extended until July 1, 1988.\r\nFinally, in 1990, the General Assembly granted its last extension, postponing\r\nthe deadline for exemption applications for the tax years 1988 and 1989 until\r\nJuly 1, 1990. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In 1991, the legislature revised and recodified the procedure for\r\napplying for property tax exemptions.  Act No. 50, 1991 S.C. Acts 152\r\n(codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-4-710 to 760 (Supp. 1991)).  Substantively,\r\nthe requirements remained the same.  However, section 12-3-146, which\r\nallowed churches and parsonages to apply for an exemption at any time, was\r\nomitted.  Section F, which gave the Department the discretion to accept late\r\napplications for exemptions before the penalty date for paying taxes, was also\r\nomitted.  After the 1991 revision, the legislature has not again extended the\r\ndeadline for applying for exemptions. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Contrary to the lower court's holding, the legislative history of these\r\nstatutes does not show the Department has the authority to accept late\r\napplications; in fact, the only inference arising from the legislative history is\r\nthat only the General Assembly may extend the application deadline.  The\r\nlegislative history indicates the General Assembly did not want the deadline\r\nfor applying for extensions to be discretionary, so it took away the\r\nDepartment's authority to grant even short term extensions.  Furthermore,\r\nsince the General Assembly has not granted another extension since before\r\nthe 1991 revision, we can infer it intended for the revision to end the practice\r\nof granting extensions. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Since nothing in the plain language or the history of these procedural\r\nstatutes gives the Department the authority to grant retroactive exemptions,\r\nthe lower court erred in finding the Department could do so. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIII.  Section 12-37-975 \r\n  \r\n The circuit court found that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-975 (Supp. 1992)\r\ngave the Department the discretion to accept amended returns filed after the\r\ndate they were due and that the Department properly exercised its discretion\r\nhere.  Appellants argue the court should not have reached this issue because\r\nit was not raised to the Commission.  We agree.  This issue was neither\r\nraised to nor ruled on by the Commission; therefore, the circuit court erred\r\nin addressing it. Kiawah Resort Assocs. v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 318\r\nS.C. 502, 458 S.E.2d 542 (1995) (the circuit court ordinarily may not consider\r\nissues that were not raised to and ruled on by the administrative agency). \r\n  \r\np.11\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n If the issue had been raised, this section does not provide authority for\r\ngranting the relief requested by TNS.  Section 12-37-975 provides: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Department of Revenue may permit any person to substitute\r\n an amended return for the original return up to the last day\r\n prescribed for filing the return, including any extension of time\r\n granted by the department.  The department in its discretion\r\n may accept or reject an amended return filed after the time\r\n prescribed for filing the return. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-975 (Supp. 1992).  Statutes, as a whole, must receive\r\npractical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose,\r\ndesign, and policy of lawmakers. Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch.  Dist.\r\nNo. 1, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993).  Subtle or forced construction of\r\nstatutory words for the purpose of expanding a statute's operation is\r\nprohibited. Walton v. Walton, 282 S.C. 165, 318 S.E.2d 14 (1984). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The circuit court failed to recognize the distinction between amended\r\nreturns and applications for exemptions.  This section may allow the\r\nDepartment to accept an amended tax return, but to interpret it to allow\r\nthem to grant a retroactive exemption effectively writes the deadlines for\r\napplying for an exemption out of the Code.  Furthermore, the circuit court's\r\ninterpretation creates an absurd distinction; the deadlines for applying for\r\nexemptions would apply to taxpayers who applied on separate forms, but the\r\ndeadlines would not apply to taxpayers who applied on their tax returns.\r\nConsequently, if the issue had been preserved, the circuit court wrongly gave\r\na forced interpretation to this section, thereby expanding its operation to\r\nallow TNS the relief it requested. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIV.   Section 12-47-420 \r\n  \r\n The circuit court relied on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-47-420 (Supp. 1992)\r\n(repealed by Act No. 60, 1995 S.C. Acts 405) when it found in favor of TNS.\r\nThat section stated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhenever after due hearing the Commission by majority vote\r\nshall determine that any tax has been paid under an erroneous,\r\nimproper or illegal assessment, the Commission shall order the\r\nofficer having custody of the tax so erroneously, improperly or\r\nillegally paid to refund it . . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Appellants argue this issue is procedurally barred and the court's reliance on\r\nthis statute was misplaced.  We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n To the Commission, TNS argued this section supported its argument\r\nthat the plain meaning of section 12-4-720(A) gave the Commission the\r\nauthority to grant retroactive exemptions.  TNS claimed that if the\r\nDepartment had the authority to grant a retroactive exemption, then this\r\nsection provided for a refund.  The Commission did not rule on the meaning\r\nof this section.  Then, for the first time, TNS argued to the circuit court that\r\nthis section standing alone allowed a refund based on American Hardware\r\nSupply Co. v. Whitmire because the assessment was erroneous. 278 S.C. 607,\r\n300 S.E.2d 289 (1983).  Since this issue was not raised to and ruled on by\r\nthe Commission, it is procedurally barred. Kiawah Resort Assocs. v. South\r\nCarolina Tax Comm'n, 318 S.C. 502, 458 S.E.2d 542 (1995). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In any event, section 12-47-420 does not authorize a refund for TNS.\r\nThe Court in American Hardware ruled a taxpayer who paid property taxes\r\non exempt property during tax years 1974, 1975, and 1976 was entitled to a\r\nrefund under section 12-47-420.  During those years, taxpayers were not\r\nrequired to file an application in order to receive an exemption; by law, the\r\nproperty was automatically exempt.  In that case, the assessment of\r\nautomatically exempt property was ruled to be erroneous, illegal and\r\nimproper, and the taxpayer was granted a refund.  Here, TNS's property was\r\nnot automatically exempt; it was required to apply for an exemption which\r\nit failed to do.  Consequently, its property was not exempt and it did not pay\r\ntaxes on exempt property.  The assessment of its property was therefore not\r\nerroneous, illegal or improper, and this statute does not authorize a refund. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nV.    Equal Protection \r\n  \r\n The court below found that despite TNS's failure to meet the statutory\r\nrequirements for an exemption, it could receive a retroactive exemption\r\nbecause it had been treated differently from other similarly situated\r\ntaxpayers in violation of the equal protection clauses of the federal and state\r\nconstitutions.  U.S. Const. amend.  XIV; S.C. Const. art. 1, Â§ 3. Appellants\r\nargue the lower court's ruling was erroneous because TNS's equal protection\r\nargument was procedurally barred and because TNS cannot establish a\r\nviolation of equal protection.  Even if this argument were not procedurally\r\nbarred, we agree the lower court erred in finding an equal protection\r\nviolation. \r\n  \r\np.13\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In order to establish an equal protection violation, a party must show\r\nthat similarly situated persons received disparate treatment. Grant v. South\r\nCarolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 354, 461 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1995). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n TNS cannot show it is similarly situated to another group of taxpayers.\r\nThe lower court believed TNS was similarly situated to two different groups\r\nof taxpayers.  The first group identified in the order are TNS's competitors\r\nwho received the benefit of the unpublished 20% policy.  However, TNS is not\r\nsimilarly situated to this group; the group of competitors who benefitted from\r\nthe 20% policy only received this benefit because they applied for the\r\npollution control exemption.  As it admitted to the Commission, TNS did not\r\napply.  If, for example, TNS had applied and been given a 10% exemption,\r\nit could claim it was treated differently from other similarly situated\r\ntaxpayers.  However, TNS did not apply, and it cannot complain of disparate\r\ntreatment. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The second group of similarly situated taxpayers identified by the\r\ncircuit court were other manufacturers who were granted exemptions in spite\r\nof late applications.  The record does not show these taxpayers and TNS were\r\nsimilarly situated.  As noted earlier, the Property Division failed to enforce\r\nthe deadline against taxpayers who applied for their exemptions when they\r\nfiled their returns and therefore missed the April 16 deadline by two weeks.\r\nThese taxpayers were not similarly situated to TNS who filed years, not\r\nweeks, after the deadline.  Furthermore, the record contains no evidence that\r\nany taxpayer other than TNS received a refund as a result of the Property\r\nDivision's interpretation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Moreover, TNS cannot establish \"arbitrary and purposeful\r\ndiscrimination\" on the part of the Commission.  As discussed earlier, the\r\nDepartment does not have the authority to waive the application deadline\r\nand annual determination requirements of Article 7. The Commission was\r\ncorrecting the erroneous view of the Property Division, not singling out TNS\r\nfor unfair treatment.  Neither the Commission nor the courts are bound by\r\nthe previous erroneous interpretation of the Property Division. Fennell v.\r\nSouth Carolina Tax Commission, 233 S.C. 43, 4-8, 103 S.E.2d 424, 427 (1958);\r\nColonial Life &amp; Accident Ins.  Co. v. South Carolina Tax Commission, 233\r\nS.C. 129, 151, 103 S.E.2d 908, 919 (1958). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nVI.  Exclusion of Witness James Brodie \r\n  \r\n During the hearing in front of the Commission, TNS offered the\r\ntestimony of James Brodie, the Chairman of the Property Division.  Brodie \r\n  \r\np.14\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthored the documents establishing the 20% standard exemption for\r\npollution control equipment and establishing the Department's policy\r\nregarding retroactive tax exemptions.  Brodie was also the employee who\r\nconfirmed TNS's refund.  The Commission did not allow Brodie to testify.\r\nThe circuit court found \"the Commission utilized an improper procedure for\r\ndisqualifying a witness that would require a remand, at the very least.\"\r\nAppellants argue this finding was erroneous.  We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At common law, all witnesses were presumed to be competent except\r\nvery young children.6  South Carolina Dep't of Social Servs. v. Doe, 292 S.C.\r\n211, 355 S.E.2d 543 (Ct.  App. 1987).  A witness has to be capable of\r\nexpressing himself and has to understand the obligation to tell the truth to\r\nbe qualified to testify. State v. Green, 267 S.C. 599, 230 S.E.2d 618 (1976);\r\nAbbott v. Columbia Mills Co., 110 S.C. 298, 96 S.E. 556 (1918).  The\r\ndetermination of the competency of a witness is a matter that rests within\r\nthe discretion of the trial court, or as here, the Commission; their\r\ndetermination should not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion. In\r\nre Robert M., 294 S.C. 69, 362 S.E.2d 639 (1987). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At the hearing, Brodie's psychiatrist testified she did not believe Brodie\r\nwould be a reliable witness because lie was suffering from major depression\r\nand the stress of testifying would render him unable to speak.  According to\r\nthe psychiatrist, Brodie could not speak in stressful situations, and his\r\nanxiety would cause him to \"say anything just to get out of the hot seat.\"\r\nShe believed being forced to testify would be detrimental to his treatment.\r\nThe Commission decided to exclude Brodie. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Although it did not make these arguments to the Commission, TNS\r\nnow argues that a court cannot exclude a witness merely because of mental\r\nillness and that the psychiatrist did not state to a reasonable degree of\r\nmedical certainty that Brodie would more likely than not lie.  However, the\r\nCommission's decision to exclude Brodie was not an abuse of its discretion\r\nsince the only testimony offered showed Brodie would have been unable to\r\nexpress himself on the stand and would have possibly not told the truth. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Also, TNS cannot prove it was prejudiced by the Commission's decision.\r\nFirst, it failed to make a proffer of what Brodie's testimony would have been.\r\nSee State v. Anderson, 304 S.C. 551, 406 S.E.2d 152 (1991)(where there is no\r\nproffer of excluded testimony, the Court is unable to determine whether the \r\n  \r\n\r\n6This hearing was held on March 24, 1994, before the South Carolina\r\nRules of Evidence were adopted. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.15\r\n\r\nTNS MILLS, INC. v. SC DEPT.  OF REVENUE, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplaining party was prejudiced by the refusal to admit the testimony into\r\nevidence).  Second, the record indicates TNS requested that Brodie be allowed\r\nto testify by affidavit, answering questions submitted by the parties.\r\nAlthough TNS suggested this procedure, it did not avail itself of the\r\nopportunity to question Brodie in this manner as did appellants.  Accordingly,\r\nsince the Commission's decision was supported by the evidence and TNS\r\ncannot prove it was prejudiced, the circuit court erred when it found the\r\nCommission had abused its discretion by excluding Brodie. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nVII. 20% Policy7 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Appellants County, School District, and County Council argue the 20%\r\npolicy on which TNS based its retroactive exemption is illegal.  Since TNS\r\nshould not have been granted a retroactive exemption, this issue is moot and\r\nneed not be addressed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n Accordingly, the opinion of the circuit court is reversed, and the\r\nCommission's decision that the pollution control exemptions may not be\r\nretroactively granted to TNS is reinstated. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.

We reverse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.17\r\n\r\nPAULING v. STATE\r\n ISSUE \r\n  \r\nDid the PCR judge err in holding trial counsel was not\r\nineffective for failing to introduce the triage nurse's notes or to\r\ninterview and prepare the triage nurse as a defense witness? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTS \r\n  \r\n At trial, the fifty-five-year-old victim testified a man who\r\nidentified himself as Jimmy Copeland knocked on the back door of her\r\napartment.  The victim did not know Jimmy Copeland and did not let the\r\nman inside. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Later, the man returned, broke into her second floor bathroom\r\nwindow, and entered her apartment.  The victim testified she struck the\r\nman with a glass vase which broke and cut her right hand; the man then\r\nchoked her, tied her up, and hit her in the mouth.  Thereafter, the victim\r\nstated the assailant took off her clothes and \"put hisself (sic) into me.\"\r\nThe victim did not know whether the assailant ejaculated.  The victim\r\ndescribed the perpetrator as seven feet tall and in his nineties.1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n After receiving a call from neighbors, the police arrived at the\r\nvictim's apartment.  The assailant ran upstairs and out the bathroom\r\nwindow.  The police apprehended petitioner within minutes after he fled\r\nthe victim's apartment. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Dr. Elizabeth Pernal testified she performed the rape protocol\r\nexamination.  She testified she found no lesions, cuts, or tears while\r\nperforming a pelvic examination on the victim.  Dr. Pernal further stated\r\nshe found no semen, but this was not unusual since the victim had stated\r\nthe assailant had not ejaculated.  She testified the victim had a swollen\r\njaw, an abrasion on her forehead, and a bloody laceration on her right\r\npalm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On cross-examination, Dr. Pernal stated the victim told her\r\nshe had been assaulted by an elderly man.  Referring to the notes of a\r\ntriage nurse, defense counsel asked Dr. Pernal if the victim had told one\r\nof the nurses there had been no actual penetration.  The doctor testified \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Petitioner is 5'1 0\" and was twenty-seven years old. \r\n\r\np.18\r\n\r\nPAULING v. STATE \r\n\r\nshe did not know what the victim had told the nurse, but the victim had\r\ntold her the assailant \"did not enter all the way.\" At this point, the trial\r\njudge sustained the prosecution's objection on the basis of hearsay. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At the PCR hearing, petitioner introduced the triage nurse's\r\nnotes which stated: \"pt states pt did not penetrate the vagina.  Was hit in\r\nface and laceration rt hand.\" Petitioner argued trial counsel was\r\nineffective because he was not prepared to present the triage nurse as a\r\ndefense witness. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Defense counsel testified he did not attempt to identify the\r\ntriage nurse prior to trial.  He agreed the nurse's testimony concerning the\r\nvictim's statement would have been substantive evidence that a sexual\r\nbattery did not occur and evidence to impeach the victim's credibility. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In the Order of Dismissal, the PCR judge determined petitioner\r\nfailed to establish he was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to call the\r\ntriage nurse as a defense witness.  The judge concluded petitioner did not\r\nestablish prejudice because the triage nurse had no independent\r\nrecollection of this case.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n In a post-conviction proceeding, the burden is on the applicant\r\nto prove the allegations in his application. Butler v. State., 286 S.C. 441,\r\n334 S.E.2d 813 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1094Y 106 S.Ct. 869, 88\r\nL.Ed.2d 908 (1986).  As to allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel,\r\nthe applicant must show his counsel's performance fell below an objective\r\nstandard of reasonableness, and but for counsel's errors, there is a\r\nreasonable probability the result at trial would have been different.\r\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674\r\n(1984); Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).  A\r\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 The record indicates there was confusion in locating the triage\r\nnurse for the PCR hearing.  The PCR judge allowed petitioner ten days in\r\nwhich to locate and depose the nurse.  The Order of Dismissal states\r\n\"\"[c]ounsel for the Applicant has informed this Court that she has located\r\nthe nurse.  However, the nurse has indicated that she has no independent\r\nrecollection of this case.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.19\r\n\r\nPAULING v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the outcome of the trial. Johnson v. State, supra.  This Court must\r\naffirm the findings of the PCR judge if they are supported by any evidence\r\nin the record. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At the PCR hearing, petitioner did not allege counsel was\r\nineffective for failing to introduce the triage nurse's notes at trial.\r\nAccordingly, this issue is not preserved for review. Plyler v. State, 309\r\nS.C. 408, 424 S.E.2d 477 (1992). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n However, we conclude counsel's failure to call the triage nurse\r\nas a defense witness was deficient and petitioner was prejudiced by this\r\ndeficiency.  While there was overwhelming evidence petitioner had broken\r\ninto the victim's home,3 the only evidence of a sexual battery was the\r\nvictim's testimony.  There was no corroborating physical evidence of\r\npenetration or any forensic evidence of a sexual assault.  The triage\r\nnurse's testimony of the victim's statement shortly after the assault would\r\nhave been crucial, both as substantive evidence that a sexual battery did\r\nnot occur (and, therefore, there was no CSC)4 and as evidence to impeach\r\nthe victim's credibility.5 Even defense counsel admitted the nurse's\r\ntestimony was critical. Martinez v. State, 304 S.C. 39, 403 S.E.2d 113\r\n(1991)(where trial counsel admits the testimony of a certain witness may\r\nhave made the difference in obtaining an acquittal, the Court may find\r\nineffective assistance). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Relying on Glover v. State, 318 S.C. 496, 458 S.E.2d 538\r\n(1995), the State maintains petitioner failed to meet his burden of proof\r\nbecause the triage nurse did not testify at the PCR hearing.\r\n\r\n3 Not only did the police apprehend petitioner while he was fleeing\r\nthe victim's apartment, but a footprint found in the apartment matched\r\npetitioner's shoes. \r\n  \r\n 4 First degree CSC requires a \"sexual battery.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-\r\n3-652 (1)(1985).  A \"sexual battery\" is \"any intrusion, however slight, of\r\nany part of a person's body or of any object into the genital or anal\r\nopenings of another person's body. . . \". S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(h)\r\n(1985). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 5 During its deliberations, the jury requested to hear the testimony of\r\nthe victim and the doctor. \r\n  \r\np.20\r\n\r\nPAULING v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The State misconstrues Glover. In Glover the Court held \"[i]n\r\norder to support a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\r\ninterview or call potential alibi witnesses, a PCR applicant must produce\r\nthe witnesses at the PCR hearing or otherwise introduce the witnesses'\r\ntestimony in a manner consistent with the rules of evidence.\" (emphasis\r\nadded). Id. S.C. at 498-99, S.E.2d at 540. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At the PCR hearing, petitioner presented evidence as to the\r\nnature of the nurse's testimony by introducing her triage notes.  This\r\nevidence is sufficient under Glover. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Similarly, the PCR judge concluded petitioner failed to\r\nestablish prejudice because the triage nurse had no independent\r\nrecollection of the case.

Owens, 293 S.C. 161, 359 S.E.2d 275, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 982,\r\n108 S.Ct. 496, 98 L.Ed.2d 495 (1987). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.23\r\n\r\nOWENS V. STATE \r\n\r\nHe contends the kidnapping sentencing statute prohibits concurrent life\r\nsentences where a defendant is also convicted of a murder which occurs\r\nduring the commission of the kidnapping.  We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At the time of petitioner's retrial for murder in February 1991,\r\nthe kidnapping punishment statute provided as follows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhoever shall unlawfully seize, confine, inveigle, decoy, kidnap,\r\nabduct or carry away any other person by any means\r\nwhatsoever without authority of law, except when a minor is\r\nseized or taken by a parent thereof, shall be guilty of a felony\r\nand, upon conviction, shall suffer the punishment of life\r\nimprisonment unless sentenced for murder as provided in Â§ 16-\r\n3-20. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 (1985).2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Court has summarily vacated life sentences for kidnapping\r\nwhen the defendant received a concurrent sentence under the murder\r\nstatute. State v. Joyner, 289 S.C. 436, 346 S.E.2d 711 (1986); State v.\r\nLivingston, 282 S.C. 1,  317 S.E.2d 129 (1984); State v. Stroman, 281 S.C.\r\n508, 316 S.E.2d 395 (1984); State v. Perry, 278 S.C. 490, 299 S.E.2d 324,\r\ncert. denied, 461 U.S. 908, 103 S.Ct. 1881, 76 L.Ed.2d 811 (1983); State v.\r\nCopeland, 278 S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1103,\r\n103 S.Ct. 1802, 76 L.Ed.2d 367 (1983); State v.

In each of these cases, however, the defendant was simultaneously\r\ntried, convicted, and sentenced for murder and kidnapping.  This Court\r\nhas not considered the applicability of Â§ 16-3-910 when the defendant is\r\ntried, convicted, and sentenced separately for kidnapping and murder. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The PCR judge concluded Â§ 16-3-910 prohibits a life sentence\r\nfor kidnapping only when the kidnapping sentence is received in\r\nconjunction with or subsequent to the life sentence for murder.\r\nConsequently, since petitioner was sentenced for kidnapping five years\r\nbefore he was sentenced for murder, the PCR judge determined petitioner's \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Effective June 5, 1991, the penalty for kidnapping was reduced to a\r\nmaximum period of thirty years' imprisonment.  The prohibition against\r\nconcurrent sentences for murder and kidnapping was retained. \r\n  \r\np.24\r\n\r\nOWENS v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife sentence for kidnapping was proper. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We disagree.  There are no temporal limitations in Â§ 16-3-910.\r\nAllowing the State to elect to try a defendant separately and obtain two\r\nsentences where concurrent sentences would otherwise be prohibited\r\ncircumvents the language of the statute where, as here, the murder\r\noccurred during the commission of the kidnapping.  Although petitioner\r\nwas properly sentenced to life imprisonment at the time he was convicted\r\nof kidnapping in 1985, when petitioner was convicted and sentenced for\r\nthe associated murder, his sentence for kidnapping should have been\r\nvacated.  Accordingly, the decision of the PCR judge is reversed and\r\npetitioner's kidnapping sentence is hereby vacated.3 Holland v. State, 322\r\nS.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996)(where there is no probative evidence to\r\nsupport the PCR judge's findings, the findings should not be upheld). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and WALLER, JJ. , concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 The South Carolina Department of Corrections shall determine\r\npetitioner's credit for time served for the kidnapping sentence and apply\r\nsuch credit to the murder sentence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.25 \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24813","title":"Carl M.

We reverse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTS \r\n  \r\n In 1988, respondent Carl M. Durham (Durham) purchased real\r\nproperty located in West Columbia from third-party plaintiff/respondent\r\nUnited Companies Financial Corporation (United).  Durham gave United a\r\npromissory note and mortgage.  The mortgage permitted United to collect\r\na monthly escrow amount for payment of taxes. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The property taxes were not paid for the 1989 tax year.  On\r\nJune 12, 1991, the Lexington County Treasurer-Tax Collector (County)\r\nsent a notice to Durham stating the property had been seized for\r\ndelinquent property taxes. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n County sold the property at a public auction tax sale to third-\r\nparty defendant/petitioner Gloria Baker (Baker) on October 7, 1991.  On\r\nAugust 26, 1992, County notified Durham the property had been sold and\r\ninformed him the redemption period ended on October 7, 1992.  Durham\r\ntook no action. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On December 15, 1992, County mailed United a notice advising\r\nthe property had been sold for nonpayment of taxes.  The notice stated, if\r\nUnited wished to protect its interest in the property, payment of $1,032.10\r\nmust be received by January 15, 1993.1 United did not respond. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n County delivered Baker the tax deed to the property on May 6,\r\n1993.  Baker assumed possession of the property. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDurham brought this action against United alleging breach of\r\n\r\n1 It is undisputed United received this notice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.27\r\n\r\nDURHAM v. UNITED COMPANIES \r\n\r\nthe agreement to pay the property taxes. United filed a third-party\r\ncomplaint against Baker claiming County failed to give it the statutorily\r\nrequired 30-day notice before the end of the redemption period.  Baker\r\nasserted her title was valid and filed a cross-claim to quiet title. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The trial court concluded County gave proper notice to United,\r\neven though the notice was given after the end of the redemption period.\r\nUnited appealed.  The Court of Appeals reversed, declaring the tax sale\r\nand deed void. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n ISSUE \r\n  \r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by holding the 30-day notice\r\nrequired by Â§ 12-49-300 must be given during the redemption\r\nperiod? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n The sale of the property of a defaulting taxpayer is governed\r\nby statute. Osborne v. Vallentine, 196 S.C. 90, 12 S.E.2d 856 (1941); Von\r\nElbrecht v. Jacobs, 286 S.C. 240, 332 S.E.2d 568 (Ct.  App. 1985).  Chapter\r\n51 of Title 12 establishes the following procedure. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n After the county treasurer issues a tax execution against a\r\ndefaulting taxpayer, if the taxes remain unpaid for thirty days, a notice of\r\ndelinquent taxes is mailed to the owner of record.  The notice must specify\r\nthat if the taxes, penalties, assessments, and costs are not paid, the\r\nproperty will be advertised and sold to satisfy the delinquency.  If the\r\ntaxes remain unpaid another thirty days, the execution officer takes\r\nexclusive possession of so much of the property as is necessary to satisfy\r\nthe payment of taxes, penalties, assessments, and costs.  Exclusive\r\npossession is taken by mailing a notice of delinquent property taxes,\r\nassessments, penalties, and costs to the defaulting taxpayer.  S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 12-51-40 (Supp. 1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n After a delinquent tax sale is held and the successful bidder\r\npays the bid amount, he is furnished with a receipt but does not obtain a\r\ndeed or title.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-60 (Supp. 1997).  The defaulting\r\ntaxpayer, any mortgagee, or other interested party may redeem the item of\r\nreal estate by paying the delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties, costs,\r\nand interest.  The redemption provision states, in part, as follows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.28\r\n\r\nDURHAM v. UNITED COMPANIES \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defaulting taxpayer, any grantee from the owner, or any .\r\nmortgage or judgment creditor may within twelve months from\r\nthe date of the delinquent tax sale redeem each item of real\r\nestate by paying to the person officially charged with the\r\ncollection of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties, and costs,\r\ntogether with eight percent interest on the whole amount of\r\nthe delinquent tax sale bid. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90 (Supp. 1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n An additional notice of the tax sale must be given to the owner\r\nof record between forty-five and twenty days prior to the end of the\r\nredemption period.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-120 (Supp. 1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Thereafter, \r\n  \r\n[u]pon failure of the defaulting taxpayer, any grantee from the\r\nowner, or any mortgage or judgment creditor, to redeem realty\r\nwithin the time period allowed for redemption, the person\r\nofficially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes shall\r\nwithin thirty days or as soon thereafter as possible make a tax\r\ntitle to the purchaser or the purchaser's assignee.  Delivery of\r\nthe tax title to the clerk of court or register of deeds is\r\nconsidered \"putting the purchaser (or assignee) in possession.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-130 (Supp. 1997).2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Chapter 49 contains the following provision: \r\n  \r\n When real estate is sold for taxes in a county, the sheriff,\r\n before delivering the title to real estate to the purchaser at\r\n such sale, shall give at least thirty days' notice of the sale to a\r\n mortgagee appearing of record in order that the\r\n mortgagee may have opportunity to redeem the real estate, \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 If the real estate is redeemed, the tax sale is canceled and the\r\nsuccessful tax purchaser is notified to return the tax sales receipt.  The\r\npurchase price with interest is refunded to the tax purchaser.  S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 12-51-100 (Supp. 1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.29\r\n\r\nDURHAM v. UNITED COMPANIES \r\n\r\n as provided by law for the owner. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-49-300 (Supp. 1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Court of Appeals held the County's failure to give United\r\nthe notice required by Â§ 12-49-300 within the redemption period violated\r\nthe statutory requirements relating to tax sales.  The Court of Appeals\r\ndetermined the notice must be given within the redemption period so that\r\nthe mortgagee has an opportunity to redeem the property within the one-\r\nyear period. Durham v. United Companies Financial Corp., supra.  We\r\ndisagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The cardinal rule of statutory construction is that the Court is\r\nto ascertain and effectuate the actual intent of the legislature. Mid-State\r\nAuto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 476 S.E.2d 690\r\n(1996).  In interpreting a statute, words must be given their plain and\r\nordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to\r\nlimit or expand the statute's operation. Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 468\r\nS.E.2d 649 (1996). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The notice provisions of Chapter 51 require notice of the tax\r\nsale and redemption period be given to the defaulting taxpayer and the\r\nowner of record, but do not require notice to the mortgagee.  S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 12-51-40 and -120.  Consequently, considering the tax sale\r\nprocedure as a whole, it is our opinion the purpose of Â§ 12-49-300 is to\r\ngive mortgagee's notice of the tax sale and an opportunity to redeem the\r\nproperty. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Section 12-49-300 specifies thirty days' notice be given to the\r\nmortgagee before the tax title is delivered to the purchaser in order that\r\nthe mortgagee have an opportunity to redeem the property.  Contrary to\r\nÂ§ 12-51-120 which specifically requires notice be given during the\r\nredemption period, the notice requirement of Â§ 12-49-300 is not related to\r\nthe one-year redemption period.  Instead, it requires the notice be given\r\nthirty days before the tax title is delivered to the purchaser.  By the plain\r\nand unambiguous language of Â§ 12-49-300, this notice could be given\r\nbefore or after the end of the one-year redemption period in Â§ 12-51-90.\r\nIn either event, a mortgagee has thirty days from the date of the notice\r\nrequired by Â§ 12-49-300 in which to redeem the property. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUnited suggests allowing the notice required by Â§ 12-49-300 to \r\n  \r\np.30\r\n\r\nDURHAM v. UNITED COMPANIES \r\n\r\nbe provided after the redemption period is inconsistent with the phrase in\r\nÂ§ 12-49-300, \"in order that the mortgagee . . . may have opportunity to\r\nredeem such real estate, as provided by law for the owner.\" (Emphasis\r\nadded).  It is our opinion, \"as provided by law for the owner\" is included in\r\nÂ§ 12-49-300 as acknowledgment of a mortgagee's substantive right to\r\nredeem property, but is not meant to limit the redemption period to one\r\nyear from the tax sale. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Finally, United argues, pursuant to Â§ 12-51-130, the successful\r\nbidder's interest in the property vests at the close of the one-year\r\nredemption period and, therefore, if the mortgagee redeemed the property\r\nafter this period, there would be a cloud on the successful bidder's title.\r\nSection 12-51-130 only refers to the \"time period allowed for redemption.\"\r\nThe time period allowed for redemption is not limited to the one-year\r\nredemption period in Â§ 12-51-90.  In our opinion, the successful bidder's\r\ninterest in the property does not \"vest\" until after the redemption period\r\nin Â§ 12-51-90 and the expiration of the notice period required by Â§ 12-49-\r\n300. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Accordingly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.

Battle, of Battle &amp; Vaught, P.A., of\r\nConway, for respondents. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n WALLER.,    A.J.: Petitioners brought actions against respondents\r\nalleging, inter alia, respondents violated their constitutional rights in using\r\nexcessive force to effect their arrest.  Recovery was sought under section\r\n1983, Title 42 of the United States Code.1 At the close of petitioners' case,\r\nthe trial judge directed a verdict in favor of respondents.2 The Court of\r\nAppeals affirmed. Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, Op.  No. 96-UP-158 (S.C. Ct.\r\nApp. filed May 16, 1996).  We granted petitioners a writ of certiorari to\r\nreview the sole issue of whether the trial judge properly directed verdicts for\r\nrespondents on the excessive force claims. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTS3 \r\n  \r\n On the evening of September 15, 1991, the Dutch Deli, a restaurant\r\nlocated on Highway 17 in Myrtle Beach, hosted a party for staff and guests. \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 \"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,\r\ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,\r\nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other\r\nperson within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,\r\nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable\r\nto the party injured in . . . [any] proper proceeding for redress . . . .\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 2 Petitioners also alleged false arrest and confinement; outrage; denial\r\nof medical treatment; and negligent supervision, hiring and training.  The\r\ntrial judge directed a verdict in respondents' favor on a number of these\r\ncauses of action; the jury returned a verdict for respondents on the\r\nremainder. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 3 This factual recitation summarizes the evidence petitioners presented\r\nduring their case in chief.  In affirming the trial court, the Court of Appeals\r\nalso considered evidence presented by respondents' expert.   We find\r\nconsideration of this evidence was improper and have disregarded it. \r\n  \r\np.33\r\n\r\nQUESINBERRY, et al. v. ROUPPASONG, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll petitioners attended the party. \r\n  \r\n Petitioner Lewis gave the following account of events.   She had\r\nconsumed two mixed drinks and was sitting with others on the porch outside\r\nthe restaurant when a patrol car stopped a vehicle traveling on Highway 17.\r\nA second patrol car arrived.  Lewis and her daughter, petitioner Quesinberry,\r\nthought it strange two patrol cars had stopped for one vehicle. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Lewis, a thirty-eight year old photographer interested in obtaining a\r\nphotograph to enter into a contest, walked across Highway 17 with her\r\ncamera, intending to ask an officer if she could take a picture.  One of the\r\nofficers told her to return to the sidewalk.  Lewis complied and was looking\r\nat her camera when respondent Rouppasong grabbed her arms.  Lewis told\r\nhim she did not take a picture.  Thereafter, both Officer Rouppasong and\r\nrespondent Rosbrugh pulled Lewis's arms behind her back.  Lewis testified\r\nthe officers handcuffed her in such a way that she could not stand up\r\nstraight.  When she asked if she was under arrest, she received no response. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n By this time, Quesinberry had approached the scene.  She informed the\r\nofficers Lewis was her mother and inquired whether Lewis was under arrest.\r\nLewis told Quesinberry to take pictures.  After Quesinberry took one picture,\r\nOfficer Rouppasong told her to stop.  Quesinberry circled around the officers\r\nand her mother, snapping pictures.  Officer Rouppasong placed Lewis in a\r\npatrol car.  From the car, Lewis witnessed the arrest of her daughter and of\r\npetitioners Foxworth and Roth. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Inside the patrol car, as she was being transported to jail, Lewis asked\r\nwhat she was charged with. Officer Rouppasong replied, \"you're drunk.\"4\r\nLewis also complained to Officer Rouppasong about her handcuffs: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n...  Officer Rouppasong got in, got in the car, and I said, \"I think\r\nthese handcuffs must be too tight.  I can't feel my wrists.\" I\r\nsaid, \"I can't feel my hands at all.  Could you check them?\" and\r\nhe didn't respond, and I said several more times driving to the\r\njail, \"Something's wrong with my hands.  I can't, I can't feel my\r\nhands,\" . . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter her release from jail, Lewis went to the hospital emergency room where\r\nbandages were applied to her arms.  She consulted an orthopedic surgeon a \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 Lewis was charged with and convicted of public intoxication and\r\nresisting arrest. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.34\r\n\r\nQUESINBERRY, et al. v. ROUPPASONG, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth later who diagnosed her with mild carpal tunnel syndrome in both\r\nwrists.  She ultimately underwent cortisone injections and orthopedic surgery\r\non her wrists. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Petitioner Quesinberry gave the following account of events.  She had\r\nfinished one alcoholic beverage and was beginning to drink a second when\r\nshe saw her mother walk across Highway 17 towards Officer Rouppasong,\r\nturn around, and walk back.  Quesinberry went to the parking lot next to the\r\nhighway, where she saw the officers release the individual they had stopped,\r\ncome up behind Lewis, grab her arms, and tug and jerk on her camera and\r\npurse straps.  Quesinberry asked why they were arresting Lewis but received\r\nno response.  Quesinberry began taking pictures with her own camera. When\r\nOfficer Rouppasong told her to stop, she replied, \"Stop doing what?  Taking\r\npictures?  I have a right to take pictures.  This is America.  I can take\r\npictures if I want to take pictures.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Officer Rosbrugh grabbed her right arm and jerked it around behind\r\nher back up into the air.  He forced her onto the hood of a patrol car, told\r\nher to spread her legs, and then kicked her legs apart, causing bruises and\r\nbreaking the straps on her sandals.  He then handcuffed her. When\r\nQuesinberry asked if she were under arrest, Officer Rosbrugh did not reply.\r\nAt this point she saw five other people in the parking lot and about ten\r\npeople on the porch of the Dutch Deli.  The people were screaming at the\r\nofficers, \"Why are you arresting her?  What is going on?\" Officer Rosbrugh\r\nplaced Quesinberry in the patrol car with her mother.5 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Petitioner Roth gave the following account of events.  He had consumed\r\nfour or five beers and a \"shooter or two\" when he saw the officers arrest\r\nLewis and Quesinberry.  He and his girlfriend, petitioner Foxworth, went out\r\nto the parking lot.  Quesinberry's boyfriend was there shouting obscenities\r\nat the officers. Roth said, \"This is bull----. He asked the officers, \"Why\r\ndon't [you] go down to Tenth Avenue and bust some crack cocaine dealers,\r\nwhy don't [you] do something real for once.\" He estimated four or five people\r\nwere standing in the parking lot. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Officer Rosbrugh then asked Roth, \"Why don't you come over here?\"\r\nRoth held up his hands and stepped back.  Officer Rosbrugh jumped over a\r\nsmall retaining wall and grabbed Roth's right hand.  Roth jerked his hand\r\naway.  Rosbrugh grabbed Roth's arm again and pulled it behind his back.\r\nRoth went down on his knees.  Roth testified if he stresses his back and \r\n  \r\n\r\n5 A jury convicted Quesinberry of interfering with a police officer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.35\r\n\r\nQUESINBERRY, et al. v. ROUPPASONG, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshoulder, they will twinge., but \"I wouldn't call it a real injury.\"6 \r\n  \r\n Petitioner Foxworth gave the following account of events.   She\r\nconsumed three wine coolers at the party.  Foxworth saw Lewis approach the\r\nofficers, and heard Quesinberry ask what was going on.  Between thirty to\r\nthirty-five people were on the Dutch Deli's porch watching the incident.  She\r\nthen walked out to the parking lot with Roth where she witnessed the\r\nofficers arrest Lewis and Quesinberry.  Foxworth asked the officers why\r\nLewis and Quesinberry were being arrested.  Quesinberry's boyfriend was\r\ncursing at the police.  Officer Rosbrugh pointed at Roth and asked if he had\r\nsomething to say.  Foxworth grabbed Roth's elbow and pulled him back.\r\nOfficer Rosbrugh then grabbed Roth and pulled him to the ground. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n She was watching Roth when someone suddenly grabbed her.  She\r\njerked her arm away but was grabbed again and placed in handcuffs by a\r\nthird officer who had arrived on the scene.  She had no idea why she was\r\nbeing arrested.7 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Finally, petitioners presented the testimony of eyewitness Sandra\r\nHucks.  Hucks testified she did not recall either Lewis's or Quesinberry's\r\narrests, but viewed portions of Roth's and Foxworth's arrests from the Dutch\r\nDeli's porch (some sixty to eighty feet from the incident).  According to\r\nHucks, there were approximately forty people at the party.  A group of people\r\nwere on the porch, and some people were yelling obscenities. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n ISSUE \r\n  \r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial judge's\r\ndirecting a verdict in respondents' favor on petitioners' excessive\r\nforce claims? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n On review of a ruling granting a directed verdict, the evidence and all\r\nreasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable\r\n\r\n6 Roth was charged with disorderly conduct.  He was acquitted. \r\n\r\n 7 Foxworth was charged with interfering with a police officer.  She was\r\nacquitted. \r\n  \r\np.36\r\n\r\nQUESINBERRY, et al. v. ROUPPASONG, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto the party against whom the verdict was directed. Carson v. Adger, 326\r\nS.C. 212, 486 S.E.2d 3 (1997).  If the evidence is susceptible to more than one\r\nreasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury. Gamble v.\r\nInt'l Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438, (1996). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Our decision is controlled by the Supreme Court's decision in Graham\r\nv. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1989). Graham\r\nheld all claims that law enforcement officers used excessive force in the\r\ncourse of an arrest, investigatory stop, or other seizure of a free citizen\r\nshould be analyzed under the reasonableness standard of the Fourth\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.8 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Determining whether the force used to effect a particular\r\n seizure is \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment requires a\r\n careful balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on\r\n the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the\r\n countervailing governmental interests at stake.  Our Fourth\r\n Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that the right to\r\n make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it\r\n the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof\r\n to effect it.  Because the test of reasonableness under the Fourth\r\n Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical\r\n application, however, its proper application requires careful\r\n attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case,\r\n including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect\r\n poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,\r\n and whether [the suspect] is resisting arrest or attempting to\r\n evade arrest by flight. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The \"reasonableness\" of a particular use of force must be\r\njudged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,\r\nrather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.  With respect to\r\na claim of excessive force, the same standard of reasonableness\r\nat the moment applies: \"Not every push or shove, even if it may\r\nlater seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge's chambers,\"\r\nviolates the Fourth Amendment.  The calculus of reasonableness\r\nmust embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often\r\nforced to make split-second judgments -- in circumstances that \r\n  \r\n\r\n8 \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,\r\nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\r\n. . . .\" \r\n  \r\np.37\r\n\r\nQUESINBERRY, et al. v. ROUPPASONG, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving -- about the amount of\r\nforce that is necessary in a particular situation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nId. at 396-97, 109 S. Ct. at 1871-72, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 455-56 (citing Johnson\r\nv. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033 (2d Cir. 1973)) (other internal quotations\r\nomitted).  Finally, the Court held the \"reasonableness\" inquiry in an excessive\r\nforce case is an objective one: \"the question is whether the officers' actions\r\nare 'objectively reasonable' in light of the facts and circumstances confronting\r\nthem, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\" Id. at 397,\r\n109 S. Ct. at 1872, 104 L. Ed. 2d at 456. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Pursuant to Graham, we have balanced the nature and quality of the\r\nforce used against petitioners with the officers' concerns at the time of the\r\narrests.  We find no evidence was presented by petitioners Quesinberry and\r\nRoth to suggest the force used by Officers Rouppasong and Rosbrugh was not\r\nobjectively reasonable under the circumstances of this case.  However, we find\r\npetitioner Lewis presented sufficient evidence of excessive force to survive a\r\ndirected verdict motion.9 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The arrests occurred at night.  By the time Quesinberry and Roth were\r\ninvolved in the incident, a large crowd had gathered.  People in the crowd\r\nwere yelling and cursing at the officers.  Both Quesinberry and Roth had\r\nbeen drinking.  Quesinberry was questioning her mother's arrest, circling\r\naround the officers, and taunting them.  Roth was cursing at the officers and\r\nchallenging their arrest of Lewis and Quesinberry.  When Officer Rosbrugh\r\nfirst touched Roth, he yanked his arm away.  We find an objective officer\r\nwould have viewed these circumstances as a threat to his own and others'\r\nsafety.  Furthermore, Roth's actions would give an objective officer the\r\nimpression he was resisting arrest.  We conclude no evidence was presented\r\nthe force used was excessive regarding these petitioners. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Petitioner Lewis, however, was the first person involved with the\r\nofficers.  She obeyed Officer Rouppasong's command to return  to the sidewalk \r\n  \r\n\r\n9 As to petitioner Foxworth, the Court of Appeals summarily dismissed\r\nher claim because she did not file suit against the officer who arrested her.\r\nThis finding was not contested in the petition for rehearing, petition for\r\ncertiorari to this Court, or petitioners' brief.  Therefore, this unappealed\r\nruling of the Court of Appeals has now become the law of the case and is\r\ndispositive of Foxworth's appeal. See Rule 226(d), SCACR (only questions\r\nraised in petition for rehearing may be properly considered in petition for\r\nwrit of certiorari to this Court). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.38\r\n\r\nQUESINBERRY, et al. v. ROUPPASONG, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter she initially approached the traffic stop.  She was doing nothing more\r\nthan standing on the sidewalk, across the highway from the officers, when\r\nshe was grabbed.  At the time of her arrest, there were no other people\r\naround.    Furthermore, once she was in the patrol, car she repeatedly\r\ncomplained about her wrists and received no response whatsoever from\r\nOfficer Rouppasong. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The crimes Lewis was charged with were not severe, and she did not\r\npose an immediate safety threat to the officers or others.  Furthermore, at\r\nthe time these injuries were inflicted, particularly those caused by the\r\nhandcuffs, she was not actively resisting arrest but was sitting in a patrol\r\ncar, in police custody.    The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had the\r\nopportunity to address an argument similar to Lewis's in Palmer v.\r\nSanderson, 9 F.3d 1433 (1993).  In that case, Palmer claimed Sanderson, a\r\npolice officer, used excessive force in arresting him when Sanderson placed\r\nhim in handcuffs tight enough to cause \"pain and discoloration to his wrists,\r\nand that [the officer] refused his request to loosen them.\"       In finding\r\nSanderson was not entitled to qualified immunity,10 that Court stated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendants are not entitled to qualified immunity under the\r\n\"reasonableness standard\" of the Fourth Amendment.  Palmer\r\nclaims that Sanderson fastened Palmer's handcuffs so tightly\r\naround his wrist that they caused Palmer pain and left bruises\r\nthat lasted for several weeks.  Sanderson has presented no\r\nevidence that would justify handcuffing Palmer so tightly that he\r\nsuffered pain and bruises, or to justify his refusal to loosen the\r\nhandcuffs after Palmer complained of the pain.  Under these\r\ncircumstances, no reasonable officer could believe that the abusive\r\napplication of handcuffs was constitutional.  Because Palmer's\r\nevidence, if credited, would establish that Sanderson's use of force\r\nwas excessive in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the district\r\ncourt properly refused to grant summary judgment in defendants'\r\nfavor on this claim. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n10 \"Law enforcement officials sued under Â§ 1983 are entitled to qualified\r\nimmunity if (1) the 'right' they allegedly violated was not \"clearly established\"\r\nat the time of the violation, or (2) if a reasonable officer would have thought\r\nthat the defendants' actions were constitutional.\" Palmer. 9 F.3d at 1435. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.39\r\n\r\nQUESINBERRY, et al. v. ROUPPASONG, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 1436 (internal citation omitted).\"11 See also Hansen v. Black, 885 F.2d\r\n642, 645 (9th Cir. 1989) (finding officers used excessive force by\r\n\"unreasonably injuring her wrist and arm as they handcuffed her\"). Under\r\nthese circumstances, we find the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial\r\njudge's ruling that the conduct as to petitioner Lewis Was constitutional as\r\na matter of law. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We affirm the Court of Appeals' ruling as to petitioners Quesinberry,\r\nRoth, and Foxworth.  We reverse the Court of Appeals' ruling as to petitioner\r\nLewis.  This case is therefore remanded for further proceedings consistent\r\nwith this opinion. 12 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J. and TOAL, A.J., concur.

Thus, in citing it\r\nwe do not suggest the force used against Lewis was, as a matter of law,\r\nunconstitutional.  The determination of whether the actions taken exceeded\r\nthe bounds of the Fourth Amendment will of course be made after evidence\r\nhas been presented on both sides. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 12 Respondent City of Myrtle Beach argues it was entitled to a directed\r\nverdict on the additional ground that petitioners presented no evidence any\r\nrespondents were executing an unconstitutional municipal policy or custom.\r\nThe trial judge did not rule on this issue.  It is clear from reading the\r\ntranscript that his sole basis for granting the directed verdicts was lack of\r\nevidence.  Therefore, we decline to address the issue and leave it to the trial\r\ncourt upon remand should respondent choose to raise it. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.40\r\n\r\nQUESINBERRY, et al. v.

However, I disagree with\r\nthe majority's conclusion in regard to Petitioner Lewis. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn considering an excessive force claim, the Court must judge \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[t]he 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force . . .from the\r\nperspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than\r\nwith the 20/20 vision of hindsight. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n'Not every push or shove, even if it may later seem\r\nunnecessary in the peace of a judge's chambers,' (citation\r\nomitted) violates the Fourth Amendment.

Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104\r\nL.Ed.2d 443, 455-56 (1989)(citing Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028, 1033\r\n(2nd Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1033, 94 S.Ct. 462, 38 L.Ed.2d 324\r\n(1973)). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Viewing the evidence in the light most- favorable to Lewis, I\r\nconclude the trial judge properly directed the verdict on Lewis' excessive\r\nforce claim.  At the time of Lewis' arrest, it was nighttime.  The police\r\nhad stopped a vehicle; the driver was standing outside the vehicle,\r\nundergoing questioning by the police when Lewis approached the officers.\r\nLewis exchanged words with the officers.  She then stood near the\r\nhighway, preparing to take photographs of the vehicle and of the stop.1a As\r\nthe officers walked towards Lewis, Quesinberry arrived.  According to\r\nQuesinberry, the police were struggling with Lewis.  Quesinberry taunted\r\nthe police and, at Lewis' insistence, circled around the officers, snapping\r\nphotographs.  As a result of these events, a jury convicted Lewis of public \r\n  \r\n\r\n1a Lewis testified she hoped to take pictures of the driver performing\r\nsobriety tests. \r\n  \r\np.41\r\n\r\nQUESINBERRY, et al. v. ROUPPASONG, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintoxication and resisting arrest. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Lewis presented some evidence the handcuffs were applied\r\ntightly.  Her own expert testified, however, carpal tunnel syndrome is not\r\ncaused by a single event. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Assuming the officers used some force in effectuating Lewis'\r\narrest, the force was objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the arrest.  It was nighttime; Lewis was intoxicated; she was\r\nresisting arrest; her daughter was taunting the police.  Lewis presented no\r\nevidence the officers used excessive force in effectuating her arrest. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In every arrest, some amount of force is used.  However, the\r\nuse of force does not automatically give rise to a jury issue as to whether\r\nthe forced used was appropriate.  In this instance, the trial judge properly\r\ndetermined the forced used was objectively reasonable.  I would affirm the\r\ntrial judge and the decision of the Court of Appeals. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMOORE,  A.J. concurs. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.42\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24815","title":"In the Matter of Stephen English Hunter","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=24815","description":"","date":"1998-07-13","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n  Davis Adv.

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, Disciplinary\r\nCounsel. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n PER CURIAM:      In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent\r\nand disciplinary counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21 of the\r\nRules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to be\r\ndisbarred from the practice of law.  We accept the agreement and disbar\r\nrespondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Cynthia Schaaf Matter \r\n  \r\n Respondent represented Cynthia Schaaf regarding a real estate\r\nrefinancing transaction beginning in February 1998.  The refinancing plan called\r\nfor the payoff of certain debts, including a $21,259.61 payoff of a mortgage or\r\nhome equity loan held by First Union Mortgage Corporation (\"First Union\").  On\r\nMarch 2, 1998, respondent received $70,000.00 relating to this transaction into \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.43\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF HUNTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis law firm trust account.  Although respondent was supposed to use these\r\nfunds in part to pay the debt owed to First Union, this payment was not made.\r\nInstead, respondent misappropriated $20,000.00 and used the money to purchase\r\npersonal investments such as stocks and bonds through an online investing\r\ncompany.  A check dated March 30, 1998 in the amount of $376.92 was\r\napparently paid to First Union to cover one or two monthly payments on the\r\nloan.  It was not until May 5, 1998 that respondent paid off Schaaf's debt to\r\nFirst Union with a check for $20,976.04. Additionally, respondent admits that\r\nhe misappropriated $20,557.76 of an unidentified client's funds to pay most of\r\nthe debt to First Union.  In response to inquiries by Schaaf during this time\r\nperiod, respondent intentionally gave Schaaf false and misleading information. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDarrell Hodges Matter \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Respondent misappropriated $13,000.00 belonging to his client\r\nDarrell Hodges.  By redeeming stock through his online investment account,\r\nrespondent paid back this amount on May 11, 1998. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Other Matters \r\n  \r\n Respondent also admits that to pay back the $20,557.76 he\r\nmisappropriated from the unidentified client discussed above in the Schaaf\r\nmatter, respondent redeemed stock through his online investment account.\r\nAdditionally, he misappropriated and converted yet another unidentified client's\r\nfunds in the amount of $10,000.00 to pay back the first unidentified client. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Conclusion \r\n  \r\n In sum, respondent misappropriated client trust funds in an\r\napproximate amount of $64,000.00 and converted these funds for his own\r\npersonal gain by investing the money in various securities.  This improper\r\nconduct regarding client funds demonstrates a pattern of violating the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct.  Rule 407, SCACR.  Respondent has failed to act with\r\nreasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients.  Rule 1.3. He\r\nfailed to keep his clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters\r\nand failed to comply with reasonable requests for information.  Rule 1.4. He\r\nhas repeatedly misappropriated client funds and failed to promptly deliver to a\r\nthird party funds it was entitled to receive.  Rule 1.15. Respondent has engaged\r\nin morally reprehensible conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit and\r\nmisrepresentation.  Rule 8.4(d). Through this misconduct, respondent has\r\nclearly demonstrated his unfitness to practice law. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Accordingly, we disbar respondent from the practice of law.  Within\r\nfifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with\r\nthe Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE.

Anders and Simmons,  ___S.C.___,   483 S.E.2d 780 \r\n  \r\np.4\r\n\r\nSTATE v. ANDERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1997).  We reverse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Appellant, Robert Anders (Anders) and his codefendant, Larry Simmons\r\n(Simmons) were convicted of conspiracy, third degree arson, and burning to\r\ndefraud an insurer, in connection with the October 17, 1992 fire which\r\ndestroyed Anders' construction firm (R.R.&amp;E.) in Greer. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At their joint trial in May, 1995, Rhonda Sutherland, the wife of an\r\nemployee of R.R.&amp;E., testified over Anders' objection that the Monday after\r\nthe fire, she heard Simmons joking that \"Robert was going to pay him big for\r\nblowing up the building,\" and explaining that he had set the fire by leaving\r\nopen propane gas tanks in each room with a lit cigarette in an ashtray on\r\ntop of a book of matches.1 The trial court ruled the statements were\r\nadmissible against Anders on the basis they were made by Simmons in the\r\nfurtherance of a conspiracy, so as to be admissible against both Anders and\r\nSimmons. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Court of Appeals held Simmons' statement was not admissible\r\nunder the co-conspirator exception since, even if made during the conspiracy,\r\nthe statement in no way advanced the conspiracy.  The Court of Appeals\r\nnonetheless affirmed in result, finding the statement admissible against\r\nSimmons as a statement against penal interest; the Court further held\r\nadmission of the statement did not violate Anders' Sixth Amendment right\r\nof confrontation, since Simmons was available and testified at trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We agree with the Court of Appeals' holding that Simmons' admission\r\nto the crime in no way furthered the conspiracy. Accord United States v.\r\nPosner, 764 F.2d 1535 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied (although statements\r\nmade to \"allay suspicions\" may be \"in furtherance\" of conspiracy, \"spilling the\r\nbeans\" does not further conspiracy); United States v. Pallais, 921 F.2d 684\r\n(7th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 134 (1991) (casual admissions of\r\nculpability are not \"in furtherance\" of conspiracy and are insufficiently\r\nreliable to be considered by the jury).  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals\r\ncorrectly ruled the statement was not admissible under the co-conspirator \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Although much circumstantial evidence was presented, the statement\r\nattributed to Simmons was the only direct evidence of Anders' participation\r\nin the fire. \r\n  \r\np.5\r\n\r\nSTATE v. ANDERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexception. See State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 42, 282 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1981)\r\n(exception to rule against hearsay permits statements of one conspirator\r\nmade during the pendency of the conspiracy, and in furtherance thereof, to\r\nbe admitted against a co-conspirator once prima facie evidence of a conspiracy\r\nis proved); see also South Carolina Rules of Evidence, Rule 801(d)(2)(e).2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n However, we disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that\r\nSimmons' statement was nonetheless admissible as a statement against his\r\npenal interest. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Out-of-court statements against penal interest, made by an unavailable\r\ndeclarant, are admissible in both civil and criminal trials. State v. Doctor,\r\n306 S.C. 527, 413 S.E.2d 36 (S.C. 1992).  See also SCRE, Rule 804(b)(3).\r\nWhere the declarant is available to testify, the exception is inapplicable.\r\nState v. McKnight, 321 S.C. 230, 467 S.E.2d 919 (1996).  Here, as Simmons\r\nwas available and did testify, the exception for statements against penal\r\ninterest is clearly inapplicable.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in\r\nadmitting the statement under this exception.3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Court of Appeals further found that, since Simmons was present\r\nand testified at trial, there was no Confrontation Clause violation in its\r\nadmission.  In light of the fact that Simmons' statement was not admissible \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 This case was tried in May, 1995, prior to the effective date of the\r\nSouth Carolina Rules of Evidence (SCRE). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 3 The only other conceivable basis upon which to justify admission of\r\nSimmons' statement against Anders would be as a prior inconsistent\r\nstatement.  The timing of Sutherland's testimony precludes its use in such\r\na manner.  See Commonwealth v. Sopota, 587 A.2d 805 (Pa. 1991)(admission\r\nof prior inconsistent statement of a witness, for its substantive value, without\r\nthe person first taking the stand and denying having made it, is reversible\r\nerror).  In Sopota, the court held the error was not cured when the declarant\r\nwas subsequently called as a witness by the defendant; once the declarant's\r\nstatement had been introduced by the state, the defendant was virtually\r\ncompelled to call the declarant in order that the declarant could explain the\r\ndiscrepancies. Id. at 809-811.  As in Sopota, once the State introduced\r\nSutherland's testimony, Simmons had little alternative but to take the stand\r\nand either explain or deny the statement attributed to him. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.6\r\n\r\nSTATE v. ANDERS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst Anders,4 we need not address the Confrontation Clause issue.5 The\r\nCourt of Appeals' opinion is \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nREVERSED.6 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 The statement was admissible against Simmons as an admission.  The\r\nfact that it was an admission by Simmons, however, does not render it\r\nautomatically admissible against Anders.  On the contrary, Rule 801(d)(2)\r\nprovides a statement is an admission if it is \"offered against a party and is\r\n(A) the party's own statement in either an individual or a representative\r\ncapacity...\" The statement here was not Anders' \"own  statement,\" and was\r\nclearly therefore not admissible as an admission against Anders. Accord,\r\nUnited States v. Hay, 122 F.3d 1233 (9th Cir. 1997)(codefendant's admissions\r\nnot admissible as nonhearsay against defendant under party admission\r\nexemption). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n To the extent the statement was admissible against Simmons, it should\r\nhave been redacted to omit any reference to Anders. Accord.  State v. Clark,\r\n286 S.C. 432, 334 S.E.2d 121 (1985) (it is error to admit codefendant's\r\nconfession without redacting references to defendant). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 5 To the extent the Court of Appeals addressed the Confrontation Clause\r\nissue, its opinion is vacated. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n6 Our opinion in no way impacts Simmons' convictions. \r\n  \r\np.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24807","title":"State v.

At trial,\r\nappellant admitted stabbing his girlfriend, Kelly Morris, and a friend,\r\nTerry Wright, in the mobile home where the three of them had been\r\nliving.  On appeal, appellant challenges only the burglary conviction.  He \r\n  \r\np.7\r\n\r\nSTATE v. COFFIN \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontends he was lawfully entitled to enter the dwelling where the crimes\r\nwere committed and therefore the trial judge erred in denying his motion\r\nfor a directed verdict on the burglary charge.  We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Kelly Morris leased a mobile home at the Evans Mobile Home Park.\r\nIn November 1995, appellant moved in with her and Terry Wright who\r\nwas already staying there.  Because Kelly's lease provided that a visitor\r\nstaying more that five days had to be approved by the landlord, appellant\r\nwent to the landlord for approval.  The landlord affixed a copy of\r\nappellant's driver's license to the lease which indicated he considered\r\nappellant \"a legal qualified person living in that mobile home.\" Appellant\r\ndid not sign the lease but, according to the landlord, he did pay the rent\r\nseveral times. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On February 22, 1996, appellant and Kelly had an argument and\r\nshe threw him out.  Appellant took his clothes and left.  Appellant\r\ntestified he was upset because Kelly gave no explanation and he felt he\r\nshould not have to leave since he had paid rent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Appellant returned to the mobile home two or three times that day\r\nbut Kelly told him to go away and refused to answer the door. When\r\nappellant returned later that evening, he thought he could hear Kelly and\r\nTerry having sex in the mobile home.  He became enraged and pried the\r\nfront door open with a knife.  Appellant found Terry in the bedroom and\r\nstabbed him several times.  When Terry fled the mobile home, appellant\r\nreturned to the living room where he stabbed Kelly, who was drunk and\r\nlying on the couch., and left the scene.  Kelly died later at the hospital.\r\nAppellant turned himself in after hearing of her death on a news\r\nbroadcast that night. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The element of first degree burglary at issue here is the requirement\r\nthat the perpetrator enter a dwelling without consent.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n16-11-311(A) (Supp. 1997).  The term \"enter a building without consent\" is\r\nstatutorily defined to mean \"to enter a building without the consent of the\r\nperson in lawful possession.\" S.C. Code Am. Â§ 16-11-310(a) (Supp. 1997).1 \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 \"Building\" encompasses the term \"dwelling.\" State v. Goldenbaum, 294\r\nS.C. 455, 365 S.E.2d 731 (1988). \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nSTATE v. COFFIN \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed Kelly was a person in lawful possession and that she did\r\nnot consent to appellant entering the mobile home at the time of the\r\nstabbings.  Appellant claims, however, he too was a person in lawful\r\npossession of the mobile home and therefore he did not need consent to\r\nenter.  Appellant points to the evidence he paid rent and was approved by\r\nthe landlord. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We find the motion for directed verdict was properly denied based on\r\nevidence appellant was not in lawful possession of the mobile home at the\r\ntime of the stabbings.  Terry Wright testified Kelly had the only key to\r\nthe mobile home.  Her name was the only name signed on the lease;\r\napellant's identification was affixed to it pursuant to a clause requiring\r\nthat \"visitors\" be approved.  Further, the landlord testified he had nothing\r\nto do with a lessee's decision to evict an approved visitor. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n This evidence supports the inference appellant was a guest in Kelly's\r\nhome and she was entitled to terminate appellant's lawful possession by\r\nevicting him as she did before the stabbings occurred.  Accordingly, this\r\nevidence presents a jury issue whether appellant was in lawful possession\r\nof the mobile home at the time of the stabbings. Accord State v. Tolbert,\r\n488 N.W.2d 11 (Ct.  App.  Minn. 1992) (question for jury where defendant's\r\nlawful possession turns on whether defendant was a guest whose tenancy\r\nwas effectively terminated by lessee).  The charge of burglary was\r\ntherefore properly submitted to the jury. See State v. Long, ___ S.C. ___,\r\n480 S.E.2d 62 (1997) (directed verdict properly denied where there is any\r\ndirect or substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to\r\nprove the guilt of the accused or from which his guilt may fairly and\r\nlogically be deduced). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24816","title":"In the Matter of H.

Emory Smith,\r\nboth of Columbia, for complainant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n PER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, a three-member\r\nhearing panel found Respondent H. Jackson Gregory committed misconduct\r\nas described below.  The panel recommended a sixty-day suspension.  On\r\nreview, the Investigative Panel adopted the hearing panel's findings of facts\r\nand conclusions of law.  It also recommended a sixty-day suspension.  We\r\nagree with the panel's findings and conclusions as to misconduct. 1 However,\r\nwe find Respondent's acts warrant a 30 day suspension from the practice of\r\nlaw.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTHE LUTHI MORTGAGE/FALLAW MATTER \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Respondent has essentially admitted to the misconduct found by the\r\npanel.  His only real contention regards the appropriate sanction. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 2 Respondent is currently on interim suspension in an unrelated matter;\r\nwe emphasize that the current 30-day suspension shall have no effect upon\r\nRespondent's interim suspension. \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GREGORY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In 1991 Luthi Mortgage Company (\"Luthi\") hired Respondent to conduct\r\na title search and close a loan on a piece of residential real estate.  At the\r\ntime, the owner of record was Maxine Fallaw.  However, a man named.  Lloyd\r\nPrevette had applied for the mortgage.  By means of a convoluted\r\narrangement, the specific terms of which have never been determined,\r\nPrevette was to gain title to the property in trust and then mortgage it as\r\ntrustee.3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Luthi was aware Prevette was mortgaging the property as trustee.\r\nHowever, it is unclear how much it, or Respondent, knew about the\r\nunderlying arrangement between Fallaw and Prevette.  Luthi's witness\r\ntestified the company agreed Prevette could borrow the money in trust so\r\nlong as Respondent verified the validity of the trust, gave them a copy of the\r\ntrust agreement, and provided written authorization for Prevette to mortgage\r\nthe property.  Luthi claimed it never knew who the beneficiary of the trust\r\nwas. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the closing, the following documents, all drafted by Respondent, were\r\n\r\n3 Fallaw had an outstanding mortgage on this property, wanted some\r\nalternative financing, and was having difficulty getting lender approval.  A\r\nreal estate broker introduced her to Prevette.  She and Prevette came to an\r\nagreement, the terms of which have been hotly disputed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Fallaw claimed Prevette was helping her procure a \"reverse mortgage\"\r\nwhereby Prevette would pay off her mortgage, make certain desired\r\nimprovements, and allow her to live there in exchange for receiving title\r\nwhen she died or left.  Prevette claimed Fallaw agreed to deed the property\r\nto him and he would mortgage it.  The mortgage proceeds would be used to\r\npay off Fallaw's outstanding mortgage, make the improvements, and pay\r\nPrevette a fee.  Fallaw would live on the property, make the loan payments,\r\npay the property taxes and insurance, and maintain the property.  When the\r\nentire loan was paid in full, Prevette would deed the property back to Fallaw.\r\nA written agreement embodying the terms as stated by Prevette was\r\nintroduced into the record.  Respondent claimed he was unaware this\r\nagreement existed until much later, when it was produced during the course\r\nof the civil litigation described infra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The panel did not find credible Fallaw's testimony that she never\r\nsigned this agreement.  Nor did they find credible Fallaw's testimony that\r\nshe did not realize she was deeding her property to Prevette and he was\r\nmortgaging it. \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GREGORY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexecuted: \r\n  \r\n (1)   a deed transferring title to the property from Fallaw to\r\n Prevette as trustee with stated consideration of \"One Dollar\r\n and the assumption of a mortgage to Commercial Credit\r\n Corporation with a balance of $27,300;\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(2)   a promissory note to Luthi in the amount of $65,012.81,\r\n signed by Prevette, both as trustee and individually; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(3)  a mortgage by Prevette to Luthi in the amount of\r\n $65,012.81, signed by Prevette, both as trustee and\r\n individually; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(4)   a Land Trust Agreement creating a trust comprised of the\r\n property, designating Prevette as trustee and Fallaw as\r\n sole beneficiary; and \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(5)   an Assignment of Beneficial Interest in Land Trust\r\n transferring all of Fallaw's beneficial interest in the newly-\r\n created land trust to Prevette. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter the closing, Respondent deposited the loan proceeds into his trust\r\naccount and made disbursements, the details of which will be discussed infra.\r\nHe never sent Luthi the requested trust documents or written authorization\r\nfor Prevette to mortgage the property.  Fallaw continued to live in the house.\r\nHer outstanding mortgage was paid and the improvements to the property\r\nwere made. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n However, no payments on Luthi's mortgage were ever made, resulting\r\nin Luthi instituting a foreclosure action in July 1992.  Prevette, the sole\r\nnamed defendant, defaulted and the master foreclosed in December 1992.\r\nThe property was sold to Luthi at a foreclosure sale in February 1993.\r\nUltimately, the foreclosure was nullified by court order after Fallaw filed a\r\ncivil lawsuit against Luthi, Prevette, and Respondent on various causes of\r\naction.  Judgments were rendered against Prevette and Respondent in this\r\nlawsuit. While the case was on appeal, all parties entered into a settlement\r\nagreement which resulted in Fallaw getting her property back with a new\r\nmortgage. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The panel found Respondent committed misconduct in two areas of this\r\ntransaction.  First, it found Respondent violated Rule 1.1, Rule 407, SCACR, \r\n  \r\np.10\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GREGORY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin drafting the trust documents used at closing.  Second, it found Respondent\r\nviolated Rule 1.5, Rule 407, SCACR, in disbursing the loan proceeds.4\r\nRespondent does not dispute these findings, candidly admitting mistakes were\r\nmade in both areas. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Rule 1.1 requires an attorney to provide competent representation to\r\n a client.  \"Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill,\r\n thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\"\r\n Rule 1.1, Rule 407, SCACR.  Respondent was hired to paper a complicated\r\n real estate transaction, a primary component of which was to set up a land\r\n trust.5 He drafted a trust agreement whereby Prevette as trustee held legal\r\n and equitable title, and Fallaw as beneficiary retained an equitable interest.\r\n However, after creating this trust, he destroyed it with the assignment\r\n agreement.  This assignment conveyed the equitable interest Fallaw had\r\n retained back to Prevette, thus merging the legal and equitable interests and\r\n as a practical matter ending the trust.  We agree with the panel's finding\r\n there was no justification for this assignment agreement, which gave Prevette\r\n full title to the property to the detriment of Fallaw6 and, ultimately, Luthi.\r\n Furthermore, Respondent did not comply with his client's request for certain\r\n important documents, and has offered no explanation for his failure to do so.\r\n As the hearing panel stated in its report: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 The complaint additionally alleged Respondent misappropriated client\r\nfunds; failed to account; and committed criminal acts or conduct involving\r\nmoral turpitude, fraud, deceit or dishonesty.  Rules 1.1; 1.15; 8.4; Rule 407,\r\nSCACR.  We agree with the panel's finding there is no clear and convincing\r\nevidence Respondent violated these provisions and therefore do not further\r\naddress the allegations. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 5 We decline to address the merit, or lack thereof, of this type of trust\r\narrangement, or the decision to use it in this case.  We are concerned with\r\nRespondent's actions in attempting to create it once the decision had been\r\nmade. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 6 The extent of Respondent's duty to Fallaw is unclear given the fact he\r\nwas not technically representing her.  The Complainant presented expert\r\ntestimony that typically an attorney in a residential real estate closing owes\r\nsome attorney-client duties to borrower, lender, and seller.  Regardless of any\r\nduties arising as a matter of law from this transaction, we find Respondent\r\nclearly undertook some duty toward Fallaw; his own testimony was that he\r\ndrafted the trust documents for her protection. \r\n  \r\np.11\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GREGORY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Although we do not find that Respondent knowingly participated\r\n in a fraud, his sloppiness in handling the closing and his lack of\r\n thoughtfulness in the documents he created for this transaction\r\n enabled Prevette to take great advantage of Fallaw, who\r\n obviously could not understand complicated legal documents and\r\n who came to suffer almost a catastrophic loss from the actions of\r\n Prevette. . . . At the very least, the incompetence with which\r\n Respondent handled this transaction facilitated [Prevette's]\r\n fraudulent attempt and embroiled Respondent's client, Luthi, in\r\n an embarrassing and expensive civil action.  Furtherrnore, if\r\n Respondent had only complied with Luthi's request to send it the\r\n trust agreement before the closing, Luthi probably would have\r\n either objected to the trust arrangement prior to the closing,\r\n required clarification of the parties' respective responsibilities, or\r\n at least brought Fallaw into the later foreclosure suit.  Any of\r\n these actions would have simplified things considerably. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe find Respondent's representation as the closing attorney in this matter\r\nfell below the standards set forth in Rule 1.1, Rule 407, SCACR.7 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The panel also found misconduct regarding Respondent's disbursement\r\nof the loan proceeds.  Respondent admits he failed to disburse $1000 from the\r\n$45,000 check he deposited into his trust account.  He claims the difference\r\nwas an inadvertent accounting oversight, the money was left in his trust\r\naccount, and he is ready and willing to give it to whomever is entitled to it. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Rule 1.15 requires a lawyer to \"promptly deliver to the client or third\r\nperson any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled\r\nto receive.\" It is clear that, regardless of Respondent's intent, he violated\r\nthis rule.  At the very least, Respondent's actions demonstrate a lack of the\r\ndue care required of attorneys when dealing with trust funds. See Rule 1.15 \r\n  \r\n\r\n7 Respondent also admitted he made mistakes in drafting the land trust\r\nagreement.  He used an agreement drafted five years earlier for another\r\ntransaction, merely removing the first page, copying the property's legal\r\ndescription, and having the parties sign blank pages at the end.  As a result,\r\nthe trust agreement Prevette and Fallaw executed made the law of Ohio\r\napplicable (instead of South Carolina) and had a life of twenty years (instead\r\nof one).  Respondent stated he \"got in a hurry\" because everyone was in a\r\nrush to close.  Though no harm to the parties resulted from Respondent's\r\nsloppiness, we find his inattention to detail further demonstrates his failure\r\nto provide competent representation, in violation of Rule 1.1. \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GREGORY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncmt., Rule 407, SCACR (\"A lawyer should hold property of others with the\r\ncare required of a professional fiduciary\").  Regarding the issue of who should\r\nreceive these additional funds, all injured parties in this transaction have\r\nnow been compensated as a result of the related civil litigation.  Therefore,\r\nwe order that Respondent turn the funds over to the Lawyers' Fund for\r\nClient Protection of the South Carolina Bar. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTHE MULL MATTER \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Mull hired Respondent to set up land trusts for three pieces of real\r\nestate.  The designated trustee was Mary Funderburk, the wife of a business\r\nassociate of Mull's.  Respondent prepared the necessary deeds transferring\r\ntitle and had at least two of them signed and recorded.8 However, the land\r\ntrust agreements were never executed.  Respondent testified Mrs. Funderburk\r\nnever came to his office to sign the trust agreements, despite his repeated\r\nattempts to get her to do so.  Ultimately, Mull terminated Respondent's\r\nrepresentation and had to get the properties transferred back in his name. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The panel found Respondent's violated Rule 1.1, Rule 407, SCACR, in\r\nrecording the deeds to Mrs. Funderburk without first (or contemporaneously)\r\nhaving the trust documents executed.9 It relied in part on the complainant's\r\nexpert witness, who opined deeding the property to a trustee without an\r\naccompanying land trust agreement would constitute incompetent\r\nrepresentation because there would be no written evidence of the beneficiary's\r\nretained interest.  We agree.  Respondent's actions created the potential for\r\nsevere prejudice to his client's rights in the property.  As it was, his conduct\r\nnecessitated Mull going to further effort and expense to regain title once the \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n8 It is unclear from the record whether the deed to the third property was\r\never recorded. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 9 The complaint alleged Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence\r\nand promptness; failed to keep the client informed and comply with\r\nreasonable requests for information; failed to deliver funds or property to a\r\nclient; and failed to deliver a full accounting.  Rules 1.3; 1.4(a); 1.15; Rule\r\n407, SCACR.  These allegations stemmed from Respondent's representation\r\nof Mull in the land trust and other matters.  We agree with the panel's\r\nfinding there is no clear and convincing evidence Respondent violated these\r\nadditional provisions and therefore do not further address the allegations. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.13\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GREGORY \r\n\r\narrangement fell through.10 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n For the foregoing reasons, we find Respondent's representation in the\r\nabove matters violated Rules 1.1 and 1.5, Rule 407, SCACR.11 His actions\r\nconstitute professional misconduct. See Rule 413, SCACR (defining\r\nmisconduct as actions violating the Rules of professional Conduct, see Â¶B;\r\nconduct tending to bring legal profession into disrepute, see Â¶D; conduct\r\ndemonstrating lack of professional competence, see Â¶E). 12 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We find the appropriate sanction for Respondent's conduct is a 30 day\r\nsuspension.  In addition, Respondent is ordered to enroll in and complete the\r\nLaw Office Management Assistance Program (LOMAP).  Finally, Respondent\r\nshall, within ten days from the date of this opinion, remit $1000 representing\r\nthe undisbursed amount of closing funds in the Luthi Mortgage/Fallaw matter\r\nto the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection of the South Carolina Bar. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n30 DAY SUSPENSION. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n10 We summarily dismiss Respondent's argument he cannot be found in\r\nviolation of Rule 1.1 because the complaint did not specifically allege it.  A\r\nliberal reading of the complaint shows its asserted violations of specified rules\r\nwere not intended to be exclusive.  Furthermore, Respondent was fully aware\r\nthis was an issue before the panel at the hearing. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 11 Respondent was also charged with misconduct arising from his\r\nrepresentation of a third client.  The panel found no misconduct as to this\r\nmatter and the complainant did not except to this finding.  We agree there\r\nis no clear and convincing evidence of misconduct and therefore decline to\r\naddress these allegations. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 12 The order adopting the new Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement\r\nprovided that any disciplinary case in which a hearing had been held by a\r\nhearing panel prior to January 1, 1997, would continue to conclusion under\r\nthe former Rule on Disciplinary Procedure.  As the panel hearing in this case\r\nwas held December 10-11, 1996, citations to Rule 413, SCACR, will be to the\r\nformer Rule on Disciplinary Procedure. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.14 \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24817","title":"In the Matter of Richard C.

Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n PER CURIAM: In this attorney grievance matter, Richard C. Bell\r\n(\"Respondent\") is charged with engaging in misconduct in violation of various\r\nprovisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and the\r\nRules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent's alleged misconduct relates to two separate matters: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. Forgery/Property Tax Matter \r\n  \r\n In 1989-90, Respondent, through Mulberry Properties, Inc., acquired the\r\nsole ownership interest in a condominium real estate venture known as\r\nMulberry Place, located in Charleston County.  The development loan and\r\nsubsequent financing for the real estate venture were provided by Newberry\r\nFederal Savings Bank (\"Bank\").   While Mulberry Place had been in \r\n  \r\np.16\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF BELL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment, a previous developer had contested the 1989 tax assessment on\r\nthe property.  In June 1990, Respondent pursued this dispute with the\r\nCharleston County Tax Assessor's Office. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In October 1990, Bank extended a loan to Respondent in the principal\r\nsum of $165,000.  The purpose of this loan, as indicated in the commitment\r\nletter, was to make necessary repairs to the project, to make current the\r\n1988 and 1989 property taxes (which had not been paid), and to maintain\r\nfunds to use for mortgage payments until the occupancy rate was raised. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n A mortgage, dated October 31, 1990, from Mulberry Properties, Inc. was\r\nexecuted by Respondent to secure the $165,000 loan.  On the same date, the\r\nclosing attorney issued an opinion letter stating that Bank had \"valid first,\r\nsecond and third mortgages on the property and their liens are paramount\r\nexcept for 1988 and 1989 property taxes which are past due and 1990 taxes\r\nwhich are a lien, though not yet due and payable, and all taxes subsequent\r\nthereto.\" Based on this title opinion, Bank obtained copies of the property\r\ntax execution notices and calculated the total amount of 1988 and 1989 taxes\r\nto be $31,656. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On or about November 9, 1990, Bank issued to Respondent a check in\r\nthe amount of $31,656 from the $165,000 loan amount.  The check was made\r\npayable to Respondent and to J. Al Cannon, Jr., Charleston County Sheriff,\r\nwho was the delinquent tax collector.  This check represented the exact\r\namount due on the 1988 and 1989 taxes.  The voucher slip attached to the\r\ncheck stated that it was payment for the 1988 and 1989 delinquent taxes on\r\nMulberry Place, Inc. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Respondent received the check.  He signed his own name and also\r\nsigned on the back of the check the name of Sheriff Cannon.  This was done\r\nwithout the sheriff s knowledge, permission, or consent.  Respondent\r\ndeposited this check into the Mulberry Place operating account at Lowcountry\r\nSavings Bank (\"Lowcountry Bank\").  Respondent did not pay any of the\r\nMulberry Property taxes, nor did he notify Bank of his failure to do so. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Respondent's check stubs for the Lowcountry Bank Mulberry Place\r\noperating account show a check number 136, dated November 13, 1990,\r\nissued to \"J.  Al Cannon, Jr., County Sheriff, Mulberry Taxes,\" in the amount\r\nof $31,656.  Check number 136 was not received or processed by the\r\nDelinquent Tax Department of the Charleston County Sheriff's Office.\r\nRespondent claimed that he took the check to the tax office and tried to pay\r\nthe 1990 taxes instead of the 1988-89 taxes; however, officials would not \r\n  \r\np.17\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF BELL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccept the payment.  The check never cleared through Respondent's\r\nLowcountry Bank Mulberry Place operating account.  Respondent testified\r\nthat he returned check number 136 to the checkbook, but it was subsequently\r\nmisplaced.  However, the check stub was never marked \"void,\" and the check\r\nstubs continued to reflect a balance as if the $31,656 check had cleared the\r\naccount, although the monthly bank statements showed that it had not.1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In December 1990, Respondent asked that a portion of the funds\r\ncomprising the $165,000 loan not yet disbursed by Bank be applied to the\r\nNovember mortgage payments then due for the Mulberry project.  Respondent\r\nagreed that he would be responsible for financing the pending repairs to the\r\nproject apartment units and would complete them.  On December 6, 1990,\r\nRespondent signed a document, which stated in part, \"According to our\r\noriginal agreement, funds were used to pay all accounts current and any\r\npending property taxes due.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Because the Mulberry Place property taxes were not paid, the property\r\nwas sold for taxes in 1992.  Later in the year, Respondent's attempts to\r\nreduce the taxes on the 1989 assessment were finally successful.  The Tax\r\nAssessor reduced the 1989 taxes by over $28,000.  On March 8, 1993,\r\nRespondent advised Bank that the Mulberry Place property had been sold for\r\ntaxes and had to be redeemed no later than July 1993.  A Vice President at\r\nBank contacted Respondent on or about April 12, 1993 and asked him why\r\nthe Charleston County tax collector had never received Bank's 1990 check.\r\nOn May 7, 1993, Respondent informed Bank that he had taken care of the\r\n1989 delinquent taxes for Mulberry, but he could not pay any other\r\ndelinquent taxes.  Bank sent a check to the Charleston County tax collector\r\nin the amount of $75,961 to pay the 1988, 1990, and 1991 property taxes due.\r\nTitle to all of the apartment units owned by Mulberry Properties, Inc. was\r\nconveyed by Respondent to Bank on February 7, 1994 in consideration of the\r\ncancellation of the notes and mortgages due to Bank. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Respondent was indicted in 1995 by the Charleston County Grand Jury\r\nfor forgery of Sheriff Cannon's name on the Bank check.  Respondent applied\r\nfor and was accepted into a. Pretrial Intervention Program under the\r\nsupervision of the Ninth Circuit Solicitor's Office.  Respondent completed the \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 On or about January 1991, a couple offered to sell Respondent their\r\nresidence located in Charleston County if Respondent could make a $25,000\r\ndown payment and close on the house in thirty days.  Respondent used\r\n$24,000 of the funds in the Lowcountry Bank Mulberry Place operating\r\naccount to make this down payment on the residence. \r\n  \r\np.18\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF BELL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProgram and made restitution to Bank in the amount of $31,656. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2. Martin Matter \r\n  \r\n Donna Martin, a resident of Utah, desired to adopt a child.  She sent\r\nher information to a South Carolina adoption specialist, who forwarded the\r\ninformation to five South Carolina attorneys specializing in adoptions.\r\nRespondent was one of these attorneys.  This information found its way into\r\nthe files of A Loving Choice Adoption Agency (\"Adoption Agency\").  Adoption\r\nAgency was operated by Respondent's wife, Mrs. Deborah Bell.  Respondent\r\nand Adoption Agency shared office space, a receptionist, a bookkeeper,\r\nsecretarial help, and, at one time, even a common phone number.\r\nRespondent and Mrs. Bell testified that Respondent represented Adoption\r\nAgency as its attorney.  Mrs.  Bell stated that when there are legal questions\r\nto be answered, they are referred to Respondent.  Adoption Agency, however,\r\ndoes not pay Respondent any regular fee or retainer for his services.  His fee,\r\nwhen he provides legal services to an adopting parent, is billed separately\r\nfrom the agency fee, directly to the adopting parent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Mrs. Bell contacted Ms. Martin about an adoption opportunity.  Ms.\r\nMartin testified that she agreed to pay $3000 to Adoption Agency to cover\r\nsuch expenses as counseling, food, lodging, and medical costs.  Ms. Martin\r\ncalled Respondent to follow through with the adoption.  She claimed that she\r\nspoke with Respondent a few times before the birth of the child being\r\nconsidered for adoption.  Ms. Martin believed that Respondent was\r\nrepresenting her in the adoption. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Respondent filed a petition in March 1995 in the family court.  This\r\npetition was accompanied by an affidavit signed by the birth mother.  The\r\naffidavit stated in part: \". . . I am a resident of the State of South Carolina\r\nand I have selected an Adoptive Parent from the State of Utah, who is\r\nrepresented by Richard C. Bell, Esquire, whom I believe to be a suitable and\r\nqualified adopting parent for this child.\"   Respondent stated that the\r\ndocument was prepared by Adoption Agency staff, and he filed it without\r\nclosely reviewing it. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n A few weeks later, the birth mother. gave birth to the child being\r\nconsidered for adoption.  Ms. Martin testified that she called Respondent, and\r\nRespondent arranged to obtain the necessary consent forms for adoption\r\nbefore Ms. Martin undertook the expense of traveling to South Carolina.  In\r\nlate March 1995, Respondent obtained the birth mother's signature on the\r\nconsent forms.  One form contained a statement that Respondent did not \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.19\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF BELL \r\n\r\nrepresent the prospective adoptive parent, Ms. Martin.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Ms. Martin took a flight to South Carolina and met Respondent and the\r\nbirth mother at the airport.  Ms. Martin delivered a check to Respondent for\r\n$3,365, payable to Adoption Agency.  Respondent presented to Ms. Martin a\r\nlegal risk document stating that the father of the child had not given consent.\r\nMs. Martin signed this document. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The next day the birth mother changed her mind about giving up her\r\nchild for adoption.  Ms. Martin called Respondent's office to obtain advice\r\nabout how to handle the situation, but he was not available.  Ms. Martin\r\ndecided to return to Utah.  She was unsuccessful in completing the adoption.\r\nIn April 1995, she wrote Respondent, indicating she was terminating his\r\nrepresentation and demanding reimbursement of funds paid to Adoption\r\nAgency.  Respondent replied and returned a large portion of the fee Ms.\r\nMartin had paid to Adoption Agency. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Panel found that Respondent's involvement in the adoption process,\r\nas well as the advice and document preparation that he provided, formed a\r\nbasis upon which Ms. Martin reasonably believed that Respondent was\r\nrepresenting her interest in this matter.  Respondent did not clearly explain\r\nto Ms. Martin whose interests he was representing.  She reasonably believed\r\nthat Respondent failed to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest and\r\nthat she had not been properly represented.    The Panel found that\r\nRespondent was representing multiple clients with adverse interests.\r\nBecause of his failure to recognize Ms. Martin as his client, he did not\r\nprovide competent representation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Respondent testified that he believed that Ms. Martin would finalize the\r\nadoption in Utah.  This testimony was contrary to his written response to the\r\nBoard of Commissioners; in that response, he stated that Ms. Martin was not\r\nsure whether she would proceed with the adoption in South Carolina or Utah,\r\nand if she had determined to finalize in South Carolina, then Respondent\r\nwould not have ultimately taken the mother's consents, but would have had\r\nanother attorney to obtain them.  The hearing Panel concluded that this\r\nprovided evidence that Respondent did engage in discussions with Ms. Martin\r\nabout adoption finalization, which would necessarily have involved legal\r\nissues. \r\n  \r\np.20\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF BELL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The hearing Panel's report, which discusses the above facts, was\r\nadopted by the full Panel.  Respondent did not file any exceptions to the full\r\nPanel's adoption of the report.  After examining the facts, we find that\r\nRespondent's misconduct has been proven by clear and convincing evidence,\r\nand this misconduct violates the following: Rule 407, SCACR: Rule\r\n8.4(b)(criminal acts that reflect adversely on lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness\r\nor fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c)(conduct involving moral\r\nturpitude); Rule 8.4(d)(conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepre-\r\nsentation); Rule 8.4(e)(conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of\r\njustice); Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client);\r\nRule 1.7(b)(lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that\r\nclient may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another\r\nclient or to a third person); Rule 2.2 (conditions under which common\r\nrepresentation is permissible); Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(5)(conduct tending\r\nto pollute the administration of justice). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Since Respondent does not contest the facts of this case, nor the rule\r\nviolations, the central issue before us is the sanction to be imposed.  We have\r\ntreated very seriously attorney misconduct in matters involving the forging\r\nof signatures, as well as misrepresentation and deceit. See In re T. Aladdin\r\nMozingo, Op.  No. 24769 (S.C. Sup.  Ct. filed Feb. 23, 1998)(Davis Adv.  Sh.  No.\r\n8 at 30)(Court accepted disbarment of attorney whose misconduct included\r\ntracing of a Supreme Court justice's signature on a purported family court\r\norder); State v. Belcher, 249 S.C. 301, 153 S.E.2d 921 (1967)(attorney\r\ndisbarred for forging special referee and circuit judge's names); In re Timothy\r\nWalker, 305 S.C. 482, 409 S.E.2d 412 (1991)(attorney indefinitely suspended\r\nfor forging circuit judge's signature); In re Marlene Sipes, 297  S.C. 531, 377\r\nS.E.2d 574 (1989)(attorney suspended for one year where she signed her\r\nhusband's name to checks, without his permission, and used Girl Scout funds\r\nfor her personal purposes); In re George Lyall, 328 S.C. 121, 492 S.E.2d 99\r\n(1997)(attorney suspended for nine months where his misconduct included\r\nforging wife's signature on a check for a trust and using funds for personal\r\npurposes). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In addition, we have sanctioned attorneys for representing conflicting\r\ninterests or not clarifying whom they represent. See In re Julian Morgan,\r\n288 S.C. 401, 343 S.E.2d 29 (1986)(attorney publicly reprimanded for\r\nrepresenting clients with conflicting interests); In re William Pyatt, 280 S.C.\r\n302, 312 S.E.2d 553 (1984)(attorney publicly reprimanded where he failed to\r\nexercise proper care and judgment in explaining to clients that he did not \r\n  \r\np.21\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF BELL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresent their legal interests). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We note that Respondent has previously been disciplined.  In 1986,\r\nRespondent was publicly reprimanded for taking control of a check issued to\r\na client's wife, who was an adversary to client in impending domestic\r\nlitigation, and for assuming control of her money in violation of a foreclosure\r\norder.  Two members of this Court dissented from the decision to impose a\r\npublic reprimand on Respondent, concluding rather that he should be\r\nsuspended for one year. See In re Richard C. Bell, 289 S.C. 290, 345 S.E.2d\r\n475 (1986). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The hearing Panel recommended a definite suspension of six months.\r\nThe full Panel adopted this recommendation.  We find Respondent's\r\nmisconduct warrants a nine month suspension.  Within fifteen days of the\r\ndate of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of\r\nCourt showing he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.22 \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24818","title":"Walton v.

Gilbert, both of\r\nHarvey &amp; Battey, P.A., of Beaufort, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n TOAL, A.J.: In this declaratory judgment action, Canal Insurance\r\nCompany (\"Insurance Company\") has petitioned this Court to review the\r\nCourt of Appeals' finding of coverage under S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 38-75-740 &amp;\r\n-750 (1989).  We affirm as modified. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n Insurance Company issued a policy to Carl Owens and Wayne Kinard\r\n(\"Insured\") -- who did business as Owens &amp; Kinard Transport, Inc. -- to cover\r\nsix tractors and one semi-trailer used in their pulpwood/logging business.\r\nThe policy was effective from January 2, 1992 until January 2, 1993.  On\r\nDecember 4, 1992, an employee of Insurance Company's underwriting\r\ndepartment mailed a renewal notice to Insured.  On December 16, 1992, a\r\ncustomer services representative for Insurance Services of Hampton, an\r\ninsurance agency, mailed an invoice to Insured for renewal of the policy.  No\r\nresponse was received from Insured. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On January 4, 1993, at 7:00 a.m., an employee of Insured was involved,\r\nwhile driving a company truck, in an accident with James Walton.  At 8:30\r\na.m. of the same day, Kinard telephoned the customer service representative\r\nfor Insurance Services regarding coverage for the truck.  Later in the day,\r\nOwens delivered a check to Insurance Services.  Insurance Services contacted\r\nInsurance Company, which approved a new policy, effective from 1:35 p.m.,\r\nJanuary 4, 1993 until January 4, 1994. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Walton filed suit against Insured for injuries sustained as a result of\r\nthe truck accident.   Insurance Company denied coverage.  Walton\r\nsubsequently commenced this declaratory judgment action to determine\r\nwhether coverage existed on January 4th when the company truck was\r\ninvolved in the accident.  The master in equity granted Walton's motion for\r\nsummary judgment, finding that insurance coverage existed on January 2 --\r\n4, 1993, during which time the accident occurred. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nInsurance Company appealed the matter.   The Court of Appeals \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.24\r\n\r\nWALTON v. CANAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naffirmed the master's decision on different grounds.  Insurance Company has\r\npetitioned this Court, arguing that the Court of Appeals erred in finding\r\ncoverage existed under the relevant statutes. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA.    APPLICABLE STATUTE \r\n  \r\n The dispute in this case centers on the interpretation of two statutes,\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 38-75-740 &amp; -750.  The first, section 38-75-740, concerns\r\nrestrictions on nonrenewal of policies, provides in relevant part: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (a) No insurance policy may be nonrenewed by an insurer\r\nexcept in accordance with the provisions of this section, and any\r\nnonrenewal attempted which is not in compliance with this\r\nsection is ineffective. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (b) A policy written for a term of one year or less may be\r\nnonrenewed by the insurer at its expiration date by giving or\r\nmailing written notice of nonrenewal to the insured and the\r\nagent of record, if any, not less than thirty days prior to the\r\nexpiration date of the policy. . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (d) The notice required by this section must be given or\r\nmailed to the insured and the agent at their addresses shown in\r\nthe policy or, if not reflected therein, at their last known\r\naddresses.  Proof of mailing is sufficient proof of notice. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (e) Any notice of nonrenewal shall state the precise reason\r\nfor nonrenewal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-740. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The subsequent section, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-750, concerns renewal\r\nof policies: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (a) If an insurer intends to renew a policy, the insurer shall\r\nfurnish renewal terms and a statement of the amount of\r\npremium or estimated premium due for the renewal policy period\r\nin the manner required by this section. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(b) If the policy being, renewed (hereinafter \"original policy\") \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.25\r\n\r\nWALTON v. CANAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis written for a term of one year or less, the renewal terms and\r\nstatement of premium or estimated premium due must be\r\nfurnished to the insured not less than thirty days prior to the\r\nexpiration date of the original policy. . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (d) The insurer may satisfy its obligation to furnish renewal\r\nterms and statement of premium or estimated premium due by\r\neither of the following methods: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (1) mailing or delivering renewal terms and\r\nstatement to the insured at his address shown in the\r\npolicy or, if not reflected therein, at his last known\r\naddress, not less than thirty days prior to expiration\r\nor anniversary; or \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (2) mailing or delivering renewal terms and\r\nstatement to the agent of record, if any, not less than\r\nforty-five days prior to expiration or anniversary,\r\nalong with instructions that the agent furnish the\r\nrenewal terms and statement to the insured not less\r\nthan thirty days prior to expiration or anniversary. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-750 (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In this case, the master held in his order that the renewal statute,\r\nsection 38-75-750, was the applicable statutory provision.  This statute\r\nrequires that notice be given \"not less than thirty days prior to the expiration\r\ndate of the original policy.\" The notice here was mailed on December 4,\r\n1992, which was 29 days prior to the January 2, 1993 expiration of the\r\npolicy.  Accordingly, the notice requirement was not satisfied.  The master\r\nfound that the policy went into effect without the payment of a premium,\r\nalthough the insured would have to pay the earned premium for the period\r\nin which the renewal policy was in effect. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Court of Appeals affirmed the master's order, but employed a\r\ndifferent analysis.  It reasoned that the nonrenewal statute, section 38-75-\r\n740, was the applicable statute.  The Court of Appeals found that Insurance\r\nCompany's attempt to terminate coverage, without having provided the\r\nrequisite notice, was ineffective.  The Court next looked to the renewal\r\nstatute, section 38-75-750, and concluded that because of the lack of notice,\r\nInsured had the right to cancel the renewal policy within the thirty day\r\nperiod following receipt of the renewal terms.  Because Insured had not \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.26\r\n\r\nWALTON v. CANAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelected to cancel the renewal policy at the time the accident occurred,\r\ncoverage under the policy had not yet terminated.  Insurance Company has\r\npetitioned this Court, arguing that the Court of Appeals erred in applying the\r\nnonrenewal statute. We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Definitions of the terms \"renewal\" and \"nonrenewal\" are found in S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 38-75-720 (1989).  \"Renewal\" means: \r\n  \r\n the issuance of or the offer to issue by an insurer a policy\r\n succeeding a policy previously issued and delivered by the same\r\n insurer or an insurer within the same group of insurers, or the\r\n issuance of a certificate or notice extending the term of an\r\n existing policy for a specified period beyond its expiration date. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-720(l).  \"Nonrenewal\" means \"termination of a policy\r\nat its expiration date. 1 \" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-720(5). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Axson v. A. Mortgage Company, Inc., 312 S.C. 433, 441 S.E.2d 193\r\n(Ct.  App. 1994), the Court of Appeals held that where an insurer issues\r\nproper notice of an offer to renew and the insured fails to take the necessary\r\nsteps to accept the offer, the policy has been nonrenewed by the insured, not\r\nthe insurer, and the requirements of section 38-75-740 are inapplicable.  We\r\naffirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Axson v. A. Mortgage\r\nCompany, Inc., 316 S.C. 253, 449 S.E.2d 491 (1994).  Our opinion discussed\r\nthat the insurance company offered to issue a policy succeeding the\r\nhomeowner's previous policy.  Since that act constituted a renewal of the\r\npolicy, insurance company did not need to provide written notice of\r\nnonrenewal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In light of the statutory definitions, as well as the Axson opinions, we\r\nconclude that in the present case Insurance Company attempted to renew the\r\npolicy, not to \"nonrenew\" it.  The document that Insurance Company sent on\r\nDecember 4, 1992 to Insured contains at the top of the page in large bold\r\nletters, the words \"RENEWAL NOTICE.\" The notice delineates premium\r\namounts for the different vehicles. Tt also states that \"If premium is shown,\r\ncoverage is same as on previous policy.\" Moreover, an employee of Insurance\r\nCompany declared, in an affidavit referring to the same document, that she\r\nsent out the \"renewal notice\" on December 4, 1992.  Clearly, this was an\r\n\"offer to issue ... a policy succeeding a policy previously issued and delivered \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 \"Expiration date\" means \"the date upon which coverage under a policy\r\nends.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-720(4). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.27\r\n\r\nWALTON v. CANAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby the same insurer.\" See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-720(l).  It was not a\r\nnonrenewal, the \"termination of a policy at its expiration date.\" See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 38-75-720(5). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Because renewal notices are governed by section 38-75-750, Insurance\r\nCompany had to furnish to Insured notice of the renewal terms \"not less than\r\nthirty days prior to the expiration date of the original policy.\" Here, the\r\n.policy expired on January 2, 1993; the renewal notice was sent out on\r\nDecember 4, 1992.  Because this was less than thirty days prior to the\r\nexpiration date of the original policy, Insurance Company violated the\r\nprovisions of section 38-75-750. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nB. REMEDY \r\n  \r\n Once it is ascertained that section 38-75-750 has been violated, it must\r\nthen be determined what the remedy should be.  Subsection (e) of S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 38-75-750 provides: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (e) If the insurer fails to furnish the renewal terms and\r\nstatement of premium or estimated premium due in the manner\r\nrequired by this section, the insured may elect to cancel the\r\nrenewal policy within the thirty-day period following receipt of\r\nthe renewal terms and statement of premium or estimated\r\npremium due.  Earned premium for any period of coverage must\r\nbe calculated pro rata based upon the premium applicable to the\r\noriginal policy and not the premium applicable to the renewal\r\npolicy. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-750(e) (emphasis added).  The words, \"the insured\r\nmay elect to cancel the renewal policy within the thirty-day period following\r\nreceipt of the renewal terms and statement of premium or estimated\r\npremium due,\" imply that there is an existing policy that one may \"cancel.\"\r\nIn other words, under the statute, Insurance Company's failure to provide\r\nnotice resulted in the automatic renewal of the policy for a limited period of\r\ntime.2 \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Insurance Company argues that even if section 37-75-750 is\r\napplicable, it would apply in a situation where the renewal policy, by express\r\npolicy language, either takes effect pursuant to a clause in the insurance\r\ncontract or provides a grace period in which the insured may pay an overdue\r\npremium prior to the lapse of the coverage.  Insurance Company further\r\nasserts that the intent of the section is to provide the insured with thirty \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.28\r\n\r\nWALTON v. CANAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Although the statute does not explicitly say how long the insured has\r\nto affirm the renewal of the policy, section 38-75-750(e), as noted above, does\r\nprovide that the insured may elect to \"cancel the renewal policy within the\r\nthirty-day period following receipt of the renewal terms and statement of\r\npremium or estimated premium due.\" (emphasis added).  The most reasonable\r\nconstruction of this statute is that the insured has thirty days, following\r\nreceipt of the renewal statement, to cancel (or affirm) the renewal.  In other\r\nwords, the policy is automatically renewed to the extent of time necessary to\r\ngive the insured thirty days, following receipt of the renewal statement, to\r\ndecide to cancel or not.  If the insured does not act within this thirty day\r\nwindow of time, then coverage will not extend beyond this period.3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n A number of reasons support such a construction of the statute.  First,\r\nthe alternatives (either having no sanction for insurance companies or\r\nproviding automatic renewal of the policy for the entire year) are not\r\nattractive.  A thirty day period following receipt of the renewal terms\r\nprovides a reasonable, but not excessive, amount of time for the insured to\r\ndetermine what he wants to do.  Such a rule punishes the insurance\r\ncompany to the extent of its error.  For example, the insured would get ten\r\nextra days if notice were sent out ten days late.  At the same time, because\r\nsuch a rule automatically extends the policy for thirty days following receipt\r\nof the renewal notice, it offers a stimulus to insurance companies to provide\r\ntimely notice of renewal to avoid such a situation.  A thirty day rule also has\r\nthe merit of being clear and definitive in its application. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In the instant case, we find Insured affirmed the policy within thirty\r\ndays of the date Insured received the renewal statement.  Insurance\r\nCompany sent out the renewal notice on December 4, 1992, but the record \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\ndays notice of the impending end of coverage and protect against \"premium\r\nshock.\"   The section prevents the charging of \"short rate\" cancellation\r\npremiums to an insured who cancels a renewal policy that has become\r\neffective after the insurer renewed the policy without the insured's consent\r\nor failed to properly notify the insured of the renewal offer thirty days in\r\nadvance of expiration.  There is absolutely nothing in the language of the\r\nstatute itself that would support this construction. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 Section 38-75-750(e) states that \"Earned premium for any period of\r\ncoverage must be calculated pro rata based upon the premium applicable to\r\nthe original policy and not the premium applicable to the renewal policy.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.29 \r\n  \r\n\r\nWALTON v. CANAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes not specify when Insured received the notice.4 However, even though\r\nthe exact receipt date is unknown, the earliest possible time it could have\r\nbeen received would have been on December 4th, the day the notice was\r\nmailed out.  Thirty days from December 4th was January 3rd, which was a\r\nSunday. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as case law, Sunday is not\r\nincluded in calculating the end of the thirty day period.  Rule 6(a), SCRCP\r\nprovides: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these\r\nrules, by order of court, or by any applicable statute, the day of\r\nthe act, event, or default after which the designated period of\r\ntime begins to run is not to be included.  The last day of the\r\nperiod so computed is to be included, unless it is a Saturday,\r\nSunday or a State or Federal holiday, in which event the period\r\nruns until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday,\r\nSunday nor such holiday. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 6(a), SCRCP (emphasis added). See Lindsey v. South Carolina Tax\r\nComm'n, 323 S.C. 57, 448 S.E.2d 577 (Ct.  App. 1994)(Rule 6(a), SCRCP\r\nprovides, in computing a time period prescribed by a statute, the last day of\r\nthe period is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or a State or\r\nFederal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day\r\nwhich is neither a Saturday, Sunday nor such holiday.). Accordingly, because\r\nthe last day of the thirty day period fell on a Sunday, the period ran until\r\nthe end of the next day, which was the end of January 4th.  Here, Insured\r\nsought to renew the policy on the morning of January 4th.  Thus, Insured\r\nacted within the thirty day period during which the policy was still in effect. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM AS MODIFIED the decision of\r\nthe Court of Appeals. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY., C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 4There is a copy in the record of the renewal notice sent to Insurance\r\nServices.

Code Ann.  Regs. 117-190 (Supp. 1997).  We find\r\nDepartment did not and, accordingly, affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n Two businesses, Black Burner Cafe and Treasures Revived, are located\r\nin a strip shopping center in Hilton Head, South Carolina.  Black Burner\r\nCafe occupies #11 Northridge Road, while Treasures Revived occupies #13\r\nNorthridge Road.  The businesses are accessible through a single entrance,\r\nleading to a common area.  From there, sliding glass doors open onto the two\r\nbusinesses.   Paneled walls separate Black Burner Cafe and Treasures\r\nRevived.  Each of these businesses has five Class III video poker machines\r\non its premises. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In July 1995, revenue officers for Department inspected the businesses\r\nand issued a violation report to AAA Amusements, Inc., the licensee of the\r\nvideo poker machines, for violating S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2804 (Supp. 1997).\r\nThe report charged that AAA had allowed the use of more than five video\r\npoker machines in a \"single place or premises,\" as defined by 27 S.C. Code\r\nAnn.  Regs. 117-190.  During the inspection, only one employee was found in\r\nthe common area of the businesses (i.e. each business did not have at least\r\none of its own employees present). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n AAA appealed the violation report, and Department issued a final\r\ndetermination upholding a fine and revocation of the licenses for the\r\nmachines.  AAA and the others,1 (collectively \"Business\") appealed Depart-\r\nment's final determination to the Administrative Law Judge Division.  The\r\nadministrative law judge upheld the violation on the grounds that each\r\nbusiness did not have an employee present in its game room during business \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 These included parties who were added because they are the current\r\nbusiness license holders or leaseholders at the premises. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.32\r\n\r\nMCNICKEL'S, INC. v. S.C. DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE\r\nAAA ENTERTAINMENT CORP., et al. v. S.C. DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nhours. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Business appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the\r\nadministrative law judge.  Business now appeals to this Court, raising one\r\nissue: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDid the South Carolina Department of Revenue exceed its\r\nregulatory authority under the Video Game Machines Act when\r\nit imposed the \"employee requirement\" found in South Carolina\r\nRegulation 117- 190?2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n Business argues that Department exceeded its regulatory authority\r\nwhen it imposed the \"employee requirement\" found in Regulation 117-190.\r\nWe disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Video Game Machines Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2770 et seq.\r\n(Supp. 1997), governs the licensing and use of video game \"machines,\" which\r\nare defined as \"electronic video games machine[s] that, upon insertion of\r\ncash, [are] available to play or simulate the play of games as authorized by\r\nthe commission utilizing a video display and microprocessors in which the\r\nplayer may receive free games or credits that can be redeemed for cash.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2772(5) (Supp. 1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Under section 12-21-2804, after July 1, 1994, \"the commission may not\r\nissue nor authorize to be maintained any licenses or permits for more than\r\nfive machines authorized under Section 12-21-2720(A)(3)3 at a single place or \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 McNickel's is one of the parties in Business's appeal.  During the\r\npendency of the administrative appeal, McNickel's commenced in circuit court\r\na separate action seeking a declaration that Regulation 117-190 is invalid.\r\nThe circuit court ruled against McNickel's, and McNickel's now appeals.\r\nBusiness's appeal, as well as the appeal of McNickel's, present the same\r\nissues.  Accordingly, we consolidate the appeal for the purpose of this opinion.\r\nSee Rule 213, SCACR (where the same question is involved in two or more\r\nappeals in different cases, the appellate court may, in its discretion, order the\r\nappeal to be consolidated). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 3 See S.C. Code Ann Â§ 12-21-2720(A)(3) (Supp. 1997)(\"a machine of the\r\nnonpayout type, in-line pin game, or video game with free play feature\r\noperated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of value except \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.33\r\n\r\nMCNICKEL'S, INC. v.

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\npremises.\"  In July 1995, the Department promulgated the following\r\nregulation: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Video Game Machines Act, found in Article 20, Chapter\r\n 21 of Title 12, limits the number of machines that may be located\r\n in a \"single place\" or \"premises.\"\r\n A single place or premises must be a fixed location.  It does\r\n not include moving property such as a boat or a train, unless\r\n such property is permanently affixed to a specific location.\r\n A \"single place\" or \"premises\" means a structure surrounded\r\n by exterior walls or firewalls consistent with the requirements of\r\n the applicable building code (or where no building code is\r\n applicable, a one hour rated firewall), provided such exterior\r\n walls and firewalls may not have any windows, doors or other\r\n openings leading to another area where video game machines are\r\n located.\r\n If a structure surrounded by exterior walls has two or more\r\n areas where video game machines are located, each surrounded\r\n by exterior walls or firewalls as defined and required above, the\r\n Department must review all the facts and circumstances to\r\n determine if each area in reality constitutes a single place or\r\n premise for video game machines.  In determining whether each\r\n entity is in fact a single place or premises, the Department of\r\n Revenue will consider the following factors: (1) Does each entity\r\n or business have a separate electric utility meter? (2) Does each\r\n entity or business have at least one separate employee on the\r\n premises during business hours? (3) Does each entity or business\r\n have a separate local business license where required? (4) Does\r\n each entity or business have a separate state sales tax license?\r\n A positive answer to these four questions is required for each\r\n area to be considered a \"single place or premise\" for purposes of\r\n The Video Game Machines Act. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann.  Regs 117-190 (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Business argues that Department exceeded its regulatory authority\r\nwhen it imposed a requirement that each business must have at least one\r\nseparate employee on the premises. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nmachines of the nonpayout pin table type with levers or 'flippers' operated by\r\nthe player by which the course of the balls may be altered or changed.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.34 \r\n  \r\n\r\nMCNICKEL'S, INC. v.

Heyward v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 240'S.C. 347, 126 S.E.2d\r\n15 (1962).  An administrative regulation is valid as long as it is reasonably\r\nrelated to the purpose of the enabling legislation. Hunter &amp; Walden Co. v.\r\nSouth Carolina State Licensing Bd. for Contractors, 272 S.C. 211, 251 S.E.2d\r\n186 (1978).  Although a regulation has the force of law, it must fall when it\r\nalters or adds to a statute. Society of Professional Journalists v. Sexton, 283\r\nS.C. 563, 324 S.E.2d 313 (1984).  A rule may only implement the law. Banks\r\nv. Batesburg Hauling Co., 202 S.C. 273, 24 S.E.2d 496 (1943). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Hunter &amp; Walden, we addressed the question of the validity of a\r\nregulation promulgated by the State Licensing Board for Contractors.  S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 40-11-160 (1976) provided that the Board, shall not issue a\r\nlicense to any contractor who contracts or intends to contract for a job in\r\nexcess of $75,000 \"until such contractor furnishes the Board with a financial\r\nstatement certified by a certified public accountant . . . .\" The Board had\r\npromulgated a regulation providing that in order to comply with section 40-\r\n11-160, a contractor must show a net worth of $50,000 to be licensed.  This\r\nCourt found the regulation to be valid because it was \"a natural amplification\r\nof the Code Section which requires that a financial statement be submitted.\"\r\nHunter &amp; Walden, 272 S.C. at 213, 251 S.E.2d at 186.  The challenged\r\nregulatory provision bore a reasonable relation to the statutory requirement\r\nthat a financial statement be submitted with a contractor's application. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n More recently, in U.S. Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Transportation, 324 S.C. 1, 481 S.E.2d 112 (1997), we held\r\nthat a Department of Transportation regulation was reasonably related to the\r\npurpose of the Highway Advertising Control Act.  The relevant statute\r\ndeclared that a business does not qualify as a commercial or industrial\r\nactivity unless it is \"visible from the main traveled way.\" The Department\r\nof Transportation, by regulation, defined \"visible\" as \"capable of being seen,\r\nand readily recognized as a sign or commercial or industrial activity by a\r\nperson of normal visual acuity.\" We found that the regulation did not\r\nimpermissibly expand the requirement of visibility. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We find under the facts of the present case that Department did not\r\nexceed its authority in imposing an employee requirement under Regulation\r\n117-190.    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2798 (Supp. 1997) provides:  \"The\r\ndepartment may promulgate regulations pertaining to the machines and \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.35 \r\n  \r\n\r\nMCNICKEL'S, INC. v. S.C. DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE\r\nAAA ENTERTAINMENT CORP., et al. v. S.C. DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\npersons licensed by it.\"1 The critical question is whether Department\r\nexceeded its authority by defining a \"single place or premises\" to require that\r\nleast one separate employee on the premises during business hours.\" See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 117-190. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Regulation 117-190 sets forth a number of criteria for determining\r\nwhether an entity is in fact a \"single place or premises.\" These include such\r\ntests as whether the entity has a separate utility meter; whether it has a\r\nseparate local business license; whether it has a separate state sales tax\r\nlicense; and whether it has at least one employee on the premises during\r\nbusiness hours.  We find that these criteria, including the last one, are\r\nreasonably related to the purpose of the statute.  Without at least one\r\nemployee, it would be possible for video poker operators to largely circumvent\r\nthe \"single place or premises\" requirement, by securing separate licenses for\r\ntechnically separate, but practically joined, businesses.  The single employee\r\ncriterion is reasonably related to determining whether each entity operates\r\nas a separate place.  The present regulation is a natural amplification of the\r\nstatute. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Business argues that Department can only regulate machines and\r\npersons licensed by Department and cannot impose requirements upon a\r\nbusiness in which the machine is located.  \"Machines,\" \"persons licensed,\" and\r\nthe \"businesses\" that operate them are so interconnected that it would be\r\ndifficult to issue a regulation bearing on one, but which would not have an\r\neffect on another of these entities.  Accordingly, we reject this argument. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the orders Upholding the validity\r\nof Regulation 117-190. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FINNEY, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ-, and Acting Associate\r\nJustice George T.

The Legislature enacted South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-\r\n60, which took effect June 3, 1986.  Under this statute, both first degree\r\nburglary and armed robbery were defined as violent crimes.  The parole\r\neligibility statute denied parole to those \"serving a sentence for a second\r\nor subsequent conviction, for violent crimes ....... S.C. Code Ann.

PSC \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n WALLER, A.J.: On appeal is an order denying Appellant Heater\r\nof Seabrook's application for a rate increase.  We reverse the Public Service\r\nCommission's order and remand for further findings. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTS/PROCEDURAL POSTURE \r\n  \r\n On January 13, 1994 Heater of Seabrook (\"Utility\"), a water and sewer\r\nutility, applied to Respondent Public Service Commission (\"PSC\") for a rate\r\nincrease.  Utility sought a rate increase of 10.40% for water and 34.02% for\r\nsewer, for a combined overall rate increase of 20.67%. The South Carolina\r\nConsumer Advocate and the Town of Seabrook Island were granted leave to\r\nintervene.  After a public hearing, the PSC issued Order Number 94-644,\r\ndated July 11, 1994, denying Utility's request.  The denial was affirmed by\r\nthe circuit court.  Utility appealed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We reversed, citing two errors in the PSC's order: (1) the comparison\r\nof Utility's current test year expenses with those from random prior calendar\r\nyears in deciding whether Utility's expenses had increased enough to justify\r\na rate increase; and (2) the treatment of availability fees as operating\r\nrevenues.  We instructed the PSC on remand (1) to compare Utility's current\r\ntest year expenses only with the test year expenses from Utility's previous\r\nrate case; and (2) to treat availability fees as contributions in aid of\r\nconstruction rather than revenues. Heater of Seabrook, Inc. v. PSC, 324 S.C.\r\n56, 478 S.E.2d 826 (1996) (\"Heater I\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On remand, the PSC re-analyzed Utility's application in light of Heater\r\nI. On February 21, 1997 it issued Order Number 97-114 again denying\r\nUtility's request for a rate increase.  The PSC supplemented its findings in\r\nOrder Number 97-251, dated March 27, 1997, denying Utility's petition for\r\nrehearing.  The circuit court affirmed.  Utility again appeals. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\nI.    Did the PSC employ the appropriate rate setting method? \r\n  \r\nII.

PSC \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI.    Rate Setting Method \r\n  \r\n Utility argues error in the PSC's decision to employ the \"operating\r\nmargin\" method1 in setting the appropriate rate of return.  Instead, it argues\r\nthe PSC should have used the \"rate of return on rate base\" method.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The PSC employed the operating margin method in its initial 1994\r\norder.  In Heater I, we addressed the PSC's choice, while not explicitly ruling\r\non it, \"simply to provide the Commission with some meaningful guidance.\"\r\n324 S.C. at 64, 478 S.E.2d at 830.  We first noted there was no statutory\r\nrequirement that the PSC use any particular rate setting method3, and\r\ntherefore it had \"wide latitude\" to determine an appropriate method.  We\r\ncontinued: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n This does not mean, however, that a particular methodology\r\nmay not be more appropriate than another under a specific set\r\nof circumstances.  In fact, the use of a methodology related to the\r\nactual circumstances faced by a utility company may almost\r\nguarantee the setting of a just and reasonable rate.  Therefore,\r\nalthough we will continue to look at whether there is substantial\r\nevidence supporting the rate of return set by Commission and\r\nwill not analyze in isolation whether the decision to use a \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1Determined by dividing the net operating income for return by the\r\ntotal operating revenues of the utility. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 2Determined by dividing the net income for return by the rate base.\r\nA utility's \"rate base\" is defined as the amount of investment on which a\r\nregulated public utility is entitled to an opportunity to earn a fair and\r\nreasonable return; and represents the total investment in, or the fair value\r\nof, the used and useful property which it necessarily devotes to rendering the\r\nregulated services. Hamm v. PSC, 309 S.C. 282, 285, 422 S.E.2d 110, 112\r\n(1992). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 3 See Nucor Steel v. PSC 312 S.C. 79, 85, 439 S.E.2d 270, 273 (1994)\r\n(\"The statutory mandate set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-5-240(H) only\r\nrequires the PSC to determine a fair rate-of-return and document fully the\r\nevidence which justifies that rate-of-return.  Nothing in the plain language\r\nof the statute requires the PSC to adopt any one particular price-setting\r\nmethodology.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.43\r\n\r\nHEAT'ER OF SEABROOK v. PSC \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticular methodology is so supported, we caution Commission\r\nto employ a methodology tailored to the facts and\r\ncircumstances of the case before it. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Here, the use of the operating margin, methodology\r\nseems unusual, to say the least.  Typically, that methodology\r\nis appropriate where a utility's rate base has been substantially\r\nreduced by customer donations, tap fees, contributions in aid of\r\nconstruction, and book value in excess of investment.  As the\r\ntestimony in this proceeding indicates, it is less appropriate for\r\nutilities that have large rate bases and need to earn a rate of\r\nreturn sufficient to obtain the necessary equity and debt capital\r\nthat a larger utility needs for sound operation. We caution\r\nCommission to consider the circumstances of the case before\r\nit when choosing a price-setting methodology. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Id. (emphasis supplied). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On remand in Order Number 97-114, the PSC again found the\r\n operating margin method was appropriate, \"as we have employed it with\r\n other water and sewer companies similarly situated.\" Supplemental Order\r\n Number 97-251 further elaborated, stating Utility was \"similarly situated to\r\n Carolina Water Service in size, for example, and we have used the operating\r\n margin methodology properly in the past in that company's rate cases.\" The\r\n PSC also stated, \"[D]istinguishing factors must be pointed out before the\r\n Commission may properly depart from its past methodology in similar\r\n circumstances.   No such factors were pointed out here. Thus, this\r\n Commission stuck to precedent.\" (emphasis supplied). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Utility argues the PSC's order did not follow the court's instructions in\r\nHeater I because its decision was not tailored to the factual circumstances of\r\nits case.  We agree.  In two separate places, we instructed the PSC to\r\nconsider the facts and circumstances of the case before it in making its\r\ndecision.  We also strongly suggested the PSC should consider the size of\r\nUtility's rate base in choosing the appropriate method. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Despite our instructions in Heater I, the PSC based its decision of the\r\nappropriate rate setting method on two things: comparison with other\r\nutilities and prior practice.  Nowhere in the orders was there a reference to\r\nany characteristic of Utility making the operating margin method\r\nappropriate.  We have previously addressed the impropriety of relying on\r\nprecedent as the basis for factual determinations. See, e.g., Hamm, 309 S.C. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.44\r\n\r\nHEATER OF SEABROOK v. PSC \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat 289, 422 S.E.2d at 114 (\"The declaration of an existing practice may not\r\nbe substituted for an evaluation of the evidence.  A previously adopted policy\r\nmay not furnish the sole basis for the Commission's action.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Moreover, even without the specific instructions from Heater I, the\r\norder is too vague to allow for more than cursory appellate review.  For\r\nexample, the order refers to Carolina Water Service, another water and sewer\r\nutility, as the comparison standard.  However, there is no evidence\r\nwhatsoever in the record giving any information about Carolina Water\r\nService.  Under these circumstances, it would be impossible for an appellate\r\ncourt to afford meaningful review to any comparison findings regarding this\r\nutility.  The same reasoning applies to the PSC's generic reference to \"other\r\nsimilarly situated\" utilities. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe findings of fact of an administrative body must be\r\nsufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to determine\r\nwhether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether\r\nthe law has been properly applied to those findings.  Implicit\r\nfindings of fact are not sufficient.  Where material facts are in\r\ndispute, the administrative body must make specific, express\r\nfindings of fact. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAble Communications, Inc. v. PSC, 290 S.C. 409, 411, 351 S.C. 151, 152\r\n(1986). See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (1986) (\"A final decision shall\r\ninclude findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated.  Findings\r\nof fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise\r\nand explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.\");\r\nHamm v. PSC, 302 S.C. 132, 394 S.E.2d 311 (1990). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We have repeatedly emphasized the need for specificity in\r\nadministrative orders.  The need is particularly great when complex issues\r\nare involved, such as those generally found in utility rate setting cases.\r\nAdministrative agencies are afforded wide latitude in making decisions, as\r\nshown in the deferential standard of appellate review.4 However, the writing \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n4Judicial review of PSC orders is controlled by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-\r\n380(A)(6) (Supp. 1997).  From this statute comes the well-settled \"substantial\r\nevidence\" rule: \r\n  \r\nThe findings of the Commission are presumptively correct and\r\nhave the force and effect of law.  Therefore, the burden of proof\r\nis on the party challenging an order of the Commission to show \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.45 \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEATER OF SEABROOK v. PSC \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof orders without sufficient detail or analysis, coupled with this standard of\r\nreview, can make their decisions as a practical matter unassailable on appeal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We find the PSC's order regarding the choice of rate method does not\r\ncomply with the specificity requirements for administrative orders as set forth\r\nabove. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII.   Evidentiary Support for Rate Set by PSC \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Utility next argues error in the PSC's finding an operating margin of\r\n8.6% was reasonable, and in the resulting denial of the rate increase.  We do\r\nnot reach the merits of Utility's argument because we find the PSC's order\r\ninsufficient for reasons similar to those discussed in Issue I. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Order Number 97-114, the PSC stated it had moved some $66,480\r\n(representing the availability fees collected) from revenue to contributions in\r\naid of construction, in accordance with the Court's order in Heater I. It then\r\ngranted Utility $66,480 in additional annual revenue to replace the\r\navailability fee amount, approving a water rate increase of approximately\r\n8.5% to earn this additional revenue.  On the issue of the appropriate\r\noperating margin, it stated it had re-examined the evidence in light of Heater\r\nI and had determined that only \"minimal increases in expenses\" had been\r\nincurred which were not significant enough to justify a rate increase.5 \r\n  \r\n\r\nthat it is unsupported by substantial evidence and that the\r\ndecision is clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence\r\non the whole record.    The Public Service, Commission is\r\nrecognized as the \"expert\" designated by the legislature to make\r\npolicy determinations regarding utility rates; thus, the role of a\r\ncourt reviewing such decisions is very limited. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPatton v. PSC, 280 S.C. 288, 290-91, 312 S.E.2d 257, 259 (1984) (internal\r\ncitations omitted). See also Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. PSC, 282 S.C. 430, 432,\r\n319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984) (Substantial evidence is something less than the\r\nweight of the evidence and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\nconclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's\r\nfinding from being supported by substantial evidence). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 5During the pendency of this appeal, the PSC had allowed Utility to put\r\nits requested increased rates into effect under bond.  Thus, the PSC ordered\r\nUtility to refund $308,739, representing the difference between the increased \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.46\r\n\r\nHEATER OF SEABROOK v. PSC \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The order gave no further reasons or findings of fact upon which the\r\ndetermination was based.  When Utility petitioned for rehearing, the PSC\r\ndismissed Utility's argument that Order Number 97-114 did not make specific\r\nfindings of fact: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We discern no error.  In remanding the case back to the\r\n Commission, the South Carolina Supreme Court expressed the\r\n opinion that the $66,640 in availability fees should not have been\r\n treated as operating revenue, because of a lack of substantial\r\n evidence.   In Order No. 97-114, we specifically granted the\r\n Company $66,480 in additional annual rate revenue to replace\r\n the availability fees that we formerly counted as regulated\r\n revenue.  We also noted that this was our only change from\r\n Order No. 92-1028, wherein we fully explained our reasoning on\r\n arriving at the 8.60% operating margin.  For this reason, we\r\n believe that all appropriate findings of fact are contained in\r\n Order No. 97-114, as that Order fully addressed the Supreme\r\n Court's concerns.   Findings of fact supporting the operating\r\n margin reached were fully explained in the prior Order, and\r\n other than the matters discussed above, were fully laid out\r\n therein. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n State law requires the PSC's \"determination of a fair rate of return\r\nmust be documented fully in its findings of fact and based exclusively on\r\nreliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\" S.C.

This order contained the PSC's findings from Utility's \r\n  \r\n\r\nrate and the rate the PSC ultimately allowed. \r\n\r\n 6For example, it is unknown whether the PSC meant that it found the\r\nincrease in expenses minimal on their face, or in the context of how such\r\nincrease ultimately factored into a resulting operating margin calculation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.47\r\n\r\nHEATER OF SEABROOK v. PSC \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprior rate case, where a rate increase was granted on December 12, 1992.\r\nWe find it inappropriate to refer to this order, which was based on evidence,\r\nand a prior test year, completely different from Utility's financial condition\r\nat the time of the current application.7 Finally, the only other source for the\r\nmissing findings of fact was an order we had already reversed on the basis\r\nof improper findings and comparisons. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n For these reasons, we find the PSC's order did not comply with\r\napplicable requirements, particularly those set forth in section 58-5-240, and\r\ntherefore cannot stand. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n We find Order Number 97-114, as supplemented by Order Number 97-\r\n251, insufficient for the reasons described above.  We therefore remand for\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Regarding the choice of rate\r\nsetting method, the PSC is ordered to comply with our directive as set out\r\nin Heater I and as again emphasized in this opinion.  Regarding the setting\r\nof an appropriate rate of return, the PSC shall be mindful of the legislative\r\nmandates of sections 1-23-350 and 58-5-240 in writing its order.8 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nFINNEY, C.J, TOAL, MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n7Thinking the PSC may have mistakenly referred to Order Number 92-\r\n1028 when it meant Order Number 94-644 (the original order from the\r\ncurrent application which was reviewed in Heater I), we specifically\r\nquestioned the PSC on this point at oral arguments The PSC affirmed it was\r\nreferring to the 1992 order. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 8In light of our disposition of Issues I and II, we decline to address\r\nUtility's due process argument.  However, due to confusion in the PSC's\r\ninterpretation of Heater I, we emphasize that our decision in no way reflects\r\non the PSC's duty to consider this issue on remand should it arise.\r\nFurthermore, we reverse the PSC's finding this issue is moot because the\r\nutility has been sold to the Town of Seabrook.  Clearly, determination of the\r\nissue, should it arise, would affect Utility's duty to pay the refund ordered\r\nby the PSC, see supra note 5. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.48 \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24822","title":"Sullivan v.

These offenses were committed on August 31, 1984.\r\nRespondent was sentenced to ten years in prison, suspended upon the service \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\nSullivan v. State \r\n\r\nof five years probation.   Respondent pled guilty in 1988 to voluntary\r\nmanslaughter and was sentenced to thirty years in prison.  This offense was\r\ncommitted on September 23, 1987. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Respondent was informed in 1989 by the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services that he was not eligible\r\nfor parole because he was serving a sentence for a violent crime, after having\r\nbeen convicted and sentenced for a separate violent crime.  Respondent's\r\nprior conviction was not defined as a violent offense until 1986.  In 1994,\r\nrespondent was informed that he was no longer considered to be a multi-\r\nviolent offender and would become parole eligible because the violent crimes\r\nstatute was amended.  However, in 1995, respondent was informed that he\r\nwas returned to his prior position because of the retroactive amendment to\r\nthe violent crime law. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The PCR Judge granted respondent's application for relief and\r\nfound that the retroactive application of the violent crime definition for\r\npurposes of parole eligibility violates the ex post facto clause of the State\r\nConstitution.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In 1986, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 was amended to provide that\r\nparole may not be granted \"nor is parole authorized to any prisoner serving\r\na sentence for a second or subsequent conviction, for violent crimes as defined\r\nin Section 16-1-60.\" The violent crime statute, S. C. Code Ann Â§ 16-1-60,\r\neffective June 3, 1986, defined ABIK as a violent crime.  Section 16-1-60 was\r\namended effective January 1, 1994 to require that the prior offense had to\r\nbe defined as a violent crime at the time of commission of the act.  In 1995,\r\nthe statute was amended to delete the above restriction. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The violent crime statute was applicable when respondent\r\ncommitted the second offense in 1987.  Accordingly, ABIK was considered a\r\nviolent crime making respondent ineligible for parole when he was sentenced\r\nfor the voluntary manslaughter committed in 1987.  The 1994 and 1995\r\namendments did not affect respondent's non-eligibility for parole.\r\nFurthermore, it is not a violation of the ex post facto clause for the\r\nlegislature to enhance punishment for an offense based on a prior conviction\r\nof the defendant, even though the enhancement provision was not in effect\r\nat the time of the previous offense.  State v. Dabney, 301 S.C. 271, 391\r\nS.E.2d 563 (1990).

LEXINGTON COUNTY RECREATION COMM.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njudgment in favor of respondent. Strother v. Lexington County Recreation\r\nComm'n, 324 S.C. 611, 479 S.E.2d 822 (Ct.  App. 1996) (Anderson, J.,\r\ndissenting). We affirm as modified. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Respondent operates the Pine Grove Softball Complex.  While\r\nRegina Strother was playing softball at the complex in May 1992, she\r\nattempted to catch a fly ball in the outfield, and in the process tripped\r\nover a \"popped-up\" water sprinkler head and twisted her left knee. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The softball complex contains five softball fields which are each\r\nequipped with a sprinkler system using the Rainbird R-70 (R-70) pop-up\r\nsprinkler heads.  Respondent installed the sprinkler system in the fall of\r\n1991.  The sprinkler system waters each of the zones of the fields in thirty\r\nminute intervals every night.  Petitioners alleged the sprinkler head on\r\nwhich she tripped was defective because it failed to retract. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Respondent moved for summary judgment asserting it did not\r\nhave actual notice of the alleged defect or the opportunity to correct the\r\ndefect as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(16) (Supp. 1997).\r\nRespondent presented the depositions of four of its maintenance personnel\r\nto support its claim. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n David Hendricks, the Director of Facilities and Maintenance for\r\nthe Lexington County Recreation and Aging Commission, was in charge of\r\nmaintenance at the ball field.  He started working with pop-up head\r\nsprinkler systems in 1984 or 1985 at Oak Grove, another Lexington\r\nCounty recreation facility.  Since 1987, Hendricks has been aware that\r\nsome types of \"pop-up head sprinkler systems sometimes pop up when the\r\nwater goes on and when it goes off, they don't go back down.\" He had no\r\nknowledge any sprinkler head at Pine Grove had ever failed to retract. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Earl Smith, maintenance supervisor for the Lexington County\r\nRecreation and Aging Commission, testified, before petitioner's accident, he\r\nwas aware pop-up sprinkler heads would sometimes pop up but not retract\r\nwhen the water was turned off.  He learned this from working with other\r\nsprinkler systems owned by the county.  He first became involved with\r\nRainbird sprinkler systems in 1984 at Oak Grove.  Smith testified the only\r\nproblem he experienced with Rainbird sprinklers was occasional clogging\r\nafter initial installation.  He also testified he had problems at Oak Grove\r\nwith other sprinkler systems which would pop up but not retract; however, \r\n  \r\np.6\r\n\r\nREGINA L. STROTHER, et al. v. LEXINGTON COUNTY RECREATION COMM.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe had never experienced this problem with a Rainbird sprinkler system.\r\nHe was not aware of any retraction failure of sprinkler heads at Pine\r\nGrove.  Smith testified, for purposes of repair, most systems are similar;\r\nhowever, the types of systems installed on the other softball fields are \"not\r\nthe same thing\" as the R-70.  According to Smith, the maintenance\r\nworkers for each field were responsible for ensuring sprinkler heads were\r\ndown before players used the fields, but there was no formal inspection\r\nprocedure. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Jerry Zenoni, the person who actually maintained Pine Grove,\r\nwas not aware of any sprinkler heads failing to retract. 1 Zenoni testified\r\nhe never checked to see if the sprinkler heads were down and was never\r\ntold to do so.  Thomas Davis, another maintenance worker, testified he\r\nhad never seen a sprinkler head fail to retract. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Petitioners argued respondent had actual notice because the\r\nmaintenance workers had general knowledge pop-up heads on some\r\nsprinkler systems did not always retract.  They further argued actual\r\nnotice of the defect in the R-70 sprinkler system could be implied, and\r\nmaintenance workers should have devised a system to check the sprinkler\r\nheads.  Petitioners presented three affidavits to support their position.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Petitioners submitted two affidavits of personnel assigned to\r\nmaintain the athletic fields at the University of South Carolina.  These\r\naffiants indicated they were familiar with pop-up sprinkler systems and \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Zenoni admitted since this incident he had noticed some of the R-70\r\nsprinkler heads failing to retract at the Pine Grove Softball Complex. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 2 Respondent argues the affidavits submitted by petitioners failed to\r\nmeet the requirements of Rule 56(e), SCRCP, because the affidavits failed\r\nto set forth specific facts indicating the affiants were sufficiently familiar\r\nwith the R-70 sprinkler system to allow them to comment on the problems\r\nof the system and to render opinions as to what the maintenance workers\r\nshould have known with respect to the sprinkler system.  We agree with\r\nthe Court of Appeals' resolution of this issue. 479 S.E.2d at 827, fn. 1.\r\nThe court found the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting\r\nthese affidavits based on the affiants' experience and familiarity with\r\nsprinkler systems. See Hoeffner v. The Citadel, 311 S.C. 361, 429 S.E.2d\r\n190 (1993) (a trial court's ruling on the admission of evidence will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of\r\nlaw). \r\n  \r\np.7\r\n\r\nREGINA L. STROTHER, et al. v. LEXINGTON COUNTY RECREATION COMM.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat \"occasionally the heads pop up and do not go back down.\" These\r\naffiants testified they do not allow use of the athletic fields until the fields\r\nhave been checked for protruding sprinkler heads. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Petitioners also submitted an affidavit from Jay Corley, an\r\nemployee of the company which sold the R-70 to the contractor who\r\ninstalled the system for respondent.  Mr. Corley stated he is familiar with\r\npop-up sprinkler systems because of his nine years experience working in\r\ndesign and sales for a Rainbird dealer.  He indicated he had knowledge of\r\nproblems with sprinkler systems including the fact that \"seldomly [sic] the\r\nheads pop up and do not go back down,\" and that had anyone called the\r\ncompany to inquire, the problem would have been explained to them. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The trial judge granted respondent's motion for summary\r\njudgment finding respondent did not have actual notice the sprinkler head\r\ninvolved in the incident failed to retract or that there had been problems\r\nwith the sprinkler heads at this particular ball field. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Court of Appeals affirmed finding petitioners did not show\r\nrespondent had actual notice of a defect in the sprinkler system. Strother, \r\n  \r\nsupra.  The Court of Appeals found the general knowledge that some types\r\nof pop-up sprinkler systems sometimes failed to retract was insufficient to\r\nprovide actual notice of the defect.  The court concluded actual notice\r\nunder Â§ 15-78-60 (16) means express notice thus eliminating the option of\r\nproving actual notice by circumstantial evidence. Id. Judge Anderson\r\ndissented finding this general knowledge was sufficient to provide actual\r\nnotice of the defect.  Judge Anderson found this case fell within the\r\ndefinition of \"implied actual notice\" which, in his opinion, South Carolina\r\nshould recognize as a definition of actual notice. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n ISSUE \r\n  \r\nWhat constitutes actual notice under the South Carolina Tort\r\nClaims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7S-60(16) (Supp. 1997) (the\r\nAct)? \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nREGINA L. STROTHER, et al. v. LEXINGTON COUNTY RECREATION COMM.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n STANDARD OF REVIEW3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Summary judgment is appropriate where it is clear there is no\r\ngenuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to\r\njudgment as a matter of law. Hamiter v. Retirement Division of South\r\nCarolina, 326 S.C. 93, 484 S.E.2d 586 (1997).  In determining whether any\r\ntriable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be\r\nreasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most\r\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Petitioners argue the Court of Appeals misapplied the\r\nrequirement of actual notice found in Â§ 15-78-60(16) (Supp. 1997).4 \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 In their brief, petitioners raise the question of who has the burden\r\nof proving actual notice.  Petitioners claim because respondent is asserting\r\nan affirmative defense under the Act, respondent has the burden of\r\nproving it had no actual notice of the defect.  For purposes of summary\r\njudgment, the moving party has the burden of proving no material fact\r\nexists. Standard Fire Co. v. Marine Contracting &amp; Towing Co., 301 S.C.\r\n418, 392 S.E.2d 460 (1990).  Once a party moving for summary judgment\r\ncarries the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for\r\nthe nonmoving party's case, the nonmoving party may not simply rest on\r\nmere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings. Baughman v.\r\nAmerican Tel. and Tel.  Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991).  Whether\r\npetitioners or respondent would have the burden of proving actual notice\r\nat trial is not an issue before this Court.  However, usually the plaintiff\r\nhas the burden of establishing notice in a negligence action. See  Simmons\r\nv. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 318 S.C. 310, 457 S.E.2d 608 (1995); Baugh\r\n&amp; Sons Co. v. Graham, 150 S.C. 398, 148 S.E. 220 (1929). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 4 Petitioners also argue because respondent created the defective\r\ncondition by installing the pop-up head sprinkler system at Pine Grove, no\r\nactual notice of the defect was required.  Petitioners failed to preserve this\r\nissue for review because they did not raise the issue below. Jackson v.\r\nSpeed, 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997).  Further, this argument is\r\nwithout merit.  Installation of this sprinkler system did not create a\r\ndangerous condition. Compare with Pinckney v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc.,\r\n311 S.C. 1, 426 S.E.2d 327 (Ct.  App. 1992) (knowledge could be inferred\r\nwhere the store owner created the dangerous situation by placing the\r\npoinsettias near the front of the store and the leaves were dropping on the \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nREGINA L. STROTHER, et al. v. LEXINGTON COUNTY RECREATION COMM.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to petitioners, respondent had actual notice of a defect in other\r\npop-up sprinkler systems.  Therefore, actual notice of the defect in the\r\nsystem that caused the accident could be implied.  The petitioners contend\r\na reasonable inquiry into whether the R-70 had problems similar to other\r\npop-up sprinkler systems would have revealed the problem. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Act precludes liability for \"maintenance, security, or\r\nsupervision of any public property, intended or permitted to be used as a\r\npark, playground, or open area for recreational purposes, unless the defect\r\nor condition causing a loss is not corrected by the particular governmental\r\nentity . . . within a reasonable time after actual notice of the defect or\r\ncondition.\" S.C.

However,\r\nin these cases, the appellate courts are simply referring to the fact that\r\ninquiry notice can have the same effect as actual notice, not that inquiry\r\nnotice is actual notice.  In our opinion, our appellate courts have\r\nconsistently distinguished between actual notice and constructive/inquiry\r\nnotice. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Court of Appeals then defines actual notice by dividing it\r\ninto two categories: express and implied.  Express notice is defined as\r\n\"embrac[ing] not only knowledge, but also that which is communicated by\r\ndirect information, either written or oral, from those who are cognizant of\r\nthe fact communicated.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1062 (6th ed. 1990); see\r\nalso 58 Am.Jur.2d Notice Â§ 6 (express actual notice includes direct\r\ninformation).  Implied actual notice is defined as \"a kind of actual notice\r\nwhich consists of knowledge of facts so informing that a reasonably\r\ncautious person would be led by them to the ultimate fact; that which, if\r\nprosecuted with ordinary diligence, will furnish information of fact.\" 66\r\nC.J.S. Notice Â§ 5 (1990); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1062 (6th ed.\r\n1990) (implied notice is also defined as \"one of the varieties of actual\r\nnotice (not constructive) and is distinguished from 'express' actual notice.\r\nIt is notice inferred or imputed to a party by reason of his knowledge of\r\nfacts or circumstances collateral to the main fact, of such a character as to\r\nput him upon inquiry, and which, if the inquiry were followed up with due\r\ndiligence, would lead him definitely to the knowledge of the main fact.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In our opinion, the definition of implied actual notice blurs the\r\ndistinction between actual and constructive notice because it appears to\r\nimpose a duty to inquire.  Our case law does not support this type of\r\nimplied actual notice.  Instead, under our case law, this type of implied\r\nactual notice is classified as constructive notice because of the duty to\r\ninquire. See Government Employees Ins.  Co. v. Chavis, supra.  Further,\r\nbecause we are to liberally construe the Act's provisions limiting liability\r\nin favor of the government, we refuse to adopt such a broad definition of\r\nactual notice which would classify this definition as a part of actual notice. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Court of Appeals then concluded the legislature intended\r\n\"to limit the exposure of the governmental entity to situations involving\r\nexpress notice, thus excluding a duty of inquiry.\" Strother, 324 S.C. at \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\nREGINA L. STROTHER, et al. v. LEXINGTON COUNTY RECREATION COMM.. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 619, 479 S.E.2d at 826 (emphasis added).  In our opinion, the court's\r\n decision erroneously eliminates the option of proving actual notice by the\r\n factual circumstances of the case (circumstantial evidence).  We find, in\r\n the context of the Act, actual notice means all the fact are disclosed and\r\n there is nothing left to investigate. Government Employees Ins.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.14\r\n\r\nSTATE v. GEORGE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n George was charged and convicted of murder, conspiracy to commit\r\n murder, and armed robbery.  He was sentenced to death.  In State v. George,\r\n 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1261 (1997), we\r\n affirmed George's conviction and sentence, but remanded the matter for an\r\n inquiry about one issue, namely, George's allegation that the indictment in\r\n the case was issued by a grand jury from which African Americans had been\r\n excluded.  On appeal, we observed that although the record contained no\r\n statistical evidence to support George's claim that African Americans had\r\n been systematically or deliberately excluded, it did appear that they were\r\n underrepresented on the grand jury in this matter.  Because the trial court\r\n had denied George's request for a separate hearing to present data pertaining\r\n to the disqualification of individual grand jurors in Horry County, we\r\n concluded that George was denied the opportunity, as outlined in Castaneda\r\n v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 97 S. Ct. 1272, 51 L. Ed. 2d 498 (1977), to provide\r\n statistics comparing the proportion of African Americans in Horry County to\r\n the proportion called to serve as grand jurors. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Accordingly, the matter was remanded to the circuit court to carry out\r\na factual inquiry about this issue, pursuant to the standard enunciated in\r\nCastaneda.  After remand, a hearing was conducted where evidence was\r\npresented on whether African Americans had been systematically excluded\r\nfrom the Horry County grand jury.  The circuit court subsequently issued an\r\norder finding there had been no discriminatory exclusion of African\r\nAmericans.  George appeals that order. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n George argues the circuit court erred in finding that no systematic\r\ndiscrimination against African Americans existed within the Horry County\r\ngrand Jury selection process.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n George notes that his indictment was handed down by a grand jury\r\nthat included no African Americans.  Additionally, no African Americans sat\r\non Horry County's grand jury for the period 1991-93.  George's expert, Dr.\r\nAlbiniak, testified that the probability of this occurring was 1 in 5,000.\r\nFurther, George asserts that although African Americans represented 13% of\r\nHorry County's population, only 7.5% of those summoned for grand jury\r\nservice during the 1991-96 period were African Americans.  Based on this\r\nstatistical information, George argues that the circuit court erred in finding\r\nno systematic exclusion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.15\r\n\r\nSTATE v. GEORGE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In Castaneda, the United States Supreme Court outlined the following\r\ntest to be utilized when a defendant makes a grand jury discrimination claim: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n [I]n order to show that an equal protection violation has occurred\r\n in the context of grand jury selection, the defendant must show\r\n that the procedure employed resulted in substantial under-\r\n representation of his race or of the identifiable group to which he\r\n belongs.  The first step is to establish that the group is one that\r\n is a recognizable, distinct class, singled out for different\r\n treatment under the laws, as written or as applied. Next, the\r\n degree of underrepresentation must be proved, by comparing the\r\n proportion of the group in the total population to the proportion\r\n called to serve as grand jurors, over a significant period of time.\r\n . . . Finally, . . . a selection procedure that is susceptible of\r\n abuse or is not racially neutral supports the presumption of\r\n discrimination raised by the statistical showing.  Once the\r\n defendant has shown substantial underrepresentation of his\r\n group, he has made out a prima facie case of discriminatory\r\n purpose, and the burden then shifts to the State to rebut that\r\n case. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCastaneda, 430 U.S. at 494-95, 97 S. Ct. at 1280, 51 L. Ed. 2d at 510-11\r\n(citations omitted)(emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Under the Castaneda test, it is undisputed that George satisfied the\r\nfirst element of belonging to a group that is a recognizable, distinct class.\r\nThe second element of the Castaneda test is that the degree of\r\nunderrepresentation must be proved by comparing the proportion of the group\r\nin the total population to the proportion called to serve as grand jurors, over\r\na significant period of time.  Because Castaneda requires analysis of\r\nunderrepresentation over \"a significant period of time,\" we must conduct our\r\nexamination based not on the 1991-93 figures, but rather the 1991-96 figures. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At first blush the statistical data mentioned above may raise the\r\nspecter of underrepresentation; however, a closer examination reveals that\r\nGeorge's statistical figures are seriously flawed.  There are three major\r\nproblems with George's statistical argument.  First, George's statistical\r\ncomparisons are based on an incorrect base figure.  As indicated above,\r\nGeorge asserts that although African Americans represented 13% of Horry\r\nCounty's population, only 7.5% of those summoned for grand jury service\r\nduring the 1991-96 period were African Americans.  The problem with this\r\nargument is that the 13% figure is not the percentage of Horry County's \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.16\r\n\r\nSTATE v. GEORGE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrican American population that was eligible for jury duty, but rather the\r\npercentage of African Americans who were registered to vote.  The manner\r\nin which grand juries are selected in South Carolina is as follows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nEach county receives a list of individuals who reside within that\r\ncounty, who are over eighteen years of age, who hold a South\r\nCarolina driver's license or identification card, and who are\r\nUnited States citizens.  This list is merged with the county list\r\nof registered voters to establish the roll of eligible jurors for that\r\ncounty. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n George, 323 S.C. at 506, 476 S.E.2d at 909 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-130\r\n (Supp. 1995)).  In his statistical arguments George's expert witness based his\r\n calculations on a 13% figure that constituted just the voter registration pool,\r\n not the potential jury pool.1 In other words, the figure did not take into\r\n account the statutory requirement of both the voter registration list and the\r\n driver's license/identification card list.  At the hearing, the circuit court raised\r\n this question, but the question was not adequately addressed by the parties.\r\n Because the base figure was incomplete and did not conform to the statutory\r\n requirements, all of George's figures rest on a suspect foundation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n If the voter registration list information had been combined with the\r\ndriver's license/identification card list, then the figures may well have been\r\ndifferent.  Without having this additional information, it is speculative to\r\nsuggest that the percentage of jurors selected of a particular race is\r\ndisproportionate to the percentage in the total population.  George's expert\r\nwitness testified that he was not sure how the addition of the driver's\r\nlicense/identification card records would have affected the base percentage of\r\nAfrican Americans. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The second major problem with George's statistical argument is that\r\nthe data does not take into account excusals.  Even if the 13% figure is\r\npresumed to be accurate, the greatest discrepancies between the population\r\nfigures and the juror figures appeared in the jurors actually selected, not in\r\nthe persons summoned.  After the jurors were summoned, they were qualified\r\nby the court.  Jurors could be excused based on various factors.  Such \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 We note that the circuit court's order incorrectly refers to Dr. Albiniak's\r\ntestimony concerning African Americans making up more than 13% of the\r\n\"voting and driving population.\" This statement -- that the percentage was\r\nbased on voting and driving population -- is directly contradicted by the\r\nrecord, so we assume this was a scrivener's error. \r\n  \r\np.17\r\n\r\nSTATE v. GEORGE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexcusals may well have had an impact on the number of African Americans\r\njurors available for selection; however, George has not presented any evidence\r\nas to who was excused, why they were excused, and whether there \"was a\r\ndiscrepancy between excusals for African Americans and whites.  Dr. Albiniak\r\ntestified that he did not know how many of those in the jury pool were\r\nexcused for valid reasons. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The third major problem with George's statistical analysis is that it\r\nfails to take into account holdover jurors.  Dr. Albiniak's probability figures\r\nwere based on an independent selection of jurors for each year.  However,\r\nthis is not a valid assessment because the selection of jurors was not entirely\r\nindependent each year, but depended to a significant degree on the\r\ncomposition of the previous year's grand jury.  One-third of the grand jury\r\nwas composed of jurors held over from the previous year's grand jury. See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1510 (Supp. 1997).2 Thus, if the 1991 grand jury was\r\nall-white, then one-third of the seats on the 1992 jury would have definitely\r\nbeen taken up by whites.  Thus, there would have been only 12, not 18,\r\npotential seats that would have been open for African American jurors.\r\nGeorge's statistical data did not in any way take this factor into account. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Assuming arguendo that George's statistical information was valid, the\r\ndiscrepancies in this case are not comparable to those cases wherein equal\r\nprotection violations have been upheld.  For example, in Castaneda, an equal\r\nprotection violation was found by the United States Supreme Court where\r\nMexican-Americans constituted over 79% of the population of a county, but,\r\nover an 11-year period, only 39% of persons summoned for grand jury service\r\nwere Mexican-American. Castaneda, 430 U.S. 482, 97 S. Ct. 1272, 51 L. Ed.\r\n2d 498; see Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346, 90 S. Ct. 532, 24 L. Ed. 2d 567\r\n(1970)(blacks constituted 60% of the general population, but 37% on the\r\ngrand jury lists); Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545, 87 S. Ct. 643, 17 L. Ed.\r\n2d 599 (1967)(blacks listed on tax digest amounted to 27.1% of taxpayers, but \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 The statute provides: \r\n\r\n During the last term of the court of general sessions held in each\r\n county for any year six of the grand jurors then in service must.\r\n be drawn as provided in this article who, together with twelve\r\n grand jurors selected in the manner prescribed, shall constitute\r\n the grand jury for the succeeding year.

Ed. 2d 634 (1967)(blacks made up 24.4% of taxpayers, but only\r\n4.7% of those on grand jury lists).    In contrast, this case presents a\r\ncomparison between 13% and 7.5%. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Castaneda, the United States Supreme Court observed that as a\r\ngeneral rule for large samples, if the difference between the expected value\r\nand the observed value is greater than two or three standard deviations,3\r\nthen the hypothesis that the jury drawing was random would be suspect to\r\na social scientist. Castaneda, 430 U.S. 482, 97 S. Ct. 1272, 51 L. Ed. 2d 498.\r\nIn this case, George's expert testified that for each year between 1991 and\r\n1996, the standard deviation was less than three.  With the exception of\r\n1993, every year between 1991 and 1996 was statistically within tolerance\r\n(i.e. the allowable deviation). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The third element of the Castaneda test is that \"a selection procedure\r\nthat is susceptible of abuse or is not racially neutral supports the\r\npresumption of discrimination raised by the statistical showing.\" Castaneda,\r\n430 U.S. at 494, 97 S.

George argues\r\nthat the selection process is not racially neutral because although it may\r\nproduce random results in the long-run, it does not produce representative\r\njuries in the short-term.  This argument lacks persuasion because the\r\nselection process needs only be race neutral; there is not a strict legal\r\nrequirement that every single jury be uniformly representative of the\r\npopulation.  Additionally, George argues that the excusal process could be\r\nabused, but he does not offer evidence in support of this proposition. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Based on the foregoing, we conclude that George has not made a prima\r\nfacie showing under the Castaneda test.  However, even if it is assumed that\r\nGeorge has made a prima facie showing of substantial underrepresentation,\r\nthen the burden shifts to the State to rebut that case. See Castaneda, 430\r\nU.S. 482, 97 S. Ct. 1272, 51 L. Ed. 2d 498; Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S.\r\n625, 92 S. Ct. 1221, 31 L. Ed. 2d 536 (1972)(Once a prima facie case of\r\ninvidious discrimination is established, the burden of proof shifts to the State\r\nto rebut the presumption of unconstitutional action by showing that\r\npermissible racially neutral selection criteria and procedures have produced\r\nthe monochromatic result.). The State has met this burden. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHorry County follows a jury selection process based on statutory\r\n\r\n3 The standard deviation is the measure of the predicted fluctuations\r\nfrom the expected value. \r\n  \r\np.19 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. GEORGE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions, as well as on a plan submitted to, and approved by, the South\r\nCarolina Supreme Court.  The merging of the voter registration and driver's\r\nlicense/identification card information is done by the South Carolina Budget\r\nand Control Board.  This list of potential jurors is prepared for the State\r\nElection Commission, which forwards it to Horry County.  This information,\r\nin turn, is inputted into the local computer. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Horry County, three jury commissioners -- composed of the Clerk of\r\nCourt, the Auditor, and the Treasurer -- gather and input their passwords\r\ninto the computer to request a jury list.  The passwords must be entered by\r\neach commissioner, and the commissioners do not know one another's\r\npasswords.  The computer generates a random listing of potential jurors,\r\nbased on the list forwarded by the State Election Commission.  After the\r\ncomputer generates the list of potential jurors, the commissioners send\r\nnotices to these individuals to appear before the court.  In court, the Clerk\r\ncalls out the names of those on the list.  The judge then qualifies the jurors,\r\ndetermining if any excusals apply.  Once the jurors are qualified, then the\r\nClerk starts reading sequentially the names left on the list, until reaching\r\nthe desired number of grand jurors (e.g. 18). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The commissioners testified that they could not alter the computer\r\nfunctions.  Additionally, they did not remove the names of any African\r\nAmericans from the jury list.  The Clerk of Court testified that from 1991 to\r\n1996, jurors were selected randomly through the use of the computer and\r\nthat none of the commissioners removed any persons from the list of jurors\r\nor altered the computer list after it was printed.  Further, no names were\r\nadded to the list.  The circuit court found \"beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\nthe procedure utilized by the jury commissioners in Horry County in the\r\nselection of this Grand Jury follows exactly the law of this State.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Based on the evidence offered, the State has established that Horry\r\nCounty uses race neutral selection criteria and procedures.  In fact, the\r\nsystem attempts to make the selection process as neutral and random as\r\npossible.  As the circuit court orally ruled: The \"evidence and testimony in\r\nthis case is absolutely void of any inference or indication that any\r\nskullduggery was used, that any abuse was used or that it was not racially\r\nneutral.  \" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Thus, since George has not shown systematic exclusion of African\r\nAmericans from the Horry County grand jury, we conclude the circuit court's\r\norder must be affirmed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.20\r\n\r\nSTATE v.

Bibco appealed City's ruling\r\nto the circuit court.  The circuit court dismissed Bibco's appeal, finding it\r\nlacked merit.  Bibco appeals.  We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.22\r\n\r\nBIBCO CORPORATION v. CITY OF SUMTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n On March 20, 1996, Bibco filed with City an Application for Zoning\r\nReclassification.1 Bibco sought to rezone over 90 acres of its property in\r\nSumter from a Residential-9 (\"R-9\") classification to a General Residential\r\n(\"GR\") classification so that it could place double-wide mobile homes on its\r\nland.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Bibco's application was initially reviewed by the Sumter Planning\r\nCommission Staff.  The Staff recommended that Bibco's application be denied.\r\nA public hearing was held before the Sumter City-County Planning\r\nCommission on April 24, 1996.  The Commission concluded that Bibco's\r\napplication should be denied, stating that GR zoning would be incompatible\r\nwith the R-15 zoning which surrounds three sides of Bibco's property.  The\r\nCommission forwarded its recommendation to City Council. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n A final public hearing was held before the Sumter City Council on May\r\n21, 1996.  Based on its local zoning ordinance, City Council unanimously\r\nvoted to deny Bibco's application.  Bibco appealed to the circuit court,\r\nchallenging the denial of its application on two grounds: (1) the local zoning\r\nordinance was preempted by federal law, and (2) application of the ordinance\r\nto mobile homes violated equal protection.3 The circuit court disagreed,\r\ndismissing Bibco's appeal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Prior to August 1995, Bibco's property was zoned as Residential-15.\r\nOn August 1, 1995, City approved Bibco's request to reclassify its property\r\nas Residential-9. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 2 Under the Sumter zoning ordinance, residential districts are classified\r\nas either Residential-15, Residential-9, Residential-6, In-Town Residential\r\nDistrict, Residential Multi-Family District, or General Residential.  Mobile\r\nhomes are only permitted in districts zoned as General Residential. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n 3 We note that this appeal originally arose from City's denial of Bibco's\r\napplication to rezone its property from R-9 to GR.  However, Bibco's\r\narguments before the circuit court related to the constitutional validity of R-9\r\nzoning, not whether City properly denied Bibco's rezoning application.\r\nThough styled as an appeal in the circuit court, this case really involves a\r\ndirect attack on City's exclusion of mobile homes via its R-9 classification\r\nrather than a review of the Sumter City Council's decision on May 21, 1996,\r\nto deny Bibco's request to rezone its property. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.23 \r\n  \r\n\r\nBIBCO CORPORATION v. CITY OF SUMTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBibco appeals to this Court raising the following issues: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA.    Did the circuit court err in ruling that the Sumter zoning\r\n ordinance was not preempted by the National Manufactured\r\n Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nB.    Did the circuit court err in ruling that the Sumter zoning\r\n ordinance did not deprive Bibco of its right to equal protection of\r\n the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\r\n States Constitution? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA.    FEDERAL PREEMPTION \r\n  \r\n Bibco argues that the restriction in City's zoning ordinance excluding\r\nmobile homes from R-9 districts is preempted by the National Manufactured\r\nHousing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, codified at 42 U.S.C.\r\nÂ§ 5401 et seq (\"Federal Act\").  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Federal Act was enacted by Congress \"to reduce the number of\r\npersonal injuries and deaths and the amount of insurance costs and property\r\ndamage resulting from manufactured home accidents and to improve the\r\nquality and durability of manufactured homes.\" 42 U.S.C. Â§ 5401.  Congress\r\nhas expressly defined the preemptive reach of the Federal Act: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhenever a Federal manufactured home construction and safety\r\nstandard established under this chapter is in effect, no State or\r\npolitical subdivision of a State shall have any authority either to\r\nestablish, or to continue in effect, with respect to any\r\nmanufactured home covered, any standard regarding construction\r\nor safety applicable to the same aspect of performance of such\r\nmanufactured home which is not identical to the Federal\r\nmanufactured home construction and safety standard. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n42 U.S.C. Â§ 5403(d).  The Federal Act's preemptive reach has been further\r\nexplicated in regulations promulgated by the United States Department of\r\nHousing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"): \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNo State or locality may establish or enforce any rule or\r\nregulation or take any action that stands as an obstacle to the\r\naccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.24\r\n\r\nBIBCO CORPORATION v. CITY OF SUMTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof Congress. The test of whether a State rule or action is\r\nvalid or must give way is whether the State rule can be\r\nenforced or the action taken without impairing the Federal\r\nsuperintendence of the manufactured home industry as\r\nestablished by the Act. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n24 C.F.R. Â§ 3282.11 (d) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The interaction between local zoning ordinances and the Federal Act\r\nwas addressed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Scurlock v. City\r\nof Lynn Haven, Fla., 858 F.2d 1521 (11th Cir. 1988).  The Scurlocks\r\nattempted to place their mobile home on residentially zoned property in the\r\ncity of Lynn Haven, Florida.  Their mobile home was covered by the Federal\r\nAct and met the minimum standards imposed by it.  However, in order to get\r\ninto the zoned area, their mobile home also had to comply with other local\r\nconstruction and safety standards.  The Eleventh Circuit found the local\r\nzoning ordinance was preempted because it ultimately imposed greater safety\r\nrequirements than the Federal Act.  The court noted, however, that it would\r\nbe permissible to restrict a zoned area to conventionally-built residences,\r\nwhile excluding mobile homes altogether. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Texas Manufactured Housing v. City of Nederland, 101 F.3d 1095\r\n(5th Cir. 1996), the Fifth Circuit addressed an ordinance which regulated the\r\nplacement of \"trailer coaches\" within the city limits.  Under the ordinance,\r\na home covered by the Federal Act (\"HUD-code manufactured home\") was\r\nconsidered a trailer coach and, therefore, was excluded from the zoned area.\r\nIn finding no federal preemption, the court observed that plaintiffs had failed\r\nto present any evidence that the placement of a HUD-code manufactured\r\nhome in a residential zone was conditioned upon compliance with any local\r\nor State construction or safety standard. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In this case, City, through its zoning ordinance, excludes mobile homes\r\nfrom R-9 districts.  However, structures defined as \"modular homes\" are\r\npermitted into such districts if they comply with the South Carolina Modular\r\nBuildings Construction Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-43-10 et seq.  Bibco argues\r\nthat the only difference in the definition of a mobile home and a modular\r\nhome under City's ordinance is the method of construction of the mobile\r\nhome.    This, Bibco argues, is an attempt to dictate State construction\r\nstandards for HUD-code manufactured homes. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Bibco's argument must fail for the simple reason that City's ordinance\r\ndoes not impose any construction or safety standard on mobile homes.  The \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.25\r\n\r\nBIBCO CORPORATION v. CITY OF SUMTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nordinance simply distinguishes between structures built on a permanent\r\nchassis and those that are not and excludes the former from R-9 residential\r\ndistricts.  Bibco's attempt to characterize this distinction as a construction\r\nstandard is unavailing, \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCity's ordinance defines \"mobile home\" in the following manner: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA mobile home is a transportable structure of one or more\r\nsections built on a permanent metal chassis and designed to be\r\ntowed.  The term \"mobile home\" as used in this Ordinance shall\r\nnot include prefabricated, modular, or unitized dwellings placed\r\non permanent foundations, nor shall it include travel trailers,\r\nmotor homes, campers, or similar units designed for recreation or\r\nother short term uses. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(emphasis added).  Sumter's definition of mobile home tracks the Federal\r\nAct's definition of manufactured home, which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\"'manufactured home' means a structure, transportable in one or more\r\nsections ... and which is built on a permanent chassis. . . .\" 42 U.S.C. Â§\r\n5402(6).4 Thus, a HUD-code manufactured home would be considered a\r\n\"mobile home\" under City's ordinance. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n As for a \"modular home,\" City's ordinance supplies the following\r\ndefinition: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA building including the necessary electrical, plumbing, heating,\r\nventilating, and other service systems, manufactured off-site and\r\n\r\n4 The federal definition of manufactured home provides in full: \r\n\r\n \"manufactured home\" means a structure, transportable in one or\r\n more sections, which, in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or\r\n more in width or forty body feet or more in length, or, when\r\n erected on site, is three hundred twenty or more square feet, and\r\n which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used\r\n as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when\r\n connected to the required utilities, and including the plumbing,\r\n heating, air-conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein;\r\n except that such term shall include any structure which meets all\r\n the requirements and with respect to which the manufacturer\r\n voluntarily files a certification required by the Secretary and\r\n complies with the standards established under this chapter. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.26\r\n\r\nBIBCO CORPORATION v. CITY OF SUMTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransported to the point of use for installation or erection, with\r\nor without other specified components, as a finished building and\r\nnot designed for ready removal to another site.  This term is\r\nnot to be limited to residential dwellings.  When meeting the\r\nrequirements of the Modular Building's [sic] Construction Act (23-\r\n43-10 of the South Carolina Code of Laws), said building or\r\nstructure may be located in any of the county's several zoning\r\ndistricts. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis is in contrast to a mobile home which, under City's ordinance, is a\r\nstructure built on a permanent chassis and, therefore, designed for ready\r\nremoval.  The effect of the ordinance is to exclude from R-9 districts all\r\nmobile homes built on a permanent chassis, i.e., HUD-code manufactured\r\nhomes.  In other words, Bibco's mobile homes are excluded from R-9 districts\r\nnot because they fail to comply with some State construction or safety\r\nstandard but because they are built on a permanent chassis and designed to\r\nbe towed.  This exclusion is permissible under Scurlock. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We conclude that City's differentiation between mobile homes and\r\nmodular homes does not impair the federal superintendence of the\r\nmanufactured home industry.  Thus, there is no federal preemption. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII. EQUAL PROTECTION \r\n  \r\n Bibco argues that Sumter's ordinance, as applied in this case, violates\r\nthe Federal Equal Protection Clause in that there is no rational basis to\r\nallow modular homes into the zoned area, while at the same time excluding\r\nmobile homes.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n A municipal ordinance is a legislative enactment and is presumed to be\r\nconstitutional. Town of Scranton v. Willoughby, 306 S.C. 421, 412 S.E.2d 424\r\n(1991).  The burden of proving the invalidity of a zoning ordinance is on the\r\nparty attacking it, and it is incumbent on the attacking party to show the\r\narbitrary and capricious character of the ordinance through clear and\r\nconvincing evidence. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Equal Protection Clause proclaims, \"No State shall  ... deny to any\r\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const.\r\namend.  XIV, Â§ 1. If there is no suspect or quasi-suspect class and no\r\nfundamental right is involved, zoning ordinances should be tested under the\r\n\"rational basis\" standard. Haves v. City of Miami, 52 F.3d 918 (11th Cir.\r\n1995).  There are three steps in determining whether an ordinance survives \r\n  \r\np.27\r\n\r\nBIBCO CORPORATION v. CITY OF SUMTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrational basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause: (1) whether\r\nplaintiff was treated differently than others similarly situated; (2) whether\r\ndefendant intentionally discriminated against plaintiff and had a rational\r\nbasis for doing so; and (3) whether the discrimination/classification bears a\r\nrational relationship to a legitimate government purpose or goal. Baggs v.\r\nCity of South Pasadena, 947 F. Supp. 1580 (M.D. Fla. 1996); accord Peoples\r\nProgram for Endangered Species v. Sexton, 323 S.C. 526, 476 S.E.2d 477\r\n(1996). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In determining whether there is a legitimate government purpose, the\r\nactual motivations of the enacting governmental body are entirely irrelevant.\r\nA reviewing court need only decide what goals the government body could\r\nhave been pursuing. Haves v. City of Miami, 52 F.3d 918 (citing F.C.C. v.\r\nBeach Communications, 508 U.S. 307, 113 S. Ct. 2096, 124 L. Ed.2d 211\r\n(1993)). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In addition to the purpose stated in the ordinance -- preserving land for\r\nlow density, single-family dwellings -- City offers the following justifications\r\nfor excluding mobile homes from certain residential districts in Sumter:\r\nprotection of surrounding property values, guarding against increased crime,\r\nguarding against increased traffic flow and congestion, and maintaining\r\naesthetics.  Other courts have sustained the exclusion of mobile homes from\r\nresidential districts based on these and other concerns. See Texas\r\nManufactured Housing Assn, 101 F.3d 1095 (affirming the grant of summary\r\njudgment where it was \"at least debatable\" that zoning protected surrounding\r\nproperty values); Clark v. Winnebago Co., 817 F.2d 407 (7th Cir.\r\n1987)(regulating population density); Colby v. Hurtt, 509 P.2d 1142 (Kan.\r\n1973)(concern that mobile homes might stunt growth of city); Duggins v.\r\nTown of Walnut Cove, 306 S.E.2d 186 (N.C. Ct.  App. 1-983)(Protection of value\r\nof surrounding homes); Brookside Village v. Comeau, 633 S.W.2d 790 (Tex.\r\n1982)(concerns about potential waste and sewage problems). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In the instant case, Bibco relies upon Cannon v. Coweta County, 389\r\nS.E.2d 329 (Ga. 1990) in arguing Sumter's ordinance violates equal\r\nprotection.    In Cannon, an ordinance excluded mobile homes from all\r\nresidential zones except manufactured-home parks.  The Georgia Supreme\r\nCourt concluded that the ordinance violated substantive due process because\r\nit was arbitrary and unreasonable.  The court found the party challenging the\r\nordinance satisfied its burden of proof based on evidence that there was a\r\npublic need for manufactured housing in residential districts; that the modern\r\nmanufactured home is as safe and attractive as site-built housing; that\r\nmanufactured homes do not devalue nearby site-built homes; and that \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.28\r\n\r\nBIBCO CORPORATION v. CITY OF SUMTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanufactured homes should not, if valued properly, adversely affect the\r\ncounty's tax base. Cannon, 389 S.E.2d at 331. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We find that Bibco has not shown through clear and convincing\r\nevidence that City's ordinance is arbitrary and capricious as applied to mobile\r\nhomes.  In this case, unlike Cannon, mobile homes are not excluded from all\r\nresidential districts.  They are merely limited to General Residential districts.\r\nMoreover, in Town of Scranton, 306 S.C. 421, 412 S.E.2d 424, we upheld a\r\nmunicipal ordinance even more restrictive than the one challenged in this\r\ncase.

Howard, Sr., Judge \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Opinion No. 24826\r\nHeard October 22, 1997 - Filed July 27, 1998 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nChief Attorney Daniel T. Stacey, and Deputy Chief\r\nAttorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, both of South Carolina\r\nOffice of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for\r\nappellant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Deputy\r\nAttorney General John W. McIntosh, and Assistant\r\nDeputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, of\r\nColumbia; and Solicitor David P. Schwacke, of North\r\nCharleston, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FINNEY, C.J.: Appellant James Earl Reed, was convicted of\r\nmurdering his former girlfriend's parents.  Appellant was sentenced to death.\r\nThis appeal consolidates appellant's direct appeal with the mandatory review\r\nprovisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (1985).  We affirm.\r\n FACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA public defender and a private attorney were appointed to \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.30\r\n\r\nSTATE v. REED \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresent appellant.  A hearing was held to determine whether appellant was\r\ncompetent to stand trial.  Judge Howard concluded after the hearing that\r\nappellant was competent to stand trial.  Subsequently, appellant requested\r\nto represent himself.  After a hearing, the trial judge found appellant's\r\nrequest for self-representation was freely and voluntarily made.  The private\r\nattorney was relieved of representation and the public defender was\r\nappointed to serve as standby counsel.  Appellant represented himself during\r\nthe guilt phase and waived his right to testify.  The jury found him guilty of\r\nboth murders. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Before the penalty phase began, appellant sought to change his\r\nrelationship with standby counsel such that appellant would give the opening\r\nstatement and counsel would continue.  Appellant claimed he would be too\r\nemotional to cross-examine the victims' family.  The trial judge refused to\r\nappoint counsel because it was too late in the proceeding and counsel would\r\nbe unable to adequately prepare on short notice.  The judge concluded that\r\nappellant was not entitled to either the appointment of counsel or to have\r\nstandby counsel cross-examine the victim-impact witnesses.  Standby counsel\r\nobjected on the basis that appellant was not competent to represent himself\r\nat sentencing and asked to be appointed.  The trial judge declined to appoint\r\nany counsel for appellant at sentencing since appellant had waived his right\r\nto counsel.  At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury recommended\r\nand the judge sentenced appellant to death for both murders. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n ISSUES \r\n  \r\nI.  Was it error to find appellant competent to stand trial\r\n and waive his right to counsel? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII. Was it error to allow appellant's statement into evidence? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIII.  Was it error to refuse to appoint counsel to represent\r\n appellant at sentencing? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIV. Was it error to fail to obtain a waiver of appellant's right\r\n to testify at the sentencing phase? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n I. Appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding him\r\ncompetent to stand trial and waive his right to counsel.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.31\r\n\r\nSTATE v. REED \r\n\r\n The test for determining whether a criminal defendant is\r\ncompetent to stand trial is \"whether he has sufficient present ability to\r\nconsult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\r\nand whether he has a rational as well as a factual understanding of the\r\nproceedings against him.\" Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct.\r\n788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960).  The defendant bears the burden of proving his\r\nincompetence by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Nance, 320 S.C.\r\n501, 466 S.E.2d 349, cert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 2566 (1996).  The test is not\r\nwhether the defendant is actually cooperating with his lawyer, but rather if\r\nhe has the mental capacity to do so. State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 360 S.E.2d\r\n706 (1987), cert. denied,   484 U.S. 1020 (1988).   The trial court's\r\ndetermination of competency will be upheld if it has evidentiary support and\r\nis not against the preponderance of the evidence. State v. Nance, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Dr. Behrmann examined appellant during his two month\r\nhospitalization at Hall Institute.  Dr. Behrmann concluded that within a\r\nreasonable degree of medical certainty, appellant was competent to stand trial\r\nand had the ability to understand the nature of criminal proceedings.  In Dr.\r\nBehrmann's opinion, appellant had the ability to understand the charges\r\nagainst him and to assist his counsel.  Dr. Behrmann did not find appellant\r\nto be suffering from paranoia but concluded his failure to cooperate with\r\nappointed counsel was voluntary.  Dr. Behrmann subsequently examined\r\nappellant for about forty-five minutes several months prior to trial.  In Dr.\r\nBehrmann's opinion, appellant continued to be competent to stand trial.  He\r\nconcluded that appellant had a factual knowledge of the charges against him,\r\nthe potential penalty he faced and his options in pleading.  Dr. Behnnann did\r\nnot find a mental illness or that appellant's decisions arose out of a\r\ndelusional process.  During appellant's hospitalization, staff observed that he\r\nwas able to interact with staff and other patients normally and did not\r\ndemonstrate a guarded, distrustful, suspicious kind of behavior normally\r\nexpected from a person with a paranoid process. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The trial judge concluded that appellant had the factual\r\nunderstanding of the charges against him and a rational understanding of the\r\nproceedings and how the court works, and the roles of the various\r\nparticipants.  The judge was convinced by the medical reports and testimony\r\nthat appellant does not have a pervasive paranoia or paranoid behavior that\r\naffects his ability to interact and to cooperate.  The judge found appellant\r\nhad the present ability to rationally understand the proceedings and the\r\nability to consult with his attorneys with a reasonable degree of rational\r\nunderstanding.  His findings and conclusions were based on the forensic unit \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.32\r\n\r\nSTATE v. REED \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstaffing report and the testimony of Dr. Behrmann and associates.  The\r\njudge also found persuasive the staffing entries which showed appellant's\r\nability to cooperate.  In view of the evidentiary support in the record, we\r\nuphold the trial court's determination of competency. State v. Nance, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n After the court found appellant competent to stand trial, appellant\r\nmoved to waive representation by appointed counsel and sought to represent\r\nhimself The trial judge questioned appellant in camera about his knowledge\r\nof the proceedings and what it would mean to represent himself rather than\r\nhave representation by two capital trial qualified attorneys.  The trial judge\r\nwarned appellant of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.\r\nAppellant stated that he understood what he was waiving but still chose to\r\nwaive counsel. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n It is well-established that an accused may waive the right to\r\n counsel and proceed pro se. Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct.\r\n 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975).  Although a defendant's decision to proceed pro\r\n se may be to the defendant's own detriment, it \"must be honored out of that\r\n respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\" Id. 422 U.S. at\r\n 834.  The right to proceed pro se must be clearly asserted by the defendant\r\n prior to trial. State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991), cert.\r\n denied, 502 U.S. 1103 (1992).  The trial judge has the responsibility to ensure\r\n that the accused is informed of the dangers and disadvantages of self-\r\n representation, and makes a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to\r\n counsel. Faretta, supra.  The ultimate test of whether a defendant has made\r\n a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel is the defendant's\r\n understanding. Graves v. State, 309 S.C. 307, 422 S.E.2d 125 (1992).  The\r\n only relevant inquiry is whether the defendant has made a knowing and\r\n intelligent waiver of the right to counsel. Faretta, supra.  There is no\r\n prohibition against a capital defendant knowingly and intelligently waiving\r\n the right to counsel. State v. Brewer, 328 S.C. 117, 492 S.E.2d 97 (1997).\r\n A decision can be made intelligently, with an understanding of the\r\n consequences, without the decision itself being a wise one. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The trial judge held several hearings to determine whether\r\nappellant understood what it meant to represent himself and to waive the\r\nappointment of experienced counsel.  The judge informed appellant of the\r\ndangers and disadvantages of self-representation.  Appellant continued to\r\nassert that he understood what he was waiving and demonstrated to the\r\njudge that he was making a knowing, intelligent perhaps unwise, voluntary\r\ndecision to represent himself.  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.33\r\n\r\nSTATE v. REED \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccepting appellant's waiver of his right to counsel. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n II. Appellant contends the trial court erred in allowing his\r\nstatement into evidence where his invocation of the right to remain silent\r\nwas not honored.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n An exculpatory or inculpatory statement obtained as a result of\r\ncustodial interrogation is inadmissible unless the person was advised of and\r\nvoluntarily waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona.1 If a defendant was\r\nadvised of his Miranda rights, but nevertheless chose to make a statement,\r\nthe \"burden is on the State to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\r\nhis rights were voluntarily waived.\" State v. Kennedy, 325 S.C. 295, 479\r\nS.E.2d 838 (1996).  Law Enforcement officers are not required to terminate\r\nan interrogation unless there is an unambiguous invocation of the right to\r\nremain silent. Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129\r\nL.Ed.2d 362 (1994). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The State asserts that appellant did not indicate a clear,\r\nconsistent and unequivocal expression of a desire to remain silent and\r\nterminate questioning.  Detectives Coaxum and Hale testified that they read\r\nappellant his Miranda rights and obtained appellant's signature on the\r\nadvisement of rights form.  Appellant initially failed to respond to questions.\r\nThe detectives talked with appellant for about 20 to 30 minutes.  Detective\r\nCoaxum continued talking to appellant after Detective Hale left the room.\r\nDuring that time appellant indicated involvement in the murders.  Detective\r\nHale returned to the room and appellant continued discussing facts\r\nconcerning the murder and did not invoke his right to silence.  Appellant\r\nagreed to cooperate with the officers in finding the murder weapon.   After\r\nreturning to the sheriffs office, a written statement was made by Detective\r\nHale based on appellant's verbal statement.  The statement was read to\r\nappellant and signed by him.  The officers testified that appellant did not ask\r\nfor an attorney.  Detective Hale stated that the only time the subject of an\r\nattorney came up was when appellant made a \"vague statement\" to the effect\r\nthat he wondered who would be his attorney. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The trial judge concluded the State had shown by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence that the statement was knowingly,\r\nintelligently, and voluntarily given after waiver of his rights and appellant \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np.34\r\n\r\nSTATE v. REED \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas accorded all of the procedural safeguards required under Miranda v.\r\nArizona.  The trial judge's determination of the voluntariness will not be\r\ndisturbed unless so manifestly erroneous as to show an abuse of discretion\r\namounting to an error of law. State v. Kennedy, supra.  The trial court did\r\nnot err in denying the motion to suppress as the State met its burden of\r\nshowing that appellant's statement was voluntarily and freely given. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n III.  Appellant asserts the trial court erred in refusing to appoint\r\nstandby counsel to represent him at sentencing.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n At the conclusion of the guilt phase, appellant asked to have\r\nstandby counsel takeover and cross-examine the state's witnesses after\r\nappellant made the opening argument.  The trial judge interpreted the\r\nrequest as asking the court to appoint counsel to undertake representation\r\nof appellant.  Standby counsel stated that while he would do his best to\r\nprepare to cross-examine witnesses, he was not prepared to represent\r\nappellant during the sentencing phase.  Standby counsel stated he had not\r\ninvestigated the case in reference to victim impact evidence or mitigation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The court concluded that it would be a hybrid form of\r\nrepresentation placing standby counsel in the position of not being fully\r\nprepared to cross-examine witnesses without delaying the trial.  The court\r\nfound it would delay the proceeding because counsel would need time to\r\nprepare and the continued sequestration of the jurors would not be possible.\r\nThe court declined to appoint counsel but allowed counsel to sit beside\r\nappellant as standby counsel and aid appellant to the extent he desired. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n A trial judge is not required to permit hybrid representation, i.e.\r\nrepresentation partially pro se and partially by counsel. McKaskle v.\r\nWiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984); State v.\r\nSanders, 269 S.C. 215, 237 S.E.2d 53 (1977).  A criminal defendant may\r\ninitially assert his right to self-representation for reasons that later prove\r\nunsound. Menefield v. Borg, 881 F.2d 696 (9th Cir. 1989).  While the right\r\nto counsel once waived is no longer absolute, there is a strong presumption\r\nthat a defendant's post-trial request for the assistance of counsel should not\r\nbe refused.  Id.  The court in Menefield. found that appellant was entitled to\r\ncounsel after waiving his right prior to sentencing.  The court noted however,\r\nthere are times when the criminal justice system would be poorly served by\r\nallowing the defendant to reverse his waiver at the last minute particularly\r\nwhere delay would result.  Further, the court noted the distinction between\r\ndelay on the eve of trial and delay at the time of a post-trial hearing. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.35\r\n\r\nSTATE v. REED \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMenefield, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In United States v. Holmen, 586 F.2d 322 (4th Cir. 1978) the\r\ncourt found it was error not to allow appellant to withdraw his waiver of\r\ncounsel and have counsel appointed at the sentencing stage.  However, in\r\nHolmen, the sentencing stage was a separate proceeding unlike the continued\r\nproceeding in the instant case involving a sequestered jury.  The trial court\r\nhere was faced with allowing standby counsel to step in and cross-examine\r\nthe witnesses on less than twenty-four hours preparation.  Judge Howard\r\nwas concerned with appellant being entitled to effective assistance of counsel.\r\nMcMann v. Richardson., 397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763\r\n(1970)(the right to counsel includes the right to effective assistance of\r\ncounsel).  The trial judge did not err in denying appellant's request to have\r\nstandby counsel represent him on the eve of sentencing. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n IV. Appellant contends the trial court erred in failing to obtain\r\na waiver of his right to testify at the sentencing phase.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n During the guilt phase, the trial judge informed appellant at\r\nlength of his right to testify and obtained a waiver on the record of his\r\nintention not to testify during that phase.  The judge did not obtain a specific\r\nwaiver of the right to testify during the penalty phase.  However, appellant\r\nindicated that he did not intend to testify during the sentencing phase.  A\r\ncapital defendant has the right to testify at the sentencing phase. State v.\r\nRay, 310 S.C. 431, 427 S.E.2d 171 (1993).  The waiver of a constitutional or\r\nstatutory right requires a showing on the record that the defendant made the\r\nwaiver knowingly and intelligently. Id. 427 at 174.  The references in the\r\nrecord demonstrate that appellant clearly waived his right to testify. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n Appellant's convictions and sentences are affirmed.  We have\r\nconducted the proportionality review pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25\r\n(1985).  The evidence indicates the sentences were not the result of passion,\r\nprejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, the evidence supports the finding of\r\nthe aggravating circumstance; and the sentences are not disproportionate to\r\nthat imposed in similar cases. State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d\r\n626 (1996). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ. , concur.\r\np.36\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24827","title":"State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v.

Pursuant to the Findings of Fact of the District Court, does\r\n Randy Aytes' classification as a non-permissive user of the\r\n Dawson vehicle invoke the Uninsured Motorist Coverage of\r\n Donna Dawson's State Farm Mutual Auto policy so as to allow\r\n Ms. Dawson to sue Aytes as an uninsured motorist? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2.    Did Donna Dawson's injuries result from the ownership,\r\n maintenance, or use of her vehicle? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3.    Can the shooting be characterized as accidental? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTS \r\n  \r\n On July 22, 1994, Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff, Donna\r\nDawson (Dawson) owned a vehicle insured by a policy issued by State\r\nFarm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. Prior to this time, Ms. Dawson\r\nhad forbidden defendant Randy Aytes (Aytes) to drive her car.  Dawson\r\nand Aytes were together at the home of his mother, Blanche Aytes.\r\nRandy Aytes and Dawson became involved in an altercation.  Aytes\r\nforcibly took Dawson's car key and forced her into her car.  Although\r\nAytes was forbidden to drive Dawson's car, he drove her to an area of\r\nBlanche Aytes' property with the expressed intent of killing Dawson.\r\nWhile standing outside of the car on the passenger side, Aytes fired a\r\npistol towards Dawson striking her in the foot. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Blanche Aytes' homeowner's insurer State Farm Fire &amp;\r\nCasualty Co. instituted a declaratory judgment action against Randy Aytes\r\nand Dawson to determine the coverage available under the homeowner's\r\npolicy.  Dawson brought a third-party action against State Farm Mutual\r\nAutomobile Insurance Co. to bring into the case the question of coverage\r\nunder her automobile policy.  The parties stipulated that there was no\r\ncoverage under the homeowner's policy.  The sole question remaining\r\nbefore the federal court on cross-motions for summary judgment concerns \r\n  \r\np.38\r\n\r\nSTATE FARM FIRE &amp; CASUALTY CO.  V. AYTES \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe coverage in effect on July 22, 1994, under the State Farm Mutual\r\nAutomobile policy insuring Dawson's vehicle. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n An insured is legally entitled to recover damages arising out of\r\nthe \"ownership, maintenance, or use\" of an uninsured vehicle.  S. C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 38-77-140 (1989).  The two-pronged test for determining when an\r\ninjury arises out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of an uninsured\r\nvehicle is set out in Wausau Underwriters Ins.  Co. v. Howser, 309 S.C.\r\n269, 422 S.E.2d 106 (1992).  First, the party seeking coverage must\r\nestablish a causal connection between the vehicle and the injury.  Second,\r\nthere must exist no act of independent significance breaking the causal\r\nlink.  A third requirement was added in Canal Ins.  Co. v. Insurance Co. of\r\nNorth America, 315 S.C. 1, 431 S.E.2d 577 (1993): it must be shown the\r\nvehicle was being used for transportation at the time of the assault. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The causal connection is established where it can be shown the\r\nvehicle was an \"active accessory\" to the assault. Howser,  supra. The\r\ncausation required is something less than proximate cause and something\r\nmore than the vehicle being the mere site of the injury. Id. The injury\r\nmust be foreseeably identifiable with the normal use of the vehicle.\r\nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brown, 779 F.2d 984 (4th Cir. 1985). The\r\nrequired causal connection does not exist when the only connection\r\nbetween an injury and the insured vehicle's use is the fact that the\r\ninjured person was an occupant of the vehicle when the shooting occurred.\r\nId. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In this case, the vehicle was used to transport Dawson to\r\nanother location.  The assailant driver got out of the car and went around\r\nto the passenger side where Dawson was sitting.  Dawson retrieved a gun\r\nfrom the glove compartment in an effort to defend herself from Aytes.\r\nHowever, Aytes gained control of the gun and while he was standing\r\noutside of the car, he fired the gun striking Dawson in the foot.  State\r\nFarm contends the stationery car was merely the site of the injury and\r\nnot an \"active accessory\" to the assault.  Dawson contends her car acted as\r\nmore than the mere site of the injury. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Wausau Underwriters v. Howser, the insured sustained\r\ngunshot wounds while traveling on a public highway in an insured vehicle\r\nand during a vehicular chase by an unknown assailant in an unidentified\r\nvehicle.  The Court found the unknown vehicle was an active accessory to\r\nthis assault:  it was not a case in which the assailant merely used the \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.39 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE FARM FIRE &amp; CASUALTY CO.  V. AYTES \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicle to provide transportation to the situs of the shooting.  The Court\r\nstated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOnly through use of his vehicle was the assailant\r\nable to closely pursue Howser, thereby enabling\r\nhim to carry out the pistol assault.  The gunshot\r\nwas the culmination of an ongoing assault, in\r\nwhich the vehicle played an essential and integral\r\npart.  Additionally, only a motor vehicle could have\r\nprovided the assailant a quick and successful\r\nescape.  Thus, we find a sufficient causal\r\nconnection exists between the use of the assailant's\r\nvehicle and Howser's injuries. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWausau Underwriters, supra. Coverage was not found in Nationwide Mut.\r\nIns.  Co. v. Brown, supra, where fatal shooting occurred when husband, a\r\npassenger in a truck, caused the truck driver to collide with his wife's\r\nvehicle and husband jumped out of truck and shot his wife in her vehicle.\r\nThe court concluded that the use of the truck for transportation to the\r\nscene of the shooting was merely incidental, remote from the type of\r\nconduct that is reasonably foreseeable with the normal use of a vehicle\r\nand not the causative factor in producing wife's death.  Instead, the\r\nassault in Brown was viewed by the court as an act wholly independent of\r\nthe use of the truck and the cause of the death.  The incidental use of the\r\ntruck in the shooting was not found to meet the causal relation test of\r\ncoverage. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Home Ins.  Co. v. Towe, 314 S.C. 105, 441 S.E.2d 825 (1994),\r\ninjuries were sustained by a victim when he was struck by a bottle thrown\r\nby a passenger in a passing car.  The Court stated that \"the use of the\r\nautomobile placed [assailant] in the position to throw the bottle at the sign\r\nand the vehicle's speed contributed to the velocity of the bottle increasing\r\nthe seriousness of [victim's] injuries.  As in Wausau, the automobile was\r\nan active accessory that gave rise to the injuries.\" The court in Home Ins.\r\nCo. found that a causal connection existed between the use of Towe's\r\nautomobile and the victim's injuries.  The court stated further \"[t]he use of\r\nthe automobile and [assailant's] throwing of the bottle were . . .\r\n'inextricably linked' as one continuing act.  Accordingly, there was no act\r\nof independent significance that broke the causal connection between the\r\nuse of the automobile and [victim's] injuries.\" Home Ins.  Co., 314 S.C. at\r\n108, 441 S.E.2d at 827. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.40\r\n\r\nSTATE FARM FIRE &amp; CASUALTY CO.  V. AYTES \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n There was not a causal connection in this case as the vehicle\r\nwas not an active accessory, nor was it being used for transportation at\r\nthe time of the injury.  Further, if there was a causal link, it was broken\r\nwhen the assailant exited the vehicle.  The only connection between the\r\ncar and the injury is the fact that Dawson was sitting in the car when she\r\nwas shot.  Therefore, we do not find Dawson's injuries resulted from the\r\nownership, maintenance, or use of her vehicle. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We do not answer questions one and three since our answer to\r\nquestion two is dispositive under these facts and precludes Dawson from\r\nrecovering damages arising out of the \"ownership, maintenance, or use\" of\r\nan uninsured vehicle regardless of the answers to questions one and three. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTOAL, MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.41 \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
