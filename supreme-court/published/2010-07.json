McGrier, 378 S.C. 320, 663 S.E.2d 15 (2008).Â \r\n  Therein, the Court revisited its decision in State v. Mills, 360 S.C.\r\n  621, 602 S.E.2d 750 (2004), Â and re-examined a circuit court's ability to\r\n  revoke a defendant's probation and sentence the defendant to further imprisonment\r\n  over and above the total amount of incarceration time of the original\r\n  sentence.Â  The Court in McGrier, re-interpreting section 24-21-560(D) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2007), found &quot;the total amount of time an inmate\r\n  [can] be incarcerated after a CSP revocation [is] the length of the remaining\r\n  balance of the sentence for the 'no parole offense.'&quot;Â  378 S.C. at 332,\r\n  663 S.E.2d at 21.Â  While this clearly established the outside limit of\r\n  incarceration as the aggregate original sentence, including any suspended\r\n  portion, subsequent language in the opinion arguably limited the possible\r\n  incarceration to only the unsuspended portion of the original sentence.\r\nThe Department erroneously read McGrier to hold that the\r\n  circuit court could not impose an additional sentence for CSP revocation that\r\n  would result in the defendant being incarcerated for an aggregate period of\r\n  time extending beyond the unsuspended portion of the original sentence.Â  Based\r\n  on this interpretation, the Department re-calculated the possible CSP revocation\r\n  time for each offender still under its jurisdiction, including Picklesimer.Â \r\n  Because his previous CSP revocation imprisonment of one year exceeded the\r\n  remaining nine months of the unsuspended portion of his sentence, the\r\n  Department determined Picklesimer could no longer face incarceration for\r\n  subsequent revocations, and on June 28, 2008, the State closed Picklesimer's\r\n  CSP, ostensibly in compliance with McGrier.Â  On the same day, the State\r\n  activated the five-year probation term stemming from the suspended portion of\r\n  Picklesimer's original sentence.\r\nOne\r\n  month later, the Department issued an arrest warrant charging Picklesimer with\r\n  violating the terms of the five-year probation.Â  In September of 2008, the\r\n  Department issued a citation against Picklesimer further charging him with\r\n  violations of the probation.Â  A probation violation hearing was scheduled in\r\n  October of 2008, and Picklesimer's counsel, relying on State v. Dawkins,\r\n  352 S.C. 162, 573 S.E.2d 783 (2002), argued that the pending charges against\r\n  Respondent should be dropped because he should no longer be on probation.Â  The\r\n  circuit court continued the violation hearing and accepted memoranda from the\r\n  parties on the subject.\r\nFollowing\r\n  a hearing, the circuit court issued an order finding in favor of Picklesimer,\r\n  and discharged his remaining sentence and probation.Â  The State filed a motion\r\n  to reconsider, and thereafter the circuit court issued an order denying the\r\n  motion and supplementing its original order.Â  The State appealed the circuit court's determination to the\r\n  court of appeals, and this Court, upon request, certified the case from the\r\n  court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in finding Picklesimer must be treated as having successfully completed\r\n  CSP, due to the fact that his inability to finish the program was solely a\r\n  result of his own actions in violating the terms and conditions of CSP?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;II.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in failing to distinguish \r\n\t\t\tbetween successful completion of CSP and the\r\n  inability to continue CSP due to maxing out the defendant's incarceration time\r\n  attributable to CSP revocations?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Section\r\n  24-21-560(D) Revisited\r\nIn\r\n  light of the Department's construction of section 24-21-560(D) in this case, we\r\n  acknowledge some confusion exists as to the aggregate amount of time a\r\n  defendant can be incarcerated and/or required to participate in CSP under a\r\n  sentence from the same offense.Â  We take this opportunity to clarify the Court's\r\n  interpretation of section 24-21-560(D).\r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  24-21-560(D) provides in pertinent part: \r\n\t(D) If a prisoner's community supervision is revoked by the court\r\n  and the court imposes a period of incarceration for the revocation, the\r\n  prisoner also must complete a community supervision program of up to two years\r\n  as determined by the department pursuant to subsection (B) when he is released\r\n  from incarceration.\r\n\tA prisoner who is sentenced for successive revocations of the\r\n  community supervision program may be required to serve terms of incarceration\r\n  for successive revocations, as provided in section 24-21-560(C), and may be\r\n  required to serve additional periods of\r\n  community supervision for successive revocations, as provided in section\r\n  24-21-560(D).Â  The maximum aggregate amount of time the prisoner may be\r\n  required to serve when sentenced for successive revocations may not exceed an\r\n  amount of time equal to the length of incarceration imposed for the original\r\n  &quot;no parole offense&quot;.Â  The original term of incarceration does not\r\n  include any portion of a suspended sentence.\r\n\t. . . \r\n\r\nWe now definitively state that the &quot;original sentence,&quot;\r\n  as referenced in section 24-21-560(D), includes both the suspended and\r\n  unsuspended portions of a circuit court's sentence; it is, in fact, the total\r\n  sentence handed down by the court.Â  Therefore, when a circuit court is faced\r\n  with a defendant's violation of the Department's CSP or normal probationary\r\n  term, the court may neither revoke and impose a term of further incarceration, nor\r\n  lengthen the term of the CSP or probation if that will result in the aggregate period\r\n  of service extending beyond the end of the term of the original sentence.[3] Â To interpret the original sentence,\r\n  as the Department has done in this case, would be to virtually eliminate the\r\n  suspended portion of any sentence.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  both efficiency and fairness dictate that our clarification today be\r\n  prospective only, applying to Respondent Picklesimer and to any defendant still\r\n  under the Department's jurisdiction as of the issuance of this opinion.[4]\r\nII. Discharge of the Remaining Sentence, Including CSP and\r\n  Probation\r\nThe State asserts the circuit court erred in\r\n  discharging Picklesimer from his entire remaining sentence, including CSP and\r\n  residual probation, pursuant to State v. Dawkins.Â  The State first\r\n  assigns error to the circuit court's finding that Picklesimer must be treated\r\n  as having successfully completed CSP, because in the Department's good faith attempt\r\n  to comply with McGrier and terminate Picklesimer's CSP due to his\r\n  apparent fulfillment of the available revocation period, the Department\r\n  effectively deprived him of the opportunity to successfully complete CSP.Â  We\r\n  agree.Â  \r\nIn Dawkins,\r\n  this Court held that probationary terms, and mandatory CSP terms for sentences\r\n  deriving from &quot;no parole offenses,&quot; run concurrently.Â  352 S.C. at\r\n  166-67, 573 S.E.2d at 785.Â  Moreover, it held that under the strict\r\n  construction of section 24-21-560(E), once a defendant participant of CSP\r\n  successfully completes the CSP program, the remainder of the defendant's\r\n  sentence, including any residual probation, would be discharged.Â  Id.; see\r\n    also Â§ 24-21-560(E) (&quot;A prisoner who successfully completes a\r\n  community supervision program pursuant to this section has satisfied his\r\n  sentence and must be discharged from his sentence.&quot;). Â The Court, however,\r\n  because it was unnecessary to the resolution of the case in Dawkins, did\r\n  not define what it meant by successful completion of CSP.Â  Dawkins, 352\r\n  S.C. at 167, 573 S.E.2d at 785 (&quot;Accordingly, Dawkins' sentence, including\r\n  probation, is discharged upon successful completion of the CSP.&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis in original).\r\nWe now hold\r\n  &quot;successful completion&quot; of CSP connotes the completion of a maximum\r\n  of two continuous years of CSP, as mandated by section 24-21-560(B), without\r\n  any violations or revocations, or a determination by the Department that a\r\n  defendant has fulfilled his CSP responsibilities prior to two years' service in\r\n  the program.Â  If the defendant's CSP is revoked for a period due to violations,\r\n  the CSP term begins anew upon the defendant's release.Â  See Â§\r\n  24-21-560(D).Â  However, we add the following caveat that incorporates our\r\n  clarification of section 24-21-560(D) above:Â  under no circumstances shall a\r\n  defendant be incarcerated, or forced to participate in mandatory CSP or\r\n  residual probation, stemming from the same conviction, outside of the time\r\n  given by the trial judge in the original sentence, which encompasses both the\r\n  suspended and unsuspended portions of the sentence.\r\nUnder this adjusted\r\n  interpretation, Picklesimer would not have been treated as having successfully\r\n  completed his CSP because he had not served two continuous years without any\r\n  violations or revocations of the CSP.Â  Additionally then, Picklesimer's CSP\r\n  would have continued to run, and he would have been eligible for incarceration\r\n  due to revocation until the outside time limit of his original sentence, June\r\n  1, 2010, or until he successfully completed his CSP.\r\nMoreover, this\r\n  definition of successful completion is entirely reconcilable with this Court's\r\n  holding in Dawkins.Â  If a defendant is sentenced to a term including\r\n  both a suspended and unsuspended portion, once the unsuspended portion has been\r\n  served, or eighty-five percent of which has been served, the defendant will be\r\n  released into the Department's CSP or normal probation program.Â  If the\r\n  defendant is enrolled and thereafter successfully completes a CSP according to\r\n  the definition expressed above, under Dawkins, the defendant's sentence\r\n  will be discharged, including any residual probation.Â  If the defendant is\r\n  required to enroll in normal probation upon initial release, rather than CSP,\r\n  the probationary term will continue to run until the end of the original\r\n  sentence.\r\nThe State next\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in finding no distinction between successful\r\n  completion of a CSP program and the inability to continue CSP due to a\r\n  defendant reaching the maximum allowable incarceration time attributable to CSP\r\n  revocations.Â  Based on our clarification and definition of successful\r\n  completion above, the State's contention is rendered moot, as the scenario that\r\n  occurred in Picklesimer's case, under the erroneous interpretation of section\r\n  24-21-560(D), is no longer a possibility.Â  More specifically, because the Court\r\n  finds that the original sentence encompasses both the suspended and unsuspended\r\n  portions of the sentence, coupled with our pronouncement in Dawkins that\r\n  CSP and normal probation run concurrently, then a defendant will either\r\n  successfully complete his CSP, or continue in CSP due to violation revocations\r\n  until the end of the original sentence, at which time the sentence will have\r\n  been fulfilled.Â  As a result, the problem of fulfilling the maximum allowable\r\n  incarceration time prior to the end of a defendant's original sentence is no\r\n  longer a temporal possibility.Â  See Mathis v. South Carolina State Highway\r\n    Dep't, 260 S.C. 344, 195 S.E.2d 713 (1973) (stating when there remains no\r\n  actual controversy, this Court will not pass on moot and academic questions or\r\n  render judgment which will have no practical effect).Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the judgment of\r\n  the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  I fully concur in the\r\n  majority's opinion and write separately to further clarify McGrier.Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is important to recognize that the sentence in McGrier was a no parole straight\r\n    sentence of three years, not a split sentence.Â  No part of\r\n  McGrier's sentence was suspended; therefore, the McGrier decision did\r\n  not involve a CSP incarceration as a result of a probation revocation. \r\nMcGrier\r\n  initially served eighty-five percent of his no parole sentence and was released\r\n  to CSP.Â  He failed to successfully complete CSP and was re-incarcerated\r\n  multiple times.Â  The McGrier decision determined that the total period\r\n  of incarceration for McGrier's CSP violations could not exceed the remaining\r\n  fifteen percent of his sentence.Â  The McGrier opinion used the phrase\r\n  &quot;unsuspended portion&quot; because the remaining fifteen percent was in\r\n  fact unsuspended.Â Â  Although McGrier was released after having served\r\n  eighty-five percent of his sentence, good time credits could not be used to\r\n  eliminate the availability of the unsuspended fifteen percent for CSP\r\n  purposes.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-210(F) (2007) (&quot;No credits\r\n  earned pursuant to this section may be applied in a manner which would prevent\r\n  full participation in the Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services'\r\n  prerelease or community supervision program as provided in Section\r\n  24-21-560.&quot;).\r\nPicklesimer\r\n  received a split sentence of ten years suspended to five years and five years\r\n  probation.Â  As a result, Picklesimer had five years and nine months left on his\r\n  sentence which could have been used to successfully complete CSP.Â  The nine\r\n  months good time credit earned on his initial five years active sentence is\r\n  effectively nullified pursuant to section 24-13-210(F) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Picklesimer was\r\n  sentenced on September 14, 2001, but was given credit for fifteen and one-half\r\n  months time served.Â  Thus, his ten year sentence began June 1, 2000, and the\r\n  five year unsuspended portion of Picklesimer's sentence expired on June 1,\r\n  2005.Â  \r\n[2] Service of\r\n  eighty-five percent of his five year sentence equates to Picklesimer having\r\n  been released nine months early.\r\n[3] We note that\r\n  under section 24-21-560(C) of the South Carolina Code (2007), a court may\r\n  revoke a defendant's CSP and impose a sentence of up to one year's\r\n  incarceration.Â  Our decision today does not impact upon a court's ability and\r\n  discretion to impose a one-year revocation sentence for CSP violations, except\r\n  for circumstances when less than one year remains of the defendant's original\r\n  sentence.Â  Instead, our holding sets only an outside time limit on a\r\n  defendant's aggregate amount of incarceration and/or CSP participation.\r\n[4] The Court\r\n  recognizes that the term of Picklesimer's original sentence, based on our\r\n  calculations, expired on June 1, 2010.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26832","title":"Boan v.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Karen\r\n  Ratigan, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In\r\n  this case, Nicholas Boan (Petitioner) appeals the denial of his request for\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR).\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nPetitioner was\r\n  convicted of criminal sexual conduct with a minor first degree and two counts\r\n  of lewd act upon a child.Â  At sentencing, the trial judge orally pronounced\r\n  Petitioner would serve twenty years for the first offense, fifteen years for\r\n  the second offense, and ten years for the third offense.Â  The first two\r\n  sentences were to run concurrently, and the ten year sentence was to run\r\n  consecutively.Â  The written sentencing order for the first offense, however,\r\n  indicated that Petitioner was to serve thirty years.Â  Trial counsel did not\r\n  make any motions regarding this discrepancy.\r\nPetitioner's direct\r\n  appeal was dismissed by the court of appeals, and Petitioner filed for PCR on\r\n  numerous grounds.Â  The PCR judge denied Petitioner's request for relief on all\r\n  grounds, finding no error in sentencing because the written sentencing order\r\n  controlled.Â  Petitioner appealed, and this Court granted the writ of\r\n  certiorari.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn PCR\r\n  proceedings, the burden of proof is on the applicant to prove the allegations\r\n  in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813,\r\n  814 (1985).Â  On appeal, the PCR courtâ€™s ruling should be upheld if it is\r\n  supported by any evidence of probative value in the record.Â  Cherry v. State,\r\n  300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).Â  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues trial counsel provided ineffective assistance for failing to file a\r\n  motion regarding the ten-year discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of the\r\n  sentence and the written sentencing order.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a defendant the\r\n  right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); Lomax\r\n      v. State, 379 S.C. 93, 665 S.E.2d 164 (2008). Courts use a two-pronged test in evaluating\r\n  allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  Strickland v. Washington,\r\n  466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2052; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386\r\n  S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  First, the applicant must show counselâ€™s representation was\r\n  deficient, which is measured by an objective standard of reasonableness.Â  Strickland,\r\n  466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2052.Â  Next, the applicant must show he\r\n  was prejudiced by counselâ€™s performance such that, but for counselâ€™s error,\r\n  there is a reasonable probability the result of the proceedings would have been\r\n  different.Â  Id. at 693, 104 S. Ct. at 2052. Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the trial judge orally pronounced a twenty-year sentence from the\r\n  bench, but signed a sentencing sheet ordering a thirty-year sentence.Â  Counsel\r\n  did not make any objections or motions regarding this significant variance.Â \r\n  Counsel's performance was deficient for failing to make a motion for\r\n  clarification or a motion to conform to the oral pronouncement.Â  Petitioner\r\n  clearly was prejudiced by this mistake because an additional ten years was\r\n  added onto his sentence.Â  \r\nHaving\r\n  determined counsel was deficient and Petitioner was prejudiced by that\r\n  deficiency, we must determine next whether there is a reasonable probability\r\n  Petitioner would not have been sentenced to an additional ten years if counsel\r\n  properly had brought the discrepancy to the trial court's attention.Â  We find this\r\n  element is satisfied.\r\nAlthough\r\n  this Court has not previously spoken on the issue of whether an oral\r\n  pronouncement of a sentence controls over a conflicting written sentencing\r\n  order, the majority of jurisdictions that have considered this point hold the\r\n  oral pronouncement controls.Â  See, e.g., U.S. v. Osborne, 345 F.3d 281\r\n  (4th Cir. 2003); Plourde v. State, 975 So. 2d 558 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  But see Bradley v. State, 864 P.2d 1272 (Nev. 1993) (holding an\r\n  oral pronouncement is modifiable by the judge, and the sentence is only final\r\n  once signed by the judge and entered by the clerk).Â  Some of these decisions\r\n  are founded on a federal or state rule of criminal procedure that requires a\r\n  defendant to be present at sentencing.Â  See, e.g., U.S. v. Turner, 532\r\n  F. Supp. 913, 916 n.2 (D. Cal. 1982) (finding FRCrimP 43 provides greater\r\n  protection than the Constitution, and a defendant's right to be present at\r\n  sentencing is based in the Rule).Â  South Carolina does not have this rule.Â \r\n  Other courts, however, have held that a criminal defendant has a constitutional\r\n  right to be present at sentencing.Â  See, e.g., U.S. v. Martinez, 250\r\n  F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir. 2001) (holding a defendant's constitutional right to be\r\n  present at sentencing mandates an oral pronouncement prevail over a conflicting\r\n  written sentence).Â  In the background of most of those decisions is United\r\n    States v. Gagnon, 470 U.S. 522, 105 S. Ct. 1482, 84 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1985),\r\n  in which the United States Supreme Court stated that a defendant has a due process\r\n  right to be present at all stages of the trial to the extent that a fair and\r\n  just hearing would be thwarted by his absence.Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  are persuaded by the reasoning of those courts, and find a trial's fairness is\r\n  compromised when a trial judge increases a defendant's sentence outside his\r\n  presence.Â  Accordingly, in a situation such as the one on appeal, due process\r\n  requires the judge's oral pronouncement control over a conflicting written\r\n  sentencing order.Â  Here, the trial judge announced one sentence from the bench\r\n  in the presence of the defendant, but later increased that sentence in his\r\n  written order.Â  If trial counsel had made the appropriate motion regarding the\r\n  sentencing discrepancy, the oral pronouncement would have controlled and\r\n  Petitioner would have received the twenty-year sentence.Â  Thus, Petitioner has\r\n  demonstrated a reasonable probability the result would have been different if\r\n  trial counsel had made the appropriate motion.Â  Accordingly, we hold Petitioner\r\n  has established the required elements for a claim of ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel, and the PCR judge erred in denying his petition. \r\nThis\r\n  Court has previously held that post-conviction relief may be tailored to remedy\r\n  the precise prejudice resulting from trial counsel's deficient performance.Â  Rolen\r\n    v. State, 384 S.C. 409, 414-15, 683 S.E.2d 471, 474 (2009) (citing United\r\n      States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 364, 101 S. Ct. 665, 66 L. Ed. 564 (1981)\r\n  (recognizing that the remedy for a violation\r\n  of the Sixth Amendment right to\r\n  counsel â€œshould be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violationâ€)).Â  Because Petitioner's only argument on appeal\r\n  is the error in sentencing regarding the offense of criminal sexual conduct\r\n  with a minor first degree, we remand for resentencing only as to that offense.Â  See Dervin v. State, 386 S.C. 164, 169, 687 S.E.2d 712, 714 (2009)\r\n  (remanding for resentencing when defendant given a 25-year sentence but 10\r\n  years was the maximum allowed for the offense); Davie v. State, 381 S.C.\r\n  601, 616, 675 S.E.2d 416, 424 (2009) (remanding for resentencing).Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the PCR judge's denial of relief is reversed, and the\r\n  case is remanded[1] for resentencing on the offense of criminal sexual conduct with a minor first\r\n  degree.\r\nBEATTY\r\n  and HEARN, JJ., concur.

(Insurance Associates), an insurance agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondents Eric and Melissa Fowler (the Fowlers) were severely injured\r\n  when a vehicle driven by Sallie Hunter (Hunter) collided with their\r\n  motorcycle.Â  Among the physical harm suffered by the Fowlers was a permanent\r\n  brain injury to Melissa Fowler.Â  The car driven by Hunter was owned by Hunter's\r\n  husband's medical practice, Gynecological Oncology Associates (GOA).Â  The\r\n  Fowlers filed a negligence action against Hunter and GOA.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThree insurance policies were initially thought to provide coverage for\r\n  the accident.Â  First, GOA had a business automobile insurance policy with a\r\n  limit of one million dollars issued by Auto-Owners Insurance that insured the\r\n  car driven by Hunter.Â  Hunter and her husband also had a personal catastrophic\r\n  liability policy with a limit of two million dollars, which was issued by\r\n  Selective Insurance Company (Selective).Â  There are no coverage questions with\r\n  respect to these two policies.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nHowever,\r\n  GOA also had a commercial liability policy with a limit of four million dollars\r\n  issued by Selective, but procured by Insurance Associates.Â  GOA intended that\r\n  this policy provide automobile coverage, however Selective contended that the\r\n  commercial liability policy did not provide automobile coverage.Â  In reaction\r\n  to Selective's contention, the Fowlers filed the instant declaratory judgment\r\n  action against Hunter, GOA, Selective, and Insurance Associates to determine\r\n  the amount of available insurance coverage under the commercial liability\r\n  policy.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHunter\r\n  and GOA answered and filed cross-claims against Selective for breach of\r\n  contract, bad faith, and reformation.Â  Hunter and GOA also asserted a cause of\r\n  action against Insurance Associates for professional negligence, in which\r\n  Hunter and GOA alleged Insurance Associates, as the agent for Selective, failed\r\n  to properly issue the policy with automobile coverage as requested by GOA.Â \r\n  They also alleged Selective was liable for the acts and omissions of Insurance\r\n  Associates because Insurance Associates was acting as the agent for Selective.Â \r\n  Selective then filed a cross-claim against Insurance Associates for equitable\r\n  indemnification.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt GOA's\r\n  request, Insurance Associates procured the commercial liability policy through\r\n  Selective's &quot;One and Done&quot; software program.Â  Hunter and GOA alleged\r\n  Insurance Associates representative, Roy Phillips (Phillips), simply failed to\r\n  check the appropriate box within the &quot;One and Done&quot; program, which\r\n  would have provided GOA with the requested automobile coverage under the\r\n  commercial liability policy.Â  In his deposition, Phillips testified that GOA\r\n  requested automobile coverage under the policy, but that he inadvertently\r\n  failed to check the correct box.Â  According to Phillips, there would not have\r\n  been any additional cost added to the premium had he included automobile coverage\r\n  as requested.Â  Finally, Phillips testified that Insurance Associates had the\r\n  authority to issue the policy and bind Selective.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nEventually,\r\n  all of the parties except for Insurance Associates agreed to settle the\r\n  motorcycle suit and entered into a global settlement agreement.Â  As part of\r\n  this agreement, Auto-Owners Insurance agreed to tender to the Fowlers the\r\n  limits on the Hunter's one million dollar automobile policy.Â  Also, Selective\r\n  agreed to tender the policy limits on the two million dollar personal\r\n  catastrophic liability policy.Â  Furthermore, Selective agreed to pay the\r\n  Fowlers an additional one and a half million dollars within thirty days of the\r\n  filing date of an order approving the settlement, which was required because of\r\n  Melissa Fowler's brain injury.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNotably, the Fowlers signed a covenant not to execute against the\r\n  Hunters[1] and GOA.Â  The Hunters and GOA also assigned to the Fowlers their professional\r\n  negligence claim against Insurance Associates.Â  Selective and the Fowlers\r\n  agreed to cooperate in the pursuit of the professional negligence and equitable\r\n  indemnification actions.Â  Furthermore, they agreed to equally split the costs\r\n  and potential proceeds realized from these causes of action.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter the\r\n  trial court approved the settlement, Insurance Associates moved for summary\r\n  judgment as to the causes of action for professional negligence and equitable\r\n  indemnity.Â  The trial court granted these motions.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nWith respect to the professional negligence claim, the trial court\r\n  found the covenant not to execute entered into by the parties relieved Hunter\r\n  and GOA from further liability from any and all claims arising from the motorcycle\r\n  accident.Â  Therefore, the trial court found that the Fowlers, standing in the\r\n  shoes of Hunter and GOA, could never prove damages with respect to Insurance\r\n  Associates' alleged failure to procure automobile insurance coverage under the\r\n  four million dollar commercial liability policy.Â  Thus, the trial court granted\r\n  the motion for summary judgment.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial\r\n  court granted summary judgment as to Selective's cause of action for equitable\r\n  indemnification finding that Selective was not harmed by Insurance Associate's\r\n  alleged negligence.Â  The trial court noted Insurance Associates' argument that\r\n  Selective was actually benefitted by Insurance Associates' failure to procure\r\n  the desired automobile coverage.Â  Specifically, Insurance Associates argued\r\n  that had it prepared the policy as requested, Selective would have been unquestionably\r\n  liable for four million dollars, the total amount of the policy.Â  However,\r\n  Insurance Associates argued that Selective was able to settle the claim for\r\n  only one and a half million dollars because of the uncertainties involved.Â  The\r\n  trial court agreed and concluded it was impossible to determine whether\r\n  Selective was harmed by Insurance Associates' mistake.Â  Therefore, the trial\r\n  court ruled there could be no finding of harm and granted summary judgment as\r\n  to the equitable indemnification claim.Â Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe court of appeals reversed.Â  Insurance Associates filed a petition\r\n  for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted.Â \r\n  \r\n  Issues\r\n  Insurance\r\n    Associates presents the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in\r\n    reversing the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to the claim for\r\n    professional negligence?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in\r\n    reversing the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to the claim for\r\n    equitable indemnification?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  Standard\r\n    of Review\r\n  \r\nWhen reviewing a grant of summary judgment, an appellate court applies\r\n  the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Fleming\r\n  v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).Â  Summary judgment is\r\n  appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the\r\n  moving party must prevail as a matter of law.Â  Id.; Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â \r\n  When determining if any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party.Â  Id.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Law/Analysis\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  I.&nbsp; Professional Negligence\r\n  \r\nInsurance Associates argues that the court of appeals erred in\r\n  reversing summary judgment as to the Fowlers' claim for professional\r\n  negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nTo\r\n  establish a cause of action in negligence, a plaintiff must prove the following\r\n  three elements: (1) a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) breach\r\n  of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damages proximately\r\n  resulting from the breach of duty.Â  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 710 (2000).Â  Â Â Â  Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nInsurance\r\n  Associates argues the court of appeals erred in following other jurisdictions\r\n  that allow the prosecution of assigned claims such as this because the court of\r\n  appeals' reasoning disregards the essential element of damages from the tort of\r\n  negligence.Â  The court of appeals held the trial court's analysis concerning\r\n  the Fowler's inability to prove damages was technically correct, but was\r\n  persuaded by the foreign jurisdictions that have addressed the issue and\r\n  elected to allow such assigned claims to proceed.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nExamining several decisions from foreign jurisdictions, the court of\r\n  appeals found that a majority of other courts have approved similar settlement\r\n  agreements, provided the risk of collusion is minimized.Â  Citing Bartholomew\r\n  v. McCartha, 255 S.C. 489, 179 S.E.2d 912 (1971), the court of appeals held\r\n  South Carolina has expressed a willingness to depart from the technicalities of\r\n  the common law in order to promote reasonable settlements in civil suits.Â  The\r\n  court further held South Carolina law required the careful scrutiny of\r\n  settlement agreements to avoid the potential for complicity or wrongdoing.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe agree\r\n  with the court of appeals' reliance on the Supreme Judicial Court of\r\n  Massachusetts's holding in Campione v. Wilson, 661 N.E.2d 658 (1996), in\r\n  which that court found the existence of conflicting approaches to this issue\r\n  throughout the country reflects a balancing of policy considerations.Â  The\r\n  Massachusetts court held the primary concern in many cases with the same\r\n  procedural posture as the instant matter is the risk of collusion when an\r\n  insured is protected from liability by an agreement not to execute prior to the\r\n  entry of judgment in the underlying tort action.Â  Id.Â  We agree with\r\n  this holding.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nInsurance Associates argues that the parties' settlement in this case\r\n  was collusive.Â  We disagree.Â  The court of appeals addressed this issue and correctly\r\n  held there was no evidence of collusion between the parties.Â  For instance, the\r\n  parties did not stipulate as to the Fowlers' damages in the settlement\r\n  agreement to reduce the appearance of collusion and the settling parties\r\n  believed the motorcycle suit would be tried to a conclusion.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  settlement enabled the Fowlers to obtain the three million dollars available\r\n  under the two policies in which coverage was not disputed, while litigation\r\n  against Insurance Associates was not foreclosed.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBecause the court of appeals correctly recognized that South Carolina\r\n  courts favor settlement and determined that there was no collusion involved in\r\n  the settlement, it reversed the trial court's order granting summary judgment\r\n  as to the assigned professional negligence claim.Â  The court of appeals'\r\n  reasoning is sound and we affirm its holding with respect to this issue.Â \r\n  \r\n  II.&nbsp; Equitable Indemnification\r\n  \r\nInsurance Associates\r\n  argues the court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court's grant of\r\n  summary judgment as to Selective's claim for equitable indemnification.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nA\r\n  plaintiff may maintain an equitable indemnification action if he was compelled\r\n  to pay damages because of negligence imputed to him as the result of another's tortious act. Â Vermeer Carolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Co., 336\r\n  S.C. 53, 518 S.E.2d 301 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  A plaintiff asserting an equitable\r\n  indemnification cause of action may recover damages if he proves: (1) the\r\n  indemnitor was liable for causing the plaintiff's damages; (2) the indemnitee\r\n  was exonerated from any liability for those damages; and (3) the indemnitee\r\n  suffered damages as a result of the plaintiff's claims against it, which were\r\n  eventually proven to be the fault of the indemnitor.Â  Id.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nInsurance\r\n  Associates argues the trial court's grant of summary judgment was appropriate\r\n  because Selective cannot show it has been damaged by Insurance Associate's\r\n  alleged negligence.Â  Specifically, Insurance Associates asserts that Selective\r\n  would have been liable for four million dollars had it procured the policy as\r\n  requested.Â  Thus, because Selective settled for one and a half million dollars,\r\n  as opposed to the four million dollar liability limit, Insurance Associates\r\n  argues Selective was benefitted by its negligence.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nInsurance Associates' argument lacks merit because it is not clear from\r\n  the record whether Selective would have issued the automobile coverage at\r\n  issue, voluntarily exposing itself to liability.Â  In support of its argument\r\n  that Selective would have unquestionably issued the automobile coverage but for\r\n  its negligence, Insurance Associates points to a set of guidelines related to\r\n  the &quot;One and Done&quot; software program.Â  These guidelines, Insurance\r\n  Associates argues, allowed agents to automatically secure policies if certain\r\n  criteria were met.Â  It claims these criteria were met.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNonetheless, Selective claims that the required preconditions for the\r\n  issuance of automobile coverage were not met and points to its own set of\r\n  guidelines showing that coverage of the sort at issue here may not be\r\n  automatically issued unless the underlying policy of automobile insurance was\r\n  also issued by Selective.Â  The underlying automobile policy in this case was\r\n  not issued by Selective, but by Auto-Owners.Â  Thus, Selective argues that it\r\n  would not have issued the automobile coverage at issue exposing itself to four\r\n  million dollars of liability, thus the one and a half million dollar paid in\r\n  settlement are damages directly related to Insurance Associates' negligence.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe court of appeals found the competing sets of guidelines raised a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact as to damages precluding summary judgment and\r\n  reversed the trial court's grant. Â Insurance Associates' additional arguments\r\n  in support of reversal, such as Selective's alleged failure to mitigate\r\n  damages, misunderstand the reasoning of the court of appeals and are without\r\n  merit.Â  We agree with the narrow grounds upon which the court of appeals\r\n  reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment on the equitable indemnification\r\n  claim and, thus, affirm its decision.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Conclusion\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appeals' reversal of the trial\r\n  court's grant of summary judgment on the claims for professional negligence and\r\n  equitable indemnification.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justices James E.

Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-1400\r\n  (2002).Â  Plaintiffs allege Defendants fraudulently calculated their LCM, which\r\n  was submitted to the Department of Insurance (DOI) in 2001, in order to charge\r\n  excessively high premiums.Â Â Â  \r\nThe questions certified to this Court concern how, if at all, the\r\n  Filed Rate Doctrine applies to Plaintiffs' claims.Â  The Filed Rate Doctrine was\r\n  adopted by this Court in the case of Edge v. State Farm Mutual Insurance\r\n    Company, 366 S.C. 511, 623 S.E.2d 387 (2005), and &quot;was originally a\r\n  federal preemption rule which provided that rates duly adopted by a regulatory\r\n  agency are not subject to collateral attack in court.&quot;Â  \r\nIssues\r\nThe United States District Court for the District of\r\n  South Carolina has certified the following two questions to this Court:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tUnder South Carolina law, were the Defendants' \r\n\t\t\tsubmissions to the DOI in 2001 &quot;filed rates&quot; within the\r\n  meaning of the Filed Rate Doctrine as adopted by this Court in Edge? \r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDoes South Carolina recognize an exception to the \r\n\t\t\tFiled Rate Doctrine that permits a private plaintiff to avoid the \r\n\t\t\tFiled Rate Doctrine by alleging that regulatory approval for the \r\n\t\t\trate was obtained through fraudulent means, or must a private \r\n\t\t\tplaintiff seek remedies solely through administrative channels?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Applicability\r\n  of Filed Rate Doctrine to Plaintiffs' Claims\r\nPlaintiffs argue the Filed Rate Doctrine does not bar its claims.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nThe Filed Rate Doctrine &quot;stands for the proposition that\r\n  because an administrative agency is vested with the authority to determine what\r\n  rate is just and reasonable, courts should not adjudicate what a reasonable\r\n  rate might be in a collateral lawsuit.&quot; Edge, 366 S.C. at 517, 623\r\n  S.E.2d at 391 (quoting Amundson &amp; Assocs. Art Studio v. Nat'l Council on\r\n    Comp. Ins., 988 P.2d 1208, 1213 (1999)).Â  The DOI was not vested with the\r\n  authority to determine the rates applicable to the workers' compensation\r\n  policies at issue, thus the Filed Rate Doctrine does not bar Plaintiffs' claims\r\n  in this instance.Â  \r\nA brief examination of the regulatory scheme applicable to\r\n  workers' compensation policies provides the necessary context to understand the\r\n  issues before this Court.Â  Generally, the DOI is vested with the authority to\r\n  regulate the insurance industry.Â  For regulatory purposes, there are three\r\n  categories of workers' compensation insurance that employers can maintain:\r\n  self-insurance, assigned risk insurance, and voluntary insurance.Â  The workers'\r\n  compensation insurance at issue is voluntary insurance.\r\nEach category of workers' compensation insurance is regulated in a\r\n  different manner by the DOI.Â  An examination of the regulatory scheme\r\n  applicable to the self-insurance category is irrelevant to our understanding of\r\n  the issues before the Court.Â  However, an understanding of the regulation of\r\n  assigned risk insurance and voluntary insurance is necessary to properly\r\n  contextualize the Federal Court's certified questions.\r\nGenerally, those employers participating in the assigned risk\r\n  program are high-risk insureds that were unable to procure insurance in the\r\n  open market.Â  In contrast, those employers participating in the voluntary\r\n  program were able to acquire insurance on the open market.Â  The differences in\r\n  the nature of these programs are reflected in their\r\n  respective regulation.Â  In 1989, the General Assembly established a rating\r\n  system for the assigned risk insurance and voluntary insurance programs.Â  As\r\n  briefly explained before, the rates in both programs are calculated by the use\r\n  of two categories of data: the LC and the LCM.[1]Â \r\n  The LC is derived by the National Council of Compensation Insurers (NCCI) and\r\n  submitted to the DOI for approval.Â  The LCM differs from the LC in that it is\r\n  not industry wide or calculated by a rating agency but is carrier-specific and\r\n  calculated using figures for expenses and profits each individual carrier\r\n  incurs in the market. \r\nBeginning in 1990, the DOI differentiated between the voluntary\r\n  and assigned risk programs as to how the &quot;expense component,&quot; or LCM,\r\n  would be developed and who would file this information.Â  Section 38-73-1380\r\n  provides for the LCM to be &quot;filed with the department and approved by the\r\n  director or his designee, by each member or subscriber of a rating organization\r\n  independently.&quot;Â  The DOI, however, utilized the discretion given to it\r\n  under section 38-73-1430 to mandate that the rating organization \r\n\r\n\tfile a proposed expense component for the Assigned Risk Plan\r\n  reflecting the cost of the Assigned Risk Plan only, which, when approved, will\r\n  be added to the approved pure loss component for the Assigned Risk Plan to\r\n  become the final rate for the Plan.\r\n\r\nDepartment of\r\n  Insurance Bulletin No. 1990-05.\r\nThus,\r\n  after the inception of the rating system in 1990, workers' compensation\r\n  insurance rates were to be established uniformly throughout the assigned risk\r\n  program.Â  In contrast, however, insurers in the voluntary program market relied\r\n  on rating agencies for the LC used in calculating their rates, but developed\r\n  and filed their own LCM.Â  The Administrative Law Court recognized this change\r\n  by stating that &quot;[e]ach carrier determines its own final rates in the\r\n  voluntary program by combining its own expenses with the loss costs.&quot;Â  NCCI\r\n    v. SCDOI, et. al., 05-ALJ-09-0355-CC (S.C. Admin L. Ct. 2005) (http://www.scalc.net/decisions.aspx?q=4&amp;id=8127#_ftn1)\r\n  (last visited June 2, 2010).Â  Nonetheless, within its bulletin establishing a\r\n  two-tiered rating system, the DOI mandated that all insurers filing proposed\r\n  LCM figures, including those in the voluntary insurance market, &quot;shall\r\n  include the necessary information required by 'SCID Form No. 2007,' â€¦ and all\r\n  data necessary to support the filing.&quot;Â  Department of Insurance Bulletin\r\n  No. 1990-05.Â  These filings were subject to public hearing.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  deregulation of the voluntary insurance program continued when, in 2000, the\r\n  General Assembly altered the filing and review requirements for workers'\r\n  compensation insurers seeking deviations from their previously-approved\r\n  premiums.Â  The General Assembly introduced the definition of &quot;exempt\r\n  commercial policies&quot; to the rating scheme in 2000 Act No. 235.Â  Exempt\r\n  commercial policies were defined as insurance contracts: \r\n\r\n\t. . . for large commercial insureds where the total combined\r\n  premiums to be paid for these policies for one insured is greater than fifty\r\n  thousand dollars annually and as may be further provided for in regulation or\r\n  in bulletins issued by the director.Â  Exempt commercial policies include all\r\n  property and casualty coverages except for commercial property and insurance\r\n  related to credit transaction written through financial institutions.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-1-20(40) (2002).Â  The definition of casualty insurance includes workers'\r\n  compensation insurance.Â  Id. Â§ 38-1-20(9).Â  Thus, workers' compensation\r\n  insurance policies are exempt commercial policies.Â  \r\nThe General Assembly provided that &quot;[e]xempt commercial\r\n  policies are not subject to prior approval by the [DOI].&quot;Â  Act No. 235,\r\n  2000 S.C. Acts 1683, Â§ 8 (codified as S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-910(G) (2002)).Â \r\n  The General Assembly amended the definition of exempt commercial policies by\r\n  removing the minimum premium requirement, thus making all commercial insured\r\n  policies exempt from DOI rate approval.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-1-20(4) (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  \r\nThe General Assembly's recognition of a class of exempt commercial\r\n  policies abrogated the DOI's rate-making authority over the policies at issue.Â \r\n  Act No. 235 eliminated the subject policies from the public notice requirement\r\n  by specifically exempting them from the rate-making requirements of Title 38.Â \r\n  This exemption eliminated the instant policies from the requirement of public\r\n  notice given to consumers of a proposed rate increase and the fundamental\r\n  requirement that &quot;[n]o insurer may make or issue a contract or policy\r\n  except in accordance with the filings which are in effect for the\r\n  insurer.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 38-73-920.Â  \r\nFurthermore, this Court has recognized that &quot;sellers of\r\n  exempt commercial policies are not required to file rate schedules and plans\r\n  with the [DOI].&quot;Â  Croft v. Old Republic, 365 S.C. 402, 410, 618\r\n  S.E.2d 909, 913 (2005).Â  Finally, the DOI has specifically noted that &quot;no\r\n  insurer of exempt commercial policies will be required to file any\r\n  classification, rate, rule, or rating plan.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 69-64\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  As argued by Plaintiffs, the DOI continued to require rating\r\n  agencies to file LC data with the DOI for its approval.Â  However, beginning in\r\n  2000 with the advent of exempt commercial policies, the DOI was not vested with\r\n  the authority to regulate LCM.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  filing at issue was made in 2001, a year after exempt commercial policies were\r\n  no longer subject to rate setting regulation by the DOI.Â  All of policies at\r\n  issue were for large commercial insureds and carried premiums in excess of\r\n  $50,000, thus all were exempt commercial policies under both the original and\r\n  amended versions of the definition of this term.Â  Therefore, because the submission\r\n  made by Defendants in 2001 did not invoke the regulatory authority of the DOI,\r\n  the Plaintiffs' claim against Defendants is not barred by the Filed Rate\r\n  Doctrine.\r\nII.&nbsp; Exceptions to\r\n  the Filed Rate Doctrine\r\nPlaintiff argues that, if the Filed Rate Doctrine applies in this\r\n  instance, their claims ought to fall within an exception to the Doctrine.Â  Because\r\n  the Filed Rate Doctrine does not apply so as to bar Plaintiffs' claims, we\r\n  decline to answer the second certified question.\r\nConclusion\r\nIn addressing the issues before us, we make no\r\n  judgments regarding the merits of Plaintiffs' underlying claims.Â  We answer the\r\n  questions narrowly, finding that because the workers' compensation policies at\r\n  issue were exempt commercial policies, Defendants' submissions to the DOI in\r\n  2001 did not invoke the regulatory authority of the DOI and the Filed Rate\r\n  Doctrine does not bar Plaintiffs' claims.Â  Thus, the Court need not address the\r\n  Federal Court's second certified question.Â  \r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The &quot;pure loss component,&quot; which is another term for LC, is comprised\r\n  of:\r\n\r\n\t[t]hat portion of the final rate or\r\n  premium charge applicable to calendar/accident year incurred losses (the sum of\r\n  paid losses plus loss reserves including incurred but not reported loss\r\n  reserves) and loss adjustment expense (those expenses directly related to the\r\n  payment of claims) in this State, trended to include both the past and\r\n  prospective loss experience.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-1400(1).\r\nThe &quot;expense component,&quot; which is another\r\n  term for LCM, is comprised of:\r\n\r\n\tthat portion of the final rate or\r\n  premium charge applicable to production costs (including commissions and other\r\n  acquisition expenses), underwriting costs, administrative costs (including the\r\n  actual costs of taxes, licenses and fees), and profit margin in this State.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C.

Â Brewer was previously a\r\n  toxicologist at the Clemson Veterinary Diagnostic Center and with SLED.Â  Beginning\r\n  with Helton's BAC at the time of death, Brewer used a method called &quot;retrograde\r\n  extrapolation&quot; to determine how many beers Helton would have to have\r\n  consumed over the hours preceding the accident to reach a .212 BAC.Â  Brewer\r\n  testified that, based on his calculations, Helton must have consumed more than\r\n  the amount of beer testimony had suggested in order to reach a .212 level.Â \r\n  Brewer also stated that Helton's approximate BAC during the time he was at The\r\n  Getaway would have been between .18 and .20, and that Helton would have been\r\n  grossly intoxicated and exhibiting symptoms of intoxication.Â  \r\nThe jury returned a\r\n  verdict for Respondents in the amount of $8,000,000 for Hartfield and\r\n  $2,000,000 for Hartfield's father.Â  The court then conducted a hearing to\r\n  determine whether the corporate veil of The Getaway could be pierced. Â The\r\n  trial court issued an order piercing the corporate veil thereby making Shou Mei\r\n  Morris and The Getaway (Appellants) liable in the amount awarded by the jury.Â \r\n  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIssues\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in admitting the testimony \r\n\t\t\tof Brewer?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in failing to direct a \r\n\t\t\tverdict in favor of The Getaway?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in charging the jury \r\n\t\t\tstatutory inferences from the criminal statute on driving under the \r\n\t\t\tinfluence?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in failing to charge the \r\n\t\t\tjury that the plaintiff must prove Helton was visibly intoxicated at \r\n\t\t\tThe Getaway?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in instructing \r\n\t\t\tthe jury that The Getaway is liable if employees should have known \r\n\t\t\tHelton was intoxicated?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial judge err in piercing the \r\n\t\t\tcorporate veil of The Getaway?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Brewer's Testimony\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Brewer.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and\r\n  will not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  See Hofer\r\n    v. St. Clair,&nbsp;298 S.C. 503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736, 742&nbsp;(1989).Â  &quot;An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a\r\n  factual conclusion without evidentiary support.&quot;Â  Conner v.

App. 1993).Â  A party may ask a hypothetical\r\n  question of an expert, but the hypothetical must be based on facts supported by\r\n  the evidence.Â  Id. at 82, 427 S.E.2d at 688.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Appellants objected to the introduction of Brewer's testimony as\r\n  speculative.Â  Appellants contend that Hartfield did not establish sufficient\r\n  facts for the expert to give an opinion as to Helton's sobriety when he was at\r\n  The Getaway.Â  The court of appeals addressed a similar argument in Gathers.Â \r\n  In Gathers, the plaintiff was electrocuted when he touched a copper\r\n  water pipe under his home, and plaintiff's counsel called an expert who, based\r\n  on a hypothetical question, theorized that a defect in the defendant's service\r\n  line caused the pipe to become electrified.Â  Id.Â  The defendant argued\r\n  that the testimony should have been excluded because there was not a sufficient\r\n  factual foundation upon which to base the opinion.Â  Id.Â  The court of\r\n  appeals found no error in admitting the testimony stating:\r\n\r\n\t[C]ounsel\r\n  may rely upon circumstantial evidence to prove an essential fact in framing a\r\n  hypothetical question. Â Deciding\r\n  whether a conclusion assumed in the hypothetical is at least reasonably\r\n  supported by circumstantial evidence is a question of law for the court. Â If\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably supports the assumptions, whether the\r\n  evidence actually establishes the assumed facts becomes a question of fact for\r\n  the trier of fact.\r\n\r\nId. at 83, 427 S.E.2d at 688-89.\r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the circumstantial evidence presented by Respondents was sufficient to\r\n  support Brewer's opinions.Â  As outlined above, Respondents established a\r\n  general timeline of Helton's activities on the day of the accident.Â  Respondents\r\n  introduced evidence showing Helton's BAC at the time of the accident and\r\n  elicited testimony that Helton left a voice message just prior to the accident\r\n  in which he sounded intoxicated.Â  Respondents also called witnesses who testified\r\n  concerning the approximate time Helton left The Getaway and the amount of\r\n  alcohol he consumed between leaving The Getaway and the time of the wreck.Â  We\r\n  find that this evidence provided reasonable support for Brewer's testimony.Â \r\n  Though Respondents' case was based on circumstantial evidence, Respondents\r\n  sufficiently developed the facts to form the basis of Brewer's testimony.Â \r\n  Hence, the trial court did not err in admitting Brewer's testimony.Â  \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Directed Verdict\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue Respondents did not meet their burden to establish that the employees of\r\n  The Getaway &quot;knowingly&quot; sold beer to an intoxicated person.Â \r\n  Consequently, Appellants contend the trial court erred in refusing to direct a\r\n  verdict for Appellants.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court must view the evidence\r\n  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  See Sabb v. S.C.\r\n    State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236&nbsp;(2002) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  A motion for a directed verdict goes to the entire case and may be\r\n  granted only when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to liability.Â  See Carolina Home Builders, Inc. v. Armstrong Furnace Co., 259 S.C. 346,\r\n  358, 191 S.E.2d 774, 779 (1972). Â This Court will reverse the trial court's\r\n  rulings on directed verdict motions only where there is no evidence to support\r\n  the rulings or where the rulings are controlled by an error of law.Â  See Â Hinkle v. National Cas. Ins. Co.,&nbsp;354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616,\r\n  618&nbsp;(2003) (citation omitted). Â \r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-580 (2009) provides in part that &quot;[n]o holder of a permit\r\n  authorizing the sale of beer or wine or a servant, agent, or employee of the\r\n  permittee may knowingly commit any of the following acts upon the licensed\r\n  premises covered by the holder's permit: . . . (2) sell beer or wine to an\r\n  intoxicated person . . . .&quot;Â  \r\nIn Daley\r\n  v. Ward, 303 S.C. 81, 399 S.E.2d 13 (Ct. App. 1990), the court of appeals\r\n  established that a third party injured by actions of an intoxicated person\r\n  served in violation of the earlier version of section 61-4-580 may pursue a\r\n  civil action against the vendor.Â  Daley, 303 S.C. at 84, 399 S.E.2d at\r\n  14.Â  The court further allowed that an injured third party may show that the\r\n  alleged violators knowingly served alcohol to an intoxicated person or were\r\n  confronted with such information, from the person's appearance or otherwise, as\r\n  would lead a prudent man to believe that the person was intoxicated.Â  See\r\n    id. at 86, 399 S.E.2d at 15.Â  \r\nIn Daley,\r\n  the court of appeals considered whether or not a trial judge should have\r\n  granted a motion for directed verdict.Â  Id. at 84, 399 S.E.2d at 15.Â  The\r\n  evidence in Daley was that the driver had nine twelve-ounce cans of beer over\r\n  the previous four or five hours, did not recall drinking beer at any other\r\n  establishment that evening, and officers indicated they believed the driver was\r\n  intoxicated immediately after the accident.Â  Id. at 83, 399 S.E.2d at\r\n  14.Â  The court of appeals held there was no error in denying the directed\r\n  verdict motion, noting &quot;[t]here was more than ample evidence that Ward was\r\n  intoxicated at the time of the accident and the jury could have easily\r\n  concluded he was just as intoxicated at the time he was served his last beer at the [bar].&quot; Id. at 84-85, 399 S.E.2d at 15.Â  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, Respondents established a timeline of Helton's actions and that Helton\r\n  had a .212 BAC only fifty to ninety-five minutes after leaving The Getaway.Â \r\n  Keller testified he had no doubt that Helton was under the influence of alcohol\r\n  when he left a voice message for his wife minutes before the accident.Â  Brewer\r\n  testified that, using retrograde extrapolation, a man of Helton's approximate\r\n  weight would have exhibited outward symptoms of intoxication.Â  Given the\r\n  deferential standard of review with regard to motions for directed verdict, we\r\n  find that Respondents presented sufficient evidence for a jury question.Â  The\r\n  trial court therefore did not err in denying Appellants' motion.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Statutory Inference\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend the trial court erred in allowing a permissive inference from the driving\r\n  under the influence (DUI) statute.Â  Appellants argue that the trial judge's\r\n  instruction on the inference for DUI was error for two reasons: (1) the charge\r\n  was not relevant to a civil case and (2) there was no showing that the blood\r\n  and urine samples were handled in accordance with procedures approved by SLED,\r\n  per the requirements of the implied consent statute.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the close of the trial, the judge charged the jury in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tNow, in proving the violation of this statute the\r\n  plaintiff must prove that the defendant or both defendants or their employees\r\n  violated the statute, they sold alcoholic beverages to a person that they knew\r\n  or should have known was intoxicated at the time they sold the alcoholic\r\n  beverages to that person.Â  If that is proven to you by the greater weight or\r\n  preponderance of the evidence, then I would charge you that an intoxicated\r\n  person is a person who has drunk a sufficient quantity of an intoxicating\r\n  beverage to appreciably impair the normal control of their bodily or mental\r\n  functions.\r\n\tNow, in this state at the time there was a permissive\r\n  inference that a person was under the influence of alcohol when that person has\r\n  a blood alcohol level of .10 percent or greater.Â  Now, you have to determine if\r\n  it's been established at the time that the alcohol was served and the person\r\n  was intoxicated.Â  Now, this inference is just an inference to be taken by you\r\n  along with any other evidence of intoxication that you find in the case.Â  \r\n\r\nBecause\r\n  South Carolina does not have a Dram Shop Act, our civil remedy arises out of\r\n  criminal statutes.Â  See Tobias v. Sports Club, Inc., 332 S.C. 90,\r\n  92, 504 S.E.2d 318, 319&nbsp;(1998) (holding injured third parties may bring a\r\n  negligence suit against the tavern owner based on a violation of the alcohol\r\n  control statutes).Â  Similarly, a trial judge in a civil action should be able\r\n  to aid the jury in assessing whether a bartender knowingly sold alcohol to an\r\n  intoxicated individual by charging the jury on permissible inferences regarding\r\n  &quot;being under the influence of alcohol&quot; under our criminal laws.Â  The\r\n  civil remedy is predicated on criminal statutes, thus it should be permissible\r\n  for a trial judge to charge on the permissive inference of intoxication under\r\n  our criminal statutes.Â  Hence, the charge as given was relevant in a civil case\r\n  and the trial court committed no error in charging the permissible inference.Â  \r\nAlso,\r\n  Appellants' contention that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 (Supp. 2009) forbids entrance\r\n  of Helton's BAC is misplaced.Â  Section 56-5-2950 is designed to ensure\r\n  procedural due process in a criminal trial.Â  See Taylor v. S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Motor Vehicles, 368 S.C. 33, 37, 627 S.E.2d 751, 753&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (&quot;The implied consent laws of this State attempt to balance the\r\n  interest of the State in maintaining safe highways with the interest of the\r\n  individual in maintaining personal autonomy free from arbitrary or overbearing\r\n  State action.&quot;). Â Therefore, if someone's BAC was obtained in violation of\r\n  this statute, it only affects admissibility in a criminal proceeding.Â  Because\r\n  the present matter is a civil case, the procedural due process concerns of a\r\n  criminal case are not present and section 56-5-2950 is inapplicable.Â  So long\r\n  as a sufficient chain of custody exists to authenticate the evidence in a civil\r\n  case, this type of evidence is admissible.Â  Thus, the trial court committed no\r\n  error in allowing evidence of Helton's BAC.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Visibly Intoxicated\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend that the trial court erred in failing to adopt their requested\r\n  instruction to the jury that &quot;[b]efore you can find the defendant liable,\r\n  the plaintiff must prove that Hoyt Helton was visibly intoxicated.&quot;Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  noted above, the court of appeals established in Daley that a third\r\n  party injured by the actions of an intoxicated person served in violation of\r\n  the earlier version of section 61-4-580 may pursue a civil action against the\r\n  vendor.Â  Daley, 303 S.C. at 84, 399 S.E.2d at 14.Â  Section 61-4-580\r\n  prohibits the holder of a permit authorizing the sale of beer or wine from\r\n  knowingly selling beer or wine to an intoxicated person.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  61-4-580 (2009).Â  The statute does not contain a requirement that the\r\n  intoxicated person be visibly intoxicated, only that a person\r\n  &quot;knowingly&quot; sell beer or wine to an intoxicated person.Â \r\n  Consequently, the trial court's refusal to adopt Appellants' proposed\r\n  instruction was not error. \r\nAppellants\r\n  would have this Court adopt a new standard allowing for liability only where\r\n  the intoxicated person is visibly intoxicated.Â  We see no reason to adopt\r\n  Appellants' proposal.Â  Though the present case focused on the visible symptoms\r\n  exhibited by Helton while at The Getaway, other cases under section 61-4-580\r\n  might concern knowledge acquired through a different medium.[2]Â Â Â Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; &quot;Should have\r\n  known&quot;\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that Respondents may\r\n  meet their burden of proof by showing that Appellants' employees served alcohol\r\n  to a person they &quot;should have known&quot; was intoxicated.Â  The trial\r\n  court's instruction to the jury included, &quot;The plaintiff has to prove under\r\n  the statute . . . that businesses that sold the alcohol knew or should have\r\n  known he was intoxicated.&quot;Â  Appellants argue that this instruction lessened\r\n  the proof required under the law and was rejected by the court of appeals in Daley.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn Daley,\r\n  the plaintiff in a suit under the predecessor to section 61-4-580 argued that\r\n  the trial court erred in denying her requested charge that her burden was to\r\n  prove that the defendants &quot;knew or should have known that the patron was\r\n  in an intoxicated condition at the time he or she was served.&quot;Â  Daley,\r\n  303 S.C. at 85, 399 S.E.2d at 15.Â  The court of appeals found no error in the\r\n  trial court's decision denying the requested charge, but allowed that the\r\n  plaintiff would have been entitled to an instruction as to a &quot;reasonable\r\n  person&quot; standard.Â  Id. at 86-87, 399 S.E.2d at 15-16. Â The proper standard,\r\n  as stated by the court of appeals is &quot;whether the bartenders negligently\r\n  served alcoholic beverages to a person who, by his appearance or otherwise,\r\n  would lead a prudent man to believe that person was intoxicated.&quot;Â  Id. at 87, 399 S.E.2d at 16.Â  In our view, &quot;knew or should have known&quot; is\r\n  an articulation of an objective &quot;reasonable person&quot; standard.Â  We see\r\n  no difference between the &quot;reasonable person&quot; and &quot;should have\r\n  known&quot; standards.Â  Moreover, this instruction did not lessen the proof\r\n  required under our law.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in instructing\r\n  &quot;knew or should have known.&quot; Â Â \r\nVI.&nbsp; Piercing the Corporate Veil\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue that Respondents failed to prove the fundamental unfairness in\r\n  recognizing the corporate entity. Â We disagree. \r\nWe\r\n  affirm the trial court's decision allowing Respondents to pierce the corporate\r\n  veil pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: Sturkie\r\n    v. Sifly, 280 S.C. 453, 457-58, 313 S.E.2d 316, 318&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984)\r\n  (The second part of the two-pronged test used to determine whether a corporate\r\n  entity should be disregarded &quot;requires that there be an element of\r\n  injustice or fundamental unfairness if the acts of the corporation be not regarded as the acts of\r\n  the individuals.&quot;); Multimedia Pub. of S.C., Inc. v. Mullins, 314\r\n  S.C. 551, 556, 431 S.E.2d 569, 573&nbsp;(1993) (citation omitted) (&quot;The\r\n  essence of the fairness test is simply that an individual businessman cannot be\r\n  allowed to hide from the normal consequences of carefree entrepreneuring by\r\n  doing so through a corporate shell.&quot;).\r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the aforementioned reasons, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.Â  \r\nWALLER, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I believe the trial court erred in denying\r\n  Appellants' motion for a directed verdict and, even assuming the motion was\r\n  properly denied, erred in charging the jury.Â  Consequently, I would reverse.Â \r\n  \r\n  I.&nbsp; Directed Verdict\r\n  To meet his burden\r\n    of proof, Respondent was required to show that the employees of The Getaway\r\n    &quot;knowingly&quot; sold alcohol to an intoxicated person.Â  In my view,\r\n    Respondent's case was based, not on evidence, but on speculation, and was not\r\n    sufficient to withstand Appellants' motion for a directed verdict.\r\n  \r\n\tRegarding a motion\r\n    for directed verdict, this Court has held:\r\n\tThe\r\n    issue must be submitted to a jury whenever there is material evidence tending\r\n    to establish the issue in the mind of a reasonable juror.Â  However, this rule\r\n    does not authorize submission of speculative, theoretical and hypothetical\r\n    views to the jury.Â  We have repeatedly recognized that when only one reasonable\r\n    inference can be deduced from the evidence, the question becomes one of law for\r\n    the court.Â  A corollary of this rule is that verdicts may not be permitted to\r\n    rest upon surmise, conjecture or speculation.\r\n\r\n  Hanrahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 149, 485 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1997) (citations\r\n    omitted).\r\n  During\r\n    Respondent's case, Respondent presented the following evidence to demonstrate\r\n    that employees of The Getaway &quot;knowingly&quot; sold alcohol to an\r\n    intoxicated person: Helton had a .212 BAC 50-90 minutes after leaving The\r\n    Getaway, Helton typically sipped his beer, Helton consumed one beer at the\r\n    Carolina Drive-in, and Helton consumed three beers at The Getaway.Â  \r\n  Respondent\r\n    presented no direct evidence showing that Appellants' employees\r\n    &quot;knowingly&quot; served alcohol to an intoxicated person, and instead\r\n    relied on Dr. Brewer's testimony.Â  In fact, the only direct evidence regarding\r\n    Helton's visit to The Getaway presented during the trial was that Helton was\r\n    not exhibiting symptoms of intoxication. \r\n  In\r\n    place of direct evidence, Respondent presented the testimony of Dr. Brewer.Â \r\n    Using retrograde extrapolation, Dr. Brewer opined that a hypothetical man of\r\n    Helton's approximate weight would have been exhibiting outward symptoms of\r\n    intoxication when he was served the third beer at The Getaway.Â  Based on the\r\n    assumption that the hypothetical man consumed three beers at The Getaway, one\r\n    beer at the Carolina Drive-in, and no other alcohol from the time he entered\r\n    the Getaway until the crash, Dr. Brewer concluded that the man would have had\r\n    to have consumed alcohol prior to arriving at The Getaway.Â  Dr. Brewer then\r\n    opined that, based on these assumptions, the man arrived at The Getaway with a\r\n    .10 or .12 BAC.Â  Finally, Dr. Brewer concluded that, under these assumed facts,\r\n    the hypothetical person may have been exhibiting visible symptoms of\r\n    intoxication when he was served the third beer at the Getaway. Â \r\n  Dr.\r\n    Brewer's testimony, based on a hypothetical person of Helton's approximate\r\n    weight, was carefully worded:\r\n  \r\n\t[B]ased\r\n    on my calculations he would certainly have over a .10, a .12 just having that\r\n    first beer, if we're making the assumption that's all he had, was those four\r\n    beers. . . .Â  As he is being given more beer he should be showing\r\n    outward signs of great impairment because his alcohol concentration is going\r\n    up.Â  So, you know, I think that's general, but maybe at first his\r\n    speech may not be that impaired after three or four beers, but with each beer\r\n    he certainly would be becoming more and more impaired.\r\n\r\n  (emphasis\r\n    supplied).\r\n  Given\r\n    the evidence, in order for the jury to find in favor of Respondent, it must\r\n    find (1) that Dr. Brewer's assumption that Helton did not consume any alcohol\r\n    after leaving the Getaway other than one beer at the Carolina Drive-in, was\r\n    true, though Respondent provided no evidence to account for the time between\r\n    Helton leaving the Getaway and arriving at the Carolina Drive-in, which could\r\n    have been more than a half an hour; (2) that the hypothetical man on which Dr.\r\n    Brewer based his testimony accurately reflected how Helton would react to\r\n    alcohol, despite the fact that Helton weighed more than the hypothetical man\r\n    and was an alcoholic; and (3) that Helton did in fact exhibit the outward\r\n    symptoms that Dr. Brewer opined the hypothetical man &quot;should&quot; have\r\n    been exhibiting.\r\n  In\r\n    my view, only by piling inference upon inference could the jury conclude that\r\n    the employees of the Getaway &quot;knowingly&quot; served alcohol to an\r\n    intoxicated person.Â  A plaintiff is not required to present direct evidence in\r\n    order to make a case, but verdicts may not rest on speculation.Â  See Hanrahan,\r\n    326 S.C. at 149, 485 S.E.2d at 908.Â  \r\n  In\r\n    upholding the trial court's decision to deny a directed verdict, the majority\r\n    cites to Daley v. Ward, 303 S.C. 81, 399 S.E.2d 13&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In Daley,\r\n    the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of a directed verdict in a case in\r\n    which no direct evidence was presented to show that the defendant knowingly\r\n    served an intoxicated person.Â  However, Daley presented a much stronger\r\n    set of facts than the instant case.Â  The plaintiff was injured when a driver\r\n    struck his car.Â  The plaintiff and the investigating officer testified that the\r\n    driver was intoxicated immediately after the accident, and the driver agreed.Â \r\n    The driver had left the bar 15-20 minutes before the accident and had spent the\r\n    previous 4-5 hours at the bar drinking nine, twelve-ounce cans of beer.Â  The\r\n    driver did not recall drinking beer at any other bar that evening.\r\n  This,\r\n    in my view, constitutes a much stronger set of facts than the instant case.Â \r\n    Helton visited not one, but three different bars on the night of the accident.Â \r\n    The Getaway was not his last stop and the accident occurred 50-90 minutes after\r\n    Helton left The Getaway.Â  Given these facts, I believe a jury verdict for\r\n    Respondent can only be based on speculation and the trial court erred in\r\n    denying Appellants' motion for directed verdict.\r\n  II.&nbsp; Statutory Inference\r\n  Even\r\n    assuming the judge properly submitted the case to the jury, I believe the trial\r\n    judge erred in instructing the jury that it could consider the statutory\r\n    inference from the driving under the influence (DUI) statute in deciding\r\n    liability.Â  In my view, the inference is not relevant to the question before\r\n    the jury - whether the Appellants' employees knowingly sold alcohol to an intoxicated\r\n    person.\r\n  In Suskey\r\n    v. Loyal Order of Moose Lodge # 86, 325 Pa.Super. 94, 472 A.2d 663 (Pa. 1984), the Superior Court of Pennsylvania upheld a lower courtâ€™s decision not to\r\n    include the instruction regarding whether the driver was â€œunder the influenceâ€\r\n    in a suit against a bar owner for knowingly serving an intoxicated person.Â  The\r\n    court noted that &quot;being 'under the influence' and 'visibly intoxicated'\r\n    relate to different characteristics of ability and control as opposed to\r\n    appearance.&quot;[3]Â  Id. at 99-100, 472 A.2d at 666.Â  I agree with the reasoning of the\r\n    Pennsylvania court.Â  Whatever standard the General Assembly may have chosen to\r\n    set with regard to a personâ€™s ability or inability to lawfully operate a motor\r\n    vehicle, it is not relevant to the question whether a person is intoxicated\r\n    such that the employees knowingly served an intoxicated person.\r\n  Moreover, in my\r\n    view, to apply the criminal inference in a civil matter would run contrary to\r\n    the intent of the General Assembly.Â  The criminal statute, as it existed at the\r\n    time of the accident, provided as follows:\r\n  \r\n\t(b) In\r\n    the criminal prosecution for a violation of [statutes] relating to driving\r\n    a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of them, the\r\n    alcohol concentration at the time of the test, as shown by chemical analysis of\r\n    the person's breath or other body fluids, gives rise to the following:\r\n\t. . . \r\n\t(3) If\r\n    the alcohol concentration was at that time ten one-hundredths of one percent or\r\n    more, it may be inferred that the person was under the influence of alcohol.\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950\r\n    (2003) (emphasis added).\r\n  The express\r\n    language of the statute specifies that the inference applies in a criminal\r\n    prosecution and to apply the inference in a civil case contradicts the\r\n    statute.Â  See Wood v. Brown, 201 S.E.2d 225 (N.C. App. 1973)\r\n    (&quot;By the express language of the statute . . . it applies '(i)n any\r\n    criminal action' . . . .Â  By no sound exercise of statutory construction can we\r\n    take such specific language to authorize the application of the statutory\r\n    presumption in civil actions.&quot;).Â  I note that my position is in accord\r\n    with that of the majority of other jurisdictions that have dealt with this\r\n    issue.Â Â  See 16 A.L.R.3d 748, Â§ 9.\r\n  Furthermore,\r\n    I believe the charge was prejudicial.Â  The instruction as to whether Helton was\r\n    â€œunder the influenceâ€ followed on the heels of the trial courtâ€™s discussion of\r\n    intoxication.Â  Additionally, the trial court failed to adequately distinguish\r\n    between â€œintoxicationâ€ and â€œunder the influence.â€Â  Given that evidence\r\n    established Heltonâ€™s BAC at the time of the accident, and that Dr. Brewer\r\n    opined as to Heltonâ€™s presumed BAC during his time at The Getaway, both of\r\n    which were in excess of the .10 BAC referenced in the charge, I find that the\r\n    instruction prejudiced Appellants.\r\n  In\r\n    my view, the trial court erred in instructing the jury with regard to a\r\n    presumption that a driver is under the influence and Appellants were prejudiced\r\n    by the error.Â  I would therefore reverse.\r\n  For\r\n    the reasons stated above, I would reverse the decision of the trial court.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The trial court granted a directed verdict motion for the defendant South End\r\n  Pub which was affirmed by the court of appeals in Hartfield ex rel.\r\n    Hartfield v.

Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, forÂ  Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\t\t\t\tJason\r\n  Thomas Kellett, of Greenville, pro se.Â Â Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the\r\n  imposition of a definite suspension, indefinite suspension, or disbarment.Â \r\n  Respondent requests that the sanction be imposed retroactively to July 17,\r\n  2009, the date of his interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Kellett, 383\r\n  S.C. 479, 681 S.E.2d 575 (2009).Â Â  Respondent further agrees to enter into a\r\n  restitution agreement within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the Court's\r\n  sanction.Â  In addition, prior to seeking reinstatement, respondent agrees to\r\n  enter into a two year monitoring contract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers (LHL)\r\n  and to complete the South Carolina Bar's Legal Ethics and Practice Program\r\n  Trust Account School and Ethics School.Â  We accept the agreement and disbar\r\n  respondent from the practice of law in this state with conditions as stated at\r\n  the conclusion of this opinion.Â  The disbarment shall be imposed retroactively\r\n  to the date of respondent's interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the\r\n  agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was\r\n  administratively suspended from the practice of law on April 2, 2009, for\r\n  failing to comply with mandatory continuing legal education requirements.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits that, although he ceased practicing law because of his suspension, he\r\n  failed to inform all of his clients of his suspension, did not notify courts or\r\n  opposing counsel with pending litigation of his suspension, and did not take\r\n  reasonable steps to protect each of his clients' interests upon his\r\n  suspension.Â  Â Â Â \r\nWith regard to\r\n  his trust account, respondent admits he failed to comply with the recordkeeping\r\n  provisions of Rule 417, SCACR, by not preparing and/or maintaining ledgers of\r\n  client transactions, an accounting journal or check register, complete copies\r\n  of canceled checks, or records of deposit.Â  In addition, respondent admits he deposited\r\n  personal funds into his trust account, failed to conduct monthly\r\n  reconciliations of the trust account, processed some client transactions using\r\n  his operating account, and failed to designate on his trust and operating\r\n  account checks the purpose and client matter for which they were written.Â  \r\nRespondent was\r\n  placed on interim suspension on July 17, 2009, after failing to comply with a\r\n  disciplinary subpoena.Â  Id.Â  After his suspension, respondent allowed\r\n  his malpractice insurance to lapse.Â  As a result, coverage is not available to the\r\n  complainants for the matters set forth below.Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing his\r\n  interim suspension, respondent did not respond to the Notices of Full\r\n  Investigation in eighteen matters.Â  He did appear pursuant to Rule 19(c), RLDE,\r\n  and gave a statement to ODC.Â  Since that time, respondent has cooperated in the\r\n  disciplinary investigation.Â  \r\nMatter I\r\nIn 2005,\r\n  Client A hired respondent to represent her in a civil case against the City of\r\n  Greenville and the Greenville Police Department.Â  Respondent admits he failed\r\n  to competently and diligently pursue Client A's legal matter and failed to keep\r\n  her adequately informed about the status of her case. \r\nFurther,\r\n  although he did not expect to be repaid, respondent advanced money to Client A\r\n  to provide her with financial assistance while the case was pending.Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent signed an acknowledgement of an irrevocable assignment of\r\n  settlement proceeds to repay Client A's loan from a settlement funding company\r\n  from which Client A had borrowed $2,500.00 (plus $800.00 in fees).Â  In March\r\n  2009, respondent settled Client A's claims for $3,000.00 with her consent.Â \r\n  Instead of processing the settlement check through his trust account,\r\n  respondent cashed the check at the bank.Â  Respondent kept approximately $100.00\r\n  from the settlement as his fee and gave the rest of the cash to Client A.Â \r\n  Respondent acknowledges this method of processing a settlement was improper.Â \r\n  According to the terms of Client A's agreement with the settlement funding\r\n  company, at the time of her settlement, she owed $6,281.56 on the loan.Â \r\n  Respondent admits that he did not pay any portion of the settlement proceeds to\r\n  the settlement funding company on Client A's behalf.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nIn\r\n  December 2007, Client B retained respondent's law firm to represent him in an\r\n  employment-related matter.Â  At the time, respondent's partner accepted the\r\n  case.Â  Later, the partner informed Client B that the matter had been assigned\r\n  to respondent and that respondent would be handling the matter from that point\r\n  forward.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  consulted with Client B and informed him that he would be filing a lawsuit on\r\n  his behalf.Â  Although he spoke with Client B a few times, respondent admits he\r\n  failed to adequately communicate with Client B about his legal matter and\r\n  failed to file the lawsuit or take any meaningful action on behalf of the\r\n  client.Â  As a result, respondent missed the statute of limitations on Client\r\n  B's wrongful termination claims.Â  Respondent's partner has now resumed\r\n  representation of Client B and is pursuing his breach of contract claims\r\n  against his former employer.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nIn 2005, Client\r\n  C retained respondent to represent him in an employment matter.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits he failed to adequately communicate with Client C, to keep him\r\n  reasonably informed about the legal matter, and to diligently pursue Client's\r\n  C's legal matter.Â  Respondent missed the statute of limitations on Client C's\r\n  wrongful termination claim by one day.Â  However, when he subsequently filed a\r\n  suit for breach of contract and other claims, respondent included a cause of\r\n  action for wrongful termination.Â  \r\nA few\r\n  weeks before respondent filed suit, Client C borrowed $2,600.00 (plus $510.00\r\n  in fees) from a settlement funding company.Â  Respondent signed an\r\n  acknowledgment of Client C's assignment of settlement proceeds to the\r\n  settlement funding company.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  settled Client C's claims for $2,000.00 in November 2007.Â  Respondent\r\n  represents the settlement was properly disbursed.Â  Client C disputes this claim\r\n  and states he was unaware of the settlement until after respondent was\r\n  suspended and he hired another attorney to determine the status of his case. Â Respondent\r\n  did not prepare a written settlement statement and did not process the\r\n  settlement through his trust account.Â  Respondent's operating and trust account\r\n  records show no deposit of these funds and no payments on or on behalf of\r\n  Client C.Â  Respondent acknowledges that his failure to maintain adequate\r\n  records of this transaction creates a presumption of misappropriation.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  did not pay any portion of the settlement proceeds to the settlement funding\r\n  company on Client C's behalf.Â  Client C now owes approximately $9,000.00 to the\r\n  settlement funding company.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nIn\r\n  October 2008, Client D retained respondent to represent him in a civil matter\r\n  against his former employer on a contingency basis.Â  The EEOC had dismissed\r\n  Client D's charge of discrimination and issued a Notice of Suit Rights on\r\n  September 29, 2008, giving him ninety days to file suit.Â  Respondent filed suit\r\n  on behalf of Client D on December 30, 2008, but failed to serve the pleadings\r\n  on Client D's employer.Â  Respondent took no further action on Client D's behalf\r\n  and admits he failed to adequately communicate with Client D.Â  Respondent admits\r\n  he falsely stated to Client D that he had served the defendant and/or defense\r\n  counsel with the pleadings.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nMatter V\r\nIn or around\r\n  September 2006, Client E retained respondent to represent her in a Social\r\n  Security disability matter and a domestic matter.Â  Respondent failed to provide\r\n  Client E with an explanation of the fees and costs for the representation and\r\n  did not provide a written fee agreement.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  pursued Client E's Social Security claim and obtained both monthly benefits and\r\n  back payments.Â  The back payments totaled approximately $18,000.00.Â  Respondent\r\n  charged Client E a 50% fee on the back benefits, even though by statute he was\r\n  limited to 25%.Â  Respondent did not process this settlement through his trust\r\n  account.Â  \r\nWith regard to\r\n  the domestic matter, respondent filed a complaint on behalf of Client E in\r\n  April 2007, however, it was administratively dismissed when no action was taken\r\n  within one year of the filing.Â  In June 2008, respondent refiled the\r\n  complaint.Â  The case was continued once for lack of service.Â  In February 2009,\r\n  a hearing was held in which temporary custody was granted to Client E.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Client F in connection with claims arising from an automobile\r\n  accident.Â  Respondent filed a lawsuit within the statute of limitations, but\r\n  failed to timely serve the summons and complaint on the defendant.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits he failed to promptly respond to Client F's telephone calls and to keep\r\n  her adequately informed of the status of her case.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Client G, a minor, in connection with an employment case.Â \r\n  Respondent admits he did not respond to Client G's parents' telephone messages\r\n  and failed to keep them informed about Client G's case.Â  \r\nMatter VIII\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Client H in connection with claims against her employer for\r\n  retaliatory discharge for filing a worker's compensation claim.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits he failed to promptly respond to Client H's telephone messages, failed\r\n  to keep her adequately informed about her case, and failed to file a lawsuit on\r\n  her behalf prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  \r\nMatter IX\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Client I in connection with his Social Security claim.Â  He failed\r\n  to promptly respond to Client I's telephone messages, failed to keep Client I\r\n  adequately informed about his case, and failed to take any meaningful action on\r\n  Client I's behalf.Â  \r\nMatter X\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Client J in claims arising from an automobile accident.Â  In October\r\n  2007, respondent settled with the at-fault party on behalf of Client J for the\r\n  policy limits of $50,000.00.Â  Respondent did not pursue additional coverage\r\n  claims on behalf of his client.Â  Respondent retained $16,784.88 as his fee and for\r\n  reimbursement of costs.Â  Between October 2007 and August 2008, respondent paid\r\n  $9,500.00 to Client J from his trust and operating accounts.Â  Respondent was to\r\n  disburse the remaining amount (approximately $23,715.12) to Client J's medical\r\n  providers, but respondent did not pay the medical providers as agreed.Â  However,\r\n  in April 2009, respondent paid Client J's chiropractor $1,800.00 from his operating\r\n  account.Â  Respondent admits he did not maintain the funds in trust for the\r\n  benefit of Client J and that he misappropriated funds from Client J's\r\n  settlement by using them for office and personal reasons.Â  \r\nMatter XI\r\nRespondent\r\n  agreed to represent Client K in a child support collection action in South\r\n  Carolina. Client K lived in Idaho.Â  Respondent's fee was contingent on recovery\r\n  of back support payments, but the payment agreement was not set forth in\r\n  writing.Â  Respondent acknowledges he failed to adequately communicate with\r\n  Client K regarding her legal matter.Â  Further, when respondent was sanctioned\r\n  $1,200.00 for not complying with discovery, he paid the fine with funds held in\r\n  trust for Client J.Â  \r\nIn February 2008,\r\n  respondent received a settlement on behalf of Client K in the approximate\r\n  amount of $4,500.00.Â  Respondent did not obtain Client K's consent to accept\r\n  the settlement amount in writing.Â  Respondent failed to properly disburse the\r\n  settlement funds obtained for Client K and failed to hold the settlement funds\r\n  in trust for her benefit.Â  Respondent admits he misappropriated Client K's\r\n  settlement proceeds.Â Â Â Â  \r\nMatter XII\r\nRespondent\r\n  agreed to represent Client L in a civil case against his former employer on a\r\n  contingency basis.Â  Respondent failed to take any meaningful action on behalf\r\n  of his client.Â  Further, he misrepresented to Client L that a settlement was\r\n  eminent.Â  \r\nMatter XIII\r\nRespondent\r\n  agreed to represent Client M in a wage claim against his former employer.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to take any meaningful action on behalf of his client and\r\n  misrepresented to his client that he was working on the matter.Â  \r\nMatter XIV\r\nRespondent\r\n  agreed to represent Client N, a minor, in connection with sexual harassment she\r\n  allegedly experienced in the workplace.Â  Respondent failed to take any\r\n  meaningful action in the matter, failed to return Client N's father's telephone\r\n  calls, and failed to keep him and his daughter adequately informed on the\r\n  status of the matter.Â  The statutes of limitation have expired on all potential\r\n  claims.Â  \r\nMatter XV\r\nRespondent\r\n  agreed to represent Client O in connection with a child custody/adoption\r\n  matter.Â  Respondent admits he failed to take any meaningful action on behalf of\r\n  Client O. \r\nMatter XVI\r\nRespondent\r\n  agreed to represent Client P in connection with claims against her employer for\r\n  retaliatory discharge.Â  Respondent did not promptly respond to Client P's\r\n  telephone messages, did not keep Client P adequately informed about the status\r\n  of her case, and failed to file a lawsuit or to resolve Client P's claims prior\r\n  to the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  \r\nMatter XVII\r\nRespondent\r\n  agreed to represent Client Q in connection with claims against his employer for\r\n  retaliatory discharge.Â  Respondent did not promptly respond to Client Q's\r\n  telephone messages, did not keep Client Q adequately informed about the status\r\n  of his case, and failed to file a lawsuit or to resolve Client Q's claims prior\r\n  to the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  \r\nMatter XVIII\r\nRespondent\r\n  accepted representation of Client R in connection with an employment matter.Â \r\n  Respondent admits he did not keep Client R reasonably informed about the\r\n  progress of her legal matter.Â  In particular, respondent filed a lawsuit on behalf\r\n  of Client R, but it was dismissed on summary judgment in 2007.Â  Respondent did\r\n  not inform Client R of this development.Â  Further, he failed to file an appeal\r\n  or take any other action to protect Client R's interests following the\r\n  dismissal of the lawsuit.Â  Even after his administrative suspension, respondent\r\n  continued to assure Client R that her case was moving forward.Â  \r\nMatter XIX\r\nRespondent\r\n  agreed to represent Client S in an age discrimination case.Â  At the time Client\r\n  S consulted with respondent, she had been offered a severance package.Â \r\n  Respondent advised Client S to decline the offer and pursue litigation.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  took no meaningful action on behalf of Client S.Â  He failed to communicate with\r\n  Client S.Â  In addition, respondent failed to preserve Client S's claims prior\r\n  to the expiration of the statute of limitations, and he misrepresented the\r\n  status of the matter to Client S.Â  Client S lost her opportunity to receive the\r\n  severance package.Â Â Â Â  \r\nMatter XX\r\nIn\r\n  October 2007, Client T paid respondent $500.00 to file a mechanic's lien in the\r\n  amount of approximately $10,000.00.Â  Respondent failed to file the lien or take\r\n  other appropriate steps to protect Client T's interests prior to the expiration\r\n  of the statute of limitations.Â  Respondent admits he did not hold the fee\r\n  received from Client T in trust until earned and did not refund the fee.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his\r\n  misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall abide by client's\r\n  decision as to whether to accept settlement offer); Rule 1.3 (lawyer \r\nshall act with reasonable diligence and promptness\r\n    in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about\r\n      the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for\r\n      information); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not charge unreasonable\r\n  fee, lawyer shall communicate basis or rate of fee and expenses, preferably in\r\n  writing, and contingency fee agreement shall be in writing signed by client); Rule\r\n  1.8(e) (lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to client in connection\r\n  with representation); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of clients in the\r\n  lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from the\r\n  lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation,Â  lawyer\r\n  shall take steps to extent reasonably practicable to protect client's\r\n  interests, such as giving reasonable notice to client, surrendering papers and\r\n  property to which client entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee or\r\n  expense that has not been earned or incurred); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make\r\n  reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of\r\n  client); Rule 4.1 (inÂ  course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly\r\n  make false statement of material fact or law to third person); Rule 8.1 (lawyer\r\n  shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for information from\r\n  disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a\r\n  lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct);

when he did, he learned the proposed order\r\n  was lost.Â  Respondent forwarded another proposed order to the solicitor, but\r\n  then, two weeks later, represented Client C at a guilty plea without the\r\n  benefit of an evaluation.Â  Respondent submits that, although he had concerns\r\n  about Client C's mental health, he is certain Client C would have been found\r\n  competent to stand trial.Â  \r\nDuring the course of ODC's investigation,\r\n  respondent replied to a request for additional information only after receiving\r\n  a reminder letter.Â  Respondent acknowledges his untimely response violated the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent was appointed to represent\r\n  Client D on four counts of armed robbery.Â  During a meeting at the jail, Client\r\n  D asked respondent to pursue a bond reduction.Â  Respondent sought the hearing\r\n  as requested, but did not inform his client of his efforts and did not respond\r\n  to his client's letter asking about a bond reduction hearing.Â  \r\nApproximately four months later, Client D\r\n  telephoned respondent and inquired about a bond reduction hearing.Â  At that\r\n  time, respondent advised him that there were no grounds to seek a reduction of\r\n  his bond.Â  \r\nDuring the course of its investigation, ODC requested respondent provide additional information.Â  Respondent responded\r\n  to this request only after receiving a reminder letter from ODC.Â  Respondent\r\n  acknowledges his untimely response violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent represented Client E on one\r\n  count of murder.Â  Client E was denied a bond.Â  During the next six months\r\n  period, Client E was transferred to a neighboring jail at his own request and\r\n  he sent respondent three letters which went unanswered.Â  Respondent's only\r\n  communication with Client E after the bond hearing was when he sent an\r\n  investigator to instruct Client E to stop contacting the media.Â Â  Respondent\r\n  was relieved on his own motion. \r\nRespondent acknowledges his past office\r\n  management practices contributed to the allegations admitted in the Agreement\r\n  for Discipline by Consent.Â  He asserts he has worked hard to improve the timeliness\r\n  of his responses to ODC; ODC acknowledges that, during the course of its\r\n  investigation, respondent's responses became timelier.Â  Respondent also submits\r\n  his office has adopted practices, procedures, and systems which he believes\r\n  have improved his responsiveness to clients and his ability to manage his\r\n  caseload.Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits\r\n  that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable\r\n  diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4(a)(3) (lawyer shall\r\n  keep client reasonably informed about status of matter); Rule 1.4(a)(4) (lawyer\r\n  shall promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); and Rule\r\n  8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand from\r\n  disciplinary authority).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct\r\n  constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\n  discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule\r\n  7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully fail to\r\n  respond to lawful demand from disciplinary authority).Â Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion,\r\n  respondent shall pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of\r\n  this matter by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct. \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26839","title":"In the Matter of Douglas Francis Gay","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26839","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court publicly reprimanded a lawyer.","date":"2010-07-26","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of Douglas Francis\r\n      Gay, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26839\r\nSubmitted June 8, 2010 - July 26, 2010Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Sabrina C.

Â Respondent agrees he made this\r\n  statement and explains that his file does not reflect receipt of the judgment\r\n  or execution against the property, though he does not dispute both documents were\r\n  mailed to him.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits\r\n  that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with\r\n  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); and Rule 1.4(a)(3)\r\n  (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of matter).Â  Respondent\r\n  acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the\r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion,\r\n  respondent shall pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of\r\n  this matter by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct. \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26840","title":"In the Matter of Sherry Bingley Crummey","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26840","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court disbarred a lawyer.","date":"2010-07-26","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of Sherry Bingley Crummey,Â Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26840\r\nSubmitted June 8, 2010 - Filed July 26,\r\n  2010\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.

Gibbs, Jr., of Gibbs and Holmes, of Charleston, forÂ \r\n  respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office\r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement,\r\n  respondent admits misconduct and consents to disbarment pursuant to Rule 7(b),\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In addition, respondent agrees to pay full restitution\r\n  to clients, banks, and other persons and entities, including the Lawyers' Fund\r\n  for Client Protection, who have incurred losses as a result of her misconduct\r\n  and to reimburse the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) and ODC for\r\n  costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter.Â  We accept\r\n  the agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  Further,\r\n  respondent shall pay full restitution to all clients, banks, and other persons\r\n  and entities, including the Lawyers' Fund, who have incurred losses as a result\r\n  of her misconduct and reimburse the Commission and ODC for costs incurred in\r\n  this matter.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent\r\n  received checks and money orders from clients for payments to the clients'\r\n  mortgage lender.Â  Respondent accepted the checks and money orders payable to\r\n  the lender and deposited some of the checks and money orders into her trust\r\n  accounts and operating account.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  admits she failed to make the mortgage payments for the clients, used the\r\n  checks and money orders entrusted to her for purposes other than payment of the\r\n  clients' mortgage, made material misrepresentations to the court at the\r\n  foreclosure hearing regarding her clients' home, and that her failure to make\r\n  her clients' mortgage payments resulted in the clients' home being sold at\r\n  foreclosure.Â Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  acknowledges she failed to communicate with her clients regarding the\r\n  foreclosure action.Â  Respondent's clients only learned that their home was sold\r\n  at the foreclosure sale when approached by the lender's real estate agent. Due\r\n  to respondent's misconduct, her clients had to obtain new counsel in an effort\r\n  to save their home.[1]\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits she failed to safeguard her clients' funds.Â  Further, she admits she wrote\r\n  checks from her trust accounts for expenses such as employee payroll, her\r\n  children's school programs, parking tickets, and restaurant charges.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  acknowledges her trust accounts have carried a negative balance and that she\r\n  had trust account checks returned for insufficient funds.Â  She admits she did\r\n  not reconcile her trust accounts, did not keep individual client ledgers, and\r\n  did not retain the bank statements for her trust accounts, all of which are required\r\n  by Rule 417, SCACR.Â  In addition, she admits her records are in such disarray\r\n  that the trust accounts cannot be reconciled.Â  Respondent agrees she failed to\r\n  cooperate with ODC as she failed to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation\r\n  in this matter.[2]Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits she failed to communicate with her client in this matter regarding a\r\n  probate case.Â  Respondent settled the probate matter and funds in the amount of\r\n  $6,538.90 were to be refunded to the client.Â  Respondent admits she failed to\r\n  remit the funds to her client.\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that her client filed an action against her in summary court and was\r\n  awarded a judgment.Â  The client filed a claim with the Lawyer's Fund and was\r\n  awarded $5,788.90.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  acknowledges the client's funds are not in her trust accounts.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits she failed to cooperate with ODC in that she did not respond to the\r\n  Notice of Full Investigation in this matter.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nClients\r\n  retained respondent to represent them in a civil matter.Â  Respondent admits she\r\n  failed to diligently and competently represent the clients, failed to\r\n  communicate adequately, failed to return telephone calls in a timely manner,\r\n  failed to advise the clients regarding court appearances, and failed to give\r\n  them timely notice of hearings.Â  In addition, respondent did not make timely\r\n  court appearances on behalf of clients and failed to produce discovery requests\r\n  to opposing counsel.Â  Respondent admits her misconduct in the civil action\r\n  caused delays in the prosecution of the case.Â  Respondent further admits that\r\n  she did not cooperate with ODC as she failed to respond to the Supplemental\r\n  Notice of Full Investigation in this matter.Â Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that, as of July 2009, she had three fraudulent check charges which had\r\n  been pending in Summary Court since June 2003.Â  Respondent agrees she failed to\r\n  timely resolve these charges, but asserts the charges have now been dismissed\r\n  and expunged.Â Â Â  Â \r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent was appointed by the Charleston County Probate Court\r\n  as Special Administrator to handle the Estate of Doe.Â  Respondent admits she\r\n  informed Doe's family that the estate would disburse funds to the family in\r\n  October 2008 and that she informed the family in writing as to the amount of\r\n  the disbursement.Â  Respondent admits none of the family has received any\r\n  disbursements from the estate and that she does not have the funds to disburse\r\n  to the family.Â  Further, respondent concedes she does not have records that\r\n  would account for the funds of the estate.Â  Respondent admits she failed to\r\n  cooperate with ODC in that she did not respond to the Supplemental Notice of\r\n  Full Investigation in this matter.\r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits she drafted a will for Client A naming herself as Personal\r\n  Representative and Trustee of his trust.Â  Respondent admits she did not have\r\n  Client A seek the advice of other counsel prior to naming herself Personal\r\n  Representative and Trustee.Â  Further, respondent admits she had her family\r\n  members witness both the will and trust and a member of her family served as the\r\n  notary for the execution of the will and trust.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  agrees that, as Trustee, she was to make payments to maintain Client A's\r\n  residence and for the benefit of his spouse.Â  She admits she did not make the\r\n  payments to maintain the residence or support the spouse.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  admits she has taken funds belonging to the trust and converted those funds to\r\n  her use.Â  Respondent acknowledges the Probate Court ordered that she be\r\n  replaced as Personal Representative and Trustee.Â  Â Â Respondent agrees she\r\n  failed to make an accounting to the new Personal Representative and to the\r\n  Probate Court and has been held in contempt by the Probate Court for her\r\n  failure to cooperate with the court.Â  Respondent further admits she failed to\r\n  cooperate with ODC as she did not respond to the Supplemental Notice of Full\r\n  Investigation in this matter.Â  Â Â \r\nMatter VII\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits she failed to pay a court reporter for a deposition transcript that was\r\n  originally invoiced on October 20, 2008, in the amount of $359.25.Â  She failed\r\n  to pay the same court reporter for a deposition transcript that was originally\r\n  invoiced on June 4, 2009, in the amount of $265.50.Â  Respondent failed to\r\n  cooperate with ODC in that she failed to respond to the Supplemental Notice of\r\n  Full Investigation in this matter.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by\r\n  her misconduct, she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer \r\nshall act with reasonable diligence and promptness\r\n    in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about\r\n      the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for\r\n      information); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of clients\r\n  in the lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from\r\n  the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to\r\n  expedite litigation consistent with the interests of client); Rule 3.3 (lawyer\r\n  shall not knowingly make false statement of fact to tribunal); Rule 4.1 (in\r\n  representing client, lawyer shall not knowingly make false statement of fact to\r\n  third person); Rule 4.4 (in representing client, lawyer shall not use means\r\n  that have no substantial purpose other than to burden third party); Rule 8.1\r\n  (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for information\r\n  from disciplinary counsel); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a\r\n  lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty,\r\n  fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice).Â  In addition, respondent admits she violated the\r\n  financial recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  respondent admits her misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE,\r\n  of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\n  discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct) and 7(a)(5) (it\r\n  shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to\r\n  pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal\r\n  profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice\r\n  law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  Further,\r\n  we order respondent to pay full\r\n  restitution to all clients, banks, and other persons and entities, including\r\n  the Lawyersâ€™ Fund, who have incurred losses as a result of her misconduct and\r\n  to reimburse the Commission and ODC for costs incurred in this matter.Â  Within\r\n  thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, the Commission and respondent\r\n  shall enter into a restitution

Few, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26841\r\nSubmitted March 17, 2010 - Filed July 26,\r\n  2010Â Â  \r\nDISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAppellate\r\n  Defender Robert M. Pachak, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Mark R.\r\n  Farthing, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Scarlett Anne Wilson, of Charleston, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner\r\n  was convicted of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\n  violent crime and received consecutive sentences of life and five years.Â  He\r\n  had no direct appeal,[1] and following an evidentiary hearing on his post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\n  application, the PCR judge found petitioner was entitled to a belated direct\r\n  appeal.Â  See White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 108 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â \r\n  PCR counsel neglected to timely appeal this PCR order, and this Court issued a\r\n  writ of certiorari in our original jurisdiction to review this PCR order.Â  Since\r\n  we find no merit to the direct appeal, we dismiss the writ of certiorari.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner\r\n  and the victim were married for less than a year when she left him.Â  There was\r\n  evidence that petitioner's wife was afraid of him.Â  Two days after moving out\r\n  of the home they shared, the victim was shot dead.Â  She was inside a club when\r\n  shots were fired, and then patrons, including the victim, ran into the street.Â \r\n  Several witnesses testified they observed a man with a gun in the club, and\r\n  then saw him shoot the victim in the back once they were outside the club.Â \r\n  These witnesses were unable to identify petitioner as the armed shooter.Â \r\n  Another witness, Terrance Smalls, was inside the club, and did identify\r\n  petitioner as the shooter.Â  A bartender, Harold Wigfall, also identified\r\n  petitioner as the man shooting the gun in the club.Â  Witness Smith observed\r\n  petitioner with the gun in the club, then saw him shoot the victim in the\r\n  street, stand over her where she fell, and shoot her again.Â  Witness Campbell\r\n  also identified petitioner as the shooter, as did witness Washington.Â \r\n  Moreover, other witnesses were able to identify the automobile in which the\r\n  shooter fled the scene.Â  When this car was found, it contained fired cartridges\r\n  matching those found at the scene.Â  The automobile belonged to petitioner.\r\nThe\r\n  State also called as a witness Scennie Murdaugh, an employee of the club where\r\n  the shooting occurred.Â  Murdaugh, who was working that night, testified and\r\n  identified petitioner as the person firing the gun.Â  The trial judge refused to\r\n  allow petitioner to attempt to impeach Murdaugh with nine alleged incidents of\r\n  preparing false tax returns, holding these alleged prior bad acts were not\r\n  probative of Murdaugh's credibility under Rule 608(b), SCRE.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the\r\n  trial judge err in holding that allegations of preparing false tax returns are\r\n  not probative of a witness's truthfulness?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nUnder Rule\r\n  608(b)(1), a trial judge may allow a witness to be cross-examined about\r\n  &quot;specific instances of [that witness's] conduct&quot; if the trial judge,\r\n  in his discretion, finds these instances probative of the witness's\r\n  credibility.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling lacks\r\n  evidentiary support or where it is controlled by an error of law.Â  E.g., State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000).Â  Here, the trial\r\n  judge committed such an error when he held that preparing false tax returns was\r\n  not conduct probative of Murdaugh's credibility.Â  Compare In re Hamer,\r\n  342 S.C. 437, 537 S.E.2d 552 (2000) (filing false tax returns is a\r\n  &quot;serious crime&quot; adversely reflecting on a judge's honesty and\r\n  trustworthiness).\r\nIn order for this\r\n  Court to reverse petitioner's convictions and sentences, however, we must find\r\n  that the trial court's error prejudiced petitioner.Â  Since Murdaugh was merely\r\n  one of six eye witnesses to identify petitioner as the shooter, there were\r\n  other witnesses whose testimony was consistent with that of the identifying witnesses,\r\n  and physical evidence linked petitioner in the murder, her testimony was merely\r\n  cumulative to other overwhelming evidence of guilt.Â  As such, reversal is not\r\n  warranted here.Â  E.g., State v. Simmons, 384 S.C. 145, 682 S.E.2d\r\n  19 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe writ of\r\n  certiorari is \r\nDISMISSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although a direct appeal was filed, it was dismissed on counsel's motion\r\n  because a post-trial motion was pending in the circuit court.Â  Ultimately, a\r\n  second direct appeal was begun but not perfected due to petitioner's appointed\r\n  counsel's delicts.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26842","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of South Carolina Commission on\r\n  Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Donald\r\n  V. Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  This\r\n  case stems from the death of Walter Sykes, a security guard at the Selectron\r\n  plant in Lexington County.Â  A jury convicted Ron Finklea of murder with various\r\n  aggravating circumstances, and recommended a sentence of death, which the trial\r\n  court imposed.Â  Finklea appeals, seeking a new sentencing.Â  We consider the\r\n  appeal in conjunction with mandatory proportionality review and, finding no\r\n  error, we affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 2003, Angel Peters, a security guard at Selectron, was on duty when Finklea came\r\n  to the plant around 2:00 AM.[1]Â \r\n  He was wearing a jacket with a stripe across it.Â  Peters opened the doors and\r\n  Finklea explained that he needed to use the ATM machine.Â  She told him that it\r\n  was not working, but let Finklea inside.Â  After talking with Peters, Finklea\r\n  left but then came back to the building.Â  Finklea asked Peters questions about\r\n  whether her company was hiring and at one point he followed her into the\r\n  security room to get a phone number and flier.Â  Finklea asked questions about\r\n  security, such as how often Peters watches the cameras and who else was working\r\n  security at night.Â  When another security guard arrived, Finklea departed.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  following day, in the early morning hours of August 2, 2003, a man (Man #1) wearing a jacket with a stripe across it came to the door of the Selectron\r\n  plant.Â  The State argued at trial and the evidence suggests that Finklea was\r\n  Man #1.Â  Walter Sykes was the security guard on duty and, apparently thinking\r\n  Man #1 wanted to use the ATM, opened the door.Â  The events that followed were\r\n  captured on the plant's video system.Â  As Man #1 approached the ATM, Sykes\r\n  entered the security office.Â  Man #1 then followed Sykes into the office and\r\n  moments later emerged and opened the front door to allow a second man (Man #2)\r\n  to enter.Â  Man #2 carried a gasoline can, which he handed to Man #1.Â  Man #1\r\n  entered the office again, then exited and approached the ATM and doused it with\r\n  gasoline.Â  Moments later, Sykes, bleeding from the neck and engulfed in flames,\r\n  ran from the building.Â  Sykes died on the front lawn from burns and gunshot\r\n  wounds to the face and neck.Â  From the video it is apparent that Man #1 is both\r\n  the person who shot Sykes and the person who set him on fire.\r\nFinklea\r\n  was arrested and, days later, attempted to hang himself in his cell.Â  Though he\r\n  survived the attempt, Finklea suffered a brain injury resulting in amnesia and\r\n  claims that he cannot recall the events that occurred the day of the murder.Â  Physicians\r\n  who examined Finklea found evidence of brain damage and determined that he was\r\n  likely not feigning memory loss.\r\nFinklea\r\n  was tried and found guilty of the murder of Sykes with the following\r\n  aggravating circumstances: (1) the murder was committed while in the commission\r\n  of a burglary while armed with a deadly weapon; (2) the murder was committed\r\n  while in the commission of a robbery while armed with a deadly weapon; and (3)\r\n  the murder was committed while in the commission of physical torture.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-3-10; 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(c), (d), and (h) (2003).Â  The jury\r\n  recommended a sentence of death which the trial court imposed.Â  Finklea was\r\n  also found guilty of first-degree arson in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-11-110(A); attempted safecracking in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-11-390; possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime in\r\n  violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490; and criminal conspiracy in violation\r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410.Â  Finklea now raises two issues which he argues entitle\r\n  him to a new capital sentencing proceeding.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in finding Finklea competent to assist in his own defense during the sentencing portion of\r\n  the trial?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in allowing the Solicitor \r\n\t\t\tto ignite an incendiary device during his closing argument in the \r\n\t\t\tsentencing portion of the trial?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tProportionality review\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Competency\r\nDuring\r\n  pre-trial hearings, Finklea's counsel noted that her client's memory loss would\r\n  impact the trial in both the guilt and sentencing phase.Â  The trial court found\r\n  Finklea competent as to both phases of trial and Finklea argues on appeal only\r\n  that the trial court erred in finding him competent to participate in the\r\n  sentencing phase.Â  We find the trial courtâ€™s determination is supported by the\r\n  evidence.\r\nA\r\n  person must be competent to stand trial.Â  See Dusky v. United State  s, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960); Drope v. Missouri, 420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 903, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975).Â  â€œIt has long been accepted that a person whose mental\r\n  condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and\r\n  object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist\r\n  in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.â€ [2]Â  Drope, 420 U.S. at 171, 95 S.Ct. at 903, 43 L.Ed.2d at 112-13.\r\nThe defendant bears the burden of proving his lack of competence\r\n  by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  State v. Weik, 356 S.C. 76, 81, 587\r\n  S.E.2d 683, 685 (2002), citing Dusky.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s ruling will be\r\n  upheld on appeal if supported by the evidence and not against its\r\n  preponderance.Â  Id.\r\nFinklea's\r\n  counsel argued to the trial court that Finklea's amnesia prevented him from\r\n  assisting his counsel at sentencing as he was unable to recall potential\r\n  mitigating facts from the incident:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn any capital case, I think the circumstances of the\r\n  crime are critical when it comes to the penalty phase. . . . [L]et's say that\r\n  based on these facts, [the jury] would have found both Mr. Finklea and [his\r\n  accomplice] guilty no matter who pulled the trigger, certainly when it comes to\r\n  the penalty phase, the circumstances of the crime are, they're central.\r\n\t\r\n\tIf it was something that, you know, he\r\n  startled me and it was just a horrible armed robbery gone bad, that's a lot\r\n  more mitigating than, hey, he could identify me, so I blew him away.Â  I mean,\r\n  that's horribly aggravating.\r\n\r\nCounsel conceded that Finklea\r\n  would likely not succeed in the guilt phase and consequently, mitigation would\r\n  be &quot;dispositive.&quot;Â  Based on her client's amnesia, she argued that he\r\n  was not competent to proceed.Â  Finklea testified prior to the trial and was\r\n  questioned by both counsel and by the court.Â  The trial judge later held a\r\n  hearing regarding Finkleaâ€™s competency and ultimately found Finklea competent\r\n  to stand trial.\r\nWe find the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling is supported by the evidence.Â  Even assuming Finkleaâ€™s amnesia\r\n  is genuine, we decline to find him unable to assist counsel based on an\r\n  inability to recall mitigating facts which may or may not exist.Â  We note that\r\n  Finklea was able to assist his counsel at sentencing in a number of ways,\r\n  including: advising his counsel as to possible character witnesses; advising\r\n  his counsel as to mitigating facts from his life, such as his military service;\r\n  and making a statement to the jury in which he apologized for the crime,\r\n  expressed remorse, and pleaded for his life.Â  Moreover, any potential prejudice\r\n  to Finkleaâ€™s capacity to consult with his counsel due to his inability to\r\n  recall the circumstances of the crime is lessened by the fact that the incident\r\n  was captured on video.Â  See Wilson v. United States, 391 F.2d\r\n  460, 463-64 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (recognizing significance of ability to\r\n  reconstruct evidence of the crime).Â  Finally, we note that a number of\r\n  jurisdictions have found that a defendantâ€™s inability to recall the facts of an\r\n  alleged crime do not render the defendant incapable of assisting his counsel.Â  See A.L.R.3d 544, Â§Â§ 2[a], 4 (2010).\r\nGiven the above, we find that the trial judge's ruling is\r\n  supported by the evidence.Â  We decline to adopt a competency standard for the\r\n  sentencing phase of the trial different from that of the guilt phase.Â  Finklea's\r\n  bare assertion that his amnesia may have deprived him of the ability to present\r\n  mitigating facts from the crime does not suffice to overturn the trial court's\r\n  finding of competency.Â  See State v. Weik, 356 S.C. at 81, 587\r\n  S.E.2d at 685.\r\nII.&nbsp; Closing\r\n  Argument\r\nDuring the State's closing argument in the sentencing portion of\r\n  the trial, the Solicitor held a lighted match-shaped, metal fire-starter before\r\n  the jury as he described Finklea lighting Sykes on fire.Â  Defense counsel\r\n  objected to the use of the fire-starter as overly prejudicial but the trial\r\n  judge overruled the objection, noting that the use was allowed for\r\n  demonstrative purposes.Â  Finklea appeals the trial court's ruling and argues\r\n  that the death sentence must be vacated as a result of the Solicitor's action.Â \r\n  We find that the Solicitor's demonstration was not unduly prejudicial so as to\r\n  warrant a new sentencing.\r\nA trial judge is vested with broad discretion in dealing with the\r\n  range and propriety of closing arguments and ordinarily his rulings on such\r\n  matters will not be disturbed.Â  State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 222,\r\n  641 S.E.2d 873, 881 (2007).Â  The appellant has the burden of showing that any\r\n  alleged error deprived him of a fair trial.Â  Id.Â  The relevant question\r\n  is whether the solicitor's action so infected the trial with unfairness as to\r\n  make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  See id.Â  The\r\n  Court must review the argument in the context of the entire record.Â  Id.\r\nWhile the solicitor should prosecute vigorously, his duty is not\r\n  to convict a defendant but to see justice done.Â  State v. Linder, 276\r\n  S.C. 304, 312, 278 S.E.2d 335, 339 (1981).Â  Consequently, the solicitor's\r\n  closing argument must be carefully tailored so as not to appeal to the personal\r\n  bias of the juror, nor be calculated to arouse his passion or prejudice.Â  Id.\r\nThe Solicitor's closing argument[3] included the following to which Finklea objects:\r\n\r\n\tCan you imagine the horror, the horror of him seeing a\r\n  bullet, the flash of the gun and it coming right into his lip?Â  Can you imagine\r\n  the horror of another shot going through his neck, and somewhere along in there\r\n  he had to be on the floor, you remember Officer Mike Phipps that testified\r\n  right here?Â  He said, under that desk was blood splatter.Â  He had to be below\r\n  the desk.Â  Did he shoot him when they're down, or they're down and then they\r\n  get up and you remember that bloody hand print on the chair.\r\n\tAnd we're just getting started, now comes the real\r\n  thing.Â  Gasoline pouring on another human being and the fire, the fire, the\r\n  burning.Â  When you're cooking sometimes and you touch the stove or the frying\r\n  pan or you reach the in oven and you touch that hot thing or you're grilling, whoo, oh, it hurts, it's painful.Â  It grabs your attention, you probably run to\r\n  the sink, want to put some water on it.Â  Probably the most painful thing that a\r\n  person can do -- \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDefense counsel:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tObjection, Your Honor.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSolicitor Myers:\r\n\t\t\t-- is to be lit on fire.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe Court: \r\n\t\t\tBasis for the objection?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDefense counsel: \r\n\t\t\tSolicitor Myers has just ignited some sort of fire \r\n\t\t\tdevice, appears to be some sort of lighter.Â \r\n  It's extremely large.Â  We believe it's prejudicial.Â  It's meant to prejudice\r\n  the jury, to enflame them.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe Court:\r\n\t\t\tMr. Myers?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSolicitor Myers: \r\n\t\t\tTalking about the circumstances of this crime, Your \r\n\t\t\tHonor, physical torture.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe Court:\r\n\t\t\tThe objection is overruled.&nbsp; The use of these \r\n\t\t\tthings for demonstrative purposes is allowed.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSolicitor Myers:\r\n\t\t\tFor that feeling and you can't get away from it.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tWhat about when you're burning trash and you got a bunch of limbs \r\n\t\t\tand leaves out there and you pour a little gasoline on it and you \r\n\t\t\tthrow a match in there, whoof, the concussion just blows\r\n  you back, sometimes it may singe your eyes.Â  Well, what if it's all over your\r\n  body and you can't get away from it, it's engulfed you?Â  He's going back to the\r\n  ATM machine. Â The last, last moments of a good man's life on fire.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIt is clear the Solicitor was zealous in his closing argument.Â \r\n  However, given the other evidence before the jury regarding the physical\r\n  torture of Sykes, we find the Solicitor's use of the incendiary device was not unduly\r\n  prejudicial.Â  The jury was presented with the surveillance footage showing\r\n  Sykes running from the building while engulfed in flames, Sykes's charred\r\n  uniform, and autopsy photographs.Â  Moreover, as noted, the Solicitor used a gas\r\n  can and gun as props during his argument, neither of which was in evidence,\r\n  just prior to the use of the fire-starter and Finklea does not challenge their\r\n  use on appeal.Â  Given these facts, we find Finklea has not met his burden of\r\n  showing that the trial judge committed reversible error in permitting the\r\n  Solicitor to use the fire-starter as a demonstrative device in his closing.Â  See Northcutt, 372 S.C. at 222, 641 S.E.2d at 881.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Proportionality\r\n  Review\r\nIn accordance with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003), we have\r\n  conducted a proportionality review and find the evidence supports the jury's\r\n  finding of aggravating circumstances and that the death sentence was not the\r\n  result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  after review of other decisions, we find the sentence is neither excessive nor\r\n  disproportionate to sentences imposed under similar situations.Â  See, e.g., State v. Passaro, 350 S.C. 499, 567 S.E.2d 862 (2002) (capital sentence\r\n  upheld where an aggravator was physical torture); State v. Shuler, 344\r\n  S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001) (capital sentence upheld for murder committed\r\n  in course of armed robbery); State v. Huggins, 336 S.C. 200, 519 S.E.2d\r\n  574 (1999) (capital sentence upheld for murder committed in course of armed\r\n  robbery).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court properly determined that Finklea was\r\n  competent to participate in the sentencing phase and that the Solicitor's demonstrations\r\n  during closing argument were not so prejudicial as to warrant new sentencing.Â \r\n  The verdict and sentence of the trial court is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Peters identified Finklea in a photographic lineup and in court.\r\n[2] Finklea incorrectly references Singleton v. State, 313 S.C. 75, 437\r\n  S.E.2d 53, 58 (1993) for the â€œappropriate testâ€ for competency.Â  Singleton considers the question whether a defendant is competent to be executed.Â  The Singleton standard for competency is different from the standard required to stand trial,\r\n  as it requires only that a party â€œunderstand they have been sentenced to death\r\n  for murder and be able to communicate rationally with counsel.â€Â  Id.\r\n[3] The Solicitor also used a gas can and gun, neither of which was in evidence,\r\n  during his closing argument.Â  Though defense counsel made a timely objection to\r\n  the gas can and gun, Finklea does not appeal the trial court's ruling\r\n  permitting the demonstrative use of these objects.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26844","title":"Argoe v.

Walsh, Jr. (Respondent).Â  We affirm.\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nAppellant filed the\r\n  underlying lawsuit against Respondent arising out of his representation of her\r\n  husband, Lewis M. Argoe, Jr. (Husband), and son, G. Lewis Argoe, III (Son).Â \r\n  Although now divorced, Appellant and Husband were experiencing marital\r\n  difficulties at the time Respondent represented Husband and Son.[1]Â  \r\nHusband\r\n  and Son entered into an attorney-client relationship with Respondent, informing\r\n  him that they were seeking his help in protecting Appellant from her own\r\n  irresponsible and erratic behavior.Â  They told Respondent that Appellant was\r\n  acting strangely and had become financially irresponsible.[2]Â Â \r\n  Specifically, Husband and Son informed Respondent that Appellant had taken out\r\n  a loan against a condominium she owned in Beaufort County, South Carolina (the\r\n  Beaufort Property).Â  Appellant told no one about the loan, allowed it to go\r\n  into default, and the Beaufort Property was about to enter foreclosure.Â \r\n  Respondent learned that Son was Appellant's attorney-in-fact pursuant to a\r\n  Durable Power of Attorney executed by Appellant on April, 20, 2004.[3]Â Â \r\n  In order to avoid financial disaster, Respondent assisted Son in the transfer\r\n  of title to the Beaufort Property to a trust for the benefit of Appellant.Â  Son\r\n  was the residual beneficiary to the trust and would receive legal title to the\r\n  Beaufort Property in the event of Appellant's death.Â  Pursuant to Appellant's\r\n  then-existing estate plan, Son was already to receive the property upon her\r\n  death.Â  Thus, the creation of the trust at issue was consistent with the status\r\n  quo.Â Â Â  \r\nAppellant alleges\r\n  that Husband orchestrated the transfer of title to the Beaufort Property and\r\n  her involuntary commitment because he feared she was going to divorce him.Â \r\n  Husband and Son maintain these actions were taken to protect Appellant from\r\n  herself.Â  Respondent understood Husband and Son's motivations to be benevolent\r\n  and there is no evidence in the record to indicate that he had reason to\r\n  believe otherwise.Â  \r\nOn August 15, 2006,\r\n  Appellant filed an action against Respondent in Beaufort County asserting\r\n  various causes of action, including setting aside influenced transactions,\r\n  professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of trust, invasion of\r\n  privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of civil\r\n  rights, conspiracy, conversion, and abuse of process.Â  On June 6, 2007,\r\n  Appellant filed another action in Lexington County arising out of the same\r\n  facts and circumstances, but naming additional defendants.Â  The two lawsuits\r\n  were combined in Lexington County.Â  Respondent filed a motion for summary\r\n  judgment, which was granted by the trial court as to all causes of action. \r\nIssues\r\nAppellant timely filed a notice of appeal and presents\r\n  the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in granting summary \r\n\t\t\tjudgment because it found no legally cognizable duty owed by \r\n\t\t\tRespondent to Appellant?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in granting summary \r\n\t\t\tjudgment as to Appellant's cause of action for intentional \r\n\t\t\tinfliction of emotional distress?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in granting summary \r\n\t\t\tjudgment as to Appellant's cause of action for legal malpractice?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in granting summary \r\n\t\t\tjudgment as to Appellant's cause of action for abuse of process?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in granting summary \r\n\t\t\tjudgment because it found no conflict of interest between Respondent \r\n\t\t\tand Appellant? \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nAppellate courts review the grant of summary judgment\r\n  under the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  Houck v. State Farm\r\n    Fire &amp; Cas. Ins., 366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329 (2005).Â  Summary\r\n  judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and\r\n  it is clear the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist,\r\n  the evidence and all inferences that reasonably can be drawn from the evidence\r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Hansson\r\n    v. Scalise Builders of S.C., 374 S.C. 352, 355, 650 S.E.2d 68, 70 (2007).Â  Â Â \r\nAnalysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Duty\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues she had an attorney-client relationship with Respondent arising out of\r\n  his representation of Son.Â  Therefore, Appellant asserts that the transfer of\r\n  title to the Beaufort County Property without her knowledge breached a duty of\r\n  care Respondent owed to her.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;Generally,\r\n  'an attorney is immune from liability to third persons arising from the\r\n  performance of his professional activities as an attorney on behalf of and with\r\n  the knowledge of his client.'&quot;Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555,\r\n  564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2006) (quoting Garr v. N. Myrtle Beach Realty Co.,\r\n    Inc., 287 S.C. 525, 528, 339 S.E.2d 887, 889 (Ct. App. 1986)).Â  Further, an\r\n  attorney owes no duty to a non-client unless he &quot;breaches some independent\r\n  duty to a third person or acts in his own personal interest, outside the scope\r\n  of his representation of the client.&quot;Â  Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C.\r\n  297, 300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 602 (1995). Â Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  find that Appellant was not Respondent's client and, therefore, was not owed a\r\n  duty of care arising from such a relationship.Â  The April 20, 2004 Durable\r\n  Power of Attorney executed by Appellant unequivocally appointed Son as her\r\n  attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of Appellant &quot;in all matters pertaining\r\n  to [her] care and maintenance.&quot;Â  Specifically, Appellant appointed Son to\r\n  act in her name and gave him broad powers with respect to her estate, including\r\n  the power to convey real estate.[4]Â \r\n  Because Respondent represented Son and not Appellant in the Beaufort Property\r\n  transaction, the only duty of care arising out of that relationship was owed to\r\n  Son.Â  Thus, we agree with the trial court's finding that Respondent did not owe\r\n  a duty of care to Appellant.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Intentional Infliction of\r\n  Emotional Distress\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in granting Respondent's motion for summary\r\n  judgment with respect to Appellant's cause of action for intentional infliction\r\n  of emotional distress.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  order to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff\r\n  must establish: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tThe defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted \r\n\t\t\tsevere emotional distress, or was certain, or substantially certain, \r\n\t\t\tthat such distress would result from his conduct;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tThe conduct was so &quot;extreme and outrageous&quot; so as \r\n\t\t\tto exceed &quot;all possible bounds of decency&quot; and must be regarded as \r\n\t\t\t&quot;atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community;&quot;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tThe action of the defendant caused plaintiff's \r\n\t\t\temotional distress; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff \r\n\t\t\twas &quot;severe&quot; such that &quot;no reasonable man could be expected to \r\n\t\t\tendure it.&quot;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHansson, 374 S.C. at 356, 650 S.E.2d at 71.\r\nThe trial court\r\n  granted Respondent's motion for summary judgment with respect to Appellant's\r\n  cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress because it\r\n  found no evidence in the record to suggest that Respondent's conduct was\r\n  &quot;so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all bounds of decency.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Appellant argues that Respondent's conduct was sufficiently extreme and\r\n  outrageous to survive a summary judgment motion because he owed Appellant a\r\n  duty of care arising out of an attorney-client relationship, thus breaching a\r\n  duty owed to Appellant.Â  Because we find that Appellant was not owed a duty of\r\n  care arising out of an attorney-client relationship with Respondent, this\r\n  argument is without merit.Â  Thus, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary\r\n  judgment as to Appellant's cause of action for intentional infliction of\r\n  emotional distress.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Legal Malpractice\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  that the trial court erred in granting Respondent's motion for summary judgment\r\n  as to the cause of action for legal malpractice.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  plaintiff in a legal malpractice action must establish four elements:\r\n\t1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existence of an\r\n  attorney-client relationship;\r\n\t2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A breach of duty by the attorney;\r\n\t3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage to the client; and\r\n\t4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proximate cause of the plaintiff's\r\n  damages by the breach.\r\n\r\nRydde v. Morris, 381 S.C. 643, 647, 675 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2009) (citing Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Guerard, 322 S.C. 433, 435 n.2,\r\n  472 S.E.2d 612, 613 n.2 (1996)).Â  Appellant cannot satisfy the first element of\r\n  this cause of action because, as discussed above, there is no evidence in the\r\n  record to suggest that an attorney-client relationship existed between\r\n  Respondent and Appellant.Â  Thus, the trial court correctly granted Respondent's\r\n  motion for summary judgment with respect to the cause of action for legal\r\n  malpractice.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Abuse of Process\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment as to her cause of\r\n  action for abuse of process.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  essential elements of abuse of process are an ulterior purpose and a willful\r\n  act in the use of the process not proper in the conduct of the\r\n  proceeding.&quot;Â  Hainer v. Am. Med. Intern., Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 136,\r\n  492 S.E.2d 103, 107 (1997) (citing Huggins v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc.,\r\n  249 S.C. 206, 153 S.E.2d 693 (1967)).Â  The abuse of process tort provides a\r\n  remedy for one damaged by another's perversion of a legal procedure for a\r\n  purpose not intended by the procedure.Â  Food Lion, Inc. v. United Food Commercial\r\n    Worker's Int'l Union, 351 S.C. 65, 69, 567 S.E.2d 251, 253 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nWe\r\n  find no evidence in the record to suggest that Respondent had an &quot;ulterior\r\n  purpose&quot; to his actions, let alone a &quot;willful act in the use of the\r\n  process not proper in the conduct of the proceeding.&quot;Â  Hainer, 328\r\n  S.C. at 136, 492 S.E.2d at 107.Â  In fact, the record indicates the contrary:\r\n  Respondent acted with Appellant's best interests in mind, transferring her\r\n  property to a trust for her benefit so that she might not bring financial harm\r\n  to herself.Â  Thus, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to\r\n  Appellant's cause of action for abuse of process. \r\nV.&nbsp; Conflict of Interest\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because there was\r\n  evidence that Respondent had a conflict of interest with her.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellant's\r\n  argument as to conflict of interest is predicated on the assumption that she\r\n  was Respondent's client for the purposes of the Beaufort Property transaction.Â \r\n  For the aforementioned reasons, no such attorney-client relationship existed,\r\n  thus Appellant's argument is without merit.Â Â Â  \r\nNonetheless,\r\n  Appellant also argues Respondent had a conflict of interest with her arising\r\n  out of an alleged self-gift to Son effectuated by the creation of the trust.Â  The\r\n  logic of this argument is puzzling because even if the creation of the trust\r\n  effectuated a self-gift to Son a conflict of interest between Respondent and\r\n  Appellant could not exist absent the existence of an attorney-client\r\n  relationship.Â  Nonetheless, addressing the argument raised, there is no\r\n  evidence in the record indicating a self-gift to Son was effectuated by the\r\n  creation of the trust.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  responding to Appellant's allegations concerning a self-gift to Son, the dissent\r\n  recognizes &quot;an attorney may be liable to a third party where he conspires\r\n  with a client against a third.&quot;Â  However, the dissent goes too far when it\r\n  states evidence in the record suggests a conspiracy between Respondent and Son\r\n  against Appellant, and this evidence is sufficient to survive a motion for\r\n  summary judgment in this matter.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record indicates Son retained Respondent to represent him in his capacity as\r\n  Appellant's attorney-in-fact for the purpose of protecting Appellant's assets.Â \r\n  Specifically, Son wanted to protect the Beaufort Property from Appellant's\r\n  financial irresponsibility, an action permitted pursuant to Appellant's Durable\r\n  Power of Attorney.Â  The creation of the trust for the benefit of Appellant\r\n  achieved the goal of protecting the Beaufort Property from Appellant's\r\n  irresponsible behavior and there is no evidence in the record to suggest the\r\n  transfer was intended as, or effectively created, a self-gift to Son.Â  The fact\r\n  that Son was the named residuary beneficiary of the trust does not compromise\r\n  the legality of the transfer, or suggest a conspiracy between Son and\r\n  Respondent.Â  As residuary beneficiary, Son did not obtain legal title to the\r\n  property and none of the powers that would accompany such an ownership\r\n  interest.Â  Additionally, naming Son the residuary beneficiary of the trust\r\n  paralleled Appellant's estate plan and such a decision was presumably made\r\n  because it mirrored Appellant's desires for the Beaufort Property.Â  Thus, the\r\n  record does not suggest Son and Respondent engaged in a conspiracy against\r\n  Appellant resulting in a self-gift to Son, but rather indicates that Son and\r\n  Respondent intended to protect Appellant's assets from her infirmities while\r\n  honorably considering her intentions for the property as manifested in her estate\r\n  plan.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the dissent would create a rule that would extend an attorney's liability to\r\n  those in privity with his or her client.Â  We disagree with this general rule\r\n  and vehemently oppose its adoption as it would apply in this situation.Â  The Durable\r\n  Power of Attorney at issue in this case was executed by Appellant so that Son\r\n  could protect her interests from her poor judgment and erratic behavior.Â  This\r\n  type of arrangement is commonplace and serves a good purpose: the protection of\r\n  the infirm from their own infirmities.Â  The fact that an infirm principal of a\r\n  Durable Power of Attorney does not appreciate an action taken by an\r\n  attorney-in-fact pursuant to the power she willfully gave him, as is the case\r\n  here, does not create liability for the attorney facilitating a transaction\r\n  that is called into question.[5]Â \r\n  Recognizing a duty owed to a third-party, even one in privity to an attorney's\r\n  client, would undermine the good and common practice of executing Durable\r\n  Powers of Attorney that are intended to provide the principal protection from\r\n  their own infirmities.\r\nFor\r\n  the aforementioned reasons, we find no conflict of interest existed between\r\n  Respondent and Appellant and that no self-gift was effectuated by the creation\r\n  of the trust.\r\nConclusion\r\nRespondent did not\r\n  owe any duty to Appellant arising out of his representation of Son in the\r\n  Beaufort Property transaction; thus, the trial court's order granting summary\r\n  judgment with respect to all causes of action should be affirmed.Â \r\n  Additionally, no conflict of interest existed between Respondent and\r\n  Appellant.Â  Therefore, the trial court's order is affirmed.Â  \r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, there are\r\n  genuine issues of material fact which preclude summary judgment here.\r\nI agree that,\r\n  generally, where an individual who holds a power of attorney hires an attorney,\r\n  that attorney's client is the attorney-in-fact and not the principal who\r\n  executed the power.Â  E.g., Estate of Keatinge v. Biddle, 789 A.2d\r\n  1271 (Me. 2002).Â  I also agree that, in general, an attorney who acts in good\r\n  faith with the authority of his client is not liable to a third party for the\r\n  performance of his professional services.Â  E.g., Gaar v. North Myrtle\r\n    Beach Realty, Inc., 287 S.C. 525, 339 S.E.2d 887 (Ct. App.1985).Â  However,\r\n  an attorney may be liable to a third party where he conspires with a client\r\n  against that third party, see Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297,\r\n  457 S.E.2d 601 (1995), or where his professional negligence injures a party in\r\n  privity with his client.Â  Garr, supra.\r\nIn other words, I\r\n  largely agree with the majority on the applicable law.Â  Where I disagree,\r\n  however, is with the consequences, at least for the purposes of summary\r\n  judgment, of respondent's advice and assistance to Son to exercise his\r\n  authority as Appellant's attorney-in-fact to transfer title to the Beaufort\r\n  Property from Appellant's name into a trust. Unlike the majority, I am not\r\n  persuaded that, because at the time the property was transferred to the trust,\r\n  Son was also the devisee under Appellant's current will, it can be said that\r\n  this transfer was, as a matter of law, not a self-gift.[6]Â \r\n  Until the transfer of title to the trust, Appellant had the right to dispose of\r\n  the property during her lifetime or to change her testamentary disposition of\r\n  the Beaufort Property.Â  Once the trust was established, however, she could no\r\n  longer dispose of this property during her lifetime or in her will.[7]\r\nIn my opinion, the\r\n  evidence here is sufficient to withstand respondent's motion for summary\r\n  judgment on appellant's claims of legal malpractice and conflict of interest.Â \r\n  I would reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The legal issues presented in\r\n  this case arise out of Respondent's representation of Son.Â  However, Respondent\r\n  also assisted Husband in the filing of an Application for Involuntary Emergency\r\n  Hospitalization for Mental Illness, which caused Appellant to be admitted\r\n  against her will to the South Carolina Department of Mental Health Psychiatric\r\n  Hospital.Â  \r\n[2] In addition to sharing details\r\n  about Appellant's financially irresponsible behavior, Husband and Son told Respondent\r\n  that Appellant claimed to be tormented by demons and witches and had become\r\n  paranoid.\r\n[3] Prior to April 20, 2004, Husband\r\n  was Appellant's attorney-in-fact.Â  Appellant claims she made Son her\r\n  attorney-in-fact because she feared husband would use this power to harm her.Â  \r\n[4] Specifically, by way of the\r\n  April 20, 2004 Durable Power of Attorney, Appellant empowered Son to:\r\n\r\n\t[A]llot,\r\n  assign, buy, care for, collect, contract with respect to, continue any business\r\n  of [hers], convey, convert, endorse, deal with, dispose of, enter into,\r\n  exchange, hold, improve, incorporate any business of [hers], invest, endorse,\r\n  cash, lease, manage, mortgage, grant and exercise options with respect to, take\r\n  possession of, pledge, receive, release, repair, sell, sue for and in general,\r\n  to exercise all the powers in the management of [her] affairs and estate which\r\n  any individual could exercise in the management of similar property owned in\r\n  his own right, upon such terms and conditions as [her] attorney-in-fact may\r\n  seem best, and to execute and deliver any and all instruments and to carry and\r\n  to do any and all acts which [her] attorney-in-fact may deem proper or\r\n  necessary to care for [her] in a manner and to the same degree of comfort to\r\n  which [she] ha[s] become accustomed to living.Â Â  \r\n\r\n[5] To be clear, third-party\r\n  liability in a situation such as this could arise if it is shown that an\r\n  attorney &quot;breaches some independent duty to a third person or acts in his\r\n  own personal interest, outside the scope of his representation of the client.&quot;Â  Onorato, 318 S.C. at 300, 457 S.E.2d at 602.Â  There is no evidence in\r\n  the record to support a claim that Respondent acted in any manner that would\r\n  create liability to third parties, including Appellant.Â  \r\n[6] It appears that the majority and I agree that Son's power\r\n  of attorney did not contain a provision permitting Son to make a gift to\r\n  himself. See e.g. Loftis v. Eck, 288 S.C. 154, 341 S.E.2d\r\n  641 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n[7] It appears that the trust has been dissolved and fee\r\n  simple title to the property returned to Appellant as part of a settlement\r\n  between her and Husband and Son.Â  In my view, while this fact may affect\r\n  Appellant's damages it does not impact Respondent's potential liability.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26845","title":"Fisher v.

Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 82, 650 S.E.2d 465, 469 (2007).Â \r\n  However, this broad scope of review does not require this Court to disregard\r\n  the findings of the family court.Â  See Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C.\r\n  532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in finding that Fisher \r\n\t\t\tovercame the presumption of legitimacy?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in adopting the doctrine \r\n\t\t\tof paternity by estoppel?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tIs the &quot;deeply rooted interest in maintenance of \r\n\t\t\tthe family unit&quot; protected by upholding the presumption of \r\n\t\t\tlegitimacy?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Presumption of legitimacy\r\nThe\r\n  Tuckers argue that the family court erred in finding that Fisher defeated South\r\n  Carolina's common law presumption of legitimacy.Â  In short, the Tuckers contend\r\n  that &quot;even though Mr. Fisher has provided evidence to show doubt and\r\n  suspicion that the child is legitimate, he has not provided the necessary facts\r\n  to overcome the presumption that the child is a legitimate product of Mr. and\r\n  Ms. Tucker's marriage.&quot;Â  We disagree.Â  We find the statutory presumption,\r\n  rather than the common law presumption, controls in the instant case.\r\nIn\r\n  South Carolina, there is a common law presumption that a child born during lawful\r\n  wedlock is a child of the marriage.Â  See Barr's Next of Kin v.\r\n    Cherokee, Inc., 220 S.C. 447, 68 S.E.2d 440 (1951), superseded by\r\n      statute on other grounds as recognized in South Carolina Dep't of Soc.\r\n        Serv. v. Burris, 297 S.C. 537, 539, 377 S.E.2d 578, 579 (1989).Â \r\n  &quot;Where the child is born after lawful wedlock, and after the lapse of the\r\n  usual period of gestation, it should require a very strong state of\r\n    circumstances to overthrow the presumption of legitimacy, such as\r\n  impossibility of access, absolute non-access, ab[a]ndonment, or something\r\n    equally as conclusive.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis added).\r\nDespite\r\n  the common law presumption, the family court found a &quot;rebuttable\r\n  presumption&quot; of Mr. Fisher's paternity was created under S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-956(A)(3) (2007).[1]Â \r\n  The family court further found that Fisher had overcome the common-law\r\n  presumption of legitimacy.Â  Id.Â  We agree with the family court and\r\n  believe the court properly determined paternity.\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-956(A) provided: &quot;[t]he following evidence is admissible\r\n  at a hearing to determine paternity . . . (3) Test results which show a\r\n  statistical probability of paternity.Â  A statistical probability of ninety-five\r\n  percent or higher creates a rebuttable presumption of the putative father's\r\n  paternity.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-956(A)(3) (2007).Â Â Â  At trial, Fisher\r\n  presented the results of a test with the DNA Diagnostic Center showing a\r\n  statistical probability of 99.999% that he was the father of the child.Â \r\n  Consequently, there arose a rebuttable statutory presumption that Fisher is the\r\n  father.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-956(A)(3) (2007).\r\nWe\r\n  find Mr. and Ms. Tucker produced no evidence to rebut this presumption.Â  The\r\n  Tuckers demonstrated only that they were married at the time of Leigha's birth\r\n  and had sexual intercourse during the month of conception.Â  At trial and in\r\n  their brief, they seem to rely on the common-law presumption.Â  However, common\r\n  law rules must yield to statutes enacted by the General Assembly.Â  See Burris,\r\n  297 S.C. at 539, 377 S.E.2d at 579 (holding Lord Mansfield's rule superseded by\r\n  statute specifying parentage as a permissible subject for husband and wife\r\n  testimony).Â  Accordingly, under the facts of this case the statutory presumption\r\n  controls and the Tuckers failed to overcome the presumption.[2]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Tuckers contend that the common law presumption controls despite the statutory\r\n  presumption found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-956(A)(3).Â  They base their argument\r\n  on Burris, and specifically on the Court's holding that the common law\r\n  presumption &quot;is not affected by&quot; another provision of Â§ 20-7-956 -\r\n  subsection (5). Â We find the Court's holding in Burris simply recognizes\r\n  the absence of a conflict between subsection (5) and the common law presumption\r\n  and is therefore not on point.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  even if we were to hold the common law presumption controlled, we are confident\r\n  that Fisher overcame the presumption.Â  Fisher presented evidence of two genetic\r\n  tests, one showing him to have a 99.999% probability of being the child's\r\n  father and the other showing Mr. Tucker to have a 0% probability.Â  Significantly,\r\n  Fisher elicited testimony establishing that Mr. Tucker had undergone a\r\n  vasectomy and used protection while having sexual intercourse during the month\r\n  of conception.Â  These facts are tantamount to a showing of infertility and constitute\r\n  &quot;something equally as conclusive&quot; as the examples, set forth in Burris,\r\n  to overcome the presumption of legitimacy.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the family court properly determined paternity.Â  Mr. Fisher was entitled\r\n  to a rebuttable presumption of paternity under Â§ 20-7-956(A)(3) and the Tuckers\r\n  failed to overcome that presumption.Â  The order of the family court is\r\n  therefore\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This section is now codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-17-60(A)(3) (2010).\r\n[2] We note that the common law presumption may still control in other parental\r\n  rights cases.Â  Under the facts of this case, however, where a person has met\r\n  the requirements of Â§ 20-7-956(A)(3), the rebuttable presumption set forth by\r\n  the General Assembly controls.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Chad Wyman Mead v.
