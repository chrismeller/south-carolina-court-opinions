Rauch Wise, of Greenwood; and Billy J. Garrett, Jr., of The Garrett Law Firm, of Greenwood, for Petitioner.\r\n        Holly C. Walker, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJustice Burnett:Â  The family court issued a civil contempt order against Michael D. Martin (Petitioner) for failure to pay child support pursuant to a California support order.Â  Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration and the family court vacated its order.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner and Debra J. Little divorced in Siskiyou County, California.Â  The California Superior Court issued a divorce decree in 1986, granting custody of the coupleâ€™s daughter to Little and custody of the coupleâ€™s son to Petitioner.Â  The court also issued a child support order (the 1986 California order), requiring Petitioner to pay $303.00 per month for the support of his daughter.Â  Thereafter, Petitioner moved to South Carolina and established his residence in Greenwood County. \r\nIn 1989, Siskiyou County and Little filed a summons and complaint in Greenwood County accompanied by a support petition pursuant to the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-960 to -1170 (1985). Â The petition sought support in the amount of $326.00 per month, as well as medical coverage and arrearages.Â  A copy of the 1986 California order was attached to the petition.Â  \r\nPrior to the hearing, the parties reached an agreement which was incorporated into an order issued by the family court in 1990 (the 1990 South Carolina order).Â  The 1990 South Carolina order required Petitioner to pay $30 per week for support of the coupleâ€™s daughter and $10 per week toward the arrearage.Â  It referred to the prior California order but did not explicitly nullify it.Â  \r\nIn 2003, the family court found Petitioner in civil contempt for failure to pay support under the 1986 California order.Â  Petitioner filed a motion for temporary relief asking the family court to stay prospective child support.Â  South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) argued that Petitioner was responsible for the arrearage under the 1986 California order because that order had not been extinguished by the 1990 South Carolina order.Â  Petitioner argued that the 1990 order modified the 1986 California order.Â  Because that agreement was not appealed, Petitioner argued that the 1990 South Carolina order became the law of the case.Â  Â Â \r\nThe family court vacated its prior civil contempt order and held it did not have legal authority to overrule the final order of another family court judge.Â  The family court determined it would not have issued the civil contempt order had it been aware of the 1990 South Carolina order. \r\nDSS appealed the matter and the Court of Appeals reversed.Â  The Court of Appeals held the family court erroneously determined the 1990 South Carolina order was final and terminated Petitionerâ€™s prospective California support obligations.Â  Applying URESA, the Court of Appeals determined the family court had authority to modify and enforce the 1986 California order based on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-933 (Supp. 2003), which provides the family court has â€œthe right to modify any such decree, judgment, or order for child support as the court considers necessary upon a showing of changed circumstances.â€ \r\nThe Court of Appeals also relied on what is commonly known as the anti-nullification clause found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1110 (1985) (amended 1994): â€œA support order made by a court of this State pursuant to this subarticle does not nullify and is not nullified by â€¦ a support order made by a court of any other state â€¦ unless otherwise specifically provided by the court.â€Â  The Court of Appeals held that the 1986 California order remained independently enforceable in South Carolina because the 1990 South Carolina order did not indicate it was intended to nullify the California order.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding the 1990 South Carolina order did not nullify the 1986 California order? \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this Court has the authority to correct errors of law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this Court to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â  Questions concerning child support are ordinarily committed to the discretion of the family court, whose conclusions will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369&nbsp;(2002); Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003). Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe applicable law governing the case is URESA, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-960 to 1170 (1985).[1]Â  The purpose of URESA is to â€œimprove and extend by reciprocal legislation the enforcement of duties of support.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-965 (1985).Â  Section 20-7-933 (Supp. 2005) gives courts the authority to enforce orders regarding child support and the right to modify support orders upon a showing of changed circumstances.Â  See, e.g., Balestrine v. Jordan, 275 S.C. 442, 443, 272 S.E.2d 438 (1980) (â€œA decree of support may be increased, decreased or terminated due to a change in circumstances â€¦.â€).Â  URESA allows orders issued in other states to be registered and enforced in South Carolina as if issued by a court of this State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1150 &amp; -1155 (1985).Â  URESA remedies â€œare in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-975 (1985).\r\nPetitioner argues the 1990 South Carolina order modified the 1986 California order such that it extinguished his obligations under the prior order.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In Carswell, the Court of Appeals held that a Washington support order remained extant and enforceable when South Carolina support orders recognized but did not specifically nullify the Washington order.Â  SCDSS/Child Support Enforcement v. Carswell, 359 S.C. 425, 430, 597 S.E.2d 859, 861 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  After Carswell moved to South Carolina from Washington, the family court modified the amount of support due under a Washington support order but never explicitly nullified the Washington order. Â Id. at 427, 597 S.E.2d at 860.Â  Thereafter, DSS sought registration and enforcement of the Washington order in South Carolina pursuant to URESA.Â  Id.Â  The family court refused to enforce the Washington order and held that it had been modified by the South Carolina orders such that only one support order continued to exist.Â  Id.Â  Relying on Section 20-7-1110, the anti-nullification provision, the Court of Appeals reversed and held that both the original Washington order and subsequent South Carolina orders remained enforceable.Â  Id. at 429-430, 597 S.E.2d at 861.Â  Because the South Carolina orders merely recognized the Washington order, the orders did not rise to the level of a nullification and the Washington order remained valid and enforceable in South Carolina.Â  Id.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In the instant case, the 1990 South Carolina order referenced the prior California order, but never explicitly nullified it.Â  Like the order in Carswell, the 1990 South Carolina order did not rise to the level of nullification.Â  Therefore, both the 1986 California order and the 1990 South Carolina order are independently enforceable. See also Hamlett, 330 S.C. at 326, 498 S.E.2d at 890-891 (â€œ[A] South Carolina support order continues as an independently enforceable order regardless of its registration and modification in a foreign state unless specifically nullified by the court pursuant to section 20-7-1110 [the anti-nullification clause].â€). Â Â Â Â \r\nPetitioner argues the unappealed order from 1990 became the law of the case and the parties improperly â€œrelitigatedâ€ the 1990 order in 2003.Â  Petitionerâ€™s argument is without merit.Â  The 2003 litigation concerned the 1986 California order which remained independently enforceable because the 1990 South Carolina order did not nullify it.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals.Â  The 1990 South Carolina order did not nullify the 1986 California order.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â In 1994, URESA was replaced by the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-960 to 1170 (Supp. 2005).Â  URESA continues to apply, however, to the enforcement of rights, liabilities, duties, and forfeitures as they stood prior to 1994 under URESA.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc.

Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n___________\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â Â Â  This case involves a constitutional attack on a statute defining the offense of disturbing schools.Â  The family court upheld the statuteâ€™s constitutionality and subsequently adjudicated Appellant delinquent for violating the statute.Â  We affirm in part and vacate in part.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThe State filed a juvenile petition in family court in October 2004 alleging that Amir X. S. (â€œAppellantâ€) violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-420 (2003) by willfully, unlawfully, and unnecessarily interfering with and disturbing the students and teachers at Southside Learning Center in Greenwood County, South Carolina.Â Â Â  \r\nBefore trial, Appellant moved to quash the juvenile petition claiming that Â§ 16-17-420 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.Â  Section 16-17-420 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  It shall be unlawful:Â  (1) For any person wilfully or unnecessarily (a) to interfere with or to disturb in any way or in any place the students or teachers of any school or college in this State, (b) to loiter about such school or college premises or (c) to act in an obnoxious manner thereon . . . .â€Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-420(1).\r\nAt the hearing on Appellantâ€™s motion to quash, the State argued Appellant lacked standing to challenge the statuteâ€™s constitutionality because Appellantâ€™s conduct plainly fell under its terms.Â  The family court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and denied Appellantâ€™s motion.Â  After hearing testimony from each party, the family court found there was sufficient evidence to adjudicate Appellant delinquent for the violation of Â§ 16-17-420.Â  The family court committed Appellant to ninety days in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice and imposed one year of probation. \r\nAppellant filed this appeal pursuant to Rule 203, SCACR[1] and raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Is &sect; 16-17-420 unconstitutional because it is overly broad and punishes a substantial amount of protected free speech in relation to the statute&rsquo;s plainly legitimate sweep?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Does Appellant have standing to challenge &sect; 16-17-420 on grounds of vagueness; and if so, is the statute unconstitutional because it is written in terms so vague that a person of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp;Overbreadth\r\nAppellant argues that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-420 is unconstitutional because it is overly broad and punishes a substantial amount of protected free speech in relation to the statuteâ€™s plainly legitimate sweep.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe First Amendment overbreadth doctrine is an exception to the usual rules regarding the standards for facial challenges.Â  First, because the very existence of overly broad statutes may have such a deterrent effect on constitutionally protected expression, the traditional rule of standing[2] is relaxed for facial[3] overbreadth claims involving First Amendment rights.Â  Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973).Â Â  Â Â Â Under this relaxed rule of standing, the party challenging a statute simply must demonstrate that the statute could cause someone else - anyone else - to refrain from constitutionally protected expression.Â Â  Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 486 (1965). Â Â In further recognition of the threat to First Amendment freedoms, any enforcement of a statute subject to an overbreadth claim is wholly forbidden until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it so as to remove the seeming threat to protected expression.Â  Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 613.Â  These exceptions to the traditional rules of practice have been implemented out of concern that the threat of enforcement of an overly broad law may deter or â€œchillâ€ constitutionally protected speech - especially when the overly broad law imposes criminal sanctions.Â  Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 119 (2003).\r\nIn light of these exceptions to the traditional rules of practice, courts have been â€œsensitive to the risk that the doctrine itself might sweep so broadly that the exception to ordinary standing requirements would swallow the general rule.â€ Â Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Â Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 799 (1984).Â  In developing the overbreadth doctrine, the United States Supreme Court has cautioned: \r\n\r\n  . . . its function, a limited one at the outset, attenuates as the otherwise unprotected behavior that it forbids the State to sanction moves from â€œpure speechâ€ toward conduct[,] and that conduct - even if expressive - falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflect legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct.\r\n\r\nBroadrick, 413 U.S. at 615.Â  \r\nIn an effort to balance these varying interests, courts require that the alleged First Amendment overbreadth must not only be real, but also â€œsubstantialâ€ in order to apply the overbreadth exception in a particular case.Â  Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. at 799-800 (quoting Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 615).Â  Therefore, the doctrine of overbreadth permits a court to wholly invalidate a statute only when the terms are so broad that they punish a substantial amount of protected free speech in relation to the statuteâ€™s otherwise plainly legitimate sweep - until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation narrows it so as to remove the threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression.Â  Hicks, 539 U.S. at 118-119.\r\nTurning to the instant case, we first note that although conduct generally is not protected by the First Amendment, expressive conduct may be.Â  U.S. v. Oâ€™Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968).Â  However, we do not find that Â§ 16-17-420 prohibits the kind of clearly expressive conduct historically subject to overbreadth adjudication in the school context.Â  Notably, in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), the United States Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a school boardâ€™s actions suspending students for wearing black armbands to school in protest of the Vietnam War.Â  In Tinker, the court held that wearing armbands as a â€œsilent, passive expression of opinionâ€ was protected symbolic speech regardless of the popularity of the opinion being expressed.Â  Restricting this type of speech when it was â€œunaccompanied by any disorder or disturbanceâ€ could not be tolerated under the First Amendment.Â  393 U.S. at 508.Â  Prior to that, in Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963), the United States Supreme Court held that breach of the peace convictions for high school and college students peaceably assembling and protesting on public grounds were unconstitutional as violative of the First Amendment.Â  \r\nAn analysis of Â§ 16-17-420 is more appropriately derived from cases analyzing statutes targeting conduct termed â€œdisruptiveâ€ to schools, with no specific prohibition otherwise on First Amendment expressive conduct.Â  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972) is the leading United States Supreme Court decision in that context.Â  In Grayned, the petitioner was convicted under an Illinois antinoise ordinance for his part in a demonstration in front of a school.Â  He subsequently challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance which prohibited â€œany noise or diversion which disturbs or tends to disturb the peace or good order of a schoolâ€ on grounds of vagueness and overbreadth.Â  408 U.S. at 108.Â  Relying on Tinker as its touchstone, the court held that although the statute tended to target expressive conduct, such expressive conduct could be restricted in the school environment if the forbidden conduct â€œmaterially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.â€Â  Id. at 118 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513).Â  The court distinguished the demonstration at issue in Grayned from the wearing of armbands in Tinker primarily on the grounds that the Tinker students â€œneither interrupted school activities nor sought to intrude in the school affairs or the lives of others.â€Â  Id. (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 514).Â  It further noted the limited scope of the ordinance, which it construed to punish only conduct that disrupted normal school activities - a decision necessarily made on a case-by-case basis.Â  Id. at 119.Â  The Grayned court concluded by saying that the cityâ€™s â€œmodest restriction on some peaceful picketing represents a considered and specific legislative judgment that some kinds of expressive activity should be restricted at a particular time and place, here in order to protect the schools.â€Â  Id. at 121.Â  Such a reasonable regulation, it held, was consistent with the First Amendment and therefore the antinoise ordinance was not invalid on its face.Â  Id. at 121.\r\nMore analogous to the case before this Court is McAlpine v. Reese, 305 F. Supp. 136 (1970), in which the federal district court in Michigan upheld the constitutionality of a Michigan ordinance similar to Â§ 16-17-420 against facial attacks of vagueness and overbreadth. The Michigan ordinance at issue provided:Â  \r\n\r\n  No person shall wilfully or maliciously make or assist in making any noise, disturbance, or improper diversion by which the peace, quietude or good order of any public, private, or parochial school is disturbed.Â  \r\n\r\n305 F. Supp. at 138 (citing Detroit Muni. Code, Â§ 39-1-57 (1954)).Â  In McAlpine, the district court observed that the ordinance did not by its terms â€œprohibit any kind of gathering or expression save that which disturbs the quietude of a school.â€Â  Id. at 140.Â  The court noted the â€œfundamental interest to our society . . . [of] the schools and their undisturbed operationâ€ and determined that the only kind of conduct prohibited by the ordinance was not â€œfree speechâ€ but rather â€œfree abuse of others.â€Â  Id. at 141.Â Â  Ultimately, the court rendered the ordinance unsuitable for overbreadth invalidation by concluding that the type of conduct prohibited could â€œnot be tolerated in any ordered society.â€Â  Id.Â  The fact that free speech was intermingled with such conduct did not automatically call for constitutional protection. Id. (quoting Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 564 (1965).Â  At the same time, the McAlpine court, like the Grayned court, was careful in its opinion to distinguish the scope of the Michigan ordinance from other prohibitions on expression that did not involve the disruption of schools, reiterating that the latter would be subject to constitutional protection.Â Â  Id.\r\nSimilarly, in S.H. B. v. State of Florida, 355 So.2d 1176 (Fla. 1977), the Florida Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a statute prohibiting the willful interruption or disturbance of â€œany school.â€Â  Fla. Stat. Â§ 871.01 (1973).Â  The plaintiff, convicted under the statute for behavior that included â€œrunning through the halls of a school in session, disobeying the lawful and reasonable requests of school officials, and repeated loud utterances,â€ claimed the statute was overly broad on its face.Â  S.H.B., 355 So.2d at 1179.Â Â  He asserted that an overbreadth analysis of the statute should be governed by cases defining the constitutional limits of breach of the peace statutes.Â  The Florida court disagreed and held that the statute at issue only prohibited disturbances of lawful assembly (i.e. school gatherings) and therefore was limited in its application in a way that breach of the peace statutes were not.Â  Id. at 1178.Â  The court recognized that school gatherings are â€œfragile by their nature,â€ id., and comparing the school environment to a general public forum, the court noted that in schools, â€œa single individual may cause havoc in a situation in which hundreds of others have sought a common purpose.â€Â  Id.Â  The court emphasized that certain conduct - even if â€œexpressiveâ€ - could disrupt the school environment even where it might not elsewhere.Â  Id.Â  The Florida court, like the Grayned court, condoned a case-by-case approach to weeding out overly broad applications of the statute and held that the statute was constitutional on its face.Â  Id.Â  \r\nApplying these principles to South Carolinaâ€™s disturbing schools statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-420(1), we find that it does not substantially prohibit First Amendment speech.Â  By its terms, the statute does not apply to protected speech.Â  Specifically, the disturbing schools statute does not prohibit spoken words or conduct â€œakin to â€˜pure speech.â€™â€ Â Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508.Â  Nor does the statute broadly regulate conduct like a breach of the peace statute.[4]Â Â  Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 616.Â  Instead, Â§ 16-17-420 criminalizes conduct that â€œdisturbsâ€ or â€œinterferesâ€ with schools, or is â€œobnoxious.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-420(1)(a) and (c).Â  In applying the Tinker distinction between direct restrictions on silent, passive expression of opinion versus restrictions on expression when accompanied by disorder or disturbance of schools, Â§ 16-17-420, like the regulations at issue in McAlpine and S.H.B., clearly applies to the latter.Â  Such conduct is not protected by the First Amendment and accordingly, we hold that Â§ 16-17-420 is not a substantial threat to protected speech requiring overbreadth adjudication.Â  \r\nThe overbreadth doctrine additionally provides that any threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression may be removed by a limiting construction on the challenged statute.Â Â  Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 613.Â  Analyzed from this perspective, Â§ 16-17-420 is limited in its application by its own terms so as to remove any substantial threat to constitutionally protected expression. First, the statute specifically deals with the disturbance of students and teachers in South Carolinaâ€™s schools, and not a disturbance in just any public forum.Â  See S.H.B., 355 So.2d at 1178.Â  Furthermore, it does not explicitly prohibit any type of gathering or expression except those which disturb the learning environment in South Carolinaâ€™s schools.Â  Those who wish to engage in this type of â€œexpressionâ€ are free to either do so elsewhere; or do so in the school environment in a way that does not disturb schools.Â  McAlpine, 309 F. Supp. at 140.Â  Finally, the statute is limited in the type of conduct that may be punished.Â  The disturbance or interference is required to be done â€œwilfullyâ€ or â€œunnecessarily.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-420(1)(a).Â  \r\nTaken to its outermost First Amendment boundaries, Â§ 16-17-420 is most accurately characterized as â€œintertwiningâ€ speech and non-speech elements.Â  Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. at 563; McAlpine, 309 F. Supp at 140.Â  Â Â Appellant argues that this might include constitutionally protected expression, but we find this is not â€œsubstantiallyâ€ so.Â  The proper functioning of schools is â€œa topic of great and fundamental interest to our society.â€Â  McAlpine 309 F. Supp. at 140.Â  Clearly the State has a legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity of its education system.[5]Â  This objective is necessarily achieved in part by classroom discipline.Â  Because the school environment is â€œfragile by [its] nature,â€ it requires a certain level of conduct and cooperation on the part of both the student and the teacher in order to function effectively for all its participants.Â  S.H.B., 355 So.2d at 1178.Â  Any conduct in this context that interferes with the Stateâ€™s legitimate objectives may be prohibited.Â  â€œThe fact that free speech is intermingled with such conduct does not bring with it constitutional protection.â€Â  McAlpine, 309 F. Supp. at 140.Â Â  \r\nAppellant urges this Court to consider a school debate scenario where an individual could be prosecuted under Â§ 16-17-420 for expressing a â€œdisturbingâ€ view, which in turn might implicate other students who openly disagree with that view in a manner deemed â€œobnoxious.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-420(1).Â  The innocent scenario suggested by Appellant is clearly not within the scope of Â§ 16-17-420, nor would this Court construe it that way.Â  Tinker permits the State to enforce its significant interest in its education system by punishing behavior that â€œmaterially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.â€Â  393 U.S. at 506.Â Â  Section 16-17-420 prohibits no more than this.Â  Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has mandated a case-by-case approach to address whatever overbreadth may exist.Â  See Grayned, 408 U.S. at 119-120; Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 615. Â Â See also S.H.B., 355 So.2d at 1178.Â  A case-by-case approach to the enforcement of the statute allows this Court to act accordingly in the unlikely event that a person genuinely exercising his constitutional right to expression - such as the debate team member envisioned by Appellant - becomes a target of Â§ 16-17-420.Â  See S.H.B., 355 So.2d at 1178; McAlpine, 309 F. Supp. at 141.\r\nAny fertile legal imagination can dream up conceivable ways in which enforcement of a statute violates First Amendment rights.Â  Grayned, 408 U.S. at 111, n. 15.Â  However, conceivable overbreadth must be substantial in order to merit overbreadth adjudication.Â  Notwithstanding all other laws of this state, Appellant and others are welcome to express themselves in a way that â€œdisturbsâ€ others in any other public forum without offending Â§ 16-17-420.Â  Because of the stateâ€™s fundamental interest in protecting its schools, Â§ 16-17-420 draws the line on conduct that materially disturbs normal school activity - the very same constitutional line drawn by Tinker and its progeny.Â  We therefore hold that Â§ 16-17-420 does not punish a substantial amount of protected speech, and accordingly, does not warrant overbreadth adjudication.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Vagueness\r\nRespondent contends that Appellant lacks standing to make a facial vagueness challenge to the constitutionality of Â§ 16-17-420.Â Â  We agree.\r\nThe traditional rule of standing for facial attacks on statutes, supra n.3, applies to facial vagueness challenges such as the one before this Court.Â  â€œThe concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the constitutional principle that procedural due process requires fair notice and proper standards for adjudication.â€ State v. Michau, 355 S.C. 73, 76, 583 S.E.2d 756, 758 (2003) (quoting Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 571, 549 S.E.2d 591, 598 (2001)).Â  The constitutional standard for vagueness is whether the law gives fair notice to those persons to whom the law applies. Therefore, â€œone to whose conduct the law clearly applies does not have standing to challenge it for vaguenessâ€ as applied to the conduct of others.Â  Village of Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 495; Michau, 355 S.C. at 77, 583 S.E.2d at 758.\r\nThere can be no doubt that Appellantâ€™s conduct falls within the most narrow application of Â§ 16-17-420.Â  Appellantâ€™s teacher testified to the family court that for a period of over two hours, Appellant behaved in a way that was wilfully disruptive and unnecessary.Â  Appellant paced about the classroom and refused to remain in his desk; cursed to his teacher and other students; and harassed one student with comments about the studentâ€™s mother.Â  For over two hours, Appellantâ€™s teacher patiently attempted to reason with him regarding his classroom behavior, to no avail.Â  Left with no other choice but to remove Appellant from the classroom so that she and the other students could focus on their educational objectives, the teacher asked another staff member to escort Appellant from the room.Â  Appellant, however, did not stop there.Â  Appellant began yelling and cursing, swung a punch at his teacher as he left the classroom, and continued his tirade as he was escorted down the hall.Â  \r\nMoreover, Appellant had prior notice that this type of conduct was prohibited.Â  A juvenile petition from May 2004 charged Appellant for a violation of the very same statute he now alleges is unconstitutionally vague pursuant to an October 2004 juvenile petition.Â  Accordingly, Appellant does not have standing to facially challenge Â§ 16-17-420 on grounds of vagueness.\r\nBecause Appellant does not have standing to challenge Â§ 16-17-420 on grounds of vagueness, we do not address the merits of his argument that the terms of Â§ 16-17-420 are so vague that a person of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.Â  See Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 607 (quoting Connally v. General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926)).Â  The family courtâ€™s ruling that Â§ 16-17-420 is not unconstitutionally vague is vacated.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the family courtâ€™s decision that Â§ 16-17-420 is not unconstitutionally overbroad.Â  Because Appellant does not have standing to challenge Â§ 16-17-420 for vagueness, the family courtâ€™s decision on that matter is vacated.Â  \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] An appeal involving â€œa challenge on state or federal grounds to the constitutionality of a state law . . . Â where the principal issue is one of the constitutionality of the lawâ€ is heard in this Court.Â  Rule 203(d)(1)(A)(ii), SCACR.\r\n[2] The traditional rule of standing for facial attacks provides that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional may not attack the statute on grounds that it might be unconstitutional when applied to other people or situations.Â  United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 52 (1971).\r\n[3] A facial challenge in this context is a claim that the law is incapable of any valid application.Â  Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc. 455 U.S. 489, 494 n. 5 (1982).Â  \r\n[4] Breach of the peace statutes are generally attacked on grounds of overbreadth and vagueness because if not drafted with proper specificity, they have a strong potential for infringement on First Amendment rights in otherwise peaceable assembly.Â  See Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611 (1971); Cox, 379 U.S. 559; Edwards, 372 U.S. 229. However, Grayned and its progeny clearly indicate that the constitutionality of statutes that specifically address a â€œbreach of the peaceâ€ in schools are to be considered in light of the â€œspecial characteristics of the school environment.â€Â  408 U.S. at 116 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506).\r\n[5] The General Assembly originally enacted Â§ 16-17-420(1) in 1919 as a statute to protect schools for â€œwomen and girls.â€ 1919 S.C. Acts 239.Â  The statute was amended in 1968 to apply to â€œanyâ€ school.Â  1968 S.C. Acts 2308.Â  Today Â§ 16-17-420 is part of Title 16, Chapter 17 of the South Carolina Code which is appropriately titled â€œOffenses Against Public Policy.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26220","title":"State v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26220\r\nHeard October 3, 2006 - Filed November 6, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka,Â  and Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia, and Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  This is a death penalty case.Â  Kamell Delshawn Evans (Appellant) was convicted of two counts of murder, two counts of possession of weapon during the commission or the attempt to commit a violent crime, two counts of kidnapping, and first-degree burglary. Â During sentencing, the jury was charged on four aggravating circumstances[1] and three mitigating circumstances.[2]Â  The jury found aggravating circumstances present, and the court imposed a death sentence for both counts of murder.Â  The court also sentenced Appellant to life in prison for the first-degree burglary.[3]Â  This opinion consolidates Appellant's direct appeal and the sentence review required by S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (2003). Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe material facts are undisputed.Â  The victims were the father and brother of the Appellantâ€™s ex-girlfriend.Â  On the night of April 1, 2003, Appellant entered the home of the two victims and held them hostage for 4 Â½ hours.Â  Despite negotiations with local police and pleas for the release of the victims by Appellantâ€™s friends and family, Appellant shot the two victims in the head, killing them.\r\nAppellant admitted shooting both victims and was convicted on all charges.Â  Appellant did not request any statutory mitigators in addition to the three statutory mitigating circumstances submitted to the jury, and he did not object to any of the jury charges during the sentencing phase.\r\nAppellant now seeks a new sentencing proceeding due to the trial judgeâ€™s failure to submit to the jury the statutory mitigating factor provided by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(6): the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.Â Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Is Appellant entitled to a new sentencing proceeding because the trial judge failed to sua sponte charge the jury on a statutory mitigating circumstance?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge should have submitted to the jury the mitigator relating to capacity, without regard to whether Appellant made a specific request for that mitigating circumstance at trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe proper procedure for the submission of statutory mitigating circumstances to the jury in the penalty phase of a capital case is found in State v. Victor, 300 S.C. 220, 224, 387 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1989):\r\n\r\n  Once a trial judge has made an initial determination of which statutory mitigating circumstances are supported by the evidence, the defendant shall be given an opportunity on the record: (1) to waive the submission of those he does not wish considered by the jury; and (2) to request any additional mitigating statutory circumstances supported by the evidence that he wishes submitted to the jury.\r\n\r\nOur recent cases have stated that absent a request by counsel to charge a mitigating circumstance at trial, the issue whether the mitigator should have been charged is not preserved for review.Â  See State v. Humphries, 325 S.C. 28, 36, 479 S.E.2d 52, 57 (1996); State v. Vazquez, 364 S.C. 293, 301, 613 S.E.2d 359, 363 (2005); State v. Bowman, 366 S.C. 485, 494, 623 S.E.2d 378, 383 (2005); and State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. 283, 621 S.E.2d 883, n.3 (2005).\r\nAppellant cites State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990), to support his position.Â  In Caldwell, we held the trial judge erred by failing to charge the mitigating circumstances found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(2), (6), and (7) after evidence was presented of the defendantâ€™s mental disorder, even though these mitigating charges were never requested.Â  \r\nCaldwell, however, does not support Appellantâ€™s position because we reviewed that error in favorem vitae.[4]Â  Caldwell, 300 S.C. at 506, 388 S.E.2d at 823.Â  We abolished the doctrine of in favorem vitae in State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (Toal, J., concurring).Â  In Torrence we stated, â€œa contemporaneous objection is necessary in all trials beginning after the date of this opinion to properly preserve errors for our direct appellate review.â€ Torrence, 305 S.C. at 69, 406 S.E.2d at 328.\r\nTwo post-Torrence cases have held that when the defendant is intoxicated at the time of the capital crime, the trial judge must submit three statutory mitigating circumstances[5] to the jury.Â  See State v. Young, 305 S.C. 380, 409 S.E.2d 352 (1991); State v. Stone, 350 S.C. 442, 567 S.E.2d 244 (2002).Â  Recent cases have cited Stone as holding that a trial judge is required to charge those intoxication mitigators regardless whether they are requested at trial.Â  See, e.g., Bowman, 366 S.C. at 494, 623 S.E.2d at 383 (acknowledging holding of State v. Stone, supra, as requiring trial court to submit mitigating circumstances to jury if there is evidence of intoxication, regardless of whether they are requested); Â Vazquez, 364 S.C. at 301, 613 S.E.2d at 363 (same).Â  \r\nWe never explicitly stated in Young, Stone, or any other intoxication case that statutory mitigating circumstances related to intoxication must be submitted to the jury even if the defendant does not request them.[6]Â  Our intoxication cases have not created an exception to the post-Torrence preservation requirements for challenging jury charges during a capital sentencing proceeding.Â  \r\nAlthough there is some evidence of drinking in the days leading up to the incident, intoxication at the time of murders is not at issue here.Â  Appellant argues that this purported preservation exception in intoxication cases also applies to mitigators stemming from mental disorders.Â  For the reasons previously stated, no such exception exists.\r\nBy failing to make a contemporaneous objection or request for the capacity mitigator, Appellant did not properly preserve this issue for our review.Â  Accordingly, we decline to address whether the evidence supported the submission of the mitigating circumstance of Appellantâ€™s capacity.\r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nThis Court must conduct a proportionality review of Appellantâ€™s death sentence based on the record.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(A) (2003).Â  In conducting the review, we consider similar cases in which the death penalty has been upheld.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(E).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Appellantâ€™s death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the evidence supports the juryâ€™s findings of aggravation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C).Â  Further, in relation to sentences in similar cases, Appellantâ€™s sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to his crime.Â  See Vazquez, supra (involving a double murder committed in the course of robbery); State v. Woomer, 278 S.C. 468, 299 S.E.2d 317 (1982) (involving murder after a hostage situation); State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 577 S.E.2d 438 (2003) (involving a triple murder committed in the course of burglary); and State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000) (involving a double murder committed in the course of burglary).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellantâ€™s claim that the trial judge should have charged the jury on the statutory mitigating circumstance relating to capacity is not preserved for our review.Â  Finally, the punishment was appropriate to the crime.Â  Appellantâ€™s sentence is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The aggravating circumstances were: (1) the murder was committed while in the commission of the crime or act of kidnapping; (2) the murder was committed while in the commission of the crime or act of burglary in the first degree; (3) two or more persons were murdered by the defendant pursuant to one act or one scheme or course of conduct; and (4) the murder was of a law enforcement officer during or because of the performance of his official duties. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(b) and (c), -20(C)(a)(7), and -20(C)(a)(9) (2003).Â  The fourth aggravator applied to only one of the victims, a sheriffâ€™s deputy returning home after his shift ended.\r\n[2] The mitigating circumstances were: (1) the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal conviction involving the use of violence against another person; (2) the murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance; and (3) the age or mentality of the defendant at the time of the crime.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(1), (2), and (7) (2003).\r\n[3] No sentences were imposed for the kidnapping and weapon convictions pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 (2003) and Â§ 16-23-490(A) (2003).\r\n[4] Meaning literally â€œin favor of life,â€ the doctrine of in favorem vitae allowed us to review the entire record on appeal for legal error and to address those errors even when no objection was made at trial.\r\n[5] S.C Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(2): the murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance; (6): the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired; and (7)Â  the age or mentality of the defendant at the time of the crime.\r\n[6] In fact, the trial judge in Stone refused to charge the three statutory mitigating factors associated with intoxication and erroneously informed the jury that intoxication was not a mitigating factor.Â  Stone, 350 S.C. at 449-450, 567 S.E.2d at 248.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Oliver W.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        David Michael Ballenger, of Florence, for respondent.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.[1]Â  The facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nWhile serving as a magistrate for Florence County, respondent obtained cocaine on several occasions from an individual to whom she is distantly related by marriage.Â  Respondent represents she usually paid only $20 for the cocaine (indicating, according to respondent, that the amount purchased on each occasion was small).Â  The cocaine was purchased for respondentâ€™s own use; she did not share the cocaine with anyone else. \r\nCriminal charges against the individual from whom respondent purchased the cocaine were pending during some portion of the period during which respondent purchased the cocaine.Â  The criminal charges were either pending against the individual in Florence County Magistrateâ€™s Court or pending in other courts and related proceedings were conducted in Florence County Magistrateâ€™s Court.Â  \r\nIn mitigation, respondent represents she consumed the cocaine in an effort to cope with a severe illness of a close family member.Â  ODC has no factual basis to contest this representation.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that, on multiple occasions, she used her judicial position to obtain favorable treatment for\r\nother individuals.Â  At least one of these individuals was related to respondent.Â  Â \r\nRespondent was arrested on a charge of misconduct/malfeasance in office.Â  The charge is pending before the Court of General Sessions for Florence County. Â After her arrest, respondent tendered her resignation as magistrate to the Governor.Â  The Governor accepted respondentâ€™s resignation. \r\nLAW\r\nBy her misconduct, respondent admits she has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold the integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high standards of conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 3 (judge shall perform duties of judicial office impartially); Canon 3A (judicial duties take precedence over all of judgeâ€™s other activities); Canon 3B(2) (judge shall be faithful to the law); Canon 3B(5) (judge shall perform judicial duties without bias); Canon 4 (judge shall conduct extra-judicial activities so as to minimize risk of conflict with judicial obligations); Canon 4A(1) (judge shall conduct all extra-judicial activities so that they do not cast reasonable doubt on the judgeâ€™s capacity to act impartially as a judge); Canon 4A(2) (judge shall conduct all extra-judicial activities so they do not demean the judicial office); Canon 4A(3) (judge shall conduct all extra-judicial activities so that they do not interfere with proper performance of judicial duties); and Canon 4D(1)(a) (judge shall not engage in financial dealings that may reasonably be perceived to exploit the judgeâ€™s judicial position).Â  Respondent also admits she has violated Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Oath of Office) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent shall not apply for, seek, or accept any judicial position whatsoever in this State without the prior written authorization of this Court after due service on ODC of any petition seeking the Courtâ€™s authorization.Â  Respondent is hereby reprimanded for her misconduct.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent no longer holds judicial office.Â  A public reprimand is the most severe sanction the Court can impose when a judge no longer holds judicial office.Â  See In re Oâ€™Kelley, 361 S.C. 30, 603 S.E.2d 410 (2004); In re Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26222","title":"Hurst v.

Hurst (Appellant) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of East Coast Hockey League, Inc.; Knoxville Cherokees Hockey, Inc., d/b/a Pee Dee Pride Jockey, and d/b/a Florence Pride Hockey (â€œPrideâ€); Florence City-County Civic Center Commission (â€œCommissionâ€) d/b/a Florence City-County Civic Center (â€œCivic Centerâ€); City of Florence; and County of Florence (collectively referred to as Respondents).Â  We certified the case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant filed this negligence action against Respondents for injuries he sustained while attending a Pride hockey game at the Civic Center on January 11, 2002.Â  During pregame warm-ups, Appellant entered the spectator area at the Civic Center through a curtained concourse entrance behind one of the goals.Â  Appellant was struck in the face by a puck while standing behind the goal.Â  \r\n At the time of the accident, the ice rink at the Civic Center was encircled by dasher boards and a protective Plexiglas wall, which was attached to the top of the dasher boards.Â  Also at that time, the Pride was a member of the East Coast Hockey League, Inc., a professional hockey league.Â  The Pride played home games at the Civic Center under a lease with the Commission.Â  The Civic Center was maintained and operated by the Commission, a governmental entity created by the City of Florence and the County of Florence.Â  \r\n After a hearing on the matter, the circuit court determined the risk of pucks leaving the ice rink and entering the spectator area is well-known, obvious, and inherent to the game of hockey.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Respondents based on the doctrine of primary implied assumption of risk.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment?Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment for Respondents based on the doctrine of primary implied assumption of risk.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo prove negligence, a plaintiff must prove the following elements: (1) a duty owed to the plaintiff by the defendant, (2) a breach of that duty by the defendant, and (3) damages proximately resulting from the breach of duty.Â  Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999). Â The court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty.Â  If there is no duty, then the defendant in a negligence action is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 387, 520 S.E.2d at 149.\r\nâ€œPrimary implied assumption of risk arises when the plaintiff impliedly assumes those risks that are inherent in a particular activity.â€Â  Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Prop. Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 81, 508 S.E.2d 565, 570 (1998) (emphasis in original).[1]Â  The Davenport Court further explained the doctrine as follows:\r\n\r\n  Primary implied assumption of risk is not a true affirmative defense, Â  but instead goes to the initial determination of whether the defendantâ€™s legal duty encompasses the risk encountered by the plaintiff. . . .[T]he Tennessee Supreme Court summarized the doctrine in the following way:Â  \r\n  \r\n    In its primary sense, implied assumption of risk focuses not on the plaintiffâ€™s conduct in assuming the risk, but on the defendantâ€™s general duty of care. . . .Clearly primary implied assumption of risk is but another way of stating the conclusion that a plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case [of negligence] by failing to establish that a duty exists.\r\n  \r\n  [Perez v. McConkey, 872 S.W.2d 897, 902 (Tenn. 1994)].Â  In this sense, primary implied assumption of risk is simply a part of the initial negligence analysis.Â  \r\n\r\n333 S.C. at 81, 508 S.E.2d at 570 (internal citations omitted); see also id. at 81 n.3, 508 S.E.2d at 570 n.3 (finding Gunther v. Charlotte Baseball, Inc., 854 F.Supp. 424 (D.S.C. 1994) implicitly applied primary implied assumption of risk).Â  \r\nThe issue before the Court is whether Respondents owed a duty of care to protect Appellant from flying pucks.Â  We find Gunther instructive because the risk of being injured by a foul ball at a baseball game and the risk of being injured by a flying puck at a hockey game are similar risks.Â  See also Modec v. City of Eveleth, 29 N.W.2d 453, 456 (Minn. 1947) (finding no difference between baseball and hockey when determining liability for injuries sustained from a foul ball or a flying puck); Pestalozzi v. Philadelphia Flyers Ltd., 576 A.2d 72, 74 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1990) (finding no difference between flying balls and flying pucks when determining the risk assumed by the spectators of baseball and hockey games).Â  In Gunther, a spectator who was struck in the face by a foul ball during a baseball game sued the owner of the baseball team and the stadium alleging negligence.Â  854 F.Supp. at 425.Â  The Gunther Court found â€œthe vast majority of jurisdictions recognize this hazard [of being struck by a foul ball] to be a risk that is assumed by the spectators because it remains after due care has been exercised (erecting a screen), and it is not the result of negligence by the ball club.Â  Id. at 428 (citing Anderson v. Kansas City Baseball Club, 231 S.W.2d 170 (Mo. 1950)).Â  The Gunther Court then found the spectator voluntarily assumed the risk of her injuries and granted summary judgment to the owner and the stadium. \r\nUnder the doctrine of implied primary assumption of risk, Respondentsâ€™ duty of care did not encompass the risk involved.Â  The risk of a hockey spectator being struck by a flying puck is inherent to the game of hockey and is also a common, expected, and frequent risk of hockey.Â  See generally Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts Â§ 684 (5th ed. 1984) (â€œ[T]hose who participate or sit as spectators at sports . . . may be taken to assume the known risks of being hurt by . . . hockey pucks. . . .â€).Â  Respondents did not have a duty to protect Appellant, a spectator, from inherent risks of the game of hockey.[2]Â  See also Nemarnik v. Los Angeles Kings Hockey Club, L.P., 127 Cal. Rptr. 2d 10 (Ct. App. 2002) (hockey arena owners and operators, hockey league, and professional ice hockey team did not owe a duty to spectator to eliminate the inherent risk of injury from flying pucks); Modec, 29 N.W.2d at 456-57 (spectator at hockey game assumes risk of injury from inherent risks of game); Ingersoll v. Onondaga Hockey Club Inc., 281 N.Y.S. 505 (Sup. Ct. 1935) (hockey rink operators did not owe a duty to protect a spectator from flying pucks, which is a risk incidental to the activity); Pestalozzi, 576 A.2d at 74-75 (same); Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, Inc., 376 A.2d 329 (R.I. 1977) (spectator at a hockey game assumed risk of injury from flying pucks); see generally W.E. Shipley, Liability for Injury to One Attending Hockey Game or Exhibition, 14 A.L.R.3d 1018 (1967) (collecting cases that involve the issue of whether a hockey arena owner or operator owes a duty to protect hockey spectators from flying pucks). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing analysis, we conclude Appellantâ€™s action fails as a matter of law under primary implied assumption of risk.Â  The circuit court properly granted summary judgment for Respondents.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The Davenport Court also found the adoption of comparative negligence in this state did not affect the doctrine of primary implied assumption of risk.Â  333 S.C. at 87, 508 S.E.2d at 574. \r\n[2]Â  Â The application of the primary implied assumption of risk doctrine to a hockey spectator may not completely absolve hockey arena owners and operators of all duties.Â  See, e.g., Wagner v. Thomas J. Obert Enters., 396 N.W.2d 223 (Minn. 1986) (primary implied assumption of risk did not apply to negligent maintenance and supervision of a skating rink because these are not inherent risks of skating).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26198","title":"Bryant v.

Lindemann, of Davidson, Morrison, and Lindemann, P.A., of Columbia, for Respondent South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n ACTING JUSTICE COLE:Â  In this appeal, we are asked to decide the novel issue of whether a private treatment center owes a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising a mentally retarded person admitted to its care; the novel issue of whether a state agency which has a contract with the center owes a duty of care to the person; and whether the mentally retarded person in this case, as a matter of law, proximately caused her own injuries.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIt is undisputed that Madison[1] (Appellant), now thirty-two years old, is a mentally retarded woman with disabilities and special needs.Â  Babcock Center, Inc. (Babcock Center), its employee Michelle Batchelor, and the South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (Department) in their answers admit Appellant â€œhas been diagnosed as mildly mentally retardedâ€ and is a â€œperson with disabilities and special needs.â€[2]  \r\nAppellant was voluntarily admitted as a client in 1994, when she was twenty years old, to a residential home managed by Babcock Center.Â Â  Babcock Center is a private, non-profit corporation based in Columbia that provides housing and other services for people with autism, mental retardation, head or spinal injuries, or related disabilities.Â  Department has approved Babcock Center as a contractual provider of such services, and the program at issue in this case is the Community Training Home Program II.Â  This residential program offers mentally retarded persons the opportunity to live in the community and receive individualized supervision and support services.Â  Appellant alleges Department coordinates, directs, funds, and oversees the provision of services by contractual providers such as Babcock Center.Â  Appellant further alleges Department, along with its county-based boards, is responsible for performing timely and adequate developmental evaluations of clients and assisting providers in determining the level of care and services required.\r\nAppellant, although physically an adult, alleges she has the emotional and intellectual maturity of a seven- to ten-year-old child.Â  She can read, write, and understand math at the level of a first- or second-grade child.Â  Appellant alleges her mental disability means she is not able to live or work independently.Â  She cannot, for example, cook, wash clothes, run bath water, use a toaster oven, put on her own makeup, or perform personal hygiene tasks without adult supervision. Â Appellant cannot tell time, understand a sequence of dates or use a calendar, make change for a dollar, or give or follow simple geographical directions.Â  Appellant is not allowed to leave either her parentâ€™s home or the Babcock Center home without permission and adult supervision. Â \r\nWhile living at Babcock Center, Appellant worked at an animal shelter and a dump site sorting recyclable materials.Â  Babcock Center personnel took her to and from work, where she was supervised by a job coach.Â  Appellantâ€™s â€œlack of perspective and judgment is so limited that she needs help with every significant decision she makes about even the smallest matters that require assessment of consequences, potential danger, or comparing alternative courses of action,â€ according to Brenda Bryant, Appellantâ€™s mother and court-appointed guardian.\r\nOn August 30, 1995, Appellant, then twenty-one years old, placed her luggage on the front porch of the Babcock Center home and went to bed fully clothed.Â  After everyone was asleep, she secretly slipped out of the house sometime after 1 a.m. and left in a car with two men who either lived or recently had lived in a home managed by Babcock Center.Â  Another woman already was in the car.Â  Appellant believed the four of them planned to go to an unknown location and set up housekeeping on their own.Â  Instead, the other woman was taken home a short while later after an argument.\r\nAppellant and the two men went to a house, where she had sex with one or both of them.Â  Appellant initially told police and her mother she was raped, but testified at a deposition in this case she was â€œtalked into having sex.â€Â  Appellant returned to her Babcock Center home the following morning.Â  Appellant alleges she was a virgin when she was admitted to the Babcock Center home.Â  She contracted herpes simplex type I, a sexually transmitted disease, after one or more sexual encounters with men while staying at the Babcock Center home.Â  \r\nA probate court judge in 1997 issued an order appointing Appellantâ€™s mother as her guardian and conservator.Â  The judge found Appellant was mentally retarded and lacked the capacity to exercise good judgment with regard to her person, assets, and financial affairs.\r\nAppellantâ€™s amended complaint alleges causes of action for negligence, gross negligence, and willful indifference against Respondents.Â  Appellant alleges, among other things, that both Babcock Center and Department owed a duty of care to Appellant, which they breached by failing to exercise sufficient control and supervision over Appellant and other Babcock Center residents.Â  Appellant alleges both entities failed to properly supervise facility staff, both failed to heed the previous warnings of Appellantâ€™s mother about inappropriate sexual contacts between Appellant and current or former male residents of Babcock Center, and both ignored the requests of her parents that she be released from Babcock Center.Â  Appellantâ€™s mother testified that, prior to August 30, 1995, she personally made repeated complaints about the sexual contacts to staff at the Babcock Center home where Appellant lived, Babcock Center director Risley Linder, and James Hill, Departmentâ€™s general counsel.\r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment to Respondents.Â  The judge ruled in two separate orders that, as a matter of law, Respondents â€œhad no legal duty to maintain a constant watch over the plaintiff so as to prevent her surreptitious elopement.â€Â  Furthermore, the proximate cause of any damages suffered by Appellant, as a matter of law, was Appellantâ€™s â€œown voluntary and intentional acts.â€ \r\nAppellant appealed.Â  We certified this case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Babcock Center on the ground it owes no legal duty of care to Appellant, a mentally retarded client voluntarily admitted to its care?\r\nII.Â  Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Department on the ground it owes no legal duty of care to Appellant, a mentally retarded client voluntarily admitted to Â Babcock Center, a contractual provider of services?\r\nIII.Â  Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Respondents on the ground that, as a matter of law, the proximate cause of any injuries and damages suffered by Appellant were the result of her own voluntary and intentional acts? \r\nIV.Â  Did the circuit court err in ruling that certain allegations against Department are time-barred by the statute of limitations?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 365 S.E.2d 24 (1988).Â  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked so that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues.Â  Baughman v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991).\r\nOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court.Â  The appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the appellant, the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001); Williams v. Chesterfield Lumber Co., 267 S.C. 607, 230 S.E.2d 447 (1976).\r\nIn a case raising a novel question of law, the appellate court is free to decide the question with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005), and S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2005)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partnership, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (same).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  DUTY OF CARE OWED BY BABCOCK CENTER\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Babcock Center on the ground it owes no legal duty of care to Appellant, a mentally retarded client voluntarily admitted to the centerâ€™s care.Â  Babcock Center has a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising and providing care and treatment to clients in its custody.Â  We agree.\r\nWe conclude the circuit court erred in accepting Respondentsâ€™ argument that Babcock Center either had a â€œtwenty-four-hour, eyes-onâ€ duty of supervision - i.e., an extremely high and rigorous duty - or no duty at all.Â  The circuit court in its order repeatedly described the purported duty as one of maintaining â€œconstant watchâ€ over Appellant. Â Appellant at the summary judgment hearing contended the duty was one of reasonable supervision, but the circuit court and Respondents appeared overly focused on the â€œhigh dutyâ€ versus â€œno dutyâ€ positions.\r\nRespondentsâ€™ position results in a distorted view of the centerâ€™s duty because, first, it assumes an all-or-nothing approach with regard to the existence of a duty.Â  Cf. Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 493, 575 S.E.2d 549, 553 (2003) (disagreeing with Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion that childrenâ€™s shelter had an enhanced or specific duty to protect child at all times, instead reasoning that under circumstances presented shelter had only a general duty to supervise a child in its care; thus, the defense of assumption of risk was applicable as law then existed).Â  Second, Respondentsâ€™ position confuses the existence of a duty with standards of care establishing the extent and nature of the duty in a particular case, standards by which a fact finder may judge whether a duty was breached.Â  Such standards are grounded in the common law, statutes, regulations, or policies and guidelines promulgated by Babcock Center or Department.\r\nIn a negligence action, a plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff, (2) the defendant breached the duty by a negligent act or omission, (3) the defendantâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury, and (4) the plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.Â  Steinke v. S.C. Dept. of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999);Â  Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc., 269 S.C. 479, 238 S.E.2d 167 (1977).Â  The court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty.Â  If there is no duty, then the defendant in a negligence action is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Steinke 336 S.C. at 387, 520 S.E.2d at 149; Ellis v. Niles, 324 S.C. 223, 227, 479 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1996).\r\nUnder South Carolina common law, there is no general duty to control the conduct of another or to warn a third person or potential victim of danger.Â  We have recognized five exceptions to this rule:Â  (1) where the defendant has a special relationship to the victim; (2) where the defendant has a special relationship to the injurer; (3) where the defendant voluntarily undertakes a duty; (4) where the defendant negligently or intentionally creates the risk; and (5) where a statute imposes a duty on the defendant.Â  Faile v. S.C. Dept. of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 334, 566 S.E.2d 536, 546 (2002) (listing cases and authority supporting each proposition).Â  An affirmative legal duty may be created by statute, a contractual relationship, status, property interest, or some other special circumstance.Â  Jensen v. Anderson County Dept. of Soc. Servs., 304 S.C. 195, 199, 403 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1991); Miller v. City of Camden, 317 S.C. 28, 33-34, 451 S.E.2d 401, 404 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Moreover, it has long been the law that one who assumes to act, even though under no obligation to do so, thereby becomes obligated to act with due care.Â  Sherer v. James, 290 S.C. 404, 406, 351 S.E.2d 148, 150 (1986); Roundtree Villas Assn. v. 4701 Kings Corp., 282 S.C. 415, 423, 321 S.E.2d 46, 50-51 (1984); Miller, 317 S.C. at 33-34, 451 S.E.2d at 404.\r\nâ€œOne who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of the otherâ€™s person or things, is subject to liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if (a) his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of such harm, or (b) the harm is suffered because of the otherâ€™s reliance upon the undertaking.â€Â  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 323 (1965).Â  In addition, â€œ[o]ne who, being under no duty to do so, takes charge of another who is helpless adequately to aid or protect himself is subject to liability to the other for any bodily harm caused to him by (a) the failure of the actor to exercise reasonable care to secure the safety of the other while within the actorâ€™s charge, or (b) the actorâ€™s discontinuing his aid or protection, if by so doing he leaves the other in a worse position than when the actor took charge of him.â€Â  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 324 (1965).\r\nThe present case falls within the first, third, fourth, and fifth exceptions specified in Faile, as well as within the circumstances outlined in Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 323-324.\r\nBabcock Center had a special relationship with Appellant because she was a client with special needs and disabilities admitted for care and treatment at the center.Â  Babcock Center voluntarily undertook the duty of supervising and caring for Appellant as provided in its contractual relationship with Department.Â  Babcock Center allegedly acted negligently in creating the risk of injury to Appellant by not properly supervising her and allowing improper sexual contacts between Appellant and men.Â  Furthermore, the center had a statutory duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising Appellant.Â  See e.g. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-20-30(2), (11), and (17) (2002) (defining client, mental retardation, and residential programs); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-20-710 to -1000 (2002) (addressing licensing of facilities and programs for mentally disabled persons); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-26-10 to -220 (2002) (rights of mental retardation clients).[3]Â  In short, Babcock Center undertook a duty, for consideration, to render services to Appellant which the center should have recognized as necessary for the protection of Appellant.Â  Thus, Babcock Center had a duty to control Appellantâ€™s conduct to the extent necessary to prevent her from harming herself or to prevent others from harming her while staying at the center.\r\nThe fact Appellant was a voluntary admittee is irrelevant in deciding whether she is owed a duty of care.Â  As long as Appellant was living as a client at a Babcock Center home - whether voluntarily or involuntarily - Babcock Center owed a duty of care to her.Â  See e.g. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-20-460 (2002) (â€œperson admitted or committed to the services of the department remains a client and is eligible for services until dischargedâ€); cf. Kolpak v. Bell, 619 F. Supp. 359, 377-79 (D. Ill. 1985) (finding much logic in cases that find voluntary and involuntary residents are entitled to the same constitutional rights to a safe environment in actions brought under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983, and listing cases).Â  â€œThese cases recognize that for all practical purposes, many of the residents of state-run mental\r\ninstitutions are effectively admitted involuntarily: Â they may have been admitted upon the unilateral application of their parents or guardians; they may be incapable of expressing a desire to enter or to leave; they may be involuntarily committed when they apply for discharge; or their financial circumstances may be such that admission, voluntary or involuntary, is a foregone conclusion.â€Â  Id. at 378-79.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that, under the common law, a private person or business entity which accepts the responsibility of providing care, treatment, or services to a mentally retarded or disabled client has a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising the client and providing appropriate care and treatment to the client. Â See Lee v. Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs., 698 So.2d 1194, 1199 (Fla. 1997) (mentally retarded woman who became pregnant while in custody of state agency stated cause of action for negligence against agency employees who allegedly failed to follow agencyâ€™s rules and carry out their assigned duties in supervising patients); Butler v. Circulus, Inc., 557 S.W.2d 469, 475 (Mo. App. 1977) (mentally retarded minor plaintiff who was resident and student at defendantâ€™s licensed institution stated cause of action for negligence against defendant for failing to supervise employees who allegedly physically and mentally abused plaintiff as part of a behavior modification program); Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 323-324; cf. Rogers v. S.C. Dept. of Parole &amp; Comm. Corrections, 320 S.C. 253, 464 S.E.2d 330 (1995) (holding that common law duty to warn arises when a person being released from custody has made a specific threat of harm directed at a specific individual); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 319, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2460, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) (under substantive component of Fourteenth Amendmentâ€™s Due Process Clause, state must provide involuntarily committed mental patients with services necessary to ensure their reasonable safety from themselves and others, as well as freedom from undue restraint); DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 201-02, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1006, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989) (while substantive component of Fourteenth Amendmentâ€™s Due Process Clause did not protect child beaten to death by his father after state agency failed to remove child from home, â€œit may well be that, by voluntarily undertaking to protect Joshua against a danger it concededly played no part in creating, the State acquired a duty under state tort law to provide him with adequate protection against that dangerâ€).[4]\r\nWe further hold that, if Appellant proves at trial she has the limited emotional and intellectual capacity she has demonstrated at the summary judgment stage, Appellant should be treated as the equivalent of a willful, immature child who really has no idea of what is best for her in determining whether Babcock Center breached the duty of care owedÂ  to her.Â  â€œChildren, wherever they go, must be expected to act upon childish instincts and impulses; and others, who are chargeable with a duty of care and caution towards them must calculate upon this and take precautions accordingly.â€Â  Franks v. Southern Cotton Oil Co., 78 S.C. 10, 18, 58 S.E. 960, 962 (1907).\r\nIn Standard v. Shine, 278 S.C. 337, 295 S.E.2d 786 (1982), weÂ  abandoned age-based presumptions previously used in assessing whether an injured childâ€™s own negligence contributed to his injury.Â  â€œThe capacities of children vary greatly, not only with age, but also with individuals of the same age.Â  Therefore, no very definite statement can be made to just what standard is to be applied to them. . . . Â Of course, a child of tender years is not required to conform to an adult standard of care. . . . [A] minorâ€™s conduct should be judged by the standard of behavior to be expected of a child of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances.â€Â  Id. at 339, 295 S.E.2d at 787; accord Jones ex rel. Castor v. Carter, 336 S.C. 110, 117, 518 S.E.2d 619, 622 (Ct. App. 1999); Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 556, 481 S.E.2d 444, 449 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Similarly, the conduct of a mentally retarded or disabled client of a residential home training program should be judged by the behavior to be expected of a person of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances.\r\nThe factfinder may consider relevant standards of care from various sources in determining whether a defendant breached a duty owed to an injured person in a negligence case.Â  The standard of care in a given case may be established and defined by the common law, statutes, administrative regulations, industry standards, or a defendantâ€™s own policies and guidelines.Â  See e.g. Steinke v. S.C. Dept. of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387-89, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149-50 (1999) (affirmative legal duty may be created by statute which establishes the standard of care); Clifford v. Southern Ry. Co., 87 S.C. 324, 69 S.E. 513 (1910) (statute may create special duty of care and breach of that statute may constitute negligence per se); Peterson v. Natl. R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 397, 618 S.E.2d 903, 906 (2005) (although federal regulations provided standard of care, internal policies of company which owned the line of track and railroad which owned the train were not preempted by federal law, and companyâ€™s and railroadâ€™s deviation from own internal policies was admissible as evidence they deviated from standard of care, thus breaching duty owed to plaintiff, in lawsuit brought by plaintiff injured in train derailment); Elledge v. Richland/Lexington School Dist. Five, 352 S.C. 179, 186, 573 S.E.2d 789, 793 (2002) (general rule is that evidence of industry safety standards is relevant to establishing the standard of care in a negligence case); Tidwell v. Columbia Ry., Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 109 S.C. 34, 95 S.E. 109 (1918) (relevant rules of a defendant are admissible in evidence in a personal injury action regardless of whether rules were intended primarily for employee guidance, public safety, or both, because violation of such rules may constitute evidence of a breach of the duty of care and the proximate cause of injury); Caldwell v. K-Mart Corp., 306 S.C. 27, 31-32, 410 S.E.2d 21, 24 (Ct. App. 1991) (when defendant adopts internal policies or self-imposed rules and thereafter violates those policies or rules, jury may consider such violations as evidence of negligence if they proximately caused a plaintiffâ€™s damages); Steeves v. U.S., 294 F. Supp. 446, 455 (D.S.C. 1968) (violation of a rule or regulation which is designed primarily for the safety of hospital patients will constitute negligence if the violation proximately results in the injury); Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 285 (1965) (standards of conduct of reasonable man may be established by statute, regulation, courtâ€™s interpretation of statute or regulation, judicial decision, or as determined by trial judge or jury under facts of a case).\r\nAppellant cites federal Medicaid or Medicare regulations in her complaint, and both Appellant and Babcock Center mention various statutes, regulations, and program guidelines in their briefs.Â  We express no opinion on particular standards of care which may be relevant and properly applied in this case.Â  The identification of sources establishing the standard of care with regard to Appellant will be an issue for the parties and court on remand of this case.\r\nIn sum, we find the existence of a common law duty owed by Babcock Center to Appellant.Â  The precise extent and nature of that duty, which is grounded in relevant standards of care, and whether the duty was breached must be determined by a jury on remand.Â  \r\nII.Â  DUTY OF CARE OWED BY DEPARTMENT\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Department on the ground it owes no legal duty of care to Appellant.Â  Appellant asserts Department and the direct provider of services,Â  independent contractor Babcock Center, both owe a duty to exercise reasonable care with regard to Appellant.Â  Appellant asserts Departmentâ€™s duty of care is grounded in both the common law and in various statutes and regulations pertaining to Department.Â  We agree Department owes a common law duty, but decline to address the issue of Departmentâ€™s statutory duty.\r\nA.Â  DEPARTMENTâ€™S DUTY UNDER THE COMMON LAW\r\nAs explained above, under the common law, a private person or business entity which accepts the responsibility of providing care, treatment, or services to a mentally retarded or disabled client has a duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising the client and providing appropriate care and treatment to the client.Â  Thus, to the extent Appellant relies on this common law duty, summary judgment was wrongly granted to Department.Â  See Arthurs ex rel. Estate of Munn v. Aiken County, 346 S.C. 97, 103-105, 551 S.E.2d 579, 582-83 (2001) (public duty rule is applied only when an action is founded upon a statutory duty; when duty is based on common law, then its existence is analyzed as it would be with a private defendant which is not a government entity pursuant to Tort Claims Act); Trousdell v. Cannon, 351 S.C. 636, 641, 572 S.E.2d 264, 266-67 (2002) (same); Morris v. Anderson, 349 S.C. 607, 611-12, 564 S.E.2d 649, 651-52 (2002) (same); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (2005) (governmental entity is liable for its torts â€œin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,â€ subject to limitations upon and exemptions from liability and damages contained in Tort Claims Act).\r\nWhen a governmental entity owes a duty of care to a plaintiff under the common law and other elements of negligence are shown, the next step is to analyze the applicability of exceptions to the waiver of immunity contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (2005 &amp; Supp. 2005) which are asserted by the governmental entity.Â  Arthurs, 346 S.C. at 105, 551 S.E.2d at 583; Trousdell, 351 S.C. at 642, 572 S.E.2d at 267.Â  The governmental entity claiming an exception to the waiver of immunity under the Tort Claims Act has the burden of establishing any limitation on liability.Â  Strange v. S.C. Dept. of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 430, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994).Â Â  \r\nDepartment asserts it is not liable for the torts of its independent contractor, Babcock Center, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(20) (2005), which provides that a governmental entity is not liable for an â€œact or omission of a person other than an employee including but not limited to the criminal actions of third persons.â€Â  Department also has asserted and the circuit court relied on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-30(c) (2005), which provides that the term â€œemployeeâ€ â€œdoes not include an independent contractor doing business with the State.â€ \r\nWe find this position unpersuasive because Department owes a common law duty of care directly to Appellant.Â  The fact an independent contractor provided services to Appellant or the fact a third party may have committed a criminal act in harming Appellant does not affect the existence of Departmentâ€™s duty.Â  In Greenville Memorial Auditorium v. Martin, this Court held the city liable for a patronâ€™s personal injuries resulting from the criminal acts of another despite the cityâ€™s claim of immunity under Â§ 15-78-60(20).Â  301 S.C. 242, 391 S.E.2d 546 (1990).Â  The Court found liability based on the cityâ€™s negligence in adequately securing the premises where the negligence created a foreseeable risk of injury.Â  Id.Â  We find that the Departmentâ€™s potential liability in this case could be based on a similar principle.Â  Although the Department is not liable for the acts or omissions of its independent contractor, Department remains under a duty to provide reasonable care and treatment to its clients.Â  If Department is negligent in its duty, which may include 1) adequately supervising the provision of services by another entity or 2) its own conduct in relation to prior notice of inappropriate care of its clients by such entity, Department may be held liable for breach of its common law duty provided such negligence creates a foreseeable risk of and causes injury.\r\nNext, Department asserts it is immune from liability under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(4) (2005), which provides that a governmental entity is not liable from â€œadoption, enforcement, or compliance with any law or failure to adopt or enforce any law, whether valid or invalid, including, but not limited to, any charter, provision, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, or written policies.â€ Â This argument was neither presented to nor ruled on by the circuit court; therefore, it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  E.g. Smith v. Phillips, 318 S.C. 453, 458 S.E.2d 427 (1995) (with very limited exceptions, appellate court may not address an issue unless the issue was raised to and ruled on by the trial court). \r\nThe circuit court also relied on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(25) (2005).Â  This subsection provides that a governmental entity is not liable from â€œresponsibility or duty including but not limited to supervision, protection, control, confinement, or custody of any student, patient, prisoner, inmate, or client of any governmental entity, except when the responsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.â€\r\nâ€œGross negligence is ordinarily a mixed question of law and fact.â€Â  Faile, 350 S.C. at 332, 566 S.E.2d at 545 (citing Clyburn v. Sumter County School Dist. #17, 317 S.C. 50, 451 S.E.2d 885 (1994)).Â  â€œWhen the evidence supports but one reasonable inference, it is solely a question of law for court, otherwise it is an issue best resolved by the jury. . . .Â  In most cases, gross negligence is a factually controlled concept whose determination best rests with the jury.â€Â  Id. at 332, 566 S.E.2d at 545.Â  We conclude that the issue of whether Department acted in a grossly negligent manner is a factual issue for a jury.\r\nIn sum, we find the existence of a common law duty owed by Department to Appellant. Â Whether the duty was breached and whether the Department met the applicable standard of care must be determined by a jury on remand.\r\nB.Â  DEPARTMENTâ€™S STATUTORY DUTY AND IMPACT OF PUBLIC DUTY RULE\r\n\r\nIn Arthurs, we explained that\r\n[t]he public duty rule presumes statutes which create or define the duties of a public office have the essential purpose of providing for the structure and operation of government or for securing the general welfare and safety of the public. Â Such statutes create no duty of care towards individual members of the general public. . . .Â  The public duty rule is a negative defense which denies an essential element of the plaintiffâ€™s cause of action: Â the existence of a duty of care to the individual plaintiff. . . .Â  It is not a matter of immunity, which is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded and which may be waived. Â Further, it is a rule of statutory construction, that is, a means of determining whether the legislative body that enacted the statute or ordinance intended to create a private cause of action for its breach. . . . \r\nThe public duty rule insulates public officials, employees, and governmental entities from liability for the negligent performance of their official duties by negating the existence of a duty towards the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nArthurs, 346 S.C. at 104, 551 S.E.2d at 582 (citations and quotes omitted).\r\nWe retained the public duty rule, finding it compatible with the Tort Claims Act.Â  However, the rule is applied only when an action is founded upon a statutory duty, not when the duty is grounded in the common law.Â  Arthurs, 346 S.C. at 103-05, 551 S.E.2d at 582-83,Â  \r\n\r\nAs explained in Arthurs,\r\n\r\n[a]n exception to the general rule exists when the statutory duty is owed to individuals rather than to the public at large. Â Our courts are reluctant\r\nto find a special duty. . . .Â  [T]his Court [has] adopted a six part test developed by the Court of Appeals . . . for determining when such a â€œspecial dutyâ€ exists: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) an essential purpose of the statute is to protect against a particular type of harm; \r\n(2) the statute, either directly or indirectly, imposes on a specific public officer a duty to guard against or not cause that harm;\r\n(3) the class of persons the statute intends to protect is identifiable before the fact;\r\n(4) the plaintiff is a person within the protected class; \r\n(5) the public officer knows or has reason to know the likelihood of harm to members of the class if he fails to do his duty; and \r\n(6) the officer is given sufficient authority to act in the circumstances or he undertakes to act in the exercise of his office.\r\n  \r\n\r\nArthurs, 346 S.C. at 106, 551 S.E.2d at 583; accord Steinke, 336 S.C. at 388-89, 520 S.E.2d at 149-50; Jensen, 304 S.C. at 200, 403 S.E.2d at 617.\r\nIn the present case, Departmentâ€™s operations and responsibilities, as well as the care, treatment, and rights of mentally retarded or disabled persons, are governed by a comprehensive scheme of statutes and regulations.Â  See e.g. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-20-10 to -1170 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2005) (S.C. Mental Retardation, Related Disabilities, Head Injuries, and Spinal Cord Injuries Act); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-21-10 to -80 (2002) (Department of Disabilities and Special Needs Family Support Services); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-23-10 to -1150 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2005) (provisions applicable to both mentally ill and mentally retarded persons); (S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-26-10 to -220 (2002) (rights of mental retardation clients); and 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 88-105 to 88-920 (Supp. 2005) (regulations promulgated by Department of Disabilities and Special Needs).Â  Departmentâ€™s operations and responsibilities also are affected by internal standards, policies, and guidelines it has promulgated for particular programs as a result of statutes or regulations.[5]\r\nWe express no opinion on the issues of whether Department owes a duty grounded in statutes or regulations, or whether Department owes a special duty to Appellant under the analysis of the public duty rule set forth in Arthurs, Steinke, and Jensen.Â  The parties have not addressed these issues, which may be explored on remand of this case.\r\nIII.Â  PROXIMATE CAUSE\r\nAppellant contends the circuit court erred in ruling that the proximate cause of any damages suffered by Appellant, as a matter of law, was Appellantâ€™s own voluntary and intentional acts.Â  We agree.\r\nNegligence is not actionable unless it is a proximate cause of the injury.Â  Hanselmann v. McCardle, 275 S.C. 46, 48, 267 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1980).Â  Proximate cause requires proof of both causation in fact and legal cause.Â  Oliver v. S.C. Dept. of Highways and Pub. Transp., 309 S.C. 313, 316, 422 S.E.2d 128, 130 (1992).Â  Causation in fact is proved by establishing the injury would not have occurred â€œbut forâ€ the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Legal cause is proved by establishing foreseeability.Â  Id.; Koester v. Carolina Rental Ctr., Inc., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994).Â  Foreseeability is determined by looking to the natural and probable consequences of the complained of act, although it is not necessary to prove that a particular event or injury was foreseeable.Â  Koester, 313 S.C. at 493, 443 S.E.2d at 394; Oliver, 309 S.C. at 317, 422 S.E.2d at 131; Childers v. Gas Lines, Inc., 248 S.C. 316, 325, 149 S.E.2d 761, 765 (1966).\r\nThe defendantâ€™s negligence does not have to be the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; instead, the plaintiff must prove the defendantâ€™s negligence was at least one of the proximate causes of the injury.Â  Hughes v. Childrenâ€™s Clinic, P.A., 269 S.C. 389, 398, 237 S.E.2d 753, 757 (1977).Â  The question of proximate cause ordinarily is one of fact for the jury, and it may be resolved either by direct or circumstantial evidence.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s sole function regarding the issue is to inquire whether particular conclusions are the only reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.Â  Childers, 248 S.C. at 324, 149 S.E.2d at 765; McNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 349, 499 S.E.2d 488, 497 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nWe hold that the issue of whether Appellantâ€™s injuries were proximately caused by the alleged negligence of Respondents is an issue of fact for the jury.Â  The jury must determine whether Appellantâ€™s damages would have occurred â€œbut forâ€ Respondentsâ€™ alleged negligence, as well as whether such damages were foreseeable, i.e., whether the damages were the natural and probable consequence of a failure to exercise reasonable care in supervising and providing care and treatment to Appellant.Â  The jury may perform its task after gaining a proper understanding of the facts and circumstances of Appellantâ€™s case, as well as the applicable standards of care. \r\nWe further agree with Appellant that the circuit court erred in reasoning she was competent to make her own decisions - such as leaving the Babcock Center home - because she was not adjudicated incompetent to handle her personal and financial affairs until some two years after the events of August 1995.Â  The circuit court relied on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-26-90 (2002), which provides that unless a client has been adjudicated incompetent, she must not be denied the right to, among other things, execute instruments, enter into contractual relationships, and exercise rights of citizenship in the same manner as a non-disabled person. \r\nAppellant alleges she has the emotional and intellectual capacity of a young child.Â  Her actions and the alleged negligence of Respondents must be assessed in light of her mental abilities and the standards governing Respondentsâ€™ duty of care.Â  Appellantâ€™s competence and ability to handle her own affairs, or the lack thereof, is a factual issue related to proximate cause which must be resolved by a jury.[6]Â  The circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Respondents on the ground of proximate cause.\r\nIV.Â  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in relying on the two-year statute of limitations contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(a) (2005) to rule that certain allegations of Departmentâ€™s negligence are time-barred.Â  Appellant does not raise this issue in her Statement of Issues, but she does challenge the ruling in her brief.Â  Given our remand of this case, we will address this issue to avoid future debate and confusion about it.\r\nWhile the circuit court order is rather vague on this point, Department argued at the summary judgment hearing that allegations relating to the initial evaluation and admission of Appellant in 1994 were time-barred.Â  Department apparently believes that only events occurring within the two years preceding the service of the complaint (i.e., 1995-97) may be considered, but cites no authority for this proposition.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe events in question occurred August 30, 1995.Â  Appellant served her initial complaint on Department on August 29, 1997, meeting the two-year deadline.Â  Accordingly, allegations relating to Departmentâ€™s alleged negligence in connection with Appellantâ€™s initial evaluation and admission in 1994 are not time-barred.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the circuit court and hold that Babcock Center and its employee have a common law duty to exercise reasonable care in supervising and providing care and treatment to Appellant, a mentally retarded client with disabilities and special needs.Â  Department also owes a common law duty to Appellant and statutory exceptions to the waiver of immunity which Department asserts are inapplicable.Â  We decline to reach the issues of whether Department owes a statutory duty or the impact of the public duty rule.Â  We hold that whether the breach of a duty proximately caused Appellantâ€™s injuries is a question of fact for the jury.Â  Finally, we hold that allegations relating to Departmentâ€™s alleged negligence in connection with Appellantâ€™s initial evaluation and admission are not time-barred.\r\nREVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the result reached by the majority because I agree that Babcock Center owed a common law duty of due care to Appellant.Â  I write separately because I do not agree with that portion of the majority opinion that finds a duty based upon statute.Â  In my opinion, the source of the duty owed to Appellant is not found in or created by any statute.Â  Rather, as indicated in footnote 3 of the majority opinion, some of the statutes cited in the opinion â€œmay be relevant in ... defining the appropriate standard of care.â€\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Madison is a fictitious name.Â  We will refer to her as Appellant for purposes of clarity even though the named plaintiff is her mother and guardian, Brenda Bryant.\r\n[2]Â  References to Babcock Center include the center and Batchelor, its employee.Â  We will refer to the three defendants collectively as Respondents.\r\n[3]Â  Neither the record nor the briefs contain a thorough review or assessment of various statutes and regulations pertaining to the care of mentally disabled or retarded persons.Â  Given the posture of this case and our primary conclusion that a duty exists under the common law to exercise reasonable care in supervising and providing care to such persons, we have not attempted to fully ascertain the impact of various statutes or regulations, or identify all statutes and regulations which may be relevant in establishing a duty or defining the appropriate standard of care.Â  Such issues may be explored by the parties and court on remand of this case.\r\n[4]Â  The mother of the mentally retarded adult male in Youngberg alleged violations of her sonâ€™s constitutional rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.Â  While Section 1983 cases may shed light generally on the rights of mentally retarded or disabled persons and the responsibilities of their caregivers, such cases are controlled by different standards than tort cases sounding in common law negligence.Â  See e.g. Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940 (11th Cir. 2000) (addressing Â§ 1983 lawsuit brought pursuant to Youngberg by parents of mentally retarded child who allegedly was physically and mentally abused by various mental health professionals, administrators, and direct care personnel at state mental hospital); White by White v. Chambliss, 112 F.3d 731 (4th Cir. 1997) (addressingÂ  Â§ 1983 lawsuit brought in connection with death of child in foster home and discussing different standards at issue in negligence and Â§ 1983 actions); Fialkowski v. Greenwich Home for Children, Inc., 921 F.2d 459 (3d Cir. 1990) (nonprofit organization which performed mental health intake and referral services for county may have acted negligently in failing to recommend feeding restrictions for profoundly retarded adult male with eating disorder, but organization did not violate victimâ€™s Fourteenth Amendment due process rights).\r\n[5]Â  See footnote 3.\r\n[6]Â  Babcock Center contends Appellant is arguing she was not competent to testify due to her mental retardation, i.e., Babcock Center focuses on Appellantâ€™s competency to testify as opposed to her competency to make her own decisions.Â  The circuit court focused on Appellantâ€™s competency to act on her own, not her competency to testify.Â  As far as competency to testify, Appellant should be treated as a person of like age, intelligence, and experience.Â  Cf. State v. Green, 267 S.C. 599, 603, 230 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1976) (there is no fixed age which an individual must attain in order to be competent to testify as a witness); S.C. Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Doe, 292 S.C. 211, 219, 355 S.E.2d 543, 547 (Ct. App. 1987) (childâ€™s competency to testify depends on showing to the satisfaction of the trial judge that child is substantially rational and responsive to the questions asked and is sufficiently aware of the moral duty to tell the truth and the probability of punishment if he lies).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26223","title":"In the Matter of Greenwood  County Magistrate Joe C.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Robert E. Bogan, Assistant Deputy Attorney General, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nC. Rauch Wise, of Greenwood, for respondent.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a public reprimand or a definite suspension pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  Respondent requests any suspension be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.[1] Â We accept the agreement and impose a one (1) year suspension.Â  We decline respondentâ€™s request that the suspension be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1981, respondent was appointed part-time magistrate for Greenwood County.Â  In 1989, he became a full-time magistrate and the chief magistrate and served continuously as chief magistrate until being placed on interim suspension on May 4, 2006.Â  \r\nUntil approximately January 2005, the Greenwood County Magistrate Courtâ€™s deposit was taken directly to the bank.Â  This procedure was changed at the request or suggestion of county officials or agencies and, from that point, deposits from various county agencies, including the magistrate court, were taken to the Greenwood County Treasurerâ€™s Office and responsibility for the deposits was given to that office.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the daily deposit for criminal, civil, and traffic courts were compiled at the end of each day and placed in a safe.Â  The deposit would be taken to the Treasurerâ€™s Office the following morning.Â  The Treasurerâ€™s Office did not issue a receipt for the deposit, but would forward the bankâ€™s deposit receipt back to respondentâ€™s office.Â  On some occasions, it took several days for the receipt to be returned to respondentâ€™s office.Â  Respondent acquiesced in these changes without inquiring whether the deposit procedure complied with the Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order of November 9, 1999.Â  \r\nRespondent gave the office manager, who was a part-time magistrate, exclusive or virtually exclusive authority to manage the daily financial activity of the Greenwood County Magistrateâ€™s Court.Â  The extent of respondentâ€™s financial oversight consisted of making â€œspot checksâ€ to make sure the deposit slips coincided with the bank statements.Â  \r\nIn 1998, Toni Cole began working in respondentâ€™s office.Â  Her initial responsibilities were limited primarily to eviction and fraudulent check cases and to receiving and receipting money.Â  Later, her responsibilities included compiling the deposit and taking it to the Treasurerâ€™s Office on occasions when other employees were absent or unavailable.Â  \r\nOn February 3, 2004, $1,000.00 in cash was discovered missing from the safe.Â  Law enforcement suspected Cole of taking the money but she scored â€œinconclusiveâ€ on a polygraph examination in connection with the investigation.Â  No criminal charges were brought against her at the time and the issue of the missing $1,000.00 remained unsolved.Â  Respondent made no changes to the financial procedures in the office and Cole was allowed to continue her duties with respect to office finances, which included unsupervised access to the safe.Â  \r\nIn December 2005, $500.00 was discovered missing from the safe.Â  Cole subsequently claimed to have found the money behind the file cabinet on which the safe sat, though recollections differ as to whether this occurred shortly after it was discovered missing or as much as a month or more later.Â  Because the money was recovered, even though under suspicious circumstances, there was apparently no inquiry as to the validity of Coleâ€™s explanation.Â  Respondent made no changes concerning the financial procedures and Cole was allowed to continue her duties with respect to office finances, which included unsupervised access to the safe.Â  \r\nOn February 27, 2006, the Court issued Matter of Hensley, 367 S.C. 619, 627 S.E.2d 716 (2006), which addressed a magistrateâ€™s failure to exercise financial oversight of office staff.Â  ODC is informed that the Hensley opinion was brought to respondentâ€™s attention by another Greenwood County Magistrate who expressed concern that the November 9, 1999 administrative order was not being followed in the Greenwood County Magistrateâ€™s Court, particularly in light of the above-referenced incidents.Â  Other magistrates reported that respondent stated he was not going to comply with the financial oversight procedures set forth in the order with the words â€œIâ€™m not going to do it.Â  You going to do it?â€\r\nRespondent acknowledges having a conversation with another magistrate about the Hensley opinion, but states his comments were misunderstood.Â  Respondent represents that the other magistrate was the most knowledgeable about court financial procedures and that his intent was to change the deposit procedure by having the other magistrate review the deposits.Â  Accordingly, respondent stated he said, â€œIâ€™m not going to do it, youâ€™re going to do it, and then Iâ€™m going to check behind you.â€Â  Respondent further acknowledges, however, that no efforts were undertaken on his part to put these specific changes into effect before the present matters came to light.Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nOn March 8, 2006, a court employee discovered that $2,500.00 received as bond payment on February 16, 2006 was not shown as deposited on bank records.Â  On April 5, 2006, an employee reconciling bank records discovered that the entire deposit of $4,803.20 on March 17, 2006 was missing.Â  Respondent reported the matter to the Greenwood County Sheriffâ€™s Department which retained jurisdiction over the complaint and commenced an investigation.Â  At a meeting of investigators and court personnel the next day, two investigators observed the employees in attendance and scored them in accordance with a nationally recognized psychologically-based deception detection and interview technique.Â  \r\nBased on that evaluation, investigators elected to question Cole first.Â  Subsequently, Cole confessed to stealing the March 17, 2006, deposit as well as to the thefts of $4,497.50 (the deposit for March 27, 2006) and $10,157.00 (the deposit for April 3, 2006) that were not previously known to be missing.Â  According to Cole, she took the deposits to her vehicle rather than to the Treasurerâ€™s Office, removed and kept the cash, and later shredded or discarded the checks and other non-cash payments.Â  Cole also confessed to the $1,000.00 theft in February 2004, the $2,500.00 theft in February 2006, and to removing and replacing the $500.00 in December 2005.Â Â Â  \r\nAuditors hired by the Sheriffâ€™s Department determined that other money was taken by a second employee through voiding or deleting cases from the computer system.Â  The exact amount missing is unknown at this time.Â  \r\nQuestions concerning the oversight of restitution monies were also raised to ODC during the investigation of this matter.Â  It was reported that the Greenwood County Magistrateâ€™s Court accepted and disbursed restitution payments, including cash â€œoff the booksâ€ either without receipts or with receipts handwritten on whatever scrap of paper might be available.\r\nRespondent informs ODC that restitution was either paid directly to the victim in court or that the payor was required to later deliver a check or money order payable to the victim.Â  Court personnel would notify the victim who would pick up the payment.Â  Respondent represents that any other receipt of restitution funds by court personnel was not authorized and that he had no knowledge of the receipt of restitution payments in any unauthorized manner.Â  \r\nThe Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order of November 9, 1999 provides, among other things, that:\r\n\r\n[w]hile the Court recognizes that magistrates must utilize employees of their office to assist in the handling of monies of their office, each magistrate is personally responsible for compliance with all procedures for the handling of the monies of their magisterial office and proper record keeping related thereto and shall regularly, but no less than monthly, review bank statements and other records to insure such compliance.\r\n\r\nRespondent represents that he relied entirely on his staff to properly document and disburse the monies of his office and acknowledges that his supervision and oversight did not comply with the requirements of the Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order of November 9, 1999.Â  \r\nODC contends that the misappropriations would have been deterred or minimized had the mandates and procedures required by the November 9, 1999 order been in place.Â  Respondent does not contest this representation.Â  \r\nIn addition, it was reported to ODC that, during the course of the investigation of these matters by the Greenwood County Sheriffâ€™s Department, respondent attempted to influence one or more other magistrates to limit the scope of the questions they would be willing to answer during polygraph examinations.Â  According to one magistrate, respondent suggested they only answer questions about whether they took money or whether they knew anyone else had taken money, thereby avoiding any questions about the lack of financial oversight in the magistrateâ€™s court.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold the integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should personally observe high standards of conduct);\r\nCanon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law); Canon 3 (judge shall diligently perform duties of judicial office); Canon 3A (judge shall perform all duties prescribed by law); Canon 3(C)(1) (judge shall maintain professional competence in judicial administration); and Canon 3(C)(2) (judge shall require staff to observe standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge), of Rule 501, SCACR. Â Respondent further admits he violated the Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order of November 9, 1999.

Â§ 56-5-1520 (2006).Â  The violator was instructed by the police officer who issued the ticket to contact respondent at a telephone number written on the bottom of the ticket.Â  The violator subsequently contacted respondent by telephone and was informed she could pay a higher fine for a different offense that would not blemish her driverâ€™s record and that, if she chose to do so, payment should be sent to respondentâ€™s home address and made payable to him.Â  On June 9, 2006, the violator purchased a money order payable to respondent and sent it to respondentâ€™s home address by certified mail.Â  Respondent negotiated the money order on or about June 19, 2006.Â  \r\nOn July 12, 2006, investigators from ODC traveled to Greeleyville with demand subpoenas for respondent, the police department, and the court clerk to obtain records related to the disposition of the ticket.Â  Investigators learned the ticket had been marked â€œnot guilty,â€ that there was no receipt for the payment sent by the violator, and that there was no other ticket adjudicating the violator guilty of any traffic offense alleged to have occurred on June 7, 2006.Â Â Â  \r\nRespondent provided a written statement to investigators in which he stated he converted money he received for more than one ticket in the month of June to his own use.Â  He admitted he used the money from the ticket described above to pay his bills.Â  Respondent was placed on interim suspension by the Court on the same day he gave this statement to investigators.Â  \r\nLater, respondent gave ODC a statement under oath pursuant to Rule 19(c)(5), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  Respondent stated:Â  1) he needed money to pay bills; 2) he took money from four tickets in June 2006, but not from any others; and 3) it was his intent to pay the money back on the next pay day, which had yet to occur when investigators visited him on July 12, 2006. \r\nSubsequently, investigators determined respondent had engaged in similar conduct concerning at least one other ticket in a month other than June.Â  Respondent acknowledges that the information he gave ODC in his statement under oath was not accurate.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold the integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high standards of conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2(A) (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall at all times act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of judiciary);\r\nCanon 3 (judge shall perform duties of judicial office impartially); Canon 3A (judicial duties take precedence over all of judgeâ€™s other activities); Canon 3B(1) (judge shall hear and decide matters assigned); Canon 3B(7) (judge shall not initiate ex parte communications); Canon 3(B)(8) (judge shall dispose of all judicial matters fairly); Canon 3(C) (judge shall diligently discharge judgeâ€™s administrative responsibilities and shall maintain professional competence in judicial administration);Â  Canon 4 (judge shall conduct extra-judicial activities so as to minimize risk of conflict with judicial obligations); and Canon 4A(2) (judge shall conduct all extra-judicial activities so that they do not demean the judicial office).Â  He further agrees that he violated the Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order of November 9, 1999 which addresses financial recordkeeping standards for magistrates. Â Finally, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct), Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate valid order issued by a court of this state), and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Oath of Office) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent shall not apply for, seek, or accept any judicial position whatsoever in this State without the prior written authorization of this Court after due service on ODC of any petition seeking the Courtâ€™s authorization.Â  Respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent no longer holds judicial office.Â  A public reprimand is the most severe sanction the Court can impose when a judge no longer holds judicial office.Â  See In re Oâ€™Kelley, 361 S.C. 30, 603 S.E.2d 410 (2004); In re Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26225","title":"In the Matter of Sumter County Master-in-Equity Linwood S.

respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  Respondent requests the suspension be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.[1] We accept the agreement and impose a one year suspension retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was admitted to practice law in South Carolina in 1968.Â  In 1993, he became the part-time Master-in-Equity for Sumter County.Â  In March 2002, respondent sustained a spinal cord injury that permits him to work only from a wheelchair.Â  \r\nIn late 2002, respondent hired Shirley Holloman as a secretary at his law firm.Â  In or about December 2002, respondent curtailed his private law practice and relocated his office to the Sumter County Courthouse.Â  At or around the time of the move, Holloman was hired by Sumter County as a full-time secretary or assistant in respondentâ€™s Master-in-Equityâ€™s office.Â  Hollomanâ€™s duties included disbursing monies related to cases handled by respondent.Â  While employed full-time as a county employee, Holloman also performed work for respondentâ€™s private law practice.Â  Respondent had full faith in Hollomanâ€™s honesty and integrity.Â  \r\nIn 2006, Holloman began to be absent from work in a manner that respondent believed excessive and, on May 12, 2006, respondent terminated Holloman for that reason.Â  On May 13, 2006, while organizing and balancing the financial records of the Master-in-Equityâ€™s office, respondent determined that funds were missing from the Master-in-Equityâ€™s account.Â  \r\nHolloman confessed to embezzling money from the Master-in-Equity account.Â  According to Holloman, it was customary procedure in the office for respondent to sign â€œblankâ€ checks so she could later make legitimate disbursements from the Master-in-Equity account.Â  During the 40 month period from February 2003 to May 2006, there were 89 checks drawn on respondentâ€™s Master-in-Equity account payable to Holloman totaling $637,445.68 (including more than $300,000.00 payable to Holloman in 2005 alone), though Holloman contends a small number of the checks were legitimate payments or reimbursements.Â  \r\nAnalysis of the Master-in-Equity bank records indicates Holloman usually wrote two to four checks to herself every month between October 2003 and May 2006, though in five of those months she only wrote one check and in another month she wrote six.Â  Fifty-eight of the sixty-three checks payable to Holloman after August 13, 2004, were for multiples of $5,000.00.Â  These include thirty-five $5,000.00 checks, twelve $10,000.00 checks, four $15,000.00 checks, three $20,000.00 checks, two $25,000.00 checks, one $40,000.00 check, and one $50,000.00 check.Â  The five checks not written for multiples of $5,000.00 after August 13, 2004, were for $12,460.36, $8,000.00, $400.00, $250.00, and $16.60.Â  \r\nTo cover her embezzlement scheme, Holloman made false entries in the check ledger concerning the payee and amount.Â  Respondent represents Holloman also concealed her actions by prohibiting other office staff from opening bank statements, by storing the statement in the top portion of a closet or filing cabinets that were not within reach from his wheelchair, and, on one occasion when he asked to review the statements, by falsely representing that she had taken them home to work on them and forgotten to bring them back.Â  Respondent concedes, however, that except for the one occasion mentioned above, he did not ask Holloman for the bank statements and related records in order to review them, that he made no meaningful review of the cancelled checks and bank statements, and that Hollomanâ€™s scheme of misappropriation would have been easily discovered by reviewing the financial records for any month during the period of time from October 2003 through May 2006.Â  \r\nRespondent reports he did not knowingly or willfully sign blank checks and has no recollection of having done so, though he could see how it happened that he did.Â  Respondent also represents that his signature was forged on a small number of the aforementioned checks.Â  ODC does not dispute that representation.[2]Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nDuring its investigation of this matter, ODC learned respondent was charging an assessment or fee of $15.74 on each Master-in-Equity case.Â  Respondent represents this amount was charged to cover the average expenses of handling a matter in the Master-in-Equity court (i.e., copies, postage, long distance calls, and supplies).Â  Respondent accumulated and held these monies in the Master-in-Equity account and directed certain payments from these accumulated monies for Judicial Continuing Legal Education fees, seminar expenses, judicial conferences, employee mileage, and other expenses.Â  Respondent acknowledges that he charged and expended these monies without statutory authority.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct:Â \r\nCanon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of judicial office diligently); Canon 3A (judge shall perform all duties prescribed by law); Canon 3(C)(1) (judge shall maintain professional competence in judicial administration); Canon 3(C)(2) (judge shall require staff to observe standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge); and Canon 4(D)(1)(a) (judge shall not engage in financial dealings that may be reasonably perceived to exploit the judgeâ€™s judicial position), of Rule 501, SCACR.Â  Respondent further admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to persistently fail to perform judicial duties or persistently perform judicial duties in an incompetent or neglectful manner) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a suspension from judicial duties.Â  We therefore accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent for one (1) year, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  The suspension shall be without pay.Â  \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] On June 12, 2006, the Court placed respondent on interim suspension.Â  \r\n[2] To ODCâ€™s best knowledge, respondent reviewed the financial records of his law practice as required by Rule 417, SCACR, and no funds were taken from that account by Holloman.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and C. Tex Davis, Jr., Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nPaulette Edwards, of Law Office of Paulette Edwards, PA, of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a definite suspension not to exceed two (2) years.Â  See Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  She requests the suspension be made retroactive to the date of her interim suspension. [1]Â  We accept the Agreement and impose a definite suspension of two years, retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nComplainant A consulted with respondent about handling a domestic matter.Â  Complainant A provided several documents to respondent and paid a retainer.Â  After approximately three months, respondent had not made any progress on the case.Â  Respondent eventually referred Complainant A to another attorney and refunded a portion of the retainer.Â  \r\nDuring the course of the investigation, ODC assigned this matter to an Attorney to Assist (ATA).Â  Respondent failed to timely respond to the ATAâ€™s request to schedule a meeting to address the allegations.Â  In addition, respondent failed to follow through on her promise to the ATA to provide certain documents which could corroborate her version of the events relevant to the investigation.\r\nMatter II\r\nComplainant B retained respondent to handle a child custody action.Â  Respondent failed to effectively explain the scopeÂ of her representation to Complainant B, which prevented Complainant B from making an informed decision about her case.Â  In addition, respondent made several comments about Complainant B whichÂ  Complainant B found to be demeaning and unprofessional.Â Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nComplainant C retained respondent to handle a child support matter.Â  Respondent failed to respond to several of Complainant Câ€™s telephone messages in a timely manner.Â  Complainant C became frustrated with respondentâ€™s failure to prepare and file pleadings to address her concerns.Â  Respondent admits that some of Complainant Câ€™s concerns could have been alleviated had respondent more effectively explained the litigation process and procedures.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nIn October 2003, Complainant D retained respondent to handle a modification of child support and visitation.Â  Subsequent to the initial consultation and two brief telephone conversations, Complainant D was unable to communicate with respondent.Â  Complainant D left numerous telephone messages for respondent seeking an update on the status of her case and received no response.Â  In addition, Complainant D mailed two certified letters to respondent, both of which were returned without response.Â  \r\nWhen Complainant D telephoned respondentâ€™s office in December 2003, she learned the office telephone number had been disconnected.Â  Respondent had not provided any updated contact information.Â  Complainant D subsequently discovered respondent had failed to file the pleadings and that little to no progress had been made with her case.Â Â Â  \r\nMatter V\r\nComplainant C filed an application for relief with the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board (the Board).Â  The Board assigned Maren Sherman, Esquire, to investigate the claim.Â  Ms. Sherman attempted to communicate with respondent on numerous occasions, leaving several telephone messages for respondent.Â  Respondent failed to respond to any of the messages.Â  Thereafter, on March 29, 2004, the Board issued its ruling, ordering respondent to return $650.00 to Complainant C.Â  Respondent failed to comply with the ruling or to respond in any manner.Â  The Board issued a Certificate of Noncompliance on May 20, 2004, for respondentâ€™s continued failure to comply with its ruling.Â  \r\nComplainant D also filed an application for relief with theÂ  Board.Â  The Board issued its ruling that respondent should return $1,000.00 to Complainant D.Â  The Board sent notice of its ruling to respondentâ€™s official address.Â  Respondent failed to comply with the ruling or respond in any manner.Â  On September 10, 2004, the Board issued a Certificate of Noncompliance due to respondentâ€™s continued failure to comply with the ruling of the Board.Â  After respondent relocated out-of-state, she failed to officially notify and provide the South Carolina Bar with her new contact information.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nComplainant E retained respondent to handle a workerâ€™s compensation case.Â  Complainant Eâ€™s claim was denied after a hearing in May 2003, however, Complainant E still had legal remedies available.Â  On numerous occasions, Complainant E attempted to communicate with respondent about the options for her case.Â  Respondent failed to respond to Complainant Eâ€™s messages.Â  Complainant E discovered respondentâ€™s office telephone number had been disconnected and that her office had been vacated.Â  Respondent withdrew from representation without ensuring that Complainant E was aware of the circumstances and that adequate provisions had been made to protect Complainant Eâ€™s interests.\r\nMatter VII\r\nComplainant F retained respondent to handle a child custody/visitation matter.Â Â  Shortly after being retained, respondent verbally informed Complainant F that she would be moving out of state, but she assured Complainant F that she would remain on the case until completion.Â  Respondent appeared with Complainant F at one hearing, although communication after the hearing quickly deteriorated.\r\nRespondent relocated out of state.Â  Respondent failed to provide Complainant F with her current address and telephone number. \r\nComplainant F believed respondent was continuing to work on the case but, without Complainant Fâ€™s knowledge or consent, respondent had forwarded Complainant Fâ€™s case file to another attorney.Â  Respondent failed to take the necessary actions to withdraw from the representation in order to protect Complainant Fâ€™s interests.Â Â  \r\nComplainant F learned of the date and time for an upcoming hearing from opposing counsel.Â  Respondent later telephoned Complainant F and apologized for failing to inform her of the hearing date.Â  \r\nOn or about June 28, 2004, respondent spoke with Complainant F and, once again, gave her false assurances that she would be able to handle the case through to its completion.Â  At the time of this conversation, respondent knew that an order placing her on interim suspension had been or would be issued shortly.Â  Respondent failed to promptly notify Complainant F, as well as several other clients, as required by Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, that she had been suspended from the practice of law.Â  In addition, she failed to formally withdraw from representation of Complainant F after the suspension as provided by Rule 30, RLDE.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers); Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(10) (lawyer shall not willfully fail to comply with a final decision of the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board).Â  In addition, respondent admits she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to client ); Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall consult with client about objectives of representation); Rule 1.3Â  (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter, promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, and explain matter to extent reasonably necessary to permit client to make informed decisions regarding the representation); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safe keep client property); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect clientâ€™s interests, including reasonable notice to client and refunding of unearned advance payment fee); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with interests of client); Rule 8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority); and\r\nRule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and impose a definite suspension of two years, retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was placed on interim suspension on June 29, 2004.Â  In the Matter of

The Court of Appeals held petitionerâ€™s recovery was limited to the 20% impairment to his leg.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in holding that petitionerâ€™s pre-existing conditions should not be considered in determining his compensable disability?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe single commissioner, affirmed by the full commission and the circuit court, found petitioner totally disabled under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2005) which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(a) If an employee who has a permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin incurs a subsequent disability from injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in compensation and medical payments liability or either, for disability that is substantially greater, by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and subsequent injury or by reason of the aggravation of the preexisting impairment, than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer or his insurance carrier shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and medical benefits provided by this Title;Â  but such employer or his insurance carrier shall be reimbursed from the Second Injury Fund . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n(d) As used in this section, â€œpermanent physical impairmentâ€ means any permanent condition, whether congenital or due to injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if the employee should become unemployed.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nApplying this section, the commissioner concluded petitioner was totally disabled from the combined effect of his pre-existing conditions and the workplace injury to his leg.Â  The record supports the commissionerâ€™s finding that petitioner is no longer able to work.Â  Significantly, there is no finding that petitionerâ€™s pre-existing conditions aggravated his leg injury or that the leg injury aggravated his pre-existing conditions.Â  \r\nIn reversing petitionerâ€™s award, the Court of Appeals found Â§ 42-9-400 inapplicable and instead relied on Singleton v. Young Lumber Co., 236 S.C. 454, 114 S.E.2d 837 (1960), to rule that petitionerâ€™s compensation was limited to the amount specified for the leg as a scheduled member under the scheduled injury statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  The Court of Appeals held petitioner could not recover total disability compensation, no matter how debilitating his pre-existing conditions were, because there was no causal connection with his workplace injury.\r\nWe conclude the Court of Appeals erred in relying on Singleton.Â  Singleton involved a sole injury to a scheduled member - no other condition was claimed to have contributed to disability.Â  The argument was that the injury to the scheduled member, a leg, was itself so disabling that the claimant should be found totally disabled.Â  This Court held that because the injury was confined to a scheduled member, compensation must be determined under the scheduled injury statute as provided by the legislature.Â  236 S.C. at 473, 114 S.E.2d at 846.Â  Singleton stands simply for the proposition that impairment involving only a scheduled member is compensated under the scheduled injury statute and not the general disability statute.[2]Â  The issue whether greater disability may be awarded where there is an additional impairment without a causal link has never come squarely before us although we have specifically allowed greater disability when there is a causal link.[3]Â Â Â  \r\nWorkersâ€™ compensation statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of coverage.Â  Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992).Â  We hold the commissioner correctly found\r\nÂ§ 42-9-400 controlling here.Â  This statute was enacted in 1972, several years after our decision in Singleton.Â  The language of Â§ 42-9-400(a) and (d) indicates the legislature clearly envisioned that a claimant may recover for greater disability than that incurred from a single injury to a particular body part if the combination with any pre-existing condition hinders reemployment.Â  There is no requirement that the pre-existing condition aggravated the injury, or that the injury aggravated the pre-existing condition, so long as there is a greater disability simply from the â€œcombined effectsâ€ of the injury and the pre-existing condition.[4] Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals reasoned that Â§ 42-9-400 was not applicable because it merely entitles an employerâ€™s insurance carrier to be reimbursed by the Second Injury Fund.Â  We disagree.Â  Providing for an employerâ€™s reimbursement from the Fund for the â€œcombined effectsâ€ of a workplace injury and pre-existing conditions would be futile unless a claimant could actually make such a recovery in the first place.Â  We presume the legislature intends to accomplish something by its enactments and that it would not do a futile thing. Â Gordon v. Phillips Utilities, Inc., 362 S.C. 403, 608 S.E.2d 425 (2005).Â Â  \r\nIn conclusion, the Court of Appeals erred in relying on Singleton Â and refusing to apply Â§ 42-9-400. Â Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision and reinstate the commissionâ€™s award for total disability.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Ellison v. Frigidaire Home Prods., 360 S.C. 236, 600 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 2004).Â Â  \r\n[2]Singleton does state that â€œ[w]here the injury is confined to the scheduled member, and there is no impairment of any other part of the body because of such injury, the employee is limited to the scheduled compensation. . . .â€Â  236 S.C. at 471, 114 S.E.2d at 845 (emphasis added).Â  This statement is simply dictum, however, because there was no issue of any additional impairment in Singleton, causally related or not.Â  This dictum has been subsequently cited but never to support a holding on the precise issue here.Â  See Therrell v. Jerryâ€™s Inc., 370 S.C. 22, ___, 633 S.E.2d 893, 895, n.2 (2006) (case holds torn rotator cuff is not limited to scheduled recovery for arm); Wigfall v. Tideland Utilities, Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 103, 580 S.E.2d 100, 101 (2003) (case holds medical and wage losses are not considered an additional impairment to injury to scheduled member); Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2002) (case holds psychological system is not a scheduled member); Simmons v. City of Charleston, 349 S.C. 64, 75, 562 S.E.2d 476, 482 (Ct. App. 2002) (case holds injury to scheduled member that affected other parts of body compensable as general disability); Brown v. Owen Steel Co., 316 S.C. 278, 280, 450 S.E.2d 57, 58 (Ct. App. 1994) (case holds injury to back is compensable as scheduled member).\r\nIn Wigfall, supra, we reaffirmed our holding in Singleton that an injury to a scheduled member which is the sole cause of the claimantâ€™s disability may be compensated only under the scheduled injury statute.Â  We concluded that the â€œimpairmentâ€ mentioned in Singleton means only â€œphysical deficiency.â€Â  354 S.C. at 104, 580 S.E.2d at 102.Â  Here, petitioner is claiming total disability from the combined effect of his workplace injury and his pre-existing physical deficiencies.Â  Further, Â§ 42-9-400, which is an issue here, was not an issue in Wigfall because there was no question of a combined effect with pre-existing conditions.\r\n[3] E.g., Anderson v. Baptist Med. Center, 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001) (workplace injuries aggravated pre-existing psychological condition); Brown v. R.L. Jordan Oil Co., 291 S.C. 272, 353 S.E.2d 280 (1987) (workplace injury aggravated pre-existing thrombophlebitis); see also Simmons v. City of Charleston, supra.\r\n[4]In fact, the statute provides for the aggravation of a pre-existing condition as an alternative to the combined effects provision. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26228","title":"In the Matter of Brigina Dicks-Woolridge","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26228","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary matter.","date":"2006-11-20","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Brigina Dicks-Woolridge, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26228\r\nHeard October 17, 2006 - Filed November 20, 2006Â Â \r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel; both of Columbia, for Â Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nBrigina Dicks-Woolridge, of Florence, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct filed formal charges against respondent.[1]Â  A hearing before the sub-panel, which respondent did not attend, was held regarding the charges.Â  The sub-panel recommended respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.Â  The full panel adopted the sub-panelâ€™s report and\r\nrecommendations. \r\nFACTS\r\nThe essential nature of the charges against respondent involve failing to act diligently for or communicate with her clients, failing to maintain unearned fees and to keep client funds in a trust account, using funds in the trust account for her own benefit, and failing to cooperate with Disciplinary Counsel in the investigation of these matters.\r\nThe Jackson Matter\r\nOn December 14, 2001, respondent conducted the closing on the sale of a house owned by Jackson and his former wife.Â  The settlement statement respondent prepared did not accurately reflect the actual transaction.Â  Further, respondent withheld $30,913.87 from the closing to pay off the mortgage; however, she did not immediately pay it off.Â  Thereafter, respondentâ€™s trust account balance fell below the amount required to pay off the mortgage, and the amount was not restored until January 31, 2002.Â  At that time, she paid off the mortgage.Â  Respondent failed to produce sufficient records during the disciplinary investigation to determine the source of the deposit that restored the balance.\r\nAlthough respondent paid Jacksonâ€™s mortgage on January 31, 2002, she did not file the deed and completed mortgage until January 2003, almost a year after the closing.Â  The payment of the mortgage and recording fees left a ledger balance of $892.00, which reflects the amount still owed to Jackson and his former wife.Â  Review of the bank statements indicated the balance in the trust account dropped below the ledger balance twice.\r\nThe panel found there is clear and convincing evidence respondent failed to act with diligence in this matter in violation of Rule 1.3 of Rule 407, SCACR, failed to keep safe her clientsâ€™ funds in violation of Rule 1.15 of Rule 407, SCACR, failed to maintain accurate or sufficient financial records in violation of Rule 417, SCACR, and that respondent engaged in a criminal act in willfully spending the funds inadvertently wired into her trust account in violation of Rule 8.4(b) and (d), of Rule 407,\r\nSCACR.\r\nThe panel further found respondent failed to cooperate in the investigation of this matter. Â Respondent twice failed to appear to give a statement pursuant to Rule 19(c)(4) of Rule 413, RLDE.Â  Following her interim suspension, respondent ultimately appeared for a Rule 19(c)(4) statement and produced some records at that time.Â  However, she did not fully comply with the subpoena and did not appear for the conclusion of her statement even though she requested the opportunity to return and provide additional information.Â  Accordingly, the panel found respondent failed to cooperate in this matter in violation of Rule 8.1.\r\nThe Grant Matter\r\nRespondent represented Grant regarding her claims arising from a June 2000 auto accident.Â  During the representation, Grant moved away and her mother became respondentâ€™s contact.Â  Respondent obtained a $7,000 settlement in January 2002.Â  The mother testified she received a check for her daughterâ€™s portion of the settlement but did not receive an accounting of the remaining funds.Â  The fee agreement obligated respondent to pay medical providers from the settlement proceeds.Â  However, these medical bills were not promptly paid at the time of the settlement.Â  The mother testified that both she and her daughter made a number of unsuccessful attempts to communicate with respondent about the unpaid bills.Â  According to the file produced by respondent, the bills were not all paid until May 2002, after she received notice of the grievance.\r\nRespondent testified in her Rule 19(c)(4) appearance that the check she issued to Grant was inadvertently written from her operating account.Â  Instead of moving the amount of Grantâ€™s share from the trust account to the operating account to correct the error, respondent chose to leave those funds in the trust account and give herself a â€œcreditâ€ that she subsequently used to pay bankruptcy filing fees for various clients.Â  She kept no ledger or other accounting of those payments.\r\nThe review of respondentâ€™s trust account records revealed that she issued two trust account checks payable to herself for fees in Grantâ€™s case prior to receipt and deposit of the settlement check.Â  The trust account records show no other deposit of funds that would entitle respondent to these two payments.Â  According to the fee agreement, respondent was only entitled to one-third of the recovery.Â  Respondent did not provide an explanation for the dates or amounts of the checks to herself.\r\nThe panel found there is clear and convincing evidence respondent failed to diligently disburse the settlement proceeds in violation of Rules 1.3 and 4.4, of Rule 407, SCACR; failed to adequately communicate with Grant and her mother in violation of Rule 1.4; misappropriated $4,622.21 from her trust account when she negotiated checks payable to herself prior to deposit of funds in the account, in violation of Rules 1.15, 8.4(b), and 8.4(e); and failed to maintain the financial records related to this transaction as required by Rule 417, SCACR.[2]\r\nThe panel further found respondent failed to cooperate in the investigation of this matter.Â  She appeared pursuant to Rule 19(c)(4) and produced her client file, but was unable to produce adequate financial records to show that all of the funds received on Grantâ€™s behalf were appropriately disbursed.Â  Respondent was given fifteen days to produce those documents.Â  She failed to do so and she failed to appear at the conclusion of her Rule 19(c)(4) appearance.Â  The Panel found there is clear and convincing evidence respondent failed to cooperate in violation of Rule 8.1.\r\nThe Graham Matter\r\nRespondent was appointed to represent Graham in a post-conviction relief matter in June 1999.Â  At the PCR hearing, the judge indicated he was going to deny the application and instructed the Attorney Generalâ€™s office to prepare an order.Â  There was a fire in respondentâ€™s office in May 2001.Â  As a result of the fire, respondentâ€™s computers were destroyed and several client files were lost or damaged. Â Grahamâ€™s original client file was lost in the fire and respondent did not take any steps to reconstruct that file.Â  She also failed to create a new file for maintenance and management of documents generated and received in Grahamâ€™s case.\r\nRespondent admitted she did not take any action on Grahamâ€™s behalf following the PCR hearing.Â  She received a proposed order from opposing counsel in December 2001, but she did not send Graham a copy or determine the order was actually filed.Â  Respondent did not comply with Grahamâ€™s requests for copies of documents from his file, nor did she have any communication with him following the PCR hearing.Â  She did not advise him of his right to appeal.\r\nThe panel found respondentâ€™s lack of cooperation, her failure to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation, and her misrepresentations to the panel in her Answer in this matter all violated Rule 8.1, of Rule 407, SCACR.Â  The panel also found there is clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 by failing to maintain a client file for Graham, failing to take any action on his behalf following his PCR hearing, and failing to advise him of his right to appeal.Â  The panel stated that the lack of attention to Grahamâ€™s legal matter amounts to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(e).Â  The panel further found respondent failed to adequately communicate with Graham in violation of Rule 1.4 and improperly withdrew from representing him in violation of Rule 1.16.\r\nThe Allen Matter\r\nAt the hearing, Allen testified she paid respondent a $500 retainer to represent her in contempt proceedings she filed in connection with a child custody case.Â  From December 2002 to April 2003, Allen made numerous unsuccessful attempts to reach respondent by phone at her office and at home.Â  Respondent did not correspond with Allen about her case and missed an appointment with her.\r\nIn March 2003, respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  She did not produce Allenâ€™s client file to the attorney appointed to protect her clientsâ€™ interests upon her suspension.Â  Allenâ€™s file was not located, but the attorney was able to reconstruct it from loose mail located in respondentâ€™s office and from materials received from opposing counsel.Â  From the panelâ€™s review of the file it appeared respondent did not take any action on Allenâ€™s behalf other than an initial letter to opposing counsel proposing a settlement and a letter to the judge on the same date requesting a continuance.\r\nIn her Answer, respondent asserts she found Allenâ€™s client file in her office and that the attorney to protect client interests failed to properly perform his duties as trustee.Â  However, the panel noted respondent had failed to produce the file she claims to have located to Disciplinary Counsel.Â  The panel stated, given that fact, and because respondent did not appear at the hearing to present evidence to support her assertions in that regard, the matter would be resolved in favor of the attorney to protect client interests and the panel concluded that either no file was maintained for Allen or that respondent failed to turn it over to the attorney upon her interim suspension.\r\nThe panel found there is clear and convincing evidence that respondent failed to adequately communicate with Allen about her domestic matter; failed to provide even minimally competent or diligent representation of Allen; and failed to earn the fee she was paid. Accordingly, the panel found respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5, of Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nThe McRaye Matter\r\nMcRaye paid respondent $600 for a divorce.Â  McRaye testified respondent repeatedly put off the hearing and failed to diligently pursue his case.Â  He was unable to acquire information from respondent about the status of his case despite calls and visits to her office.Â  Ultimately, McRaye fired respondent and hired someone else.Â  McRaye had to pay his new attorney additional funds to complete tasks respondent had not done or redo tasks he was unable to confirm because respondent did not timely deliver his client file.\r\nThe panel found respondent failed to competently and diligently represent McRaye in violation of Rules 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, of Rule 407, SCACR.Â  The panel found she failed to adequately communicate with McRaye and his subsequent attorney in violation of Rules 1.4 and 1.16.Â  Finally, the panel found she violated Rule 1.5 by failing to earn the fee she charged in the case and by not refunding that fee.\r\nThe Matson Matter\r\nMatson retained respondent to represent her in a bankruptcy matter.Â  Matson paid $600 toward a $1,175 retainer on February 2, 1999.Â  Respondent did not deposit this fee into her trust account.Â  Although Matsonâ€™s fee payment had not been deposited in her trust account, respondent wrote a trust account check to the bankruptcy court for the $175 filing fee on February 5, 1999, and a second check for $175 for a subsequent filing on March 12, 1999.\r\nThe panel found there is clear and convincing evidence respondent failed to deposit Matsonâ€™s $600 payment into her trust account.Â  The panel noted it was unclear whether this payment was for attorneyâ€™s fees or costs.Â  In either case, respondent was required to hold the funds in trust.Â  The panel found the $350 used to pay filing fees for Matson was money held on behalf of one or more other clients.Â  Based on these findings, the panel found respondent violated Rule 1.15 in this matter.\r\nThe Trust Account Matter\r\nThe panelâ€™s review of respondentâ€™s Rule 19(c)(4) testimony revealed numerous violations of the trust accounting requirements. Â Since opening her solo practice, respondent failed to conduct monthly reconciliations of her trust account.Â  The panel found respondent did not reconcile the balance in her account, but simply compared her bank statements to her files or personal recollection of deposits.Â  Even that review by respondent was done sporadically.\r\nRespondent stated that prior to the fire in her office in May 2001, she maintained an accounting journal and client ledgers.Â  After her financial records were lost or destroyed as a result of the fire, respondent did not attempt to reconstruct those records.Â  She acknowledged that, at the time of the fire, her trust account contained money being held for clients, yet she did not make any attempt to determine who had how much on deposit.[3]\r\nFrom the date of the office fire until the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension, respondent did not maintain client ledgers or an accounting journal concerning transactions that occurred after the fire.Â  Additionally, she did not reconcile her trust account for that time period.\r\nIn her Answer, respondent states that in June 2001, she noticed excess money in her trust account.Â  She did not know where the funds came from, but stated â€œthey could not have come at a better time,â€ given the fire in her law office.Â  At that time, she began to use the money â€œas needed.â€Â  In December, respondent was notified by a lender that the source of the money was an inadvertent wire transfer into her trust account.Â  The lender demanded the return of the funds.Â  Respondent confirmed the balance in her trust account was sufficient to return the money to the lender.Â  She then returned the money without regard to whose money it actually was.Â  Respondent claimed she replaced some of the client funds used to repay the lender with the proceeds of a loan on her house; however, she did not produce any document to confirm this.\r\nIn October 2001, respondent received an insurance check in the amount of $21,672.54 for damages sustained in her office fire.Â  She deposited this check into her trust account.Â  Thereafter, respondent issued two checks to herself, two checks to a remodeling company, and several checks to various payees for furniture and office equipment.Â  The notations on these checks reference respondentâ€™s insurance proceeds.Â  On June 3, 2002, respondent wrote a third trust account check to herself with a reference to her insurance claim with no corresponding deposit.Â  Review of the bank statements revealed that, during that same period, respondent deposited no other checks from her insurance company and no other deposits that correspond to the payments respondent made to herself.Â  On June 12, 2002, respondent deposited an additional check from her insurance company in the amount of $1,636.30.Â  Respondentâ€™s total deposits of fire insurance claim proceeds into the trust account were $23,308.84 and her total disbursements referencing those proceeds were $39,202.47.\r\nIn her response to the Notice of Full Investigation in this matter, respondent stated she had considered whether depositing the insurance proceeds into her trust account was commingling.Â  She concluded it was not as she was â€œessentially handling an insurance matter forâ€ herself and she was â€œrepresentingâ€ herself.Â  The panel found this statement does not explain why she chose to deposit some of the insurance checks into her trust account and some into her operating account.Â  The panel also found that her statement does not explain why she did not keep a record of those funds or why she wrote checks from the trust account in excess of the deposits.Â  The panel stated it was unable to ask for an explanation because respondent did not appear at the hearing.\r\nThe panel found there is clear and convincing evidence respondent failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 417, SCACR, prior to the fire in her office.Â  The panel found respondent had violated Rule 1.15, of Rule 407, SCACR, and Rule 417 by failing to reconstruct even minimal documentation to determine whose funds she had in her trust account at the time of the fire.Â  The panel stated that, giving due consideration to the extreme difficulties respondent likely encountered following her office fire, they found the fact she made absolutely no attempt to maintain even minimally sufficient records of post-fire transactions for nearly two years to be misconduct rising to the level of blatant indifference to Rule 417.Â  In addition, the panel found respondent commingled her own funds with client funds when she deposited the insurance proceeds into her trust account.Â  The panel further found the issuance of checks in excess of those deposits amounted to misappropriation of $15,893.66.Â  The panel found that conduct violated Rules 8.4(b) and 8.4(d).\r\nThe panel considered mitigating and aggravating circumstances before determining the appropriate punishment to recommend for respondent.Â  As mitigating circumstances, the panel considered respondentâ€™s office fire, her reputation as an attorney, and the fact that she did not have any prior disciplinary history.\r\nAs aggravating circumstances, the panel considered (1) respondentâ€™s pattern of misconduct in failing to diligently pursue her clientsâ€™ legal matters, failing to communicate with her clients, and failing to maintain unearned fees and to safekeep client funds in the trust account; (2) her lack of full cooperation in the disciplinary investigation; (3) her experience as an Attorney to Assist charged with investigating allegations of attorney misconduct; (4) the egregiousness of respondentâ€™s conduct in using funds in her trust account for her own benefit; and (5) her failure to appear at the hearing.\r\nThe panel concluded that clear and convincing evidence warranted disbarment plus the costs of these proceedings.Â  In addition, the panel recommended the Court require respondent to make the following payments in restitution:Â  $446 to Jesse A. Jackson; $446 to Dedra Jackson; $500 to Michelle Allen; and $600 to Mingo McRaye.Â  The panel also recommended respondent be required to pay to the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection:Â  $350 for the unknown client funds used for Matsonâ€™s filing fees; $15,893.66 for the unknown client funds respondent used for fire losses and paid to herself; $2,288.88 for the funds paid to herself above the fee amount in the Grant matter; and any amount paid out by the Lawyersâ€™ Fund following respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  The panel noted respondent should receive credit for the amount that was paid to the Lawyersâ€™ Fund which represented the funds remaining in her trust account at the time of her interim suspension.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which discipline is given rests entirely with this Court.Â  In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).Â  The Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and is not bound by the panelâ€™s recommendation.Â  In re Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).Â  The Court must administer the sanction it deems appropriate after a thorough review of the record.Â  Id.\r\nGiven the facts of this case and taking into consideration discipline rendered in similar cases, the Panelâ€™s recommendation of disbarment is appropriate.Â  See, e.g., In re Chandler, 356 S.C. 288, 588 S.E.2d 610 (2003) (disbarment where attorney failed to cooperate with disciplinary counsel and appear at his hearing; failed to communicate with and act with due diligence for his clients; caused significant financial losses to his clients and former law partner; misappropriated funds; and engaged in misconduct involving dishonesty, deceit, and misrepresentation); In re Strickland, 354 S.C. 169, 580 S.E.2d 126 (2003) (disbarment where attorney failed to maintain integrity of trust account and operating account, misappropriated funds, and made certain misrepresentations to disciplinary counsel).\r\nAccordingly, we find respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants disbarment.Â  The disbarment shall be retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension. Â Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing she has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender her Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  Respondent is required to pay restitution to presently known and/or subsequently identified clients and other persons and entities who have incurred losses as a result of respondentâ€™s misconduct in connection with this matter.

Davis, 364 S.C. 364, 613 S.E.2d 760 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We vacate in part, reverse, and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nA jury convicted petitioner, Christopher F. Davis, of murder and armed robbery.Â  The victim was Paul Williams (â€œPaulâ€). Â On direct appeal, petitioner argued that the trial court erred by allowing Shawn Hicks, the Stateâ€™s key witness, to testify to statements made by Greg Hill.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that:Â  (1) the statements made by Hill were non-testimonial in nature, and therefore, pursuant to Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), there was no Confrontation Clause violation; (2) the statements fit within the excited utterance exception of the hearsay rule; and (3) even if erroneously admitted, any error was harmless.\r\nIn the early morning hours of April 18, 2000, Hicks was selling crack cocaine near Paulâ€™s house in Aiken. Â Hicks testified that he heard petitioner, Reggie Stevens, and Paul arguing. Â Hicks then heard a gunshot and saw three individuals running through the victimâ€™s backyard. Â Hicks identified Stevens as one of the men because he stumbled and fell, but Hicks could not identify the other two.Â  After hearing the gunshot, Hicks sold $70 worth of crack to Stevens and Hill. Â Hicks stated he normally sold drugs to Stevens, but that $70 was an unusually large purchase.Â  Hicks testified that he believed Stevens and Hill then went to a nearby abandoned house to smoke the crack and returned shortly thereafter with petitioner.[1]Â  Petitioner had a shotgun in a black bag and a bag of coins. Â According to Hicks, petitioner bought about $30 worth of crack from Hicks with the coins. \r\nAdditionally, Hicks testified that petitioner offered to sell him the shotgun.Â  The following colloquy occurred at trial: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       What, if anything, did anybody say to you to prevent you from buying [the shotgun]?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Well, he told me not to purchase the shotgun.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       Who told you?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.&nbsp;\r\n       Greg Hill.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAlthough petitioner objected to the admission of Hillâ€™s statement through Hicks on the ground he could not cross-examine Hill, the trial court ruled the statement admissible as a statement by a co-conspirator.Â  Later in his direct examination, Hicks again testified to Hillâ€™s statement, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n      [W]hat did Greg Hill tell you that night...?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       [Petitioner] and Reggie [Stevens] went in the house.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       All right. Did he say anything about Paul being shot or anything? Â Â \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yeah. Thatâ€™s why he told me not to get the shotgun.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       Because?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n      &nbsp;Paul had been shot with it.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHicks first told police about this incident when he was in jail at the Aiken County Detention Center on unrelated charges of strong armed robbery and drug distribution.Â  Petitioner and Hill were also in the detention center while Hicks was there.Â  Hicks testified that he and petitioner would write notes to each other while in jail.Â  The State admitted a note signed and dated by petitioner, but written in Hicksâ€™ handwriting.Â  Hicks read the note to the jury as follows:\r\n\r\nHey Chris the night that yaâ€™ll [sic] came and tried to sell me the shotgun, yaâ€™ll was [sic] coming from Paulâ€™s house and what I need to know from you who was the trigger man? Â I know it wasnâ€™t Greg from what he told me that night, so it had to be you or Reggie. Â You got the gun and Greg told you and Reggie who the one who went in the house, so who pulled the trigger? Â If Reggie did it you should write Reggieâ€™s name or if you did it, just sign your name at the bottom and Iâ€™ll help you out by writing that letter. Â Just write what you want me to tell them.\r\n\r\nThe letter is signed â€œChristopher Davisâ€ and dated â€œ3-15-01.â€[2]\r\nHicksâ€™ brother, Raymond â€œIkeâ€ Hicks, also testified.Â  Like his brother, Ike was out selling drugs the night of the shooting.Â  Ike stated that he heard â€œa little arguing and stuffâ€ from Paulâ€™s house and then a gunshot.Â  â€œA few minutes later, about 10, 15 - no, it was about 5 or 10 minutes later,â€ he saw a few people running from Paulâ€™s house.Â  About 10 to 20 minutes after the gunshot, Ike saw Stevens and Hill, and also saw petitioner talking to his brother.Â  Ike saw that petitioner had a gun in a bag and was asking Hicks if he wanted to buy it.Â  Ike further stated that Stevens had â€œchange and moneyâ€ and bought about $100 of crack cocaine from him in the time after Ike heard the gunshot.\r\nMarcus White testified that petitioner came to his house late one night with a gun asking if he could keep it at Whiteâ€™s house.Â  White gave petitioner â€œsome Clorox because he said he bought it from [Stevens] and he didnâ€™t want his prints on it.â€Â  White further stated that petitioner then â€œtook the gun in the back and hid it.â€Â  He never saw petitioner come back and get the gun.Â  \r\nAnother State witness, Calvin Marcel Patten, testified that he was â€œ[h]anging out, selling dopeâ€ on the night Paul was killed.Â  Patten stated that he heard a gunshot between one and two a.m. and saw three people run from behind Paulâ€™s house.Â  According to Patten, Stevens tripped over the fence while running from the house.Â  About 15 to 30 minutes after Patten heard the gunshot, he saw petitioner.Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, Patten also testified that he spoke and exchanged notes with petitioner while they were both in jail.Â  In one written exchange, when asked by petitioner if he had been promised anything, Patten replied that he was not promised anything, â€œbut was told that I could help myself with the case by helping them withâ€ petitioner.[3]Â  From the same note, Patten read the following:\r\n\r\nâ€œYes, I talked to Shawn Hicks.Â  Some of the things he wanted me to say on the stand when we were scheduled to come to court, I couldnâ€™t say because it was a lie and I didnâ€™t see [petitioner] with a gun.Â  Some of the things he wanted me to say was that I seen [petitioner] come through the fence and also he wanted me [to] say that I seen [petitioner] with a gun and that he shot Paul.â€\r\n\r\nPatten further testified that he saw Stevens with a pocket full of change, but he did not see a shotgun that night.Â  \r\nIn Paulâ€™s house, the police found the butt of a shotgun that had been wrapped in black electrical tape.Â  Coins were on the floor.Â  In front of Paulâ€™s house, a footprint was found in the dirt and a plaster cast was made by police; later in the investigation, the shoe print was matched to Stevensâ€™ Nike tennis shoes.Â  \r\nAt some point, petitioner, Stevens and Hill were all arrested for Paulâ€™s murder.[4]Â  Stevens told police he sold petitioner the shotgun.Â  Petitioner eventually admitted to police that he had bought the gun from Stevens, but he had thrown if off the side of a cliff.Â  The police, however, did not find the gun.\r\nIn his own defense, petitioner testified to the following.Â  On the night of the crime, he could not remember exactly where he was; he told the jury he was â€œabout 19, a teenager, just having fun and allâ€ and that he sold drugs at night.Â  He bought the gun from Stevens although he could not remember exactly when.Â  Petitioner stated that he gave Stevens $20 worth of crack for the gun which had a broken stock.Â  Petitioner decided the gun was not worth much, so he left it on the grass.Â  However, after the police told him they believed the gun had been used to murder Paul, petitioner saw Stevens who, according to petitioner, now wanted the gun back.Â  Petitioner testified that he thought Stevens â€œdone did [sic] somethingâ€ with the gun related to the murder, so petitioner wanted to get rid of the gun.Â  He threw the gun in the back of Whiteâ€™s house; then he wiped the gun down with Clorox and â€œthrew it off the cliff.â€Â  \r\nPetitioner further testified that while he and Hicks were in jail, Hicks had promised petitioner that he (Hicks) would write a statement telling authorities that police had forced him to falsely accuse petitioner.Â  Petitioner explained that he signed his name to a blank piece of paper and only later discovered that the â€œconfessionâ€ had been written in pencil above his signature.Â  Petitioner denied killing Paul.Â  \r\nByron Mathis, who was in jail with petitioner, testified that he remembered Hicks and petitioner exchanging notes in jail.Â  Mathis stated that he saw petitioner sign a blank piece of paper and slid it back to Hicks.Â  Mathis testified he told petitioner â€œhe was a foolâ€ to sign a blank piece of paper. \r\nThe jury convicted petitioner, and the trial court sentenced him to life without parole for murder, and 30 years consecutive for the armed robbery.[5]Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Davis, supra.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s admission of the hearsay statement made by Hill?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues the statement made by Hill to Hicks that the shotgun had been used to murder Paul was erroneously admitted hearsay.Â  Petitioner further contends the error was not harmless.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nNon-Testimonial Statement\r\nIn its opinion below, the Court of Appeals devoted an extended discussion to the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s 2004 decision in Crawford v. Washington.Â  The Court of Appeals explored the Crawford decision in depth including a discussion of scholarly articles written in the wake of Crawford.Â  In addition, the Court of Appeals analyzed numerous cases analyzing the impact of Crawford on such statements as those made:Â  (1) during 911 calls, (2) during police investigations, (3) by children, and (4) to family, friends, or acquaintances.Â  State v. Davis, 364 S.C. at 373-401, 613 S.E.2d at 765-80.Â  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals determined that Hillâ€™s statement to Hicks was non-testimonial, and therefore the rule of Crawford did not apply.Â  Given the fact that Hillâ€™s statement to Hicks clearly was made outside of an investigatory or judicial context, we agree the statement is non-testimonial.Â  However, because the overwhelming majority of the Court of Appealsâ€™ Crawford discussion does not relate to the precise issue in the instant case, we vacate that portion of the opinion.\r\nExcited Utterance Exception to Hearsay Rule\r\nThe Court of Appeals analyzed the hearsay issue pursuant to the rule of Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980). Â This rule allows admission of a hearsay statement if it falls within a â€œfirmly rooted hearsay exception.â€Â  Noting that the State conceded the trial court had erred by admitting the statement as a statement by a co-conspirator,[6] the Court of Appeals nevertheless agreed with the Stateâ€™s argument that the admission of Hillâ€™s statement should be upheld under the excited utterance exception.[7]Â  Davis, 364 S.C. at 402, 613 S.E.2d at 780.Â  Petitioner maintains this was error, and we agree.\r\nAn excited utterance is a â€œstatement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or conditionâ€ and may be admitted at trial as an exception to the hearsay rule.Â  Rule 803(2), SCRE. Â The rationale underlying the excited utterance exception is that â€œthe startling event suspends the declarantâ€™s process of reflective thought, reducing the likelihood of fabrication.â€ Â State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 284, 523 S.E.2d 173, 177 (1999).Â  \r\nA court must consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether a statement falls within the excited utterance exception.Â  Id.Â  Nonetheless, â€œthe burden of establishing the facts which qualify a statement as an excited utterance rests with the proponent of the evidence.â€Â  31A C.J.S. Evidence Â§ 359 (1996); accord Mariano v. State, 933 So.2d 111, 118 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006); Jarvis v. Commonwealth, 960 S.W.2d 466 (Ky. 1998); State v. Kemp, 919 S.W.2d 278, 280 (Mo. Ct. App. 1996) (â€œThe party offering the statement as an exception to the rule against hearsay has the burden of making a sufficient showing of spontaneity to render the statement admissible.â€).Â  Finally, statements which are not based on firsthand information, such as where the declarant was not an actual witness to the event, are not admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Â State v. Hill, 331 S.C. 94, 99, 501 S.E.2d 122, 125 (1998). \r\nAs applied to the instant case, we find there simply is insufficient evidence that Hillâ€™s statement is an excited utterance. Â The Court of Appeals relied heavily on the fact that â€œmurder is certainly a startling event.â€ Â Davis, 364 SC at 404, 613 S.E.2d at 781. Â In our opinion, however, relying on the fact that there was a murder, or that the statement was about the weapon used to commit the murder, is inadequate to establish excited utterance.\r\nIn Dennis, also a murder case, we found a hearsay statement properly admitted as an excited utterance.Â  There, the State elicited the following testimony: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q.\r\n       When you saw -- Iâ€™m going to call him Moses Otis Dennis -- when you saw Moses Otis Dennis, that was real shortly after the shooting, wasn't it?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, sir.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       You all were still all excited and everything, werenâ€™t you?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, sir.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       And [Otis] told you that his brother had shot [the victim] because [the victim] had taken a swing at his brother?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n      Uh huh.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q.&nbsp;\r\n       He said that, didnâ€™t he?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A.\r\n       Yes, sir.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n337 S.C. at 283, 523 S.E.2d at 176-77.Â  This Court characterized Otisâ€™s statement as an excited utterance explaining that Otis, a co-defendant, â€œallegedly had just seen his brother shoot an unarmed man, abruptly ending a fistfight. Â [The witness] testified Otis made the statement to him when he saw Otis one to two minutes after the shooting, tucking a gun beneath his shirt as he walked between apartment buildings.â€ Â Id. at 284, 523 S.E.2d at 177.Â  Therefore, we held that the statement fell within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule and did not violate the Confrontation Clause.Â  Id. at 288, 523 S.E.2d at 179.\r\nAlthough the instant case is somewhat similar to the facts in Dennis, the cases are distinguishable.Â  First, no evidence was elicited by the State that Hill was still under the stress or excitement of Paulâ€™s shooting.Â  Therefore, the State did not meet its burden of establishing a foundation for the excited utterance.Â  See Mariano v. State, supra; Jarvis v. Commonwealth, supra; State v. Kemp, supra; see also 31A C.J.S. Evidence Â§ 359 (1996) (â€œthe burden of establishing the facts which qualify a statement as an excited utterance rests with the proponent of the evidenceâ€).\r\nSecond, the evidence in the record does not support the conclusion that Hill witnessed the shooting.Â  According to Hicks, Hill stated that Stevens and petitioner had gone into Paulâ€™s house.Â  No one testified that Hill was in the house at the time of the shooting, and Hillâ€™s statement about the gun being used to shoot Paul does not establish he witnessed the murder.[8]Â  Because there is no evidence Hill actually saw Paul get shot, Hillâ€™s statement is not admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.[9] Â State v. Hill, supra. Â \r\nConsequently, we hold Hillâ€™s statement does not fall within the excited utterance exception to the rule against hearsay.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling the statement was admissible.\r\nHarmless Error\r\nThe Court of Appeals also concluded that any error was harmless.Â  Petitioner argues, however, that because of the abysmal credibility of Hicks, the admission of Hillâ€™s statement through Hicks could not be harmless.Â  In addition, petitioner points out that another State witness, Patten, testified that Hicks had asked him to testify falsely against petitioner.Â  Given the highly circumstantial nature of the Stateâ€™s case, as well as the credibility problems of all the main witnesses, we agree with petitioner that the error was not harmless.[10]\r\nA violation of a defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness is not per se reversible error; instead, this Court must determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Â State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 386, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994); see also State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985) (erroneous admission of hearsay evidence subject to harmless error analysis).Â  Moreover, whether an error is harmless depends on the particular circumstances of the case. Â State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151.Â  Error is only harmless â€œwhen it â€˜could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€™â€Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\nWe find the hearsay evidence admitted in the instant case almost certainly affected the result of the trial and therefore could not be harmless.Â  Hillâ€™s statement to Hicks was a crucial piece of evidence linking petitioner both to the scene of the crime and the murder weapon.Â  The scant physical evidence in this case includes a shoeprint which connected Stevens - not petitioner - to the scene.Â  Stevens was also the only person witnesses positively identified running from the scene.Â  Moreover, there are significant credibility problems with the fact witnesses (including petitioner).Â  All were involved with crack cocaine on the night in question and did not initially give informative statements to the authorities.Â  Often, cooperation with police on this investigation came only after several witnesses had been jailed on other charges and were facing prison time themselves.Â  In sum, because the hearsay statement was made by petitionerâ€™s co-defendant, the case involved mostly circumstantial evidence, and the dismal credibility of many of the witnesses, we hold the erroneous admission of Hillâ€™s statement through Hicks was not harmless.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding of harmless error and remand to the trial court for a new trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we vacate the portion of the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion discussing Crawford v. Washington.Â  See State v. Davis, 364 S.C. at 373-401, 613 S.E.2d at 765-80.Â  Additionally, we reverse the ruling that Hillâ€™s statement to Hicks was admissible as an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.Â  We also reverse the finding that any error by the trial court admitting the statement was harmless.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ decision is therefore\r\nVACATED IN PART; REVERSED; AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Hicks estimated his times during his testimony.Â  He stated that he saw petitioner â€œabout 5 to 10 minutesâ€ after the gunshot.Â  Therefore, according to Hicks, in five or ten minutes, he sold Stevens and Hill crack, they left to smoke the crack, and then returned with petitioner.\r\n[2] The State presented a handwriting expert who examined the note and opined that the signature and 3-15-01 were both in petitionerâ€™s handwriting.\r\n[3] After reading this part of the note, Patten explained as follows:Â  â€œSo basically I was told that the cases pending against me was [sic] not to worry about it because I was helping them.â€Â  \r\n[4] Petitioner was not tried with either of his co-defendants.\r\n[5] Petitioner was also convicted of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent offense, but the trial court imposed no sentence for this third offense.\r\n[6] See Rule 801(d)(2)(E) (a statement is not hearsay if it is admitted against a party and was made by a coconspirator of the party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy).Â  Although petitioner, Stevens, and Hill were all indicted for Paulâ€™s murder, there was no allegation or evidence of a conspiracy.\r\n[7] The Court of Appeals addressed this argument pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal).\r\n[8] In contrast, the Court of Appeals found the evidence supported â€œthe inferenceâ€ that Hill was present at the murder scene and had firsthand knowledge the shotgun had been used to kill Paul.Â  Davis, 364 S.C. at 405, 613 S.E.2d at 782.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis, however, does not take into account Hicksâ€™ specific testimony that Hill said only Stevens and petitioner went into the house.Â  The â€œjailhouse confessionâ€ note also reinforces that Hill told Hicks only Stevens and petitioner went into Paulâ€™s house.Â  We therefore reject the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion that the evidence supports the inference Hill witnessed the shooting.\r\n[9] Furthermore, because there is insufficient evidence Hill witnessed the shooting, the Stateâ€™s alternate argument that his statement was properly admitted under the present sense impression exception is without merit.Â  See Rule 803(1), SCRE (defining present sense impression as a â€œstatement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter.â€).\r\n[10] We note the State contends certiorari was improvidently granted because petitioner failed to separately challenge the Court of Appealsâ€™ harmless error analysis.Â  We disagree.Â  Petitioner maintained in the petition for rehearing to the Court of Appeals, as well as in the petition for a writ of certiorari, that the error by the trial court was not harmless.Â  The argument is also made in petitionerâ€™s brief to this Court.Â  The Appellate Court Rule regarding certiorari to the Court of Appeals states that â€œ[a] question presented will be deemed to include every subsidiary question fairly comprised therein.â€Â  Rule 226(d)(2), SCACR.Â  Because petitioner specifically raised a question regarding the admission of hearsay, a harmless error argument is â€œa subsidiary question fairly comprisedâ€ within that issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of O.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott and Assistant Attorney General Julie M. Thames, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nChief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the grant of post-conviction relief (PCR) to respondent Gary Wayne Bennett.Â  Because there is no evidence in the record to show that trial counsel offered inaccurate advice to respondent or was otherwise deficient, respondent failed to meet his burden of proving counsel was ineffective.Â  Therefore, we reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 19, 2001, respondent pled guilty to first degree burglary, and the trial court sentenced him to 18 years imprisonment.Â  Respondent had appeared before the trial court the day before and expressed that he had some â€œdifferencesâ€ with trial counsel.Â  The trial court inquired on July 19 whether counsel and respondent had resolved those differences.Â  Counsel and respondent both responded in the negative, and respondent â€œreiterate[d]â€ to the court that he did not â€œfeel [he was] going to get a fair trialâ€ with appointed counsel.Â  He therefore asked the trial court for some time so his family could hire â€œa private lawyer.â€Â  \r\nNoting that the offense occurred on December 25, 1999, the trial court did not grant respondent a continuance.[1]Â  Instead, the trial court asked whether he wanted to represent himself or go forward with appointed counsel.Â  Respondent did not want to proceed pro se, and he told the trial court â€œI just want the opportunity to have a paid attorney.â€Â  He explained that counsel was not â€œinterested in defendingâ€ him.Â  In response, counsel told the trial court there was another attorney who was familiar with the case, had been present at two of his meetings with respondent, and could be ready to represent respondent at trial in â€œ15 minutes time.â€Â  Respondent, however, was also not willing to have this other attorney from the Public Defenderâ€™s office represent him for trial.\r\nAt that point, the trial court gave respondent the option of one, or both, of the public defenders, or self-representation.Â  Respondent then privately spoke with his appointed counsel, and after conferring, counsel informed the trial court that respondent wanted to plead guilty.Â  On the record, respondent confirmed for the trial court his desire to enter a guilty plea.\r\nThe trial court went over the indictment for first degree burglary, explained that this felony is considered a violent, most serious offense, and informed respondent that it â€œcarries anywhere from 15 years to life.â€Â  When the trial court separately asked respondent if he understood the charge and the possible punishment, respondent replied in the affirmative.Â  After pleading guilty, the trial court then went over the constitutional rights respondent was waiving, including the right to a jury trial.Â  The trial court specifically asked respondent if he was satisfied with counselâ€™s â€œadvice about this plea,â€ and respondent said yes.[2]\r\nThe State explained to the trial court the facts surrounding the offense. Respondent and his then-girlfriend, Amber Vrooman, had entered the victimâ€™s vacation condominium in Surfside Beach during the nighttime hours; respondent had access to the condo because he worked a pest control job.Â  The pair took a television, a vacuum cleaner, and a VCR.Â  Vrooman was also charged in the case.Â  According to the State, Vrooman had been the person who informed police about the case after she and respondent had an â€œaltercationâ€ and she was willing to testify as a Stateâ€™s witness to the facts of the crime.Â  The trial court sentenced respondent to 18 years.\r\nRespondent did not appeal, but he filed for PCR.Â  In his PCR application, respondent alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and that his Sixth Amendment right to â€œcounsel of choiceâ€ had been revoked.Â  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, respondent testified that he first met with counsel in September 2000 for his bond hearing and then did not meet with him again until January 2001.[3] Â In June 2001, respondent again met with counsel, and, according to respondent, counsel told him he could get him 15 years in a plea bargain with the solicitor.Â  Respondent testified he told counsel he did not want to plead guilty because he had not committed first degree burglary; according to respondentâ€™s PCR testimony, he was not in the condo in the nighttime, but rather was there at eight in the morning.Â  Significantly, respondent further testified that counsel told him if he went to trial and was found guilty, the trial judge would sentence him to life imprisonment.\r\nThe PCR court found:Â  (1) respondent had not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a direct appeal; and (2) counsel was ineffective.Â  The PCR court granted respondent a new trial.\r\nISSUE[4]\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err in granting respondent a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State argues the PCR court erred in finding that respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective in advising respondent to plead guilty.Â  We agree.\r\nThere is a two-prong test for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Â The first prong of the test requires that a defendant show that his counselâ€™s performance was deficient such that it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); Alexander v. State, 303 S.C. 539, 402 S.E.2d 484 (1991). Â The second part of the test requires a defendant to show there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.Â  Id.Â  Where there has been a guilty plea, the applicant must prove prejudice by showing that, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability he would not have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial. Â Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985); Alexander v. State, supra.Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a] defendant who pleads guilty upon the advice of counsel may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea by showing the advice he received from counsel was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.â€ Â Richardson v. State, 310 S.C. 360, 363, 426 S.E.2d 795, 797 (1993). \r\nIn determining guilty plea issues, it is proper to consider the guilty plea transcript as well as evidence at the PCR hearing. Â Harres v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 318 S.E.2d 360 (1984).Â  This Court will uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of probative value to support them.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). Â The Court, however, will not uphold the findings when there is no probative evidence to support them. Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nWe find the PCR court erred in finding that counsel was deficient.Â  Both the plea transcript and respondentâ€™s testimony at the PCR hearing clearly indicate that counsel did consult with respondent and advised him that he should enter a guilty plea.Â  Taking respondentâ€™s version of events, counsel specifically stated that if respondent went to trial and a jury found him guilty, he would get a life sentence.[5]Â  Thus, counsel advised respondent to plead guilty based, at least in part, on the likelihood of what counsel believed the sentence would be.Â  We find that this is not an inappropriate concern for counsel to communicate to his client.Â  Cf. Wade v. State, 698 S.W.2d 621, 623 (Mo. Ct. App. 1985) (where appellant claimed his guilty plea was not voluntary because counsel told him he would receive a life sentence if he went to trial, the court rejected the claim, stating that â€œ[c]ounsel should discuss with clients the potential results of trial, and life imprisonment was a possible sentence on both chargesâ€ against appellant). Â \r\nIndeed, counselâ€™s advice that respondent would have gotten a life sentence was not technically incorrect because life is the maximum sentence for first degree burglary.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(B) (2003) (first degree burglary â€œis a felony punishable by life imprisonmentâ€); see also Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 361, 495 S.E.2d 773, 776 (1998) (where counselâ€™s advice regarding possible maximum sentence was correct, the Court held that counselâ€™s performance was not deficient or ineffective); Wade v. State, 698 S.W.2d at 623 (counsel should discuss the potential results of trial with clients).[6]\r\nMoreover, while respondent certainly subjectively believed that counsel was unprepared for trial, respondentâ€™s own testimony at the PCR hearing also established that the two primary fact witnesses at trial would have been him and Vrooman.Â  Because any trial would essentially be respondentâ€™s word against Vroomanâ€™s, there can be no claim that counsel should have further investigated the case to discover other evidence or witnesses.Â  Finally, it is evident from the plea transcript that counsel was willing to go to trial, or would have allowed his associate from the Public Defenderâ€™s office to try the case, but respondent obviously wanted a privately retained attorney.\r\nRespondent simply did not meet his burden of proving the first prong of the Strickland test.Â  E.g., Bannister v. State, 333 S.C. 298, 509 S.E.2d 807 (1998) (the applicant has the burden of proving the allegations of the PCR petition).Â  In order for respondent to get relief, he must demonstrate it was because of counselâ€™s deficiency that he was induced to plead guilty.Â  What respondent did prove, however, is the following:Â  (1) he wanted to go to trial, but only with a private attorney; (2) the trial court did not grant him a continuance to allow his family more time to hire a private attorney; and (3) after conferring with counsel, he decided to enter a guilty plea.Â  It appears that respondentâ€™s real argument on PCR is that the trial court should have granted respondentâ€™s request for a continuance to enable him to retain private counsel.Â  Trial error, however, â€œdoes not constitute an appropriate basis for a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.â€ Â Wolfe v. State, 326 S.C. 158, 162 n.2, 485 S.E.2d 367, 369 n.2 (1997); cf. Richardson v. State, supra (where a defendant pleads guilty, he may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea by showing the advice he received from counsel was not competent).Â  Here, although the PCR court did find respondent was entitled to a belated appeal, respondent did not request review of that finding from this Court. Â See Rule 227(i)(1), SCACR. Therefore, respondent has abandoned any direct appeal issues.\r\nWe hold there is no probative evidence in the record that counsel deficiently advised respondent to plead guilty; accordingly, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s grant of a new trial.Â  See Holland v. State, supra (this Court will not uphold the findings of the PCR court when there is no evidence of probative value to support them).Â  \r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Actually, respondent was not arrested until July 2000; nonetheless, he had been incarcerated for over one year by the time of the plea.\r\n[2] Additionally, when the trial court made its on-the-record finding that respondentâ€™s plea was â€œfreely, voluntarily, and intelligently made,â€ the trial court specifically noted that although respondent had â€œsome disagreementsâ€ with counsel, respondent was â€œsatisfied with [counselâ€™s] advice concerning this plea.â€\r\n[3]  At this time, respondent also had a pending murder charge, and respondent testified that they discussed matters related to the murder charge but did not discuss the first degree burglary charge at issue in the instant case.Â  \r\n[4] We note there is no belated direct appeal issue before the Court because respondent did not file for review as required by the Appellate Court Rules.Â  See Rule 227(i)(1), SCACR (when the PCR court has affirmatively found that the right to a direct appeal was not knowingly and intelligently waived, a petition for a writ of certiorari shall contain a question raising this issue; in addition, a brief addressing the direct appeal issues shall be served and filed); Davis v. State, 288 S.C. 290, 291 n.1, 342 S.E.2d 60 (1986) (even where the PCR court makes a finding that the right to a direct appeal was not knowingly and intelligently waived, the PCR court â€œmay not grant relief on this basis;â€ instead, the PCR applicant must petition this Court for review).\r\n[5] Counsel testified at the PCR hearing that respondent never told him the burglary did not occur in the nighttime and that Vrooman was ready to take the witness stand for the State on the day respondent entered his plea.Â  Finally, counsel testified that he thought it was in respondentâ€™s best interest to plead guilty because if respondent went to trial and was convicted, he would not have been surprised at a life sentence.Â  According to counsel, he told respondent that the trial court â€œmay very wellâ€ sentence him to life imprisonment if he went to trial; counsel denied telling respondent that the trial court would sentence him to life.Â  The PCR court, however, obviously believed respondentâ€™s testimony because it specifically found counsel told respondent that if he was convicted, he would be given a life sentence by the trial judge.Â  That determination is entitled to deference.Â  Solomon v. State, 313 S.C. 526, 529, 443 S.E.2d 540, 542 (the Court gives great deference to a PCR courtâ€™s findings when matters of credibility are involved).\r\n[6] Regardless, even where counsel offers misinformation, this deficiency can be cured where the trial court properly informs the defendant about the sentencing range.Â  See Wolfe v. State, 326 S.C. 158, 485 S.E.2d 367 (1997) (even if counsel gives erroneous advice, an applicant is not entitled to PCR where any misconceptions are cured by the colloquy during the guilty plea proceeding); Burnett v. State, 352 S.C. 589, 576 S.E.2d 144 (2003) (any possible misconceptions on PCR applicantâ€™s part were cured by the colloquy during the plea proceeding); see also Moorehead v. State, 329 S.C. 329, 333, 496 S.E.2d 415, 416 (1998) (â€œthe transcript of the guilty plea hearing will be considered to determine whether any possible error by counsel was cured by the information conveyed at the plea hearingâ€).Â  Here, the trial court clearly told respondent that the sentence for first degree burglary â€œcarries anywhere from 15 years to life.â€Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26231","title":"James v.

Orr, of Orr, Elmore &amp; Ervin, LLC, of Florence, for Appellant.\r\nKevin M. Barth, of Ballenger, Barth &amp; Hoefer, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  In this action, a jury found Horace Mann Insurance Company (Appellant) liable for bad faith related to the handling of an insurance claim and awarded actual and punitive damages to Russell and Teresa James (Respondents).Â  Appellant appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), new trial, or new trial nisi remittitur as to punitive damages.Â  Appellant also appeals the trial courtâ€™s admission of evidence regarding Respondentsâ€™ lost wages and attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  We certified the case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and we affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn the early 1980s, Respondents purchased a homeownerâ€™s insurance policy from Appellant through its agent, Ronald Wilson.Â  In 2000, Appellant sent a renewal notice to Respondents which included a new endorsement for liability coverage for animal bites.Â  The endorsement provided coverage for liability arising out of animal bites, with several exclusions, and limited the coverage to $25,000 per occurrence.Â  Respondents renewed their homeownerâ€™s insurance policy, including the animal bite liability coverage, in 2000, 2001, and 2002.Â  \r\nOn August 2, 2002, James D. Geiger was bitten by Respondentsâ€™ dog and was hospitalized due to injuries arising out of the bite.Â  Respondents subsequently submitted a claim to Appellant under their homeownerâ€™s insurance policy to cover Geigerâ€™s damages.Â  Appellant assigned the matter to a claims adjuster, Bruce Garner (Adjuster).Â  On August 16, 2002, Adjuster contacted Geiger and told Geiger that there was a medical payments coverage, which was immediately payable.Â  Adjuster also told Geiger that Respondents had liability coverage for animal bites up to $25,000, but denied Geiger could collect under that coverage without further proof.Â  \r\nGeiger hired an attorney and sued Respondents for damages arising out of the dog bite.Â  Settlement negotiations failed and the case went to trial.Â  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 47-3-110 (1987) imposes strict liability on a dog owner for damages arising out of a dog bite when the victim is lawfully on the ownerâ€™s property, except when the victim provokes the dog.Â  A jury returned a verdict against Respondents and awarded Geiger $50,500 in damages. Â Appellant paid $25,000 of the judgment and Respondents paid the remaining $25,500.\r\nRespondents filed this action against Appellant and Wilson[1] alleging seven causes of action including, inter alia, a declaratory judgment to determine the liability coverage under their homeownerâ€™s insurance policy for injuries arising out of a dog bite, breach of contract, negligence, and bad faith.Â  At trial, Respondents testified when they submitted Geigerâ€™s claim to Appellant, they believed the applicable coverage under their homeownerâ€™s insurance policy was the general personal liability coverage.Â  Respondents testified that prior to submitting Geigerâ€™s claim they were unaware their homeownerâ€™s insurance policy included a specific coverage for liability arising out of animal bites.Â  Respondents also testified Wilson never advised them of this liability coverage for animal bites. \r\nGeiger testified Adjuster told him that under Respondentsâ€™ homeowner insurance policy, Geiger must prove negligence to recover any amount beyond the medical payments coverage.Â  Geiger also testified he would have accepted a settlement offer prior to hiring an attorney and he would not have hired an attorney if Adjuster had told him the correct law and agreed to cover his medical bills and lost wages.Â  Geigerâ€™s attorney and Respondent Russell James also testified Adjuster took the position that Geiger must prove negligence before he could recover from Respondents.Â  Adjuster testified Geiger had to prove he did not provoke the dog to recover damages from Respondents.Â  \r\nRespondent Russell James testified he believed Adjuster, and thus Appellant, had mishandled the insurance claim by refusing to pay Geigerâ€™s medical bills and lost wages without proof of Respondentsâ€™ negligence.Â  He further testified he felt Appellant had mishandled the claim by encouraging Geiger to sue Respondents.\r\nThis action was submitted to a jury on the following causes of action:Â  negligence on the part of Wilson for failing to advise Respondents of the animal bite liability coverage and bad faith on the part of Appellant in handling the claim.Â  The jury found Wilson was not liable to Respondents.Â  The jury also found Appellant was liable for bad faith and awarded $146,600 actual damages and $1,000,000 punitive damages to Respondents.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in finding the punitive damages award did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA motion for new trial nisi remittitur asks the trial court to reduce the verdict because the verdict is merely excessive.Â  See Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993). Â The denial of a motion for a new trial nisi is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  If the amount of the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive so as to be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, or some other influence outside the evidence, the trial court must grant a new trial absolute.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for a new trial nisi remittitur as to punitive damages.Â  Appellant contends the trial court did not conduct a proper post-verdict review of the punitive damages award as required by Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991), and BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe practice of awarding punitive damages\r\noriginated in principles of criminal law â€œto deter the wrongdoer and others from committing like offenses in the future.â€Â  Laird v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 388, 393, 134 S.E.2d 206, 210 (1964) (internal citation omitted).Â  Because\r\npunitive damages are quasi-criminal in nature, the process of assessing punitive damages is subject to the protections of the Due Process\r\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.Â  Atkinson v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 361 S.C. 156, 164, 604 S.E.2d 385, 389 (2004); see also Gore, 517 U.S. at 568, 116 S.Ct. at 1595, 134 L.Ed.2d at 822 (â€œThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State from imposing a grossly excessive punishment on a tortfeasor.â€) (internal quotations omitted).Â  \r\nIn Gamble, this Court developed an eight factor post-verdict review that trial courts are required to conduct to determine if a punitive damages award comports with due process.Â  The United States Supreme Court has also set forth three guideposts that trial courts must apply to an award of punitive damages to determine whether the award violates due process.Â  Gore, 517 U.S. at 575, 116 S.Ct. at 1598-99, 134 L.Ed.2d at 826.\r\nThe trial court conducted a post-verdict review of the punitive damages award to determine whether the award violated due process.Â  The trial court found Appellantâ€™s degree of culpability was significant based on evidence of Adjusterâ€™s false statement to Geiger regarding the applicable law for dog bite cases.Â  The trial court also found Adjusterâ€™s conduct began the time the claim was assigned to him and continued throughout trial, and the court determined Appellant attempted to conceal Adjusterâ€™s wrongful behavior through the last day of trial.Â  The trial court further found the punitive damages award was 6.82 times the amount of actual damages and determined this ratio was reasonable.Â  Appellant stipulated it had the financial resources to satisfy a substantial judgment against it; therefore, the trial court found Appellantâ€™s ability to pay was not at issue.Â  Based on this review, the trial court determined the punitive damages award of $1,000,000 was reasonable and was not the result of passion, prejudice, or improper influence.Â  The trial court concluded there was no violation of due process.\r\nA. Gamble Factors\r\nThe Gamble factors are: (1) defendantâ€™s degree of culpability; (2) duration of the conduct; (3) defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment; (4) the existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the award will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7) defendantâ€™s ability to pay; and (8) other factors deemed appropriate.Â  Gamble, 305 S.C. at 111-12, 406 S.E.2d at 354.Â  The trial court is not required to make a finding of fact for each Gamble factor to uphold a punitive damages award. Â McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys.,\r\n 321 S.C. 340, 346, 468 S.E.2d 633, 637 (1996).Â  Further, the amount of damages, actual or punitive, remains largely within the discretion of the jury, as reviewed by the trial court.Â  Gamble, 305 S.C. at 112, 406 S.E.2d at 355. Â \r\nThe trial court properly conducted a post-verdict Gamble review.Â  The evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that Appellantâ€™s misconduct was extremely culpable.Â  Geiger, Geigerâ€™s attorney, and Respondent Russell James testified Adjuster misrepresented the applicable law to Geiger.Â  There is also evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s findings that Appellant continuously misrepresented the law and denied coverage under Respondentâ€™s insurance policy based on this misrepresentation from the time the claim was submitted until the end of trial.Â  The punitive damages award comports with due process under Gamble.Â  \r\nB.Â  Gore Guideposts\r\nAlthough we find the punitive damages award was reasonable under the Gamble factors, we must also review the trial courtâ€™s ruling on punitive damages under Gore.Â  A trial court shall review the constitutionality of a punitive damages award by determining whether the award was reasonable under the following guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendantâ€™s misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual and potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.Â  Gore, 517 U.S. at 575, 116 S.Ct. 1598-99, 134 L.Ed.2d at 826; see, e.g., Atkinson, 361 S.C. at 166-71, 604 S.E.2d at 390-93 (applying guideposts).Â  An appellate court reviews de novo the trial courtâ€™s application of the guideposts.Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 418, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 1520, 155 L.Ed.2d 585, 601 (2003) (citing Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 431, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 1683, 149 L.Ed.2d 674, 683-84 (2001)).\r\n\r\n(1)Â  Degree of Reprehensibility of Appellantâ€™s Misconduct\r\n\r\nAppellantâ€™s conduct was extremely reprehensible.Â  Adjuster, acting on behalf of Appellant, repeatedly falsely represented the applicable law from the time he was assigned the claim, through Geigerâ€™s action against Respondents, and through Respondentsâ€™ action against Appellant.Â  There is evidence in the record that Appellant denied the claim based on this false misrepresentation and that Geiger sued Respondents based on this misrepresentation.Â  \r\n\r\n(2)Â  Disparity Between Actual and Punitive Damages Award\r\nIn Campbell, the United States Supreme Court explained:Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[W]e have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on\r\nthe ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  punitive\r\ndamages award. Â We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed. Â Our Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit\r\nratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.\r\n\r\n538 U.S. at 424-25, 123 S.Ct. at 1524, 155 L.Ed.2d at 605-06 (internal citations omitted). Â The Campbell Court also determined: â€œSingle-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the Stateâ€™s goals of deterrence and retribution. . . .â€Â  Id. at 425, 123 S.Ct. at 1524, 155 L.Ed.2d. 606.Â  The punitive damages award in this case, which was 6.82 times the actual damages award, was reasonably related to the actual harm suffered.Â  See also Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 466 S.E.2d 727 (1996) (upholding punitive damages award that was approximately 28 times the actual damages award amount); Collins v. Entertainment Corp. v. Coats &amp; Coats Rental Amusement, 355 S.C. 125, 584 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 2003) (affirming punitive damages award that was 10 times the amount of the actual damages award).Â  \r\nFurthermore, although a substantial portion of the actual damages award was nonpecuniary, these damages compensated Respondents for their injuries and were awarded to make Respondents whole.Â  See Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (â€œThe purpose of actual or compensatory damages is to compensate a party for injuries suffered or losses sustained.Â  The goal is to restore the injured party, as nearly as possible through the payment of money, to the same position he or she was in before the wrongful injury occurred.â€).Â  In comparison, the punitive damages award was a form of punishment and a deterrent to Appellant.Â  See id. at 378, 529 S.E.2d at 533 (â€œThe purposes of punitive damages are to punish the wrongdoer and deter the wrongdoer and others from engaging in similar reckless, willful, wanton, or malicious conduct in the future.â€).Â  Under these facts and circumstances, we find no portion of the actual damages award was duplicated in the punitive damages award.Â  Compare Campbell, 538 U.S. at 426, 123 S.Ct. at 1525, 155 L.Ed.2d at 606 (finding compensatory damages, which included a large amount for emotional distress that was caused by outrage and humiliation, were likely based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive damages award).Â  \r\n\r\n(3) Difference Between Civil Penalties and Punitive Damages Award\r\n\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-2-10 (2002), the director of the Department of Insurance may impose the following administrative penalties on an insurer for each violation of the insurance laws: (1) a fine not to exceed $15,000 if the conduct was not willful or a fine not to exceed $30,000 if the conduct was willful; (2) suspend or revoke the violatorâ€™s authority to do business in the state; or (3) both.Â  We find the statutory penalties are set at â€œsuch a low level, there is little basis for comparing it with any meaningful punitive damage award.â€ Â Collins, 355 S.C. at 142, 584 S.E.2d at 129 (citing BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 701 So.2d 507, 514 (Ala. 1997)).Â  The punitive damages award was reasonable; was not the result of passion, caprice, or prejudice; and does not violate due process under Gore. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the denial of Appellantâ€™s motion for a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  We also affirm Appellantâ€™s remaining issues pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  Issue 1: Â Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 27-28, 602 S.E.2d 772, 782 (2004) (an appellate court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for JNOV only where there is no evidence to support the ruling below); and Issues 2 and 3:Â  Washington v. Whitaker, 317 S.C. 108, 114, 451 S.E.2d 894, 898 (1994) (to preserve an issue regarding the admissibility of evidence for appellate review, a contemporaneous objection must be made); McCreight v. MacDougall, 248 S.C. 222, 226, 149 S.E.2d 621, 622 (1966) (failure to object when evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to have the issue considered on appeal).Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Although Geiger was originally named a party to this action, he was dismissed after his judgment against Respondents was satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
