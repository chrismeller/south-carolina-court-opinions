McCulley, of\r\nHaskins Law Firm, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J.: On appeal is a family court order requiring, in\r\npertinent part, Petitioner Deborah Ann Pool (\"Wife\") to pay certain attorney's\r\nfees and costs to Respondent William R. Pool (\"Husband\"). The Court of\r\nAppeals affirmed. Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 467 S.E.2d 753 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nThis Court granted certiorari. We affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 3\r\n\r\nPOOL v. POOL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the Court of Appeals, Wife argued error in the award of\r\nattorney's fees and private investigator costs because husband failed to raise\r\nthem in his pleadings. The Court of Appeals, without specifically ruling on\r\nthis issue, affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR,1 finding the family court\r\nwas entitled to award the fees and costs as sanctions under the South\r\nCarolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act (\"FCPSA\").2 Pool, 321\r\nS.C. at 91, 467 S.E.2d at 757-58. Wife argues the Court of Appeals erred in\r\naffirming under the FCPSA because it was not a ground appearing in the\r\nrecord on appeal. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the FCPSA, a person who procures, initiates, continues, or\r\ndefends any civil proceeding may be assessed attorney's fees and court costs\r\nif she (1) does so \"primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the\r\nproper ... adjudication of the claim upon which the proceedings are based;\"\r\nand (2) the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person seeking the\r\nsanction. Â§ 15-36-10. The person \"must be considered to have acted to\r\nsecure a proper purpose\" under certain circumstances. Â§ 15-36-20 .3 Most\r\npertinent to the issue here, the Act provides for the following procedure:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the essential elements of this chapter have been\r\n  established as provided in Section 15-36-10, a person is entitled\r\n  to recover his attorney's fees and court costs reasonably incurred\r\n  in litigating the proceedings. The entitlement of the aggrieved\r\n  person must be determined by the trial judge at the conclusion\r\n  of a trial upon motion of the aggrieved party stating the\r\n  manner in which the other party is alleged to have acted in\r\n  violation of this statute. The court shall base its decision upon\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n1 \"The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order or judgment upon\r\n\r\nany ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-36-10 to -50 (Supp. 1996) (unamended since\r\nenactment in 1988). Specific sections are hereinafter cited as \"Â§ 15-36-XX.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3These circumstances include \"if he reasonably believes in the existence\r\nof the facts upon which his claim is based and (1) reasonably believes that\r\nunder those facts his claim may be valid under the existing or developing\r\nlaw; or (2) relies upon the advice of counsel, sought in good faith and given\r\nafter full disclosure of all facts within his knowledge and information which\r\nmay be relevant to the cause of action ...... Â§ 15-36-20.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 4\r\n\r\nPOOL v. POOL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  a review of the proceedings and affidavits submitted by each\r\n  person affected.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 15-36-30 (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Act does not allow a judge to invoke its provisions sua sponte; it\r\nclearly requires a proper motion to be made by the aggrieved party. Here,\r\nthe record contains no argument made by Husband that Wife's claim was\r\nfrivolous. Rather, the evidence indicates the frivolous issue was brought up\r\nby the judge. Moreover, nowhere in the record, including the judge's order,\r\nis there a mention of the FCPSA. Finally, regarding the award of private\r\ninvestigator costs, the FCPSA only allows for the granting of \"attomey's fees\r\nand court costs\" as sanctions, not other types of costs or fees. Â§ 15-36-10; -30\r\n(emphasis supplied). Therefore, because the evidence in this record would not\r\nallow an appellate court to conclude the award was proper under the\r\nprovisions of the FCPSA, the Court of Appeals erred in affirming on this\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we find the Court of Appeals erred in affirming under the\r\nFCPSA, we nonetheless affirm the award because the record supports a\r\nfinding the issue of attorney's fees and costs as sought by both parties was\r\nproperly before the family court. While Husband did not specifically request\r\nattorney's fees and costs in his initial pleadings, he did file a motion to\r\namend his pleadings which was ultimately granted by the trial judge.\r\nEvidence regarding these issues was admitted at the full merits hearing.4 \r\nSee Rule 15(b), SCRCP5 (\"If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground\r\nthat it is not within the issue made by the pleadings, the court may allow\r\nthe pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of\r\nthe merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party\r\nfails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice\r\nhim in maintaining his action or defense on the merits.\").\r\n\r\n\r\nThe focal inquiry in allowing amendment of pleadings is whether doing\r\nso will prejudice the opposing party. See Soil &amp; Material Eng'rs, Inc. v. Folly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 While initially the trial judge sustained Wife's objection to the\r\n\r\nintroduction of evidence regarding private investigator's costs, at the end of\r\nthe hearing he requested a statement of these and other costs from both\r\nparties. There is no evidence in the record showing Wife objected to this, or\r\nthat she argued she would be prejudiced by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n5This rule is applicable to family court hearings. Rule 2(a), SCRFC.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 5\r\n\r\nPOOL v. POOL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssocs., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"Simply\r\nbecause an amendment to conform to proof was made late in the trial affords\r\nno basis for holding that the amendment comes too late. The question is one\r\nof prejudice to the opposing party.\"). See also Foggle v. CSX Transp.. Inc.,\r\n315 S.C. 17, 23, 431 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1993) (\"It is well established that a\r\nmotion to amend is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and\r\nthat the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice\");\r\nBall v. Canadian Am. Express Co., 314 S.C. 272, 275, 442 S.E.2d 620, 622\r\n(Ct. App. 1994) (\"Motions to amend pleadings to conform to proof may be\r\nmade upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment, and are\r\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial Judge. Ordinarily, amendments to\r\nconform to proof should be liberally allowed.\").\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his order, the trial judge found Wife was not prejudiced by his\r\nadmitting the evidence or considering the issue. Indeed, Wife has not argued\r\nor shown any prejudice resulting from the judge's allowing the evidence or\r\namendment.6 See Ball, 314 S.C. at 275, 442 S.E.2d at 622 (\"Prejudice occurs\r\nwhen the amendment states a new claim or defense which would require the\r\nopposing party to introduce additional or different evidence to prevail in the\r\namended action\"). See also 6A Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp;\r\nProcedure Â§ 1495 (2d ed. 1990) (\"To justify the exclusion of the evidence, the\r\nrule contemplates that the objecting party must be put to some serious\r\ndisadvantage\"). The prejudice Rule 15 envisions is a lack of notice that the\r\nnew issue is going to be tried, and a lack of opportunity to refute it. Folly\r\nAssocs., 293 S.C. at 501, 361,S.E.2d at 781 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"In considering\r\npotential prejudice to the opposing party, the court should consider whether\r\nthe opposing party has had the opportunity to prepare for the issue now\r\nbeing raised formally.\").\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the judge found, Wife knew well before trial that Husband was\r\nseeking attorney's fees and costs.7 Therefore, because Wife cannot show\r\nprejudice from the trial court's granting Husband's motion to amend, and in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Her brief to the Court of Appeals discusses prejudice in one sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Clearly, the Husband's last minute attempt to plead the fees and cost issue\r\nwas prejudicial to the Wife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n7The pre-trial order, filed more than a year before trial, specifically\r\nstated, \"The request for attorney's fees and costs sought by both parties will\r\nbe carefully considered by the Court at the full merits hearing of this case.\"\r\n\r\n\r\np. 6\r\n\r\nPOOL v. POOL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlight of Rule 15's \"bias in favor of granting amendments,\"8 we affirm the\r\naward of attorney's fees and costs in this case. See 6A Federal Practice &amp;\r\nProcedure Â§ 1491 (Rule 15(b) \"intended to promote the objective of deciding\r\ncases on their merits rather than in terms of the relative pleading skills of\r\ncounsel\").\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nhereby\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and BURNETT, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 Forrester v.

Kolb, of Sumter,\r\nfor respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J.: Appellant, Russell Collins, was convicted of\r\naccessory after the fact of murder. We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 25, 1990, James \"Buster\" Osborne was shot and killed while\r\n\r\n\r\np. 8\r\n\r\nSTATE v. COLLINS\r\n\r\n\r\nworking at his Greeleyville convenience store in Williamsburg County.\r\nCollins, who lived down the street from the store, gave two different versions\r\nof the shooting. In one version, he and his friend, Keith Houston, stopped\r\nat the store to buy snacks for work the next morning. As they drove up,\r\nthey heard a gunshot and saw a man run out from the store putting what\r\nappeared to be a gun in his pocket. They went in and found Osborne had\r\nbeen shot; Collins ran to his uncle's house next door and advised Osborne\r\nhad been shot.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his second version, Collins told police he and Houston had gone into\r\nthe store to buy snacks when, unbeknownst to Collins, Houston pulled out a\r\ngun, demanded money, and shot Osborne. Collins maintained he had not\r\nknown the shooting was going to occur and had not participated in the crime.\r\nNonetheless, and notwithstanding his claim that he was unaware Houston\r\nplanned to rob and shoot Osborne, Collins \"covered\" for him. Collins told\r\npolice he was scared and Houston had convinced him he needed to make up\r\na story, \"cause if you don't, then you gone go to jail too, cause you know they\r\ngone say you helped me do it. I'm a say you helped me do it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollins was indicted for attempted armed robbery, murder, possession\r\nof a weapon during a violent crime and accessory after the fact of murder.\r\nAt the close of the State's case, the trial judge granted a directed verdict on\r\nall charges except accessory after the fact of murder. The jury convicted him\r\nof this charge, and he was sentenced to 15 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Was Collins entitled to a directed verdict since the only evidence\r\n  of his guilt showed he was present at the time of the shooting\r\n  and therefore, under existing South Carolina law, could not be\r\n  guilty as an accessory after the fact?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorically, the elements of accessory after the fact of a crime have\r\nbeen: (1) the felony has been completed; (2) the accused must have knowledge\r\nthat the principal committed the felony; and (3) the accused must harbor or\r\nassist the principal felon. State v. Hodge, 278 S.C. 110, 292 S.E.2d 600\r\n(1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 910, 103 S.Ct. 217, 74 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982);\r\nState v. Nicholson, 221 S.C. 399, 70 S.E.2d 632 (1952). However, in State v.\r\nPlath, 277 S.C. 126, 284 S.E.2d 221 (1981) cert. denied 467 U.S. 1265 (1984),\r\na defendant charged with capital murder asserted error in the trial court's\r\n\r\n\r\np. 9\r\n\r\nSTATE v. COLLINS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefusal to charge the jury on accessory after the fact. Citing the elements of\r\nState v. Nicholson, supra, this Court stated, \"[t]he accessory's absence at\r\nthe time the crime was actually committed is necessarily implied from\r\nthe above definition and is an essential element of the offense.\" 277 S.C.\r\nat 139, 284 S.E.2d at 228 (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequent to Plath, in State v. Whitted, 279 S.C. 260, 262, 305 S.E.2d\r\n245, 246 (1983), we reiterated that \"one element of accessory after the fact\r\nis the absence of the accused at the scene of the crime -- the accused's\r\ninvolvement begins after the crime is accomplished.\"1 Most recently, in State\r\nv. Hudgins, 319 S.C. 233, 460 S.E.2d 388 (1995) cert. denied 116 S.Ct. 821\r\n(1996), we stated that since the appellant therein admitted being present\r\nwhen the murder was committed, he was not entitled to a charge on\r\naccessory after the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear from a reading of Plath, Hudgins, and Whitted that the\r\nresult in those cases was based on the fact that there was evidence adduced\r\nat trial which demonstrated participation in the actual commission of the\r\nsubstantive offense of murder.2 There is, however, a distinction between\r\nbeing present and participating in the crime, and being merely present\r\nduring commission of the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted by McAninch and Fairey, The Criminal Law of South\r\nCarolina, p. 368 (3rd. Ed. 1996), \"[i]t is entirely conceivable that one could be\r\npresent at the scene of a crime committed by another, without any prior or\r\ncontemporary contact with or encouragement of the other in the criminal\r\nactivity but subsequently offer such assistance as would render him an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The Whitted Court, finding evidence to support either murder or\r\n\r\naccessory, rejected the defendant's claim that the trial court was required to\r\naccept her plea to accessory after the fact. However, nothing in the opinion\r\nindicates that the only evidence was that the defendant was \"merely present\"\r\nbut not participating in commission of the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n2 In Plath, the statement of facts specifically indicates that \"[a]ll four\r\npersons [including Plath] at one time or another participated in the physical\r\nabuse of the victim.\" 277 S.C. at 131, 284 S.E.2d at 224. Again, in Hudgins,\r\nthis Court's statement of facts indicates the defendant confessed to being the\r\ntriggerman, and \"admitted to stealing the truck and being involved in a\r\nseries of unlawful acts which culminated in the murder.\" 319 S.C. at 237,\r\n460 S.E.2d at 390. Under these facts, it is clear that, if guilty at all, Plath\r\nand Hudgins were guilty as principals.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 10\r\n\r\nSTATE v. COLLINS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccessory after the fact.\" See also 1 Wharton's Criminal Law, Â§ 33, pp. 197-\r\n98 (15th Ed. 1993) (although an accessory is not ordinarily present when the\r\nfelony was committed, his absence is not required. Thus a person who was\r\npresent when a felony was committed, but in no way aided or abetted its\r\ncommission-- and hence did not qualify as a principal ... may become an\r\naccessory after the fact by rendering aid to the felon thereafter in order to\r\nfacilitate his escape); State v. Hawkins, 326 Md. 270, 604 A.2d 489 (1992)(one\r\nwho, although present at the time of the commission of a felony, takes no\r\naction sufficient to constitute that person being a principal may nevertheless\r\nbe an accessory after the fact if he subsequently assists the felon with the\r\nintent to hinder the felon's detection); Buckley v. State of Mississippi, 511\r\nSo.2d 1354, 1358 (Miss. 1987); Walker v. State, 204 N.E.2d 850 (Ind. 1965)\r\ncert. denied 382 U.S. 991 (1966); Smith v. United States, 306 F.2d 286 (D.C.\r\nCir. 1962).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe concur with the law espoused by these authorities. It is untenable\r\nto suggest that a defendant who is \"merely present\" at the scene of a crime\r\nmay not be convicted as an accessory if he thereafter aids the perpetrator to\r\ncover it up or escape from the crime. The mere fact of one's \"presence\" at\r\nthe time of commission of the substantive offense is insufficient to relieve him\r\nof liability as an accessory. Accordingly, we modify existing case law to\r\nrecognize that absence is not an essential element of the offense of accessory\r\nafter the fact and that \"mere presence\" at the scene will not preclude an\r\naccessory verdict where the defendant becomes involved after commission of\r\nthe substantive offense. To the extent Plath, Whitted. and Hudgins are\r\ninconsistent with this modification, they are overruled.3\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, under the law as set forth in Plath, Hudgins, and Whitted,\r\nthe only evidence of Collins' guilt indicates he was, in fact, present at the\r\ntime the murder was committed. As \"absence\" was an essential element of\r\nthe crime of accessory after the fact of murder at the time the crime was\r\ncommitted here, Collins was entitled to a directed verdict.4 Accordingly, his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 We granted the State's petition to argue against the precedent of\r\n\r\nPlath, Hudgins, and Whitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 To apply a new rule altering the elements of the offense to Collins\r\nwould result in an ex post facto/due process violation. See Griffin v. State,\r\n315 S.C. 285, 433 S.E.2d 862 (1993) cert. denied 510 U.S. 1093 (1994);\r\nElmore v. State, 305 S.C. 456, 409 S.E.2d 397 (1991) (change in law which\r\nalters elements of offense or increases punishment results in ex post facto\r\nviolation). Although the ex post facto clause itself does not apply to actions\r\n\r\n\r\np. 11\r\n\r\nSTATE v. COLLINS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconviction for accessory after the fact of murder is\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and BURNETT, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the judicial branch, judicial decisions applied retroactively can violate the\r\n\r\nDue Process Clause. An unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal\r\nstatute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an ex post facto law.\r\nBouie v.

On March 7, 1996, the trial judge closed a\r\nbond hearing for attorney Mark Evans. Evans was charged with felony\r\ndriving under the influence, reckless homicide, murder, and leaving the\r\nscene of an accident. This case was being closely followed by the media\r\nand general public. Following the closed hearing, Evans was released on a\r\nbond of $125,000 contingent on house arrest daily from 9:00 p.m. till 6:00\r\na.m., random drug testing, and counseling.\r\n\r\nPrior to the closed hearing, the trial judge stated he had\r\nspoken with the attorneys for the State and Evans in chambers. He then\r\nstated he believed information which may come out at the bond hearing\r\nmay be prejudicial and inadmissible at trial. The trial judge denied\r\nWCIV-TV News Channel Four's (WCIV's) motion to allow public access.\r\nWCIV requested a continuance which was also denied. After the closed\r\nhearing, WCIV filed a written motion seeking a full evidentiary hearing on\r\nthe issue of closure; attendance at all proceedings in this case; and\r\nrecision of orders limiting press access. Alternatively, WCIV requested a\r\ntranscript of the closed bond hearing. On March 21, 1996, WCIV and\r\nappellant Evening Post Publishing Company (Post Courier) filed a notice of\r\nappeal of the trial judge's oral order. A written order was issued on May\r\n13, 1996. In his written order, the trial judge denied the press access to\r\ntranscripts of the closed hearing and entered a gag order on those persons\r\nwho were present at the closed hearing. Finally, the trial judge stated a\r\n\r\np. 4\r\n\r\nEX PARTE: FIRST CHARLESTON CORPORATION\r\n\r\nSTATE V. EVANS\r\n\r\ntranscript of the hearing would not be made available until after Evans'\r\ntrial or when it would no longer prejudice him. WCIV and Post-Courier\r\nappealed.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial judge err in closing the hearing to the public?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nDuring the closed hearing, the State presented evidence that\r\nfive days after the accident and two days after Evans was initially\r\nreleased on a $5,000 bond, blood and urine analysis by SLED revealed\r\nthat Evans had used cocaine within the previous forty-eight hours. The\r\nState argued Evans was a danger to the community because he had used\r\ncocaine after he was released on bond without restrictions. Evans did not\r\ndispute this information. In fact, he proposed that he be placed on house\r\narrest, his driving restricted, and a higher bond set.\r\n\r\nIn Ex parte Island Packet, 308 S.C. 198, 417 S.E.2d 575\r\n(1992), we addressed whether the family court erred in denying appellants\r\naccess to transcripts of two hearings held in a juvenile matter and closing\r\na pending hearing in the same case. We applied the United States\r\nSupreme Court's decision in Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of\r\nCalifornia, 478 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986)( Press-\r\nEnterprise II) wherein the United States Supreme Court set out the\r\nanalysis to be applied in determining whether the first amendment\r\nrequires public access to a criminal proceeding when the accused opposes\r\nit. The threshold inquiry is whether there exists a right of access to the\r\nparticular type of proceeding in question. Press-Enterprise II, 106 S. Ct. at\r\n2740. There is a presumption of openness applied to preliminary pre-trial\r\nhearings. Id.1 \r\n\r\nSecondly, to justify closure, the court must make specific\r\nfindings that closure is \"essential to preserve higher values and is\r\n\r\n\r\n1While Press-Enterprise II \"dealt only with a preliminary hearing, the\r\n\r\n[U.S. Supreme] Court's reasoning appears applicable to a wide range of\r\npretrial hearings, including ball hearings, suppression hearings, and the\r\nevidentiary hearings held on various motions (e.g., change of venue).\" 2\r\nW. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure Â§ 22.1 at 271 (2d ed. Supp.\r\n1991).\r\n\r\np. 5\r\n\r\nEX PARTE: FIRST CHARLESTON CORPORATION\r\n\r\nSTATE V. EVANS\r\n\r\n\r\nnarrowly tailored to serve that interest.\" Where the accused asserts his\r\nright to a fair trial to justify closure, the court must make specific findings\r\n(1) that there is a substantial probability of prejudice from publicity that\r\nclosure would prevent and (2) there are no reasonable alternatives to\r\nclosure that would adequately protect the defendant's fair trial rights.\r\nPress-Enterprise (II), 106 S.Ct. at 2743. Whether a trial judge erred in\r\nclosing a hearing depends on the particular facts of each case. Further,\r\nthrough voir dire, a trial judge could identify those jurors whose prior\r\nknowledge would disable them from rendering an impartial verdict. Id.\r\n\r\nHere, the trial judge stated he was closing the bond hearing\r\nbecause publicity of the information regarding Evans' drug usage following\r\nthe accident \"most probably would have prejudiced [Evans] or influenced\r\npublic opinion\" and the evidence would probably be inadmissible at trial.\r\nThe trial judge then ruled he did not know of any other alternatives.\r\nHowever, the trial judge could have used voir dire to determine any jurors\r\nwho may have been prejudiced by the information disclosed during the\r\nhearing. Further, the record does not support a finding of a substantial\r\nprobability of prejudice from publicity since extensive details had already\r\nbeen disclosed in the press regarding the defendant and the crime with\r\nwhich he was charged.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the trial judge did not make any specific findings\r\nof fact as set forth in Island Packet and Press-Enterprise (II). In several\r\ncases, we have vacated orders closing hearings when the trial judge has\r\nfailed to set forth specific findings on the record. See eg. Ex parte\r\nColumbia Newspapers, Inc., 286 S.C. 116, 333 S.E.2d 337 (1985)(family\r\ncourt's conclusory statement that openness would have an adverse effect\r\nupon rehabilitation is not a sufficient finding); Ex parte Columbia\r\nNewspapers, Inc., 281 S.C. 52, 314 S.E.2d 321 (1984)(general statements\r\nthat potential jurors would be biased if exposed to information are not\r\nspecific findings); Steinle v. Lollis, 279 S.C. 375, 307 S.E.2d 230\r\n(1983)((trial judge must make specific findings on record).\r\n\r\nWe take this opportunity to admonish the bench and bar that\r\nthe procedures we set forth in Island Packet, supra, and reiterate in this\r\nopinion, must be followed for a trial judge to properly order-the closure of\r\na hearing. Because the trial judge did not follow the procedure set forth\r\nin Island Packet and did not make specific findings of fact on the record\r\nas required, the order of the trial judge is\r\n\r\nVACATED.\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\np. 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24736","title":"Ex parte First Charleston:  State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy, Attorney\r\nGeneral Teresa Nesbitt Cosby, Assistant Attorney General\r\nAllen Bullard, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\nBurnett, A.J.: Appellants appeal the trial court's summary dismissal of their petitions\r\n  for writs of habeas corpus claiming then should have been granted a hearing on the\r\n  petitions. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 1976, appellants were convicted of murder and were sentenced to\r\n  confinement for life. They did not appeal their convictions.\r\nOn August 21, 1995, appellants filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus.\r\n\r\np. 10\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE\r\n\r\npro se, alleging previous post-conviction relief (PCR) applications were denied, the\r\n  allegations contained in this habeas petition were not presented at PCR, and habeas\r\n  corpus is their only avenue of redress. In the petitions, appellants claim they were\r\n  denied a fair trial because the trial court gave an erroneous presumption of malice\r\n  jury instruction which impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the\r\n  prosecution to them.\r\nThe trial judge dismissed these petitions on September 1, 1995, without holding a\r\n  hearing to determine the sufficiency of the allegations. In his Order, the trial judge\r\n  found appellants' claims should have been addressed on direct appeal or in a PCR\r\n  hearing, and habeas corpus was not a substitute for these remedies. We granted\r\n  appellants' petitions for certiorari.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court err in summarily dismissing appellants' petitions\r\n  for writs of habeas corpus?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe purpose of habeas corpus is to test the legality of the prisoner's\r\npresent detention. McCall v. State, 247 S.C. 15, 145 S.E.2d 419 (1965). The only\r\nremedy that can be granted is release from custody. Id.\r\n\r\nA habeas corpus petition must support the requested relief. Hunter v.\r\nState, 316 S.C. 104, 447 S.E.2d. 203 (1994). Although the allegations in the \r\npetition are to be treated as true. Tillman v. Manning, 241 S.C. 221, 127 S.E.2d 721 \r\n(1962), the petition must make out a prima facie case showing petitioner is entitled \r\nto relief. Welch v. MacDougall, 246 S.C. 258, 143 S.E.2d 455 (1965); Crosby v. \r\nState, 241 S.C. 40, 126 S.E.2d 843 (1962). Petitioner must present sufficient factual \r\nallegations to support the petition. Hayes v. State, 242 S.C. 328. 130 S.E.2d 907 \r\n(1963). It must allege petitioner has exhausted all other remedies, and it must set out \r\na constitutional claim that meets the standard delineated in Butler v. State, 302 S.C. \r\n466, 397 S.E.2d 87, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 972, 111 S.Ct. 442, 112 L.Ed.2d 425 \r\n(1990).1 If the petition, on its face, meets these requirements, petitioner is entitled to \r\na hearing.\r\n\r\nThe availability of habeas corpus has been severely, limited by the\r\n\r\n\r\n1Not every constitutional error at trial will justify issuance of a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus. Butler, supra. This writ will only issue when there has been a \"violation,\r\nwhich. in the setting, constitutes a denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the\r\nuniversal sense of justice.\" Id.\r\n\r\np. 11\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nUniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 to \r\n17-27-120 (Law. Co-op. 1976 &amp;, Supp. 1995) (Act). The Act \"takes the place of all \r\nother common law, statutory, or other remedies heretofore available for challenging \r\nthe validity of the conviction or sentence. It shall be used exclusively in place of \r\nthem.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(b) (1976). Thus, this Act supersedes and \r\nencompasses the habeas corpus procedure provided by statute. See S.C. Code Ann. \r\nÂ§Â§ 17-17-10 to 17-17-200 (Law. Co-op. 1976). However. habeas corpus continues to \r\nbe available as a constitutional remedy provided a petitioner qualifies for this \r\nextraordinary relief and clears the procedural hurdles. See S.C. Const. art. 1, Â§ 18; \r\nBaskins v. Moore, 362 F. Supp. 1 87 (D.S.C. 1973) (finding the Act is a procedural \r\ndevice and does not supplant the constitutional right to seek habeas corpus nor does \r\nit unconstitutionally suspend that right).\r\n\r\nHabeas corpus is available only when other remedies, such as PCR, are\r\ninadequate or unavailable. See Baskins v. Moore, 362 F. Supp. 187, 192 n.5 (D.S.C.\r\n1973); Stirone v. Markley, 345 F.2d 473 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 829, 86\r\nS.Ct. 67, 15 L.Ed.2d 73 (1965); Leitchman v. Singletary, 674 So.2d 889 (Fla. Ct. \r\nApp. 1996) (PCR procedure supersedes habeas corpus so long as PCR is adequate to \r\ntest legality of detention); Wiglesworth v. Wyrick, 531 S.W.2d 713 (Mo. Sup. Ct. \r\n1976) (PCR rule encompasses the habeas corpus relief sought by petitioner, and the \r\nclaim should be brought under the PCR procedures); 18 Am. Jur. 2d, Coram Nobis  \r\nÂ§ 46 (1985). The Act is broadly inclusive and will rarely be inadequate or \r\nunavailable to test the legality of the detention. A habeas corpus petition may be \r\ntreated as a PCR application. Hunter v. State, supra (construing a habeas corpus \r\npetition as a PCR application).\r\n\r\nA petitioner may allege constitutional violations in PCR proceedings, see\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(1) (1976), unless the issue could have been raised by\r\ndirect appeal. See State v. Simmons, 264 S.C. 417, 215 S.E.2d 883 (1975); S.C. \r\nCode Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(b) (1976). A violation found to be unconstitutional after the \r\ntime for appeal lapses is not a direct appeal issue and is not barred from PCR \r\nconsideration. See Twitty v. Maass, 773 P.2d 1336 (Or. Ct. App. 1989) (PCR \r\nproceeding is proper forum for claim based on chance in constitutional law between \r\ntime of direct appeal and PCR application: therefore, habeas corpus relief was not \r\navailable). However, a petitioner who does not raise an issue which could have been \r\nraised in a prior PCR hearing will waive his right to raise this issue in a subsequent \r\napplication. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-90 (1976).\r\n\r\nProcedurally, a petitioner seeking habeas corpus must first exhaust all\r\navailable PCR remedies. Pennington v. State, 312 S.C. 436, 441 S.E.2d 315 (1994).\r\nExhaustion includes filing of an application, the rendering of an order adjudicating \r\nthe issues, and petitioning for, or knowingly waiving, appellate review. Further, \r\npetitioner must allege sufficient facts to show why other remedies, such as PCR, are \r\nunavailable\r\n\r\np. 12\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nor inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe petitions herein do not satisfy these requirements. The petitions\r\ncontain no allegation that PCR remedies have been exhausted nor any factual\r\njustification why other remedies, such as PCR, were unavailable or inadequate; thus,\r\npetitioners fail to allege sufficient facts entitling them to a habeas corpus hearing.\r\nTherefore, these petitions should be treated as PCR applications.\r\n\r\nBecause petitioners are attempting to raise an issue not raised in their\r\nprior PCR applications, we remand to the lower court so that petitioners may have \r\nthe opportunity to show why their applications should not be dismissed as \r\nsuccessive. Petitioners will bear the burden to prove a sufficient reason why the \r\npresent claims were not raised in their previous applications. Aice v. State, 305 S.C. \r\n448, 409 S.E.2d 392 (1991). If they are unable to meet their burden of proof, the \r\napplications may be dismissed as successive. Further. if petitioners can show upon\r\n  remand that PCR is unavailable, all other remedies have been exhausted, and the \r\nissues raised now could not have been raised in their prior PCR applications. the \r\nlower court may treat the applications as habeas petitions and provide a hearing on \r\ntheir constitutional claim.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24738","title":"Jack Simpson v.

Tiffin, all of\r\nColumbia, for respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellant Jack Simpson pled guilty to second\r\ndegree arson and entered guilty but mentally ill pleas, pursuant to North\r\nCarolina v. Alford,1 to first degree burglary, assault with intent to kill, and\r\npossession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\r\nAppellant did not appeal his pleas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter, appellant filed an application for post-conviction\r\nrelief (PCR). The PCR judge granted the application and vacated\r\nappellant's burglary conviction. The State appealed, and this Court\r\nreversed. Simpson v. State, 371 S.C. 506, 455 S.E.2d 175 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant next filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\r\nthis Court's original jurisdiction which was dismissed pursuant to Key v.\r\nCurrie.2 Appellant then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the\r\ncircuit court. The circuit court judge granted the State's motion to dismiss\r\nthe petition on the ground that habeas corpus may not be used as a\r\nsubstitute for an action under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act.\r\nAppellant asserts the ruling of the circuit judge was erroneous. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt common law, the writ of habeas corpus was available after\r\nconviction only to attack the jurisdiction of the court that had imposed\r\nsentence. The rule was stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is fundamental that habeas corpus is a collateral remedy,\r\n  subject to the limitations common to collateral proceedings, and\r\n  calls in question only the jurisdiction of the court whose\r\n  judgment is challenged. It is only when a judgment of\r\n  conviction or sentence imposed is void, and not merely\r\n  voidable, that relief may be had by habeas corpus.... And the\r\n  jurisdiction of a court to render a particular judgment or\r\n  impose a particular sentence may be a proper subject of\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n1 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d (1970).\r\n\r\n2 305 S.C. 115, 406 S.E.2d 356 (1991).\r\n\r\n\r\np. 15\r\n\r\nSIMPSON v. STATE, ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  inquiry on habeas corpus. Where, for example, it appears upon\r\n  the face of the record that a court having jurisdiction both of\r\n  the person and of the subject-matter has imposed an excessive\r\n  sentence, that is, one by which a greater punishment is\r\n  inflicted than the maximum allowed by law, and where it\r\n  further appears that the prisoner, at the time of his application\r\n  for habeas corpus, has served out the maximum term of\r\n  imprisonment to which the court had power to sentence him,\r\n  according to the prevailing rule and the better doctrine, so\r\n  much of such sentence as is excessive will be declared void,\r\n  and the prisoner discharged on habeas corpus.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nEx Parte Klugh, 132 S.C. 199, 128 S.E. 882 (1925)(citations omitted). The\r\nuse of the writ to inquire into the legality of a conviction was, however,\r\ngreatly expanded in this State in the late 1950's and 1960's, apparently in\r\nresponse to decisions of the United States Supreme Court related to\r\nwhether state procedures for providing relief for violations of constitutional\r\nrights were adequate to meet the exhaustion requirement for federal\r\nhabeas corpus. See Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9\r\nL.Ed.2d 770 (1963); Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed.\r\n469 (1953); Young v. Ragen, 337 U.S. 235, 69 S.Ct. 1073, 93 L.Ed. 1333\r\n(1949). See also Case v. Nebraska, 381 U.S. 336, 85 S.Ct. 1486, 14\r\nL.Ed.2d 422 (1965). In South Carolina, the number of reported opinions in\r\nappeals in habeas matters increased from approximately fourteen in the\r\ntwenty years from 1930 to 1950 to approximately 70 in the years from\r\n1950 to 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1966, the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws\r\npromulgated the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act (Uniform Act).\r\nThe Comment to the Uniform Act states that the Uniform Act was\r\nwritten, in part, \"to bring together and consolidate into one simple statute\r\nall the remedies, beyond those that are incident to the usual procedures of\r\ntrial and [appellate] review, which are at present available for challenging\r\nthe validity of a sentence of imprisonment.\" Uniform Post-Conviction\r\nProcedure Act (1966) (U.L.A.) Â§ 1 Comment. The Uniform Act\r\nencompassed the relief available under the common law writ of habeas\r\ncorpus, the relief available under the expansion of the writ, and the relief\r\navailable by collateral attack under any common law, statutory or other\r\nwrit, motion, petition, proceeding, or remedy. Id. Â§ l(a)(6). South\r\nCarolina adopted its version of the Uniform Act in 1969. S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n\r\n\r\np. 16\r\n\r\nSIMPSON v. STATE, ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n17-27-10 to -1203 (the Act).\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 17-27-20(b) states that the Act \"comprehends and takes\r\nthe place of all other common law, statutory or other remedies heretofore\r\navailable for challenging the validity of the conviction or sentence,\" and\r\nprovides the Act \"shall be used exclusively in place of them.\" We\r\nacknowledge we have stated that habeas corpus is available once the\r\npetitioner has exhausted all post-conviction remedies. Hunter v. State,\r\n316 S.C. 105, 447 S.E.2d 203 (1994); Pennington v. State, 312 S.C. 436,\r\n441 S.E.2d 315 (1994); Slack v. State, 311 S.C. 415, 429 S.E.2d 801 (1993).\r\nIn Tyler v. State, 247 S.C. 34, 145 S.E.2d 434 (1965), however, this Court\r\nstated that habeas corpus cannot be used as a substitute for appeal or\r\nother remedial procedure for the correction of errors for which a criminal\r\ndefendant had an opportunity to avail himself. Because we believe the\r\nrule in Tyler is the appropriate rule, we now hold that a matter which is\r\ncognizable under the Act may not be raised by a petition for a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus before the circuit or other lower courts.4 See Gibson v.\r\nState, Op. No. 24737 (S.C. filed, January 12, 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are not unaware of art. 1, Â§ 18 of the South Carolina\r\nConstitution which states that the writ of habeas corpus may not be\r\nsuspended except when, in case of insurrection, rebellion or invasion, the\r\npublic safety may require it. However, our action today does not suspend\r\nthe writ, but merely curtails its use to those situations where the Act\r\nwould not be applicable. Tyler v. State, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, the allegations raised in appellant's habeas corpus\r\npetition clearly are cognizable under the Uniform Act. Accordingly, the\r\nPCR judge properly dismissed the petition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act has since been amended\r\n\r\nin ways not relevant to this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Under art. V, Â§ 5 of the South Carolina Constitution, this Court\r\nretains the ability to entertain writs of habeas corpus in our original\r\njurisdiction and grant relief in those unusual instances where \"there has\r\nbeen a violation which, in the setting, constitutes a denial of fundamental\r\nfairness shocking to the universal sense of justice.\" Butler v. State, 302\r\nS.C. 466, 397 S.E.2d 87,(1990); see also Simmons v. State, __S.C.__,\r\n471 S.E.2d 455 (1992); Key v.

Taylor, Appellant, appeals the circuit court's\r\norder granting summary judgment in favor of Respondents Richland Memorial\r\nHospital and Baptist Healthcare System of South Carolina (Baptist). We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 19\r\n\r\nTAYLOR v. RICHLAND MEMORIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nRichland Memorial is a political subdivision of Richland County.\r\nBaptist is a non-governmental, non-profit corporation. Both operate hospital and\r\nhealth care facilities in Richland County. Richland Memorial and Baptist have\r\nentered into an agreement creating BR Health System, Inc. (System) as a new non-\r\ngovernmental, non-profit corporation which will take over and operate the hospital\r\nfacilities of both parties. Richland Memorial and Baptist will convey substantially\r\nall of their operating assets to the System; Richland Memorial, Baptist, and\r\nRichland County will lease to the System all land and buildings involved in\r\nhospital operations; and Richland County will quitclaim to the System any personal\r\nproperty owned by Richland County and used to operate Richland Memorial. The\r\nSystem will pay rent under the leases, assume all financial and other obligations\r\nof Richland Memorial and Baptist, and assume Richland County's obligations for\r\nindigent health care. Richland County Council approved the agreement by\r\nOrdinance No. 044-96HR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant filed a declaratory judgment action in circuit court to\r\ndetermine whether the proposed alliance between Richland Memorial and Baptist\r\nis permissible under Article X, Â§ 11 of the S.C. Constitution. All parties filed\r\nsummary judgment motions. Following a hearing, the circuit court denied\r\nAppellant's motion for summary judgment and granted the hospitals' motions for\r\nsummary judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sole issue before this Court is whether the ordinance approving the\r\nproposed alliance between Richland Memorial Hospital and Baptist Healthcare\r\nviolates Article X, Â§ 11 of the South Carolina Constitution?\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. X, Â§ 11 provides in pertinent part: \"Neither the State\r\nnor any of its political subdivisions shall become a joint owner of or stockholder in\r\nany company, association, or corporation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant contends the agreement creates a joint venture in violation\r\nof Article X, Â§ 11 because under the proposed alliance a governmental body will be\r\ntransferring taxpayer assets to a private corporation over which the government\r\nwill have a vote but not control of the assets. Appellant reasons that once\r\nRichland Memorial invests substantial assets it will lose absolute control of those\r\nassets which will then be controlled according to the joint operating agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle X, Â§ 11 prohibits governmental entities from becoming either\r\n1) a joint owner of or 2) a stockholder in a private company, association, or\r\ncorporation.1 Not every joint endeavor between a public entity and private business\r\nis constitutionally prohibited. See Gilbert v. Bath, 267 S.C. 171, 227 S.E.2d 177\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The circuit court found Richland Memorial's membership in the System would\r\nnot violate the stock ownership aspect of Article X, Â§ 11 and Appellant concedes\r\nthis is not an issue in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 20\r\n\r\nTAYLOR v. RICHLAND MEMORIAL\r\n\r\n\r\n(1976); Chapman v. Greenville Chamber of Commerce, 127 S.C. 173, 120 S.E. \r\n584 (1923). We have approved arrangements where governmental entities leased \r\nassets to private entities without finding a violation of the joint ownership clause.\r\nJohnson v. Piedmont Mun. Power Agency, 277 S.C. 345, 287 S.E.2d 476 (1982);\r\nGilbert v. Bath, supra; Chapman, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held Richland Memorial's involvement with the\r\nSystem as a lessor of real property, transferor of personal property, or member in\r\nthe System does not violate the joint ownership clause. Further, the circuit court\r\nconcluded that because Richland County will not be liable for the System's\r\nobligations and the System will not have the powers to tax and to pledge the full\r\nfaith and credit of any political entity, this alliance does not create a risk that any\r\nlosses will be shifted to the public. We agree. Richland Memorial will not retain\r\na partial interest in the personal property because it will quitclaim to the System.\r\nThe System will have exclusive title to the assets following the transfer. The real\r\nproperty lease agreement between the System, Richland County, and Richland\r\nMemorial to be executed at closing describes the relationship as that of landlord\r\nand tenant. While Richland Memorial will be represented on the BR System's\r\nboard, Richland Memorial will not have control over the System's operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intent of Article X, Â§ was to \"prevent the state from entering into\r\nbusiness hazards which might involve obligations upon the public.\" Chapman,\r\nsupra. There is no evidence the proposed alliance will run afoul of this\r\nconstitutional provision.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit court properly found the county ordinance approving the\r\nalliance does not violate Article X, Â§ 11. See Bolt v. Cobb, 225 S.C. 408, 82 S.E.2d\r\n789 (1954)(legislative enactment will not be held unconstitutional unless it is\r\nclearly improper beyond a reasonable doubt).\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 21\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24740","title":"Edgar Payton v.

Batson Challenge\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner challenges respondent's use of his peremptory strikes\r\nunder Batson supra, claiming the strikes were racially motivated. We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of\r\nthe United States Constitution prohibits the use of peremptory strikes in a\r\ndiscriminatory manner. Id. This prohibition applies in civil cases as well\r\nas criminal cases. Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 111\r\nS.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991); Chavous v. Brown, 299 S.C. 398, 385\r\nS.E.2d 206 (Ct. App. 1989), rev'd, 302 S.C. 308, 396 S.E.2d 98 (1990),\r\nvacated, 501 U.S. 1202, 1 11 S.Ct. 2791, 115 L.Ed.2d 966, aff'd on remand,\r\n305 S.C. 387, 409 S.E.2d 356 (1991). A party has standing to object to\r\nrace-based peremptory strikes of venire persons even if the challenging\r\nparty and the potential juror are not of the same race. Powers v. Ohio,\r\n499 U.S. 400, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991); State v. Dyar, 317\r\nS.C. 77, 452 S.E.2d 603 (1994).\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth petitioner and respondent are black. Respondent\r\nexercised all of his peremptory strikes to remove prospective white jurors.\r\nPetitioner requested a Batson hearing. After hearing respondent's reasons\r\nfor striking the jurors, the trial court declared the reasons race-neutral\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 23\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\nand found respondent had not violated Batson. We conclude the trial\r\ncourt erred in finding the reason offered to strike Juror 18 to be race-\r\nneutral on its face.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently, our Court adopted the standard delineated by the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court in Purkett v. Elem, __ U.S.__, 115 S.Ct.\r\n1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995), for analyzing a Batson challenge. Adams,\r\nsupra. First, the trial judge must hold a Batson hearing when members of\r\na cognizable racial group or gender are struck and the opposing party\r\nrequests a hearing. The second step of the analysis requires the\r\nproponent of the strike to offer a race-neutral explanation. Unless a\r\ndiscriminatory intent is inherent in the proponent's explanation, the\r\nreason offered will be deemed race-neutral. In the third step, the\r\nopponent of the strike must show that the race-neutral explanation given\r\nwas mere pretext. Pretext generally will be established by showing that\r\nsimilarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury.\r\nUnder some circumstances, the race-neutral explanation given by the\r\nproponent may be so fundamentally implausible that the judge may\r\ndetermine, at the third step of the analysis, that the explanation was mere\r\npretext even without a showing of disparate treatment. Purkett, supra;\r\nAdams, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, we need not go beyond the second step of the analysis.\r\nRespondent's counsel offered the following reason for striking Juror 18:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The juror number 18, she is known as [a] very\r\n  opinionated person, your Honor, who expresses\r\n  herself. We knew if she got on that jury she was\r\n  not gone [sic] budge one way or the other, that she\r\n  was gone [sic] get her way or no way. That was\r\n  our opinion from what we had learned. Her family\r\n  has-- Mr. Lanier has talked about the number of\r\n  people in trouble. She herself has not had any\r\n  problems but she comes from a family that's had\r\n  some problems with the law and she's kind of what\r\n  we refer to as a redneck variety, so to speak, and\r\n  that was the reason we struck her and, as you\r\n  know, your Honor, I was concerned with her family,\r\n  whether she had any problems with me or the law\r\n  because some members of her family might have\r\n  problems with the law.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\np. 24\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term \"redneck\" is a racially derogatory term appl'ed\r\nexclusively to members of the white race.1 The use of the term \"redneck\"\r\nis not a valid race-neutral reason to strike a potential juror, and therefore,\r\nthe strike is facially discriminatory and violates Batson. See Wilkerson v.\r\nTexas, 493 U.S. 924, 110 S.Ct. 292, 107 L.Ed.2d 272 (1989) (dissent from\r\ndenial of petition for certiorari) (an explanation tainted by an\r\nimpermissible factor is not neutral).\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent argues \"redneck\" is a descriptive term used to\r\ndescribe a person with a particular bias and is not discriminatory against\r\nthe white race because these persons, like members of the KKK or Black\r\nPanthers, are struck because of their attitudes and prejudices. However,\r\nthe term encompasses a broader group than just persons with certain\r\nundesirable characteristics. It stereotypes a subgroup of the white race\r\nwithout any evidence that each member of the group actually possesses\r\nthese attitudes. Unlike members of the KKK or Black Panthers who\r\nvoluntarily associate with others who hold the same prejudicial beliefs,\r\n\"rednecks\" have no such common prejudices or attitudes. A \"redneck\"\r\nshould not be excluded from serving on a jury because of this stereotype.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent also claims the context in which the term\r\n\" redneck\" was used should be considered when determining if the strike\r\nviolated Batson. The context becomes relevant at the third step of the\r\nanalysis when the court determines if a race-neutral reason was pretext.\r\nHere, because the reason offered was not race-neutral on its face, we need\r\nnot reach the third step of the analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent further argues that by finding use of the term\r\n\"redneck\" violated Batson, we are preventing a party from obtaining a fair\r\ntrial because a party cannot strike potential jurors who are biased against\r\nthe party. However, the right to serve on a jury and not to be\r\ndiscriminated against because of race or gender belongs to the potential\r\njuror, not the party. Edmonson, supra. Our holding only prevents a party\r\nfrom striking a juror based on a racially stereotypical reason. A party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The term \"redneck\" is defined as \"a member of the white rural laboring\r\nclass . . .offensive slang.\" The American Heritage Dictionary 1037 (2d\r\ncollege ed. 1985). In Webster's New World Dictionary, \"redneck\" is defined\r\nas $$a poor, white rural resident of the South: often a somewhat derogatory\r\nterm.\" Webster's New World Dictionary 1190 (2d college ed. 1976).\r\n\r\n\r\np. 25\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\nmay still strike a juror based on actual known biases of a particular juror.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, we reject the dual motivation analysis employed by\r\nthe Court of Appeals to uphold the strike.2 \r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Gill, 319 S.C. 283, 460 S.E.2d 412 (Ct. App. 1995)\r\n(Cureton, J., dissenting), aff'd as modified, (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 11,\r\n1997) (Davis Adv.Sh. No. 24 at 38),3 the South Carolina Court of Appeals\r\nreviewed the prosecution's strike of a black female juror in a criminal\r\ncase. The prosecution had offered two reasons for the strike: (1) the juror\r\nhad requested a hardship excuse; and (2) the juror lived on the same\r\nstreet as the defendant and the prosecution felt it was possible she might\r\nrealize she knew the defendant. Because the prosecution allowed a white\r\njuror who had requested a hardship excuse to be seated, the trial court\r\nexpressed concern that the first explanation for the strike of the black\r\nfemale was pretextual. However, the trial judge denied the defendant's\r\nBatson motion, concluding the second reason given for the strike was\r\nracially neutral notwithstanding the potential invalidity of the first reason.\r\nId.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals assumed for purposes of\r\nanalysis that the prosecution's first reason was pretextual. Nevertheless,\r\nthe Court of Appeals concluded the prosecution had not violated Batson,\r\nreasoning that \"an action motivated in part by an impermissible reason\r\nwill not necessarily be invalid if the same action would have been taken in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Prior to this opinion, this Court had not addressed the application\r\nof this analysis in the Batson context. However, we note our previous\r\ncase law could be interpreted as inconsistent on this issue. Compare State\r\nv. Tomlin, 299 S.C. 294, 384 S.E.2d 707 (1989) (finding the discriminatory\r\nreason vitiated the two nondiscriminatory reasons given for the strike);\r\nwith State v. Martinez, 294 S.C. 72, 362 S.E.2d 641 (1987) (finding no\r\nBatson violation where both a nondiscriminatory reason and a\r\ndiscriminatory reason had been given for the strike). Therefore, to the\r\nextent any previous opinions may be read as implicitly adopting the dual\r\nmotivation analysis, they are overruled.\r\n\r\n\r\n3While this Court affirmed the conviction of Gill, it vacated the\r\nopinion of the Court of Appeals on the Batson issue finding the Court of\r\nAppeals erred in reaching this issue because it was not properly preserved\r\nfor review. State v. Gill, (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 11, 1997) (Davis Adv.\r\nSh. No. 24 at 38).\r\n\r\n\r\np. 26\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\nthe absence of the impermissible motivation.\" Id. At 289, 460 S.E.2d 416\r\n(citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Bd. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50\r\nL.Ed.2d 471 (1977)).\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Cureton concurred in part and dissented in part. He\r\nfirst observed the \"sole Batson issue before [the Court of Appeals] is\r\nwhether the racially neutral explanation is sufficient to sustain the\r\nperemptory strike of the black juror even if the hardship explanation was,\r\nin fact, pretextual and constitutionally infirm.\" Id. at 294, 460 S.E.2d at\r\n419. After noting the ultimate goal of Batson and its progeny is the\r\nelimination of discriminatory jury selection practices, Judge Cureton\r\nopined:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Based on the above discussed precedential underpinnings of\r\n  the Batson decision and its underlying rationale, I am of the\r\n  opinion that even though the prosecutor may have given one\r\n  racially neutral explanation, the racially motivated explanation,\r\n  as evidenced by the finding of pretext, vitiated the legitimacy\r\n  of the entire jury selection procedure. Once it is found that\r\n  the exercise of even one peremptory challenge is racially\r\n  motivated, this in and of itself gives rise to an inference of\r\n  discriminatory purpose and violates the mandates of Batson,\r\n  which explicitly prohibits the State from exercising strikes in a\r\n  racially discriminatory manner. To hold otherwise, I believe,\r\n  completely guts the notion of pretext, and offends the policies\r\n  underlying Batson.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 299-300, 460 S.E.2d at 421.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Cureton then analyzed approaches used by other\r\njurisdictions to answer the question of whether a discriminatory\r\nexplanation will vitiate other neutral explanations for the peremptory\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome courts follow an approach taken in other areas of Equal\r\nProtection jurisprudence4 and have adopted the dual motivation doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 4This doctrine has been adopted by the United States Supreme Court\r\nin other areas of Equal Protection analysis. See Hunter v. Underwood,\r\n471 U.S. 222, 105 S.Ct. 1916, 85 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985); Village of Arlington\r\nHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97\r\nS.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977).\r\n\r\n\r\np. 27\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Howard v. Sankowski, 986 F.2d 24 (2d Cir. 1993). Under this\r\ndoctrine, if the challenging party proves a discriminatory purpose, the\r\nchallenged party has an opportunity to show the peremptory strike would\r\nhave been exercised even if the improper factor had not, in part, motivated\r\nthe decision to strike. Howard, supra. Although the United States\r\nSupreme Court has not yet addressed this doctrine's applicability to a\r\nBatson challenge, other courts have followed Howard in adopting the dual\r\nmotivation doctrine in the Batson context.5 See Jones v. Plaster, 57 F.3d\r\n417 (4th Cir. 1995); United States v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507 (8th Cir. 1995),\r\ncert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 1449 (1996); Wallace v. Morrison, 87 F.3d 1271\r\n(11th Cir. 1996).\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, other jurisdictions have adopted the \"tainted\"\r\napproach where a discriminatory explanation will vitiate the entire\r\nselection process regardless of the genuineness of the other explanations\r\nfor the strike. See United States v. Greene, 36 M.J. 274 (C.M.A. 1993)\r\n(strike violated Batson because the invalid reason vitiated the valid\r\nreasons); Rector v. State, 444 S.E.2d 862 (Ga. App. 1994) (finding the\r\ninvalid reason tainted the other valid reasons); Moore v. State, 811 S.W.2d\r\n197 (Tex. App. 1991) (finding a Batson violation where a juror would have\r\na problem assessing punishment (valid) and was a member of a minority\r\nclub (invalid)). Judge Cureton concluded South Carolina should adopt the\r\n\"tainted\" approach. State v. Gill, supra. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, it is inappropriate to apply the dual motivation\r\ndoctrine in the Batson context.6 Once a discriminatory reason has been\r\nuncovered -- either inherent or pretextual -- this reason taints the entire\r\njury selection procedure. By adopting dual motivation, this Court would\r\nbe approving a party's consideration of discriminatory factors so long as\r\nsufficient nondiscriminatory factors were also part of the decision to strike\r\na juror and the discriminatory factor was not the substantial or motivating\r\nfactor. However, any consideration of discriminatory factors in this\r\ndecision is in direct contravention of the purpose of Batson which is to\r\nensure peremptory strikes are executed in a nondiscriminatory manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5We note a federal district court recently questioned the continued\r\nviability of Howard and its progeny in light of the \"facially valid\" standard\r\nenunciated by the United States Supreme Court in Purkett. United States\r\nv. Somerstein, 959 F. Supp. 592 (E.D.N.Y. 1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n6We hinted at adopting this approach in our decision in State v.\r\nTomlin, 299 S.C. 294, 384 S.E.2d 707 (1989).\r\n\r\n\r\np. 28\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Rector v. State, 444 S.E.2d at 865 (\"[w]hile we realize that it is\r\nunrealistic to expect trial counsel to put aside every improper influence\r\nwhen selecting a juror, we conclude that is exactly what the law\r\nrequires\"); see also State v. Tomlin, supra. \"[T]he harm from\r\ndiscriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the\r\ndefendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community.\" Georgia\r\nv. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 49, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 2353, 120 L.Ed.2d 33, 44-45\r\n(1992) (quoting Batson, 476 U.S. at 87, 106 S.Ct. at 1718, 90 L.Ed.2d at\r\n81). \"Active discrimination ... during th[e] process [of jury selection]\r\ncondones violations of the United States Constitution within the very\r\ninstitution entrusted with its enforcement, and so invites cynicism\r\nrespecting the jury's neutrality and its obligation to adhere to the law.\"\r\nPowers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 412, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1374, 113 L.Ed.2d 411,\r\n426 (1991). Thus, \"[r]acial discrimination has no place in the courtroom\r\nwhether the proceeding is civil or criminal.\" Edmunson, 500 U.S. at 630,\r\n111 S.Ct. at 2088, 114 L.Ed.2d at 680 (1991).\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, as applied, Batson is only effective against the most\r\nobvious examples of racial and gender prejudices. To excuse such obvious\r\nprejudice because the challenged party can also articulate\r\nnondiscriminatory reasons for the peremptory strike would erode what\r\nlittle protection Batson provides against discrimination in jury selection.\r\nThe challenged party should not have an opportunity to convince the judge\r\nthat he would have struck the juror regardless of the discriminatory\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Expert Testimony\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough not necessary for the disposition of this case, we\r\naddress the admissibility of the testimony of petitioner's expert witness\r\nbecause this issue is likely to arise again in the new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends the trial judge erred in excluding the\r\ntestimony of her expert witness, Varner Richards. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe qualification of a witness as an expert and admissibility of\r\nhis testimony are matters largely within the discretion of the trial judge;\r\nhowever, the exercise of this discretion will be reversed where an abuse of\r\ndiscretion has occurred. Creed v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 426\r\nS.E.2d 785 (1993). Before expert medical testimony is admissible on the\r\nquestion of causation between the plaintiffs injuries and the acts of the\r\ndefendant, the testimony must satisfy the \"most probably\" rule.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 29\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\nBaughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d\r\n(1991).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his proffered deposition, Richards, who has a doctorate in\r\npharmacy, identified six of the medications taken by respondent as\r\npossibly causing tinnitus as a side effect. Tinnitus was one of the injuries\r\nthe respondent claimed was caused by the accident. Richards conceded he\r\ncould not state any of the medications most probably caused respondent's\r\ntinnitus. Therefore, Richards was not qualified to testify that respondent's\r\ntinnitus was caused by the drugs. Because Richards' testimony was only\r\nrelevant to the issue of causation, the trial judge properly excluded his\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., and TOAL, A.J., concur. WALLER and MOORE, JJ\r\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part, in separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\np.30\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J. (Concurring in part and dissenting in part): I concur with\r\nthe majority insofar as it holds the expert testimony of Richards was properly\r\nexcluded. I also concur with the finding that stating a juror is of the\r\n\"redneck variety\" is not a race neutral reason for exercising a peremptory\r\nchallenge. However, I disagree with the decision that the \"dual motivation\r\nprinciple\" should not apply to this area of Equal Protection challenges. For\r\nthat reason, and because if such a principle were employed here I would find\r\nno Equal Protection violation, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the dual motivation principle, if a court concludes a peremptory\r\nstrike \"has been exercised in part for a discriminatory purpose, the court\r\nmust consider whether the party whose conduct is being challenged has\r\ndemonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the strike would have\r\nnevertheless been exercised even if an improper factor had not motivated in\r\npart the decision to strike.\" Jones v. Plaster, 57 F.3d 417, 421 (4th Cir.\r\n1995). As the majority notes, this principle has been adopted by the\r\nSupreme Court in other areas of Equal Protection analysis in determining\r\npurposeful racial discrimination,1d although that Court has not yet specifically\r\naddressed its applicability to a Batson challenge. However, a number of\r\nlower courts, including the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, have done so.\r\nJones, 57 F.3d at 417. See also Howard v. Senkowski, 986 F.2d 24 (2d Cir.\r\n1993); United States v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507 (8th Cir. 1995), cert. denied,\r\n116 S. Ct. 1449 (1996); Wallace v. Morrison, 87 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir.), cert.\r\ndenied, 117 S. Ct. 616 (1996). See also Gattis v. State 697 A.2d 1174 (Del.\r\n1997); People v. Pecor, 614 N.E.2d 1184 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996), cert. denied, 684\r\nN.E.2d 1340 (Ill.), and cert denied, 118 S. Ct. 429 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Howard v. Senkowski, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals provided\r\na comprehensive discussion of the application of dual motivation analysis as\r\napplied to discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges. That case\r\nfocused on the interrelation between the three-step inquiry enunciated in\r\nBatson and the dual motivation principle:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dual motivation analysis, in effect, may supplement so-\r\n  called \"pretext\" analysis, which applies to a claimant's \"burden of\r\n  persuading the court that [he or] she has been the victim of\r\n  intentional discrimination.\" When the issue is the all-or-nothing\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n1dSee...e.g., Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 105 S. Ct. 1916, 85 L. Ed.\r\n2d 222 (1985); Personnel Adm'r v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 60\r\nL. Ed. 2d 870 (1979); Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\r\nDev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977).\r\n\r\n\r\np. 31\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  question of whether or not an impermissible consideration\r\n  motivated the challenged action ... pretext analysis employs the\r\n  familiar three-step approach .... Once the claimant has proven\r\n  improper motivation, dual motivation analysis is available to the\r\n  person accused of discrimination to avoid liability by showing\r\n  that the same action would have been taken in the absence of the\r\n  improper motivation that the claimant has proven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The two forms of analysis are not incompatible. The\r\n  claimant always has to prove discriminatory motivation. If he\r\n  succeeds, the accused party has an opportunity to show that\r\n  there were really two motives and that a permissible motive\r\n  would have led to the challenged action. In effect, the accused\r\n  party is permitted to show, if he can, that the improper\r\n  motivation proved by the claimant was only part, and not the\r\n  decisive part, of the motivation.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n986 F.2d at 27 (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn finding it proper to apply dual motivation analysis to this aspect of Equal\r\nProtection jurisprudence, Howard noted the Supreme Court's reliance on\r\nother types of Equal Protection cases (which utilized dual motivation) in\r\nreaching its seminal decision in Batson v. Kentucky.2d Id. at 28 (\"Since dual\r\nmotivation analysis was explicitly invoked by the Supreme Court in the\r\ncontext of determining racial motivation for purposes of adjudicating a\r\nchallenge under the Equal Protection Clause, and since Batson equated jury\r\ndiscrimination claims with 'any case alleging a violation of the Equal\r\nProtection Clause,' one might have thought there would be no question but\r\nthat such analysis applies to an equal protection challenge based on racial\r\nmotivation in any context, including the context of peremptory challenges\")\r\n(internal citations omitted).3d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2d476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986).\r\n\r\n\r\n3dInterestingly, the Second Circuit felt not adopting dual motivation\r\nanalysis would be unfair to Equal Protection claimants. See Howard, 986\r\nF.2d at 29 (\"It is unlikely that in this 'most compelling' context [i.e. Equal\r\nProtection challenged related to discrimination in the judicial system], the\r\nCourt intended to invoke a standard more onerous for claimants than that\r\napplicable in other equal protection contexts\") (emphasis supplied). Howard\r\nwas focusing on certain language from Batson where the Court held, \"The\r\nEqual Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors\r\n\r\n\r\np. 32\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\nBatson clearly emphasized it sought to further the \"general equal\r\nprotection principle that the 'invidious quality' of governmental action claimed\r\nto be racially discriminatory 'must ultimately be traced to a racially\r\ndiscriminatory purpose.'\" 476 U.S. at 93, 106 S. Ct. at 1721, 90 L. Ed. 2d at\r\n85 (quoting Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240, 96 S. Ct. 2040, 2048, 48\r\nL. Ed. 2d 597, 607-08 (1976)) (emphasis supplied). In my opinion, the\r\nmajority's holding today goes far beyond this principle and what Equal\r\nProtection requires.4d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolely on account of their race.\" Batson, 476 U.S. at 89, 106 S. Ct. at 1719,\r\n\r\n90 L. Ed. 2d at 83 (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\n\r\n4dTechnically, since the trial court did not have an opportunity to consider\r\nthese issues in the context of the dual motivation principle, were this the\r\nmajority opinion, remand would most likely be appropriate. Because this is\r\nnot the majority opinion, I would only add that were I applying dual\r\nmotivation analysis to the facts of this case, I would find Respondent met his\r\nburden of showing he would have struck juror eighteen without the offensive\r\nreason. Respondent gave several reasons for striking this juror: (1) she is\r\nopinionated; (2) she is stubborn; (3) she is headstrong and unwilling to listen\r\nto others; (4) her family has had problems with the law and she might have\r\nprejudices against Respondent's attorney or law enforcement, and (5) she is\r\n\"kind of what we refer to as a redneck variety.\" Without doubt the first four\r\nreasons are race neutral. Respondent was concerned primarily that the juror\r\nwould not be a \"team player\" with other jurors; he had some personal\r\nknowledge of her as being opinionated and unwilling to compromise. He was\r\nalso concerned about certain prejudices she might have against him or law\r\nenforcement because of her family background.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Respondent's stating he struck juror eighteen because she\r\nwas of a \"redneck variety\" is not precisely the same as saying he struck her\r\nbecause she was white. \"Redneck\" does not only refer to a person's racial\r\nstatus. It also means a \"person who advocates a provincial, conservative,\r\noften bigoted sociopolitical attitude considered characteristic of a redneck.\"\r\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary 1037 (2d college ed. 1982). The fact that this\r\nterm can refer not only to race but also to beliefs and attitudes further\r\nsupports the finding that under the circumstances of this case the ultimate\r\nreason Respondent struck the juror was not because of her race. I point out\r\nthat while \"redneck\" can be used in a stereotypical sense, that is not what\r\noccurred in this case. Certainly, this is the ultimate evil to avoid when\r\nstriking jurors: making the assumption that because a juror is a member of\r\na certain race, he or she will have certain prejudices, sympathies or attitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 33\r\n\r\nPAYTON v. KEARSE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In detailing the particulars of the Batson proof scheme, we are mindful\r\nthat its sole purpose is to help courts and parties answer, 'not necessarily\r\nevade[,] the ultimate question of discrimination vel non.'\"Jones, 57 F.3d at\r\n421. I would find dual motivation analysis appropriate in the context of\r\nEqual Protection challenges to peremptory strikes, and thus affirm the Court\r\nof Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE, A.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith \"redneck,\" the assumption is not based merely on race but on social or\r\n\r\neconomic status, i.e. \"because this juror is a redneck, she must have a\r\nprovincial, conservative, or bigoted sociopolitical attitude.\" In this case,\r\nhowever, Respondent was not assuming juror eighteen had certain\r\nundesirable attitudes because she was a lower-class white person; he based\r\nhis conclusions on actual prior knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\np.34\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24741","title":"Noah R.

STATE\r\n\r\n\r\ncredit was calculated from the date of the affirmance of Robinson's state court\r\nconviction. We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Robinson was indicted for murder, criminal conspiracy to\r\ncommit murder, and accessory before the fact of assault and battery with\r\nintent to kill. In January 1989, Robinson was tried on these charges and\r\nfound guilty of accessory after the fact of a felony. The trial court declared\r\na mistrial on Robinson's other charges because of the failure of the jury to\r\nreturn a verdict. Robinson was sentenced to ten years confinement.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson filed a notice of intent to appeal and posted an appeal bond.\r\nWhile out on appeal bond, he returned to Chicago. Later in 1989, Robinson\r\nwas charged in federal court with violations of the Racketeer Influenced and\r\nCorrupt Organizations (\"RICO\") laws. He was subsequently convicted and\r\nsentenced to six years in prison. In August 1992, Robinson was convicted\r\nand sentenced to life imprisonment on additional criminal charges relating\r\nto his involvement with the Chicago-based El Rukn street gang. The federal\r\nsentences were to run concurrently with Robinson's state sentence. We\r\naffirmed Robinson's state conviction in September 1991, which was during the\r\ninterim between his federal court convictions. State v. Robinson, 305 S.C.\r\n469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 937 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November 1992, Robinson filed a PCR application in which he\r\nsought to obtain credit in South Carolina for time served in federal custody\r\nfrom the date we affirmed his conviction. Robinson had been exclusively in\r\nfederal custody from the date of his arrest in 1989 for RICO violations until\r\nJanuary 18, 1995, when he was admitted to, but deemed absent with leave\r\nfrom, the South Carolina Department of Corrections (\"SCDOC\"). After an\r\nevidentiary hearing, the PCR court issued an order of dismissal denying, all\r\nof Robinson's claims. Robinson filed a Rule 59(e) Motion to Reconsider the\r\nOrder of Dismissal. After another hearing,1 the court amended its order of\r\ndismissal, affirming the prior order, but modifying it to the extent of granting\r\nRobinson credit for time served from the date we affirmed Robinson's state\r\ncourt conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we granted to review\r\nwhether Robinson \"commenced\" the service of his South Carolina sentence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 At the time of the hearing, Robinson was incarcerated in the Oxford\r\nFederal Correctional Institution, Oxford, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 36\r\n\r\nROBINSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen his conviction was affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n  The credit for time. served statute provides in pertinent part: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  The computation of the time served by prisoners under sentences\r\n  imposed by the courts of this State shall be reckoned from the\r\n  date of the imposition of the sentence. But when (a) a prisoner\r\n  shall have given notice of intention to appeal, (b) the\r\n  commencement of the service of the sentence follows the\r\n  revocation of probation or (c) the court shall have designated a\r\n  specific time for the commencement of the service of the sentence,\r\n  the computation of the time served shall be reckoned from the\r\n  date of the commencement of the service of the sentence.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-40 (1989)(emphasis added). Here, we must determine\r\nwhen Robinson commenced the service of his sentence. The State argues\r\nthat the PCR court erred by finding that Robinson commenced his sentence\r\non the date his conviction was affirmed. We agree. We hold that for\r\npurposes of calculating credit for time served, persons released on appeal\r\nbond commence service of their sentences when they submit to the custody\r\nof the SCDOC, and not upon affirmance of their convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Maxey v. Maxwell, 224 S.C. 320, 78 S.E.2d 633 (1953), the habeas\r\ncorpus petitioner was convicted of burglary and assault and battery with\r\nintent to kill. The petitioner was freed on appeal bond pending disposition\r\nof his appeal by this Court. His convictions were affirmed on October 30,\r\n1950, and he was committed to the state penitentiary on November 15, 1950.\r\nIn interpreting the applicable statute,2 we noted that \"service of the\r\nsentences, which was stayed by the appeal . . . , is reckoned from the date\r\nof the commencement of the service of the sentences, which in this case was\r\nNovember 15, 1950.\" Maxey, 224 S.C. at 330, 78 S.E.2d at 637. Therefore,\r\nMaxey did not begin service of his sentence until six-teen days after his\r\nconviction was affirmed -- until he submitted to the custody of the state\r\npenitentiary. There is no reason to interpret the statute differently when the\r\ndefendant seeks credit on his South Carolina sentence for time served in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The statutory language at issue is the same as under the current\r\n\r\nstatute. See 1952 S.C. Code of Laws Â§ 55-11.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 37\r\n\r\nROBINSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncustody of another sovereignty.3 \r\n\r\n\r\nThe law governing the imposition of concurrent sentences requires\r\nelaboration inasmuch as it is critical to the determination of when Robinson\r\n\"commenced\" the service of his sentence. South Carolina is \"without.\r\nauthority to modify or place conditions on a sentence from a foreign\r\njurisdiction.\" Clark v. State, 321 S.C. 377, 380, 468 S.E.2d 653, 655 (1996).\r\nCorrespondingly, a foreign jurisdiction is without authority to modify or place\r\nconditions on a sentence imposed in South Carolina. Therefore, if a second\r\njurisdiction imposes on a convict a sentence to run concurrently with the\r\npreviously imposed sentence from another jurisdiction, it is the responsibility\r\nof the second jurisdiction to effectuate its concurrent sentence and thus\r\nensure the convict receives credit for time served in both jurisdictions.4 To\r\nachieve this result, the second jurisdiction must transfer custody of the\r\nconvict to the first jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Clark v. State, 321 S.C. 377, 468 S.E.2d 653, South Carolina failed\r\nto transport Clark to federal custody to effectuate South Carolina's imposition\r\nof a concurrent sentence. Clark pled guilty in federal court to possession of\r\na sawed off shotgun. The judge sentenced him to ten years confinement.\r\nSubsequently, Clark pled guilty to several offenses in state court. Pursuant\r\nto a plea agreement, the judge ordered that the sentences run concurrently\r\nwith Clark's previously imposed federal sentence. However, instead of being\r\ntransported to federal custody, Clark remained in state prison. Clark then\r\nfiled a PCR petition claiming that his plea bargain was not being enforced.\r\nWe noted that \"[t]he sentence of a person convicted of a federal offense\r\ncommences to run from the date on which such person is received at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 This case should be distinguished from those involving defendants\r\n\r\narrested in another state and awaiting extradition and trial in South\r\nCarolina. Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-40, these defendants receive credit\r\nfor this time served prior to trial and sentencing, even though it is spent in\r\nanother Jurisdiction. See State v. Dozier, 263 S.C. 267, 210 S.E.2d 225\r\n(1974).\r\n\r\n\r\n4 In Cobb v. State, 286 S.C. 92, 332 S.E.2d 530 (1985), Cobb was\r\nsentenced in North Carolina for assault. He subsequently pled guilty in\r\nSouth Carolina to rape. The South Carolina trial court sentenced him to 30\r\nyears in prison to be served concurrently with his North Carolina sentence.\r\nOn appeal, we held that \"a South Carolina judge has authority to impose a\r\nsentence to run concurrently with a sentence already being served in another\r\nstate.\" Cobb, 286 S.C. at 94, 332 S.E.2d at 531.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 38\r\n\r\nROBINSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npenitentiary.\" Clark, 321 S.C. at 379, 468 S.E.2d at 655; see 18 U.S.C. Â§\r\n3585(a) (1994)(\"A sentence to a term of imprisonment commences on the date\r\nthe defendant is received in custody . . . .\"). As a result, we concluded that\r\n\"the only way to effectuate a state trial court's order that a state sentence\r\nrun concurrently with a prior federal sentence is to have the defendant\r\nreturned to federal custody to serve his federal sentence.\" Clark, 321 S.C. at\r\n380, 468 S.E.2d at 655. Because Clark had not been transferred to federal\r\ncustody, he failed to receive credit against his federal sentence for the time\r\nhe served in South Carolina custody.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Furman, 288 S.C. 243, 341 S.E.2d 795 (1986), the Georgia\r\ncourt neither transported Furman to South Carolina nor specified that its\r\nsentence was to be concurrent with the previously imposed South Carolina\r\nsentence. Furman was convicted in South Carolina for voluntary\r\nmanslaughter and sentenced to twelve years imprisonment. Pending the\r\ndisposition of his appeal, he was released. While out on appeal bond,\r\nFurman was arrested and convicted in Georgia for murder. He served his\r\nsentence in Georgia and was then returned to South Carolina. He filed a\r\nPCR application to receive credit against his South Carolina sentence for the\r\ntime he spent in a Georgia prison. We held that \"[i]n cases where sentences\r\nare imposed by two different sovereignties, the sentence will run concurrently\r\nonly if so specified.\" Id. at 245, 341 S.E.2d at 796. Because the Georgia\r\ncourt failed to specify whether the sentences were to run concurrently, we\r\nconcluded that Furman had to serve his South Carolina sentence without any\r\ncredit for serving his Georgia sentence. Furman should not be read to imply\r\nthat a convict will automatically receive credit for time served if a concurrent\r\nsentence is specified, even though custody of the convict has not been\r\ntransferred to the first jurisdiction. Furman is overruled to the extent it\r\nsuggests that only an order specifying concurrence is required for the convict\r\nto receive a concurrent sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the federal district court specifically stated that the\r\nfederal sentences were to be served concurrently with the state sentence.\r\nBecause the federal district court did so specify, Robinson now claims that he\r\nis entitled to credit for the time served in federal custody from the date his\r\nconviction was affirmed. We disagree. Although the federal district court\r\nhad the authority to impose a sentence concurrent with Robinson's prior\r\nSouth Carolina sentence, 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3584(a) (1994), the federal court could\r\nnot modify or place conditions on the previously imposed South Carolina\r\nsentence. Instead, the Bureau of Prisons should have delivered Robinson into\r\nSouth Carolina custody so that the federal court's imposition of a concurrent\r\n\r\n\r\np. 39\r\n\r\nROBINSON v. STATE\r\n\r\nsentence could be satisfied.5 See 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3621(b) (1994)(Bureau of\r\nPrisons has statutory authority to designate a state correctional facility as\r\nthe convict's place of imprisonment). Had Robinson been transferred to South\r\nCarolina custody, he would have begun the service of his state court sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA convict may also receive credit for time served in another jurisdiction\r\nby notifying the SCDOC that he is unable to personally submit to South\r\nCarolina custody to commence the service of his sentence. Upon such\r\nnotification, the SCDOC will place a detainer on the convict. See Clark, 321\r\nS.C. at 380 n.3, 468 S.E.2d at 655 n.3. While the convict is subject to a\r\nSouth Carolina detainer, he is constructively in South Carolina custody. As\r\na result, a convict will receive credit for time spent in another jurisdiction\r\nwhile subject to a South Carolina detainer. Because Robinson failed to\r\nimmediately notify the SCDOC of his arrest and so submit himself to South\r\nCarolina custody, he cannot receive credit for all his time served in federal\r\ncustody. Instead, he can only receive credit for the time he has served in\r\nfederal custody since he submitted to South Carolina custody on January 18,\r\n1995, the date he was admitted to, but deemed absent with leave from, the\r\nSCDOC.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the PCR court's order is REVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 See, e.g., United States v.

Martin, Sr., Judge\r\n&nbsp;ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI\r\n&nbsp;Opinion No. 24742\r\nSubmitted November 19, 1997 - Filed January 12, 1998\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n  Attorney General Charles Molony Condon, Deputy\r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, and Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Teresa A. Knox, all of\r\n  Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Assistant Appellate Defender Lisa T. Gregory, of\r\n  S.C. Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for\r\n  respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  &nbsp;MOORE, A.J.: On advice of counsel, respondent pled guilty to\r\ntwo separate charges arising from different facts: criminal sexual conduct\r\n(CSC) third degree and unlawful use of telephone. No direct appeal was\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 41\r\n\r\nMOOREHEAD v. STATE \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\ntaken. We granted the State's petition for a writ of certiorari to review\r\nthe grant of post-conviction relief (PCR) and now reverse.\r\n  &nbsp;FACTS\r\n&nbsp;The following facts were presented at the plea hearing by the\r\nassistant solicitor:\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Honor, as to the unlawful use of telephone,\r\n  [respondent] called the victim, who is his ex, who is his ex-\r\n  girlfriend, and harassed and threatened her. One call was\r\n  overheard by a Lex Morgan, a police officer, who told\r\n  [respondent] not to call anymore, but he continued to call her...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  As to the criminal sexual conduct, the victim is Tracey\r\n  Gibson, twelve years old. She was riding around with some\r\n  friends very late at night on March 4th and went to the home\r\n  of Mr. Moorehead's brother, [Terry] Moorehead, to ask if she\r\n  could spend the night because she was in trouble with her\r\n  mother. She knew Mr. Moorehead's brother, who is deaf. She\r\n  had told, at the time when she met Mr. Moorehead, she told\r\n  him she was fifteen. He told her she could sleep in his room,\r\n  so she went into his room. She fell asleep. When she woke\r\n  up, he was also awake. They began kissing, and he took off\r\n  her clothes and had sex with her. She was menstruating at\r\n  the time. She tells me that it's her understanding that he did\r\n  use a condom. Your Honor, she said there was no consent.\r\n  Afterwards, she got on the floor, went to sleep, and Mr.\r\n  Moorehead slept in the bed. She woke up at seven a.m. and\r\n  went home. She told her mother three days later. Mr.\r\n  Moorehead, when questioned by the police, said she had never\r\n  been in his house; however, she could describe the bedroom.\r\n  They did find what appeared to be blood stains on the\r\n  mattress and took them to SLED.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n&nbsp;1) Sentencing advice on CSC charge\r\nRespondent's sentence on the CSC charge was ten years, suspended\r\nafter seven, and five years probation. At the PCR hearing, respondent\r\ntestified he pled guilty to the CSC charge on counsel's advice that he\r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 42\r\n\r\nMOOREHEAD v. STATE \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nwould receive only probation. He claimed he answered the trial judge's\r\nquestions regarding the plea affirmatively because\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n\r\n  I done what [counsel] told me to do .... He said the judge\r\n  knew about all of this and that's how things was done around\r\n  here. That's why I told the judge that, hoping that -- well,\r\n  knowing that I was going to get probation, I thought, instead\r\n  of being sent to the Department of Corrections.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;Counsel, on the other hand, testified he never promised respondent a\r\nstraight probationary sentence although they did discuss probation to\r\nfollow his active jail time as part of the plea negotiations.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nThe PCR judge found counsel was ineffective for advising respondent\r\nhe would receive only probation and that respondent would not have pled\r\nguilty but for this erroneous advice. This was error.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nWhen considering an allegation on PCR that a guilty plea was based\r\non inaccurate advice of counsel, the transcript of the guilty plea hearing\r\nwill be considered to determine whether any possible error by counsel was\r\ncured by the information conveyed at the plea hearing. Wolfe v. State,\r\n__S.C.__ 485 S.E.2d 36-1 (1997). At the plea hearing, the trial judge\r\nasked respondent if he understood that the possible sentence for the CSC\r\ncharge was ten years and respondent answered that he did. The trial\r\njudge also summarized the plea agreement on the record before accepting\r\nrespondent's plea and respondent answered that he understood it. Even if\r\ntrial counsel erroneously informed respondent that his sentence would be\r\nprobationary, any misconception was cured at the plea hearing.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nFurther, respondent's explanation that he answered the trial judge\r\naffirmatively on counsel's alleged advice that the questions were\r\nmeaningless does not support the grant of PCR. Id. (defendant's claim he\r\nunderstood from counsel that the trial ) judge's questions at the guilty plea\r\nwere only a \"polite fiction\" held not an invitation to answer untruthfully) .\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nWe conclude there is no evidence to support the PCR judge's finding\r\nthat respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel on this ground.\r\n  &nbsp;2) Failure to investigate\r\nRespondent claimed counsel was ineffective for failing to\r\nindependently investigate. He claimed counsel failed to interview\r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 43\r\n\r\nMOOREHEAD v. STATE \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nexculpatory witnesses or the two victims and did not await the results of\r\nSLED DNA testing on the blood from the mattress. The PCR judge found\r\ncounsel was ineffective on this ground. This was error.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nFailure to conduct an independent investigation does not constitute\r\nineffective assistance of counsel when the allegation is supported only by\r\nmere speculation as to the result. Kibler v. State, 267 S.C. 250, 227\r\nS.E.2d 199 (1976). There is nothing in the record to indicate that\r\ninterviewing the victims would have led to any different result.\r\nRespondent admitted the victim of the telephone charge would have\r\nreiterated the same accusation and there is nothing to indicate the CSC\r\nvictim would have retracted her version of the facts. Further, there is no\r\nevidence awaiting the DNA test results could have had any impact since\r\nrespondent admitted the CSC victim had slept on his mattress as an\r\nexplanation for the menstrual blood. Accordingly, there is no evidence to\r\nsupport the PCR judge's finding that counsel was ineffective for failing to\r\ninvestigate.CONCLUSION\r\n&nbsp;A defendant who pleads guilty on the advice of counsel may\r\ncollaterally attack the plea only by showing that (1) counsel was ineffective\r\nand (2) there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel's errors, the\r\ndefendant would not have pled guilty. Wolfe v. State, __ S.C. __, 485\r\nS.E.2d 367 (1997); Satterwhite v. State, __S.C.__, 481 S.E.2d 709\r\n(1997). Since there is no evidence to support the finding counsel was\r\nineffective, the PCR judge erred in vacating respondent's plea.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n  &nbsp;REVERSED.\r\n&nbsp;FINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 44\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24743","title":"Eddie Medlin v.

We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 45\r\n\r\nMEDLIN v. UPSTATE PLASTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 1994, Medlin was employed to install stucco sidings on\r\nbuildings. His employer Upstate Plaster Service (\"Employer\") is solely owned\r\nby Keith Garris. Employer maintains an office and warehouse in Enoree,\r\nEnoree.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedlin testified that before he had started work with Employer, he had\r\ntold Garris that he did not have a driver's license. Garris told Medlin that\r\nif he could make it to Employer's office, Employer would provide\r\ntransportation from there. Either Medlin's co-worker Frankie Bailey (\"Co-\r\nworker\") or Garris himself would then drive Medlin to the work sites. Garris\r\ntestified that employees were responsible for getting themselves to work;\r\nhowever, Medlin could not provide his own transportation, so \"We had to\r\nfurnish him a ride.\" Garris stated that one of the men would take Medlin\r\nto the job sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 25, 1994, Medlin was scheduled to work in Rutherfordton,\r\nNorth Carolina, which was an hour away from Employer's office. On that\r\nday, Co-worker was having trouble with his vehicle, so Garris lent him his\r\npersonal truck so that Co-worker and Medlin could travel to Rutherfordton.\r\nWhile returning from Rutherfordton in the truck, Co-worker and Medlin were\r\ninvolved in an automobile accident. Medlin, who was riding as the passenger\r\nin the truck, was injured.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May 1994, Medlin filed for workers' compensation for the injuries he\r\nsustained as a result of the automobile accident. Employer denied that\r\nMedlin had had an accident arising out of and in the course of his\r\nemployment. The matter was heard by a single commissioner who concluded\r\nthat Medlin did not sustain an injury arising out of and in the course of his\r\nemployment with Employer. The full commission unanimously affirmed the\r\nsingle commissioner's findings of fact and law. This decision was affirmed\r\nby the circuit court. The matter was appealed again and heard by the Court\r\nof Appeals, which, in an unpublished opinion, affirmed the circuit court.\r\nMedlin v. Upstate Plaster Serv., Op. No. 96-UP-293 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Sept.\r\n12, 1996). Medlin has petitioned for a writ of certiorari, contesting the\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 46\r\n\r\nMEDLIN v. UPSTATE PLASTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will\r\nbe set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence. Kearse v. State\r\nHealth &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 318 S.C. 198, 456 S.E.2d 892 (1995).\r\nA court may not substitute its judgment for that of an agency as to the\r\nweight of the evidence on questions of fact unless the agency's findings are\r\nclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence\r\non the whole record. Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 317 S.C. 306, 454\r\nS.E.2d 320 (1995). Substantial evidence is evidence which, considering the\r\nrecord as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that\r\nthe administrative agency reached. Gibson v. Florence Country Club, 282\r\nS.C. 384, 318 S.E.2d 365 (1984).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, an employee going to or coming from the place where\r\nhis work is to be performed is not engaged in performing any service growing\r\nout of and incidental to his employment, and, therefore, an injury sustained\r\nby accident at such time does not arise out of and in the course of his\r\nemployment. McDaniel v. Bus Terminal Restaurant Management Corp., 271\r\nS.C. 299, 247 S.E.2d 321 (1978). However, South Carolina has recognized a\r\nnumber of exceptions to this rule. Among these are:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, in going to and returning from work, the means of\r\n    transportation is provided by the employer, or the time that is\r\n    consumed is paid for or included in the wages;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    (2) Where the employee, on his way to or from his work, is still\r\n    charged with some duty or task in connection with his employment;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    (3) The way used is inherently dangerous and is either\r\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) the exclusive way of ingress and egress to and\r\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from his work; or\r\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) constructed and maintained by the employer; or\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    (4) That such injury incurred by a workman in the course of his\r\n      travel to his place of work and not on the premises of his employer\r\n      but in close proximity thereto is not compensable unless the place\r\n      of injury was brought within the scope of employment by an\r\n      express or implied requirement in the contract of employment of its\r\n      use by the servant in going to and coming from his work.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSola v. Sunny Slope Farms, 244 S.C. 6, 135 S.E.2d 321 (1964). A fifth\r\n\r\n\r\np. 47\r\n\r\nMEDLIN v. UPSTATE PLASTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexception allows compensation where an employee sustains an injury while\r\nperforming a special task, service, mission, or errand for his employer, even\r\nbefore or after customary working hours, or on a day on which he does not\r\nordinarily work. Bickley v. South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 259 S.C. 463,\r\n192 S.E.2d 866 (1972).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first exception to the \"going and coming rule\" is relevant here:\r\nWhere, in going to and returning from work, the means of transportation is\r\nprovided by the employer. The Court of Appeals found that there was\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the findings of the commission that Garris's\r\ndecision to supply transportation to Medlin was gratuitous and not out of any\r\nobligation to provide such transportation. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence is uncontradicted that Medlin needed transportation to\r\nwork sites, and Employer had agreed to provide such transportation. Medlin\r\ntestified that before starting work with Employer, he had informed Garris\r\nthat he did not have a driver's license. Garris asked if Medlin could get to\r\nthe office; Garris could then provide transportation from there. Garris's own\r\ntestimony reveals that Employer had agreed to provide transportation. In\r\nresponse to the question, \"But Mr. Medlin did not provide his own\r\ntransportation, did he?,\" Garris responded: \"No. We had to furnish him a\r\nride. One of the men would take him . . . .\" This admission by Garris\r\nclearly establishes that the provision of transportation to Medlin was not\r\nsimply a gratuitous act by Garris, but was directly related to the work of\r\nEmployer.

THOMPSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.J.: Petitoner Gary Reece Thompson, Jr. was convicted of\r\ncriminal sexual conduct in the first degree and sentenced to thirty years in\r\nprison. On appeal, Thompson challenges the trial court's ruling allowing the\r\nprosecution to use, for impeachment purposes, statements Thompson made\r\nto a psychiatrist in the course of plea negotiations. In an unpublished\r\nopinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling. State v.\r\nThompson, Op. No. 96-UP-132 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 30, 1996). We\r\nreverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\n\r\nGary Reece Thompson, Jr. was indicted for criminal sexual conduct and\r\nassault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the\r\nfirst degree. The indictment alleged that between January 22, 1993 and May\r\n1, 1993, Thompson committed or assaulted with the intent to commit sexual\r\nbattery on a six year old female.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to trial, Thompson was represented by Bill Godfrey (\"Attorney\").\r\nOn the advice of Attorney, Thompson retained the services of Dr. Karl\r\nBodtorf (\"Psychiatrist\"). Attomey contacted the solicitor and explained that\r\nhe wanted to have Psychiatrist evaluate Thompson to determine whether\r\nThompson would be eligible for Psychiatrist's sex offender treatment program.\r\nAttorney intended to use Psychiatrist's recommendation to negotiate a plea\r\nagreement with the State. The solicitor did not object to the evaluation, but\r\nrefused to commit to making any sentencing recommendation to the court.\r\nThompson understood the purpose of the evaluation was to pursue a plea\r\nagreement with the solicitor. During the course of the psychiatric interview,\r\nThompson made several admissions, which Psychiatrist recorded in his report.\r\nAttorney subsequently provided a copy of Psychiatrist's report to the solicitor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, the solicitor subpoenaed Psychiatrist to testify concerning\r\nThompson's statements. Thompson objected and argued the statements were\r\nprotected by the attorney-client privilege. The trial judge ruled that the\r\nprosecution could not use Psychiatrist's testimony in its case-in-chief, but\r\ncould use it to impeach Thompson if he testified at trial. Thompson did not\r\ntestify before the jury, but did proffer in camera testimony concerning his\r\nstatements to Psychiatrist.\r\n\r\n\r\nThompson was found guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first\r\ndegree and sentenced to thirty years in prison. He appealed his conviction\r\nand sentence. Before the Court of Appeals, Thompson argued, inter alia, that\r\nthe trial judge erred in making a preliminary ruling allowing the prosecution\r\n\r\n\r\np. 50\r\n\r\nSTATE v.THOMPSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto use privileged information to impeach him if he testified at trial.\r\nThompson further argued that the ruling effectively prevented him from\r\ntestifying at trial. The Court of Appeals held that Thompson waived his\r\nattorney-client privilege with Psychiatrist. State v. Thompson, Op. No. 96-\r\nUP-132 (S.C. Ct. App. filed. April 30, 1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe granted Thompson's petition for a writ of certiorari to consider the\r\nfollowing issue:\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in finding Thompson waived his attorney-\r\nclient privilege?\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Attorney-Client Privilege\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Hitopoulus, 279 S.C. 549, 309 S.E.2d 747 (1983), we held\r\nthat the attorney-client privilege extends to communications between the\r\nclient and a psychiatrist retained to aid in the preparation of a case. ln\r\nHitopoulus, we adopted the balancing test enunciated in United States ex.\r\nrel. Edney v. Smith, 425 F. Supp. 1038 (E.D.N.Y. 1976). Under this test, a\r\ncourt, in determining whether the attorney-client privilege extends to\r\ncommunications between a client and a non-lawyer, must balance two factors:\r\n(1) the need of the attorney for the assistance of the non-lawyer to effectively\r\nrepresent his client, and (2) the increased potential for inaccuracy in the\r\nsearch for truth as the trier of fact is deprived of valuable witnesses.\r\nHowever, before reaching this test, a court must ascertain whether the\r\ncommunication is confidential in nature. State v. Smith, 286 S.C. 406, 334\r\nS.E.2d 2-17 (1985).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues that the attorney-client privilege does not extend to\r\nThompson's communications with Psychiatrist because Thompson could not\r\nhave expected the information to be confidential as it was made in\r\ncontemplation of publication to the State for plea negotiations. We disagree.\r\nPsychiatrist interviewed Thompson privately, and elicited remarks in order\r\nto diagnose Thompson's mental condition. Psychiatrist's ability to make an\r\naccurate recommendation hinged on Thompson's willingness to talk freely.\r\nThis sort of uninhibited dialogue is predicated on an implied promise of\r\nconfidentiality. See United States ex. rel. Edney v. Smith, 425 F. Supp. at\r\n1043. Without confidentiality, accurate diagnosis is compromised. See id.\r\n(\"Confidentiality is a sine qua non for successful psychiatric treatment.\"). We\r\ntherefore begin with the presumption that Thompson expected his statements\r\n\r\n\r\np. 51\r\n\r\nSTATE v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto be confidential. The fact that Thompson knew Attorney intended to use\r\nPsychiatrist's recommendation to negotiate a plea agreement with the State\r\ndoes not overcome this presumption. It is more reasonable that Thompson\r\nexpected Attorney would make a recommendation without revealing his\r\nactual statements.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State next argues that the attorney-client privilege does not extend\r\nto Thompson's communications because Psychiatrist was not hired by\r\nThompson in an effort to prepare a legal defense. In support of its argument,\r\nthe State cites State v. Smith. In Smith, the prosecution called the\r\ndefendant's psychologist to rebut expert testimony concerning insanity. The\r\ndefendant argued that the State's actions violated his attorney-client\r\nprivilege. We disagreed and held that the rule in Hitopoulus was\r\ninapplicable because there was no evidence that the defendant's psychologist\r\nwas hired to help establish the defendant's insanity defense; instead, the\r\npsychologist was employed solely to assist in jury selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State interprets Smith and Hitopoulus as standing for the\r\nproposition that a communication can be privileged only if the expert is\r\nemployed to aid in the preparation of a legal defense. We do not find the\r\nprivilege to be this narrow. \"[I]n criminal causes, communications made by\r\na defendant to an expert in order to equip that expert with the necessary\r\ninformation to provide the defendant's attorney with the tools to aid him in\r\ngiving his client proper legal advice are within the scope of the attorney-\r\nclient privilege.\" State v. Pratt, 398 A.2d 421, 423-24 (Md. 1979). Without\r\nPsychiatrist's recommendation, Attorney could not have effectively pursued\r\nthe treatment program during plea negotiations. Thus, balancing the two\r\nfactors in Hitopoulus, we find the attorney-client privilege extends to\r\nThompson's communications with Psychiatrist.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Waiver of Attorney-Client Privilege\r\n\r\n\r\nThompson argues that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that he\r\nwaived his attorney-client privilege with Psychiatrist. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attorney-client privilege belongs solely to the client and can only\r\nbe waived by the client. State v. Love, 275 S.C. 55, 271 S.E.2d 110 (1980).\r\n\"Although a client may waive his attorney-client privilege, the waiver must\r\nbe distinct and unequivocal.\" State v. Hitopoulus, 279 S.C. at 551, 309\r\nS.E.2d at 749.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that Thompson impliedly waived his\r\n\r\n\r\np. 52\r\n\r\nSTATE v. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattorney-client privilege because he should have known that it was necessary\r\nfor Attorney to disclose the statements in order to effectively negotiate a plea\r\nagreement. We disagree. \"[W]here an implied waiver is claimed, caution\r\nmust be exercised, for waiver will not be implied from doubtful acts.\" 28 Am.\r\nJur. 2d Estoppel and Waiver Â§ 160 (1966). As stated above, it is more\r\nreasonable that Thompson expected Attorney would make a recommendation\r\nbased on Psychiatrist's report, without revealing his actual statements.\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Thompson made a distinct and\r\nunequivocal waiver.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find that the trial court's ruling prevented Thompson from testifying\r\nat trial and therefore, violated the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments\r\nto the United States Constitution. See Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 107\r\nS. Ct. 2704, 97 L. Ed.2d 37 (1987).\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED and the case REMANDED for a new trial consistent with this\r\nopinion.1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The analysis in this case has limited, future application since this\r\nscenario would now be governed by Rule 410(4), SCRE. Rule 410(4) provides,\r\n\"any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for\r\nthe prosecuting authority which do not result in a plea of guilty or which\r\nresult in a plea of guilty later withdrawn\" is not admissible against the\r\ndefendant. Rule 410 is not controlling here because it became effective on\r\nSeptember 3, 1995; Thompson was convicted in 1994. We note, however, that\r\nthe result which would be reached under Rule 410(4) is consistent with the\r\nholding in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 53\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24745","title":"Douglas Lewis v.

FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1984, Douglas Lewis was hired as a machinist by Fisher Service\r\nCompany (\"Employer\"). On the day Lewis began working for Employer, he\r\nreceived a copy of a manual entitled \"Practices and Policies.\" The manual\r\nprovided for a progressive discipline policy, but also contained an override\r\nprovision stating that when an employee's conduct violated \"very serious and\r\nwidely-recognized behavior standards,\" the employee could be terminated on\r\nthe first offense.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 1991, Lewis applied for a position as a quality control inspector\r\nand was interviewed by supervisor Andy Simpson. Using a pocket tape-\r\nrecorder, Lewis tape-recorded his meeting with Mr. Simpson. The tape of the\r\ninterview was later played in the break area for other employees. When\r\nEmployer learned of the taping incident, it determined that Lewis had\r\nviolated \"very serious and widely-recognized behavior standards.\" Employer\r\nterminated him without engaging in progressive discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, Lewis brought a breach of contract action against\r\nEmployer. In his complaint, Lewis contended that Employer demoted and\r\nthen discharged him in violation of the progressive discipline policies\r\ncontained in Employer's employee handbook. See Small v. Springs Industries,\r\nInc., 292 S.C. 481, 357 S.E.2d 452 (1987). The case was initially tried in\r\nJune 1993.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, Lewis contended that he told Simpson the interview would be\r\ntaped. Lewis further claimed that a fellow employee had played the tape in\r\nthe break area for other employees to hear. Employer asserted that the\r\ntaping was done surreptitiously and that it was Lewis who played the tape\r\nin the break area.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of Lewis in the amount of $400,000\r\nactual damages, representing back pay and front pay. For reasons unrelated\r\nto this certification, the Court set aside the first verdict and ordered a new\r\ntrial on both liability and damages. The case was tried again in June 1994,\r\nand the second jury awarded Lewis $355,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the second verdict, Employer moved for a judgment as a matter\r\nof law, or, alternatively, for a new trial. Employer argued that the\r\nsurreptitious taping of an interview with a superior, coupled with the later\r\nplaying of that tape for other employees, justified Lewis's immediate\r\ntermination. The Court found that the surreptitious taping of an employee\r\n\r\n\r\np. 55\r\n\r\nLEWIS v. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterview was sufficiently serious to warrant a bypass of the progressive\r\ndiscipline policy contained in Employer's employee handbook. The Court,\r\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Lewis, determined that\r\n(1) the jury could have found that Lewis told Simpson the tape was being\r\nmade, and (2) the jury could have found that another employee, and not\r\nLewis, played the tape for other employees.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter determining that the verdict should not be disturbed, the Court\r\nwas then called upon to address the after-acquired evidence doctrine.\r\nSubsequent to Lewis's initiation of this action, Employer learned during a\r\ndeposition that Lewis had engaged in other acts of misconduct justifying his\r\ntermination. Specifically, Lewis admitted in his deposition that he had\r\nsurreptitiously taped one or perhaps two other interviews with members of\r\nmanagement. Unlike the Simpson episode, however, it is undisputed that\r\nLewis never told the other parties to these conversations that they were\r\nbeing taped. Lewis admitted that before his termination he had secretly\r\nrecorded a conversation with general manager David Suk, without Suk's\r\nknowledge, and had \"probably\" surreptitiously recorded a conversation with\r\nshop manager Jeff Klatt. At trial, Suk testified that the act of secretly tape-\r\nrecording a member of management constituted serious misconduct. He\r\nfurther testified that he was unaware Lewis had recorded conversations with\r\nhim and that had he known Lewis was making the surreptitious recordings,\r\nhe would have immediately terminated Lewis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA determination of whether, and to what extent, South Carolina\r\nrecognizes the after-acquired evidence doctrine in employee handbook cases\r\nwould enable the federal District Court to dispose of the post-trial motion\r\nnow pending before it. Accordingly, the following questions have been\r\ncertified to this Court:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Does South Carolina recognize the after-acquired evidence doctrine\r\nas a defense to an action brought by an employee terminated in violation of\r\nthe progressive discipline policy of an applicable employee handbook?\r\n\r\n\r\n2. If the answer to question one is in the affirmative, in what form and\r\nto what extent is the defense of after-acquired evidence recognized in South\r\nCarolina? Specifically, may the doctrine be used to avoid liability altogether,\r\nor to avoid liability from the date of discovery forward (thus allowing a back\r\npay award from the date of termination until the date of discovery), or to\r\navoid liability from the date of judgment forward (thus allowing a recovery\r\nof back pay from the date of termination until the date of judgment)?\r\n\r\n\r\np. 56\r\n\r\nLEWIS v. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nThe questions certified in this action ask us to determine whether, and\r\nto what extent, the after-acquired evidence doctrine implies in employee\r\nhandbook breach of contract actions. The answers to these questions need\r\nto be sought within the context of the historical development of the after-\r\nacquired evidence doctrine and the rationales underlying its application.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Development of the After-Acquired Evidence Doctrine\r\n\r\n\r\nSummers v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, 864\r\nF.2d 700 (10th Cir. 1988) provides a starting point for consideration of the\r\nafter-acquired evidence doctrine. In this seminal case, an employee brought\r\nan action against State Farm for discrimination on the basis of age and\r\nreligion. In the course of discovery, State Farm found evidence of 150\r\ninstances where the employee had falsified records. It sought to have this\r\nevidence admitted against employee. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit held that\r\nsuch after-acquired evidence could be admitted to bar relief for the employee.\r\nIn reaching its conclusion, the Court gave the following analogy that has\r\nsince been often cited in discussions about the after-acquired evidence\r\ndoctrine: \"The present case is akin to the hypothetical wherein a company\r\ndoctor is fired because of his age, race, religion, and sex and the company,\r\nin defending a civil rights action, thereafter discovers that the discharged\r\nemployee was not a 'doctor.' In our view, the masquerading doctor would be\r\nentitled to no relief ......\" Summers, 864 F.2d at 708.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Wallace v. Dunn Construction Company, 968 F.2d 1174 (11th Cir.\r\n1992), the Eleventh Circuit rejected the Summers rule that after-acquired\r\nevidence may \"effectively provide an affirmative defense to Title VII liability.\"\r\nWallace, 968 F.2d at 1181. Wallace declared that the Summers rule was\r\n\"antithetical to the principal purpose of Title VII -- to achieve equality of\r\nemployment opportunity by giving employers incentives to self-examine and\r\nself-evaluate their employment practices and to endeavor to eliminate, so far\r\nas possible, employment discrimination.\" Wallace, 968 F.2d at 1180 (internal\r\ncitations omitted). Instead, the Eleventh Circuit held that after-acquired\r\nevidence may be allowed on the issue of damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1995, the split between the federal circuits was resolved by the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court in McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing\r\nCompany, 513 U.S. 352, 115 S. Ct. 879, 130 L. Ed. 2d 852 (1995). McKennon\r\ninvolved an action brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\r\nof 1967 (\"ADEA\"). The Supreme Court noted that the ADEA and Title VII\r\n\r\n\r\np. 57\r\n\r\nLEWIS v. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshare common substantive features and also a common purpose: the\r\nelimination of discrimination in the workplace. Deterring discrimination and\r\ncompensating for injuries caused by prohibited discrimination are two\r\nobjectives of these statutes. The McKennon Court wrote that \"It would not\r\naccord with this scheme if after-acquired evidence of wrongdoing that would\r\nhave resulted in termination operates, in every instance, to bar all relief for\r\nan earlier violation of the Act.\" McKennon, 513 U.S. at 358,, 115 S. Ct. at\r\n884, 130 L. Ed. 2d at 861. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the\r\nlower court, which had allowed after-acquired evidence to serve as a complete\r\nbar to recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcKennon rejected the use of after-acquired evidence on the issue of\r\nliability; however, it did consider the evidence relevant to the remedy to be\r\nordered: \"The employee's wrongdoing must be taken into account, we\r\nconclude, lest the employer's legitimate concerns be ignored.\"1 McKennon,\r\n513 U.S. at 361, 115 S. Ct. at 886, 130 L. Ed. 2d at 863. The Supreme\r\nCourt set the following threshold standard for admitting after-acquired\r\nevidence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Where an employer seeks to rely upon after-acquired evidence of\r\n  wrongdoing, it must first establish that the wrongdoing was of\r\n  such severity that the employee in fact would have been\r\n  terminated on those grounds alone if the employer had known of\r\n  it at the time of the discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcKennon, 513 U.S. at 362-63, 115 S. Ct. at 886-87, 130 L. Ed. 2d at 864.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe adopted the McKennon standard in Baber v. Greenville County, __\r\nS.C. __, 488 S.E.2d 314 (1997) in the context of a whistleblower's suit.\r\nBaber had brought an action, under the Whistleblower's Act, alleging he was\r\nterminated as a result of his refusal to delete portions of an audit report he\r\nhad prepared detailing the County Tax Collector's waiver of penalties for\r\ncertain parties. The trial court allowed the County to introduce evidence\r\nacquired during discovery concerning Baber's poor job performance on the tax\r\naudit; however, the court charged the jury not to consider the after-acquired\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The Court stated that although as a general rule reinstatement and\r\nfront pay would not be appropriate, backpay is possible in instances of\r\nemployee misconduct discovered after termination. The calculation of the\r\nbackpay is from \"the date of the unlawful discharge to the date the new\r\ninformation was discovered.\" McKennon, 513 U.S. at 362, 115 S. Ct. at 886,\r\n130 L. Ed. 2d at 864.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 58\r\n\r\nLEWIS v. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevidence. On appeal, we accepted the McKennon test for determining\r\nwhether after-acquired evidence may be used to limit employee damages. We\r\nconcluded that the wrongdoing was not of such severity that the employee in\r\nfact would have been terminated on those grounds alone if the employer had\r\nknown of it at the time of the discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of other jurisdictions have also followed the McKennon\r\napproach of allowing, in certain cases, after-acquired evidence on the issue\r\nof damages. Recently, the Texas Supreme Court adopted the McKennon test,\r\nholding that after-acquired evidence can serve as a limitation on an\r\nemployee's recovery for a retaliatory discharge claim brought under the Texas\r\nWorkers' Compensation Act. Trico Technologies Corp. v. Montiel, 949 S.W.2d\r\n308 (Tex. 1997). Likewise, in Walters v. United States Gypsum Company,\r\n537 N.W.2d 708 (Iowa 1995), the Iowa Supreme Court adopted the McKennon\r\nstandard for purposes of retaliatory discharge/discrimination actions. The\r\nemployee had claimed that she had been discharged from her employment\r\nbecause she had filed a civil rights complaint against her employer. In an\r\naction involving sexual harassment, constructive discharge, and retaliation,\r\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals recently reaffirmed its rule that an employee\r\nis not barred from all relief as a matter of law for after-acquired evidence of\r\nmisconduct, but that any wrongdoing could be reflected in the nature of the\r\nrelief awarded to him. Horn v. Dep't of Corrections, 548 N.W.2d 660 (Mich.\r\nCt. App. 1996). See also Thompson v. Better-Bilt Aluminum Prods. Co., 927\r\nP.2d 781 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1996)(finding that public policy does not preclude,\r\nin action involving wrongful termination for filing of a workers' compensation\r\nclaim, an employer from presenting after-acquired evidence of application\r\nfraud when the jury is instructed as to the significance of such evidence on\r\nthe measure of damages); Barlow v. Hester Industries, Inc., 479 S.E.2d 628\r\n(W. Va. 1996)(adopting the McKennon standard for employment discrimina-\r\ntion cases).\r\n\r\n\r\nCourts, however, have not been unanimous in their adoption of the\r\nMcKennon approach. Some jurisdictions have held that after-acquired\r\nevidence can serve as a complete bar to employee claims. In Crawford\r\nRehabilitation Services, Inc. v. Weissman, 938 P.2d 540 (Colo. 1997)(en banc),\r\nthe Colorado Supreme Court declined to apply the limitations placed on the\r\nafter-acquired evidence doctrine by McKennon to claims for breach of implied\r\ncontract and promissory estoppel. It held that after-acquired evidence of\r\nresume fraud may provide an employer with a complete defense to such\r\nclaims. Similarly, in Gassman v. Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan\r\nSociety, Inc., 933 P.2d 743 (Kan. 1997), the court held that as to ordinary\r\nwrongful discharge breach of employment contract cases not involving any\r\n\r\n\r\np. 59\r\n\r\nLEWIS v. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverriding governmental interest, the limits placed on the after-acquired\r\nevidence doctrine by McKennon are not applicable, and the employee is not\r\nentitled to any relief if the employer can establish after-acquired evidence\r\nsufficient for termination. See also Camp v. Jeffer, Mangels, Butler &amp;\r\nMarmaro, 41 Cal. Rptr. 2d 329 (Cal. Ct. App. 2 Dist. 1995')(finding employees'\r\nmisrepresentations about their felony convictions related directly to their\r\nwrongful termination claims; since they were not lawfully qualified for their\r\njobs, they cannot be heard to complain that they improperly lost them.).\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Application to Certified Questions\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the cases cited above reveals a clear distinction between\r\nthose allowing after-acquired evidence on the issue of liability and those that\r\nhave not. The cases that have allowed use of after-acquired evidence to bar\r\nrecovery by the employee have involved causes of action, such as breaches of\r\ncontract, which implicate purely private concerns. See, e.g., Crawford\r\nRehabilitation Servs., Inc., 938 P.2d 540 (breach of implied contract and\r\npromissory estoppel); Gassman, 933 P.2d 743 (breach of employment\r\ncontract). On the other hand, cases disallowing use of after-acquired evidence\r\non the issue of liability have implicated major public policy concerns, such as\r\nprevention of discrimination or preservation of workers' compensation rights.\r\nSee, e.g., Trico Technologies Corp., 949 S.W.2d 308 (retaliatory discharge\r\nunder workers' compensation act); Walters, 537 N.W.2d 708 (retaliatory\r\ndischarge/discrimination actions); Horn, 548 N.W.2d 660 (sexual harassment,\r\nconstructive discharge, and retaliation); Thompson, 927 P.2d 781 (wrongful\r\ntermination for filing workers' compensation claim); Barlow, 479 S.E.2d 628\r\n(employment discrimination).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court in Crawford Rehabilitation Services observed that the\r\nemployee's breach of implied contract and promissory estoppel claims did not\r\nimplicate the McKennon-type public-policy interests of elimination of\r\ndiscrimination in the work-place. See Crawford Rehabilitation Servs., 938\r\nP.2d at 549. Similarly, the New Jersey Supreme Court has stated that \"The\r\npolicy concerns that are at stake in applying the after-acquired evidence\r\ndefense to an unlawful discharge based on invidious discrimination differ\r\nfrom those that are implicated in private-employment-contract actions ...\"\r\nNicosia v. Wakefem Food Corp., 643 A.2d 554, 563 (N.J. 1994); see also\r\nSchuessler v. Benchmark Marketing &amp; Consulting, 500 N.W.2d 529, 541\r\n(Neb. 1993)(\"Breach of a contract does not give rise to the same concerns or\r\ndemand the same protections as does an action based on discrimination.\").\r\nWe find this distinction persuasive.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 60\r\n\r\nLEWIS v. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcKennon disallowed the use of after-acquired evidence on the issue\r\nof liability in order to serve the public policy reasons underlying ADEA and\r\nTitle VII, which include deterrence of discrimination, and compensation for\r\ninjuries caused by prohibited discrimination. We adopted the same approach\r\nin Baber in an action involving the Whistleblower's Act. Baber, __ S.C.__,\r\n488 S.E.2d 314. An action brought under the Whistleblower's Act is a suit\r\nagainst a public employer by a public employee claiming to have been subject\r\nto adverse personnel action in retaliation for having exposed governmental\r\nwrongdoing. The Act is remedial and seeks to foster good government for the\r\nbenefit of the people of South Carolina by affording protection to\r\ngovernmental employees, the most obvious and important sources of\r\ninformation on the conduct of government. See Spencer v. Bamwell County\r\nHosp., 314 S.C. 405, 444 S.E.2d 538 (Ct. App. 1994). Clearly, a whistle-\r\nblower's action implicates major public policy concerns. Such public policy\r\nconcerns, however, are not so prominently present in employee-employer\r\ncontract disputes, which simply involve the rights of private parties in\r\nrelation to one another. Accordingly, we conclude that the rationales\r\nunderlying McKennon and Baber are inapplicable in employment contract\r\ncases. As such, there should not be an absolute bar to the use of after-\r\nacquired evidence on the issue of liability in employee handbook breach of\r\ncontract actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we find that after-acquired evidence should be admissible on\r\nthe issue of liability, we recognize the potential dangers of allowing employers\r\nunrestricted use of such evidence. If free reign were given, then in defending\r\nbreach of employment contract actions, less-than-principled employers (or\r\ntheir attorneys) may be tempted to \"rummage the file\" in order to \"discover\"\r\nany and all evidence that would permit them to escape liability. For\r\nexample, an employer that has been inclined to overlook his employees'\r\npeccadillos (e.g. occasional tardiness), might suddenly claim, in response to\r\na breach of contract action, that the employee would have been fired had the\r\nemployer been aware of the tardiness. Thus, we conclude that although\r\nafter-acquired evidence should be allowed on the issue of liability, certain\r\nlimitations must be put into place so as to prevent abuse by employers. This\r\ncan be achieved by restricting use of after-acquired evidence in two ways.\r\nFirst, the employer must prove that the wrongdoing was significant, that it\r\nwas of \"such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated\r\non those grounds alone if the employer had known of it at the time of the\r\ndischarge.\" See Baber, __S.C. at__, 488 S.E.2d at 320 (quoting\r\nMcKennon). Thus, evidence of employee wrongdoing that would not have\r\nresulted in termination would not be admissible. Second, this proof must be\r\nestablished, not by a preponderance of the evidence, but by clear and\r\n\r\n\r\np. 61\r\n\r\nLEWIS v. FISHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvincing evidence. We believe that these two limitations will serve to\r\nexclude doubtful or insignificant evidence of employee wrongdoing, while\r\nallowing evidence of very severe wrongdoing that should properly be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, in response to the certified questions, we reply that South\r\nCarolina recognizes the after-acquired evidence doctrine as a defense to an\r\naction brought by an employee terminated in violation of the progressive\r\ndiscipline policy of an applicable employee handbook. Within this context,\r\nthe evidence may serve to allow the employer to avoid liability altogether, if\r\nby clear and convincing evidence it is proven that the employee's wrongdoing\r\nwas of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated\r\non those grounds alone if the employer had known of it at the time of the\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C..J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 62\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24746","title":"David L.

McGuire, all\r\n  of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J.: This Court granted certiorari to review the\r\ndenial of petitioner's application for post-conviction relief.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 63\r\n\r\nBURGESS v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner was convicted of first degree criminal sexual conduct and\r\nkidnapping. He was sentenced to consecutive terms of thirty years and life\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner chose to testify at his trial. While the solicitor was cross-\r\nexamining petitioner, he asked petitioner to explain why the victim identified\r\nhim as the person who kidnapped and molested her. He also asked\r\npetitioner to explain why three other witnesses presented by the state\r\nidentified him as the man they saw in the vicinity of the crime scene on the\r\nday the crime occurred. The solicitor asked petitioner to give the jury a\r\nreason why one of these witnesses would lie. After petitioner contradicted\r\nthe testimony of another of these witnesses, the solicitor asked, \"She's lying,\r\ntoo?\" Petitioner would not accuse any witness of lying, causing the solicitor\r\nto then ask, \"So everybody's wrong except poor old [petitioner]?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner applied for post-conviction relief, alleging his counsel was\r\nineffective for failing to object when the solicitor improperly pitted him\r\nagainst four of the state's witnesses. The court below found \"[t]he Solicitor's\r\nquestions did not necessarily force [petitioner] to attack the veracity of the\r\nwitnesses, but rather gave him the opportunity to explain any biases the\r\nwitnesses may have had.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinction drawn by the post-conviction relief judge follows\r\nlanguage from State v. Wells, __ S.C. __, 426 S.E.2d 814 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nIn Wells, the Court of Appeals distinguished between pitting witnesses and\r\nmerely asking questions to uncover bias. In that case, the solicitor asked the\r\ndefendant if he knew of any reason why the state's witness would come into\r\nthe courtroom and accuse him of murder. In that context, the court could not\r\n\"say the solicitor sought to force [the defendant] to attack the veracity of [the\r\nstate's witness]. The focus of the solicitor's questioning was to uncover any\r\nbias by [the state's witness], not to encourage [the defendant] to state [the\r\nstate's witness] was lying.\" 426 S.E.2d at 816.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the distinction made in Wells is illogical. A solicitor would\r\nnever try to discredit a state's witness by uncovering potential bias during\r\ncross-examination of a defendant. Uncovering bias of the state's witnesses\r\nwould be the concern of a defense attorney and would either be done during\r\ncross-examination of the state's witnesses or during direct examination of the\r\ndefendant. Therefore, the distinction drawn by Wells is unsound.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how a question is worded, anytime a solicitor asks a\r\ndefendant to comment on the truthfulness or explain the testimony of an\r\n\r\n\r\np. 64\r\n\r\nBURGESS v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadverse witness, the defendant is in effect being pitted against the adverse\r\nwitness. This kind of argumentative questioning is improper. State v.\r\nBryant, 316 S.C. 216, 221, 447 S.E.2d 852, 855 (1994); State v. Sapps, 295\r\nS.C. 484, 486, 369 S.E.2d 145, 145-46 (1988). \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, improper pitting constitutes reversible error only if the\r\naccused is unfairly prejudiced. Id. To establish his claim of ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel, petitioner had to show a reasonable probability that the\r\nresult of his trial would have been different if counsel had objected to the\r\nsolicitor's improper questions. Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733\r\n(1997). A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine\r\nconfidence in the outcome of a trial. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the record, we do not find petitioner was prejudiced by\r\nhis counsel's failure to object to the solicitor's improper questions. In light\r\nof the evidence presented, this error does not undermine confidence in the\r\noutcome of this case. Accordingly, the dismissal of petitioner's application for\r\npost conviction relief is affirmed. To the extent State v. Wells is inconsistent\r\nwith this opinion, it is hereby overruled.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 65\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24747","title":"In the Matter of Harvey L.

Mark Taylor, of Kirkland, Wilson, Moore, Allen, Taylor &amp;\r\nO'Day, P.A., of West Columbia; David H. Wilkins, of Wilkins &amp;\r\nMadden, P.A., of Greenville; and John P. Freeman, of Columbia,\r\nall for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles Molony Condon and Senior Assistant\r\nAttorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., of Columbia, for\r\nComplainant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney grievance matter, the Respondent\r\nHarvey L. Golden (\"Attorney\") is alleged to have committed misconduct by\r\nmaking gratuitously insulting, threatening, and demeaning comments in the\r\ncourse of two depositions. It is alleged that Attorney's conduct violated Rules\r\n4.4 and 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, and\r\nsection 5 of the Rule of Disciplinary Procedure, former Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nAttorney denies any misconduct. He contends his actions during the\r\ndepositions were reasonable and necessary to obtain responses from hostile\r\nwitnesses. Attorney further asserts his comments after one deposition were\r\nmerely intended to be humorous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo members of the hearing Panel found misconduct as alleged and\r\nrecommended attorney be privately reprimanded for misconduct; one Panel\r\nmember recommended the matter be dismissed. The Interim Review\r\n\r\n\r\np. 3\r\n\r\nIn The Matter of Golden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee unanimously adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law\r\nset forth in the majority's Panel Report. As to the sanction, all committee\r\nmembers participating1 recommended some form of public sanction. Three\r\nvoted that Attorney be suspended from the practice of law for thirty days;\r\nthree voted that he be publicly reprimanded. After hearing arguments of\r\ncounsel, reviewing the record, including the court reporter's tape recording of\r\none of the depositions, and considering the applicable law, we find the\r\nappropriate sanction is a public reprimand.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith Deposition\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney represented Mrs. Doe in a divorce action.2 Pursuant to a\r\ntemporary order, Mrs. Doe was receiving alimony. Attorney advised Mrs. Doe\r\nshe could jeopardize her alimony if she had a boyfriend prior to her divorce.\r\nMrs. Doe ended her relationship with Mr. Smith, apparently as a result of\r\nthis advice. Thereafter, Mr. Smith contacted Mr. Doe's attorney and\r\ninformed her he was having an adulterous relationship with Mrs. Doe. Based\r\non this information, Mr. Doe filed a motion to terminate Mrs. Doe's alimony.\r\nAttorney noticed Mr. Smith's deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December 1994, Attorney deposed Mr. Smith. Smith was not\r\nrepresented by counsel at the deposition. He was a retired school teacher\r\nwho had been hospitalized for emotional problems on six occasions within the\r\nprevious fifteen years. He suffered from several disabilities including injuries\r\nto his lower back as the result of an automobile accident, debilitating\r\nmigraine headaches, and bipolar affective disorder for which he was being\r\ntreated with a series of psychotropic medications. The witness's physical and\r\nmental disabilities were fully known to Attorney who agreed that Smith was\r\nnot mentally well.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed both the written transcript and the audio recording\r\nof the deposition. The following are a few examples from the deposition\r\ntranscript that illustrate Attorney's conduct at the deposition:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1One member of the Interim Review Committee did not participate in\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n2Due to the sensitive nature of these matters, pseudonyms have been\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 4\r\n\r\nIn The Matter of Golden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp [Attorney]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp And who was your lawyer in your first\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp divorce?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp  [Smith]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Me.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp  [Attorney]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Was that because you are cheap or you\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp think you are smart enough to be your\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp own lawyer?

Guaranteed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(16) Attorney referred to Smith, who had been a patient at Charter\r\nHospital, as an \"inmate\" of the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n(17) Smith injured his back moving a box of books while preparing for the\r\nschool year. Attorney asked Smith, who was a teacher, if he was the janitor:\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp  [Attorney]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   You are not a janitor, are you?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp  [Smith]: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Huh?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp  [Attorney]: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   You are not the janitor, are you?\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp  [Smith]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Gee, now what kind of question was that?\r\n....\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp  [Attorney]:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ... When you said you get the desks in\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp order, that's something for the janitor to\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp do, get the desks in order?\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney testified the purpose of Mr. Smith's deposition was to destroy\r\nMr. Smith's credibility. He denied he had any intent to embarrass, delay, or\r\n\r\n\r\np. 7\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Golden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\notherwise burden Mr. Smith, or to pollute the administration of justice.\r\nAttorney admitted he made some mistakes in the deposition. For instance,\r\nhe stated he allowed Mr. Smith to \"get to him\" and admitted he should have\r\nset the tone for the deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nJones Deposition\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May 1994, Attorney, who was representing Mr. Jones, deposed Mrs.\r\nJones, the adverse party in a domestic proceeding. Mrs. Jones's attorney was\r\npresent during the course of her deposition, although some of the alleged\r\ncomments by Attorney took place off the record when her attorney was not\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grievance complaint alleged that after the deposition, Attorney\r\nstated to Mrs. Jones: \"You are a mean-spirited, vicious witch and I don't like\r\nyour face and I don't like your voice. What I'd like, is to be locked in a room\r\nwith you naked with a very sharp knife.\" Thereafter, it is alleged that\r\nAttorney said: \"What we need for her [pointing to Mrs. Jones] is a big bag\r\nto put her in without the mouth cut out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Panel hearing, Mrs. Jones testified as follows regarding\r\nAttorney's comments after the deposition:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n. . .It was at the end, and the court reporter was beginning to\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nput her things away. [Attorney] pushed all of his papers at me\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nlike that, and he leaned across the table, and he pointed his\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nfinger, and he said, \"You are a meanspirited, vicious witch, and\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nI don't like your face, and I don't like your voice, and what I\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nwant,\" and at that point he stood up, and he screamed, \"What I\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nwant is to be locked in a room naked with you with a sharp\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nknife,\" and I said, \"Naked?\" He said, \"Yes, naked with a sharp --\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nlocked in a room naked,\" and I said \"Uh,\" . . . I then said to\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[Attorney], \"What? Naked? What are you going to do? . . .\" And\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nhe said, \"No, I will kill you with the thing.\" And at that point\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n...,  the paralegal for [opposing counsel], came in . . . and\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[Attorney] then pointed ... and he said to [the paralegal], \"what\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nwe need for her is a big bag to put her in without the mouth cut\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposing counsel's legal assistant testified that during a break in the\r\ndeposition, she entered the conference room to give opposing counsel a note.\r\nShe testified she heard Attorney state that he would like to put a plastic bag\r\n\r\n\r\np. 8\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Golden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout any air holes over Mrs. Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his answer, Attorney \"adamantly denie[d]\" making the \"big bag\"\r\ncomment. However, during the Panel hearing, he admitted making the \"big\r\nbag\" comment, but stated Mrs. Jones took it out of context. Secondly, he\r\ncontended that he had jokingly said that the only way the matter could be\r\nresolved would be to lock Mr. and Mrs. Jones naked in a room with a knife\r\non the table and let the better participant emerge triumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Smith matter, the Hearing Panel concluded that\r\nAttorney's actions demonstrated\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nhis total disregard and failure to show any respect for the rights\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nof a third party. The extent, the intensity, the sarcasm and\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nmaliciousness, the unnecessary combativeness, the gratuitous\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nthreatening and intimidation, and the unequivocal bad manners\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nof [Attorney's] conduct could have been for no purpose other than\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nto embarrass or burden [Mr. Smith].\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Panel found Attorney's conduct in the Smith deposition violated\r\nRule 4.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR. Rule 4.4\r\nprovides, in part: \"In representing a client, a lawyer shall not use means\r\nthat have no purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third\r\nperson . . . .\" The Panel concluded Attorney had no legitimate purpose for\r\nhis conduct. We concur with the Panel's analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney's words speak for themselves. Even if we assume that the\r\ndeposition witness was uncooperative, Attorney would not be justified abusing\r\nthis witness in the manner illustrated above. The record further shows that\r\nAttorney interrupted Smith on numerous occasions. Moreover, the audio\r\nrecording reveals the volume of Attorney's voice was repeatedly loud, and his\r\nstatements were sarcastic, rude, or otherwise inappropriate. He acted in a\r\nthreatening and demeaning manner. His conduct was outrageous and\r\ncompletely departed from the standards of our profession, much less basic\r\nnotions of human decency and civility.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile attacking a witness's credibility is a legitimate and often\r\nnecessary objective, Attorney's conduct at the Smith deposition went far\r\nbeyond this purpose. We find Attorney's bullying of a mentally unstable\r\nwitness in the Smith deposition an utterly inappropriate trial tactic.\r\n\r\n\r\np.9\r\n\r\nIn The Matter of Golden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Smith was a hostile witness,3 Attorney's behavior was\r\nunwarranted. If he truly thought Mr. Smith was intentionally being\r\nunresponsive and recalcitrant, Attorney could have recessed the deposition\r\nand moved the family court for an order requiring Mr. Smith to respond\r\nappropriately. We find, by clear and convincing evidence, that Attorney used\r\nmeans that had no purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third\r\nperson. Thus, he has violated Rule 4.4 by his conduct at the Smith\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Jones deposition, the Panel concluded Attorney had\r\ncommented off the record that Mrs. Jones was \"mean spirited,\" that someone\r\nshould be \"locked in a room naked\" with her, and that he would like to put\r\na bag over her without a hole for her mouth. They found that Attorney\r\nmade these comments in an agitated tone of voice. The Panel did not believe\r\nthese comments were an attempt at humor, but rather, the Panel found\r\nAttorney's comments were intended to be insulting and degrading. It\r\nconcluded that Attorney's conduct tended to pollute the administration of\r\njustice and to bring the legal profession into disrepute. This conclusion was\r\nreached based on testimony of Mrs. Jones, of the legal assistant, and of\r\nopposing counsel who overheard Attorney saying \"mean spirited\" and \"locked\r\nin a room naked.\" Moreover, Attorney's credibility was damaged by his self-\r\ncontradiction as to the \"big bag\" comment. Initially, he adamantly denied\r\nmaking the comment, but he later claimed at the Panel hearing that the\r\ncomment was taken out of context. We fully agree with the Panel's\r\nconclusions. We find Attorney's comments after the Jones deposition could\r\nnot possibly be interpreted as humorous, particularly in light of the serious\r\nnature of the issues and highly charged atmosphere of the deposition.\r\nAttorney's comments only served to insult an adverse party. Rule 8.4 of the\r\nRules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, is violated when a lawyer\r\nengages in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. See also Rule\r\n413, parag. 5.D, Rule on Disciplinary Procedure. We find, by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence, that Attorney violated these rules by his misconduct at\r\nthe Jones deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe remind the Bar that although a deposition is not conducted in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The transcript and tape recording indicate Mr. Smith was suspicious\r\n\r\nand often difficult; at times, Mr. Smith yelled and once threatened to turn\r\nover the conference table. This outburst took place after Smith had been\r\nrepeatedly ridiculed and bullied by Attorney. Attorney testified he\r\ndeliberately attempted to provoke Smith into an outburst so as to damage\r\nSmith's credibility.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 10\r\n\r\nIn The Matter of Golden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourtroom in the presence of a judge, it is nonetheless a judicial setting.\r\nBecause there is no presiding authority, it is even more incumbent upon\r\nattorneys to conduct themselves in a professional and civil manner during a\r\ndeposition.\r\nSANCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ultimate authority to discipline attorneys and the manner of\r\ndiscipline rests with this Court. In re Dobson, III, 310 S.C. 422, 427 S.E.2d\r\n166 (1993). Analysis of the instant case reveals conduct much more egregious\r\nthan a previous matter wherein we imposed a public reprimand for similar\r\nbehavior. In re Goude, 296 S.C. 510, 374 S.E.2d 496 (1988) concerned a\r\nyoung attorney's misconduct at a sentencing hearing and outside a courtroom,\r\nwhere he made insulting remarks towards a child victim in a criminal\r\nmatter. We publicly reprimanded the attorney, finding his conduct violated\r\nDR 7-106(C)(6), which prohibits a lawyer from engaging in undignified or\r\ndiscourteous conduct degrading to a tribunal, and DR 1-102(A)(5) and (6),\r\nwhich prohibit conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and which\r\nadversely reflects on fitness to practice law.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney's actions in the present case are much more reprehensible\r\nthan that which we sanctioned in Goude. Here, we do not have a single\r\nincident, but two separate matters involving different parties and different\r\ndepositions. Here,  we do not have a momentary loss of cool, but rather, a\r\nrepeated pattern of misconduct over the course of an entire deposition. Here,\r\nwe do not have a few negative remarks, but rather, comment after comment\r\n-- seventeen of which are set forth above in connection with the Smith\r\ndeposition and two of which are delineated as to the Jones deposition --\r\nintending to intimidate and harass. Here we do not have an inexperienced\r\nattorney, but rather an attorney who has been practicing for over four\r\ndecades.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Panel, which had an opportunity to hear first-hand the testimony\r\nof the witnesses, summed up Attorney's actions in the following way:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Attorney's] conduct ... exemplifies the worst stereotype of an\r\n\r\n  arrogant, rude, and overbearing attorney. It goes far beyond\r\n  tactical aggressiveness to a level of gratuitous insult,\r\n  intimidation, and degradation of the witness. It is behavior that\r\n  brings the legal profession into disrepute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 11\r\n\r\nIn The Matter of Golden\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney urges us to impose no sanction in this matter. Alternatively,\r\nAttorney argues that any sanction be mitigated by his experience and\r\nstanding in the profession, his health problems for the past several years,\r\nand his lack of disciplinary history until recently. We approach attorney\r\ndiscipline matters with a heavy heart, especially in a case such as this one.\r\nAttorney has been a prominent and productive member of this state's bar for\r\nover four decades. He has been a leader nationally in the establishment of\r\nstandards for the practice of domestic and family law. He has encouraged\r\nand mentored several generations of highly skilled and respected family law\r\npractitioners, including his two lead counsel in this matter who have so\r\neloquently presented his case. We do take all of these factors into account.\r\nNevertheless, we cannot utilize a different set of sanctions for misconduct\r\ncommitted by a lawyer of high standing and long experience, than that\r\nutilized when similar misconduct is found in a young and inexperienced\r\npractitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find that a public reprimand should be imposed for Attorney's\r\nviolations of Rules 4.4 and 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\nSCACR, and section 5 of the Rule of Disciplinary Procedure, former Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.

(\"Law Firm\").\r\nWe granted a writ of certiorari to review the question of whether the express\r\nfee contract was contingent on the successful recovery of a tax refund in\r\nfederal court. We now reverse.\r\n  &nbsp;Factual/Procedural Background\r\n&nbsp;Frank P. Jones, Jr. died in 1979. Elliott, Davis &amp; Company (\"Account-\r\ning Firm\") represented the Jones estate in filing estate tax returns with\r\nfederal and state authorities. Accounting Firm claimed a marital deduction\r\nfor the estate because a woman named Eleanor Stickles lived with Jones.\r\nThis deduction was disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and\r\nthe S.C. State Tax Commission. The estate paid the taxes due.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nThe estate then petitioned a probate court to determine the marital\r\nstatus of Stickles. The court found a valid common law marriage between\r\nJones and Stickles. After this determination, Accounting Firm prepared, on\r\nthe basis of a marital deduction, a claim for a refund from both the IRS and\r\nthe S.C. Tax Commission. The claims were denied. The state refund was\r\ndenied because it was not filed within three years of the due date of the\r\nreturn.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nAccounting Firm then contacted Law Firm with which it had a\r\nlongstanding professional relationship. Correspondence between the two\r\nfirms indicates that Law Firm was handling two different matters for\r\nAccounting Firm: (1) initially representing Accounting Firm against a\r\npotential professional liability suit in relation to the Jones estate; and (2)\r\nseeking a refund for the estate. Law Firm did pursue these matters, by\r\nwriting letters to Accounting Firm's carrier reporting the potential\r\nprofessional liability claim, and seeking a refund from the S.C. Tax\r\nCommission and the IRS. On October 20, 1987, Law Firm argued the refund\r\nmatter before the S.C. Tax Commission. On December 22, 1987, the\r\nCommission ordered a $30,695 refund.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nThe record contains copies of bills sent by Law Firm to Accounting\r\nFirm detailing fees owed. The final bill is dated August 9, 1988 and reflects\r\nover $14,500 in fees. As of August, no part of Law Firm's bill for services\r\nregarding the processing of the refund had been paid. On August 23, 1988,\r\nLaw Firm wrote to the administrator of the estate, proposing a contract to\r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 14\r\n\r\nTHE ESTATE OF JONES \r\n&nbsp;\r\nproceed with litigation in federal court. The letter provides, in part:\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n\r\n  We are willing to go forward with preparing the case and\r\n  handling it in United States District Court on a, contingent fee\r\n  basis. We think that a contingent fee of one-third of the total\r\n  amount recovered (including both principal and interest) would\r\n  be reasonable. In setting this contingent fee, we will agree for it\r\n  to include the total amount of our charges for all legal services\r\n  rendered to this date. We will file the suit and pursue it through\r\n  the Fourth Circuit (if the District Court opinion is appealed) for\r\n  one-third of the total amount recovered (taxes plus interest) from\r\n  the IRS and SCTC. Of course, the Estate would reimburse us for\r\n  all costs and expenses incurred in the representation (including\r\n  those already paid or incurred, i.e. $310.38).\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;The administrator did not respond, so on September 27, 1988, Law\r\nFirm again wrote him: \"After having done considerable work in behalf of\r\nyour brother's estate (the Estate) with no compensation, we cannot and will\r\nnot do any further work without a contract for specific compensation signed\r\nby you as Administrator of the Estate.\" An attorney for the estate contacted\r\nLaw Finn a few days later to discuss the federal action. Law Firm wrote a\r\nletter to the administrator on October 11, 1988, confirming the initiation of\r\nan action in federal court: \"As you are well aware and in accord with your\r\ndirection, [attorney for the estate] telephoned me on yesterday, . . . and\r\nadvised your request that we proceed with filing suit in United States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of South Carolina by you as Administrator of\r\nthe Estate of Frank P. Jones, Jr. against the United States of America.\"\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nLaw Firm initiated the action in federal court against the IRS. The\r\naction was not successful. ln communicating with the administrator about\r\nthe adverse results, Law Firm stated the chances of success on appeal would\r\nbe \"nil.\" It further advised the administrator of the time for appeal. The\r\nadministrator did not respond, and there was no appeal of the matter to the\r\nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nEventually, Law Firm elected to file a claim against the estate for\r\nattorneys' fees in connection with the procurement of the state tax refund.\r\nIt sought one-third of the $30,650 state tax refund. The estate denied it was\r\nliable for any attorneys' fees. Law Firm presented four alternate theories to\r\nthe probate court to justify its claim to attorneys' fees: (1) an express\r\ncontract was created through the correspondence to the administrator (August\r\n23, 1988; September 27, 1988) and the call of the attorney for the estate to\r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 15\r\n\r\nTHE ESTATE OF JONES \r\n&nbsp;\r\nLaw Firm; (2) an implied contract was created by notice to the estate through\r\nLaw Firm's correspondence which evidenced its efforts to secure a refund, and\r\nthe failure of the estate to object to such actions: (3) Law Firm acted as\r\nauthorized agent of Accounting Firm, which had began given a power of\r\nattorney by the estate; and (4) Law Firm was owed fees under the equitable\r\ndoctrine of quantum meruit.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nThe probate court disallowed the claim. First, it found that the express\r\ncontract included the contingency of success in federal district court. Law\r\nFirm was not successful in that action; therefore, it could not seek to reform\r\nthe contract.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nSecond, the probate court found that Law Firm should not be allowed\r\nto recover on an implied contract basis. Nearly all of Law Firm's\r\ncorrespondence about this matter was directed to Accounting Firm, not to the\r\nestate. Moreover, there was a potential conflict between the interests of the\r\nestate and those of Accounting Firm. The court noted that a lawyer may\r\nrepresent clients with adverse interests only with the consent of each client\r\nafter full disclosure of the possible effects of such representation. See In re \r\nAnonymous Member of the S.C. Bar, 315 S.C. 141, 432 S.E.2d 467 (1993).\r\nThis conflict was not disclosed to the estate.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nThird, the probate court considered Law Firm's power of attorney\r\narguments The estate had given a power of attorney to Accounting Firm to\r\nact on its behalf. Accounting Firm in turn had given Law Firm a power of\r\nattorney to act on its behalf. After analyzing the relevant documents, the\r\nprobate court concluded that the power of attorney given to Accounting Firm\r\ndid not authorize it to hire anyone else; nor was the estate aware that its\r\npower of attorney was being used to hire Law Firm.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nFinally, the probate court found that the elements of quantum meruit\r\nhad not been satisfied: The services were not performed under such\r\ncircumstances as would have reasonably notified the estate that Law Firm\r\nexpected to be paid for its services by the estate, as opposed to Accounting\r\nFirm. Accordingly, the court disallowed Law Firm's claim for attorneys' fees.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nLaw Firm appealed to the circuit court, which then reversed the\r\nholding of the probate court. The circuit court's order addressed only one\r\nissue, namely, quantum meruit. The court did not consider Law Firm's other\r\ntheories for seeking fees. The estate appealed, and in an unpublished\r\nopinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in result. In re Estate of Frank \r\nPreston Jones, Jr., Op. No. 96-UP-330 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 29, 1996).\r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 16\r\n\r\nTHE ESTATE OF JONES \r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIt found that there was not a basis for awarding fees under quantum meruit;\r\nhowever, it held that the parties had entered into an express contract, the\r\nterms of which were set out in the August 23, 1988 letter to the\r\nadministrator. This Court granted the estate's petition for a writ of certiorari\r\nto review a single question:\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in failing to find the express\r\n  contract was contingent upon the successful recovery of a tax\r\n  refund in federal court?\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n&nbsp;The estate argues that the contract between Law Firm and the estate\r\nwas contingent on the recovery of a tax refund in federal court. We agree.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nThe contractual provision between the parties must be read within the\r\nbroader context of Law Firm's August 23, 1988 letter to the estate. The\r\nletter, authored by Law Firm's senior partner Wesley Walker, states that Mac\r\nWalters, an attorney with Law Firm, has done considerable work on and was\r\ninstrumental in obtaining the refund from the S.C. Tax Commission. It\r\nfurther states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  You are aware that Mac Walters submitted a statement for\r\n  services to the interested parties but no one appears to have any\r\n  interest in making payment. I will not belabor in this letter all\r\n  the work that has been done but I must say that -- like any\r\n  other law firm or individual lawyer practitioner would be -- we\r\n  are not very happy about not being compensated for our services.\r\n  In lieu of recounting cur labors and services, I propose in this\r\n  letter a plan for further procedure which will please everyone if\r\n  we are successful in a refund action against the United States\r\n  (IRS) in Federal District Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In view of the extensive work previously done by Mac Walters in\r\n  this case, we feel that we are in a position. to recommend\r\n  proceeding with a ref',and action in the United States District\r\n  Court . . . .We believe that we are well qualified to go forward\r\n  with this matter and with an appropriate compensation\r\n  agreement, we are prepared to proceed forthwith.\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n  Naturally, we will not undertake the litigation without an \r\n  appropriate compensation agreement. Such an agreement will\r\n\r\n&nbsp;p. 17\r\n\r\nTHE ESTATE OF JONES \r\n\r\n  properly take into consideration the work already done which\r\n  resulted in the refund by the SCTC. We are willing to go\r\n  forward with preparing the case and handling it in United States\r\n  District Court on a contingent fee basis. We think that a\r\n  contingent fee of one-third of the total amount recovered\r\n  (including both principal and interest) would be reasonable.\r\n  setting this contingent fee, we will agree for it to include the\r\n  total amount of our charges for all legal services rendered to this \r\n  date. We will file the suit and pursue it through the Fourth\r\n  Circuit (if the District Court opinion is appealed) for one-third of\r\n  the total amount recovered (taxes plus interest) from the IRS and\r\n  SCTC. Of course, the Estate would reimburse us for all costs\r\n  and expenses incurred in the representation (including those\r\n  already paid or incurred, i.e. $310.38).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A contingent fee is one which is made to depend upon the success or\r\nfailure in the effort to enforce a supposed right, whether doubtful or not.\"\r\nAdair v. First Nat. Bank, 139 S.C. 1, 5, 137 S.E. 192, 193 (1927); see also \r\nCity of Burlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 560-61, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 2640, 120\r\nL. Ed. 2d 449, 455 (1992)(\"Fees for legal services in litigation may be either\r\n'certain' or 'contingent' for some hybrid of the two). A fee is certain if it is\r\npayable without regard to the outcome of the suit; it is contingent if the\r\nobligation to pay depends on a particular result's being obtained.\"); Alexander \r\nv. Inman, 903 S.W.2d 6861 696 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995)(\"Most jurisdictions\r\nwould agree that a contingent fee arrangement is an agreement for legal\r\nservices under which the amount or payment of the fee depends, in whole or\r\nin part, on the outcome of the proceedings for which the services were\r\nrendered.\"); Martin v. Buckman, 883 P.2d 185, 192 (Okla. Ct. App. 1994)(\"In\r\nsimple terms, a contingent fee contract is one in which a client engages an\r\nattorney to represent her in the recovery of, say, a certain sum of money she\r\nclaims is owed to her, and the attorney agrees to accept for his services a\r\ncertain percentage of what he recovers either by settlement or by judgment.\");\r\nBlack's Law Dictionary 614 (6th ed. 1990)(defining \"contingent fees\" as\r\n\"[a]rrangement between attorney and client whereby attorney agrees to\r\nrepresent client with compensation to be a percentage of the amount\r\nrecovered . . . .\").\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nIf we assume, in the present case, that the parties entered into a\r\ncontract1 through the August 23, 1988 letter, then the contractual language\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n\r\n1The question before this Court assumes a valid contract between the\r\nparties. Here, we have not been directly presented with the issue of whether\r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 18\r\n\r\nTHE ESTATE OF JONES \r\n&nbsp;\r\nclearly evidences a contingent fee agreement. As the above authorities\r\nexplain, a contingent fee agreement necessarily requires that a successful\r\nresult be achieved before the fee is paid. In this case, the contract and other\r\nevidence in the record reveal that the contingency was success in procuring\r\na refund in the federal litigation and that if that action was not successful,\r\nthen there would be no fee paid. For example, the letter itself declares:\r\n\"... I propose in this letter a plan for further procedure which will please\r\neveryone if we are successful in a refund action against the United States\r\n(IRS) in Federal District Court.\" (emphasis added). Moreover, an inter-office\r\nmemo between members of Law Firm states: \"In the final analysis, we will\r\nnot file suit against Bill Jones as Administrator even though the failure to\r\npursue an appeal will jeopardize our chances of collecting the fee on the\r\nSouth Carolina refund.\"\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nLaw Firm argues that the prosecution of the claim was itself the\r\nfulfillment of the contingency; the one-third fee had already been earned, and\r\nit should have been paid by the estate when Law Firm proceeded with the\r\nfederal action. This is an untenable position because under this\r\ninterpretation, there would, in fact, be no contingency; the prosecution of the\r\naction, regardless of the results, would trigger the contingency. If the\r\noutcome of the suit is irrelevant to the fee to be extracted, then the\r\nagreement would not be contingent, but would be certain. Because the\r\ncontractual language here set forth a contingency -- one which ultimately was\r\nnot fulfilled -- Law Firm is entitled to no fee under the contract.\r\n  &nbsp;CONCLUSION\r\n&nbsp;Based on the foregoing, we REVERSE the holding of the Court of\r\nAppeals inasmuch as the contingency of the contingent fee agreement was not\r\nsatisfied. Accordingly, Law Firm is not entitled to the award of attorneys'\r\nfees.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n  &nbsp;\r\nWALLER and BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Associate Justices\r\nGeorge T. Gregory Jr., and L. Casey Manning, concur.\r\n  &nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\na contract in fact existed. Accordingly, our decision should not be read to\r\nsanction the legal arrangement between Law Firm and the estate in the\r\npresent case. The fact that an attorney's services have inured to the benefit\r\nof others does not necessarily give rise to a contractual relationship, absent\r\na clear agreement between the parties.

We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 20\r\n\r\nJACKSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for twenty-five years. His conviction and sentence were\r\naffirmed on direct appeal. State v. Jackson, 315 S.C. 219, 433 S.E.2d 19\r\n(Ct. App. 1993). Respondent filed a PCR application alleging\r\nineffectiveness of his trial counsel. After an evidentiary hearing, the PCR\r\njudge found respondent's trial counsel was ineffective in several respects,\r\nincluding failing to investigate the backgrounds of the eyewitnesses and\r\nthe victims; failing to call the co-defendants as witnesses; failing to\r\npresent a defense; failing to adequately prepare the case; and operating\r\nunder a conflict of interest. Respondent was granted a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR judge err in finding respondent's trial counsel\r\n  was ineffective?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate\r\nassistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all\r\nsignificant decisions in the case. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\r\n104 S.Ct. 2025, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386\r\nS.E.2d 624 (1989). In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the\r\napplicant must show counsel's performance was deficient and the deficient\r\nperformance prejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, supra;\r\nThrift v. State, 302 S.C. 535, 397 S.E.2d 523 (1990). To show prejudice,\r\nthe applicant must show, but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable\r\nprobability the result of the trial would have been different. Johnson v.\r\nState, __S.C.__, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997). A reasonable probability is a\r\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.\r\nStrickland v. Washington, supra. This Court will sustain the PCR judge's\r\nfactual findings and conclusions regarding ineffective assistance of counsel\r\nif there is any probative evidence to support those findings. Skeen v.\r\nState, __ S.C.__ , 481 S.E.2d 129 (1997). However, if there is no\r\nprobative evidence to support the PCR judge's findings, the findings will\r\nnot be upheld. Satterwhite v. State, __ S.C. __, 481 S.E.2d 709 (1997);\r\nHolland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\n\r\n\r\np. 21\r\n\r\nJACKSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFailing to Investigate Backgrounds of Victims and Witnesses\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State contends the PCR judge erred in finding counsel's\r\nfailure to investigate the backgrounds of the victims and witnesses to\r\ndetermine if they had criminal records or were involved in illegal activities\r\nprejudiced respondent's defense. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nCounsel admitted at the PCR hearing he did not check the\r\ncriminal records of the victims or eyewitnesses to the robbery prior to the\r\ntrial. Counsel further admitted it was an error not to investigate the\r\nvictims and eyewitnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe robbery occurred after 11:00 p.m. in a high crime district.\r\nGiven the time and location of the robbery, a reasonable attorney would\r\nhave concluded a background investigation of the victims and witnesses\r\nwas necessary. An investigation to determine the credibility of the victims\r\nand witnesses was especially important in light of respondent's claim that\r\nhe was merely retrieving property which had been stolen from him by the\r\nvictims. Therefore, there is probative evidence to support the PCR judge's\r\nfinding that counsel's performance was deficient in this matter. Skeen v.\r\nState, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no probative evidence to support the finding\r\nof prejudice. While the PCR judge was correct in finding the credibility of\r\nthe eyewitnesses and victims \"would have been critical,\" no probative\r\nevidence was presented at the PCR hearing to show the eyewitnesses and\r\nvictims were not credible. The only \"evidence\" that either the victims or\r\neyewitnesses had criminal records were statements and questions by\r\nrespondent's PCR counsel that one of the victims was incarcerated in\r\nanother state at the time of respondent's trial and respondent's testimony\r\nthat he knew this victim was in jail.1 Respondent failed to substantiate\r\nthis allegation with any probative evidence. See Glover v. State, 318 S.C.\r\n496, 458 S.E.2d 538 (1995) (applicant's allegations, alone, will not support\r\na finding of prejudice when applicant claims counsel was ineffective for\r\nfailing to investigate witnesses; instead, applicant must show the results of\r\nan investigation would have resulted in a different outcome at trial).\r\nMere speculation and conjecture on the part of respondent is insufficient.\r\nId.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The State moved to strike the allegation that the victim was\r\n\r\nincarcerated unless there was evidence to support the allegation. The\r\nPCR judge denied that motion.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 22\r\n\r\nJACKSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven assuming one of the eyewitnesses or victims had a\r\ncriminal record, no evidence was presented to show the crime was one of\r\nmoral turpitude which could be used for impeachment purposes. State v.\r\nMajor, 301 S.C. 181, 391 S.E.2d 235 (1990). Moreover, because at the trial\r\nthe victims did not testify2 and the State never attempted to establish the\r\ncredibility of the victims, they could not be impeached with any prior\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, no evidence supports the PCR judge's finding that\r\nrespondent was prejudiced by counsel's failure to check the records of\r\nthese individuals. Satterwhite v. State, supra; High v. State, 300 S.C. 88,\r\n386 S.E.2d 463 (1989) (PCR judge's findings will not be upheld if there is\r\nno probative evidence to support them).\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure to Interview and Call Co-Defendants as Witnesses\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State claims the PCR judge erred in finding trial counsel\r\nineffective for failing to interview respondent's co-defendants and for\r\nfailing to call them as witnesses at respondent's trial because respondent\r\nfailed to prove prejudice. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent testified he asked counsel to call one of his co-\r\ndefendants, Lorenzo Stanford (Stanford), as a witness at trial, but counsel\r\ndid not do so. At the PCR hearing, Stanford's statement he made to the\r\npolice following the robbery was introduced to support respondent's claim\r\nof ineffectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCounsel testified Stanford and respondent's other co-defendant,\r\nSam Bennerman (Bennerman), were not called as witnesses because\r\nStanford's statement, which supported respondent's version of the incident,\r\nwas presented through the testimony of a police officer. According to\r\ncounsel, he contacted counsel for the co-defendants and was told any\r\ntestimony given by them would be the same as their statements given to\r\nthe police. Counsel also reviewed the co-defendant's statements. Counsel\r\nmade the decision not to call Stanford and Bennerman to testify because\r\nhe \"didn't want to run the risk of calling them and having something go\r\nwrong.\" Further, counsel thought the testimony of the police officer\r\nadmitting Stanford's statement supported respondent's version of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The victims did not testify at the trial. Instead, two police officers\r\n\r\nwho witnessed the robbery and two cousins of one of the victims who\r\nwitnessed the crime testified at trial.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 23\r\n\r\nJACKSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincident and lent more credibility to respondent's defense than calling\r\nStanford to testify.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough respondent did introduce evidence at the PCR\r\nhearing of what Stanford's testimony would have been had he testified at\r\ntrial, this same information was presented through the testimony of the\r\npolice officer who took the statement. Thus, the jury was aware\r\nrespondent's defense was corroborated. Respondent failed to show\r\nStanford's testimony could have provided additional information to what\r\nwas admitted through the police officer's testimony to assist in\r\nrespondent's defense. Compare with Thomas v. State, 308 S.C. 123, 417\r\nS.E.2d 531 (1992) (petitioner showed uncalled witness' testimony would\r\nhave made a difference in the trial because it would have cast doubt on\r\nthe sole witness' identification of the petitioner). Therefore, respondent\r\nfailed to present any evidence of prejudice in failing to call Stanford as a\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent also produced no evidence of how counsel's failure\r\nto interview Stanford or Bennerman prejudiced his defense. See Glover v.\r\nState, 318 S.C. 496, 458 S.E.2d 538 (1995) (prejudice from trial counsel's\r\nfailure to interview or call witnesses could not be shown where the PCR\r\napplicant failed to introduce evidence of what the uncalled witnesses'\r\ntestimony would have been and an applicant's mere speculation what a\r\nwitness' testimony would have been cannot satisfy the applicant's burden\r\nof showing prejudice).3 It is pure speculation to conclude the outcome of\r\nrespondent's trial would have been different if counsel had interviewed\r\nand/or called Stanford and Bennerman as witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, the decision not to call Stanford as a witness was\r\ntrial strategy. Counsel claimed he thought the testimony concerning the\r\ncorroboration of respondent's statement would be more credible if\r\npresented through the testimony of the police officer instead of Stanford.\r\nThis is a valid reason for deciding not to call Stanford since Stanford's\r\ncredibility would have been at issue if he testified. Thus, counsel was not\r\nineffective for employing this strategy. Stokes v. State, 308 S.C. 546, 419\r\nS.E.2d 778 (1992) (where counsel articulates a valid reason for employing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Citing Glover, the State claims respondent must produce the\r\n\r\nwitness in order to show prejudice. The State is misreading the law.\r\nUnder our case law, the applicant must produce the witness at the PCR\r\nhearing or otherwise introduce the witness' testimony in a manner\r\nconsistent with the rules of evidence. Glover v. State, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 24\r\n\r\nJACKSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective assistance\r\nof counsel).\r\nFailure to Present a Defense \r\n\r\n\r\nThe State argues the PCR judge erred in finding trial counsel\r\nineffective in \"failing to present any defense.\" We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, respondent's statement which set forth his defense\r\nthat he was merely reclaiming the property that had been taken from him\r\nwas admitted. Counsel cross-examined the police officer as to respondent's\r\nstatement and Stanford's corroborating statement. The solicitor mentioned\r\nthe defense and discredited it in his closing argument. Counsel requested\r\nand received a jury charge that a person cannot steal his own property.\r\nHowever, counsel did not offer any witnesses and respondent did not\r\ntestify.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, counsel testified he argued respondent's\r\ndefense to the jury4 and requested and received a jury charge on the\r\ndefense. Counsel admitted he did not attempt to find other witnesses to\r\nsupport respondent's allegation that the stolen property belonged to him.\r\nRespondent acknowledged counsel argued the defense in closing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the probative evidence fails to support the PCR judge's\r\nfinding on this issue. Satterwhite v. State, supra. Instead, counsel\r\npresented respondent's defense that respondent was merely reclaiming his\r\nproperty. While it is true counsel did not present any witnesses at trial, a\r\ncriminal defendant is not required to present evidence. Further,\r\nrespondent has not shown what additional evidence counsel could have\r\npresented to support this defense. Glover, supra. Accordingly,\r\nrespondent did not establish counsel was deficient or that any deficient\r\nperformance prejudiced his defense.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, it was a strategic decision not to have respondent\r\ntestify. See Stokes v. State, supra. Respondent has a conviction for\r\npossession of crack cocaine, a crime of moral turpitude, which could have\r\nbeen used to impeach him. See State v. Major, 301 S.C. 181, 391 S.E.2d\r\n235 (1990). Counsel testified at the PCR hearing he was aware of\r\nrespondent's conviction. While confusion arose over whether respondent\r\nhad a previous conviction for strong arm robbery, this matter was resolved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Counsel's closing argument was not transcribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 25\r\n\r\nJACKSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore sentencing. Further, regardless whether respondent had a prior\r\nrobbery conviction, counsel would have still advised respondent not to\r\ntestify because of his prior drug conviction. Thus, respondent has failed to\r\nshow prejudice. \r\n\r\n\r\nFailing to Adequately Prepare the Case\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State claims the PCR judge erred in finding trial counsel\r\nineffective for failing to adequately prepare respondent's case. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to its order, the lower court specifically found\r\ncounsel ineffective:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In failing to adequately and sufficiently meet with the\r\n  Applicant and permit the Applicant to fully participate in the\r\n  defense of this matter.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nRespondent testified counsel met with him briefly when he\r\nadvised him to waive his preliminary hearing, when he was first offered a\r\nplea bargain, and a week before trial when counsel again discussed a\r\nguilty plea. According to respondent, he never discussed the facts of the\r\ncase until the day before his trial when counsel again attempted to \r\nconvince respondent to plead guilty. Respondent agreed to plead guilty;\r\nhowever, respondent changed his mind during the plea and proceeded with\r\na jury trial. Respondent testified counsel advised him not to testify, told\r\nhim the defense would be the victims owed him drug money, and refused\r\nrespondent's request to subpoena Stanford.\r\n\r\n\r\nCounsel testified at the PCR hearing he did not recall the\r\nnumber of times he met with respondent, but it was probably three or four\r\ntimes and that he did talk with him \"several times about the case.\"\r\nCounsel stated he discussed with respondent calling Bennerman, but\r\ndecided to leave that decision until trial. According to counsel, respondent\r\nnever asked him to call Stanford as a witness. Counsel testified he had\r\nfiled a discovery request and had reviewed the materials in the solicitor's\r\nfile, including Stanford's statement.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, the PCR judge erred in finding counsel\r\nineffective in preparing respondent's case. Respondent failed to present\r\nany evidence of what counsel could have discovered or what other defenses\r\nrespondent would have requested counsel pursue had counsel more fully\r\nprepared for the trial. Thus, respondent has failed to show his counsel's\r\n\r\n\r\np. 26\r\n\r\nJACKSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlack of preparation prejudiced him, and no probative evidence supports the\r\nPCR judge's findings on this issue. Satterwhite v. State, supra. Instead,\r\nthe PCR judge's order is based on respondent's speculation that counsel\r\ncould have done a better job representing respondent if he spent more\r\ntime with him. Glover, supra (speculation and conjecture will not support\r\na finding of ineffective assistance of counsel).\r\n\r\n\r\nConflict of Interest\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State contends the PCR judge erred in finding trial\r\ncounsel ineffective due to a conflict of interest. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nCounsel for respondent was employed by the Richland County\r\nPublic Defender's Office, as were the attorneys for respondent's co-\r\ndefendants. Therefore, respondent argued counsel was operating under a\r\nconflict of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PCR judge found counsel was ineffective due to a conflict\r\nof interest. Specifically, the PCR judge found:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [i]t is ... clear that the Richland County Public Defender's\r\n  office had a conflict of interest in this matter by representing '\r\n  all three (3) co-defendants. Although there is no evidence of\r\n  overt use of confidential information in this matter as between\r\n  the co-defendants, it appears that this joint representation\r\n  could have been an explanation for the failure of Applicant's\r\n  counsel to adequately prepare the case for trial. Further, the\r\n  Applicant was never advised regarding this potential conflict by\r\n  his counsel.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\nTo establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to\r\neffective counsel due to a conflict of interest arising from multiple\r\nrepresentation, a defendant who did not object at trial must show an\r\nactual conflict of interest adversely affected his attorney's performance.\r\nCuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980);\r\nDuncan v. State, 281 S.C. 435, 315 S.E.2d 809 (1984). An actual conflict\r\nof interest occurs where an attorney owes a duty to a party whose\r\ninterests are adverse to the defendant's. Duncan v. State, supra. The\r\nmere possibility of a conflict of interest is insufficient to impugn a criminal\r\nconviction. Cuyler v. Sullivan, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 27\r\n\r\nJACKSON v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, respondent did not show any actual conflict of\r\ninterest resulted from counsel's representation of him while others in\r\ncounsel's office represented respondent's co-defendants. All respondent\r\nshowed and the PCR judge found was a potential conflict of interest\r\nbecause counsel worked in the same office with the attorneys who\r\nrepresented the co-defendants. Counsel testified no conflict existed, and\r\nrespondent could not point to an actual conflict. Thus, this potential\r\nconflict never ripened into an actual conflict. Nothing in the record\r\nsuggests the potential conflict caused counsel to treat respondent's case in\r\nsuch a manner as to obtain more favorable consideration for respondent's\r\nco-defendants. Further, the fact that counsel never advised respondent of\r\nthe potential conflict of interest does not affect the constitutionality of the\r\nconviction. See Langford v. State, 310 S.C. 357, 360, 426 S.E.2d 793, 794\r\n(1993) (\"Rules of Professional Conduct have no bearing on the\r\nconstitutionality of a criminal conviction\"). Therefore, the PCR judge erred\r\nin finding a conflict of interest existed.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 28\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24750","title":"Richard Carter v.

After extensive plea\r\nnegotiations, respondent waived presentment of the indictments to the\r\ngrand jury and pled guilty to manufacturing methamphetamine and money\r\nlaundering. He was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-five years and\r\ntwenty years, respectively, with the sentences to run concurrently. No\r\ndirect appeal was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent filed a PCR application alleging ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel and his guilty plea was not voluntarily and\r\nknowingly entered. After an evidentiary hearing, the PCR judge found\r\nrespondent's guilty plea counsel ineffective for failing to properly advise\r\nrespondent of the maximum penalty respondent could receive on the\r\nindictment for manufacturing methamphetamine. Further, the PCR judge\r\nfound there was confusion on the part of the guilty plea judge and the\r\nsolicitor during the guilty plea proceeding over the maximum penalty for\r\nmanufacturing methamphetamine. Thus, respondent's guilty plea was not\r\nvoluntarily and knowingly entered. The PCR judge ordered the pleas\r\nvacated.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR judge err in finding respondent's guilty pleas\r\n  were not voluntarily and knowingly entered?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State contends the PCR judge erred in finding\r\nrespondent's guilty pleas were involuntary due to counsel's advice that the\r\nmaximum penalty on the manufacturing charge was a thirty year sentence\r\nfor a second offense.1 We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe test for determining the validity of a guilty plea based\r\nupon alleged ineffective assistance of counsel is whether counsel's advice\r\nwas within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal\r\ncases and whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\r\nerrors, the defendant would not have pled guilty. Hill v. Lockhart, 474\r\nU.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985); Ray v. State, 303 S.C. 374,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Respondent concedes this was his second offense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 30\r\n\r\nCARTER v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n401 S.E.2d 151 (1991); Hinson v. State, 297 S.C. 456, 377 S.E.2d 338\r\n(1989). \"A defendant who pleads guilty upon the advice of counsel may\r\nonly attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea by\r\nshowing the advice he received from counsel was not within the range of\r\ncompetence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\" Richardson v. State,\r\n310 S.C. 360, 363, 426 S.E.2d 795, 797 (1993).\r\n\r\n\r\nCrank is methamphetamine which is a Schedule II drug.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(b)(2) (Supp. 1996) provides a\r\npenalty of ten years imprisonment or a $10,000 fine for a second offense of\r\nmanufacturing a Schedule II drug. Schedule II includes\r\nmethamphetamine. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-210(d) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1996).\r\n\"'Crank' means amphetamine or methamphetamine . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§Â§ 44-53-110 (Supp. 1996). South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375, as it\r\nread at the time of petitioner's offense, provided that a person who\r\nviolates Â§ 44-53-370 by manufacturing \"crank\" (methamphetamine) shall be\r\nsentenced to imprisonment for no less than twenty-five years and no more\r\nthan thirty years and fined no less than $50,000, for a second offense.2\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent waived presentment of the indictments to the\r\ngrand jury. The indictment is captioned \"Manufacturing\r\nMethamphetamine 44-53-370\" on both its back and its face. The body of\r\nthe indictment states respondent did \"unlawfully manufacture\r\nmethamphetamine without first obtaining a license to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, respondent testified he agreed to enter a\r\nplea of guilty to manufacturing in exchange for a twenty-five year sentence\r\nbased on counsel's advice that he was exposed to thirty years.\r\nAdditionally, respondent agreed to plead guilty to money laundering in\r\nexchange for a twenty year term of imprisonment which would run\r\nconcurrently with the twenty-five year sentence. According to respondent,\r\nhe would not have taken the plea agreement on either charge had he\r\nknown the manufacturing charge only carried a potential ten year\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCounsel testified that plea negotiations were based on\r\nrespondent being sentenced under Â§ 44-53-375 which carried a more severe\r\npenalty than the general statute, Â§ 44-53-370. Therefore, counsel's advice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Currently, for a second offense, the sentence requires imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor no more than twenty-five years. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375 (Supp.\r\n1996).\r\n\r\n\r\np. 31\r\n\r\nCARTER v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto respondent concerning his maximum penalty exposure focused on the\r\npenalties outlined in Â§ 44-53-375.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PCR judge found respondent's guilty pleas were\r\ninvoluntary due to counsel's advice that the maximum penalty on the\r\nmanufacturing methamphetamine charge was a thirty year sentence for a\r\nsecond offense. According to the PCR judge, because respondent was\r\nindicted under Â§ 44-52-370, the maximum sentence exposure for a second\r\noffense was ten years. The PCR judge found counsel's misadvice as to\r\nrespondent's maximum sentence exposure affected both the plea to the\r\nmanufacturing charge and the plea to the money laundering charge\r\nbecause respondent would not have accepted the negotiated sentences had\r\nhe been advised the maximum penalty for manufacturing\r\nmethamphetamine was ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, counsel's advice was correct; therefore, counsel's\r\nperformance was not deficient and he was not ineffective. Once a\r\ndefendant is convicted under Â§ 44-53-370, the sentencing guidelines for this\r\nconviction involving the Schedule II drug methamphetamine (crank) is set\r\nforth in Â§ 44-53-375. Counsel correctly recognized that a conviction under\r\nÂ§ 44-53-370 for manufacturing crank would require respondent to be\r\nsentenced under the stricter penalties of Â§ 44-53-375. Thus, counsel\r\nproperly advised respondent the maximum penalty he could receive would\r\nbe thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PCR judge also found because the guilty plea judge and\r\nthe solicitor expressed confusion over the appropriate sentencing range\r\nduring the guilty plea, respondent's guilty pleas were not voluntarily and\r\nknowingly entered. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find a guilty plea is voluntarily and knowingly entered, the\r\nrecord must establish the defendant had a full understanding of the\r\nconsequences of his plea and the charges against him. Boykin v. Alabama,\r\n395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); Dover v. State, 304\r\nS.C. 433, 405 S.E.2d 391 (1991). To ensure the defendant understands,\r\nthe trial judge should question the defendant about the facts surrounding\r\nthe crime and the punishment which could be imposed. Dover v. State,\r\nsuj2ra. However, the trial judge does not have to direct the defendant's\r\nattention to every consequence of his plea provided the record reveals\r\naffi=ative awareness of the consequences of a guilty plea. LoPiano v.\r\nState, 270 S.C. 563, 243 S.E.2d 448 (1978).\r\n\r\n\r\np. 32\r\n\r\nCARTER v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude respondent's guilty pleas were voluntarily and\r\nknowingly entered. Although there was some confusion over whether the\r\nfine was mandatory and over the sentencing range the guilty plea judge\r\ncorrectly informed respondent his maximum exposure for a conviction for\r\nmanufacturing methamphetamine was thirty years. The record reveals\r\nrespondent understood the consequences of his pleas and the charges\r\nagainst him. Further, respondent's counsel had correctly informed\r\nrespondent of the sentencing possibilities; therefore, respondent cannot\r\ncomplain that his pleas were not voluntarily and knowingly entered.\r\nRichardson v. State, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue in this case is whether the guilty plea\r\njudge had subject matter jurisdiction to sentence respondent under Â§ 44-\r\n53-375 since respondent only waived presentment to the grand jury of an\r\nindictment citing Â§ 44-53-370.\r\n\r\n\r\nIssues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at\r\nany time. Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995). Except\r\nfor certain minor offenses, the circuit court does not have subject matter\r\njurisdiction to hear a guilty plea unless (1) there has been an indictment\r\nwhich sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has been a waiver of\r\nindictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser included charge of the crime\r\ncharged in the indictment. Browning v. State, supra; Murdock v. State,\r\n308 S.C. 143, 417 S.E.2d 543 (1992). An indictment is sufficient if the\r\noffense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the\r\ncourt to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know\r\nwhat he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal\r\nor conviction thereon. Browning v. State, supra. An indictment is\r\nordinarily sufficient if it is in the language of the statute. State v. Jacobs,\r\n238 S.C. 234, 119 S.E.2d 735 (1961). Further, the plain language of an\r\nindictment is not to be ignored merely because its caption does not\r\nprecisely conform with the wording on its face. Crady v. State, 248 S.C.\r\n522, 151 S.E.2d 670 (1966). The test for determining when a crime is a\r\nlesser included offense is whether the greater of the two offenses includes\r\nall the elements of the lesser offense. Murdock v. State, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the indictment sufficient. While the caption of this\r\nindictment refers to Â§ 44-53-370, the plain language of the body of the\r\nindictment clearly notifies respondent that he is charged with\r\nmanufacturing methamphetamine. Respondent's counsel informed\r\nrespondent of the potential sentence if convicted of this crime and\r\nrespondent waived presentment of this indictment.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 33\r\n\r\nCARTER v. STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 44-53-375 provides a violation of Â§ 44-53-370 that\r\ninvolves methamphetamine (crank) carries a greater sentence than the\r\nsentence provided for in Â§ 44-53-370 for other Schedule II drugs.\r\nTherefore, Â§ 44-53-375 does not define a separate crime but only an\r\nenhanced punishment.

In the agreement, respondent admits\r\nmisconduct and consents to a public reprimand. We accept the agreement\r\nand publicly reprimand respondent. \r\n  &nbsp; \r\n  &nbsp;\r\nRobert A. M. Kennedy Matter \r\n  &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Andree S. M. Kennedy (mother) retained respondent to\r\nrepresent her son, Robert A. M. Kennedy (Kennedy). Respondent charged\r\nmother $15,000 to represent Kennedy in a court martial, a military\r\nseparation hearing, and a criminal trial in Kershaw County. Kennedy\r\n  was\r\nconvicted on the Kershaw County charge, and mother paid respondent\r\n$3,000 to handle an appeal of the conviction. \r\n  &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Respondent filed the notice of appeal but later convinced\r\nmother that an attorney more experienced in criminal matters should \r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 3\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF JOHNSON \r\n&nbsp;\r\nhandle Kennedy's appeal. Mother followed respondent's advice and signed\r\nan agreement to pay another attorney $10,000 to handle the appeal.\r\nPursuant to the agreement, respondent would receive $2,500 of the fee,\r\nand the other attorney would receive $7,500. In addition, the contract\r\nprovided that respondent was to assist the other attorney in the appeal.\r\nRespondent, however, failed to materially assist with the appeal and\r\n  failed\r\nto maintain contact with appellate counsel and mother during the appeal. \r\n  &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Additionally, in his response to the complaint in this matter,\r\nrespondent alleged that he spent over 30 hours on Kennedy's appeal and\r\nprovided a detailed break-down of how these hours were spent.\r\nRespondent, however, failed to produce time sheets or other documentary\r\nproof of his hours spent on the appeal, and admitted that he merely\r\nestimated the hours provided in his response to the Board of\r\nCommissioners on Grievances and Discipline. Respondent misled the\r\nBoard to believe that he actually spent thirty hours on the appeal when\r\n  in\r\nactuality, his response to the Board was an estimate. \r\n  &nbsp; \r\n  &nbsp;\r\nGloria Coleman Matter \r\n  &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In November of 1993, Gloria Coleman (Coleman) retained\r\nrespondent to represent her in a divorce action. At the time, Coleman\r\n  was\r\nliving in South Carolina, but her husband, on active military duty,\r\n  was\r\nstationed at Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, North Carolina. In February\r\n  of\r\n1994, Coleman informed respondent that her husband would be retiring\r\nfrom the military in April 1994, and that she wanted to begin divorce\r\nproceedings prior to his retirement date to preserve any interest she\r\n  might\r\nhave in his retirement funds. \r\n  &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Respondent failed to initiate action in Coleman's case until\r\nSeptember of 1994, ten months after he was retained. Respondent filed\r\npleadings which were dismissed without Coleman's knowledge. Later,\r\nwithout Coleman's knowledge or consent, respondent turned her file over\r\nto a North Carolina attorney to handle the divorce. In this matter,\r\nrespondent accepted a case he was not capable of handling, and did not\r\nprovide proper attention to Coleman's legal matter. He then improperly\r\nterminated his representation of Coleman without her knowledge or\r\nconsent. \r\n  &nbsp;\r\nShirley Hales Williams and Sheila Harrell Matters \r\n  &nbsp; \r\n  &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Shirley Hales Williams and Sheila Harrell each have one child\r\nfathered by respondent. The Lexington County Family Court entered two\r\nseparate child support orders requiring respondent to make monthly child\r\nsupport payments to Williams and Harrell. At the time formal charges\r\nwere filed in these matters, respondent was in arrears on both child \r\n  &nbsp;\r\np. 4\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF JOHNSON \r\n&nbsp;\r\nsupport obligations. Respondent has admitted attorney misconduct by\r\nfailing to obey the two Family Court Child Support Orders. \r\n  &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  By his own admission, respondent has engaged in conduct in\r\nviolation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nRespondent has neglected legal matters entrusted to him and has engaged\r\nin conduct which brings the legal profession into disrepute. His conduct\r\nhas been prejudicial to the administration of justice and adversely\r\n  reflects\r\non his fitness to practice law. Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d), 8.4(d),\r\n  and\r\n8.4(e), Rule 407, SCACR. Respondent's conduct warrants a public\r\nreprimand.

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter,\r\nrespondent admits he has committed misconduct and consents to a definite\r\nsuspension for two years. We accept respondent's admissions and suspend\r\nhim from the practice of law for two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw Firm Accounts\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondent, a solo practitioner, failed to maintain the integrity\r\nof his law firm trust and operating accounts. He failed to maintain\r\naccurate and complete information about financial transactions involving\r\nhis clients. He improperly used his law office's operating account as a\r\npersonal checking account. From March to December of 1996, the office's\r\noperating account had 113 checks returned for insufficient funds, 64\r\noverdraft fees, and 107 negative balances.\r\n\r\np. 6\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF CABANISS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Raley Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondent handled a real estate closing for a client named\r\nRaley. Funds were electronically transferred to respondent's trust account\r\nin connection with the closing. Respondent wrote checks from his trust\r\naccount totaling $955 in connection with the closing during September and\r\nOctober 1996. Those checks were returned for insufficient funds.\r\nRespondent failed to pay an additional $2,752 in closing fees and other\r\nescrowed amounts. Funds to make the necessary payments were not in\r\nrespondent's trust account at the time they were due because respondent\r\nused the money for purposes unrelated to the Raley closing.  A title\r\ninsurance company covered the losses. Respondent has reimbursed the\r\ncompany for $955, but has not repaid the $2,752.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Armstrong Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lea Armstrong gave respondent $500 in August 1996 as\r\npayment for him to handle a real estate closing. Respondent failed to\r\nhandle the transaction and did not return the money until December 1996.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondent admits he has committed misconduct in these\r\nmatters. Respondent failed to maintain records of his office's operating\r\nand trust accounts. He commingled funds between his personal account,\r\noffice operating account, and trust account. Respondent used funds from\r\nhis trust account for purposes unrelated to a real estate closing for which\r\nthe funds were designated. He failed to perform a real estate closing after\r\naccepting a fee, and did not promptly return the fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conclude respondent engaged in conduct that reflects\r\nadversely upon his honesty, trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer. He\r\nengaged in conduct involving moral turpitude. He engaged in conduct\r\ntending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts and\r\nlegal profession into disrepute. By his actions, respondent violated Rules\r\n1.15 and 8.4(a), (c) and (e) of the Rules of Professional Conduct contained\r\nin Rule 407, SCACR, and Paragraph 5(D) of former Rule 413, SCACR.1 \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find that respondent's conduct warrants a definite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 This provision is now found in Rule 7(a)(5) of the Rules for\r\n\r\nLawyer Disciplinary Enforcement contained in Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\np. 7\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF CABANISS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuspension of two years from the practice of law. The suspension shall be\r\nretroactive to February 7, 1997, the date the Court placed respondent on\r\ninterim suspension from the practice of law. Within fifteen (15) days of\r\nthe date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of\r\nCourt showing he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR. In\r\naddition to all other requirements respondent must meet to be reinstated\r\nunder Rule 413, SCACR, no petition for reinstatement shall be accepted\r\nuntil respondent has filed proof he has made full restitution to all\r\ninstitutions and individuals who have lost money as a result of his\r\nfraudulent acts or mishandling of trust funds, to include restitution to the\r\nLawyers' Fund for Client Protection for any payment it may make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24753","title":"In the Matter of Eben H.

Gundling, of Pawleys Island, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PER CURIAM: This is an attorney disciplinary matter.\r\nThe Panel recommended respondent be definitely suspended for one year\r\nretroactive to April 2, 1996, the date he pled guilty and was sentenced.\r\nBy a vote of 6 to 0, the Interim Review Committee adopted the Panel's\r\nconclusions of law and recommendations but the Committee recommended\r\nrespondent be suspended retroactive to May 2, 1996, when we temporarily\r\nsuspended respondent pursuant to &#182 6 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent was arrested on May 30, 1994, for felony driving\r\nunder the influence (DUI) causing great bodily injury. Respondent was\r\ndriving southward in the northbound lane when he collided with a\r\nmotorcycle injuring the riders. One rider, Maurice Lewis, was seriously\r\ninjured.1 Respondent's blood alcohol level was .23. He pled guilty to felony\r\nDUI and was sentenced to five years. Respondent was released from\r\nprison on April 9, 1997.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Lewis has made a partial recovery from the accident. He has some\r\n\r\nresidual problems, such as a loss of smell and taste, behavioral changes\r\n(i.e. emotional outbursts), and a knee injury.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 9\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF COCKLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have not sanctioned an attorney solely upon the basis of a\r\nconviction for felony DUI. Other jurisdictions that have considered the\r\nquestion of the appropriate sanction when an attorney drives under the\r\ninfluence and causes serious injury or death have found some period of\r\nsuspension or even disbarment warranted. See Danny R. Veilleux,\r\nAnnotation, Misconduct Involving Intoxication as Ground for Disciplinary\r\nAction Against Attorney, 1 A.L.R.5th 874 Â§Â§ 6-9 (1992 &amp; Supp. 1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fixed period of suspension is commonly imposed for a felony\r\nDUI conviction. See e.g. Kentucky Bar Ass'n v. Rankin, 862 S.W.2d 894\r\n(Ky. 1993)(six-month suspension and two year probationary period for\r\nfelony DWI); Kentucky Bar Ass'n v. Jones, 759 S.W.2d 61 (Ky. 1988)(court\r\nimposed two year suspension on attorney convicted of felony DUI and\r\nreckless homicide); In re Morris, 74 N.M. 679, 397 P.2d 475\r\n(1964)(indefinite suspension for involuntary manslaughter resulting from\r\nDUI); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Michaels, 38 Ohio St.3d 248, 257\r\nN.E.2d 299 (1988)(court imposed eighteen-month suspension when attorney\r\npled guilty to involuntary manslaughter, DWI, and reckless driving); In re\r\nCurran, 115 Wash.2d 747, 801 P.2d 962 (1990)(court imposed six-month\r\nsuspension when attorney convicted of vehicular manslaughter).\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We find respondent has violated Â§ 5(C) of Rule 413, SCACR, by\r\ncommitting a serious crime and his misconduct warrants an eighteen-\r\nmonth suspension. Therefore, respondent is hereby suspended from the\r\npractice of law in this State for a period of eighteen months retroactively\r\nto the date of his temporary suspension, May 2, 1996. Within fifteen days\r\nof the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk\r\nof Court showing that he has complied with Paragraph 30 of Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J.\r\n A.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24754","title":"Anonymous (M-156-90) v.

STATE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOORE, A.J.: We granted petitioner a writ of certiorari to\r\nreview the Court of Appeals' decision in Anonymous v. State Bd. of Med.\r\nExam'r, __S.C.__, 573 S.E.2d 870 (Ct. App. 1996). We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, the State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)\r\ninstituted disciplinary proceedings against respondent alleging he had\r\nengaged in unethical and unprofessional physical conduct during prostate\r\nexaminations of eight patients. After a hearing, the panel issued its\r\nreport finding respondent had committed misconduct with four patients by\r\nengaging in unethical and unprofessional contact and conduct likely to\r\ndeceive, defraud or harm the public, and respondent was deficient in moral\r\ncharacter or professional competence. The panel recommended respondent\r\nundergo a psychiatric evaluation and his license to practice medicine be\r\nsuspended pending the completion of the evaluation and a treatment plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992, after a final hearing, the Board found misconduct,\r\nimposed a public reprimand, and placed respondent's license in a\r\nprobationary status for an indefinite period, conditioned upon, inter alia,\r\nsemi-annual appearances before the Board.1 Respondent filed a motion to\r\nreconsider raising the issue of the correct standard of proof for an\r\nAdministrative Procedures Act (APA) proceeding. The Board denied\r\nrespondent's motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondent appealed to the circuit court pursuant to S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 1996). The circuit court reversed finding the final\r\norder was clearly erroneous and the evidence unreliable, not probative,\r\nand insubstantial. The Board appealed to the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court and held the\r\nstandard of proof in a professional disciplinary proceeding under the APA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1Between the panel hearing and the final hearing, respondent\r\n\r\nunderwent a psychiatric evaluation. The psychiatrist testified at the final\r\nhearing that he found \"no evidence of sociopathy and no evidence of sexual\r\ndeviant practices or behavior.\"\r\n\r\n\r\np. 12\r\n\r\nANONYMOUS v. STATE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis clear and convincing evidence.2 This issue was raised to the Court of\r\nAppeals as an additional sustaining ground by respondent.3 The Court of\r\nAppeals reversed and remanded for a de novo hearing for the Board to\r\napply the clear and convincing standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1) Was the standard of proof issue properly preserved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  2) Did the Court of Appeals err in holding the proper\r\n  standard of review is clear and convincing evidence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Preservation\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board contends the Court of Appeals erred in addressing\r\nthe standard of proof issue because it was not preserved. Respondent\r\nraised the standard of proof issue for the first time when he moved for\r\nreconsideration before the Board. The Board did not raise this\r\npreservation issue to the Court of Appeals in its petition for rehearing.\r\nTherefore, whether respondent failed to properly raise the issue of the\r\nstandard of proof is not properly before this Court.

Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71\r\nL.Ed.2d 599 (1982), the United States Supreme Court held the proper\r\nstandard of proof in parental rights termination proceedings is clear and\r\nconvincing. The Court applied the factors enunciated in Mathews v.\r\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), which govern a\r\ndetermination of what process is due under the fourteenth amendment: 1)\r\nthe private interest affected by the proceeding; 2) the risk of erroneous\r\ndeprivation of such interest; and 3) the government's interest supporting\r\nuse of the challenged procedure. The United States Supreme Court has\r\nmandated a clear and convincing standard of proof when the individual\r\ninterest involved is \"particularly important\" and \"more substantial than\r\nthe mere loss of money\" or when there is involved a \"significant\r\ndeprivation of liberty.\" Santosky, 455 U.S. at 755, 102 S.Ct. at 1396.;\r\nAddington v.

See e.g.\r\nSilva v.

See\r\ne.g. Johnson v. Arkansas Bd. Of Exam'rs in Psychology, 305 Ark. 451, 808\r\nS.W.2d 766 (1991)(rejected argument that clear and convincing standard\r\nshould be applied in license revocation cases and adopted preponderance\r\nstandard - same standard as in attorney disciplinaries); Sherman v.\r\nCommission on Licensure to Practice the Healing Art, 407 A.2d 595 (D.C.\r\nCt.App. 1979)(preponderance standard- court noted same as attorney\r\ndisbarment proceedings); Boswell v.

STATE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe jurisdictions which have discussed the issue and decided to apply the\r\nclear and convincing standard have done so noting that the federal\r\nconstitution does not mandate the higher standard. See e.g. Johnson,\r\nsupra. (\"The State of Oklahoma can afford greater due process safeguards\r\nthan those provided by the federal Constitution.\"); In re Benjamin, 698\r\nA.2d 434 (D.C. App. 1997)(clear and convincing standard should be applied\r\nbut that this standard is not constitutionally mandated as license to\r\npractice law is merely property right).\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some states have also specifically held that attorneys and\r\nother professionals do not have to be governed by the same standard of\r\nproof. See e.g. Grimm, supra. In attorney proceedings, South Carolina5 \r\nand at least 30 states apply the clear and convincing standard. See In re\r\nWalton, 676 P.2d 1078 (Alaska 1984)(discussion of standards used by\r\nstates). Further, the American Bar Association suggests the clear and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naddressed equal protection problems regarding different standards for two\r\n\r\nprofessions but found no violation); In re Martin, 111 A.D.2d 1009, 490\r\nN.Y.S.2d 328 (1985)(preponderance standard for medical profession but\r\ncourt declined to address whether this standard was constitutionally\r\npermissible in proceedings involving licensed professionals, an issue which\r\nwas not raised); Gandhi v.

Ct.App. 1992)(preponderance standard for physicians but\r\nclear and convincing standard for attorneys).\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still other jurisdictions use the clear and convincing standard\r\nonly when fraud is alleged or the proceedings are for revocation of a\r\nprofessional license rather than a lesser sanction. See e.g. In re D'Angelo,\r\n105 N.M. 391, 733 P.2d 360 (1986)(absent allegation of fraud or statute or\r\ncourt rule requiring higher burden of proof, standard is preponderance).\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 See e.g. In re Friday 263 S.C. 156, 208 S.E.2d 535 (1974); In re\r\nEdwards, 319 S.C. 57, 459 S.E.2d 837 (1995). There is not a particular\r\ncase in which this standard was adopted wherein the reasoning for its\r\nadoption is discussed. In one of the earlier cases, Ex parte Gadsden, 89\r\nRep. 352 (1911), the court stated that misconduct must be found by a\r\n\"clear preponderance\" of the evidence. The standard then evolved into\r\nclear and convincing. See State v. Jennings, 161 S.C. 263, 159 S.E.2d 627\r\n(1931). In any event, it is now well-settled that the standard in attorney\r\nand judicial disciplinary proceedings is clear and convincing evidence in\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 16\r\n\r\nANONYMOUS v. STATE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvincing standard be applied in attorney and judicial disciplinaries. See\r\nABA-BNA Lawyers' Manual on Professional Conduct Â§ 101-2101 (1984);\r\nABA Standards Relating to Judicial Discipline 8.40. However, as noted by\r\nthe dissent in Johnson, supra, the Federation of State Medical Boards\r\nrecommends the preponderance standard in medical disciplinary -\r\nproceedings. Johnson, 913 P.2d 1339, 1352.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find a preponderance of the evidence standard adequately\r\nprotects a physician's property interest in his license. We, however, leave\r\nit to the General Assembly to amend the APA and provide the higher\r\nstandard of proof for APA proceedings if it determines the higher standard\r\nappropriate. Accordingly, the Board applied the proper standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board contends that substantial evidence was presented to\r\nsupport its decision and therefore the circuit court erred in reversing the\r\ndecision. Section 1-23-380 of the APA provides that an agency's findings\r\nof facts may be reversed or modified only if clearly erroneous in view of\r\nthe reliable, probative and substantial evidence of record. See also Waters\r\nv. South Carolina Land Resources Comm'n, 321 S.C. 219, 467 S.E.2d 913\r\n(1996). \"Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor\r\nevidence viewed blindly from one side, but is evidence which, when\r\nconsidering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach\r\nthe conclusion that the agency reached.\" Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. South\r\nCarolina Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696\r\n(1984).\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully reviewing the evidence which was before the\r\nBoard, we find the evidence does not substantially support the conclusion\r\nrespondent committed misconduct. The Board found respondent had\r\ncommitted misconduct in conducting the examinations of Patients B, C, D,\r\nand F. The expert who testified for the Board, Dr. James Herlong,\r\ntestified that, except for Patient F, the other prostate examinations\r\nperformed by respondent were medically necessary. He testified whether\r\nthe examination performed upon Patient F was medically necessary was a\r\njudgment call.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In testifying that there was misconduct, Dr. Herlong focussed\r\nmore upon the method by which respondent drew the prostatic fluid\r\n(referred to as \"stripping\" or \"milking\"). Dr. Herlong testified this is\r\nusually done by the patient. However, he also testified that it is generally\r\nnot done by the doctor because it is unusual that the patient allows the\r\ndoctor to do it. Dr. Herlong testified that a doctor performing this type of\r\n\r\n\r\np. 17\r\n\r\nANONYMOUS v. STATE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexamination is not engaging in an improper practice, rather \"it's just that\r\nit can be done in more appropriate ways.\" Respondent called a urologist\r\nand a family practitioner who testified that the method used by\r\nrespondent was acceptable. Further, one complaint was dismissed when\r\nthe patient testified that he had been examined in the same manner when\r\nhe was in the military.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several patients who were not involved in the complaint\r\ntestified on behalf of respondent and stated that respondent had performed\r\nthe same type of prostate examination on them and they felt it was\r\nappropriate. None of the patients testified that they felt respondent\r\nreceived any sexual or perverse pleasure from the examinations. In fact,\r\nthe patients testified they felt that the examinations were conducted in a\r\nprofessional manner and did not feel they had been inappropriately\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no testimony that these examinations constituted\r\nmisconduct. Thus, the findings of the Board are clearly erroneous.6 \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals' decision and affirm the\r\ncircuit court's order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 Respondent testified at the final hearing that he no longer performs\r\n\r\nthese examinations in the same manner and he now follows a more\r\nacceptable method of obtaining prostatic fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24755","title":"Windsor Properties, Inc. v.

DOLPHIN HEAD CONSTRUCTION\r\nCO., ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several years, Randy Blackwell and Windsor Properties1 had a\r\nbusiness relationship with Ralph Liscio (\"Ralph\") and his wholly-owned\r\ncompany Dolphin Head Construction whereby Windsor would finance the\r\nconstruction and remodeling of houses by Dolphin Head. One of their joint\r\nprojects -- the purchase and renovation of the Brogdon property -- is at the\r\ncenter of the dispute in the present case. The parties had planned to\r\nrenovate this property and to split the profits when the property was sold.\r\nIn February 1990, Blackwell loaned Dolphin Head $27,6502 for the purchase\r\nand renovation of the Brogdon property. Brogdon was purchased in Dolphin\r\nHead's name.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ralph's wife, Linda Liscio (\"Linda\"), owned a piece of property called\r\nthe Pointer house. On October 26, 1990, Windsor Properties made a loan in\r\nthe amount of $127,000 to Linda, taking as security her equity in the Pointer\r\nhouse. This money was to be used to complete the Brogdon property.\r\nWindsor got back all of the money due it on the $127,000 loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linda and Ralph decided to list for sale both the Brogdon property and\r\nthe Pointer house; they would move into whichever house did not sell first.\r\nBlackwell knew that Linda's intent was to end up with one of these two\r\nhouses. The Pointer house was sold January 1, 1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ln February 1992, Ralph approached William Coffey (\"Attorney\") about\r\ndeeding Brogdon from Dolphin Head to Linda. A deed was prepared by\r\nAttorney to convey the property. The deed reads, \"Five dollars and no other\r\nconsideration.\" Attorney testified that he did not recall having any input into\r\nthe fact that the deed recites five dollars and no other consideration. He\r\nfurther stated: \"I may have asked if there were any consideration being\r\npassed, and I was told no, or we would have put it in there. We always\r\nwould ask that as a matter of policy.\" Attorney had no recollection of any\r\nmoney changing hands. Linda testified that she did not pay anything when\r\nshe received the deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Windsor Properties is owned by Blackwell and George Jordan.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2The record is not consistent as to this figure. Blackwell testified to the\r\n$27,650 figure; however, Ralph actually testified to a higher amount. Ralph\r\ntestified that Blackwell wrote a check for $38,000 to Dolphin Head.\r\nBlackwell then advanced another $13,000 for renovations.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDSOR PROPERTIES, INC., v. DOLPHIN HEAD CONSTRUCTION\r\nCO., ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring of 1992, Ralph wrote Attorney a letter that listed eight\r\nseparate debts (totaling some $180,500) he owed Blackwell and Jordan. In\r\nthe letter, Ralph proposed a scheme for repayment of these debts. Ralph\r\nwrote in the letter that he anticipated that in the course of negotiations,\r\nBlackwell would bring up the issue of Brogdon house. Ralph stated this\r\nproperty \"is in Linda's name; we have a mortgage of $75,000 on it and in no\r\nway will Linda agree to pledging the remaining equity [on the house].\"\r\n(emphasis in original). Attorney passed on the letter to Blackwell. Blackwell\r\ntestified that he did not know, prior to receiving this letter, that the property\r\nhad been transferred to Linda.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the letter was sent, Ralph negotiated Dolphin Head's debt\r\nwith Windsor, and they reached an agreement on May 1, 1992. Dolphin\r\nHead executed a promissory note and a loan agreement in favor of Windsor\r\nin the amount of $110,092. The note was personally guaranteed by Ralph.\r\nAt the same time, Windsor received a confession of judgment from Dolphin\r\nHead and Ralph. The confession states that Dolphin Head and Ralph are\r\nindebted to Windsor in the amount of $110,092.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 1993, Ralph and Linda contracted to sell the Brogdon\r\nproperty to certain purchasers. When Blackwell heard about the proposed\r\nsale, he filed a lis pendens.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1993, Windsor brought this action against Dolphin Head,\r\nRalph, Linda, and another party. The complaint alleged that the May 1,\r\n1992 note executed in favor of Windsor for $110,092 was in default. It\r\nmoreover alleged that Ralph conveyed the Brogdon property to Linda for no\r\nconsideration, thereby depriving Windsor of the right to obtain satisfaction\r\nof all proceeds due to it by Dolphin Head. Windsor prayed for an order\r\nreconveying the Brogdon property to Dolphin Head. The complaint\r\nadditionally alleged that Dolphin Head and Ralph had defaulted on a $50,000\r\nloan.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their answer, Dolphin Head and Ralph declared that they had\r\nexecuted a loan agreement, promissory note, and confession of judgment to\r\nmemorialize the indebtedness to Windsor, and admitted that the note was in\r\ndefault. They also admitted that Dolphin Head had conveyed the Brogdon\r\nproperty to Linda. By way of counterclaim against Windsor, they alleged\r\nintentional interference with contract and slander of title. They specified\r\nthat \"By deed dated February 6, 1992, Defendant Linda Liscio became the\r\nowner of the [Brogdon] property . . . .\" It was further declared that on\r\nAugust 19, 1993, Linda entered into a contract for the sale of the Brogdon\r\n\r\n\r\np. 21\r\n\r\nWINDSOR PROPERTIES, INC., v. DOLPHIN HEAD CONSTRUCTION\r\nCO., ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty to a third-party. On September 13, 1993, Windsor filed a lis\r\npendens that prevented her from conveying title in accordance with the terms\r\nof the contract and created a cloud on the title, causing her damages of\r\n$175,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter was referred to a special referee to conduct a hearing and\r\nissue an order directly appealable to this Court. The referee held that\r\nWindsor should be awarded $107,092, with interest, and $36,934, with\r\ninterest, against Dolphin Head and Ralph individually, as well as $10,000 in\r\nattorneys' fees. The order further found that Linda had paid adequate and\r\nvaluable consideration for the transfer of the Brogdon property by Dolphin\r\nHead. Even though there was no consideration exchanged when the deed\r\nwas delivered, Linda had already reimbursed Blackwell for the purchase\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the slander of title counterclaim against Windsor, the\r\nreferee held that the lis pendens on the Brogdon property should be canceled;\r\nhowever, there was no evidence that Windsor acted maliciously when it\r\ncaused the lis pendens to be filed against the Brogdon property.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties have appealed. Windsor argues on appeal that the referee\r\nerred in finding that the transfer of the Brogdon property was not fraudulent\r\nwithin the meaning of the Statute of Elizabeth. The Liscios have appealed\r\nthe referee's denial of their slander of title claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Statute of Elizabeth\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windsor contends that Dolphin Head's transfer of the Brogdon property\r\nto Linda was fraudulent under the Statute of Elizabeth.3 We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statute of Elizabeth, as codified in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-23-10\r\n(Supp. 1997), provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Every ... conveyance of lands ... which may be had or made to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3The Liscios initially argue that Windsor's Statement of Issue on Appeal\r\n\r\ndoes not comply with Rule 207(b)(1)(B), SCACR, which requires that the\r\nstatement be \"concise and direct.\" This argument is without merit.\r\nWindsor's Statement of Issue on Appeal does concisely and directly identify\r\nthe question before this Court.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 22\r\n\r\nWINDSOR PROPERTIES, INC., v. DOLPHIN HEAD CONSTRUCTION\r\nCO., ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  or for any intent or purpose to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors\r\n  and others of their just and lawful . . .debts . . . must be \r\n  deemed and taken . . .to be clearly and utterly void, frustrate\r\n  and of no effect, any pretense, color, feigned consideration,\r\n  expressing of use, or any other matter or thing to the contrary\r\n  notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have held that under this statute, conveyances shall be set aside\r\nunder two conditions: First, where the transfer is made by the grantor with\r\nthe actual intent of defrauding his creditors where that intent is imputable\r\nto the grantee, even though there is a valuable consideration; and, second,\r\nwhere a transfer is made without actual intent to defraud the grantor's\r\ncreditors, but without consideration. McDaniel v. Allen, 265 S.C. 237, 217\r\nS.E.2d 773 (1975). The present case involves the second scenario envisioned\r\nby McDaniel. If the transfer was not made on a valuable consideration, no\r\nactual intent to hinder or delay creditors needs be proven. Here, there is\r\nextensive evidence that Dolphin Head received no consideration for its\r\ntransfer of Brogdon to Linda. The deed transferring the property stated:\r\n\"Five dollars and no other consideration.\" The attorney who drew up the\r\ndeed testified that he had no recollection of any money changing hands.\r\nLinda herself testified that she did not pay anything when she received the\r\ndeed. On appeal, the Liscios' essentially argue that consideration existed in\r\nthe form of the thousands of dollars Linda advanced for the purchase and\r\nrenovation of Brogdon. There does not exist clear and convincing evidence\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well-established that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Where transfers to members of the family are attacked either\r\n  upon the ground of actual fraud or on account of their voluntary\r\n  character, the law imposes the burden on the transferee to\r\n  establish both a valuable consideration and the bona fides of the\r\n  transaction by clear and convincing testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGardner v. Kirven, 184 S.C. 37, 41, 191 S.E. 814, 816 (1937); see also\r\nColeman v. Daniel, II, 261 S.C. 198, 199 S.E.2d 74 (1973); Matthews v.\r\nMatthews, 207 S.C. 170, 35 S.E.2d 157 (1945); Matthews v. Montgomery, 193\r\nS.C. 118, 7 S.E.2d 841 (1940); First Union Nat. Bank v. Smith, 314 S.C. 459,\r\n445 S.E.2d 457 (Ct. App. 1994). Here, the property was transferred from\r\nDolphin Head, wholly-owned by Ralph, to Linda. Accordingly, because this\r\n\r\n\r\np. 23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDSOR PROPERTIES, INC., V. DOLPHIN HEAD CONSTRUCTION\r\nCO., ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas in reality an intra-family transfer,4 the law imposes on Linda the burden\r\nof establishing by clear and convincing evidence that there was consideration\r\nand that the transaction was bona fide.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linda asserts that she made over $168,000 in payments for the\r\nBrogdon property. An examination of the record reveals that the maximum\r\nshe could have paid, during the period preceding the conveyance of property\r\nto her, was $40,965 to Blackwell for the purchase price of Brogdon, and\r\n$79,528 for other costs connected to Brogdon. These numbers in isolation\r\nwould suggest that she has conveyed valuable consideration for Brogdon;\r\nhowever, there are a number of problems with these figures. First, the\r\nrecord contains no documentary evidence of these payments besides a single\r\nchart prepared by Linda listing her contributions. The chart references\r\nattachments (e.g. copies of checks), but none of these have been included in\r\nthe record on appeal. Because the law imposes on Linda, as the transferee,\r\nthe burden of establishing the validity of the transfer, she has the\r\nresponsibility of providing an adequate record. Cf General Accident Ins. Co.\r\nv. Safeco Ins. Companies, 314 S.C. 63, 443 S.E.2d 813 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, assuming these contributions were being made, they were\r\noffered at a time when Dolphin Head was still showing signs of ownership\r\nof the property. This same chart shows that in March 1991, Dolphin Head\r\npledged the Brogdon property as security for a $31,849 mortgage loan, which\r\nwas to be \"used by Dolphin Head for operating capital.\" Third, it is unclear\r\nthat the payments were going to Dolphin Head: One check is listed as being\r\nmade out to a plumber; another is described as being made out to \"South\r\nCarolina Federal for application to debt incurred to renovate Brogdon House.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major problem with Linda's argument -- that she gave\r\nvaluable consideration -- is that it contradicts the position she took at the\r\nhearing before the referee. There, the Liscio's attorney stated that the crux\r\nof their argument was not on the basis of consideration, but rather, on the\r\nbasis of a prior satisfaction:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  There was no money paid for the deed at the time the deed was\r\n  delivered. We concede that. There's never been a question about\r\n  that. The evidence has already been introduced that Dolphin\r\n  Head didn't buy this property. Mr. Blackwell bought the\r\n  property. He put up the money. Linda Liscio gave him the\r\n  money back. That's our position with regard to the deed. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4Linda testified, \"Ralph Liscio and Dolphin Head to me were the same.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 24\r\n\r\nWINDSOR PROPERTIES, INC., v. DOLPHIN HEAD CONSTRUCTION\r\nCO., ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  don't want there to be any misunderstanding about any -- we\r\n  don't claim that there was any money given in exchange for the\r\n  deed . . . .Our contention is Mr. Blackwell . . . bought the\r\n  property. Mrs. Liscio gave him his money back, and then she\r\n  funded the renovation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we reject Linda's argument because it contravenes the purpose\r\nof the Statute of Elizabeth, which aims to prevent persons from defrauding\r\ncreditors by transferring their assets to third-parties. The focus of the\r\nStatute is whether the grantor has reserved sufficient assets to satisfy his\r\nobligations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Where a conveyance is made without an actual intent to defraud\r\n  but without consideration, it is said that the conveyance will\r\n  stand if the grantor reserves a sufficient amount of property to\r\n  pay his creditors. But this means a sufficient amount of property\r\n  not merely at the time of the transfer, but an amount from which\r\n  in the final analysis the creditors are able to collect their\r\n  indebtedness in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGardner, 184 S.C. at 42, 191 S.E. at 816 (internal citations omitted). In this\r\ncase, the deed transferring the property to Linda was executed three months\r\nbefore Ralph and Dolphin Head executed a note and confession of judgment\r\nevidencing their $110,092 debt to Windsor. The deed was executed\r\napproximately two months before Ralph wrote Attorney and informed him\r\nthat he owed Windsor some $180,500. Dolphin Head and Ralph are\r\ninsolvent. The conveyance will not stand here because Dolphin Head and\r\nRalph have not reserved a sufficient amount of property to pay their creditor.\r\nLinda has not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the\r\ntransfer was for consideration and was bona fides. Accordingly, the referee\r\nerred in failing to find that the Statute of Elizabeth had not been violated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Lis Pendens\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liscios have cross-appealed, raising one issue. They assert that\r\nthe referee erred in concluding there was no evidence that Windsor was\r\nacting maliciously when it filed the lis pendens against the Brogdon property,\r\nthereby slandering the title to this property. Because we set aside the\r\ntransfer of Brogdon from Dolphin Head to Linda, the Liscios have no title to\r\nthis property, on the basis of which they may assert a slander of title action.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 25\r\n\r\nWINDSOR PROPERTIES, INC., v. DOLPHIN HEAD CONSTRUCTION\r\nCO., ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the foregoing, the referee's order is REVERSED on the issue\r\nof the violation of the Statute of Elizabeth. Accordingly, the transfer of the\r\nBrogdon property from Dolphin Head to Linda is set aside. The referee's\r\norder is AFFIRMED on the issue of slander of title.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 26\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24756","title":"Radalytic Labs, Inc. v.

Culver, 96-UP-194 (S.C. Ct.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 27\r\n\r\nRADALYTIC LABS, INC., ET AL. v. DAVID CULVER, ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\nApp. filed July 9, 1996). We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacts/Procedural Posture\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David and Janice Culver (\"Sellers\") owned one hundred percent of the\r\ncommon stock in Radalytic Labs, Inc. (David owning sixty per cent and\r\nJanice owning forty per cent). On June 2, 1989, they entered into an\r\nagreement to sell eighty percent of the stock (David and Janice each selling,\r\nforty per cent) to Radon, Inc. (\"Purchaser\"). The total purchase price was\r\n$190,000. Purchaser agreed to make a cash down payment of $25,000, and\r\nto execute a promissory note for the remaining balance of $165,000, such note\r\nto be repaid according to the terms of the agreement. Purchaser also agreed\r\nto place its newly-purchased shares in escrow as security for full payment.\r\nA separate \"Pledge and Escrow Agreement\" was executed by the parties.\r\nFinally, David was to continue working for Radalytic Labs, Inc. as a\r\ncorporate officer for five years under terms as set forth in the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 18, 1993, David's employment was terminated.  Radalytic\r\nLabs, Inc. and Purchaser subsequently filed suit against Sellers alleging,\r\ninter alia, misappropriation of corporate assets and breach of contract.\r\nSellers counterclaimed alleging breach of contract on several grounds, the one\r\npertinent here being default under the purchase agreement in that the\r\nrequired note payments had not been made.1 The case was referred to a\r\nmaster-in-equity with direct appeal to this Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing, Purchaser and Radalytic Labs, Inc. represented they\r\nwere no longer pursuing their claims against Sellers; thus the trial issues\r\nconcerned only Sellers' counterclaims and third-party claims. Specifically,\r\nboth sides requested the master to rule on \"whether or not the tendering of\r\nall the stock of Radalytic Labs, Inc. to [Sellers] would satisfy any debt owing\r\nfrom the Plaintiffs and the third-party defendants to [Sellers] in full.\" The\r\nmaster ruled the tender of stock so satisfied Purchaser's obligations and\r\nordered the conveyance of stock to Sellers. The Court of Appeals affirmed in\r\nan unpublished opinion. Radalytic Labs, Inc. et al. v. Culver, 96-UP-194\r\n(S.C. Ct. App. filed July 9, 1996).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1Sellers also asserted a third-party claim against Parker Wright and\r\n\r\nBrickford Faucette, Purchaser's owners, seeking to hold them individually\r\nliable.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 28\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRADALYTIC LABS, INC., ET AL. v. DAVID CULVER, ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Court granted certiorari to consider this aspect of the master's\r\nruling.2\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focal point of contention centers around the following language in\r\nthe Pledge and Escrow Agreement concerning the rights of the parties upon\r\ndefault:\r\n\r\n  Upon a default or failure to perform by [Purchaser] of its obligations\r\n  under the note or the contract referred to above, [Sellers] shall give\r\n  written notice of such default to [Purchaser] and to Escrow Agent.\r\n  Unless within ten (10) days following the date of such notice\r\n  [Purchaser] provides satisfactory evidence to Escrow Agent that the\r\n  default or failure to perform has been satisfactorily cured, Escrow\r\n  Agent is authorized to immediately deliver the attached proxy and all\r\n  certificates representing pledged shares to [Sellers]. [Sellers] may\r\n  then acquire the stock for their own account, which shall satisfy all\r\n  obligations of [Purchaser] to [Sellers] or sell the pledged stock at\r\n  a bonafide private sale or otherwise and apply the proceeds of sale,\r\n  first to the cost of sale and then to payment of any obligations of\r\n  [Purchaser] to [Sellers], all of which shall be deemed to be\r\n  accelerated by such event of default. Following any sale, the\r\n  surplus, if any, shall be delivered to [Purchaser].\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is essentially uncontested that this agreement gave Sellers the option, upon\r\ndefault, of either (1) keeping the stock, in which case all obligations of\r\nPurchaser would be deemed satisfied, or (2) selling the stock.3 The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2We declined to review the Court of Appeals' reversal of the master's\r\n\r\nruling Sellers were barred from recovery because they had unclean hands.\r\nSee Culver, 96-UP-294, at 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3In interpreting the contractual language, the master found:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Escrow Agreement entered into by the parties, in its plain\r\n  reading, states that if [Purchaser does] not fulfill its obligation to\r\n  [Sellers], it may tender the stock in full satisfaction of [its]\r\n  obligations to [Sellers]. The plain reading of the agreement\r\n  states that [Sellers] may acquire the stock \"which shall satisfy all\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\np. 29\r\n\r\nRADALYTIC LABS, INC., ET AL. v. DAVID CULVER, ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\ndeterminative issue is whether, should Sellers exercise the second option,\r\nthey would be entitled to seek a deficiency judgment if the stock were to sell\r\nat a loss.4 In finding Sellers did not have this right, the Court of Appeals\r\nfound, \"Should [Sellers] sell the stock at a private sale, there is no provision\r\nin the contract allowing [Sellers] to seek a deficiency judgment against\r\n[Purchaser] in the event the stock sells at a loss.\" Culver, 96-UP-194, at 3.\r\nThe Court of Appeals is correct that there is no contract provision addressing\r\nany right to a deficiency judgment. However, Sellers argue they are entitled\r\nto seek a deficiency judgment as a matter of law under Title 36 of the South\r\nCarolina Code. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 36-9-504(2) states, \"If the security interest secures an\r\nindebtedness, the secured party shall account to the debtor for any surplus,\r\nand, unless otherwise agreed, the debtor is liable for any deficiency.\"\r\n(emphasis supplied). We interpret this language to give a secured party the\r\nright to seek a deficiency judgment unless such right is specifically refused\r\nby agreement. Because the contract here is silent on this issue, we find\r\nSellers had this statutory right. See Blakeley v. Rabon, 266 S.C. 68, 72, 22l\r\nS.E.2d 767, 769 (1976) (\"Words cannot be read into a contract which impart\r\nintent wholly unexpressed when the contract was executed\"). Therefore, the\r\nCourt of Appeals erred in affirming the master's ruling.5 This case is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  obligations . . . .\" It is therefore concluded that the tender of\r\n  stock of Radalytic Labs, Inc. to [Sellers] has been made by\r\n  [Purchaser] and satisfied the obligations of [Purchaser].\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nApparently the master was under the impression it was the Purchaser's\r\nchoice as to which option Sellers would take. This was an erroneous\r\ninterpretation of the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4If Sellers cannot seek a deficiency judgment, the master's ruling would,\r\nas a practical matter, be correct, at least regarding Sellers' rights. In other\r\nwords, if Sellers cannot seek any deficiency, it would not matter whether they\r\nexercise option one or two because they could sell it regardless of which\r\noption they technically exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5We summarily reject Purchaser's argument Sellers have not preserved\r\nthis issue because they failed to argue it to the master. The record clearly\r\nshows otherwise. Additionally, we find Purchaser's arguments that section\r\n36-9-504 does not apply to the security interest in this case, and that Sellers\r\ndid not have rights in the collateral as required before a security interest can\r\nattach, see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-203(1)(c) (Supp. 1996), to be without merit.\r\n\r\n\r\np. 30\r\n\r\nRADALYTIC LABS, INC., ET AL. v. DAVID CULVER, ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore remanded for any further proceeding consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, to the extent Purchasers argue Sellers are barred from seeking a\r\n\r\ndeficiency judgment because they did not take adequate care of the collateral,.\r\nsee S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-207 (Supp. 1996), we find this argument would be\r\nbetter addressed on remand should Sellers actually seek a deficiency\r\njudgment in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 31\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24757","title":"R.

We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master-in-equity awarded petitioner Seyed Rassool Djebelli\r\njudgment against Crary and Durham under the South Carolina Unfair\r\nTrade Practices Act (UTPA)1 based on a finding that they engaged in an\r\nunfair and deceptive trade practice that affected the public interest\r\nbecause it had the potential for repetition. R. Michael Crary, Carl M.\r\nDurham, and C&amp;A Mortgage Services appealed. The Court of Appeals\r\nreversed finding that the evidence was insufficient to prove a potential for\r\nrepetition. We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appeals'\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's holding that the\r\nconduct of Respondents Crary and Durham was actionable under the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-10, et seq. (1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 33\r\n\r\nCRARY, ET AL., v. DJEBELLI, ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUTPA. To be actionable under the UTPA, the unfair or deceptive act or\r\npractice must have an impact upon the public interest. Haley Nursery\r\nCo., Inc. v. Forrest, 298 S.C. 520, 381 S.E.2d 906 (1989). Unfair or\r\ndeceptive acts or practices have an impact upon the public interest if the\r\nacts or practices have the potential for repetition. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeals found the master did not point to any\r\nevidence in support of his finding that Crary and Durham's acts had the\r\npotential for repetition. Petitioner asserts Crary's testimony that he and\r\nDurham had had several opportunities to enter into transactions similar to\r\nthe one here was sufficient to show a potential for repetition. The Court\r\nof Appeals found Crary's testimony alone was insufficient to show a\r\npotential for repetition without proof that respondents also engaged in\r\nunfair or deceptive acts when they had those opportunities in the past or\r\nthat they were inclined to engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices if\r\ngiven the opportunity in the future. Petitioner contends the Court of\r\nAppeals added another element of proof when they found that a plaintiff\r\nmust allege and prove at least two separate torts to show an adverse\r\nimpact on the public interest. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After alleging and proving facts demonstrating the potential for\r\nrepetition of the defendant's actions, the plaintiff has proven an adverse\r\neffect on the public interest. Daisy Outdoor Advertising v. Abbott, __\r\nS.C. __, 473 S.E.2d 47 (1996). The plaintiff need not allege or prove\r\nanything further in relation to the public interest requirement. We held\r\nin Daisy the Court of Appeals erred in requiring more. To the extent the\r\nCourt of Appeals required more than a showing of potential for repetition\r\nhere, that is error. Daisy, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential for repetition may be shown in two ways: 1) by\r\nshowing the same kind of actions occurred in the past, thus making it\r\nlikely they will continue to occur absent deterrence, or 2) by showing the\r\ncompany's procedures create a potential for repetition of the unfair and\r\ndeceptive acts. Daisy, supra. We specifically declined in Daisy to hold\r\nthat these are the only means for showing potential repetition and stated\r\neach case must be evaluated on its own merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury,\r\nour scope of review extends merely to the correction of errors of law;\r\nfactual findings of the trial judge will not be disturbed on appeal unless a\r\nreview of the record discloses that there is no evidence which reasonably\r\nsupports the judge's findings. Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of\r\n\r\n\r\np. 34\r\n\r\nCRARY, ET AL., v. DJEBELLI, ET AL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). Since the master-in-equity\r\nfound there was a potential for repetition of Crary and Durham's actions,\r\nthe reviewing court's only task was to determine whether the record\r\ncontained any evidence to support the trial judge's finding. Respondents,\r\nwho remain in the same business, admit they have had the opportunity\r\nand have previously entered into similar conduct as complained of in this\r\ncase. The trial judge's finding of potential for repetition is not wholly\r\nunsupported by the evidence. See York v. Conway (alleged acts or\r\npractices have the potential for repetition where defendant remains in the\r\nsame business and faced with opportunities to repeat the conduct).2\r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals' opinion is\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 __S.C.__, 480 S.E.2d 726 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\np. 35\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
