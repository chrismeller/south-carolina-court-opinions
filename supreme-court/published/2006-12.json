McMaster, Attorney General, and James G. Bogle, Jr., Senior Assistant Attorney General, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Desa A. Ballard, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, the full panel adopted the sub-panel report and the recommendation that respondent, David B. Greene, be suspended from the practice of law for nine months, with conditions, and be required to pay the costs of the proceedings. Â We agree with the recommended sanction.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1998, respondent unwittingly became part of an illegal pyramid scheme disguised as an evangelical ministry, known as HISway International Ministries (â€œHISwayâ€ or â€œHIMâ€).Â  Respondentâ€™s involvement included (1) investing his own money with the ministry; (2) representing Rev. Johnny Cabe and HIM in a federal criminal investigation and in all other legal matters; and (3) acting as escrow agent for HIM.Â  In the capacity of escrow agent, respondent allowed HIM to use his lawyerâ€™s trust account for deposits and disbursements after HIMâ€™s American accounts had all been frozen by the government.\r\nCabe eventually was convicted of 26 counts of wire fraud and money laundering.[1]Â  Cabeâ€™s convictions were affirmed by the Fourth Circuit in a written opinion, which was submitted as one of Disciplinary Counselâ€™s exhibits.Â  From that opinion, the following facts are excerpted because they effectively explain the pyramid scheme and provide some background to this disciplinary matter:\r\n\r\n  Cabe was pastor of a small independent Baptist church in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Â Beginning in January 1998 and continuing through October 1998, Cabe and another minister, Shelton Joel Shirley, solicited individuals to invest money in an investment scheme called â€œhigh yield trading programs.â€ Â They promoted the scheme as a charitable venture affiliated with a religious organization, Hisway International Ministries of London, England.â€¦ Â Cabe and Shirley told potential investors that they had contacts with â€œtradersâ€ who would invest their money in European bank debentures. Â Some solicitations described the investments as charitable â€œgiftsâ€ and the return of investments as â€œre-giftsâ€ and suggested that because of their charitable nature, there would be no tax consequences.\r\n  Cabe portrayed the investment programs as profitable and without risk and claimed that investors typically would double their money within thirty to ninety days of investment.â€¦\r\n  Potential investors were given documents describing the lucrative nature of the scheme and prohibiting them from revealing any information relating to it. Â The documents instructed that if any such disclosure occurred, the investor would forfeit the investment. Â Investors were also required to pay a three percent â€œadministration giftâ€ fee to Cabe on every transaction.\r\n  On January 9, 1998, Cabe began establishing bank accounts in order to aggregate and aid in the transfer of investorsâ€™ funds. Â Upon receiving contributions from investors, Cabe wired the funds to various organizations and individuals for alleged investment. Â The evidence at trial showed that these investments were in fact fictitious and that the money was stolen by the traders. Â Moreover, the evidence established that $679,317 of investorsâ€™ contributions were [sic] diverted to Cabe, Shirley, and their families.\r\n  In the course of their dealings with investors, Cabe and Shirley recruited â€œstewardsâ€ for the scheme. Â After making a contribution to Cabeâ€™s ministry, the stewards were tasked with recruiting other investors for the programs. Â In order to recruit stewards, some of whom were already investors, Cabe provided them with literature detailing the success of the programs. Â In return for recruiting new investors, these stewards expected to receive a portion of the profits from maturing investments.\r\n  In meetings with investors, Cabe categorically stated that none of his prior investments had faced any problems. Â However, beginning in April 1998, Cabe complained to the â€œtradersâ€ that he had not received any return on the investments and was unable to pay any of his contributors. Â He expressed concern that he would not only lose future potential investors, but that he also might be â€œsued for fraud.â€ Â Even with this knowledge, however, Cabe continued to solicit investors with representations that the programs were highly profitable and risk-free.\r\n  Â In July 1998, after certain of the investors demanded payment of the promised return on their investments, Cabe transferred money to some of them. Â Cabe represented that these payments were profits from their investments in the trading programs. Â However, these funds were in reality from the aggregated funds of new investors. Â The evidence presented at trial showed that these payments to investors were made to prove the programs profitable and to encourage further investments.\r\n  Â â€¦\r\n  Eventually Cabe and Shirley were indicted in the court below. Â Shirley pleaded guilty and testified for the government at trial. Â One of the alleged traders, Terence Wingrove, an English art dealer, also testified for the government pursuant to a plea agreement. Â He admitted that he had received several million dollars in investment money from Cabe.\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Cabe, 57 Fed.Appx. 542, 543-44 (4th Cir. 2003) (footnote omitted).Â  \r\n Respondent was drawn into the scheme through his friend, Dennis Smith, who he had known for 25 years.[2]Â  Smith met Cabe around March 1998; Cabe explained to Smith that HIM planned to â€œspread goodwill internationallyâ€ by raising money through debenture trading.Â  The profits from this international trading would be used for benevolent and religious causes, and the original â€œdonorsâ€ would be â€œre-giftedâ€ or rewarded with substantial returns.Â  More specifically, HIMâ€™s pitch was that if a person made a â€œgiftâ€ to the ministry, that personâ€™s money would increase by 500%; the donor would receive 200% in return, therefore doubling the money, and the other 300% would be used for the ministryâ€™s world wide Christian missionary programs.Â  Smith acted as a steward for HIM and stated he was taken in â€œhook, line and sinker.â€ Â Smith testified that he believed respondentâ€™s involvement was based on respondentâ€™s trust in him.\r\nRespondent gave $50,000.00 to HISway in May 1998.Â  Respondent testified that his initial involvement resulted completely from his reliance on Smithâ€™s verbal representations about HIM.[3] \r\nThe Secret Service began to investigate HIM, and in July 1998, the government froze all of HIMâ€™s bank accounts.Â  Respondent learned of this in late September 1998 at a meeting in his office attended by Smith and Roy Palmer;[4] Cabe also participated in the meeting via telephone from England.Â  Regarding the frozen accounts, it was represented to respondent that it was all â€œa big mistake.â€ Â It was also at this meeting when respondent was asked to legally represent Cabe and HIM in the criminal investigation[5] and to act as escrow agent for HIM by using his law firmâ€™s trust account.[6]Â  \r\nAccording to respondent, Smith and Palmer presented the idea of using his trust account.Â  Smith and Palmer told respondent that several people were owed â€œre-giftsâ€ of money, but could not be paid because of the frozen accounts, as well as others who â€œwanted to get in onâ€ the trading.Â  Respondent testified that he told Cabe the following:Â  â€œI will let these donors donate money to HISway and Iâ€™ll let you place it in my trust account.Â  We can get some of these other people paid back.â€Â  According to Smith, however, it was specifically suggested to use respondentâ€™s trust account because it was an account that could not be frozen by the government.Â  Smith could not recall who made this suggestion.Â  Respondent denies knowing this was the reason he was asked to use his trust account.\r\nOn October 26, 1998, respondentâ€™s legal representation of Cabe and HIM â€œin all matters necessaryâ€ was memorialized in writing with the parties agreeing to a $5,000.00 retainer for respondent.Â  Disciplinary Counsel presented evidence that respondent did not usually do criminal defense work; when questioned about why he took on the case, respondent replied that he believed Cabe was innocent and knew that if necessary, he â€œcould always associate someone.â€\r\nFrom September 30, 1998 to November 3, 1998, ten deposits were made into respondentâ€™s trust account related to HISway, for a total of $468,280.00.Â  This included a $150,000.00 deposit from attorney John Hagins as well as another $50,000.00 deposit from respondent himself.Â  Approximately 25 payments related to HISway were made from respondentâ€™s trust account between October 1, 1998, and March 24, 1999, for a total of $426,957.50 in disbursements.Â  These payments included $5,000.00 and $3,917.50 to respondent himself for attorney fees related to his representation of Cabe and HIM.Â  The other expenditures were paid to various people and companies, including, for example, Cabeâ€™s Corner Store.[7]Â  Respondent did not independently investigate who the payees were; however, he believed the money belonged to his clients, Cabe and HISway, and therefore he felt obligated to make disbursements as directed by Cabe and Cabeâ€™s designees, Palmer and Smith.\r\nComplainant John Dill explained that Smith told him about HIM, and Dill believed he would double his money within 45 days.Â  Dill made two $50,000.00 investments with HIM - one was made before respondent got involved and one after.Â  The latter investment was wired directly into respondentâ€™s trust account.Â  Dill stated that he felt that his money would be safe in an attorneyâ€™s trust account and that he had a lawyer-client relationship by virtue of the wire transfer and what Smith had told him.Â  Prior to making this second payment, Dill was required to sign a â€œReaffirmation Affidavitâ€ wherein he â€œreaffirmedâ€ that any money given had been an â€œunsolicited donationâ€ without any promises made.Â  \r\nComplainant Ann Barnes also made two payments to HISway -Â Â  $11,000.00 in the summer of 1998, and $25,000.00 in fall of 1998.Â  When Barnes was asked by Palmer for the second payment, Barnes knew the accounts had been frozen.Â  Palmer explained that respondent, an attorney, would be handling all the money, and so Barnes sent her $25,000 payment to respondentâ€™s trust account by cashierâ€™s check.Â  Barnes stated that based on what Palmer had told her, she believed that respondent was representing her interests.Â  Barnes also signed a Reaffirmation Affidavit when she made her second payment.Â  \r\nAttorney Johnny Hagins testified that Palmer introduced him to HISway.Â  Hagins invested $100,000.00 in March 1998, and five months later, he received $150,000.00 back.Â  Hagins became aware that the HISway accounts had been frozen, but at a meeting he was told that the trades had been successful, and the money was being held in a European account.Â  In the fall of 1998, Hagins went to a meeting at respondentâ€™s office with respondent, Cabe and Shirley, and he learned that respondent would be, in Haginsâ€™ words, a â€œgatekeeperâ€ for the money by using his trust account.Â  After HIM associated with respondent, Hagins made two additional payments of $150,000.00 and $35,000.00 at the beginning of October 1998.Â  By January of 1999, Hagins was upset he had not seen the return on his investment.Â  Respondent, Hagins, Palmer, Smith, and Cabe again met in respondentâ€™s office, and Hagins said they told respondent they wanted him â€œto birddog this thing and make sure itâ€™s done right.â€Â  \r\nIn March 1999, respondent began attempting to end his legal representation of Cabe and HIM.Â  He eventually withdrew in May 1999.Â  Although he had had several discussions as Cabeâ€™s lawyer with the Secret Service and the Assistant U.S. Attorney, he never made an appearance for Cabe in federal court.Â  Therefore, he unilaterally withdrew as Cabeâ€™s lawyer.Â  \r\nRespondent met with Hagins in March 1999, and told him the money was â€œjust about all gone.â€Â  Respondent also informed Hagins that he had sent out the money as directed by Cabe, Smith, and Palmer.[8] \r\nAfter Cabeâ€™s conviction, the federal district court issued an order regarding the distribution of funds that had been seized by the government to victims of the HIM fraud.Â  Respondent himself sought some reimbursement for his losses from the federal court.Â  He asserted in a November 1999 affidavit that his payments were investments; however, because he initially characterized his payments as gifts during a January 1999 interview with the Secret Service, he was disallowed any monetary recovery.Â  United States v. Cabe, 311 F.Supp.2d 501 (2003).\r\nMitigating Circumstances\r\nRespondent testified that he never believed Cabe was involved in anything illegal and if he had suspected wrongdoing, he would not have represented Cabe.Â  Once it became clear to him that Cabe was unwilling to assist the governmentâ€™s case and there had been an illegal scheme, he began to withdraw as Cabeâ€™s lawyer.Â  In an attempt to explain why he was duped, he told the panel that he believed HIM to be an international ministry governed by a blind trust and the money was going to be used for â€œeleemosynary purposes and Christian endeavors.â€Â  He had seen his own father run a legitimate ministry and raise money for a hospital in Africa.Â  He stated he had no criminal intent.Â  \r\nAdditionally, respondentâ€™s older brother, attorney Tom Greene, testified before the panel.Â  Tom, a former Greenville solicitor and former legislator, stated that his brother is â€œsomewhat gullible.â€Â  Respondent also presented several witnesses who testified or submitted affidavits regarding his good character and reputation as a lawyer.\r\nFinally, respondent has no disciplinary history in almost 30 years as an attorney.Â  He cooperated with the federal investigation after he withdrew as Cabeâ€™s lawyer, and also cooperated with disciplinary counsel.Â  He turned over the remaining HIM money in his trust account to the federal restitution fund.Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe full panel decided respondent had engaged in misconduct and recommended that respondent: (1) be suspended from the practice of law for nine months; (2) pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings; and (3) be required to take CLE courses regarding the proper use of trust accounts.Â  Respondent raises 18 exceptions to the report.[9]Â  While we agree with respondent that the evidence does not support all the rule violations found in the report,[10] we nonetheless find respondent committed misconduct and impose the recommended sanction.\r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline is given rests entirely with this Court. Â In re McFarland, 360 S.C. 101, 600 S.E.2d 537 (2004); In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).Â  A disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  E.g., In re Chastain, 340 S.C. 356, 532 S.E.2d 264 (2000).Â  This Court is not bound by the sub-panelâ€™s recommendation; instead, after a thorough review of the record, the Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and it must impose the sanction it deems appropriate.Â  In re McFarland, supra; In re Strickland, 354 S.C. 169, 172, 580 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2003); In re Chastain, supra.\r\nIt is clear to us that respondent committed professional misconduct by allowing Cabe and HIM to utilize his trust account with the knowledge that HIMâ€™s American bank accounts had been frozen as part of a federal criminal investigation.Â  This was a serious lapse in professional judgment which amounted to conduct â€œinvolving â€¦ fraudâ€ as well as conduct that was â€œprejudicial to the administration of justice.â€Â  Rules 8.4(d) &amp; (e), of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR; see also Preamble: A Lawyerâ€™s Responsibilities, Rule 407, RPC (â€œA lawyer, being a member of the legal profession, is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.â€).Â  \r\nIn addition to violations of Rules 8.4(d) &amp; (e), RPC, we find that respondent also violated: Â Rule 1.8(a), RPC (conflict of interest, by entering into the business transaction with HIM while representing Cabe and HIM without the clientâ€™s written consent); and Rule 8.4(a), RPC (it is professional misconduct to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nLikewise, we find there clearly are grounds for discipline in this matter.Â  See Rules 7(a)(1) &amp; (5), RLDE (â€œIt shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to: (1) violate â€¦ the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR,â€ and â€œ(5) engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law.â€)Â  \r\nAccordingly, we order that respondent be definitely suspended for nine months and take CLE courses regarding the proper use of trust accounts.Â  In addition, respondent shall pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings. Â Within 15 days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nÂ DEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., conur.\r\n\r\n[1] The federal district court sentenced Cabe to 109 monthsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  Respondent was not criminally charged.\r\n[2] Respondent knew Smith through their work with The Gospel Hour, a legitimate, non-profit evangelical ministry started by respondentâ€™s father, Dr. Oliver Greene.Â  Originally a radio and tent evangelist, Dr. Greeneâ€™s ministry grew quite large, and today it continues to be broadcast on the radio and is even broadcast worldwide via the internet.Â  See http://www.thegospelhour.org/index.html.Â  After his fatherâ€™s death in 1976, respondent took over as executive director for The Gospel Hour.Â  He passed the bar and began practicing law in 1977.\r\n[3] Disciplinary Counsel submitted HIMâ€™s promotional materials which detailed HIMâ€™s â€œunique secured asset high yield programs,â€ and explained â€œdebenture trading programsâ€ as virtually no-risk.Â  Respondent, however, did not see the HIM printed materials prior to his investment with, or representation of, HIM.\r\n[4] Neither Smith nor Palmer was criminally charged in the HISway scheme.\r\n[5] In addition to HIMâ€™s accounts being frozen, respondent also knew that Cabeâ€™s house had been searched pursuant to a federal search warrant.\r\n[6] Since approximately 1991, respondent has been a solo practitioner.\r\n[7] The remaining HISway money from respondentâ€™s trust account, $41,282.50, was contributed by respondent to the federal restitution fund later used to reimburse victims of the scam.\r\n[8] As a plaintiff, Hagins (along with Barnes) brought a civil lawsuit against Cabe, respondent, and others, and eventually the matter was settled by respondentâ€™s malpractice carrier for $60,000.00.\r\n[9] Respondent contends, inter alia, the Panel erroneously:Â  (1) applied a â€œknew or should have knownâ€ standard to the facts, and (2) imputed Cabeâ€™s intent to use respondentâ€™s trust account for illegal purposes to respondent.Â  \r\n[10] Unlike the panel, we do not find respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.2(d), 1.13(d), 1.16(b), and 8.4(b) &amp; (c), of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26233","title":"In the Interest of Johnny Lee W.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26233","description":"This case involves the issue of whether the trial judge erred by accepting conditional guilty pleas.","date":"2006-12-04","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Interest of Johnny Lee W., a minor under the age of seventeen, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal from Sumter County\r\nÂ R. Wright Turbeville, Family Court Judge\r\nÂ George M. McFaddin, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26233\r\nHeard October 5, 2006 - Filed December 4, 2006Â  \r\n\r\nVACATED IN PART AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, of Columbia; and Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  In this appeal, we are asked whether the trial judge erred by accepting appellantâ€™s conditional guilty pleas.Â  We vacate in part and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant was charged with disturbing school and threatening a public official in January 2004.Â  He filed a motion to quash the charge based on the unconstitutionality of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-420 (Supp. 2005), on the grounds it was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.[1]Â  The motion was denied by Judge George McFaddin, Jr.\r\nSubsequently, appellant was charged with disturbing school in September 2004, by hitting two students, and disturbing school on the same date by hitting a third student.[2]Â  Appellant filed a motion to quash these two charges on the same constitutional grounds.\r\nAppellant pled guilty to the three charges of disturbing schools.Â  He entered a plea of no contest to the threatening a public official charge.Â  Finding he was bound by Judge McFaddinâ€™s earlier ruling on the motion to quash, Judge R. Wright Turbeville found that the statute is not unconstitutional.Â  Judge Turbeville adjudicated appellant a delinquent and accepted his pleas and remanded him to Reception and Evaluation for evaluation.\r\nAppellant later appeared before Judge Turbeville for disposition and was sentenced to commitment to the Department of Juvenile Justice for an indeterminate period not to exceed his twenty-first birthday.Â  The sentence was suspended and appellant was placed on probation for one year.\r\nISSUE\r\nAre appellantâ€™s guilty pleas invalid as conditional guilty pleas?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAt the adjudicatory hearing, the following exchange occurred:\r\n\r\n  COUNSEL:Â  . . . What Iâ€™m trying to do here is, in the interest of judicial economy and without putting the State to the task of a trial to prove that we engaged in conduct that would violate the statute if the statute were constitutional, is to simply stipulate to that, but continuing to maintain for and preserve our right to appeal.\r\n  THE COURT:Â  To preserve your right to appeal Judge McFaddinâ€™s ruling.\r\n  COUNSEL:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n  THE COURT:Â  Okay.Â  The constitutionality of those statutes.\r\n  COUNSEL:Â  Thatâ€™s the only thing weâ€™re trying to do today without having to take the courtâ€™s time to hear conduct we essentially admit to, but just say that itâ€™s not illegal.\r\n  THE COURT:Â  You stipulate to the fact that if that statute is constitutional, that his conduct violated it?\r\n  COUNSEL:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Judge Turbeville accepted appellantâ€™s guilty pleas.\r\nAppellant argues the judge erred by accepting his disturbing schools guilty pleas because they were conditioned on his right to appeal the issue of whether the statute proscribing disturbing schools is unconstitutional.Â  The State conceded at oral argument that appellantâ€™s pleas were conditional.[3]\r\nA trial court may not accept a conditional plea.Â  See State v. Truesdale, 278 S.C. 368, 296 S.E.2d 528 (1982) (conditional plea is a practice not recognized in South Carolina and a practice of which this Court expressly disapproves; if an accused attempts to attach any condition or qualification to a plea, the trial court should direct a plea of not guilty).Â  See also State v. Peppers, 346 S.C. 502, 552 S.E.2d 288 (2001) (court could not accept guilty plea where appellant conditioned guilty plea upon right to appeal constitutionality of indictment); State v. Oâ€™Leary, 302 S.C. 17, 393 S.E.2d 186 (1990) (court could not accept guilty plea where appellant conditioned guilty plea upon right to appeal constitutionality of statute).\r\nAccordingly, the trial court erred by accepting the conditional pleas to the charges of disturbing school and those pleas are vacated.Â  Appellant argues that because all of his pleas were entered together and the sentence reflects a combination of the pleas, each of his pleas and sentence should be vacated.Â  However, appellant did not appeal his guilty plea to malicious injury to property, therefore, that plea is unaffected by his entering conditional pleas to the disturbing school charges.Â  Further, appellantâ€™s nolo contendere plea to threatening a public official was not entered as a conditional plea; therefore, it is not vacated.\r\nAlthough there are two valid guilty pleas, appellantâ€™s sentence is vacated because it was a combination sentence for all of the charges against him.Â  On remand, the court may re-sentence appellant on the charges of malicious injury to property and threatening a public official.Â  If appellant chooses to re-plead to the disturbing schools charges without placing conditions on those pleas, then appellant may also be sentenced on those charges at that time, or he may choose to proceed to trial on those charges.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial judge is\r\nVACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n  TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]We recently held in the opinion of In the Interest of Amir X. S., Op. No. 26219 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed November 6, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 42 at 23), that the statute was not unconstitutional.\r\n[2]Appellant was also charged with malicious injury to property.Â  He pled guilty and did not appeal that adjudication. \r\n[3]The State argues, however, that the issue is not preserved for review because appellant did not raise this issue at the later disposition hearing nor did he move to withdraw his pleas.Â  This contention is without merit.Â  See State v. Peppers, 346 S.C. 502, 552 S.E.2d 288 (2001) (conditional plea vacated although appellant had not moved to withdraw the plea); State v. Oâ€™Leary, 302 S.C. 17, 393 S.E.2d 186 (1990) (same). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26234","title":"Morris v.

On July 9, 2002, the scheduled trial date, petitioner arrived at court and signed a sentencing sheet in anticipation of entering a guilty plea to the lesser-included charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN).[1]Â  Petitioner subsequently left the courthouse, and when his case was called, he could not be located.Â  When the State sought to try petitioner in absentia, petitionerâ€™s counsel told the trial court that she â€œwould prefer not to proceed withoutâ€ petitioner present.Â  The trial court ruled that by leaving the courthouse, petitioner had forfeited his rights.[2]Â  Petitionerâ€™s trial in absentia began immediately thereafter.\r\nThe trial concluded the next day, and the jury found petitioner guilty of ABIK.Â  The trial court sentenced him to 20 yearsâ€™ imprisonment, suspended upon the service of 15 years, and five yearsâ€™ probation.[3]Â  Petitioner did not directly appeal, but filed for PCR.Â  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, trial counsel testified that at some point after signing the plea sheet, petitioner left and could not be found when his case was called for the guilty plea.Â  Counsel denied telling petitioner he could leave the courthouse.Â  She further stated she did not realize she had not moved for a continuance after the State requested a trial in absentia.Â  \r\nPetitioner testified that after he signed the plea sheet, he asked counsel if she could get a continuance.Â  According to petitioner, counsel said she would try; after a few minutes in the courtroom, she returned and told him he could go.Â  Petitioner stated that he waited for notification of a sentencing date and did not know his case had been tried until police picked him up on October 22, 2002.Â  \r\nPetitionerâ€™s girlfriend, Jaclyn Cummings, also testified at the PCR hearing.Â  She was with petitioner at the courthouse on the day he signed the plea sheet.Â  Cummings stated she also understood that counsel was going to try to get the â€œpostponement,â€ and therefore, she and petitioner could leave.\r\nThe PCR court denied relief, specifically finding that (1) petitionerâ€™s testimony and the testimony of Cummings were not credible, while trial counselâ€™s testimony was credible; and (2) trial counsel â€œtried to postpone the trial, via a Motion for Continuance, but that Motion was denied.â€Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid petitioner establish that trial counsel was ineffective?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues that counsel should have moved for a continuance.Â  Petitioner further contends he was prejudiced by counselâ€™s omission because he would have received a lesser sentence on the lesser charge of ABHAN.Â  We agree.\r\nThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions in the case. Â Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). Â In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the PCR applicant must show that:Â  (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial would have been different. Â Strickland v. Washington, supra; Rhodes v. State, 349 S.C. 25, 561 S.E.2d 606 (2002).\r\nIn a PCR proceeding, the burden is on the applicant to prove the allegations in his application.Â  E.g., Bannister v. State, 333 S.C. 298, 509 S.E.2d 807 (1998).Â  This Court will uphold the findings of the PCR court if there is any evidence of probative value to support them but will reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision when it is controlled by an error of law. Â Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000); Cherry v. State, supra.\r\nInitially, we note there is no evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that counsel tried to postpone the trial by moving for a continuance and therefore cannot uphold that finding.Â  Cherry v. State, supra.Â  While the trial transcript clearly shows counsel objected to proceeding with a trial in absentia, this is markedly different from counsel making a motion for a continuance so petitioner could plead guilty to ABHAN as had been agreed upon between petitioner and the State.Â  Consequently, we find counsel was deficient for failing to request a continuance.\r\nThe State contends, however, that petitioner cannot establish prejudice because the trial court was disinclined to grant a continuance since petitioner had left the courthouse.Â  The State further maintains that because reversals of the denial of a continuance are â€œabout as rare as the proverbial hensâ€™ teeth,â€ petitioner failed to meet the prejudice prong.Â  State v. Lytchfield, 230 S.C. 405, 409, 95 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1957).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s refusal of a motion for continuance in a criminal case will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice to the appellant.Â  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 459, 469 S.E.2d 49, 51 (1996); Lytchfield, supra.Â  Here, it is clear petitioner would have been prejudiced by the denial of a continuance because the trial in absentia subjected him to the ABIK conviction whereas the guilty plea would have been to ABHAN.Â  The difference between these two crimes is significant.Â  ABHAN is a common law misdemeanor punishable by up to ten years in prison, while ABIK is a violent crime felony punishable by up to twenty years in prison. Â See State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 274-75, 531 S.E.2d 512, 516 (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-1-60, 16-3-620 (2003). Â Given the drastic distinctions between a conviction of ABIK versus one of ABHAN, we find this is the rare case where the refusal of the continuance would have amounted to an abuse of discretion.Â  See State v. Williams, supra; Lytchfield, supra.Â  Thus, we find petitioner established prejudice from counselâ€™s deficient performance.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold counsel did not move for a continuance and that the failure to do so prejudiced petitioner.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s denial of relief and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] In addition, both the solicitor and petitionerâ€™s counsel signed the guilty plea sheet.\r\n[2] The trial court noted for the record petitionerâ€™s exception to its ruling.Â  \r\n[3] The sealed sentence was opened on October 22, 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26235","title":"Armstrong v.

Andrew Williams, and R. Hawthorne Barrett, of Turner, Padget, Graham, &amp; Laney, P.A., of Columbia; and Paul D. Harrill, of McNair Law Firm, P.A., of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Petitioners, who are mother and son, filed suit against respondent (Food Lion), alleging causes of action for assault, battery, outrage, premises liability, negligence, and negligence per se.Â  The trial court granted Food Lionâ€™s motion for a directed verdict as to most of petitionersâ€™ claims.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Food Lion as to the negligence claim.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR.Â  Armstrong v. Food Lion, Inc., Op. No. 2004-UP-366 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 10, 2004).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner Ronnie Armstrong (Ronnie) went to the Winnsboro Food Lion store on December 14, 1998, to purchase groceries with his sister and his mother Tillie Armstrong (Tillie).Â  As Ronnie walked up the aisle of the store, three men in Food Lion uniforms approached him.Â  Ronnie stated that Byron Brown approached and said â€œWhatâ€™s up?,â€ and Ronnie replied, â€œNothing.â€Â  Ronnie testified that Brown then attacked him with a box cutter.Â  Brown cut Ronnie in the face and neck and a second employee, Marcus Cameron, also began attacking him after he fell on the floor.Â  Cameron cut him with another box cutter on his back.\r\nWhen Ronnieâ€™s mother, Tillie, came to his aid, Cameron punched her in the chest and knocked her to the floor.Â  A witness, Justin Loner, helped Tillie up and pulled Cameron off of Ronnie.Â  Brown then backed off, and Loner called EMS.Â  Ronnie testified that, â€œI donâ€™t know why they cut me.Â  They just attacked me for no reason.Â  I said nothing to provoke anyone.â€Â  On cross-examination, Ronnie stated he had a confrontation with Brown two years prior to the incident, and Brown had threatened to kill him.Â  \r\nLoner testified that, when he first entered Food Lion, he saw three employees at the front of the store â€œgoofing offâ€ and not working.Â  Two of those employees were Brown and Cameron.Â  He stated that, after Ronnie and the employees approached each other, he saw one employee hit Ronnie causing him to bleed.\r\nThe store manager testified regarding the Food Lion employee manual.Â  He read from the manual under the heading â€œCase Cutters.â€Â  The manual stated:Â  â€œBe extremely careful when using case cutters.Â  Case cutters represent one of the major causes of accidents in the supermarket.â€\r\nFollowing the presentation of petitionersâ€™ case, Food Lion moved for a directed verdict, arguing petitioners had failed to present evidence that Brown and Cameron were acting within the scope of their employment at the time of the assault.Â  During petitionersâ€™ argument in response, counsel admitted Brown and Cameron â€œwere goofing off at the time.â€Â  The trial court granted a directed verdict in Food Lionâ€™s favor as to petitionersâ€™ causes of action for assault, assault and battery, and outrage[1] based on petitionersâ€™ failure to show the assault was committed for the purpose of, or in some way furthering, Food Lionâ€™s business.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by finding the trial court properly directed a verdict in Food Lionâ€™s favor on petitionersâ€™ cause of action alleging Food Lion was vicariously liable for the torts committed by its employees?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999). Â If the evidence as a whole is susceptible of more than one reasonable inference, a jury issue is created and the motion should have been denied.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 585 S.E.2d 281 (2003).Â  This Court will reverse only where there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling, or where the ruling was controlled by an error of law.Â  Steinke, supra.\r\nPetitioners contend Food Lion is legally responsible to them for the acts of its employees, Brown and Cameron.Â  The doctrine of respondeat superior rests upon the relation of master and servant.Â  Lane v. Modern Music, Inc., 244 S.C. 299, 136 S.E.2d 713 (1964).Â  A plaintiff seeking recovery from the master for injuries must establish\r\nthat the relationship existed at the time of the injuries, and also that the servant was then about his masterâ€™s business and acting within the scope of his employment.Â  Id.Â  An act is within the scope of a servantâ€™s employment where reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of his employment and in furtherance of the masterâ€™s business.Â  Id.Â  These general principles govern in determining whether an employer is liable for the acts of his servant.Â  Id.\r\nThe act of a servant done to effect some independent purpose of his own and not with reference to the service in which he is employed, or while he is acting as his own master for the time being, is not within the scope of his employment so as to render the master liable therefor.Â  Lane, supra.Â  Under these circumstances the servant alone is liable for the injuries inflicted.Â  Id.Â  If a servant steps aside from the masterâ€™s business for some purpose wholly disconnected with his employment, the relation of master and servant is temporarily suspended; this is so no matter how short the time, and the master is not liable for his acts during such time.Â  Id.\r\nThe trial court appropriately granted a directed verdict because petitioners failed to produce any evidence that the Food Lion employees were acting within the scope of their employment or in furtherance of Food Lionâ€™s business when they attacked petitioners.Â  The only reasonable inference from the testimony is that Brown and Cameron attacked Ronnie for their own personal reasons and not for any reason related to their employment.[2]Â  They were acting â€œto effect an independent purpose of their own.â€Â  See Lane, supra (act of servant done to effect some independent purpose of his own is not within scope of his employment).Â  Food Lion was not legally liable because the employees stepped away from their job of stocking shelves.Â  See Lane, supra (employer not liable where employee stepped away from the employerâ€™s business to play a prank); Hamilton v. Davis, 300 S.C. 411, 389 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 1990) (same).\r\nTwo cases that have previously found an employer liable for its employeeâ€™s assault of another person are distinguishable from the instant case.Â  In Crittenden v. Thompson-Walker Co., Inc., 288 S.C. 112, 341 S.E.2d 385 (Ct. App. 1986), an employee assaulted another person in an attempt to collect a debt of the business.Â  In Jones v. Elbert, 211 S.C. 553, 34 S.E.2d 796 (1945), a dairy farmâ€™s general manager assaulted the owner of a company contracted to provide a refrigerating system.Â  The assault resulted from a dispute arising over problems with the system.Â  The factor that distinguishes these cases from the instant case is that the assaults in Jones and Crittenden occurred, not merely in connection with the masterâ€™s business, but with the purpose of in some way furthering the masterâ€™s business.Â  Here, there is no evidence that Brown and Cameron were furthering Food Lionâ€™s business in any manner.[3]Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly granted Food Lionâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  Therefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]The causes of action for negligence per se and premises liability were also dismissed.Â  \r\n[2]Petitioners argue that, because the reason for the attack is not gleaned from the testimony, we should look at the evidence in the light most favorable to them and essentially find the attack occurred for a work-related reason and send the case to the jury.Â  However, this argument ignores the fact that petitioners have the burden of proving the employees were about Food Lionâ€™s business and acting within the scope of their employment at the time of the attack.Â  Petitioners failed to meet this burden.\r\n[3]Petitioners argue the evidence was sufficient to establish a presumption that the employees were acting within the scope of their employment because Food Lion had furnished the instrumentalities used in the attack.Â  Where one is found in possession of anotherâ€™s property, apparently using it in the business of such other, he is presumed to be the agent or servant of the owner and acting within the course of his employment.Â  See Falconer v. Beard-Laney, Inc., 215 S.C. 321, 54 S.E.2d 904 (1949).Â  However, petitioners failed to show that the employees were using the box cutters in Food Lionâ€™s business.Â  Therefore, petitioners are not entitled to any such presumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26236","title":"In the Matter of Kenneth L.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nKenneth L. Edwards, of Hollywood, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to imposition of any sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for eighteen months.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1986, respondent and his wife were divorced in North Carolina.Â  The order included a requirement that respondent pay $300.00 per month in child support.Â  Respondent did not appeal the North Carolina order.Â  \r\nIn 1987, respondent filed a separate action for divorce in South Carolina.Â  In the South Carolina proceedings, respondent obtained an order that provided for $200.00 per month in child support.Â  \r\nAt the time the North Carolina and South Carolina orders were issued, respondent was not an attorney.Â  Even after becoming an attorney, respondent did not fully comply with either the North Carolina or South Carolina support orders, although he did make some payments pursuant to the South Carolina order.[1]\r\nIn 2001, the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) filed an action to register and enforce the North Carolina order.[2]Â  The action alleged respondent was in arrears in excess of $94,000.00.Â  Respondent responded to the DSS action by challenging the validity of the North Carolina order.Â  The judge held the North Carolina order was valid and ordered respondent to make payments.Â  The decision was upheld on appeal.Â  Only then did respondent begin to make payments pursuant to the North Carolina order.Â  \r\nIn 2004, at the time respondentâ€™s appeal in the DSS action was pending, respondent sued his ex-wife in the Court of Common Pleas in South Carolina, contesting the validity of the North Carolina order and requesting termination of child support.Â  The action was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \r\nIn 2004, respondent also filed a motion to terminate child support on the grounds of his sonâ€™s emancipation.Â  Respondent attached an affidavit and itemized list to his motion to terminate stating he had already paid, directly and indirectly, over $30,000.00 in support.Â  The itemized list of payments contained a statement that respondent had paid over $14,000.00 in tuition payments to a military school for respondentâ€™s son.Â  Although respondent had paid the tuition, the son did not attend the school and respondent obtained a full refund.Â  Respondent was refunded the money more than three years prior to his submission of the affidavit to the court.Â  Respondent did not inform the court that he had received a full refund of the tuition.Â  Respondent admits the judge relied on his affidavit and the itemized list when she considered his motion to terminate his support obligation.Â  \r\nIn respondentâ€™s motion for termination, respondent used the case caption from his 1987 South Carolina divorce action rather than the case caption for the pending DSS support enforcement action.Â  Respondent served his ex-wife, but not DSS, even though he knew that DSS was assigned the rights to his child support.Â  When the ex-wife did not appear at the hearing on respondentâ€™s motion to terminate payments, respondent handed up a proposed order which the judge signed.Â  The order indicated that respondent had paid his child support pursuant to the South Carolina order and terminated support.Â  Respondent did not inform the judge of the North Carolina support order, the pending DSS enforcement action and appeal, or the alleged arrearage to the judge.Â  When the judge learned of the DSS action, she vacated the termination order she had signed for respondent.Â  Â \r\nOn December 6, 2004, respondent filed a civil action against his ex-wife alleging, among other things, malicious prosecution and â€œmisuse of legal procedure.â€Â  He included a cause of action based, in part, on an ethical grievance his ex-wife had filed against him in 1995.Â  The rules in effect at the time the grievance was filed prohibited lawyers from disclosing disciplinary matters.Â  Respondent neither sought nor obtained permission from this Court to reveal information regarding his ex-wifeâ€™s grievance. Â In addition, respondentâ€™s claims of malicious prosecution and â€œmisuse of legal procedureâ€ based on the grievance were without merit and in violation of Rule 13, RLDE (formerly Rule 26 of the Rule on Disciplinary Procedure) which provided immunity to complainants in disciplinary matters.Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 3.1 (lawyer shall not bring, assert, or controvert an issue in a proceeding unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous); Rule 3.3 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting in a fraudulent act); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and\r\nRule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nÂ In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(7) (lawyer shall not willfully violate a valid court order issued by a court of this state or of another jurisdiction).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for eighteen months.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was admitted to the South Carolina Bar on June 1, 1992.Â  \r\n[2] By that time, the order had been registered in Michigan, the ex-wifeâ€™s new place of residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26237","title":"In the Matter of Benjamin R.

Â Respondent further agrees to pay the costs associated with ODCâ€™s investigation into this matter. Â We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall fully reimburse ODC for its costs associated with its investigation into this matter.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent represented Buyer in a real estate closing.Â  Seller, who lived out of state, was represented by another attorney for the purposes of deed preparation.Â  Sellerâ€™s attorney was to have the deed executed and delivered to respondentâ€™s non-lawyer assistant for recording at the courthouse after closing.\r\nPrior to the closing, Sellerâ€™s attorney faxed respondent the signed deed which listed Buyer and his wife â€œas joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in commonâ€ (Deed #1).Â  This was in accordance with the instructions Sellerâ€™s attorney received from the broker.Â  Upon review of Deed #1 and at the request of Buyer and his wife, respondent contacted Sellerâ€™s attorney prior to closing and asked that the grantee be changed to Buyer only.Â  The Sellerâ€™s attorney then faxed a revised but unsigned deed for respondentâ€™s review (Deed #2).Â Â  \r\nSellerâ€™s attorney did not hear back from respondent regarding her fax.Â  Accordingly, Deed #2 was not executed.Â  Instead, Sellerâ€™s attorney delivered Deed #1 to the courthouse as planned.Â  Deed #1 was recorded on September 21, 2004.\r\nAt some time prior to recordation, Deed #1 was altered to strike out Buyerâ€™s wifeâ€™s name, but not the tenancy clause.Â  It is unknown who altered Deed #1; however, there is no evidence that it was done by respondent or Sellerâ€™s attorney or at their direction.Â  Apparently, it was altered by a staff person attempting to comply with Buyerâ€™s request to have the property titled in his name alone. \r\nWhen Buyer received the recorded deed, he compared it to the copy he had been given by respondentâ€™s staff at closing.Â  Apparently, Buyer had been given the first page of the correctly worded deed faxed to respondent prior to closing (Deed #2) with the tenancy clause whited out so as to make it appear that Buyer was the sole grantee.Â  Although the alteration of the copy provided to Buyer was not done by respondent or at his direction, respondent admits that it was done by a non-lawyer subject to his supervision.\r\nRespondent acknowledges that by accepting more legal work than he and his staff could competently and diligently handle, he created an atmosphere in which his non-lawyer staff believed it was appropriate to attempt to resolve problems, such as the problem with Buyerâ€™s deed, without his assistance or review.Â Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nOn June 23, 2004, respondent conducted a real estate closing.Â  As of June 27, 2005, respondent had not provided the lender with the closing documents, including the recorded mortgage, the final title opinion, and the final title opinion.Â  Respondent failed to respond to repeated letters and telephone calls from the lender and its attorney inquiring into the status of the closing documents.Â  It was not until October 2005, after this grievance was filed, that respondent sent the documents to the lender.Â  Although the mortgage had been timely filed, the delay resulted in respondentâ€™s untimely issuance of final title opinions and policies.Â  \r\nRespondent admits that, at times, he was more than two years behind in issuing some final title opinions and policies.Â  The backlog involved as many as 700 files and more than $40,000 in premiums.Â  \r\nRespondent has now left private practice.Â  Before closing out his books, he hired staff to assist him in preparation and issuance of all outstanding title insurance opinions and policies.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent delegated the responsibility of reconciling his trust accounts to a non-lawyer assistant without providing proper training or supervision.Â  Although the accounts were reconciled every month, the non-lawyer assistant was not given appropriate instruction about how to recognize potential errors requiring respondentâ€™s attention.Â  As a result, for more than seven (7) months respondent was not made aware of three significant deposit errors in October, November, and December 2004.Â  In each of these months, incoming funds were deposited into the wrong account.Â  Disbursements were made from the correct account, causing the balance in that account to drop below the amounts respondent should have maintained for other pending matters.Â  Because the account contained a substantial balance of unpaid title insurance premiums, no checks were returned.\r\nWhen respondent discovered the errors, he transferred the deposited funds into the correct account.Â  Although no client or third party suffered any loss, respondent acknowledges that he created significant risk of loss to others by failing to adequately manage his trust account.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safe keep client funds and property); and Rule 5.3 (lawyer having authority over non-lawyer assistant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure personâ€™s conduct is compatible with professional obligations).Â  Respondent further admits his conduct violated the recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall fully reimburse ODC for its costs associated with its investigation into this matter.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this case, the trial court denied Appellant Martha Bandaâ€™s pre-trial motions to suppress evidence and an incriminating statement she gave to police.Â  The trial court subsequently convicted Banda for trafficking in ten grams or more of methamphetamine and sentenced her to four years imprisonment.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn February 2003, Banda, a citizen of Zimbabwe,[1] was a passenger in a car stopped by the City of Greenville (Greenville) police for having stolen Georgia license tags.Â  Earlier that evening, Greenville narcotics officers Detective Mark White (White) and Detective Melissa Lawson (Lawson) were staking out a house that a confidential informant had told them was the residence of a female drug target dealing methamphetamines, and for whom the officers had an arrest warrant.Â  The confidential informant had arranged to purchase an â€œ8-ball of methâ€ at the targetâ€™s house.Â  The informant further told police that the drugs came from a supplier in Georgia.Â  \r\nDuring the stakeout, the narcotics officers observed a car with Georgia license tags pull into the driveway of the targetâ€™s residence and leave thirty to forty minutes later.Â  Although Whiteâ€™s testimony indicates that at this point, the officers were aware of the possibility that the deal between the confidential informant and the target had been called off, they followed the car assuming that the occupants might be going to meet with the informant anyway.Â  As the officers continued to follow the vehicle, they realized there were two occupants:Â  a male driver and a female passenger.Â  White and Lawson testified that at this point, they assumed the female passenger to be their target.Â  After learning from dispatch that the Georgia tags had been reported stolen, White and Lawson had another uniformed Greenville police officer assist them in stopping the car once it entered the city limits.Â  Detective Conroy (Conroy), another narcotics officer assisting in the investigation of the target, also came to the scene.Â  \r\nUpon stopping the car, the officers requested that both the driver and passenger step out of the car.Â  Conroy and the uniformed officer attended to the driver and subsequently handcuffed and arrested him for driving with a stolen license plate.Â  Meanwhile, White and Lawson approached Banda on the passenger side.Â  Although the officers immediately realized Banda was not their target when she stepped out of the car, they proceeded to question her at the scene anyway. \r\nDetective White had his gun drawn and pointed at Banda as Lawson asked her if she had any weapons.[2]Â  Banda responded she did not, but Lawson explained to Banda she was going to do a routine pat down for Lawsonâ€™s own safety.Â  During the pat down, Lawson felt an object in Bandaâ€™s upper right hand coat pocket.Â  When Lawson asked Banda what it was, Banda explained that it was her ace bandage.Â  At the same time, Banda pulled a â€œloosely rolled upâ€ bandage out of the pocket and handed it to Lawson.Â  Lawson squeezed the bandage and felt plastic on the inside. She looked at Banda who â€œdropped her headâ€ and told Lawson it was an ounce of â€œice.â€Â  Lawson read Banda her Miranda rights at the scene and after a further search of the vehicle, the officers took Banda back to the station where they read her Miranda rights for a second time.Â  After waiving her Miranda rights, Banda gave the officers a written statement.Â  \r\nBanda made a pre-trial motion to suppress the drugs found by Lawson on the grounds that Lawsonâ€™s stop and frisk was an unreasonable search and seizure.Â  After an in camera suppression hearing in which the trial court heard testimony from Banda and Detectives White and Lawson, the court denied Bandaâ€™s motion to suppress the drugs.Â  The trial court found the police had probable cause to stop the car for the stolen tags; they had the authority to request Banda to get out of the car; and that Banda was properly frisked for weapons given the officersâ€™ reasonable suspicion of her involvement in the delivery of drugs. \r\nBanda then made a second pre-trial motion to suppress her written statement made to the police after her arrest.Â  Banda argued she had not been informed of her right to contact Zimbabweâ€™s consular official as required by international treaty.Â  The State did not deny this allegation.Â  \r\nThe trial court found that even assuming the Greenville officers had violated the treaty, this violation did not provide adequate legal grounds to consider applying the exclusionary rule to Bandaâ€™s statement.Â  For this reason, the trial court refused to grant Banda a suppression hearing on the admissibility of her statement and denied her motion to suppress the statement.Â  The trial court subsequently sentenced Banda to four years imprisonment.Â  \r\nThis case was certified to this Court from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  Banda raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the trial court err in refusing to suppress the drugs found on Banda during a frisk for weapons pursuant to an automobile stop for a traffic violation?Â Â \r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n       Did the trial court err in refusing to grant a suppression hearing for Bandaâ€™s written statement to police when police failed to notify the foreign consulate of Bandaâ€™s arrest prior to interrogating her?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review \r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  Therefore, an appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  The same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  Our review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding.Â  State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 389, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500 (2003).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Suppression of Drugs\r\nBanda argues that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the drugs found in her coat during the automobile stop.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees â€œthe right of the people to be secure\r\nin their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€Â  U.S. Const., amend. IV.Â  Temporary detention of individuals by the police during an automobile stop constitutes a â€œseizureâ€ of an individual within the&nbsp;meaning of the Fourth Amendment.Â \r\nDelaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653 (1979).Â  Therefore, an automobile stop implicates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, imposing a standard of â€œreasonablenessâ€ upon the exercise of discretion by state law enforcement officials.Â  See id. at 654.Â  The decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.Â  Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 809-810 (1996).Â  Notwithstanding multiple exceptions, evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is inadmissible in a state court.Â  Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961). \r\nIn this case, it is undisputed that Greenville police acted lawfully in stopping the car in which Banda was a passenger.Â  The car displayed a stolen license tag, and the stop occurred within the Greenville city limits, which was within Greenville police jurisdiction.[3]Â  Additionally, both parties acknowledge that the Greenville police were entitled to order Banda out of the car.Â  See Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U.S. 408, 415 (1997) (holding that a police officer may order both the driver and passenger out of the vehicle pursuant to a valid automobile stop without violating the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable seizures).Â  However, Banda argues that Detective Lawson did not have reasonable suspicion to search her for weapons.Â  For this reason, Banda contends the drugs recovered during the pat down should be suppressed.\r\nBalancing the potential intrusion on an individualâ€™s Fourth Amendment rights with the need for law enforcement officers to protect themselves and other prospective victims of violence, the United States Supreme Court held in Terry v. Ohio that a police officer must have a reasonable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous before conducting a pat down or frisk of that person.Â  392 U.S. 1, 24 (1968).Â  â€œReasonable suspicionâ€ of weapons requires that a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others is in danger.Â  Id. at 27; Butler, 353 S.C. at 390, 577 S.E.2d at 501. Â The Supreme Court extended the Terry doctrine to frisks pursuant to valid automobile stops for traffic violations in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 111-112 (1977).Â  \r\nWe hold that under the circumstances of this case, Lawson had reasonable suspicion to frisk Banda for weapons pursuant to a valid automobile stop.Â  This Court has recognized that because of the â€œindisputable nexus between drugs and guns,â€ where an officer has reasonable suspicion that drugs are present in a vehicle[4] lawfully stopped, there is an appropriate level of suspicion of criminal activity and apprehension of danger to justify a frisk of both the driver and the passenger in the absence of other factors alleviating the officerâ€™s safety concerns.Â \r\nButler, 353 S.C. at 391 (quoting U.S. v. Sakyi, 160 F.3d 164, 169-170 (4th Cir. 1998)).Â  In this situation, the police clearly had reasonable suspicion to suspect that drugs were present in the vehicle.Â  The police had observed the car leave the residence of a known drug dealer.Â  Furthermore, the car displayed stolen Georgia license tags and the police knew from their confidential informant that the targetâ€™s drug shipments came from Georgia.Â  Even though the police shortly realized that Banda was not their target, the fact that the activity observed at the targetâ€™s house corroborated the informantâ€™s statements was enough to give the officers a reasonable suspicion that Banda was in some way involved with the targetâ€™s drug activity and that drugs might therefore be in the vehicle.Â  See Cortez, 449 U.S. at 417.Â  Given the frequent association between drugs and guns, Lawsonâ€™s safety concerns were justified based on the vehicleâ€™s apparent connection to a known drug dealer.Â  \r\nBanda compares her case to State v. Butler where this Court granted the defendantâ€™s motion to suppress drugs found in a frisk while he was a passenger in a vehicle stopped for having no taillights.Â  353 S.C. at 385, 577 S.E.2d at 499.Â  We find, however, that Butler\r\nis distinguished given that the frisk in that case occurred as a part of the officerâ€™s continuing investigation of a possible open-container violation.Â \r\nId. at 392; 577 S.E.2d at 503.Â  The Greenville police had what the officer in Butler\r\ndid not; that is, a reasonable suspicion that the suspect was armed and dangerous.Â  Their reasonable suspicion arose directly from the presumption of weapons when there is reasonable suspicion that drugs are present.Â  See id. at 391; 577 S.E.2d at 502.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court properly determined the officerâ€™s frisk for weapons was appropriate under Terry v. Ohio and did not violate the Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Suppression of Appellantâ€™s Statement\r\nBanda argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a Jackson v. Denno[5] hearing on the admissibility of her statement to the police because the statement was taken in violation of an international treaty. Â This is an incorrect statement of the issue.Â  \r\nAt trial, Banda moved for an in camera suppression hearing for her statement to police on the grounds that police obtained the statement in violation of an international treaty.Â  The motion, as Banda presented it, did not involve a determination of the voluntariness of the statement:Â  Banda neither specifically requested a Jackson v. Denno hearing, nor did she otherwise support the motion with facts showing that the statement was involuntary.[6]Â  Bandaâ€™s claim that the trial court erred by refusing to grant her a Jackson v. Denno hearing is therefore not properly before the Court on appeal because the grounds now asserted are not supported by the motion made at trial.Â  See State v. Silver, 314 S.C. 483, 487, 431 S.E.2d 250, 252 (1993) (holding that the court of appeals improperly treated the trial courtâ€™s denial of an in camera hearing on the issue of whether defendant was in custody and entitled to Miranda warnings as the denial of a Jackson v. Denno hearing on the voluntariness of defendantâ€™s statement).\r\nA more accurate statement of the issue preserved to this Court is whether the trial court erred by refusing to grant Banda an in camera suppression hearing on the admissibility of her statement to police based upon a violation of a bilateral consular convention between the United States and the United Kingdom[7] (the U.K. Convention) requiring consular notification when foreign nationals are detained.Â  \r\nThis is not the first time that South Carolina courts have analyzed the effects of international treaties on South Carolina law.Â  In State v. Lopez, the court of appeals addressed the consular notification provision in Article 36 of the Vienna Convention.[8]Â  352 S.C. 373, 574 S.E.2d 210 (2002).Â  In Lopez, the trial court denied the defendantâ€™s motion to withdraw his guilty plea where the State did not inform him of his consular notification rights under Article 36.Â  The defendant claimed that had he known of his rights, he would have obtained the services of a translator from the Mexican Consulate to assist him during his guilty plea hearing.Â  Although the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that treaties to which the United States is a party take precedence over any state law, the court of appeals noted that the rights created in international treaties did not create rights equivalent to constitutional rights.Â \r\nId. at 381, 574 S.E.2d at 214.Â  Therefore, the defendant had to establish prejudice to prevail on his claim.Â  Id.Â  On these principles, the court of appeals affirmed the circuit court, observing that because the defendant had rejected the trial judgeâ€™s offers to provide him a translator, any prejudice suffered by the defendant from his failure to have a translatorâ€™s assistance during the guilty plea hearing resulted from his own actions.Â  Id. at 383, 574 S.E.2d at 215.\r\nRecently, the United States Supreme Court addressed Article 36 of the Vienna Convention and its role in state judicial proceedings with respect to triggering the exclusionary rule.Â  In Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S. ____, 126 S.Ct. 2669 (2006), the court held that suppression of evidence was not an appropriate remedy for violations of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention for a number of reasons.Â  First, the court observed that the Vienna Convention did not mandate suppression or any other remedy for its violations, but rather left Article 36â€™s implementation to domestic law.Â  548 U.S. at ___, 126 S.Ct. at 2678 (quoting Art. 36(2), 21 U.S.T. at 101).Â  Furthermore, the court declared that it did not hold a supervisory authority over state courts that would permit it to develop remedies for the enforcement of federal law in state court criminal proceedings.Â  Id. at ___; 126 S.Ct. at 2679.Â  Without this power, the court reasoned that it could not direct the state courts to apply the exclusionary rule unless required to do so by the Vienna Convention itself (pursuant to the Supremacy Clause).Â  Lastly, the court stated that even if Article 36 implicitly required some judicial remedy for its violation (as Sanchez-Llamas claimed), the exclusionary rule would not be appropriate.Â  The court noted that the exclusionary ruleâ€™s primary function was to deter constitutional violations.Â  Article 36, in contrast, only secured the right to inform the foreign consulate of an arrest or detention; it did not guarantee any sort of consulate intervention or termination of investigation pending notice to or intervention by the consulate.Â Â \r\nId. at ___, 126 S.Ct. at 2681.Â  With respect to interrogations, the court specifically stated that there was likely to be little connection between an Article 36 violation and statements obtained by police.Â Â  Id.Â  Suppression, it concluded, â€œwould be a vastly disproportionate remedy for an Article 36 violation.â€Â  Id.\r\nTurning to the instant case, we hold that the trial judge properly refused to grant Banda a suppression hearing on the admissibility of her statements to police.Â  Whenever evidence is introduced that was allegedly obtained by conduct violative of the defendantâ€™s constitutional rights, the defendant is entitled to have the trial judge conduct an evidentiary hearing out of the presence of the jury to establish the circumstances under which the evidence was seized.Â Â  State v. Patton, 322 S.C. 408, 411, 472 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1996) (citing Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368). To be entitled to a suppression hearing, a defendant must articulate specific factual and legal grounds to support his claim that evidence was obtained by conduct violative of his constitutional rights.Â \r\nId. at 411-412, 472 S.E.2d at 247.Â  In making this determination, the trial court shall take into account the totality of the circumstances and may eliminate those issues not raising a question of constitutionality while confining the hearing to those which have arguable merit.Â \r\nId. at 412, 472 S.E.2d at 247.Â  \r\nBandaâ€™s only factual ground for her motion - correctly stated - is that police violated the U.K. Convention by not informing her of her right to notify Zimbabweâ€™s foreign consulate. Â Federal and state case law indicate this does not provide a valid legal ground on which to base her suppression claim.Â  Because the Vienna Conventionâ€™s consular notification provision is nearly the same as that in the U.K. Convention, the legal analyses in Lopez and Sanchez-Llamas apply equally to Article 16 of the U.K. Convention.[9]Â  Like the Vienna Convention, the U.K. Convention does not mandate suppression or any other remedy for its violations.[10]Â Â  Additionally, because international treaties do not create rights equivalent to constitutional rights, Lopez, 352 S.C. at 381, 574 S.E.2d at 214, the violation of the consular notification provision does not, on its own, justify applying the exclusionary rule as a remedy.Â  See Sanchez-Llamas, 548 U.S. at ___, 126 S.Ct. 2669.Â  Because the U.K. Convention only secures the right to inform the foreign consulate of a detention - and not the right to consular intervention - the violation of the U.K. Conventionâ€™s consular notification provision would have little connection with a defendantâ€™s statement to police.[11]Â  See id. at ___, 126 S.Ct. at 2681.Â  \r\nWith no other legal grounds in support of her motion to suppress her statement, applying the exclusionary rule to remedy the treaty violation would be â€œvastly disproportionateâ€ to any wrong suffered by Banda.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Banda a suppression hearing on the admissibility of her statement to police. \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Banda came to the United States on a basketball scholarship.Â  She first attended a university in Oklahoma and later transferred to the University of South Carolina.Â  \r\n[2] Detective White testified that it is routine police department practice to have guns drawn for car stops related to narcotics investigations.Â Â  Because the officers initially believed that Banda was their target, they adhered to this practice in approaching Banda during the stop.\r\n[3] We note that â€œ[s]ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.â€Â  Whren, 517 U.S. at 814.Â  Evidence that the Greenville officers were more interested in apprehending the drug target does not factor into a probable cause analysis in the otherwise valid stop of a vehicle for stolen license tags.\r\n[4] â€œReasonable suspicionâ€ in this context requires an officer to have â€œa particularized and objective basis,â€ based on the totality of the circumstances, that would lead one to suspect that drugs are present in the vehicle lawfully stopped.Â \r\nU.S. v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981); State v. Lesley, 326 S.C. 641, 644, 486 S.E.2d 276, 277 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n[5] Jackson v. Denno held that a defendant in a criminal case was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of statements made by the defendant prior to submission of such statements to a jury.Â  378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n[6] Banda did not dispute the validity of the Miranda warnings or her signed waiver.Â  Moreover, the State pointed out that Banda was college-educated and was not intoxicated that evening.Â  \r\n[7] Banda based her motion to suppress the statement to police on the alleged violation of a consular notification provision in Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, April 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, T.I.A.S. No. 6820 [hereinafter Vienna Convention].Â  This contention is incorrect.Â  Domestic law enforcementâ€™s obligation to notify Zimbabweâ€™s foreign consulate does not come under the Vienna Convention, but rather, falls under Article 16 of a bilateral consular convention between the United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland [no long-title in original], U.S.-U.K., June 6, 1951, 3 U.S.T. 3426, T.I.A.S. No. 2494 [hereinafter U.K. Convention].Â  See also U.S. Department of State, Information for Americans abroad, Consular Notification and Access, Part5:Â  Legal Material, http://travel.state.gov/law/consular /consular_ 744.html.\r\n[8] Art. 36(1)(b), 21 U.S.T. at 101.Â  \r\n[9] Article 16 of the U.K. Convention reads in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) A consular officer shall be informed immediately by the appropriate authorities of the territory when any national of the sending state is confined&nbsp;in prison awaiting trial or is otherwise detained in custody within his district. A consular officer shall be permitted to visit without delay, to converse privately with and to arrange legal representation for, any national of the sending state who is so confined or detained. . . .\r\n\r\nArt. 16(1), 3 U.S.T. 3426.\r\n\r\nArticle 36 of the Vienna Convention reads in relevant part:\r\n(b) if he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if, within its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner. . . . The said authorities shall inform the person concerned without delay of his rights under this sub-paragraph; . . . .\r\n\r\nArt. 36(1)(b), 21 U.S.T. at 101.Â  \r\n[10] The U.K. Convention does not have a provision analogous to Article 36(2) of the Vienna Convention which specifically leaves implementation of rights in the Vienna Convention to state law.Â  At the same time, it has no provisions that suggest it should be implemented otherwise.Â  See 21 U.S.T. 3426.\r\n[11] Interestingly, the Sanchez-Llamas opinion made a brief mention of other ways to vindicate a defendantâ€™s Vienna Convention rights, including raising an Article 36 claim â€œas part of a broader challenge to the voluntariness of his statements to police.â€Â \r\nId. at 2682.Â Â  We interpret this suggestion as indicating that a defendant may successfully move for a Jackson v. Denno hearing to suppress a statement by asserting a violation of the consular notification provisions of a treaty, along with other factors indicating the involuntariness of a statement (such as the failure to receive Miranda rights).Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26240","title":"Colleton County Taxpayers Association v.

Code Ann. Â§Â§ 11-35-10 to -5270 (Supp. 2005), and that the scheme constituted a â€œfinancing agreementâ€ which would impact the amount of the School Districtâ€™s outstanding general obligation debt.[4]Â  The Plaintiffs contemporaneously requested a temporary restraining order to stop the School District from issuing general obligation bonds to raise cash for its first installment payment.Â  The circuit court heard this motion the same day the Plaintiffs filed the complaint and denied the request the following day.\r\nAt the Defendantsâ€™ request, this Court removed this case from the circuit court and agreed to hear the matter in the Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction.Â  Following the grant of original jurisdiction, this Court accepted additional pleadings regarding summary judgment as well as an amended complaint and a supplemental answer.Â  Accordingly, all issues before the Court involve competing requests for declaratory judgments raised either by the unresolved motion for summary judgment or the amended complaint and answer.[5]\r\nThe parties present the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;\r\n       Do the resolution and its attendant agreements constitute a â€œfinancing agreement,â€ and if so, has the School District exceeded its allowable amount of outstanding general obligation debt?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;\r\n       Do the resolution and its attendant agreements violate the terms of two prior referenda?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.&nbsp;\r\n       Is the Corporation the agent or alter-ego of the School District and thus subject to the South Carolina Constitutionâ€™s outstanding general obligation debt limit?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Do the resolution and its attendant agreements violate the School Districtâ€™s procurement code and is the School Districtâ€™s â€œprofessional services exceptionâ€ to its procurement code valid?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      V.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the School District have a â€œvalid public purposeâ€ for its September issuance of general obligation bonds?[6]\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  This case primarily involves the interpretation of statutes, which are questions of law.Â \r\nCharleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995).\r\nI. Financing Agreement/Constitutional Debt Limit\r\nThe Plaintiffs argue that the resolution and its attendant agreements constitute a â€œfinancing agreementâ€ and that the School District has exceeded its allowable amount of outstanding general obligation debt.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-27-110 (B) (Supp. 2005) provides that unless a governmental entity obtains voter approval, the entity may not enter into a â€œfinancing agreementâ€ if the sum of the â€œprincipal balanceâ€ of the financing agreement and the amount of the entityâ€™s outstanding bonded debt at the time of execution exceeds eight percent of the assessed value of taxable property in the entityâ€™s jurisdiction.[7]Â  The Code defines a â€œfinancing agreementâ€ in section 11-27-110 (A)(6), and it is undisputed that the agreement at issue in this case does not qualify as a financing agreement under the version of the statute reproduced in the 2005 Code Supplement.[8]\r\nAct No. 388 of 2006, however, substantially revised Â§ 11-27-110 (A)(6), and it is these revisions that have led to the current dispute.Â  Under revised Â§ 11-27-110 (A)(6), a financing agreement includes:\r\n\r\nany [contract] entered into after August 31, 2006, pursuant to which installment payments of the purchase price are to be paid by a school district or other political subdivision to a non-profit corporation, political subdivision, or any other entity, from any source other than the issuance of general obligation indebtedness by the school district, in order to finance the acquisition, construction, renovation, or repair of school buildings or other school facilities.\r\n\r\nPart V, Section 4, Act No. 388, 2006 S.C. Acts Â  3133, 3166-68 (emphasis added).Â  The Plaintiffs allege the resolution and its attendant agreements meet this definition.[9]\r\nAs the statute instructs, the application of the revised definition of a â€œfinancing agreementâ€ in this case turns on the source of the funds that the School District will use to make installment payments to the Corporation.Â  The Plaintiffs argue that although the School District manifests an intention to use constitutionally permissible amounts of general obligation debt to raise funds for the installment payments, the agreements use permissive terms that do not restrict the School District to using only general obligation debt.Â  To counter, the School District argues that it intends to make installment payments using only funds derived from the issuance of general obligation debt, and that the permissive terms are used exclusively to protect the School Districtâ€™s rights (1) to opt out of making the payments at any time (an event generally referred to as â€œnon-appropriationâ€) and (2) to use other funds that may be appropriated by another entity for this purpose in the future.\r\nA close examination of the scheme here at issue reveals no violations of the relevant constitutional or statutory provisions.Â  The resolution and its attendant agreements specifically provide that the School District is not obligated to make any payments to the Corporation unless the School District appropriates funds for that purpose.Â  Furthermore, unless and until the School District appropriates funds for an installment payment from a source other than the issuance of general obligation indebtedness, this claim is speculative and thus not ripe for judicial review.Â  See Waters v. South Carolina Land Res. Conservation Commâ€™n , 321 S.C. 219, 227, 467 S.E.2d 913, 917-18 (1996) (stating that an issue that is contingent, hypothetical, or abstract is not ripe for judicial review).\r\nThe crux of the Plaintiffs claim goes to the fund raising/repayment scheme on which they allege the School District plans to embark.Â  To make installment payments to the Corporation, the Plaintiffs allege that the School District plans to use revenues to retire a portion of its outstanding general obligation debt, and then issue new general obligation bonds to raise proceeds for the installment payments.Â  The Plaintiffs assert that this bond retirement/re-issuance scheme will occur on an annual basis, and that this process violates Â§ 11-27-110(A)(6)â€™s requirement that, to avoid classification as a â€œfinancing agreement,â€ the installment payments must come from â€œthe issuance of general obligation indebtedness.â€\r\nWhile not entirely unpersuasive, this argument overlooks the inescapable fact that the scheme put in place by the resolution and its attendant agreements complies with the letter of the statuteâ€™s requirements.Â  Undoubtedly, a school district possesses the authority and ability to use revenue to retire a portion of its general obligation debt.Â  Furthermore, the law clearly supports the proposition that a school district may incur general obligation debt provided the school district remains within the constitutional and statutory limits.Â  We are aware of no authority permitting this Court to regulate a school districtâ€™s activities of this type absent a violation of a constitutional or statutory limitation.\r\nOur jurisprudence in a similar area supports this conclusion.Â  On several prior occasions, numerous South Carolina school systems have struggled with how to finance their infrastructural growth while remaining within the boundaries of their constitutional and statutory general obligation debt limitations.Â  At one time, alternative financing arrangements known as â€œlease-purchaseâ€ agreements were a popular means by which school districts sought to achieve these goals.Â  Under these agreements, a school district would typically lease its land and buildings to a non-profit corporation for a long period of time.Â  After execution of the lease, the corporation would privately raise funds to finance the school renovation and construction, and the corporation would lease the new and renovated facilities back to the school district until the school district had repaid the principal and interest necessary to fund the construction.Â  \r\nAs occurred in the instant case, taxpayers challenged these arrangements as violating the relevant limits on a school districtâ€™s general obligation indebtedness.Â  In both Redmond v. Lexington County Sch. Dist. No. Four, 314 S.C. 431, 445 S.E.2d 441 (1994), and Caddell v. Lexington County Sch. Dist. No. 1, 296 S.C. 397, 373 S.E.2d 598 (1988), this Court held that lease-purchase arrangements did not constitute general obligation debt as defined under Article X, Â§ 15 of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Caddell represents this Courtâ€™s first pronouncement on the subject, and in that case, the Court began by examining the Constitutionâ€™s definition of general obligation debt.Â  296 S.C. at 399-400, 373 S.E.2d at 599.Â  Noting that this definition included only debt that is â€œsecured . . . by a pledge of [the school districtâ€™s] full faith, credit and taxing power,â€ this Court held that the lease-purchase agreements did not implicate the school districtâ€™s constitutional debt limit.Â  Id . at 400, 373 S.E.2d at 599.Â  The Court stated:\r\n\r\nIn its historical context, general obligation debt refers to that which is â€œultimately secured by taxes on the property within the political entity.â€Â  Thus, general obligation debt embraces neither yearly expenses payable from current revenues nor contingent liabilities of the governmental entity.Â  This is so because the governmental entity is not obligated to impose property taxes for their payment.\r\n***\r\nSimilarly, a leaseback arrangement containing an explicit non-appropriation clause places no such requirement on the political entity. . . . Liability under the leaseback arrangement is, at most contingent:Â  The District has the option of terminating simply by refusing to appropriate money for rent.\r\n\r\nId. (footnotes omitted).\r\nAlthough the instant case involves an â€œinstallment-purchaseâ€ agreement and not a â€œlease-purchaseâ€ agreement, we believe that much of Caddellâ€™s reasoning nonetheless applies.Â  As we stated in Caddell, and reiterated in Redmond:\r\n\r\nThe premise of the plaintiffsâ€™ argument that the plan for financing and construction . . . is a fraud or works an injustice upon the cityâ€™s taxpayers is that it is a device to accomplish, by change of form with no change of substance, the same result which has been rejected by the voters. This premise is faulty. It is not the construction . . . for which voter approval is required . . . . Rather, it\r\nis the creation of a general obligation debt . . . which requires the assent of the voters. The plan submitted to and rejected by the voters would have created such a general obligation debt. The plan now proposed does not. This difference is constitutionally significant. \r\n\r\nRedmond, 314 S.C. at 434, 445 S.E.2d at 443; Caddell, 296 S.C. at 401-02, 373 S.E.2d at 600 (quoting Guide v. City of Lakewood, 636 P.2d 691, 697 (Colo. 1981) (internal citations and internal emphasis omitted)).\r\nAlthough it presented the identical issue dealt with in Caddell, Redmond is particularly informative because it added the element of an expression of legislative dissatisfaction with school districtsâ€™ use of lease-purchase arrangements.Â  Specifically, at the time this Court rendered its decision in Redmond, legislation requiring that the amount expended in a lease-purchase agreement be counted towards a school districtâ€™s general obligation debt limit had passed the South Carolina Senate and was under consideration in the South Carolina House of Representatives.Â  See Redmond, 314 S.C. at 434-35, 445 S.E.2d at 443.Â  This Court stated, â€œ[i]f this bill is eventually passed . . . the Defandantâ€™s position will obviously not merit the same result reached in Caddell and in this case.Â  Until the legislature has definitively spoken on this issue, however, we must apply the law as it currently exists.â€Â  Id.\r\nTurning to the instant case, revised Â§ 11-27-110(A)(6), particularly the definition in effect after this coming December 31, clearly represents a legislative pronouncement of the type discussed in Redmond.Â  Unlike Redmond, this case involves legislation which has been passed by the Legislature, signed by the Governor, and is now effective. Â However, as in Redmond, the instant case involves a scheme which complies with the letter of the statutes currently in effect.Â  \r\nThe portion of Â§ 11-27-110(A)(6) currently in effect requires only that the school district use funds derived from the issuance of general obligation debt to make payments under an installment-purchase agreement.Â  So long as the School District abides by this requirement, they have not violated the statuteâ€™s requirements.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we deny the Plaintiffsâ€™ request for a declaratory judgment that the resolution and its attendant agreements are â€œfinancing agreementsâ€ which implicate the School Districtâ€™s constitutional and statutory debt limits. Â Additionally, and in accordance with the Defendantsâ€™ request, we hereby issue a declaratory judgment that the resolution and its attendant agreements are in compliance with the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions and limitations.\r\nII. Violations of Prior Referenda\r\nThe Plaintiffs argue that the resolution and its attendant agreements violate the results of two prior referenda which denied the School District the right to exceed its general obligation debt limit.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn 1998, the citizens of Colleton County rejected a referendum which would have allowed the School District to issue approximately $42 million in general obligation bonds; well in excess of the School Districtâ€™s general obligation debt limit. Â Similarly, in 1999, voters rejected a resolution which would have allowed the School District to issue approximately $39.5 million in general obligation bonds.Â  The Plaintiffs claim that a decision of the School District which results in an increase of the School Districtâ€™s general obligation debt beyond its debt limit violates the results of these referenda.\r\nWe hold that this claim does not state a cause of action.Â  The relevant question is whether the School District has violated the constitutional or statutory limits on the amount of outstanding general obligation debt it may incur.Â  The Plaintiffs provide no authority supporting the proposition that a referendum which is wholly rejected (and therefore a nullity) can form the basis of a legal claim.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we grant the Defendantsâ€™ motion for summary judgment as to this claim on the grounds that it fails to state a cause of action.\r\nIII. Alter-Ego/Agency\r\nThe Plaintiffs argue that the Corporation is the alter-ego of the School District. Â Accordingly, the Plaintiffs argue that the Corporation is subject to the general obligation debt limit the South Carolina Constitution imposes on a school district.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn alter-ego theory requires a showing of total domination and control of one entity by another and inequitable consequences caused thereby.Â  Peoples Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 310 S.C. 132, 148, 425 S.E.2d 764, 774 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Control may be shown where the subservient entity manifests no separate interest of its own and functions solely to achieve the goals of the dominant entity.Â  Id.Â  However, this theory does not apply in the absence of fraud or misuse of control by the dominant entity which results in some injustice.Â  Id; see also Baker v. Equitable Leasing Corp., 275 S.C. 359, 367-68, 271 S.E.2d 596, 600 (1980) (holding that control, in and of itself, is not sufficient.Â  It is necessary to show that the retention of separate corporate personalities would promote fraud, wrong or injustice, or would contravene public\r\npolicy).\r\nA grant of summary judgment is proper when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  Furthermore, when a motion for summary judgment is made and properly supported, an adverse party may not rest solely upon the allegations or denials in his pleading, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Rule 56(e), SCRCP.\r\nTo support their alter-ego cause of action, the Plaintiffsâ€™ amended complaint alleged that the School District or its agents would create the Corporation and select the Corporationâ€™s directors, and also that the Corporation would have â€œno purpose other than to do the will of the School District.â€Â  In their motion for summary judgment, the Defendants relied in large part on the affidavit of the chairman of SCAGOâ€™s board of directors which directly refuted the Plaintiffsâ€™ allegations.Â  Specifically, this affidavit established that SCAGO, not the School District, would form the Corporation, appoint the board of directors, approve the Corporationâ€™s by-laws, and oversee the Corporationâ€™s functions.Â  The affidavit further established that SCAGO is a South Carolina non-profit corporation that was formed in 2002 and that the School District does not have control over SCAGO, nor does it have financial ties to SCAGO.\r\nAs the evidence illustrates, the affidavit offered by the Defendants in support of their motion for summary judgment directly refutes the allegations raised in the Plaintiffsâ€™ alter-ego claim.Â  The Plaintiffs have not contested the substance of this affidavit, nor have they set forth any specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial on this claim.Â  Accordingly, there is no impediment to our deciding this claim on summary judgment.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, there is simply no support for the conclusion that the Corporation is the alter-ego of the School District.Â  Our alter-ego jurisprudence instructs that the issues of domination and control over one entity by another are two touchstones of the relevant analysis.Â  In the instant case, there is no evidence suggesting the existence of either of these conditions.Â  \r\nFor this reason, we grant the Defendantsâ€™ motion for summary judgment and hold that the Corporation is not the alter-ego of the School District.\r\nIn addition to an alter-ago claim, the Plaintiffs allege that the Corporation will be acting as the agent of the School District.Â  Accordingly, the Plaintiffsâ€™ contend that the Corporation is bound by the School Districtâ€™s general obligation debt limit because an agent may possess no more authority than the principal.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn agent is one appointed by a principal as his representative and to whom the principal confides the management of some business to be transacted in the principalâ€™s name, or on his account, and who brings about or effects legal relationships between the principal and third parties.â€Â Â  Thompson v. Ford Motor Co., 200 S.C. 393, 414, 21 S.E.2d 34, 43 (1942) (quoting South Carolina v. W.T. Rawleigh Co., 172 S.C. 415, 174 S.E.2d 385 (1934)).Â  Whether one person or entity is the agent of another is determined by examining whether the party alleged to be the principal has the right to control the conduct of the alleged agent.Â  Newell v. Trident Med. Cent., 359 S.C. 4, 12, 597 S.E.2d 776, 780 (2004).\r\nIn the instant case, the record contains no evidence indicating that the Corporation will be acting as the School Districtâ€™s agent in any capacity.Â  As we have previously indicated, the evidence illustrates that SCAGO, not the School District, will form the Corporation, appoint the board of directors, approve the Corporationâ€™s by-laws, and oversee the Corporationâ€™s functions.Â  Although the Corporation will raise money to fund the renovation of the School Districtâ€™s facilities, the Plaintiffs cite no authority supporting the proposition that this, in and of itself, creates an agency relationship.Â  Similarly, the record does not contain any evidence indicating that the School District will have any right to control the Corporationâ€™s activities.\r\nAlthough the Plaintiffsâ€™ argument may accurately summarize the law regarding whether an agent may legally perform acts which, if done by the principal, would be illegal, the Plaintiffs do not present any evidence which tends to establish that the Corporation will serve as the School Districtâ€™s agent in any fashion.Â  Absent such a showing, this axiom of agency law has no framework in which to apply.\r\nAccordingly, we grant the Defendantsâ€™ motion for summary judgment and hold that the Corporation is not the agent of the School District.Â  \r\nIV. Violations of District Procurement Code\r\nThe Plaintiffs allege that the resolution and its attendant agreements violate the School Districtâ€™s procurement code because (A) the agreements create contracts with financial advisors, bond attorneys, a bond insurance company, and a company acting as a trustee, all without competitive bidding; (B) the agreements create contracts with SCAGO and the Corporation without competitive bidding; and (C) the contracts with SCAGO and the Corporation are improper multi-year contracts.Â  We disagree.\r\nA. Agreements with financial advisors, bond attorneys, a bond insurance company, and a trustee\r\nThe School Districtâ€™s procurement code applies to the expenditure of â€œpublic funds irrespective of their source.â€Â  See District Procurement Code Â§ 1-102.Â  Thus, generally speaking, the School Districtâ€™s procurement code would apply to contracts the School District enters into with financial advisors, bond attorneys, and other similar parties, provided that the contracts require the School District to spend public funds.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, however, the resolution and its attendant agreements provide that the Corporation, not the School District, will enter into several of the challenged contracts with financial advisors, bond attorneys, a bond insurance company, and a company acting as a trustee.Â  Unless the School District is a party to these contracts, we can discern no basis upon which to conclude that the School Districtâ€™s procurement code is applicable in these circumstances.Â  Because the record indicates that the School District is not a party to these contracts, it naturally follows that the School Districtâ€™s procurement code, in these events, is inapplicable.Â  \r\nSecond, Â§ 2-101 of the School Districtâ€™s procurement code generally provides that all contracts awarded by the School District are to be awarded by competitive sealed bidding.Â  This requirement is not absolute, however, and one exception to this procedure applies to contracts for professional services which are normally obtained on a fee basis.Â  See id. at Â§ 1-103(i) (listing attorneys, accountants, physicians, and dentists as examples of these types of services).\r\nThe School District argues that any contracts or agreements it has already formed or will form with bond attorneys or financial advisors will clearly fall under the procurement codeâ€™s â€œprofessional servicesâ€ exception.Â  The Plaintiffs do not dispute this assertion, but instead argue that the School Districtâ€™s â€œprofessional servicesâ€ exception is invalid because the South Carolina General Assembly repealed a similar exception from the South Carolina Consolidated Procurement Code in June 2006.[10]Â  We disagree with the Plaintiffsâ€™ contention.\r\nThis argument is unpersuasive.Â  The General Assemblyâ€™s repeal of the Consolidated Procurement Codeâ€™s professional services exception has no relevance to the validity of the School Districtâ€™s identical exception.Â  The Plaintiffs do not argue that Act No. 376 directly repealed the School Districtâ€™s exception, nor do they suggest that the act implicitly repealed the School Districtâ€™s exception.Â  Instead, the Plaintiffs suggest that Act No. 376 amounts to a determination that a professional services exception no longer embodies â€œsound principles of appropriately competitive procurementâ€ within the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-50 (Supp. 2005).\r\nWe hold that this conclusory statement is insufficient to present any issue to this Court for review.Â  The Plaintiffsâ€™ brief presents only this blanket conclusion and provides no authority supporting their argument. Thus, the Plaintiffs have effectively waived this argument.Â  See Solomon v. City Realty Co., 262 S.C. 198, 201, 203 S.E.2d 435, 436 (1974) (an exception was deemed effectively abandoned where the argument relating to the exception consisted solely of an inaccurate â€œbald conclusionâ€).\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the School District did not violate its procurement code by entering into contracts with financial advisors or bond attorneys.Â  Furthermore, we hold that the School Districtâ€™s procurement code is irrelevant to contracts the Corporation may enter into with financial advisors, bond attorneys, a bond insurance company, or a company acting as a trustee.\r\nB. Agreements with SCAGO and the Corporation\r\nThe Plaintiffs claim that the resolution and its attendant agreements improperly create contracts with SCAGO and the Corporation without complying with the competitive bidding requirement in the School Districtâ€™s procurement code.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nAs our jurisprudence instructs, an issue that is contingent, hypothetical, or abstract is not ripe for judicial review.Â  Waters, 321 S.C. at 227, 467 S.E.2d at 917-18.Â  Stated differently, â€œ[a] justiciable controversy is a real and substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical or abstract dispute.â€Â  Id. (quoting Pee Dee Elec. Co-Op, Inc. v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., 279 S.C. 64, 66, 301 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1983)).\r\nThe Plaintiffsâ€™ claims on this issue can be grouped into challenges to three arrangements: (1) the arrangement under which the School District is to convey the existing school facilities to the Corporation and lease the land on which these facilities sit to the Corporation; (2) the arrangement under which the School District may purchase the renovated or newly constructed facilities by making annual installment payments to the Corporation; and (3) the construction contracts the School District may enter on behalf of the Corporation.[11]\r\nAs a first matter, neither conveying the existing facilities nor leasing the Corporation the land on which these facilities sit involves the expenditure of public funds. Â Therefore, the procurement code does not apply to these agreements.Â  \r\nSecond, an adjudication of the Plaintiffsâ€™ claims on the remaining agreements at the present time presumes too much.Â  As yet, no public funds have been appropriated as installment payments under the â€œInstallment Purchase and Use Agreement.â€Â  Thus, this challenge can only be deemed an academic and premature exercise. Â Furthermore, the Plaintiffsâ€™ remaining claim assumes that the School District will award the renovation and construction contracts in a manner other than by competitive sealed bidding.Â  Because this claim involves pure hypothesis and speculation, this claim is not ripe for judicial review.Â  Assuming the Plaintiffs meet the required elements of standing, the proper time to bring this claim would be after the School District awarded a construction contract to a contractor without using the sealed competitive bid process. [12]  \r\nAccordingly, we dismiss the Plaintiffsâ€™ claims that the agreements improperly create contracts with SCAGO and the Corporation without competitive bidding.Â  Most of these claims fail on their merits, and those remaining are not ripe for review.\r\nC. Multi-year Contracts\r\nThe Plaintiffs argue that the â€œInstallment Purchase and Use Agreementâ€ (providing for the buy-back of renovated or newly constructed school facilities) and the â€œBase Lease and Conveyance Agreementâ€ (leasing the land on which the renovated school facilities currently sit to the Corporation) violate the procurement codeâ€™s limit on the term of contracts.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 2-302 of the School Districtâ€™s procurement code generally provides that the School District may not enter into a contract for â€œsuppliesâ€ or â€œservicesâ€ which contains a term agreement extending beyond five years.Â  The procurement codeâ€™s definitional section defines â€œserviceâ€ as â€œthe furnishing of labor, time, or effort.â€Â  See id. Â§ 1-201(22).Â  The section defines â€œsuppliesâ€ as â€œ[a]ll property including . . . leases of real property, excluding land or a permanent interest in land.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nBecause the procurement codeâ€™s plain terms clearly exclude â€œland or a permanent interest in landâ€ from the definitional provisions which are subject to the codeâ€™s limitations on the terms of contracts, concluding that the â€œBase Lease and Conveyance Agreementâ€ is excluded from the procurement codeâ€™s time limit is a rather elementary determination. \r\nTurning to the â€œInstallment Purchase and Use Agreement,â€ we hold that this contract is also exempt from the procurement codeâ€™s time limitation, but for a different reason.Â  The agreement expressly provides that it is not an agreement for a multi-year term, but is instead a one-year agreement that may, at the School Districtâ€™s option, be renewed until the School District has completely purchased the renovated and newly constructed school facilities from the Corporation.Â  Because this agreement is not for a multi-year term, the procurement codeâ€™s time limitation on contracts does not apply.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the School District has not violated the time limit on contracts found in its procurement code.\r\nV. Illegal Bond Offering\r\nThe Plaintiffs allege that the School District did not have a â€œvalid public purposeâ€ for its September issuance of general obligation bonds because the School District issued these bonds to raise cash for its first installment payment under the resolution.Â  We disagree.\r\nOur determination that the resolution and its attendant agreements are in conformance with the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions effectively forecloses this claim.Â  Accordingly, we deny the Plaintiffsâ€™ request to issue a declaratory judgment that the School Districtâ€™s September issuance of general obligation bonds was illegal, invalid, or ultra vires.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the resolution and its attendant agreements do not constitute â€œfinancing agreementsâ€ as defined by the provisions of Â§ 11-27-110 (A)(6) which are currently in effect. Â We therefore determine that the School District has not exceeded its constitutional and statutory debt limit.Â  We further hold that the School District has committed no violations of its procurement code, and we find in favor of the School District on the remaining causes of action.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The School District adopted a similar resolution in July 2006.Â  At the relevant September meeting, the Board repealed the previous resolution and enacted the one at issue.Â  \r\n[2] This process is detailed in the document titled â€œBase Lease and Conveyance Agreement.â€\r\n[3]  The resolution and its attendant agreements anticipate that the Corporation will issue approximately $90 million worth of bonds to fund the renovation and construction.Â  The repurchasing process is detailed in the document titled â€œInstallment Purchase and Use Agreement.â€ \r\n[4] The South Carolina Constitution provides that a public school district may incur general obligation debt only in an amount less than or equal to the value of eight percent of the total assessed property value in that district unless a majority of voters in the school district, by referendum, provide otherwise.Â  S.C. Const. art. X, Â§Â§ 15(5) and (6).Â  This value for the School District is approximately $12 million.Â  The date of the Plaintiffsâ€™ complaint precedes the resolution at issue in this case because the Plaintiffs originally challenged the first resolution enacted by the School District.\r\n[5] The Defendantsâ€™ original and amended answers contain counterclaims for declaratory judgments that the resolution and its attendant agreements do not violate the relevant procurement procedures and that the scheme does not impermissibly impact the amount of the School Districtâ€™s outstanding general obligation debt.Â  \r\n[6] This catalogue of the issues differs slightly from the manner in which the parties organized their briefs.Â  We have listed the issues according to the causes of action presented in the Plaintiffsâ€™ amended complaint.Â  For the sake of convenience, we have grouped the Plaintiffâ€™s fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action together under Issue IV, which deals with the School Districtâ€™s procurement code.Â  Similarly, the Plaintiffsâ€™ ninth cause of action, which deals with whether the School District or the Corporation is the entity ultimately responsible for the school renovation and construction, falls under Issues III (alter-ego) and IV (procurement code).Â  \r\n[7] Thus, this statute parallels the South Carolina Constitutionâ€™s limit on the amount of bonded debt a school district may carry.\r\n[8] Specifically, this version of the statute provides that a financing agreement means a contract under which a governmental entity (1) acquires the use of an asset, (2) makes payments in more than one fiscal year, (3) divides the payments into principal and interest components, and (4) acquires title to the asset if all scheduled payments are made.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-27-110 (A)(6) (Supp. 2005).Â  The agreements at issue here meet requirements one and two, however, the agreements do not provide for payments to be divided into principal and interest components.Â  \r\nFurthermore, under these agreements, title to the renovated and newly constructed school facilities is not contingent upon the School Districtâ€™s satisfying the entire amount of corporate bonds issued by the Corporation.Â  Instead, the Corporation transfers title to an undivided interest in the facilities to the School District each time a payment is made.Â  \r\n[9] Revised Â§ 11-27-110 (A)(6) provides additional definitions of arrangements that constitute financing agreements.Â  These definitions include:\r\n\r\nany contract entered into after December 31, 2006, pursuant to which installment payments of the purchase price are to be paid by a school district or other political subdivision to a non-profit corporation . . . in order to finance the acquisition, construction, renovation, or repair of school buildings or other school facilities.\r\n\r\nId.Â  The School District does not dispute that the resolution and its attendant agreements would meet the definition of a financing agreement if executed after December 31, 2006.\r\n[10] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-1270 (Supp. 2005) is substantially similar to the School Districtâ€™s â€œprofessional servicesâ€ exception.Â  The General Assembly repealed this entire section during its 2006 session.Â  See Section 63, Act No. 376, 2006 S.C. Acts 2839, 2894. \r\n[11] The Plaintiffs also challenge the School Districtâ€™s agreement with SCAGO.Â  However, because neither the resolution nor any attendant agreement provides for the School District to pay SCAGO any money, there seems to be no basis upon which we can conclude that the procurement code would apply to such an agreement.\r\n[12] Furthermore, we think it might be argued that these construction contracts do not involve spending public funds.Â  Of course, the parties have not presented these arguments, presumably because none of these contracts currently exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Dennison v.

Â If the applicant is indigent, counsel shall assist the applicant in obtaining representation by the Division of Appellate Defense.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nUnlike review of a conviction, which is by direct appeal and is a constitutional right, review of a decision in a PCR matter is discretionary by way of a writ of certiorari.Â  We find it is appointed counselâ€™s duty in PCR matters to serve and file the notice of appeal.Â  Thereafter, if counsel does not have a good faith explanation to provide pursuant to Rule 227(c), counsel shall provide the Court with a letter stating that as an officer of the Court, counsel is unable set forth any arguable basis for asserting the determination by the PCR judge that the PCR application was successive and barred by the statute of limitations was improper.Â  Counsel shall further advise the petitioner by copy of the letter that the petitioner should notify the Court, no later than twenty (20) days from the date of the letter, of any arguable basis the petitioner may wish to assert that the determination that the PCR application was successive and barred by the limitations was improper.Â  Although, generally, a petitioner would not be allowed in such situations to submit a pro se explanation, see Jones v. State, 348 S.C. 13, 558 S.E.2d 517 (2002)(counsel cannot serve as a mere conduit for pro se documents in an effort to avoid the prohibition against hybrid representation and the displeasure of his client) and Foster v. State, 298 S.C. 306, 379 S.E.2d 907 (1989)(no right to hybrid representation), we will allow a pro se explanation in the situation described above.\r\nIn the case at hand, we grant the petition for reinstatement and give petitioner twenty days from the date of this order to submit a pro se explanation pursuant to Rule 227(c).Â  However, we deny the motion to be relieved as counsel and to appoint new counsel.Â  In the event petitionerâ€™s pro se explanation is found to be sufficient to allow the appeal to proceed, counsel will be required to assist petitioner in obtaining representation by the Division of Appellate Defense.\r\n IT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    s/Jean H.
