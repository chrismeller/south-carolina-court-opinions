South Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 461 S.E.2d 388 (1995) (procedural due process claim raised for the first time on appeal is not preserved); State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000) (appellant has the burden to provide an adequate record for review).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Michael G.

We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand. The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent is licensed to practice law in South Carolina and Louisiana.Â  Until January 2005, respondent operated a law office in Louisiana only.Â  However, following the train derailment in Graniteville, South Carolina in January 2005, respondent opened a law office in Graniteville.Â  \r\n \r\nAdvertisements\r\nIn January 2005, respondent published several advertisements in the Aiken Standard newspaper in order to solicit clients as a result of the train accident.Â  In two of these advertisements, respondent failed to disclose the location, by city or town, where he principally practiced law.Â  Respondent also posted a billboard in Graniteville using a form of the word â€œspecialist,â€ when in fact respondent is not a specialist certified by this Court.[1]Â   \r\nSolicitation Letters\r\nOn February 8, 2005, respondent sent a solicitation letter (Letter #1) to residents in and around Graniteville, in which respondent referred to himself as a â€œneighborhood attorneyâ€ and included his photograph.Â  Letter #1 stated his staff â€œwill review your claim to see if you are entitled to damagesâ€ and stated he was able to â€œachieve the best legal results possible.â€Â  Respondent failed to disclose that he principally practiced law in Louisiana, did not disclose how he obtained the information prompting the communication, included a form of the word â€œexpert,â€ and provided an incorrect address and telephone number for the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission).Â  Respondent did not file a copy of Letter #1 with the Commission and did not pay the required filing fee within ten days of mailing the letter.Â  \r\n \r\nOn February 18, 2005, respondent sent another solicitation letter (Letter #2) to residents in and around Graniteville.Â  Letter #2 was similar, but not identical to Letter #1, in that respondent removed his photograph and the word â€œexpertise.â€Â  Although respondent filed a copy of Letter #2 with the Commission, he failed to provide a list of persons to whom the letter was sent.Â  \r\n \r\nOn March 3, 2005, respondent sent a third solicitation letter (Letter #3) to residents in and around Graniteville, in which he used the phrase â€œexperts in law.â€Â  Respondent failed to file a copy with the Commission, pay the filing fee, or provide a list of persons to whom it was sent within ten days of mailing Letter #3.Â  On March 22, 2005, respondent attempted to file Letter #3 with the Commission, but failed to include a list of persons to whom it was mailed.Â  \r\n \r\nBy letter dated March 7, 2005, ODC notified respondent of a complaint filed against him as a result of the solicitation letters and requested a response within fifteen days.Â  Respondent failed to respond.[2]Â   \r\nClient Letter\r\nOn June 16, 2005, respondent sent a letter to his clients regarding a proposed settlement.Â  In the letter, respondent stated he was â€œpicking up an average of an additional 25 clients a day,â€ when, in fact, he was only adding between one and six clients per day.Â  Although respondent believed the statement to be true, he did not verify this statement before including it in the letter.Â  \r\n \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits his conduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers). Â In addition, respondent admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 7.1(a) (lawyer shall not make false, misleading, deceptive or unfair communications about the lawyer or his services); Rule 7.1(b) (lawyer shall not make communications that are likely to create an unjustified expectation about results the lawyer can achieve); Rule 7.1(c) (lawyer shall not compare his or her services with other lawyersâ€™ services); Rule 7.2(i) (all advertisements shall disclose the geographic location, by city or town, of the office in which the lawyer principally practices law); Rule 7.3(c) (every written or recorded communication subject to this Rule must comply with filing requirements); Rule 7.3(g) (any written communication prompted by a specific occurrence involving or affecting the intended recipient of the communication shall disclose how the lawyer obtained the information prompting the communication); Rule 7.4(b) (lawyer shall not include any form of the words â€œexpertâ€ or â€œspecialistâ€ in advertisements); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  \r\n \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.

ECO Services of South Carolina, Op. No. 2005-UP-130 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 18, 2005).Â  Joseph Jenkins (Petitioner) contends the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner was employed by ECO Services of South Carolina, Inc. (ECO), a solid waste contractor.Â  On August 6, 1997, instead of returning ECOâ€™s vehicle to the Hilton Head office, Petitioner drove the vehicle to Hardeeville where he picked up several passengers, including Starr Gadson (Respondent) and his cousin, John Jenkins, and drove them to McDonaldâ€™s.Â  Petitioner then drove them to a store where John purchased one or two wine coolers.Â  John shared the wine coolers with another passenger.Â \r\n \r\nPetitioner drove them to Purrysburg Landing, where they talked for about an hour.Â  On the way back to Hardeeville, John drove the vehicle.Â  John reached a speed of 80 miles per hour before losing control of the vehicle.Â  Several passengers, including Respondent, were thrown from the vehicle and sustained injuries.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent filed an action against ECO and Petitioner, alleging negligence and negligent entrustment.Â  Neither Petitioner nor John appeared at trial.Â  However, Petitioner did move for a directed verdict.Â  The jury returned a verdict against all three defendants, finding: (1) ECO entrusted the vehicle to Petitioner; (2) ECO was negligent in entrusting the vehicle to Petitioner; (3) ECOâ€™s negligence proximately caused Respondentâ€™s injuries; (4) John was driving the vehicle at the time of the accident and was doing so negligently; (5) Johnâ€™s negligence proximately caused Respondentâ€™s injuries; (6) Petitioner was not driving the vehicle at the time of the accident; and (7) Petitioner was negligent in entrusting the vehicle to John.Â  The jury awarded Respondent $50,000 in actual damages.\r\nBoth ECO and Petitioner moved for JNOV and a new trial based on juror misconduct.Â  The trial court dismissed both motions finding they were not timely filed.Â  The Court of Appeals remanded and the trial court considered and denied the motions.Â  ECO and Petitioner appealed.Â  Based on the definition of negligent entrustment as provided by the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 308 (1965), the Court of Appeals affirmed as to Petitioner and reversed as to ECO.Â  Gadson v. ECO Services of S.C., Op. No. 2005-UP-130 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 18, 2005).Â  Specifically, the Court of Appeals considered Petitionerâ€™s driving record and work history and found ECO neither knew nor should have known Petitioner intended or was likely to use the truck in such a manner as to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others.Â  As for Petitioner, the Court of Appeals found he knew or should have known Johnâ€™s use of the vehicle was likely to cause harm considering their familial relationship and the fact John consumed alcohol before driving.Â  \r\n \r\nISSUE \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of Petitionerâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV and in finding Petitioner negligently entrusted the vehicle to John Jenkins?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, this Court applies the same standard as the trial court.Â  Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772 (2004). Â The Court is required to view the evidence and inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d 231 (2002).Â  The motions should be denied when either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 626 S.E.2d 884 (2006).Â  An appellate court will only reverse the lower courtâ€™s ruling when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is controlled by an error of law. Â Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999). \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motions for directed verdict and JNOV and in finding he negligently entrusted the vehicle to John Jenkins.Â  Specifically, Petitioner argues there is no evidence from which a jury could have reasonably concluded he knew or had reason to know John was likely to use the vehicle in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical harm to himself or others.Â \r\n \r\nto our case law, the elements of negligent entrustment are: (1) knowledge of or knowledge imputable to the owner that the driver was either addicted to intoxicants or had the habit of drinking; (2) the owner knew or had imputable knowledge that the driver was likely to drive while intoxicated; and (3) under these circumstances, the entrustment of a vehicle by the owner to such a driver.Â  Jackson v. Price, 288 S.C. 377, 342 S.E.2d 628 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  However, in determining whether Respondent met her burden of proving the elements of negligent entrustment, the Court of Appeals applied Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 308 and 390,[1] which extend liability when the owner knows or had reason to know that such person is likely because of his youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to create an unreasonable risk of physical harm to himself and others.Â  We decline to adopt sections 308 and 390 of the Restatement based on this set of facts, and we analyze this case under the elements of negligent entrustment set forth in Jackson.Â  Â Â \r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in finding Petitioner knew John would cause harm because Petitioner knew John had been drinking alcohol prior to driving the vehicle.Â  Over an hour before driving the vehicle, Petitioner witnessed John purchase and consume wine coolers.Â  It is disputed whether John purchased one or two wine coolers and whether he shared the drinks with another passenger.Â  Petitioner stated in his brief and Respondent testified at trial that John did not appear intoxicated.Â  Furthermore, there was no evidence as to Johnâ€™s drinking habits or his driving record.Â  The sole evidence supporting the claim for negligent entrustment against Petitioner is the fact John had one or two wine coolers prior to driving.Â  Knowledge that a driver has had a drink or two is a far cry from meeting the first element of negligent entrustment that there be knowledge of or knowledge imputable to the owner that the driver was either addicted to intoxicants or had the habit of drinking.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Respondents, there was no support for the contention Petitioner, or even Respondent, for that matter, knew John was intoxicated; nor was there evidence Petitioner knew John had a habit of being intoxicated and driving.Â  Evidence John consumed as little as half of a wine cooler[2] an hour before driving the vehicle does not support a finding of negligent entrustment against Petitioner.Â  See, e.g., Greene v. Jenkins, 481 S.E.2d 617 (Ga. Ct. App. 1997) (parents were not liable for entrusting vehicle to son when parents knew son had a couple of drinks, but did not know he was incompetent due to intoxication and when passenger in wrecked vehicle testified she would not have ridden with the son had she believed he was intoxicated); Gibson v. Bruner, 178 A.2d 145 (Pa. 1961) (JNOV granted to father who entrusted truck to son after son had consumed four bottles of beer when there was no evidence son was intoxicated or unable to drive the truck competently).\r\nThe Court of Appeals also erred in finding Petitioner knew John would cause harm simply because John was Petitionerâ€™s cousin.Â  The Court of Appeals held, â€œ[Petitioner] was apparently familiar with Johnâ€™s character, because he was Johnâ€™s cousin.â€Â  Gadson v. ECO Services of S.C., Op. No. 2005-UP-130 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 18, 2005).Â  Respondent presented no evidence Petitioner had any knowledge of Johnâ€™s drinking habits, driving record, or general behavior.Â  Assuming Petitioner was aware of Johnâ€™s character simply because Petitioner and John are cousins was error.Â  \r\n \r\nFinally, the Court of Appeals erred in finding the jury could have inferred the elements of negligent entrustment had been met when Petitioner failed to testify on his own behalf.Â  The failure of a defendant to testify raises an inference that his testimony, if it had been submitted, would have been unfavorable to his position.Â  See, e.g., Crocker v. Weathers, 240 S.C. 412, 126 S.E. 335 (1962). Â However, Respondent presented no evidence Petitioner knew John would create an unreasonable risk of harm other than evidence Petitioner and John were cousins and John consumed a minimal amount of alcohol before driving.Â  Respondent carried the burden of proof and failed to present any evidence Petitioner negligently entrusted the vehicle to John.Â  See Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C. 428, 433, 532 S.E.2d 612, 614 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œThe burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish the negligence of the defendant.â€).Â  Respondent failed to meet her burden of proof and cannot rely on the absence of Petitioner at trial to fill the void of evidence.Â Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of Petitionerâ€™s motion for a directed verdict because Respondent failed to submit any evidence establishing the necessary elements of negligent entrustment.Â \r\n \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, J., and Acting Justice J. Cordell Maddox, concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that petitionerâ€™s JNOV motion should have been granted, but write separately because I believe we should adopt Restatement (Second) of Torts, Â§Â§ 308 and 390 as alternative methods of proving negligent entrustment.Â  I fear that our current formulation would not admit of liability where a person permitted an individual to drive an automobile knowing that the driver was intoxicated, but where there was no evidence the supplier knew the driver was a habitual drinker or addicted to alcohol.Â  In my view, adoption of sections 308 and 390 would eliminate this loophole.Â  That said, I agree that even under these formulations, there is no evidence that petitioner knew or should have known that John Jenkins was likely to operate the vehicle in a manner which created an unreasonable risk of harm.Â  I therefore concur in the decision to reverse and remand the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of petitionerâ€™s JNOV motion.Â Â \r\n \r\n\r\n[1] Section 308 provides:\r\nIt is negligence to permit a third person to use a thing or to engage in an activity which is under the control of the actor, if the actor knows or should know that such person intends or is likely to use the thing or to conduct himself in the activity in such a manner as to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others.\r\nSection 390 provides:\r\nOne who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for the use of another whom the supplier knows or has reason to know to be likely because of his youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to use it in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical harm to himself and others whom the supplier should expect to share in or be endangered by its use, is subject to liability for physical harm resulting to them.\r\n[2] Â Respondent testified John split the wine cooler with another passenger.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26358","title":"New York Times Co. v.

Couch, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26358\r\nHeard June 20, 2007 - Filed July 16, 2007Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tKenneth E. Darr and Carlos C. Johnson, both of Lyles, Darr &amp; Clark, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJay Bender, of Baker, Ravenel &amp; Bender, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  This is an appeal from an order granting injunctive relief and attorneyâ€™s fees under the Freedom of Information Act (â€œFOIAâ€) to plaintiffs New York Times Co., d/b/a The Spartanburg Herald-Journal, and Bob Dalton, city editor for the paper (collectively, â€œrespondentsâ€).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2003, while Spartanburg County School District No. 7 (â€œappellantâ€) was searching for a school superintendent, respondents transmitted a FOIA request seeking material relative to appellantâ€™s search.Â  Specifically, respondents requested, â€œ[A]ccess to all materials gathered by the Spartanburg School District No. 7 Trustees regardless of form, relating to not fewer than the final three applicants considered for the District No. 7 superintendentâ€™s position.â€[1]Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant described its superintendent selection process as beginning with a group of approximately thirty applicants.Â  That group was narrowed to five â€œsemi-finalists,â€ out of which two â€œfinalistsâ€ were selected.Â  The district had assured the five semi-finalists that only the identities of the finalists would be revealed.Â  As a result, appellant only offered to make available material relating to the two individuals considered to be â€œfinalists.â€Â \r\n \r\nRespondents filed a complaint shortly thereafter, seeking a declaratory judgment that appellant violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13) and injunctive relief restraining the district from withholding further information related to the superintendent search.Â \r\n \r\nAfter a non-jury trial, the circuit court found that appellant had violated Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13), ordered the disclosure of additional information, and awarded attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to respondents.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Did appellant violate Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13) by disclosing information relating to only the two applicants it deemed to be the final applicants?\r\n\t2.&nbsp; Did the circuit court err by awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to respondents, where appellant acted in good faith based on its reasonable understanding of the statute?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn a case raising a novel question regarding the interpretation of a statute, the appellate court is free to decide the question with no particular deference to the lower court. Â Sloan v. South Carolina Bd. of Physical Therapy Examiners, 370 S.C. 452, 466, 636 S.E.2d 598, 605 (2006). Â We cannot construe a statute without regard to its plain and ordinary meaning, and this Court may not resort to subtle or forced construction in an attempt to limit or expand a statuteâ€™s scope. Â City of Columbia v. Am. Civ. Liberties Union of South Carolina, Inc., 323 S.C. 384, 388, 475 S.E.2d 747, 749 (1996).\r\nIn interpreting a statute, our primary purpose is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.Â  Beattie v. Aiken County Dept. of Soc. Serv., 319 S.C. 449, 452, 462 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1995).Â  â€œA statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.â€ Â Id. (citing Browning v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992)).\r\nFOIA is remedial in nature and should be liberally construed to carry out the purpose mandated by the legislature.Â  Quality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. 156, 161, 547 S.E.2d 862, 864-865 (2001).Â  FOIA must be construed so as to make it possible for citizens to learn and report fully the activities of public officials.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-15 (Supp. 2007).\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13), which exempts from mandatory disclosure certain material gathered in the search to fill a public employment position, provides:\r\n\r\n\t(a) A public body may but is not required to exempt from disclosure the following information:\r\n\tâ€¦.\r\n\t(13) All materials, regardless of form, gathered by a public body during a search to fill an employment position, \r\n\texcept that materials relating to not fewer than the final three applicants under consideration for a position must be made available for public inspection and copying.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13) (emphasis added).Â  The circuit court determined that this provision required disclosure of material relating to applicants in the pool from which the employment selection was made, provided that pool contained not fewer than three people.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant contends that Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13) only mandates disclosure of those applicants deemed by the public body to be the â€œfinalâ€ applicants, even if that number is fewer than three.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe statutory language requiring disclosure of materials relating to â€œnot fewer than the final three applicantsâ€ requires the public body to disclose the final pool of applicants comprised of at least three people.Â  We do not agree with appellant that only those applicants deemed by the agency to be â€œfinalistsâ€ are subject to disclosure. Â According to the plain language of the statute, disclosure is limited to the final pool consisting of not fewer than three applicants.Â \r\n \r\nApplication of the statute in this case requires that disclosure be limited to the final group numbering more than two- i.e., the five semi-finalists, not the entire group of thirty applicants.Â  The term â€œfinalâ€ in Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13) refers to the last group of applicants, with at least three members, from which the employment selection is made.\r\nAppellant also argues that Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13), as interpreted by the circuit court, has the absurd effect of forcing public employers to name three finalists even though there may only be two qualified candidates.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nThe fact that a public employer has to disclose information regarding an employment search does not in any way force the employer to officially name three finalists.Â  The statute simply requires a public employer to disclose material relating to a larger group of applicants if it chooses to name one or two â€œfinalists.â€Â  Construing Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13) as urged by appellant would allow public employers to avoid disclosure by naming only one or two â€œfinalists.â€Â  We will reject a statutory interpretation that leads to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention. Â Kiriakides v. United Artists Commun., Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994). Â Our interpretation of Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13) comports with the plain language of the statute and promotes the purpose of FOIA.\r\nAppellant also argues that the circuit court abused its discretion by awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to respondents.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-100(b) (Supp. 2007) allows for an award of attorneyâ€™s fees where the party seeking relief prevails in whole or in part.Â  After the circuit court granted relief to respondents, it directed respondents to submit material in support of their claim for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Appellant does not challenge the amount of the award nor the material submitted in support of the award.\r\nAppellant contends that if the Court finds it violated Â§ 30-4-40(a)(13), attorneyâ€™s fees are not proper because appellant acted in good faith based on its reasonable understanding of that section.Â  We previously rejected the same argument in Socy. of Prof. Journalists v. Sexton, 283 S.C. 563, 324 S.E.2d 313 (1984).Â  No good faith exception exists for an award of attorneyâ€™s fees under FOIA.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to respondents pursuant to Â§ 30-4-100(b).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that appellant violated FOIA by not disclosing material relating to the applicants in the group of five.Â  Furthermore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to respondents.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondentsâ€™ request tracked the language found in S.C.

Â The ticket charged Boland with speeding 85 mph in a 55 mph zone, a 6\r\n  point violation.Â  The ticket was returnable before Newberry County Magistrate Mark\r\n  English.[1]Â   \r\nRespondent suggested Boland and/or\r\n  Bolandâ€™s father contact respondentâ€™s father, a lawyer who practiced law in Newberry County. Â Respondent believed that Boland and/or Bolandâ€™s father contacted\r\n  respondentâ€™s father but he had no actual knowledge of whether or not his own\r\n  father assisted Boland until later.Â   \r\nIt is now known that\r\n  respondentâ€™s father had a conversation with his son-in-law, Newberry County\r\n  Magistrate Joseph Beckham,[2] concerning the Boland ticket.Â  Magistrate Beckham then had a conversation with\r\n  the officer who issued Bolandâ€™s ticket.Â  As a result, the officer agreed to\r\n  mark the ticket â€œnot guilty.â€Â   \r\nThereafter, Magistrate English\r\n  heard the case against Boland.Â  Boland did not appear at the hearing and the\r\n  officer made no comment to Magistrate English when the case was called for\r\n  trial.Â  Magistrate English marked the ticket â€œ425â€ and â€œNRVCâ€ and sent it to\r\n  the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for processing as a\r\n  â€œguilty/defendant did not appear or paid [sic] fineâ€ ticket case.Â  The officer,\r\n  however, checked the â€œappearedâ€ box (which was not true) and the â€œnot guiltyâ€\r\n  box on the ticket.Â   \r\nIn June 2004, Bolandâ€™s father\r\n  contacted respondent.Â  He told respondent he understood that Boland had been\r\n  found not guilty, but that Boland had received notice from the DMV that his\r\n  driverâ€™s license was going to be suspended because of the conviction.Â   \r\nRespondent personally visited\r\n  the Magistrateâ€™s Office and obtained a copy of the ticket in issue.Â  He\r\n  discovered there was a discrepancy in the records.Â  One ticket contained marks\r\n  indicating Boland had appeared for trial and was found guilty and another\r\n  reflected Boland had been found not guilty.Â   \r\nRespondent telephoned Magistrate\r\n  English and inquired how Boland could address the discrepancy in the records.Â \r\n  Respondent states he inquired if a petition for a writ of mandamus was the\r\n  proper procedure for seeking to clarify the records concerning the ticket.Â  Magistrate\r\n  English informed ODC, however, that respondent threatened to file a petition\r\n  for a writ of mandamus to correct the ticket.Â  Other than the statements of\r\n  Magistrate English and respondent, there is no evidence to substantiate either\r\n  version of events.Â   \r\nThereafter, respondent and Judge\r\n  Saunders discussed the discrepancy in the tickets over the telephone.Â \r\n  Initially, respondent told ODC he did not have a telephone conversation with\r\n  Judge Saunders, but later acknowledged that he did have such a conversation.Â Â  Â \r\nRespondent believes he provided\r\n  a copy of the ticket to his father.Â  However, he may have given the ticket to\r\n  Boland or Bolandâ€™s father.\r\nAt approximately 1:00 p.m. on\r\n  June 11, 2004, Boland came to respondentâ€™s office in Columbia to have his\r\n  affidavit notarized.Â  Respondent arranged for a co-worker to notarize the\r\n  affidavit.Â  Respondent represents that, at the time, he was unaware that his father\r\n  had prepared pleadings,[3] including an affidavit, for Boland to file pro se.Â  \r\n \r\nOn June 11, 2004, the pleadings\r\n  were presented by someone to Judge Saunders for his signature.[4]Â  The same day, Judge Saunders signed\r\n  the proposed order requiring Magistrate English to appear before him the next\r\n  business day for purposes of correcting the error in the records. Â The same\r\n  day, respondent visited Judge Saundersâ€™ chambers and, at the judgeâ€™s request,\r\n  arranged to have the pleadings served on Magistrate English.Â   \r\nRespondent called the Sheriff of\r\n  Newberry County regarding service, then delivered the pleadings to a sheriffâ€™s\r\n  deputy for service on Magistrate English.Â  The Sheriff states respondent\r\n  advised him that the Attorney General wanted the papers served.Â  Respondent\r\n  denies having made this assertion.Â  Other than the statements of the Sheriff\r\n  and respondent, there is no evidence to substantiate either version of the\r\n  events.Â   \r\nAt the hearing held before Judge\r\n  Saunders, Boland, pro se, appeared with his father.Â  Neither\r\n  respondent nor his father appeared at the hearing.Â  After Judge Saunders\r\n  suggested that Magistrate English, Boland, and Bolandâ€™s father discuss the\r\n  matter, Magistrate English changed the ticket to â€œnot guilty.â€Â   \r\nIn April 2005, ODC was\r\n  conducting investigations related to Magistrates English and Beckham.Â \r\n  Respondent was asked to voluntarily appear before ODC to give testimony\r\n  detailing his knowledge of Bolandâ€™s ticket.Â   \r\nOn April 14, 2005, respondent\r\n  voluntarily appeared before Disciplinary Counsel.Â  He was sworn as a witness\r\n  and gave testimony under oath.Â  Respondent testified he did not know who had\r\n  prepared the pleadings which were presented to and signed by Judge Saunders.Â  Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel asserts respondent did know who had prepared the pleadings, but\r\n  intentionally withheld that information from ODC.Â  Respondent claims he did not\r\n  know his father had prepared the pleadings until he discussed the matter with\r\n  his father after the examination.Â  However, respondent acknowledges he was not\r\n  fully forthcoming about his knowledge of Bolandâ€™s ticket when he was examined\r\n  under oath and that he testified he did not know the answers to certain\r\n  questions when, in fact, he did.Â   \r\nWhen he was examined under oath\r\n  by Disciplinary Counsel, respondent voluntarily produced certain documents he\r\n  had in his possession related to Bolandâ€™s ticket.Â  One document provided to ODC\r\n  (the letter from DMV to Boland requiring him to surrender his driverâ€™s license)\r\n  contained handwriting which had been obliterated using â€œwhite out.â€Â  In\r\n  response to questions from ODC, respondent represented he did not know who had\r\n  placed the â€œwhite outâ€ on the document.Â  The information obliterated by the\r\n  â€œwhite outâ€ was facsimile information from the person who faxed the DMV letter\r\n  to respondent and respondentâ€™s facsimile number at the Attorney Generalâ€™s\r\n  Office which had been written on the document by its sender.Â Â   \r\nAccording to respondent, after\r\n  providing his testimony in April, he spoke with his father and learned his\r\n  father had prepared the pleadings.Â  Respondent wrote ODC and requested an\r\n  opportunity to correct certain answers he had given in his April examination.Â  \r\n \r\nOn May 24, 2005, respondent was\r\n  again sworn and examined under oath.Â  Some of the answers he gave to the\r\n  questions by ODC conflicted with answers given in the April 2005 examination.Â \r\n  Respondent did, however, disclose that his father had prepared the pleadings\r\n  for Boland.Â Â   \r\nAt the May 2005 interview,\r\n  respondent falsely stated he did not know until the pleadings had been served\r\n  that they related to Boland and the ticket.Â  However, at the previous April\r\n  interview, respondent had testified he was surprised to see that the pleadings given\r\n  to him by Judge Saunders on June 11, 2004 for filing and service related to\r\n  Boland and the ticket.Â  Further, respondentâ€™s father had stated under oath that\r\n  he was present during respondentâ€™s telephone call to the Newberry County\r\n  Sheriff to make arrangements for effecting service of the pleadings on\r\n  Magistrate English and saw respondent holding the pleadings in his hand.Â \r\n  Respondent acknowledges that he was aware when he filed the pleadings with the\r\n  clerk and delivered them to a deputy sheriff (who came to his fatherâ€™s house to\r\n  pick up the pleadings) that they were related to Boland and the ticket. Â \r\nAs part of a judicial grievance\r\n  matter, Magistrate Beckham was examined under oath on May 26, 2005, in Columbia.Â  After the examination, Magistrate Beckham met respondent at his home.[5]Â  Respondentâ€™s father happened by\r\n  respondentâ€™s house.Â  Respondent, his father, and Magistrate Beckham discussed\r\n  the events related to Bolandâ€™s ticket.Â  Based on statements subsequently made\r\n  by respondentâ€™s now estranged wife, ODC alleged respondent sought to instruct\r\n  his father and Magistrate Beckham how to answer questions related to Bolandâ€™s\r\n  ticket so their explanations would be consistent.Â  Respondent represents that\r\n  the conversation began with Magistrate Beckham reciting what he recalled of the\r\n  examination by ODC earlier that day, which led to a discussion among respondent,\r\n  his father, and Magistrate Beckham as to what each of them recalled about the\r\n  matter.Â   \r\nRespondent represents that he\r\n  did not instruct anyone on how to answer questions and that he did not undertake\r\n  any effort to make the stories consistent.Â  Respondent points out that he, his\r\n  father, and Magistrate Beckham had already testified under oath before ODC so\r\n  all they were doing was comparing experiences.Â  In sworn testimony before ODC,\r\n  respondent stated he did not recall a â€œmeetingâ€ to discuss the ticket, but now\r\n  recalls there was such a meeting.Â  ODC believes that the meeting was a chance\r\n  get together rather than a scheduled meeting.Â   \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct\r\n  he has violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â \r\n  Rule 1.2(d) (lawyer shall not counsel client to engage in or assist client in\r\n  conduct lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent); Rule 1.7(a) (lawyer shall not\r\n  represent client if representation of that client will be directly adverse to\r\n  another client); Rule 1.11(d) (lawyer who serves as public employee shall not\r\n  violate Rule 1.7, RPC); Rule 3.3(a) (lawyer shall not knowingly make false\r\n  statement of material fact to a tribunal); Rule 3.3(d) (in ex parte proceeding, lawyer shall inform tribunal of all material facts which will\r\n  enable tribunal to make an informed decision); Rule 3.5(a) (lawyer shall not\r\n  seek to influence a judge by means prohibited by law); Rule 8.1(a) (lawyer\r\n  shall not knowingly make false statement of material fact in connection with a\r\n  disciplinary matter); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or knowingly assist or induce another\r\n  to do so); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in\r\n  conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); Rule 8.4(e) (it\r\n  is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial\r\n  to the administration of justice); and Rule 8.4(g) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to knowingly assist a judge in conduct that is a\r\n  violation of the applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law).Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent admits that his actions constitute grounds for discipline\r\n  under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1)\r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for\r\n  a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice\r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the\r\n  practice of law for one (1) year.Â  The suspension shall not be retroactive to\r\n  the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the filing\r\n  of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit demonstrating he has\r\n  complied with the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] The handling of the traffic ticket has\r\n  previously been the subject of two judicial disciplinary opinions.Â  See In\r\n    the Matter of English, 367 S.C. 297, 625 S.E.2d 919 (2006); In the\r\n      Matter of Beckham, 365 S.C. 637, 620 S.E.2d 69 (2005).\r\n[2] Respondentâ€™s sister is married to Magistrate\r\n  Beckham.Â   \r\n[3] The pleadings included a proposed rule to show\r\n  cause order requiring Magistrate English to appear before Judge Saunders.Â  \r\n \r\n[4] According to the Agreement, evidence is inconclusive\r\n  as to how the pleadings reached Judge Saunders.Â   \r\n[5] At that time, respondent and this wife,\r\n  Magistrate Beckhamâ€™s sister, resided in Columbia.

Â§ 29-5-120 (2005).Â  Subsequent to the initial filing, Appellant discovered that Respondents had posted a cash bond to release the real property from the lien.Â  Appellant then amended the averments of its complaint to identify the bond as the subject of the enforcement action.Â  This amendment occurred after the expiration of the time limit for bringing an action to enforce the mechanicsâ€™ lien.Â \r\n \r\nRespondents filed a motion to dismiss the enforcement action and a motion to release the bond alleging that Appellant failed to bring the action to foreclose the mechanicsâ€™ lien against the bond within the six-month time limit.Â  The trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss and released the bond from the lien. Â This appeal followed and this Court certified the case from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  Appellant raises the following issue for this Courtâ€™s review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the trial court err in granting Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss the enforcement action and motion to release the cash bond from the mechanicsâ€™ lien?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe foreclosure of a mechanicsâ€™ lien is an action at law.Â  Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court Street, LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 127, 631 S.E.2d 252, 256 (2006).Â Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, an appellate court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless they are wholly unsupported by the evidence or unless it clearly appears the findings are controlled by an error of law.Â  Id. (citing Townes Assocs. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976)).\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred in granting Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss the enforcement action and motion to release the cash bond which secured the mechanicsâ€™ lien.Â  Specifically, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred in interpreting the relevant statutes to require Appellant to commence a separate action against the cash bond to enforce its mechanicsâ€™ lien.Â  Instead, Appellant argues its original enforcement action naming the Respondentsâ€™ real property as the subject of the action is sufficient to secure foreclosure on the bond.Â  We agree.\r\nThe procedures for the establishment and enforcement of a mechanicsâ€™ lien are provided by statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 29-5-10 et seq. (2005).Â  The Code provides:Â Â Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tUnless a suit for enforcing the lien is commenced, and notice of pendency of the action is filed, within six months after the person desiring to avail himself thereof ceases to labor on or furnish labor or material for such building or structures, the lien shall be dissolved.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-120.  \r\nGenerally, a mechanicsâ€™ lien is enforced against the real property upon which the services were performed or materials provided.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 29-5-10 to -21.Â  However, the Code provides that the property may be released from a mechanicsâ€™ lien under certain circumstances.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-110.Â Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tAt any time after service and filing of the statement required under Â§ 29-5- 90 the owner or any other person having an interest in or lien upon the property involved may secure the discharge of such property from such lien by filing in the office of clerk of court or register of deeds where such lien is filed his written undertaking, in an amount equal to one and one-third times the amount claimed in such statement, secured by the pledge of United States or State of South Carolina securities, by cash or by a surety bond executed by a surety company licensed to do business in this State, and upon the filing of such undertaking so secured the lien shall be discharged and the cash, securities or surety bond deposited shall take the place of the property upon which the lien existed and shall be subject to the lien. . . .Â  Unless suit for enforcement of the lien is commenced as required by Â§ 29-5-120, the undertaking herein required shall be null and void and the principal therein shall have the right to have it canceled and such cash or securities deposited or pledged or surety bond filed shall be released from the lien herein provided.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nAs the statute provides, compliance with any number of bond procedures allows a property owner to release his property from the mechanicsâ€™ lien.Â  See also Shelley Constr. Co. v. Sea Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 24, 27, 336 S.E.2d 488, 490 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  This allows â€œthe owner to convey or encumber the property free and clear of the mechanicsâ€™ lien.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nAll of the statutory requirements for the enforcement of a mechanicsâ€™ lien must be strictly followed.Â  Butler Contracting, Inc., 369 S.C. at 130, 631 S.E.2d at 257.Â  The failure to adhere to the requirements of the statutes will result in the dissolution of the lien, although such failure does not preclude an action on the debt.Â  Shelley Constr. Co., 287 S.C. at 27, 336 S.E.2d at 490.Â  \r\n \r\nTurning to our analysis of the question presented in this case, in order to be properly filed, the relevant statutes require only that a suit for enforcement of the mechanicsâ€™ lien be commenced within six months of the last provision of services or materials for the construction of the building.Â  Â Tellingly, neither statute requires a lien holder to name a substituted cash bond or other undertaking as the subject of the enforcement action.Â  See Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992) (noting that in construing a statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation).Â  In the absence of such a requirement, we interpret Â§ 29-5-110 as an instructional mechanism to the court directing that a judgment on a foreclosed mechanicsâ€™ lien be executed against a cash bond or other secured undertaking if one has been substituted in accordance with the statutory requirements.Â  To reach a contrary interpretation would impose a continuing record-checking obligation on the holder of the mechanicsâ€™ lien that the statutes do not contemplate. \r\n \r\nIn the instant case, Appellant commenced the enforcement action well before the expiration of the statutory time limit.Â  Â We find that the statutes do not require the Appellant to bring the enforcement action against the cash bond.Â  Therefore, Appellantâ€™s amendment of the complaint was unnecessary and Appellant timely commenced the action to enforce the mechanicsâ€™ lien. Â Â \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in granting Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss Appellantâ€™s enforcement action and motion to release the cash bond. Â Â Â \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  We direct that the cash bond be reposted, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26361","title":"In the Matter of Cletus K.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tCletus K. Okpalaeke, of Columbia, pro se.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an attorney disciplinary matter.Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (â€œODCâ€) brought formal charges against Respondent Cletus K. Okpalaeke based upon several alleged acts of misconduct.Â  The panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (â€œthe Panelâ€) found that Respondent committed numerous acts of misconduct and recommended that Respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.Â  Neither ODC nor Respondent, who is in default, objected to the Panelâ€™s findings or recommendation.Â  We accept the Panelâ€™s report, and we hereby disbar Respondent from the practice of law.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn 2005, ODC formally charged Respondent with multiple ethical violations arising out of several otherwise unrelated events.Â  The record indicates that despite attempted service by certified mail and by agents of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, Respondent was never served with these formal charges.Â  The record also indicates that Respondent has not filed an answer to these charges.Â  In early 2006, upon request from ODC, the Panel ordered that Respondent be held in default.[1]\r\nThe formal charges in this matter describe approximately nine different instances of misconduct.Â  Briefly summarized, these instances include:\r\nA. The Driversâ€™ License and Office Management Matters\r\nRespondent attended law school in Minnesota and graduated in 1993.Â  Respondent moved to South Carolina in 1996, and Respondent was sworn in to the practice of law in South Carolina July 23, 1997.[2]Â  When Respondent moved to South Carolina, he had a valid Minnesota driversâ€™ license.Â  Respondent did not obtain a South Carolina driversâ€™ license after his relocation.Â  Instead, Respondent drove using his Minnesota license until it expired.Â  Respondent then drove without a valid license until he was arrested in 1999 for driving under the influence of alcohol and for driving without a valid license.Â  Respondent pled guilty to these charges.\r\nRespondentâ€™s law office was a solo practice, and Respondent rented office space from a friend, Doe.Â  Respondent allowed Doe, a non-lawyer, to manage major aspects of Respondentâ€™s law practice.Â  Respondent gave Doe signatory authority on Respondentâ€™s operating and trust accounts, and Respondent also gave Doe supervisory authority over the office while Respondent was out of the country.\r\nAccording to ODC, Respondent failed to deposit client funds into his trust account and commingled his funds with client funds when he processed settlements through his operating account.Â  Respondent also allowed Doe to handle client settlements without the supervision of an attorney and Respondent disbursed client settlement funds from his operating account in the form of checks made payable to â€œcash.â€Â  According to ODC, eleven checks drawn on Respondentâ€™s operating/trust account were returned for insufficient funds during a six month period in 2000.Â  During that same period, ODC alleged that the balance in this account dropped below zero thirty-four times.\r\nB. The Court Reporter Matter\r\nRespondent ordered copies of a deposition transcript and failed to pay the court reporter who prepared the transcript.Â  When the court reporter attempted to collect on the bill from Respondent, Respondent asserted that it was his clientâ€™s obligation to pay the bill.Â  Eventually, the court reporter sought assistance from the presiding judge, who wrote Respondent two letters insisting that Respondent pay the bill.Â  Although Respondent ultimately settled his clientâ€™s case for an amount that would have covered the bill, the client reneged on the settlement and refused to sign the release.Â  Respondent never paid the bill, and the bill now totals $4,219.80.\r\nC. The Jury Questionnaire Matter\r\nIn connection with the same lawsuit, Respondent ordered a copy of a jury questionnaire packet.Â  The invoice provided to Respondent requested payment of $344.06.Â  Respondent did not pay this bill and instead asked his client to do so.Â  The client did not pay the bill, however, and the bill allegedly remains unpaid.\r\nD. The Client A Matter\r\nRespondent received a call from a non-lawyer assistant who worked for an attorney who had been suspended from the practice of law.Â  The assistant asked whether Respondent would take over some of the suspended attorneyâ€™s cases.Â  After speaking with the suspended attorney, Respondent agreed to review some of the files.Â  One of these files pertained to an automobile collision claim for Client A.\r\nAccording to ODC, Client A, a resident of New York, had a potential personal injury claim and Client Aâ€™s mother had consulted the suspended attorney about pursuing this claim.Â  Respondent reviewed this file, contacted Client Aâ€™s mother, and agreed with the mother that Respondent would send letters of protection to Client Aâ€™s medical providers.Â  In these letters, Respondent indicated that Client A had retained Respondentâ€™s firm to represent him in connection with the accident.Â  According to ODC, these representations were false because Respondent had no intention of representing Client A unless the at-fault party was willing to pay a settlement in the matter.\r\nRespondent also allegedly agreed with Client Aâ€™s mother that he would send a â€œscare letterâ€ to the at-fault party.Â  In the letter, Respondent falsely indicated that he had been retained by Client A and Respondent accused the at-fault party of perjuring himself in traffic court.Â  Respondent demanded payment of Client Aâ€™s claim and Respondent asserted that if the party did not settle the case within two weeks, Respondent would contact the local judge and prosecutor for the purpose of pursuing perjury charges.Â  Respondent received no response and took no further action.\r\nE. The Property Dispute Matter\r\nA party involved in a dispute over the purchase of real property retained Respondent to represent him in the dispute.Â  On his clientâ€™s behalf, Respondent sent a letter to the adverse party in the dispute informing the party of Respondentâ€™s representation.Â  The letter additionally accused the adverse party of extortion and grand larceny.Â  Furthermore, the letter indicated that Respondent had contacted the solicitorâ€™s office, who had in turn been in contact with the sheriff and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division about the matter.Â  The letter stated that Respondent intended to file a civil action based on the dispute and the letter indicated that the solicitor was going to handle the criminal case.Â  Respondent further asserted in the letter that he believed the adverse party â€œwould likely serve prison timeâ€ as a result of his conduct.\r\nAccording to ODC, Respondentâ€™s representations that he had been in contact with the solicitorâ€™s office and with law enforcement were false.Â  In response to this letter, the adverse party offered to refund Respondentâ€™s clientâ€™s money in exchange for a release.Â  Seeking additional information, Respondent replied to this offer and requested a response from the adverse party within three days.Â  Respondent asserted that after that time he would â€œnot be able to stop the process of this action and [the adverse party] will be picked up.â€\r\nF. The Process Server Matter\r\nThe complainants in this matter are process servers who were retained to serve a summons, complaint, and interrogatories on Respondentâ€™s client.Â  The complainants attempted to serve Respondentâ€™s client at her workplace, but the woman who answered the door at the building alleged that Respondentâ€™s client was not present at that time.Â  The complainants waited outside the business, observed Respondentâ€™s client leave the building, and attempted to serve Respondentâ€™s client in the parking lot when she returned.Â  The complainants photographed their attempt to serve Respondentâ€™s client, but the client denied that she was the person named in the pleadings.Â  The client threw the pleadings back at the complainants and then closed the gate to the parking lot, locking the complainants inside the lot.\r\nThe client then instructed an employee to call Respondent.Â  When Respondent arrived, he used his car to further block the complainantsâ€™ exit and he asserted that the complainantsâ€™ photographing his client violated his clientâ€™s rights.Â  The complainants asked that they be allowed to leave, but Respondent refused to move his vehicle.Â  The complainants eventually phoned the police, and after the police arrived, Respondent moved his vehicle so the complainants could leave.\r\nG. The Custody Dispute Matter\r\nRespondent represented a defendant in a custody dispute in family court.Â  In connection with the case, Respondent issued three subpoenas listing Respondent as the attorney for the plaintiff, even though Respondent represented the defendant.Â  One subpoena was served on the Department of Social Services requesting responses to discovery, and a second subpoena was served on the plaintiffâ€™s landlord demanding information regarding the plaintiffâ€™s rental agreement.Â  The third subpoena was directed to the defendantâ€™s childâ€™s doctor and requested discovery responses.Â  According to ODC, these subpoenas violated several court rules.Â  The record discloses that the family court held a sanction hearing relating to this conduct and that the judge admonished Respondent for his conduct.\r\nH. The Client B Matter\r\nRespondent received approximately $18,000.00 in settlement of a claim brought by his client, Client B.Â  Respondent issued a check from his office account to Client B for $11,000.00 as her portion of the settlement.Â  The check was returned to Client Bâ€™s bank due to Respondentâ€™s account lacking funds sufficient to cover the check.Â  Client B made several attempts to obtain her money from Respondent, and although Respondent eventually issued a second check to Client B, this check contained no date and the letter accompanying the check requested that it not be negotiated until Respondent confirmed that there were funds sufficient to cover it.Â  According to ODC, Client B has still not received her portion of the settlement proceeds from her claim.\r\nI. The Client C Matter\r\nRespondent collected $17,000.00 for Client C and failed to pay her medical bills.Â  According to ODC, Respondent has not responded to the notice of an investigation in this matter.\r\nPanelâ€™s Recommendation\r\nThe Panel noted that because Respondent did not appear at the disciplinary hearing, Respondent was deemed to have admitted the factual allegations of the formal charges and conceded to ODCâ€™s recommended sanction.Â  See Rule 24(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Based upon these facts and ODCâ€™s recommendations, the Panel found that Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.15 (failing to safekeep client funds); Rule 1.3 (diligence); Rule 3.4 (fairness to opposing party and counsel); Rule 4.1 (truthfulness in statements to others); Rule 4.3 (dealing with an unrepresented person); Rule 4.4 (respect for rights of third persons); Rule 4.5 (threatening criminal prosecution); Rule 5.3 (failing to adequately supervise nonlawyer employee); Rule 5.5 (assisting in the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.1 (cooperation in disciplinary matters); Rule 8.4(b) (committing a criminal act); Rule 8.4(d) (dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nODC recommended that Respondent be disbarred from the practice of law, and the Panel held that even without Respondentâ€™s concession of the appropriateness of this sanction, disbarment was the proper punishment in this matter.Â  The Panel based this finding on two aggravating factors.Â  First, the Panel held that this matter presented multiple violations including repeated conduct calling Respondentâ€™s honesty and integrity into question.Â  Second, the Panel held that Respondentâ€™s failure to answer the charges or appear at the disciplinary hearing indicated an obvious disinterest in the practice of law.Â  For these reasons, the Panel recommended that Respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court possesses the ultimate responsibility of determining sanctions in attorney disciplinary matters.Â  In re Rushton, 286 S.C. 543, 544, 335 S.E.2d 238, 238 (1985).Â  The instant case presents several different acts of serious misconduct, and after fully considering the misconduct at issue, we hold that disbarment is the appropriate sanction in this matter.\r\nAs we have recounted, Respondent failed to properly disburse settlement money in both the Client B and Client C matters, threatened criminal prosecution in order to gain advantage in a civil matter, was untruthful in statements and conduct towards others, and systematically failed to properly oversee and fulfill the financial obligations of his law practice.Â  Such conduct reflects extremely poorly on the legal profession and has the potential to inflict direct harm on members of the general public.Â  In short, we agree with the Panel that the instant case presents repeated conduct calling Respondentâ€™s honesty and integrity into question.Â  \r\n \r\nFurthermore, we agree with the Panelâ€™s finding that Respondentâ€™s conduct indicates an obvious disinterest in the practice of law.Â  By all accounts, Respondent has left this jurisdiction with no apparent intention of returning.Â  Respondent departed this jurisdiction with the knowledge that disciplinary action against him was imminent,[3] and since his departure, Respondent has shown no regard for the status of his license to practice law in South Carolina.Â  As this Court has noted, a central purpose of the attorney disciplinary process is to protect the public from unscrupulous or indifferent lawyers.Â  In re Hall, 333 S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998).Â  Furthermore, we have disbarred attorneys who fail to answer formal charges or appear at hearings before the Panel or this Court in egregious cases.Â  See, e.g., In re Wofford, 330 S.C. 522, 500 S.E.2d 486 (1998). Â Respondent has violated numerous provisions of Rule 7 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, set forth in Rule 413, SCACR, by violating the Rules of Professional Conduct; by failing to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority; by being convicted of a serious crime; by engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or bring the court or legal profession into disrepute, or demonstrating an unfitness to practice law; by violating the oath of office; and by willfully violating the financial record keeping requirements contained in Rule 417, SCACR.Â  In light of this misconduct, the Panelâ€™s recommended sanction of disbarment is more than adequately justified.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe conclude Respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants disbarment from the practice of law.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of this Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court. Â \r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, ODC and Respondent shall file a restitution plan with the Court.&nbsp; In the plan, Respondent shall agree to pay restitution to any party who incurred losses as a result of his misconduct in connection with this matter.Â  Furthermore, in addition to all other requirements Respondent must meet to be reinstated under Rule 413, no petition for reinstatement shall be accepted until Respondent has filed proof that he has made full restitution to all institutions and individuals who have lost money as a result of his misconduct, including restitution to the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection for any payment it may make.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The record illustrates that in 2005, the SLED agent attempting to serve Respondent had discussions with Respondentâ€™s neighbor and also the current owner of Respondentâ€™s former place of business.Â  Both individuals professed that they had not seen Respondent in over a year and that Respondent had previously indicated that he would shortly be moving to the country of Nigeria.Â  According to the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Division, the last entry on Respondentâ€™s passport is dated December 24, 2004 and indicates that Respondent left the United States for Amsterdam, Holland, via the Atlanta International Airport.Â  SLED has placed Respondentâ€™s information in the Treasury Enforcement System so that local law enforcement will be notified if Respondent re-enters the United States.\r\n[2] Respondent was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and moved to the United States to attend Winona State University in Winona, Minnesota, in 1980.Â  Respondent received his undergraduate degree from that institution in 1990.Â  Respondent attended William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota, and graduated in June 1993.\r\n[3] This Court refused to accept an Agreement for Discipline by Consent between Respondent and ODC in December 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26362","title":"In the Matter of Milton Demetrios Stratos","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26362","description":"This is an opinion in which the Court publicly reprimands an attorney for misconduct.","date":"2007-07-23","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      IN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of Milton Demetrios Stratos, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26362\r\nSubmitted June 21, 2007 - Filed July 23, 2007Â  \r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHenry B.

State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â Â  Â \r\nWhen respondent received initial notice of his appointment to represent the client, he erroneously assumed he was appointed to represent the client at trial in General Sessions Court.Â  Respondent filed the customary discovery motions with the trial court (which respondent now acknowledges was of no relevance since his client had already been convicted).Â  Respondent wrote one letter dated February 28, 2006 to the Office of Appellate Defense wherein he requested a return telephone call regarding the clientâ€™s case.Â  Respondent represents that he made several telephone calls to the Office of Appellate Defense but never received a response to his communications.Â  Prior to May 11, 2006, respondent did not file any pleadings, make any appearances with the South Carolina Court of Appeals, or take any meaningful action on behalf of his clientâ€™s appeal.Â \r\n \r\nOn November 19, 2006, after receiving notice of his clientâ€™s complaint from ODC, respondent met with his client for the first time.Â  As a result of his neglect of his clientâ€™s appeal and his failure to adequately and timely communicate with his client, respondentâ€™s client lost his right to have his appeal heard by the South Carolina Court of Appeals and/or the Supreme Court of South Carolina.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute), and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate the oath of office).Â  Respondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, particularly Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client), Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The client was convicted of murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26363","title":"Skiba v.

John, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26363\r\nHeard June 7, 2007 - Filed July 23, 2007Â Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJames P. Stevens, Jr., of Stevens Law Firm, P.C., of Loris, for appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid J. Canty, of David J. Canty, P.A., of Myrtle Beach, for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Respondent was hired by appellantâ€™s[1] then fiancÃ©e, Terral Matlock, to perform lot clearing and the removal of unmarked trees, roots, and ground debris in return for $13,200.Â  Appellant did not pay respondent for the work, but instead sent respondent a complaint letter, which stated the scope of respondentâ€™s work included root-raking and cleaning of the lot to prepare it for landscaping. [2]Â  Respondent perfected a mechanicâ€™s lien and later brought an action for foreclosure.Â  Appellant answered and filed a counterclaim that respondent left the job unfinished and that she had to hire someone else to complete the work.\r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the trial court granted appellantâ€™s motion to dismiss on the ground that respondent violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-30 (2001),[3] by not having a contractorâ€™s license.Â  The court noted that the work for which respondent contracted fell within the definition of general construction because it was an improvement of any kind to real property.Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-370 (Supp. 2006), which states that an entity which does not have a valid license as required by Chapter 40 may not bring an action at law or in equity to enforce the provisions of a contract, the court found that because respondent did not have a license, he could not bring an action against appellant.Â  The court dismissed appellantâ€™s counterclaim alleging that respondent left the job unfinished and caused damage to the property for lack of proof.\r\nRespondent then filed a motion for reconsideration.Â  During the hearing on the motion, the trial court allowed appellant to amend her complaint to add the affirmative defense of illegality of the contract.Â  The court further concluded that the case should be re-opened so that the parties could take more depositions and could produce the rules and regulations of the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation as they relate to Â§ 40-11-30.\r\nAt the next hearing, the deposition of Ron Galloway, the administrator of the South Carolina Contractorâ€™s Licensing Board was submitted.Â  Galloway stated he had reviewed the documents between the parties and concluded no building was involved in the contract and that respondentâ€™s work was not in preparation for a building site.Â  He stated it was simply â€œmoving dirt.â€Â  Galloway stated that clearing, grubbing, and removing debris does not require a contractorâ€™s license and that respondentâ€™s work was exempt from the licensing requirement.\r\nThe court concluded respondent was not required to have a license to perform the work requested by appellant, and therefore, that the contract was not illegal as it had earlier ruled. Â In its order, the trial court found that respondent was entitled to $14,700; however, the court subtracted $6,300 for respondentâ€™s improper removal of trees.Â  Accordingly, the court found respondent was entitled to $8,400 plus prejudgment interest.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court properly find in respondentâ€™s favor?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAt the time respondent perfected his mechanicâ€™s lien and brought the foreclosure action, it was understood by the parties that respondentâ€™s work had been completed in preparation for appellantâ€™s subsequent building of a home on the property.Â  During the trial, appellant determined that the contract was illegal because respondent did not have a contractorâ€™s license at the time the work was performed.Â  At this point, the trial court originally correctly dismissed respondentâ€™s action on the ground the contract was illegal.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-30 (2001) (no individual may practice as a contractor by performing or offering to perform contracting work for which the total cost of construction is greater than five thousand dollars for general contracting); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-20(8) (2001) (â€œâ€˜General constructionâ€™ means the installation, replacement, or repair of a building, structure, . . .or improvement of any kind to real property.â€).\r\nIt is apparent that when respondent discovered that he was required to have a license to legally perform the work for appellant, he decided to take an inconsistent position.Â  It is at this point when respondent claimed that his work was actually not in preparation for a building, but was in preparation for landscaping.Â  After hearing Gallowayâ€™s deposition, the trial court concluded respondent was not required to have a license to perform the work.\r\nBecause the work performed by respondent, as respondent now claims, was for the purpose of preparing the lot for landscaping and not for any work related to a building or structure, appellant contends a mechanicâ€™s lien cannot attach to the property.Â  Appellantâ€™s argument is based on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) (2007), which states that for a person to have a mechanicâ€™s lien, the person must perform or furnish labor or furnish materials that are â€œactually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building or structure upon real estate.â€Â  Section 29-5-10(a) provides that the â€œlabor performed or furnished in the erection, alteration, or repair of any building or structure upon any real estate includes the . . . work of making the real estate suitable as a site for the building or structure.â€\r\nA mechanicâ€™s lien exists only by virtue of statute; therefore, oneâ€™s right to a mechanicâ€™s lien is wholly dependent upon the language of the statute creating it.Â  Clo-Car Trucking Co., Inc. v. Clifflure Estates of South Carolina, Inc., 282 S.C. 573, 320 S.E.2d 51 (Ct. App. 1984)Â  We are not at liberty to depart from the plain meaning of the mechanic lienâ€™s statutory language.Â  Id.\r\nIn Clo-Car, the Court of Appeals found that land cleared and graded for the purpose of a road is not a building or a structure within the meaning of the statute.Â  The Court of Appeals concluded that under Â§ 29-5-10,a mechanicâ€™s lien cannot attach to land or to an ownerâ€™s interest in land where the work done is unconnected with and forms no integral part of the erection, alteration, or repair of either a building or a structure of some description.Â  See also George A.Z. Johnson, Jr., Inc. v. Barnhill, 279 S.C. 242, 306 S.E.2d 216 (1983) (to establish a mechanicâ€™s lien, it is generally necessary that the labor performed go into something which has attached to and become a part of the real estate, adding to the value thereof).\r\nOn the current facts of this case, respondentâ€™s work was completed for the purpose of preparing the land for landscaping and not in connection with the erection, alteration, or repair of a building or structure. Â Accordingly, a mechanicâ€™s lien could not attach and the trial court erred by finding in favor of respondent.Â  Therefore, the decision of the trial court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Appellants were not yet married at the time the work was completed.Â  Appellant Matlockâ€™s motion for summary judgment was granted on the basis he had no property interest in the lot.Â  Accordingly, for purposes of this appeal, we will only be referring to Appellant Gessner.\r\n[2] Appellant asserts, however, that her position has always been that the site work was for the purpose of improving the real estate for the erection of a residence. \r\n \r\n[3] Section 40-11-30 provides that â€œ[n]o entity or individual may practice as a contractor by performing . . . contracting work for which the total cost of construction is greater than five thousand dollars for general contracting . . ..â€ \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26364","title":"Chem-Nuclear Systems v.

Acts 387, (â€œAct 387â€) to an appeal pending before the South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Control (Board) on the effective date of Act 387.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nChem-Nuclear Systems, LLC, (â€œChem-Nuclearâ€) operates a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility in Barnwell County.Â  Chem-Nuclearâ€™s facility is licensed by the State of South Carolina through the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).Â  On March 15, 2004, DHECâ€™s Office of Environmental Quality Control renewed Chem-Nuclearâ€™s license for the facility.Â \r\n \r\nSierra Club subsequently filed a contested case with the Administrative Law Court (ALC), challenging the renewal of Chem-Nuclearâ€™s license.Â  The ALC upheld the license renewal.Â  Sierra Club v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control and Chem-Nuclear Sys., LLC, Docket No. 04-ALJ-07-0126-CC (S.C. Admin. Law Ct. Oct. 13, 2005).Â  Sierra Club then appealed the ALCâ€™s decision to the Board pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (2005) amended by Act 387 Â§ 5 (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (Supp. 2006)).Â  Prior to the effective date of Act 387, the Board notified Sierra Club, Chem-Nuclear, and DHECâ€”the parties to the appealâ€”that the Board would lose its jurisdiction to hear the appeal when Act 387 became effective.Â  The appeal remained pending before the Board on the effective date of Act 387, and the Board, at the request of the Attorney General, subsequently reversed its position and informed the parties that it did have jurisdiction to hear Sierra Clubâ€™s pending appeal.Â \r\n \r\nIn response, Chem-Nuclear filed this action requesting a declaration that Act 387 deprives the Board of jurisdiction to review the pending appeal in Sierra Club. \r\n \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid Act 387 deprive the Board of jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the ALCâ€™s decision in\r\n\tSierra Club v. South Carolina Department of Â Â Â  Health and Environmental Control and Chem-Nuclear Systems, LLC,&nbsp; Docket No. 04-ALJ-07-0126-CC (S.C. Admin. Law Ct. Oct. 13, 2005), Â Â Â Â  which was pending before the Board on the date Act 387 became effective?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAct 387, which was signed into law on June 9, 2006, and became effective on July 1, 2006, substantially reformed the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act in order â€œto provide a uniform procedure for contested cases and appeals from administrative agencies.â€Â  Act 387 Â§ 53.Â  Sections 55 and 57 of Act 387 are crucial to the outcome of this declaratory judgment action.Â  These sections provide:\r\n\r\n\tSavings clause\r\n\tSECTION 55. The repeal or amendment by this act of any law, whether temporary or permanent or civil or criminal, does not affect pending Â Â  actions, rights, duties, or liabilities founded thereon, or alter, discharge, release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under Â  the repealed or amended law, unless the repealed or amended provision shall so expressly provide.Â  After the effective date of this act, all laws repealed or amended by this act must be taken and treated as remaining in full force and effect for the purpose of sustaining any pending or vested right, civil action, special proceeding, criminal prosecution, or appeal existing as of the effective date of this act, and for the enforcement of rights, duties, penalties, forfeitures, and liabilities as they stood under the repealed or amended laws.\r\n\tTime effective\r\n\tSECTION 57. This act takes effect on July 1, 2006, and applies to any actions pending on or after the effective date of the act.Â  No pending or vested right, civil action, special proceeding, or appeal of a final administrative decision exists under the former law as of the effective date of this act, except for appeals of Department of Health and Environmental Control Ocean and Coastal Resource Management and Environmental Quality Control permits that are before the Administrative Law Court on the effective date of this act and petitions for judicial review that are pending before the circuit court.Â  For those actions only, the department shall hear appeals from the administrative law judges and the circuit court shall hear pending petitions for judicial review in accordance with the former law.Â  Thereafter, any appeal of \r\n\tthose actions shall proceed as provided in this act for review.&nbsp; For \r\n\tall other actions pending on the effective date of this act, the action proceeds as provided in this act for review.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  In ascertaining the intent of the legislature, a court should not focus on any single section or provision but should consider the language of the statute as a whole.Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  The language of a statute must be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  \r\n \r\nThe right of appeal arises from and is controlled by statutory law.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 194, 607 S.E.2d 707, 708 (2005).Â  Generally, the repeal of a statute without a savings clause operates retroactively to expunge pending claims, but a proper savings clause will have the effect of preserving a pending suit.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. McDonald, 367 S.C. 531, 535, 626 S.E.2d 816, 818 (Ct. App. 2006); Deltoro v. McMullen, 322 S.C. 328, 333, 471 S.E.2d 742, 745 (Ct. App. 1996), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 522 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Accordingly, Sierra Clubâ€™s pending appeal was preserved by Section 55, a savings clause, in Act 387.\r\nPrior to the enactment of Act 387, the Board had jurisdiction to review final decisions of the ALC, i.e., Sierra Clubâ€™s appeal.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (2005) amended by Act 387 Â§ 5 (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (Supp. 2006)).Â  Yet, under Act 387, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the ALC.Â  See Act 387 Â§Â§ 5, 15.[1]Â  In this action, we must determine whether Act 387 changed the forum for Sierra Clubâ€™s pending appeal from the Board to the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\n \r\nSection 57 requires Act 387 to apply â€œto any actions pending on or after the effective date.â€Â  Clearly, Sierra Clubâ€™s appeal was pending on the effective date of Act 387.Â  However, Section 57 creates an exception to this general rule of applicability and mandates the former law continue to apply to â€œappeals of Department of Health and Environmental Control . . . [Office of] Environmental Quality Control permits that are before the Administrative Law Court on the effective date of this act and petitions for judicial review that are pending before the circuit court.â€Â  The license at issue in this case was renewed by DHECâ€™s Office of Environmental Quality Control, but the ALC was divested of jurisdiction and the Board obtained jurisdiction over the case when Sierra Club filed a petition for review of the ALCâ€™s decision with the Board.Â  See generally Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 311, 486 S.E.2d 750, 761 (1997) (service of notice of intent to appeal divests the lower court of jurisdiction over the order appealed).Â  Therefore, Sierra Clubâ€™s appeal was before the Board, not the ALC or the circuit court, on the effective date of Act 387, and consequently, the exception in Section 57 to apply the former law to certain cases that were pending before the ALC or circuit court on July 1, 2006, is not applicable to Sierra Clubâ€™s appeal.Â  See Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994) (â€œWhen statutory terms are clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction and courts are required to apply them according to their literal meaning.â€).Â  Pursuant to the plain language of Section 57, the Board does not currently have jurisdiction over the appeal in Sierra Club.\r\nSierra Club opposes this construction of Sections 55 and 57.Â  Sierra Club contends this construction leaves it without an avenue for an appeal because it can no longer timely perfect an appeal in the Court of Appeals.Â  See Rule 203, SCACR (requiring notice of appeal to be filed within 30 days after receipt of the decision); Act 387 Â§ 5 (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (Supp. 2006)) (same).Â  This argument is without merit.Â  Section 55, the savings clause, acts not only to preserve Sierra Clubâ€™s right to appeal the ALCâ€™s final decision but also to preserve Sierra Clubâ€™s perfected appeal of the decision.Â  See Deltoro, 322 S.C. at 333, 471 S.E.2d at 745 (â€œ[A] proper savings clause will have the effect of preserving a pending suit.â€).Â  Because Section 55 preserves Sierra Clubâ€™s pending appeal, Sierra Club is not required to re-perfect its appeal in the Court of Appeals; instead, Section 57 effectively transfers jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals of Sierra Clubâ€™s appeal.Â  See Act 387 Â§ 57 (â€œFor all other actions pending on the effective date of this act, the action proceeds as provided in this act for review.â€); Cf. Rule 204(a), SCACR (â€œIn the event that the notice of appeal is filed in the wrong appellate court, the appellate court in . . . which the matter is filed shall issue an order transferring the case to the appropriate appellate court.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe declare the Board does not have jurisdiction under Act 387 to hear the pending appeal in Sierra Club, but the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction over the appeal.Â  Accordingly, we order the appeal in Sierra Club be transferred to the Court of Appeals pursuant to Section 57 of Act 387.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Section 5 of Act 387 (codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (Supp. 2006)) states, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\t(A) For quasi-judicial review of any final decision of an administrative law judge of cases involving departments governed by a board or commission authorized to exercise the sovereignty of the State, except the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Health and Environmental Control, a petition by an aggrieved party must be filed with the appropriate board or commission and served on the opposing party not more than thirty days after the party receives the final decision and order of the administrative law judge.Â  Appeal in these matters is by right.Â  A party aggrieved by a final decision of a board in such a case is entitled to judicial review of that decision by the court of appeals under the provisions of (A) of this section.\r\n\t(B) For judicial review of \r\n\ta final decision of an administrative law judge of cases in which review is \r\n\tnot governed by subsection (A),&nbsp; including cases involving the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Health and Environmental Control, a notice of appeal by an aggrieved party must be served and filed with the court of appeals as provided in the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules in civil cases and served on the opposing party not more than thirty days after the party receives the final decision and order of the administrative law judge.

Vincent, Deputy General Counsel, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  This is a direct appeal from the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the Administrative Law Courtâ€™s (ALC) summary dismissal of appellant James Furtickâ€™s prison grievance matter.Â  After we issued our original opinion in which we reversed, Furtick v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, Op. No. 26270 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February 20, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 89), respondent filed a petition for rehearing.Â  We now withdraw our original opinion and issue this opinion. Â We deny respondentâ€™s petition for rehearing and reverse the circuit courtâ€™s decision.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2001, when Furtick was an inmate at Lee Correctional Institution, the Department of Corrections (DOC) charged him with possession of contraband.[1]Â  After a major disciplinary hearing was held, Furtick was found guilty of the offense and reprimanded.Â  As a result of the reprimand, Furtick alleges he did not earn his good time credit for the month of the infraction.Â  Furtick appealed from this disciplinary decision through the DOCâ€™s internal grievance system; the DOC denied his grievance.\r\nFurtick appealed the denial of his grievance to the ALC, and the DOC moved to dismiss the action based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Finding that Furtick had no liberty interest in good time credits which he was unable to earn as a result of a rule violation, the ALC dismissed the matter.\r\nFurtick sought review from the circuit court.Â  The circuit court also found no liberty interest was implicated and therefore affirmed the ALCâ€™s decision.Â \r\n \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the circuit court err in finding the ALC lacked jurisdiction over Furtickâ€™s claim?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nFurtick argues that the circuit court erred by finding that the ALC lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review his grievance.Â  We agree.\r\nThrough statute, the State provides that an inmate is â€œentitled to a deduction from the term of his sentenceâ€ if he â€œfaithfully observe[s] all the rules of the institution â€¦ and has not been subjected to punishment for misbehavior.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-210(A) (2007).Â  However, â€œ[i]f a prisoner â€¦ violates one of the rules of the institution during his term of imprisonment, all or part of the good conduct credit he has earned may be forfeited in the discretion of the Director of the Department of Corrections.â€Â  Id. Â§ 24-13-210(D).\r\nIn Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), the United States Supreme Court explained that inmates have certain due process rights when good time credits are at issue:\r\n\r\n\tIt is true that the Constitution itself does not guarantee good-time credit for satisfactory behavior while in prisonâ€¦. Â [The State] may have the authority to create, or not, a right to a shortened prison sentence through the accumulation of credits for good behavior, and it is true that the Due Process Clause does not require a hearing â€˜in every conceivable case of government impairment of private interest.â€™â€¦ Â But the State having created the right to good time and itself recognizing that its deprivation is a sanction authorized for major misconduct, the prisonerâ€™s interest has real substance and is sufficiently embraced within Fourteenth Amendment â€˜libertyâ€™ to entitle him to those minimum procedures appropriate under the circumstances and required by the Due Process Clause to insure that the state-created right is not arbitrarily abrogated.\r\n\r\nId. at 557 (citation omitted); see also Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 483-84 (1995) (the States may, under certain circumstances, create liberty interests which are protected by the Due Process Clause); Henderson v. Commâ€™rs of Barnstable County,&nbsp;730 N.E.2d 362, 370&nbsp;(Mass. App. Ct. 2000) (â€œThe entitlement to statutory good time credit is a liberty interest.â€).\r\nThe USSC noted in Wolff that punishment in the form of â€œthe forfeiture or withholding of good-time creditsâ€ affects the term of confinement.Â  Wolff, 418 U.S. at 547 (emphasis added).Â  Additionally, in Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985), the USSC specifically stated the following:Â  â€œWhere a prisoner has a liberty interest in good time credits, the loss of such credits threatens his prospective freedom from confinement by extending the length of imprisonment. Â Thus the inmate has a strong interest in assuring that the loss of good time credits is not imposed arbitrarily.â€\r\nIn Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000), we acknowledged that â€œ[t]he statutory right to sentence-related credits is a protected â€˜libertyâ€™ interest under the Fourteenth Amendment, entitling an inmate to minimal due process to ensure the state-created right was not arbitrarily abrogated.â€Â  Id. at 370, 527 S.E.2d at 750 (citing Wolff, supra).Â  We held in Al-Shabazz that the DOCâ€™s disciplinary and grievance procedures are consistent with the due process standards outlined by the USSC in Wolff.Â  See id. at 372-73, 527 S.E.2d at 751-52 (for extensive discussion on the DOCâ€™s procedures for major disciplinary hearings). Â Moreover, we also held that an inmate generally could not raise a non-collateral claim, such as one involving the forfeiture of good-time credits, via the Post-Conviction Relief Act.Â  Id. at 367-68, 527 S.E.2d at 749.\r\nWe held, however, that an inmate could pursue review of certain grievance decisions made by the DOC by filing an action in the ALC pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).Â  The Al-Shabazz Court stated that when an inmate challenges a disciplinary outcome, calculation of sentence&#8209;related credits, custody status, or other condition of imprisonment, he could bring â€œa contested caseâ€ under the APA. Â Id. at 375, 527 S.E.2d at 753.Â  Thus, the ALC â€œsits in an appellate capacity to reviewâ€ these types of decisions.Â  Id. at 377, 527 S.E.2d at 754.Â  \r\n \r\nFurthermore, â€œ[a]n inmate is entitled to judicial review of the final decision in a non-collateral or administrative matter, which includes a disciplinary hearing.â€Â  Id. at 377-78, 527 S.E.2d at 754.Â  We explained that judicial review must be available to determine â€œwhether prison officials have acted arbitrarily capriciously, or from personal bias.â€Â  Id. at 381, 527 S.E.2d at 756-57.&nbsp;\r\nWe emphasized in Al-Shabazz that any judicial review would be of a â€œlimited natureâ€ and that the courts of this State would adhere to a â€œhands offâ€ doctrine when reviewing the decision from a major disciplinary hearing in which an inmate has a protected liberty interest due to the potential loss of sentence-related credits.Â  Id. at 382, 527 S.E.2d at 757.Â  Finally, the Al&#8209;Shabazz Court recognized that most of these matters would be resolved without either ALC or judicial review, but nonetheless held that such review â€œmust be available.â€Â  Id. at 383, 527 S.E.2d at 757.[2]&nbsp;\r\nSeveral subsequent decisions have reiterated Al&#8209;Shabazzâ€™s holding that the ALC has subject matter jurisdiction over an inmateâ€™s appeal when the claim sufficiently â€œimplicates a state-created liberty interest.â€Â  Sullivan v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 355 S.C. 437, 443, 586 S.E.2d 124, 127 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1153 (2004); see also Furtick v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Prob., Parole &amp; Pardon Servs., 352 S.C. 594, 598, 576 S.E.2d 146, 149, cert. denied, 539 U.S. 932 (2003) (in deciding whether Respondent was entitled to review of the Departmentâ€™s parole eligibility decision, the Court evaluated whether Respondent had a liberty interest in gaining access to the parole board); Steele v. Benjamin, 362 S.C. 66, 606 S.E.2d 499&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (the ALCâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction depends on whether there is a sufficient, state&#8209;created liberty interest implicated).Â \r\n \r\nFurthermore, in Slezak v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 361 S.C. 327, 605 S.E.2d 506 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 1033 (2005), we clarified that the ALC has jurisdiction over all inmate grievance appeals that have been properly filed; the ALC, however, is not required to hold a hearing in every matter.Â  We stated in Slezak that summary dismissal would only be appropriate â€œwhere the inmateâ€™s grievance does not implicate a state-created liberty or property interest.â€Â  Id. at 331, 605 S.E.2d at 508. Â Thus, where a matter clearly implicates a loss of statutory sentence-related credits, the ALC may not summarily dismiss the action.[3]\r\nTurning now to the instant case, we reiterate that the State of South Carolina clearly has created a liberty interest in good-time credits by enacting section 24-13-210.Â  Without a doubt, these credits for good behavior may be withheld or revoked as punishment when an inmate commits an offense while incarcerated or otherwise violates the rules of the institution.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-210(D).Â  Nonetheless, such a loss of good-time credits is reviewable by the ALC pursuant to Al-Shabazz and its progeny.Â  The matter is reviewable because the loss of good-time credits sufficiently â€œimplicates a state-created liberty interest.â€Â  Sullivan, 355 S.C. at 443, 586 S.E.2d at 127.Â  When a state-created liberty interest is implicated, the inmate is entitled to certain due process rights.Â  Wolff, supra.Â  While the DOCâ€™s disciplinary policies comport with those due process requirements, the purpose of allowing review is to ensure that due process was, in fact, accorded to the inmate and the inmateâ€™s right to the statutory credit was not â€œarbitrarily abrogated.â€Â  Wolff, 418 U.S. at 557; accord Al-Shabazz, supra.\r\nWe emphasize, however, that inmate litigation itself must comport with certain standards.Â  If a court finds a prisoner has: (1) submitted a malicious or frivolous claim, or one that is intended solely to harass the party filed against; (2) testified falsely or otherwise presented false evidence or information to the court; (3) unreasonably expanded or delayed a proceeding; or (4) abused the discovery process; then the â€œprisoner shall forfeit all or part of his earned work, education, or good conduct credits in an amount to be determinedâ€ by the DOC.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-27-200 (2007); see also Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 381, 527 S.E.2d at 756.\r\nIn this case, Furtick sought review from the ALC and such review was denied by both the ALC and circuit court.Â  Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the ALC to hold a hearing on the denial of Furtickâ€™s grievance claim.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the majorityâ€™s holding today ignores the legislative intent expressed by the clear and unambiguous language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 24-13-210 and -230.Â  Further, I believe the majority discards our Courtâ€™s long-standing â€œhands-offâ€ approach to judicial supervision of internal prison disciplinary matters which do not amount to a violation of constitutional dimensions.Â  In adopting its position, the majority has interjected our courts into every prison disciplinary matter which may result in an inmateâ€™s lost opportunity to earn sentence-related credits including a multitude of minor disciplinary infractions which, but for todayâ€™s decision, would not otherwise trigger due process protections.Â  Therefore, I would affirm the circuit courtâ€™s decision finding that an inmate has no constitutionally significant interest in the loss of the opportunity to earn certain sentence-related credits.Â  However, I would modify the circuit courtâ€™s decision to reflect that the ALC has subject matter jurisdiction to review such inmate grievance matters and that the ALC may summarily decide these appeals without a hearing.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n \r\nUnder our statutory law, Furtick does not have any protected liberty interest in the loss of the opportunity to earn sentence-related credits.Â  The United States Constitution does not provide an inmate with a guarantee of sentence-related credit for good behavior while incarcerated.Â  Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557 (1974).Â  However, in some instances, a state may create a liberty interest which is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995). Â Â A state creates a liberty interest in sentence-related credits only where an inmate has a legitimate expectation of receiving such credits.Â  See Bd. of Pardons v. Allen, 482 U.S. 369, 373 (1987) (citing Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 11 (1979)).Â  However, a liberty interest in sentence-related credits cannot be predicated on the unilateral expectation or hope to be released before the expiration of oneâ€™s term.Â  See Montgomery v. Anderson, 262 F.3d 641, 645 (7th Cir. 2001).Â  An inmate may obtain relief for the deprivation of sentence-related credits if he can demonstrate that â€œthe Stateâ€™s action. . . Â inevitably affect[ed] the duration of his sentence.â€ Â Â Sandin, 515 U.S. at 487. Â Generally, an inmate is not entitled to due process protection for State action that may only speculatively affect the duration of his sentence.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-210(A) provides:\r\n\tA prisoner convicted of an offense against this State, except a â€œno parole offenseâ€ as defined in Section 24-13-100, and sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections including a prisoner serving time in a local facility pursuant to a designated facility agreement authorized by Section 24-3-30, whose record of conduct shows that he has faithfully observed all the rules of the institution where he is confined and has not been subjected to punishment for misbehavior, is entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence beginning with the day on which the service of his sentence commences to run, computed at the rate of twenty days for each month served. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn Busby v. Moore, this Court found that the legislature intended Â§ 24-13-210(A) to reward inmates with good-time credits only after they exhibit good behavior.Â  330 S.C. 201, 204, 498 S.E.2d 883, 884 (1998), overruled in part on other grounds by Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 369, 527 S.E.2d 742, 750 (1999).Â Â  Additionally, this Court found that a prisonerâ€™s entitlement to good-time credits pursuant to Â§ 24-13-210(A) did not vest until the prisoner had served the appropriate amount of time and actually earned the credits.Â  Id. at 204, 498 S.E.2d at 885.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nIn this case, Furtick was reprimanded for the violation of prison rules.Â  A collateral result of this reprimand was that Furtick was ineligible to earn his good-time credits during the month in which he was reprimanded.Â  Because Furtick did not lose any earned good-time credits as a result of the reprimand, in my view, we cannot say that the reprimand inevitably effected the duration of his sentence.Â \r\n \r\nA myriad of considerations affect whether an inmate is released before the conclusion of the original sentence.Â  In my view, Furtickâ€™s situation is markedly different from the situation where an inmate has already earned good-time credit and, by virtue of some punishment, is required to forfeit that credit.Â  In that case, the inmate no longer possesses merely a unilateral hope of a sentence reduction, but actually possesses a vested right to the good-time credit and reduction in sentence.Â  As we stated in Al-Shabazz, the withholding or forfeiture of earned good-time credit directly implicates a protected liberty interest.Â  338 S.C. at 370, 527 S.E.2d at 750. Â In contrast, the loss of the opportunity to earn good-time credit as a result of a prison rule violation does not implicate the same interest. \r\n \r\nBecause the statute grants inmates good-time credit only after inmates demonstrate good behavior, no inmate is guaranteed or has a vested right in the maximum accrual of good-time credit.Â  Accordingly, I would find that an inmate does not have a legitimate expectation that he will receive good-time credits, but merely possesses only the hope that his behavior and observation of prison rules will be sufficient to entitle him to a reduction in his sentence.Â  Based on the language in Â§ 24-13-210(A) and our previous interpretation of the statute, I would hold that an inmate does not have a protected liberty interest in unearned good-time credits.Â  To hold otherwise would clearly frustrate the purpose and intent of the legislature in enacting the statute.Â \r\n \r\nAn analysis of Â§ 24-13-230(A) reveals a similar conclusion.Â Â  The statute provides:\r\n\r\n\tThe Director of the Department of Corrections may allow any prisoner in the custody of the department, except a prisoner convicted of a â€œno parole offenseâ€ as defined in Section 24-13-100, who is assigned to a productive duty assignment or who is regularly enrolled and actively participating in an academic, technical, or vocational training program, a reduction from the term of his sentence of zero to one day for every two days he is employed or enrolled. A maximum annual credit for both work credit and education credit is limited to one hundred eighty days.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-230(A).\r\nLike Â§24-13-210, I would find that Â§ 24-13-230(A) is clear and unambiguous.Â  In my opinion, the legislatureâ€™s use of the word â€œmayâ€ indicates its intention that any reduction in sentence pursuant to Â§ 24-13-230(A) be left to the discretion of DOC.Â Â  See Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Pageland, 321 S.C. 538, 543, 471 S.E.2d 137, 140 (1996) ( holding that when a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its literal meaning).Â  Stated differently, there is no mandatory requirement that any inmate receive a reduction in sentence under this statute.Â  In fact, despite an inmateâ€™s participation in the programs outlined in the statute, DOC has the discretion to award no sentence reduction at all.Â  Accordingly, I believe that any sentence reduction allowed pursuant to Â§ 24-13-230(A) is not an unfulfilled entitlement, but is completely discretionary.Â  See Skipper v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, 370 S.C. 267, 633 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Because an inmate is not entitled to earn credit at a particular level, in my view, an inmate has no protected liberty interest in maintaining a specific work credit level for sentence reduction purposes.Â Â  Cf. Altizer v. Paderick, 569 F.2d 812, 813 (4th Cir. 1978) (finding that classifications and work assignments are discretionary matters for prison administration and â€œto hold that they are â€˜within reach of the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause would place the Clause astride the day-to-day functioning of state prisons and involve the judiciary in issues and discretionary decisions that are not the businessâ€™â€ of the judiciary) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\n \r\nTherefore, I would hold that the circuit court did not err in finding no implication of protected liberty interests in the loss of the opportunity to earn sentence-related credits pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 24-13-210 and -230.Â \r\n \r\nFinally, while I agree with the majority that the circuit court erred in holding that the ALC lacked subject matter jurisdiction, I would find that no hearing was required under these circumstances.Â  Pursuant to this Courtâ€™s decision in Slezak v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, 361 S.C. 327, 331, 605 S.E.2d 506, 508 (2004), the ALC has jurisdiction over all properly perfected inmate appeals.Â  However, the ALC may summarily decide those appeals that do not implicate an inmateâ€™s liberty or property interest and decline to hold a hearing.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nDOC does not dispute that Furtick has properly perfected his appeal.Â  Therefore, in my view, the ALC erred in dismissing Furtickâ€™s case on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 100, 610 S.E.2d 494, 499 (2005) (noting that subject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong).Â  Because I would find that Furtick has no protected liberty interest in unearned sentence-related credits pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 24-13-210(A) and -230(A), I believe the ALC may have summarily decided his appeal without a hearing.Â  Therefore, I would hold that the ALCâ€™s improper dismissal of Furtickâ€™s claim constitutes harmless error.\r\nThe federal courts have recognized that, for many prisoners, prolific litigation is a costless pastime.Â  With todayâ€™s decision, this Court unnecessarily throws open the door to judicial review of most any conceivable prison administrative matter virtually assuring this pastime will rapidly become all the more treasured.Â \r\n \r\nThus, with the modification described above, I would affirm the circuit courtâ€™s decision.\r\n\r\n[1] According to Furtick, DOC guards entered his cell and seized numerous items of property, including his typewriter, various office supplies, and bleach.Â  It appears the possession of contraband rule infraction was based on the possession of bleach.\r\n[2] As to the facts of the petitionerâ€™s claims in Al-Shabazz, they involved his custody status and the loss of good-time credits incurred as a result of a major disciplinary proceeding.Â  We held that these claims were non-collateral or administrative matters that could not be raised in a PCR application, but could be reviewed under the APA after the DOC reached its final decision.Â  Al-Shabazz,&nbsp; 338 S.C. at 383, 527 S.E.2d at 757.\r\n[3] Regarding Slezakâ€™s grievance which asserted that the prisonâ€™s practice of â€œtriple cellingâ€ constituted a security and health hazard to inmates, the Slezak Court remanded to the ALC for a hearing because it â€œadequately state[d] a violation of appellantâ€™s liberty interest.â€Â  Slezak,Â  361 S.C. at 333, 605 S.E.2d at 508-09.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26365","title":"Smiley v.

Krawcheck, of Krawcheck &amp; Davidson, of Charleston, for Respondent Wild Dunes Community Association.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  We granted certiorari to review a Court of Appealsâ€™ decision upholding a finding that petitioner (Smiley) lacked standing to challenge a permit issued by respondent DHECâ€™s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) to respondent Wild Dunes. [1]Â  Smiley v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health and Envtâ€™l Control, Op. No. 2005-UP-160 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 7, 2005).Â  We reverse and remand the matter to the Administrative Law Court Division (ALCD).\r\nFACTS\r\nOCRM issued a permit allowing Wild Dunes to periodically excavate sand from the public intertidal beach at the Isle of Palms, if and when erosion occurs, and to transport the sand to Wild Dunesâ€™ private property.Â  This â€œbeach sand scrapingâ€ permit allows Wild Dunes to remove up to 25,000 cubic yards each month from November through April for five years, with the possibility of five-year extensions.Â  The permit limits the depth of scraping to 18 inches: according to calculations in the record, if the maximum amount of sand were extracted, it would affect over ten acres of beach per month.Â  Put another way, if the intertidal beach is assumed to be 300 feet wide, then a â€œfull monthly scrapingâ€ would extend over a space more than 1,400 feet long by 300 feet wide, to a depth of 1 Â½ feet.\r\n \r\nFollowing the issuance of the Wild Dunes permit, Smiley requested a contested case hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), relying upon S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-150 and 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-6(A).Â  At that time, Â§ 48-39-150 provided:[2]\r\n\r\n\tAny person adversely affected by the [OCRMâ€™s] staffâ€™s initial permitting application decision has the right to file a request for a contested case hearing before an administrative law judge.\r\n\r\nOCRM filed a motion to dismiss alleging Smiley lacked standing.Â  The ALJ granted the motion, and her ruling was upheld by the Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel, the circuit court, and the Court of Appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding Smiley lacked standing to contest the Wild Dunes permit?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe â€œirreducible constitutional minimum of standingâ€ has three components:\r\n\r\n\tFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an â€œinjury in factâ€ - an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) â€œactual or imminent, not â€˜conjecturalâ€™ or â€˜hypothetical.â€™â€Â  Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of - the injury has to be â€œfairlyâ€¦trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and notâ€¦th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.â€Â  Third, it must be â€œlikely,â€ as opposed to merely â€œspeculative,â€ that the injury will be â€œredressed by a favorable decision.â€\r\n\tLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561 (1992) (internal citations omitted) (Lujan); \r\n\tSea Pines Assâ€™n for the Protection of Wildlife, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Resources, 345 S.C. 594, 550 S.E.2d 287 (2001) (Sea Pines).\r\n\r\nThe ALJâ€™s conclusion, affirmed by the appellate tribunals, that Smiley lacks standing to maintain this action is predicated upon a finding that he cannot meet the first Lujan/Sea Pines element: that he â€œhas suffered an â€˜â€œinjury in factâ€ - an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularizedâ€¦and (b) â€œactual or imminent,â€ not â€˜conjecturalâ€™ or â€˜hypothetical.â€™â€Â  Lujan, supra; Sea Pines, supra.Â  In this setting, â€˜particularizedâ€™ means Smiley must be affected in a personal and individualized way by the permitting decision.Â  Id.\r\nSmiley alleged the following facts by affidavit to meet his burden of demonstrating standing:\r\n\r\n\tI am partially disabled with paralysis of muscles in both legs as a result of a spinal cord injury in 1979.Â  After my release from the hospital in late 1979, I began a course of rehabilitation which continues today and involves jogging on the flat hard public beach on the Isle of Palms.Â  I use the beach in area[s] where sand will be excavated and which is the subject of this proceeding on an almost daily basis.Â  My uses of this beach are for recreation and rehabilitation, including walking, jogging, nature-watching and similar pursuits.Â  Additionally, as an ardent conservationist, responsible citizen and professional biologist, I feel a duty to do my part in preserving and protecting [the] beach/dune system of the Isle of Palms.\r\n\tThe intrusion of heavy equipment into the public beach and the consequent excavation of sand from the intertidal zone will make it impossible to jog on the beach in the affected area and it will reduce my enjoyment of the beach.Â  FrontEnd [sic] Loaders excavating sand from the beach and bulldozers pushing the sand up onto private property all have a detrimental effect on my aesthetic, conservational and recreational interest and values and will reduce or make impossible my ability to use the beach.\r\n\r\n1.Â  â€œActual or imminentâ€\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that Smiley failed to meet the requirement that the injury be actual or imminent because while the permit has been issued, no sand has yet been scraped.Â  The court cited its decision in Beaufort Realty Co. v. Beaufort County, 346 S.C. 298, 551 S.E.2d 588 (Ct. App. 2001) (Beaufort Realty) as authority for the holding that until the permit was acted upon, Smiley lacked standing.Â  Smiley contends Beaufort Realty was misapplied.Â  We agree.\r\nIn Beaufort Realty, the zoning administrator examined plats filed by Beaufort Realty, and determined that by virtue of the size of the lots and the ingress/egress requirements outlined in the plats, the properties were exempt from a subdivision ordinance.Â  The Court of Appeals held that the conservation group challenging the zoning administratorâ€™s decision to exempt the properties lacked standing as it alleged no injury as a result of the exemption, but instead merely alleged its members would suffer injuries if the properties were someday developed.Â  The conservation group lacked standing as the alleged harm was neither â€œactual nor imminent,â€ it was merely â€œhypothetical or conjectural.â€ In addition to finding the conservation group could not meet the first Lujan/Sea Pines prong, the Beaufort Realty court held the conservation group could not meet the second standing requirement since there was no causal connection between the mere filing of the plats and the alleged potential future harm.Â  Beaufort Realty at 306, 551 S.E.2d at 590.\r\nSmiley argues, and we agree, that to read Beaufort Realty as denying standing to an individual unless and until the â€œinjuryâ€ has been inflicted ignores the â€œactual or imminentâ€ requirement of Lujan/Sea Pines and elevates dicta in Beaufort Realty over its two holdings: that the environmental group was asserting speculative concerns rather than injury, and had failed to demonstrate a causal connection.Â  See e.g. Commander Health Facilities, Inc. v. DHEC, 370 S.C. 296, 634 S.E.2d 664 (Ct. App. 2006) (characterizing Beaufort Realty as requiring either a direct injury or the immediate danger of direct injury).Â  We hold that Smiley has adequately demonstrated that his injury is â€œactual and imminentâ€ for purposes of standing.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that his challenge to the Wild Dunes permit is premature is reversed.\r\nB. â€œInjury in factâ€\r\nIn a rather confusing paragraph, the Court of Appeals first states that â€œSmiley has failed to demonstrate how the proposed project will prevent his enjoyment of the beach,â€ apparently a finding Smiley has failed to allege â€œa concrete and particularized invasionâ€ of a legally protected interest.Â  The averments in Smileyâ€™s affidavit that he recreates and views nature on the beach on an almost daily basis is a sufficient allegation of a â€œconcrete and particularized invasion.â€Â  As the United States Supreme Court held:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œInjury in factâ€ reflects the statutory requirement that a person be â€œadversely affectedâ€ or â€œaggrieved,â€ and it serves to distinguish a person with a direct stake in the outcome of a litigation - even though small - from a person with a mere interest in the problem.Â  We have allowed important interests to be vindicated by plaintiffs with no more at stake in the outcome of an action than a fraction of a vote,â€¦a $5 fine and costs,â€¦and a $1.50 poll taxâ€¦.Â  [W]e see no reason to adopt a more restrictive interpretation of â€œadversely affectedâ€ or â€œaggrieved.â€Â \r\n\t\r\n\tU.S. v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures, 412 U.S. 669 (1973) (SCRAP).\r\n\r\nFollowing the statement that Smiley failed to demonstrate how his enjoyment of the beach would be affected, the Court of Appeals went on to say â€œSmileyâ€™s use and enjoyment will be only temporarily alteredâ€ in that â€œhis injury, at best, will be a temporary detour in his jogging route and does not compare to the permanent injury in [citation omitted]â€¦However, even a permanent injury does not assure a plaintiff will have standing [citing Sea Pines][3]â€¦petitionerâ€™s temporary inconvenience does not give rise to standing.â€Â  This is apparently a finding that Smiley failed to allege a sufficient â€œinjury in fact.â€\r\nWe are unaware of any legal basis for the Court of Appealsâ€™ distinction of a temporary injury from a permanent injury. Â Moreover, OCRM presented no evidence in opposition to Smileyâ€™s affidavit.Â  There is simply nothing in this record to support the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion that any inconvenience will be merely temporary.Â  The court is then critical of Smileyâ€™s averments of injury characterizing them as a temporary detour in his jogging route and ignoring the other â€œuse and enjoymentâ€ claims made in the affidavit.Â  Interference with Smileyâ€™s enjoyment of the beach, and his inability to use it for his rehabilitative jogging for at least six months a year for at least the next five years, are sufficient allegations of a â€œstake in the outcomeâ€ to permit Smiley standing to challenge the permit.Â  SCRAP, supra. \r\n \r\nWe reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that Smiley merely alleged â€œtemporary inconvenience,â€ and that his allegations are insufficient.Â  Smileyâ€™s affidavit demonstrates that he has a direct stake in the permitting decision, and therefore he sufficiently alleges standing. Â Lujan, supra; Sea Pines, supra.\r\nThe Court of Appeals went on to discuss the Public Trust Doctrine and beach renourishment statutes, and conclude that â€œThe excavation of sand does not substantially impair the public interest and is within the Stateâ€™s policy of preserving and restoring its beaches, thus [Smiley] has failed to demonstrate how the permit would violate these protections.â€Â  We vacate, in its entirety, this speculative ruling on the merits of Smileyâ€™s claims, which are not germane to the standing issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision affirming the rulings that Smiley lacked standing to challenge the Wild Dunes permit, and remand the matter to the ALCD for further proceedings.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Wild Dunes and OCRM have filed a joint brief in this matter.Â  We will refer to the respondents as OCRM in the opinion.\r\n[2] The statutory scheme was substantially altered in 2006 to conform to the new ALJ/Court of Appeals appellate review scheme.Â  See 2006 Act No. 387.\r\n[3] We note that Sea Pines did not involve a finding of permanent injury with a concomitant denial of standing.Â  Rather, the Court held the plaintiffs presented no evidence that their interest in viewing wildlife would be diminished by the permits, and thus failed to demonstrate â€œany particularized harm.â€Â  Sea Pines, at 606, 550 S.E.2d at 292.Â  Moreover, the Court held that, assuming the Sea Pines plaintiffs had shown an injury, they â€œfailed to present evidence the injury would be redressed by a favorable decisionâ€¦.,â€ Id., that is, they failed to meet the third Lujan standing requirement as well as the first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26366","title":"State v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Petitioner was convicted of murder and possession of a weapon during commission of a violent crime.Â  He was sentenced to concurrent imprisonment terms of thirty years for murder and five years for possession of a weapon during a violent crime.Â  His convictions and sentences were upheld on direct appeal by the Court of Appeals.Â  State v. Weaver, 361 S.C. 73, 602 S.E.2d 786 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 23, 1999, Marion McKnight was shot thirteen times outside a club and died at the scene.Â  Investigator Sandy Thompson arrived up to an hour after the shooting occurred.Â  Thompson spoke with witnesses still at the club and his investigation led him to search for petitioner.\r\nThompson received information that petitioner was at the home of his cousin, Arnold Weaver.Â  Thompson and other investigators arrived at Arnoldâ€™s home and found the Jeep, which petitioner was driving earlier that night, in the back yard.Â  Arnold testified petitioner had been at his home, and had asked for a change of clothes, some bleach, and a garbage bag.Â  He left Arnoldâ€™s home less than an hour later.[1]  \r\nUpon finding the Jeep, Thompson and another officer testified Thompson opened the door of the Jeep.Â  After finding the inside of the Jeep was wet and smelled of bleach, Thompson shut the door.Â  The investigators found â€œa bag of washâ€ that smelled like bleach on a pump house near the Jeep.Â  Based on this evidence, the Jeep was impounded and towed to the county jail.\r\nAfter the Jeep had been impounded, a SLED agent processed the Jeep.Â  The agent testified he found blood in the Jeep in several places, including the interior of the driverâ€™s side door, just below the rear window on the driverâ€™s side, on a chamois cloth found on the back seat of the car, on a keychain found in the ignition, and on the gear shift.Â  The blood matched that of the victim.Â  Further, the rear cargo area was wet and smelled of bleach.Â  This area was positive for blood as well but could not be tested.\r\nPrior to trial, defense counsel moved to suppress the evidence taken from the Jeep.Â  The State noted officers obtained a search warrant before searching the Jeep for blood evidence but after it was impounded in a secure location.Â  However, the return was never made on the warrant as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003).Â  The State indicated they were not relying on the search warrant, but were instead contending it was a valid warrantless search.Â  Therefore, the trial judge analyzed the question of the propriety of the search of the Jeep as if no warrant had been obtained.Â  The trial judge preliminarily ruled the seizure of the Jeep was proper without a warrant, that the search was lawful, and that the evidence was admissible.\r\nPrior to the introduction of Agent Lambertâ€™s testimony regarding the blood evidence, an in camera hearing was held to revisit the admissibility of the testimony.Â  Following the hearing, the judge denied petitionerâ€™s motion to suppress.Â  He stated there was no requirement that a warrantless search occur contemporaneously with the seizure for the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment to apply.Â  Because he found the warrantless search was proper, the trial judge refused to rule as to whether the officersâ€™ failure to provide a return rendered the search warrant ineffective.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the Court of Appeals err by upholding the trial courtâ€™s refusal to suppress evidence found in the vehicle petitioner was driving?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues the evidence found in the Jeep should have been suppressed.Â  He contends the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement is inapplicable in this case and, therefore, the State was required to obtain and properly execute a search warrant prior to obtaining evidence from the Jeep.Â  Petitioner states that because the State did not produce a return as required under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003), the search warrant was invalid and the search of the Jeep was unlawful.Â  In addition, he argues the search violated his rights under Article 1, Â§ 10, of the South Carolina Constitution, because that section provides greater protection than that provided by the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\r\nWhen reviewing a Fourth Amendment search and seizure case, an appellate court must affirm the trial judgeâ€™s ruling if there is any evidence to support the ruling.Â  State v. Missouri, 361 S.C. 107, 603 S.E.2d 594 (2004). Â The appellate court will reverse only when there is clear error. Â Id.\r\n\r\n\tA.&nbsp; Was the warrantless search of the Jeep proper pursuant to the automobile exception?\r\n\r\nEvidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from trial.Â  State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 620 S.E.2d 737 (2005), cert. denied, Â Â Â Â Â U.S. Â Â Â Â , 126 S.Ct. 2287 (2006).Â  Generally, a warrantless search is per se unreasonable and violates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. Â Id.Â  However, a warrantless search will withstand constitutional scrutiny where the search falls within one of several well-recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.Â  Id.Â  One such exception is the automobile exception.Â  State v. Bailey, 276 S.C. 32, 274 S.E.2d 913 (1981).Â  The burden is upon the prosecution to establish probable cause and the existence of circumstances constituting an exception to the general prohibition against warrantless searches.Â  State v. Freiburger, supra.\r\nPursuant to the automobile exception, if there is probable cause to search a vehicle, a warrant is not necessary so long as the search is based on facts that would justify the issuance of a warrant, even though a warrant has not been actually obtained.Â  Maryland v. Dyson, 527 U.S. 465 (1999).Â  The automobile exception to the search warrant requirement is based on: Â (1) the ready mobility of automobiles and the potential that evidence may be lost or destroyed before a warrant is obtained and (2) the lessened expectation of privacy in motor vehicles which are subject to government regulation.Â  State v. Cox, 290 S.C. 489, 351 S.E.2d 570 (1986).Â  The automobile exception does not contain a separate exigency requirement.Â  Maryland v. Dyson, supra.Â  If a vehicle is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment permits police to search the vehicle without more.Â  Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U.S. 938 (1996).\r\nIn the instant case, there was probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of the Jeep.Â  Investigators knew that petitioner, a suspect in McKnightâ€™s murder, had been seen driving the Jeep around the time of the murder.Â Â  Upon finding the Jeep, it seemed apparent there had been an attempt to destroy evidence given the Jeepâ€™s interior was wet and smelled of bleach.Â  Therefore, upon finding the Jeep, the investigators could have conducted the search at that time; however, they chose to impound the vehicle.\r\nThe fact investigators chose to wait to search the Jeep after it had already been impounded does not affect the propriety of the warrantless search because there is no requirement that the warrantless search of a vehicle occur contemporaneously with its lawful seizure.Â  United States v. Johns, 469 U.S. 478 (1985) (upholding warrantless search that occurred three days after seizure).Â  See also Florida v. Myers, 466 U.S. 380 (1984) (warrantless search of vehicle, which was impounded and in police custody, conducted several hours after valid initial search conducted at time of defendantâ€™s arrest, was proper); Cooper v. State of California,&nbsp;386 U.S. 58 (1967) (it is no answer to say the police could have obtained a search warrant, for the relevant test is not whether it is reasonable to procure a search warrant, but whether the search was reasonable).Â  The justification to conduct such a warrantless search does not vanish once the car has been immobilized. Â United State v. Johns, supra.\r\nAccordingly, the warrantless search meets the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment.Â  However, before concluding the evidence recovered from the Jeep is admissible, we must examine petitionerâ€™s argument that our state constitution provides him with greater protection.\r\n\r\n\tB. Does the State constitution provide greater protection than the United States Constitution?\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues that the search and seizure of the Jeep violates the state constitution because of the location of the Jeep when it was seized, i.e. in the back yard of a private residence.Â  He argues the invasion of his privacy was not reasonable based on that fact.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures:Â  â€œThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . . .â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  The South Carolina Constitution also provides a safeguard against unlawful searches and seizures.Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d 837&nbsp;(2001) (citing S.C. Const. art. I. Â§ 10).Â  The relationship between the two constitutions is significant because â€œ[s]tate courts may afford more expansive rights under state constitutional provisions than the rights which are conferred by the Federal Constitution.â€Â  Id. (quoting State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 131, n. 13, 489 S.E.2d 617, 625, n. 13 (1997)).Â  Therefore, this Court may interpret the state protection against unreasonable searches and seizures in such a way as to provide greater protection than the federal Constitution.Â  Id.\r\nIn addition to language that mirrors the Fourth Amendment, S.C. Const. art. 1 Â§ 10 contains an express protection of the right to privacy: â€œThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures and unreasonable invasions of privacy shall not be violated . . . .â€Â  State v. Forrester, supra (emphasis added).Â  By articulating a specific prohibition against â€œunreasonable invasions of privacy,â€ the people of South Carolina have indicated that searches and seizures that do not offend the federal Constitution may still offend the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the South Carolina Constitution favors an interpretation offering a higher level of privacy protection than the Fourth Amendment.Â  Id.\r\nThe question is whether this privacy provision goes so far as to require a warrant before the search and seizure of a vehicle located in the back yard of a private residence. Â We find there is no meaningful distinction to be made between vehicles parked in public and private places.[2]Â  See State v. Cox, 290 S.C. 489, 351 S.E.2d 570 (1986) (finding seizure of shotgun from trunk of murder defendantâ€™s vehicle, which was parked in yard of his house at time of search, was valid under automobile exception to warrant requirement).Â  The focus in the state constitution is on whether the invasion of privacy is reasonable, regardless of the personâ€™s expectation of privacy in the vehicle to be searched.Â  Once the officers have probable cause to search a vehicle, the state constitutionâ€™s requirement that the invasion of oneâ€™s privacy be reasonable will be met.Â  We find the invasion of petitionerâ€™s privacy was reasonable because the officers had probable cause to search where petitioner had apparently used the Jeep to leave the scene of a murder and attempted to destroy evidence of the crime that was located inside the Jeep.Â  Accordingly, the search of the Jeep satisfied the requirements of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\n\r\n\tC.&nbsp; Was the Search Warrant Valid?\r\n\r\nBecause the automobile exception applies in this case and the warrantless search of the vehicle was proper, it is unnecessary to address whether the warrant was invalid because a return was not made.Â  However, we address this issue to correct the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling on this issue.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003) requires search warrants to be executed and return made within ten days after the date of the warrant.[3]Â  The failure to observe the ten-day requirement for the execution and return of a warrant, a ministerial requirement, does not necessarily void the warrant.Â  State v. Wise, 272 S.C. 384, 252 S.E.2d 294 (1979).Â  The warrant will be invalidated only if the defendant can show he was prejudiced by the failure.Â  Id.Â  See also State v. Mollison, 319 S.C. 41, 459 S.E.2d 88 (Ct. App. 1995) (failure to comply with inconsequential ministerial requirements of the statute does not require suppression in the absence of prejudice to the defendant).\r\nThe Court of Appeals held the Stateâ€™s failure to produce a return constituted more than a ministerial error.Â  We find the Court of Appeals erred because petitioner did not show he was prejudiced by the Stateâ€™s failure to comply with the return requirement.Â  See State v. Wise, supra (warrant not voided where appellant failed to show he was prejudiced by Stateâ€™s failure to return warrant to issuing magistrate within ten-day period); State v. Mollison, supra (evidence not suppressed where appellants did not argue they were prejudiced in any way by the failure to return the warrant within ten days).Â  Accordingly, the Stateâ€™s failure to comply with the statutory ministerial requirement does not void the warrant and the evidence can not be excluded on this ground.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that if the requirements of probable cause and ready mobility are met, then the search is permissible pursuant to the State constitution and the United States Constitution.Â  Because we find the search was a proper warrantless search, it is unnecessary to determine whether the Stateâ€™s failure to make a return rendered the warrant ineffective.Â  However, we note that where the defendant fails to argue he was prejudiced by the Stateâ€™s failure to comply with the return requirement, the warrant will not be voided and evidence cannot be excluded on that ground.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nWALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â Â Â Â Â Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s conclusion that the warrantless search and seizure in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article I, section 10 of the South Carolina Constitution which prohibits unreasonable invasions of privacy.Â  I also agree that the Stateâ€™s failure to produce a return to the search warrant did not invalidate the warrant in this case.Â  I write separately, however, because I disagree with the majorityâ€™s analysis of the vehicle seizure under the South Carolina Constitution.\r\nThe automobile exception to the search warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution is based on: (1) the ready mobility of automobiles and (2) the lessened expectation of privacy in motor vehicles which are subject to government regulation.Â  California v. Carney, 471 U.S. 386 (1985).Â  The South Carolina Constitution specifically prohibits â€œunreasonable invasions of privacy,â€ and this Court has stated, as the majority recognizes, that our constitution â€œfavors an interpretation offering a higher level of privacy protection than the Fourth Amendment.â€Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 541 S.E.2d 837 (2001).\r\nIn determining whether South Carolinaâ€™s privacy provision requires a warrant before the search and seizure of a vehicle located in the backyard of a private residence, the majority focuses on one justification for the automobile exception: the inherent mobility of the vehicle.Â  This analysis is incomplete.Â  We must further analyze the impact of this provision on the second prong of a Fourth Amendment automobile analysis, that is, the expectation of privacy in a private automobile.Â  A holding that â€œthe inherent mobility of the vehicle is all that is required to satisfy the state constitutionâ€ implies a lower degree of protection than that provided by the Fourth Amendment when addressing warrantless searches and seizures.Â  This conflicts with our prior cases.Â  See Forrester, supra.\r\nFurthermore, the majorityâ€™s reliance on State v. Cox, 290 S.C. 489, 351 S.E.2d 570 (1986), is, in my opinion, misplaced.Â  The search and seizure issue in Cox was analyzed solely under the Fourth Amendment and did not discuss Article I, section 10 of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Moreover, search and seizure cases analyzed under the Fourth Amendment have made distinctions between vehicles parked in public and private places.Â  See G.M. Leasing Corp. v. U.S., 429 U.S. 338, 351-52 (1977) (holding the warrantless seizure of vehicles did not violate the Fourth Amendment because â€œ[t]he seizures of the automobiles in this case took place on public streets, parking lots, or other open places, and did not involve any invasion of privacy.â€); Florida v. White, 526 U.S. 559 (1999) (noting the distinction between a warrantless seizure in an open area and a seizure made on private premises and concluding that because the police seized respondentâ€™s vehicle from a public area, the warrantless seizure did not involve any invasion of respondentâ€™s privacy); and Binder v. Redford Tp. Police Dept., 93 Fed.Appx. 701 (6th Cir. 2004) (â€œAlthough probable cause suffices for the search or seizure of vehicles parked on public property [or even private property that is accessible to the public], no Supreme Court decision allows warrantless entry into areas of a home or business where the owner has a reasonable expectation of privacy simply because the police are in search of an automobile.â€) (citing G.M. Leasing Corp., supra).\r\nAnalysis of the facts of this case with our privacy provision in mind reveals no state constitutional violation.Â  Although oneâ€™s expectation of privacy in his automobile increases when that automobile is parked in the backyard of his private residence, the petitioner in this case was not the owner of the Jeep that was seized.[4]Â  More importantly, the vehicle was not parked at petitionerâ€™s residence.Â  \r\n \r\nOur state constitutionâ€™s provision protecting unreasonable invasions of privacy necessarily requires some analysis of the privacy interests involved when a warrantless seizure is made on private property.Â  However, petitioner cannot show he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the seized Jeep.Â  Accordingly, I concur in the result reached by the majority.\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioner turned himself in during the early morning hours of June 24. \r\n \r\n[2] The concurrence asserts that search and seizure cases analyzed under the Fourth Amendment have made distinctions between vehicles parked in public and private places.Â  However, there has never been a clear statement by the United States Supreme Court that a warrant is required before a vehicle is searched in a private place.Â  In fact, the Fourth Circuit has stated there should not be a bright-line rule that the automobile exception may never apply when a vehicle is stationed on private, residential property.Â  United States v. Brookins, 345 F.3d 231, 237 (4th Cir. 2003).\r\n[3] â€œ. . . Any warrant issued hereunder shall be executed and return made only within ten days after it is dated. The officer executing the warrant shall make and deliver a signed inventory of any articles seized by virtue of the warrant, which shall be delivered to the judicial officer to whom the return is to be made, and if a copy of the inventory is demanded by the person from whose person or premises the property is taken, a copy of the inventory shall be delivered to him. . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003).\r\n[4] The record reveals that petitioner was one of several family members who had permission to use the Jeep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
