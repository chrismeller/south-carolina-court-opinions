In this adoption case, the prospective adoptive parents,\r\n  John and Jane Doe, appeal the family courtâ€™s orders:Â  (1) revoking Laura\r\n  McCannâ€™s (the biological motherâ€™s) consent for adoption because it was\r\n  involuntarily entered; and (2) finding the revocation of the consent would be\r\n  in the best interest of the child and placing the child back with McCann.Â  We\r\n  note both the Does and McCann love and take excellent care of the child.Â \r\n  However, our review of the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s decision to\r\n  revoke McCannâ€™s consent to adopt and to return the child to McCann.Â   \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn the afternoon of Wednesday, July 19,\r\n  2006, thirty-year-old McCann drove herself to Hilton Head Regional Medical Center while in labor.Â  At the time, McCann had several emotional stressors in her\r\n  life, including:Â  (1) her boyfriend had died tragically in a car accident two\r\n  years prior; (2) her father had died from pancreatic cancer the prior year; (3)\r\n  the pregnancy was the result of a rape; (4) she hid her pregnancy from her\r\n  mother, sister, friends, and coworkers because she was ashamed and afraid of\r\n  their reaction; and (5) she had lost her job during her pregnancy when the restaurant\r\n  she managed closed down.Â  Although McCann initially informed the hospital staff\r\n  that she had prenatal care in New York, she later admitted she had not had\r\n  prenatal care.Â  McCann indicated on the hospital intake forms that she:Â  had a\r\n  bachelorâ€™s degree; worked as a waitress; was of Catholic faith; did not have\r\n  plans to place the child for adoption; and desired contact with the child.Â  She\r\n  did not have anyone with her during her delivery and did not want anyone called\r\n  on her behalf.Â   \r\nMcCann delivered a healthy baby girl\r\n  around 5:00 p.m. that same day.Â  However, McCann did not respond to the child,\r\n  touch the child, or look at her when the child was placed on McCannâ€™s chest.Â \r\n  McCann did not want to see the child later in the nursery.Â  Nurse Wendy Yemec thought\r\n  McCannâ€™s flat response to the baby was not normal, and the treating\r\n  obstetrician ordered a social work consult.Â  McCann was very tearful and\r\n  remained so for the rest of her hospital stay.\r\nOn Thursday, July 20, 2006, McCann had\r\n  several evaluations.Â  Dr. Ann Gorman, the obstetrician in charge of post-partum\r\n  care, noted McCann was tearful and learned of McCannâ€™s stressors.Â  McCann briefly\r\n  mentioned adoption to Dr. Gorman.[1]Â  Although she did not diagnose McCann with post-partum\r\n  depression, Dr. Gorman was concerned that McCann did not have any apparent\r\n  support system, believed McCann might be at risk for post-partum depression,\r\n  and ordered a psychiatric consultation with Dr. Srivastava.Â   \r\nThat same morning, Judy Hewes[2] performed the social work evaluation on\r\n  McCann to determine what kind of support system McCann had and what kind of\r\n  prenatal care McCann had been given.Â  The two discussed the stressors in\r\n  McCannâ€™s life and Hewes provided McCann with names and telephone numbers of\r\n  adoption agencies per McCannâ€™s request.Â  Hewes informed McCann that she had\r\n  positive experiences with adoption because two of her siblings were adopted.\r\n \r\nHewesâ€™ conversation with McCann was\r\n  interrupted when Dr. Srivastava entered the room to perform a psychological\r\n  evaluation.Â  The examination was for the sole purpose of determining whether\r\n  McCann required further hospitalization for psychological issues due to her\r\n  incessant crying; he did not evaluate McCann for the purpose of determining\r\n  whether she could knowingly and intelligently consent to the relinquishment of\r\n  her child for adoption.Â  After speaking with McCann for less than an hour, Dr.\r\n  Srivastava determined that, although she had significant stressors in her life,\r\n  she did not have significant depression requiring hospitalization.Â  He\r\n  recommended follow-up therapy without medication.Â  Dr. Srivastava diagnosed\r\n  McCann with â€œsignificant adjustment disorder,â€ between anxiety and depression,\r\n  with a functioning level, or GAF score of 50, which meant partial insight.Â \r\n  Although he noted that a GAF score of below 50 would require hospitalization,\r\n  he testified that â€œpartial insightâ€ meant fair insight within the normal range\r\n  and not significantly impaired.Â  He stated the diagnosis of adjustment disorder\r\n  did not impair judgment.Â  Although McCann did not discuss adoption in detail,\r\n  she told Dr. Srivastava she was considering adoption, she would â€œfeel ok about\r\n  it,â€ and she did not have enough resources to care for a baby.Â  Dr. Srivastava\r\n  testified he did not think social stressors would generally affect decision\r\n  making, and he had no concerns about McCannâ€™s ability to make decisions.Â  Dr.\r\n  Srivastava did not diagnose McCann with post-partum depression because the\r\n  illness does not generally manifest until some time after delivery, and he did not\r\n  see signs of post-partum depression in McCann.Â  According to Dr. Srivastava,\r\n  McCann was initially tearful during their meeting, she smiled at times, and she\r\n  was able to engage in the conversation and was not tearful by the end.Â   \r\nIn the afternoon on July 20th, McCann\r\n  referred to a business card given to her along with the list of adoption agency\r\n  names she requested from Hewes, and she called Helen Duschinski, director of A\r\n  Childâ€™s Future Adoptions, a private adoption agency based in Aiken, South Caroli  na.Â  McCann testified that she was just exploring options, but Duschinski\r\n  stated McCann informed her that she had a baby that she wanted to give up for\r\n  adoption and wanted to know whether there was a family with which the child\r\n  could be placed.Â  Duschinski agreed to meet with McCann the next morning at the\r\n  hospital in Hilton Head, and Duschinski contacted the Does about the baby.Â  At\r\n  some point, Nurse Yemec came in the room and overheard McCann on the phone with\r\n  Duschinski.Â  Yemec hugged McCann and told her how unselfish and brave she was\r\n  being in making the adoption decision.Â  McCann requested to see the baby for\r\n  the first time the evening of July 20th, and the baby stayed in the room with\r\n  her, for the most part, until discharge the next day.Â  McCann appeared to bond\r\n  with her baby.Â   \r\nOn the morning of Friday, July 21, 2006, Duschinski got\r\n  lost on her way to the hospital, McCann called her to find out why she was\r\n  late, and McCann gave Duschinski directions to the hospital.Â  Duschinski\r\n  testified McCann was clearly resolved in her decision to give the baby up for\r\n  adoption, and never verbalized any doubts, citing the fact that she was single\r\n  and there were societal and financial pressures associated with raising a\r\n  baby.Â  However, McCann denied having made up her mind about adoption when she\r\n  called Duschinski, but she did not know whether she had told Duschinski she\r\n  wanted to put her child up for adoption.Â  McCann believed Duschinski worked\r\n  with the Department of Social Services and would explain the process.Â  Duschinski\r\n  filled out paperwork, including medical and family history.Â  One of the\r\n  documents Duschinski had McCann sign regarded counseling and stated, â€œI\r\n  acknowledge that counseling is available to me and has been offered to me.Â  Iâ€™m\r\n  aware that counseling will be made available to me should I request it during\r\n  this pregnancy or within two weeks after delivery.â€Â  Duschinski testified\r\n  McCann was crying and laughing during their meeting, trying to lighten the room\r\n  with humor.Â  She did not think McCannâ€™s emotional reaction was unusual.Â \r\n \r\nAt that point, Duschinski left the room\r\n  and the Doesâ€™ attorney, Rick Corley, and attorney Hector Esquivel, the separate\r\n  attorney to present the consent form to McCann, entered the hospital room.Â \r\n  Corley left as Esquivel went over the consent for adoption form with McCann and\r\n  Hewes remained in the room as a witness.Â  McCann believed he was her attorney,\r\n  although his fees were being paid by the Does.Â  Esquivel testified he went\r\n  through the consent form line by line, trying to ensure that McCann understood\r\n  the form and that her consent was voluntary.Â  He stated she did not appear to\r\n  be in any unusual emotional distress, that she was teary at times, but he\r\n  believed she was comfortable and resolute.Â  McCann was holding the baby during her\r\n  meeting with Esquivel.Â   \r\nEsquivel testified he specifically went\r\n  over the sections regarding the fact that there was no waiting period, that her\r\n  decision was permanent, and that she had no right to rescission like with\r\n  financing agreements.Â  At one point he told her the only way to revoke the\r\n  consent was to go to court and explain the decision was made under duress, but\r\n  Hewes testified he responded to one of her questions by stating that McCann\r\n  could go to court to prove she was the better parent in order to â€œundo it.â€Â \r\n  Esquivel testified that he told her he would leave if she had any doubts, that\r\n  she could get either legal or other counseling and then decide at a later time\r\n  whether to proceed with the adoption, but McCann did not want counseling and seemed\r\n  to understand the gravity of the situation.Â   \r\nOne of the documents Esquivel had McCann\r\n  sign was a medical power of attorney, which stated, â€œthis limited medical power\r\n  of attorney shall expire upon the surrender of my parental rights in a court\r\n  proceeding in accordance with South Carolina law unless I earlier revoke it in\r\n  writing.â€Â  Although McCann testified that she did not listen to what Esquivel\r\n  was saying because she was looking at the baby, she admitted that she was calm\r\n  when she signed the documents.Â  McCann initialed the consent form next to the\r\n  section stating there is no revocation period.Â   \r\nAfter signing the documents, McCann\r\n  refused additional time with the child and handed the child over to Corley.Â \r\n  McCann was discharged that same Friday afternoon, drove herself home, and slept\r\n  for over a day.Â  Both Nurse Yemec and Hewes were so concerned about McCannâ€™s\r\n  emotional well-being that they separately attempted to call her at her house.Â \r\n  On Monday, July 24, 2006, McCann eventually contacted Hewes, who was afraid\r\n  that McCann might be suicidal.Â  McCann told Hewes that she had contacted the\r\n  adoption agency because she had changed her mind.Â  Duschinski, however,\r\n  testified that McCann only contacted her about â€œsome doubtsâ€ and never\r\n  indicated she wanted to revoke her consent.Â   \r\nThe adoptive parents filed a petition for\r\n  adoption on July 26, 2006.Â  McCann filed a Petition for Reversal of Consent on\r\n  July 27, 2006.Â  An emergency hearing was held on August 16, 2006, and the\r\n  family court ordered appointment of Diane Dewitt as guardian ad litem for the\r\n  baby.Â  McCann amended her complaint, and another temporary hearing was held on\r\n  September 21, 2006.Â  At that point, the family court granted McCann limited,\r\n  supervised visitation with the baby.Â Â   \r\nThe parties agreed to bifurcate the trial\r\n  to first deal with the issue of voluntariness of the consent and then to deal\r\n  with whether revocation of the consent would be in the best interest of the\r\n  child.Â  On March 1, 2007, the family court issued an order in the first portion\r\n  of the trial.Â  The family court found that, considering McCannâ€™s obvious\r\n  emotional distress, she could not have voluntarily given her consent.Â  The\r\n  court found McCann was in an unusual emotional state during her hospital stay,\r\n  the guidance she received during her hospital stay was not objective and\r\n  reflective of a realistic approach to the situation McCann faced, and the\r\n  confusing wording of the counseling form and medical power of attorney form,\r\n  coupled with Hewesâ€™ question to Esquivel, created the impression that McCann\r\n  had time to revoke.Â  The court further found that the totality of the\r\n  circumstances:Â   \r\n\r\n\tcreated such pressure or had such\r\n  influence upon Plaintiff that her signing of the document could not have been\r\n  done voluntarily and that her signing was obtained under duress or through\r\n  coercion.Â  I find these circumstances left her with the view that she had no\r\n  reasonable alternative to signing the Consent and Relinquishment and\r\n  practically destroyed her free will and caused her to do an act not of her own\r\n  volition and that her act was not the result of rational judgment on her par.Â Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe court held McCannâ€™s grant of consent\r\n  was not voluntary and ordered that McCann have more visitation with the baby\r\n  pending the outcome of the second part of the trial regarding what was in the\r\n  best interest for the child.Â   \r\nAfter the hearing on the best interest\r\n  analysis, the family court ordered that it was in the best interest of the\r\n  child for McCannâ€™s consent to be revoked and for the child to be placed with McCann.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals granted the Doesâ€™ motion for supersedeas, held a hearing,\r\n  and then issued an order vacating the supersedeas and ordering that the parties\r\n  share custody of the child on a rotating four-day basis.Â  The case is now\r\n  presently before this Court after it was certified from the Court of Appeals.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals concerning adoption\r\n  proceedings, like any appeal from family court, this Court may find the facts\r\n  in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Phillips v. Baker, 284 S.C. 134, 135, 325 S.E.2d 533, 534 (1985) (â€œAn adoption\r\n  proceeding being a matter in equity heard by the trial judge alone, this\r\n  Courtâ€™s scope of review extends to the finding of facts based on its own view\r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.â€).Â  This broad scope of review does not\r\n  require the Court to disregard the findings of the family court judge, who saw\r\n  and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility.Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652\r\n  (2006); Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 523, 599 S.E.2d 114, 118 (2004).Â \r\n  â€œThis degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the welfare and\r\n  best interests of a minor child.â€Â  Morris, 367 S.C. at 61, 624 S.E.2d at\r\n  652.Â  Â Â Â \r\nI.Â  Voluntariness of Consent\r\nThe Does argue the family court erred in finding\r\n  McCannâ€™s consent was involuntary because McCann did not prove duress, coercion,\r\n  or involuntariness; she only proved she changed her mind.[3]Â  The main question in this case is\r\n  whether the totality of the circumstances, including emotional stressors from\r\n  four significant events and McCannâ€™s confusion over the significance of the\r\n  documents she signed, amounts to signing the consent for adoption involuntarily\r\n  or pursuant to duress or coercion.Â   \r\nInitially, we take this opportunity to comment on the\r\n  relinquishment law in this state.Â  Several states, including our neighboring\r\n  states of Georgia and North Carolina, have a time period during which a\r\n  biological parent can revoke their consent to adopt without having to go to\r\n  court to prove involuntariness, duress, or coercion.Â  See Ga. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 19-8-9(b) (Supp. 2007) (giving a biological parent a ten-day period within\r\n  which he or she can withdraw the consent for adoption); N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§\r\n  48-3-706(a) (2005) (stating that a relinquishment of a child may be revoked\r\n  within a seven-day period after signing).Â  In the case of a newborn, this\r\n  relinquishment period allows a biological parent, usually the birth mother, to\r\n  contemplate her decision away from the physical and emotional effects of giving\r\n  birth.Â  After the relinquishment period, the law provides that a biological\r\n  parent may not revoke her consent unless she proves to the court that it was\r\n  involuntary or given under duress or pursuant to coercion.Â  See Hicks\r\n    v. Stargel, 487 S.E.2d 428, 429 (Ga. App. 1997) (holding that there was no\r\n  reason to revoke the surrendering parentsâ€™ consent for adoption more than ten\r\n  days after it was given because there was no evidence of fraud, duress, or\r\n  incapacity); N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 48-3-707(a)(1) (2005) (holding that a\r\n  relinquishment shall become void if, before entry of the adoption decree, the\r\n  relinquishing parent establishes by clear and convincing evidence that it was\r\n  obtained by fraud or duress). Â Â \r\nIn South Carolina, there is no waiting\r\n  period before a consent to relinquish a child for adoption becomes effective.Â \r\n  Thus, once a parent signs a consent, there is no contemplation time or waiting\r\n  period during which the consent can be revoked.[4] Â Withdrawal of the consent is not permitted except by court order after notice\r\n  and an opportunity to be heard by all parties, and â€œexcept when the court finds\r\n  that the withdrawal is in the best interests of the child and that the consent\r\n  or relinquishment was not given voluntarily or was obtained under duress or\r\n  through coercion.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1720 (Supp. 2007).Â  The burden is on\r\n  the person seeking to revoke the consent to show the consent was obtained\r\n  involuntarily.Â  See Phillips v. Baker, 284 S.C. 134, 137, 325\r\n  S.E.2d 533, 535 (1985) (finding the biological mother failed to establish she\r\n  executed the consent form under duress).Â   \r\nWhile an immediately effective consent\r\n  form may be intended to provide assurances to adoptive parents, it does not\r\n  reduce the heartbreak from prolonged litigation when a biological parent later\r\n  changes his or her mind.[5]Â \r\n  A reflection period, during which biological parents could closely examine\r\n  their decision, would assure adoptive parents that the adoption would likely be\r\n  completed.Â  Although a biological parent could still attempt to revoke consent\r\n  by proving involuntariness, duress, or coercion, in our view, the likelihood of\r\n  a challenge to the consent after reflecting during a revocation period would be\r\n  substantially reduced.Â  However beneficial for both adoptive and biological\r\n  parents a reflection period may be, it is not the current law in this state,\r\n  and we must, therefore, apply the law as it currently stands.[6]Â   \r\nThe more traditional attack on the consent\r\n  for relinquishment is that it was given under duress or pursuant to coercion.Â  Duress\r\n  is defined as â€œâ€˜a condition of mind produced by improper external pressure or\r\n  influence that practically destroys the free agency of a party and causes him\r\n  to do an act or form a contract not of his own volition.â€™â€Â  Phillips,\r\n  284 S.C. at 137, 325 S.E.2d at 535 (quoting Cherry v. Shelby Mut. Plate\r\n    Glass &amp; Cas. Co., 191 S.C. 177, 183, 4 S.E.2d 123, 126 (1939)).Â  Duress\r\n  is viewed with a subjective test, looking at the individual characteristics of\r\n  the person allegedly influenced, and duress does not occur if the person has a\r\n  reasonable alternative to succumbing and fails to avail themselves of the\r\n  alternative.Â  Blejski v. Blejski, 325 S.C. 491, 498, 480 S.E.2d 462, 466\r\n  (Ct. App. 1997) (affirming family courtâ€™s finding that wifeâ€™s acceptance of\r\n  settlement agreement was not made under duress where her attorney told her the\r\n  judge was mad at her and she should accept the agreement or face losing custody\r\n  of her children; the Court of Appeals found attorneyâ€™s advice amounted to an\r\n  opinion and wife had the alternative of taking her chances with a trial).Â  \r\n \r\nCertainly, many people suffer tragedies in their\r\n  personal lives that do not rise to the level of the legal definition of duress.Â \r\n  In most instances, suffering tragedies prior to having a baby, without more,\r\n  would not render involuntary a decision to relinquish the child for adoption.Â  However,\r\n  duress is only one consideration, and the Court may look to other factors,\r\n  including the totality of the circumstances, in making the voluntariness\r\n  determination.Â  See Johnson v. Horry County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs.,\r\n  298 S.C. 355, 356, 380 S.E.2d 830, 831 (1989) (considering many factors in affirming\r\n  the family courtâ€™s order finding the consent for adoption was entered\r\n  voluntarily and adoption would be in the best interest of the children where\r\n  the birth mother:Â  had an eleventh grade education; was able to understand the\r\n  documents signed; was not under the influence of incapacitating drugs; was not\r\n  in any unusual emotional state; and indicated that her consent was freely given\r\n  and not the product of duress); see also Burnett v. Burnett,\r\n  290 S.C. 28, 30, 347 S.E.2d 908, 909 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding wife entered into\r\n  domestic settlement agreement voluntarily where there was no evidence that she\r\n  â€œwas compelled to enter the agreement as a result of being overreached or\r\n  subjected to any duress, nor is there any evidence that she was not of sound\r\n  mind or under any unusual stress, other than the stress normally attendant to\r\n  the breakup of a marriageâ€).Â   \r\nTurning to the present case, conflicting\r\n  evidence was presented in the portion of the trial regarding voluntariness.Â  McCann\r\n  cried during her testimony, finding the memories painful, but she believed she\r\n  was now emotionally, mentally, and psychologically strong.Â  She stated she did\r\n  not recall the delivery, and her recollection of the events in the hospital was\r\n  very blurry.Â  She denied telling Dr. Srivastava that she was considering\r\n  adoption.Â  According to McCann, social worker Judy Hewes only gave her adoption\r\n  as an option, although Hewes also discussed how her sister handled being a\r\n  single mom.Â  McCann admitted she told Hewes that she felt the baby might be\r\n  better off with another family.Â Â Â Â   \r\nMcCann testified that she thought she had\r\n  time to make her final adoption decision because of the language in the\r\n  counseling form indicating she had two weeks and the language in the medical\r\n  power of attorney that it would expire after a formal court hearing.Â  McCann\r\n  admitted that she was calm when she signed the legal documents, that she knew\r\n  adoption was a permanent legal process, and that she had stated in her\r\n  deposition that she knew the consent documents had significant legal\r\n  ramifications, but she stated she felt completely overwhelmed.Â  She testified\r\n  that she contacted Duschinski on Monday, July 24, 2006, stating she wanted the\r\n  child back, and she was told by Duschinski that she had ninety days to take\r\n  legal action.Â  McCann testified that she felt that Hewes, Yemec, and Dushinski\r\n  misguided her, and she admitted that she felt as though her â€œraging hormones,\r\n  lingering pain medication and the unethical treatment of some of the players\r\n  conspired to leadâ€ her to a poor decision.Â   \r\nMcCann also presented the testimony of her\r\n  treating psychologist, Dr. Bryant Welch, and her treating psychotherapist,\r\n  Jocelyn Evans.Â  Dr. Welch, who began seeing McCann five weeks after the\r\n  delivery and reviewed her hospital records, opined that McCann did not\r\n  voluntarily give her consent for adoption because:Â  (1) women have widely\r\n  fluctuating emotions postpartum, and the hospital staff all noted McCannâ€™s\r\n  incessant crying; (2) McCann suffered from tremendous stressors, and the\r\n  cumulative effect impaired her functioning; (3) he believed McCannâ€™s GAF score of\r\n  50 indicated impaired functioning; and (4) McCann did not get the help she\r\n  needed from hospital staff, especially Hewes, who was not licensed and only\r\n  promoted adoption.Â  Welch admitted that Dr. Srivastava did not find McCann had\r\n  impaired functioning, but argued that the doctor was not evaluating McCann for\r\n  her ability to sign a consent form.Â   \r\nJocelyn Evans became McCannâ€™s treating\r\n  psychotherapist some time after McCann filed the underlying action.Â  Evans also\r\n  testified that McCann was incapable of giving her consent and made her decision\r\n  â€œunder duress,â€ because of the emotional trauma from the totality of her\r\n  stressors, she was visibly overwrought, and she was mentally fragile, though\r\n  not mentally impaired.Â  Evans also noted that she believed a woman should not\r\n  make her adoption decision within the first forty-eight hours after birth and\r\n  that Hewes acted unethically in suggesting adoption where McCann had checked\r\n  â€œnoâ€ to the question of adoption in the hospital intake papers.Â   \r\nFinally, the guardian ad litem, Dewitt,\r\n  presented her report, stating that McCann was a fit, educated, and mature\r\n  parent, with support from her mother and sister.Â  Dewitt stated that although\r\n  she was sure the baby had bonded to some extent with the Does, she was\r\n  impressed that the child seemed to immediately recognize McCann upon their\r\n  first visit at eleven weeks.Â  The family court further heard from Dr. Gorman,\r\n  Judy Hewes, Nurse Yemec, Helen Duschinski, and attorneys Corley and Esquivel.Â \r\n \r\nGiving great deference to the family courtâ€™s\r\n  credibility determinations of the conflicting evidence in the present case, we\r\n  find there is abundant evidence that McCannâ€™s emotional stressors and suffering\r\n  caused impaired functioning.Â  All of the hospital personnel interacting with\r\n  McCann noted she was extremely tearful during her stay, and Hewes and Yemec\r\n  were so concerned about her safety that they contacted her after she left the\r\n  hospital.Â  Her extreme behavior required a psychological consult to determine\r\n  solely if McCann could care for herself and be released from the hospital.Â  Dr.\r\n  Srivastava did not evaluate McCann for her ability to make the adoption\r\n  decision, and he noted McCann was functioning with only partial insight, as\r\n  indicated by her GAF score of 50.Â  Despite Dr. Srivastavaâ€™s deposition\r\n  testimony that partial insight meant McCann was not significantly impaired, her\r\n  score was one point away from requiring further hospitalization.Â  Further, the\r\n  only persons who actually evaluated McCann for her ability to consent to\r\n  relinquishment, Dr. Welch and Jocelyn Evans, both opined after reviewing all\r\n  the evidence and records in the case that McCann was incapable of giving her\r\n  voluntary consent for adoption at the time she was in the hospital.Â   \r\nFurther, while McCann was suffering from impaired\r\n  functioning, she was encouraged by others regarding the adoption decision, she was\r\n  presented with a counseling form that led her to believe she had a two-week\r\n  time period in which to consider the adoption decision,[7] the medical power of attorney form created\r\n  an impression there was a time period before a court terminated her parental\r\n  rights or before her consent was valid, and the attorney obtaining her\r\n  signature made a statement that she would have to prove she was the better\r\n  parent in order to get her child back.Â  Based on the totality of the\r\n  circumstances in this case, we agree with the family court that McCann proved\r\n  her consent for relinquishment was involuntary.Â   \r\nII. Best Interest\r\nThe Does also appeal the finding that it was in the best\r\n  interest of the child for the consent to be withdrawn and for the child to be\r\n  awarded to McCann based on the biological connection.Â Â   \r\nAs previously discussed, before a biological parent can\r\n  withdraw her consent to adoption, the family court must make a determination\r\n  that withdrawal is in the best interest of the child and that the\r\n  consent was not voluntarily given or was the product of duress or coercion.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§20-7-1720 (Supp. 2007).Â  â€œThe best interest of the child\r\n  remains, always, the paramount consideration in every adoption.â€Â  Dunn v. Dunn, 298 S.C. 365, 367, 380\r\n  S.E.2d 836, 837 (1989); Doe v. Roe, 369 S.C. 351, 371, 631 S.E.2d 317,\r\n  328 (Ct. App. 2006) (noting that the best interest of the child is the ultimate\r\n  consideration).Â  The state also recognizes a rebuttable presumption in custody\r\n  matters that it is the best interest for the child to be placed with a\r\n  biological parent over a third party.Â  Moore v. Moore, 300 S.C.\r\n  75, 78, 386 S.E.2d 456, 458 (1989).[8]Â  \r\n \r\nAfter the hearing on the second portion of\r\n  the trial regarding whether revocation of the consent was in the best interest\r\n  of the baby, the family court informed the parties on April 21, 2007, that the\r\n  baby should be placed with McCann.Â  In the written order filed May 4, 2007, the\r\n  court noted that McCann:Â  had a suitable home; was well-educated and\r\n  financially stable; had bonded with the child; had strong family support; and\r\n  demonstrated â€œnatural, instinctive and appropriate parenting skills and great\r\n  motivation to being the full-time parent, nurturer, and protector of the\r\n  child.â€Â  The court also noted that both McCann and the Does were â€œpeople of\r\n  character and integrity who are committed to the well-being of this beautiful\r\n  child,â€ and that the Does had demonstrated a great capacity for parenting and\r\n  had a loving, nurturing home.Â  However, the court found that under the facts\r\n  and circumstances of the case, it would be in the best interest of the child to\r\n  be raised by McCann, her biological mother, and it ordered the child to be\r\n  placed with McCann by May 6, 2007.\r\nBoth McCann and the Does presented evidence that they\r\n  have sufficient housing, financial resources, extended support systems, and\r\n  child care options.Â  McCann and the Does appear to be fit, they all obviously\r\n  love the baby very much, and, with the exception of the first eleven weeks of\r\n  her life, the baby has spent much time in both households bonding with the\r\n  parties and the extended families.Â  However, in light of the involuntariness of\r\n  McCannâ€™s consent for relinquishment, we agree with the family court that it\r\n  would be in the childâ€™s best interest for the consent to be withdrawn.Â \r\n  Further, with both sides proving an equal ability to care for the child, we\r\n  agree with the family court that it would be in the childâ€™s best interest for\r\n  custody to be returned to McCann, the biological parent.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAdoption is a wonderful institution, bringing together\r\n  parents who want children with children who need loving homes.Â  However,\r\n  protections need to be in place for both biological and adoptive parents to\r\n  ensure the decision to give a child for adoption is a thoughtful and certain\r\n  one and not likely to be challenged in a long, arduous, and\r\n  emotionally-wrenching legal process as has happened in this case.Â   \r\nNevertheless, we agree with the family court in the\r\n  present case that, looking at the totality of the circumstances, McCann proved\r\n  she was incapable of giving a voluntary consent.Â  It is in the best interest of\r\n  the child for the consent for relinquishment be revoked and the child to be returned\r\n  to McCann.Â   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and\r\n  MOORE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result. WALLER, J., dissenting\r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In\r\n  my opinion, the evidence clearly establishes that the biological mother, Laura\r\n  McCann, voluntarily signed a relinquishment form which complied with the statutory\r\n  requirements set out by the Legislature.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  20-7-1700 &amp; -1705 (Supp. 2007).Â  Because the relinquishment form complied\r\n  with the statute, and McCann failed to prove duress or coercion, I would hold\r\n  that the family court erred by revoking McCannâ€™s consent to the adoption.\r\n\r\n\tâ€œRelinquishmentâ€ is defined as:\r\n\t[T]he informed and voluntary release in writing of all\r\n  parental rights with respect to a child by a parent to a child placing agency\r\n  or to a person who facilitates the placement of a child for the purpose of\r\n  adoption and to whom the parent has given the right to consent to the adoption\r\n  of the child.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1650(h) (Supp. 2007).[9] Â Withdrawal of any consent or relinquishment is permitted only when the\r\n  court finds[10] the withdrawal is in the best interests of the child and the consent or\r\n  relinquishment was given involuntarily or was obtained under duress or through\r\n  coercion.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1720 (Supp. 2007).Â   \r\nThe\r\n  majority concludes that the evidence showed McCannâ€™s â€œemotional stressors and\r\n  suffering caused impaired functioning,â€ which in turn rendered her\r\n  relinquishment involuntary.Â  However, an action is involuntary when it is\r\n  performed under duress, force, or coercion,[11] and the crux of this case really is whether McCann acted while under duress.Â \r\n  As noted by the majority opinion, duress is â€œâ€˜a condition of mind produced by improper external pressure or influence that practically destroys the free agency\r\n  of a party and causes [her] to do an act or form a contract not of [her] own\r\n  volition.â€™â€Â  Phillips v. Baker, 284 S.C. 134, 137, 325 S.E.2d 533,\r\n  535&nbsp;(1985) (emphasis added, citation omitted).Â   \r\nIn\r\n  my opinion, there is no compelling evidence that McCannâ€™s â€œemotional stressorsâ€\r\n  were anything but internal in nature.[12]Â \r\n  Therefore, although I would agree with the family courtâ€™s conclusion that\r\n  McCann was in an emotional state, the family court erred in finding her consent\r\n  was given involuntarily.Â  Circumstances such as temporary depression or\r\n  emotional distress simply are not sufficient, in and of themselves, to\r\n  invalidate a consent to adoption.Â  See, e.g., In re J.N.,\r\n  95 P.3d 414, 419&nbsp;(Wash. Ct. App. 2004) (â€œemotional stress alone does not\r\n  vitiate an otherwise voluntary decision to relinquish parental rightsâ€), review\r\n    denied, 114 P.3d 1198 (2005); Boatwright v. Walker, 715 S.W.2d 237,\r\n  242-43&nbsp;(Ky. Ct. App. 1986) (consent to adoption will not be revoked based\r\n  upon emotional distress or temporary depression; a showing of fraud or duress\r\n  is required); Regenold v. Baby Fold, Inc., 355 N.E.2d 361,\r\n  363-65&nbsp;(Ill. App. Ct. 1976) (where the 19-year-oldÂ  biological mother was\r\n  experiencing â€œa great deal of stress,â€ the court nonetheless reversed the lower\r\n  courtâ€™s finding of duress because there was no evidence that her consent to\r\n  adoption was the product of â€œthird party persuasion, inducement, deception, or\r\n  dominationâ€), affâ€™d 369 N.E.2d 858 (1977).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  to suggest that because others offered support to McCann regarding her adoption\r\n  decision, this encouragement somehow acted to coerce McCann into signing the\r\n  relinquishment is a sad commentary, indeed.Â  Support for a parentâ€™s choice to\r\n  place a baby for adoption is something that should be promoted, although\r\n  clearly the decision should never be forced upon a parent.[13]\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  there is significant evidence which clearly refutes the idea that McCann was in\r\n  any way coerced to give up her baby for adoption.Â  For example, McCann herself:Â \r\n  (1) initially raised the issue of adoption to her nurses and postpartum\r\n  obstetrician; (2) requested information about adoption agencies from the social\r\n  worker; (3) called the private adoption agency and arranged a meeting with\r\n  Helen Duschinski for the next day at the hospital; and (4) called Duschinski\r\n  when she was late arriving and gave her directions to the hospital.\r\nDuschinski\r\n  eventually arrived with the Doesâ€™ attorney, Rick Corley, and another\r\n  attorney, Hector Esquivel.Â \r\n  However, only Esquivel and the social worker remained in the hospital room with\r\n  McCann while Esquivel went over all the forms in detail.Â  McCann thereafter\r\n  signed various documents.Â   \r\nOf most importance to the instant case is the\r\n  relinquishment form, which was entitled â€œCONSENT TO ADOPTION.â€Â  As previously\r\n  mentioned, and as conceded by the majority, this form complied with the\r\n  statutory requirements.[14]Â  See Â§Â§ 20-7-1700 &amp; -1705.Â  The purpose of these statutes is â€œto ensure\r\n  that birth parents freely and voluntarily consent to relinquish their\r\n  particular child, and do not do so under conditions of duress.â€Â  Doe v.\r\n    Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 277, 457 S.E.2d 336, 338&nbsp;(1995) (Waller, J.,\r\n  dissenting).Â   \r\nThe main\r\n  reason this particular form is so crucial is because, under South Carolina law,\r\n  there simply is no waiting period before a relinquishment of parental rights\r\n  becomes effective.Â  It is the Legislature, not this Court, that has made this\r\n  pronouncement. Â â€œâ€˜The legal rules on the\r\n  timing of consents are ultimately a compromise between the interest in\r\n  protecting biological mothers from making hasty or ill-informed decisions at a\r\n  time of great physical and emotional stress, and the interest in expediting the\r\n  adoption process for newborns.â€™â€Â  Elizabeth J. Samuels, Time To Decide? The Laws Governing\r\n    Mothersâ€™ Consents To The Adoption Of Their Newborn Infants, 72 Tenn. L. Rev. 509, 541 (2005) (citation omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  Legislature has chosen to safeguard this difficult decision-making process with\r\n  certain requirements regarding both the â€œform and contentâ€ of a consent or\r\n  relinquishment form and the process employed at the actual signing of the\r\n  form.Â  See Â§Â§ 20-7-1700 &amp; -1705.Â  There are numerous other states\r\n  that, unlike South Carolina, provide for various waiting and/or revocation periods.[15]Â \r\n  Nonetheless, this Court simply is not empowered â€œto effect\r\n  a change in the statutes enacted by the Legislature.â€Â  State v. Corey D.,\r\n  339 S.C. 107, 120, 529 S.E.2d 20, 27&nbsp;(2000).Â   \r\nIn\r\n  other words, although it might seem unwise that under South Carolina law a\r\n  biological parent does not have even a few days to retract such an important\r\n  decision as relinquishing oneâ€™s rights to her own child, this Court may not â€œsecond guess the\r\n  wisdom or folly of decisions of the Legislature.â€Â  Id. at 121, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 20, 27 (citing Keyserling v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 83, 86, 470 S.E.2d\r\n  100, 101 (1996)).\r\nThe\r\n  Legislature has set the parameters for adoption.Â  Thus, in order to have her\r\n  consent to adoption withdrawn, McCann was required to prove her â€œrelinquishment\r\n  was given involuntarily or was obtained under duress or through coercion.â€Â  Â§ 20-7-1720.\r\n  Â Because it is my opinion McCann did not make such a showing, I would reverse\r\n  the family courtâ€™s order revoking McCannâ€™s consent to the adoption.\r\n\r\n[1] Although Dr. Gormanâ€™s notes reflect McCann was\r\n  â€œconsidering adoption,â€ Dr. Gorman testified McCann personally told her she had\r\n  decided on adoption because she did not feel at that point in her life that she\r\n  could handle a baby and McCann seemed at peace with that decision.  \r\n[2]Â \r\n  There is some debate over Hewesâ€™ status as either an intern or unlicensed\r\n  masters social work student.Â  For purposes of this opinion, we merely refer to\r\n  Hewes as a social worker.  \r\n[3]Â  The Does raise sixteen sub-issues pointing out facts\r\n  they allege show McCann failed to meet her burden regarding the involuntary\r\n  nature of her consent or showing the facts found in the family courtâ€™s order\r\n  were not supported by the record.Â  However, each of these issues goes toward\r\n  the main question regarding voluntariness.\r\n[4]Â \r\n  There are certain statutory requirements for a\r\n  consent form.Â  For example, a consent or relinquishment form for the purposes\r\n  of adoption must specify:Â  (1) that the consent acts to forfeit all rights and\r\n  obligations of the parent to the child; (2) that the consent â€œmust not be\r\n  withdrawn except by order of the court upon a finding that it is in the best\r\n  interests of the child;â€ and (3) that the consent was not voluntary or was\r\n  obtained through duress or coercion.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1700(A)(6), (7)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  The consent must be signed in the presence of two witnesses, one\r\n  of which must be either a family court judge, an attorney who does not\r\n  represent the prospective adoptive parents, or a person certified to obtain\r\n  consents through the Department of Social Services. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-1705(A)(1) - (3) (Supp. 2007).Â  Each witness must certify that the\r\n  provisions of the document were discussed with the person giving consent and\r\n  that the witness believes that the consent was given voluntarily and was not\r\n  obtained by coercion or duress.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1705(B) (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  Our review of the consent form in the present case shows it met the technical\r\n  requirements of the statute.Â   \r\n[5]Â \r\n  As will be discussed further, we are in no way implying by this commentary that\r\n  McCann merely changed her mind in the present case.  \r\n[6]Â \r\n  Although there is no law allowing a waiting period for a parent to consider the\r\n  enormous decision to give a child up for adoption, it is interesting that the\r\n  law provides for waiting periods in consumer transactions.Â  See, e.g.,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-2-502 (2002) (providing that consumers have three days to\r\n  change their mind about a home solicitation sale).Â  However, the Legislature\r\n  enacted a waiting period of sorts for biological parents who wish to use the\r\n  Department of Social Services for adoption placement.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-2323 (Supp. 2007) (â€œThe Department of Social Services, before it\r\n  may accept as a client a parent or parents, or prospective parent or parents\r\n  who wish to relinquish their child for adoption, must first provide them with\r\n  an informational brochure which outlines the services available from and the\r\n  procedure used to select adoptive parents by the Department and by the licensed\r\n  private adoption agencies in this State . . . The Department may not accept the\r\n  above persons as clients until a period of forty-eight hours has elapsed from\r\n  the time they are furnished this brochure . . . .â€).Â  Despite giving parents\r\n  time to consider whether they wish to use a State or private agency for\r\n  adoption, there is no similar provision giving parents time to reflect on the\r\n  more important decision of relinquishment.Â   \r\n[7]Â \r\n  As with the consent form, we do not find anything particularly misleading about\r\n  the counseling or medical power of attorney forms.Â  However, because McCann had\r\n  impaired functioning in the present case, we give great deference to the family\r\n  courtâ€™s determination that McCannâ€™s testimony in this regard was credible.Â Â  \r\n \r\n[8]Â \r\n  The Does complain the family court erred in using the best interest analysis\r\n  applied in custody situations, including the preference for the biological\r\n  parent, because the revocation statute does not indicate a preference for the\r\n  biological parent over the adoptive parent.Â  The statute does not indicate the\r\n  best interest analysis to be employed is any different from that used in any\r\n  other case concerning the welfare of children.Â  While we understand the Doesâ€™\r\n  concern that the presumption in favor of biological parents would devastate any\r\n  chance an adoptive parent had of enforcing the relinquishment in the face of a\r\n  challenge, we note the statute requires the biological parent to prove both:Â \r\n  (1) the consent was involuntary; and (2) withdrawal was in the best\r\n  interest of the child.Â  Aside from the situation before us, the burden of\r\n  proving the involuntariness of the consent for relinquishment is generally\r\n  difficult.Â  Because a challenge to the consent for relinquishment may only\r\n  occur prior to an adoption, the dispute concerns a custody determination and\r\n  the normal best interest analysis in custody disputes should be employed.\r\n[9] I focus on the term â€œrelinquishmentâ€ because this is\r\n  â€œcommonly used to refer to a motherâ€™s surrender of parental rights to an\r\n  adoption agency that will place the child with adoptive parents.â€ Â Elizabeth J. Samuels, Time To Decide? The Laws Governing\r\n    Mothers' Consents To The Adoption Of Their Newborn Infants, 72 Tenn. L. Rev. 509, 511 n.5&nbsp;(2005).\r\n[10] On appeal from the family court, this Court may find\r\n  facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  E.g., Phillips v. Baker, 284 S.C. 134, 325 S.E.2d 533 (1985).\r\n[11] Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 574 (6th ed.\r\n  1991).\r\n[12] I certainly do not contend that any emotions McCann\r\n  felt were not real, were in any way insignificant, or were her fault.Â  I focus\r\n  instead on the fact that these emotional pressures clearly were not generated or\r\n  caused by the people around her, and therefore do not meet the pressures\r\n  required by the legal definition of duress.\r\n[13] See In re Commâ€™r of Soc. Servs., Suffolk County, 529 N.Y.S.2d 883 (N.Y. App. Div. 1988).Â  In this New York case, the\r\n  appellate court appropriately rejected the birth motherâ€™s claim that her\r\n  consent to adoption had been coerced even though the pregnancy was the result\r\n  of a rape.Â  Notably, the court found that her husbandâ€™s encouragement â€œdid not\r\n  render the circumstances coercive nor did his entreaties impair her ability to\r\n  exercise her free will.â€Â  Id. at 884; see also Anonymous\r\n    v.

App. 1975) (although\r\n  birth motherâ€™s church official advised her in the hospital to â€œrelease the baby\r\n  for adoption,â€ this did not constitute duress).\r\n[14] In addition, although not specifically required by\r\n  statute, the form expressly stated the following:Â  â€œI understand that there is\r\n  no revocation period during which I may withdraw this consent, and that the\r\n  consent is effective immediately upon my signing the consent.â€\r\n[15] An interesting example is Vermont where a biological\r\n  parent may not even execute a relinquishment until at least 36 hours after the baby\r\n  is born and then may revoke the relinquishment within 21 days after the\r\n  relinquishment was executed.Â  See Vt.

Carter, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent\r\n  Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this case, the post-conviction relief (PCR) court found trial\r\n  counsel ineffective for failing to request an identification instruction at\r\n  trial, and therefore, granted Respondent Clarence Speaks relief.Â  This Court\r\n  granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari, and we reverse the PCR\r\n  courtâ€™s decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nA grand jury indicted Respondent for assault and\r\n  battery with intent to kill (ABWIK) and first-degree burglary following an\r\n  incident where four people allegedly entered Belinda Sullivanâ€™s apartment and\r\n  assaulted her boyfriend, Patrick Brock.Â  At trial, Belinda testified that\r\n  around 2:30 a.m., she heard a knock and cracked open the door to see Mark Jefferies,\r\n  her ex-boyfriend, along with Respondent, Respondentâ€™s mother, Bonnie, and\r\n  Respondentâ€™s sister, Angel.Â  Belinda testified that Respondent, Bonnie, and\r\n  Angel were Markâ€™s cousins and that she knew them through her previous\r\n  relationship with Mark.Â  Belinda testified that all four individuals forced\r\n  their way into her apartment, asked her why she let Patrick attack Mark,[1] and then proceeded upstairs to the bedroom where Patrick was sleeping.Â  Belinda\r\n  testified that once in the bedroom, Respondent began striking Patrick and\r\n  eventually threw a television on Patrick.Â  Patrick provided essentially the\r\n  same testimony and identified Respondent as the person who assaulted him.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  presented several witnesses to rebut Belindaâ€™s and Patrickâ€™s testimonies.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Respondentâ€™s girlfriend testified that Respondent was with her on the night of\r\n  the incident, but that Respondent left her house for thirty minutes with his\r\n  father.Â  Respondentâ€™s father testified that although he and Respondent drove to\r\n  Belindaâ€™s apartment, they arrived after the altercation had taken place.Â \r\n  Angel, Bonnie, and Mark all admitted that they were present during the\r\n  altercation, but testified that Mark assaulted Patrick and specifically\r\n  testified that Respondent was never there.Â  Finally, Respondent testified that he\r\n  was not at Belindaâ€™s apartment during the altercation and that he did not\r\n  assault Patrick.Â  The jury found Respondent guilty of ABWIK and burglary.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, Respondent argued that trial counsel should have investigated\r\n  Patrickâ€™s inability to identify him as the assailant.Â  Respondent testified\r\n  that Patrick mistook Respondent for two different people at his bond hearing,\r\n  and that on a later occasion, he saw Patrick at the probation office but that\r\n  Patrick did not recognize him.Â  Additionally, Respondent alleged that the\r\n  arrest warrant described the assailant as five feet, six inches and 155 pounds\r\n  but that he is six feet and 200 pounds.Â  Respondent alleged that Mark more\r\n  accurately matched the description in the warrant.Â  Trial counsel testified\r\n  that Respondent never informed him that Patrick failed to recognize him at the\r\n  bond hearing and that he raised identification issues at trial.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  PCR court found that the identification of Respondent as the assailant was an\r\n  â€œintegral issueâ€ at trial.Â  Additionally, the PCR court found numerous factors\r\n  indicated that the identification of Respondent as the assailant was peculiarly\r\n  suspect.Â  Specifically, these factors included testimony that Respondent was\r\n  not involved in the assault, the description of the assailant in the arrest\r\n  warrant, Respondentâ€™s testimony regarding Patrickâ€™s failure to recognize him,\r\n  and the likely possibility that Belinda implicated Respondent instead of Mark\r\n  out of fear of Patrickâ€™s retaliation against Mark.Â  Accordingly, the PCR court\r\n  held that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury\r\n  instruction on identification\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted certiorari to review the PCR courtâ€™s decision, and the State\r\n  presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  PCR court err in finding trial counsel ineffective for failing to request an\r\n  identification instruction?\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn\r\n  post-conviction proceedings, the burden of proof is on the applicant to prove\r\n  the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286\r\n  S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  On appeal, the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling should be upheld if it is supported by any evidence of probative value\r\n  in the record.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119,\r\n  386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe State argues\r\n  that the PCR court erred in finding trial counsel ineffective for failing to\r\n  request an identification jury charge.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  order to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the applicant\r\n  must show that: (1) counsel\r\n  failed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional\r\n  norms, and (2) counselâ€™s deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case. Â Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).Â  \r\nIn United States v. Telfaire, the court recommended â€œthat trial courts include, as a\r\n  matter of routine, an identification instructionâ€ and provided a model\r\n  identification instruction.Â  Id. 469 F.2d 552, 555 n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1972).Â \r\n  The model instruction, which emphasized that the State had to prove the\r\n  accuracy of the identification of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, â€œwas\r\n  designed to focus the attention of the jury on the identification issue and\r\n  minimize the risk of conviction through false or mistaken identification.â€Â  State v. Jones, 344\r\n  S.C. 48, 59, 543 S.E.2d 541, 547 (2001).Â  In State v. Simmons, this Court â€œadmonish[ed] the trial bench that in single witness\r\n  identification cases the court should instruct the jury that the burden of\r\n  proving the identity of the defendant rests with the state.â€Â  308\r\n  S.C. 80, 83, 417 S.E.2d 92, 94 (1992).\r\nIn\r\n  our opinion, there is no evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that trial\r\n  counsel was ineffective for failing to request an identification instruction.Â \r\n  Specifically, we do not believe that identification was an â€œintegral issueâ€ at\r\n  Respondentâ€™s trial.Â  Belinda and Patrick testified that Respondent, Mark,\r\n  Angel, and Bonnie entered the apartment and that Respondent assaulted Patrick.Â \r\n  On the other hand, Respondentâ€™s witnesses testified that only Mark, Angel, and\r\n  Bonnie entered the apartment, that Mark assaulted Patrick, and that Respondent\r\n  was never present during the altercation.Â  Thus,\r\n  the jury was not faced with the issue of whether Belinda and Patrick\r\n  misidentified Respondent, but rather whether to believe their testimonies or instead\r\n  whether to believe the defenseâ€™s witnessesâ€™ testimonies.[2] Â Accordingly, we believe that the critical issue at trial was witness\r\n  credibility, an issue on which the trial court sufficiently charged the jury.Â  This\r\n  conclusion is further supported by the PCR courtâ€™s specific findings. Â For\r\n  example, the PCR court noted that Respondentâ€™s witnesses testified that\r\n  Respondent was not present during the assault and the PCR court determined that\r\n  Belinda had motivation to falsely implicate Respondent.Â  \r\nAdditionally, we\r\n  believe cases in which an identification charge was relevant are readily distinguishable from this case.Â  For example, Simmons involved a police officer identifying the defendant following an undercover\r\n  operation, and in Jones and State\r\n    v. Patterson, 337\r\n  S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999), neither\r\n  victim/eyewitness identifying the defendant knew the defendant prior to the\r\n  crime.Â  Conversely, in the instant case, the State provided two\r\n  eyewitnesses who unequivocally identified Respondent as the assailant.Â Â  See Jones, 344 S.C. at 59, 543 S.E.2d at 547 (holding a Telfaire charge was unnecessary where the case did not involve\r\n  a single witness identification and where, given the witnessesâ€™ degree of\r\n  certainty, there appeared very little likelihood of mistaken identification) and State v. Motes, 264 S.C. 317, 326, 215 S.E.2d 190, 194 (1975)\r\n  (finding no error in failing to give a Telfaire instruction where\r\n  identification â€œpresented no peculiar problemâ€).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that there is no evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s decision that\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an identification\r\n  instruction.Â  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s order granting Respondent\r\n  relief.Â  \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BEATTY, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, since there\r\n  is evidence of probative value in the record to support the post-conviction\r\n  relief (PCR) judgeâ€™s finding of ineffective assistance of counsel, we should\r\n  uphold his decision.Â  E.g., Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386\r\n  S.E.2d 624 (1989).\r\nThe majority finds\r\n  error in the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that identification was the â€œintegral issueâ€\r\n  at Respondentâ€™s trial, stating that instead the â€œcritical issueâ€ was witness\r\n  credibility.Â  I do not understand this distinction, as the question was whether\r\n  the witnessesâ€™ identification of Respondent as a participant in the crimes was credible.Â \r\n  Moreover, the fact that two Stateâ€™s witnesses unequivocally identified\r\n  Respondent as the assailant does not negate the importance of identification in\r\n  the case, but merely highlights the centrality of the issue given that four\r\n  defense witnesses, including those who admitted being present at the scene, as\r\n  well as Respondent testified that he was not involved.Â  \r\nI would uphold the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a\r\n  jury charge emphasizing the Stateâ€™s burden to establish the accuracy of\r\n  Respondentâ€™s identification beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Cherry v. State, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Earlier that evening, Mark and Patrick got into a physical altercation in which\r\n  apparently Patrick injured Mark. \r\n[2] This, in our view, is the distinction between the issue of identification and\r\n  witness credibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26455","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney Salley W. Elliott, and\r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., of Columbia; and\r\n  Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE: Ã‚Â Appellant Michael Batchelor was convicted of several\r\n  charges stemming from an automobile collision in which his three minor sons\r\n  were killed and three other minors were injured.Ã‚Â  The charges include two\r\n  counts of felony driving under the influence (felony DUI) causing death, two\r\n  counts of felony DUI causing great bodily injury, and one count of involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.[1]Ã‚Â \r\n  After we issued our original opinion affirming appellantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s convictions,[2] appellant petitioned for rehearing.Ã‚Â  We deny the petition for rehearing, withdraw\r\n  our original opinion in this matter, and substitute it with this opinion\r\n  affirming the trial courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts are undisputed.Ã‚Â  AppellantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three\r\n  sonsÃ¢â‚¬â€Raymond Groomes (referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“AshtonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and Brandon and Drew\r\n  BatchelorÃ¢â‚¬â€lived with their mother.Ã‚Â  On July 11, 2002, they were invited along\r\n  with three friends to appellantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house where appellant supplied them with\r\n  alcohol.Ã‚Â  All of the boys were between the ages of thirteen and fifteen. \r\nAt some point in the afternoon, appellant and the\r\n  boys left the house in appellantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pick-up truck to buy more alcohol and look\r\n  for some marijuana.Ã‚Â  Appellant was driving.Ã‚Â  After veering off the side of the\r\n  road, appellant decided he was too drunk to drive and he wanted Ashton to\r\n  drive.Ã‚Â  Ashton, who was fifteen, did not have a driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s license or learnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\r\n  permit and AshtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends had never seen him drive a vehicle.Ã‚Â  At appellantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\r\n  insistence, Ashton took the wheel.Ã‚Â  Shortly thereafter, Ashton swerved off the\r\n  side of the road and over-corrected, causing the truck to swerve into the\r\n  oncoming lane and collide head-on with another vehicle.Ã‚Â  Both vehicles flipped\r\n  and the truck landed upside-down with Ashton under it.\r\nAshton was dead at the scene.Ã‚Â  A\r\n  toxicology report indicated AshtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blood alcohol was .108 at the time of his\r\n  death.Ã‚Â  Brandon and Drew died later at the hospital.Ã‚Â  The other boys and\r\n  appellant were injured.[3]Ã‚Â \r\n  At the hospital, appellant told the investigating officers that Ashton was\r\n  driving and that he had given the boys alcohol.Ã‚Â  Appellant himself smelled\r\n  strongly of alcohol.Ã‚Â  \r\nThe State proceeded to trial on a theory of\r\n  accomplice liability.Ã‚Â  It was undisputed that appellant was not driving at the\r\n  time of the wreck.Ã‚Â  After he was found guilty, appellant expressed remorse that\r\n  he had caused the death of his three children and serious injury to the other\r\n  boys.Ã‚Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Should the\r\n  indictments for felony DUI have been quashed?\r\n\t2.&nbsp; Should a\r\n  directed verdict have been granted?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Ã‚Â  Indictments\r\nAppellant claims the four\r\n  indictments for felony DUI should have been quashed.Ã‚Â  He contends that because the\r\n  indictments charged him as a principal rather than as an accomplice, the grand\r\n  jury was misled regarding the facts of the case.Ã‚Â  \r\nThe regularity of grand jury proceedings is\r\n  presumed absent clear evidence to the contrary; the burden is on the defendant\r\n  to prove facts upon which a challenge to the legality of the grand jury\r\n  proceedings is predicated.Ã‚Â  Evans v. State, 363 S.C. 495, 611 S.E.2d 510\r\n  (2005); State v. Griffin, 277 S.C. 193, 285 S.E.2d 631 (1981).Ã‚Â  \r\nHere, the fact that the indictments\r\n  presented to the grand jury charged appellant as a principal for felony DUI\r\n  does not prove the State misinformed the grand jury that appellant was the\r\n  driver at the time of the wreck.Ã‚Â  It is well-settled that an indictment\r\n  charging the defendant as a principal will support a conviction based on\r\n  accomplice liability.Ã‚Â  State v.

Stanley under his title insurance policy,\r\n  and that Stanleyâ€™s title insurance claim is barred by the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  We hold that the masterâ€™s decision as to the value of Stanleyâ€™s\r\n  property at the time of purchase is reasonably supported by the evidence in the\r\n  record, that Atlantic Titleâ€™s argument regarding valuation methods is not\r\n  preserved for review, and that the master properly determined that Atlantic\r\n  Title waived its ability to assert the statute of limitations as a defense to\r\n  Stanleyâ€™s claim.Â  We therefore affirm the masterâ€™s decision.\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nIn\r\n  early 1998, Respondent Larry L. Stanley purchased a 2.49-acre tract of\r\n  lakefront land along United States Highway 378 in Lexington County, South Carolina.Â  The property is roughly rectangular in shape, with the northern and\r\n  southern borders being the significantly longer dimensions of the property.Â \r\n  Highway 378 crosses over Lake Murray and runs along the northern boundary of\r\n  the property, and the east end of the property is waterfront.Â  At the time Stanley purchased the property, the eastern end contained a building, a boat ramp, and a\r\n  dock with several boat slips.\r\nSometime\r\n  after purchasing the property, Stanley discovered a septic drainage field\r\n  located on about a third of an acre at the southwest end of the property.Â  The\r\n  record reflects that the drainage field is an underground piping system which\r\n  transports wastewater from a septic tank and diffuses the water into the\r\n  ground.Â  The drainage field on Stanleyâ€™s property services a neighboring tract\r\n  of land, and after discovering the field, Stanley initiated contact with the\r\n  neighboring landowner.Â  Stanley also contacted Appellant Atlantic Title Insurance\r\nCompany, the company which insured his title.\r\n\r\nThe dispute regarding the drainage field was\r\n  unfortunately not the only complication Stanley faced regarding this property,\r\n  for shortly after Stanley purchased the property, the South Carolina Department\r\n  of Transportation brought a condemnation action against him to acquire land on\r\n  the propertyâ€™s northern border for the proposed widening of Highway 378.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Stanley dealt for some time with disputes with his neighbor and\r\n  with Atlantic Title over the drainage field, and with the D.O.T. regarding the\r\n  proper amount of compensation for the land taken for the proposed highway\r\n  widening project.Â  In 2004, after negotiations regarding the drainage field\r\n  proved unsuccessful, Stanley brought an action for damages against Atlantic\r\n  Title under his title insurance policy.Â  Stanley and the D.O.T. settled the\r\n  condemnation action while the title insurance claim awaited trial, and the\r\n  settlement resulted in the D.O.T. acquiring a 1.4-acre strip of land along the\r\n  propertyâ€™s northern border.Â  The property taken by the D.O.T. contained the\r\n  existing building on Stanleyâ€™s property and the boat ramp, but the boat docks\r\n  and about half of Stanleyâ€™s shoreline were unaffected.Â  The title insurance\r\n  claim was tried a year later.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, the parties approached the issue of damages from very different\r\n  perspectives.Â  Stanley testified that the area affected by the drainage field\r\n  had no value, could be put to no use, and was unmarketable.Â  Stanley offered\r\n  that his land was worth approximately $100,000 per acre at the time of\r\n  purchase, and that the proper measure of his damages was simply the per-acre\r\n  value of his land at the time of purchase multiplied by the acres affected by\r\n  the drainage field.Â  In contrast, Atlantic Title offered the testimony of a\r\n  real estate appraiser who valued the damage to Stanleyâ€™s title by the\r\n  difference between the value of a portion of Stanleyâ€™s property without the\r\n  drainage field and the value of the same portion including the drainage field -\r\n  a difference of $4,000 by the appraiserâ€™s math.Â  The master sided with Stanley, and en route to determining that the value of Stanleyâ€™s property at the time of\r\n  purchase was $100,000 per acre, the master made note of the amount of the prior\r\n  condemnation action with the D.O.T.Â  The master awarded $35,000 in damages, and\r\n  Atlantic Title appealed.\r\nThis\r\n  Court certified the appeal from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\n  SCACR.Â  Atlantic Title raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the master err in taking judicial notice of the \r\n\t\t\tsettlement in the condemnation action between Stanley and the D.O.T. in the course of determining the per-acre value of Stanleyâ€™s land at the time of purchase?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the master err in determining the value of \r\n\t\t\tStanleyâ€™s title insurance claim based on the complete loss of the \r\n\t\t\taffected portion of his property instead of measuring damages \r\n\t\t\taccording to the reduction in the market value of Stanleyâ€™s title?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the master err in concluding that Stanleyâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tclaim was not barred by the statute of limitations?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn\r\n  an action at law, tried without a jury, the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence\r\n  which reasonably supports the courtâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd.\r\n    v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI. Â The Prior Condemnation\r\n  Award\r\nAtlantic Title argues that the master erred in taking\r\n  judicial notice of the amount of the settlement in the condemnation action\r\n  between Stanley and the D.O.T.Â  Atlantic Title posits that the amount of the\r\n  condemnation settlement is not probative of the value of the land at the time\r\n  of purchase because the settlement occurred over five years after Stanley purchased the property and included compensation for the loss of the building and\r\n  boat ramp as well as the land.Â  Accordingly, Atlantic Title argues the masterâ€™s\r\n  ruling is based on improper evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe need not reach\r\n  the questions raised as to the relevance of the condemnation award in this\r\n  action, because an analysis of the order below demonstrates that this argument\r\n  must fail.Â  While Atlantic Title correctly points out that the masterâ€™s order\r\n  makes note of the condemnation award, the order additionally provides that\r\n  â€œ[b]ased on the testimony offered by [Stanley] and other evidence, this court\r\n  concludes that the value of Mr. Stanleyâ€™s remaining 1.093 acres was $100,000 at\r\n  the time of purchase.â€Â  The masterâ€™s order clearly ties the valuation of Stanleyâ€™s land to Stanleyâ€™s testimony at trial that his land was worth $100,000 per acre\r\n  at the time of purchase, and for this reason, the masterâ€™s notice of the\r\n  condemnation award is inconsequential.Â  Stated differently, to the extent\r\n  Atlantic Title argues that the masterâ€™s order bases its determination of the\r\n  value of Stanleyâ€™s land on the prior condemnation award, this contention is\r\n  incorrect.Â  The general rule in South Carolina is that a landowner is permitted\r\n  to testify to the value of his land, South Carolina State Hwy. Depâ€™t v.\r\n    Wilson, 254 S.C. 360, 370, 175 S.E.2d 391, 397 (1970), and Atlantic Title\r\n  does not dispute Stanleyâ€™s testimony in this regard.\r\nBecause the master\r\n  did not base his â€œtime of purchaseâ€ valuation of Stanleyâ€™s land on the amount\r\n  of the prior condemnation settlement, the question of whether the master erred\r\n  in taking judicial notice of the settlement is, in this case, purely academic.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold that the masterâ€™s conclusion that Stanleyâ€™s land was worth\r\n  $100,000 at the time of purchase is reasonably supported by the evidence in the\r\n  record.\r\nII.Â  Measure of Damages\r\nAtlantic Title argues that the master erred in\r\n  determining the value of Stanleyâ€™s title insurance claim based on the complete\r\n  loss of the portion of his property affected by the drainage field.Â  Atlantic\r\n  Title argues that Stanley still owns the entire property and that his title is\r\n  not impacted beyond a reduction in the overall value of the property.Â  Although\r\n  we agree with Atlantic Titleâ€™s argument in principle, this is not an accurate\r\n  characterization of the case it put forth at trial.Â  For this reason, the\r\n  argument is accordingly not preserved for review.\r\nA title insurer is generally liable for losses or\r\n  damages caused by defects in the propertyâ€™s title, and defects for which title\r\n  insurance policies provide coverage may generally be defined as liens and\r\n  encumbrances that result in a loss in the titleâ€™s value.Â  46 C.J.S. Insurance Â§ 1736 (2007); 43 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance Â§ 528 (2003).Â  Depending on\r\n  the circumstances, the loss of a titleâ€™s value can be measured in a variety of\r\n  ways.Â  For instance, an ownerâ€™s loss can be the fair market value of a portion\r\n  of property which has proven completely unmarketable; the cost of removing the\r\n  defect from the property; or the difference in the values of the property with\r\n  and without the defect.Â  46 C.J.S. Â§ 1739; 29A Am. Jur. Insurance Â§ 1601\r\n  (1960).Â  The terms of individual insurance agreements can control the method of\r\n  valuation, but the purpose of title\r\n  insurance has been stated as seeking to place the insured in the position that\r\n  he thought he occupied when the policy was issued.Â  46 C.J.S. Â§1736.\r\nThe fact that\r\n  property may be useless or may be put to only limited use does not mean that\r\n  the property is not marketable.Â  See 43 Am. Jur. 2d Â§ 528.Â  This has\r\n  been recognized in South Carolina jurisprudence, most recently by the court of\r\n  appeals in the case McMaster v. Strickland, 305 S.C. 527, 409 S.E.2d 440\r\n  (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In that case, a purchaser bought property with the intention\r\n  of developing it.Â  When the property was designated as wetlands, the purchaser\r\n  claimed his title was unmarketable.Â  The court of appeals held that there was\r\n  no evidence the title was unmarketable because â€œthere is no evidence that the\r\n  sellers do not own the property . . . [f]urther, there is no evidence it was\r\n  unlawful to sell the property[.]Â  [T]herefore it is legally, if not actually\r\n  marketable.â€Â  Id. at 531, 409 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nThis analysis reveals an error in the order below.Â  Specifically,\r\n  although a portion of Stanleyâ€™s property is undoubtedly encumbered by the\r\n  drainage field and may be functionally useless, it is still marketable, and the\r\n  master was wrong to conclude otherwise.Â  The argument accordingly goes that by\r\n  being compensated for the full value of the affected portion of his land while\r\n  he retains marketable title, Stanley is being overcompensated.Â  Framed in terms\r\n  of the guidepost that damages should be measured by the value of the title\r\n  Stanley thought he was getting versus the value of the title he received, the\r\n  suggestion is that because Stanley insured his title based on the expectation\r\n  that he was purchasing a tract of lakefront land completely free from\r\n  encumbrances, if a third of his tract is now encumbered, the measure of damages\r\n  ought to be the difference in value of his whole property (including the\r\n  useless portion), and the value of the property if the defect did not exist.Â  For\r\n  this reason, it appears that the master erred in awarding damages based on the total\r\n  deprivation of the value of the third of an acre affected by the drain field.Â \r\n  Such an award treats the third of an acre as if it has been taken.Â  Thus, at\r\n  first blush, it would seem that this case should be reversed for an award of\r\n  damages according to the appropriate standard.\r\nBut what\r\n  was the method of valuing damages that Atlantic Title offered at trial?Â  The\r\n  record reflects that Atlantic Title focused its case on the testimony of an\r\n  appraiser who testified that he divided Stanleyâ€™s land for appraisal purposes\r\n  into two portions: (1) enough land to support the building and the boat docks\r\n  and (2) the remainder.Â  Setting aside the land needed to support the building\r\n  and the boat docks, the appraiser testified that comparisons with similar\r\n  properties demonstrated an unencumbered land value of $24,000 and an encumbered\r\n  value of $20,000.Â  The appraiser accordingly estimated the damage to Stanleyâ€™s property at $4,000, and Atlantic Title argues on appeal that this evidence is\r\n  the only evidence in the record which properly values Stanleyâ€™s loss.\r\nUpon\r\n  closer review, however, it is clear that the appraiserâ€™s report neither employs\r\n  the proper valuation method for this type of title insurance claim nor does it\r\n  properly value Stanleyâ€™s loss.Â  While the appraiserâ€™s report assumes that Stanley owns and operates the building and boat ramp, as a result of the D.O.T.â€™s\r\n  condemnation, Stanley certainly does not.Â  Similarly, the report does not value\r\n  Stanleyâ€™s property as land having lake access, and furthermore, the appraiser\r\n  testified at trial that he determined the value of Stanleyâ€™s property by\r\n  examining comparable sales along Highway 378, and that none of these properties\r\n  had lake access.Â  This report does not accurately describe or value Stanleyâ€™s land, and more importantly, the report does not analyze the land in the manner that\r\n  Atlantic Title argues is proper.Â  Stated differently, the report does not\r\n  compare the encumbered value of the entire tract of Stanleyâ€™s land with what\r\n  the value of the entire tract of land would be without any encumbrances.\r\nIt\r\n  is axiomatic that â€œ[t]he losing party must first try to convince the lower\r\n  court it . . . has ruled wrongly and then, if that effort fails, convince the\r\n  appellate court that the lower court erred.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000).Â  In this case, the\r\n  argument on appeal differs, in our view markedly, from the theory of the case\r\n  presented at trial.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision on the\r\n  grounds that Atlantic Titleâ€™s valuation argument is not preserved for review.\r\nIII.Â  Statute of\r\n  Limitations\r\nAtlantic\r\n  Title argues that Stanleyâ€™s claim is barred by the three-year statute of\r\n  limitations for contract actions found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(a) (2005).Â \r\n  To support this argument, Atlantic Title notes that Stanley filed his complaint\r\n  in May of 2004 and relies on a letter it sent to Stanley in May of 2001 during\r\n  negotiations regarding the drainage field.Â  The letter provides:\r\n\r\n\tIn order\r\n  to induce the temporary forbearance of Larry Stanley from filing suit on the\r\n  above-referenced claim for a period of thirty (30) days, Atlantic Title []\r\n  waives any defense of the statute of limitations or laches, unless the statute\r\n  of limitations would apply to an action brought on May 21, 2001.\r\n\r\nAccording to Atlantic Title,\r\n  the letter operated to waive the statute of limitations defense for a limited\r\n  period of thirty days.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis argument is\r\n  foreclosed by the terms of Atlantic Titleâ€™s letter.Â  Specifically, Atlantic\r\n  Title misreads the waiver provision by interpreting â€œtemporary,â€ which\r\n  describes the character of Stanleyâ€™s delay in filing suit, as modifying the\r\n  unequivocal language describing the waiver of the statute of limitations and laches defenses.Â  Agreements, in general, are interpreted according to the terms the parties have used, and the terms are to be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s\r\n    Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 110, 531 S.E.2d 287, 293 (2000).Â  We find that Atlantic\r\n  Titleâ€™s reading of the letter as a thirty-day â€œtemporary tolling agreementâ€ is\r\n  simply not supported by the letterâ€™s terms.\r\nFor this reason, we affirm the masterâ€™s decision that Atlantic\r\n  Titleâ€™s letter waived its ability to assert the statute of limitations as a\r\n  defense to Stanleyâ€™s claim.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing analysis, we affirm the masterâ€™s decision.Â  We specifically hold\r\n  that there is evidence in the record which reasonably supports the masterâ€™s\r\n  ruling that the value of Stanleyâ€™s land was $100,000 per acre at the time of\r\n  purchase; that Atlantic Titleâ€™s argument regarding valuation methods is not\r\n  preserved for review; and that Atlantic Titleâ€™s letter waived its ability to\r\n  assert the statute of limitations as a defense in this case.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice E.

Capell, of Mullen Wylie &amp; Seekings, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJoseph Ransom Barker, of McNair Law Firm, of Hilton Head Island,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  This is an appeal from a\r\n  grant of summary judgment to respondent Joe Breedlove (Breedlove).Â  The suit\r\n  arose out of the appellant Danielle Smithâ€™s (Smithâ€™s) purchase of a home from\r\n  Breedlove that was allegedly defectively constructed.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  1993, Breedlove decided to build a single family residence on a vacant lot he\r\n  owned in Hilton Head.Â  He had retired from the United States Army in order to\r\n  help provide care for his son, who suffered from juvenile diabetes.Â  Breedlove\r\n  taught at a private school for a period of five years, including the time the\r\n  residence was constructed.Â  Breedlove planned to build the home for himself and\r\n  his family, and he did not have any agreement or intention to sell the\r\n  residence.\r\nBreedlove\r\n  chose not to hire a general contractor, and he entered into a contract with Merrill\r\n  Pasco (Pasco) for Pasco to provide services as an architect in designing and\r\n  preparing the plans and specifications for Breedloveâ€™s home.Â  Pasco further\r\n  recommended the services of Stanley Fronczak (Fronczak), a cabinet installer,\r\n  and Fronczak assisted Breedlove in choosing other residential specialty\r\n  contractors (contractors) to provide additional services in completing the\r\n  home.\r\nAlthough\r\n  Breedlove had never been employed in the construction industry nor done\r\n  business as a general contractor, he entered into agreements with various\r\n  contractors for their services in the construction of the home.Â  Breedlove directly\r\n  paid the contractors and the materials suppliers.\r\nDuring\r\n  the period of construction, Breedloveâ€™s name appeared as the owner and general\r\n  contractor on various documents.Â  These include the application for the\r\n  building permit, the building permit itself, the application for water and\r\n  sewer service, the elevator contract, the proposal for propane gas service, the\r\n  application for approval and related documents from the neighborhood in which\r\n  the house was to be located, credit applications, and other documents on which\r\n  it was necessary for Breedlove to identify a contractor or builder in order to\r\n  be able to move forward with the construction process.Â  \r\nA\r\n  certificate of occupancy was issued on July 15, 1994, and it also listed\r\n  Breedlove as the owner and general contractor.Â  Breedlove and his family moved\r\n  into the residence, and the evidence showed that the Breedloves intended to stay\r\n  in that home for the remainder of their lives.\r\nIn\r\n  1997, Breedloveâ€™s son graduated from high school and began college in Atlanta.Â  Breedlove and his wife decided to rent an apartment near the university to\r\n  provide his son a place where his medical needs would be better met, as opposed\r\n  to a dormitory setting.Â  Breedlove and his wife spent a large amount of time at\r\n  the Atlanta apartment and only lived part-time at their Hilton Head residence.Â \r\n  It became too expensive and inconvenient to maintain both the Atlanta apartment\r\n  and their Hilton Head home, and the Breedloves decided to sell the Hilton Head\r\n  home in 1998.\r\nIn\r\n  July 1998, Breedlove entered into a contract of sale with Smith and her\r\n  husband, Courtney Hill,[1] for the sale of the residence.Â  The contract provided that the purchasers had\r\n  inspected the property and were buying the home â€œas is.â€ Â Smith stated that the\r\n  only inspection done before delivery of the deed was performed by Hill, who had\r\n  previously been involved in constructing homes.Â  \r\nSeveral\r\n  years after moving into the home, Smith discovered the residence was partially\r\n  clad with synthetic stucco known as exterior insulation and finish system (EIFS).Â \r\n  She retained a forensic architect, and his investigations revealed numerous\r\n  defects.Â  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  2002, Smith filed suit alleging causes of action for negligence and breach of\r\n  implied warranty of workmanship against Breedlove and Pasco; she also alleged\r\n  negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty against the EIFS\r\n  manufacturer Dryvit Systems (Dryvit).Â  The complaint alleged Breedlove acted as\r\n  the general contractor during construction of the home and that such\r\n  construction was performed in a negligent and defective manner.[2]\r\nIn\r\n  2003, Breedlove filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  His motion was\r\n  accompanied by his own affidavit in support of the motion, and Smith replied\r\n  with affidavits and exhibits from Pasco, the forensic architect, and a general\r\n  contractor she had retained as an expert.Â  The Hon. Curtis Coltrane issued an\r\n  Order denying Breedloveâ€™s motion.Â  No depositions had been taken at the time\r\n  this motion was argued in 2003.\r\nIn\r\n  2005, Breedlove again moved for summary judgment, and the circuit court\r\n  postponed a hearing on the merits to enable the parties to complete discovery.Â \r\n  The depositions of Breedlove, Smith, Smithâ€™s expert witnesses, Solak, Torres,\r\n  and Jerry Parker of JP Construction all took place after Breedloveâ€™s first\r\n  motion for summary judgment and before the hearing on his second motion.Â  After\r\n  a hearing, the Hon. Jackson Gregory granted Breedloveâ€™s second motion for\r\n  summary judgment in 2006.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the circuit\r\n  court err in granting summary judgment to Breedlove?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA trial court may\r\n  properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions,\r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\n  affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\r\n  and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€ Â Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate\r\n  court applies the same standard that governs the trial court. Â David v.\r\n    McLeod Regl. Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, Â 626 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2006).Â  The\r\n  appellate court, like the trial court, must view all ambiguities, conclusions,\r\n  and all inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable\r\n  to the non-moving party below. Â Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nSmith first argues\r\n  that Breedloveâ€™s second motion for summary judgment is barred by Rule 43(l), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 43(l), SCRCP,\r\n  provides, â€œIf any motion be made to any judge and be denied, in whole or in\r\n  part, or be granted conditionally, no subsequent motion upon the same set of\r\n  facts shall be made to any other judge in that action.â€Â  The fact that a\r\n  different trial judge previously denied a motion for summary judgment does not\r\n  preclude the moving party from renewing its motion once new evidence is\r\n  gathered.Â  Dorrell v. S.C. Dept. of Transp., 361 S.C. 312, 325, 605\r\n  S.E.2d 12, 19 (2004).\r\nIn this case,\r\n  although the legal basis of Breedloveâ€™s motions for summary judgment was the\r\n  same in 2003 and 2005, considerable discovery had taken place and new evidence\r\n  had been established.Â  Contrary to Smithâ€™s contentions, it does not matter that\r\n  Smith conducted the discovery or that some of the evidence was arguably\r\n  favorable to Smith.Â  The rule requires a different â€œset of facts,â€ which were established\r\n  due to the substantial amount of discovery that occurred after Breedloveâ€™s\r\n  first summary judgment motion.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in hearing\r\n  Breedloveâ€™s second motion for summary judgment after discovery had taken place.\r\nOn the merits,\r\n  Smith claims her first cause of action for breach of warranty of workmanlike\r\n  service is dependent upon Breedloveâ€™s status as a general contractor.Â \r\n  Specifically, Smith argues that because builders and general contractors\r\n  impliedly warrant that the work will be done in a workmanlike manner, all she\r\n  needs to prove to defeat Breedloveâ€™s summary judgment motion is that there is a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact whether Breedlove was a general contractor.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAlthough we agree\r\n  with Smith that a genuine issue of fact exists in determining whether Breedlove\r\n  acted as a general contractor, this fact is not â€œmaterialâ€ insofar as it\r\n  impacts our analysis.Â  The grant of summary judgment in favor of Breedlove did\r\n  not solely result from the finding that Breedlove was not a general contractor,\r\n  but rather the circuit court determined that the implied warranty of\r\n  workmanlike service only applies to builders in the business of building new dwellings\r\n  for sale.Â  Thus, the crucial issue is whether Breedlove, even if deemed a general\r\n  contractor, can be held liable under an implied warranty of workmanlike service\r\n  theory where he was not in the business of constructing houses and did not\r\n  build the home to sell.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nA builder who\r\n  contracts to construct a dwelling impliedly warrants that the work undertaken\r\n  will be performed in a careful, diligent, workmanlike manner.Â  Kennedy v.\r\n    Columbia Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.C. 335, 344, 384 S.E.2d 730,\r\n  736 (1989).Â  This is distinct from an implied warranty of habitability, which\r\n  arises solely out of the sale of the home.Â  Id.Â  Although the warranty\r\n  of workmanlike service arises out of the construction contract to which the\r\n  builder is a party, a subsequent purchaser may sue a professional builder on\r\n  the implied warranty of workmanlike service despite the lack of contractual\r\n  privity.Â  Id.\r\nStarting with Rutledge\r\n  v. Dodenoff, 254 S.C. 407, 175 S.E.2d 792 (1970), the doctrine of caveat\r\n  emptor has been weakened so that a purchaser of a home may hold the\r\n  â€œbuilder-vendorâ€[3] liable on the theory of breach of an implied warranty of workmanship.Â  As\r\n  stated in Rutledge, the rationale behind this implied warranty is based\r\n  on the relative bargaining positions of the parties:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  rationale of the decisions which hold the builder-vendor of a new house liable\r\n  on the basis of an implied warranty is that the seller and buyer are not on an\r\n  equal footing in such a transactionâ€¦.[T]he primary purpose of the transaction\r\n  is to provide the purchaser with a habitable dwelling and the transfer of the\r\n  land is secondary.Â  The seller holds himself out as an expert in such\r\n  construction and the prospective purchaser, if he buys, is forced to a large\r\n  extent to rely on the skill of the builder.Â  This is true because the ordinary\r\n  purchaser is precluded from making a knowledgeable inspection of the completed\r\n  house not only because of the expense and his unfamiliarity with building\r\n  construction, but also because the defects are usually hidden rendering\r\n  inspection practically impossible.Â  Under such circumstances, the purchaser is\r\n  at the mercy of the builder-vendor.\r\n\r\nRutledge, 254 S.C. at 413-414, 175 S.E.2d at 795.\r\nThe Court later\r\n  extended the availability of implied warranties of â€œmerchantabilityâ€ and\r\n  fitness for an intended purpose to subsequent purchasers.Â  Terlinde v. Neely,\r\n  275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768 (1980).Â  Although the warranty at issue in Terlinde is distinguishable from the implied warranty of workmanlike service, the Terlinde Courtâ€™s reasoning is instructive:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  extension of implied warranties to subsequent purchasers is based upon sound\r\n  legal and policy considerations.Â  Respondents constructed the dwelling and, as\r\n  the builder, held out their expertise to prospective buyersâ€¦.Furthermore, the\r\n  character of society has changed such that the ordinary buyer is not in a\r\n  position to discover hidden defects in a structure, especially at a time when\r\n  he is provided more elaborate furnishings which tend to obscure the structural\r\n  integrity of the facility.Â  The fact that the subsequent purchaser did not know\r\n  the home builder, as did the original purchaser, does not negate the reality of\r\n  the â€œholding outâ€ of the builderâ€™s expertise and reliance which occurs in the\r\n  market place.\r\n\r\nTerlinde, 275 at 397-398 , 271 S.E.2d at 769.Â  Thus, the\r\n  rationale supporting the imposition of liability for breach of an implied\r\n  warranty of workmanlike service is that the purchaser is forced to rely on the\r\n  skill of the professional builder.Â  See Kennedy, supra (extending reasoning of Terlinde to the implied warranty of workmanlike\r\n  service).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   The considerations in favor of imposing liability on\r\n  professional builders and professional general contractors do not favor\r\n  liability on Breedlove for the alleged breach of the implied warranty of\r\n  workmanlike service.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the record before us, we do not believe this is a case where an innocent and\r\n  defenseless purchaser could not protect herself from an experienced and skilled\r\n  construction professional.Â  Breedlove never held himself out to Smith or anyone\r\n  else to be a licensed general contractor with expertise in construction.Â  In\r\n  fact, Smith admitted that she knew around the time of the closing that\r\n  Breedlove built the house for his family.Â  Breedlove never made any\r\n  misrepresentations as to his expertise or involvement with the construction of\r\n  the home.Â  Smith had every chance to have the residence inspected before\r\n  delivery of the deed, but she relied on her husbandâ€™s cursory inspection.Â \r\n  Simply put, this was not a one-sided transaction where Smith had no choice but\r\n  to rely on the construction skill and expertise of Breedlove.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  hold that the circuit court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of\r\n  Breedlove on Smithâ€™s implied warranty claim because he was not in the business\r\n  of constructing homes and because our policy of protecting purchasers, who must\r\n  rely on the skill and expertise of professional builders, is not implicated by\r\n  the facts of this case.\r\nSmith next argues\r\n  the circuit erred in granting summary judgment on her negligence claim due to\r\n  its finding that Breedlove owed Smith no duty.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found that Breedlove did not owe Smith a duty of care in the construction of\r\n  the home because he did not undertake and agree to construct the residence for\r\n  Smith or for anyone else.Â  The circuit court held that the undertaking or\r\n  agreement to construct a dwelling for another is what creates the duty to\r\n  exercise and use due care in the construction of that dwelling.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  because Breedlove never agreed to build the home for Smith or anyone else, then\r\n  no duty arose for which he could be liable for an alleged breach.\r\nWe agree with the\r\n  circuit court that the crucial undisputed fact is that Breedlove, when he\r\n  constructed the residence, did not build or plan to build the home for anyone\r\n  but his family.Â  He simply did not owe a duty to any future purchaser when no\r\n  such sale was reasonably expected.Â  As the Court stated in Terlinde:\r\n\r\n\tThe key\r\n  inquiry is foreseeability, not privity.Â  In our mobile society, it is clearly\r\n  foreseeable that more than the original purchaser will seek to enjoy the fruits\r\n  of the builderâ€™s efforts. The plaintiffs, being a member of the class for which\r\n  the home was constructed, are entitled to a duty of care in construction\r\n  commensurate with industry standards.Â  In the light of the fact that the home\r\n  was constructed as speculative, the home builder cannot reasonably argue he\r\n  envisioned anything but a class of purchasers.Â  By placing this product into\r\n  the stream of commerce, the builder owes a duty of care to those who will use\r\n  his product, so as to render him accountable for negligent workmanship.\r\n\r\nTerlinde, 275 S.C. at 399, 271 S.E.2d at 770.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  it was not reasonably foreseeable that Breedloveâ€™s home would be exposed to a\r\n  known or speculative â€œclass of purchasers,â€ Breedlove was properly granted\r\n  summary judgment on Smithâ€™s negligence claim.Â  To hold that a duty arose because\r\n  it was foreseeable that Breedlove would eventually sell the property, in light\r\n  of the evidence in the record that the sole purpose for construction was as a\r\n  permanent residence for Breedlove himself, would completely obviate the\r\n  foreseeability requirement in determining the existence of a duty.Â  In other\r\n  words, while possible that Breedloveâ€™s home would eventually be purchased or\r\n  occupied by another owner, this remote possibility, under the facts of this\r\n  case, was not reasonably foreseeable so as to create a duty on behalf of\r\n  Breedlove.Â  Accordingly, summary judgment was appropriate.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that\r\n  summary judgment was properly granted in favor of Breedlove on Smithâ€™s actions\r\n  for breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service and for negligence.Â \r\n  The order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BEATTY, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Hill and Smith have since divorced, and Hill is\r\n  not a party to this action.\r\n[2] In response, Breedlove filed a third-party complaint\r\n  against the contractors Solak, JP Construction, Torres, and Fronczak.Â  Torres\r\n  subsequently filed a fourth-party complaint against an additional EIFS\r\n  manufacturer Contractors Specialty Supply and against the window manufacturer\r\n  Pella Window and Door.\r\n[3] A builder-vendor is a party who is engaged in the\r\n  business of building and selling new dwellings.Â  Rogers v.

Rule\r\n  8.4(b) (lawyer shall not commit a\r\n    criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness\r\n    or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(d) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty,\r\n  fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice).Â  Respondent admits his misconduct is grounds for\r\n  discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1)\r\n  (it is a ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (it is a ground for discipline for lawyer to be\r\n  convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or a serious crime); and Rule 7(a)(5)\r\n  (it is a ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to\r\n  pollute administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal\r\n  profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice\r\n  law).Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent, retroactive to the date of his interim\r\n  suspension.Â  In the Matter of Sexton, supra.Â  Within fifteen (15)\r\n  days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the\r\n  Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to\r\n  the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondentâ€™s Motion for Requirement of\r\n  Submission of Briefs and Motion for Oral Argument are denied.Â  \r\n[2] The acts giving rise to respondentâ€™s criminal\r\n  conduct occurred prior to his admission to the practice of law on March 13,\r\n  2002.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1680 (1986).Â  In 1989, the United\r\n  States Supreme Court held the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity and 4\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 111 (1997), prohibited the states from taxing federal government\r\n  retirees at a greater rate than state and local government retirees.Â  Davis\r\n    v. Michigan Depâ€™t of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 818 (1989).Â  The Court\r\n  informed states they could cure the problem â€œeither by extending the tax\r\n  exemption to retired federal employees (or to all retired employees), or by\r\n  eliminating the tax exemption for retired state and local government\r\n  employees.â€Â  Id.Â  In response to Davis, our Legislature sought to\r\n  standardize state taxation on both federal and state retirees by deleting the\r\n  full tax exemption to state and local government retirees, increasing state\r\n  retirement benefits by 7%, and allowing a comprehensive exemption for only the\r\n  first $3,000 of all government retirement benefits.Â  Act No. 189, Part II, Â§\r\n  39, 1989 S.C. Acts 1436 (Act 189).[1]\r\nAnonymous\r\n  Taxpayer (Appellant) retired in 1997 and filed an action on behalf of himself\r\n  and all other similarly situated state retirees in 1998 against the State, the\r\n  different State Retirement Systems, the Department of Revenue, and the Budget\r\n  and Control Board.Â  Appellant alleged breach of contract and challenged the\r\n  constitutionality of Act 189.Â  The trial court denied the Stateâ€™s motion to\r\n  dismiss for failure to exhaust the administrative remedies.Â  Finding retirees\r\n  had no contractual or property right in a tax exemption, the court granted the\r\n  Stateâ€™s motion to dismiss for failure of the complaint to state a cause of\r\n  action.Â  \r\nThis Court reversed, finding:Â  (1) the trial court should have\r\n  dismissed the matter without prejudice because the retirees failed to first\r\n  exhaust their administrative remedies; and (2) the trial court erred in\r\n  granting a motion to dismiss on the novel issue of whether the retirees had\r\n  constitutional causes of action for impairment of contract and taking without\r\n  just compensation.Â  Evans v. State, 344 S.C. 60, 67-69, 543 S.E.2d 547,\r\n  551 (2001).Â  The Court found pursuing administrative remedies would not deprive\r\n  retirees of their constitutional right to a jury trial on their breach of\r\n  contract cause of action.Â  The Court noted that, assuming there was a valid\r\n  contract between retirees and the Retirement Systems, the Retirement Systems\r\n  could not be held liable for any alleged breach once Act 189 became effective\r\n  because performance would have been rendered impossible by the enactment of\r\n  law, and thus, retirees did not have a valid breach of contract action.Â  Evans,\r\n  344 S.C. at 67, 543 S.E.2d at 551 (â€œSince State Retirees do not have a viable\r\n  breach of contract action, pursuing their action through the administrative\r\n  process does not violate their right to a jury trial.â€).Â  The case was remanded\r\n  to the trial court, dismissed without prejudice, and pursued through\r\n  administrative channels.[2]\r\nOn\r\n  August 31, 2001, the Department of Revenue issued a final order denying\r\n  Appellantâ€™s request for a refund of the amount of tax paid after the enactment\r\n  of Act 189.Â  The Department found:Â  Appellantâ€™s claims were barred by the\r\n  statute of limitations; there was no contractual right to the tax exemption;\r\n  even assuming there was a contract, there was no substantial impairment of the\r\n  contract; if there was a substantial impairment, repeal of the tax exemption\r\n  was reasonable and necessary to carry out the legitimate government purpose;\r\n  and repeal of the exemption did not amount to a taking.Â  The Department also\r\n  found that Appellant could not file a claim for a refund on behalf of a class.Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  requested a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Court (ALC) on\r\n  behalf of himself and all similarly situated state retirees, restating his\r\n  impairment of contract, taking without just compensation, and denial of due\r\n  process claims.Â  The ALC issued an order on June 14, 2002, initially granting\r\n  Appellant partial summary judgment by concluding the retirement code gave rise\r\n  to a contract between the State and retirees.Â  However, the ALC vacated this\r\n  order upon reconsideration.Â  The matter was submitted upon stipulations,\r\n  depositions, and briefs.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 20, 2003, the ALC denied Appellantâ€™s motion for class certification,\r\n  finding:Â  (1) there was no language in the Revenue Procedures Act that provided\r\n  for class actions; (2) the Act required the Department to issue refunds to any\r\n  other taxpayer who had also applied for refunds once a taxpayer prevails on his\r\n  claim that a tax was imposed wrongfully; and (3) the Act stated that there was\r\n  no â€œother remedy than those providedâ€ in the Act, such that a class action suit\r\n  would be barred.Â  On April 29, 2004, the ALC issued its final order on the\r\n  merits, finding:Â  (1) the statute of limitations barred Appellantâ€™s claims; (2)\r\n  the contract cause of action failed on the merits because Appellant could not\r\n  prove there was a contract, there was a substantial impairment of the contract,\r\n  or that Act 189 was not reasonable or necessary; and (3) Appellant failed to\r\n  prove Act 189 constituted a taking of private property without just\r\n  compensation or that it was a deprivation of property without due process of\r\n  law.Â  The ALC dismissed Appellantâ€™s claims and denied all relief.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed the ALCâ€™s findings on appeal.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Impairment\r\n  of Contract\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the enactment of Act 189 impaired his retirement contract, thus\r\n  violating the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution.Â  In discussing\r\n  the Contract Clause, the Supreme Court said, â€œAlthough the Contract Clause appears literally to\r\n  proscribe â€˜anyâ€™ impairment, . . . â€˜the prohibition is not an absolute one and\r\n  is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula.â€™â€ Â United\r\n    States Trust Co. of New York v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 21 (1977) (quoting Home\r\n      Bldg. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 428 (1934)). Â â€œThe\r\n  Contract Clause is not an absolute bar to subsequent modification of a Stateâ€™s\r\n  own financial obligations. Â As with\r\n  laws impairing the obligations of private contracts, an impairment may be\r\n  constitutional if it is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public\r\n  purpose.â€ Â United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 25. Â To establish a\r\n  contract clause violation, Appellant must show To establish a contract clause violation, Appellant must\r\n  show:Â  (1) the existence of a contract; (2) the law changed actually impaired\r\n  the contract and the impairment was substantial; and (3) the law was not\r\n  reasonable and necessary to carry out a legitimate government purpose.Â  Hodges\r\n    v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 93, 533 S.E.2d 578, 585 (2000).Â  \r\nA. Existence\r\n  of Contract\r\nThe\r\n  major question in this case is whether the pre-Act 189 tax exemption amounted\r\n  to a contract.Â  Appellant argues a contract existed based on the contractually-significant\r\n  language used in the Retirement Code.Â  \r\nâ€œGenerally,\r\n  statutes do not create contractual rights.â€Â  Layman v. State, 368 S.C.\r\n  631, 637, 630 S.E.2d 265, 268 (2006).Â  However, a contract created by statute\r\n  may be found to exist in this state only where contractual rights are expressly\r\n  found in the language of the statute.Â  Id. at 638, 630 S.E.2d at 268.Â \r\n  Specifically, the Court looks for contractually-significant language within the\r\n  statute in determining whether a contract was intended to be created by the\r\n  Legislature.Â  Id. at 641, 630 S.E.2d at 270.Â  In Layman, the\r\n  contractually-significant language included words to the effect that a â€œmember\r\n  who is eligible,â€ â€œcomplies with the requirements of this article,â€\r\n  and â€œshall agree.â€Â  Id. at 639, 630 S.E.2d at 269.\r\n\r\n\tFormer\r\n  section 9-1-1680 contained the following language:Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe right of a person to an annuity or retirement allowance or to\r\n  the return of contributions, an annuity or retirement allowance itself, any\r\n  optional benefit or any other right accrued or accruing to any person under the\r\n  provisions of this chapter, and the moneys of the System created hereunder, are\r\n  hereby exempted from any State or municipal tax and exempted from levy and\r\n  sale, garnishment, attachment or any other process whatsoever and shall be\r\n  unassignable except as herein specifically otherwise provided. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1680 (1986).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  reviewing this statute, the circuit court held there was no contractually-significant\r\n  language that would evidence the Legislatureâ€™s intent for the tax exemption to\r\n  be contractually binding.Â  Appellant argues, however, that language from other\r\n  sections of the entire Retirement Code renders all the subsections in the Code,\r\n  including the tax exemption, a contract with state retirees.Â  This argument is\r\n  unavailing in light of our opinion in Layman where the language of the\r\n  statute sections were evaluated individually for contractually-significant\r\n  language.Â  See Layman, 368 S.C. at 643, 630 S.E.2d at 271\r\n  (evaluating separately the TERI statute and the working retirees statute, both\r\n  found within the Retirement Code, to determine that the former TERI statute\r\n  amounted to a contract and the former working retiree statute did not). Â Appellant\r\n  cannot pick separate language from separate sections within the entire Code to\r\n  render the prior tax exemption a contract.Â  \r\nFurther, despite the fact that section 9-1-1680 is found in the\r\n  Retirement Code and it deals with issues other than just taxation, the portion\r\n  of the statute at issue here is a tax law subject to modification.[3]Â  See Ward v. State, 356\r\n  S.C. 449, 453, 590 S.E.2d 30, 32 (2003) (evaluating whether Act 189 was\r\n  constitutional in light of the fact that it increased the retirement benefits\r\n  given to State retirees while taxing federal retirees at the previous level;\r\n  the Court noted that the General Assembly amended South Carolinaâ€™s tax statute\r\n  in enacting Act 189 to comply with Davis); Rivers v. State, 327\r\n  S.C. 271, 274, 490 S.E.2d 261, 263 (1997) (noting that taxpayers have no vested\r\n  interest in tax laws remaining unchanged); Lloyd v. Lloyd, 295 S.C. 55,\r\n  57-58, 367 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1988) (noting that although section 9-1-1680 stated\r\n  that retirement income could not be garnished, section 20-7-1315 was a more\r\n  recent and more specific statute and it allowed garnishment of state retirement\r\n  income to pay a family court support obligation in a proper case;Â  thus, the\r\n  statute was not irrevocable).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  section 9-1-1680 did not create a contract because it did not contain\r\n  contractually-significant language, it was a tax law, and it was subject to\r\n  modification.Â  Thus, Appellant has failed to prove the first element of his\r\n  impairment of contract claim.Â Â  \r\nB. Actual and\r\n  Substantial Impairment of the Contract\r\nEven assuming\r\n  there was a contract, Appellant must prove the second element in an impairment\r\n  of contract claim regarding whether there was a substantial impairment to the\r\n  contract.Â  Appellant argues that the ALC and the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  the 7% retirement benefits increase â€œfairly offsetâ€ the loss of the tax\r\n  exemption because, assuming retirement benefits of $100 and the 7% increase of\r\n  $7, he would be taxed on $107 at a rate of 7%, which would be $7.49 in taxes.Â \r\n  Thus, he argues, he will always be $0.49 worse off under Act 189 than he would\r\n  be under prior section 9-1-1680.Â  We find this calculation unpersuasive because\r\n  it fails to consider the tax exemption given to Appellant as a state employee.[4]Â  \r\nA\r\n  statute is viewed as substantially impairing a contract, for Contract Clause\r\n  analysis, where it alters the reasonable expectations of the contracting\r\n  parties.Â  Hodges, 341 S.C. at 94, 533 S.E.2d at 585-86.Â  In discussing\r\n  the impairment of contract claim in Evans, this Court noted that\r\n  testimony â€œmay have revealed Act 189â€™s 7% increase in retirement benefits\r\n  fairly offset any financial loss to State Retirees resulting from Act 189â€™s\r\n  deletion of the full tax exemption for state retirement benefits.â€Â  Evans,\r\n  344 S.C. at 68, 543 S.E.2d at 551.Â  \r\nTaking the cue from the Evans decision, the ALC accepted a\r\n  deposition and affidavit from the Departmentâ€™s expert, R. Kent Porth, analyzing\r\n  the impact of Act 189 on Appellant.Â  Reviewing Appellantâ€™s income tax returns\r\n  from the years 1997 through 2001, Porth opined that the 7% increase in\r\n  retirement benefits more than offset the increased tax burden resulting from\r\n  the enactment of Act 189 in nearly every taxable year.Â  Although Appellant\r\n  disagreed with Porthâ€™s calculation method, Porth was the only expert presented\r\n  below for the ALCâ€™s consideration.Â  The ALC found, and the circuit court\r\n  affirmed the finding, that the 7% retirement benefits increase fairly offset\r\n  the loss of the tax exemption such that there was no substantial impairment of\r\n  the contract.Â  \r\nThe ALCâ€™s finding that there was no substantial impairment of the contract because\r\n  the loss of the tax exemption was fairly offset by the 7% increase in benefits\r\n  is supported by the substantial evidence in the record. Â See S.C.\r\n    Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  363 S.C. 67, 73, 610 S.E.2d 482, 485 (2005) (noting there is a substantial\r\n  evidence standard of review from the decision of the ALC).Â  While Appellantâ€™s\r\n  generalized calculation would appear to indicate Act 189 was detrimental, his\r\n  calculation does not take into consideration the specific deductions and\r\n  exemptions from Appellantâ€™s retirement income like a review of his tax returns\r\n  would.Â  Â \r\nC.Â  Reasonable\r\n  and Necessary\r\nThe final\r\n  element to an impairment of contract claim is whether the impairment was\r\n  reasonable and necessary to carry out a legitimate state purpose.Â  Appellant\r\n  argues that although Davis mandated that the states impose state taxes\r\n  on state and federal retirees equally, it did not mandate that the states\r\n  remedy the situation by impairing contracts.Â  \r\nBoth\r\n  the ALC and the circuit court found that enacting Act 189 was reasonable and\r\n  necessary to accomplish the legitimate state purpose of complying with Davis.Â  This Court has noted that Act 189 was specifically enacted to follow the\r\n  dictate of Davis.Â  Ward, 356 S.C. at 453, 590 S.E.2d at 32.Â  Complying\r\n  with the mandates of Davis is a legitimate government purpose and Act\r\n  189 reasonably and necessarily accomplished that goal by taxing state and\r\n  federal retirees equally.Â  Because Act 189 was a reasonable response to Davis, it did not amount to an impairment of contract.Â  Ken Moorhead Oil Co. v.\r\n    Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 532, 547, 476 S.E.2d 481, 489 (1996)\r\n  (noting that where a legislative enactment is reasonable, the Court defers to\r\n  the legislature and rejects any impairment of contract claim).\r\nII.\r\n  Takings/Due Process Claims\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in finding Act 189 did not amount to a taking of\r\n  property without just compensation or deprive Appellant of due process of law\r\n  because:Â  (1) Appellantâ€™s vested tax exemption benefit arises under a contract,\r\n  and, like thirty-year, tax-exempt bonds, the State could not change the tax\r\n  status in violation of the contract; (2) there was evidence that Appellant had\r\n  expectations that he would receive the tax exemption; and (3) retirement\r\n  benefits, including the tax exemption, are property rights.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  both a Takings Clause cause of action and substantive due process cause of\r\n  action focus on a partyâ€™s ability to protect their property from capricious\r\n  state action, parties claiming both of these violations must first show that\r\n  they had a legitimate property interest.Â  The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\r\n  provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just\r\n  compensation.Â  Rickâ€™s Amusement, Inc. v. State, 351 S.C. 352, 357, 570\r\n  S.E.2d 155, 157 (2001).Â  In determining whether a governmental action violates\r\n  the Takings Clause, the courts consider:Â  (1) the economic impact of the state\r\n  action; (2) its interference with distinct investment-backed expectations; and\r\n  (3) the character of the state action.Â  Id.Â  \r\nSubstantive\r\n  due process provides that one may not be deprived of property for arbitrary\r\n  reasons.Â  Worsley Co. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 339 S.C. 51, 56, 528\r\n  S.E.2d 657, 660 (2000) (â€œSubstantive due process protects a person from being\r\n  deprived of life, liberty or property for arbitrary reasons.â€).Â  To support a\r\n  substantive due process violation, a party must show â€œhe was arbitrarily and\r\n  capriciously deprived of a cognizable property interest rooted in state law.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nHaving\r\n  found that section 9-1-1680 did not create a contract entitling Appellant to\r\n  tax exemptions, we conclude that there are no property rights infringed upon by\r\n  Act 189.Â  Even though taxes amount to taking money from taxpayers or business,\r\n  those kinds of assessments are not treated as per se takings under the Fifth\r\n  Amendment.Â  Rivers, 327 S.C. at 275, 490 S.E.2d at 263.Â  Moreover, in\r\n  order for Act 189 to have effected a taking in the present case, Appellant\r\n  would have to have had a vested right to the tax exemption.Â  Appellant has\r\n  failed to show he had any reasonable investment-backed expectations in the tax\r\n  exemption, and there is no contracted obligation.Â  Because there is not a\r\n  vested interest in tax laws remaining unchanged, Appellant failed to prove a\r\n  Takings Claim. \r\nThere is no cognizable property interest that requires due\r\n  process.Â  Appellant relies on Rivers in support of his due process\r\n  claim.Â  His reliance is misplaced.Â  Rivers involved a due process claim\r\n  as a result of excessive retroactive application of tax legislation.Â  In the\r\n  instant case, there is no retroactive application of tax legislation. \r\nIII. Statute\r\n  of Limitations\r\nIn\r\n  addition to failing to prove he was entitled to the tax exemption, Appellantâ€™s\r\n  case was untimely.Â  Appellant argues the ALC and the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding his claims were barred by the statute of limitations because:Â  (1) the\r\n  Department did not pursue that defense in Evans; (2) he made his claim\r\n  for a refund within three years of retirement; and (3) it was a contract\r\n  providing for continuing performance, thus the limitations period began anew\r\n  each year.\r\nâ€œStatutes\r\n  of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\r\n  stimulate activity, punish negligence, and promote repose by giving security\r\n  and stability to human affairs.â€Â  Moates v. Bobb, 322 S.C. 172, 176, 470\r\n  S.E.2d 402, 404 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The statute of limitations for actions\r\n  pursuant to contract or statute is three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (1),\r\n  (2) (2005) (stating the statute of limitations for actions based upon contract\r\n  or upon liability created by statute is three years).Â  The limitations period\r\n  begins to run when a party knows or should know, through the exercise of due\r\n  diligence, that a cause of action might exist.Â  RWE NUKEM Corp. v. ENSR\r\n    Corp., 373 S.C. 190, 196, 644 S.E.2d 730, 733 (2007) (noting that under the\r\n  discovery rule, a cause of action for breach of contract accrues on the date\r\n  the injured party discovered or should have discovered the breach); Epstein\r\n    v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372, 376, 610 S.E.2d 816, 818 (2005) (â€œUnder the\r\n  discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date the injured party\r\n  either knows or should know, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a\r\n  cause of action exists for the wrongful conduct.â€).\r\nIn Harvey v. South Carolina Department of Corrections, 338 S.C. 500, 527 S.E.2d\r\n  765 (Ct. App. 2000), the Court of Appeals reviewed a statute of limitations\r\n  defense in a 1993 action filed by current or recently retired employees of the\r\n  Department of Corrections complaining that their retirement benefits were only\r\n  prospectively transferred from the South Carolina Retirement System to the\r\n  Police Officers Retirement System.Â  The court noted that the cause of action\r\n  for the transfer of prior years of service accrued in 1983, when the employees\r\n  were prospectively transferred to the PORS, because it was â€œundisputed that\r\n  Employees knew of their claim at that point.â€Â  Harvey, 338 S.C. at 508,\r\n  527 S.E.2d at 769-70.Â Â  \r\nWe find Appellant knew, or through the exercise of due diligence\r\n  should have known, that his retirement benefits would no longer be exempt from\r\n  state income tax when the statute was changed in 1989.Â  Although Appellant did\r\n  not begin receiving retirement income until 1997, he had a vested interest in\r\n  his retirement plan prior to Act 189.Â  Similar to Harvey, Appellantâ€™s\r\n  action accrued at the time of the 1989 change, not when he later retired and\r\n  attempted to claim the prior tax exemption.[5]Â \r\n  Thus, the limitations period expired in 1992, not in 1998 when Appellant filed\r\n  his action.Â  This action is barred by the statute of limitations. \r\nAppellant\r\n  further argues that the Department waived the statute of limitations defense\r\n  when it did not raise it as an additional sustaining ground in Evans.Â  A\r\n  party can waive a statute of limitations defense, but the waiver must be shown\r\n  by words or conduct, including an express agreement, failure to claim the\r\n  defense, or any action or inaction inconsistent with an intention to use the\r\n  statute of limitations defense.Â  RWE NUKEM, 373 S.C. at 197, 644 S.E.2d\r\n  at 734.Â  According to the Appellantâ€™s brief, the Department asserted the\r\n  statute of limitations in the early stages of the Evans case.Â  The\r\n  Department did not assert the statute of limitations as an alternative\r\n  sustaining ground in Evans, and it argued that the circuit court erred\r\n  by not ordering that administrative remedies should have been exhausted.Â  \r\nWhile the Department did not raise the statute of limitations\r\n  defense on appeal in Evans court, the result of the Evans decision was that the case was remanded to the circuit court for dismissal without\r\n  prejudice so that Appellant could exhaust his administrative remedies.Â  The\r\n  dismissal of the complaint in Evans allows the Department could then\r\n  assert any available defenses, including a statute of limitations defense, when\r\n  the action is re-filed. Â \r\nFinally,\r\n  Appellant argues the failure to impose the pre-Act 189 tax exemption to his\r\n  retirement benefits each year amounts to a continuing breach such that a new\r\n  limitations period begins each year.Â  The circuit court gave two reasons for\r\n  denying this argument:Â  (1) because Appellant was alleging an impairment of\r\n  contract action, not a breach of contract action, the statute of limitations\r\n  began to run when any alleged contract was impaired by Act 189, not when\r\n  Appellant was actually denied the exemption each year; and (2) the cause of\r\n  action accrued when Act 189 was passed because at that point Appellant was put\r\n  on notice that he had a cause of action.Â  We agree with the circuit court that\r\n  there is no continuing breach which would start a new limitations period\r\n  because the cause of action arose with the enactment of Act 189.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION[6]\r\nAppellant\r\n  failed to prove his impairment of contract claim because section 9-1-1680 did\r\n  not contain contractually-significant language, it was a tax law, and it was\r\n  subject to modification.Â  Appellantâ€™s takings and due process claims are\r\n  further without merit because Appellant cannot show that he had a legitimate\r\n  property interest in the tax law remaining unchanged.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  substantial evidence showed that any loss of alleged property was more than\r\n  made up for with the 7% retirement benefits increase.Â  Finally, Appellantâ€™s claims are barred by\r\n  the statute of limitations because he knew or should have known at the time Act\r\n  189 was passed that the Act would affect his retirement benefits.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, Acting\r\n  Chief Justice, WALLER, J., and Acting Justices James W. Johnson, Jr. and Edward\r\n  B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  This $3,000 exemption increases to $10,000 in the year the retiree reaches the\r\n  age of 65.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-6-1170 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2006).Â  \r\n[2]Â \r\n  At some point after remand, the case title was changed to â€œAnonymous\r\n    Taxpayer v. South Carolina Department of Revenue.â€Â  \r\n[3]Â \r\n  Appellant further argues that a tax statute may also create a contract.Â  There\r\n  is no indication in section 9-1-1680 that the Legislature intended it to create\r\n  a contract.Â  \r\n[4]Â \r\n  Assuming Appellant had an income of $10,000, pre-Act 189, he would not have any\r\n  state taxes on the income and would net $10,000.Â  After the enactment of Act\r\n  189, Appellant would receive a 7% raise in income to $10,700.Â  Applying the\r\n  same presumed 7% state tax from Appellantâ€™s example to the $7,700 in taxable\r\n  income after the $3,000 exemption, Appellant would be taxed $539.Â  Thus, his\r\n  post-Act 189 net, after state taxes, would be $10,161.Â  \r\n[5]Â \r\n  Appellant argues that he could not have applied for a tax refund before he\r\n  retired, and thus, his application for a refund in 1998 was within the\r\n  three-year statute of limitations for seeking a refund.Â  This argument is\r\n  unpersuasive.Â  The basis of Appellantâ€™s claim is an alleged statutorily-created\r\n  contract.Â  Assuming that a contract existed, it was breached when the state\r\n  changed the law eliminating the tax exemption.Â  Thus, accrual date is the time\r\n  of the change in the law, not nearly ten years later when Appellant sought a\r\n  refund pursuant to the old law. \r\n[6]Â \r\n  Appellant also complains about the ALCâ€™s denial of class certification.Â \r\n  However, Appellant only appeals one of the two reasons the circuit court listed\r\n  for affirming the ALC.Â  Therefore, the circuit courtâ€™s alternate sustaining\r\n  ground is the law of the case.Â  Anderson v. Short,\r\n  323 S.C. 522, 525, 476 S.E.2d 475, 477 (1996) (holding that where the ruling of\r\n  the trial judge is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will\r\n  affirm unless appellant appeals all the grounds).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26474","title":"Whitworth v.

No. 2005-UP-471\r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 26, 2005), the court of appeals reversed the order of\r\n  the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s denying benefits and held that\r\n  Respondentâ€™s accident fell within an exception to the going and coming rule.Â \r\n  We granted certiorari to review that decision and now reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nRespondent Tracy\r\n  Lee Whitworth was employed by Petitioner Window World, Inc. (â€œWindow Worldâ€) as\r\n  a window installer and assigned to a job\r\n  at a residence.Â  Respondent installed three windows on Saturday, seven windows\r\n  on Sunday, and planned to finish the job on Monday.Â  The last step to install a\r\n  window requires installing coil around the window, which involves using a â€œbreakerâ€\r\n  to cut the coil.Â  A breaker is a large piece of equipment that must be\r\n  transported to each jobsite.Â  Because Window Worldâ€™s breaker was unavailable,[1] Respondent used his brotherâ€™s breaker which was stored in Respondentâ€™s garage.Â \r\n  Respondent testified that at approximately 7:40 a.m., he loaded the breaker\r\n  onto his trailer which was attached to his truck and proceeded to the jobsite.Â \r\n  After stopping to get a drink on the way to the jobsite, Respondent was\r\n  involved in an automobile accident.Â  \r\nThe single\r\n  commissioner denied Respondent benefits, finding that the accident occurred on the\r\n  way to work and that Respondent failed to show the accident fell within an\r\n  exception to the â€œgoing and coming ruleâ€ which prohibits employees from\r\n  recovering from injuries that occur while going to or coming from work.Â  The\r\n  full commission and the circuit court affirmed.Â  The court of appeals reversed\r\n  and held that the injuries fell within the â€œduty or task exceptionâ€ to the rule\r\n  because Respondent was charged with the task of transporting the breaker to the\r\n  jobsite when he was injured.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted certiorari and Window World[2] presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  court of appeals err in holding that Respondentâ€™s injuries fell within an\r\n  exception to the going and coming rule?\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nThis Court must affirm the findings of fact made by the full commission\r\n  if they are supported by substantial evidence. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(5) (2006); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 136, 276\r\n  S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981). Â Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of\r\n  evidence but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached. Â Tiller\r\n    v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d\r\n  843, 845 (1999).Â  This Court may reverse a decision of the full commission that\r\n  is affected by an error of law.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nWindow\r\n  World first argues that substantial evidence in the record supports the full commissionâ€™s\r\n  finding that Respondent was not charged with a duty or task in connection with\r\n  his employment at the time of his accident, and therefore, the court of appeals\r\n  exceeded its scope of review in reversing this finding.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe relevant facts in this case were not disputed, and thus,\r\n  whether Respondentâ€™s injuries are compensable is a question of law.Â  See Grant v. Grant Textiles, 372\r\n  S.C. 196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 872 (2007)\r\n  (holding that where there are no disputed facts, the question of\r\n  whether an accident is compensable is a question of law).Â \r\n  For this reason, regardless of whether the court of appeals reached the correct\r\n  conclusion, the court did not exceed its scope of review.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(d) (2006) (an appellate court may reverse the full commissionâ€™s\r\n  decision if affected by an error of law).Â  \r\nNext, Window World argues\r\n  that the court of appeals erred in reversing the full commissionâ€™s denial of\r\n  benefits because Respondentâ€™s accident does not fall within an exception to the\r\n  going and coming rule.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder\r\n  the going and coming rule, an\r\n  employee going to or coming from the place where his work is to be performed is\r\n  not engaged in performing any service growing out of and incidental to his\r\n  employment. Â Therefore, an injury sustained by accident at such time is not\r\n  compensable under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act because it does not arise out\r\n  of and in the course of his employment.Â  Medlin v. Upstate Plaster Serv., 329\r\n  S.C. 92, 95, 495 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1998).Â \r\n  This Court has recognized five exceptions to this rule, one of which is the\r\n  â€œduty or task exception.â€Â  Under this exception, an employee will not be\r\n  precluded from receiving benefits where\r\n    the employee, on his way to or from his work, is charged with some duty or task\r\n    in connection with his employment.Â  Id.Â  \r\nUnder the facts of this case, Respondent failed to show he was\r\n  charged with a work-related duty or task as set forth in the exception to the\r\n  going and coming rule.Â  The primary purpose of Respondentâ€™s trip served a\r\n  personal objective, namely for Respondent to travel to the place where his work\r\n  was to be performed.Â  Respondent had no work-related duties to perform on the\r\n  way to work, was not under the control of Window World, and was free to conduct\r\n  personal business on the way to the jobsite even with the breaker in tow, as\r\n  evidenced by his personal deviation.Â  The mere transportation of the breaker - a\r\n  tool of the trade, not owned by Window World, and stored in Respondentâ€™s garage\r\n  - while going to work does not necessarily transform the event into a\r\n  work-related duty or task.Â  See Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§\r\n  16.09[4][a] (2007) (noting that â€œ[t]he mere fact that [a] claimant is, while\r\n  going to work, also carrying some of the paraphernalia of the employment does\r\n  not, in itself, convert the trip into a part of the employmentâ€).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we hold that under the facts of this case, the going and coming rule precludes\r\n  compensation.\r\nThe court of appeals relied heavily on Wright v.\r\n  Wright, 306 S.C. 331, 411 S.E.2d 829 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1991) in reaching their decision.Â  In our view, however, Wright is\r\n  distinguishable.Â  In Wright, the claimant, a self-employed contractor,\r\n  was injured in an automobile accident while traveling from a jobsite in Charlotte to his home in Easley and while taking an employee home.Â  The claimantâ€™s\r\n  accident clearly fell within two exceptions to the going and coming rule since\r\n  the claimant was driving a company truck and was charged with the specific\r\n  work-related task of taking the employee home.[3]Â  Id. at 333-34, 411\r\n  S.E.2d at 830.Â  In the instant case, Respondent was driving his own truck,\r\n  towing his own tools, and had no work-related tasks to perform on his way to\r\n  the jobsite.\r\nIn\r\n  the event that we were to find the exceptions to the going and coming rule\r\n  inapplicable, Respondent urges this Court to adopt the â€œrequired vehicle\r\n  rule.â€Â  Under this rule,\r\n  if the employer requires an employee, as part of the employeeâ€™s job, to bring\r\n  his own car for use during the workday, the trip to and from work falls within\r\n  the course of employment.[4]Â  See 99 C.J.S Workersâ€™ Compensation Â§ 442.Â  This rule effectively operates\r\n  as an additional exception to the going and coming rule.\r\nWe decline to adopt or apply the required vehicle rule based on\r\n  the record presented in this case.Â  Respondent failed to raise this issue to\r\n  either the single commissioner or to the full commission.Â  Furthermore, although\r\n  the record indicates Window World required their employees to have their own\r\n  trucks, the record is not clear on the strictness of this requirement or the\r\n  extent of traveling Window World demanded from their employees.Â  Thus, we decline\r\n  to consider the adoption of the required vehicle rule based on the record\r\n  before this Court.Â  \r\nÂ Conclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the court of\r\n  appeals and hold that Respondent was not charged with a work-related duty or task,\r\n  and therefore, his injuries are not compensable pursuant to the going and\r\n  coming rule.Â  \r\nMOORE,\r\n  WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justices E. C. Burnett, III and Aphrodite K. Konduros,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties dispute the reason the breaker was unavailable.Â  Respondent claims\r\n  that Window World would not let him use their breaker as punishment for\r\n  misconduct while Window World contends that another crew was using the breaker.\r\n[2] We refer to Petitioners collectively as â€œWindow World.â€\r\n[3] Although the self-employed claimant in Wright served in both employer\r\n  and employee capacities, this fact did not change the analysis or the result.\r\n[4] We disagree with Respondentâ€™s claim that the court of appeals implicitly\r\n  adopted this rule in Wright.Â  To the contrary, South Carolina has\r\n  not yet recognized the required vehicle rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26475","title":"Salmonsen v.

Â The Court granted Salmonsenâ€™s motion for the\r\n  appeal to be certified from the Court of Appeals to this Court. Â The appeal and\r\n  cross-appeals raise multiple substantive and procedural issues regarding the\r\n  certification of the class.Â  We dismiss in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFactual/Procedural History\r\nOn October 19, 2000, Salmonsen filed his original\r\n  Complaint against Parex, Inc. (the stucco manufacturer), Jeff Thomas d/b/a\r\n  Thomas Construction (the general contractor for the residence), Mike Tenny\r\n  d/b/a Synco Enterprise (the subcontractor responsible for applying EIFS), and Charleston\r\n  Gypsum n/k/a CSR America (the distributor). Â In his Complaint, Salmonsen\r\n  claimed his residential home sustained water intrusion damage resulting from\r\n  allegedly defective construction materials, particularly the Exterior Insulation\r\n  and Finish System (â€œEIFSâ€).Â  Based on these damages, Salmonsen asserted causes\r\n  of action for breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty,\r\n  negligence, and strict liability.Â  Prior to the scheduled trial date of October\r\n  14, 2002, Salmonsen settled and entered into a release with the defendants.Â  In\r\n  the settlement documents, Salmonsen specifically reserved his claims against\r\n  CGD, Inc., f/k/a Charleston Gypsum Dealers &amp; Supply Co., Inc.[1]\r\nOn October 23,\r\n  2002, Salmonsen filed an Amended Complaint on behalf of himself and other\r\n  similarly situated homeowners, which named CGD, Inc., f/k/a Charleston Gypsum\r\n  Dealers &amp; Supply Co., Inc. (â€œCGDâ€), and each of its former shareholders as\r\n  defendants. Â In the Amended Complaint, Salmonsen alleged products liability\r\n  claims against CGD for breach of implied warranty, negligence, and strict\r\n  liability.Â  As to the former shareholders, Salmonsen alleged they were\r\n  personally liable for misconduct associated with the distribution of the\r\n  corporationâ€™s assets.Â  \r\nOn February 18,\r\n  2003, Salmonsen moved for class certification.Â  In response, CGD filed a\r\n  memorandum in opposition and a motion to amend its Answer to include third-party\r\n  defendants who had contributed to the alleged damages of the class of\r\n  homeowners.Â  After a hearing, Circuit Court Judge Markley Dennis, Jr., issued\r\n  an order on September 25, 2003, in which he granted Salmonsenâ€™s motion to\r\n  certify the class and denied CGDâ€™s motion.Â  In his order, Judge Dennis found\r\n  that all of the prerequisites for class certification were satisfied pursuant\r\n  to Rule 23(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. Â In addition to\r\n  these criteria, Judge Dennis also based his decision to certify the class on\r\n  the ground that there was a limited fund to satisfy the class claims given the\r\n  corporation was dissolved and had only a limited amount of insurance coverage\r\n  available.Â  Judge Dennis certified the following class:Â  \r\n\r\n\tAll\r\n  persons and entities that own or have owned structures clad with Parex EIFS\r\n  sold by the Defendant between January 1, 1991 and May 15, 1995.Â  This class\r\n  excludes:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\ta) \r\n\t\t\tEmployees of the Defendant; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tb)\r\n\t\t\tThose persons who have released the Defendant or \r\n\t\t\tare currently in litigation with the Defendant.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSubsequently,\r\n  CGD and the shareholders jointly filed two motions requesting Judge Dennis to\r\n  reconsider his orders certifying the class and denying the addition of\r\n  third-party defendants.Â  By orders dated December 15, 2003, Judge Dennis\r\n  amended the prior order by ruling that the class would be conditionally\r\n  certified and permitting CGD additional time to conduct class discovery.Â  Judge\r\n  Dennis also granted CGD leave to amend its Answer to list Parex as a\r\n  third-party defendant.Â  Pursuant to this ruling, the defendants filed an\r\n  Amended Answer and a Third-Party Complaint in which they asserted causes of\r\n  action for indemnity, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of\r\n  implied warranties.\r\nOn\r\n  March 22, 2004, Judge Dennis signed a consent scheduling order in which he\r\n  granted the defendants until May 1, 2004, to file motions to decertify the\r\n  class.Â  Additionally, he ordered the parties to:Â  (1) complete discovery on or\r\n  before July 20, 2004; (2) file all motions by August 20, 2004; and (3) complete\r\n  mediation on or before August 20, 2004.Â  Judge Dennis also informed the parties\r\n  that the case was subject to being called for trial on or after September 20,\r\n  2004. \r\nAfter\r\n  conducting discovery, CGD filed a motion on April 30, 2004, to decertify the\r\n  conditionally-certified class.Â  In its motion and accompanying memorandum, CGD\r\n  contended that the requirements of Rule 23, SCRCP, were not met and\r\n  certification was inappropriate because trying the case would involve numerous\r\n  separate â€œmini-trials.â€ Â CGD reasoned that the homeowners were distinct in\r\n  their claims and, particularly, their damages.\r\nOn October 12,\r\n  2004, Judge Dennis held a hearing on the motion to decertify the class. Â Judge\r\n  Dennis issued a form order in which he denied the motion and indicated that a\r\n  formal order would be forthcoming.Â  Prior to the issuance of the formal order, CGD and Parex filed motions to bifurcate the claims of individual class members\r\n  and, in the alternative, requested a litigation plan for the class action.Â  On\r\n  January 14, 2005, Circuit Court Judge Roger Young, the Chief Administrative\r\n  Judge, held a pre-trial conference on these motions.Â Â  Judge Young removed the\r\n  case from the trial roster, requested the parties submit proposed trial plans,\r\n  and assigned the case to himself for all further proceedings.\r\nOn\r\n  February 24, 2005, Judge Dennis issued a formal order explaining his denial of\r\n  the defendantsâ€™ motion for decertification.Â  In his order, Judge Dennis\r\n  reiterated that all of the criteria of Rule 23(a), SCRCP, were met to warrant\r\n  certification of the class.Â  He also emphasized that â€œthe differences in the\r\n  claims and damages of these homeowners are not so great that they would weigh\r\n  against class certification.â€ Â Additionally, Judge Dennis recognized that â€œthe\r\n  court faces a continuing duty to ensure that the requirements of Rule 23 remain\r\n  satisfied.Â  The decision to certify a class is not set in stone; the trial\r\n  court retains the power to decertify or modify the class at any time prior to\r\n  final judgment.â€\r\nOn\r\n  February 25, 2005, Judge Young held a second pre-trial hearing to consider the\r\n  partiesâ€™ proposed trial plans and to address the issue of class notification.Â \r\n  By order dated May 31, 2005, Judge Young established an â€œopt-inâ€ notification\r\n  procedure. Â In reaching this conclusion, Judge Young found the â€œopt-inâ€\r\n  procedure was â€œthe preferred method of litigating the instant case by serving\r\n  the interests of the parties and furthering judicial economy.â€Â  Judge Young\r\n  further explained that â€œan opt-in provision is the most pragmatic procedure to\r\n  facilitate the management of this case.Â  The makeup of this Class should only\r\n  contain, at most, a narrow group of members, namely the homeowners as\r\n  identified by sales invoices provided by Defendants.â€Â  Judge Young declined to\r\n  establish a trial management plan until after the class had been closed and the\r\n  class members had been identified.Â Â Â  Significantly, Judge Young specifically reserved\r\n  the â€œauthority to alter, amend, or modify its orders as changes during the\r\n  course of this case may warrant.â€\r\nAll\r\n  parties timely appealed the orders of Judge Dennis and Judge Young.Â  Salmonsen\r\n  appealed Judge Youngâ€™s May 31, 2005 order establishing the â€œopt-inâ€\r\n  notification procedure.Â  CGD cross-appealed, challenging Judge Dennisâ€™s\r\n  February 17, 2005 order and Judge Youngâ€™s May 31, 2005 order denying decertification\r\n  of the class.Â  Parex also cross-appealed challenging Judge Dennisâ€™s three\r\n  orders converting the case into a class action and Judge Youngâ€™s order\r\n  permitting the case to continue as a class action.Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  there are multiple issues raised by the parties, we believe this case\r\n  essentially presents the following questions:Â  (1) whether these appeals are\r\n  interlocutory?; (2) whether Judge Dennis erred in conditionally certifying the\r\n  class?; and (3) whether Judge Young erred in converting the class to an\r\n  â€œopt-inâ€ class?Â  Accordingly, in the interest of clarity and brevity, we have\r\n  consolidated some of the issues raised by the parties.Â  Because the question of\r\n  appealability is a threshold issue in the case, we have chosen to address it\r\n  first.\r\nI. Appealability\r\nThe\r\n  substantive differences between the orders at issue necessitates that this\r\n  Court engage in a bifurcated appealability analysis.Â  Specifically, we must\r\n  determine whether the class certification orders are immediately appealable and\r\n  whether the subsequent orders regarding the â€œopt-inâ€ notification procedure are\r\n  immediately appealable.Â  For reasons that will be more fully discussed, we dismiss\r\n  the appeal of the class certification orders and grant the continued review of\r\nthe â€œopt-inâ€ orders. \r\n\r\nA.\r\nThe\r\n  general rule established by this Court is that class certification orders are\r\n  not immediately appealable. See Eldridge v. City of Greenwood,\r\n  308 S.C. 125, 127, 417 S.E.2d 532, 534 (1992) (â€œOrders under Rule 23, SCRCP are\r\n  interlocutory and thus, immediately appealable only in certain\r\n  circumstances.â€); see also Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury,\r\n    Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 565, 564 S.E.2d 94, 98 (2002) (â€œUsually, an order\r\n  denying class certification is interlocutory and not immediately appealable.â€); Schein v. Lamar, 274 S.C. 329, 331, 263 S.E.2d 383, 384 (1980) (finding\r\n  issue of class certification sought to be raised on appeal was interlocutory\r\n  and appeal regarding that issue was dismissed); Knowles v. Standard Sav.\r\n    &amp; Loan Assâ€™n, 274 S.C. 58, 59, 261 S.E.2d 49, 49 (1979) (dismissing\r\n  class certification order as interlocutory on the grounds that â€œ[c]lass\r\n  certification, essentially procedural in nature, does not involve substantial\r\n  or essential legal rights which require attention prior to final judgmentâ€).Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court, however, has reviewed interlocutory orders involving class certification\r\n  when they contain other appealable issues.Â  Ferguson, 349 S.C. at 565,\r\n  564 S.E.2d at 98; see Eldridge, 308 S.C. at 126-28, 417 S.E.2d at\r\n  533-34 (finding order prohibiting a plaintiff from contacting potential members\r\n  of the plaintiff class was in the nature of an injunction and, thus, directly\r\n  appealable).\r\nIn its brief, CGD concedes that â€œ[u]nder the present\r\n  law in South Carolina, all appeals in this matter should be dismissed as\r\n  interlocutory.â€Â  Despite this concession, CGD requests to argue against\r\n  precedent and asks this Court accept review of the appeals because the modern\r\n  trend in state and federal jurisdictions is to allow review of class\r\n  certification orders under certain circumstances.Â  CGD believes these appeals\r\n  present the appropriate circumstances for this Court to accept review. Â Â In\r\n  essence, CGD is urging this Court to amend our state rules of civil procedure\r\n  to permit interlocutory review of class certification orders or issue an\r\n  opinion holding these orders fall under the provisions of section 14-3-330(2)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code,[2] which allows appeal from an interlocutory order when the order affects a\r\n  â€œsubstantial rightâ€ and â€œin effect determines the action and prevents judgment\r\n  from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action.â€ \r\nIn analyzing this appealability issue, we have, as urged by CGD, reviewed precedent from other state\r\n  and federal jurisdictions.Â  Although the decisions from these jurisdictions are\r\n  instructive, we conclude they are distinguishable and do not warrant a decision\r\n  to review the certification orders in the instant case.\r\nUnlike\r\n  our state appellate courts, the federal courts have been specifically\r\n  authorized by Rule 23(f), which became effective on December 1, 1998,[3] to review class certifications prior to a final judgment.Â  Rule 23(f) provides:\r\n\r\n\t(f)\r\n  Appeals. A court of appeals may in\r\n  its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or\r\n  denying class action certification under this rule if application is made to it\r\n  within ten days after entry of the order. An appeal does not stay proceedings\r\n  in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so\r\n  orders.\r\n\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(f).[4]Â  The Advisory Committee Note to this rule explains:Â  â€œThe court\r\n  of appeals is given unfettered discretion whether to permit the appeal, akin to\r\n  the discretion exercised by the Supreme Court in acting on a petition for\r\n  certiorari . . . Permission to appeal may be granted or denied on the basis of\r\n  any consideration that the court of appeals finds persuasive.â€ However, our\r\n  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals seems to emphasize that review of interlocutory\r\n  class certification decisions would not be routine.Â  Instead, the Court has noted\r\n  that it would employ a â€œcareful and sparing use of Rule 23(f)â€ to â€œpromote\r\n  judicial economy by enabling the correction of certain manifestly flawed class\r\n  certifications prior to trial and final judgment.â€Â  Lienhart v. Dryvit Sys.\r\n    Inc., 255 F.3d 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2001).Â  Therefore, despite the specific\r\n  authorization, it appears that federal courts, particularly our Fourth Circuit,\r\n  are reticent to grant review of interlocutory class certifications orders.\r\nSimilar to the\r\n  federal courts, the state jurisdictions which have granted immediate appeal of\r\n  class certification orders are usually authorized by a state rule of civil\r\n  procedure or a specific statute.Â  See, e.g., Ala. Code Â§ 6-5-642 (2005)\r\n  (Alabama); Ark. R. App. P. Civ. 2(a)(9) (Arkansas); Colo. Rev. Stat. Â§\r\n  13-20-901 (2006)(Colorado); Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. Â§ 42-110h (2007)\r\n  (Connecticut); Fla. R. App. P. 9.130(a)(3)(vi) (Florida); Ga. Code Ann. Â§ 9-11-23(g)\r\n  (2005)(Georgia); I. C. A. Rule 1.264(3) (Iowa); Kan. Stat. Ann. Â§ 60-223(f)\r\n  (2005) (Kansas); Mo. Rev. Stat. Â§ 512.020(3) (Supp. 2008) (Missouri); N.M.R.A. Rule\r\n  1-023(F) (New Mexico); N.D.R.Civ.P Rule 23(d)(3) (North Dakota); Ohio Rev. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 2505.02(B)(5) (2005)(Ohio); Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, Â§ 993(A)(6) (2005)\r\n  (Oklahoma); Or. Rev. Stat. Â§ 19.225 (2003) (Oregon); Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.\r\n  Code Â§ 51.014(a)(3) (Supp. 2007) (Texas); see generally Gary D. Spivey,\r\n  Annotation, Appealability of Order Denying Right to Proceed in Form of Class\r\n    Action, 54 A.L.R.3d 595 (1973 &amp; Supp. 2008) (discussing state appellate\r\n  decisions regarding the appealability of orders denying the right to proceed in\r\n  the form of a class action). \r\nIn the absence of\r\n  a rule or statute, several state appellate courts have granted immediate\r\n  review.Â  See, e.g., Indiana Bus. Coll. v. Hollowell, 818 N.E.2d\r\n  943, 945 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004) (granting review of interlocutory appeal of class\r\n  certification decision); Dunn v. State, 635 S.E.2d 604, 606 (N.C. Ct.\r\n  App. 2006)(holding interlocutory appeal of class certification order was\r\n  directly appealable because it involved â€œâ€˜a matter of law or legal inference\r\n  that affect[ed] a substantial right of the appellantâ€™â€(quoting Frost v.\r\n    Mazda Motor of Am., Inc., 540 S.E.2d 324, 327 (N.C. 2000))); Mitchem v.\r\n      Melton, 277 S.E.2d 895, 900-01 (W.Va. 1981) (holding order denying class\r\n  action standing was immediately appealable); but see Gordon v.\r\n    Microsoft Corp., 645 N.W.2d 393, 402-03 (Minn. 2002) (adopting â€œsynthesisâ€\r\n  of federal jurisprudence regarding immediate appeal of class certification\r\n  orders and affirming court of appeals decision denying immediate review of\r\n  class certification order); Basile v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., 926 A.2d\r\n  493, 498 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2007) (holding interlocutory orders granting class\r\n  certification become reviewable on appeal upon the trial courtâ€™s entry of a\r\n  final order).\r\nAlthough\r\n  the absence of a specific state rule or statute is not dispositive of our\r\n  decision as to the appealability of class certification orders, it presents a\r\n  greater obstacle for this Court to grant review of the appealed orders.[5] Because a decision by this Court to grant immediate appellate\r\n  review of a class certification order would represent a significant departure\r\n  from this stateâ€™s established appealability jurisprudence, we decline to do\r\n  so.Â  We reiterate that the orders do not prevent a judgment from which an\r\n  appeal may be taken nor do they discontinue the action.Â  \r\nB.\r\nWe\r\n  reach a different conclusion regarding the appeal of the orders establishing\r\n  the â€œopt-inâ€ notification procedure.Â  Although Salmonsen concedes that an order granting or denying class\r\n  certification is typically treated as an interlocutory appeal by the appellate\r\n  courts of this state, he contends that his appeal from Judge Youngâ€™s order\r\n  establishing the â€œopt-inâ€ notification procedure is properly before this Court\r\n  because it affects a substantial right of class members and the mode of trial.Â \r\n  Specifically, Salmonsen asserts the ruling of Judge Young â€œis a death knell for\r\n  a number of class membersâ€™ claims because they will no longer be class members\r\n  due to the inhibitions created by changing the matters to an opt-in class.â€[6] Â We agree with Salmonsen that these\r\n  orders affect a mode of trial and, thus, are immediately appealable. Â Moreover,\r\n  this issue presents a novel question of law which should be addressed at this\r\n  time in the interest of judicial economy and guidance to the bench and bar.\r\nâ€œPursuant\r\n  to Â§ 14-3-330(2), this Court has held on numerous occasions that when a trial\r\n  courtâ€™s order deprives a party of a mode of trial to which it is entitled to as\r\n  a matter of right, such order is immediately appealable.â€Â  Flagstar Corp. v.\r\n    Royal Surplus Lines, 341 S.C. 68, 72, 533 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2000).Â  â€œThese\r\n  cases not only permit, but indeed require, immediate appeal in the event of the\r\n  denial of a mode of trial to which one is entitled as a matter of right.â€Â  Id.Â  This Courtâ€™s traditional analysis of claims of denial of a mode of trial\r\n  requires a determination of whether or not a party is erroneously denied a\r\n  trial by jury in a law case, or is erroneously required to proceed before a\r\n  jury in an equity case.Â  Id. Â However, the mode of trial analysis\r\n  indubitably includes the consideration of the availability of trial.Â  The\r\n  question of the denial of an actual trial is intrinsic.Â  Here, all parties\r\n  argue that some of the claims of putative class members are barred or would be\r\n  barred by the statute of limitations if the â€œopt-inâ€ procedure is used. \r\nAs\r\n  originally certified by Judge Dennis, the class included â€œAll persons and\r\n  entities that own or have owned structures clad with Parex EIFS sold by the\r\n  Defendant between January 1, 1991 and May 15, 1995.â€Â  By converting this inclusive class to an â€œopt-inâ€ class, Judge\r\n  Youngâ€™s order had the deleterious effect of improperly excluding individuals\r\n  who should be members of the class. Â Although the class has not been\r\n  decertified by the trial judge, the adoption of this notification procedure\r\n  essentially created a class action anomaly. Â See Citgo Ref. &amp; Mktg.,\r\n    Inc. v. Garza, 94 S.W.3d 322, 328 (Tex. App. 2002) (stating â€œan order changing the\r\n      characterization of a class from opt-out to mandatory fundamentally alters the\r\n      nature of the class and therefore is immediately appealableâ€). \r\nII.\r\n  Â Propriety of â€œOpt-inâ€ Notification\r\nHaving\r\n  dismissed the appeal from Judge Dennisâ€™s class certification orders, we confine\r\n  our analysis to a review of Judge Youngâ€™s decision establishing an â€œopt-inâ€\r\n  notice procedure for putative class members.\r\nSalmonsen\r\n  challenges Judge Youngâ€™s ruling on procedural as well as substantive grounds.Â \r\n  First, Salmonsen contends that Judge Youngâ€™s decision effectively overruled\r\n  Judge Dennisâ€™s prior rulings regarding scheduling of the trial and the class\r\n  certification.Â  Secondly, Salmonsen asserts that an â€œopt-inâ€ notice requirement\r\n  is not recognized in this state and, in the alternative, is not appropriate for\r\n  this class action suit.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Salmonsen is correct that one circuit court judge may not overrule another, we\r\n  find this rule was not violated in the instant case.Â  See Enoree\r\n    Baptist Church v. Fletcher, 287 S.C. 602, 604, 340 S.E.2d 546, 547 (1986)\r\n  (â€œOne Circuit Court Judge does not have the authority to set aside the order of\r\n  another.â€).\r\nRules\r\n  23(d)(1) and (2) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure specifically\r\n  permit the trial court to maintain continual control over class action\r\n  proceedings, including the method of class notification.Â  Because Judge Young\r\n  was the Chief Administrative Judge, who was ultimately assigned to the case, he\r\n  was authorized to issue orders governing the trial proceedings which included\r\n  scheduling decisions as well as the method of notification.Â  See Rule\r\n  40(e)(2), SCRCP (permitting scheduling orders to be amended by subsequent Chief\r\n  Administrative Judge).Â  Significantly, Judge Dennis never ruled on the method\r\n  of class notification nor did he designate the action as an â€œopt-outâ€ class\r\n  action. Â Moreover, class certification may be altered at any time prior to a\r\n  decision on the merits.[7]Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find Judge Young properly exercised his discretion and did not overrule any\r\n  prior decisions of Judge Dennis.\r\nAs\r\n  to the merits of Salmonsenâ€™s issue, we believe, for reasons that will be more\r\n  fully discussed, that the â€œopt-outâ€ notification procedure is appropriate and\r\n  should be used in this case and future class action suits.\r\nTo\r\n  analyze this issue, it is instructive to compare Rule 23(d)(2) of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure with its federal counterpart, Rule 23(c)(2).Â \r\n  In doing so, we are cognizant that our appellate decisions have relied on\r\n  federal precedent with respect to class action cases, but have also noted the\r\n  significant differences between the two rules.Â  See Littlefield v. South\r\n    Carolina Forestry Commâ€™n, 337 S.C. 348, 354, 523 S.E.2d 781, 784 (1999)\r\n  (â€œOur state class action rule differs significantly from its federal\r\n  counterpart.Â  The drafters of Rule 23, South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure\r\n  (SCRCP) intentionally omitted from our state rule the additional requirements\r\n  found in Federal Rule 23(B), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP).Â  By\r\n  omitting the additional requirements, Rule 23, SCRCP, endorses a more expansive\r\n  view of class action availability than its federal counterpart.â€); McGann v.\r\n    Mungo, 287 S.C. 561, 570, 340 S.E.2d 154, 159 (Ct. App. 1986) (relying on\r\n  federal precedent to interpret new Rule 23 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure).\r\nRule\r\n  23(d)(2) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure states:\r\n\r\n\tIn the conduct of actions to which this rule applies,\r\n  the court may make appropriate orders:Â  . . . (2) The court may at any time\r\n  impose such terms as shall fairly and adequately protect the interest of the\r\n  persons on whose behalf the action is brought or defended.Â  It may order that notice be given in such a manner as it may direct of the pendency of the\r\n  action by the party seeking to maintain the action on behalf of the class. It\r\n\tmay\r\n    order that notice be given in such manner as it may direct of a proposed\r\n  settlement, of entry of judgment, or any other proceedings in the action\r\n  including notice to the absent persons that they may come in and present claims\r\n  and defenses if they so desire. \r\n\r\nRule\r\n  23(d)(2), SCRCP (emphasis added).\r\nIn comparison, Rule 23(c)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure provides:\r\n\r\n\tFor any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court must direct to class members the best notice practicable under the circumstances,\r\n  including individual notice to all members who can be identified through\r\n  reasonable effort. The notice must concisely and clearly state in plain,\r\n  easily understood language: Â the nature of the action, the definition of the\r\n  class certified, the class claims, issues, or defenses, that a class member may\r\n  enter an appearance through counsel if the member so desires, that the court \r\n\twill\r\n    exclude from the class any member who requests exclusion, stating when and\r\n  how members may elect to be excluded, and the binding effect of a class\r\n  judgment on class members under Rule 23(c)(3).\r\n\r\nFed. R. Civ. Pro. 23(c)(2)(B)\r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nAs\r\n  evidenced from the emphasized text, our state rule provides a trial court with\r\n  broader discretion to make decisions regarding class notification procedures\r\n  than the federal rule.Â  Notably, in defining a trial courtâ€™s authority our\r\n  state rule uses the term â€œmayâ€ whereas the federal rule uses the mandatory term\r\n  â€œmust.â€Â  Even more significant, the federal rule specifically mandates that\r\n  class members will only be excluded from the class if the member so requests, i.e.,\r\n  an â€œopt-outâ€ procedure.Â  Our research has revealed only two types of federal\r\n  class action cases where the federal courts permit an â€œopt-inâ€ procedure.Â  See Wagner v. Loewâ€™s Theatres, Inc., 76 F.R.D. 23, 24 (M.D. N.C. 1977)\r\n  (recognizing that class action suits pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act\r\n  and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act provide for statutory â€œopt-inâ€\r\n  class action); Watkins v. Milliken &amp; Co., 613 F. Supp. 408, 418\r\n  (W.D. N.C. 1984) (noting that Rule 23(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure provides for â€œopt-outâ€ class action whereas the Fair Labor Standards\r\n  Act allows as class members only those who â€œopt inâ€).\r\nIn\r\n  contrast, our state rule has no similar provision. Nor has this court\r\n  specifically spoken on the issue. Therefore, Judge Young had no guidance in\r\n  determining the appropriate notification method. \r\n\r\n\tÂ As\r\n  explained by Professor Flanagan:Â  \r\n\tRule 23(d) is not exhaustive.Â  The court has inherent power to\r\n  manage the class action and may enter any appropriate order.Â  One important\r\n  issue not covered by the rule is the procedure for determining who is bound by\r\n  a class action.Â  Federal Rule 23 allows only those who are members of a Rule 23(b)(3)\r\n  class action in which common questions predominate, the option of electing not\r\n  to be bound by the class action.Â  Class members must be notified of this right\r\n  and must affirmatively elect not to be bound.Â  Members of a Rule 23(b)(1) or\r\n  (b)(2) class actions are not given the option of staying out of the class\r\n  action.\r\n\tThe South Carolina Rule leaves to the courtâ€™s discretion the\r\n  method of determining how class members elect to be bound.Â  In some actions,\r\n  particularly those involving only injunctive relief, no procedure may be\r\n  necessary.Â  In other cases, where common questions predominate, the court may\r\n  use the federal approach of binding the members unless they opt-out, or\r\n  alternately requiring an affirmative election to be bound.\r\n\r\nFlanagan, James F., South Carolina Civil Procedure 192-93 (2d ed. 1996).\r\nDespite the\r\n  implicit permission in the rule for an â€œopt-inâ€ notification procedure, our\r\n  appellate courts have not recognized this method and have clearly expressed a\r\n  preference for the â€œopt-outâ€ procedure.Â  For example, this Court has stated:\r\n\r\n\tThus,\r\n  in order to provide minimal due process, absent class plaintiffs:\r\n\tmust\r\n  receive notice plus an opportunity to be heard and participate in the\r\n  litigation, whether in person or through counsel. The notice must be the best\r\n  practicable, â€œreasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise\r\n  interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity\r\n  to present their objections.â€ . . . The notice should describe the action and\r\n  the plaintiffsâ€™ rights in it. Additionally, . . . due process requires at a\r\n  minimum that an absent plaintiff be provided with an opportunity to remove\r\n  himself from the class by executing and returning an â€œopt outâ€ or â€œrequest for\r\n  exclusionâ€ form to the court. Finally, the Due Process Clause of course\r\n  requires that the named plaintiff at all times adequately represent the\r\n  interests of the absent class members.\r\n\tId. at\r\n  812, 105 S.Ct. 2965 (citations\r\n  omitted). Â If the due process requirements of (1) notice; (2) an opportunity to\r\n  be heard; (3) an opportunity to â€œopt out;â€ and (4) adequate representation are\r\n  met, the foreign court properly asserts personal jurisdiction over the absent\r\n  class plaintiffs. Accordingly, those plaintiffs who elect not to opt out are\r\n  bound by the foreign courtâ€™s judgment.\r\n\r\nHospitality Mgmt. Assocs. v.\r\n  Shell Oil Co.,\r\n  356 S.C. 644, 654, 591 S.E.2d 611, 616 (2004) (quoting Phillips Petroleum\r\n    Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 812 (1985)) (discussing extent of collateral\r\n  review of due process safeguards for absent class members to a class action\r\n  settlement in foreign jurisdiction).[8]\r\nMoreover,\r\n  this Court has stated, â€œSouth Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 23(d)(2) gives\r\n  the circuit court the broad power to â€˜impose such terms as shall fairly and\r\n  adequately protect the interest of the persons on whose behalf the action is\r\n  brought or defended.â€™â€Â  Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 308 S.C. 125,\r\n  127, 417 S.E.2d 532, 534 (1992) (quoting Rule 23(d)(2), SCRCP).Â  â€œThe power to\r\n  issue an order which the court, in its discretion, believes is necessary to\r\n  curtail the opportunities for abuse of the judicial system in class actions is\r\n  not without bounds.Â  Eldridge, 308 S.C. at 127, 417 S.E.2d at 534.Â  â€œThe\r\n  specific grants of power in Rule 23(d), SCRCP are directed towards notifying\r\n  the absent parties of the pending litigation.â€Â  Id.Â  The discretion\r\n  granted by Rule 23(d)(2) to determine how absent parties are notified of\r\n  a pending action does not include the discretion to determine if a member of\r\n  the class will be a party to the action.Â  It is inherent in class-action\r\n  litigation that every member of the class is a party.Â  The remaining question\r\n  is whether or not each party will present a claim or a defense. \r\nIn\r\n  our view, the â€œopt-inâ€ procedure is not contemplated by the notice provision of\r\n  Rule 23. The â€œopt-inâ€ procedure is more far reaching than simply notifying\r\n  putative class members of the pending action. It also determines the class and\r\n  may even re-define it.Â  Moreover, we believe the elimination of the putative\r\n  class members effectively denies those individuals a trial by jury.\r\nFurthermore, we\r\n  believe the implementation of the â€œopt-inâ€ procedure effectively converts the\r\n  previously certified class action into an ersatz form of permissive joinder\r\n  under Rule 20 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.[9] To do so eviscerates Rule 23 class actions. Â Rule 23 specifically\r\n  requires that the court find, before certifying the class, that the classÂ  is\r\n  so numerous that joinder is impracticable. Thus, Rule 20 joinder and Rule 23\r\n  class actions should not co-exist.\r\nThe careful reading\r\n  of Rules 20 and 23 together leads to the conclusion that â€œopt-inâ€ class actions\r\n  should not be allowed. This prohibition cannot be avoided by use of an â€œopt-inâ€\r\n  notice procedure. Â The â€œopt-inâ€ class action and the â€œopt-inâ€ notice procedure\r\n  are a distinction in name only, the practical effect is the same.\r\nAfter\r\n  much consideration, we come to the conclusion that an â€œopt-outâ€ notification\r\n  procedure is the proper method to be offered to putative class members in the\r\n  instant case and future class action cases.Â  We further take this opportunity\r\n  to specifically reject the use of an â€œopt-inâ€ procedure.Â  Taken to its logical\r\n  extreme, the â€œopt-inâ€ procedure undermines the due process reasoning of Rule 23\r\n  and essentially amounts to de facto decertification of a class. Â \r\nSpecifically,\r\n  as the text of Rule 23(d)(2) states, a court in managing a class action suit\r\n  should issue orders that â€œfairly and adequately protect the interest of the\r\n  persons on whose behalf the action is brought or defended.â€Â  By implementing an\r\n  â€œopt-inâ€ procedure, we believe a court is making misperceived judicial economy\r\n  paramount to the interests of putative class members.Â  For example, if, as in\r\n  the instant case, limited insurance funds are available to cover claims,\r\n  potential class members who do not participate in the class would not be\r\n  compensated because the limited funds may be exhausted in the action.Â  Â Furthermore,\r\n  potential members of the class may be precluded from bringing their claims due\r\n  to statute of limitation problems.Â  Because class action litigation is intended\r\n  to effectively litigate a large number of claims through a representative\r\n  party, a requirement that parties â€œopt-inâ€ will undoubtedly limit the size of the\r\n  class and, therefore, undermines the purpose of a class action suit.[10] \r\nAlthough\r\n  we recognize that class action suits are complex and laborious for all involved\r\n  parties, this fact alone is not sufficient to utilize a notification procedure\r\n  that effectively eviscerates class action status.Â  Accordingly, we hold Judge\r\n  Young erred in ordering an â€œopt-inâ€ notification procedure.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we dismiss the appeals of Judge Dennisâ€™s class certification\r\n  orders as interlocutory.Â  Because we adopt the â€œopt-outâ€ class action and\r\n  notification procedure as the exclusive method of class action litigation in\r\n  this state, we reverse Judge Youngâ€™s order and remand for further proceedings\r\n  consistent with this opinion.\r\nDISMISSED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent. The majority holds that the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s interlocutory order utilizing the â€œopt-inâ€ class certification\r\n  procedure is immediately appealable under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2) (1976)\r\n  because it is an order affecting the mode of trial.Â  I disagree: the â€œmode of\r\n  trialâ€ exception to the general rule that only final orders are appealable is\r\n  confined to orders which abridge a partyâ€™s constitutional right to trial by\r\n  jury.Â  E.g., Flagstar Corp. v. Royal Surplus Lines, 341 S.C. 68,\r\n  533 S.E.2d 331 (2000); Pelfry v. Bank of Greer, 270 S.C. 691, 244 S.E.2d\r\n  315 (1978).Â  I would therefore dismiss both appeals.Â  Knowles v. Standard\r\n    Savings and Loan Assâ€™n., 274 S.C. 58, 261 S.E.2d 49 (1979) (dismissing an\r\n  interlocutory appeal from a class certification order holding such an order\r\n  â€œdoes not involve substantial or essential legal rights which require attention\r\n  prior to final judgmentâ€).\r\nAlthough the issue\r\n  is not properly before us, I note my disagreement with the majorityâ€™s decision\r\n  on the merits as well as with its procedural ruling.Â  Without question, the\r\n  circuit court has discretion to create an â€œopt-inâ€ class under Rule 23(d), SCRCP, and while we have never directly addressed the propriety of the â€œopt-inâ€\r\n  class, we have never disapproved of the procedure.Â  See Tilley v.\r\n    Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 585 S.E.2d 292 (2003) (approving timing of\r\n  notice to persons eligible to join the class).Â  Moreover, I am at a loss to\r\n  understand the majorityâ€™s holding that an â€œopt-inâ€ class somehow runs afoul of\r\n  Rule 20(a), SCRCP, the permissive joinder provision.Â  The first prerequisite\r\n  for class certification is a finding that the class is so numerous that joinder\r\n  is not practicable.Â  Assuming that criterion is satisfied, whether the class\r\n  proceeds as â€œopt-inâ€ or â€œopt-out,â€ each potential class member has the right to\r\n  determine whether to participate in the law suit, and thus the same â€œersatzâ€\r\n  joinder problem exists under either scenario.\r\nNone of the\r\n  interlocutory orders sought to be appealed are immediately appealable under Â§\r\n  14-3-330.Â  I would dismiss the cross-appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Charleston Gypsum Dealers and Supply Co., Inc., sold\r\n  the Parex synthetic stucco that was applied to the exterior of Salmonsenâ€™s\r\n  residence in 1994.Â  On May 15, 1995, Charleston Gypsum sold its business and name\r\n  to CSR America.Â  Subsequently, Charleston Gypsum changed its name to CGD, Inc.Â \r\n  After all known creditors were paid, the sales proceeds were distributed to\r\n  CGD, Inc.â€™s shareholders over the next few years.Â  In 1999, the corporation was\r\n  administratively dissolved.Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  Section 14-3-330(2) states:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law\r\n  in law cases, and shall review upon appeal:\r\n\t(2) An order affecting a substantial right made in an action when\r\n  such order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from\r\n  which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action,\r\n  (b) grants or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer or any part\r\n  thereof or any pleading in any action.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  14-3-330(2) (1977 &amp; Supp. 2007).\r\n[3]Â  This rule was enacted pursuant to the express\r\n  authority of 28 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1292 (2007), a statute providing for federal courts\r\n  of appeal to review interlocutory decisions.\r\n[4]Â Â  We note there were changes made to the Federal\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure effective December 1, 2007.Â  Because these changes are\r\n  only intended to be stylistic, these amendments do not affect the issues in\r\n  this appeal.Â  Accordingly, we cite to the version of Rule 23 which was in\r\n  effect at the time of the initiation of this litigation.\r\n[5] Â â€œAlthough\r\n  we will not generally accept matters on a writ of certiorari that can be\r\n  entertained in the trial court or on appeal, a writ of certiorari may be issued\r\n  when exceptional circumstances exist.â€ In re Breast Implant Prod. Liab.\r\n    Litig., 331 S.C. 540, 543 n.2, 503 S.E.2d 445, 447 n.2 (1998).\r\n[6] Â At oral argument CGD agreed that the â€œopt-inâ€\r\n  procedure affected the mode of trial.\r\n[7] Â It should be noted that Judge Youngâ€™s order did not\r\n  decertify the class; however, it did designate it as an â€œopt-inâ€ class action.\r\n[8]Â  Interestingly, the dissent concurred without opinion\r\n  in Hospitality Management Associates.Â  As evident from the above-quoted\r\n  language, the unanimous Court unequivocally approved of the â€œopt-outâ€ procedure\r\n  as the preferred procedure and clearly indicated that this procedure comports\r\n  with the requirements of due process.Â  Thus, we are perplexed by the dissent\r\n  given it represents a fundamental reversal on this issue.\r\nFurthermore, the\r\n  dissentâ€™s reference to Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 585\r\n  S.E.2d 292 (2003), is unavailing.Â  In Tilley, this Court approved of the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s delaying the actual mailing of the class notice until\r\n  after certain issues were resolved on appeal.Â  This decision had absolutely\r\n  nothing to do with â€œopt-inâ€ class actions.\r\n[9]Â Â  Rule 20 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\ta) \r\n\t\t\tPermissive\r\n  Joinder. All persons may join in\r\n  one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly, severally,\r\n  or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction,\r\n  occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law\r\n  or fact common to all these persons will arise in the action. Â All persons may\r\n  be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them\r\n  jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right to relief in respect of or\r\n  arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or\r\n  occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all defendants will\r\n  arise in the action. Â A plaintiff or defendant need not be interested in\r\n  obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given\r\n  for one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective rights to\r\n  relief, and against one or more defendants according to their respective\r\n  liabilities.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nRule\r\n  20(a), SCRCP.\r\n[10]Â Â  One commentator has explained the negative effects\r\n  of an â€œopt-inâ€ procedure as follows:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  opt-in procedure is . . . a\r\n  very effective means of diminishing the size of a class, because an affirmative\r\n  act by an individual is always less likely than mere inaction and hence\r\n  presents certain dangers. Requiring class members to insert themselves into the\r\n  suit will result inevitably in smaller classes, unrelated to the magnitude of\r\n  the harm done or the merits of the case. Â In addition to its unfairness,\r\n  unnecessary reduction of class size negates the perceived benefits of class\r\n  actions as efficient and economic means of litigation, since those who fail to\r\n  opt in could bring their own suits, thereby multiplying cases where one would\r\n  do.\r\n\r\nKleiner\r\n  v.

Lambrecht (â€œElliottâ€), while driving with a suspended license, was\r\n  involved in a single-vehicle accident that resulted in the death of his\r\n  passenger, Allison T. Clegg.Â  At the time of the accident, Elliott was not a\r\n  resident of Lambrechtâ€™s home and was driving a 1994 Mazda, which was owned by\r\n  Elliott and not listed as a covered automobile on Lambrechtâ€™s insurance policy\r\n  with USAA.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Deborah J. Clegg, Cleggâ€™s mother and personal representative of her estate,\r\n  filed a wrongful death and survival action which named Elliott and Lambrecht as\r\n  defendants.Â  Based on her belief that Lambrecht owned the 1994 Mazda, Clegg\r\n  asserted causes of action for negligent entrustment and negligence on the\r\n  grounds that Lambrecht knew his son:Â  (1) was driving without a valid South Carolina driverâ€™s license; and (2) had a history of numerous traffic violations involving\r\n  excessive speed. Â Shortly after the initial filing, Clegg amended her Complaints.Â \r\n  In the Amended Complaints, Clegg named three other defendants[1] and characterized Lambrecht as the â€œde factoâ€ owner of the 1994 Mazda.Â Â  \r\nIn response, USAA denied Lambrechtâ€™s request to defend him in the underlying lawsuits. Â USAA then filed\r\n  a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination by the circuit court that\r\n  there was no coverage under Lambrechtâ€™s policy and, thus, it owed no duty to\r\n  defend.Â  Specifically, USAA claimed the insurance policy in effect at the time\r\n  of the accident did not name Elliott as an insured and did not list the 1994\r\n  Mazda as a covered vehicle.[2]Â Â \r\n  USAA also relied on the fact that Elliott owned the 1994 Mazda and was not a\r\n  resident relative at the time of the accident.Â  Based on these allegations,\r\n  USAA believed it did not have a duty to defend Lambrecht or Elliott given there\r\n  were no provisions of the policy which would render coverage for the accident.\r\nLambrecht filed an\r\n  Answer and Counterclaim in which he alleged that USAA was required to defend\r\n  him in the underlying action as well as reimburse him for the attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  and costs of defending the lawsuits and USAAâ€™s declaratory judgment action.Â \r\n  Lambrecht alleged he was a â€œcovered personâ€ under the terms of the policy and\r\n  that USAA owed him a duty to defend based on the following policy language:Â \r\n  â€œWe will pay damages for BI or PD for which any covered person becomes legally\r\n  liable because of an auto accident.â€[3]Â \r\n  As a result, Lambrecht filed a motion for partial summary judgment.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing on Lambrechtâ€™s motion, the circuit court issued an order on April 8, 2005, granting\r\n  partial summary judgment in favor of Lambrecht. Â The court prefaced its order\r\n  by noting the parties agreed the facts were undisputed and the motion presented\r\n  a question of law â€œwith regard to the construction of the policy of insurance\r\n  issued by USAA to Lambrecht.â€Â  In the recitation of the facts, the court\r\n  specifically noted that at the time of the accident:Â  (1) Elliott was nineteen\r\n  years old and no longer a member of Lambrechtâ€™s household; (2) the 1994 Mazda\r\n  was owned by Elliott; and (3) the 1994 Mazda was not identified as a covered\r\n  automobile in the Declarations page of the policy. \r\nThe court framed\r\n  the issue before it as follows:Â  â€œwhether [the allegations] even if ultimately\r\n  proven to be legally and factually baseless, trigger USAAâ€™s obligation to\r\n  defend Lambrecht in the Underlying Actions.â€Â  Relying on the language of the\r\n  policy and decisions from other jurisdictions, the court answered this question\r\n  in the affirmative.Â  With respect to the policy, the court found â€œ[t]he\r\n  unambiguous language of the Policy provides coverage for Lambrecht if the\r\n  claims against him arise from any auto accident, not just one in which he was a\r\n  driver, and was the result of the â€˜ownership, maintenance, or useâ€™ of â€˜any\r\n  auto,â€™ not just those automobiles insured under the Policy.â€ \r\nOn May 26, 2005,\r\n  USAA filed a motion for reconsideration of the April 8, 2005 order.Â  USAA\r\n  explained the filing of its motion was belated because it did not receive\r\n  notice of entry of the order until May 16, 2005. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Lambrecht objected to\r\n  the motion as untimely.Â  In support of his objection, Lambrecht filed an\r\n  affidavit from his attorney and an accompanying facsimile transmittal sheet\r\n  which indicated that Lambrechtâ€™s attorney had faxed a letter to USAAâ€™s counsel\r\n  on April 19, 2005, which stated that he had received a copy of the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing on\r\n  the motion,[4] the circuit court issued an order on August 22, 2005, in which it found USAAâ€™s\r\n  motion for reconsideration was timely filed.Â  As to the substantive issues, the\r\n  Court affirmed its previous order but modified the basis for its decision.[5] \r\nBoth parties\r\n  appealed the circuit courtâ€™s order to the Court of Appeals.Â  We certified the\r\n  appeal from the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\nAlthough the\r\n  parties in their cross-appeals raise multiple issues, we believe there are\r\n  essentially two questions before the Court:Â  (1) whether this Court has jurisdiction\r\n  to review the appeal?; and (2) whether the circuit court erred in finding USAA\r\n  had a duty to defend Lambrecht in the underlying wrongful death and survival\r\n  actions? [6] \r\nI.&nbsp; JURISDICTION\r\nIn his cross-appeal, Lambrecht contends the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding USAAâ€™s motion for reconsideration was timely given it\r\n  was filed more than ten days after entry of the April 8, 2005 order.Â  If the\r\n  motion is found to have been untimely, Lambrecht asserts the circuit court was\r\n  without jurisdiction to hear the motion.Â  As a result, Lambrecht claims this\r\n  Court, in turn, is without jurisdiction to review the appeal on the ground the\r\n  time was not tolled for USAA to file its Notice of Appeal. \r\nâ€œRule 203(b), SCACR, requires a party to\r\n  serve his notice of appeal within thirty days after receiving written notice of\r\n  the entry of a final order or judgment, and failure to do so divests this court\r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction and results in dismissal of the appeal.â€Â  Canal\r\n    Ins.

App. 1999).Â \r\n  â€œThe requirement of service of the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, i.e.,\r\n  if a party misses the deadline, the\r\n  appellate court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal and has no authority\r\n  or discretion to â€˜rescueâ€™ the delinquent party by extending or ignoring the\r\n  deadline for service of the notice.â€ Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp.,\r\n  361 S.C. 9, 14-15, 602 S.E.2d 772, 775 (2004). Â \r\nâ€œA timely post-trial motion, including a motion to alter or amend\r\n  the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, stays the time for an appeal for\r\n  all parties until receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or\r\n  denying such motion.â€ Id. at 15, 602 S.E.2d at 775 (citing Rule\r\n  203(b)(1), SCACR, Rules 50(e), 52(c), and 59(f), SCRCP).Â  â€œA motion under Rule\r\n  59(e) is timely if it is â€˜served not later than 10 days after receipt of\r\n  written notice of the entry of the order.â€™ Â If a timely motion is made pursuant\r\n  to Rule 59, the time for appeal runs from the receipt of written notice of\r\n  entry of the order disposing of the motion.â€Â  Coward Hund Constr. Co. v.\r\n    Ball Corp., 336 S.C. 1, 3, 518 S.E.2d 56, 57 (Ct. App. 1999).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nStrictly\r\n  applying the above-outlined rules of civil and appellate procedure, there is\r\n  evidence to support Lambrechtâ€™s assertion. However, for this Court to dismiss\r\n  the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, it would have to essentially reject the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s implicit credibility determination of USAAâ€™s counsel and find\r\n  that counsel made a false representation to the circuit court regarding notice\r\n  of entry of the order.Â  \r\nIn response to\r\n  Lambrechtâ€™s assertion that USAAâ€™s motion to reconsider was untimely, USAAâ€™s\r\n  counsel submitted a letter to the circuit court in which she claimed she did\r\n  not receive notice of entry of the final order until May 16, 2005, when\r\n  Lambrechtâ€™s counsel contacted her.Â  After receiving this notice, USAAâ€™s counsel\r\n  claimed she filed the motion for reconsideration on May 26, 2005, within the\r\n  requisite ten-day time period.Â  Presumably, USAAâ€™s counsel was being truthful\r\n  when she made this representation to the circuit court. See Rule 407(1),\r\n  SCACR (â€œA lawyer, being a member of the legal profession, is a representative\r\n  of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special\r\n  responsibility for the quality of justice.â€); Rule 3.3(a)(1)(â€œA lawyer shall\r\n  not knowingly make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to\r\n  correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the\r\n  tribunal by the lawyer.â€); Rule 4.1(a)(â€œIn the course of representing a client\r\n  a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to\r\n  a third person.â€); Rule\r\n  8.4(d)(â€œIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct\r\n  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.â€). Â \r\nBecause there is no\r\n  record of the hearing, this Court is unable to determine whether USAAâ€™s\r\n  counselâ€™s representations to the circuit court were under oath.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order is silent regarding the basis for its decision\r\n  finding that USAAâ€™s motion for reconsideration was timely filed.Â  In light of\r\n  this procedural posture, it was incumbent upon Lambrecht to file a motion\r\n  pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure to\r\n  request that the circuit court provide specific factual findings for its\r\n  decision.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d\r\n  122, 124 (1991) (holding that where a trial court does not explicitly rule on\r\n  an argument raised, and appellant makes no Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion to obtain a ruling, the appellate court may not address the issue); Floyd\r\n    v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œWhen a\r\n  trial judge makes a general ruling on an issue, but does\r\n  not address the specific argument raised by the appellant\r\n  and the appellant does not make a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to obtain a ruling on\r\n  the argument, the appellate court cannot consider the argument on appeal.â€).\r\nWithout explicit\r\n  findings of fact by the circuit court, our decision can only be based on the\r\n  implicit credibility determination of the circuit court.Â  Deferring to the\r\n  circuit court, we find USAAâ€™s counsel was credible in explaining her delay in\r\n  filing the motion for reconsideration.Â  See Reed v. Ozmint, 374\r\n  S.C. 19, 24, 647 S.E.2d 209, 211 (2007) (noting the circuit court judge, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony).Â  Based on the record before us,\r\n  we decline to reverse the decision of the circuit court.\r\nAs a result, we hold\r\n  USAAâ€™s motion to reconsider and Notice of Appeal were timely.Â  In turn, this\r\n  Court has jurisdiction to review USAAâ€™s appeal.\r\nII.&nbsp; DUTY TO DEFEND\r\nHaving found this Court has jurisdiction to review\r\n  USAAâ€™s appeal, the question becomes whether the circuit court erred in granting\r\n  partial summary judgment in favor of Lambrecht and finding that USAA had a duty\r\n  to defend Lambrecht against the underlying wrongful death and survival actions.Â  \r\nA. Standard of Review\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, appellate\r\n  courts apply the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, which provides that summary judgment is proper\r\n  when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty,\r\n    Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005); Fleming\r\n      v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). Â On appeal from an\r\n  order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will\r\n  review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the\r\n  evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below. Willis v.\r\n    Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 151, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004).\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry\r\n  into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€ Middleborough Horizontal Prop. Regime Council of Co-Owners v.\r\n    Montedison S.p.A., 320 S.C. 470, 479, 465 S.E.2d 765, 771 (Ct. App. 1995)\r\n  (citing Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 401 S.E.2d 169 (1991)). Â â€œEven\r\n  when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the\r\n  conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary\r\n  judgment should be denied.â€ Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App. 2004). Â â€œHowever,\r\n  when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds\r\n  cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.â€ Ellis\r\n    v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nB.&nbsp; Insurerâ€™s\r\n  Duty to Defend\r\nIn Sloan\r\n  Construction Company, Inc.. v. Central National Insurance Company of Omaha,\r\n  this Court explained the theoretical underpinnings of an insurerâ€™s duty to\r\n  defend:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  liability insurance policy contains two insuring provisions of major\r\n  significance: one, providing for the payment by the insurer of sums the insured\r\n  shall become obligated to pay, the other providing, in substance, for the\r\n  defense of any suit alleging bodily injury or property damage and seeking\r\n  damages payable under the terms of the policy. The latter clause also provides,\r\n  as a rule, that such a defense will be furnished even if any of the allegations\r\n  of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent.\r\n\tThe duty to defend is separate and\r\n  distinct from the obligation to pay a judgment rendered against the insured. \r\n\tAmerican\r\n    Casualty Co. v. Howard, 187 F.2d 322, 327 (4th Cir. 1951). Although these\r\n  duties are related in the sense that the duty to defend depends on an initial\r\n  or apparent potential liability to satisfy the judgment, the duty to defend\r\n  exists regardless of the insurerâ€™s ultimate liability to the insured.\r\n\t*\r\n  * *\r\n\tIndemnity\r\n  contemplates merely the payment of money. The agreement to defend contemplates\r\n  the rendering of services.\r\n\r\nSloan Constr.\r\n  Co. v. Central Natâ€™l Ins. Co. of Omaha, 269 S.C. 183, 186-87, 236 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1977) (citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nAlthough\r\n  an insurerâ€™s duty to defend is separate and distinct from its obligation to pay\r\n  a judgment, the two are in a sense interrelated.Â  If the facts alleged in the\r\n  complaint against an insured fail to bring a claim within policy coverage, an\r\n  insurer has no duty to defend.Â  S.C. Med. Malpractice Liab. Ins.\r\n    Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n v. Ferry, 291 S.C. 460, 463, 354 S.E.2d 378,\r\n  380 (1987). Â â€œAccordingly, the allegations\r\n  of the complaint determine the insurerâ€™s duty to defend.â€ Â Id.; B.L.G. Enters., Inc. v. First Fin. Ins.\r\n    Co., 334 S.C. 529, 535,\r\n  514 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1999) (â€œIt is well settled that an insurerâ€™s duty to\r\n  defend is based on the allegations of the underlying complaint.â€). Â â€œA\r\n  liability insurer must defend any suit alleging bodily injury or property\r\n  damage seeking damages payable under the terms of the policy.â€ B.L.G. Enters.,\r\n    Inc, 334 S.C. at 535, 514 S.E.2d at 330. â€œHowever, an insurer has no duty\r\n  to defend an insured where the damage was caused for a reason unambiguously\r\n  excluded under the policy.â€Â  Id. \r\nâ€œInsurance\r\n  policies are subject to the general rules of contract construction.â€Â  B.L.G.\r\n    Enters., Inc, 334 S.C. at 535, 514 S.E.2d at 330.Â  â€œCourts must enforce,\r\n  not write, contracts of insurance, and their language must be given its plain,\r\n  ordinary and popular meaning.â€ Sloan Constr. Co., 269 S.C. at 185, 236\r\n  S.E.2d at 819. â€œWhen a contract is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be\r\n  construed according to the terms the parties have used.â€Â  B.L.G. Enters.,\r\n    Inc, 334 S.C. at 535, 514 S.E.2d at 330.Â  â€œAmbiguous or conflicting terms\r\n  in an insurance policy must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and\r\n  strictly against the insurer.â€ Â Diamond State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus.,\r\n    Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 236, 456 S.E.2d 912, 915 (1995).\r\nApplying the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we\r\n  believe for several reasons the circuit court erred in finding USAA had a duty\r\n  to defend Lambrecht against the underlying wrongful death and survival suits.Â  Initially,\r\n  we find the circuit court overlooked an analytical step.Â  In our view, the\r\n  circuit court should have first determined whether the allegations in Cleggâ€™s\r\n  Complaints brought the claims within policy coverage.Â  Instead, the circuit\r\n  court omitted this step and considered factual allegations presented to it at\r\n  the summary judgment stage that were not part of the Complaints.Â  The absence\r\n  of this analysis is significant because the circuit court ordered USAA to\r\n  reimburse Lambrecht for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in defending the initial\r\n  filing of the lawsuit as well as defending against USAAâ€™s declaratory judgment\r\n  motion.Â  As will be discussed, we hold USAA did not have a duty to defend from\r\n  the onset of the litigation.\r\nAn analysis of this issue is dependent upon a comparison of the\r\n  relevant USAA policy provisions with the allegations in Cleggâ€™s Complaint.Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe policy provisions at issue are as follows:\r\n\r\nINSURING AGREEMENT\r\n\r\n\tWe will pay damages for BI or PD for which any covered\r\n  person becomes legally liable because of an auto accident.Â  We will\r\n  settle or defend, as we consider appropriate, any claim or suit asking\r\n  for these damages.Â  Our duty to settle or defend ends when our limit of\r\n  liability for these coverages has been paid or tendered.Â  We have no\r\n  duty to defend any suit or settle any claim for BI or PD not\r\n  covered under this policy.\r\n\r\nEXCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tB. \r\n\t\t\t We do not provide Liability Coverage for the\r\n  ownership, maintenance, or use of:Â  (2) Any vehicle, other than your covered\r\n    auto that is owned by you, or furnished or available for your regular use. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\t You and your refer to the â€œnamed\r\n  insuredâ€ shown in the Declarations and spouse if a resident of the same\r\n  household.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tE.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t Family member means a person related to you by blood,\r\n  marriage, or adoption who is a resident of your household.Â  This\r\n  includes a ward or foster child.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tL.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t Your covered auto means:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any vehicle shown in\r\n  the Declarations.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n[A] covered person as used [in the Liability Coverage\r\n  Section] means:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\t You or any family member for the\r\n  ownership, maintenance, or use of any auto or trailer.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHere, Cleggâ€™s initial Complaint and Amended Complaints\r\n  alleged causes of action against Lambrecht for negligent entrustment and negligence[7] based on Cleggâ€™s belief that\r\n  Lambrecht was the owner or â€œde factoâ€ owner of the 1994 Mazda.Â  Taking these\r\n  allegations as true, section B(2) of the USAA policy specifically excluded\r\n  coverage.Â  That provision explicitly excluded coverage for the â€œownershipâ€ of a\r\n  vehicle other than Lambrechtâ€™s covered automobiles.Â  Because the 1994 Mazda was\r\n  not listed in the Declarations section of the policy, it did not constitute a\r\n  covered automobile.Â  Accordingly, based solely on the allegations in Cleggâ€™s\r\n  Complaints, the USAA policy did not provide coverage.Â  Therefore, although USAA\r\n  has a continuing potential duty to defend based on its contractual relationship\r\n  with Lambrecht, it was not required to defend Lambrecht against this underlying\r\n  lawsuit given the duty was limited by the coverage outlined in the insurance\r\n  policy.\r\nFurthermore, to the extent Lambrecht argues that this issue is\r\n  controlled entirely by the â€œInsuring Agreementâ€ provision, we find this\r\n  assertion to be without merit.Â  In our view, this policy provision cannot be\r\n  read in isolation.Â  Instead, the allegations in the Complaint must be applied\r\n  to the policy in its entirety, which necessarily includes the exclusions\r\n  section.Â  See Falkosky v. Allstate Ins. Co., 311 S.C. 369, 372,\r\n  429 S.E.2d 194, 196 (Ct. App.), affâ€™d as modified, 312 S.C. 210, 439\r\n  S.E.2d 836 (1993) (recognizing an insurer has no duty to defend where liability is\r\n  excluded from coverage); Snakenberg v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 299 S.C.\r\n  164, 168, 383 S.E.2d 2, 4 (Ct. App. 1989) (finding insurer had no duty to\r\n  defend where policy expressly excluded coverage for damages alleged in the\r\n  Complaint).\r\nAlthough\r\n  the cases addressing an insurerâ€™s duty to defend generally limit this duty to\r\n  whether the allegations in a Complaint are sufficient to bring the claims\r\n  within the coverage of an insurance policy, an insurerâ€™s duty to defend is not\r\n  strictly controlled by the allegations in Complaint. Â Instead, the duty to\r\n  defend may also be determined by facts outside of the complaint that are known\r\n  by the insurer. Â See BP Oil Co. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., 329\r\n  S.C. 631, 638, 496 S.E.2d 35, 39 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œAlthough the determination\r\n  of an insurerâ€™s duty to defend is based upon the allegations in a complaint . .\r\n  . in some jurisdictions, the duty to defend will be measured by facts outside\r\n  of the complaint that are known by the insurer.â€).Â  The instant case provides\r\n  such a scenario given USAA presented additional facts at the declaratory\r\n  judgment stage that were not initially known to Clegg at the time she filed her\r\nComplaints.\r\nTurning to the actual analysis in the circuit courtâ€™s order, we\r\n  find the court erred in ruling that the USAA policy provided coverage for the\r\n  1994 Mazda when it was undisputed by the parties that Lambrechtâ€™s emancipated\r\n  adult son, who was not a resident relative, was the owner of the vehicle. \r\nFirst, under the terms of the policy, neither Lambrecht nor his\r\n  son was a â€œcovered person.â€Â  Because Elliott did not reside in Lambrechtâ€™s\r\n  household, he could not be considered a â€œcovered personâ€ in light of the fact\r\n  that he was not a â€œfamily member.â€Â  Given Lambrecht admitted that he did not\r\n  â€œown,â€ â€œmaintain,â€ or â€œuseâ€ the 1994 Mazda at the time of the accident, he also\r\n  did not meet the definition of a â€œcovered person.â€Â  \r\nSecondly, even if Lambrecht could be deemed a â€œcovered\r\n  person,â€ we disagree with the circuit courtâ€™s finding that he could be\r\n  potentially liable for a claim of negligent entrustment arising from the\r\n  negligent use of a noncovered automobile by someone other than the insured.Â  Â A\r\n  review of the cases cited by the circuit court reveals that they do not support\r\n  the courtâ€™s holding. Â In three of the cited cases, parents were found to be\r\n  liable for damages arising out of their childrenâ€™s negligent driving.Â  See Brown v. Champeau, 537 So. 2d 1120, 1122 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989)(en\r\n  banc) (holding insurance policy covered mother, who became statutorily liable\r\n  for her minor sonâ€™s driving where she signed for his license application, for damages\r\n  resulting from her sonâ€™s negligence while driving his own vehicle); Eason v.\r\n    Fin. Indem. Co., 721 So. 2d 528, 530 (La. Ct. App. 1998) (finding insurance\r\n  policy provided coverage for parents who were held vicariously liable by\r\n  statute for damages resulting from their minor childâ€™s negligent driving;\r\n  noting, under policy, that mother would not have been responsible for â€œmajor\r\n  childâ€ as a â€œfamily memberâ€); Scott v. Am. Standard Ins. Co. of Wisconsin,\r\n  392 N.W.2d 461, 464 (Wisc. Ct. App. 1986) (ruling insurance policy provided\r\n  coverage for mother who was statutorily liable for her minor sonâ€™s driving\r\n  negligence where she sponsored her minor son in order to allow him to obtain a\r\n  driverâ€™s license). Â Â We find these cases are distinguishable given the child at\r\n  issue was a minor and the parents were statutorily liable for damages caused by\r\n  their childrenâ€™s negligence.Â  In the instant case, Elliott was an emancipated\r\n  child at the time of the accident and there is no statutorily-imposed\r\n  obligation for Lambrecht to be responsible for damages caused by Elliottâ€™s negligence.Â \r\n  Finally, the fourth case relied on by the circuit court is inapposite.Â  Hertz\r\n    Corp. v. Amerisure Ins. Co., 627 So. 2d 22, 23 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1993) (holding\r\n  insurance policy provided coverage for insured who was legally liable for a\r\n  friendâ€™s negligent driving under the stateâ€™s dangerous instrumentality doctrine\r\n  where insured used his credit card to rent a vehicle for his friend).Â  Here,\r\n  there is no comparable dangerous instrumentality statute in this state.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the undisputed facts established that Elliott, not Lambrecht,\r\n  owned the vehicle involved in the accident.Â  Thus, we do not believe that\r\n  Lambrecht could be held â€œlegally liable,â€ as required by the terms of the\r\n  policy, for Elliottâ€™s negligence based on these cases.Â  \r\nAdditionally, there are cases from other jurisdictions in which\r\n  the courts have held that the parent of an emancipated adult child driving a\r\n  non-owned vehicle was not liable for the childâ€™s alleged negligent acts.Â  See Tollefson v. Am. Family Ins. Co., 226 N.W.2d 280, 284-85 (Minn. 1974) (recognizing\r\n  that insurance policy did not provide coverage for accident of emancipated\r\n  child, who did not reside in insuredâ€™s household and was driving a non-owned\r\n  vehicle); see also Safeco Ins.

Russ, Couch\r\n    on Insurance 3d Â§Â§ 118:21, 39 (Supp. 2007) (discussing liability coverage\r\n  for the use of non-owned vehicles). \r\nIII.Â  USAAâ€™s REMAINING\r\n  ISSUES\r\nIn\r\n  its brief, USAA raises two additional issues.Â  USAA contends the circuit court\r\n  erred in: Â (1) imposing a duty to defend when neither a covered auto nor a covered\r\n  person was involved in the accident because such a ruling expands automobile\r\n  liability policies beyond what the Legislature and the Supreme Court intended;\r\n  and (2) granting summary judgment as to whether USAA owed Respondent a defense\r\n  and an award of costs and fees when there had not been adequate time for\r\n  discovery in the case.Â  \r\nBecause these\r\n  issues were neither raised to nor ruled upon by the circuit court, we find they\r\n  were not properly preserved for our review. See B &amp; A Dev., Inc.\r\n    v. Georgetown County, 372 S.C. 261, 271, 641 S.E.2d 888, 894 (2007) (holding that issues must be raised and\r\n  ruled upon in the trial court to be preserved for appellate review); Staubes\r\n    v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding\r\n  that issues must be raised and ruled upon in the trial\r\n  court to be preserved for appellate review). Â Furthermore, in light of our decision finding USAA did not have a duty\r\n  to defend, we decline to address USAAâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (ruling that\r\n  an appellate court need not review remaining issues when\r\n  disposition of prior issues is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we find the circuit court correctly concluded that USAAâ€™s motion to\r\n  reconsider was timely filed.Â  Thus, we have jurisdiction to review USAAâ€™s\r\n  appeal.Â  As to the merits of the appeal, we reverse the decision of the circuit\r\n  court finding USAA had a duty to defend and reimburse Lambrecht.Â  Because the\r\n  USAA policy did not provide coverage to Lambrecht under either the allegations\r\n  of Cleggâ€™s Complaints or the additional facts known to USAA and presented at\r\n  the declaratory judgment stage, we hold USAA had no duty to defend and\r\n  reimburse Lambrecht.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE, Acting Chief Justice, WALLER, J., and Acting Justices E. C. Burnett, III and\r\n  Aphrodite K. Konduros, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  These individuals were Elliottâ€™s relatives and\r\nfriends who also had access to the vehicle involved in the accident.Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  The insurance policy that was in effect between\r\n  September 20, 2001, and March 20, 2002, named Lambrecht as the insured and\r\n  listed a 1997 BMW Z3 convertible and a 1997 Ford Explorer as covered vehicles.Â \r\n  Prior to the renewal of the policy on September 20, 2001, Elliott was deleted\r\nas a named insured and the 1994 Mazda was deleted as a covered vehicle. \r\n[3]Â Â  In his Answer and Counterclaim, Lambrecht admitted\r\n  that Elliott was neither a resident relative nor a named insured under the USAA\r\n  policy.Â  He further admitted he did not â€œuseâ€ or â€œmaintainâ€ the 1994 Mazda and\r\n  it was owned by Elliott and, thus, not listed as a covered automobile under the\r\n  policy.Â  Additionally, Lambrecht stated that the 1994 Mazda was not owned by,\r\n  furnished, or available for the regular use of a â€œfamily memberâ€ as defined in\r\nthe policy.\r\n[4]Â  The circuit court conducted the hearing in his\r\nchambers without a court reporter present.\r\n[5]Â  A comparison of the two orders reveals that the\r\n  circuit court deleted two paragraphs from the initial order in which it\r\naddressed USAAâ€™s allegations that the policy specifically excluded coverage. \r\n[6]Â  Because the jurisdictional question is a threshold\r\n  issue in the case, we have decided to address it first despite its order in the\r\n  partiesâ€™ briefs.Â  In terms of the parties remaining issues, we have\r\n  consolidated some issues and addressed some out of the â€œbriefedâ€ order in the\r\ninterest of clarity.\r\n[7]Â Â  â€œThe\r\n  theory of negligent entrustment provides:Â  the owner or\r\n  one in control of the vehicle and responsible for its use who is negligent in\r\n  entrusting it to another can be held liable for such negligent entrustment.â€ Am.

DSS became involved with the family because of\r\n    concern about the parentsâ€™ abuse of prescription drugs. The children were\r\n    eventually removed from the home.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  On the morning of September 16, 1996, [Hill] had a\r\n    telephone conversation with his caseworker, James Riddle.Â  [Hill] then called\r\n    his sister-in-law, Tammy Campbell, to ask for a ride to the DSS office. Tammy\r\n    and her husband gave [Hill] a ride to the Business &amp; Technology Center where the DSS office was located. On the way, [Hill] said that he was tired of people\r\n    â€œplaying Godâ€ with his children. The Campbells dropped [Hill] off at the front\r\n    of the building.\r\n  Sometime\r\n    before 2:00 p.m., several DSS workers returned to work after a birthday\r\n    luncheon. Annette Michael was walking towards her cubicle in the DSS office\r\n    area when another worker, Josie Currie, approached with her hands up. [Hill] was\r\n    behind Josie with a gun. Josie asked Annette where James Riddle's office was.\r\n    When Annette motioned with her hand, [Hill] told her to step in behind Josie.\r\n    The three of them walked down the aisle to James's cubicle. James was seated at\r\n    his desk speaking on the telephone. Josie stepped into the cubicle and said,\r\n  â€œThis man would like to see you.â€\r\n  [Hill]\r\n    fired a shot into the cubicle, hitting James in the head. He then pointed the\r\n    gun over Annetteâ€™s shoulder and shot Josie in the head. Annette fell with Josie\r\n    as a third shot was fired. Annette saw James fall over in his chair and she saw\r\n    a hole in his forehead before she fainted on the floor. Another DSS worker,\r\n    Michael Gregory, was found dead of a gunshot wound in the men's restroom. Both\r\n    Josie and James died within the next few hours. Annette was not injured.\r\n  The\r\n    next morning, police were still searching for [Hill]. At around 9:20 a.m.,\r\n    appellant was found lying on the railroad tracks behind the building with his\r\n    gun nearby. He had a bullet hole through the roof of his mouth and an exit\r\n    wound in the top of his skull. Although he was seriously injured, [Hill] was\r\n    able to speak. After he was taken to the hospital, he was given Miranda\r\n    warnings. [Hill] admitted to the shootings. He said he first shot Michael\r\n    Gregory in the restroom because Gregory had seen him. He shot James Riddle\r\n    because Riddle was his caseworker. He shot Josie Currie â€œbecause she was\r\n    black.â€\r\n\r\nState\r\n  v. Hill, 361 S.C. 297, 300-301, 604\r\n  S.E.2d 696, 697-698 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 1020 (2005).Â Â  This\r\nCourt affirmed Hillâ€™s murder convictions and sentences.[2]Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  Hill filed an application for PCR. Â On May 30, 2007, Solicitor Barbara Morgan\r\n  received a letter from Hill requesting her to assist him to â€œdrop the rest of\r\n  my appeals and have an execution date set.â€Â  The letter was forwarded to the\r\n  Court by the State.Â  Thereafter, on June 21, 2007, counsel for Hill submitted\r\n  an affidavit to the Court indicating Hill had changed his mind and did not wish to drop his appeals.[3]Â \r\n  On July 16, 2007, after consulting with counsel, Hill once again advised the\r\n  Court he wished to withdraw his pending PCR application and abandon any\r\n  remaining appeals.Â  The Court remanded the matter to Judge Early for a\r\n  competency evaluation pursuant to Singleton v. State, 313 S.C. 75, 437\r\n  S.E.2d 53 (1993).Â  After a hearing, a competency evaluation by Dr. Donna\r\n  Schwartz-Watts, and a thorough examination of Hill, Judge Early issued an order\r\n  finding Hill competent to waive his appeals, and found Hillâ€™s decision was made\r\nknowingly and voluntarily.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDoes\r\n  the evidence support a finding that Hill is competent to waive further review,\r\nand that his decision to do so is made knowingly and voluntarily?\r\nLAW\r\nThis\r\n  Court is charged with the responsibility of issuing a notice authorizing the\r\n  execution of a person who has been duly convicted in a court of law and\r\n  sentenced to death.Â  Hughes v. State, 367 S.C. 389, 395, 626 S.E.2d 805,\r\n  808 (2006).Â  We will issue an execution notice after the defendant has\r\n  exhausted all appeals and other avenues of PCR in state and federal courts, or\r\n  after that person, who is determined by this Court to be mentally competent,\r\n  knowingly and voluntarily waives such appeals.Â  See In re Stays of\r\n    Execution in Capital Cases, 321 S.C. 544, 471 S.E.2d 140 (1996); Roberts\r\nv. Moore, 332 S.C. 488, 505 S.E.2d 593 (1998).\r\nIn Singleton v.\r\n  State, we set forth the test to ascertain whether a capital defendant is\r\ncompetent to waive his right to further appellate review:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    first prong is the cognitive prong which can be defined as: whether a convicted\r\n    defendant can understand the nature of the proceedings, what he or she was tried\r\n    for, the reason for the punishment, or the nature of the punishment. The second\r\n    prong is the assistance prong which can be defined as: whether the convicted\r\n    defendant possesses sufficient capacity or ability to rationally communicate\r\n    with counsel. \r\n\r\n313 S.C. at 84, 437 S.E.2d at\r\n  58; accord State v. Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 47, 451 S.E.2d 883, 884\r\n  (1994). This standard is the same as that required before a defendant may be\r\nexecuted.Â  Torrence, 317 S.C. at 47, 451 S.E.2d at 884.\r\nWhen considering a\r\n  request by a capital defendant to waive the right to further review, we must\r\n  determine whether the defendant is competent and whether the decision is\r\n  knowing and voluntary.Â  See Reed v. Ozmint, 374 S.C. 19, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 209 (2007); Hughes v. State, 367 S.C. 389, 395, 626 S.E.2d 805,\r\n  808 (2006) (Court will issue an execution notice if the person, who is\r\n  determined by the Court to be mentally competent, knowingly and voluntarily\r\n  waives appeals and PCR); State v. Downs, 369 S.C. 55, 631 S.E.2d 79\r\n  (2006) (capital defendant may not waive his appellate or PCR rights unless\r\n  Court first determines the defendant is competent); State v. Torrence,\r\n  317 S.C. 45, 46, 451 S.E.2d 883, 883 (1994) (waiver may not be found unless\r\n  Court first determines defendant is competent and his decision is knowing and\r\n  voluntary). In making a determination on the competency of a convicted capital\r\n  defendant to waive his appellate or PCR rights, we are not bound by the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s findings or rulings, although the circuit court judge, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Hughes, 367 S.C. at 395,\r\n  626 S.E.2d at 808.Â  The matter is akin to one arising in our original\r\n  jurisdiction because it is the Court which must finally determine whether a\r\n  particular capital defendant is mentally competent to make a knowing and\r\n  voluntary waiver of his appellate or PCR rights.Â  Id. at 395-96, 626\r\nS.E.2d at 808. \r\nIn deciding the\r\n  issue of a capital defendantâ€™s competency, we review the defendantâ€™s history of\r\n  mental competency; the existence and present status of mental illness or\r\n  disease suffered by the defendant, if any, as shown in the record of previous\r\n  proceedings and in the competency hearing; the testimony and opinions of mental\r\n  health experts who have examined the defendant; the findings of the circuit\r\n  court which conducted a competency hearing; the arguments of counsel; and the\r\n  capital defendantâ€™s demeanor and personal responses to the Courtâ€™s questions at\r\n  oral argument regarding the waiver of appellate or PCR rights.Â  Reed v.\r\nOzmint, supra.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION/ANALYSIS\r\nHere, at the\r\n  hearing before Judge Early in August 2007, the only witnesses were Hill\r\n  himself, and Dr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, an expert in the field of forensic\r\npsychiatry. \r\nDr. Schwartz-Watts\r\n  testified Hill had had some very severe depressions and anxiety disorders in\r\n  the past, but that those were now in remission, and Hill was not on any\r\n  medications at all for mental illness.Â Â  She also opined that although Hill had\r\n  some brain damage and neurological impairments as a result of the gunshot wound\r\n  to his head, he had made remarkable improvement and had developed collateral\r\n  ways of thinking.Â Â  Although it sometimes takes Hill a while to answer a question,\r\n  and he is sometimes distractible, he can usually get back to the point.Â  He has\r\n  a bit of trouble with short term memory, but Dr. Schwartz-Watts did not\r\n  classify it as a serious organic condition; she diagnosed a cognitive\r\n  disorder.Â  She stated that Hill â€œis incredibly intelligent and in possession of\r\nhis faculties.â€Â  \r\nAs to Hillâ€™s\r\n  decision to waive his appeals, Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified the decision was\r\n  based on a number of rational bases.Â  She stated Hill is very close to his\r\n  father, whose health was beginning to fail, and Hill wanted to wait until such\r\n  time as his father would not be aware of his decision to waive his appeals.Â \r\n  When his father was hospitalized and placed on â€œdo not resuscitate status,â€\r\n  Hill felt it was time.Â  Also, Hillâ€™s religious beliefs as a Mormon formed some\r\n  of the basis for the decision.Â  Schwartz-Watts opined that Hill understands\r\n  what he was convicted for, his sentence, and the nature of the punishment, and\r\n  that he clearly knows the rights he is giving up.Â  She testified Hill trusts\r\n  his attorneys and even believed he was likely to prevail if he proceeded with\r\n  PCR.Â Â  Dr. Schwartz-Watts also testified there was no evidence that Hillâ€™s\r\n  decision to waive is based on any type of psychosis, delusion or outside\r\ninfluence.\r\nJudge Early\r\n  questioned Dr. Schwartz-Watts about Hillâ€™s initial request in May 2007 to drop\r\n  his appeals, then his brief change of mind in June 2007, then his reaffirmation\r\n  to waive them in July 2007.Â  Dr. Schwartz-Watts testified Hillâ€™s wavering was\r\n  due to his uncertainty concerning his fatherâ€™s health status and family\r\nissues.Â  \r\nJudge Early then\r\n  examined Hill.Â Â  Hill stated the only medication he was currently taking is\r\n  Zantac for heartburn.Â  He testified that he previously suffered depression,\r\n  post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety attacks, but that he did not feel\r\n  he was currently suffering from any of those illnesses.Â  With regard to the\r\n  self-inflicted gunshot on the day of the crimes, Hill testified he had some\r\n  brain damage as a result, which sometimes affects his memory, and he has a\r\n  small hole in the roof of his mouth which he believes sometimes causes\r\n  headaches, but other than that, he had no significant impairments.Â  He was not\r\ntaking any medication for brain damage.Â  \r\nHill testified as\r\n  to the crimes for which he was convicted, and the sentences, and his\r\n  understanding of his appeal to this Court and the United States Supreme Court.Â \r\n  He understood his PCR application was to challenge the effectiveness of his\r\n  counsel.Â  Understanding all of these things, Hill testified he wished to give\r\n  up his right to proceed with the hearing.Â Â  Judge Early went through each\r\n  allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel with Hill, and advised him that\r\n  if he prevailed, he would perhaps be entitled to a new trial.Â  The trial judge\r\n  then requested Hill to explain why he wanted to withdraw his PCR application\r\nand abandon any rights to appeal.Â  Hill responded, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Well,\r\n    itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve been thinking about since I got to death row in 2000.Â  By\r\n    then one of my trial attorneys - - he didnâ€™t really talk me out of it.Â  He just\r\n    basically said, you donâ€™t want to do that. . . . And he mentioned my dad and my\r\n    dad at the time was ill. . . he said that could, you know, - - that could be\r\n    the - - that could put him over the edge.Â Â  So, I was concerned about that, and\r\n    heâ€™s been coming to see me regularly until that time.Â Â  That was about two\r\n    years ago, . .. and the last time I saw him was last August and I knew\r\n    something was wrong . . . and then I got a letter from my mom a couple of\r\n    months ago and she said that he was near death . . . she got to the hospital\r\n    and they wanted her to sign a D.N.R. . . . I had mentioned it to him too, and\r\n    she told me in the letter not to - if I decided to do that not to write and\r\n    tell him but tell one of my lawyers or tell her and they would gather the\r\n    family around to tell him and that he wanted to die before I did and he would\r\n    if I would just talk to him about it.\r\n  So,\r\n    that was a lot to do with my decision - - his health - - and part of my\r\n    religious beliefs are that if you kill somebody, you shed somebody elseâ€™s\r\n    blood, that your blood has to be shed or you have to die in order to be\r\n    forgiven for that, and thatâ€™s one of my concerns and then thereâ€™s some health\r\n    issues that Iâ€™m dealing with thatâ€™s . . . bothersome at times. . .Â  Thereâ€™s not\r\n    really one big reason.Â Â  There is just - - - several different factors.\r\n\r\nThe trial court then\r\n  questioned Hill as to his understanding of what he was tried for and the reason\r\n  for his punishment.Â  He understood he had been convicted for killing three\r\n  people, and that he could be executed by electrocution or lethal injection.Â  He\r\n  testified that if his decision to withdraw his PCR application and waive\r\nfurther appeals were granted, he understood he would be put to death.Â Â Â  \r\nJudge Early\r\n  thoroughly explained the possibilities if Hill proceeded with PCR and were\r\n  granted a new trial.Â  Hill testified he believed he had received a fair trial,\r\n  and a fair sentence, and that he had not been threatened or coerced into this\r\n  decision.Â  Judge Early then questioned Hill as to his vacillation in May, June\r\n  and July 2007 as to whether he wanted to withdraw his appeals.Â  Hill explained,\r\n  â€œI was sure at the time, and [my attorney] came immediately to see me at Lieber\r\n  and she asked - - talked to me about some things and asked me to give her until\r\n  the end of the month before I made a final decision.â€Â  Hill did so and then\r\n  reiterated his request to withdraw his appeals.Â  Hill finally advised Judge\r\n  Early that it was still his desire to withdraw all appeals and have the death\r\nsentence carried out.Â  \r\nJudge Early\r\n  dismissed Hill from the stand and then inquired of Dr. Schwartz-Watts whether\r\n  Hillâ€™s responses in any way caused her to change her opinion.Â  She responded,\r\nâ€œnot at all, your honor.Â  Itâ€™s confirmed it.â€[4]Â  \r\nJudge Early issued\r\n  his order on August 20, 2007 finding the requirements of Singleton v. State were met, and that Hill is competent to waive his right to further collateral\r\n  review of his convictions and sentences; he understands the nature of the\r\n  proceedings, the crimes for which he was sentenced, and the nature of the\r\n  punishment.Â  Judge Early also found Hillâ€™s decision to waive further review\r\nknowing and voluntary.Â  \r\nThis Court\r\n  personally examined Hill on April 1, 2008.Â  He confirmed that it is still his\r\n  desire to waive his appeals and be executed.Â Â  We questioned Hill extensively\r\n  about the voluntary nature of his request, whether he fully understood the\r\n  appellate process, and what he could hope to gain by appealing his sentence.Â Â \r\n  We inquired as to his understanding of why he had been sentenced to death, why\r\n  he preferred to be executed than to pursue his appeals.Â  We found Hill to be\r\n  articulate, intelligent, and very well aware of his present circumstances, as\r\n  well as the events which gave rise to his incarceration.Â  Both his long and\r\n  short-term memory are ample, and do not appear to have been affected by his\r\n  self-inflicted gunshot wound on the day of the crimes.Â  Moreover, counsel for\r\n  Hill very eloquently elaborated on Hillâ€™s decision, advising that although he\r\n  and co-counsel did not agree with Mr. Hillâ€™s decision to forego any further\r\n  appeals, there was no basis upon which to challenge his competency, and the\r\n  decision had been contemplated by Hill for nearly eight years, and was clearly\r\nmade knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record, along with our personal examination of Hill, fully supports the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling that Hill is indeed competent, and his decision to waive further\r\n  appellate remedies is both knowing and voluntary.Â Â  Accordingly, we affirm the\r\n  findings of the circuit court.Â Â  Hillâ€™s request to withdraw his PCR application\r\nand waive his appeals is granted.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  The daughter, who was paralyzed in a 1994 car accident, died in 1998.\r\n[2] Hillâ€™s attempted murder conviction and related weapons charge were vacated, and\r\n  his second degree burglary conviction was reversed.Â  Hill, supra.\r\n[3] Â In the interim, Judge Early ordered a competency evaluation, pursuant to Council\r\n  v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120, 597 S.E.2d 782 (2004), authorizing Dr. Donna\r\n  Schwartz-Watts to determine if Hill was competent to proceed with PCR.\r\n[4] Â The State also introduced the portions of the trial transcript in which Hill\r\n  had been found competent to stand trial. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
