Connell, Jr., of Kelaher, Connell &amp; Connor, of Surfside Beach, for\r\n          Petitioner.\r\n        Linda\r\n          Weeks Gangi, of Thompson and Henry, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  This case stems from an\r\n  auto accident in which Petitioner Frances Irene Todd was injured.Â  A jury\r\n  awarded Todd $37,191.11.Â  Petitioner appealed and the Court of Appeals\r\n  affirmed.Â  Todd v. Joyner, Op. No.\r\n  4315 (S.C. Ct. App. re-filed January 18, 2008) (2009 Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 46\r\n  at 15).[1]Â \r\n  We granted certiorari and, finding no error, now affirm the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTS\r\nA\r\n  car driven by Joyner collided with a car in which Todd was a passenger.Â  Todd\r\n  sustained injuries and sued for damages.Â  State Farm, Joynerâ€™s insurer, defended\r\n  her at trial.Â  Joyner admitted negligence\r\n  and the trial court directed a verdict on liability.Â  Consequently, the sole\r\n  issue before the jury was the amount of damages owed Todd.Â  In disputing Toddâ€™s\r\n  claimed damages, Joyner presented Dr. Richard J. Friedman as an expert in\r\n  orthopedic surgery.Â  Because Dr. Friedman was unavailable during trial, his\r\n  deposition testimony was read to the jury.Â  At the deposition, Todd questioned\r\n  Dr. Friedman concerning his relationship with State Farm, but Friedman was\r\n  unable to provide answers to most questions.Â  Dr. Friedman testified that he\r\n  did not know the number of times he testified for other lawyers in defense\r\n  cases or how many depositions he testified in per year.Â  He explained that he\r\n  does not keep records and routinely throws out invoices relating to past expert\r\n  testimony once his bill is paid.Â  Moreover, when asked what percentage of his\r\n  practice was comprised of expert testimony, Dr. Friedman answered â€œvery smallâ€\r\n  and outlined a typical busy work week which left â€œnot much time . . . for\r\n  anything else.â€\r\nFollowing the deposition,\r\n  Todd subpoenaed payment records from State Farm for regarding Dr. Friedmanâ€™s\r\n  expert consultation in any case for the past three years.Â  The records supplied\r\n  showed that Friedman was paid between $50,000 and $60,000 for work on eighteen\r\n  different claim numbers during calendar years 2003-2005.Â  Todd attempted to\r\n  introduce the payment records at trial as evidence of bias, but the trial judge\r\n  refused, citing Rule 403 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure\r\n  (SCRCP).\r\nIn\r\n  his testimony, Dr. Friedman opined that Todd suffered no permanent impairment\r\n  from the auto accident and that any treatment she received more than roughly\r\n  four months after the accident was not reasonable and necessary or proximately\r\n  caused by the accident.Â  Dr. Friedman was the only expert whose testimony was\r\n  offered at trial.Â  At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found for Todd in\r\n  the amount of $37,191.11, the amount of medical bills presented at the trial.Â \r\n  Todd moved for additur and filed a motion for a new trial, both of which\r\n  were denied.\r\nTodd\r\n  contested a number of evidentiary rulings by the trial court as well as the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant her motion for additur.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s rulings on all points.Â  Todd, 376\r\n  S.C. 144, 654 S.E.2d 862.Â  We granted certiorari.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err in\r\n  affirming the trial court&rsquo;s decision to bar the introduction of evidence of payments made by State\r\n    Farm to the expert?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the Court of Appeals err in\r\n  affirming the trial court&rsquo;s decision allowing Joyner&rsquo;s expert to read from\r\n  Todd&rsquo;s medical records during his testimony? \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Yoho v. Thompson\r\nOn certiorari,\r\n  Todd argues that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  refusal to allow introduction of the payment records because the records were\r\n  properly admissible to show bias under Yoho v. Thompson, 345 S.C. 361,\r\n  548 S.E.2d 584 (2001).Â  We disagree.\r\nPrior\r\n  to 1995, the long-standing rule in South Carolina was that, in an action for\r\n  damages, a defendantâ€™s insurance coverage should not be revealed to the jury.Â  Yoho,\r\n  345 S.C. at 365, 548 S.E.2d at 585.Â  Rule 411 of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Evidence (SCRE) altered the bar on evidence of insurance and provides:\r\n\r\n  Evidence that a person was or was not insured against\r\n    liability is not admissible upon the issue of whether the person acted\r\n    negligently or otherwise wrongfully.Â  This rule does not require the exclusion\r\n    of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose,\r\n    such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a\r\n    witness.\r\n\r\nRule 411, SCRE (2008).\r\nIn Yoho,\r\n  we adopted a framework for analysis in considering whether or not to admit\r\n  evidence of insurance.Â  We held that if Rule 411 does not require the exclusion\r\n  of evidence of insurance, the court should then proceed to perform Rule 403\r\n  analysis and consider whether the probative value of the evidence is\r\n  substantially outweighed by the prejudicial effect and potential for confusing\r\n  the jury.Â  Yoho, 345 S.C. at 365, 548 S.E.2d at 586.Â  As liability was\r\n  admitted in this case, Rule 411 is not implicated and the question whether the\r\n  records are admissible turns on Rule 403.\r\nIn\r\n  considering whether an expertâ€™s connection to a defendantâ€™s insurer is\r\n  sufficiently probative to outweigh the prejudice to the defendant resulting\r\n  from the juryâ€™s knowledge that the defendant carries liability insurance, this\r\n  Court adopted the â€œsubstantial connectionâ€ analysis employed in a majority of\r\n  jurisdictions.Â  Id. at 366, 548 S.E.2d at 586.Â  Applying the\r\n  â€œsubstantial connectionâ€ test, the Yoho Court noted (1) that the expert\r\n  was not merely paid an expert fee in the case but instead maintained an\r\n  employment relationship with the insurance company and other insurance\r\n  companies; (2) the expert consulted for the insurance company and gave lectures\r\n  to its agents and adjusters; (3) 10-20% of the expertâ€™s practice consisted of\r\n  reviewing records for insurance companies; and (4) the expertâ€™s yearly salary\r\n  was based in part on his insurance consulting work.Â  Id.Â  Based on these\r\n  facts, the Yoho Court found that the expert had a substantial connection\r\n  to the insurance company and therefore, the trial court erred in barring\r\n  admission of evidence of insurance.Â  Id.\r\nTodd\r\n  showed, through payment records and the testimony of Potts, that Dr. Friedman\r\n  earned approximately $50,000 from State Farm during calendar years 2003-2005\r\n  based on work on eighteen claims, but presented no evidence as to Dr.\r\n  Friedmanâ€™s total earnings during that period.Â  Moreover, unlike Yoho,\r\n  the evidence appears to show that Dr. Friedman was paid an expert fee rather\r\n  than having an employment relationship with State Farm.Â  In short, the evidence\r\n  presented by Todd does not show as strong a connection between the expert and\r\n  the insurance company as in Yoho and we cannot conclude that the Court\r\n  of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court. \r\nII. Medical Records\r\nTodd\r\n  contends that the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision allowing Dr. Friedman to read from Toddâ€™s medical records at trial.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nDuring\r\n  the deposition, which was read to the jury at trial, Dr. Friedman was asked to\r\n  comment on the reasonableness of Toddâ€™s medical treatment and whether injuries\r\n  Todd claimed resulted from the car accident actually existed before that time.Â \r\n  Dr. Friedman based his opinions, in part, on a review of Toddâ€™s medical records\r\n  and, in explaining his opinions, Dr. Friedman referenced Toddâ€™s medical records\r\n  a number of times and occasionally read from the records.Â  Since Dr. Friedmanâ€™s\r\n  testimony centered on the idea that injuries Todd claimed resulted from the\r\n  wreck actually existed prior to the accident, most of the portions of the\r\n  records read by Dr. Friedman referred to Toddâ€™s statements or complaints to her\r\n  doctors.[2]\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Todd objected to Dr. Friedmanâ€™s testimony as to medical records as\r\n  hearsay.Â  We find no error.Â  We find that the records introduced through Dr.\r\n  Friedmanâ€™s testimony referring to complaints or statements Todd made to her\r\n  physicians are not barred by the hearsay rule.Â  Rule 803, SCRE provides as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule,\r\n    even though the declarant is available as a witness:\r\n  . . . \r\n  (4) Statements for Purposes of Medical Diagnosis or\r\n    Treatment.Â  Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and\r\n    describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations,\r\n    or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof\r\n    insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment; provided, however,\r\n    that the admissibility of statements made after commencement of the litigation\r\n    is left to the courtâ€™s discretion.\r\n\r\nRule 803(4), SCRE (2008).Â \r\n  The medical history referenced by Dr. Friedman falls within the ambit of Rule\r\n  803(4) and therefore, does not run afoul of the hearsay rule.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appeals, therefore, did not err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision to\r\n  allow the testimony.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that the\r\n  Court of Appeals did not err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s finding that Todd\r\n  did not show a â€œsubstantial connectionâ€ between State Farm and Dr. Friedman to\r\n  require admission of evidence of insurance.Â  We further find no error in the\r\n  decision to allow Dr. Friedman to refer to Toddâ€™s medical records, and\r\n  therefore affirm on this ground.Â  We affirm all remaining issues under Rule\r\n  220(c).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, J., and Acting Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concur.Â  BEATTY, J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Dr. Friedman was employed by State Farm on\r\n  eighteen different occasions over a three year period immediately prior to\r\n  trial.Â  This employment relationship clearly constitutes a substantial\r\n  connection between State Farm and Dr. Friedman.Â  Evidence of this substantial\r\n  connection should have been admitted to show possible bias on Dr. Friedmanâ€™s\r\n  part.Â  See Yoho v. Thompson, 345 S.C. 361, 548 S.E.2d 584 (2001)\r\n  (holding evidence of a defense expertâ€™s medical consulting work for an\r\n  insurance carrier was admissible, even though the evidence contained a\r\n  reference to insurance, because considerable latitude is allowed during\r\n  cross-examination to test a witnessâ€™s bias, prejudice, or credibility).\r\nThe probative value of this evidence far outweighed\r\n  its prejudicial effect.Â  See id. at 366, 548 S.E.2d at 586\r\n  (stating that a substantial connection between an expert and a defendantâ€™s\r\n  insurer is sufficiently probative on the issue of bias so as to outweigh the\r\n  prejudice to the defendant resulting from the fact that the jury knows the\r\n  defendant carries liability insurance).Â  Considering the fact that liability\r\n  insurance has been required in South Carolina for decades, see S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 56-10-10, -20, -220 (2006), it is highly probable that every juror\r\n  already knew that insurance was available.Â  The only unknown was the name of\r\n  the carrier.Â  Therefore, it is probable that there was no prejudicial effect to\r\n  be concerned with.\r\nConnecting Dr. Friedman to the insurance carrier was\r\n  highly probative on the issue of his bias in favor of the insurance carrier,\r\n  State Farm, and Joyner.Â  In my view there was very little, if any, unfair\r\n  prejudice to Joyner.\r\nI concur in the remaining issues.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Court of Appeals filed the original opinion in this matter on November 27,\r\n  2007.Â  The Court of Appeals denied the petition for rehearing but withdrew the\r\n  original opinion and substituted the above-referenced opinion, which makes only\r\n  minor changes to the original version.Â  Apparently, the new opinion was never\r\n  submitted for publication.Â  We now revise the citation to reference the\r\n  re-filed opinion.\r\n[2] For example, Dr. Friedman testified that Todd â€œdid complain of headaches to her\r\n  doctor on March 19th, 1998.â€\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26737","title":"In the Matter of George A.

Harrell, Jr., Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives, then filed\r\n  a motion to intervene in the Governorâ€™s action.Â  We granted that motion, and\r\n  the Speaker filed a return in opposition to the Governorâ€™s petition.Â  In\r\n  addition, Speaker Harrell filed his own petition for a writ of mandamus in the\r\n  Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction.Â  The Speaker asked the Court to direct the\r\n  Commission to issue â€œits investigation materials and information to the House\r\n  of Representativesâ€ because\r\n  the House is â€œthe sole prosecuting authority for purposes of impeachment.â€ Â The Commission filed a return in\r\n  opposition to the Speakerâ€™s petition.Â  The Governor sought to intervene in the\r\n  Speakerâ€™s action; we granted that request.\r\nBecause of the exigencies related to the case, we agreed to\r\n  entertain this matter in the Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction, on an expedited\r\n  basis, and heard oral arguments of the parties on October 19, 2009.Â  On October\r\n  21, 2009, we issued an order requesting additional materials and briefs from\r\n  the parties on the issue of waiver.Â  With that briefing now complete, the\r\n  matter is ripe for our decision.\r\nFACTS\r\nBy letter dated August 18, 2009, Governor Sanford was informed by\r\n  Herbert R. Hayden, Jr., Executive Director of the Commission, that the\r\n  Commission had determined an ethics complaint against the Governor set forth â€œsufficient\r\n  factsâ€ to warrant an investigation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  8-13-320(10)(c) (Supp. 2008).Â  The Governor was informed that: (1) he would be\r\n  contacted by an investigator concerning any statements he desired to make; and\r\n  (2) he could provide a written response to the complaint and include any\r\n  documentation he would like for the Commission to consider.\r\n\r\n\tSignificantly,\r\n  this letter also advised the Governor of the following:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn accordance with [S.C. Code Ann.] Section 8-13-320(9) and (10), all\r\n  complaints, investigations, inquires [sic], hearings, and accompanying\r\n  documents are confidential unless the respondent waives the right to\r\n    confidentiality in writing to the Commission, or the Commission issues a\r\n  public dispositionâ€¦.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nBy\r\n  letter to Hayden dated August 24, 2009, counsel for the Governor stated\r\n  it was his understanding that if the Governor waived his right to\r\n  confidentiality the following would apply:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tThe only information\r\n  that will be made public during the pendency of this matter is the fact that an\r\n  investigation is being conducted and the Complaint Form itself;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe investigation and the results thereof, \r\n\t\t\tincluding any statements or documents, will remain confidential and \r\n\t\t\twill not be made public at any time, either during or after the \r\n\t\t\tconclusion of this matter;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tIf a hearing is held in this matter, such hearing \r\n\t\t\twill be held in executive session unless Governor Sanford requests \r\n\t\t\tan open hearing; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4. \r\n\t\t\tAny action taken by the Commission will be made \r\n\t\t\tpublic upon final disposition.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n&nbsp;(Emphasis in\r\n  original).Â  Counsel for the Governor further represented that his understanding\r\n  was based on information Hayden had given him during their recent discussions\r\n  regarding the impact of a potential waiver by the Governor.\r\nHayden responded to counselâ€™s letter with his own letter dated\r\n  August 27, 2009, which stated: \r\n\r\n\tIf Governor Sanford waives his right to confidentiality, the\r\n  following will apply:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tThe only\r\n  information that will be made public during the pendency of this matter is the\r\n  fact that an investigation is being conducted and the Complaint Form itself;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;The investigative\r\n  report, including any statements or documents, will not become part of the\r\n  public record; however, any testimony given, documents entered into evidence at\r\n  an administrative hearing, and the Commissionâ€™s findings will become a part of\r\n  the formal record along with the Commissionâ€™s Decision and Order, and will be\r\n  public;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tIf a hearing is held in this matter, such hearing \r\n\t\t\twill be held in executive session unless Governor Sanford requests \r\n\t\t\tan open hearing; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAny action taken by the Commission will be made \r\n\t\t\tpublic upon final disposition.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Hayden also stated that the only item â€œaffected by a waiver of\r\n  confidentiality is Item 1. Â Items 2, 3 and 4 are required by either statute\r\n    or regulation and will apply regardless of a waiver.â€Â  (Emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  following day, August 28, 2009, the Governor himself (i.e., not counsel\r\n  for the Governor) sent a signed letter to Hayden setting forth his record of â€œgoing\r\n  the extra mile in fighting for transparency in our state government.â€Â  The\r\n  Governorâ€™s August 28th letter further stated as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn an effort to once again go the extra mile, I would like to\r\n  waive my right to confidentiality in your upcoming ethics probe.Â  I believe that what \r\n\tthe whole of our\r\n    travel records will show is that this administration has worked very hard\r\n  to be a good steward of taxpayer resources.\r\n\tItâ€™s also my hope that my decision to take the unilateral step\r\n  of waiving confidentiality will serve to encourage both the public to\r\n  invite, and legislators to lead, in changing the current system.Â  In this system all constitutional\r\n  officers, and every state employee, is held to one standard - while the General\r\n  Assembly lives under a completely different standard without transparency.Â  I\r\n  strongly believe this needs to change, and again do hope this is one of the\r\n  byproducts of what takes place this fall.[1]\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  his petition for a writ of mandamus, Governor Sanford maintains he actually\r\n  intended his August 28th letter to be a â€œlimitedâ€ waiver of\r\n  confidentiality and not the unconditional waiver conveyed by the letterâ€™s clear\r\n  terms.\r\nThe Governorâ€™s counsel met with Hayden on September 8, 2009.\r\n  Hayden advised counsel that the Commission intended to publicly distribute its\r\n  preliminary investigative report to the House of Representatives.\r\nOn\r\n  September 14, 2009, the Governor filed a Motion to Enjoin Dissemination of\r\n  Investigative Report with the Commission.[2]Â \r\n  By letter dated September 15, 2009, Cathy Hazelwood, counsel for the\r\n  Commission, advised the Governorâ€™s counsel that the motion was premature\r\n  because the investigation into this matter is â€œongoing and no report has been\r\n  begun, let alone completed.â€Â  She explained the Governor would receive the\r\n  report â€œwhen the Commission receives the report,â€ and at that time, there would\r\n  be an opportunity â€œto argue any and all motions related to this matter.â€\r\nRegarding\r\n  Speaker Harrellâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus, he argues\r\n  that pursuant to Article XV,\r\n  Section 1 of the South Carolina Constitution, the House has the sole power of\r\n  impeachment.[3]Â \r\n  Therefore, because the House of Representatives is the\r\n  prosecutorial authority for purposes of impeachment, the Speaker contends this Court should order the Commission to release its\r\n  investigation materials to the House.Â  Â Â \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n\t\t\tHas either the Governor or the Speaker met the \r\n\t\t\trequirements for the issuance of a writ of mandamus?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDoes the Governorâ€™s August 28th letter constitute a complete waiver of confidentiality under S.C. Code Ann. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tÂ§\r\n  8-13-320(10)(g)?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Writ of Mandamus\r\nThis\r\n  Court has the power to issue writs or orders of injunction or mandamus.Â  S.C.\r\n  Const. Art. V, Â§ 5; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-310 (1976).Â  The writ of mandamus is â€œthe highest\r\n  judicial writ known to the law.â€ Â Willimon\r\n    v. City of Greenville, 243 S.C. 82, 86, 132 S.E.2d 169, 170 (1963); accord Edwards v. State, 383 S.C. 82, 678\r\n  S.E. 2d 412 (2009); City of Rock Hill v. Thompson, 349 S.C. 197, 563\r\n  S.E.2d 101 (2002); Ex parte\r\n    Littlefield, 343 S.C. 212, 540 S.E.2d\r\n  81 (2000). Â The â€œprincipal functionâ€ of\r\n  mandamus â€œis to command and execute, and not to inquire and adjudicate;\r\n  therefore, it is not the purpose\r\n  of the writ to establish a legal right, but to enforce one which has already\r\n  been established.â€Â  Willimon, 132 S.E.2d at 171; see also Porter\r\n    v. Jedziniak, 334 S.C. 16, 18, 512 S.E.2d 497, 497 (1999) (â€œThe primary\r\n  purpose of a writ of mandamus is to enforce an established right and to enforce\r\n  a corresponding imperative duty created or imposed by law.â€); \r\n\r\n\r\n    Redmond v. Lexington County Sch.\r\n      Dist. No. 4, 314 S.C. 431, 445 S.E.2d\r\n  441&nbsp;(1994) (a writ of mandamus is not appropriate for a discretionary authority).\r\nTo\r\n  obtain a writ of mandamus requiring the performance of an act, the petitioner\r\n  must show: Â (1) a duty to perform the act; (2) the ministerial nature of the\r\n  act; (3) the petitionerâ€™s specific legal right for which discharge of the duty\r\n  is necessary; and (4) a lack of any other legal remedy.Â  E.g., Wilson\r\n    v. Preston, 378 S.C. 348, 662 S.E.2d 580 (2008); Porter v. Jedziniak, supra; Willimon, supra.Â  Mandamus is based on the theory\r\n  that an officer charged with a purely ministerial duty can be compelled to\r\n  perform that duty in case of refusal.Â  Wilson v. Preston, supra.\r\nThe confidentiality provision of the Ethics Act is found in S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 8-13-320(10)(g), which states as follows:\r\n\r\n\tAll investigations, inquiries, hearings, and accompanying\r\n  documents must remain confidential until final disposition of a matter unless\r\n  the respondent waives the right to confidentiality.Â  The willful release of confidential\r\n  information is a misdemeanor, and any person releasing such confidential\r\n  information, upon conviction, must be fined not more than one thousand dollars\r\n  or imprisoned not more than one year.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  there is no ministerial act to be performed under this provision, and\r\n  consequently no duty to perform the act.Â  Â Â Moreover, the Governor has other\r\n  legal remedies available.Â  As noted, the Governor has a motion for an\r\n  injunction pending before the Commission in which he seeks the same relief he\r\n  is seeking from this Court.Â  The Commission has indicated it will not\r\n  disseminate the investigative summary or preliminary report in this matter\r\n  until the Governorâ€™s motion has been heard and acted upon by the Commission\r\n  and, if the Commissionâ€™s decision is adverse to the Governor, until he has had\r\n  an opportunity to seek review of that decision.Â  For these reasons, a writ of\r\n  mandamus is simply not available to the Governor under these circumstances and\r\n  his petition is therefore denied.\r\nLikewise,\r\n  there is no ministerial act under the statute requiring the Commissionâ€™s investigation\r\n  materials to be provided to the House of Representatives.Â  While the Ethics Act\r\n  clearly indicates the statute â€œdoes not limit the power of either chamber of\r\n  the General Assembly to impeach a public official,â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  8-13-320(n), it is nonetheless indisputable that there is no â€œimperative duty created or imposed byâ€ the Ethics Act\r\n  which compels the Commission to release its investigation materials to the\r\n  House.Â  Porter v. Jedziniak, 334 S.C. at 18, 512 S.E.2d at 497.[4]Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we note the House has a number of alternative avenues available for obtaining\r\n  the information it seeks, none of which have been pursued.Â  See, e.g.,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-69-10 (2005); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  30-4-10 et seq. (2007 &amp; Supp. 2008).Â  Additionally, as\r\n  the parties conceded at oral argument in this matter, the pending ethics\r\n  investigation is wholly unrelated to any potential impeachment.Â  The House of\r\n  Representatives may proceed (or not proceed) with impeachment at its own\r\n  choosing, irrespective of any finding by the Commission, or any other\r\n  investigation of the Governor.\r\nAccordingly, like the Governor, the Speaker has failed to\r\n  establish the necessary requirements for issuing a writ of mandamus; therefore,\r\n  we deny the Speakerâ€™s petition as well.\r\n\r\n2. Waiver\r\nAlthough a writ of mandamus is unavailable to the Governor, we are\r\n  cognizant of the Governorâ€™s pending motion filed with the Commission for an injunction based on the same legal grounds as are asserted to this Court in his petition\r\n  for a writ of mandamus.Â  Because it is â€œthe substance of the requested relief that mattersâ€ and not\r\n  the form in which the petition for relief is framed, we may construe the\r\n  Governorâ€™s request as one for injunctive relief if that is substantively what\r\n  he is requesting.[5]Â  Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC v. Mallon,\r\n  381 S.C. 417, 437, 673 S.E.2d 448, 458&nbsp;(2009); accord Richland County v. Kaiser, 351 S.C. 89, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 260 (Ct. App. 2002) (where the Court of\r\n  Appeals treated a denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus as a denial of\r\n  injunctive relief).\r\nGenerally\r\n  speaking, an injunction should be granted only where some irreparable injury is\r\n  threatened for which the parties have no adequate remedy at law.Â  Greenwood\r\n    County v. Shay, 202 S.C. 16, 23 S.E.2d 825&nbsp;(1943).Â  The Governor contends that if the Commission is allowed to publicly disclose information about the investigation, â€œthe\r\n  integrity of the entire processâ€ would be destroyed.Â  Thus, he has requested\r\n  that we prevent the Commission from publicly distributing any\r\n  investigatory reports or other information about the investigation.Â  Given the\r\n  arguments raised by the Governor, we find\r\n  the requested relief is akin to a prohibitory injunction.[6] Â Accordingly, we will also construe the petition as one asking for injunctive\r\n  relief. Â \r\nThe\r\n  Governorâ€™s argument is based upon the confidentiality provision of the Ethics\r\n  Act and the accompanying regulations.Â  See Â§ 8-13-320(10)(g); S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 52-718 (Supp. 2008).Â  As\r\n  outlined above, the Ethics Act clearly provides a right of confidentiality; just\r\n  as clearly, however, the statute allows this right to be waived by the\r\n  respondent under investigation. Â Â§ 8-13-320(10)(g); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 52-718(B) (Supp. 2008) (the\r\n  respondent â€œmay waive the confidentiality of the proceeding in writing filed\r\n  with the Commissionâ€).\r\nThe dispositive issue therefore becomes:Â  Did the Governorâ€™s\r\n  August 28th letter waive his right to confidentiality?\r\nA waiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or\r\n  relinquishment of a known right. Â E.g., Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473,\r\n  682 S.E.2d 804 (2009).Â  Waiver requires a party to have known of a right and\r\n  known that right was being abandoned.Â  Id.Â  The determination of whether oneâ€™s actions constitute\r\n  waiver is a question of fact.Â  Laser Supply and Servs., Inc. v. Orchard Park\r\n    Assocs., 382 S.C. 326, 676 S.E.2d 139&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009). Â Because the instant case has been brought in the Courtâ€™s\r\n  original jurisdiction, it is within the province of this Court to make findings\r\n  of fact and conclusions of law regarding the issues before us.Â  See Johnson\r\n    v. Catoe, 345 S.C. 389, 548 S.E.2d 587 (2001); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-340\r\n  (1976).Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we find the Governor knew of his right to confidentiality, as it was clearly\r\n  set forth and correctly stated in the complaint and the initial letter from the\r\n  Commission, which was sent directly to Governor Sanford and not to his\r\n  counsel.Â  The Governor asserts, however, that his\r\n  August 28th letter effected a â€œlimitedâ€ waiver of confidentiality,\r\n  and his expectation was that only the existence of an investigation and the contents of the Complaint would be\r\n  made publicly available.\r\nWe disagree.Â  The intent of the August 28th letter -\r\n  which Governor Sanford himself signed and was written on the Governorâ€™s\r\n  letterhead - is clear from the letterâ€™s plain language:\r\n\r\n\tIn an effort to once again go the extra mile, I would like to\r\n  waive my right to confidentiality in your upcoming ethics probe.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the\r\n  Governor characterized this waiver as a â€œunilateral step.â€Â  Governor Sanfordâ€™s\r\n  August 28th letter did not limit the waiver in any way, shape or\r\n  form.Â  It did not reference the very specifically delineated restrictions that had\r\n  been outlined by Hayden to the Governorâ€™s counsel. Â Indeed, the Governor\r\n  specifically stated this is â€œmy decision.â€ Â The additional language the Governor used in the letter, regarding\r\n  â€œfighting for transparency,â€ disclosure, as well as his reference to travel\r\n  records - which would not have been disclosed under the partial waiver that had\r\n  been discussed between the Governorâ€™s counsel and Hayden - indicates\r\n  his intent was to waive confidentiality without limitation and without\r\n  reliance upon the communications between his counsel and Hayden.[7]\r\nThus, the only reasonable interpretation of Governor Sanfordâ€™s\r\n  August 28th letter is that it was an intentional relinquishment of\r\n  the right to confidentiality, and therefore a valid - and complete - waiver.Â  Eason, supra.\r\nGovernor Sanford also maintains that even when confidentiality is\r\n  waived pursuant to section 8-13-320(10)(g), the waiver is limited by the regulations applicable to confidentiality.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nSection 8-13-320(10)(g) states that â€œ[a]ll\r\n  investigations, inquiries, hearings, and accompanying documents must remain\r\n  confidential until final disposition of a matter unless the respondent waives\r\n  the right to confidentiality.â€ \r\nRegulation\r\n  52-718 governs the confidentiality of the Commissionâ€™s ethics proceedings.Â \r\n  Subsection 52-718(F) provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tAfter\r\n  the final disposition of a matter where a violation is found, the Commission\r\n  shall prepare a public record which shall consist of the pleadings and record\r\n  of the hearing.Â  The Commissionâ€™s internal and investigatory papers including\r\n  work product shall not be made part of the public record.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on regulation\r\n  52-718(F), the Governor argues the Commissionâ€™s â€œpreliminary reports and other\r\n  working papers remain confidentialâ€ even if the respondent has waived his right\r\n  to confidentiality under section 8-13-320(10)(g).Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAlthough\r\n  regulations authorized by the Legislature generally have the force of law, a\r\n  regulation may not alter or add to the terms of a statute.Â  Gaffney Ledger\r\n    v. S.C. Ethics Commâ€™n, 360 S.C. 107, 600 S.E.2d 540&nbsp;(2004); Goodman\r\n      v. City of Columbia, 318 S.C. 488, 458 S.E.2d 531&nbsp;(1995); Banks v.\r\n        Batesburg Hauling Co., 202 S.C. 273, 24 S.E.2d 496 (1943); see also Society of Profâ€™l Journalists v. Sexton, 283 S.C. 563, 567, 324 S.E.2d\r\n  313, 315&nbsp;(1984) (â€œAlthough a regulation has the force of law, it must fall\r\n  when it alters or adds to a statute.â€).\r\nInitially, we find\r\n  Regulation 52-718(F) is not even implicated by this case because it addresses\r\n  what would become the public record after the final disposition of a\r\n    matter where a violation is found.Â  In contrast, the Governor is primarily\r\n  concerned with the release of investigatory materials during the ongoing\r\n  investigation stage because - according to the Governor - he will not get a\r\n  chance to present â€œhis side of the storyâ€ until probable cause is found and a\r\n  hearing is held.[8]Â \r\n  Regardless, because we find Governor Sanford has waived his right to\r\n  confidentiality, the import of Regulation 52-718(F) is irrelevant.Â  However, to the extent Regulation\r\n  52-718(F) may be construed to limit the materials covered by a respondentâ€™s waiver\r\n  which is allowed by\r\n  section 8-13-320(10)(g), it is invalid.Â  Gaffney\r\n    Ledger v. S.C. Ethics Commâ€™n, supra (a regulation may not alter the terms of a statute); Goodman\r\n      v. City of Columbia, supra (same).Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  we conclude the Governorâ€™s August 28th letter constituted a complete\r\n  waiver of his right to confidentiality under section 8-13-320(10)(g), we hasten to add that the Governorâ€™s waiver does not\r\n  reach the Commissionâ€™s work product.Â  To\r\n  permit a respondentâ€™s waiver to include the Commissionâ€™s work product and\r\n  internal investigative process would chill the Commissionâ€™s ability to\r\n  thoroughly investigate a complaint.Â  The policy reasons for maintaining the\r\n  confidentiality of the Commissionâ€™s work product (especially during the\r\n  investigative process) are self-evident and compelling.Â  Governor\r\n  Sanfordâ€™s waiver here, of course, reaches all documentation to which he is entitled.[9]Â  Otherwise, we respect the Commissionâ€™s authority in\r\n  the first instance to determine what matters and documentation are subject to\r\n  the Governorâ€™s waiver, which the\r\n  Commission can make in ruling on the Governorâ€™s pending motion for an\r\n  injunction.Â  See Brown v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 440, 581\r\n  S.E.2d 836, 838 (2003) (â€œ[T]he Court generally gives\r\n  deference to an administrative agencyâ€™s interpretation of an applicable statute\r\n  or its own regulation.â€).Â  \r\nAccordingly, to the extent the Governorâ€™s petition seeks\r\n  injunctive relief, the petition is denied. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  reasons discussed above, the relief requested by both the Governor and the\r\n  Speaker is \r\nDENIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a\r\n  separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that both petitions\r\n  should be denied for the reasons stated.Â  \r\n      \r\n\r\nI\r\n  respectfully differ, however, with the finding of fact which concludes that the\r\n  only reasonable interpretation of the Governorâ€™s letter of August 28, 2009, is\r\n  that it constitutes a complete waiver of confidentiality under S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  8-13-320(10)(g).Â  Though the letter of August 28 certainly constitutes a\r\n  waiver, I am not persuaded that the evidence before us demonstrates that the\r\n  Governor knew that he was waiving all confidentiality.Â  See Eason\r\n    v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 682 S.E.2d 804 (2009) (waiver\r\n  requires a party to have known of a right and known he was abandoning that\r\n  right); Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC v. Mallon, 381 S.C.\r\n  417, 433, 673 S.E.2d 448, 456 (2009) (waiver is the voluntary and intentional\r\n  abandonment or relinquishment of a known right by a party that knew of its\r\n  rights, or of all the material facts upon which they depend).Â  To the contrary,\r\n  I conclude that the letter of August 28, 2009, though grandiose and\r\n  poorly-articulated, is clearly the end-product of negotiations between the\r\n  Governorâ€™s counsel and the executive director of the Ethics Commission.Â  In\r\n  making this finding, I have considered Mr. Haydenâ€™s letters of August 18 and\r\n  27, 2009; the Governorâ€™s counselâ€™s letter of August 24, 2009; the Governorâ€™s\r\n  affidavit filed herein; and, of course, the Governorâ€™s letter of August 28,\r\n  2009.Â  \r\n      \r\n\r\nI\r\n  would have allowed the Ethics Commission to determine in the first instance the\r\n  meaning and scope of the August 28, 2009, letter in the proceeding referenced\r\n  by the majority.Â  That avenue is now foreclosed.Â  To the extent that the\r\n  majority may suggest that a waiver submitted pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-13-320(10)(g)\r\n  cannot be limited, I would find that the Governorâ€™s attempt at doing that which\r\n  cannot be done, constitutes a nullity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Moreover, we note the Governor also issued a press release on August 28th which stated in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tIn the continued spirit of a fair\r\n  and transparent process, I am today announcing that Iâ€™ll be waiving\r\n  confidentiality as the Ethics Commission studies some of the allegations made\r\n  in the press and by political detractors.Â  Our administration has nothing to\r\n  hide.Â  We would welcome the public to scrutinize our record, just as the Ethics\r\n  Commission will do.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.scgovernor.com/news/releases/8-28-2009.htm.\r\n[2] The motion for an injunction requested that the Commission enjoin itself,\r\n  including all commissioners and staff members, from disseminating any\r\n  investigative reports, recommendations, pre-hearing reports, or any other\r\n  written or oral materials or information regarding this matter that may be\r\n  created by any person associated with the Commission.Â  The motion is nearly\r\n  identical to the petition for a writ of mandamus filed in this Court.\r\n[3] Article XV, Section 1 provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe House of Representatives alone\r\n  shall have the power of impeachment in cases of serious crimes or serious\r\n  misconduct in office by officials elected on a statewide basis, state judges,\r\n  and such other state officers as may be designated by law.Â  The affirmative\r\n  vote of two-thirds of all members elected shall be required for an\r\n  impeachment.Â  Any officer impeached shall thereby be suspended from office\r\n  until judgment in the case shall have been pronounced, and the office shall be\r\n  filled during the trial in such manner as may be provided by law.\r\n\r\n[4] We note that with regard to turning over evidence to the Attorney General, the\r\n  Ethics Act provides it is within the â€œdiscretionâ€ of the Commission whether to\r\n  do so.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-13-320(h).Â  Discretionary authority, however, is\r\n  insufficient for mandamus.Â  See Redmond v. Lexington County Sch.\r\n    Dist. No. 4, 314 S.C. at 438, 445 S.E.2d at 445&nbsp;(a writ of mandamus is inappropriate for a discretionary authority).Â  To the extent the Speaker argues S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 52-718(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2008) - which permits the Commission to release information â€œto another\r\n  prosecuting authorityâ€ - creates an imperative duty appropriate for\r\n  mandamus, we disagree.\r\n[5] As previously discussed, this Court has the power to issue a writ or order of injunction.Â \r\n  S.C. Const. Art. V, Â§ 5; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-310.\r\n[6] A prohibitory injunction is defined as an injunction â€œthat forbids or restrains\r\n  an act.â€Â  Blacks Law DictionaryÂ Â  855 (9th ed. 2009).\r\n[7] Governor Sanfordâ€™s press release of the same day confirms this reading.Â  See fn.1, supra.\r\n[8] We note the plain language of the statute refutes the\r\n  Governorâ€™s contention.Â  See Â§ 8-13-320(10)(h)\r\n  (â€œThe commission must afford a public official â€¦ who is the subject of a\r\n  complaint the opportunity to be heard on the alleged violation under oath, the\r\n  opportunity to offer information, and the appropriate due process rights,\r\n  including, but not limited to, the right of counsel.â€).Â  Counsel for the\r\n  Commission confirmed at oral argument that the Governor has been allowed to\r\n  offer information during the investigatory process, and has availed himself of\r\n  that opportunity.\r\n[9] It is our opinion the waiver would not apply to the work product of the\r\n  Commission, including mental impressions, generated during the internal\r\n  investigative process.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26738","title":"In the Matter of Former Newberry County Associate Probate Judge Rebecca A.

When confronted by agents from the\r\n  South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (SLED), respondent confessed and\r\n  accepted responsibility for her actions.Â  \r\nOn April 28, 2008, respondent was\r\n  arrested and charged with embezzlement of public funds over $1,000.00.Â \r\n  Respondent entered Pre-Trial Intervention (PTI) and, as a condition of PTI,\r\n  made full restitution.Â  Respondent has successfully completed PTI and her\r\n  criminal record has been expunged.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy her misconduct, respondent admits she\r\n  has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501,\r\n  SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold the integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A\r\n  (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high\r\n  standards of conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the\r\n  integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the\r\n    appearance of impropriety in all of the judgeâ€™s activities); and Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and\r\n      shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the\r\n      integrity and impartiality of the judiciary). Â Respondent also admits she has violated Rule\r\n        7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of\r\n        Judicial Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge\r\n        to violate the Oath of Office) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary\r\n        Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  Respondent shall not apply for, seek, or\r\n  accept any judicial position whatsoever in this State without the prior express\r\n  written authorization of this Court after due service\r\n  on ODC of any petition seeking the Courtâ€™s authorization.Â  Respondent is\r\n  hereby reprimanded for her misconduct.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent no longer holds judicial office.Â  A public\r\n  reprimand is the most severe sanction the Court can impose when a judge no\r\n  longer holds judicial office.Â  See In re Oâ€™Kelley, 361 S.C. 30,\r\n  603 S.E.2d 410 (2004); In re Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924\r\n  (1996). \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26739","title":"Representative Harold Mitchell v.

Senate. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Because Harold\r\n  Mitchell's (Petitioner) petition presents an issue of great public interest, we exercise our authority to review this matter in\r\n  our original jurisdiction.Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 5;\r\n  Rule 245, SCACR; Key v. Currie, 305 S.C. 115, 116, 406 S.E.2d 356, 357\r\n  (1991).Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nFollowing the\r\n  November 2008 elections, the Spartanburg County Legislative Delegation\r\n  (Respondent) consisted of thirteen members from the House and Senate.[1]Â \r\n  On November 10, 2008, Respondent met and elected Rep. Lanny Littlejohn to serve\r\n  as its Chairman by a vote of nine to four and Rep. Keith Kelly to serve as\r\n  Vice-Chairman by a vote of eight to five. Â Subsequent to that meeting, Sen. Lee\r\n  Bright sought an opinion from South Carolina Senate legal counsel regarding the\r\n  procedure Respondent used in selecting officers.Â  That inquiry resulted in a\r\n  letter written to Sen. Bright by Senate staff members John Hazzard and Michael\r\n  Hitchcock that concluded Vander Linden v. Hodges, 193 F.3d 268 (4th Cir.\r\n  1999) requires weighted voting in selecting delegation officers.Â  In response,\r\n  Rep. Keith Kelly sought an opinion from House counsel on the issue.Â  House\r\n  counsel concluded that selection of delegation officers is a matter of internal\r\n  administrative procedure and does not constitute the sort of governmental\r\n  action requiring weighted voting as contemplated by Vander Linden.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  members of the delegation split into two factions over whether the officers of\r\n  the delegation should be elected by a simple majority of the delegation or by\r\n  weighted vote according to the number of constituents in each member's\r\n  district.Â  The result of this split was that each group held its own meetings\r\n  as the county delegation. \r\nPetitioner\r\n  filed a petition on April 4, 2009 seeking the original jurisdiction of this\r\n  Court to resolve this dispute.Â  Subsequent to the filing of the petition to\r\n  this Court, Respondent held a meeting on May 4, 2009.Â  At that meeting, a\r\n  compromise was reached and a vote held whereby the following officers were\r\n  selected: Rep. Lanny Littlejohn as Chairman and Sen. Shane Martin as\r\n  Vice-Chairman.Â  No information was given to the Court about the compromise\r\n  election until briefs were filed in this matter.Â  This Court issued an Order\r\n  dated June 11, 2009 accepting the petition, directing the Petitioner to submit\r\n  a brief, and dispensing with formal requirements of a transcript of record\r\n  given the circumstances of this particular matter.Â Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nIs\r\n  the election of officers to a legislative delegation in South Carolina a\r\n  procedural matter such that a simple majority vote is appropriate or a\r\n  substantive matter such that a weighted vote is required?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues the election of officers to a legislative delegation is a procedural\r\n  matter such that the simple majority method is appropriate.Â  We agree.\r\nIn Vander\r\n  Linden, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the Equal Protection Clauseâ€™s one\r\n  person, one vote requirement applied to South Carolina's legislative\r\n  delegations.Â  Vander Linden, 193 F.3d at 281. Â The Fourth Circuit did\r\n  not dictate a remedy, but remanded the case in order to permit the South\r\n  Carolina legislature to correct the constitutional defect.Â  Id.\r\nIn determining that\r\n  the one person, one vote rule applied to the election of legislative delegations\r\n  the Fourth Circuit stated, &quot;Focusing on whether the delegations exercise\r\n  governmental functions seems to us entirely appropriate.&quot;[2]Â  Id. at 275.Â  &quot;Surely it is fair to infer . . . that the one person,\r\n  one vote rule does not apply to the election of officials who do not 'perform\r\n  governmental functions.'&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis in original). \r\nRespondent admits\r\n  that the offices of Chairman and Vice-Chairman are ceremonial, pro forma positions.Â  Furthermore, the Chairman and Vice-Chairman: (a) cannot take any\r\n  action on behalf of the delegation save for calling a meeting to order and certain\r\n  other procedural matters, (b) cannot independently exercise any of the substantive\r\n  functions of the delegation except by virtue of their roles as voting members,\r\n  and (c) are not accorded greater weight when voting by virtue of their positions\r\n  as delegation officers.Â  Thus, these officers do not perform substantive duties\r\n  and perform no governmental functions that raise the concerns at issue in Vander\r\n    Linden.Â  Therefore, Vander Linden's weighted voting remedy does not\r\n  apply to the election of Chairman and Vice-Chairman, and these offices can be\r\n  elected by a simple majority vote of the delegation.Â Â \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  aforementioned reasons, we find that a simple majority vote is the appropriate\r\n  method of electing county legislative delegation officers.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The delegation was comprised of Representatives Rita Allison, Mike Anthony,\r\n  Derham Cole, Jr., Mike Forrester, Keith Kelly, Lanny Littlejohn, Joey Millwood,\r\n  Harold Mitchell, and Steve Parker; Senators Lee Bright, Shane Martin, Harvey\r\n  Peeler, and Glenn Reese.Â  \r\n[2] The governmental functions of the legislative delegation at issue in Vander\r\n  Linden included: (a) making and/or recommending appointments to boards and\r\n  commissions; (b) approving and/or recommending the expenditure of money\r\n  allocated by the South Carolina General Assembly for highways, parks,\r\n  recreation, tourism, and other matters; (c) approving the budgets of local\r\n  school districts; (d) initiating referenda regarding the budgetary powers and\r\n  the election of governing bodies for a special purpose in public service\r\n  districts; (e) approving the reimbursement of expenses for county planning commissioners;\r\n  (f) approving county planning commission contracts with architects, engineers,\r\n  and other consultants; (g) altering or dividing school districts of counties;\r\n  (h) reducing existing special school levies in counties and school districts;\r\n  and (i) submitting grant applications for planning, development, and renovating\r\n  park and recreation facilities.Â  Vander Linden, 193 F.3d at 271.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26740","title":"In the Matter of Kenneth L.

Mitchum, pro se, of Georgetown.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the\r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any sanction provided\r\n  by Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely\r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set\r\n  forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nI.\r\nRespondent represented\r\n  Complainant A in a civil action.Â  Â Â Respondent failed to keep Complainant A reasonably\r\n  informed regarding the status of the case and failed to diligently pursue the\r\n  case.Â Â  In addition, respondent signed a Stipulation of Dismissal in the case\r\n  without Complainant Aâ€™s knowledge or consent and failed to inform Complainant A\r\n  that he had signed the Stipulation of Dismissal.Â  \r\nII.\r\nRespondent represented a\r\n  client in a civil action.Â  Respondent failed to diligently pursue the case.Â \r\n  During the representation, respondent was placed on definite suspension for\r\n  nine (9) months and an attorney was appointed to protect the interests of\r\n  respondentâ€™s clients (ATP).Â  In the Matter of Mitchum, 378 S.C. 597, 663\r\n  S.E.2d 482 (2008).Â  \r\nOn or about September 26,\r\n  2008, respondent delivered a check to the ATP in the amount of $19,480.00 made\r\n  payable to the client and requested the ATP deliver the check to the client.Â \r\n  The $19,480.00 check tendered to the client was not the result of any actual\r\n  settlement in the clientâ€™s case.Â  Instead, by tendering the check to the client,\r\n  respondent was attempting to provide financial assistance to the client in\r\n  connection with pending or contemplated litigation.Â Â  \r\nIII.\r\nRespondent was retained to\r\n  represent Complainant B in a civil action against a defendant.Â  Respondent was\r\n  served with the defendantâ€™s Interrogatories and Request for Documents; he failed\r\n  to timely respond to either document.Â  Respondent was served with a Notice of\r\n  Motion and a Motion to Compel, but failed to respond to the Motion to Compel.Â \r\n  Based on respondentâ€™s failure to respond to the Interrogatories, the Request\r\n  for Documents, or the Motion to Compel, Complainant Bâ€™s case was dismissed with\r\n  prejudice.

Emory Smith, Jr., both of Columbia, for Office of\r\n          Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Oliver W. Johnson, III, of Columbia, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This disciplinary matter arises out of numerous\r\n  charges filed against Respondent Oliver W. Johnson, III.Â  Following a hearing,\r\n  the Commission on Lawyer Conduct Panel (Panel) recommended that Respondent be\r\n  disbarred.Â  We agree and disbar Respondent effective the date of this opinion.Â  \r\nI.\r\nOn September 21, 2000, the\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed formal charges alleging Respondent\r\n  failed to properly maintain his trust account, misappropriated a portion of a\r\n  $700,000 settlement fund, incurred numerous tax liens and orders related to his\r\n  child support arrearages, failed to represent clients diligently and\r\n  communicate with them, failed to pay a court reporter, an expert witness, and a\r\n  final fee dispute award, and failed to cooperate with ODCâ€™s investigation.Â \r\n  Subsequently, ODC filed supplemental charges relating to a matter in which\r\n  estate settlement funds were transferred to Respondent to be used for\r\n  litigation purposes, but he failed to properly deliver the funds.Â  Respondent\r\n  filed a response to the initial formal charges, but failed to respond to the\r\n  supplemental charges.Â  \r\nOn August 24, 2005, ODC filed\r\n  second supplemental formal charges against Respondent.Â  ODC made further\r\n  allegations regarding the $700,000 settlement fund referenced above,[1] and additionally, alleged Respondent failed to properly disburse funds from a\r\n  conservatorship account, failed to pay an expert witness, and pled guilty to\r\n  assault and battery and willful tax avoidance.Â  Respondent failed to respond to\r\n  these charges.\r\nII.\r\nIn November 2006, the Court\r\n  placed Respondent on incapacity inactive status pursuant to Rule 28(b), RLDE,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, after he submitted a letter from his doctor stating he was\r\n  treating Respondent for bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\r\n  and he felt Respondent was incapable of testifying in a deposition.Â  Respondent\r\n  requested two specific attorneys to be appointed as counsel and as guardian ad\r\n  litem, but both attorneys declined.Â  \r\nOn June 1, 2007, a hearing\r\n  was held before the Panel on the issue of Respondentâ€™s incapacity.Â  Respondent\r\n  appeared by telephone, but after he was informed the proceeding would continue\r\n  without the appointment of counsel, he terminated the call.Â  The Panel found\r\n  that Respondent waived his right to present additional medical evidence\r\n  regarding his incapacity and that the letter from his doctor simply stating Respondent\r\n  could not testify was insufficient to show he was unable to assist in his own\r\n  defense.Â  Therefore, the Panel ordered ODC to schedule a final hearing on the\r\n  merits.\r\nDespite receiving notice of\r\n  the merits hearing, Respondent failed to appear.Â  ODC presented testimony from\r\n  four witnesses[2] as well as substantial evidence showing Respondent failed to properly maintain\r\n  his trust, escrow, and operating accounts.Â  The Panel recommended that\r\n  Respondent be disbarred.\r\nRespondent is currently\r\n  incarcerated as a result of federal mortgage fraud charges, which are unrelated\r\n  to this disciplinary matter.Â  After receiving notice that oral arguments before\r\n  this Court were scheduled, Respondent sought a continuance due to his mental\r\n  and physical incapacity and requested that the Court appoint counsel.Â  We\r\n  denied this request.Â  This matter has been pending since 2000.Â  ODC has\r\n  afforded Respondent more than sufficient time to seek counsel as well as\r\n  numerous opportunities to submit any medical records showing he is unable to\r\n  assist in his own defense.Â  Respondent has repeatedly failed to show any\r\n  good-faith or genuine effort in asserting his rights or cooperating with ODC.Â \r\n  Accordingly, this matter need not be further delayed.\r\nIII.\r\nThis Court has\r\n  the sole authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the appropriate\r\n  sanction after a thorough review of the record.Â  In re Thompson,\r\n  343 S.C. 1, 10-11, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  We â€œmay\r\n  accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part the findings, conclusions and\r\n  recommendations of the [Panel].â€Â  Rule 27(e)(2), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Â \r\nRespondent has engaged in a\r\n  pattern of egregious financial misconduct by misappropriating client funds and\r\n  failing to properly maintain his accounts.Â  This Court â€œhas never regarded financial misconduct lightly, particularly when such\r\n  misconduct concerns expenditure of client funds or other improper use of trust\r\n  funds.â€Â  Matter of McMillan, 327 S.C. 98, 104, 490 S.E.2d 1, 3-4\r\n  (1997).Â  In addition to numerous\r\n  incidents of financial misconduct, Respondent has neglected client matters,\r\n  pled guilty to tax evasion and assault and battery, failed to pay a court\r\n  reporter and expert witness, and failed to cooperate with ODC.Â  Respondentâ€™s\r\n  disciplinary history includes a private reprimand in 1995 and a public\r\n  reprimand in 1998.Â  Matter of Johnson, 329 S.C. 363, 495 S.E.2d\r\n  777 (1998)(imposing a public reprimand\r\n  where Respondent neglected legal matters in two cases and was in arrears on\r\n  child support obligations).Â  In August 1999, this Court placed Respondent on\r\n  interim suspension due to his failure to properly maintain his trust and escrow\r\n  accounts.\r\nBy his conduct, we find\r\n  Respondent has violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR: 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); 1.3 (lawyer shall\r\n  act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client);Â  1.4\r\n  (lawyer shall consult and inform client of matters); 1.5 (lawyer shall not\r\n  charge an unreasonable fee); 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of client or of\r\n  third person separately from his own property); 8.4(a),(b),(d),(e) (lawyer\r\n  shall not: violate the Rules of Professional Conduct; commit a criminal act\r\n  that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as\r\n  a lawyer; engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\r\n  misrepresentation; or engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice).Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the Panelâ€™s\r\n  recommendation that Respondent be disbarred from the practice of law.Â  This\r\n  Court has imposed disbarment in similar disciplinary matters.Â  SeeÂ  In\r\n    re Robertson, 383 S.C. 140, 678 S.E.2d 440 (2009) (finding disbarment warranted where attorney failed to disburse\r\n  settlement funds in several cases and neglected his clientsâ€™ cases);Â  In re Tullis, 375 S.C. 190, 652 S.E.2d 395 (2007) (disbarring attorney where attorney failed to adequately communicate with his clients, failed to act with\r\n  diligence and competence, misused and mismanaged trust account funds, and\r\n  failed to respond to ODCâ€™s inquiries); and In\r\n    re Trexler, 343 S.C. 608, 541 S.E.2d 822 (2001) (disbarring attorney for financial misconduct, neglecting client\r\n  matters, and convictions of breach of trust, blackmail, and conspiracy).\r\nRespondent has exhibited a\r\n  pattern of severe, grave, and intentional misconduct without regard for his\r\n  clientsâ€™ interests.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we disbar Respondent effective the date of this opinion.Â  We further order Respondent to make full\r\n  restitution to all injured parties who have incurred losses as a result of his\r\n  misconduct and order him to pay the costs of these proceedings. Within fifteen\r\n  (15) days of the date of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with\r\n  the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR, and shall surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law\r\n  to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Specifically, ODC alleged that the clientâ€™s signature\r\n  on the settlement statement was forged and Respondent either knew or should\r\n  have known of the forgery.\r\n[2]The four witnesses included: the lawyer who worked\r\n  with Respondent in the estate settlement matter; the court reporter Respondent\r\n  failed to pay; the solicitor who prosecuted Respondentâ€™s client and witnessed\r\n  Respondentâ€™s neglect of his client; and the client involved in the $700,000\r\n  settlement fund.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26743","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\n          Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia, and Solicitor\r\n          Warren B. Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER:Â  Appellant, Quincy Jovan\r\n  Allen, pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, one count of assault and battery\r\n  with intent to kill (ABIK), one count of arson in the second degree, two counts\r\n  of arson in the third degree, and one count of pointing and presenting a\r\n  firearm.Â  After a sentencing hearing conducted by the trial judge, [1] Allen was sentenced to death for the murders,\r\n  twenty years for ABIK, twenty-five years for arson in the second degree, ten\r\n  years for each count of third degree arson, and five years for pointing and\r\n  presenting a firearm.Â  He appeals the trial courtâ€™s imposition of a death sentence.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately\r\n  3:00 a.m. on July 7, 2002, Quincy Allen approached a homeless man, fifty-one\r\n  year old James White, who was lying on a swinging bench in Finlay Park in\r\n  downtown Columbia.Â  Allen ordered White to stand up, and proceeded to shoot him\r\n  in the shoulder.Â  When White fell back to the bench, Allen ordered him to stand\r\n  up and shot him again.Â  According to Allenâ€™s subsequent statement to police, he\r\n  had just gotten the shot-gun and he used White as a practice victim because he\r\n  did not know how to shoot the gun.Â  White survived the assault. Â \r\nA few days later, on\r\n  July 10, 2002, Allen met a prostitute named Dale Hall on Two Notch Road in\r\n  Columbia; he took her to an isolated dead end cul-de-sac near I-77 where he shot\r\n  her three times with a 12 gauge shotgun, placing the shotgun in her mouth as\r\n  she pleaded for her life.Â  After shooting her, Allen left to purchase a can of\r\n  gasoline, and came back to douse Hallâ€™s body and set her on fire.Â  He then went\r\n  back to work at his job at the Texas Roadhouse Grill restaurant on Two Notch\r\n  Road.Â  \r\nSeveral weeks\r\n  later, on August 8, 2002, while working at the restaurant, Allen got into an\r\n  argument with two sisters, Taneal and Tiffany Todd; he threatened Tiffany, who\r\n  was then 12 weeks pregnant, that he was going to slap her so hard her baby\r\n  would have a mark on it.Â  Tiffanyâ€™s boyfriend Brian Marquis came to the\r\n  restaurant, accompanied by his friend Jedediah Harr.Â  After a confrontation,\r\n  Allen fired his shotgun into Harrâ€™s car, attempting to shoot Marquis; however,\r\n  Allen missed Marquis and instead hit Harr in the right side of the head.Â  As the\r\n  car rolled downhill, Marquis jumped out and ran into a nearby convenience\r\n  store, where he was hidden in the cooler by an employee.Â  Allen left the\r\n  convenience store, and went and set fire to the front porch of Marquisâ€™ home.Â \r\n  A few hours later Allen set fire to the car of Sarah Barnes, another Texas\r\n  Roadhouse employee.Â  Harr died of the shotgun blast to his head.Â  \r\nThe following day,\r\n  Allen set fire to the car of another man, Don Bundrick, whom he apparently did\r\n  not know.Â  Later that evening, August 9, 2002, Allen went to a strip club,\r\n  Platinum Plus, in Columbia, where he pointed his shotgun at a patron.Â  Allen\r\n  left South Carolina and proceeded to New York City.Â  On his way back, while in\r\n  North Carolina, Allen shot and killed two men at a convenience store in Surrey\r\n  County.[2]Â \r\n  Allen then went to Texas, where he was apprehended by law enforcement on August\r\n  14th.Â  \r\nAllen gave\r\n  statements to police outlining the details of his crimes.Â  He told police he\r\n  began killing people because an inmate in federal prison, where Allen spent\r\n  time for stealing a vehicle, had told him he could get him a job as a mafia hit\r\n  man.Â  Allen got tired of waiting and embarked on his own killing spree.Â  Allen\r\n  told police he would have killed more people if he had had a handgun, but his\r\n  prior record prohibited him from obtaining a handgun.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the sentencing court commit\r\n  reversible error in commenting on the deterrent effect a sentence of death\r\n  might have on abusive mothers?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    Did the sentencing court commit\r\n  reversible error in failing to designate a finding of a specific statutory\r\n  aggravating circumstance?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the sentencing court err in\r\n  failing to find S.C. Code Ann. 16-3-20(b) unconstitutional as violating the\r\n  Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â DETERRENT EFFECT COMMENTS\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At his guilty plea,\r\n  Allen admitted to the facts as recited by the solicitor, essentially those set\r\n  out above.Â  At sentencing, the state was required to establish its aggravating\r\n  circumstances, and Allen put up a case in mitigation of punishment.Â  At the\r\n  conclusion of the sentencing hearing, Judge Cooper stated:\r\n\r\n  In considering\r\n    the outcome of this sentencing hearing I have tried to understand the unique\r\n    forces and events which have put Mr. Allen in the situation in which he finds\r\n    himself today.Â  I have considered his upbringing so masterfully chronicled by\r\n    Deborah Grey.[3]Â \r\n    Iâ€™ve considered his list of mental illnesses. . . \r\n    Iâ€™ve\r\n    considered the facts of the various murders that Mr. Allen does not deny.Â  Iâ€™ve\r\n    considered the impact to James White, to Dale Hallâ€™s family and to the Harr\r\n    family.Â  Iâ€™ve also considered the effect of this trial on Quincy Allenâ€™s two\r\n    younger brothers who have sat through the majority of this trial.Â Â  And I have\r\n    considered the passionate arguments of counsel on both sides of this case. . .\r\n    . \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  trial court gave a lengthy discourse as to the reasons he felt a death sentence\r\n  was warranted under the circumstances of this case.Â  In concluding the death\r\n  sentence was appropriate, the judge stated:\r\n\r\n  So I\r\n    come to the consideration of the factors which should control a death penalty\r\n    sentence: retribution and deterrence.Â  Retribution in a sense is the easiest.Â \r\n    Considering the fear Mr. Allen struck into the heart of James White and the\r\n    subsequent shooting of James White for practice, I find retribution\r\n    appropriate.Â  \r\n    Considering\r\n    the fear Mr. Allen struck into the heart of Dale Hall, the absolute depravity\r\n    of her murder, and the subsequent burning of her body, I find retribution\r\n    appropriate.\r\n    Considering\r\n    the callous killing of Jedediah Harr and the subsequent stalking of Brian\r\n    Marquis for the purpose of killing him, I find retribution appropriate.\r\n    And how\r\n    could Quincy Allenâ€™s death serve as a deterrent to others, to the abused and\r\n    neglected young people of this community?Â  Maybe it will make some young man or\r\n    some young girl stop and think about the results of destructive behavior.\r\n    Hopefully,\r\n    hopefully, it will make some young mother, single or otherwise, think about the\r\n    love and care that children need, no matter how tough the circumstances, and\r\n    would deter that mother from making the same horrible choices made with Quincy\r\n    Allen.Â  I would hope that this sentence has at least that deterrent effect, but we may never know.\r\n    I find\r\n    that, pursuant to Section 16-3-20 of the [S.C. Code], the death penalty is\r\n    warranted under the evidence in this case, and is not the result of passion,\r\n    prejudice or any other factor.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied). Â Allen now\r\n  contends the highlighted language above demonstrates that the trial court\r\n  imposed a sentence of death to serve as a deterrent to abusive parents and\r\n  constitutes an arbitrary factor in violation of the Eighth Amendment.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIt is clear from\r\n  reading the entirety of the trial courtâ€™s sentencing order, along with the\r\n  written sentencing report, that the death sentence was based upon the\r\n  characteristics of Allen and the circumstances of the crime, such that the\r\n  penalty is warranted; accordingly, we find no reversible error.\r\nEvidence in the\r\n  sentencing phase of a capital trial must be relevant to the character of the\r\n  defendant or the circumstances of the crime.Â  State v. Copeland, 278\r\n  S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982).Â  A death sentence resulting from passion,\r\n  prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor constitutes an Eighth Amendment\r\n  violation.Â Â  U.S. Const. Amend. 8.Â  See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)\r\n  (1) (requiring a death sentence be free from the influence of any arbitrary\r\n  factor); Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 51 L.Ed.2d 393\r\n  (1977); Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, (1980).Â  \r\nThe justifications\r\n  supporting imposition of the death penalty are retribution and deterrence.Â  See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 183 (1976).Â  With respect to deterrence,\r\n  i.e., the interest in preventing capital crimes by prospective offenders, â€œit\r\n  seems likely that â€˜capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when murder\r\n  is the result of premeditation and deliberation.â€Â Â  Enmund v. Florida,\r\n  458 U.S. 782, 799 (1982).Â  Although evidence concerning the effectiveness and\r\n  propriety of capital punishment as an instrument of deterrence is irrelevant\r\n  and should not be admitted, State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E.2d 619\r\n  (1984), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1265, 104 S.Ct. 3560, 82 L.Ed.2d 862\r\n  (1984), general deterrence arguments are admissible in the penalty phase of a\r\n  capital trial and do not inject an arbitrary factor into the juryâ€™s\r\n  consideration.Â  State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 577 S.E.2d 438 (2003); State\r\n    v. Shafer, 340 S.C. 291, 531 S.E.2d 524 (2000), overruled on other\r\n      grounds 532 U.S. 36(2001). \r\nWe do not find the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s imposition of the death sentence in this case to be the result of\r\n  any arbitrary factor.Â  In reading the entirety of the courtâ€™s colloquy, it is clear\r\n  that the sentence was premised primarily on retribution to this particular\r\n  defendant, and the fact that the murders were deliberate, premeditated and\r\n  cruel.Â  The trial court commented on the way Allen put a shotgun to Dale Hallâ€™s\r\n  mouth and pulled the trigger, then went to the gas station, bought gas, and\r\n  went back and burned her body.Â  He commented on the fact that Allen changed the\r\n  load in his shotgun to hollow point slugs to make it more destructive.Â  He\r\n  commented on the fact that it was Allenâ€™s intention to become a serial killer\r\n  in order to garner respect.Â  He commented on the fact that Allen told people he\r\n  would kill again if given the opportunity.Â  He commented on the fact that Allen\r\n  then left the state and went and committed more murders in North Carolina.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s isolated comment concerning deterrence to abusive parents, it is\r\n  patent the sentence does not rest on this ground and was not imposed due to an\r\n  arbitrary factor.Â  Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.Â  \r\n\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STATUTORY AGGRAVATING\r\n  FACTOR\r\nAt the conclusion\r\n  of the sentencing phase, the trial court stated: \r\n\r\n  After\r\n    carefully considering all relevant facts and circumstances, including the\r\n    existence of statutory aggravating circumstances as well as the claim of\r\n    mitigating circumstances, this Court finds and concludes that the defendant\r\n    shall be sentenced to death by electrocution or lethal injection as set forth\r\n    in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-530.\r\n\r\nAllen now contends the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s failure, in its oral ruling, to designate the specific aggravating\r\n    circumstances warranting imposition of the death penalty requires the\r\n  sentence to be vacated.Â  We find this contention meritless.\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s written\r\n  sentencing report sets forth the following findings of aggravating\r\n  circumstances:\r\n\r\n  Victim\r\n    Dale Hall:Â  Kidnapping, Larceny with use of a deadly weapon, Physical torture,\r\n    murder committed by person with prior conviction for murder\r\n    Victim\r\n    Jedediah Harr: Murder committed by person with prior conviction for murder,\r\n    knowingly creating a great risk of death to more than one person in a public\r\n    place by means of a weapon or device which would normally be hazardous to more\r\n    than one person.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Allenâ€™s\r\n  contention that the trial court failed to set forth specific statutory\r\n  aggravating circumstances is meritless and the sentence was imposed in\r\n  compliance with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (C).Â  State v. Chaffee, 285 S.C.\r\n  21, 328 S.E.2d 464 (1984), overruled on other grounds State v. Torrence, 317 S.C. 45, 451 S.E.2d 883 (1994) (death penalty may be imposed upon finding\r\n  at least one statutory aggravating factor).Â  \r\n\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â EIGHT AND FOURTEENTH\r\n  AMENDMENTS\r\nFinally, Allen contends\r\n  the trial court erred in failing to declare S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20[4] violates the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\r\n  by denying him the right to plead guilty while maintaining the right to have a\r\n  jury determine his sentence.Â  He contends the issue he raises is\r\n  distinguishable from the Sixth Amendment claims repeatedly rejected by\r\n  this Court.Â  State v. Crisp, 362 S.C. 412, 608 S.E.2d 429 (2005); State\r\n    v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 604 S.E.2d 377 (2004); State v. Wood, 362 S.C.\r\n  135, 607 S.E.2d 57 (2004).Â Â  Essentially, he claims the effect of\r\n  denying him a jury at the sentencing phase deprives him of the opportunity to\r\n  present mitigating evidence (i.e., that he accepts his guilt) to a jury of his\r\n  peers, and therefore violates due process under the Fourteenth Amendment,\r\n  resulting in cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.[5]Â \r\n  Â We find no constitutional violation.\r\nThis Court has\r\n  found, in capital cases in which the defendant pleads guilty, that statutorily\r\n  mandated sentencing by the trial judge does not violate the United States\r\n  Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002).[6]Â  Downs, 361 S.C. at 146-147, 604 S.E.2d at 380.Â  Subsequent to Downs,\r\n  the defendant in Crisp attempted to distinguish Downs contending\r\n  that, unlike Downs, Crisp sought a life sentence and exhibited remorse for his\r\n  crimes, as well as claiming that he murdered the victims in fear for his\r\n  life.Â Â  We rejected Crispâ€™s attempt to distinguish Downs, stating,\r\n  â€œ[t]he constitutionality of Section 16-3-20(B) does not rest on a\r\n    defendantâ€™s desire for a particular outcome, his sense of remorse, or his\r\n  rationale for committing a particular crime.Â  Instead, it rests, inter alia,\r\n  on whether the statute comports with the right to a jury trial as established\r\n  by this Court and the United States Supreme Court in interpreting the state and\r\n  federal constitutions.â€Â  362 S.C. at 418-419, 608 S.E.2d at 433 (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  See also State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 136, 607 S.E.2d 57 (2004). \r\nContrary to Allenâ€™s\r\n  assertion, the statuteâ€™s requirement that the trial court conduct the\r\n  sentencing does not deprive him of due process, nor does it result in cruel and\r\n  unusual punishment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C) requires that, in capital\r\n  sentencing proceedings conducted by the judge alone, the judge consider any\r\n  mitigating circumstances allowed by law and must also consider the enumerated\r\n  statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances.Â  Although Allen would\r\n  suggest otherwise, he was indeed permitted to offer evidence of his remorse,\r\n  and his acceptance of responsibility, to the trial court.Â Â  Further, the trial\r\n  court was required to receive evidence in extenuation, mitigation, and\r\n  aggravation of punishment, and was required to find the existence of statutory\r\n  aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt prior to imposing a\r\n  sentence of death.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B) &amp; (C).Â  \r\nContrary to Allenâ€™s\r\n  contention, the sentencer was not precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor,\r\n  that he accepted responsibility and showed remorse.[7]Â \r\n  Allenâ€™s Eigth and Fourteenth amendment claims are without merit.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s imposition of a death sentence was proper, and was supported by the\r\n  statutory aggravating circumstances.Â  Further, pursuant to the mandatory review\r\n  provision of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (2003), we find the sentence of death was\r\n  not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\r\n  factor, and the sentence is proportionate to sentences imposed under similar\r\n  situations.Â  State v. Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d 904 (2007) (death\r\n  sentence warranted where defendant was convicted of murder, kidnapping,\r\n  criminal sexual assault, and grand larceny); State v. Simmons, 360 S.C.\r\n  33, 599 S.E.2d 448 (2004) (death sentence upheld where jury found aggravating\r\n  factors of criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, armed robbery, physical\r\n  torture, and burglary); State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 577 S.E.2d 438\r\n  (2003) (death sentence warranted for two counts of murder, burglary and\r\n  physical torture); State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1996)\r\n  (death sentence upheld where defendant was convicted of murder, criminal sexual\r\n  conduct, armed robbery, and grand larceny of a motor vehicle); Ray v. State,\r\n  330 S.C. 184, 498 S.E.2d 640 (1998) (imposing death sentence for murder with\r\n  aggravating circumstance of kidnapping).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C. Code Ann. 16-3-20(b) requires, in a capital\r\n  trial, that â€œ[i]f trial by jury has been waived by the defendant and the State,\r\n  or if the defendant pleaded guilty, the sentencing proceeding must be conducted\r\n  before the judge.â€Â  Â Â \r\n[2] Â Allen pleaded guilty to those murders in 2004\r\n  and was sentenced to life in prison.Â  \r\n[3] Ms. Grey is a licensed clinical social worker\r\n  who performed a bio/psycho/social history and a risk assessment of his mental\r\n  illness factors for the defense.Â  \r\n[4] Â Section 16-3-20 requires that, in a capital\r\n  proceeding in which the defendant pleads guilty, the sentencing proceeding must\r\n  be conducted before the judge.Â  \r\n[5]Â  U.S. CONST. Amend VIII (excessive bail shall not\r\n  be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments\r\n  inflicted); US CONST. Amend XIV (state shall not deprive any person of life,\r\n  liberty, or property, without due process of law).\r\n[6] Â Ring held an Arizona statute which\r\n  required the trial judge to find existence of statutory aggravating\r\n  circumstances, after jury had found defendant guilty, violated the Sixth\r\n  Amendment right to a jury trial.Â  \r\n[7]Â  Moreover, we are not persuaded by Allenâ€™s claim\r\n  that, had he proceeded to trial on the issue of guilt or innocence, he would\r\n  have been unable to convey to the jury his acceptance of guilt and sense of\r\n  remorse.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26744","title":"Larry Hendricks v.

Hendricks, of Ridgeland, pro se Appellant.\r\n        Barton\r\n          Jon Vincent, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  TOAL:Â  This Court certified this case\r\n  for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR to review the Administrative Law\r\n  Court's (ALC) finding that Larry Hendricks (Appellant) was not entitled to\r\n  relief.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFacts/Procedural History\r\nAppellant, an inmate at Ridgeland\r\n  Correctional Institution, attempted to photocopy legal documents he created.[1]Â \r\n  Appellant was informed that due to a change in policy he would not be allowed\r\n  to photocopy his documents.Â  Appellant filed a Grievance Form against the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) challenging the constitutionality of\r\n  SCDC Policy GA-01.03, Inmate Access to the Courts.[2]Â \r\n  SCDC Policy GA-01.03 states: \r\n\r\n  1) Inmates\r\n    may not purchase photocopies of any materials contained in the law library\r\n    regardless of his/her ability to pay.\r\n  2) Inmates\r\n    may request photocopies of legal materials and documents to support a pleading.Â \r\n    Legal materials that may be copied to support a pleading include:\r\nDisciplinary\r\n    reports/forms;\r\n  Institutional\r\n    or State Classification Committee reports/forms and; \r\n  Letters,\r\n    forms, reports, and other documents received from SCDC or other outside\r\n    officials, that have answers or other information from personnel within SCDC\r\n    that have to do with the subject of the pleading. \r\n  3)Â  Materials\r\n    and documents that will NOT be copied include:\r\n  Drawings,\r\n    pictures, or photographs; \r\n  Documents\r\n    that have been solely originated, generated, written, typed, or created by the\r\n    inmate (the inmate may copy the information by hand);\r\n  Transcripts\r\n    of school, college or vocational training;\r\n  Magazine\r\n    or newspaper clippings (unless they specifically relate to the pleading); and\r\n  Personal\r\n    correspondence that is not related to the pleading.\r\n  4)Â Â  No\r\n    copies of blank legal forms will be made. \r\n\r\nSCDC Policy GA-01.03, Inmate\r\n  Access to the Courts.Â  \r\nIn his Grievance, Appellant\r\n  contended that &quot;[t]here is no reasonable penological reason for this\r\n  policy, accept [sic] to hinder an inmate's access to the courts.&quot;Â \r\n  Appellant argued that not being able to photocopy legal documents he generated\r\n  unconstitutionally hindered his access to the courts.Â  Appellant's Grievance\r\n  was denied by the Institutional Grievance Coordinator and the Warden.Â \r\n  Appellant then made an internal appeal, which was denied based on SCDC Policy\r\n  GA-01.03.Â  \r\nUnder the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act (APA), Appellant appealed SCDC's finding to the ALC.Â  The ALC\r\n  affirmed SCDC's decision.[3]Â \r\n  Appellant appealed the ALC finding, and pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, this\r\n  Court certified the case from the court of appeals.Â Â  \r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe APA establishes the standard\r\n  of review and the court's authority in reviewing decisions of the ALC:\r\nThe\r\n  review of the administrative law judge's order must be confined to the record.\r\n  The reviewing tribunal may affirm the decision or remand the case for further\r\n  proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights\r\n  of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or\r\n  decision is:\r\n\r\n  (a) in\r\n    violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n  (b) in\r\n    excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n  (c) made upon unlawful\r\n    procedure;\r\n  (d)\r\n    affected by other error of law;\r\n  (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n    probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n  (f)\r\n    arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n    unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2008).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAppellant argues SCDC Policy\r\n  GA-01.03 unconstitutionally hindered his meaningful access to the courts.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â Â  \r\nIn Bounds v. Smith,\r\n  430 U.S. 817&nbsp;(1977), the United States Supreme Court stated, &quot;[O]ur\r\n  decisions have consistently required States to shoulder affirmative obligations\r\n  to assure all prisoners meaningful access to the courts.&quot;Â  Bounds,\r\n  430 U.S. at 824.Â  The Court in Bounds held that &quot;the fundamental\r\n  constitutional right of access to the courts requires prison authorities to\r\n  assist inmates in the preparation and filing of meaningful legal papers by\r\n  providing prisoners with adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from\r\n  persons trained in the law.&quot;Â  Id. at 828.Â  In determining whether\r\n  meaningful access has been denied the inquiry is &quot;whether law libraries or\r\n  other forms of legal assistance are needed to give prisoners a reasonably\r\n  adequate opportunity to present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional\r\n  rights to the courts.&quot;Â  Id. at 825.Â  \r\n&quot;The requirement that an\r\n  inmate alleging a violation of Bounds must show actual injury derives\r\n  ultimately from the doctrine of standing.&quot;Â  Lewis v. Casey,&nbsp;518\r\n  U.S. 343, 349 (1996).Â  &quot;Because Bounds did not create an abstract,\r\n  freestanding right to a law library or legal assistance, an inmate cannot\r\n  establish relevant actual injury simply by establishing that his prison's law\r\n  library or legal assistance program is subpar in some theoretical sense.&quot;Â  Id. at 351.Â  &quot;Insofar as the right vindicated by Bounds is\r\n  concerned . . . the inmate therefore must go one step further and demonstrate\r\n  that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program\r\n  hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.&quot;[4]Â  Id.; see also Pellegrino v. Loen,&nbsp;743 N.W.2d 140, 144-45&nbsp;(S.D.\r\n  2007) (finding no actual injury, thus no denial of meaningful access to the\r\n  courts). \r\nIn the present case,\r\n  Appellant argues, &quot;I have, almost twice, missed deadlines because of this\r\n  and am fearful that with the amount of litigation needed in my criminal case, I\r\n  may miss a deadline because of a policy that has not [sic] logical stated\r\n  penological reason for its establishment.&quot;Â  Nowhere in the Record does\r\n  Appellant state he suffered an actual injury due to SCDC Policy GA-01.03.Â \r\n  Appellant merely claims that he might be injured in the future by missing a\r\n  deadline.Â  This falls short of the actual injury requirement demanded by Lewis.[5]Â \r\n  Because no actual injury has occurred, Appellant's meaningful access to the\r\n  courts has not been unconstitutionally hindered.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nBecause Appellant has not\r\n  suffered an actual injury, we affirm the decision of the ALC.\r\nWALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Record does not state what type of documents Appellant wanted to copy, but\r\n  Appellant did note they were for the United States Supreme Court.Â  \r\n[2] SCDC Policy GA-01.03 went into effect January 4, 2005.Â  \r\n[3] &quot;ALJs have no authority to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute or\r\n  regulation.&quot;Â  Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v. South Carolina Dept. of\r\n    Revenue,&nbsp;342 S.C. 34, 38, 535 S.E.2d 642, 644&nbsp;(2000).Â  The ALC's\r\n  Order affirming SCDC's finding did not state whether or not SCDC Policy\r\n  GA-01.03 was constitutional.Â  The ALC was correct to abstain from determining\r\n  the constitutionality of SCDC Policy GA-01.03.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[4] Lewis gave examples of what might be construed as an injury that denies\r\n  meaningful access to the courts: \r\n[A prisoner] might show, for\r\n  example, that a complaint he prepared was dismissed for failure to satisfy some\r\n  technical requirement which, because of deficiencies in the prison's legal\r\n  assistance facilities, he could not have known. Or that he had suffered\r\n  arguably actionable harm that he wished to bring before the courts, but was so\r\n  stymied by inadequacies of the law library that he was unable even to file a\r\n  complaint.\r\nLewis, 518 U.S. at 351.\r\n[5] In this case, there was no actual injury to Appellant due to SCDC Policy\r\n  GA-01.03.Â  However, we take this opportunity to caution SCDC that its policy\r\n  not allowing inmates to make photocopies when he or she is willing and able to\r\n  pay is not reasonable.Â  See Johnson v. Parke, 642 F.2d 377,\r\n  380&nbsp;(10th Cir. 1981) (&quot;[W]hen numerous copies of often lengthy\r\n  complaints or briefs are required, it is needlessly draconian to force an\r\n  inmate to hand copy such materials when a photocopying machine is available and\r\n  the inmate is able and willing to compensate the state for its use.&quot;).Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26745","title":"State v.

McIntosh, and Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tEverettÂ \r\n  Godfrey, Jr., of Godfrey Law Firm, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER: Â The State appeals a circuit court holding that a $13,000.00 bond\r\n  issued by Respondent, A-1 Bonding, was not estreated to the state.Â Â  We reverse\r\n  and remand for further proceedings.Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  November 2005, Jose Luis Lara was arrested and charged with possession with\r\n  intent to distribute (PWID) cocaine, PWID cocaine within proximity of a park, and\r\n  driving without a license, 3rd offense, in Easley.Â  He was released on a\r\n  $13,000.00 surety bond which was issued by A-1 Bonding.Â  On May 3, 2006, the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s office issued notices to Lara and A-1 to appear for trial on\r\n  Wednesday, May 17, 2006.Â  When Lara failed to appear, bench warrants for his\r\n  arrest were signed on that day.Â  The bench warrant was not filed until June 26,\r\n  2006 and was actually issued on June 28, 2006.Â Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the bench warrant for Lara was not issued until June 28, 2006, A-1 did not\r\n  become aware of his failure to appear until July 2006.[1]Â  Lara was brought to the detention\r\n  center by A-1 on August 9, 2006, forty-two days after issuance of the warrant.Â \r\n  The solicitor issued a Conditional Order to Estreat the bond due to Laraâ€™s\r\n  failure to appear, and A-1 filed an affidavit seeking to excuse the forfeiture\r\n  and remit the bond money to it.Â  \r\nThe matter was set for a hearing on June 27, 2007.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, A-1 acknowledged it was technically in default on the bond, but\r\n  requested that inasmuch as the delay was not willful, and Lara had been delivered,\r\n  the bond not be estreated to the state. Â After a hearing, the trial court ruled\r\n  the bond would not be estreated to the state.Â  The State appeals.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err in refusing the estreat the $13,000 bond to the state?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. 38-53-70 (1976) reads,[2] â€œIf a defendant fails to appear at a court proceeding to which he has been\r\n  summoned, the court may issue a bench warrant for the defendant. . . .Â  If the\r\n  surety fails to surrender the defendant . . . within thirty days of the\r\n    issuance of the bench warrant, the bond shall be forfeited.â€[3]Â  (Emphasis supplied).Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nAs\r\n  noted by Justice Toal in her dissenting opinion in State v. Boatwright,\r\n  310 S.C. 281, 423 S.E.2d 139 (1992): \r\n\r\n\tUnder South Carolina law, when the terms of the bond are breached,\r\n  the bond is estreated by a conditional order. Â S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-170\r\n  (1976); Pride v. Anders, 266 S.C. 338, 223 S.E.2d 184 (1976); State\r\n    v. Holloway, 262 S.C. 552, 206 S.E.2d 822 (1974). Â The bondsman is then\r\n  entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard to show cause as to why the\r\n  estreatment order should not become final. S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-170 (1976). Â Because\r\n    the bond has already been estreated by the conditional order, the second\r\n    hearing is to determine the amount, if any, to be remitted. \r\n\r\n310 S.C. at 286,\r\n  423 S.E.2d at 182.Â  (Emphasis supplied).\r\nThe\r\n  courts of this State are vested with discretionary power to grant relief from\r\n  bond forfeitures.Â  State v. Workman, 274 S.C. 343, 343, 263 S.E.2d 865,\r\n  866.Â  Among the factors to be considered in determining whether and to what\r\n  extent relief will be granted are (1) the purpose of the bond; (2) the nature\r\n  and willfulness of the default; (3) any prejudice or additional expense\r\n  resulting to the State.Â  Id.Â  The Court has long recognized that an\r\n  exercise of the trial courtâ€™s discretion in setting aside a bond forfeiture\r\n  will not be set aside unless there has been an abuse of discretion.Â  State\r\n    v. McClinton, supra; State v. Workman, 274 S.C. 341, 263\r\n  S.E.2d 865 (1980); Ex Parte Polk, 354 S.C. 8, 579 S.E.2d 329 (Ct. App.\r\n  2003); State v. Holloway, 262 S.C. 552, 206 S.E.2d 822 (1974); State\r\n    v. Edens, 88 S.C. 302, 70 S.E. 609 (1911).Â  An appellate court reviews the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s ruling on the forfeiture or remission of a bail bond for abuse\r\n  of discretion.Â  State v. McClinton; State v. Holloway. Â An abuse\r\n  of discretion occurs when the circuit courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of\r\n  law.Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere, the\r\n  trial court acknowledged that bond could not be forfeited until 30 days after\r\n  process, and that the time period began to run on the day the warrant was\r\n  issued (June 28, 2006), which resulted in a 42 day lapse between issuance and\r\n  the time Lara was brought in.Â  However, the trial court nonetheless held A-1\r\n  had complied with the thirty day requirement; it therefore refused to estreat\r\n  the bond to the state. Â Â This ruling amounts to an error of law. \r\nA-1\r\n  conceded Lara was not brought in within the thirty day time period.Â  As noted above,\r\n  if the surety fails to surrender a defendant . . . within thirty days of the\r\n  issuance of the bench warrant, the bond is forfeited.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-53-70.Â  Accordingly, all that remained for the Â hearing was an opportunity for\r\n  A-1 to be heard and show cause why the bond should not be forfeited and why the estreatment order should not be confirmed. Â S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-170 (1976).Â  \r\nNotwithstanding the estreatment had already occurred, the trial\r\n  court ruled A-1 had complied with the time period set forth in the statute.Â  Â Contrary\r\n  to this ruling, the sole issue for the trial courtâ€™s determination was whether\r\n  or not A-1 could demonstrate sufficient cause to remit all or part of the bond.Â \r\n  The trial court failed to conduct any inquiry in this regard.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  reverse the ruling of the trial court and remand the matter for further\r\n  proceedings consistent with this opinion.[4]\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A-1 routinely examined court documents on a\r\n  monthly basis to determine whether its clients had appeared for trial.Â  \r\n[2] This section was amended by 2008 Act No. 346, Â§\r\n  4, eff. June 25, 2008, and now allows for a ninety day period from\r\n  issuance of the bench warrant before a bond is forfeited.\r\n[3] Â A trial court may require the execution of a\r\n  bond in a specified amount to assure a defendantâ€™s appearance for trial. Â S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-10.Â  The bond is returned when the defendant fulfills the\r\n  conditions of the bond; it is conditioned on the person charged personally\r\n  appearing before the court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-15, Â§ 17-15-20.Â  â€œWhenever\r\n  the recognizance is forfeited by noncompliance with its condition, the . . .\r\n  solicitor. . . shall issue a notice to summon every party bound in the\r\n  forfeited recognizance to appear at the next ensuing court to show cause, if he\r\n  has any, why judgment should not be confirmed against him.â€Â  If no sufficient\r\n  reason is given for noncompliance with the bond conditions, judgment on the\r\n  recognizance is confirmed. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-170. Â Thereafter, upon\r\n  affidavit sufficiently stating the excuse or cause thereof, the court may remit\r\n  the whole or any part of the forfeiture as it deems reasonable.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 17-15-180.\r\n[4]Â  We also note that to the extent the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling imposes a requirement on the solicitor to notify bond companies\r\n  of the issuance of a warrant, it is in error.Â  State v. Holloway, 262 S.C. at\r\n  557, 206 S.E.2d at 824 (Court rejected bail bondsmanâ€™s contention that State\r\n  had a duty to notify him of the failure of the accused to appear, holding â€œthe\r\n  fact that appellant received no notice, each time, of the failure of the\r\n  accused to appear at the several terms of court in question did not require the\r\n  remission of the bond forfeitureâ€)\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
