Rhodes, of Burts, Turner, Rhodes &amp; Thompson, of Spartanburg, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â We granted\r\n  a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals opinion in Dawkins v.\r\n    Dawkins, Op. No. 2007-UP-460 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Oct. 11, 2007).Â  We\r\n  reverse and reinstate the judgment of the family court.\r\nThe family court ordered an\r\n  equitable division of the marital estate 60% to Alice Dawkins (Wife) and 40% to\r\n  Steve Dawkins (Husband), although the actual division was 56% - 44% due to a\r\n  mathematical calculation error.Â  On appeal, the court of appeals reversed and\r\n  held an equal division of the marital estate to be &quot;appropriate.&quot;Â  In\r\n  addition, the court of appeals awarded Husband $25,000 as a &quot;special\r\n  equity&quot; in the marital residence.Â  We have carefully reviewed the record\r\n  and applicable law and reverse the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 220, SCACR.Â  See Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005)\r\n  (division of marital property is within family court's discretion and will not\r\n  be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion).Â  \r\nI.\r\nWe address two matters for\r\n  the benefit of the bench and bar: the apparent trend at the appellate level to\r\n  find an abuse of discretion when an equitable division award in a long-term\r\n  marriage deviates from an equal division, and our view that the manner of\r\n  accounting for a spouse's &quot;special equity&quot; in marital property should\r\n  follow the approach approved in Toler v. Toler, 292 S.C. 374, 356 S.E.2d\r\n  429 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nA.\r\nHusband and Wife were married\r\n  for twenty-two years.Â  As noted, the family court attempted to divide the\r\n  marital property 60% to wife and 40% to husband, although the actual division\r\n  was 56% - 44%.Â  The court of appeals found the division to be an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  According to the court of appeals, &quot;[w]hile there is no\r\n  bright line rule, this Court suggests an equal 50% - 50% split of marital\r\n  assets as an appropriate beginning point for dividing the estate of a long-term\r\n  marriage.&quot; Â Dawkins v. Dawkins, Op. No. 2007-UP-460 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 11, 2007).Â  The court of appeals held a 50% - 50% division was\r\n  &quot;appropriate&quot; due in part to &quot;the trend in case law for an equal\r\n  apportionment of [marital] property.&quot; Id.\r\nWe take no issue with the\r\n  proposition that an equal division of marital property will often be &quot;appropriate.&quot;Â \r\n  We further agree that a 50% - 50% division would be appropriate here.Â  But that\r\n  does not make the attempted 60% - 40% division inappropriate or an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  The purpose behind case law's imprimatur of a 50% - 50% division\r\n  was to foster amicable resolutions in family court matters and provide guidance\r\n  on what would in effect be a safe harbor in most cases in the division of\r\n  marital property in a long-term marriage.Â  Yet what was intended as guidance on\r\n  an &quot;appropriate&quot; division has seemingly mutated into a mandatory\r\n  division.Â  It is well-settled that the apportionment of marital property is within the discretion\r\n  of the family court.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364\r\n  S.C. 532, 542, 615 S.E.2d 98, 103 (2005).\r\nAn appellate court should\r\n  approach an equitable division award with a presumption that the family court\r\n  acted within its broad discretion.Â  The family courtâ€™s award should be reversed\r\n  only when the appellant demonstrates an abuse of discretion.Â  The family court\r\n  here acted within its discretion in attempting to apportion the marital estate\r\n  60% - 40%.Â  Roberson\r\n    v. Roberson, 359\r\n  S.C. 384, 389, 597 S.E.2d 840, 842 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004) (recognizing that when reviewing the family court's equitable apportionment, an\r\n  appellate court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if the end result is equitable, it is\r\n  irrelevant that the appellate court might have weighed specific factors differently\r\n  than the family court).\r\nB.\r\nNext, we address the issue of\r\n  how to account for a spouse's &quot;special equity&quot; in marital property.[1]Â \r\n  Here, the parties' marital residence was a gift to Husband by his mother.Â  It\r\n  is undisputed that the home was transmuted into marital property.Â  Husband\r\n  believed the family court failed to give him proper consideration for his\r\n  contribution to the marital home.Â  The court of appeals agreed and relied on Cooksey\r\n    v. Cooksey, 280 S.C. 347, 312 S.E.2d 581 (Ct. App. 1984) in awarding\r\n  Husband a separate award of $25,000. The $25,000 special equity award would\r\n  have been in addition to Husbandâ€™s 50% share of the balance of the marital\r\n  property.\r\nÂ Cooksey preceded our equitable apportionment statute.Â  We\r\n  agree with the principle, as stated by the court of appeals, that &quot;a\r\n  transmutation of inherited nonmarital property into marital property [does] not\r\n  extinguish the inheritorâ€™s right for special consideration upon divorce.&quot; Dawkins\r\n    v. Dawkins, Op. No. 2007-UP-460 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 11, 2007). Â We,\r\n  however, overrule Cooksey to the extent it may be read to allow a family\r\n  court to separate and subtract the inheritance amount from the marital estate\r\n  and then award this &quot;special equity&quot; to the inheritor in addition to his\r\n  or her portion of the court-ordered division of the marital estate.Â  We approve\r\n  of the approach announced in Toler, decided after adoption of the\r\n  equitable apportionment statute, as the sole method in accounting for a spouse's\r\n  special equity in marital property and hold that &quot;the correct way to treat\r\n  [an] inheritance is as a contribution by [the inheriting party] to the\r\n  acquisition of marital property [and that] [t]his contribution should be taken\r\n  into account in determining the percentage of the marital estate to which [the\r\n  inheriting party] is equitably entitled upon distribution.&quot;Â  Toler,\r\n  292 S.C. at 380 n.1, 356 S.E.2d at 432 n.1.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nWe reverse the court of\r\n  appeals and reinstate the judgment of the family court.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We recognize the concept of a special equity can also refer to an interest in any increase in value of nonmarital property\r\n  resulting from the non-owner spouse's material contribution.Â  Arnal v. Arnal, 363\r\n  S.C. 268, 294, 609 S.E.2d 821, 835 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  Accounting for a spouse's contribution to a nonmarital\r\n  asset presents a different situation.Â  Our holding is limited to a family\r\n  court's consideration of a special equity in a marital asset. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26757","title":"Dickert v.

Dickert (Wife) a divorce from\r\n  Appellant/Respondent James W. Dickert (Husband).[1]Â  \r\nHusband and Wife\r\n  began dating when Wife was fourteen years old and Husband was sixteen years\r\n  old.Â  Wife skipped her senior year of high school to join Husband at Clemson\r\n  University.Â  Upon Husband's graduation from Clemson, the parties moved to\r\n  Charleston so Husband could attend dental school at the Medical University of\r\n  South Carolina (MUSC).Â  Husband and Wife were married in 1974 when Husband was\r\n  twenty-three and a student at MUSC, and wife was twenty-one and working as a\r\n  teacher.\r\nWhile Husband was\r\n  attending dental school, Wife was the sole breadwinner through her job as a\r\n  teacher.Â  When Husband finished dental school, the parties moved to Greenville\r\n  where Husband opened a dental practice and worked at the county health\r\n  department.Â  Wife continued to teach while Husband established his dental\r\n  practice.Â  Upon moving to Greenville, the parties lived in an apartment.Â  They then\r\n  moved into a new house, where they lived for three years.Â Â Â  \r\nWife continued to\r\n  work until the birth of their first child in 1981.Â  After the birth of their\r\n  first child, Wife became a stay-at-home mother and primary caretaker of the\r\n  children, and Husband was the primary breadwinner.Â  Wife has not worked outside\r\n  the home since 1981.Â  Wife's primary roles were to maintain the home, maintain\r\n  household finances, and support Husband in his dental practice.\r\n In 1984, Wife\r\n  became pregnant with their second child, and the parties purchased a new house\r\n  in Sugar Creek, an upper-middle-class subdivision in Greenville.Â  The two sons\r\n  grew up in this approximately 3,000 square foot home.Â  While living in Sugar\r\n  Creek, Husband's dental practice continued to grow and Wife continued as a\r\n  stay-at-home mother.Â  Husband was solely responsible for all of the income of\r\n  the family while the parties shared child-rearing responsibilities.Â  While\r\n  living at Sugar Creek, Husband paid for a maid to assist Wife with some of the\r\n  household chores.Â  Wife continued to have a maid throughout the marriage.Â \r\n  Throughout the marriage the parties engaged in social activities associated\r\n  with the children's athletics and with their membership at Thornblade Country\r\n  Club, including golf, tennis, and swimming.Â  \r\nIn 2001, the\r\n  parties decided to build their dream home in the Thornblade Country Club\r\n  subdivision.Â  The parties worked together to design a 7,000 square foot home in\r\n  the Thornblade community.Â  The parties invested approximately $900,000 in the\r\n  home and moved into the Thornblade residence in May 2002.Â  Within three months\r\n  of moving into the Thornblade residence, Husband became involved in an\r\n  adulterous relationship with Sandy Brockman (Brockman).Â  Husband met Brockman\r\n  on a golf trip to Hilton Head.Â  Husband continued to see Brockman and informed\r\n  Wife of his adulterous relationship in July of 2003.[2]Â \r\n  Husband informed Wife he was unhappy and wanted a divorce so he could pursue a\r\n  relationship with Brockman.Â  Husband left the marital home in August 2003 and\r\n  never returned.Â  Husband commenced this marital dissolution action on October\r\n  30, 2003.Â Â Â  \r\nHusband's\r\n  income at the time of trial was approximately $360,000 per year.Â  Wife remained\r\n  unemployed.Â  Instead of seeking employment, Wife spent a significant amount of\r\n  time playing tennis at the Thornblade Country Club.Â  The marital estate of the\r\n  parties was valued at approximately $2,000,000.Â  The trial court awarded Wife\r\n  forty-five percent of the marital estate and Husband fifty-five percent.Â  The\r\n  trial court awarded permanent periodic alimony to Wife in the amount of $8,600\r\n  per month.Â  The trial court also ordered Husband to pay $99,000 in attorney's\r\n  fees and costs.Â Â  \r\nISSUES\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did\r\n  the family court err by including the goodwill of Husband's dental practice in\r\n  calculating the marital estate?\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did\r\n  the family court err in apportioning forty-five percent of the marital estate\r\n  to Wife?\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did\r\n  the family court err in awarding Wife $8,600 per month in permanent periodic\r\n  alimony?\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did\r\n  the family court err in awarding $99,000 to Wife in attorney's fees and\r\n  litigation expenses?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Strickland\r\n    v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 82, 650 S.E.2d 465, 469&nbsp;(2007) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;This broad scope of review does not require the reviewing\r\n  court to disregard the findings of the family court; appellate courts should be\r\n  mindful that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, sits in a\r\n  better position to evaluate credibility and assign comparative weight to the\r\n  testimony.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Goodwill\r\n  Included in Marital Estate\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in determining the value of his dental practice\r\n  by including goodwill in the amount of $256,519 to arrive at a value of\r\n  $360,000 subject to equitable distribution.Â  We agree.Â Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court has defined &quot;goodwill&quot; in general: \r\n\r\n  Goodwill\r\n    may be properly enough described to be the advantage or benefit which is\r\n    acquired by an establishment beyond the mere value of the capital, stock,\r\n    funds, or property employed therein, in consequence of the general public\r\n    patronage and encouragement which it receives from constant or habitual\r\n    customers, on account of its local position or common celebrity, or reputation\r\n    for skill or affluence, or punctuality, or from other accidental circumstances\r\n    or necessities, or even from ancient partialities or prejudices.\r\n\r\nDonahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 359, 384 S.E.2d 741, 745&nbsp;(1989) (quoting Levy v. Levy, 164 N.J.\r\n  Super. 542, 549, 397 A.2d 374, 377 (1978)).Â  This Court has defined\r\n  &quot;professional goodwill&quot; as having the following attributes:\r\n\r\n  It\r\n    attaches to the person of the professional man or woman as a result of\r\n    confidence in his or her skill and ability. (cite omitted) It does not possess\r\n    value or constitute an asset separate and apart from the professional's person,\r\n    or from his individual ability to practice his profession. It would be\r\n    extinguished in the event of the professional's death, retirement or\r\n    disablement. (cite omitted)\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Rathmell v. Morrison, 732 S.W.2d 6,\r\n  17 (Tex. App. 1987)).Â  \r\n&quot;'The\r\n  very nature of a professional practice is that it is totally dependent upon the\r\n  professional.'&quot;Â  Id. at 360, 384 S.E.2d at 745 (quoting Powell\r\n    v. Powell, 648 P.2d 218, 223 (Kan. 1982)).Â  &quot;The definitions set forth\r\n  above indicate the intangible nature of the goodwill asset . . . [and] [i]t is\r\n  this intangibility which inevitably results in a speculative valuation.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  This Court in Donahue held the family court erred in placing a value\r\n  upon the goodwill of the husband's professional dental practice and attempting\r\n  to equitably divide it. Id.; see also Casey v. Casey,\r\n  293 S.C. 503, 505, 362 S.E.2d 6, 7&nbsp;(1987) (holding that goodwill in\r\n  Husband's fireworks business does not constitute marital property subject to\r\n  equitable distribution); Keane v. Lowcountry Pediatrics, 372 S.C. 136,\r\n  146, 641 S.E.2d 53, 59 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding that professional goodwill has\r\n  no value that exists separate and apart from the professional).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the family court assigned the value of $360,000 to Husband's dental\r\n  practice for purposes of equitable apportionment.Â  In arriving at this number\r\n  the family court included $256,517 in what it termed &quot;enterprise goodwill.&quot;Â \r\n  Wife wants this Court to follow other jurisdictions that subject\r\n  &quot;enterprise goodwill&quot; to equitable apportionment.Â  However, because\r\n  of the intangible nature of the goodwill asset, &quot;enterprise goodwill&quot;\r\n  in a professional practice is not subject to equitable distribution. Â Thus, the\r\n  family court erred in including this &quot;enterprise goodwill&quot; in the\r\n  amount of $256,517 in marital property to be equitably apportioned.Â  \r\nII. Equitable\r\n  Distribution\r\nThe\r\n  family court awarded fifty-five percent of the marital estate to Husband and\r\n  forty-five percent of the marital estate to Wife.Â  Because we reverse the family\r\n  court's decision on &quot;enterprise goodwill,&quot; we reverse and remand the\r\n  family court's decision regarding equitable distribution.Â  This will allow the\r\n  family court to determine if a change in the marital apportionment should be\r\n  made in light of the goodwill valuation change.Â  This issue is to be tried on\r\n  the record as it exists now.Â  No more evidence is to be taken on remand to the\r\n  family court.Â  Â \r\nIII. Alimony\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the trial court abused its discretion in awarding $8,600 per month in permanent\r\n  periodic alimony to Wife.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n&quot;An\r\n  award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will\r\n  not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Allen v. Allen,\r\n  347 S.C. 177, 183-84, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  Alimony is a substitute for the support that is normally incident to\r\n  the marital relationship.Â  Spence v. Spence,&nbsp;260 S.C. 526, 529, 197\r\n  S.E.2d 683, 684&nbsp;(1973).Â  &quot;Generally, alimony should place the\r\n  supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the same position he or she\r\n  enjoyed during the marriage.&quot;Â  Allen, 347 S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d\r\n  at 424 (citation omitted).Â  &quot;It is the duty of the family court to make an\r\n  alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just if the claim is well\r\n  founded.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  &quot;Alimony should not\r\n  dissuade a spouse, to the extent possible, from becoming self-supporting.&quot;Â  Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 525, 605 S.E.2d 572, 574 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (citation omitted).Â  Section 20-3-130(C) lists the factors the family court\r\n  judge must consider in deciding whether to award alimony or separate\r\n  maintenance and support.[3]Â  Hatfield v. Hatfield,&nbsp;327 S.C. 360, 364, 489 S.E.2d 212,\r\n  215&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  No one factor is dispositive.Â  Allen,&nbsp;347\r\n  S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 425 (citation omitted).Â  \r\nHusband\r\n  concedes the family court considered all of the factors, but contends it abused\r\n  its discretion in analyzing the factors.Â  Husband's main contention is that the\r\n  award of $8,600 a month allows wife to enjoy a standard of living better than\r\n  the marital standard.Â  Husband points to several factors to show that during\r\n  the majority of the marriage the couple did not live an extravagant lifestyle:\r\n  for approximately twenty years of marriage the couple lived in the Sugar Creek\r\n  subdivision; they did not move into Thornblade until May 2002; they did not\r\n  drive luxury automobiles; and the wife even admitted that the standard of\r\n  living she enjoyed in the Thornblade house was not the standard of living she enjoyed\r\n  during the course of marriage.Â  \r\nHusband's\r\n  expert determined that Wife would need $4,669 per month to enjoy the standard\r\n  of living obtained during the marriage without imputed earnings.Â  The court\r\n  imputed earnings of $1,167 per month to Wife leaving her alimony need at $3,502\r\n  per month according to Husband.Â  Wife contends the family court did not award\r\n  her enough alimony.Â  She argues she deserves $10,290 per month to maintain the\r\n  marital standard of living.Â  The family court found Husband's expert to be\r\n  generally correct in his analysis of Wife's alimony needs.Â  The family court\r\n  also noted Wife's expert calculated her needs based on her expenditures for\r\n  only 2002 and 2003.Â  Because the family court found Husband's expert was\r\n  generally correct concerning Wife's alimony needs and Wife's expert only\r\n  considered two years in determining alimony, we find an award of $8,600 per\r\n  month of permanent periodic alimony was an abuse of discretion.Â  Moreover, we\r\n  hold that an award of $7,000 per month in permanent periodic alimony will place\r\n  Wife, as nearly as practical, in the same position she enjoyed during the\r\n  marriage.\r\nIV. Attorney's\r\n  Fees\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding $99,000 in attorney's fees to Wife.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court may order one party to pay a reasonable amount to the other party\r\n  for attorney's fees and costs incurred in maintaining an action for divorce\r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-130(H) (Supp. 2008).Â  Whether to award attorney's fees is a matter within\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 633-34,\r\n  576 S.E.2d 156, 167 (2003).Â  In determining whether to award attorney's fees,\r\n  the following factors should be considered: (1) the party's ability to pay his or her own attorney's fee;\r\n    (2) the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3)\r\n  the parties' respective financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the\r\n  attorney's fee on each party's standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M.,\r\n  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816&nbsp;(1992).Â  When the family court\r\n  finds an attorney's fee is justified, the amount of the fee should be\r\n  determined by considering: (1) the\r\n    nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to\r\n    the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of\r\n    compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees\r\n  for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403\r\n  S.E.2d 313, 315&nbsp;(1991).\r\nThe\r\n  family court addressed the four factors used to determine whether an award of\r\n  attorney's fees is appropriate and correctly determined an award of attorney's\r\n  fees was appropriate.Â  The family court also addressed the six Glasscock factors in awarding attorney's fees.Â  We hold that the family court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in awarding $99,000 in attorney's fees to Wife in a case\r\n  presenting complex issues that required a great deal of time and energy to\r\n  assess. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFirst, the family court erred by including the\r\n  $256,517 in &quot;enterprise goodwill&quot; in the amount to be equitably\r\n  apportioned.Â  Second, because we reverse the family court's decision on\r\n  &quot;enterprise goodwill,&quot; we reverse and remand the family court's\r\n  decision regarding equitable distribution.Â  Third, we reverse the family\r\n  court's alimony award and find that $7,000 per month in permanent periodic\r\n  alimony will place Wife, as nearly as practical, in the same position she\r\n  enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Lastly, we affirm the family court's decision to\r\n  award Wife $99,000 in attorney's fees.Â  Â Â Â \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Both parties are appealing issues derived from the Amended Final Order filed\r\n  September 17, 2007.\r\n[2] Wife was granted an absolute divorce from Husband on the statutory ground of\r\n  Husband's adultery.\r\n[3] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2008) states:\r\n\r\n  (C) In\r\n    making an award of alimony or separate maintenance and support, the court must\r\n    consider and give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate to all of\r\n    the following factors: \r\n    (1) the\r\n    duration of the marriage together with the ages of the parties at the time of\r\n    the marriage and at the time of the divorce or separate maintenance action\r\n    between the parties; \r\n    (2) the\r\n    physical and emotional condition of each spouse; \r\n    (3) the\r\n    educational background of each spouse, together with need of each spouse for\r\n    additional training or education in order to achieve that spouseâ€™s income\r\n    potential; \r\n    (4) the\r\n    employment history and earning potential of each spouse; \r\n    (5) the\r\n    standard of living established during the marriage; \r\n    (6) the current and reasonably anticipated earnings of\r\n    both spouses; \r\n    (7) the current and reasonably anticipated expenses\r\n    and needs of both spouses; \r\n    (8) the marital and nonmarital properties of the\r\n    parties, including those apportioned to him or her in the divorce or separate\r\n    maintenance action; \r\n    (9) custody of the children, particularly where\r\n    conditions or circumstances render it appropriate that the custodian not be\r\n    required to seek employment outside the home, or where the employment must be\r\n    of a limited nature; \r\n    (10) marital misconduct or fault of either or both\r\n    parties, whether or not used as a basis for a divorce or separate maintenance\r\n    decree if the misconduct affects or has affected the economic circumstances of\r\n    the parties, or contributed to the breakup of the marriage, except that no\r\n    evidence of personal conduct which may otherwise be relevant and material for\r\n    the purpose of this subsection may be considered with regard to this subsection\r\n    if the conduct took place subsequent to the happening of the earliest of (a)\r\n    the formal signing of a written property or marital settlement agreement or (b)\r\n    entry of a permanent order of separate maintenance and support or of a\r\n    permanent order approving a property or marital settlement agreement between\r\n    the parties; \r\n    (11) the tax consequences to each party as a result of\r\n    the particular form of support awarded; \r\n    (12) the existence and extent of any support\r\n    obligation from a prior marriage or for any other reason of either party;Â  and \r\n  (13) such other factors the court considers relevant. \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26758","title":"Edwards v.

Frawley, of Nicholson, Davis, Frawley, Anderson &amp; Ayer, of Lexington,\r\n          for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: Â Appellant Teresa Edwards, a domestic violence victim, sued the\r\n  Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Department and the County of Lexington\r\n  (collectively, Respondents)[1] after she was attacked by her ex-boyfriend, Allen\r\n  Baker, in a magistrateâ€™s court bond revocation hearing where no security was\r\n  provided.Â  The bond revocation hearing was scheduled at the request of an\r\n  employee of the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Department\r\n  who was aware of Bakerâ€™s multiple bond violations and his continuing threats\r\n  against Edwards.Â  The trial court ruled Respondents owed no duty to Edwards and granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary\r\n  judgment.Â  Because we conclude Respondents owed a common law duty to Edwards, we reverse and remand.Â  Â Â \r\nI. \r\nTeresa Edwards and Allen\r\n  Baker were dating in February 2003 when the Lexington\r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Department (the sheriffâ€™s office) responded to a\r\n  domestic violence call at Edwardsâ€™ home.[2] Â Baker was arrested for criminal\r\n  domestic violence.Â  Baker was released on a personal recognizance bond and\r\n  ordered not to contact Edwards. \r\nOn\r\n  April 25, 26, and 27, Edwards called the sheriffâ€™s office to report that Baker\r\n  was threatening her and her children.Â  On April 28, the sheriffâ€™s office\r\n  arranged for Edwards and her daughters to stay in a hotel for protection and\r\n  obtained a warrant to be issued against Baker.Â  On April 29, Edwards returned\r\n  home.Â  That night, Baker went to Edwardsâ€™ home and was arrested for violating the no-contact\r\n  order.Â  As a result of violating his bond, Baker was sentenced to thirty days\r\n  in jail.Â  Subsequently, Baker posted a $5,000 surety bond and was released.\r\nNicole\r\n  Howland is a domestic violence prosecutor employed by the sheriffâ€™s office.Â \r\n  Howland contacted Edwards in order to begin prosecuting Baker for the February\r\n  incident.Â  Edwards informed Howland that Baker was continuing to contact and harass\r\n  her.Â  Howland instructed Edwards to document any further contact as evidence\r\n  that Baker was still acting in violation of the no-contact order.\r\nHowland\r\n  then contacted a Lexington County magistrate to request a bond revocation\r\n  hearing.Â  The magistrate agreed to schedule a hearing and contacted Bakerâ€™s\r\n  bondsman on August 4, 2003.Â  The magistrate instructed the bondsman to have\r\n  Baker appear in court two days later, August 6.Â  Howland informed Edwards of\r\n  the August 6 hearing and told her to be present and to bring the evidence of\r\n  Bakerâ€™s continuing harassment.Â  Edwards told Howland that she feared Baker and\r\n  was reluctant to attend, but Howland insisted she attend so the evidence could\r\n  be admitted to prove Baker's violation of the no-contact order.Â  \r\nThe August\r\n  6 bond revocation hearing was held in the magistrateâ€™s office, which was\r\n  temporarily located in a small two-room building.Â  The magistrate was seated at\r\n  the head of the room behind a desk.Â  Edwards was seated behind a desk on the\r\n  left side of the room, facing the magistrate.Â  Howland was seated to the right\r\n  of Edwards.Â  Baker was seated to the right of Howland, behind another desk.Â  No\r\n  one from the sheriffâ€™s office or the County took any steps to ensure security\r\n  for the bond revocation hearing, and as a result, no officer was present and no\r\n  other precautionary or security measures were employed.\r\nAfter\r\n  Howland presented evidence that Baker had violated the no-contact order and\r\n  Baker had responded, the magistrate found Baker in contempt, revoked his bond,\r\n  and sentenced him to thirty days in jail.Â  As the magistrate was writing the\r\n  sentence, Baker rose from his chair, struck Howland at least two times, and\r\n  then pinned Edwards against the wall and struck her on the head at least three\r\n  times.Â  The bondsman eventually restrained Baker, and the magistrate sprayed\r\n  Baker with pepper spray.Â  A staff member called 911.Â  Baker was arrested and Edwards\r\n  was taken to the hospital and treated for her injuries.Â  \r\nEdwards\r\n  filed a negligence action pursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act\r\n  alleging Respondentsâ€™ gross negligence proximately caused her injury.Â  In their\r\n  answer, Respondents argued they owed no duty specific to Edwards under the\r\n  public duty rule, contended Edwardsâ€™ injury was caused by her own negligence,\r\n  and asserted several exceptions to the waiver of immunity as provided in the\r\n  Tort Claims Act.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment on the sole basis\r\n  that Respondents owed no duty to Edwards under statutory law or common law.Â  We\r\n  certified Edwardsâ€™ appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nII.Â  \r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and\r\n  it is clear the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, an appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard used by the\r\n  trial court. Â Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue\r\n    Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002).Â  In\r\n  this case, summary\r\n  judgment was granted on the basis of the absence of a duty, which is a question\r\n  of law for the court to determine.Â  See Doe v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 375 S.C. 63, 72, 651 S.E.2d 305, 309 (2007) (recognizing that whether a duty exists is a question of law for the courts).Â  We are thus presented\r\n  with a legal question concerning the presence or absence of a duty under the\r\n  circumstances presented.\r\nIII.\r\nEstablishing a\r\n  Duty\r\nAn\r\n  essential element in a cause of action based upon negligence is the existence\r\n  of a legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.Â  Doe, 375 S.C. at 72, 651 S.E.2d at 309.Â  Without a duty, there is no actionable\r\n  negligence.Â  Id.Â  A plaintiff alleging negligence on the part of a\r\n  governmental actor or entity may rely either upon a duty created by statute or\r\n  one founded on the common law.Â  Arthurs ex\r\n    rel. Estate of Munn v. Aiken County, 346 S.C. 97,\r\n  104, 551 S.E.2d 579, 582 (2001).Â  When the duty is created\r\n  by statute, we refer to this as a â€œspecial duty,â€ whereas when the duty is\r\n  founded on the common law, we refer to this as a legal duty arising from\r\n  â€œspecial circumstances.â€Â  See id. at 109-10, 551 S.E.2d at 585 (explaining\r\n  that this Court restricts the term special duty to those arising from statutes,\r\n  whereas a legal duty arising from a â€œspecial circumstanceâ€ is created under the\r\n  common law).Â Â  \r\nThere is no general duty to control the conduct of another or to\r\n  warn a third person or potential victim of danger.Â  Faile v. S.C. Dept. of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 334, 566 S.E.2d 536, 546 (2002).Â  However, there are five exceptions to\r\n  this rule: 1) where the defendant has a special relationship to the victim; 2) where the defendant has a special relationship to the\r\n  injurer; 3) where the defendant voluntarily undertakes a\r\n  duty; 4) where the defendant negligently or\r\n  intentionally creates the risk; and 5) where a statute imposes\r\n  a duty on the defendant.Â  Id.\r\n1. Statutory Duty\r\nEdwards\r\n  first argues provisions of the\r\n  Criminal Domestic Violence Act (CDV Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-10 et seq.\r\n  (2008), in conjunction with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1525(G) (2008),[3] impose a special duty on Respondents.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn Parker v. Brown, 195\r\n  S.C. 35, 10 S.E.2d 625 (1940), we adopted the â€œpublic\r\n  duty rule.â€Â  Under this rule, statutes which create or define the\r\n  duties of a public office create no duty of care towards\r\n  individual members of the general public.Â  Arthurs, 346 S.C. at 105-06, 551 S.E.2d at 583.Â  South Carolina has followed the public duty rule since 1940, and this rule remains the law of South Carolina today.Â  However, we have carved out a narrow exception to the rule and found a\r\n  statute imposes a special duty on a governmental entity if the following\r\n  six-part test is met:Â  \r\n\r\n  (1)\r\n    an essential purpose of the statute is to protect against a particular kind of\r\n    harm; (2) the statute, either directly or indirectly, imposes on a specific\r\n    public officer a duty to guard against or not cause that harm; (3) the class of\r\n    persons the statute intends to protect is identifiable before the fact; (4) the\r\n    plaintiff is a person within the protected class; (5) the public officer knows\r\n    or has reason to know the likelihood of harm to members of\r\n    the class if he fails to do his duty; and (6) the officer is given sufficient\r\n    authority to act in the circumstances or he undertakes to act in the exercise\r\n    of his office.\r\n\r\nJensen v. Anderson County\r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 304\r\n  S.C. 195, 200, 403 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1991).Â  â€œThe public duty rule is\r\n  a rule of statutory construction which aids the court in determining whether\r\n  the legislature intended to create a private right of action for a statuteâ€™s\r\n  breach.â€Â  Vaughan v. Town of Lyman, 370\r\n  S.C. 436, 442, 635 S.E.2d 631, 634 (2006) (recognizing\r\n  that the dispositive issue is not whether the statute creates a duty, but\r\n  rather whether the statute\r\n  was intended to provide an individual a private right of action).Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nEdwards\r\n  cites to provisions of the CDV Act making it unlawful to injure a household\r\n  member, but she points to no provision of the CDV Act imposing a specific duty\r\n  on Respondents that they failed to perform.Â  In short, even if the CDV Act\r\n  could be the source of a special duty imposed upon law enforcement, Edwards has\r\n  not alleged a breach of duty created by the Act.Â  \r\nEdwardsâ€™\r\n  further reliance on Â§ 16-3-1525(G) in no manner bolsters her position.Â  Section\r\n  16-3-1525(G) is merely a general statute that broadly recites the general duty\r\n  of law enforcement agencies with regard to protecting victims and witnesses and\r\n  clearly fails the six-part test.Â  See Arthurs, 346 S.C. at 108, 551\r\n  S.E.2d at 584 (holding a statute requiring the sheriffâ€™s department to patrol\r\n  the county merely broadly recited general duties and did not create a special\r\n  duty).Â  Moreover, the Legislature has spoken directly to its intent to\r\n  foreclose a private cause of action under Â§ 16-3-1525(G), for Â§ 16-3-1565 states\r\n  no provision in this article â€œcreates a cause of action on behalf of a person\r\n  against a public employee, public agency, the State, or an agency responsible for the\r\n  enforcement of rights and provision of services set forth in this article.â€\r\n2. Special\r\n  Relationship with Edwards\r\nEdwards argues she had a special relationship with Respondents\r\n  because she was in the â€œfunctional custodyâ€ of the State, and therefore,\r\n  Respondents owed her a specific duty.Â  There are no allegations and there is no\r\n  evidence in the record indicating that Edwards was in custody.Â  Â Accordingly,\r\n  we hold Respondents owed no duty of protection to Edwards under her â€œfunctional\r\n  custodyâ€ theory.Â \r\n\r\n3. Creating the Risk and\r\n  Respondentsâ€™ Relationship with Baker\r\nEdwardsâ€™\r\n  final contention, with which we agree, is that Respondents owed her a common\r\n  law duty because of the â€œspecial circumstancesâ€ presented. Arthurs, 346 S.C. at 108, 551 S.E.2d at 584\r\n  (recognizing that a duty may arise because of â€œspecial circumstancesâ€).Â  The\r\n  special circumstances are Respondentsâ€™ relationship with Baker and their\r\n  actions in creating the risk of harm.\r\nRespondents\r\n  were well aware of Baker's unrelenting violent tendencies toward Edwards.Â  Edwards\r\n  had called the sheriffâ€™s office to report Bakerâ€™s harassment on numerous\r\n  occasions, and the sheriffâ€™s office arranged for Edwards to stay in a hotel\r\n  after one of the incidents.Â  The sheriffâ€™s office and the County, through its\r\n  agent Howland,[4] arranged the bond\r\n  revocation hearing at the magistrateâ€™s office with no security present.Â \r\n  Despite Respondentsâ€™ awareness that Edwards feared Baker and was reluctant to\r\n  attend the bond revocation, Respondents strongly encouraged Edwardsâ€™ presence.\r\nRespondents\r\n  cannot claim lack of knowledge of Bakerâ€™s violent tendencies towards Edwards\r\n  since the reason they were seeking to revoke Bakerâ€™s bond was due to his\r\n  failure to obey the no-contact order, which was issued as a direct result of\r\n  his violent actions.Â  We hold Respondents created a situation in which it was foreseeable\r\n  that Baker would harm Edwards.Â  Compare Miletic\r\n    v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 339 S.C. 327, 529 S.E.2d 68 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding Wal-Mart had no duty to protect a customer from a\r\n  parking lot attack because Wal-Mart had no notice that the crime would occur).\r\nWe hold that Respondents owed Edwards a duty solely as a result of\r\n  the unique facts of this case, i.e., â€œspecial circumstances.â€ Â Respondents\r\n  created a situation that they knew or should have known posed a substantial\r\n  risk of injury to Edwards.Â  Moreover, given Respondents'\r\n  knowledge of Bakerâ€™s demonstrated threats against Edwards, Respondents owed her\r\n  a duty.Â  Respondentsâ€™\r\n  duty is one of due care and whether Respondents acted reasonably, negligently\r\n  or grossly negligently is not before us.Â  We do note that Respondents were not\r\n  under a duty to guarantee Edwardsâ€™ safety with absolute certainty.Â  See\r\n    Madison ex rel. Bryant v.

Nettles, 308 S.C. 109, 112, 417 S.E.2d 523, 524 (1992); Heath\r\n      v. Aiken County,\r\n  295 S.C. 416, 418, 368 S.E.2d 904, 905 (1988).Â \r\n  Although Respondentsâ€™ assertion is inconsistent with settled law, their\r\n  position that they are the same entity is the law of the case.Â  We therefore do\r\n  not address the legally settled distinction between a county government and a\r\n  sheriffâ€™s office for liability purposes.Â  \r\n[2] The facts are\r\n  taken from the partiesâ€™ â€œStipulation of Factsâ€ presented in the trial court.\r\n[3] Specifically, Edwards\r\n  refers to Â§ 16-25-20, which makes it unlawful to injure a\r\n  household member and Â§ 16-25-80, which provides that this article\r\n  does not replace other criminal offenses.Â  Section 16-3-1525(G) provides\r\n  that a law enforcement agency â€œmust provide any measures necessary to protect\r\n  the victims and witnesses, including . . . physical protection in the\r\n  courthouse.â€\r\n[4] Respondents\r\n  stipulated that Howland was employed by the sheriffâ€™s office.Â  Because of\r\n  Howlandâ€™s status as a sheriffâ€™s office employee, the sheriffâ€™s office is\r\n  charged with Howlandâ€™s knowledge and actions (or lack of action), and as a\r\n  result of Respondentsâ€™ position that the sheriffâ€™s office and Lexington County\r\n  are the same entity, such knowledge is imputed to Lexington County.\r\n[5] Respondents argue\r\n  even if we were to find the existence of a duty, Edwards cannot show the\r\n  remaining elements of her negligence claim.Â  The trial court granted summary\r\n  judgment based solely on the absence of a duty.Â  Therefore, under this\r\n  procedural posture, the record does not permit us to make those fact-driven\r\n  determinations.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26759","title":"State v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Respondent was convicted\r\n  of homicide by child abuse in the suffocation death of his almost two year old\r\n  son and received a twenty year sentence.Â  On appeal, the Court of Appeals\r\n  reversed, holding â€œthe trial court erred in admitting [respondentâ€™s] voluntary\r\n  oral statement and the second and third written statements.â€Â  State v. Navy,\r\n  370 S.C. 398, 635 S.E.2d 549 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition\r\n  for certiorari, and now affirm the decision to the extent it holds the second\r\n  and third written statements are inadmissible under Missouri v.\r\n    Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004), but reverse the holding that the first oral\r\n  statement was erroneously admitted.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt\r\n  approximately 4 pm on Sunday, February 9, 2003, EMS responded to a 911 call\r\n  placed from a residence.Â  When they arrived, respondent was administering CPR\r\n  to his son.Â  The child had no heartbeat or respiration, and attempts to\r\n  resuscitate him in the ambulance and at the hospital were unsuccessful.Â  The\r\n  child was pronounced dead at 4:58 pm.\r\nAn autopsy was\r\n  performed on Monday.Â  The doctor testified there was no medical reason for the\r\n  child to die, and opined that the death was the result of suffocation.Â  He also\r\n  found that the child had four older healing rib fractures in his back,\r\n  fractures which had occurred at different times.\r\nRespondent gave a\r\n  statement at the hospital on Sunday night, but because he was so upset and\r\n  distraught it was thought to be incomplete.Â  On Wednesday morning, Sgt. Weeks\r\n  and Investigator Smith went to respondentâ€™s residence with the intent of taking\r\n  him from the home to the sheriffâ€™s office to interview him and obtain another\r\n  statement.Â  The decision to talk with respondent was prompted by a meeting with\r\n  the autopsy doctor the day before who told the officers that the only way the\r\n  child could have died was by smothering or suffocation. \r\nWhen the officers\r\n  arrived at the home, they told respondent they needed to ask some additional\r\n  questions.Â  Respondent was very cooperative, stating he wanted answers too, but\r\n  he was upset and crying at the home and remained upset and crying throughout\r\n  the entire time period from the time the officers arrived at the home\r\n  (approximately 9 am) until they obtained the third statement (1 pm).Â  The\r\n  officers knew that the childâ€™s funeral home visitation was scheduled for later\r\n  that Wednesday, and told respondent and his family that they would have\r\n  respondent back in time for the service. \r\nRespondentâ€™s first\r\n  statement was given at the station at 9:50 am.Â  In this oral statement,\r\n  respondent maintained that he was watching TV on the first floor while the two\r\n  younger children (the victim and a four year old daughter) napped upstairs.Â  He\r\n  told the officers:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1) \r\n\t\t\tThe victim awoke crying as if from a nightmare;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2)\r\n\t\t\tRespondent comforted him, putting him back in the \r\n\t\t\tcrib, and patting him on his back;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3)\r\n\t\t\tRespondent went downstairs to get a bottle: upon \r\n\t\t\treturning upstairs he noticed the child was having breathing \r\n\t\t\tproblems;[1]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4) \r\n\t\t\tRespondent â€œpanickedâ€ and went up and down stairs \r\n\t\t\tseveral times until he â€œfigured outâ€ what was going on and returned \r\n\t\t\tupstairs bringing with him his friend Terry who was visiting;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5) \r\n\t\t\tHe picked the â€œlifelessâ€ child up, and told Terry \r\n\t\t\tto take the other child downstairs and keep her from seeing what was \r\n\t\t\tgoing on;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6) \r\n\t\t\tRespondent took the lifeless child downstairs, put \r\n\t\t\thim on the floor, and performed CPR three times[2] before calling 911;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t7) \r\n\t\t\tRespondent continued CPR until EMS arrived.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThis statement is largely\r\n  consistent with the statement respondent gave at the hospital after the child\r\n  died.\r\nAt\r\n  the Sheriffâ€™s Department respondent was given cigarettes and permitted to take\r\n  escorted smoking breaks.Â Â  The investigator testified respondent was not in\r\n  custody or under arrest, and agreed that respondent was free to tell the\r\n  officers to take him home anytime he wanted.Â  \r\nAfter he gave this\r\n  first statement, the crying and upset respondent was informed, for the first\r\n  time, that the child had been suffocated and that there was evidence of broken\r\n  ribs.Â  According to Investigator Smith, respondent was shocked and surprised by\r\n  this information.Â  Respondent asked if he were under arrest, and was told â€œNo,\r\n  we are just trying to get some answers.â€ Â Â The officers engaged in follow-up\r\n  questioning, asking specifically how respondent had comforted the crying child.Â \r\n  At this juncture, the nature of the interrogation and respondentâ€™s status\r\n  changed, and what had begun as a voluntary question and answer session matured\r\n  into custodial interrogation.Â  Â In response to these follow-up\r\n  questions, respondent told the officers he had â€œpoppedâ€ the child on the back\r\n  rather than simply patted him, and that he may have â€œpattedâ€ the child on its\r\n  mouth to stop the crying.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter eliciting the\r\n  answers in which respondent admitting hitting the child and interfering with\r\n  the childâ€™s breathing, the officers allowed him another smoke break.Â \r\n  Investigator Smith insisted at trial that respondent was still free to leave,\r\n  but also testified that he â€œperceived that the line of questioning may move\r\n  further into what he had just told us.â€Â  Smith decided it was now appropriate\r\n  to give respondent Miranda warnings and administered them to respondent\r\n  at 11:35 am. \r\nFollowing\r\n  the Miranda warnings, respondent gave his second statement, this one in\r\n  writing, at 11:40 am.Â  Significantly, in this second statement, respondent\r\n  described the events as â€œthe same as in his first statement,â€ except that:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1)\r\n\t\t\tHe could not get the child to be quiet, and while \r\n\t\t\tthe crying child was sitting up in the crib, respondent put his hand \r\n\t\t\tover the childâ€™s mouth, but did not hold it there.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2) \r\n\t\t\tRespondent then laid the child on his stomach in \r\n\t\t\tthe crib and â€œpoppedâ€ him in the middle of the back, causing the \r\n\t\t\tchild to cry â€œone time real loud.â€&nbsp; Respondent then put his \r\n\t\t\thand over the childâ€™s mouth again to try to stop the crying, then \r\n\t\t\tnoticed the child could not get his breath, perhaps as the result of \r\n\t\t\tthe pop on the back.|\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3)&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tRespondent, thinking he had knocked the childâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tbreath out, went downstairs and returned with a bottle.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4) \r\n\t\t\tThe child was still â€œmaking that noiseâ€ â€œlike he \r\n\t\t\twas still trying to catch his breathâ€ and respondent panicked.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tAs the child quit and then resumed breathing, respondent went \r\n\t\t\tdownstairs and got Terry.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5)\r\n\t\t\tWhen respondent and Terry got back upstairs, the \r\n\t\t\tchild was not breathing.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6) \r\n\t\t\tIn response to the question: â€œWhen you placed your \r\n\t\t\thand over [the childâ€™s] mouth, is it possible that your hand covered \r\n\t\t\this nose area as well,â€ respondent answered â€œIt could have been.â€\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tWhen you popped him in the back, did you have your fist balled up?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tNo sir.&nbsp; It was my flat hand.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tHow hard did you pop him?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tNot like trying to kill him or nothing.Â  I just popped him.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tWhy did you pop [him] in the back Sunday?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tI was frustrated because he was crying.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nFollowing this second\r\n  statement, which was reduced to writing, Sgt. Weeks contacted the pathologist\r\n  who had conducted the autopsy to ask whether the actions respondent admitted\r\n  committing in his second statement â€œcould have causedâ€ the childâ€™s death.Â  The\r\n  pathologist said no, and told the officer that the hand would have had to cover\r\n  the childâ€™s nose and mouth for at least a minute.Â  The officers then obtained a\r\n  third written statement from respondent at 12:25 pm.Â  The brief questions and\r\n  answers are:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\t[Respondent], is it possible that you held your \r\n\t\t\thand over [the childâ€™s] mouth and nose for a longer period of time \r\n\t\t\tthen you first related to us that you did?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tYeah, it could have been longer.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tHow long do you think it could have been?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tI donâ€™t know.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tCan you give us any idea at all how long you might \r\n\t\t\thave held your hand over his nose and mouth?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tA minute, not more than two minutes.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ. \r\n\t\t\tWhen you removed your hand the last time was [the \r\n\t\t\tchild] breathing?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tHe was gasping for breath.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nRespondent\r\n  moved to suppress all three statements, but particularly the written second and\r\n  third statements. Â He argued that the statements were not voluntary, in that he\r\n  was distraught, sleep-deprived, and shocked by the information that his child\r\n  had been suffocated and had rib injuries.Â  Specifically, respondent argued that\r\n  the second and third statements were unconstitutionally obtained since the\r\n  officers conducted unwarned custodial interrogation after he gave the\r\n  first oral statement, obtained incriminating evidence, and only then Mirandized him and took the official second and third statements.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court admitted all three statements, finding that respondent was not in\r\n  custody, was not significantly deprived of his freedom, and that the first\r\n  statement was voluntary and no Miranda warning rights were required.Â  As\r\n  to the second and third statements, he made the finding the statements were Mirandized and freely and voluntarily given.Â  On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed,\r\n  finding none of the three statements should have been admitted.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether\r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit\r\n  respondentâ€™s three statements?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  First Statement\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals, citing State v.\r\n  Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 582 S.E.2d 407 (2003), held the first statement should\r\n  have been suppressed primarily because respondent was in custody at the time of\r\n  the statement.Â  The State contends the Court of Appeals erred in reaching this\r\n  result.Â  We agree with the State that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing\r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s ruling admitting respondentâ€™s oral statement.\r\nWhether a suspect\r\n  is in custody is determined by an examination of the totality of the\r\n  circumstances, such as the location, purpose, and length of interrogation, and\r\n  whether the suspect was free to leave the place of questioning.Â  It is an\r\n  objective determination, that is, would a reasonable person have believed he\r\n  was in custody.Â  State v. Evans, supra.Â  On appeal, the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s findings as to custody must be upheld where they are supported by the\r\n  record.Â  Id.\r\nIn our opinion, it\r\n  is debatable whether a reasonable person would have believed himself to be in\r\n  custody at the time the first statement was given, and thus the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that respondent was not in custody should have been upheld as it is\r\n  supported by the record.Â  State v. Evans, supra.Â  In light of\r\n  this, the Court of Appeals erred in finding the first statement should have\r\n  been suppressed.\r\nB.Â  Second and Third\r\n  Statements\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals held that respondentâ€™s second and third statements should have been\r\n  suppressed because they were obtained in violation of the rule announced in Missouri\r\n    v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004).[3]Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nIn Seibert,\r\n  the Court dealt with the police practice of questioning a suspect until\r\n  incriminating information is elicited, then administering Miranda warnings.Â  Following the warnings, the suspect is again questioned and the\r\n  incriminating information re-elicited. Â The post-warning statement is then\r\n  sought to be admitted.Â  The factors to be considered in determining whether a\r\n  constitutional violation occurred in this setting, according to the Seibert plurality opinion, are:\r\n\r\n\t1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the completeness and detail of the\r\n  question and answers in the first round of interrogation;\r\n\t2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the timing and setting of the\r\n  first questioning and the second;\r\n\t3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the continuity of police\r\n  personnel; and\r\n\t4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the degree to which the\r\n  interrogatorâ€™s questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.\r\n\r\nJustice\r\n  Kennedy wrote separately, stating that while he agreed with much of the\r\n  plurality opinion, he wished to emphasize that not every Miranda violation would require suppression.Â  He explained that an exception should be\r\n  made where the officer may not have realized that a suspect is in custody and\r\n  therefore a warning was required, or where the officer did not plan to question\r\n  the suspect at that juncture.Â  Justice Kennedy noted that in Seibert,\r\n  the two-step technique was used to deliberately avoid Miranda, using a\r\n  strategy based on the assumption that Miranda warnings will mean less\r\n  when given after an incriminating statement has already been made.Â  Under these\r\n  circumstances, Justice Kennedy agreed the statements must be suppressed unless\r\n  â€œcurative measuresâ€ were taken.Â  As examples of curative actions, Justice\r\n  Kennedy suggested a substantial break in time and circumstances between the\r\n  pre-warning statement and the warned, or an additional warning before\r\n  questioning resumes that the pre-warned statement is not admissible.\r\nIn our opinion, the\r\n  Court of Appeals correctly concluded the officersâ€™ actions here violated Seibert and therefore the second and third written statements must be suppressed.Â  The\r\n  officers began the questioning of respondent with knowledge that the child had\r\n  been suffocated and with the intention of eliciting a confession.Â  After respondentâ€™s\r\n  first oral statement, the officers â€œsprangâ€ the suffocation/healing rib\r\n  fractures information on respondent, and began an unwarned custodial\r\n  interrogation designed to elicit incriminating information, that is,\r\n  questioning designed to have respondent admit to having hit the child and to\r\n  having smothered him.Â  Once those incriminating answers were given - i.e. after\r\n  respondent admitted he had popped the child on the back and â€œpattedâ€ his mouth\r\n  - respondent was permitted a supervised cigarette break, then given Miranda warnings, with interrogation by the same officer resuming immediately.Â  Thus\r\n  the four elements outlined in Seibert were met here.Â  Moreover, none of\r\n  the curative measures suggested by Justice Kennedy, i.e. an additional warning\r\n  that the answers given after the first statement but before the administration\r\n  of Miranda warnings may not be admissible,[4] a substantial break in time, or change of circumstances, occurred here.\r\nThe State would\r\n  characterize the failure to initially administer warnings was merely one of\r\n  â€œgood faith,â€ relying on Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298 (1985).Â  In Elstad, the officer asked a few questions of the suspect at the\r\n  suspectâ€™s home before transporting him to the police station for questioning.Â \r\n  Here, in contrast, the officers questioned respondent at headquarters for\r\n  almost three hours before giving the warning.Â  Moreover, after the first round\r\n  of detailed questioning resulted in the first statement, respondent was\r\n  confronted with the autopsy results which stated that the cause of death was\r\n  suffocation, and that there was evidence of old bone breaks, followed by more\r\n  detailed questioning.Â  In our opinion, the Court of Appeals correctly held that\r\n  the rule in Seibert applies here to bar admission of the second and\r\n  third statements.\r\nThe State also\r\n  argues that this case differs from Seibert in that there was evidence in Seibert of a deliberate police practice, the â€œquestion firstâ€ strategy.Â \r\n  In our view, that deliberate practice was not determinative in Seibert.Â \r\n  Moreover, since Seibert had not been decided before respondentâ€™s trial,\r\n  it is not surprising that defense counsel did not specifically question\r\n  Investigator Smith whether he was using this strategy.Â  Finally, the Seibert Court acknowledged that it was unlikely that law enforcement would admit it was\r\n  using the â€œquestion firstâ€ technique, and thus evidence that officers were\r\n  following this protocol was not necessary in order for a Miranda violation to be found.Â  Seibert at footnote 6.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the Court\r\n  of Appealsâ€™ decision to the extent it held that the second and third statements\r\n  should have been suppressed, but reverse the decision holding that the first\r\n  statement was unlawfully obtained.\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nWALLER, J., and Acting Justice James R. Barber, III,\r\n  concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which KITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  concurs except for the finding that the third statement was obtained in a\r\n  non-custodial setting.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent from Part B of the majority opinion, and would\r\n  reverse the court of appeals' decision finding the second and third written\r\n  statements were inadmissible. \r\nIn Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600\r\n  (2004), the United States Supreme Court addressed the police practice of\r\n  conducting a custodial interrogation in which no Miranda warnings were\r\n  given until the interrogation produced a confession. Â Seibert,&nbsp;542\r\n  U.S. at 604.Â  The interrogating officers would follow the inadmissible\r\n  statement with Miranda warnings, and then lead the suspect over the same\r\n  ground a second time.Â  Id.Â  The Court concluded, &quot;Because this\r\n  midstream recitation of warnings after interrogation and unwarned confession\r\n  could not effectively comply with Miranda's constitutional requirement,\r\n  we hold that a statement repeated after a warning in such circumstances is\r\n  inadmissible.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The Seibert Court elaborated:\r\n\r\n\tFor unless the warnings could place a suspect who has\r\n  just been interrogated in a position to make such an informed choice, there is\r\n  no practical justification for accepting the formal warnings as compliance with \r\n\tMiranda, or for treating the second stage of interrogation as distinct\r\n  from the first, unwarned and inadmissible segment.\r\n\r\nId. at 612.Â  In describing why the Miranda warnings were ineffective in Seibert, the Court stated, &quot;[T]he\r\n  police did not advise that her prior statement could not be used.&quot;Â  Id. at 616.Â  Thus, for Seibert to apply, the first unwarned custodial\r\n  statement must be inadmissible.Â  This is in part because the Court was\r\n  concerned that the later interrogation was a mere continuation of the earlier\r\n  unwarned and inadmissible custodial interrogation.Â  See id. at 616-17.Â  \r\nIn this matter, the majority's reliance on Seibert is misplaced.Â  Seibert applies when police conduct an initial custodial\r\n  interrogation without giving Miranda warnings, elicit a confession, and\r\n  then give Miranda warnings before finally eliciting the same confession\r\n  a second time.Â  See id. at 604.Â  In such circumstances, the first\r\n  unwarned statement is inadmissible because it violates Miranda's warning\r\n  requirements.Â  See id.Â  \r\nIn the present case, I agree with the majority that\r\n  the first statement was admissible because Respondent was not in custody when\r\n  it was given.Â  Because there was no custodial interrogation regarding the first\r\n  statement, there was no need for Miranda warnings.Â  The majority states\r\n  that the interrogation status changed from noncustodial to custodial when the\r\n  police asked Respondent how he comforted the child.Â  However, merely asking\r\n  questions that result in inculpatory responses does not change a noncustodial\r\n  interrogation into a custodial interrogation.Â  If this were so, the nature of\r\n  police investigation would be forever altered.Â  There is no evidence in the\r\n  record to suggest the circumstances of questioning changed such that a\r\n  custodial interrogation resulted when the police began to elicit inculpatory\r\n  information.Â  Hence, because there was no custodial interrogation, Seibert does not apply.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe mere giving of Miranda warnings does not\r\n  convert an otherwise noncustodial situation into a custodial interrogation.Â  State\r\n    v. Doby, 273 S.C. 704, 708, 258 S.E.2d 896, 899&nbsp;(1979).Â  In this case,\r\n  the second and third statements were obtained after Miranda warnings\r\n  were given.Â  However, giving Miranda warnings did not convert the\r\n  noncustodial interrogation into a custodial interrogation.Â  Because the second\r\n  and third statements were obtained in a noncustodial setting, I would hold the\r\n  second and third statements were admissible.Â  Thus, I would reverse the court\r\n  of appeals' decision and hold the trial court correctly allowed all three\r\n  statements.Â Â Â Â  \r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs except for the finding that the\r\n  third statement was obtained in a non-custodial setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The child, who was born prematurely, had lung issues and was being weaned off a\r\n  nebulizer and Albuterol.Â  The mother was primarily involved in the childâ€™s\r\n  medical treatments.\r\n[2] There was evidence that a child should be placed on a hard surface such as a\r\n  floor when CPR is to be administered.\r\n[3] Seibert was filed eight days after respondentâ€™s trial ended.\r\n[4] The dissent focuses on the fact the first statement was admissible, while our\r\n  focus is on the police actions and interrogation after that statement had been\r\n  given.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26760","title":"RV Resort v.

BillyBob's Marina,\r\n    Inc., Op. No. 2007-UP-556 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 14, 2007).Â  We\r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1981, the RV Resort and Yacht Club (the Resort) was\r\n  established as a condominium regime on Hilton Head Island in Beaufort County by Outdoor Resorts, RV Resort and Yacht Club, a South Carolina General\r\n  Partnership (the developer).Â  Covenants[1] governing the Resort and\r\n  the Association were recorded in June 1981.Â  \r\nBy-laws for the Association were instituted in a\r\n  separate document that was incorporated by reference into the Covenants.Â  The\r\n  developer created the Association, a nonprofit corporation, to be responsible\r\n  for operating the property and maintaining the common areas.Â  Membership in the\r\n  Association is limited to lot owners.Â  \r\nThe Resort consists of a subdivision of approximately\r\n  200 lots on which travelers can park RVs.Â  There is also a marina and other\r\n  amenities.Â  The developer retained sole ownership of the marina.Â  \r\nThe lots are individually owned as part of the regime, and the lot\r\n  owners have an undivided interest in the common areas, which include the water,\r\n  sewer, and electrical distribution systems, the roads within the property, the\r\n  parking area, and the swimming pool, bath houses, and other facilities.Â  The\r\n  Association, through its Board of Directors, has the power under Article VI of\r\n  the Covenants to impose on the lot owners assessments necessary for the upkeep\r\n  and maintenance of the common areas.\r\nWhen the lots are not being used by the lot owner,\r\n  they are available for rent to the public.Â  Under Article VII of the Covenants,\r\n  entitled Rental of Lots, the developer has &quot;the exclusive right&quot; to\r\n  rent the lots when the lot owners are absent &quot;at scheduled rates\r\n  promulgated from time to time by the Developer.&quot;Â  For its services, the\r\n  developer was authorized to retain 50% of the gross rental amount collected on\r\n  any lot, with the remaining 50% to be paid to the lot owner.Â  \r\nAlthough there was no specific provision in the\r\n  Covenants, the original developer began collecting as part of the rent $2.00\r\n  per day for electricity[2], which the developer paid\r\n  to the lot owners.Â  On April 27, 1999, Dwight Blakeslee, President of the\r\n  Association, wrote to the developer (as of this point, Sanwater Resorts, Inc.\r\n  had taken over as the developer) to request that the developer increase the\r\n  daily rental rate by $1.00, which the Association could then &quot;siphon off&quot;\r\n  to go into a fund to finance road resurfacing; the Association also requested\r\n  an increase in the electric allotment to the lot owner from $2.00 to $3.00 per\r\n  night due to the larger size of the vehicles utilizing the resort:Â  \r\n\r\n\tAs you know the Developer sets the rental\r\n  rates for this Resort.Â  The Board of Directors [of the Association] has two\r\n  concerns that would require an increase in rates.Â  First, we would like to be\r\n  able to siphon off the rental rate one dollar per rental night to put into\r\n    road resurfacing, and second, with the increase in size and technology in\r\n  the rigs now renting here, we would like to increase the electric allotment to\r\n  the lot owner to three dollars per rental night.Â  This could be accomplished by\r\n  raising the nightly rental rate by two dollars per night.Â  (Emphasis added.)\r\n\r\nThe developer did not immediately respond to the\r\n  Association's request for an increase in the rental rates, and the rates\r\n  remained unchanged.Â  In May 1999, the developer entered into a contract to sell\r\n  its interests in the Resort (and the marina) to Robert and Arleen Stelmack, who\r\n  owned BillyBob.Â Â Â  \r\nThereafter, by letter of June 23, 1999, the developer\r\n  agreed to the Association's request &quot;for a $2.00 increase in the nightly\r\n  rental,&quot; i.e., $1.00 for the new road fee (to be paid to the Association)\r\n  and an additional $1.00 for electricity ($3.00 per night instead of $2.00, to\r\n  be paid to the lot owner).Â Â Â  In July 1999, it was agreed that the changes in\r\n  the rental rates would not be effective until the next operating quarter, set\r\n  to begin September 15, 1999.[3]Â  \r\nFollowing these negotiations, the developer finalized\r\n  a sale of itsÂ  interests to BillyBob in late August 1999, officially making\r\n  BillyBob the successor to the developer at that time.Â  After the sale, BillyBob\r\n  collected the daily electricity fee of $3.00 as part of the rental charges and\r\n  remitted it to the lot owners.Â  In addition, BillyBob collected the\r\n  newly-implemented road fee and remitted it to the Association.Â  \r\nBillyBob also initiated a higher rental charge of $2.00\r\n  extra per night for lots with telephone service, of which BillyBob paid the lot\r\n  owners 50%, or an additional $1.00 per night, in accordance with Article VII of\r\n  the Covenants, which required the developer to split all gross rental proceeds\r\n  equally with the lot owners.Â  \r\nBy letter dated October 17, 1999, BillyBob's\r\n  president, Robert Stelmack, formally advised the Association that, although it\r\n  had been temporarily collecting a &quot;pass-through charge&quot; of $3.00 per\r\n  day for electricity from renters, effective November 1, 1999, it would raise\r\n  the daily rental charge and simultaneously cancel the separate electricity\r\n  pass-through charge of $3.00 per night, so that the net amount to the lot\r\n  owners would remain the same.Â  \r\nIn a second letter to the Association also dated\r\n  October 17, 2009, BillyBob's president stated that, regarding the $1.00 road\r\n  fee, &quot;[i]n consideration for BillyBob's collection of this fee, it is\r\n  requested that the Association pass a resolution or amendment committing the\r\n  Association to maintain/repair the roads that are the property of the\r\n  'Developer' in the same manner and state of repair as the roads that are the\r\n  property of the Association.&quot;Â  \r\nThe Association rejected BillyBob's request to\r\n  undertake maintenance and repairs of BillyBob's roads, and it objected to\r\n  BillyBob's decision to cancel the separate electricity fee. The Association\r\n  also objected to BillyBob's handling of the increased rental proceeds from lots\r\n  with telephone service, asserting all of the extra rental proceeds, not just 50%,\r\n  should be remitted to the lot owners because the lot owners separately paid for\r\n  their telephone charges on the lots.Â  \r\nOn November 1, 1999, BillyBob ceased collection of\r\n  both the separate electricity fee and the road fee pursuant to its earlier\r\n  notifications.Â  BillyBob sent a letter to lot owners on November 7, 1999\r\n  regarding the changes.Â  BillyBob explained that renters were confused by, and\r\n  objected to, separate charges for electricity on their bills.Â  Under the new\r\n  rate structure, there would be no separate collection for electricity charges\r\n  and, in the future, any increases in the rental rates would be equally divided\r\n  between the developer and the lot owners as provided by the Covenants, thus\r\n  eliminating pass-through charges.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Association (and its Board of Directors)[4] filed the current action against BillyBob alleging several of BillyBob's\r\n  actions as the successor developer had violated the Covenants and other\r\n  provisions.Â  The matter was referred to a special referee, who issued an\r\n  initial order dated March 19, 2004, addressing numerous matters (some of which\r\n  are no longer in dispute) and ordering an accounting.Â  As relevant here, the\r\n  referee found BillyBob had violated the Covenants[5] by (1) &quot;[r]efusing to collect and remit to [the Association] a reasonable\r\n  charge imposed for use of [the Association's] roads&quot; and\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&quot;[f]ailing to remit to [M]embers [members of the Association,\r\n  i.e., the lot owners] 100% of monies collected from renters by BillyBob for use\r\n  of Members' electricity and telephone service.&quot;Â  \r\nThe referee further found that, under the Covenants,\r\n  the Association had the exclusive right to, and had adopted with the\r\n  developer's approval, certain rules and regulations, and that the Association\r\n  had imposed the following charge:Â  &quot;The Developer is required to pay to\r\n  [the Association] the sum of $1.00 per rental night for each lot rented for the\r\n  road fund.&quot;Â  The referee stated BillyBob did not have the authority to\r\n  rescind the Association's rules and regulations.Â  The referee additionally found\r\n  BillyBob had departed from the course of dealing between the developer and the\r\n  lot owners since 1981 by declining to collect and remit the road fee and by\r\n  remitting only 50% of the electrical charges collected by it to the lot\r\n  owners.Â  \r\nBy final order filed June 30, 2006, the referee found\r\n  the Association was entitled to damages of $48,447.50 for monies that BillyBob\r\n  should have collected and turned over to the Association for the road fund, and\r\n  that the Association was further due $145,831.50 for electricity charges and\r\n  $1,048.50 for telephone service (with the Association responsible for\r\n  disbursing the electricity and telephone charges to the appropriate lot\r\n  owners), for a total judgment of $195,327.50, plus attorney's fees and costs.Â \r\n  In this final order, the referee additionally found the collection of the\r\n  electricity fee &quot;was mandated under rules adopted by the [A]ssociation\r\n  under the Covenants and with the approval of the developer.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed the rulings regarding the three fees, as well as\r\n  another issue that is no longer in dispute, but reversed the award of\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  RV Resort &amp; Yacht Owners Ass'n v. BillyBob's Marina,\r\n    Inc., Op. No. 2007-UP-556 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 14, 2007).Â  In\r\n  affirming, the Court of Appeals stated:Â  &quot;The Covenants grant the\r\n  Association the right to promulgate rules and regulations without BillyBob's\r\n  permission.Â  We find BillyBob was required to collect the charges on behalf of\r\n  the Association and therefore affirm the referee's findings on this\r\n  issue.&quot;Â  Id. at 6-7.Â  We granted BillyBob's petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBillyBob argues the Court of Appeals erred in its\r\n  decision concerning the three fees.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;Restrictive covenants are contractual in nature.&quot;Â  Hardy v. Aiken,&nbsp;369 S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542&nbsp;(2006).Â \r\n  &quot;The language of a restrictive covenant is to be construed according to\r\n  the plain and ordinary meaning attributed to it at the time of execution.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;[T]he paramount rule of construction is to ascertain and\r\n  give effect to the intent of the parties as determined from the whole document.&quot;Â  Taylor v.\r\n    Lindsey,&nbsp;332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863-64&nbsp;(1998) (quoting Palmetto\r\n      Dunes Resort v. Brown, 287 S.C. 1, 336 S.E.2d 15 (1985)). \r\nAn\r\n  action for a breach of restrictive covenants that seeks monetary damages is an\r\n  action at law, and we will not disturb the trial court's findings unless they\r\n  are unsupported by the evidence.Â  O'Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 14, 416\r\n  S.E.2d 629, 631 (1992) (citing Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266\r\n  S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976)).Â  In contrast, an action to enforce restrictive\r\n  covenants by means of injunctive relief is an action in equity, and we may find\r\n  the facts in accordance with our own view of the evidence.Â  Cedar Cove\r\n    Homeowners Ass'n v. DiPietro, 368 S.C. 254, 258, 628 S.E.2d 284, 286 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006).Â  In this case, the referee expressly ordered a monetary judgment,\r\n  which is legal in nature. \r\nI.&nbsp; Road Maintenance Fee.Â  \r\nThe referee and the Court of Appeals appear to hold\r\n  the road fee was justified under Article VIII of the Covenants because it was\r\n  implemented as the result of an unspecified regulation passed by the\r\n  Association.[6]Â  Article VIII of the\r\n  Covenants, entitled Use and Occupancy, provides in section 8.11 that the\r\n  Association may make and amend from time to time, without the prior written\r\n  consent of the developer, &quot;[o]ther reasonable rules and regulations governing\r\n    use and occupancy . . . which do not alter or are not in contravention of\r\n  any of the foregoing provisions . . . .&quot;Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude the referee\r\n  and the Court of Appeals erred in finding the Association had passed some form\r\n  of regulation instituting a road maintenance fee in this case.Â  The only\r\n  regulations in the record and appendix in this case -- &quot;Basic Rules and\r\n  Regulations, RV Resort &amp; Yacht Club Owner's Association&quot; dated May 10,\r\n  1996 and amended February 1999 -- do not contain any provision for a road fee.Â \r\n  The Rules and Regulations concern such matters as the prohibition of clothes\r\n  lines, campfires, and patio lights, as well as rules regarding pets, the use of\r\n  the pool, and the use of the tennis courts.Â  There is no formal regulation\r\n  listed in this regard.Â  Rather, the road fee was approved as an addition to the\r\n  rental charge by the prior developer. Â \r\nArticle\r\n  VIII, section 8.11, is not applicable here because there is no evidence that\r\n  the road fee was established by means of a rule or regulation set by the\r\n  Association governing use and occupancy.Â  \r\nThe Association alternatively asserts the road fee was\r\n  justifiable under Article XI of the Covenants.Â  The Court of Appeals did not\r\n  rule on this contention and it is without merit, in any event.Â  Article XI,\r\n  entitled Developer's Retention of Interest, clearly pertains to the developer's\r\n  obligation to pay reasonable charges for the developer's use of water,\r\n  electricity, sewage service, and other facilities on the property it retained\r\n  in the Resort and its right to use the common roads without charge. These circumstances\r\n  are not present here. \r\nII.&nbsp; Electricity Fee.\r\nBillyBob\r\n  next challenges the ruling of the Court of Appeals that it owed sums to the\r\n  Association for fees it should have collected for electricity and phone\r\n  service.Â  Specifically, the referee found BillyBob had violated unspecified\r\n  provisions in the Covenants by &quot;[f]ailing to remit to [M]embers [members\r\n  of the Association, i.e., the lot owners] 100% of monies collected from renters\r\n  by BillyBob for use of Members' electricity and telephone service.&quot;Â  The\r\n  referee found the Covenants permitted the Association to develop rules and\r\n  regulations and that the electricity fee was enacted under these rules and\r\n  regulations.\r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded &quot;[t]he Covenants\r\n  grant the Association the right to promulgate rules and regulations without\r\n  BillyBob's permission.Â  We find BillyBob was required to collect the charges on\r\n  behalf of the Association and therefore affirm the referee's findings on this\r\n  issue.&quot;Â  The Court of Appeals did not expressly state, however, that the\r\n  Association had implemented any particular rules or regulations bearing on this\r\n  matter.\r\nAs for the electricity fee, the record does not\r\n  contain a rule or regulation passed by the Association that requires the\r\n  collection of an electricity fee. BillyBob was not obligated to continue the\r\n  collection of a separate charge for electricity.Â  An electricity fee of $2.00\r\n  per night was first implemented by the original developer, which collected it\r\n  as part of the rental fee imposed on those renting lots at the Resort. Â However,\r\n  all parties understood it to be a separate and distinct charge from the lot\r\n  rent.Â  As BillyBob notes, the original developer, in its discretion, decided to\r\n  add the $2.00 amount.Â  Association board members Jean Littell and Dwight\r\n  Blakeslee agree that the original developer had the right to cancel the\r\n  electricity fee at any time, as would a subsequent developer.Â  Dwight\r\n  Blakeslee, who has been involved in the Resort since its inception, stated in a\r\n  letter to Association members that the electricity pass-through charge\r\n  &quot;has always been a management policy set by ORA in all their RV\r\n  Resorts.&quot;Â  He also acknowledged that &quot;[t]here is nothing in the condo\r\n  document regarding this.&quot;Â  \r\nPrior to its departure, the developer (then Sanwater) agreed\r\n  to increase the electricity fee charged to renters from $2.00 to $3.00, to take\r\n  effect with the next quarter, which turned out to be after the sale of the\r\n  Resort to BillyBob had been completed.Â  BillyBob collected the fee when it\r\n  first purchased the developer's interests, and then chose to eliminate the\r\n  separate electricity charge.\r\nThe Court of Appeals declared, however, that the\r\n  electricity fee was not part of the rental charge (and thus not under the\r\n  developer's control) because it was not divided equally between the developer\r\n  and the lot owners as was the remaining rental amount.Â  Rather, it was\r\n  &quot;passed through&quot; directly to the lot owners. Â While we agree with the\r\n  Court of Appeals that the electricity fee was not controlled by the developer, the\r\n  treatment of this fee by the prior developer is not dispositive of this issue.Â \r\n  The prior developer voluntarily treated the electricity fee as a separate\r\n  charge distinguishable from the lot rent and collected it as an unitemized\r\n  portion of the rent and remitted it to the lot owners.Â  Conversely, BillyBob\r\n  ceased collecting an electricity fee altogether; therefore, there was no money\r\n  to remit to the lot owners.Â  \r\nThe record in this case does not contain a regulation\r\n  passed by the Association concerning the electricity fee.Â  Likewise, there is\r\n  no regulation or covenant that requires lot owners to provide electricity to\r\n  renters.Â  Moreover, there is no covenant that specifically requires BillyBob[7] to collect an electricity fee.Â  Rather, it is clear from the record that the\r\n  original developer implemented this charge in its discretion, and the\r\n  Association later requested an increase in this amount (to be paid to\r\n  the lot owners).Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Telephone\r\n  Service Charge.Â  \r\nBillyBob\r\n  lastly challenges the finding of the Court of Appeals that it was delinquent\r\n  for failing to pay over the full amount collected for telephone service to the\r\n  Association. \r\nAfter its purchase and assumption of the interests of\r\n  the developer, BillyBob installed telephone service on three lots that it owned\r\n  in the Resort and sent a letter to all lot owners encouraging them to do the\r\n  same.Â  Approximately a dozen lot owners installed telephone service on their\r\n  lots.Â  BillyBob initiated an increase of $2.00 in the nightly rental charge for\r\n  lots with telephone service.Â  BillyBob split the extra proceeds equally with\r\n  the lot owners, per the Covenant provision calling for an equal division of all\r\n  gross rental proceeds.Â  \r\nBillyBob argues the Court of Appeals erred by lumping\r\n  the telephone charge in with the other issues and finding it had breached the\r\n  Covenants by remitting 50%, rather than all, of the extra $2.00 rental charge\r\n  collected on lots with telephone service to the lot owners.Â  BillyBob asserts\r\n  the Covenants require an equal division of the gross rental proceeds between\r\n  the developer and the lot owner, which is what it did.Â  Not many of the lots\r\n  had telephone service, and BillyBob stated those that did had more rental\r\n  value.Â  BillyBob notes that to the extent the Association relies upon Article XI\r\n  of the Covenants as authority for the proceeds going to the Association, this\r\n  provision applies to utilities and facilities used by the developer on property\r\n  it has retained, not to facilities used by the renters who are staying on the\r\n  lots.Â  Thus, the Association has shown no entitlement to receive (on behalf of\r\n  the lot owners) the extra rental charge for lots with telephone service.\r\nAs currently written, the Covenants require an equal\r\n  sharing of all gross rental proceeds. Â BillyBob does not charge a separate fee\r\n  for telephone service. Â The lots with telephone service were considered more\r\n  desirable by renters and commanded a higher rental rate, just as waterfront\r\n  lots, which cost the lot owners more to acquire, commanded higher rates.Â \r\n  Consequently, BillyBob does not owe the Association additional amounts for the\r\n  rental charges it collected on lots with telephone service.[8]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the decision of the Court of Appeals regarding the three fees\r\n  is\r\nREVERSED.[9] \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â &quot;Declaration of Covenants and\r\n  Restrictions for Outdoor Resorts, R.V. Resort and Yacht Club AND Provisions for the R.V. Resort and Yacht Club, Owners' Association, Inc.&quot; \r\n[2] Â Each lot was separately metered and the\r\n  utility billed the individual lot owners each month for service. Â There is no provision in the Covenants that requires\r\n  lot owners to provide electricity or telephone service to lot renters.\r\n[3] Â Whether or not the developer's letter\r\n  constitutes a binding amendment to the Covenants was not raised and we offer no\r\n  opinion as to its efficacy.\r\n[4]Â  References to the Association shall include the\r\n  board where appropriate. \r\n[5]Â  The referee found that certain amendments to the\r\n  Covenants were invalid and that the applicable version was the original, 1981\r\n  version.Â  No challenge is made to this finding.Â  \r\n[6]Â  The Court of Appeals did not rely on the theory,\r\n  recited by the referee, that the road fee was also justified based on a &quot;course\r\n  of dealing&quot; that was binding on BillyBob.\r\n[7]Â  However, Article VII states â€œ[a]s partial\r\n  considerationâ€ for the right to rent the lots the developer agrees to undertake\r\n  certain advertisement obligations; no other consideration is mentioned. Â It is\r\n  arguable that the other unspoken consideration was the requirement that the\r\n  developer act in the best interest of the owners and comply with reasonable\r\n  requests. This is not an issue raised to this Court, though, and we offer no\r\n  opinion as to it. \r\n[8] Â The developer has the exclusive right to\r\n  provide rental services of the lots. Â The Covenants define\r\n  a lot as a â€œplot of landâ€ and make no reference to the provision of electricity\r\n  or telephone service as a part thereof. Â Moreover,\r\n  there is no requirement that renters be provided electricity or telephone service. Â The lot owners are free to terminate electricity and\r\n  telephone service at any time.\r\n[9]Â  The other issues determined by the Court of Appeals\r\n  are not challenged here and we express no opinion in this regard.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26761","title":"Tobias v.

Rice, 379 S.C. 357, 665 S.E.2d 216 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed a circuit court order refusing to set aside a\r\n  $211,000 judgment entered against Petitioner, Ruby Rice.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliam\r\n  and Elena Tobias (the Tobiases) filed suit alleging they had contracted with\r\n  Rice in May 2001 to lease a number of residential apartment units in\r\n  Greenville.Â  Pursuant to the lease, the Tobiases were to manage and maintain\r\n  the apartments and, in exchange, they were authorized to sublet them at a\r\n  higher rate than they paid to Rice, keeping the profit.Â  According to their complaint,\r\n  the Tobiases subsequently orally contracted with Rice to purchase the units in\r\n  two separate buildings, for a total purchase price of $432,000.00.Â  However, on\r\n  April 1, 2004, Rice reclaimed possession of the apartments and caused trespass\r\n  warrants to be issued against the Tobiases.Â  Rice also directed the tenants to\r\n  make all future payments directly to her. Â The Tobiases filed this suit alleging\r\n  breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and conversion; they sought specific performance\r\n  to enforce the alleged oral contract.\r\nRice\r\n  hired attorney Rodman Tullis to defend her.Â  Tullis filed an answer and\r\n  counterclaim on her behalf.Â  When Tullis did not reply to discovery requests,\r\n  the Tobiases filed motions to compel.Â  A hearing was held before Judge Hill on\r\n  April 14, 2005, at which neither Tullis nor Rice appeared.Â  Judge Hill issued\r\n  an order compelling discovery; upon being advised that the Tobiases had been\r\n  unable to contact attorney Tullis, the court required the Tobiases to serve\r\n  both Tullis and Rice with the order.Â  Judge Hill ordered Rice to respond to\r\n  discovery within thirty days or her answer and counterclaim would be stricken.Â \r\n  However, her answer was not stricken in compliance with this order, and the\r\n  Tobiases did not seek a default judgment on this basis.\r\nUnbeknownst\r\n  to Rice at this time, and presumably to the Tobiases and their attorney as\r\n  well, on April 12, 2005, attorney Tullis was suspended from the practice of law\r\n  by this Court prior to the Tobiasesâ€™ motion to compel discovery.Â  See Order, Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17 (filed April 12, 2005).[1]Â \r\n  Unfortunately, however, Rice had no means of knowing of the suspension, and Tullis\r\n  was prohibited thereby from taking any action on her behalf.\r\nAfter\r\n  being served with Judge Hillâ€™s order, Rice attempted, to no avail, to contact\r\n  attorney Tullis.Â  Unable to reach Tullis, Rice contacted another attorney,\r\n  Patricia Anderson who, on June 6, 2005, requested a thirty day extension to\r\n  answer the complaint.Â  The Tobiasesâ€™ attorney denied the request, advising the\r\n  time to answer had lapsed.Â  Anderson took no further action on Riceâ€™s behalf.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 24, 2005, a Non-Jury Trial Notice was sent to Tullis advising\r\n  the case was set to be called for trial the week of November 7, 2005.Â  When the\r\n  original notice was returned by the U.S. Postal Service, the Tobiases faxed and\r\n  re-mailed the notice to Tullis on Nov. 2, 2005.Â  No notice of the\r\n  hearing was sent to Rice personally, and it is undisputed Rice never received\r\n  any notice of the final hearing, which was held on November 8, 2005 before\r\n  Judge Few.\r\nAt the November 8, 2005 hearing, neither Tullis nor Rice appeared.Â  After Mr.\r\n  Tobiasesâ€™ very brief testimony, the trial judge held Rice in breach of the lease\r\n  agreements and ordered judgment against her in the amount of $211,700.00.Â  The\r\n  court also ordered specific performance, requiring Rice to sell the two\r\n  properties to the Tobiases for the agreed upon sales price of $432,000.00.[2]Â \r\n  Counsel for the Tobiases served the final order of judgment on both Tullis and\r\n  Rice.\r\nRice\r\n  filed a pro se motion to reconsider on December 9, 2005, contending attorney\r\n  Tullis failed to advise her of the November 8, 2005 hearing date and that she\r\n  should be afforded an opportunity to be heard.Â  Thereafter, on January 26, 2006,\r\n  attorney Michael Talley filed, on Riceâ€™s behalf, a Motion to Vacate and/or Set\r\n  Aside the Judgment pursuant to Rule 55(c) and Rule 60(b). Â Judge Few denied\r\n  attorney Talleyâ€™s motion in a form order dated January 11, 2007; the court did\r\n  not rule on Riceâ€™s pro se motion to reconsider.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of Riceâ€™s post-trial\r\n  motions to set aside the judgment?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals found that because Rice had been personally served with Judge\r\n  Hillâ€™s April 2005 order requiring her to comply with discovery, she had a duty\r\n  to monitor the proceedings such that there was no excusable neglect which would\r\n  warrant setting aside the judgment.[3]Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals noted: \r\n\r\n\tWe do find the overall situation troubling, especially\r\n  as it pertains to the adequacy of trial notice given to Rice.Â  As evidenced by\r\n  the record, Riceâ€™s counsel of record, Mr. Tullis, was mailed and faxed notice\r\n  of the mandatory roster meeting, thereby providing adequate notice of trial.Â \r\n  On the other hand, it is undisputed that Mr. Tullis was providing inadequate\r\n    representation to Rice throughout the circuit court proceedings.Â  Mr.\r\n  Tullis had some disciplinary history which ultimately culminated in his\r\n  disbarment in 2007 and included a suspension in 2005 for failure to comply with\r\n  CLE requirements and failure to pay bar dues.\r\n\r\n379\r\n  S.C. at 364, 665 S.E.2d at 220.Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  The Court of Appeals\r\n  nonetheless went on to hold: \r\n\r\n\t[T]he decision of the trial court is supported by the\r\n  fact that Rice was on notice of the problems she was facing with her counsel of\r\n  record in June 2005 at the latest, when she was served with Judge Hillâ€™s order.\r\n  . . For almost six months she never contacted the clerk to ensure that she was\r\n  served with all relevant notices, never obtained new counsel, nor moved to\r\n  relieve counsel.\r\n\r\nId. at 365, 665 S.E.2d at 221.Â  We find the Court of\r\n  Appeals placed an undue burden upon Rice.Â  Rice repeatedly attempted to contact\r\n  Tullis who, unbeknownst to her, was suspended.Â  When she received the order\r\n  from Judge Hill, she again attempted to contact Tullis.Â  Â Receiving no answer,\r\n  she attempted to hire a new attorney.Â  She received no further communication\r\n  until such time as she was served with the order issuing judgment against her.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  of Tullisâ€™ suspension, Rice found herself in a classic Catch 22[4] situation which she could find no redress.Â Â  When she filed a pro se motion to reconsider the judgment, alleging Tullisâ€™ had abandoned her, the\r\n  trial court declined to rule on it, treating her as though she were represented\r\n  by counsel.Â Â  The Court of Appeals, however, treated her as a pro se litigant, with a duty to monitor her own proceedings.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nIf,\r\n  as found by the trial court, Rice was represented by counsel, then counsel was\r\n  required to notify her of the date and time of the hearing and, contrary to the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion, it was not incumbent upon Rice to monitor the status\r\n  of her proceedings.[5]Â  \r\nIf,\r\n  on the other hand, as implied by the Court of Appeals, Rice was deemed pro\r\n    se by her attorneyâ€™s suspension, then she was entitled to due process and\r\n  notice of the final hearing.Â  Accordingly, absent notice of the proceedings, Rice\r\n  is entitled to relief from judgment.Â  Accord Moore v. Moore, 376\r\n  S.C. 467, 657 S.E.2d 743 (2008) (procedural due process requires (1) adequate\r\n  notice; (2) adequate opportunity for a hearing; (3) the right to introduce\r\n  evidence; and (4) the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses).Â  We\r\n  reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion, set aside the judgment, and remand the\r\n  matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this\r\n  opinion.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a\r\n  separate opinion.Â  KITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the result reached by the majority\r\n  because I find that Rice, as a pro se litigant, was entitled to notice\r\n  of the November 8, 2005 hearing.Â  From the moment that attorney Tullis was\r\n  suspended by this Court, Rice acted pro se.[6]Â  See Rule 30(a), Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\n  South Carolina Appellate Court Rules (recognizing a suspended lawyer's\r\n  &quot;inability to act as an attorney&quot;).Â  As a pro se litigant,\r\n  Rice was entitled by procedural due process to notice of the November 8, 2005\r\n  hearing before Judge Few.Â  See Moore v. Moore, 376 S.C. 467, 657\r\n  S.E.2d 743 (2008).Â  Rice argued in both her Motion for Reconsideration and\r\n  appellate briefs that she was personally entitled to notice based on due\r\n  process.Â  Rice was not afforded such notice and, consequently, the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in affirming the trial court's denial of the Motion for\r\n  Reconsideration.Â  Because Rice was not represented by Tullis at the time notice\r\n  was provided by the Respondents, I would find the discussion in the Court of\r\n  Appeals opinion as to whether Tullis's negligence should be imputed to Rice\r\n  irrelevant.[7]Â \r\n  Accordingly, I concur in the result reached by the majority.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  The majority relies on an unpreserved issue\r\n  to reverse the court of appeals.Â  As noted by the court of appeals:\r\n\r\n\tNotwithstanding, Rice did not move to vacate the\r\n  judgment based on excusable neglect by arguing that the negligence of her\r\n  counsel should not be imputed to her due to his willful abandonment of her\r\n  case, nor does she attempt to raise this ground on appeal.Â  While arguably one\r\n  could assert that this ground was raised in Riceâ€™s pro se motion to reconsider,\r\n  that motion was never ruled on by the trial court and the issue was never\r\n  raised on appeal.Â  In order for an issue to be properly presented for appeal,\r\n  Riceâ€™s brief must set forth the issue in the statement of issues on appeal.Â  \r\n\tSee Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR; Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 285, 543 S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Further, it is error\r\n  for the appellate court to consider issues not properly raised to it.Â  First\r\n    Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (stating\r\n  appellant must provide authority and supporting arguments for his issue to be\r\n  considered raised on appeal).Â  Accordingly, we may not consider this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTobias v. Rice,\r\n  379 S.C. 357, 365, 665 S.E.2d 216, 220 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\n\r\nI vote to affirm the court of\r\n  appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Tullis was suspended for failing to comply with\r\n  the mandatory reporting requirements of SCACR Rule 419 (b).Â  Tullis was\r\n  subsequently disbarred.Â  In re Tullis, 375 S.C. 190, 191, 652 S.E.2d\r\n  395, 395 (2007).\r\n[2]Â  The sales price was to be offset by the\r\n  Tobiasesâ€™ judgment against Rice. \r\n[3] See Rule 60(B), SCRCP (to warrant relief from judgment, Rule 60(b), SCRCP requires\r\n  a particularized showing of mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, surprise,\r\n  newly discovered evidence, fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an\r\n  adverse party).Â  Sundown Operating Co., Inc. v. Intedge Industries, Inc.,\r\n  383 S.C. 601, 601 S.E.2d 885 (2009).Â  \r\n[4]Â  Joseph Heller, Catch -22 (1961).\r\n[5] Â The Court of Appeals relied upon Hill v. Dotts,\r\n  345 S.C. 304, 310, 547 S.E.2d 894, 897 (Ct. App. 2001), for the proposition\r\n  that a party has a duty to monitor the progress of his case.Â  Â However, Hill involved a pro se litigant, not one who was represented by counsel.Â \r\n  Further, the rule that an attorneyâ€™s negligence may be imputed to his client\r\n  and prevent the latter from relying on that ground for opening or vacating a\r\n  judgment does not prevail where, as here, the attorney abandons or withdraws\r\n  from the case.Â  Graham v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442, 248 S.E.2d 594\r\n  (1978), citing 46 Am.Jur.2d Judgments Â§ 737 (1969).Â  Â Â \r\n[6] This Court may take judicial notice of the fact that Tullis remained suspended\r\n  until he was disbarred in 2007.\r\n[7] Moreover, in my view, Tullis's actions in this matter go well beyond mere\r\n  negligence.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26763","title":"The State v.

App. 2008), in which the Court of Appeals interpreted section\r\n  56-5-4140 of the South Carolina Code,[1] a statute regulating the maximum\r\n  gross weight of vehicles driven on South Carolina roads.Â  We affirm as\r\n  modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe parties agreed to the\r\n  relevant facts underlying this case.Â  On February 14, 2006, Reginald Craig\r\n  Sweat, a sanitation truck driver for the City of Aiken, was stopped and cited\r\n  by a State Transport Police (STP) officer for exceeding the allowable gross\r\n  weight for the three-axle sanitation truck he was driving.Â  According to the\r\n  citation, the vehicle weighed 57,100 pounds, which the officer claimed exceeded\r\n  the allowable gross weight of 50,600 pounds.Â  The 50,600 pound amount was\r\n  calculated based on an initial three-axle amount of 46,000 pounds plus a ten\r\n  percent scale tolerance of 4,600. Â \r\nOn April 10, 2006, a\r\n  different STP officer stopped and cited Arthur Bryant, III, another driver for\r\n  the City of Aiken, for driving the same sanitation truck in excess of the\r\n  allowable gross vehicle weight.Â  The citation indicates the vehicle weighed\r\n  56,900 pounds, which exceeded the allowable gross weight of 50,600. Â Â Â \r\nAt the time the STP issued\r\n  the citations, section 56-5-4140 provided in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  (1)(a) The gross weight of a vehicle or\r\n    combination of vehicles, operated or moved upon any interstate, highway or\r\n    section of highway shall not exceed:\r\n  (1) Single-unit vehicle with two axles................. 35,000\r\n    lbs.\r\n  (2) Single-unit vehicle with three axles .................. 46,000\r\n    lbs.\r\n  (3) Single-unit vehicle with four axles ................... 63,500\r\n    lbs.\r\n  Except, on the interstate, vehicles must\r\n    meet axle spacing requirements and corresponding maximum overall gross weights,\r\n    not to exceed 63,500 lbs., in accordance with the table in (b) plus tolerances.\r\n  (4) Single unit vehicle with five or more axles ....... 65,000\r\n    lbs.\r\n  Except, on the interstate, vehicles must meet axle spacing\r\n    requirements and corresponding maximum overall gross weights, not to exceed\r\n    65,000 lbs., in accordance with the table in (b) plus tolerances.\r\n  (5) Combination of vehicles with three axles ......... 50,000 lbs.\r\n  (6) Combination of vehicles with four axles .......... 65,000 lbs.\r\n  (7) Combination of vehicles with five or more axles...73,280 lbs.\r\n  The gross weight imposed upon any highway or section of highway\r\n    other than the interstate by two or more consecutive axles in tandem\r\n    articulated from a common attachment to the vehicle and spaced not less than\r\n    forty inches nor more than ninety-six inches apart shall not exceed thirty-six\r\n    thousand pounds, and no one axle of any such group of two or more consecutive\r\n    axles shall exceed the load permitted for a single axle. The load imposed on\r\n    the highway by two consecutive axles, individually attached to the vehicle and\r\n    spaced not less than forty inches nor more than ninety-six inches apart, shall\r\n    not exceed thirty-six thousand pounds and no one axle of any such group of two\r\n    consecutive axles shall exceed the load permitted for a single axle.\r\n  The ten percent enforcement tolerance specified in Section\r\n    56-5-4160 applies to the vehicle weight limits specified in this section\r\n    except, the gross weight on a single axle operated on the interstate may not\r\n    exceed 20,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances; the gross weight on a tandem axle\r\n    operated on the interstate may not exceed 35,200 pounds, including all\r\n    enforcement tolerances; and the\r\n    overall gross weight for vehicles operated on the interstate may not exceed\r\n    75,185 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances except as provided in (b).\r\n  (b) Vehicles with an overall maximum gross weight in excess of\r\n    75,185 pounds may operate upon any highway or section of highway in the\r\n    Interstate System up to an overall maximum of 80,000 pounds in accordance with\r\n    the following:\r\n  The weight imposed upon the highway by any group of two or more\r\n    consecutive axles may not, unless specially permitted by the Department of Public Safety exceed\r\n    an overall gross weight produced by the application of the following formula:\r\n  W = 500 (LN/N-1 + 12N + 36)\r\n  In the formula W equals overall gross weight on any group of two\r\n    or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, L equals distance in feet\r\n    between the extreme of any group of two or more consecutive axles, and N equals\r\n    number of axles in the group under consideration.\r\n  As an exception, two consecutive sets of\r\n    tandem axles may carry a gross load of 68,000 pounds if the overall distance\r\n    between the first and last axles of the consecutive sets of tandem axles is 36\r\n    feet or more. The formula is expressed by the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Distance\r\n    in feet between the extremes of any group of 2 or more consecutive axles\r\n    Maximum load in\r\n      pounds carried on any group of 2 or more consecutive axles\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    2 axles\r\n    3 axles\r\n    4 axles\r\n    5 axles\r\n    6 axles\r\n    7 axles\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4\r\n

products, concrete mixing trucks, fuel oil trucks, line trucks, and trucks\r\n      designated and constructed for special type work or use are not required to\r\n      conform to the axle spacing requirements of this section. However, the vehicle\r\n      is limited to a weight of twenty thousand pounds for each axle plus scale\r\n      tolerances and the maximum gross weight of these vehicles may not exceed the\r\n      maximum weight allowed by this section for the appropriate number of axles,\r\n      irrespective of the distance between axles, plus allowable scale tolerances.\r\n  (b) Concrete mixing trucks which operate\r\n    within a fifteen-mile radius of their home base are not required to conform to\r\n    the requirements of this section. Â However, these vehicles are\r\n    limited to a maximum load of the rated capacity of the concrete mixer, the true\r\n    gross load not to exceed sixty-six\r\n    thousand pounds. Â All of these vehicles shall have at least three axles each\r\n    with brake-equipped wheels.\r\n  (c) Well-drilling, boring rigs, and tender trucks are not required\r\n    to conform to the axle spacing requirements of this section. Â However, the\r\n    vehicle is limited to seventy thousand pounds gross vehicle weight and\r\n    twenty-five thousand pounds for each axle plus scale tolerances.\r\n\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4140 (2006) (emphasis added).\r\nIn conjunction,\r\n  section 56-5-4160(A) states, in part: &quot;In determining whether the limits\r\n  established by Section 56-5-4130 or 56-5-4140 have been exceeded, the scaled\r\n  weights of the gross weight of vehicles and combinations of vehicles are\r\n  considered to be not closer than ten percent to the true gross weight, except\r\n  as otherwise provided in Section 56-5-4140.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-4160\r\n  (A) (Supp. 2007).Â  Additionally, the parties agreed the sanitation truck driven\r\n  by the Respondents met the definition of a &quot;truck designated and constructed\r\n  for special type work&quot; pursuant to section 56-5-4140(2)(a).Â  Â \r\nAt the hearing\r\n  before the magistrate, Sweat and Bryant (&quot;Respondents&quot;) made a motion\r\n  to dismiss both citations on the ground section 56-5-4140(2)(a) permits them to\r\n  operate the city's sanitation truck at a maximum gross vehicle weight of 66,000\r\n  pounds.Â  Â Â Respondents reasoned that subsection (2)(a) constituted an exception\r\n  to the general provisions of the statute which permitted each axle of the &quot;special\r\n  use&quot; truck to carry 20,000 pounds plus a ten percent scale tolerance.Â  Respondents\r\n  also contended the reference in subsection (2)(a) to &quot;the maximum weight\r\n  allowed by this section for the appropriate number of axles, irrespective of\r\n  the distance between the axles&quot; referred to the table in section\r\n  56-5-4140(1)(b). \r\nIn response, the\r\n  State asserted the reference in subsection (2)(a) to the &quot;maximum weight\r\n  allowed by this section&quot; referred to section 56-5-4140(1)(a)(2), which\r\n  limited the gross weight of the three-axle, sanitation truck to 46,000 pounds\r\n  plus ten percent scale tolerances.Â  \r\nIn two summary\r\n  orders, the magistrate found Respondents were guilty of exceeding the allowed\r\n  gross weight for the sanitation truck.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the\r\n  circuit court reversed the convictions and remanded the cases for entry of a\r\n  not guilty verdict. Â In so ruling, the circuit court concluded the statutory\r\n  exception of subsection (2)(a) limited a special use truck to a maximum gross\r\n  weight of 20,000 pounds per axle plus scale tolerances.Â  The circuit court specifically\r\n  rejected the State's interpretation of the statute, finding such a reading\r\n  would contravene the statutory construction rule that a court must follow a\r\n  specific provision over general language in the statute. Thus, &quot;applying\r\n  the specific statutory provisions . . . for a garbage truck, as a vehicle\r\n  constructed for a special type of work, means it can weigh in at up to 22,000\r\n  pounds per axle.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nSubsequently, the\r\n  circuit court denied the State's motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule\r\n  59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  In the order, the\r\n  circuit court judge reiterated the prior ruling and clarified that &quot;[s]ection\r\n  56-5-4140(2)(a) is the applicable specific statutory exception to the general\r\n  gross weight limits contained in 56-5-4140(1)(a)(2).&quot;Â  The court concluded\r\n  that subsection (2)(a) meant that the sanitation truck was permitted a weight\r\n  of 20,000 pounds per axle plus scale tolerances, not to exceed the maximum\r\n  gross weight allowed by the table in subsection (1)(b).Â  \r\nThe State\r\n  appealed the circuit court's order to the Court of Appeals.Â  In a unanimous\r\n  decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the circuit court.Â  State v. Sweat, 379 S.C. 367, 665 S.E.2d 645 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).Â  Emphasizing the application of the rules of statutory\r\n  construction, the Court of Appeals found: \r\n\r\n  Subsection (1)(a) sets the general per-axle standard\r\n    for vehicles in South Carolina.Â  Subsection (2)(a) provides a different\r\n    standard for specific types of vehicles when they are not operated on the\r\n    interstate highway system.Â  Subsection (2)(a) does precisely what an exception\r\n    is intended to do:Â  it identifies a category to which the general rule does not\r\n    apply.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 383, 665 S.E.2d at 654.Â  Â \r\nIn terms\r\n  of explanation, the Court of Appeals determined the phrase in subsection (2)(a)\r\n  &quot;maximum gross weight of these vehicles may not exceed the maximum weight\r\n  allowed by this section&quot; referred to section 56-5-4140 as whole\r\n  which includes the formula and table in subsection (1)(b).Â  Id. at 383,\r\n  665 S.E.2d at 655 (emphasis added).Â  The Court of Appeals noted the &quot;maximum\r\n  allowable weight for a three-axle vehicle under subsection (1)(b) is 80,000 total\r\n  pounds,&quot; which represents the largest allowable weight found anywhere in\r\n  section 56-5-4140.Â  Id.Â  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals concluded &quot;[s]pecial\r\n  use vehicles can exceed the general rule requirements of subsection (1)(a), but\r\n  the exception in no event allows those vehicles to surpass the maximum figures\r\n  found in subsection (1)(b).&quot;Â  Id. at 383-84, 665 S.E.2d at 655.\r\nIn\r\n  rejecting the State's position, the Court of Appeals stated &quot;[t]he State's\r\n  proposed interpretation, which elevates subsection (1)(a) over all others and\r\n  effectively renders subsection (2)(a) meaningless, flies in the face of the\r\n  plain language of the statute.&quot;Â  Id. at 384-85, 665 S.E.2d at 655. Â The\r\n  Court of Appeals believed that if the General Assembly intended subsection\r\n  (2)(a) to be an exception only as to tandem axle vehicles, as the State\r\n  averred, the General Assembly could have included language expressly limiting\r\n  the nature of the exception contained in subsection (2)(a).Â  Id. at 384,\r\n  665 S.E.2d at 655.\r\nAs the\r\n  final part of its analysis, the Court of Appeals rejected the State's policy\r\n  argument that the circuit court's interpretation would authorize the operation\r\n  of grossly overweight vehicles.Â  Id. at 385, 665 S.E.2d at 655.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals found the State had not demonstrated that affirming the\r\n  circuit court's decision would adversely affect the state's roads or public safety.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals explained that under subsection (1)(b), the maximum total\r\n  weight of a vehicle is 80,000 with a ten percent scale tolerance of 8,000.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Thus, the Court of Appeals believed there was no merit to the State's fear that\r\n  drivers could operate vehicles weighing more than 100,000 pounds on South\r\n  Carolina's roads.Â  Id.\r\nExtending\r\n  its policy analysis, the Court of Appeals concluded that public policy\r\n  considerations supported the circuit court's interpretation given the General\r\n  Assembly &quot;obviously determined there was a legitimate reason to create\r\n  separate, higher weight allowances for special use vehicles.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals found that one purpose for the special category was to &quot;permit\r\n  larger loads in order to limit the trips these vehicles are required to make.&quot;Â  Id. at 385, 665 S.E.2d at 655-56. Â In creating the exception, the\r\n  Court of Appeals believed the General Assembly &quot;recognized that sanitation\r\n  trucks and other special use vehicles are designed and built to handle heavier\r\n  loads safely to reduce the number of trips per truck.&quot;Â  Id.Â  at\r\n  385, 665 S.E.2d at 656.\r\nThis Court\r\n  granted the State's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of\r\n  the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn challenging the decision\r\n  of the Court of Appeals, the State raises the following five arguments:\r\n\r\n  1. The Court of Appeals erroneously\r\n    presumed that the Legislature intended to radically increase the maximum gross\r\n    vehicle weights of the special work or use vehicles of section 56-5-4140(2)(a) rather\r\n    than recognize a moderate increase only as to tandem axle weight limitation.Â \r\n    This holding, in turn, violates the Equal Protection clause.Â  \r\n  2. The Court of Appeals\r\n    inappropriately used section 56-5-4140(1)(b) from which it established a\r\n    single, maximum gross vehicle weight for all the special use vehicles of\r\n    section 56-5-4140(2)(a).\r\n  3. The Court of Appeals failed to\r\n    give deference to the state agency's well-considered interpretation of a\r\n    statute, which the agency was charged with enforcing.\r\n  4. The Court of Appeals'\r\n    interpretation of section 56-5-4140(2)(a) leads to an absurd result when\r\n    reconciling it with section 56-5-4140(2)(b), thus, making section\r\n    56-5-4140(2)(b) meaningless surplusage.\r\n  5.&nbsp;The Court's interpretation is in\r\n    conflict with 2008 legislation amending section 56-5-4140. \r\n\r\nAlthough the State raises\r\n  five separate arguments,[2] we believe a decision in this case involves a single question:Â  What is the\r\n  maximum allowable weight for vehicles designated and constructed for special\r\n  use or work under section 56-5-4140?\r\nIn answering this question, it\r\n  is necessary to consider the following rules of statutory construction.\r\n&quot;All\r\n  rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative intent must\r\n  prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that\r\n  language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the statute.&quot;\r\n  Â Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach Election Comm'n, 342 S.C. 373, 380,\r\n  537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).\r\nThe Court should\r\n  give words &quot;their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or\r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.&quot; Â Sloan\r\n    v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 469, 636 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  607 (2006). Â &quot;A statute as a whole must receive a practical,\r\n  reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and\r\n  policy of the lawmakers.&quot; Â Browning v. Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 125,\r\n  414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992).Â  In interpreting a statute, the language of the\r\n  statute must be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords\r\n  with its general purpose.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman,\r\n  309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  &quot;Any ambiguity in a\r\n  statute should be resolved in favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial\r\n  operation of the law.&quot; Â Bennett v. Sullivan's Island Bd. of Adjustment,\r\n  313 S.C. 455, 458, 438 S.E.2d 273, 274 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nCourts will\r\n  reject a statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so plainly\r\n  absurd that it could not have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat\r\n  the plain legislative intention. Â Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C.\r\n  362, 368, 529 S.E.2d 280, 283 (2000).Â  &quot;A statute should be so construed\r\n  that no word, clause, sentence, provision or part shall be rendered surplusage,\r\n  or superfluous.&quot;Â  In re Decker, 322 S.C. 215, 219, 471 S.E.2d 462,\r\n  463 (1995) (citation omitted). \r\n&quot;The\r\n  construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be\r\n  accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent\r\n  compelling reasons.&quot; Â Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Exam'rs in Optometry,\r\n  291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987). Â Even so, an administrative\r\n  construction &quot;affords no basis for the perpetuation of a patently\r\n  erroneous application of the statute.&quot; Â Monroe v. Livingston,\r\n  251 S.C. 214, 217, 161 S.E.2d 243, 244 (1968).\r\nApplying the above-outlined\r\n  rules to section 56-5-4140, we agree with the ultimate conclusion of the Court\r\n  of Appeals.Â  As will be discussed, we find the Court of Appeals correctly\r\n  interpreted the statute at issue with the exception of one minor finding.\r\nIn analyzing the specific provisions\r\n  of section 56-5-4140, it is essential to consider the overall purpose of this\r\n  statutory scheme.Â  This type of statute has &quot;at least two purposes, namely,\r\n  the protection of the highway and highway structures and the protection of\r\n  other highway users from the hazard of vehicles which may be less than\r\n  manageable by reason of overloading.&quot;Â  J. A. Bryant, Jr., Annotation, Automobiles:Â \r\n    Construction and Operation of Statutes or Regulations Restricting the Weight of\r\n    Motor Vehicles or Their Loads, 45 A.L.R.3d 503, 508 (1972 &amp; Supp. 2009)\r\n  (discussing state cases involving the construction and operation of statutes or\r\n  regulations restricting generally the weight of motor vehicles or their loads).\r\nWith this purpose in mind, it\r\n  is apparent that the General Assembly enacted section 56-5-4140 to regulate the\r\n  maximum weight of vehicles that traverse South Carolina roads in an effort to\r\n  protect the infrastructure of the state road system and to protect individuals\r\n  travelling on these roads.Â  \r\nWe believe the General\r\n  Assembly effectuated this purpose in section 56-5-4140 by establishing the\r\n  maximum weight for all classifications of vehicles.Â  As seen in subsection\r\n  (1)(a), the General Assembly created the general standard for all vehicles.Â \r\n  Recognizing that weight may be more evenly distributed when the number of axles\r\n  increases,[3] the General Assembly provided for increased weight amounts in direct proportion\r\n  to the number of axles on a vehicle.Â  \r\nSubsection (1)(b) is a\r\n  logical progression of this reasoning.Â  In keeping with the purpose of the\r\n  statute in conjunction with the weight distribution principle, the General\r\n  Assembly set forth a table in (1)(b) which provides corresponding maximum\r\n  weight loads dependent upon the number of axles and the spacing of these\r\n  axles.Â  In other words, the load of a vehicle may progressively increase with\r\n  the addition of axles and the extension of the distance between these axles.Â  \r\nHowever, a driver may not\r\n  exceed the maximum allowable weight limit merely by adding axles and increasing\r\n  the distances between these axles.Â  Cognizant of the maximum weight that a road\r\n  could withstand, the General Assembly specifically limited the maximum weight\r\n  for any vehicle to 80,000 pounds plus a ten percent scale tolerance of 8,000\r\n  pounds. Â As indicated by the table, the only vehicles authorized to transport\r\n  the maximum 88,000 pound load are those with four to seven axles.Â  \r\nAlthough the General Assembly\r\n  set an ultimate weight limit of 88,000 pounds, it created exceptions to the\r\n  axle-spacing requirements of subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b).Â  These exceptions\r\n  recognize that certain vehicles are uniquely constructed to withstand greater\r\n  weight despite having the identical number of axles as another vehicle.Â  Thus,\r\n  vehicles that satisfy the criteria of these exceptions should not be subject to\r\n  the general weight restriction standards established by subsection (1)(a).Â  \r\nThe State agrees that Respondents,\r\n  at the time of citations, were operating trucks &quot;constructed for special\r\n  type work or use,&quot; which placed the sanitation truck squarely within the\r\n  exception created in subsection (2)(a).Â  As previously stated, subsection\r\n  (2)(a) states that this type of vehicle is:\r\n\r\n  not required to conform to the axle spacing requirements of this\r\n    section. Â However, the vehicle is limited to a weight of twenty thousand pounds\r\n    for each axle plus scale tolerances and the maximum gross weight of these\r\n    vehicles may not exceed the maximum weight allowed by this section for the\r\n    appropriate number of axles, irrespective of the distance between axles, plus\r\n    allowable scale tolerances.Â  Â \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-4140(2)(a) (2006).Â  By the plain terms of the statute, special use trucks\r\n  may carry a load weight of 20,000 pounds per axle plus a ten percent scale\r\n  tolerance.Â  As the statute states, this authorized increase in load weight for\r\n  special use vehicles is not without limitation. Â By drafting the last sentence\r\n  in subsection (2)(a), the General Assembly deliberately &quot;capped&quot; the\r\n  maximum allowable weight of these vehicles at an amount directly proportional\r\n  to the number of axles, irrespective of the distance between the axles.\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals\r\n  correctly determined that this maximum weight restriction is calculated by\r\n  referencing the table in (1)(b) and, not the general standards provided in\r\n  (1)(a).Â  \r\nAssuming that the General\r\n  Assembly purposefully created exceptions to weight restrictions for uniquely\r\n  constructed vehicles, then it would be nonsensical to assess their maximum\r\n  weight limits using the standards applicable to &quot;regular&quot; vehicles.Â  See Dickinson v. Cahoon, 144 So. 345 (Fla. 1932) (analyzing state\r\n  statute regulating weight and speed of motor vehicles and concluding that\r\n  Legislature intended to create a separate classification of certified vehicles\r\n  for the purpose of regulation, supervision, and added taxation).Â  Because\r\n  special use vehicles are constructed to take advantage of increased weight\r\n  limits, their weight loads should not be restricted to those of all general\r\n  vehicles.Â  To do so would completely eliminate the exception created in\r\n  subsection (2)(a).Â  See Commonwealth v. Clyde, 448 A.2d\r\n  1093, 1095 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1982) (affirming dismissal of charges of operating\r\n  an overweight construction vehicle where General Assembly &quot;found it\r\n  necessary to totally exempt such a vehicle from the size and weight restriction&quot;), appeal dismissed as improvidently granted, 467 A.2d 1287 (Pa. 1983). Â \r\nIn view of our interpretation\r\n  of section 56-5-4140, we hold the sanitation truck driven by Respondents did\r\n  not exceed the maximum allowable weight.Â  Reading subsection (2)(a) in\r\n  conjunction with the table in (1)(b), the three-axle vehicle was authorized to\r\n  weigh 66,000 pounds.Â  This amount represents a calculation of 20,000 pounds per\r\n  axle with a ten percent scale tolerance of 6,000 pounds.Â  Significantly, the\r\n  manufacturing information on the door jam of the sanitation truck indicates\r\n  that the vehicle can sustain a weight limit of 66,000 pounds. \r\nHowever, unlike the Court of\r\n  Appeals, we conclude 66,000 pounds is the maximum weight for the three-axle\r\n  sanitation truck not 80,000 pounds plus a ten percent weight tolerance.Â  A\r\n  review of the table in (1)(b) reveals that only vehicles with four to seven\r\n  axles may carry an 88,000 pound maximum load.Â Â  \r\nFinally, we note that the\r\n  General Assembly has twice amended section 56-5-4140 subsequent to the decision\r\n  of the Court of Appeals.Â  As the State points out in its fifth argument, the\r\n  General Assembly amended section 56-5-4140 in 2008.[4]Â \r\n  The State contends this amendment indicates that &quot;the legislature is\r\n  inclined to grant only modest increases in gross vehicle weights through\r\n  amendments.&quot;Â  Additionally, the State claims if the Legislature intended\r\n  the Court of Appeals' interpretation of subsection (2)(a) there would be no\r\n  reason to provide unprocessed forest products hauler's vehicles with an\r\n  increased scale tolerance given they would be already entitled to a maximum\r\n  weight of 88,000 pounds.Â  \r\nWe find this amendment is\r\n  inapposite and does not affect the disposition of the instant case.Â  First, the\r\n  amendment provided nonsubstantive changes in that it renumbered certain\r\n  provisions of section 56-5-4140.Â  Second, the amendment increased the scale\r\n  tolerance for two specific vehicles, those that transport unprocessed forest\r\n  products and those that transport sod, using a &quot;vehicle or trailer.&quot;\r\n  Because the General Assembly did not revise the provision with respect to\r\n  special use vehicles, we disagree with the State that this amendment is\r\n  indicative of the legislative intent.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe would also note that this\r\n  year the General Assembly amended section 56-5-4140(2)(a), the subsection at\r\n  issue in this case.[5] Â Because this amendment became effective after the STP officer issued\r\n  Respondents' citations, we find, and the State conceded, that this amendment\r\n  would not be applicable to facts of the instant case.Â  Accordingly, we express\r\n  no opinion as to the import of this amendment in future cases involving the statute\r\n  at issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough a state agency's enforcement\r\n  of a statute is usually afforded deference, we find the STP incorrectly\r\n  interpreted section 56-5-4140.Â  Considering the purpose of section 56-5-4140\r\n  within the context of the rules of statutory construction, we find subsection\r\n  (2)(a) was promulgated to exempt uniquely designed special use vehicles from\r\n  the general weight restrictions in subsection (1)(a).Â  Because the maximum\r\n  allowable weight for a special use vehicle is &quot;capped&quot; at 88,000 pounds,\r\n  the exception does not permit Respondents to operate the sanitation truck with\r\n  unlimited amounts of weight.Â  Thus, the exception claimed by Respondents is\r\n  legitimate and does not defeat the underlying purpose of the statute to protect\r\n  the infrastructure of the roadways and those travelling on these roadways.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we\r\n  hold the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted section 56-5-4140.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we affirm its decision.Â  However, to the extent the Court of Appeals erred in\r\n  finding that the table in subsection (1)(b) permitted the three-axle sanitation\r\n  truck to carry a maximum weight of 80,000 plus a ten percent scale tolerance, we\r\n  modify its decision to correct this error.[6]\r\nAccordingly, the decision of\r\n  the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nWALLER, ACTING CHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE, and Acting Justices James E. Moore and Timothy Martin Cain, concur.\r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n  JUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majority's decision which affirms\r\n  the Court of Appeals' decision reversing the citations issued to the\r\n  respondents.Â  I write separately, however, because I believe S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-4140(1)(b) is irrelevant to our decision as the sanitation truck did not\r\n  have tandem axles.Â  The relevant provision, in my view, is Â§ 56-5-4140(2)(a).Â \r\n  The dump truck was of a &quot;special type,&quot; and had three axles.Â \r\n  Accordingly, its maximum weight was 66,000 pounds pursuant to that section. [7]Â  \r\nMoreover, I disagree with the\r\n  majority that a vehicle can ever exceed 80,000 pounds under the statute.Â  In my\r\n  view, (2)(a) allows 20,000 pounds per axle up to the maximum allowed under\r\n  either (1)(a) or (1)(b), plus scale tolerances.Â  The ten percent tolerance\r\n  permitted under (1)(a) is capped at 75,185, and no scale tolerance is permitted\r\n  under (1)(b), which sets a maximum weight of 80,000 pounds regardless of the\r\n  number of tandem axles.Â  I therefore disagree with the majority that a vehicle\r\n  could lawfully weigh 88,000 pounds under (1)(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â S.C.

Acts ____ (emphasis added).\r\n[6]Â  In our view, Justice Pleicones misreads section\r\n  56-5-4140(1)(b).Â  Section 56-5-4140(b) does not limit its application to tandem\r\n  axles.Â  Instead, it merely includes an exception for tandem axles.Â  More\r\n  specifically, section 56-5-4140(1)(b) sets forth a formula to be used in\r\n  computing the allowable weight of &quot;any group of two or more consecutive\r\n  axles.&quot;Â  If this phrase referred to tandem axles, then there would be no need\r\n  to create an exception to the formula's application for &quot;tandem\r\n  axles&quot; in the next paragraph.\r\nÂ Â  As for the maximum\r\n  allowable weight, we agree that the language of section 56-5-4140(2)(a) is\r\n  somewhat contradictory.Â  However, it is clear that the section states in part\r\n  that &quot;the maximum gross weight of these vehicles may not exceed the\r\n  maximum weight allowed by this section for the appropriate number of axles . .\r\n  . plus allowable scale tolerances.&quot;Â  Thus, 80,000 pounds plus an 8,000\r\n  pound scale tolerance equals 88,000 pounds.\r\n[7] 3 axles x 20,000 pounds + 6,000 pounds (10%\r\n  scale tolerance). \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
