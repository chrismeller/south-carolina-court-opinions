App. 2005).Â  This Court granted a\r\n  writ of certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We affirm in part\r\n  and vacate in part.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn the\r\n  evening of the shooting, Wharton and a group of friends were at a house playing cards and drinking.Â  Pamela Suber, Whartonâ€™s ex-girlfriend, arrived at the house and began arguing with\r\n  Wharton over Whartonâ€™s new girlfriend.Â  After Suber left, Wharton became\r\n  extremely angry and resisted his friendsâ€™ attempts to calm him.Â  He then made a\r\n  call to another person, in which he stated that â€œI ainâ€™t going to be punked out\r\n  no moreâ€ and instructed the person to bring a weapon to the house.Â  \r\nAt trial, Chraius\r\n  Geter testified that after Wharton made the call, a car arrived at the house.Â  Wharton\r\n  retrieved a gun from inside the car and began walking in the street, swinging\r\n  the gun.Â  Wharton then â€œbumpedâ€ Clifton Shaw, another friend at the house and\r\n  again said â€œI ainâ€™t going to be punked.â€Â  Geter testified that Shaw stated that\r\n  he did not want to fight Wharton, but Wharton â€œswung the gun like was pointing\r\n  to shoot in the airâ€ and the gun fired, fatally hitting Victim.Â  \r\nEdward\r\n  Morris Wharton (Edward) testified that after Suber left, Wharton went into a\r\n  rage and that when Wharton and Shaw began arguing, Victim attempted to prevent\r\n  the two men from fighting.Â  Edward testified that Shaw placed his chain necklace\r\n  down his shirt as if they were about to fight.Â  Wharton then retrieved the\r\n  gun from the car and pulled it out meaning to fire a shot into the air, but\r\n  fatally shot Victim instead.Â  \r\nShawâ€™s\r\n  testimony was consistent with both Edwardâ€™s and Geterâ€™s testimonies.Â  However,\r\n  Shaw added that when Wharton retrieved the gun from the car, the gun was\r\n  wrapped in a shirt and that Wharton pulled it out from the shirt into the air\r\n  when it discharged.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court charged the jury on possession of a weapon during the commission of\r\n  a violent crime, murder, and, over Whartonâ€™s objection, voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  He denied Whartonâ€™s request for an involuntary manslaughter and\r\n  accident charge.Â  The jury found Wharton guilty of voluntary manslaughter and\r\n  weapons possession.Â  The court of appeals reversed and held that the trial\r\n  court erred in charging voluntary manslaughter because there was no evidence of\r\n  sufficient legal provocation on behalf of Victim and that transferred intent\r\n  does not apply to voluntary manslaughter.Â  The court went on to hold that even\r\n  if transferred intent applied, there was no evidence of sufficient legal\r\n  provocation on the part of Shaw.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari, and the State\r\n  presents the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err\r\n  holding there was no evidence of sufficient legal provocation?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in\r\n  holding the doctrine of transferred intent does not apply to voluntary\r\n  manslaughter?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWharton\r\n  also filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  We granted Whartonâ€™s petition,\r\n  and Wharton presents the following issues for review:Â  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in refusing to charge the \r\n\t\t\tjury on involuntary manslaughter?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in holding the \r\n\t\t\tdoctrine of transferred intent does not apply to voluntary \r\n\t\t\tmanslaughter?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of\r\n  law only. Â State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â \r\n  A trial courtâ€™s decision regarding jury charges will not be reversed where the charges,\r\n  as a whole, properly charged the law to be applied. Â State v. Rye, 375\r\n  S.C. 119, 123, 651 S.E.2d 321, 323 (2007).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nStateâ€™s Issues\r\nI. Sufficient\r\n  Legal Provocation\r\nThe State argues that the court of appeals erred in\r\n  holding that there was no evidence of sufficient legal provocation warranting a\r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  We disagree.\r\nVoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human\r\n  being in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.Â  State v. Pittman, 373\r\n  S.C. 527, 572, 647 S.E.2d 144, 167 (2007).Â \r\n  The sudden heat of passion, upon sufficient legal provocation, while it need\r\n  not dethrone reason entirely, or shut out knowledge and volition, must be such\r\n  as would naturally disturb the sway of reason, and render the mind of an\r\n  ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and produce what, according to\r\n  human experience, may be called an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.Â  Id.Â  To warrant the court in eliminating the offense of manslaughter it should very\r\n  clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime\r\n  from murder to manslaughter.Â  Id. at 572, 647 S.E.2d at 168.\r\nIn our\r\n  view, there is no evidence in\r\n  the record of sufficient legal provocation.Â  Testimony showed that Wharton was\r\n  in a rage after his argument with Suber and that several people were trying to\r\n  calm him.Â  After attempts to calm him failed, Wharton deliberately instructed\r\n  someone to bring him a gun, despite there being no threat of another person\r\n  with a weapon.Â  There was no evidence showing Victim provoked Wharton, and\r\n  although there was evidence that Wharton and Shaw argued and exchanged words,\r\n  there was no evidence Shaw posed a threat to Wharton either by possessing a\r\n  weapon or through hostile acts.Â  See State v. Byrd, 323\r\n  S.C. 319, 322, 474 S.E.2d 430, 432 (1996)\r\n  (holding that where death is caused by the use of a deadly\r\n  weapon, words alone, however opprobrious, are not sufficient to constitute a\r\n  legal provocation, but words accompanied by hostile acts may, according to the\r\n  circumstances, reduce a charge from murder to voluntary manslaughter).Â  \r\nWhile Wharton may have been in a rage and acting under a sudden\r\n  heat of passion, there is no evidence of sufficient legal provocation.Â  See\r\n    Pittman, 373 S.C. at 573, 647 S.E.2d at 168 (recognizing that both heat of\r\n  passion and sufficient legal provocation must be present at the time of the\r\n  killing).Â  Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in charging the jury\r\n  on voluntary manslaughter.\r\nII. Transferred Intent\r\nThe State\r\n  argues that the court of appeals erred in holding that the doctrine of\r\n  transferred intent was inapplicable to voluntary manslaughter.Â  We decline to\r\n  address this issue.Â  \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Childers, 373 S.C. 367, 645 S.E.2d 233\r\n  (2007), the plurality of this Court held that the doctrine of transferred\r\n  intent was not applicable to voluntary manslaughter cases because the overt act\r\n  that produces the sudden heat of passion must come from the victim.Â  However,\r\n  the dissent would have held that if a defendant kills an unintentional victim\r\n  upon sufficient legal provocation committed by a third party, the doctrine of\r\n  transferred intent applies, entitling the defendant to a voluntary manslaughter\r\n  charge.Â  \r\nIn this case, the court of appeals held that the trial court erred\r\n  in charging the jury on voluntary manslaughter because there was no evidence of\r\n  sufficient legal provocation and because transferred intent does not apply to\r\n  voluntary manslaughter.Â  We find, however, that Childers was not a\r\n  majority opinion, and the applicability of the doctrine of transferred intent to\r\n  voluntary manslaughter cases where the defendant kills an unintended\r\n  victim upon sufficient legal provocation committed by a third party remains an\r\n  unsettled question in South Carolina.Â  However, because we find no evidence of\r\n  sufficient legal provocation by a third party in this case, we need not address\r\n  this issue.Â  We therefore vacate the portion of the court of appealsâ€™ opinion\r\n  addressing this issue.Â  \r\nWhartonâ€™s Issues\r\nI. Involuntary Manslaughter\r\nPetitioner argues\r\n  the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the jury on involuntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  We disagree.\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is (1) the unintentional killing of another without malice, but while\r\n  engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or great\r\n  bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional killing of another without malice, while\r\n  engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety of others.Â  State v. Chatman, 336 S.C. 149, 152, 519 S.E.2d 100, 101 (1999).Â  If there is any evidence warranting a\r\n  charge on involuntary manslaughter, then the charge must be given.Â  State v. Reese, 370\r\n  S.C. 31, 36, 633 S.E.2d 898, 900 (2006).\r\nIn our\r\n  view, there is no evidence supporting an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  Even\r\n  assuming Wharton did not intentionally fire the gun at Shaw, by pointing the\r\n  gun and waiving it in the air, Wharton committed an unlawful act that would naturally\r\n  tend to cause death or great bodily harm.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court\r\n  properly denied his request for an involuntary manslaughter charge.\r\nII. Accident\r\nWharton argues the trial court erred in\r\n  refusing to charge the jury on the law of accident.Â  We disagree.\r\nFor a homicide to be excusable on the ground of accident, it must\r\n  be shown that the killing was unintentional, the defendant was acting lawfully,\r\n  and due care was exercised in the handling of the weapon.Â  State v. Burriss, 334\r\n  S.C. 256, 259, 513 S.E.2d 104, 106 (1999). Â Evidence\r\n  of an accidental discharge of a gun will support a charge of accident where the\r\n  defendant lawfully arms himself in self-defense.Â  Tisdale v.\r\n    State, 378 S.C. 122, 126, 662 S.E.2d\r\n  410, 412 (2008).\r\nThere\r\n  is no evidence in the record to support an accident charge.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Wharton was not acting lawfully in waiving the gun in the air, nor did he\r\n  exercise due care in handling the weapon.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence he\r\n  was lawfully armed in self-defense.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\r\n  properly denied Whartonâ€™s request for a charge on the law of accident.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court properly\r\n  denied Whartonâ€™s request to charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter and\r\n  accident, but that the trial court erred in charging the jury on voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  Furthermore, we vacate the portion of the court of appeals\r\n  opinion regarding the doctrine of transferred intent in regard to voluntary\r\n  manslaughter.Â  Accordingly, we affirm in part and vacate in part the court of\r\n  appealsâ€™ decision.Â  \r\nWALLER, PLEICONES,\r\n  JJ., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and Dorothy Mobley Jones, concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26575","title":"Richardson v.

Young, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER:Â   We granted petitionersâ€™\r\n  request for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Richardson\r\n    v. Donald Hawkins Constr., Inc., 370 S.C. 125, 634 S.E.2d 9 (Ct. App.\r\n2006).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioners\r\n  James and Karolina Richardson purchased a house from respondents Donald Hawkins Construction and Donald\r\n  Hawkins in 1999. After moving in, petitioners\r\n  noticed several cosmetic and structural problems with the house. Â Initially,\r\n  respondents sent a representative to repair the problems, but as the problems\r\n  persisted, respondents stopped responding to petitionersâ€™ service requests. Â In\r\n  February 2001, petitioners retained legal counsel who contacted respondents by\r\n  letter about completing the home repairs.Â  Counselâ€™s letter demanded a response\r\n  by March 7, 2001; respondents never answered the letter.\r\nOn March 12, 2001, petitionersâ€™\r\n  residence was severely damaged by a fire that investigators concluded was\r\n  intentionally set.\r\nOn\r\n  May 21, 2002, the police questioned Joseph Taylor about the arson.Â  Taylor, an\r\n  employee of respondent Hawkins, gave the police a written statement in which he\r\n  claimed to have overheard Hawkins ask another coworker, James Hodge, to burn\r\n  down petitionersâ€™ house because petitioners were threatening to sue him due to\r\n  the problems with the house (â€œStatement Oneâ€). Â Â According to Statement One, Hodge\r\n  later told him Hawkins offered him $2,000 to burn the house down; a few days\r\n  later, Taylor learned that Hodge had set the fire but had not succeeded in\r\n  burning the entire house down.\r\n\r\nDue\r\n  to investigatorsâ€™ suspicions that Taylor was more involved in the arson than he\r\n  revealed in Statement One, he was interviewed again later that afternoon. Â Following\r\n  this interview, Taylor submitted another written statement to the police (â€œStatement\r\n  Twoâ€). Â In Statement Two, Taylor admitted that Hawkins approached both him and Hodge and offered them $2,000 to burn down petitionersâ€™ house. Â While Taylor acted as lookout, Hodge crawled under the house and ignited a jug filled with\r\n  flammable liquid. Â The following day, Hodge told Taylor that, because the house\r\n  was not completely destroyed, Hawkins gave him only $1,000. Â Taylor claimed he did\r\n  not get any money for his role as lookout.Â  \r\nTwo\r\n  days after giving the police the written statements, Taylor wrote and signed\r\n  the following statement (â€œStatement Threeâ€) before two witnesses and a notary:\r\n\r\n  I Joseph\r\n    Taylor has [sic] never been paid by Donnie Hawkins for doing anything illeagle\r\n    [sic]. Â Donnie paided [sic] me for subcontracting carpentry work only. Â I have\r\n    never heard or seen him pay anyone to do anything illeagle [sic]! Â \r\n\r\nAccording\r\n  to Taylorâ€™s mother, Sharon Preu, Taylor visited her shortly after being\r\n  questioned by the police and told her that the statements he had made to police\r\n  were â€œall a lie.â€ Â During trial, Preuâ€™s testimony was proffered.Â  Preu stated\r\n  that Taylor told her the police â€œhad him in Sumter all day long and ... cussed\r\n  at him.â€ Â According to Preu, Taylor said he was promised no jail time if he confessed,\r\n  so he told police that he â€œand Mr. Hodge had done it and that it was all a lie,\r\n  that they had offered him two years probation if he was to go along with it.â€Â (â€œStatement Fourâ€).\r\nPetitioners consented to having\r\n  all criminal charges regarding the arson dropped in order to pursue a civil\r\n  case. Â Thereafter, a civil suit was filed against Taylor, Hodge, Hawkins, and\r\n  Donald Hawkins Construction, Inc. Â Taylor was served a summons and complaint, but he failed to\r\n  file an answer. Â In May 2003, petitioners filed an affidavit\r\n  of default as to defendant Taylor. Â In January 2004, before the case went to\r\n  trial, Taylor died in an unrelated automobile accident.\r\nIn\r\n  September 2004, the trial court ruled on several pre-trial matters, including\r\n  the admissibility of Statements One, Two, and Three. Â First, the trial court\r\n  ruled on the status of petitionersâ€™ case against Taylorâ€™s estate, represented\r\n  after his death by Preu. Â The trial court found that Taylorâ€™s default prior to\r\n  his death put the estate in the procedural posture of having admitted all of\r\n  the allegations contained in the complaint. Â As to Statements One and Two, the\r\n  court found them admissible against the remaining defendants under the\r\n  statements against interest exception to hearsay described in Rule 804(b)(3),\r\n  SCRE.[1] Â As to Statement Three, however, the circuit court excluded\r\n  Taylorâ€™s own written statement under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The circuit court\r\n  concluded that the probative value of the written statement was substantially\r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice because, due to his default, Taylor was deemed to have admitted all allegations in the complaint.[2]\r\nAt trial,\r\n  the defense proffered the testimony of Preu concerning Taylorâ€™s statements to\r\n  her after he had been questioned by police (i.e., Statement Four). Â Petitioners\r\n  objected on hearsay grounds, and the trial court found the statement did not\r\n  fall within a hearsay exception.Â  The trial court further stated that Taylorâ€™s statements to Preu simply were denials of his involvement in the arson and thus, ruled\r\n  them inadmissible.\r\nAt\r\n  the conclusion of trial, the jury found the defendants liable and awarded petitioners\r\n  $84,758 in actual damages and $150,000 in punitive damages against Hawkins\r\n  Construction; $5,500 in actual damages and $5,000 in punitive damages against\r\n  Hodge; and $5,500 in actual damages and $250,000 in punitive damages against\r\n  Hawkins.[3] Â The jury did not award petitioners any damages\r\n  against Taylorâ€™s estate. \r\nOnly\r\n  Respondents Donald Hawkins Construction, Inc. and Hawkins appealed from the juryâ€™s\r\n  verdict.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial.\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals based its reversal on Rule 806, SCRE.[4]Â  Because Taylorâ€™s first two statements were admitted under hearsay rules\r\n  801 and 804, the Court of Appeals concluded that â€œ[p]ursuant to Rule 806 and\r\n  basic concepts of fairness,â€ the defense should have been allowed to impeach Taylor with evidence that was inconsistent with Statements One and Two.Â  Richardson,\r\n  370 S.C. at 130, 634 S.E.2d at 12.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    Court of Appeals err in reversing the trial courtâ€™s decision to exclude\r\n    Taylorâ€™s Statements Three and Four?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding Statements Three\r\n  and Four inadmissible, and therefore the Court of Appeals erred by reversing\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision to exclude the evidence.Â  We agree.\r\nEvidence\r\n  is relevant and admissible if it has any tendency to make the existence of any\r\n  fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or\r\n  less probable than it would be without the evidence. Â Rules 401, 402, SCRE.Â  Relevant\r\n  evidence may be excluded, however, â€œif its probative value is substantially\r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\r\n  misleading the jury.â€Â Rule 403,\r\n  SCRE. \r\nIt\r\n  is well settled that the admission and rejection of testimony is largely within\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion,\r\n  the exercise of which will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Â E.g., Pike v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of\r\n    Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92&nbsp;(2000)\r\nIn\r\n  our opinion, it was within the trial courtâ€™s discretion to exclude Taylorâ€™s Statements Three and Four pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE.Â  In its pretrial Rule 403\r\n  ruling, the trial court noted the unusual procedural posture of the case because\r\n  of defendant Taylorâ€™s default.Â  The trial court found that because Taylor was considered to have admitted the allegations of the complaint, his statements denying\r\n  the same allegations would be unduly prejudicial.Â  Likewise, the trial court\r\n  excluded Statement Four in part because it amounted to a denial of the\r\n  allegations that were already deemed admitted by Taylor.Â  The trial court\r\n  clearly believed that by admitting these statements, the jury would have been\r\n  misled and/or confused on the issues presented, and therefore, the court properly\r\n  excluded them.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE; see also Rule 220, SCACR\r\n  (this Court may affirm any ruling based upon any ground appearing in the\r\n  record).Â  Given the factual and procedural circumstances of the instant case,\r\n  we hold the trial court did not err in this determination.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion\r\n  in excluding Taylorâ€™s Statements Three and Four.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ decision, and reinstate the juryâ€™s verdict, as modified by\r\n  post-trial order.[5]\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice Larry B.

The circuit court found Statement One admissible as\r\n  a statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and furtherance of\r\n  a conspiracy pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(E), SCRE.Â  The circuit court upheld its\r\n  ruling in limine on Statement Two, admitting the statement under the\r\n  statement against interest exception to hearsay.\r\n[2] For example, the Complaint specifically alleged that\r\n  Hawkins agreed to pay Hodge and Taylor $2,000 to burn down petitionersâ€™ house.\r\n[3] By post-trial order, the punitive damages award\r\n  against Hawkins was reduced from $250,000 to $49,500.\r\n[4] Rule 806 provides:\r\n\r\n  When a\r\n    hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Rule 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E) has\r\n    been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked,\r\n    and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for\r\n    those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.Â  Evidence of a\r\n    statement or conduct by the declarant at any time, inconsistent with the\r\n    declarantâ€™s hearsay statement, is not subject to any requirement that the\r\n    declarant may have been afforded an opportunity to deny or explain.\r\n\r\n[5] See footnote 3, supra.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26592","title":"Gay v.

Code Ann. Â§ 22-5-920(2007).Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the court err\r\n  in ruling Gay was ineligible for expungement?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  22-5-920(B) permits a defendant who was convicted as a youthful offender to\r\n  apply for an expungement, stating, in part: \r\n\r\n\tFollowing a first offense conviction as a youthful offender, the defendant after\r\n  fifteen years from the date of the conviction may apply, or cause someone\r\n  acting on his behalf to apply, to the circuit court for an order expunging the\r\n  records of the arrest and conviction. However, this section does not apply to\r\n  an offense involving. . .Â  to an offense classified as a violent crime in\r\n  Section 16-1-60,[1].\r\n  . . . If the defendant has had no other conviction during the fifteen year\r\n  period following the first offense conviction as a youthful offender, the\r\n  circuit court may issue an order expunging the records. . . .\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-19-10 defines â€œyouthful offenderâ€ as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\td)\r\n  â€œYouthful offenderâ€ means an offender who is: \r\n\t(ii) seventeen\r\n  but less than twenty five years of age at the time of conviction for an offense\r\n  that is not a violent crime, as defined in Section 16-1-60, and that is a\r\n  misdemeanor. . . . \r\n\t(f)\r\n  â€œConvictionâ€ means a judgment in a verdict or finding of guilty, plea of guilty,\r\n  or plea of nolo contendere to a criminal charge where the imprisonment\r\n  is at least one year, but excluding all offenses in which the maximum\r\n  punishment provided by law is death or life imprisonment.Â  (Emphasis\r\n  supplied).Â  \r\n\r\nGay contends he was a â€œyouthful\r\n  offenderâ€ at the time of his plea in 1990, such that SLED and the circuit court\r\n  erred in ruling he was ineligible to be considered for expungement.Â  The state\r\n  contends that because Gay was sentenced as an adult, he is ineligible for\r\n  expungement under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-5-920(B).Â  We disagree.Â Â  Under the clear\r\n  and unambiguous terms of the statute, Gay was convicted as a â€œyouthful\r\n  offenderâ€ and was therefore entitled to have his application for expungement\r\n  considered.[2] \r\nIn interpreting\r\n  statutes, the Court looks to the plain meaning of the statute and the intent of\r\n  the Legislature.Â  State v. Dingle, 376 S.C. 643, 659 S.E.2d 101(2008).Â \r\n  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the maxim that\r\n  legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the\r\n  language used.Â  State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647 S.E.2d 144 (2007), cert.\r\n    denied 128 S.Ct. 1872 (2008).Â  A statuteâ€™s language must be construed in\r\n  light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  If possible, legislative intent\r\n  should be found in the plain language of the statute itself.Â  If a statuteâ€™s\r\n  language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning,\r\n  the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the Court has no right\r\n  to impose another meaning.Â  State v. Gaines, 380 S.C. 23, 667 S.E.2d 728\r\n  (2008).\r\nHere, the statutes\r\n  permit a â€œyouthful offender,â€ i.e., one who is seventeen but less than twenty\r\n  five years of age at the time of conviction, who has â€œpled guiltyâ€ to an\r\n  offense which is not a violent crime, and which was both a first offense and a\r\n  misdemeanor, to apply for an order expunging the records of the arrest and\r\n  conviction.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-19-10 and Â§ 22-5-920(B).Â  Gay meets these requirements.Â  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-19-50 is entitled â€œPowers of courts upon conviction of youthful\r\n  offenders.â€Â Â  It provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIn the\r\n  event of a conviction of a youthful offender the court may: \r\n\t(1) suspend\r\n  the sentence and place the youthful offender on probation; \r\n\t(2)\r\n  release the youthful offender to the custody of the division before sentencing\r\n  for an observation and evaluation period of not more than sixty days.Â  The\r\n  observation and evaluation must be conducted by the Reception and Evaluation\r\n  Center operating under joint agreement between the Department of Vocational\r\n  Rehabilitation and the Department of Corrections and the findings and\r\n  recommendations for sentencing must be returned with the youthful offender to\r\n  the court for sentencing; \r\n\t(3) if\r\n  the offender is under the age of twenty one, without his consent, sentence the\r\n  youthful offender indefinitely to the custody of the department for treatment\r\n  and supervision pursuant to this chapter until discharged by the division, the\r\n  period of custody not to exceed six years.Â  If the offender is twenty one years\r\n  of age but less than twenty five years of age, he may be sentenced in\r\n  accordance with this item if he consents in writing; \r\n\t(4) if\r\n  the court finds that the youthful offender will not derive benefit from\r\n  treatment, may sentence the youthful offender under any other applicable\r\n  penalty provision.Â  The youthful offender must be placed in the custody of the\r\n  department; \r\n\t(5) not\r\n  sentence a youthful offender more than once under this chapter.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).Â  The\r\n  clear import of the above statute is that a person who meets the definition of\r\n  â€œyouthful offenderâ€ is â€œconvictedâ€ regardless of the manner of sentencing, and\r\n  is eligible to apply for expungement if the requirements of Â§ 22-5-920(b) are\r\n  met.\r\nThe state contends\r\n  Gay is ineligible for expungement because he was not sentenced as a\r\n  youthful offender but as an adult.Â  Contrary to the stateâ€™s contention, S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 22-5-920(B) requires only that one be convicted as a\r\n  youthful offender.Â  Under the literal terms of the statute, Gay was convicted as a â€œyouthful offender.â€Â  \r\nIn Creel v.\r\n  State, 262 S.C. 558, 564, 206 S.E.2d 825, 828 (1974), we held â€œa person\r\n  between the ages of seventeen and twenty-five is, by definition, a youthful\r\n  offender and must be sentenced pursuant to that Act.Â  The trial judge must\r\n  sentence the youthful offender under one of the subsections of Section 55-395\r\n  (the predecessor to S.C. Code Ann. 24-19-50).â€Â  Although a trial judge has\r\n  discretion to impose sanctions which are â€œoutsideâ€ the YOA, see Â§\r\n  24-19-50(4), the sentencing nonetheless takes place pursuant to the provisions\r\n  of Â§ 24-19-50 of the YOA.Â  \r\nThe state relies on Brown v. State, 265 S.C. 516, 220 S.E.2d 125 (1975), cert. denied 426 U.S. 939 (1976), in which the Court found it implicit the trial judge had\r\n  found the defendant would receive no benefit from a YOA sentence.Â  Brown is immaterial to the issue of whether or not an individual who meets the\r\n  statutory definition of â€œyouthful offenderâ€ is eligible for expungement under Â§\r\n  22-5-920(B).Â  \r\nWe find the\r\n  Legislature, in enacting Â§ 22-5-920(B), reasonably concluded that persons who\r\n  had been convicted of non-violent, misdemeanor offenses at a young age (between\r\n  17-25), and who had committed no subsequent offenses over the course of the\r\n  next fifteen years, were entitled to be considered for an expungement.Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court\r\n  erred in ruling Gay was ineligible to have his application for expungement\r\n  considered.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is reversed.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â ABHAN is not listed as a violent crime in Â§\r\n  16-1-60.Â  See State v. Rogers, 338 S.C. 435, 527 S.E.2 101\r\n  (2000).Â  ABHAN is a common law misdemeanor punishable by up to ten years in\r\n  prison.Â  State v. Morris, 371 S.C. 278, 639 S.E.2d 53 (2006).Â  \r\n[2] Â The mere fact that Gay is entitled to have his\r\n  application considered does not mean expungement necessarily follows; Gay\r\n  concedes expungement is a privilege and not a right.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26593","title":"Dykeman v.

Â In this case, we must answer whether the mortgagorâ€™s compliance\r\n  with the â€œborrowerâ€™s responsibilitiesâ€ set by the mortgagee constituted an\r\n  affirmative request from the mortgagor.Â  The circuit court answered in the\r\n  negative and granted the mortgagee summary judgment.Â  We affirm.\r\nI.\r\nIn\r\n  June of 2000, William and Leslie Dykeman purchased property in Beaufort County, South Carolina by executing a purchase-money mortgage in favor of Wells\r\n  Fargo.Â  In February of 2002, the Dykemans refinanced the loan with Wells Fargo.Â \r\n  Wells Fargo provided to the Dykemansâ€™ closing attorney certain documents which\r\n  set forth the â€œborrowerâ€™s responsibilities.â€ Â These documents included a\r\n  transmittal form, a payment coupon, and a complete payoff amount.Â  Part of the\r\n  payoff amount (five dollars) was a payment for â€œrecording fees.â€\r\nThe\r\n  Dykemans complied with the â€œborrowerâ€™s responsibilitiesâ€ by completing the\r\n  forms and paying the amount submitted by Wells Fargo, including the five dollar\r\n  recording fee.Â  A check (for the payoff) was mailed to Wells Fargo on or about\r\n  February 28, 2002.Â  The record does not contain a cover letter from the\r\n  Dykemansâ€™ counsel to Wells Fargo, as typically occurs as part of the real\r\n  estate closing process.[1]Â \r\n  In any event, Wells Fargo acknowledged receipt of the payment and documentation\r\n  pursuant to the â€œborrowerâ€™s responsibilities.â€\r\nWells\r\n  Fargo did not record the mortgage satisfaction until July 16, 2002, by filing a\r\n  lost mortgage satisfaction with the Beaufort County Register of Deeds.Â  The\r\n  record discloses that the Dykemansâ€™ closing attorney wrote Wells Fargo about a\r\n  month earlier on June 27, 2002, specifically citing to sections 29-3-310 and\r\n  320 and noting that Wells Fargo â€œmay already be liable for the statutory\r\n  penalty.â€ Â Because the mortgage satisfaction was not entered within three\r\n  months after Wells Fargoâ€™s receipt of the mortgage payment and payoff fee, the\r\n  Dykemans brought this statutory claim against Wells Fargo.[2]Â \r\n  Pursuant to cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted\r\n  judgment for Wells Fargo.Â  The Dykemans appealed, which is before us pursuant\r\n  to Rule 204 (b), SCACR, certification.\r\nII.\r\nWe set forth the\r\n  relevant statutory sections requiring the recording of a satisfaction.Â  Section\r\n  29-3-310 provides:\r\n\r\n\tAny\r\n  holder of record of a mortgage who\r\n    has received full payment or satisfaction or to whom a legal tender has\r\n  been made of his debts, damages, costs, and charges secured by mortgage of real\r\n  estate shall, at the request by certified mail or other form of delivery\r\n    with a proof of delivery of the mortgagor or of his legal representative or\r\n  any other person being a creditor of the debtor or a purchaser under him or\r\n  having an interest in any estate bound by the mortgage and on tender of the\r\n  fees of office for entering satisfaction, within three months after the certified mail, or other form of delivery, with a proof of delivery, \r\n\trequest\r\n    is made, enter satisfaction in the proper office on the mortgage which\r\n  shall forever thereafter discharge and satisfy the mortgage.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).\r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  29-3-320 provides:\r\n\tAny\r\n  holder of record of a mortgage having received such payment, satisfaction, or\r\n  tender as aforesaid who shall\r\n    not, by himself or his attorney, within three months after such certified mail, or other form of delivery, with a proof of delivery, \r\n\trequest and tender of fees of office, repair to the proper office and enter\r\n      satisfaction as aforesaid shall forfeit and pay to the person aggrieved\r\n        a sum of money not exceeding one-half of the amount of the debt secured by the\r\n        mortgage, or twenty-five thousand dollars, whichever is less, plus actual\r\n        damages, costs, and attorneyâ€™s fees in the discretion of the court, to be\r\n  recovered by action in any court of competent jurisdiction within the State.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nSections 29-3-310\r\n  and 320 are penal statutes.Â  Penal statutes must be strictly construed.Â  Bostic\r\n    v. Am. Home Mortg. Servicing, Inc., 375 S.C. 143, 149, 650 S.E.2d 479, 482\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (â€œSouth Carolina has long recognized the principle that penal\r\n  statutes are to be strictly construed.â€).Â  The Court of Appeals in Rorrer v.\r\n    P.J. Club, Inc., 347 S.C. 560, 567, 556 S.E.2d 726, 730 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n  expounded:\r\n\r\n\tThe rule\r\n  that penal statutes, as contradistinguished from remedial statutes, must be\r\n  construed strictly, is but a means of arriving at the intention. Â When a law\r\n  imposes a punishment which acts upon the offender alone, and not as a\r\n  reparation to the party injured, and when it is entirely within the discretion\r\n  of the lawgiver, it will not be presumed that he intended it should be extended\r\n  further than is expressed; and humanity would require that it should be so\r\n  limited in the construction as to be certain not to exceed the intention.\r\n\r\nFurther, the statute as a\r\n  whole must be examined to determine and fulfill the Legislatureâ€™s intent.Â  Sloan\r\n    v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  606-07 (2006) (â€œA statute as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and\r\n  fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of\r\n  lawmakers.â€).\r\nIn Bostic,\r\n  the Court of Appeals interpreted sections 29-3-310 and 320 to determine what\r\n  constitutes a â€œrequest,â€ sufficient to render the mortgagee statutorily liable.\r\n  Â 375 S.C. at 154, 650 S.E.2d at 485. Â The facts in Bostic are similar to\r\n  those before us.Â  Bostic â€œobtained a statement [from the mortgagee] for the\r\n  payoff amount on the loan, which . . . included a â€˜release feeâ€™ and a\r\n  â€˜recording fee.â€™â€ Â Id. at 145, 650 S.E.2d at 480.Â  Bostic sent the funds\r\n  to the mortgagee which acknowledged receipt, but the mortgage was not satisfied\r\n  of record within the statutory three-month period.Â  Id.Â  Bostic, through\r\n  counsel, then sent a certified letter to the mortgagee to two separate\r\n  addresses.Â  Id.Â  The certified letter referenced the statute and\r\n  demanded the statutory penalty.Â  Id. at 145-46, 650 S.E.2d at 480.\r\nBostic\r\n  filed suit against the mortgagee seeking the statutory penalty and related\r\n  relief.Â  Id. at 146, 650 S.E.2d at 480.Â  The trial court granted Bostic\r\n  summary judgment, but the Court of Appeals reversed.Â  Id. at 144-45, 650\r\n  S.E.2d at 480.Â  The Court of Appeals determined that under the applicable\r\n  statutory scheme, as a matter of law, Bostic failed to make an affirmative\r\n  request to have his mortgage recorded as satisfied.Â  Id. at 156, 650\r\n  S.E.2d at 486.Â  The Bostic court interpreted the element of a request as\r\n  a condition precedent to statutory relief.Â  Id. at 150, 650 S.E.2d at\r\n  483.Â  In this regard, sending the payoff check to the mortgagee did not\r\n  constitute a â€œrequestâ€ within the meaning of the statute.Â  Id. at 155,\r\n  650 S.E.2d at 485.\r\nWe agree\r\n  with the Bostic courtâ€™s determination that our Legislature intended a request,\r\n  under the penal statutory framework, â€œoperate to inform the mortgagee of the\r\n  mortgagorâ€™s desire for the satisfied mortgage to be recorded.â€Â  Id. at 154, 650 S.E.2d at 485. Â For liability to attach under the applicable\r\n  statutes, payment of the mortgage is â€œonly the first step in the mortgage\r\n  satisfaction process.Â  In order for Bostic to recover the statutory penalty\r\n  under section 29-3-320, he had to satisfy the condition precedent of making a\r\n  â€˜requestâ€™ for [the mortgagee] to record his mortgage as satisfied.â€Â  Id.Â  A request, to trigger the statutory penalty, may not be implied or inferred. Â Id. at 155, 650 S.E.2d at 486.Â  The request must affirmatively convey to the\r\n  mortgagee that a recording of the satisfaction is sought.[3]Â  Id.\r\nThe Dykemansâ€™ claim under the\r\n  applicable penal statutory framework similarly fails for lack of an affirmative\r\n  request to have the mortgage recorded as satisfied.Â  The Dykemans may have\r\n  entertained a reasonable expectation that Wells Fargo would satisfy the\r\n  mortgage of record following the payoff.Â  That expectation, however, was\r\n  unstated.Â  Because of the windfall nature of the statutory penalty, we are\r\n  persuaded the Legislature did not intend to invoke the statutory penalty in the\r\n  absence of a clear, affirmative request.Â  The Court of Appeals spoke directly\r\n  to this in Kinard v. Fleet Real Estate Funding Corp., 319 S.C. 408, 412,\r\n  461 S.E.2d 833, 835 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The court in Kinard described two\r\n  statutory interpretation principles, in the context of the applicable statutory\r\n  scheme, when it stated, â€œthe proposition that penal\r\n  statutes must be strictly construed, especially when the penalty may result in\r\n  a windfall to a plaintiffâ€ and â€œthe proposition that the requirements of a\r\n  penal statute must be applied in a manner which results in fairness and justice\r\n  to the parties.â€Â  Id.Â  A fair and balanced consideration of this penal\r\n  statutory scheme leads us to conclude that an implied request does not satisfy sections\r\n  29-3-310 and 320.[4]\r\nWe hold that section 29-3-310 requires the following elements be\r\n  established by the mortgagor to trigger the substantial penalty and related\r\n  relief in section 29-3-320: (1) that he has made full payment of his â€œdebts,â€\r\n  including any applicable â€œdamages, costs, and chargesâ€; (2) that he has made a\r\n  â€œrequest by certified mail or other form of deliveryâ€[5] that the mortgage be satisfied of\r\n  record; (3) that he has made a â€œtender of fees of office for entering\r\n  satisfactionâ€; and (4) that the mortgagee has failed to â€œenter satisfaction in\r\n  the proper office on the mortgageâ€ within three months of the request.[6]\r\nIII.\r\nBecause the Dykemans have failed to establish the\r\n  element of a request under sections 29-3-310 and 320, the trial court properly\r\n  entered summary judgment for Wells Fargo.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Following\r\n  a real estate refinancing, the standard cover letter from a closing attorney to\r\n  the holder of the mortgage usually includes the payment due on the debt and any\r\n  fee necessary to enter a satisfaction of the mortgage in the proper office.Â \r\n  Such standard cover letters may include an affirmative request that the\r\n  mortgagee cause a satisfaction to be entered of record.Â  We recognize, however,\r\n  that in some circumstances, the mortgagee may enlist the closing attorney to\r\n  accomplish the task of ensuring that the mortgage satisfaction is properly\r\n  entered.Â  See Kinard v. Fleet Real Estate Funding Corp., 319 S.C.\r\n  408, 410, 461 S.E.2d 833, 834 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\n[2]&nbsp; This action was brought by the Dykemans â€œon\r\n  behalf of themselves and those similarly situated.â€\r\n[3]&nbsp; Bostic additionally involved an allegation of telephone conversations between the\r\n  parties shortly after the payoff check was mailed.Â  Id. at 155, 650\r\n  S.E.2d at 485.Â  It appears the record was scant in this regard, and the court\r\n  declined to conclude for summary judgment purposes that these purported phone\r\n  conversations be construed as a â€œrequest.â€Â  Id. at 155-56, 650 S.E.2d at\r\n  485-86.Â  In the case before us, the Dykemans rely exclusively on their\r\n  compliance with the â€œborrowerâ€™s responsibilitiesâ€ document furnished by Wells\r\n  Fargo. Â (As alleged in the Dykemansâ€™ second amended complaint, â€œ[t]he payment\r\n  and delivery of the $5.00 fee by [the Dykemans] . . . pursuant to [Wells\r\n  Fargoâ€™s] demand therefore as a condition to filing a satisfaction of mortgage\r\n  constituted a request.â€)Â  We therefore do not reach the question whether a\r\n  verbal request could be sufficient.\r\n[4]&nbsp; We\r\n  do not suggest that a mortgageeâ€™s conduct is irrelevant in analyzing a\r\n  mortgagorâ€™s compliance with the section 29-3-310 elements.Â  Kinard illustrates this point.Â  319 S.C. at 412-13, 461 S.E.2d at 835 (holding the\r\n  mortgagorâ€™s remittal of fees to the mortgagorâ€™s attorney constituted a tender of\r\n  fees under the statute because the mortgagee agreed to have the attorney record\r\n  the satisfaction).Â  Thus, there may be situations when a mortgagor may properly\r\n  rely on the conduct of a mortgage company to support the finding of a request\r\n  under section 29-3-310.Â  We hold the record before us does not present such a\r\n  situation.\r\n[5]&nbsp; Section\r\n  29-3-310 was amended in 1999 to include the requirement that the request be\r\n  accomplished â€œby certified mail or other form of delivery with a proof of delivery\r\n  . . . .â€\r\n[6]&nbsp; This case, of course, has drawn our attention\r\n  to the request element.Â  As discussed, the mortgagor must make the request, and\r\n  under the facts presented, we do not imply a request by the mortgagor from the\r\n  mortgageeâ€™s representations in the â€œborrowerâ€™s responsibilitiesâ€ document.Â  Our\r\n  holding today should not be construed as foreclosing all relief to a mortgagor\r\n  in this circumstance.Â  When a mortgagee, for valuable consideration, represents\r\n  that it will perform in a particular manner, and then fails to perform as\r\n  promised, a traditional action may be available.Â  In such circumstance, a\r\n  mortgagor may pursue an action by alleging and proving the existence of a duty;\r\n  breach of that duty; and damages proximately caused by the breach. Â A claim\r\n  under sections 29-3-310 and 320 is clearly more appealing to mortgagors with\r\n  its windfall penalty and accompanying absence of the usual burden of having to\r\n  prove proximate cause and damages.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26594","title":"Barton v.

Garrison Hill, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 26594\r\nHeard November 18, 2008 - Filed February\r\n  9, 2009Â Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAmy V.

Farry, both of Horton, Drawdy, Ward &amp; Jenkins, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â Â Â Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, the court of appeals held\r\n  that Petitioner South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund (the Fund) was\r\n  responsible for paying benefits to an injured employee.Â  Barton v. Higgs,\r\n  372 S.C. 109, 641 S.E.2d 39 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We granted a writ of certiorari\r\n  to review that decision and now reverse.\r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nDavid Barton (Claimant) was employed by William Higgs\r\n  d/b/a Iyanel Enterprises (Iyanel), which served as the roofing subcontractor\r\n  for Respondent Total Home Exteriors (Total Home).Â  On November 22, 2003,\r\n  Claimant sustained a compensable injury when he fell from a roof.Â  At the time\r\n  of the accident, Iyanel did not have workersâ€™ compensation insurance, and thus,\r\n  as the higher-tier contractor, Total Home remained liable to pay Claimant\r\n  benefits.Â  Total Home sought to transfer liability to the Fund pursuant to S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415 (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nAt the hearing\r\n  before the single commissioner, the president of Total Home testified that he\r\n  received a Certificate of Insurance from Higgs showing that Iyanel had a\r\n  workers compensation policy in effect from September 13, 2003 through September\r\n  13, 2004.Â  The Certificate listed Total Home as the certificate holder and\r\n  Jackie Perry Insurance Agency (Insurance Company) as the producer, but the Certificate\r\n  was not signed in the blank listed for â€œAuthorized Representative.â€Â Â  Â Higgs\r\n  testified that he paid for the workersâ€™ compensation insurance and that an\r\n  employee of the Insurance Company issued the Certificate of Insurance.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, coverage was never bound, resulting in Iyanel not being insured on\r\n  the date of the accident.Â  \r\nThe single\r\n  commissioner found that Iyanel had attempted in good faith to obtain workersâ€™\r\n  compensation insurance and presented the Certificate of Insurance to Total\r\n  Home, upon which Total Home relied in good faith.Â  Accordingly, the single\r\n  commissioner ruled that liability should be transferred to the Fund.Â  The full\r\n  commission, the circuit court, and the court of appeals affirmed the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s decision to transfer liability. \r\nWe granted a writ\r\n  of certiorari and the Fund presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  court of appeals err in affirming the decision to transfer liability to the\r\n  Fund pursuant to Â§ 42-1-415?\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nWhen reviewing an\r\n  appeal from the workersâ€™ compensation commission, the appellate court may not\r\n  weigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the full commission\r\n  as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact.Â  Therrell v. Jerryâ€™s Inc., 370 S.C. 22, 26, 633 S.E.2d 893, 894-95 (2006).Â \r\n  However, the appellate court may reverse the full commissionâ€™s decision if it\r\n  is based on an error of law.Â  Id.Â  The issue of\r\n  interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the Court.Â  Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina v. State, 372\r\n  S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe Fund argues\r\n  that the court of appeals erred in affirming the decision to transfer liability\r\n  because the Certificate of Insurance was unsigned.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, a general contractor is considered the\r\n  â€œstatutory employerâ€ of a subcontractorâ€™s employees and is liable to pay\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation benefits to the subcontractorâ€™s employee injured on the\r\n  job.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-410 (2006).Â  Thus, â€œ[t]he employee of the sub-contractor may look to the prime\r\n  contractor for workersâ€™ compensation benefits without regard to whether the\r\n  sub-contractor is covered by a workersâ€™ compensation insurance policy.â€Â  Freeman Mechanical, Inc. v. J.W. Bateson Co., Inc., 316\r\n  S.C. 95, 97, 447 S.E.2d 197, 198 (1994).Â \r\n  The purpose of this statute is to protect the employee and assure coverage in\r\n  the event of an injury.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1996, however, the Legislature created a narrow exception to this rule which\r\n  provides that the general contractor may transfer the responsibility to pay\r\n  benefits:\r\n\r\n\t[U]pon the submission of documentation to the commission that a\r\n  contractor or subcontractor has represented himself to a higher tier\r\n  subcontractor, contractor, or project owner as having workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  insurance at the time the contractor or subcontractor was engaged to perform\r\n  work, the higher tier subcontractor, contractor, or project owner must be\r\n  relieved of any and all liability under this title except as specifically\r\n  provided in this section.\r\n\r\nSection 42-1-415(A).Â  However, to transfer liability to the\r\n  Fund, the higher-tier contractor â€œmust collect documentation\r\n  of insurance . . . on a standard form acceptable to the commission.â€Â  The\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation commission has promulgated a regulation providing that a\r\n  Certificate of Insurance â€œshall serve as documentation of insuranceâ€ and that\r\n  the Certificate â€œmust be dated, signed, and issued by an authorized\r\n  representative of the insurance carrier for the insured.â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Reg. 67-415 (Supp. 2007).Â  In other words, liability may be transferred\r\n  from the higher tier contractor to the Fund only after the higher tier\r\n  contractor has properly documented the subcontractorâ€™s claim that it retains\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation insurance.Â  This statutory scheme provides an ultimate\r\n  safety net for general contractors against a subcontractorâ€™s act of fraud.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, by failing to collect a signed Certificate of Insurance form,\r\n  Total Home failed to meet the requirement as set forth in the regulation.Â  Even\r\n  assuming Iyanel was not acting fraudulently in submitting the unsigned form, Total\r\n  Home could have easily investigated the absence of the signature and determined\r\n  that Iyanel did not have a valid policy.Â  In our view, public funds should not\r\n  be expended where Respondent could have discovered the mistake by acting in accordance\r\n  with the regulations.\r\nWe recognize that the full\r\n  commission found that the form was a valid documentation and, as the agency\r\n  charged with administering the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, this decision should\r\n  be given great deference.Â  See Dunton v. S.C. Bd.\r\n    of Examâ€™rs in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221,\r\n  223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987) (recognizing that the construction of a statute by the agency charged with its\r\n  administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration).Â  However, we\r\n  hold that the full commissionâ€™s decision should not be upheld because\r\n  the interpretation is clearly contrary to its own regulation.Â  See Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and\r\n    Envtl. Control, 348\r\n  S.C. 507, 560 S.E.2d 410 (2002) (holding that while\r\n  the Court typically defers to an agencyâ€™s construction of its own regulation,\r\n  where the plain language of the regulation is contrary to the agencyâ€™s\r\n  interpretation, the Court will reject the interpretation).\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the court of\r\n  appeals and hold that Total Home may not transfer liability to the Fund.Â  \r\nKITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and Donna S.\r\n  Strom, concur. WALLER, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion,\r\n  the Court of Appeals correctly held that respondent\r\n  Total Home â€œmet all of the statutory requirements to transfer liability.â€ Â Barton\r\n    v. Higgs, 372 S.C. 109, 117, 641 S.E.2d 39, 43 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  Accordingly, I would affirm\r\n  in result. \r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415 provides that when a subcontractor â€œhas represented\r\n  himselfâ€ to a general contractor as having workersâ€™ compensation insurance at\r\n  the time the subcontractor â€œwas engaged to perform work,â€ the general contractor\r\n  â€œmust be relieved of any and all liability.â€Â  The statute further states that\r\n  the general contractor â€œmust collect documentation of insurance â€¦ on a standard\r\n  form acceptable to the commission.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415 (Supp. 2008).\r\nA\r\n  review of some additional facts is in order.Â  The president for Total Home\r\n  testified that he would not have given Iyanel Enterprises a contract without\r\n  obtaining a certificate of workersâ€™ compensation insurance.Â  Likewise, the\r\n  testimony of William Higgs confirmed that before Iyanel could work as a\r\n  subcontractor on jobs for Total Home, Total Home required him to get a\r\n  certificate of insurance.Â  According to Higgs, he went to the Jackie Perry\r\n  Insurance Agency, paid his money for the policy, and obtained the certificate.Â \r\n  Despite the issuance of the certificate by the Perry Agency, the coverage was\r\n  never bound, resulting in Iyanel not being insured on the date of Claimantâ€™s\r\n  accident.\r\nThe\r\n  record reflects that the Perry Agency had employed someone who issued\r\n  certificates of insurance without the coverage being bound.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  only fraud that seems to have occurred in this case is by an employee of the\r\n  insurance agency, not by the subcontractor.Â  Although the majority concedes\r\n  that section 42-1-415 is designed to protect a general contractor from fraud,\r\n  the end result of the majorityâ€™s reasoning is that Total Home becomes a victim\r\n  of fraud simply because it was not committed by the subcontractor.\r\nMore\r\n  importantly, however, the majority seems to gloss over the fact that the express\r\n  requirements of the statute clearly were met in the instant case.Â  Instead, the\r\n  majority opinion focuses its attention on the regulationâ€™s requirements.[1]Â \r\n  This runs contrary to settled precedent.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  regulations authorized by the Legislature generally have the force of law, a\r\n  regulation may not alter or add to a statute.Â  Goodman v. City of Columbia, 318 S.C. 488, 490, 458 S.E.2d 531, 532&nbsp;(1995); Banks v. Batesburg\r\n    Hauling Co., 24 S.E.2d 496, 499&nbsp;(1943); see also Society\r\n      of Profâ€™l Journalists v. Sexton, 283 S.C. 563, 567, 324 S.E.2d 313,\r\n  315&nbsp;(1984) (â€œAlthough a regulation has the force of law, it must fall when\r\n  it alters or adds to a statute.â€).\r\nThe Goodman case is instructive.Â  Goodman involved S.C. Code Â§ 42-17-50, the\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation statute which allows â€œan application for reviewâ€ of the\r\n  single commissionerâ€™s order by the Full Commission.Â  The Commission promulgated\r\n  Regulation 67-701 which requires that a specific form be filed (Form 30).Â  The\r\n  petitioner in Goodman did not file a Form 30, but instead wrote the Commission a letter â€œexpressing his desire to appeal.â€Â  Goodman, 318 S.C. at 490, 458 S.E.2d at 532.Â  On direct appeal, the\r\n  Court of Appeals found the petitionerâ€™s letter did not substantially comply\r\n  with section 42-17-50.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  certiorari, this Court reversed.Â  The Goodman court stated that Regulation\r\n  67-701 â€œadds the requirement of applying for review with\r\n  a particular form, thereby adding to the statute. Â Insofar as Reg. 67-701\r\n    increases the threshold requirements of section 42-17-50, the specifications\r\n    set forth in the statute must prevail.â€Â  Id. at 490-491, 458 S.E.2d at\r\n  532 (emphasis added).Â  The Court in Goodman therefore held that that petitionerâ€™s letter constituted substantial compliance\r\n  with section 42-17-50.Â  Id. at 491, 458 S.E.2d at 532.\r\nThe\r\n  instant case is analogous to Goodman in that there was substantial\r\n  compliance with the applicable statute.Â  Total Home requested and received\r\n  documentation of Iyanelâ€™s insurance on a form authorized by the Commission.Â \r\n  All the substantive parts of the form were filled in - it listed Higgs as being\r\n  insured with a workersâ€™ compensation policy (including a policy number and\r\n  coverage dates), and also listed Total Home as the certificate holder.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  only thing missing was a signature.Â  In my opinion, requiring such strict\r\n  compliance with the regulation would only serve to frustrate legislative\r\n  intent.[2]Â \r\n  The obvious purpose of section 42-1-415 is to encourage a higher tier\r\n  contractor to require proof that its subcontractors carry workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  insurance.Â  Therefore, if the higher tier contractor substantially complies\r\n  with the document collection requirement, it should not be ultimately liable\r\n  when the subcontractor turns out to not actually be insured.Â  See Â§42-1-415; Goodman, supra.\r\nIn\r\n  addition, nowhere in the statute is there a requirement that the higher tier\r\n  contractor verify the authenticity of the documentation of insurance.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, the majority suggests that Total Home â€œcould have easily\r\n  investigated the absence of the signature and determined that Iyanel did not\r\n  have a valid policy.â€Â  First, I disagree that section 42-1-415 imposes this\r\n  burden on the general contractor.Â  Moreover, I also disagree that under the\r\n  facts of this case, any such investigation would have uncovered the fraud\r\n  apparently committed by a rogue employee of the insurance agency.[3] \r\nPut simply, the majorityâ€™s focus on the absence of a signature literally â€œelevat[es] form over substance.â€\r\n  Â South Carolina Second Injury Fund v.

Â At the very least, the majority has elevated\r\n  regulation over statute, and in my opinion, this runs contrary to well-settled\r\n  law.Â  See, e.g., Goodman, supra; Society of\r\n    Profâ€™l Journalists v.

Wellborn, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  TOAL:Â  In this case, the magistrate\r\n  held a probable cause hearing on Respondent Jimmy Ramseyâ€™s criminal domestic\r\n  violence (CDV) charge and dismissed it for lack of probable cause.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed the magistrateâ€™s finding.Â  On appeal, the State claims the\r\n  magistrate erred in holding a probable cause hearing and dismissing\r\n  Respondentâ€™s CDV charge.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nOn\r\n  February 18, 2006, Respondent was arrested on a warrant for burglary first\r\n  degree and was issued a uniform traffic ticket for CDV first offense.Â  On May\r\n  16, 2006, the circuit court held a preliminary hearing on the burglary charge.Â \r\n  The circuit court dismissed the burglary charge for lack of probable cause and\r\n  remanded the CDV charge to the magistrate.Â  Respondent filed with the\r\n  magistrate a motion to dismiss the CDV charge for lack of probable cause.Â  On\r\n  August 14, 2006, the magistrate held a hearing to determine probable cause and\r\n  granted Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  The State appealed to the circuit\r\n  court.Â  The circuit court affirmed the magistrateâ€™s order of dismissal and the\r\n  State appealed.Â  We certified this case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  \r\nIssue\r\nDid\r\n  the magistrate have jurisdiction to hold a probable cause hearing on\r\n  Respondentâ€™s charge for criminal domestic violence?\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nIn general, magistrates have criminal jurisdiction â€œof all\r\n  offenses which may be subject to the penalties of either fine or forfeiture not\r\n  exceeding five hundred dollars or imprisonment in the jail or workhouse not\r\n  exceeding thirty days.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  22-3-550 (2007).Â  For crimes outside magistratesâ€™ jurisdiction, magistrates are\r\n  authorized to conduct a preliminary examination.Â  See Rule 2, SCRCrimP (â€œAny\r\n  defendant charged with a crime not triable by a magistrate shall be brought\r\n  before a magistrate and shall be given notice of his right to a preliminary\r\n  hearing.â€).Â  The\r\n  purpose of a preliminary examination is to determine whether probable cause\r\n  exists to believe that the defendant committed the crime and to warrant the\r\n  defendantâ€™s subsequent trial.Â  12 S.C.\r\n  Jurisprudence Magistrates and Municipal Judges Â§ 31.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, for those matters within magistratesâ€™ jurisdiction, preliminary\r\n  determinations of probable cause are not authorized by statute.Â  Indeed, South Carolina law requires that all magistrate\r\n  proceedings â€œshall be summary or with only such delay as a fair and just\r\n  examination of the case requires.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-730 (2007).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Respondent was charged with criminal domestic violence, first\r\n  offense, pursuant to Section 16-25-20 of the South Carolina Code, which provides\r\n  that the offense â€œmust be tried in summary court.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-20\r\n  (2007).Â  Prior to ruling on the merits, the magistrate found that Section\r\n  22-5-710 of the South Carolina Code gave him the authority to hold preliminary\r\n  examinations in criminal cases.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-5-710 (2008).Â  We\r\n  disagree, and hold that the magistrate did not have the authority to hold a\r\n  preliminary hearing in this matter.Â  Â \r\nSection\r\n  22-5-710, relied upon by the magistrate, grants â€œmagistrates in counties where\r\n  a county court has been establishedâ€ the authority to conduct a preliminary\r\n  hearing â€œas is provided by law in criminal cases beyond the jurisdiction of\r\n  magistrates.â€Â  Id.Â  This section is inapplicable because South Carolina no longer uses a county court system.Â  However, even if we were to assume\r\n  that the magistrate intended to rely upon the authority granted him by Section\r\n  22-5-320, which empowers magistrates to conduct preliminary hearings upon the\r\n  motion of the defendant on matters beyond their jurisdiction, we must find that\r\n  the magistrate exceeded his authority.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-5-320\r\n  (2008).Â  The CDV charge was within the magistrateâ€™s jurisdiction, and we find there\r\n  is no authority for the proposition that magistrates are authorized to conduct\r\n  preliminary hearings on matters within their own trial jurisdiction.Â  To hold\r\n  otherwise would undermine the summary nature of magistrate proceedings and\r\n  unduly expand magistrate dockets.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that the magistrate judge should have declined Respondentâ€™s request for\r\n  a probable cause hearing and instead brought the charge to trial for summary\r\n  disposition.Â  The trial court therefore erred in considering the merits of the\r\n  probable cause inquiry and affirming the magistrate.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons,\r\n  we hereby reverse and remand this case to the magistrate for summary\r\n  disposition.Â \r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26596","title":"Harris v.

Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  construing the term â€œorâ€ consistent with its common understanding as a\r\n  disjunctive, we hold section 47-3-110 allows a plaintiff to pursue a statutory\r\n  claim against the owner of the dog â€œor other person having the dog in his care\r\n  or keeping.â€Â  Because of the plain language in this statute, we conclude that\r\n  the Legislature intended to allow a claim against the owner of the dog when another\r\n  person has the dog in his care or keeping.Â  Moreover, in light of the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s determination that statutory liability against a dog owner\r\n  fundamentally rests on negligence concepts, we address the common law remnant\r\n  retained in section 47-3-110.Â  For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the grant\r\n  of summary judgment to the Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Office and remand for\r\n  trial.Â  \r\nI. \r\nDeputy\r\n  Todd Caron of the Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Office kenneled his police dog\r\n  (Sleuber) at the Happistance Veterinary Clinic (clinic) in Townville, South Carolina, while he was on vacation.Â  Sleuber had a recent history of multiple\r\n  unprovoked attacks, a history well known to Deputy Caron and the sheriffâ€™s\r\n  office.Â  Jennifer Harris worked at the clinic as a veterinary assistant.Â  While\r\n  kenneled at the clinic, Sleuber attacked Harris, severely injuring her.Â  It is\r\n  undisputed that Harris did not provoke the attack.Â  \r\nHarris\r\n  pursued workersâ€™ compensation benefits from her employer, the clinic. Â Harris subsequently\r\n  filed this lawsuit against the sheriffâ€™s office, asserting claims under section\r\n  47-3-110 and negligence.Â  Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed.Â  The\r\n  circuit court focused on the statutory claim and, with respect to a dog ownerâ€™s\r\n  liability, read negligence principles into the statute.Â  The circuit court\r\n  reasoned that the sheriffâ€™s office was no longer in control of its police dog\r\n  (and should not be held responsible) once care of the dog was relinquished to\r\n  the clinic. In granting the sheriffâ€™s office summary judgment, the circuit\r\n  court held that when a dog owner leaves his dog in the care of another, section\r\n  47-3-110 only permits a claim against the â€œother person having the dog in his\r\n  care or keeping.â€Â  Harris appealed, and we granted Rule 204(b), SCACR,\r\n  certification. Â \r\nII.Â  \r\nSummary judgment is\r\n  governed by Rule 56, SCRCP. Â Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no\r\n  genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as\r\n  a matter of law.Â  Our review is plenary, however, for we are presented with a question\r\n  of statutory interpretation.Â  Town of Summerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008).Â  \r\nIII.Â  \r\nA.\r\nWe begin our\r\n  analysis with this Courtâ€™s decision in Hossenlopp v. Cannon, 285 S.C.\r\n  367, 329 S.E.2d 438 (1985).Â  In Hossenlopp, the Court was presented with\r\n  a common law negligence claim arising from injuries caused by a dog.Â  At the\r\n  time, South Carolina adhered to what was commonly referred to as the â€œone free\r\n  biteâ€ rule.Â  The â€œone free biteâ€ rule imposed common law liability against a\r\n  dog owner only when the owner knew or should have known of the dogâ€™s vicious\r\n  propensities, that is, there was no liability for the first bite.Â  In Hossenlopp,\r\n  under our policy making role in the common law, we rejected the â€œone free biteâ€\r\n  rule and imposed quasi-strict liability on dog owners by adopting the â€œCalifornia\r\n  Ruleâ€ for dog bite liability.Â  This shift in the common law is reflected in the \r\nHossenlopp Courtâ€™s adoption of the following jury instruction:\r\n\r\n\tThe law of California provides that the owner of any dog which\r\n  bites a person while such person is on or in a public place or is lawfully on\r\n  or in a private place, including the property of the owner of such dog, is\r\n  liable for such damages as may be suffered by the person bitten regardless of\r\n  whether or not the dog previously had been vicious, regardless of the ownerâ€™s\r\n  knowledge or lack of knowledge of any such viciousness, and regardless of\r\n  whether or not the owner has been negligent in respect to the dog, provided,\r\n  however, that if a person knowingly and voluntarily invites attack upon himself\r\n  [herself], or if, when on the property of the dog owner, a person voluntarily,\r\n  knowingly, and without reasonable necessity, exposes himself [herself] to the\r\n  danger, the owner of the dog is not liable for the consequences.\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n  372, 329 S.E.2d at 441.\r\nHossenlopp represents the last time the Court addressed a dog\r\n  bite case in a purely common law setting. Â The following year, 1986, the Legislature\r\n  enacted section 47-3-110:\r\n\r\n\tWhenever\r\n  any person is bitten or otherwise attacked by a dog while the person is in a\r\n  public place or is lawfully in a private place, including the property of the\r\n  owner of the dog or other person having the dog in his care or keeping, the\r\n  owner of the dog or other person having the dog in his care or keeping is\r\n  liable for the damages suffered . . . .Â  If a person provokes a dog into\r\n  attacking him then the owner of the dog is not liable.Â  \r\n\r\nSection\r\n  47-3-110 was enacted in response to Hossenlopp.Â  This transition from\r\n  the common law to the statutory setting, of course, restricts our policy making\r\n  role and concomitantly requires this Court to discern legislative intent. The juxtaposition\r\n  of Hossenlopp to section 47-3-110 does, however, provide a strong frame\r\n  of reference for ascertaining legislative intent. Â Section 47-3-110 retained Hossenloppâ€™s\r\n  strict liability against dog owners and additionally imposed liability on any\r\n  other persons having the dog in their â€œcare or keeping.â€ \r\n\r\nB.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\n  intent of the [L]egislature.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533\r\n  S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  The Court will give words their plain and ordinary\r\n  meaning, and will not resort to a subtle or forced construction that would\r\n  limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Rollison,\r\n  378 S.C. 600, 609, 663 S.E.2d 484, 488 (2008). Â The Legislature unmistakably\r\n  adopted a strict liability approach for injuries caused by dogs, save the\r\n  situation when the injured party provoked the attack.Â  Traditional principles\r\n  of statutory construction bolster this interpretation.\r\nIn\r\n  light of the remedial nature of the statute, and its plain language, we find\r\n  the Legislature intended the word â€œorâ€ in accordance with its common,\r\n  disjunctive usage. Â Brewer v. Brewer, 242 S.C. 9, 14, 129 S.E.2d 736,\r\n  738 (1963) (noting that the use of the word â€œorâ€ in a statute â€œis a disjunctive\r\n  particle that marks an alternativeâ€); see also Rollison, 378 S.C. at\r\n  609, 663 S.E.2d at 488 (observing that â€œâ€˜[a] statute remedial in nature should\r\n  be liberally construed in order to accomplish the object[ive] soughtâ€™â€ (quoting Inabinet v. Royal Exch. Assurance of London, 165 S.C. 33, 36, 162 S.E.\r\n  599, 600 (1932))).Â  Â Â \r\nTo\r\n  construe the term â€œorâ€ in an atypical manner, limiting the statutory claim of\r\n  Harris to the clinic, would be inconsistent with the remedial and strict\r\n  liability underpinnings of the statute.Â  With the singular exception for the\r\n  circumstance where the injured person provokes the attack, the Legislature has\r\n  chosen to impose strict liability against dog owners and others having â€œthe dog\r\n  in [their] care or keeping.â€Â  Â§ 47-3-110 (â€œ[T]he owner of the dog or other\r\n  person having the dog in his care or keeping is liable for the damages suffered\r\n  . . . .â€). \r\nStrict\r\n  liability is a policy decision to impose liability regardless of fault.Â \r\n  Relieving the dog owner of liability where the dog was in the care or keeping\r\n  of another would be contrary to the statutory language and run counter to the\r\n  manifest legislative intent of strict liability.Â  Given the unambiguous\r\n  language, allowing a plaintiff to sue either the owner of the dog or the party\r\n  who assumes the care or keeping of the dog is entirely consistent with a\r\n  logical construction of section 47-3-110.Â  Investor Premium Corp. v. S.C.\r\n    Tax Commâ€™n, 260 S.C. 13, 20, 193 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1973) (setting forth the Courtâ€™s\r\n  function in discerning legislative intent to interpret words in a statute in a\r\n  way that both gives meaning to the use of the word and is logical). \r\nThe\r\n  use of the term â€œorâ€ in section 47-3-110 does not mandate a forced selection\r\n  for an injured party.Â  With the one exception noted in the statute, the owner\r\n  of the dog is subject to liability for injuries caused by his dog.Â  Where the\r\n  person is injured while the dog is in the care or keeping of someone who is not\r\n  the dogâ€™s owner, the injured party may pursue a statutory claim against the\r\n  owner of the dog or the other person having the dog in his care or keeping.Â  \r\nC.\r\nThe\r\n  dog owner posits two basic arguments to sustain the grant of summary judgment\r\n  in its favor.Â  First, we are asked to adopt the reasoning of the circuit court\r\n  which overlaid negligence principles on section 47-3-110â€™s imposition of\r\n  liability on a dog owner.Â  The circuit court essentially found that the dog\r\n  owner was no longer in control (and hence not at-fault) once the dog was left\r\n  at the veterinary clinic.Â  While the statute does implicate considerations of\r\n  control with respect to the â€œother person having the dog in his care or keeping,â€\r\n  there is no such limitation with respect to the dog owner.Â  Imposing a control\r\n  requirement or other negligence principles by judicial fiat on the dog owner\r\n  would impose requirements nowhere found in the statute.[1]\r\nSecond,\r\n  the dog owner invites the Court, on policy grounds, to create a â€œkennel worker\r\n  exception,â€ and preclude that class of people from asserting statutory strict\r\n  liability claims against a dog owner.Â  See Priebe v. Nelson, 140\r\n  P.3d 848, 861 (Cal. 2006) (recognizing a â€œkennel exceptionâ€ and precluding a\r\n  kennel worker from maintaining a claim against the owner of a dog when injured\r\n  by the dog while in the performance of his duties as a kennel worker).Â  Because\r\n  we are confronted with a matter of statutory interpretation, such policy\r\n  decisions rest exclusively in the Legislature.Â  We are constrained therefore to\r\n  decline the invitation to create a policy exception to section 47-3-110.Â \r\n  Similarly, we acknowledge that application of section 47-3-110â€™s strict\r\n  liability against dog owners may appear harsh and have unintended\r\n  consequences.Â  But again, such concerns now lie in the Legislature.Â  \r\nD.\r\nBecause\r\n  of the dog ownerâ€™s reliance on, and the trial courtâ€™s acceptance of, negligence\r\n  principles to determine statutory liability against a dog owner, we address the\r\n  limited interplay between section 47-3-110 and the common law.Â  We broach this\r\n  subject for the benefit of the bench and bar, as some adhere to the belief that\r\n  section 47-3-110 liability against a dog owner incorporates negligence\r\n  principles.Â  This belief, while erroneous, is understandable in light of the\r\n  statutorily imposed liability against those who undertake to provide the care\r\n  or keeping of a dog.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Legislatureâ€™s use of the phrase â€œcare or keepingâ€ clearly requires that the\r\n  â€œother personâ€ act in a manner which manifests an acceptance of responsibility\r\n  for the care or keeping of the dog.Â  To this degree, the Legislature retained the\r\n  common law principle of duty in determining the liability of the â€œother\r\n  person.â€Â  An example of this relationship between section 47-3-110 and the\r\n  common law is illustrated in the case of Nesbitt v. Lewis, 335 S.C. 441,\r\n  517 S.E.2d 11 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nNesbitt involved an unprovoked attack by dogs on a child who\r\n  was lawfully on private property.Â  The property was owned by three persons, a\r\n  mother and her two adult children, a son and a daughter.Â  The mother owned the\r\n  dogs, and she lived on the property with her son.Â  The mother was liable under\r\n  the statute simply as a result of owning the dogs.Â  The added feature of owning\r\n  the property and exercising control over the premises, in tandem with providing\r\n  the care and keeping of the dogs, was a further basis on which to impose\r\n  liability against the mother.\r\nThe son\r\n  was liable under the statute as a property owner who exercised control over the\r\n  premises.Â  As concerns the statutory element of â€œcare or keeping,â€ the son\r\n  â€œlived with [his mother] at the time of the attack and . . . tended [to] the\r\n  dogs, taking them to the veterinarian, feeding them, and playing with them on\r\n  occasion.â€Â  Id. at 446, 517 S.E.2d at 14.\r\nThe\r\n  daughter was the third property owner.Â  She â€œhad lived elsewhere for over five\r\n  years.â€ Â The daughter â€œdid not take care of the dogs . . . Â [and she did] not\r\n  exercise control over the premises . . . .â€ Â Id. Â The Nesbitt court reversed a jury verdict against the daughter, noting that the â€œevidence\r\n  precludes a finding that [she] owned the dogs or had them in her care or\r\n  keeping.â€Â  Id. at 447, 517 S.E.2d at 14.Â  The daughter was not liable\r\n  under the statute for the dog attack, for â€œshe lacked possession and control\r\n  over [her motherâ€™s] house and the dogs.â€ Id. at 446, 517 S.E.2d at 14. Â In\r\n  short, the daughter owed no duty of care to the injured party.Â  The Nesbitt court correctly invoked common law concepts in analyzing and determining the\r\n  liability of a property owner who does not own the dog which caused the injury.\r\nNesbitt, thus, presents three scenarios under section\r\n  47-3-110 when the attack is unprovoked and the injured party is lawfully on the\r\n  premises.Â  First, the dog owner is strictly liable and common law principles\r\n  are not implicated.Â  Second, a property owner is liable when he exercises\r\n  control over, and assumes responsibility for, the care and keeping of the dog.Â \r\n  Third, a property owner is not liable under the statute when he has no control of\r\n  the premises and provides no care or keeping of the dog.Â  It is the presence or\r\n  absence of a duty that determines liability in the latter two situations that involve\r\n  a statutory claim against the â€œother person having the dog in his care or\r\n  keeping.â€Â  To this degree, section 47-3-110 implicates the common law.[2]Â \r\n  Our Legislature has spoken clearly in section 47-3-110 that, as concerns a dog\r\n  ownerâ€™s liability, negligence principles in general and fault in particular\r\n  have no place.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nE.\r\nWe\r\n  recognize there remain unanswered questions concerning section 47-3-110.Â \r\n  Merely by way of example, we can envision questions arising with regard to\r\n  principles of indemnification and third party practice under Rule 14, SCRCP.Â  We\r\n  leave these questions for another day.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIV.\r\nConstruing\r\n  the language of section 47-3-110, and discerning legislative intent, we hold\r\n  that a person injured by a dog may pursue a claim against the owner of the dog\r\n  when the injury occurs while the dog is in the care or keeping of another.Â Â  The\r\n  Legislature has made a policy decision to hold dog owners strictly liable when the\r\n  dog bites or otherwise attacks a person who is lawfully on the premises, except\r\n  when the injured person provoked the attack.Â  The Legislature has further\r\n  statutorily imposed liability on those who assume the care or keeping of a\r\n  dog.Â  The grant of summary judgment in favor of the Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Office is reversed and the matter is remanded to the circuit court for trial.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurs in the holding.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; One rule of statutory construction allows the\r\n  Court to deviate from a statuteâ€™s plain language when the result would be so\r\n  patently absurd that it is clear that the Legislature could not have intended\r\n  such a result. State ex rel. McLeod v. Montgomery, 244 S.C. 308, 314,\r\n  136 S.E.2d 778, 782 (1964) (â€œHowever plain the ordinary meaning of the words\r\n  used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning, when to accept\r\n  it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have\r\n  been intended by the Legislature, or would defeat the plain legislative\r\n  intention; and if possible will construe the statute so as to escape the\r\n  absurdity and carry the intention into effect.â€ (quoting Stackhouse v.\r\n    Rowland, 86 S.C. 419, 422, 68 S.E. 561, 562 (1910))).Â  While we may be concerned with the unintended\r\n  consequences of applying the clear meaning of section 47-3-110 in every\r\n  conceivable circumstance, such concerns in this case fall far short of an\r\n  absurdity that would warrant applying this rule of statutory construction.Â  We\r\n  decline to construe the statute in a manner to shield this dog owner from\r\n  liability, for the imposition of strict liability under section 47-3-110\r\n  reflects a permissible policy determination of the Legislature. \r\n[2]&nbsp; We do not suggest that the â€œother personâ€ for\r\n  section 47-3-110 purposes must always be a property owner.Â  There may well be\r\n  circumstances where a person (who is not the dog owner) has the care or keeping\r\n  of a dog and property ownership is not relevant.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26597","title":"In the Matter of Clinton J.

Hall, II (Respondent).Â  We find the\r\n  imposition of a public reprimand is warranted.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  Commission notified Respondent on April 4, 2008 that formal charges had been\r\n  filed against him pursuant to the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement\r\n  (RJDE) found in Rule 502 of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules (SCACR).Â \r\n  The charges stemmed from the alleged failure of Respondent to meet his\r\n  continuing legal education (CLE) obligations under Rule 510, SCACR, to timely\r\n  file the required annual CLE reports, and to petition this Court for\r\n  reinstatement (following his suspension) before resuming his judicial duties.Â \r\n  Respondent filed a response to the charges.Â  \r\nA\r\n  hearing was held before a panel of the Commission on July 14, 2008, and a Panel\r\n  Report was issued on August 28, 2008.Â  The panel recommended that Respondent\r\n  receive a public reprimand and that he be required to pay the costs of these\r\n  proceedings.[1]Â \r\n  In addition, the panel recommended that Respondent be barred from future\r\n  judicial service until he receives explicit written permission from this Court\r\n  to serve.Â  \r\nBy\r\n  letter dated September 11, 2008, the Commission forwarded the Panel Report and\r\n  the record to this Court.Â  Neither Disciplinary Counsel nor Respondent has\r\n  filed any exceptions to the Panel Report and the matter is before the Court\r\n  based on the record of the proceedings in this case.\r\nLAW\r\nAfter a review of the record of the proceedings in this matter, we\r\n  find that by his conduct, Respondent has violated the following provisions of the Code of Judicial\r\n  Conduct contained in Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (upholding the integrity and\r\n  independence of the Judiciary); Canon 1A (stating a judge should participate in\r\n  establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high standards of conduct and shall\r\n  personally observe those standards); Canon 2 (avoiding impropriety and the\r\n  appearance of impropriety); Canon 2A (respecting and complying with the law);\r\n  Canon 3B(2) (exhibiting faithfulness to the law); Canon 3B(8) (disposing of all\r\n  judicial matters promptly, efficiently, and fairly); and Canon 3C(1)\r\n  (diligently discharging judgeâ€™s administrative responsibilities and cooperating\r\n  with other judges and court officials).\r\nIn addition, we find Respondent\r\n  has violated the following provisions of the RJDE contained in Rule 502,\r\n  SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (violating or attempting to violate the Code of Judicial\r\n  Conduct or the Rules of Professional Conduct or any other applicable ethics\r\n  codes); Rule 7(a)(2) (willfully violating a valid order of the Supreme Court,\r\n  the Commission, or the panels of the Commission or willfully failing to respond\r\n  or appear as required); Rule 7(a)(4) (persistently failing to perform judicial\r\n  duties or persistently performing judicial duties in an incompetent or\r\n  neglectful manner); Rule 7(a)(7) (willfully violating a valid court order); and\r\n  Rule 7(a)(9) (violating the Judgeâ€™s Oath of Office).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRespondent\r\n  shall not apply for, seek, or accept any judicial position whatsoever in this\r\n  State without the prior written authorization of this Court after due service\r\n  on the Office of Disciplinary Counsel of any petition seeking the Courtâ€™s\r\n  authorization. Â Respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct and is\r\n  ordered to pay the costs of these proceedings.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  When a judge no longer holds judicial office, a\r\n  public reprimand is the most severe sanction this Court may impose.Â  In re\r\n    Koulpasis, 376 S.C. 496, 657 S.E.2d 759 (2008). \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26598","title":"In the Matter of John L.

Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-90 and Â§\r\n  16-15-100 (2003).Â  The warrant alleged respondent met with an undercover South\r\n  Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) agent posing as a prostitute and\r\n  solicited the undercover agent for sex.Â  \r\nAs a result of\r\n  the same occurrences, respondent was also arrested on November 2, 2006 in Richland County for impersonating a law enforcement agent in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-17-720 (2003).Â  The warrant alleged that, during the encounter with the\r\n  undercover SLED agent who was posing as a prostitute, respondent verbally\r\n  identified himself as a SLED agent by presenting a badge and stating he was a\r\n  SLED agent.Â  At the time of the arrests, respondent was employed on a full-time\r\n  basis as an attorney with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and the badge he\r\n  presented to the undercover SLED agent was his Disciplinary Counsel badge.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that, during his conversation with the undercover SLED agent, he made\r\n  statements that she reasonably understood to be soliciting prostitution, even\r\n  though he did not offer money but, instead, used words that reasonably\r\n  represented an arrangement had been made by respondentâ€™s friend in the escort\r\n  service business which would allow for sexual activity without payment.Â  Respondent\r\n  also acknowledges that, during the encounter with the undercover SLED agent, he\r\n  stated he had overheard information regarding investigations into prostitution\r\n  activity while he was at SLED and stated that he might be able to provide\r\n  information regarding future prostitution investigations.Â  Respondent admits\r\n  that the statements concerning his ability to inform about future prostitution\r\n  investigations were false; the Special Prosecutor has no evidence to establish\r\n  otherwise.Â  Respondent further admits that, during the exchange with the\r\n  undercover SLED agent, he identified himself as a â€œSLED agentâ€ and, upon her\r\n  inquiry as to what â€œSLEDâ€ meant, he responded â€œState Law Enforcement Divisionâ€\r\n  or words to that effect.Â  \r\n The\r\n  responsibility for prosecuting respondent for these crimes was transferred to\r\n  the Solicitorâ€™s Office of the Sixth Judicial Circuit.Â  Respondent was allowed\r\n  to enter the Pre-Trial Intervention Program and he completed that program on or\r\n  about September 8, 2008. \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413,\r\n  RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct\r\n  of lawyers); Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to\r\n  pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal\r\n  profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice\r\n  law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (lawyer shall not violate the oath of office taken upon\r\n  admission to practice law in this State).Â  In addition, respondent admits he\r\n  has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 8.4(a) (it is\r\n    professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n    Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit\r\n  a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness\r\n  or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to commit\r\n  a criminal act involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit\r\n  or misrepresentation); Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to\r\n  engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice); and\r\n  Rule 8.4(f) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to state or imply an\r\n  ability to influence improperly a government agency or official or to achieve\r\n  results by means that violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and impose a definite suspension of two (2) years.Â  Within fifteen days\r\n  of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk\r\n  of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] On November 3, 2006, respondent was placed on\r\n  interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Pearman, 371 S.C. 19, 637 S.E.2d 309\r\n(2006).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26600","title":"In the Matter of Arthur C.

Respondent further failed to promptly return Complainant Aâ€™s\r\n  file as requested after the representation had been terminated.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nIn February 2005, Complainant B consulted\r\n  with respondent regarding the filing of a civil case on his behalf.Â  Respondent\r\n  agreed to review materials in Complainant Bâ€™s case to determine whether he\r\n  would accept representation in the matter.Â  During the course of respondentâ€™s\r\n  consultation with Complainant B, respondent received $1,000.00 from Complainant\r\n  B to conduct some legal research.Â  Respondent decided not to proceed with the\r\n  legal research, but failed to promptly return Complainantâ€™s $1,000.00 fee.Â  \r\nIn June 2005, Complainant B retained\r\n  respondent to handle a motor vehicle accident claim on his behalf.Â  In July\r\n  2005, respondent notified the insurance company he represented Complainant B.Â  \r\nOther than a review of Complainant Bâ€™s\r\n  medical records, respondent conducted no other meaningful work in the case.Â  In\r\n  February 2007, Complainant B terminated respondentâ€™s representation in the motor\r\n  vehicle accident matter and requested respondent forward the client file to his\r\n  new lawyer.Â  Respondent failed to promptly forward Complainant Bâ€™s file as\r\n  requested.Â  Once he did forward the file, only ten (10) days remained before expiration\r\n  of the statute of limitations.Â  Respondent maintains it was his intention to\r\n  file a suit prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  Respondent\r\n  agrees he failed to keep Complainant B reasonably informed about the status of\r\n  the motor vehicle accident case.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nIn January 2007, respondent was retained\r\n  to partition property on behalf of Complainant C and two other clients.Â  On\r\n  March 21, 2007, respondent filed suit in the action.Â  Service of the pleadings\r\n  was not completed until August 21, 2007.Â  Respondent represents that a\r\n  miscommunication between respondent and his legal assistant led to the delay in\r\n  service of the pleadings.Â  \r\nFor a period of over four months,\r\n  respondent failed to return Complainant Câ€™s telephone calls or keep Complainant\r\n  C and the other two clients reasonably informed regarding the status of their\r\n  case.Â  Both respondent and Complainant C represent that communications between\r\n  them have improved.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent acknowledges that his\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â \r\n  Respondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall abide by\r\n  clientâ€™s decision concerning objectives of representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer\r\n  shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule\r\n  1.4 (lawyer shall promptly respond to reasonable requests for information);\r\n  Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safe keep client property); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer\r\n  shall not engage in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.[1]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly\r\n  reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\nand KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent previously received a public\r\n  reprimand.Â  In the Matter of McFarland, 360 S.C. 101, 600 S.E.2d 537\r\n  (2004).Â Â  In addition, he received an admonition in 2001 and a private\r\n  reprimand in 1996.Â  As permitted by Rule 7(b)(5), RLDE, we have considered the\r\n  admonition and private reprimand solely upon the issue of determining the\r\nproper sanction in the current matter.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Thomas R.

master-in-equityâ€™s order to dissolve a limited-liability\r\n  company (LLC).Â  The master distributed the remaining assets of the company\r\n  between its two members, Appellant Gerard Mallon (â€œMallonâ€) and Respondent\r\n  Historic Charleston Holdings (â€œHCHâ€), and awarded HCH prejudgment interest and\r\n  attorneys fees.Â  The court of appeals reversed the masterâ€™s judgment and\r\n  remanded the case for a full accounting of the LLC.Â  This Court granted\r\n  certiorari and we reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nMallon,\r\n  HCH, and William Storen formed Dixie Holdings, LLC (â€œDixieâ€) in June 1998 for\r\n  the purpose of acquiring, owning, and developing property in Charleston.Â \r\n  Priestly Coker (â€œCokerâ€), who along with his wife comprised the entire\r\n  membership of HCH, handled the financial accounting and management of\r\n  properties acquired by Dixie; Mallon, the owner of a construction company,\r\n  handled repairs and renovations to the properties; and Storen, a licensed\r\n  realtor, acted as the real estate agent for the properties Dixie placed for\r\n  sale.Â  Mallon and HCH each held a 49.5% share of Dixie and Storen apparently\r\n  held 1%.[1]Â  \r\nMallon\r\n  and HCH were also equal members in Dixie Developers, LLC (â€œDixie Developersâ€),\r\n  a company organized just one month prior to the organization of Dixie for the\r\n  similar purpose of acquiring, owning, and developing property in Charleston.Â  Although Dixie and Dixie Developers were distinct entities, the funds of the\r\n  two companies were held in a single bank account under the name of Dixie\r\n  Developers, on which both Coker and Mallon had signatory authority.Â Â Â Â  \r\nDixie initially acquired four properties:Â  10 Felix Street, 12 Felix Street, 15 Felix Street, and 22 Felix Street.Â  The sale of 12\r\n  Felix occurred in December 1998, and 10 Felix was sold in April 1999 after both\r\n  had been repaired and renovated.Â  The proceeds from the sale of these\r\n  properties were used to reimburse authorized expense items associated with the\r\n  particular piece of property being sold, and the net proceeds were equally\r\n  distributed to HCH and Mallon.Â  Meanwhile, Dixie Developers also acquired three\r\n  properties which it renovated and placed for sale.Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  late 1999, Mallon and Storen made the first of multiple requests from Coker for\r\n  a full financial accounting of Dixie as well as copies of the companyâ€™s bank\r\n  records.Â  The computer printouts and documents provided by Coker, which Coker\r\n  testified comprised his entire financial record collection, were apparently\r\n  unsatisfactory to Mallon and Storen.Â  Thereafter, in December 1999, Mallon,\r\n  Storen, and Coker met to discuss their differences regarding the accounting for\r\n  Dixie.Â  An agreement signed by the parties at the meeting stated that sales of\r\n  Dixieâ€™s property would continue â€œwhile these matters are being dealt withâ€ and\r\n  further provided for the sales proceeds to be held in an escrow account in the\r\n  meantime.Â  \r\nAround\r\n  this same time, HCH sold its interest in Dixie Developers to Mallon, giving\r\n  Mallon 100% interest in that company.Â  The sale price of HCHâ€™s interest\r\n  purportedly reflected HCHâ€™s one-half interest in the company minus HCHâ€™s share\r\n  of Mallonâ€™s authorized expenses related to Dixie Developersâ€™ properties, all\r\n  three of which had sold prior to the buy-out.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the December 1999 agreement between Mallon, Storen, and Coker, Dixie sold its remaining two properties.Â  Number 15 Felix sold first in April 2000, and Mallon\r\n  placed the net proceeds totaling $41,845.30 into a new Dixie Developers account\r\n  he had opened as the now-sole member of that entity.Â Â  Mallon refused HCHâ€™s\r\n  demands to place the sale proceeds from 15 Felix into a â€œproper escrow accountâ€\r\n  in Dixieâ€™s name in accordance with the partiesâ€™ earlier agreement.Â  When 22\r\n  Felix later sold in December 2001, HCH and Mallon agreed to an equal\r\n  distribution of the net proceeds without first placing the funds in escrow.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  October 2002, Storen dissociated from Dixie, leaving Mallon and HCH each with\r\n  50% of the company.Â  That same month, unable to resolve their differences on\r\n  the financial accounting and bank records for Dixie, and further unable to\r\n  compel Mallon to move the sale proceeds from 15 Felix to an agreeable escrow\r\n  arrangement or otherwise distribute HCHâ€™s share of the proceeds, HCH filed a\r\n  civil claim against Mallon, Dixie, and Dixie Developers, individually and in a\r\n  derivative capacity as a member of Dixie.Â  The complaint sought a judicial\r\n  dissolution of Dixie along with a full financial accounting of both Dixie and\r\n  Dixie Developers, injunctive relief for Mallonâ€™s diversion of the 15 Felix\r\n  proceeds, a declaratory judgment as to HCHâ€™s rights as a member of Dixie, prejudgment\r\n  interest, and attorneysâ€™ fees.Â Â  \r\nMallon\r\n  initially responded to HCHâ€™s complaint in a pro se letter in November\r\n  2002 indicating he was interested in submitting the issue to binding\r\n  arbitration.Â  After further communication, Mallon retained counsel, and the\r\n  parties referred the case to a master-in-equity in May 2003.Â  Around this same\r\n  time, Mallon issued a memorandum alleging he was entitled to reimbursement for construction\r\n  work he performed and other miscellaneous expenses associated with properties\r\n  he owned with HCH.Â  Mallon formally asserted these charges in October 2003 when\r\n  pursuant to the masterâ€™s consent order, Mallon filed an amended answer in which\r\n  he argued, among other things, that he was entitled to set off the proceeds\r\n  from the sale of 15 Felix in the amount of his alleged expenses.Â  Mallonâ€™s\r\n  itemization of his expenditures included charges associated with each of the Felix Street properties acquired by Dixie, as well as charges associated with the three\r\n  properties acquired by Dixie Developers.Â Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, the master-in-equity found that HCH was entitled to one-half of the 15\r\n  Felix sale proceeds, plus pre-judgment interest on HCHâ€™s share of the\r\n  proceeds.Â  The master further ordered the dissolution and termination of Dixie within thirty days and awarded HCH statutory costs and attorneysâ€™ fees and costs.\r\nOn appeal,\r\n  the court of appeals reversed the masterâ€™s award to HCH of one-half of the 15\r\n  Felix proceeds and prejudgment interest, and remanded the case for a formal\r\n  accounting of Dixie.Â  See Historic Charleston Holdings v. Mallon, 365\r\n  S.C. 524, 617 S.E.2d 388 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The court also held that the master\r\n  did not abuse his discretion in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals dismissed Mallonâ€™s other arguments on grounds of issue\r\n  preservation.Â  Id.Â  This Court granted certiorari to review the\r\n  decision of the court of appeals, and Mallon raises the following issues for\r\n  review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tIs Mallon entitled to a full accounting for Dixie \r\n\t\t\tHoldings and Dixie Developers?&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tIs HCH entitled to one-half of the\r\n  proceeds from the sale of 15 Felix Street?Â  \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the master err in holding that the relief\r\n  granted to HCH was justified by Mallonâ€™s wrongful dissociation from Dixie? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the master err in excluding evidence of Cokerâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tself-dealing and misappropriation of Dixieâ€™s funds? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tV.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;Did the master err in awarding prejudgment \r\n\t\t\tinterest because the amount awarded HCH was not liquidated?Â  \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tVI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in holding that the \r\n\t\t\tmaster properly awarded HCH statutory costs and attorneysâ€™ fees?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Accounting \r\nMallon\r\n  argues that he is entitled to a full accounting for Dixie Holdings and Dixie\r\n  Developers.Â  Specifically, Mallon contends that a full accounting is necessary\r\n  to the dissolution and distribution of assets of Dixie and that the scope of\r\n  the action should not be limited to a determination of the partiesâ€™ rights with\r\n  respect to the proceeds from the sale of 15 Felix.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn action for an accounting\r\n  sounds in equity.Â  Therefore, this Court may review the record and make\r\n  findings in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  See Lawson v.\r\n    Rogers, 312\r\n  S.C. 492, 495, 435 S.E.2d 853, 855 (1993).[2] Â \r\nNoting\r\n  that an operating agreement is a binding contract that governs the affairs of\r\n  an LLC, see S.C. Code Ann. Â§33-44-103 (2006), the court of appeals held\r\n  that section 12.6 of Dixieâ€™s operating agreement, which provides that each of\r\n  Dixieâ€™s members â€œshall be furnished with a statement setting forth the assets\r\n  and liabilities of the Company as of the date of the complete liquidation,â€\r\n  entitled the parties to a formal accounting of Dixie.Â  In our view, this was\r\n  error.Â  While we acknowledge that Section 12.6 requires a â€œstatementâ€ of assets\r\n  and liabilities, we would distinguish this requirement from the equitable\r\n  remedy of â€œaccountingâ€ sought by the parties in the instant case, which refers\r\n  to â€œan adjustment of the accounts of the parties and a rendering of a judgment\r\n  for the balance ascertained to be due.â€Â  1 Am. Jur. 2d Accounts and\r\n    Accounting Â§ 52 (2005).[3]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find no prevailing requirement in the operating agreement\r\n  obligating the Court to order a remedy in the form of a judicial accounting of Dixie.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  even if, as the dissent argues, the â€œstatement of assets and liabilitiesâ€\r\n  provided for in the operating agreement entitles Mallon and HCH to a formal\r\n  judicial accounting, we find that Mallon and Coker (on behalf of HCH) waived\r\n  this right by refusing to effectively communicate and cooperate with one\r\n  another, and further failing to independently resolve the matter when both had\r\n  access to Dixieâ€™s bank records.[4]Â  See Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime, 307 S.C.\r\n  339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387-88 (1992) (defining a waiver as a voluntary and intentional abandonment or\r\n  relinquishment of a known right by a party who possessed actual or constructive\r\n  knowledge of its rights, or of all the material facts upon which they depended).[5]Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we can find no provision in the LLC Act requiring a court to order a complete\r\n  accounting under the circumstances.Â  Rather, we find that the LLC Act grants\r\n  broad judicial discretion in fashioning remedies in actions by a member of an\r\n  LLC against the LLC and/or other members.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  33-44-410 cmt., -801 cmt. (2006).Â  Accordingly, we hold that Mallon is not entitled\r\n  to a full accounting of Dixie or Dixie Developers, and that this Court may determine\r\n  the appropriate remedy in its discretion.Â  \r\nTo this end, we believe that\r\n  a full financial accounting of both Dixie and Dixie Developers is not the\r\n  appropriate remedy in this matter.Â  First, HCHâ€™s only purpose in naming Dixie\r\n  Developers as a party to the immediate action was because the funds which HCH\r\n  sought were in a Dixie Developers bank account that was inaccessible to HCH.Â \r\n  Otherwise, Dixie Developers is a completely separate entity from Dixie, and therefore, any right to an accounting for Dixie Developers is irrelevant in this\r\n  case.Â  \r\nSecond, as explained more\r\n  fully in Section II, we find that the only contentious issue remaining incidental\r\n  to the dissolution of Dixie is the distribution of approximately $42,000 from\r\n  the sale of 15 Felix.Â  The record reveals that Dixieâ€™s last business\r\n  transaction occurred nearly seven years ago with the sale of 22 Felix in\r\n  December 2001.Â  In the meantime, neither the parties nor any creditors have\r\n  asserted any legitimate outstanding liabilities incurred by Dixie, nor are\r\n  there any other Dixie assets to which any member is legitimately claiming\r\n  entitlement.Â  Because the source of the partiesâ€™ dispute is a relatively small sum\r\n  of money generated from a single real estate transaction - the sale of 15 Felix\r\n  - in April 2000, we find that a full financial accounting would unnecessarily\r\n  prolong this otherwise simple matter.Â  See 1 Am. Jur. 2d Accounts and\r\n    Accounting Â§ 56 (2005) (noting that an accounting is an appropriate remedy\r\n  when the accounts at issue are complicated or mutual). Â Â \r\nFor these reasons, we hold\r\n  that a full accounting of either Dixie or Dixie Developers is neither required\r\n  nor necessary in this action and that the proper resolution in this matter is\r\n  for this Court to make a single determination of the partiesâ€™ rights with\r\n  respect to the proceeds from the sale of 15 Felix.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the\r\n  decision of the court of appeals remanding the case for a full accounting of Dixie.\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Distribution\r\n  of sale proceeds from 15 Felix\r\nMallon\r\n  argues that HCH is not entitled to one-half of the proceeds from 15 Felix.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Mallon contends that he is entitled to set-off of the 15 Felix proceeds for\r\n  nearly $10,000 in additional charges for construction work and miscellaneous\r\n  expenses related to each of Dixieâ€™s Felix Street properties, and another\r\n  $90,000 in similar outstanding charges associated with Dixie Developersâ€™\r\n  properties.Â  We disagree.\r\nBecause\r\n  the underlying action primarily arises in the Courtâ€™s equity jurisdiction, we\r\n  review the masterâ€™s determination of the partiesâ€™ rights with respect to the 15 Felix proceeds de novo.Â  See Elias v. Firemenâ€™s Ins. Co., 309 S.C. 129, 132, 420 S.E.2d 504, 505 (1992)\r\n  (finding that an action\r\n  may be legal or equitable, depending upon whether law or equity would have had jurisdiction if\r\n  there had been no declaratory\r\n  judgment procedure).Â  \r\nMallon\r\n  initially raised the issue of his additional expenses associated with Dixie\r\n  Developers and each of Dixieâ€™s Felix Street properties in May 2003 and did not\r\n  formally assert the right to set-off for these additional expenses until he\r\n  filed his amended (and untimely) answer, without prejudice to HCHâ€™s rights, in\r\n  October 2003.Â  The preceding February, however, Mallon failed to respond to\r\n  HCHâ€™s Requests for Admission, which included the admission that â€œHCH is\r\n  entitled to about 50% of said proceeds.â€Â  Rule 36, SCRCP, provides that a matter\r\n  is deemed admitted when the party served fails to respond with a written answer\r\n  or objection regarding the admission.Â  Although the matter could be resolved at\r\n  this juncture under Rule 36, we proceed with an analysis of Mallonâ€™s right to\r\n  set-off, thereby providing additional legal and equitable grounds for the\r\n  Courtâ€™s conclusion. Â Â Â \r\na.&nbsp; Additional\r\n  expenses associated with Dixie Developers\r\nMallon asserts that he\r\n  underwrote the cost of numerous building repair projects and incurred other miscellaneous\r\n  expenses, totaling nearly $90,000 with respect to Dixie Developersâ€™\r\n  properties.Â  We hold that Mallon is not entitled to set-off of the funds at\r\n  issue for charges associated with Dixie Developers based on the theories of\r\n  accord and satisfaction and mutuality.Â  \r\nThe elements of an accord and satisfaction are an agreement between the parties to settle a dispute, and the payment of\r\n  the consideration which supports the agreement.Â  Wilson v. Builders\r\n    Transp., Inc., 330 S.C. 287, 297, 498 S.E.2d 674, 680 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  To\r\n  constitute accord and satisfaction, there must have been a meeting of the\r\n  minds.Â  Tremont Constr. Co. Inc. v. Dunlap, 310 S.C. 180, 182, 425\r\n  S.E.2d 792, 793 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  In our opinion, Mallonâ€™s December 1999\r\n  buy-out of HCHâ€™s interest in Dixie Developers constitutes an act of accord and\r\n  satisfaction with respect to HCHâ€™s liability for charges associated with the\r\n  Dixie Developers properties.Â  The amendment to the Dixie Developers operating\r\n  agreement made pursuant to the buy-out, and reflecting Mallonâ€™s 100% ownership\r\n  clearly indicates the partiesâ€™ agreement to wind up their business relationship\r\n  through Mallonâ€™s purchase of HCHâ€™s interest for fair value.Â  The circumstances\r\n  surrounding the negotiation of the terms of the buy-out are further evidence of\r\n  the parties meeting of the minds in this regard.Â  Although HCH and Mallon originally\r\n  negotiated a price of $80,000 for HCHâ€™s interest in Dixie Developers, Mallon\r\n  asserted additional charges related to the Dixie Developers property shortly thereafter.Â \r\n  After further negotiations, the parties agreed on an adjusted purchase price of\r\n  $63,500, and HCH refunded the difference to Mallon.Â  For these reasons, we hold\r\n  that the buy-out constituted an accord and satisfaction of any liability to\r\n  Dixie Developers on the part of HCH, and therefore, Mallon is not entitled to\r\n  set-off for expenses alleged after the fact. \r\nLack of mutuality is an\r\n  additional theory prohibiting the set-off of Mallonâ€™s alleged charges related\r\n  to Dixie Developers from the proceeds of 15 Felix.Â  The general rule governing set-off provides that\r\n  the demands to be set off must be mutual, and that debts accruing in different\r\n  rights cannot be set off against each other.Â  Puerifoy v. Gamble, 145\r\n  S.C. 1, 11, 142 S.E. 788, 791 (1927).Â  In our view, HCHâ€™s alleged debt to Mallon for\r\n  Dixie Developersâ€™ work and Mallonâ€™s withholding of HCHâ€™s proceeds from the sale\r\n  of 15 Felix, a Dixie property, are clearly not mutual demands.Â  The two companies\r\n  were distinct entities, set up at different times by different members, and at\r\n  no time had any shared ownership of the properties they listed for sale.Â \r\n  Although the companies apparently shared a bank account during the time that\r\n  HCH was still a member of Dixie Developers, we find this to be more indicative\r\n  of poor fiscal management skills than mutuality.Â  Otherwise, Dixie Developers\r\n  is a completely separate entity from Dixie, and Mallon is not entitled to set off\r\n  his expenses associated with Dixie Developers from the proceeds of property\r\n  belonging to Dixie.[6] \r\nb.&nbsp; Additional expenses\r\n  associated with Felix Street properties\r\nMallonâ€™s\r\n  asserts that he is entitled to reimbursement for nearly $10,000 in construction\r\n  work and miscellaneous expenses associated with Dixieâ€™s Felix Street properties.Â \r\n  We hold that that\r\n  under theories of laches and waiver, Mallon is not entitled to set-off of the\r\n  15 Felix proceeds for expenses associated with the development of the Felix\r\n  Street properties.Â  \r\nLaches\r\n  is an equitable doctrine defined as â€œneglect for an unreasonable and\r\n  unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for\r\n  diligence, to do what in law should have been done.â€Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296\r\n  S.C. 195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â  In order to establish laches as a\r\n  defense, a party must show that the complaining party unreasonably delayed its\r\n  assertion of a right, resulting in prejudice to the party asserting the defense\r\n  of laches.Â  See Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 83, 650 S.E.2d\r\n  465, 469 (2007).\r\nA\r\n  timeline of the relevant events is instructive to the Courtâ€™s analysis.Â  Number\r\n  12 Felix sold in December 1998, 10 Felix in April 1999, 15 Felix in April 2000,\r\n  and 22 Felix in December 2001.Â  The record reveals that except for the\r\n  distribution of the 15 Felix proceeds at issue here, Mallon and HCH\r\n  unconditionally agreed on a fifty-fifty distribution of proceeds at the closings\r\n  for each of the Felix Street properties.Â  The record also reveals that Mallon\r\n  and HCH had established a course of dealing in each of their business ventures\r\n  for reimbursement of additional expenses.[7]Â \r\n  Pursuant to this course of dealing, Mallon would produce an itemized request\r\n  for reimbursement, and HCH would tender the appropriate payment through either\r\n  an adjustment in the standard distribution of sale proceeds at closing, or with\r\n  a separate check for the total costs. [8]Â  \r\nGiven\r\n  this established course of dealing between the parties, Mallonâ€™s May 2003\r\n  demand for reimbursement for charges associated with the Felix Street\r\n  properties - a three-year-plus delay from the date of sale of three of the\r\n  properties, and a twenty-month delay from the date of sale of the fourth\r\n  property - is unreasonable.Â  Furthermore, HCH relied on Mallonâ€™s delay to its\r\n  detriment by not seeking timely reimbursement of its own expenses in developing\r\n  the property and by further agreeing to sell the properties at a specified\r\n  price in anticipation of a certain profit.Â  Accordingly, the doctrine of laches\r\n  bars Mallon from setting off HCHâ€™s one-half interest in the 15 Felix proceeds\r\n  with untimely allegations of his outstanding expenses on the Felix Street properties.\r\nTo\r\n  the extent that the clause in Dixieâ€™s operating agreement providing for\r\n  reimbursement â€œfor all authorized, direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred by\r\n  [members] on behalf of the Company,â€ entitles Mallon to recoup his expenses at\r\n  this late date, we hold that Mallon has waived this right by untimely asserting\r\n  the alleged expenses and in a manner totally inconsistent with the partiesâ€™\r\n  prior course of dealing.Â  See Janasik, 307 S.C. at 344, 415 S.E.2d at\r\n  387-88 (defining waiver as the voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment\r\n  of a known right by a party that knew of its rights, or of all the material facts\r\n  upon which they depended).Â  \r\nFor these reasons, we find\r\n  that Mallon is not entitled to set-off for his latent expenses, and that\r\n  therefore, Mallon and HCH are each entitled to half of the proceeds from 15\r\n  Felix representing their respective interests in Dixie. \r\nIII.&nbsp; Relief\r\n  based on Mallonâ€™s wrongful dissociation\r\nMallon\r\n  argues that the master erred in holding that the relief granted to HCH was\r\n  justified by Mallonâ€™s wrongful dissociation from Dixie.Â  We agree, but hold\r\n  that the masterâ€™s error was harmless.\r\nTo\r\n  warrant reversal based on the admissibility of evidence, an appellant must\r\n  prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice.Â  Connor v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467, 611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005).Â  The substance of the\r\n  instant litigation involves matters of accounting and distribution incidental\r\n  to the judicial dissolution of Dixie.Â  Mallonâ€™s dissociation, which did not\r\n  even occur until after HCH filed its complaint, is completely irrelevant and therefore,\r\n  the master erred in basing his remedy on Mallonâ€™s allegedly wrongful\r\n  dissociation.Â  However, because there were additional legitimate grounds upon\r\n  which the master granted relief to HCH, we hold the error was harmless. Â \r\nIV.&nbsp; Exclusion of evidence of Cokerâ€™s\r\n  self-dealing\r\nMallon\r\n  argues that the master erred in excluding evidence of Cokerâ€™s self-dealing and\r\n  misappropriation of Dixieâ€™s funds.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is a matter left to the discretion of the trial judge and\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Hanahan v.\r\n    Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 155, 485 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1997).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary\r\n  support.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 529, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121\r\n  (2004).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the parties agreed to provide each other all documents to be\r\n  presented at trial by November 21, 2003.Â  On the last working day before trial\r\n  in January 2004, Mallon alleged for the first time in an amended pre-trial\r\n  brief that Coker misappropriated Dixie funds and engaged in self-dealing.Â  The\r\n  master granted HCHâ€™s motion in limine to exclude all â€œnew documentsâ€ and\r\n  sustained each of HCHâ€™s objections to Mallonâ€™s trial testimony which attempted\r\n  to justify improperly escrowing the 15 Felix proceeds based on his alleged\r\n  discovery of Cokerâ€™s misappropriation of Dixie funds.Â  Citing Scott v.\r\n    Greenville Housing Authority, 353 S.C. 639, 652, 579 S.E.2d 151, 158 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2003), the master found that exclusion of evidence of Cokerâ€™s self-dealing\r\n  was proper because the rules of discovery â€œmandate full and fair disclosure to\r\n  prevent a trial from becoming a guessing game or one of ambush for either party.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  deciding what sanction to impose for failure to disclose evidence during the\r\n  discovery process under Rule 37, SCRCP, the trial court should weigh the nature\r\n  of the interrogatories, the discovery posture of the case, willfulness, and the\r\n  degree of prejudice.Â  Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 112, 495 S.E.2d\r\n  213, 216 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In the order, the master noted Mallonâ€™s\r\n  earlier failure to respond to HCHâ€™s requests for admission, along with both\r\n  partiesâ€™ stipulation that they had agreed to exchange their entire files on the\r\n  case on or before November 21, 2003.Â  Although Mallon asserts that HCH would\r\n  not have been prejudiced by the evidence of Cokerâ€™s self-dealing because it\r\n  came from documents provided to Mallon by HCH itself, Mallon neglects to\r\n  consider the prejudicial effect of an â€œambushâ€ at trial.Â  For these reasons, we\r\n  hold that the master did not abuse his discretion in excluding evidence of\r\n  self-dealing by Coker.Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; Award of\r\n  pre-judgment interest\r\nMallon\r\n  argues that the master erred in awarding prejudgment interest on the\r\n  distribution to HCH because the sum was not liquidated.Â  We agree.\r\nThe law permits the award of prejudgment interest when\r\n  a monetary obligation is a sum certain, or is capable of being reduced to\r\n  certainty, accruing from the time payment may be demanded either by the\r\n  agreement&nbsp;of the parties or the operation of law.Â  Butler Contr., Inc. v. Court St., LLC, 369 S.C. 121, 133,&nbsp;631\r\n  S.E.2d 252, 259 (2006).Â  Generally, prejudgment interest may not be recovered\r\n  on an unliquidated claim in the absence of agreement or statute.Â  Id.Â  The fact that the amount due is disputed does not render the claim\r\n  unliquidated for purposes of awarding prejudgment interest.Â  Rather, the proper\r\n  test is â€œwhether or not the measure of recovery, not necessarily the amount of\r\n  damages, is fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  award of prejudgment interest will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial\r\n  court committed an abuse of discretion.Â  Jacobs v. Am. Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,\r\n  287 S.C. 541, 544, 340 S.E.2d 142, 143 (1986).Â  In this case, the master\r\n  awarded prejudgment interest because â€œ[HCH] is entitled to half of the funds,\r\n  and because [HCH] has not had access to the funds for almost four years now.â€Â  We\r\n  find that this ruling conflicts with this Courtâ€™s established law, and is not\r\n  reasonably supported by the evidence in the record. Â \r\nThe\r\n  record reveals that the disagreement between Mallon and Coker over Cokerâ€™s\r\n  method of accounting led to the escrow of the 15 Felix proceeds at issue in the\r\n  instant case.Â  Prior to the sale of 15 Felix, the net proceeds from the sales\r\n  of Dixieâ€™s property had been divided fifty-fifty.Â  Â The logical conclusion to\r\n  be drawn from this pattern of events is that the members of Dixie were\r\n  contemplating a future distribution of the escrowed funds that, depending on\r\n  the outcome of a complete accounting, may not have been the standard fifty-fifty\r\n  split.Â  Under these circumstances, we find that the measure of recovery for\r\n  prejudgment interest was unliquidated at the time the partiesâ€™\r\n    claims to the proceeds arose, and accordingly, we hold that the master erred in\r\n    awarding prejudgment interest to HCH.\r\nVI.&nbsp; Attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees\r\nMallon\r\n  argues that the court of appeals erred in upholding the masterâ€™s award of\r\n  statutory attorneysâ€™ fees to HCH.Â  We agree.\r\nAttorneyâ€™s fees are not\r\n  recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute. See Jackson v. Speed,\r\n  326 S.C. 289, 307, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997).Â  In this case, the master\r\n  awarded HCH attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-1104 (2006),\r\n  which authorizes the award of reasonable costs and attorneysâ€™ fees to a\r\n  plaintiff who prevails, in whole or in part, in a derivative action for an LLC.Â \r\n  A claim for statutory attorneysâ€™ fees is an action at law resting within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court and may not be disturbed on appeal absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Patel, 359 S.C. at 533, 599 S.E.2d at 123.\r\nMallon\r\n  argues that it is inequitable to award HCH attorneysâ€™ fees because Cokerâ€™s\r\n  failure to fulfill his responsibilities under the operating agreement\r\n  necessitated the instant action.Â  The court of appeals rejected this argument,\r\n  ruling instead that Mallonâ€™s actions brought about the case, and therefore held\r\n  that the masterâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees did not amount to an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  award of statutory attorneysâ€™ fees does not fall within a courtâ€™s equitable\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  See Harvey v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 338 S.C. 500, 507,\r\n  527 S.E.2d 765, 769 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that where the right to relief is\r\n  entirely statutory, the action is one at law).Â  Therefore, we hold that the\r\n  court of appeals erred in affirming the masterâ€™s award on these grounds.Â  We\r\n  note, however, that even if the award of attorneysâ€™ fees in this case sounded\r\n  in equity, in our opinion, the equities fall in favor of each side bearing\r\n  responsibility for their own attorneysâ€™ fees because both parties won on some\r\n  matters and lost on others, and neither entered the instant litigation with\r\n  clean hands.Â  \r\nRather,\r\n  as a matter of law, we find that HCH failed to properly plead the instant case\r\n  as a shareholder derivative action as required by the relevant attorneysâ€™ fee\r\n  statute, and accordingly, we hold that the master committed an abuse of\r\n  discretion in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees under the attorneysâ€™ fee provision of\r\n  the LLC Act.Â  Our courts have held that â€œ[i]t is the substance of the requested relief that\r\n  matters â€˜regardless of the form in which the request for relief was framed.â€™â€Â  Richland County v. Kaiser, 351 S.C. 89, 94, 567 S.E.2d 260, 262 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Standard\r\n    Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Mungo, 306 S.C. 22, 26, 410 S.E.2d 18, 20\r\n  (Ct. App. 1991)).Â  Although in the instant case, HCH submitted a verified\r\n  complaint declaring in the opening sentence that HCH brought the action\r\n  â€œindividually and in a derivative capacity,â€ the complaint nevertheless failed\r\n  to plead with particularity the allegations necessary to state a complaint in a\r\n  shareholder derivative action.Â  See Rule 23(b), SCRCP.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  relief granted by the master was entirely personal to HCH in that the master\r\n  ordered the distribution of HCHâ€™s interest in the Felix Street proceeds\r\n  directly to HCH instead of an initial return of the converted funds in whole to\r\n  Dixie as an entity.Â  See also Ward v. Griffin, 295 S.C. 219, 221, 367\r\n  S.E.2d 703, 704 (Ct. App. 1988) (determining that a suit may be classified as a\r\n  shareholder derivative action â€œif the gravamen of the complaint is injury to\r\n  the corporation and not injury to the individual interests of the stockholderâ€).Â \r\n  For these reasons, we cannot construe the complaint to be a prayer for derivative\r\n  relief on behalf of Dixie.Â  See also Rule 8(f), SCRCP (providing that\r\n  pleadings should be construed â€œto do substantial justice to all partiesâ€).Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  HCH failed to plead the instant case as a shareholder derivative action, we\r\n  hold that the master erred in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees under Â§ 33-44-1104 of\r\n  the LLC Act.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and\r\n  hold that Mallon and HCH are responsible for their own attorneysâ€™ fees in this\r\n  matter.[9] Â Â \r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we hold that a full accounting of Dixie and Dixie\r\n  Developers is not required and that HCH is entitled to one-half of the proceeds\r\n  from the sale of 15 Felix.Â  We further hold that the masterâ€™s grant of relief\r\n  based on Mallonâ€™s allegedly wrongful dissociation from Dixie was harmless error\r\n  and that the master did not err in excluding evidence of Cokerâ€™s self-dealing.Â \r\n  Finally, we hold that HCH is not entitled to either prejudgment interest or\r\n  statutory attorneysâ€™ fees in this matter.Â  This dispute began in 2000, nearly\r\n  eight years ago, and involves a relatively small amount of money and a small\r\n  number of members.Â  Although we respect the dissentâ€™s position, in our view,\r\n  remanding this case after years of litigation for a full accounting is not\r\n  required by law or equity or by the partiesâ€™ agreement and no beneficial\r\n  purpose would be served in prolonging this case.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the\r\n  decision of the court of appeals.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  J., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and James E. Lockemy, concur. PLEICONES,\r\n  J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent from part I and part II of the\r\n  majority opinion.Â  \r\nI\r\n  agree with the majority in their finding that the master committed harmless\r\n  error in holding that the relief granted to HCH was justified by Mallonâ€™s\r\n  dissociation from Dixie.Â  I also agree with the majorityâ€™s finding that the\r\n  master did not abuse his discretion in excluding evidence of self-dealing and\r\n  misappropriation of Dixieâ€™s funds by Coker.Â  Moreover, I agree with the\r\n  majority that the master erred in awarding prejudgment interest to HCH, because\r\n  the amount awarded HCH was not liquidated at the time the partiesâ€™ claims to\r\n  the proceeds arose.Â  Furthermore, I agree with the majority that HCH failed to\r\n  plead the instant case as a shareholder derivative action; therefore, the\r\n  master erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees under Â§ 33-44-1104 (2006) of the LLC\r\n  Act.Â  However, I respectfully disagree with the majorityâ€™s finding that Mallon\r\n  is not entitled to a full accounting for Dixie Holdings, and that HCH is\r\n  entitled to one-half of the proceeds from the sale of 15 Felix Street. \r\nPursuant\r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-103 (2006), operating agreements are binding\r\n  contracts which are superior to statutory authority where they are in place.Â \r\n  Statutory law; however, will apply if the operating agreement is silent as to\r\n  some matter. Therefore, when a court is deciding a controversy between limited\r\n  liability company members, it must first evaluate the operating agreement\r\n  regarding a particular issue prior to looking to the statutory law governing\r\n  areas not covered by the agreement.\r\nSection\r\n  12.6 of the Dixie Holdingsâ€™ operating agreement is relevant to Mallonâ€™s claims\r\n  for reimbursement and the need for a full accounting.Â  The section, entitled\r\n  â€œFinal Accounting,â€ states that â€œeach of the members shall be furnished with a\r\n  statement setting forth the assets and liabilities of the Company as of the\r\n  date of the complete liquidation,â€ and â€œ[u]pon compliance by the Company with\r\n  the foregoing distribution plan, the Members shall cease to be such, and they\r\n  shall execute and cause to be filed any and all documents necessary with\r\n  respect to termination and cancellation.â€Â Â  \r\nDixie\r\n  Holdingsâ€™ operating agreement thus requires an accounting prior to dissolution.[10] Because the operating agreement required an accounting, and since operating\r\n  agreements govern the affairs of the company and the\r\n  conduct of its business according to Â§ 33-44-103 (2006) of the LLC Act, an\r\n  accounting is necessary prior to the dissolution of Dixie Holdingsâ€™ and the\r\n  distribution of the $41,845.30 from the sale of 15 Felix Street.Â Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if an accounting were not mandatory according to the operating agreement, a\r\n  full accounting would have been necessary according to statute under the facts\r\n  of this case.Â  Pursuant to Â§ 33-44-410 (a)(1) (2006) of the S.C. Code, a member\r\n  is entitled to maintain a suit for an accounting.Â  When that request\r\n  is made in the context of an action winding up the business of a limited\r\n  liability company, courts are required to determine the assets, discharge\r\n  obligations to creditors, and distribute the surplus to members.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 33-44-806 (a) (2006). Â Â In order to complete the winding up of Dixie Holdings, I would hold that a full accounting is\r\n  required and necessary under the LLC Act even if it were not required by the\r\n  agreement. \r\nFurther,\r\n  I respectfully disagree with the majority that Mallon waived his right to an\r\n  accounting.Â  As defined by Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop.\r\n    Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387-88 (1992), a waiver is a\r\n  voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known right. \r\nThe\r\n  majority finds that Mallon waived his right to an accounting by failing to\r\n  independently resolve the matter when he and Coker both had access to the bank\r\n  records.Â  I respectfully disagree.Â  Dixie Holdingsâ€™ operating agreement does not\r\n  list each Memberâ€™s role within the limited liability company.Â  Each member;\r\n  however, carried out specific duties: Coker performed accounting and financial\r\n  related services, Storen acted as the real estate agent, and Mallon renovated\r\n  the properties. Mallon was also a co-signatory on the first Dixie Developers\r\n  bank account and equally capable of acquiring the bank records. Having access\r\n  to the bank records is not the equivalent of an accounting. In order to\r\n  complete a formal accounting necessary for the dissolution of a company, one\r\n  must have access to all financial documents such as the companyâ€™s income\r\n  statements and balance sheets. Since Mallon did not have access to all\r\n  documents necessary to compete a full accounting he could not have waived this\r\n  right. Moreover, there is no evidence of a voluntary and intentional\r\n  relinquishment of Mallonâ€™s contractual statutory rights.Â Â  \r\nBoth\r\n  HCH and Mallon in their pleadings requested a full accounting. In his answer,\r\n  Mallon asserted â€œan accounting is appropriate for both parties, and that Coker,\r\n  who acted as the financial officer of Dixie [Holdings] has repeatedly and\r\n  improperly failed to prepare a proper accounting, which should now be done.â€\r\n  Therefore, there is no evidence that Mallon voluntarily and intentionally\r\n  abandoned his right to an accounting. \r\nIn\r\n  conclusion, I am in agreement with the Court of Appeals holding that this case\r\n  should be remanded for a full accounting of the LLC, and the proceeds from the\r\n  sale of 15 Felix Street should be held in an escrow account, in accordance with\r\n  the operating agreement, for the benefit of Dixie Holdings until a final\r\n  accounting is performed and the appropriate amounts distributed accordingly.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  the reasons stated above, the Court of Appeals decision should be affirmed in\r\n  part, reversed in part, and the matter remanded to the master for a full\r\n  accounting. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The partiesâ€™ testimony on various aspects of Dixieâ€™s business arrangement,\r\n  particularly with regard to Storen, was vague and often conflicting.Â  Because\r\n  Storenâ€™s participation is irrelevant to the issues before this Court, we do not\r\n  attempt to parse out the details of Mallonâ€™s and HCHâ€™s business relationship\r\n  with Storen.\r\n[2] The court of appeals remanded this case for a formal\r\n  accounting of Dixie, but held that Mallonâ€™s request for an accounting for Dixie\r\n  Developers and all Mallonâ€™s remaining issues except a subpart of the attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees issue were not preserved for appeal.Â  Unless otherwise noted, we find that\r\n  each of these issues were raised to and ruled upon by the master and that the\r\n  court of appeals therefore erred in dismissing them on preservation grounds, see\r\n    Iâ€™On, LLC v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724\r\n  (2000) (acknowledging that an issue raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the lower court is preserved for appellate review), and we\r\n  proceed with an analysis of their merits in the interest of judicial economy.Â  See\r\n    S. Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Hamm, 306 S.C. 70, 75, 409 S.E.2d\r\n  775, 778 (1991) (deciding an issue on appeal in the interest of judicial\r\n  economy).\r\n[3] See also Carmen Harper Thomas, Note, Limited Liability Companies Are\r\n  Off and Running:Â  Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC v. Mallon, Accountings,\r\n    and Derivative Actions in LLC Litigation, 57 S.C. L. Rev. 441, 453 (2006). \r\n[4] Mallon and Storen testified that they requested financial documents from Coker\r\n  multiple times, and that when Coker finally complied, the documents provided\r\n  were inadequate and incomplete.Â  Mallon, however, as co-signatory on the first\r\n  Dixie Developers bank account, was equally capable of acquiring the bank\r\n  records and, upon receiving Dixieâ€™s financial documents from Coker, taking the\r\n  documents to a certified public accountant for an accounting.Â  Mallon claimed\r\n  to have done this much, but refused to name the accountant and never produced\r\n  any documents generated out of this review.\r\n[5] We also question the dissentâ€™s interpretation of the\r\n  operating agreement to require that an accounting be provided â€œprior to\r\n  dissolution.â€Â  Under the express terms of the agreement, the financial\r\n  statement is to be furnished â€œas of the date of complete liquidation.â€Â  See\r\n    also Thomas, supra note 3, at 454.Â  \r\n[6] Mallon points out that the lack of strict mutuality does not per\r\n  se prohibit a court exercising its equity jurisdiction from allowing set-off.Â  See W.\r\n    M. Kirkland, Inc. v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 264 S.C. 573, 581, 216\r\n  S.E.2d 518, 521 (1975).Â  However,\r\n  considering the lack of strict mutuality in conjunction with the accord and\r\n  satisfaction that occurred between the parties with respect to Dixie\r\n  Developersâ€™ financial affairs, this Court is fully justified in refusing to permit\r\n  an equitable set-off under the circumstances.Â  \r\n[7] Aside from their relationship through Dixie and Dixie Developers, Mallon and\r\n  HCH appear to have also jointly owned numerous other pieces of property for\r\n  real estate development purposes.\r\n[8] The record contains at least two documents\r\n  representative of the partiesâ€™ course of dealing:Â  (1) a September 1999\r\n  addendum to a settlement statement explaining the uneven distribution of funds\r\n  from the sale of a Dixie Developers property to Mallon and Coker due to\r\n  Mallonâ€™s expenses in performing construction and repair work on the property;\r\n  and (2) a May 1999 reimbursement check from HCH to Mallon based on an itemized\r\n  list of Mallonâ€™s expenses associated with their shared real estate assets,\r\n  including several of the Felix Street properties.Â  \r\n[9] In light of our holding, we need not address Mallonâ€™s\r\n  remaining evidentiary arguments regarding the masterâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing that an appellate court need not address\r\n  additional issues if the resolution of another issue is dispositive).Â  Â \r\n[10] I disagree with the majorityâ€™s assertion that the operating agreement does not\r\n  require an accounting prior to dissolution.Â  In construing a contract, this\r\n  Courtâ€™s main concern is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the\r\n  parties. D.A. Davis Const. Co., Inc. v. Palmetto Properties, Inc., 281\r\n  S.C. 415, 315 S.E.2d 370 (1984).Â  The order of the sentences in section 12.6\r\n  suggests the chronology of the actions.Â  The section sets forth the accounting\r\n  requirement and then provides that â€œ[u]pon the compliance by the Company with\r\n  the foregoing distribution planâ€ the Company will terminate.Â  This suggests\r\n  that the accounting should be completed before dissolution.Â  Reading the policy\r\n  in this way also produces a more reasonable result, since an accounting prior\r\n  to liquidation may have an impact upon distribution, while an accounting after\r\n  liquidation will not.Â  â€œCommon sense and good faith are leading touchstones of\r\n  construction of provisions of contract; where one construction makes provisions\r\n  unusual or extraordinary and another construction, which is equally consistent\r\n  with language employed, would make it reasonable, fair, and just, latter\r\n  construction must prevail.â€ C.A.N. Enterprises, Inc. v. South Carolina\r\n    Health and Human Services Finance Comâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 373 S.E.2d 584\r\n  (1988).Â  Finally, in ascertaining the intent of the parties, we may examine the\r\n  situation of the parties as well as their purposes at the time the contract was\r\n  entered into. Klutts Resort Realty, Inc. v. Downâ€™Round Development Corp.,\r\n  268 S.C. 80, 232 S.E.2d 20 (1977).Â  As noted above, the parties met and signed\r\n  the operating agreement in part due to dissatisfaction with Cokerâ€™s responses\r\n  to multiple requests by Mallon and Storen for full financial accounting of Dixie.Â  Given the events leading up to the meeting, it is unlikely that the parties\r\n  intended for the operating agreement to require a final accounting after\r\n  dissolution, at which point the assets would be distributed.Â  The more logical\r\n  reading is that the provision was meant to provide Mallon and Storen with\r\n  assurances that they were receiving their fair share of the assets.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26602","title":"In the Matter of Glenn Oliver Gray","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26602","description":"In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Court imposed, among other sanctions, a nine-month suspension.","date":"2009-02-17","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of Glenn Oliver Gray, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26602\r\nHeard December 4, 2008 - Filed February\r\n  17, 2009Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel,\r\n  and C. Tex Davis, Jr., Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tDesa Ballard,\r\n  of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  This is an attorney\r\n  disciplinary matter involving a grievance against Glenn Oliver Gray\r\n  (Respondent) by his former law firm for engaging in improper billing and\r\n  reimbursement requests.Â  After a hearing before the Commission on Lawyer\r\n  Conduct Full Panel (Panel), the Panel recommended that Respondent, who admitted\r\n  to the alleged misconduct, be suspended for a period of not more than 180 days.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) appeals and argues that the facts and\r\n  similar case law warrant a harsher sanction.Â  We agree and impose a nine-month\r\n  suspension.Â  In addition, Respondent is to:Â  (1) pay the costs of this\r\n  disciplinary proceeding; (2) reimburse the law firm for improper travel\r\n  requests; (3) continue counseling for one year after the date of his suspension,\r\n  during which time his therapist shall file a report every six months with the\r\n  ODC documenting Respondentâ€™s progress; and (4) appear before the Committee on\r\n  Character and Fitness before his reinstatement.\r\nFACTS\r\nAfter\r\n  being admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1989, Respondent moved to New York to practice law.Â  Respondent was admitted to the New York Bar and New Jersey Bar\r\n  in 1990.Â  In 2001, Respondent moved back to South Carolina when he was hired as\r\n  an associate by the Law Firm.Â  In December 2003, Respondentâ€™s group manager expressed\r\n  concern to the Law Firmâ€™s management committee regarding Respondentâ€™s\r\n  performance.Â  Based on Respondentâ€™s year-end performance evaluation, the\r\n  management committee formalized an â€œexit strategy,â€ which would provide for Respondent\r\n  to continue working at the firm for a period of time in order that Respondent\r\n  could pursue other employment.Â  In preparation for the meeting with Respondent,\r\n  a member of the management committee accessed Respondentâ€™s â€œtimekeeperâ€™s\r\n  records.â€ Â In doing so, he found a number of improper billing entries in which\r\n  there were discrepancies between the time billed and the time actually spent on\r\n  the item. Â Based on this discovery, the management committee determined that\r\n  the appropriate course of action was to immediately terminate Respondent on\r\n  February 4, 2004. \r\nAfter Respondentâ€™s\r\n  termination, members of the management committee conducted an audit of\r\n  Respondentâ€™s time entries and reimbursement requests from January 1, 2003,\r\n  through February 4, 2004. Â During their investigation, they found a file in\r\n  Respondentâ€™s desk containing old airline tickets, altered copies of those\r\n  tickets, blank reimbursement forms, scissors, tape, and â€œwhite-outâ€ solution. \r\nDue to Respondentâ€™s\r\n  actions, the Law Firm filed a letter with the ODC on May 25, 2004. Â In this\r\n  letter, the Law Firm outlined Respondentâ€™s misconduct leading up to his\r\n  termination and explained the results of Respondentâ€™s post-termination audit.Â \r\n  According to the Law Firm, this investigation revealed â€œexcessive and\r\n  fictitious time entries on client files during the audit periodâ€ and\r\n  â€œfictitious travel invoices and tickets.â€Â  In light of this improper billing,\r\n  the Law Firm claimed it reimbursed $14,163.31 to the affected clients.Â  The Law\r\n  Firm also discovered that it had reimbursed Respondent in excess of $600 based\r\n  on his fictitious travel invoices and airline tickets. Â \r\nFollowing a full\r\n  investigation, the investigative panel authorized formal charges against\r\n  Respondent.Â  On June 18, 2007, the ODC filed formal charges against\r\n  Respondent.Â  In his initial Response dated July 18, 2007, Respondent admitted\r\n  misconduct but denied some of the charges.Â  In an Amended Response, Respondent\r\n  again admitted misconduct but also admitted to all of the charges.Â \r\n  Additionally, Respondent requested that he only be sanctioned to a definite\r\n  suspension of 180 days.\r\nOn December 12,\r\n  2007, the Panel conducted a hearing.Â  At the hearing, Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  presented two members of the Law Firm as witnesses.Â  The first witness, a\r\n  member of the firmâ€™s management committee, explained in detail what transpired\r\n  before and after Respondentâ€™s termination.Â  He testified that in conducting an\r\n  audit of Respondentâ€™s time records he discovered that Respondent had billed\r\n  more than necessary for his travel and the work performed on clientsâ€™ cases.Â  He\r\n  made the decision to further investigate into Respondentâ€™s case files after he\r\n  found billing irregularities.Â  In executing this decision, he searched\r\n  Respondentâ€™s office the morning after Respondentâ€™s termination, which led to\r\n  the discovery of a folder containing materials used to â€œdoctorâ€ the firmâ€™s\r\n  reimbursement forms.Â  Upon further investigation, he determined that Respondent\r\n  had improperly charged clients and the firm for travel time, travel expenses,\r\n  airline tickets, and mileage.Â  \r\nA second member of\r\n  the firm testified he also got involved in the audit of Respondentâ€™s files.Â  He\r\n  testified he was â€œtaskedâ€ with retrieving the original time slips from\r\n  Respondentâ€™s office on February 3, 2004. Â Around 7:30 p.m. that evening, he went\r\n  into Respondentâ€™s office and found Respondentâ€™s time records next to his\r\n  computer. Â He then proceeded to copy these records, return the originals, and\r\n  then left the office around 9:00 p.m.Â  When he returned to his office the next\r\n  morning around 7:00 a.m., he discovered that the copies he had made the night\r\n  before were missing from his desk. Â He also discovered that the original time\r\n  records were no longer in Respondentâ€™s office. Â After checking with the Law\r\n  Firmâ€™s building security, it was discovered that Respondent had been let into\r\n  the building some time during the evening of February 3rd.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  this second witness testified he reviewed Respondentâ€™s billing records, he\r\n  stated he primarily focused on Respondentâ€™s improper reimbursement requests as\r\n  evidenced by the file folder found in Respondentâ€™s desk. Â Based on his\r\n  investigation, he testified to the following examples of improper reimbursement\r\n  requests:Â  on several occasions Respondent had altered hotel bills so that he\r\n  would be reimbursed for a greater amount than was actually charged; Respondent\r\n  had submitted the same airline ticket or travel expenses twice for\r\n  reimbursement; and Respondent had altered airline tickets for an amount greater\r\n  than the actual cost of the ticket. Â \r\nAs\r\n  part of his case, Respondent called two character witnesses who testified Respondent\r\n  has a reputation as a â€œperson of honestyâ€ and â€œhe is a truth teller.â€ Â Both\r\n  testified as to Respondentâ€™s good reputation in his church and in the\r\n  community. Â Based upon their knowledge of Respondent, both witnesses believed\r\n  the allegations of misconduct were â€œout of characterâ€ for Respondent.\r\nRespondent,\r\n  the final witness at the hearing, testified regarding the details of his law\r\n  career leading up to his employment as an associate with the Law Firm.Â  When\r\n  questioned about the misconduct allegations, Respondent admitted to the\r\n  misconduct and did not dispute the amount the Law Firm calculated for the\r\n  improper billing and reimbursements. Â He further admitted that he did in fact\r\n  alter the amounts and did so while at work and at home.Â  Respondent, however,\r\n  could not give an estimate as to the amount of time it took for him to alter\r\n  the documents.Â  Additionally, he claimed that he sent the firm a certified\r\n  check in the amount of $669.20 for travel reimbursements that had been paid to\r\n  him.Â  He also denied that he took his original time records and the copies from\r\n  the Law Firm the night before his termination.Â  Respondent believed that a\r\n  sanction of a definite suspension of 180 days would be appropriate. \r\nAfter\r\n  the hearing, the Panel found Respondent engaged in misconduct in violation of\r\n  the following Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR: Â Rule 1.5,\r\n  RPC (fees); Rule 8.4(a), RPC (misconduct); Rule 8.4(d), RPC (misconduct\r\n  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e), RPC\r\n  (misconduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  The Panel\r\n  also found Respondent violated the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement (RDLE), Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule (7)(a)(1) (violates the RPC, Rule\r\n  407, SCACR); Rule 7(a)(5) (engages in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law;); and Rule\r\n  7(a)(6) (violates the oath of office taken to practice law in this state and\r\n  contained in Rule 402(k), SCACR).Â  Â \r\nBased on these\r\n  admitted violations of misconduct, the Panel recommended a sanction of definite\r\n  suspension for a period of 180 days. Â In making this recommendation, the Panel\r\n  primarily relied on this Courtâ€™s decision of In the Matter of Lee, 370\r\n  S.C. 501, 636 S.E.2d 624 (2006) (holding suspension for 180 days was\r\n  appropriate sanction for attorney who overcharged client by charging fees for\r\n  traveling to depositions in which he had participated by telephone from his law\r\n  firmâ€™s office).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  ODC challenges the Panelâ€™s recommendation of a definite suspension of 180 days.Â \r\n  Although the ODC urges this Court to adopt the Panelâ€™s findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law, it requests that this Court impose a sanction of:Â  (1) a\r\n  definite suspension for at least 180 days; (2) a requirement that Respondent be\r\n  examined by the Committee on Character and Fitness prior to his reinstatement;\r\n  (3) a requirement that Respondent reimburse the Law Firm in the amount of\r\n  $14,163.31; and (4) a requirement that Respondent pay to Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  the costs of the proceeding in the amount of $1,124.29.Â  \r\nâ€œThis\r\n  Court has the sole authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the\r\n  appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the record.â€Â  In the Matter\r\n    of Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  â€œAlthough this\r\n  Court is not bound by the findings of the Panel and Committee, these findings\r\n  are entitled to great weight, particularly when the inferences to be drawn from\r\n  the testimony depend on the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â  In the Matter of\r\n    Marshall, 331 S.C. 514, 519, 498 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1998).Â  â€œHowever, this\r\n  Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, a disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence.Â  In the Matter of Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677,\r\n  682 (2006); see Rule 8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (â€œCharges of misconduct or\r\n  incapacity shall be established by clear and convincing evidence, and the\r\n  burden of proof of the charges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.â€).\r\nBecause Respondent\r\n  admitted to all of the allegations of misconduct, the only question before the\r\n  Court is whether to accept the Panelâ€™s recommended sanction of a definite\r\n  suspension of 180 days.Â  \r\nWe believe a more\r\n  severe sanction is warranted.Â  First, Respondentâ€™s case is distinguishable from In the Matter of Lee, which the Panel primarily relied upon in making\r\n  its recommendation.Â  In the Matter of Lee, 370 S.C. 501, 636 S.E.2d 624\r\n  (2006).Â  In Lee, the attorney was a shareholder in a law firm mainly\r\n  engaged in representing clients insured by liability insurance companies.Â  On\r\n  approximately nineteen occasions, the attorney overcharged the insurance\r\n  carrier by including or causing to be included in its billing statement\r\n  attorney fees for traveling to depositions held out of town.Â  The attorney,\r\n  however, knew he had participated in the depositions by telephone at the law\r\n  firmâ€™s office.Â  Additionally, the attorney overcharged the insurance carrier\r\n  for costs by billing the carrier for mileage for traveling to the depositions\r\n  on approximately seventeen of the nineteen occasions.Â  When the overcharges\r\n  were discovered, the attorney admitted to the misconduct and immediately wrote\r\n  a personal check to the law firm for $10,279.40, the amount the law firm was to\r\n  reimburse the insurance carrier.Â  The attorney and a senior partner immediately\r\n  prepared a report for the ODC documenting the attorneyâ€™s misconduct.Â  The next\r\n  day, the attorney and a senior partner traveled out of state to the home office\r\n  of the insurance carrier to report the misconduct and provide the carrier with\r\n  the ODC report.Â  This Court sanctioned the attorney to a definite suspension of\r\n  180 days.Â  The Court reasoned that the attorney had no prior disciplinary\r\n  history and had been fully forthcoming during the investigation of his\r\n  misconduct.Â  The Court, however, conditioned attorneyâ€™s readmission on his\r\n  appearance before the Committee on Character and Fitness to determine whether\r\n  he had the â€œrequisite character and fitness to practice law in this state.â€Â  In\r\n    the Matter of Lee, 370 S.C. at 505, 636 S.E.2d at 626.\r\nTurning\r\n  to the facts of the instant case, Respondent over a period of one year engaged\r\n  in a pattern of conduct that was deliberate, purposeful, deceitful, and\r\n  fraudulent.Â  Not only did Respondent overcharge clients for his time, he also\r\n  altered documents to falsify reimbursement expenses.Â  Furthermore, unlike Lee,\r\n  Respondent never self-reported his misconduct to the ODC.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  conclude that Respondentâ€™s conduct warrants a sanction of definite suspension\r\n  of nine months.Â  Cf. In the Matter of Martin, 374 S.C. 36, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 218 (2007) (holding six-month suspension was the appropriate sanction\r\n  where attorney allocated time and charges to insurance companyâ€™s files on which\r\n  the time billed had not been spent); In the Matter of Jennings, 321 S.C.\r\n  440, 468 S.E.2d 869 (1996) (finding disbarment was warranted by misconduct\r\n  including misrepresentation regarding billing of several clients, lack of\r\n  candor toward the tribunal, destroying documents regarding improper billing,\r\n  forging signature on satisfaction of judgment, misleading family court judge,\r\n  and improperly filing lien for attorneyâ€™s fees).\r\nSecondly, we\r\n  find that Respondent should be required to reimburse a portion of the\r\n  $14,163.31 amount that the Law Firm claims it is owed as a result of\r\n  Respondentâ€™s actions. Â See Rule 7(b)(7), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (stating\r\n  an additional sanction for misconduct may include restitution to persons\r\n  financially injured). Â Although\r\n  Respondent does not dispute that these fees are â€œdue and owedâ€ to the Law Firm,\r\n  we do not believe that Respondent should be responsible for the entire amount.Â \r\n  Because the Law Firm essentially returned money to clients that it collected\r\n  and was not entitled to as a result of Respondentâ€™s improper time/billing\r\n  entries, we find the Law Firm did not experience a financial deficit for its\r\n  reimbursement to these clients with respect to improper billing.Â  However, the\r\n  $14,163.31 amount also includes fictitious travel expenses which would warrant\r\n  reimbursement from Respondent to the Law Firm.Â  At oral argument, the parties\r\n  agreed this amount totaled $669.20.Â  Respondent claimed he sent the Law Firm a\r\n  certified check in the amount of $669.20 for the improper travel reimbursements\r\n  that had been paid to him.Â  However, at oral argument Respondent stated that he\r\n  never received proof that the Law Firm accepted the check.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find that for Respondent to satisfy this requirement he must provide the ODC\r\n  with proof that the Law Firm has received the check.\r\nThirdly, we find\r\n  Respondent should be required to reimburse Disciplinary Counsel for the costs\r\n  of these proceedings in the amount of $1,124.29.Â  Although Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  did not specifically request this relief at the hearing before the Panel,\r\n  counsel incorporated a request for costs in its notice to Respondent of the\r\n  formal charges.Â  See In the Matter of Thompson,&nbsp;343 S.C. 1,\r\n  13, 539 S.E.2d 396, 402&nbsp;(2000) (â€œThe assessment of costs is in the\r\n  discretion of the Court.â€); Rule 27(e)(3), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (â€œThe Supreme\r\n  Court may assess costs against the respondent if it finds the respondent has\r\n  committed misconduct.â€); Rule 7(b)(8), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (stating sanctions\r\n  for misconduct may include the â€œassessment of the costs of the proceedings,\r\n  including the cost of hearings, investigations, service of process and court\r\n  reporter servicesâ€).\r\nFinally,\r\n  we agree with Disciplinary Counselâ€™s request that Respondent be required to\r\n  appear before the Committee on Character and Fitness prior to his reinstatement.\r\n  Â See Rule 7(b)(10), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (the Supreme Court may impose â€œany\r\n  other sanction or requirementâ€ as it deems appropriate). Â As previously stated, Respondentâ€™s actions were a\r\n  deliberate attempt to defraud the Law Firm and its clients.Â  Respondent,\r\n  however, has yet to provide any explanation for his conduct.Â  Because this lack\r\n  of explanation indicates an issue with respect to Respondentâ€™s character, we\r\n  believe it should be addressed prior to his reinstatement.[1]Â  \r\nIn\r\n  conjunction, we find that Respondent should continue to attend the\r\n  psychological counseling that he is currently receiving for a period of one\r\n  year beginning from the date of his suspension.Â  During this one-year period,\r\n  Respondentâ€™s therapist shall file a report with the ODC every six months documenting\r\n  Respondentâ€™s progress. Â In\r\n  the event the reports required by this order are not filed or Respondent fails\r\n  to make satisfactory progress with his counseling, the ODC shall immediately notify this\r\n  Court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAfter a thorough\r\n  review of the record, we agree with the ODC that a harsher sanction than a 180-day\r\n  suspension is warranted.Â  Because we are not bound by the Panelâ€™s\r\n  recommendation but rather administer the sanction we deem appropriate, we impose\r\n  a suspension from the practice of law of nine months.Â  In the Matter of Thompson,\r\n  343 S.C. at 11, 539 S.E.2d at 401.Â  Within ninety (90) days of the filing of\r\n  this opinion, Respondent shall also pay the costs of this proceeding in the\r\n  amount of $1,124.29, and reimburse the Law Firm in the amount of $669.20 if he\r\n  has not already provided the ODC proof that the Law Firm received his certified\r\n  check.Â  Additionally, Respondent shall continue the counseling that he is\r\n  currently receiving for a period of one year beginning from the date of this opinion.Â \r\n  During this time, Respondentâ€™s therapist shall file a report every six months with\r\n  the ODC documenting Respondentâ€™s progress.Â  Finally, as a condition of seeking\r\n  reinstatement under Rule 33, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, Respondent must appear\r\n  before the Committee on Character and Fitness for the purpose of determining\r\n  whether he has the requisite character and fitness to resume the practice of\r\n  law in this state.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the filing of this opinion,\r\n  Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has\r\n  complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Because we have sanctioned Respondent to a definite\r\n  suspension of nine months, we note that pursuant to Rule 33, RLDE, Respondent\r\n  is required to appear before the Committee on Character and Fitness prior to\r\n  his reinstatement.Â  See Rule 33(g), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (â€œWithin 180 days of the matter being\r\n  referred to the Committee on Character and Fitness, the Committee shall conduct\r\n  a hearing. If the petition for reinstatement is withdrawn after the start of\r\n  the hearing, the lawyer must wait two years from the date the petition is\r\n  withdrawn to reapply for reinstatement.Â  At the hearing before the Committee,\r\n  the lawyer shall have the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence that the lawyer has met each of the criteria in paragraph (f).â€). \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26603","title":"State v.

Zelenka, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Harold\r\n  W.

Â Brown admitted\r\n  he was taken to the hospital by police after a car chase, but he specifically denied\r\n  having a conversation at the hospital with Detective John Parris.Â  \r\nBrown escaped from police custody while in the hospital.[5] Â He was later captured in Florida and extradited to South Carolina.Â  On January 2, 2004, while housed in the Lexington County jail, Brown gave Detective Parris a written statement.Â  While on the\r\n  stand, the State presented this three-page statement to Brown for his review;\r\n  Brown, however, denied making this statement as well.[6]Â  \r\nAlthough defense counsel cross-examined Brown about his prior criminal\r\n  record, he did not ask Brown any questions about his alleged statements to\r\n  police.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State subsequently called Detective Parris to the stand and offered Brownâ€™s\r\n  written statement under Rule 613(b), SCRE, as extrinsic evidence of a prior\r\n  inconsistent statement.Â  \r\nAppellant objected. Â During\r\n  the discussion on appellantâ€™s objection - out of the presence of the jury - the\r\n  trial court noted that Brown had been on the stand and available for\r\n  cross-examination.Â  Moreover, the trial court specifically offered defense\r\n  counsel the opportunity to recall Brown for further cross-examination or as a\r\n  witness in the defense case.Â  Counsel rejected the trial courtâ€™s offer,\r\n  contending that this would force appellant to ask about the substance of the\r\n  statement prior to the State bringing up the details of the statement.Â  Counsel\r\n  further argued that if he questioned Brown and he continued to deny making the\r\n  statement, appellant would be denied â€œeffective cross-examination.â€Â  When the\r\n  trial court again offered to produce Brown because he was still under subpoena,\r\n  counsel declined, stating that Brown was â€œa loose cannon,â€ and therefore\r\n  counsel had â€œno idea what he will say once he takes that stand.â€Â  \r\nThe trial court allowed the statement to be admitted as evidence\r\n  and published to the jury.Â  Essentially, Brown relayed to Detective Parris that\r\n  on November 26, 2003, appellant told Brown that he (i.e., appellant) was\r\n  involved in the October 6, 2003, shooting. \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  statement reads as follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\tOn 11/26/03 I was at the BP station.Â  I pick up [appellant] and\r\n  Tony, they got into the car and once they was in, [appellant] &amp; Tony that\r\n  is Tony ask Sam you do have everything right, and [appellant] said nigger\r\n  everything is in the bookpack.Â  Tony out the bookpack and pull out a black gun,\r\n  and was playing with it, as he was checking it out.Â  At this time [appellant]\r\n  stated yes thatâ€™s that nigger shit, he almost had me, but my nigger Tony took\r\n  his ass out, shot his ass right in the fucking head.Â  At this time I am\r\n  wondering what are they talking about, and [appellant] say that dud[e] on\r\n  [street], and I remember reading about it in the newspaper, and people was\r\n  talking about it.Â  At this time I said to them both I know you all didnâ€™t.Â  At\r\n  this time I just went into a panic state.Â  \r\n\tI remember reading about [it] in the newspaper in Oct. 2003. On\r\n  the I saw them, I saw a black auto[matic] handgun and it cam[e] from the\r\n  killing of the guy they killed.Â  [Appellant] told me that the gun came from the\r\n  killing of Nicklos, the nigger that they kill with the .357 gun.Â  [Appellant]\r\n  said that he almost kill him if Tony had not shot him with the .357 gun.â€¦\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony from Detective Parris\r\n  which explained that while Brown was in the hospital on November 26, 2003, he\r\n  volunteered information that the black gun used (by Brown) in the robbery\r\n  committed that same day was taken from the Briarcliff Road residence on October\r\n  6, 2003, and that appellant was the person involved in the murder there.Â  In other\r\n  words, Brown told Detective Parris that appellant was responsible for the\r\n  murder, and that he (i.e., Brown) was not connected to that crime.Â  \r\nOther Bad\r\n  Acts Evidence\r\nIn\r\n  addition to the evidence regarding the crimes committed on October 6, 2003, the\r\n  following evidence associated with an October 18, 2003, shooting was also\r\n  admitted at trial, over appellantâ€™s objection.Â  The victim of this shooting,\r\n  Chi Yeung, was shot in the leg.Â  Yeung did not testify at trial, but several\r\n  other witnesses connected appellant to the shooting.Â  \r\nFirst, Christina Phouachinth[7] testified that appellant left her home with Yeung, Jorge Enrique Sihavong\r\n  (â€œKâ€), and Tony Nguyen.[8]Â \r\n  K testified that he was driving a green Honda with appellant, Yeung, and Nguyen\r\n  as passengers.Â  Appellant directed him to an apartment house; when they\r\n  arrived, appellant and Yeung exited the car and went into an apartment.Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, K was let in to the apartment by another man and saw Yeung\r\n  looking â€œscared.â€Â  K heard someone say â€œDonâ€™t move,â€ and he ran out of the\r\n  apartment.Â  K testified that he heard gunshots; when he reached the car, he\r\n  told Nguyen to run, and K continued running away.Â  After a few shots, K turned\r\n  around and saw appellant pointing â€œa big chrome shiny gunâ€ at him.Â  K later identified\r\n  appellant to police as the person who shot at him.\r\nIn\r\n  addition, Nguyen testified that he heard gunshots shortly after appellant, Yeung, and K went inside the apartment.Â  He then saw K running out the door and\r\n  heard K tell him to run for his life.Â  Thereafter, Nguyen saw appellant\r\n  pointing a pistol at K.Â  Nguyen ran and hid in the woods, but later identified\r\n  appellant to police.\r\nAs\r\n  police responded to a report of gunshots fired, they were flagged down by Yeung\r\n  who was driving the green Honda. Â Yeungâ€™s upper right leg was bleeding, and he\r\n  was sent to the hospital.Â  Just prior to Yeungâ€™s release from the hospital, a\r\n  police officer was obtaining a statement from him.Â  When Yeung got off the\r\n  gurney he had been laying on, the officer found a bullet lying on the bloody\r\n  sheets.Â  This bullet was later matched to the .357 retrieved from the car\r\n  appellant was filling up when police apprehended him in North Carolina.\r\nWhen police searched the apartment that Yeung had been in, they found\r\n  three prescription medicine bottles in appellantâ€™s name.Â  The medicine bottles\r\n  listed appellantâ€™s address as one that was different from the apartment in\r\n  which they were found.\r\nAt the\r\n  conclusion of testimony, the trial court instructed the jury on the â€œhand of\r\n  one, hand of allâ€ theory.Â  The trial court refused appellantâ€™s request to instruct\r\n  the jury that Brownâ€™s statement could be used only for impeachment.Â  \r\nThe jury found appellant guilty of all charges.Â  The trial court\r\n  sentenced appellant to life for murder, life for burglary, and ten years for\r\n  assault with intent to kill.Â  The sentences were to run concurrent to each\r\n  other, but consecutive to the sentences appellant was already serving.[9]\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tWas appellantâ€™s right to confrontation violated by \r\n\t\t\tthe admission of Brownâ€™s prior inconsistent statement?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err by admitting evidence of \r\n\t\t\tthe October 18, 2003, shooting pursuant to Rule 404(b), SCRE?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\n  be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  E.g., State v. Pagan,\r\n  369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265&nbsp;(2006). An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support\r\n  or are controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.\r\n1.Â  Confrontation\r\n  Clause\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues his right to confrontation was violated when the trial court admitted\r\n  Brownâ€™s written statement pursuant to Rule 613, SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder\r\n  the rules of evidence, a prior inconsistent statement may be admitted when the\r\n  proper foundation has been laid:\r\n\r\n\tExtrinsic\r\n  evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible\r\n  unless the witness is advised of the substance of the statement, the time and\r\n  place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made, and is given\r\n  the opportunity to explain or deny the statement.Â  If a witness does not admit\r\n  that he has made the prior inconsistent statement, extrinsic evidence of such\r\n  statement is admissible.Â  \r\n\r\nRule 613(b), SCRE.Â  A prior\r\n  inconsistent statement may be admitted as substantive evidence when the\r\n  declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.Â  State v.\r\n    Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 300 S.E.2d 63 (1982).\r\nThe\r\n  Confrontation Clause guarantees that â€œ[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused\r\n  shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.â€Â \r\n  U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  This right to confront and cross-examine witnesses â€œis\r\n  essential to a fair trial in that it promotes reliability in criminal trials\r\n  and insures that convictions will not result from testimony of individuals who\r\n  cannot be challenged at trial.â€Â  State v. Martin,&nbsp;292 S.C. 437,\r\n  439, 357 S.E.2d 21, 22&nbsp;(1987).\r\nBecause\r\n  Brown denied the written statement while on the stand, appellant maintains he\r\n  was denied effective cross-examination of Brown, and therefore, the\r\n  admission of the written statement violated his right to confrontation.Â \r\n  Appellant cites two of this Courtâ€™s cases to support his argument:Â  State v.\r\n    Pfirman, 300 S.C. 84, 386 S.E.2d 461 (1989); and Simpkins v. State,\r\n  303 S.C. 364, 401 S.E. 2d 142 (1991).Â  The State argues that Pfirman and Simpkins are no longer good law in light of the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s\r\n  (USSC) decision in Crawford v. Washington,\r\n  541 U.S. 36 (2004).[10]Â  \r\nIn Pfirman,\r\n  the defendant appealed from an armed robbery conviction.Â  When he was arrested,\r\n  the defendant told police that his cousin, Oliver Goff, had committed the\r\n  robbery.Â  Goff, who was also arrested, implicated the defendant as the robber,\r\n  and said he (Goff) had been the lookout.Â \r\n    The State called Goff at trial, but Goff testified he did not remember giving a\r\n    statement to police.Â  Over appellantâ€™s objection, the State was allowed to\r\n    introduce Goffâ€™s statement into evidence through the testimony of the police\r\n    officer who had questioned Goff upon his arrest.\r\nThis\r\n  Court found the trial court had erred in admitting the statement as substantive\r\n  evidence.[11]Â \r\n  Although recognizing that â€œa prior inconsistent statement may be used as\r\n  substantive evidence when the declarant testifies at trial and is\r\n  subject to cross-examination,â€ the Pfirman Court nevertheless held that\r\n  when â€œthe declarant refuses to admit the statement imputed to him, the accused\r\n  is denied effective cross-examination in violation of his confrontation\r\n  rights.â€Â  Pfirman, 300 S.C. at 85-86, 386 S.E.2d at 462 (citing Douglas\r\n    v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415 (1965)) (emphasis added).\r\nIn Simpkins,\r\n  the Court cited Pfirman as support for the petitionerâ€™s ineffective\r\n  assistance of appellate counsel claim.Â  The petitioner in Simpkins had\r\n  been convicted of first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor, where the\r\n  victim was his eight-year-old daughter.Â  When called to the stand at trial,\r\n  â€œ[t]he child gave no response or responded negatively to the Solicitorâ€™s\r\n  repeated questions regarding a sexual assault by petitioner.â€Â  Simpkins,\r\n  303 S.C. at 366, 401 S.E.2d at 142.Â  Defense counsel attempted\r\n  cross-examination, but â€œreceived no response to questions regarding a sexual\r\n  assault by petitioner.â€Â  Id.Â  The State then put the guardian ad litem (GAL) on the stand who testified that\r\n  the child had identified the petitioner as her abuser.Â  On appeal, counsel did\r\n  not argue that the GALâ€™s hearsay testimony was improperly admitted.\r\nThe Simpkins Court found admission of the GALâ€™s testimony had been erroneous and\r\n  explained as follows:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  mere fact the declarant (the victim) testified in this case does not cure the\r\n  error in admitting [the GALâ€™s] hearsay testimony.Â  The victim refused to accuse\r\n  petitioner and in effect declined to admit the out-of-court statement\r\n  attributed to her by [the GAL].Â  Petitioner was denied effective cross-examination of the victim regarding this\r\n  crucial evidence supplied by [the GAL].Â  Cf. State v. Pfirman, 300 S.C. 84, 386 S.E.2d 461 (1989). \r\n\t\r\n\r\nSimpkins, 303 S.C. at 368, 401 S.E.2d at 143-44 (citation\r\n  omitted, emphasis added).\r\nAppellant therefore argues that pursuant to Pfirman and Simpkins, when a declarant refuses\r\n  to admit the statement imputed to him, the accused is denied effective\r\n  cross-examination in violation of his confrontation rights.Â  We agree with the\r\n  State, however, that the USSCâ€™s subsequent decision in Crawford sheds a\r\n  new light on this Confrontation Clause issue.\r\nIn Crawford,\r\n  the USSC held that the admission of testimonial hearsay statements against an\r\n  accused violates the Confrontation Clause if:Â  (1) the declarant is unavailable\r\n  to testify at trial, and (2) the accused has had no prior opportunity to\r\n  cross-examine the declarant. Â Id. at 54.Â \r\n  Statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are\r\n  considered testimonial.Â  Id. at 52-53.Â  The USSC noted, however, â€œthat\r\n  when the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation\r\n  Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial\r\n  statements.â€ Â Id. at 59 n.9 (emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  Confrontation Clause â€œdoes not bar admission of a statement so long as the\r\n  declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn our opinion, Crawford clearly establishes there is no Confrontation Clause violation in the instant\r\n  case because Brown was available at trial and subject to cross-examination.Â \r\n  The trial court even offered to allow Brown to be recalled to the stand in\r\n  light of its decision to admit the statement under Rule 613(b), SCRE.Â  Appellant\r\n  maintains the trial courtâ€™s offer improperly shifted the burden of addressing\r\n  the substance of the prior statement away from the State. Â He also contends it\r\n  would have been ineffective for trial counsel to introduce the substance of the\r\n  statement through cross-examination.Â  Appellant, however, misses the point of\r\n  what is constitutionally guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause.\r\nThe USSC explained\r\n  the â€œpurposes of confrontationâ€ in California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149\r\n  (1970).Â  Confrontation:\r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  insures that the witness will give his statements under oath - thus impressing\r\n  him with the seriousness of the matter and guarding against the lie by the\r\n  possibility of a penalty for perjury; \r\n\t(2) forces the witness to submit to\r\n  cross-examination, the â€˜greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery\r\n  of truthâ€™; [and] \r\n\t(3)\r\n  permits the jury that is to decide the defendantâ€™s fate to observe the demeanor\r\n  of the witness in making his statement, thus aiding the jury in assessing his\r\n  credibility.\r\n\r\nId. at 158 (footnote omitted).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  as to cross-examination specifically, the Confrontation Clause â€œguarantees only\r\n  an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination\r\n  that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might\r\n  wish.â€Â  United States v. Owens, 484 U.S. 554, 559 (1988) (internal\r\n  quotation marks and citations omitted; emphasis in original).Â  Indeed, the\r\n  opponentâ€™s opportunity for cross-examination has been deemed the â€œmain and\r\n  essential purpose of confrontation.â€Â  Delaware v. Fensterer,&nbsp;474 U.S. 15, 19-20 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U.S. 730, 739 (1987) (describing the Confrontation\r\n  Clauseâ€™s â€œfunctional purposeâ€ as â€œensuring a defendant an opportunity for\r\n  cross-examinationâ€).Â  \r\n\r\n\tCross-examination\r\n  allows the accused the opportunity:\r\n\t[N]ot\r\n  only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but\r\n  of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may\r\n  look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which\r\n  he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.\r\n\r\nDouglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 419 (1965); (quoting Mattox v.\r\n  United States, 156 U.S. 237, 242 (1895))\r\nThus,\r\n  it is the opportunity to cross-examine that is constitutionally\r\n  protected.Â  In the instant case, appellant had that opportunity.Â  It is\r\n  undisputed Brown appeared at trial, was available for cross-examination, and\r\n  could have been recalled after the statement was admitted.[12]Â  \r\nInstead,\r\n  appellantâ€™s trial counsel chose not to cross-examine on this subject.Â  Although\r\n  trial counsel apparently decided that such cross-examination would be to\r\n  appellantâ€™s detriment, this does not amount to a violation of appellantâ€™s right\r\n  to confrontation.Â  See Crawford, supra (Confrontation\r\n  Clause implicated only when declarant is unavailable); California v. Green,\r\n  399 U.S. at 161 (â€œnone of our decisions interpreting the Confrontation Clause\r\n  requires excluding the out-of-court statements of a witness who is available\r\n  and testifying at trialâ€); United States v. Owens, 484 U.S. at 559 (the\r\n  Confrontation Clause guarantees the opportunity for effective\r\n  cross-examination, but â€œnot cross-examination that is effective in whatever\r\n  way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wishâ€).[13]\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the trial court did not err by admitting Brownâ€™s written statement.Â \r\n  Clearly, the State laid the proper foundation for the admission of the\r\n  extrinsic evidence of the written statement.Â  See Rule 613(b), SCRE.Â \r\n  The State advised Brown of the substance of the statement by showing him the\r\n  three-page statement while on the stand; Brown was also advised of the time and\r\n  place the statement was allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made.Â  Id.Â  Brown was given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement, and he chose\r\n  to deny making the statement.Â  Id.Â  Thus, the statement was admissible\r\n  under Rule 613(b), SCRE, and no Confrontation Clause violation resulted from\r\n  this admission.\r\nFinally, to the extent Pfirman and Simpkins hold\r\n  that where a declarant refuses to admit\r\n  the statement imputed to him, the accused is denied effective cross-examination\r\n  in violation of his confrontation rights, we overrule these two cases.Â  See Crawford, supra. \r\n2.Â \r\n  Evidence of Other Crimes\r\nAppellant\r\n  also argues that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of the October\r\n  18, 2003, shooting to prove identity.Â  Appellant contends the evidence was not\r\n  clear and convincing and does not logically connect to the charges in the\r\n  instant case.Â  He also argues the evidence was more prejudicial than probative.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nEvidence\r\n  of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a\r\n  person in order to show action in conformity therewith; however, such evidence\r\n  may be admissible â€œto show motive, identity, the existence of a common\r\n  scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.â€Â  Rule 404(b),\r\n  SCRE (emphasis added).Â  The evidence admitted â€œmust\r\n  logically relate to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682-83 (2000).Â  \r\nWhere\r\n  the defendant was not convicted of the prior crime, evidence of the bad act\r\n  must be clear and convincing.[14]Â  Id.Â  Nonetheless, even if bad act evidence\r\n  is clear and convincing and falls within the Rule 404(b) exception, it must be\r\n  excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE (although relevant, evidence may\r\n  be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n  unfair prejudice).Â  â€œUnfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest\r\n  decision on an improper basis.â€Â  State v. Dickerson,&nbsp;341 S.C. 391,\r\n  400, 535 S.E.2d 119, 123&nbsp;(2000).Â  Finally, the\r\n  determination of prejudice must be based on the entire record, and the result\r\n  will generally turn on the facts of each case.Â  State v. Gillian, 373\r\n  S.C. 601, 646 S.E.2d 872 (2007); State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 30, 393\r\n  S.E.2d 364, 371 (1990).\r\nHere, the evidence of other crimes stemmed from the subsequent shooting\r\n  incident which occurred on October 18, 2003.Â  The testimony from Christina, K,\r\n  and Nguyen established that appellant was together with K, Nguyen, and Yeung on\r\n  the night in question.Â  The testimony of K and Nguyen demonstrated that\r\n  appellant was shooting at K.Â  Yeung, who did not testify at trial, was\r\n  discovered by police with a bullet wound in his leg, and the bullet found on\r\n  Yeungâ€™s hospital gurney matched the gun found in the car appellant was fueling\r\n  when he was apprehended in North Carolina in December 2003.Â  Finally, medicine\r\n  bottles belonging to appellant were found in the apartment Yeung entered.\r\nReviewing all this evidence, we find the State clearly linked the\r\n  gun that was used in the October 18, 2003, shooting to appellant.Â  The forensic\r\n  evidence positively showed that this same gun was used in the October 6,\r\n  2003, break-in because the bullet that fell from the curtain in the bedroom\r\n  where Nicholas was shot also matched the gun.Â  Since the victims in the instant\r\n  case were unable to identify their attackers, this connection was highly\r\n  probative on the issue of the identity of at least one of the intruders from\r\n  the October 6, 2003, incident.Â  Thus, the evidence from the subsequent shooting\r\n  was logically related to the instant case. Â See State v. Beck, supra.\r\nIn other words, the positive identification of appellant by K and\r\n  Nguyen, and the forensic evidence linking the bullet from Yeungâ€™s leg to the\r\n  gun found with appellant in December 2003, connect appellant to the crimes of\r\n  the instant case because the same weapon\r\n  was used in both crimes.Â  See State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526,\r\n  547, 552 S.E.2d 300, 311&nbsp;(2001) (â€œThe fact that the same weapon was used\r\n  in both the barbershop and cab driver murders goes to show appellantâ€™s identity\r\n  as the barbershop killer.â€).\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends that because Yeung did not testify at trial, and therefore appellant\r\n  was not specifically identified as the person who shot Yeung, the evidence\r\n  failed to meet the clear and convincing standard.Â  While the evidence did not\r\n  necessarily conclusively establish appellant was the trigger man, it nevertheless\r\n  did serve to connect appellant to the gun.Â  Because the gun was used in both\r\n  the October 6 and October 18 shootings, and this same gun was found with\r\n  appellant when police apprehended him, the relevant connection regarding\r\n  identity was effectively made.Â  Id.\r\nAppellant\r\n  further contends the prejudicial value of the evidence outweighed its probative\r\n  value because it showed appellant â€œmight be a violent person who may possess a\r\n  gun.â€Â  In our opinion, however, the evidence was not offered to show\r\n  appellantâ€™s bad character, but rather was introduced to connect appellant to\r\n  the weapon that was used on October 6, 2003, to kill Nicholas.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  although this evidence certainly was prejudicial to appellant, we find it was\r\n  not â€œundulyâ€ prejudicial.Â  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. at 137, 536 S.E.2d at\r\n  683; see also State v. Dickerson,&nbsp;341 S.C. at 400,\r\n  535 S.E.2d at 123&nbsp;(â€œUnfair prejudice\r\n  means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis.â€).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the trial court did not err by allowing this evidence at trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we affirm\r\n  appellantâ€™s convictions.Â  The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of\r\n  appellantâ€™s prior bad acts because they were probative on the issue of\r\n  identity.Â  Additionally, the trial court correctly found that the admission of\r\n  Brownâ€™s prior inconsistent statement did not violate appellantâ€™s right to\r\n  confront his witnesses.Â  Accordingly, we affirm.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The pathologist testified at trial that Nicholas died\r\n  from a single â€œin and outâ€ gunshot wound to the head.\r\n[2] A trial the previous year resulted in a mistrial due\r\n  to a hung jury.\r\n[3] Catrina and Nicholas had been a couple for 13 years\r\n  and had a son together.\r\n[4] At least one person had a red bandana tied around his\r\n  face.Â  \r\n[5] On the stand, Brown denied he had escaped, but\r\n  instead maintained he was â€œmistakenly released.â€Â  Detective Parris later testified\r\n  that Brown escaped from custody, while handcuffed, by crawling through the\r\n  ceiling of a hospital restroom.\r\n[6] The written statement reflects that Brownâ€™s attorney was present and signed the statement as a\r\n  witness.\r\n[7] Christina is the mother of appellantâ€™s child, and\r\n  appellant had been visiting the child on October 18, 2003.\r\n[8] Tony Nguyen is not the same Tony referenced in\r\n  Brownâ€™s statement.\r\n[9] Based on the events of October 18, 2003, appellant\r\n  entered an Alford plea to three counts of assault of a high and\r\n  aggravated nature.\r\n[10] We granted the Stateâ€™s motion to argue against the\r\n  precedent of these two cases.\r\n[11] This 1989 case was decided prior to the rules of\r\n  evidence being adopted, and therefore, a Rule 613, SCRE, analysis was not\r\n  conducted.Â  \r\n[12] We note Brown was not restricted in any way from\r\n  testifying, for example, by claiming protection of the Fifth Amendment.Â  Cf. Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 419\r\n  (1965) (where a co-defendant invoked his Fifth Amendment\r\n  privilege but the substance of his confession was nevertheless effectively\r\n  admitted, the USSC held that the petitionerâ€™s inability to cross-examine the\r\n  co-defendant about the alleged confession â€œplainly denied him the right of\r\n  cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clauseâ€).\r\n[13] Furthermore, other state courts faced with this issue\r\n  have also concluded there is no Confrontation Clause violation where the\r\n  witness is present at trial.Â  See, e.g., Johnson v. State,&nbsp;878\r\n  A.2d 422, 429&nbsp;(Del. 2005) (â€œThe mere fact that [the witnessâ€™s]\r\n  recollection was limited does not make her unavailable for cross-examination\r\n  for Confrontation Clause purposes.â€); People v. Sharp, 825 N.E.2d 706,\r\n  713&nbsp;(Ill. Ct. App. 2005) (where child victim â€œwas present for\r\n  cross-examination and answered defense counselâ€™s questions, the confrontation\r\n  clause places absolutely no constraints on the use of [her] prior statementsâ€); State v. Holliday, 745 N.W.2d 556, 568&nbsp;(Minn. 2008) (â€œThe\r\n  Confrontation Clause is satisfied by a declarantâ€™s appearance at trial for\r\n  cross-examination, and it is for the factfinder to evaluate a declarantâ€™s\r\n  credibility.â€); State v. Price, 146 P.3d 1183, 1192&nbsp;(Wash. 2006)\r\n  (â€œwhen a witness is asked questions about the events at issue and about his or\r\n  her prior statements, but answers that he or she is unable to remember the\r\n  charged events or the prior statements, this provides the defendant sufficient\r\n  opportunity for cross-examination to satisfy the confrontation clauseâ€); State\r\n    v. Nelis, 733 N.W.2d 619, 628&nbsp;(Wis. 2007) (where Chief of Police\r\n  testified about prior inconsistent statements of another witness who had\r\n  already testified, the court held there was no Confrontation Clause violation\r\n  because witness had testified at trial and it had not been shown that witness\r\n  was unable to be recalled to the stand).\r\n[14] â€œClear and convincingâ€ evidence is an intermediate\r\n  degree of proof â€œwhich will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm\r\n  belief as to the allegations sought to be established.â€Â  Anonymous v.

Bentz Kirby, both of Orangeburg, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tPhillip\r\n  Martin, of Marion, pro se Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Â In\r\n  this case, Appellant Ronnie Judy filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to\r\n  declare an underlying magistrateâ€™s judgment void ab initio for lack of\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The master-in-equity found in favor of Respondent\r\n  Phillip Martin.Â  On appeal, Appellant claims that the magistrate lacked\r\n  jurisdiction to render the underlying judgment, and that the master erred by\r\n  assuming facts not in evidence, finding that Appellant was required to request\r\n  removal to the court of common pleas, and finding that Respondent would suffer\r\n  prejudice if the magistrateâ€™s judgment was vacated.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn\r\n  May 8, 2000, Respondent filed suit in magistrateâ€™s court against Appellant,\r\n  seeking $2,500 in damages.Â  Appellant filed an Answer and Counterclaim in the\r\n  amount of $6,500.Â  At the time, the jurisdictional limit in magistrateâ€™s court\r\n  was $5,000.[1]Â \r\n  The magistrate issued a trial notice for September 28, 2000.Â  Appellant claims\r\n  he spoke with the magistrate on September 25, 2000, and that the magistrate\r\n  told him the case was out of his jurisdiction and would be transferred to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  Appellant failed to appear at trial and the case was tried in\r\n  his absence.Â  The magistrate rendered a verdict for Respondent in the amount of\r\n  $2,555.Â  Appellant appealed to the circuit court on November 6, 2000.Â  The magistrateâ€™s\r\n  return acknowledged the conversation with Appellant, but indicates that the\r\n  magistrate told Appellant only that a claim for over $5,000 would be out of his\r\n  jurisdiction but said nothing about transferring the case to circuit court.Â \r\n  The circuit court affirmed the magistrateâ€™s judgment.Â  Appellant did not seek\r\n  reconsideration from the circuit court or file an appeal.Â  \r\nShortly\r\n  after the final judgment, the sheriff issued an execution, which was returned nulla\r\n    bona.Â  In 2004, the probate court issued an order placing certain real\r\n  property in Appellantâ€™s name, and Respondent had a Notice of Levy issued on the\r\n  property.Â  Appellant thereby filed this action for declaratory judgment with the\r\n  master, who determined that Appellant was not entitled to relief on the grounds\r\n  that Appellant: (1) failed to seek removal of the case from magistrateâ€™s court;\r\n  (2) failed to appear in court to press his case for removal; (3) relied upon a\r\n  verbal ex parte request by telephone for confirmation that the case would be\r\n  transferred to circuit court; (4) failed to file a motion for reconsideration\r\n  of the circuit courtâ€™s decision to uphold the magistrateâ€™s judgment; (5) failed\r\n  to appeal to the court of appeals; and (6) abandoned his defense of lack of\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction until nearly four years later.Â  Appellant appealed\r\n  the masterâ€™s order, and this Court certified the case pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\n  SCACR.Â  Appellant presents the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in failing to \r\n\t\t\taddress the issue of subject matter jurisdiction and whether the \r\n\t\t\tjudgment was void ab\r\n  initio?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err by assuming facts not in \r\n\t\t\tevidence and upholding the magistrateâ€™s order based upon what he \r\n\t\t\tassumed the trial judge would have ruled?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err by ruling that Appellant \r\n\t\t\thad to take an affirmative act to attempt to remove his case to \r\n\t\t\tCircuit Court?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court commit error by ruling the \r\n\t\t\tRespondent would face prejudice relating to having to make \r\n\t\t\tcomplicated legal arguments, and ignoring the proper relief and the \r\n\t\t\trelief sought by the Appellant?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nDeclaratory\r\n  judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable and, therefore, the standard\r\n  of review depends on the nature of the underlying issues.Â  Doe v. South Carolina Medical Malpractice\r\n    Liability Joint Underwriting, 347 S.C. 642, 645, 557 S.E.2d 670, 672 (2001).Â  An action for declaratory judgment that a\r\n  magistrateâ€™s judgment is void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is an\r\n  action at law.Â  Therefore, the masterâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed\r\n  on appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports them.Â  Harkins\r\n    v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 621, 533 S.E.2d 886, 893 (2000).Â Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nIn\r\n  the first question presented for our review, Appellant alleges that the master-in-equity\r\n  erred in refusing to declare the magistrateâ€™s judgment void ab initio for lack\r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We disagree, and hold that Appellant may not\r\n  seek relief from the prior unappealed order of the circuit court because the\r\n  order has become the law of the case.\r\nUnder the law-of-the-case doctrine, a party is precluded from\r\n  relitigating, after an appeal, matters that were either not raised on appeal,\r\n  but should have been, or raised on appeal, but expressly rejected by the\r\n  appellate court.

Perry et al, 261 S.C. 538, 201 S.E.2d 245 (1973) (holding that\r\n  where a ruling on a demurrer to complaint is not appealed from, it becomes the law\r\n  of the case); Watkins v. Hodge, 232 S.C. 245, __, 101 S.E.2d 657, 658 (1958)\r\n  (refusing to consider jurisdictional matter of underlying case where issue had\r\n  been ruled upon and not challenged on appeal).\r\nIn this declaratory judgment action, Appellant seeks to reopen the\r\n  question of whether the magistrate had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the\r\n  merits of the underlying dispute.Â  However, Appellant raised this issue and\r\n  argued it before the circuit court on appeal from the magistrateâ€™s judgment.Â  The\r\n  circuit court denied Appellantâ€™s appeal and affirmed the magistrateâ€™s\r\n  judgment.Â  Appellant did not file a motion for reconsideration, an appeal with\r\n  the court of appeals, or a motion to set aside the judgment.Â  The circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s unchallenged disposition on the magistrateâ€™s subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction therefore became the law of the case, and this Court declines to\r\n  reopen that issue in this subsequent action.

McDowell, 372\r\n  S.C. 413, 642 S.E.2d 632 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  In Hardee, the South Carolina Court of Appeals upheld the finding of the South Carolina Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Commission that a general contractor and its insurer, Smith\r\n  Construction Co. and Companion Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Co., could not\r\n  transfer liability for a workerâ€™s injury to the South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™\r\n  Fund under section 42-1-415 of the South Carolina Code.[1]Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals determined Smith Construction did not obtain proof of\r\n  insurance from its subcontractor at the time the subcontractor was engaged to\r\n  perform work as required by section 42-1-415.Â  We granted the petition of Smith\r\n  Construction and its insurer for certiorari and affirm as modified.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nSmith Construction,\r\n  a general contractor, hired W. D. McDowell as a subcontractor to perform\r\n  framing and other work for its construction projects on several occasions.Â \r\n  Because McDowell could not afford workersâ€™ compensation insurance for its\r\n  employees, Smith Construction routinely paid the premium and then took weekly\r\n  deductions from McDowellâ€™s pay for reimbursement.Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  March 11, 2002, McDowell presented Smith Construction with a certificate of\r\n  insurance indicating McDowell had coverage from January 30, 2002 to January 30,\r\n  2003.Â  During the year, McDowell worked on various jobs for Smith\r\n  Construction.Â  Smith Construction, relying upon the earlier certificate, did\r\n  not seek proof of insurance for any of these jobs.Â  \r\nIn the summer of\r\n  2002, McDowell began working on the Socastee library project for Smith\r\n  Construction.Â  Smith Construction admittedly did not ask for proof of insurance\r\n  for this job and had no representation from McDowell as to proof of insurance\r\n  other than the earlier certificate that was in Smith Constructionâ€™s file.Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  September 6, 2002, Anthony Hardee, one of McDowellâ€™s employees, was totally and\r\n  permanently disabled when he fell from scaffolding while working on the Socastee\r\n  library project.Â  The day before the accident, McDowellâ€™s insurance was\r\n  cancelled.Â  Neither Smith Construction nor McDowell was aware of the\r\n  cancellation at the time of Hardeeâ€™s accident.[2]Â  \r\nHardee\r\n  filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  Smith Construction sought to transfer its\r\n  liability as a statutory employer to the Fund under section 42-1-415.Â  The workersâ€™\r\n  compensation hearing commissioner found Smith Construction, as the general\r\n  contractor, was liable for paying Hardeeâ€™s benefits and it was not allowed to\r\n  shift liability to the Fund under section 42-1-415 because Smith Construction\r\n  did not request or obtain proof of insurance from McDowell for the job in\r\n  question - the Socastee library project.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  full Commission upheld the findings of the hearing commissioner and adopted the\r\n  hearing commissionerâ€™s order in full.Â  The circuit court affirmed.Â  Upon\r\n  further appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Hardee v. McDowell, 372\r\n  S.C. 413, 642 S.E.2d 632 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Smith Construction (and its insurer)\r\n  petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted.[3] \r\nII.Â  ISSUES\r\nSmith Construction\r\n  contends the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the full Commissionâ€™s decision\r\n  that section 42-1-415 requires a contractor to obtain proof of insurance from a\r\n  subcontractor for each particular job for which the subcontractor is engaged to\r\n  perform work.Â  It argues the case of South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™\r\n    Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 602 S.E.2d 81 (Ct. App. 2004) mandates that\r\n  proof of insurance be obtained only at the time the subcontractor is first\r\n  engaged to work and not for each particular job.Â  In the alternative, Smith\r\n  Construction contends that, even if it obtained proof of insurance at the\r\n  outset of the Socastee library job, it still would not have learned of the\r\n  cancellation of McDowellâ€™s policy.Â  \r\n\r\nIII. Â LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nUnder the statutory\r\n  employment doctrine, a contractor may be held liable for work-related injuries\r\n  to employees hired by a subcontractor.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-410\r\n  (1985) (stating a â€œcontractor shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in\r\n  the work [of a subcontractor] any compensation under this Title which he would\r\n  have been liable to pay if that workman had been immediately employed by himâ€); Miller v. Lawrence Robinson Trucking, 333 S.C. 576, 580, 510 S.E.2d 431,\r\n  433 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œThe concept of statutory employment is designed to\r\n  protect the employee by assuring workersâ€™ compensation coverage by either the\r\n  subcontractor, the general contractor, or the owner if the work is part of the\r\n  ownerâ€™s business.â€).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Fund was â€œcreated [by the South Carolina Legislature] to ensure payment of\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation benefits to injured employees whose employers have failed\r\n  to acquire necessary coverage for employees . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§&nbsp;42-7-200(A)(1) (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nSection\r\n  42-1-415 provides that a contractor may shift liability to the Fund if the\r\n  contractor obtains adequate proof that the subcontractor had insurance coverage\r\n  at the time the subcontractor â€œwas engaged to perform workâ€:\r\n\r\n\t(A)Â  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon\r\n  the submission of documentation to the [C]ommission that a contractor or\r\n  subcontractor has represented himself to a higher tier subcontractor,\r\n  contractor, or project owner as having workersâ€™ compensation insurance at\r\n    the time the contractor or subcontractor was engaged to perform work, the\r\n  higher tier subcontractor, contractor, or project owner must be relieved of any\r\n  and all liability under this title except as specifically provided in this\r\n  section.Â  . . .Â  The higher tier subcontractor, contractor, project owner, or\r\n  his insurance carrier may petition the [C]ommission to transfer responsibility\r\n  for continuing compensation to the Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund. . . .\r\n\t(B)Â \r\n  To qualify for reimbursement under this section, the higher tier subcontractor,\r\n  contractor, or project owner must collect documentation of insurance as\r\n  provided in subsection (A) on a standard form acceptable to the [C]ommission.Â \r\n\tThe\r\n    documentation must be collected at the time the contractor or subcontractor is engaged\r\n    to perform work and must be turned over to the [C]ommission at the time a\r\n  claim is filed by the injured employee.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415(A)-(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).\r\nThe issue in this\r\n  case is at what point in time a contractor must obtain proof of insurance from\r\n  a subcontractor.Â  Section 42-1-415 provides that such proof must be obtained\r\n  when the subcontractor is â€œengaged to perform work.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the direct appeal of this case, the Court of Appeals first considered Smith\r\n  Constructionâ€™s argument that the Commission erred by requiring a contractor to\r\n  collect proof of insurance from its subcontractor for each job the\r\n  subcontractor performs.Â  Hardee, 372 S.C. at 417, 642 S.E.2d at 635.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals noted that â€œSmith Construction contends that a contractor\r\n  complies with section 42-1-415 by obtaining proof of insurance from its\r\n  subcontractor once a year.â€Â  Id. at 417-18, 642 S.E.2d at 635.\r\nSmith\r\n  Construction, relying on the case of South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™\r\n    Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 602 S.E.2d 81 (Ct. App. 2004), argued section\r\n  42-1-415 is satisfied if the contractor obtains proof of insurance the first\r\n  time it hires a subcontractor in any given year, regardless of the number of\r\n  jobs the subcontractor performs.Â  Id. at 418, 642 S.E.2d at 635.Â  In\r\n  contrast, Hardee argued that â€œa common sense reading of the statuteâ€ requires a\r\n  contractor to demand proof of insurance at the beginning of each new job rather\r\n  than once a year.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals held the House case was not controlling as the issue\r\n  presented in House was whether a contractor had a continuing duty\r\n  to collect proof of insurance throughout the term of the work where there is\r\n  one continuous job, as opposed to a series of separate jobs.Â  Id. at\r\n  418-19, 642 S.E.2d at 635.Â  The Court of Appeals stated the issue in the\r\n  present appeal, however, concerns what is meant by â€œengaged to perform workâ€ in\r\n  circumstances â€œwhere a contractor employs a subcontractor for a series of\r\n  separate jobs in a single year.â€Â  Id. at 419, 642 S.E.2d at 635.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTurning\r\n  to the language of the statute, the Court of Appeals found â€œthe plain language\r\n  [of section 42-1-415] contemplates the contractor require proof of insurance\r\n  for each job the subcontractor performs regardless of the number of jobs the\r\n  subcontractor performs in a given year.â€Â  Id. at 419, 642 S.E.2d at\r\n  635-36.Â  Noting the statute requires a contractor to collect proof of insurance\r\n  at the time the subcontractor is â€œengaged to perform work,â€ the court\r\n  concluded:Â  â€œWe find the phrase â€˜engaged to perform workâ€™ refers to when a\r\n  subcontractor begins work at a construction site.Â  The statute is plain and\r\n  unambiguous and, therefore, it is not our place to change the meaning of the\r\n  statute.â€Â  Id. at 419, 642 S.E.2d at 636.Â  The Court of Appeals held\r\n  that, because Smith Construction did not seek proof of insurance from its\r\n  subcontractor before it began the Socastee library project, that it was not\r\n  entitled to transfer liability for Hardeeâ€™s injury to the Fund.Â  Id. at 420, 642 S.E.2d at 636.\r\nUpon\r\n  certiorari to this Court, Smith Construction contends the Court of Appeals\r\n  erred in holding the phrase â€œengaged to perform workâ€ requires proof of\r\n  insurance for each job.Â  Smith Construction asserts such a view is â€œstrict and\r\n  narrowâ€ and â€œplaces a heavy burden on contractors and is inconsistent with the\r\n  legislative purpose of the statute.â€Â  Smith Construction argues section\r\n  42-1-415 â€œrequires the contractor to obtain proof of insurance at one point in\r\n  time:Â  at the first engagement of the subcontractor.Â  At most, section 42-1-415\r\n  requires a contractor to obtain proof of insurance on a yearly basis.â€Â  In\r\n  contrast, the Fund maintains that the phrase â€œengaged to perform workâ€\r\n  logically â€œrefers to each job upon which a subcontractor contracts with a\r\n  contractor for its performance.â€Â  \r\nBoth\r\n  sides cite the case of South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund v. House,\r\n  360 S.C. 468, 602 S.E.2d 81 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In House, a general\r\n  contractor verified that a subcontractor had insurance at the time the\r\n  subcontractor was hired.Â  Id. at 469, 602 S.E.2d at 81.Â  Later, one of\r\n  the subcontractorâ€™s employees was injured, but by that time the subcontractor\r\n  no longer had insurance coverage.Â  Id.Â  Prior to the injury, the\r\n  subcontractorâ€™s insurance had been terminated and reinstated several times\r\n  before it was finally cancelled.Â  Id. at 470, 602 S.E.2d at 81-82.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals in House agreed with the general contractor that\r\n  section 42-1-415 does not â€œrequire a higher-tier contractor to continue to\r\n  collect proof of insurance coverage from its subcontractor after originally\r\n    collecting documentation at the time of hire.â€Â  Id. at 471, 602\r\n  S.E.2d at 82 (emphasis added).Â  The court stated it was â€œloath to read such a\r\n  requirement into a statute that otherwise contains such straightforward\r\n  language.â€Â  Id. at 472, 602 S.E.2d at 83.Â  The court explained that the\r\n  use of the word â€œoriginallyâ€ in subsection (C) of section 42-1-415, which\r\n  provides it is fraud to fail to notify the contractor who â€œoriginallyâ€ was\r\n  provided documentation of coverage of a lapse in such coverage, â€œlends support\r\n  to the reasoning that the information given at the inception of the engagement\r\n  is the controlling factor . . . .â€Â  Id. (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-1-415(C)).Â  We denied certiorari in House.\r\nHouse stands for the proposition that a contractor does not\r\n  have a continuing duty to check the validity of the subcontractorâ€™s insurance\r\n  status after the subcontractor is â€œengaged to perform work.â€[4]Â  House, however, did not clearly define the meaning of the phrase\r\n  â€œengaged to perform work.â€Â  The Court of Appeals attempted to clarify the\r\n  phrase in its review in this case.Â  We find the phrase needs further\r\n  clarification.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\n  intent of the legislature.â€Â  Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp.,\r\n  344 S.C. 115, 122, 542 S.E.2d 736, 739 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œUnder the plain\r\n  meaning rule, it is not the courtâ€™s place to change the meaning of a clear and\r\n  unambiguous statute.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and\r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a definite meaning, the rules of statutory\r\n  construction are not needed and the court has no right to impose another\r\n  meaning.â€Â  Id. at 122, 542 S.E.2d at 739-40.Â  â€œWhat a legislature says\r\n  in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of legislative intent\r\n  or will.â€Â  Id. at 122, 542 S.E.2d at 740.Â  â€œTherefore, the courts are\r\n  bound to give effect to the expressed intent of the legislature.â€Â  Id.\r\nBased\r\n  on the express language of the statute, we hold the phrase â€œengaged to perform\r\n  workâ€ means each time a subcontractor is actually hired to perform\r\n  work.Â  Thus, if a contractor enters into a contract to hire a subcontractor for\r\n  one job in January and then enters into another contract to hire the\r\n  subcontractor for a second job in February, the contractor should verify that\r\n  the subcontractor still has insurance coverage at the time of the February\r\n  hiring.[5]Â \r\n  This interpretation comports with the usual understanding of â€œto engageâ€\r\n  someone for employment.Â  See Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 570 (8th ed.\r\n  2004) (defining â€œengageâ€ as â€œ[t]o employâ€); id. at 748 (defining â€œhireâ€\r\n  as â€œ[t]o engage the labor or services of another for wages or other paymentâ€); see\r\n    also 1 Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dictionary 420 (1974) (defining\r\n  â€œengageâ€ as â€œto bind by a promiseâ€ or â€œto hireâ€). \r\nIn\r\n  the current appeal, although Smith Construction checked for proof of insurance\r\n  from McDowell at one point in early 2002, it did not check for proof of\r\n  insurance at the time it actually hired McDowell for the Socastee library\r\n  project in the summer of 2002; rather, it relied upon the documentation it had\r\n  received earlier in the year.[6]Â \r\n  Because coverage can lapse, Smith Construction should have verified coverage at\r\n  the time McDowell was hired to do the Socastee library project in order to fall\r\n  under the protection of the statute.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Smith Construction argues it would violate public policy to not allow it to\r\n  transfer liability to the Fund, we discern no public policy violation that\r\n  would be created by requiring Smith Construction to comply with the express\r\n  terms of the statute.Â  It is up to the South Carolina Legislature to change the\r\n  statute if it intends a different interpretation; further, the legislature\r\n  could have expressly provided that contractors could verify coverage once per\r\n  year or some time period other than each time the subcontractor was engaged to\r\n  perform work.\r\nConsequently,\r\n  we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ determination that Smith Construction is not entitled\r\n  to transfer liability to the Fund because it did not seek proof of insurance\r\n  when McDowell was engaged to perform the work on the Socastee library project.Â \r\n  There is one sentence in the Hardee opinion, however, that states â€œengaged\r\n  to perform workâ€ refers to the time the subcontractor actually begins work on a\r\n  project.Â  Because this date may vary from the date of hire, we modify the opinion\r\n  to the extent it conflicts with the definition above. \r\nSmith\r\n  Construction finally argues that verifying insurance at the time the Socastee library\r\n  project began would not have mattered in this case because the subcontractorâ€™s\r\n  insurance was not cancelled until after the project started.Â  While it is true\r\n  that a check at that time would not have shown a lack of coverage, we agree\r\n  with the Fund that this argument ultimately fails on its merits.Â  If Smith\r\n  Construction had obtained a certificate of insurance from McDowell at the time\r\n  McDowell was hired for the project and then the coverage was terminated\r\n  unbeknownst to the parties, Smith Construction would have been entitled to\r\n  transfer liability to the Fund and the purpose of the statute would have been\r\n  served. \r\n\r\nIV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision\r\n  of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415 (Supp. 2008).\r\n[2]Â \r\n  Although Smith Construction provided funds for the insurance, the insurer\r\n  performed an audit of McDowell and apparently determined that additional funds\r\n  were due on the account and terminated coverage.Â  McDowell, however, disputed\r\n  that additional funds were due.Â  \r\n[3]Â \r\n  Smith Construction shall include its insurer as a petitioner where appropriate.\r\n[4]Â  House involved a contract to hire the subcontractor for several jobs;\r\n  thus, there was only one contract and one point of hire.\r\n[5]Â \r\n  To the extent that South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund v. House,\r\n  360 S.C. 468, 602 S.E.2d 81 (Ct. App. 2004) is inconsistent with our decision\r\n  today, it is not good law.\r\n[6] S. E. Smith, of Smith Construction, testified that he\r\n  hired McDowell from job to job, and that he did not request a certificate of\r\n  insurance for each job.Â  Rather, he asked for it earlier in the year and then\r\n  kept the certificate of insurance on file for the year.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"State v.

State, supra (letter denials in post-conviction relief cases).&nbsp; \r\nIn State v. Williams, 305 S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357\r\n  (1991), this Court set forth the process to be followed when counsel submits a\r\n  brief under Anders and petitions to be relieved as counsel.&nbsp; In these cases, the\r\n  role of the appellate court is to review the brief submitted by counsel, any pro\r\n    se response submitted by the appellant, and the record on appeal to\r\n  determine whether the appeal contains any issues of arguable merit.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; If an issue is found which has arguable merit, the appellate court will direct\r\n  the parties to file merit briefs, and the case will proceed under the normal\r\nappellate process.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; On the\r\n  other hand, if no issues of arguable merit are found by the appellate court,\r\nthe appeal is dismissed, and the appellant&rsquo;s counsel is relieved.&nbsp; Id.\r\n\r\nUnder this procedure, a\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals dismissing an appeal after conducting a review\r\n  pursuant to Anders is not a decision on the merits of the appeal, but\r\n  simply reflects that the appellate court was unable to ascertain a\r\n  non-frivolous issue which would require counsel to file a merits brief.&nbsp; A\r\n  decision of this nature does not meet the &ldquo;special and important&rdquo; standard\r\n  established by Rule 226(b) and this Court&rsquo;s decisions concerning petitions for\r\n  writs of certiorari to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Accordingly, we deny the petition\r\n  for a writ of certiorari in this matter.&nbsp; This Court will no longer entertain petitions for writs of\r\n  certiorari where the Court of Appeals has dismissed an appeal after conducting\r\nan Anders review. \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n     s/Jean H.
