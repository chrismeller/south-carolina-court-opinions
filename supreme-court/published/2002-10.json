(2) We affirm in part and reverse \r\nin part. \r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner Drew was employed by respondent Waffle House, \r\n  Inc. as a restaurant manager in Hardeeville, South Carolina. In March 1993, \r\n  she injured herself on the job while trying to secure a wind-blown sign in the \r\n  restaurant parking lot. As a result, she had shoulder surgery for which she \r\n  was authorized to take twelve weeks of leave from work. Although her supervisor \r\n  authorized an extension of her leave, petitioner was fired for absenteeism when \r\n  she reported back to work.\r\n\r\nPetitioner subsequently commenced this action which ultimately \r\n  resulted in a jury verdict in her favor on her cause of action alleging a violation \r\n  of the FMLA. By agreement of the parties, damages were submitted to the trial \r\n  judge for determination. Pursuant to the FMLA, the trial judge awarded petitioner \r\n  $103,273 in back pay for her pre-trial loss of wages, plus prejudgment interest \r\n  of $32,756.90. He further awarded petitioner $304,845.69 in \"front pay.\" Finally, \r\n  the trial judge applied 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii) which allows for an award \r\n  of \"liquidated damages\" for an FMLA violation. He calculated the amount of liquidated \r\n  damages by adding the amount of back pay, prejudgment interest, and front pay, \r\n  for a total of $440,875.59 in liquidated damages. \r\n\r\nOn appeal, Waffle House contested the award of front pay \r\n  claiming it was highly speculative because it was based on the assumption petitioner \r\n  would have worked for Waffle House for another nineteen years until her retirement \r\n  at age sixty-five. The Court of Appeals agreed and modified the front pay award \r\n  from $304,845.69 to $84,251.80, based on four years of front pay rather than \r\n  nineteen.\r\n\r\nWaffle House further argued to the Court of Appeals that \r\n  the front pay award should not have been included in the calculation of liquidated \r\n  damages. The Court of Appeals agreed and reduced the liquidated damages award \r\n  from $440,875.59 to $136,029.90. \r\n\r\n\r\n    ISSUES  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Was front pay properly included in the calculation of \r\n    liquidated damages?\r\n\r\n  2. Was the amount of front pay proper?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Liquidated damages \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe FMLA provides specific statutory relief for a violation \r\n  of its provisions. Under 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2617(a)(1), an employer who violates the \r\n  Act is liable to the employee:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) for damages equal to-\r\n\r\n  \r\n(i) the amount of -\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n(I) any wages, salary, employment benefits, or other compensation \r\n  denied or lost to such employee by reason of the violation; or\r\n\r\n(II) in a case in which wages, salary, employment benefits, \r\n  or other compensation have not been denied or lost to the employee, any actual \r\n  monetary losses...;\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii) the interest on the amount described in clause \r\n  (i) calculated at the prevailing rate; and\r\n\r\n(iii) an additional amount as liquidated damages \r\n  equal to the sum of the amount described in clause (i) and the interest described \r\n  in clause (ii) ....; and\r\n\r\n  \r\n(B) for such equitable relief as may be \r\n  appropriate, including employment, reinstatement, and promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nUnder this statute, the liquidated damages award is affected \r\n  by whether front pay is classified as \"damages\" under clause (a)(1)(A)(i) or \r\n  \"equitable relief\" under clause (a)(1)(B) because relief classified as equitable \r\n  is not included in the calculation of liquidated damages. Citing federal case \r\n  law, the Court of Appeals ruled front pay was equitable relief and therefore \r\n  should not be included in the calculation of liquidated damages. \r\n\r\nThe classification of front pay as legal or equitable relief \r\n  impacts a substantial right of the plaintiff and therefore federal case law \r\n  controls. See   Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131, 151 (1988) (in ruling \r\n  on federal causes of action, state courts have a constitutional duty to protect \r\n  all the substantial rights of the parties under controlling federal law);  Johnson \r\n  v. Fankell, 520 U.S. 911 (1997) (where application of state rule will produce \r\n  a different outcome depending on whether claim is brought in state or federal \r\n  court, state rule is pre-empted). The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has specifically \r\n  held front pay is equitable relief under Â§ 2617(a)(1)(B) of the FMLA.  Nichols \r\n  v. Ashland Hosp. Corp., 251 F.3d 496 (4th Cir. 2001) citing \r\n  \r\n  Cline v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 294 (4th Cir. 1998); accord \r\n  \r\n  Thorson v. Gemini, Inc., 205 F.3d 370 (8th Cir. 2000). \r\n  (3)\r\n\r\nApplying federal precedent, we hold front pay is equitable relief under clause (a)(1)(B).  Because\r\nliquidated damages do not include equitable relief, the Court of Appeals properly excluded front\r\npay from the calculation of liquidated damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. Amount of front pay award\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held the front pay award for nineteen years was \"highly speculative and\r\nunsupported by the record.\"  It then held, without explanation, that under its view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence, four years' front pay was \"a more appropriate award.\"  Petitioner\r\ncontends the evidence supports the award because petitioner testified she would have worked at\r\nWaffle House until she retired at age sixty-five. (4)\r\n\r\nIn considering the issue of front pay, federal courts have \r\n  recognized its speculative character and therefore give wide latitude to the \r\n  trial court.  Duke v. Uniroyal, Inc., 928 F.2d 1413 (4th Cir. 1991);\r\n \r\n  Deloach v. Delchamps, Inc., 897 F.2d 815 (5th Cir. 1990). As stated \r\n  by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals: \"The infinite variety of factual circumstances \r\n  that can be anticipated do not render any remedy of front pay susceptible to \r\n  legal standards for awarding damages.\" Duke, 928 F.2d at 1424. Accordingly, \r\n  where the trial court has used permissible bases for awarding front pay, no \r\n  abuse of discretion will be found. Duke, supra; Deloach, supra. \r\n  The factors that may be considered in awarding front pay include the length \r\n  of prior employment, the permanency of the position held, the nature of the \r\n  work, and the age and physical condition of the employee, along with other factors \r\n  affecting the employer-employee relationship.  Reneau v. Wayne Griffin &amp; \r\n  Sons, Inc., 945 F.2d 869 (5th Cir. 1991). Evidence of future employment \r\n  prospects may also be considered. Nichols, supra.\r\n\r\nFront pay is awarded as a complement or as an alternative \r\n  to reinstatement. Duke, 928 F.2d at 1424. If reinstatement is shown to be infeasible, \r\n  for instance because of a hostile atmosphere, front pay may be awarded in lieu \r\n  thereof or to reimburse the employee until the time of reinstatement. See \r\n  generally  Pollard, 532 U.S. at 853-54. \r\n\r\nUnder the FMLA, an employee is entitled to reinstatement \r\n  upon return from leave. 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2614(a)(1)(A). Once an employee proves she \r\n  was denied reinstatement, the employer must prove the employee would have been \r\n  laid off in any event for some other reason in order to defeat a claim for reinstatement.\r\n \r\n  Smith v. Diffee Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., ___ F.3d ___ (5th Cir. \r\n  2002) (2002 WL 1753175 (5th Cir. filed July 29, 2002); see also \r\n  29 C.F.R. Â§ 825.216 (a) (\"An employer must be able to show that an employee \r\n  would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested \r\n  in order to deny restoration to employment.\"). Similarly, the employer must \r\n  bear the burden of proving the employee is not entitled to front pay, which \r\n  is awarded in lieu of reinstatement, if the employee seeks front pay rather \r\n  than reinstatement.\r\n\r\nIt is uncontested petitioner was denied reinstatement upon her return from FMLA leave.  She\r\nclaimed front pay based on her entitlement to reinstatement.  It was Waffle House's burden to\r\nshow petitioner would have been terminated for an unrelated reason while on FMLA leave, or that\r\nher continued employment would have been limited, in order to defeat or reduce the claim for\r\nfront pay; in the alternative, Waffle House could have asserted the feasibility of reinstatement in\r\nlieu of a front pay award.  Waffle House failed to carry its burden on this issue.  We defer to the\r\ntrial judge's judgment and affirm the award of front pay.  The Court of Appeals's decision\r\nvacating the award is reversed.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n1. 341 S.C. 461, 534 S.E.2d 282 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000). \r\n2. 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2615 et seq. \r\n3. Under federal law generally, front \r\n  pay is considered equitable relief in lieu of reinstatement. See, e.g., \r\n  \r\n  Mota v. Univ. of Texas Houston Health Science Ctr., 261 F.3d 512 (5th \r\n  Cir. 2001) (Title VII);  Duke v. Uniroyal, Inc., 928 F.2d 1413 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1991) (ADEA);  see generally   Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204 (2002) (construing the term \"equitable relief\" \r\n  in ERISA statute to mean \"those categories of relief that were typically available \r\n  in equity\") and   Pollard v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 532 U.S. \r\n  843 (2001) (under Title VII, front pay is an award made in lieu of reinstatement \r\n  and is not an element of compensatory damages). \r\n4. The trial judge found petitioner would \r\n  have continued her job but for her unlawful termination. He considered the fact \r\n  petitioner had an excellent work record at Waffle House and that there was no \r\n  evidence she could not have continued her job as restaurant manager. Further, \r\n  she had been working for 3Â½ years at her present employment with no promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25533","title":"In the Matter of Richard C.

Bell, Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25533\r\nSubmitted September 9, 2002 - Filed \r\n  October 14, 2002\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Senior Assistant Attorney \r\n  General James G. Bogle, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel.\r\nRichard C. Bell, of San Antonio, Texas, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a sanction ranging from \r\n  a public reprimand to a definite suspension.  We accept the agreement and issue \r\n  a two-year definite suspension, but decline to run the two year suspension concurrent \r\n  with the nine month suspension imposed on respondent in 1998. \r\n  [1]  The facts as admitted in the agreement are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nThis is the third occasion in which the Court has sanctioned \r\n  respondent.  In addition to the nine month suspension imposed in 1998, this \r\n  Court has publicly reprimanded respondent.  In re Bell, 289 S.C. 290, \r\n  345 S.E.2d 475 (1986).  \r\nJudge Thomas Foster Matter\r\nRespondent was an officer of A \r\n  Loving Choice Adoption Agency, Inc. (Loving Choice).  Loving Choice was pursuing \r\n  an adoption case before Judge Foster on December 29, 1998.  As required by law, \r\n  Loving Choice was required to submit an accounting of all expenses paid during \r\n  the adoption.  Loving Choice submitted an accounting, and it was discovered \r\n  that a check in the amount of $500 had been paid to respondent as an attorney.  \r\n\r\nJudge Thomas was aware that the \r\n  Court suspended respondent from the practice of law on July 20, 1998, and informed \r\n  the Commission on Lawyer Conduct that respondent had accepted $500 while being \r\n  suspended from the practice of law.  The Commission sent respondent a copy of \r\n  Judge Fosterâ€™s complaint, and inquired as to whether respondent had received \r\n  money for practicing law during his suspension.  The Commission requested that \r\n  respondent provide written documentation related to the $500 payment.  \r\nRespondent explained that he received \r\n  the $500 payment prior to his suspension but that he could not locate any documentation \r\n  supporting his claim.  Because respondent could not produce documentation supporting \r\n  his claim, the Commission concluded that respondent had violated Rule 417, SCACR.  \r\n  Specifically, respondent failed to keep copies of accountings to clients or \r\n  third persons; failed to keep copies of bills for legal fees and expenses rendered \r\n  to clients; and failed to keep copies of records showing disbursements on behalf \r\n  of clients.  \r\nSamuel \r\n  Crews and Lyn Howell Hensel Matter\r\nSamuel Crews represented a couple \r\n  seeking an adoptive family for their child.  Crewsâ€™ clients chose an adopting \r\n  family who were represented by Lyn Howell Hensel.  Henselâ€™s clients paid Crewsâ€™ \r\n  clientsâ€™ expenses during the pregnancy; however, Crewsâ€™ clients decided that \r\n  they did not want Henselâ€™s clients adopting their child.  \r\nCrewsâ€™ clients selected another \r\n  adopting family through Loving Choice.  Respondent represented to Crews that \r\n  he was Loving Choiceâ€™s attorney.  As a result, Crews repeatedly requested that \r\n  respondent identify the new adoptive family, identify the new adoptive familyâ€™s \r\n  attorney, and inform him of the location of the eventual adoption hearing.  \r\n  Mr. Crews also repeatedly requested that respondent reimburse him for the attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee expended by Crews, as well as the expenses paid by Henselâ€™s clients.\r\nRespondent never reimbursed Crewsâ€™ \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fee, nor did respondent pay the expenses incurred by Henselâ€™s clients.            \r\n\r\nClient Matter\r\nClients entered into an agreement with Loving Choice \r\n  to assist them with the adoption of a child, and retained respondent to represent \r\n  them.  Prior to representing clients, respondent informed clients that he was \r\n  married to the director of Loving Choice and that he was Loving Choiceâ€™s attorney.  \r\n  Respondent further informed clients that a conflict of interest may arise, and \r\n  if a conflict of interest did arise, he would withdraw from representing clients \r\n  and Loving Choice in the matter.\r\nClients paid Loving Choice $6,000.  Loving Choice located \r\n  a birth mother for clients; however, when the baby was born, the birth mother \r\n  elected not to proceed with the adoption.  Loving Choice refunded $1,843.87 \r\n  to clients.  \r\nLoving Choice then located another birth mother for \r\n  clients.  An employee of Loving Choice or respondent informed clients that the \r\n  child would be born on June 6, 1997.  In May 1997, respondent informed clients \r\n  that the baby would be born in September 1997 or November 1997.  In June 1997, \r\n  respondent informed clients that the baby would be born on September 13, 1997.  \r\n\r\nSometime in October or November of 1996, clients requested \r\n  the birth motherâ€™s medical records from Loving Choice.  On March 12, 1997, clients \r\n  contacted respondent, and he informed them that the birth mother had been examined \r\n  by a doctor in Clarkâ€™s Hill.  This information was false.    \r\nIn June 1997, clients received a copy of birth motherâ€™s \r\n  medical records.  The medical records evidenced that the birth mother had a \r\n  greater number of prior pregnancies than represented by Loving Choice.  The \r\n  medical records also suggested contradictory due dates for the birth of the \r\n  baby.  The medical records contained a document showing that the birth mother \r\n  tested positive for pregnancy on January 15, 1997, that she was nineteen and \r\n  one-half weeks pregnant, and that her delivery date was June 17, 1997.  This \r\n  document was a forgery.  The birth mother was not pregnant on January 15, 1997, \r\n  and no pregnancy test had been performed.      \r\nRespondent acknowledged the discrepancies in the medical \r\n  records, offered regret, and concluded, â€œ[t]he fact seems to be that the [birth \r\n  mother] is pregnant [and] will deliver a healthy baby in September.â€  Respondent \r\n  then informed clients that if they wanted to follow through with the adoption, \r\n  they would be required to remit $4,915.75 to bring their account current and \r\n  remit another payment of $6,329 by July 13, 1997.  Clients responded by informing \r\n  respondent that they did not want to adopt the baby, but asked respondent to \r\n  locate another birth mother.  Clients also requested that respondent refund \r\n  the money they paid, $12,015.   Loving Choice refunded $12,000 to clients.  \r\n\r\nClients also requested that respondent provide them \r\n  with an expense statement and a copy of the bills showing how their money was \r\n  spent during the failed adoption.  Respondent never provided clients with this \r\n  information. \r\nRespondent failed to disclose the pitfalls associated \r\n  with the representation of multiple clients.  Respondent also failed to disclose \r\n  actual or potential conflicts of interest to clients, and he failed to explain \r\n  whose interests he represented.  Moreover, when a conflict of interest arose \r\n  between clients and Loving Choice, respondent failed to explain the conflict \r\n  of interest to clients, and he did not withdraw from representation as he indicated \r\n  that he would.  Furthermore, respondent did not disclose to clients the advantages \r\n  and risks involved in an adoption proceeding.      \r\nLaw\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated the following Rules of \r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent \r\n  representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer shall not counsel a client to \r\n  engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or \r\n  fraudulent); Rule 1.7 (a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation \r\n  of that client may be materially limited by the lawyerâ€™s responsibilities to \r\n  another client); and Rule 8.4(d) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving \r\n  dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation). \r\nRespondent has also violated Rule 7(a)(5) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary \r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR; by engaging in conduct tending to pollute the \r\n  administration of justice or bring the legal profession into disrepute.   \r\nFinally, respondent admits that he violated the financial record keeping requirements \r\n  found in Rule 417, SCACR.\r\n Conclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a two-year  suspension.  We therefore \r\n  accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the \r\n  practice of law for two years.  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, \r\n  respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has \r\n  complied with Rule 30, Rule 413, SCACR.  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In re Bell, 332 S.C. 6, 503 S.E.2d \r\n    731 (1998).   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25534","title":"In the Matter of F.

Ballard, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to \r\n  Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent conditionally \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension from the practice of \r\n  law for a period of up to nine months. \r\n  [1]   We accept the agreement and suspend respondent for nine months. [2]  The facts as admitted in the agreement \r\n  are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent was retained by Client, a personal acquaintance, \r\n  to represent Client in various matters from January 1993 through September 1994.  \r\n  Client had previously recovered a sum of money in a divorce proceeding and, \r\n  after consulting respondent, invested the funds in Waterhouse II, L.P (Waterhouse), \r\n  a company in which respondent owned a substantial interest.  Waterhouse owned \r\n  property in Beaufort County, South Carolina and planned to construct and operate \r\n  an assisted living complex for elderly people.  \r\nClient invested $69,500 in Waterhouse through loans \r\n  evidenced by four promissory notes.  The first note was in the amount of $49,500 \r\n  and executed by Atlantis Title Agency (Atlantis Title), which was the general \r\n  partner of Waterhouse and solely owned by respondent.  The note was secured \r\n  by 11% of the shares of stock in Waterhouse.  A second note in the amount of \r\n  $25,000 was also executed by Atlantis Title and secured by 7% of the shares \r\n  of stock in Waterhouse.\r\n A third note in the amount of $15,000 and secured by 2 \r\n  Â½ % of the shares of stock in Waterhouse was executed by another acquaintance \r\n  of respondent (Acquaintance) and prepared by respondent.  The fourth note, also \r\n  prepared by respondent, was in the amount of $5000 and unsecured.  None of these \r\n  notes were paid on maturity or thereafter by respondent or Acquaintance.    \r\n\r\nThroughout all periods relevant to this agreement, respondent, \r\n  Atlantis Title, and Acquaintance owned interests in Waterhouse, and respondent \r\n  was the sole owner of Atlantis Title.\r\nAfter respondent began representing Client, respondent \r\n  became aware that Acquaintance was having significant financial difficulties, \r\n  was involved in a divorce, and had filed for bankruptcy protection.  However, \r\n  respondent failed to advise Client of Acquaintanceâ€™s financial difficulties.  \r\n  Respondent was also aware that Atlantis Title would be unable to honor Clientâ€™s \r\n  notes upon maturity, but failed to notify Client.  Respondent did not advise \r\n  Client how to seek legal recourse against Acquaintance and Atlantis Title, and \r\n  did not inform Client that Client might have had certain remedies of recision \r\n  relating to the issuance of stock in Waterhouse.  Respondent also failed to \r\n  advise Client that she might have been able to seek additional security for \r\n  payment of the notes.  Further, respondent failed to advise Client of possible \r\n  conflicts of interest and that she should seek independent legal advice concerning \r\n  her investments in Waterhouse.\r\nAs a result of the default on the notes, Client initiated \r\n  legal proceedings.  Respondent consented to an order of judgment against him \r\n  to expedite recovery by the Client from respondentâ€™s insurance carrier.  As \r\n  a result, Client has partially recovered her claimed losses under a confidential \r\n  settlement agreement with the insurance carrier.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that his conduct violated the following \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (failing to provide \r\n  competent representation); Rule 1.2 (failing to abide by a client's decisions \r\n  concerning the objectives of representation, and failing to consult with the \r\n  client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (failing to \r\n  act with reasonable diligence and promptness while representing a client); Rule \r\n  1.4 (failure to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter \r\n  and failing to promptly comply with requests for information); Rule 1.7 (a lawyer \r\n  shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially \r\n  limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person, \r\n  or by the lawyer's own interests); Rule 1.8 (a lawyer shall not enter \r\n  into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, \r\n  possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless \r\n  the terms of the transaction are in writing and fair and reasonable to the client \r\n  and the client is given an opportunity to seek advice from independent counsel); \r\n  Rule 2.1 (failing to exercise independent professional judgment and render candid \r\n  advice to client); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a definite suspension.  Accordingly, \r\n  we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from \r\n  the practice of law for nine months.  Within fifteen days of the date of this \r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing \r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] In 1997, this Court suspended \r\n    respondent for 60 days for engaging in business dealings with a client.

Swerling, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W.

App. 2000). \r\n  (1) We affirm in result.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis case arose out of a single State Grand Jury (SGJ) prosecution involving numerous co-defendants.  Essentially, the state's case\r\ninvolved a conspiracy to traffic cocaine in the upstate between 1990-1996.  Each time police made an arrest, they would seek\r\ncooperation from the arrestee and arrange controlled buys from other members of the conspiracy.  The state alleged that Jose\r\nCastineira was the head supplier, who supplied large amounts of cocaine to O'Bryant (O.B.) Harris who in turn supplied to other\r\ndistributors, including petitioner Miller, (2) and a distributor named Todd Brank.  Brank sold to Timothy Hammitt.  Ultimately, the\r\nSGJ indicted twenty-six defendants, eighteen of whom pled guilty; the remaining eight, including Timothy Hammitt, Jose Castineira\r\nand Miller, were tried together in April-May 1997.  Miller was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in 400 grams of cocaine and\r\nsentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment.   \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Was Miller properly sentenced for trafficking pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370 (e)(2)(e)(2002)?\r\n\r\n2.  Was Miller's conspiracy conviction prohibited by virtue of his 1991  plea to conspiracy under a federal indictment?\r\n\r\n3.  Did the court err in denying Miller's motion for a severance?\r\n\r\n4.  Did the court err in denying Miller's motion for a directed verdict?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370 (e)(2)(e)(2002),   \r\n\r\n\r\n  (e) Any person who knowingly sells, manufactures, cultivates, delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, or who provides\r\nfinancial assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell, manufacture, cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring\r\ninto this State, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession or who knowingly attempts to become in actual or\r\nconstructive possession of:\r\n(2) ten grams or more of cocaine or any mixtures containing cocaine, as provided in Section 44-53-210(b)(4), is guilty of a\r\nfelony which is known as \"trafficking in cocaine\" and, upon conviction, must be punished as follows if the quantity involved is:\r\n\r\n(e) four hundred grams or more, a term of imprisonment of not less than twenty-five years nor more than thirty years with a\r\nmandatory minimum term of imprisonment of twenty-five years, no part of which may be suspended nor probation granted, and a\r\nfine of two hundred thousand dollars.  . . . \r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).  The statute goes on to state that, \"[n]otwithstanding Section 44-53-420, a person convicted of\r\nconspiracy pursuant to this subsection must be sentenced as provided in this section with a full sentence or punishment\r\nand not one-half of the sentence or punishment prescribed for the offense.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  \r\n\r\nPetitioner cites S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-420 (2002), contending his punishment should not have exceeded one-half of that for\r\ntrafficking in excess of 400 grams of cocaine (i.e., one-half of thirty years).  Section 44-53-420 provides: \r\n\r\n\r\nAny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense made unlawful by the provisions of this article shall, upon conviction,\r\nbe fined or imprisoned in the same manner as for the offense planned or attempted;  but such fine or imprisonment shall not exceed\r\none half of the punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals held in  Castineira, supra, \r\n  that section 44-53-420 did not apply; it found the language of section 44-53-370(e), \r\n  under which the defendant was indicted, incorporates conspiracy within the substantive \r\n  offense. 341 S.C. at 625-26, 535 S.E.2d at 452-53. We agree. Clearly, the plain \r\n  and unambiguous language of section 44-53-370(e) reflects a legislative intent \r\n  that those guilty of conspiring to traffic drugs thereunder are subject to the \r\n  full sentence for the offense, rather than the one-half sentence provided in \r\n  section 44-53-420.\r\n\r\nRecently, in Harris v. State, Op. No. 25437 (filed \r\n  April 8, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 10 at 29, 31), this Court noted that \r\n  \"as defined in [section 44-53-370(e)(2)], there is no distinction between conspiracy \r\n  to traffick and the substantive offense of trafficking. . . . The legislature \r\n  clearly intended that conspiracy to traffic be treated as trafficking under \r\n  Â§ 44-53-370(e).\"\r\n\r\nPetitioner asserts there is a difference between \"trafficking \r\n  by conspiracy\" and a \"conspiracy to traffic.\" Essentially, he claims one may \r\n  be guilty of the substantive offense of \"trafficking by conspiracy\" only if \r\n  that person conspires to sell, manufacture, deliver or bring into the state \r\n  more than 10 grams of cocaine. Any other conspiracy to violate the trafficking \r\n  statute, he contends, is \"conspiracy to traffic\" which is exempted by section \r\n  44-53-420. (3) This contention is untenable. \r\n  Contrary to petitioner's contention, the Harris court specifically found \r\n  that the legislature intended conspiracy to traffic be treated as trafficking. \r\n  Petitioner's attempt to circumvent this result with a distinction between a \r\n  substantive offense of \"trafficking by conspiracy\" and \"conspiracy to traffic\" \r\n  is unavailing. (4) Accordingly, Miller's twenty-five \r\n  year sentence is affirmed. \r\n\r\n2.  MILLER'S FEDERAL CONSPIRACY ARREST\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 1991, Miller was arrested by federal authorities in conjunction with a cocaine transaction which occurred between\r\nMay 7, 1991 and May 16, 1991.  A three-count indictment was issued charging Miller and one James Nesbitt with  conspiracy to\r\ndistribute two kilos of cocaine, distribution of two kilos of cocaine, and possession with intent to distribute eight ounces of cocaine. \r\nNo other conspirators were named in the federal indictment; the indictment did state, however, that Miller and Nesbitt conspired\r\n\"with various other persons both known and unknown.\"  Miller agreed to plead guilty to one count upon the government's\r\nagreement to move to dismiss the other two counts. (5)  Accordingly, on September 6, 1991, Miller pled guilty to conspiracy to\r\npossess with intent to distribute cocaine.  However, he remained out of jail for nearly two years (until May 1993), when he was\r\nsentenced to sixty months in prison by a federal judge. \r\n\r\nIn August 1993, the SGJ began an undercover investigation (dubbed Operation Cue Ball) by making undercover drug buys from an\r\nindividual named Michael Greer.  Greer gave police information which led to the arrest of James Smith a/k/a Smitty, who in turn\r\nimplicated James Hattaway, who then implicated Todd Brank, who set up controlled buys from Jerome \"Babe\" Harris, who is\r\nMiller's half-brother.  Brank, who implicated Miller, testified that Miller had been his cocaine supplier until Miller went to prison in\r\nMay 1993.  Miller admitted his participation but maintained that his involvement in the conspiracy had ended with his federal arrest. \r\nContrary to Miller's testimony, however, O.B. Harris testified he continued to supply Miller with cocaine from the time of his 1991\r\narrest until his 1993 incarceration, and had even had continued drug dealings with Miller while Miller was in jail.  Brank testified he\r\nhad purchased approximately 3 kilos of cocaine from Miller between 1991-1993. \r\n\r\nMiller was indicted by the SGJ on October 8, 1996, for conspiring to traffic 400 grams of cocaine between 1991-1996.  He\r\nmoved to dismiss the SGJ indictment on the ground that there had been but one conspiracy, to which he had already pled guilty in\r\nconjunction with his 1991 federal drug arrest, such that the state prosecution was prohibited by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-410\r\n(2002) and the Double Jeopardy clauses. (6)  The trial court ruled Miller's involvement in the conspiracy ended on the date of his\r\narrest on May 16, 1991, and instructed the jury that in order to convict Miller, it would have to find he conspired after that date. \r\nThe Court of Appeals agreed finding, as a matter of law, that Miller's involvement in the conspiracy ended with his arrest and\r\nconviction.  342 S.C. at 199, 535 S.E.2d at 656. (7)  Accordingly, it found his continued participation thereafter constituted a new\r\nact for which he could be prosecuted.  We agree. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-410 (2002) states, \"If a violation of this article is a violation of a Federal law or the law of another state,\r\nthe conviction or acquittal under Federal law or the law of another state for the same act is a bar to prosecution in this State.\" \r\n(Emphasis supplied).  Accordingly, the issue before us is whether Miller's arrest effectually ended his participation in the initial\r\nconspiracy, such that his \"re-entry\" or continued participation thereafter constitutes a separate act, or a new \"agreement\" for which\r\nhe was properly prosecuted. (8)  Under several authorities, we find that it is.\r\n\r\nIn United States v. Asher, 96 F.3d 270 (7th Cir.1996), \r\n  cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1100 (1997), the Seventh Circuit held a conspirator's \r\n  re-entry into the same conspiracy for which he was previously convicted can \r\n  lead to a second prosecution for conspiracy without violating the Double Jeopardy \r\n  Clause. 96 F.3d at 273-74. Asher pled guilty to an automobile theft conspiracy. \r\n  He served a term of imprisonment and upon release immediately became involved \r\n  in the same conspiracy. He was again charged with conspiracy and raised a double \r\n  jeopardy claim. The Seventh Circuit upheld the second prosecution finding Asher \r\n  entered into a new agreement to commit a crime when he decided to rejoin the \r\n  stolen vehicle ring following his release from prison. The court noted \"[u]doubtedly, \r\n  Congress could have chose to punish rejoining a conspiracy in addition to punishing \r\n  the original conspiracy without running afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\" \r\n  Id. at 274. \r\n\r\n  Similarly, in United States v. Dunn, 775 F.2d 604 \r\n  (5th Cir.1985), the defendant was separately indicted for two conspiracies to \r\n  manufacture amphetamines, one conspiracy running from early 1979-April 1983 \r\n  (the San Antonio indictment), and the other between July 23, 1980-November 1980, \r\n  the date of Dunn's arrest (the Austin indictment). The San Antonio indictment \r\n  was specifically amended to limit Dunn's participation in the conspiracy to \r\n  dates after his November 1980 arrest. Dunn was convicted of the San Antonio \r\n  conspiracy and maintained he was convicted twice for his uninterrupted activities \r\n  in a continuing criminal conspiracy when there was no evidence of a second agreement. \r\n  See Dunn, 775 F.2d at 606. The Dunn court stated, \"it is well \r\n  settled that a person's participation in a conspiracy ends when that person \r\n  is arrested for his role in the conspiracy.\" Id. at 607,  citing United \r\n  States v. Postal, 589 F.2d 862 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. \r\n  832 (1979).\r\n\r\nThe Dunn court went on to note that \"further [participation \r\n  in an] 'old' conspiracy after being charged with that crime becomes a new offense \r\n  for purposes of a double jeopardy claim.\"  Id.,  \r\n  citing United States v. Stricklin, 591 F.2d 1112, 1121 n. 2 (5th Cir.), \r\n  cert. denied, 444 U.S. 963, 100 S.Ct. 449, 62 L.Ed.2d 375 (1979) (emphasis \r\n  supplied).  See&nbsp;also United States v. Lopez, 153 F.3d 723 (4th \r\n  Cir.), cert' denied 525 U.S. 975 (1998)(defendant indicted for a second \r\n  conspiracy for his post-arrest activities while out on bond; court adopted reasoning \r\n  of Asher and Dunn to find defendant's involvement in first conspiracy \r\n  ended with arrest and conviction such that they could be subjected to prosecution \r\n  for any further involvement in the on-going conspiracy); United States v. \r\n  Romero, 967 F.2d 63, 68 (2d Cir.1992)(defendant not subjected to double \r\n  jeopardy when tried for conspiracy to violate federal narcotics statutes and \r\n  engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, even though he had previously \r\n  pled guilty to conspiracy to violate RICO in connection with drug dealing and \r\n  the new charges dealt with the period after his guilty plea); United States \r\n  v. Sharpe, 193 F.3d 852 (5th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, \r\n  528 U.S. 1173 (2000) (person's participation in conspiracy ends when that person \r\n  is arrested for his role in the conspiracy); United States v. Goff, 847 \r\n  F.2d 149 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 932 (1988)(arrest \r\n  of several members of conspiracy does not necessarily terminate conspiracy, \r\n  although arrested member's participation in conspiracy ends at time of arrest); \r\n  People v. Wilson, 563 N.W.2d 44 (Mich. 1997) (defendants' role in conspiracy \r\n  ended with their arrest notwithstanding underlying conspiracy may have been \r\n  on-going). \r\n\r\nWe adopt the reasoning of the above authorities. We hold \r\n  that the re-entry into a continuing conspiracy subsequent to the defendant's \r\n  arrest is, for purposes of double jeopardy, the formation of a new agreement. \r\n  Accordingly, we find Miller's participation, subsequent to his May 1991, arrest \r\n  constituted a new offense for which he could be prosecuted.  Dunn, supra. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.  SEVERANCE/PRIOR BAD ACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller next asserts the trial court erred in refusing to sever his trial from that of his codefendants; he claims prejudicial error in\r\nadmission of evidence of his \"prior bad acts\" in the conspiracy, which occurred prior to May 16, 1991 (the date of his federal\r\narrest).  He contends this evidence was prejudicial and reversible. \r\n\r\nInitially, as noted by the Court of Appeals, although Miller \r\n  requested a severance and claimed this evidence would be prejudicial, he did \r\n  not request a severance based upon the issue which he now raises, i.e., that \r\n  lack of a severance would result in admission of improper prior bad act evidence \r\n  under Rule 404(b), SCRE, and State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 \r\n  (1923). (9) Accordingly, this issue is not preserved. \r\n  State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997); State v. Bailey, \r\n  298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989) (party may not argue one ground at trial and \r\n  then an alternative ground on appeal). In any event, Miller has not demonstrated \r\n  prejudice from the lack of a severance. \r\n\r\nA motion for severance is addressed to the trial court and \r\n  should not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion is shown. Charges can \r\n  be joined in the same indictment and tried together where they (1) arise out \r\n  of a single chain of circumstances, (2) are proved by the same evidence, (3) \r\n  are of the same general nature, and (4) no real right of the defendant has been \r\n  prejudiced. State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996)&nbsp;cert. \r\n  denied 520 U.S. 1200 (1997). Recently, this Court noted that \"a severance \r\n  should be granted only when there is a serious risk that a joint trial would \r\n  compromise a specific trial right of a co-defendant or prevent the jury from \r\n  making a reliable judgment about a co-defendant's guilt. . . . An appellate \r\n  court should not reverse a conviction achieved at a joint trial in the absence \r\n  of a reasonable probability that the defendant would have obtained a more favorable \r\n  result at a separate trial. \" Hughes v. State, 346 S.C. 554, 558-59, \r\n  552 S.E.2d 315, 317 (2001). \r\n\r\nHere, the trial court explicitly instructed the jury that \r\n  Miller could only be convicted of conspiracy if it found he conspired to traffic \r\n  in cocaine after May 16, 1991. Further, Miller's defense at trial was that he \r\n  had, in fact, participated in the conspiracy up until his federal arrest, but \r\n  that he had ceased participating thereafter. Since Miller's sole defense was \r\n  that his participation in the conspiracy ended in May 1991, introduction of \r\n  his prior drug conviction was inextricably linked with his defense, such that \r\n  it would necessarily have been admitted in a separate trial.  Hughes, supra. \r\n  Accordingly, Miller was not prejudiced by admission of this evidence, nor is \r\n  there any reasonable probability he would have obtained a more favorable result \r\n  at a separate trial.\r\n\r\n4.  DIRECTED VERDICT\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Miller asserts he was entitled to a directed verdict as there was insufficient evidence of a separate conspiracy subsequent to\r\nhis federal arrest.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, \r\n  the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State. If there \r\n  is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably \r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that \r\n  the case was properly submitted to the jury. State v. McGowan, 347 S.C. \r\n  618, 557 S.E.2d 657 (2001). \r\n\r\nMiller concedes the state presented evidence of his participation in the conspiracy subsequent to his federal arrest.  Accordingly,\r\ngiven our holding in Issue 1 that his participation in the initial conspiracy ended with his federal arrest, we find the issue of his re-entry or subsequent participation in the conspiracy was properly submitted to the jury.  The Court of Appeals properly upheld the\r\ndenial of Miller's motion for a directed verdict.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.

I agree with the majority that there is no distinction for \r\n  sentencing purposes between \"trafficking by conspiracy\" and \"conspiracy to traffic.\" \r\n  I do not agree, however, that we should adopt the Fifth Circuit's rule \r\n  (10) that an arrest ends the arrestee's role in a conspiracy as a \r\n  matter of law.  See, e.g. United States v. Dunn, 775 F. 2d 604 (5th \r\n  Cir. 1985). I would hold that petitioner may be prosecuted in state court for \r\n  his role in this conspiracy only if the jury finds that he withdrew and then \r\n  rejoined it. I would therefore reverse petitioner's conviction and remand for \r\n  a new trial.\r\n\r\nThe gravamen of a conspiracy is the agreement.  E.g., \r\n  State v. Amerson, 311 S.C. 316, 428 S.E.2d 871 (1993). An individual who \r\n  joins the conspiracy remains a party to it until he withdraws or until the conspiracy \r\n  terminates. A withdrawal is effective only when it is communicated to the other \r\n  members of the conspiracy. State v. Woods, 189 S.C. 281, 1 S.E.2d 198 \r\n  (1939);  see also State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 437 S.E.2d 175 (1993). \r\n  \"It is always a question for the jury to determine by the facts and circumstances \r\n  in the case if a person has retired from the unlawful and illegal conspiracy \r\n  . . . . .\" State v. Rook, 174 S.C. 225, 235, 177 S.E. 143, 147 (1934).\r\n\r\n In my view, petitioner's state prosecution for his role \r\n  in the drug conspiracy is barred by S.C. Code Ann. Â§44-53-410 (Supp. 2000) \r\n  (11) unless the state can prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that petitioner \r\n  withdrew and then reentered (by making a new agreement) the continuing conspiracy. \r\n  This evidentiary requirement is consistent with that imposed in successive conspiracy \r\n  prosecutions by both the Second and the Seventh Circuits.  See, e.g. United \r\n  States v. Romero, 967 F.2d 63, 67 (2d Cir. 1992)(Double Jeopardy no bar \r\n  to a second conspiracy prosecution if the government can \"demonstrate that every \r\n  element of [the second] conspiracy offense happened after the date \r\n  of the plea [to the first conspiracy indictment]\")(emphasis supplied); United \r\n  States v. Asher, 96 F.3d 270, 272 (7th Cir. 1996) (Double Jeopardy \r\n  no bar to second conspiracy prosecution if government can show defendant withdrew \r\n  after his first arrest, conviction, and incarceration, and \"that after his release \r\n  from prison, [he] reentered the conspiratorial agreement thereby committing \r\n  a new offense\").\r\n\r\nThere is some appeal to the hard and fast rule adopted by the majority that an arrest terminates participation in a conspiracy as a\r\nmatter of law.  As explained above, however, such a rule does not comport with our conspiracy jurisprudence.  I would therefore\r\nreverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, and remand this matter for a new trial.\r\n\r\n1.  We simultaneously granted certiorari \r\n  to review the related cases of State v. Hammitt, 341 S.C. 638, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  459 (Ct. App. 2000) and State v. Castineira, 341 S.C. 619, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  449 (Ct. App. 2000). Our opinions in those cases are filed separately. \r\n2.   Miller's legal name is Johnny Harold Miller.  His mother  married Jerome Harris subsequent to his birth, which is why Miller is\r\nalso known as Johnny Harris.  \r\n3.  In State v. Raffaldt, 318 \r\n  S.C. 110, 117, 456 S.E.2d 390, 394 (1995), we recognized that trafficking under \r\n  44-53-370(e)(2) may be accomplished by a variety of acts, including such acts \r\n  as providing financial assistance or knowingly having actual or constructive \r\n  possession of cocaine. \r\n4.  Moreover, a majority of this Court \r\n  rejected the analysis of Justice Finney's dissent in State v. Wilson, \r\n  315 S.C. 289, 296, 433 S.E.2d 864, 869-70 (1993), drawing a distinction between \r\n  the offenses of \"conspiracy to traffic\" and \"trafficking by conspiracy.\" \r\n5.   Miller was also pled guilty to conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute, and given a concurrent sixty month\r\nsentence on the same day. \r\n6.   U.S. CONST. amend. V;  S.C. CONST. art.  I, Â§ 12.  \r\n7.   The Court of Appeals erroneously held that the trial court ruled Miller's involvement ended with his arrest and conviction.  The\r\ntrial court held only that Miller's participation terminated with his May 16, 1991 arrest and so instructed the jury. \r\n8.   Miller does not contest that he participated in a conspiracy after his arrest, specifically conceding that he \"continued to actively\r\nparticipate from the date of his federal arrest on May 16, 1991, through the time he pled guilty to the federal charges . . . on\r\nSeptember 6, 1991, and continuing until his incarceration on May 28, 1993. \r\n9.   Miller did object to the admissibility of his statement to police on grounds that it contained evidence of activities for which he had\r\nalready been punished.   Moreover, evidence of the prior conviction was admissible under Rule 609(a)(1)(evidence that accused\r\nhas been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs\r\nits prejudicial effect to the accused).\r\n10. The majority \r\n  cites several cases from other jurisdictions that it contends adopt this same \r\n  rule. In my opinion, however, none of these other cases stand squarely for this \r\n  proposition. For example, the unpublished decision of the Fourth Circuit in \r\n  United States v. Lopez, 1998 WL 776788 (4th Cir. 1998), holds \r\n  that \"The Defendants' involvement in the conspiracy . . . ended with their arrest \r\n  and conviction.\" Id. (emphasis supplied). While the \r\n  Michigan decision does rely on Fifth Circuit precedent in \"noting\" the defendants' \r\n  part in the conspiracy ended when they were arrested, the issue in that case \r\n  was whether the government could invoke an exception to the Double Jeopardy \r\n  bar which allows the state to prosecute a greater crime following a conviction \r\n  for a lesser included offense where the state learned of additional facts after \r\n  the first conviction. People v. Wilson, 454 Mich. 421, 563 N.W.2d 44 \r\n  (1997) (holding government had not met its burden allowing it to invoke the \r\n  Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 (1977) exception).\r\n11. Petitioner \r\n  has no valid Double Jeopardy claim since he is being prosecuted by the state \r\n  following a federal conviction. Abbate v.

We affirm in result.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nRespondents were indicted for armed robbery for perpetrating a sham armed robbery of a convenience store where respondent\r\nSally Parker worked.  At the close of the State's case at trial, respondents moved for a directed verdict on the armed robbery\r\ncharge.  The trial court granted the motion on the armed robbery charge, but stated he would charge the jury on the lesser-included\r\noffense of grand larceny.  No objection was made.  The jury found respondents guilty of grand larceny. (1)\r\n\r\n  The Court of Appeals, in a two to one decision, vacated respondents' convictions, \r\n  finding grand larceny was not a lesser-included offense of armed robbery. The \r\n  majority found the 1993 amendments to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30 (Supp. 2001) \r\n  converted grand larceny from a common law offense to a statutory offense. \r\n  (2)&nbsp; The majority further held the \r\n  amendment made the requirement that the goods taken be valued in excess of one \r\n  thousand dollars an element of grand larceny. State v. Parker, 344 S.C. \r\n  250, 543 S.E.2d 255 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nThe dissent felt the Court of Appeals should not be passing \r\n  upon this issue because this Court had already held that grand larceny is a \r\n  lesser-included offense of armed robbery, a ruling which the dissent felt was \r\n  binding on the Court of Appeals. He further stated that Â§16-13-30 was primarily \r\n  a sentencing statute, and the statute did not abrogate the common law crime \r\n  of grand larceny. The dissent concluded because the larceny statute did not \r\n  replace the state's continued use of the common law, this Court's precedent \r\n  bound the Court of Appeals until that precedent was overruled. However, the \r\n  dissent noted if the Court of Appeals was free to pass upon this issue, he was \r\n  inclined to agree with the majority that grand larceny is not a lesser-included \r\n  offense of armed robbery. State v. Parker, supra.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nIs grand larceny a lesser-included offense of armed robbery?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe circuit court does not have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict a defendant of an offense unless there is an indictment which sufficiently \r\n  states the offense, the defendant waives presentment, or the offense is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of the crime charged in the indictment. State v. Owens, 346 S.C. \r\n  637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001). The test for determining when an offense is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of another is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the \r\n  elements of the lesser offense. State v. McFadden, 342 S.C. 629, 539 \r\n  S.E.2d 387 (2000). If the lesser offense includes an element which is not included \r\n  in the greater offense, then the lesser offense is not included in the greater \r\n  offense. Hope v. State, 328 S.C. 78, 492 S.E.2d 76 (1997).\r\n\r\nLarceny involves the taking and carrying away of the goods \r\n  of another, which must be accomplished against the will or without the consent \r\n  of the other. State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 260 S.E.2d 719 (1979). Specifically, \r\n  grand larceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of the goods of another, \r\n  where the value exceeds $1,000. See State v. Moultrie, 283 S.C. \r\n  352, 322 S.E.2d 663 (1984) (grand larceny is felonious taking and carrying away \r\n  of goods of another where value exceeds $200). (3)&nbsp; \r\n  Robbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful taking of money, goods, \r\n  or other personal property of any value from the person of another or in his \r\n  presence by violence or by putting such person in fear. State v. Drayton, \r\n  293 S.C. 417, 361 S.E.2d 329 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1079, 108 \r\n  S.Ct. 1060, 98 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1988); State v. Scipio, 283 S.C. 124, 322 \r\n  S.E.2d 15 (1984) (robbery is felonious taking and carrying away of goods of \r\n  another, accomplished against will or without consent of other with force); \r\n  State v. Brown, supra (same). Armed robbery occurs when a person \r\n  commits robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. Id. \r\nLarceny has been found to be a lesser-included offense of \r\n  robbery by this Court on several occasions. See State v. Austin, \r\n  299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989) (petit larceny is lesser-included of strong \r\n  armed robbery); State v. Harkness, 288 S.C. 136, 341 S.E.2d 631 (1986) \r\n  (petit larceny is lesser of robbery); State v. Lawson, 279 S.C. 266, \r\n  305 S.E.2d 249 (1983) (grand larceny is lesser-included of robbery); State \r\n  v. Brown, supra (larceny, without indicating whether petit or grand, \r\n  is lesser of robbery); Young v. State, 259 S.C. 383, 192 S.E.2d 212 (1972) \r\n  (grand larceny is lesser-included of robbery). See also State v. \r\n  Ziegler, 274 S.C. 6, 260 S.E.2d 182 (1979) (in dicta, we stated one may \r\n  be guilty of armed robbery which involves grand larceny or petit larceny). \r\n  (4)\r\n\r\n The cases of State v. Lawson, Young v. State, \r\n  and State v. Ziegler are overruled to the extent they found grand larceny \r\n  to be a lesser-included offense of robbery. The monetary value of the goods \r\n  taken is an element of the offense of grand larceny. See Johnson \r\n  v. State, 319 S.C. 62, 459 S.E.2d 840 (1995) (grand larceny involved taking \r\n  and carrying away of goods valued at $200 or more; value is element of grand \r\n  larceny offense); State v. Ates, 297 S.C. 316, 318, 377 S.E.2d 98, 99, \r\n  n.1 (1989) (in grand larceny prosecution, value is critical element; it is State's \r\n  burden to prove value of stolen goods exceeds $200); State v. Moultrie, \r\n  supra (defining grand larceny as felonious taking and carrying away \r\n  of goods of another, where value exceeds $200); State v. Humphery, 276 \r\n  S.C. 42, 274 S.E.2d 918 (1981) (trial court did not abuse discretion in allowing \r\n  State to reopen case and prove value, an essential element of grand larceny); \r\n  State v. Smith, 274 S.C. 622, 266 S.E.2d 422 (1980) (grand larceny is \r\n  felony which includes all elements of lesser offense of petit larceny except \r\n  that grand larceny involves theft of goods valued at fifty dollars or more; \r\n  State must present credible evidence establishing each element of crime charged); \r\n  State v. Bethea, 126 S.C. 497, 120 S.E. 239 (1923) (to convict of grand \r\n  larceny there must be proof property was worth $20 or more).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, grand larceny cannot be a lesser-included offense \r\n  of armed robbery because the offense of armed robbery does not include the element \r\n  that the value of the goods taken must exceed $1,000. See Hope v. \r\n  State, supra (if lesser offense includes element which is not included \r\n  in greater offense, then lesser offense is not included in greater offense).\r\n\r\n The indictments in this case charge armed robbery, but \r\n  also appear to describe grand larceny. (5) However, \r\n  the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence respondents on \r\n  grand larceny because the indictments only specifically charged armed robbery, \r\n  which does not include all the elements of grand larceny. See State \r\n  v. Summers, 276 S.C. 11, 274 S.E.2d 427 (1981) (conviction may be had of \r\n  an offense different from the one specifically charged only when such offense \r\n  is essential element of that charged and only when greater offense charged includes \r\n  all legal and factual elements of lesser offense), overruled in part on \r\n  other grounds by State v. McFadden, 342 S.C. 629, 539 S.E.2d 387 \r\n  (2000); State v. Fennell, 263 S.C. 216, 209 S.E.2d 433 (1974) (same). \r\n  See also State v. Owens, supra (court does not have \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to convict defendant unless offense is lesser-included \r\n  offense of crime charged in indictment).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict respondents of grand larceny, the Court of\r\nAppeals' decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT (dissenting):  I respectfully dissent.  In my opinion, grand larceny is a lesser included offense of armed\r\nrobbery and, therefore, the trial judge had subject matter jurisdiction to convict respondents of grand larceny.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction to convict \r\n  a defendant of an offense if 1) there is an indictment which sufficiently states \r\n  the offense, 2) the defendant waives presentment, or 3) the offense is a lesser \r\n  included offense of the crime charged in the indictment. State v. Primus, \r\n  349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103 (2002). The test for determining whether when an \r\n  offense is a lesser included offense of another is whether the greater of the \r\n  two offenses includes all the elements of the lesser offense. Id. If \r\n  the lesser offense includes an element which is not included in the greater \r\n  offense, then the lesser offense is not included in the greater offense. Id. \r\n  \r\n\r\nRobbery is the felonious taking and carrying away of the \r\n  goods of another against the will or without consent of the other with force. \r\n  State v. Scipio, 283 S.C. 124, 322 S.E.2d 15 (1984). Armed robbery occurs \r\n  when a person commits robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. Id. Robbery \r\n  is a lesser included offense of armed robbery. Id. \r\n\r\nLarceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of the \r\n  goods of another against the will or without the consent of the other. State \r\n  v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 260 S.E.2d 719 (1979); State v. Sweat, 221 \r\n  S.C. 270, 70 S.E.2d 234 (1952). See W. McAninch &amp; W. Fairey, The \r\n  Criminal Law of South Carolina 246 (1995) (\"South Carolina continues to \r\n  use the standard common law definition of larceny. . .\").\r\n\r\nRelying on prior opinions which state value is an element \r\n  of grand larceny, (6) the majority concludes \r\n  grand larceny is not a lesser included offense of robbery because value is not \r\n  an element of robbery. None of the cited cases, however, compared the elements \r\n  of robbery with grand larceny. (7) \r\nInstead, the Court has already determined that grand larceny \r\n  is a lesser included offense of robbery. In Young v. State, 259 S.C. \r\n  383, 386, 192 S.E.2d 212, 214 (1972), the Court noted robbery is \"basically \r\n  larceny compounded or aggravated by force used in the taking of property from \r\n  the person or in the presence of another\" and that \"larceny is included in the \r\n  charge of robbery.\" Accordingly, \". . . a verdict finding [the defendant] guilty \r\n  of robbery, of necessity, carrie[s] with it a finding that he was guilty of \r\n  larceny.\" Id. In State v. Lawson, 279 S.C. 266, 305 S.E.2d 249 \r\n  (1983), the Court specifically held grand larceny is a lesser included offense \r\n  of robbery.  See State v. Brown, supra  (larceny is lesser included offense \r\n  of robbery); State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989) (petit \r\n  larceny is lesser included offense of robbery).\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion the terms \"grand\" and \"petit\" are not elements \r\n  of either grand or petit larceny, but rather distinguish the two sub-categories \r\n  of the crime of larceny for sentencing purposes. While the determination of \r\n  whether a particular larceny is \"grand\" or \"petit\" is a matter for the trier \r\n  of fact, \"grand\" or \"petit\" larceny do not constitute unique substantive crimes \r\n  but rather sub-categories of the crime of larceny. See W. McAninch and \r\n  W. Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina, supra (\"The basic \r\n  South Carolina larceny statute does very little to define the offense; the statute \r\n  is primarily concerned with providing penalties for the different categories \r\n  of the offense, depending on the value of the property taken.\").\r\n\r\nThe majority's conclusion will permit the trial court to \r\n  convict and punish a defendant for both robbery and larceny arising out of the \r\n  same act without violating double jeopardy. This holding contravenes the precedent \r\n  of State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989), State v. \r\n  Harkness, 288 S.C. 136, 341 S.E.2d 631 (1986), and  State v. Lawson, \r\n  supra. Moreover, it defies common sense because larceny is subsumed in the \r\n  offense of robbery; larceny is robbery accomplished without force.  See State \r\n  v. Brown, supra.\r\n\r\nBecause it is my opinion grand larceny is a lesser included offense of armed robbery, I would reverse the Court of Appeals'\r\ndecision and reinstate respondents' grand larceny convictions.\r\n\r\n1.   Respondent \r\n  Timothy Kirby was also convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. \r\n  That conviction was not challenged on appeal. \r\n2. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30(B) (Supp. 2001), as amended, provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLarceny of goods, chattels, instruments, or other personalty valued in excess of one thousand dollars is grand larceny.  Upon\r\nconviction, the person is guilty of a felony and must be fined in the discretion of the court or imprisoned not more than:\r\n\r\n(1) five years if the value of the personalty is more than one thousand dollars but less than five thousand dollars;\r\n\r\n(2) ten years if the value of the personalty is five thousand dollars or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Previously, the value of goods for grand larceny was $200 or more.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30 (1985).  Now, the statute\r\nsets the value of goods for petit larceny at $1,000 or less and for grand larceny at more than $1,000.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30\r\n(Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\n4. Further, robbery has been found to \r\n  be a lesser-included offense of armed robbery. State v. Scipio, supra \r\n  (citing State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120 (1979)). However, \r\n  we have not directly answered the question of whether grand larceny is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of armed robbery. Cf. State v. Pressley, 288 S.C. 128, \r\n  132, 341 S.E.2d 626, 628 (1986) (stated unnecessary to decide whether grand \r\n  larceny is lesser-included offense of armed robbery given error would be harmless).\r\n5. Each indictment \r\n  charged each respondent with \"ARMED ROBBERY 16-11-330(A)\" and stated that they \r\n\r\n  did in Marlboro County on or about November 02, 1997, along with a co-defendant while armed\r\nwith a deadly weapon, feloniously take from the person or presence of the victim, Blvd Express, by\r\nmeans of force or intimidation goods or monies of said victim, such goods or monies being\r\ndescribed as follows:  $1192.00 and two pistols.\r\n\r\n6. See Johnson \r\n  v. State, 319 S.C. 62, 459 S.E.2d 840 (1995), State v. Ates, 297 \r\n  S.C. 316, 377 S.E.2d 98 (1989), State v. Moultrie, 283 S.C. 352, 322 \r\n  S.E.2d 663 (1984), State v. Humphery, 276 S.C. 42, 274 S.E.2d 918 (1981), \r\n  State v. Smith, 274 S.C. 622, 266 S.E.2d 422 (1980), State v. Bethea, \r\n  126 S.C. 497, 120 S.E. 239 (1923).  \r\n7. Moreover, \r\n  commentators recognize value is not an element of the crime of larceny. W. McAninch \r\n  &amp; W.

Dudek, of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General\r\nAllen Bullard, and Assistant Attorney General Douglas E. Leadbitter, all of Columbia, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We consolidated these cases because they involve the same underlying guilty pleas.  We granted the\r\npetitions for writs of certiorari to determine whether grand larceny is a lesser-included offense of armed robbery, whether\r\npetitioner's plea to murder was knowingly and voluntarily entered, and whether the plea court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on\r\nthe murder indictment.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nPetitioner was indicted for murder, armed robbery, accessory before the fact, and possession of a weapon during a violent crime. \r\nIn 1988, he pled guilty to murder and grand larceny and was sentenced to life imprisonment and a concurrent ten-year sentence,\r\nrespectively.  No direct appeal was taken.\r\n\r\nAfter a hearing on petitioner's post-conviction relief (PCR) action, the PCR court ruled the plea court did not have subject matter\r\njurisdiction to accept petitioner's plea to grand larceny because grand larceny is not a lesser-included offense of armed robbery. \r\nHis conviction for grand larceny was vacated.  The PCR court denied petitioner's claim that his entire guilty plea was rendered\r\nunknowing and involuntary because the plea court lacked jurisdiction to accept his plea to grand larceny.\r\n\r\nPetitioner also filed for a writ of habeas corpus before a different judge.  After a hearing, the habeas court denied petitioner's\r\nclaim that the plea court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept his plea to murder due to an insufficient indictment.\r\n\r\nJohnson (1) petitions \r\n  were filed in both the PCR and the habeas cases. The Court granted \r\n  the petitions for a writ of certiorari in both cases after the Johnson \r\n  issues in the PCR case had been briefed.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Whether the PCR court erred by finding grand larceny is not a lesser-included offense of armed robbery?\r\n\r\nII. If the plea court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to accept petitioner's plea to grand larceny, was petitioner's plea to\r\nmurder knowingly and voluntarily entered?\r\n\r\nIII. Whether the plea court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on the murder indictment since the indictment omitted the words\r\n\"wilfully\" and \"feloniously?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe circuit court does not have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict a defendant of an offense unless there is an indictment which sufficiently \r\n  states the offense, the defendant waives presentment, or the offense is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of the crime charged in the indictment. State v. Owens, 346 S.C. \r\n  637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001). The test for determining when an offense is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of another is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the \r\n  elements of the lesser offense. State v. McFadden, 342 S.C. 629, 539 \r\n  S.E.2d 387 (2000). If the lesser offense includes an element which is not included \r\n  in the greater offense, then the lesser offense is not included in the greater \r\n  offense. Hope v. State, 328 S.C. 78, 492 S.E.2d 76 (1997).\r\n\r\nLarceny involves the taking and carrying away of the goods \r\n  of another, which must be accomplished against the will or without the consent \r\n  of the other. State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 260 S.E.2d 719 (1979). Specifically, \r\n  grand larceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of the goods of another, \r\n  where the value exceeds $200. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30 (1985) \r\n  (stating petit larceny involves stolen goods whose value is less than $200); \r\n  State v. Moultrie, 283 S.C. 352, 322 S.E.2d 663 (1984) (grand larceny \r\n  is felonious taking and carrying away of goods of another, where value exceeds \r\n  $200). (2) Robbery is defined as the felonious \r\n  or unlawful taking of money, goods, or other personal property of any value \r\n  from the person of another or in his presence by violence or by putting such \r\n  person in fear. State v. Drayton, 293 S.C. 417, 361 S.E.2d 329 (1987), \r\n  cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1079, 108 S.Ct. 1060, 98 L.Ed.2d 1021 (1988). \r\n  Armed robbery occurs when a person commits robbery while armed with a deadly \r\n  weapon. Id.\r\n\r\nLarceny has been found to be a lesser-included offense of \r\n  robbery by this Court on several occasions. See State v. Austin, \r\n  299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989) (petit larceny is lesser-included of strong \r\n  armed robbery); State v. Harkness, 288 S.C. 136, 341 S.E.2d 631 (1986) \r\n  (petit larceny is lesser of robbery); State v. Lawson, 279 S.C. 266, \r\n  305 S.E.2d 249 (1983) (grand larceny is lesser-included of robbery); State \r\n  v. Brown, supra (larceny, without indicating whether petit or grand, \r\n  is lesser of robbery); Young v. State, 259 S.C. 383, 192 S.E.2d 212 (1972) \r\n  (grand larceny is lesser-included of robbery). See also State v. \r\n  Ziegler, 274 S.C. 6, 260 S.E.2d 182 (1979) (in dicta, Court stated one may \r\n  be guilty of armed robbery which involves grand larceny or petit larceny). \r\n  (3) \r\n\r\nWe now overrule the cases of State v. Lawson, Young \r\n  v. State, and State v. Ziegler to the extent they found grand larceny \r\n  to be a lesser-included offense of robbery. It is well-settled that the monetary \r\n  value of the goods taken is an element of the offense of grand larceny. See \r\n  Johnson v. State, 319 S.C. 62, 459 S.E.2d 840 (1995) (grand larceny involved \r\n  taking and carrying away of goods valued at $200 or more; value is element of \r\n  grand larceny offense); State v. Ates, 297 S.C. 316, 318, 377 S.E.2d \r\n  98, 99, n.1 (1989) (in grand larceny prosecution, value is critical element; \r\n  it is State's burden to prove value of stolen goods exceeds $200); State \r\n  v. Moultrie, supra (defining grand larceny as felonious taking \r\n  and carrying away of goods of another, where value exceeds $200); State v. \r\n  Humphery, 276 S.C. 42, 274 S.E.2d 918 (1981) (trial court did not abuse \r\n  discretion in allowing State to reopen case and prove value an essential element \r\n  of grand larceny); State v. Smith, 274 S.C. 622, 266 S.E.2d 422 (1980) \r\n  (grand larceny is felony which includes all elements of lesser offense of petit \r\n  larceny except that grand larceny involves theft of goods valued at fifty dollars \r\n  or more); State v. Bethea, 126 S.C. 497, 120 S.E. 239 (1923) (to convict \r\n  of grand larceny there must be proof property was worth $20 or more). Grand \r\n  larceny cannot be a lesser-included offense of armed robbery because the offense \r\n  of armed robbery does not include the element that the value of the goods taken \r\n  must exceed a certain amount. See Hope v. State, supra \r\n  (if lesser offense includes element which is not included in greater offense, \r\n  then lesser offense is not included in greater offense).\r\n\r\nConsequently, the PCR court properly vacated petitioner's conviction for grand larceny.\r\n\r\nThe indictment in this case charges the crime of armed robbery \r\n  and appears to describe the crime of grand larceny. (4) \r\n  However, the plea court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence petitioner \r\n  for grand larceny because the indictment specifically charged armed robbery, \r\n  which does not include all the elements of grand larceny. See State \r\n  v. Summers, 276 S.C. 11, 274 S.E.2d 427 (1981) (conviction may be had of \r\n  offense different from one specifically charged only when such offense is essential \r\n  element of that charged and only when greater offense charged includes all legal \r\n  and factual elements of lesser offense), overruled in part on other grounds \r\n  by State v. McFadden, 342 S.C. 629, 539 S.E.2d 387 (2000); State \r\n  v. Fennell, 263 S.C. 216, 209 S.E.2d 433 (1974) (same). See also \r\n  State v. Owens, supra (court does not have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict defendant unless offense is lesser-included offense of crime charged \r\n  in indictment).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the plea court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to accept petitioner's plea of guilty to grand larceny, the PCR \r\n  court properly vacated petitioner's grand larceny conviction.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues the PCR court erred by finding his plea \r\n  to murder was knowingly and voluntarily entered since the murder and grand larceny \r\n  pleas were entered pursuant to a \"package deal.\"\r\n\r\nPetitioner was indicted for murder, armed robbery, accessory \r\n  before the fact, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent \r\n  crime. He pled guilty to murder and grand larceny.\r\n\r\nThe solicitor recommended a sentence of life with eligibility \r\n  for parole in twenty years on the murder charge with the grand larceny sentence \r\n  to run concurrently. The plea court asked petitioner whether he understood that \r\n  the court did not have to accept the solicitor's recommendation, and petitioner \r\n  indicated he so understood and still wished to plead guilty. The plea court \r\n  asked petitioner whether his attorneys had done everything he asked of them; \r\n  whether he was pleading guilty of his own free will and accord; whether he was \r\n  guilty; and whether he understood that he was giving up his constitutional rights \r\n  to remain silent and to a jury trial. Petitioner answered yes to these questions. \r\n  Petitioner answered no when the plea court asked if anyone had promised him \r\n  anything or threatened him to acquire his guilty plea, and when he was asked \r\n  if he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The court accepted the recommendation \r\n  and sentenced petitioner accordingly.\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, arguments were heard but petitioner did \r\nnot present any testimony. The court denied petitioner's claim that his entire \r\nguilty plea was rendered unknowing and involuntary by the trial court's lack of \r\njurisdiction to accept his plea to grand larceny. The PCR court stated the evidence \r\nrevealed that petitioner entered his guilty plea freely, knowingly, intelligently, \r\nand voluntarily. The court found his claims to the contrary not credible, particularly \r\nwhere the grand larceny conviction was vacated due to a legal technicality. \r\nA guilty plea may not be accepted unless it is voluntary \r\n  and entered into with an understanding of the nature and consequences of the \r\n  charge and plea. A plea is properly accepted if the record establishes it was \r\n  voluntarily and knowingly made. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. \r\n  1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  773 (1998); Dover v. State, 304 S.C. 433, 405 S.E.2d 391 (1991).\r\n\r\nA defendant who enters a plea on the advice of counsel may \r\n  attack the voluntary and intelligent character of a plea only by showing that \r\n  counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness \r\n  and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the \r\n  defendant would not have pled guilty but would have insisted on going to trial. \r\n  Roscoe v. State, 345 S.C. 16, 546 S.E.2d 417 (2001). Thus, an applicant \r\n  must show both error and prejudice to win relief in a PCR proceeding. Id. \r\n  In Roscoe, the Court noted, \"[a]lthough we have consistently held a defendant \r\n  must have a full understanding of the consequences of his plea and of the charges \r\n  against him, the defendant must also demonstrate prejudice to be entitled to \r\n  relief on PCR.\" Roscoe v. State, 345 S.C. at 20, 546 S.E.2d at 419, n.6 \r\n  (internal citations omitted).\r\n\r\nPetitioner has not framed this issue in the context of ineffective \r\n  assistance of counsel and has not made a showing of prejudice in this case. \r\n  Regardless, we note the PCR court correctly concluded the guilty plea to murder \r\n  was entered into knowingly and voluntarily. Petitioner was properly advised \r\n  and sentenced on the murder charge. Further, petitioner failed to show he was \r\n  induced to plead guilty or that he would have not pled guilty to murder but \r\n  for the grand larceny charge. See, e.g., Roscoe v. State, \r\n  supra (Court denied Roscoe's claim that all of his pleas were \r\n  affected by erroneous advice concerning armed robbery charge; found Roscoe was \r\n  properly advised and sentenced on kidnapping and burglary charges and had failed \r\n  to demonstrate pleas to those offenses were in any way affected by mis-advice \r\n  concerning armed robbery charge).\r\n\r\nConsequently, the PCR court's finding that petitioner knowingly \r\n  and voluntarily entered a guilty plea to murder is affirmed.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues the plea court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  on the murder indictment since the indictment omitted the words \"willfully\" \r\n  and \"feloniously.\"\r\n\r\nThe indictment charged:\r\n\r\nCOUNT ONE - MURDER\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    That one MARCUS A. JOSEPH, one BARBARA ANN MAYERS and one \r\n      ERROL MAYERS did in Clarendon County on or about March 18, 1987, with malice \r\n      aforethought, kill one Alfred Cole by means of shooting him with a Colt \r\n      .357 Magnum Pistol, and that the said Alfred Cole did die in Clarendon County \r\n      as a proximate result thereof on or about March 18, 1987.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAt the habeas corpus hearing, petitioner claimed \r\n  the murder indictment failed to state the crime had been committed \"wilfully\" \r\n  and \"feloniously.\" The habeas court held petitioner was not entitled \r\n  to relief because the indictment was sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  on the plea court. \r\n\r\nThe circuit court does not have subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict a defendant of an offense unless there is an indictment which sufficiently \r\n  states the offense, the defendant waives presentment, or the offense is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of the crime charged in the indictment. State v. Owens, supra.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-30 (1985) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Every indictment for murder shall be deemed and adjudged \r\n    sufficient and good in law which, in addition to setting forth the time and \r\n    place, together with a plain statement, divested of all useless phraseology, \r\n    of the manner in which the death of the deceased was caused, charges the defendant \r\n    did feloniously, wilfully and of his malice aforethought kill and murder the \r\n    deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn indictment for murder is sufficient \"if the offense is \r\n  stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know \r\n  what judgment to pronounce, the defendant to know what he is called upon to \r\n  answer, and if an acquittal or a conviction thereon may be pleaded as a bar \r\n  to any subsequent prosecution.\" State v. Owens, supra (citing \r\n  State v. Owens, 293 S.C. 161, 165, 359 S.E.2d 275, 277 (1987); \r\n  (5) State v. Munn, 292 S.C. 497, 357 S.E.2d 461 (1987) (test \r\n  of sufficiency of indictment is whether it contains necessary elements of offense \r\n  intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises defendant of what he must be \r\n  prepared to defend)).\r\n\r\nThe murder indictment was sufficient to confer subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction on the plea court. As mentioned in Â§ 17-19-30, the indictment set \r\n  forth the time (\"on or about March 18, 1987\") and place (\"in Clarendon County\") \r\n  of the crime, and stated the manner in which the death of the deceased was caused \r\n  (\"kill one Alfred Cole by means of shooting him with a Colt .357 Magnum Pistol\"). \r\n  While the indictment did not state petitioner \"feloniously\" and \"wilfully\" committed \r\n  the murder, the indictment included the elements of murder by stating petitioner \r\n  killed another with \"malice aforethought.\" See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 \r\n  (1985) (murder is \"killing of any person with malice aforethought, either express \r\n  or implied\"). The offense of murder was stated with sufficient certainty and \r\n  particularity in the indictment such that the plea court knew what judgment \r\n  to pronounce and petitioner knew what he was being called upon to answer. See \r\n  State v. Owens, supra.\r\n\r\nWhile Â§ 17-19-30 indicates that an indictment for murder \r\n  will be deemed sufficient which charges the defendant did \"feloniously, wilfully \r\n  . . . kill and murder the deceased,\" we will not construe this statutory language \r\n  such that it leads to an absurd result. See State ex rel. McLeod \r\n  v. Montgomery, 244 S.C. 308, 136 S.E.2d 778 (1964) (courts will reject ordinary \r\n  meaning of statutory language when to accept it would lead to result so absurd \r\n  that it could not possibly have been intended by Legislature, or would defeat \r\n  plain legislative intention; and if possible will construe statute so as to \r\n  escape absurdity and carry intention into effect). Here, the word \"feloniously\" \r\n  is encompassed in the word \"murder\" because murder is a felony. Further, the \r\n  word \"wilfully\" is encompassed in the word \"malice\" because malice is \"the intentional \r\n  doing of a wrongful act toward another without legal justification or excuse.\" \r\n  State v. Heyward, 197 S.C. 371, 375, 15 S.E.2d 669, 671 (1941) (emphasis \r\n  added). \"Wilfully\" and \"intentionally\" are synonymous terms.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the General Assembly did not intend to burden \r\n  the writing of murder indictments by requiring surplus words when their obvious \r\n  intent in promulgating Â§ 17-19-30 was to simplify indictments. See \r\n  State v. Baucom, 340 S.C. 339, 531 S.E.2d 922 (2000) (all rules of statutory \r\n  construction are subservient to rule that legislative intent must prevail if \r\n  can be reasonably discovered in language used, and that language must be construed \r\n  in light of intended purpose of statute); Strother v. Lexington County Recreation \r\n  Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998) (cardinal rule of statutory construction \r\n  is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent); State v. Rector, \r\n  158 S.C. 212, 155 S.E. 385 (1930) (General Assembly has sought to simplify indictments \r\n  in criminal cases and to do away with useless phraseology). Section 17-19-30 \r\n  is a procedural statute not intended to alter the elements of the offense of \r\n  murder.\r\n\r\nWe find the indictment was sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction because it informed petitioner of the elements of murder.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find that grand larceny is not a lesser-included offense of armed robbery, that petitioner entered his plea to murder knowingly\r\nand voluntarily, and that the plea court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction on the murder indictment.  Accordingly, the decisions\r\nof the PCR and habeas courts are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J. and WALLER, J., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.  BURNETT, J., concurring\r\nand dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur but write separately \r\n  because I would reach the same result as the majority, although by a different \r\n  approach. I agree that the failure to allege in the indictment that the murder \r\n  was committed \"feloniously, wilfully, and of [the petitioner's] \r\n  malice aforethought\" does not create a subject matter jurisdiction defect.  \r\n  See State v. Rector, 158 S.C. 212, 155 S.E. 385 (1930)(purpose of the 1887 \r\n  revisions to criminal procedure, which include the statute currently codified \r\n  at S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-19-30, was to simplify indictments);  see also State \r\n  v. Cheathwood, 2 Hill (20 S.C.L.) 459(1834)(no jurisdictional defect where \r\n  elements of offense charged in indictment using \"words which are either wholly \r\n  synonymous or much of the same meaning\").\r\n\r\n I further agree that grand larceny is not a lesser-included \r\n  offense of armed robbery because it contains an element (value of goods taken) \r\n  that is not an element of the purported greater offense.  See State v. Elliot, \r\n  346 S.C. 603, 552 S.E.2d 727 (2001)(test for lesser-included offense). As the \r\n  majority points out, the \"armed robbery\" count here alleges all the elements \r\n  of both armed robbery and grand larceny. It thus conferred jurisdiction over \r\n  both offenses, and petitioner waived any right to object to this jumbling when \r\n  he failed to object prior to the entry of his plea.  Cf. State v. Hutto, \r\n  252 S.C. 36, 165 S.E.2d 72 (1968)(jumbling objection waived pursuant to S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 when not raised before jury sworn). However, since the \r\n  post-conviction relief judge vacated petitioner's grand larceny plea, and since \r\n  the State did not appeal that order, the law of the case is that petitioner's \r\n  grand larceny conviction is vacated.  See, e.g., ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, \r\n  L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 489 S.E.2d 470 (1997)(unappealed \r\n  ruling, whether correct or not, is law of the case).\r\n\r\nI agree that petitioner's murder conviction stands, and that his grand larceny conviction falls.  I agree that this result does not require\r\na new proceeding on the murder charge, despite the fact that both pleas were the result of a single bargain, because I believe, in\r\nfact, that each plea was independently valid.  I therefore concur in the majority's decision to affirm the appealed orders.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT (concurring/dissenting):  I  agree petitioner knowingly and voluntarily entered a guilty plea to murder and\r\nthe murder indictment was sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction.  I disagree grand larceny is not a lesser included offense of\r\narmed robbery.  In my opinion, grand larceny is a lesser included offense of armed robbery and, therefore, the trial judge had\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction to accept petitioner's guilty plea to grand larceny.  Accordingly, I would reverse the post-conviction\r\nrelief (PCR) judge's order.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction to convict \r\n  a defendant of an offense if 1) there is an indictment which sufficiently states \r\n  the offense, 2) the defendant waives presentment, or 3) the offense is a lesser \r\n  included offense of the crime charged in the indictment. State v. Primus, \r\n  349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103 (2002). The test for determining when an offense \r\n  is a lesser included offense of another is whether the greater of the two offenses \r\n  includes all the elements of the lesser offense. Id. If the lesser offense \r\n  includes an element which is not included in the greater offense, then the lesser \r\n  offense is not included in the greater offense. Id. \r\n\r\nRobbery is the felonious taking and carrying away of the \r\n  goods of another against the will or without consent of the other with force. \r\n  State v. Scipio, 283 S.C. 124, 322 S.E.2d 15 (1984). Armed robbery occurs \r\n  when a person commits robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. Id. Robbery \r\n  is a lesser included offense of armed robbery. Id. \r\n\r\nLarceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of the \r\n  goods of another against the will or without the consent of the other. State \r\n  v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 260 S.E.2d 719 (1979); State v. Sweat, 221 \r\n  S.C. 270, 70 S.E.2d 234 (1952). See W. McAninch &amp; W. Fairey, The \r\n  Criminal Law of South Carolina 246 (1995) (\"South Carolina continues to \r\n  use the standard common law definition of larceny. . .\").\r\n\r\nRelying on prior opinions which state value is an element \r\n  of grand larceny, (6) the majority concludes \r\n  grand larceny is not a lesser included offense of robbery because value is not \r\n  an element of robbery. None of the cited cases, however, compared the elements \r\n  of robbery with grand larceny. (7) \r\nInstead, the Court has already determined that grand larceny \r\n  is a lesser included offense of robbery. In Young v. State, 259 S.C. \r\n  383, 386, 192 S.E.2d 212, 214 (1972), the Court noted robbery is \"basically \r\n  larceny compounded or aggravated by force used in the taking of property from \r\n  the person or in the presence of another\" and that \"larceny is included in the \r\n  charge of robbery.\" Accordingly, \". . . a verdict finding [the defendant] guilty \r\n  of robbery, of necessity, carrie[s] with it a finding that he was guilty of \r\n  larceny.\" Id. In State v. Lawson, 279 S.C. 266, 305 S.E.2d 249 \r\n  (1983), the Court specifically held grand larceny is a lesser included offense \r\n  of robbery.  See State v. Brown, supra  (larceny is lesser included offense \r\n  of robbery); State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989) (petit \r\n  larceny is lesser included offense of robbery).\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion the terms \"grand\" and \"petit\" are not elements \r\n  of either grand or petit larceny, but rather distinguish the two sub-categories \r\n  of the crime of larceny for sentencing purposes. While the determination of \r\n  whether a particular larceny is \"grand\" or \"petit\" is a matter for the trier \r\n  of fact, \"grand\" or \"petit\" larceny do not constitute unique substantive crimes \r\n  but rather sub-categories of the crime of larceny. See W. McAninch and \r\n  W. Fairey, The Criminal Law of South Carolina, supra (\"The basic \r\n  South Carolina larceny statute does very little to define the offense; the statute \r\n  is primarily concerned with providing penalties for the different categories \r\n  of the offense, depending on the value of the property taken.\").\r\n\r\nThe majority's conclusion will permit the trial court to \r\n  convict and punish a defendant for both robbery and larceny arising out of the \r\n  same act without violating double jeopardy. This holding contravenes the precedent \r\n  of State v. Austin, 299 S.C. 456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989), State v. \r\n  Harkness, 288 S.C. 136, 341 S.E.2d 631 (1986), and  State v. Lawson, \r\n  supra. Moreover, the result is untenable because larceny is subsumed in \r\n  the offense of robbery; larceny is robbery accomplished without force.  See \r\n  State v. Brown, supra.\r\n\r\nBecause it is my opinion grand larceny is a lesser included offense of armed robbery, I would reverse the order of the PCR judge.\r\n\r\n1. Johnson v. State, 294 S.C. \r\n  310, 364 S.E.2d 201 (1988) (approving the withdrawal of counsel in meritless \r\n  appeals of PCR actions by following a certain procedure). \r\n2. Petitioner pled guilty in 1988 prior to the 1993 amendment that distinguished petit and grand larceny and increased the dollar\r\namount of the value of goods stolen, therefore, the value of goods for grand larceny at the time petitioner pled guilty was $200 or\r\nmore.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-30 (1985).  Now, grand larceny is the larceny of goods valued in excess of $1,000.  S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 16-13-30 (Supp. 2001).\r\n3. Further, robbery has been found to \r\n  be a lesser-included offense of armed robbery. State v. Scipio, 283 S.C. \r\n  124, 322 S.E.2d 15 (1984) (citing State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d \r\n  120 (1979)). However, we have not directly answered the question of whether \r\n  grand larceny is a lesser-included offense of armed robbery. Cf. State \r\n  v. Pressley, 288 S.C. 128, 132, 341 S.E.2d 626, 628 (1986) (stated unnecessary \r\n  to decide whether grand larceny is lesser-included offense of armed robbery \r\n  given error would be harmless).\r\n4.The indictment \r\n  charged: \r\nCOUNT TWO - ARMED ROBBERY\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    That one MARCUS A.

On October 16, 1998,\r\nAppellant attempted to pull over a speeding vehicle by turning on his blue lights, wig-wags, and emergency flashers.  The offending\r\ndriver did not pull over and a chase ensued.  As he approached the North Charleston city limits, Appellant advised his dispatcher to\r\nnotify the North Charleston Police Department of the pursuit, but did not request any assistance.  Although Appellant did not\r\nrequest it, officers from the North Charleston police department and from the Charleston County Sheriff's Department joined in the\r\nchase behind Appellant. \r\n\r\nAt some point, the offending vehicle began slowing down and eventually came to a complete stop.  Before Appellant's cruiser\r\nreached a complete stop, the Sheriff's Department's cruiser, driven by Deputy William J. Collins, hit Appellant from behind. \r\nAppellant suffered injuries as a result. \r\n\r\nAppellant received workers' compensation benefits, including an award of permanent disability, and is no longer employed as a\r\nhighway patrolman.  Appellant sued the Charleston County Sheriff's Department (amended to Al Cannon, Jr., in his capacity as\r\nSheriff).  Respondent moved for summary judgment and Appellant moved for partial summary judgment.  Special Circuit Court\r\nJudge Roger M. Young granted Respondent's motion for summary judgment and denied Appellant's motion for partial summary\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nAppellant appeals the following issue:\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the trial judge err in granting summary judgment for Respondent on grounds that the Fireman's Rule (1) barred Appellant's suit? \r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the trial judge erred in finding that South Carolina recognizes the Fireman's Rule, and that it applied to bar\r\nAppellant's suit.  We agree.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether summary judgment is proper, this Court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\nparty.  Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 543 S.E.2d 563 (Ct. App. 2001).  Summary judgment is\r\nappropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Id.\r\n(citing City of Columbia v. ACLU of South Carolina, 323 S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996)). \r\n\r\nThis Court has considered the viability of the Fireman's Rule in South Carolina very recently.  In Jeffrey Minnich v. Med-Waste,\r\nInc., and Incendere, Inc., Op. No. 25468 (S. C. Sup. Ct. filed May 20, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 34) (2), we\r\naccepted the following certified question from the United States District Court:\r\n\r\nDoes the Fireman's Rule bar an emergency professional, such as a firefighter, police officer, or public safety officer, who is injured\r\nas a result of performing his or her duties, from recovering tort based damages from the party whose negligence caused the injury-causing event?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Justice Pleicones, writing for the majority, expressed the holding as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has never recognized the firefighter's rule, and we find it is not part of this state's common law.  (citations omitted). \r\nIn our view, the tort law of this state adequately addresses negligence claims brought against non-employer tortfeasors arising out of\r\ninjuries incurred by firefighters and police officers during the discharge of their duties.  We are not persuaded by any of those courts\r\nthat recognize the firefighter's rule.  The more sound public policy - and the one we adopt - is to decline to promulgate a rule\r\nsingling out police officers and firefighters for discriminatory treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this Court's recent decision in Minnich that the Fireman's Rule is not recognized in South Carolina.  Accordingly,\r\nthe trial judge in this case erred to the extent he based his ruling on the Fireman's Rule. (3)  The trial judge found Appellant's action\r\nwas precluded under the Fireman's Rule, but he made some conclusions that cloud his ruling and necessitate further analysis.  In\r\npart, the order states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It then follows that the fireman's rule is still good \r\n    law in South Carolina despite the adoption of the comparative negligence system \r\n    which bars assumption of the risk as a complete defense. Following this reasoning \r\n    to its logical conclusion, the fireman's rule does not preclude the \r\n    plaintiff in this case from recovering for his injuries because he assumed \r\n    the risks which caused his own negligence to exceed that of the defendant. \r\n    If that were the theoretical basis it would be a jury's duty to assess the \r\n    degree of fault. Rather, the fireman's rule precludes the plaintiff \r\n    from recovering in this case because he cannot show, as a matter of law, that \r\n    the defendant owed him a duty of care. Since the defendant's duty of care \r\n    was only to the general public, he does not owe a duty of care to his fellow \r\n    officers, and thus cannot be found negligent as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n(citations omitted).  In finding that Respondent did not owe a duty to Appellant, the trial judge cited several cases addressing the\r\n\"public duty rule\" for support. (4)  The parties did not address the application of the public duty rule in the memoranda they submitted\r\nto the trial court.  In our opinion, the trial judge's indirect reference to the public duty rule and conclusion that Respondent did not\r\nowe Appellant any duty were misplaced. \r\n\r\nIn Arthurs v. Aiken County, this Court considered the public duty rule and its interplay with the South Carolina Tort Claims Act\r\n(Tort Claims Act\"). (5)  346 S.C. 97, 551 S.E.2d 579 (2001).  Arthurs confirmed the continuing viability of the public duty rule and\r\nits compatibility with the Tort Claims Act, but clarified when the public duty rule is properly raised.  Id.  In this Court's words,\r\n\"[w]hen, and only when, the plaintiff relies upon a statute as creating the duty does a doctrine known as the 'public duty rule' come\r\ninto play.\"  Id. at 103, 551 S.E.2d at 582 (emphasis added).  In other words, when the plaintiff's negligence claim is founded upon\r\na government entity's statutorily created duty, the question of \"whether that duty will support the claim should be analyzed under the\r\nrule.  On the other hand, where the duty relied upon is based upon the common law, . . . then the existence of that duty is analyzed\r\nas it would be were the defendant a private entity.\"  Id. at 105, 551 S.E.2d at 583 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nAppellant in this case did not allege a violation of a statutory duty as the basis for his negligence claim.  Rather, Appellant's\r\nallegations centered around violation of duties of care created by the common law, such as exercising reasonable caution. \r\nGenerally, the public duty rule is invoked in cases where the duty is created by statute and would not otherwise exist.  See Arthurs\r\n(alleging breach of duty created by criminal domestic violence statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-10 to -80 (Supp. 1994)); Tanner\r\nv. Florence County Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 521 S.E.2d 153 (1999) (alleging breach of duty created by statutory provision\r\nrequiring notice to delinquent taxpayers, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-140 (Supp. 1998)).  The duty to exercise reasonable care when\r\noperating a motor vehicle is not statutory; it is owed from all individuals to all other individuals.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-760\r\n(A) &amp; (D) (Supp. 2002).  Therefore, we find the public duty rule is not implicated in this case.    \r\n\r\nAlthough the trial judge did not address whether Respondent was immune from suit under the Tort Claims Act in his order, we note\r\nthat  it would not bar Appellant's suit.  The Tort Claims Act abrogated South Carolina's sovereign immunity, making this state's\r\ngovernmental entities liable for their torts \"in the same manner and to the same extent as . . .  private individual[s] . . . , subject to the\r\nlimitations upon liability and damages, contained herein.\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40.  Section 15-78-60 contains specific\r\nexceptions to the waiver of immunity, and the circumstances presented in this case are not included. (6)  Appellant's action against\r\nRespondent does not fall within any of the listed exemptions.  Therefore, Respondent is not immune from suit.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the Fireman's Rule is not recognized in South Carolina, and, therefore, that the trial court erred in\r\nfinding it barred Respondent's suit.  Accordingly, we REVERSE the grant of summary judgment for Respondent and REMAND\r\nfor further proceedings in accord with this opinion.  \r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT , JJ., and Acting Justice George T. Gregory, Jr., concur.\r\n1. The Fireman's Rule is referred to interchangeably as the Firefighter's Rule or the Rescuer's Rule.\r\n2. Minnich was employed by the Medical University of South Carolina (\"MUSC\") as a public safety officer.  Minnich routinely\r\nassisted in loading medical waste onto a tractor trailer owned by Med-Waste, Inc. parked at MUSC, and was injured one day\r\nwhen he had to jump inside the truck to prevent it from rolling into a public street.\r\n\r\n3. Further, many jurisdictions that recognize the Fireman's Rule would find it does not apply under the circumstances presented in\r\nthis case where the injuries were not caused by the negligence that necessitated the presence of the police officer (the fleeing\r\nsuspect), but by an intervening negligent act.  E.g. Garcia v. City of South Tuscon, 640 P.2d 1117 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1982) (finding\r\nnegligent shooting of one officer by an officer of a different department to be an intervening act, as it was not the act that occasioned\r\nthe presence of the injured officer).  Moreover, the Fireman's Rule was not created in order to insulate government entities from\r\nsuit, but to insulate private entities, such as home or business owners, from suit by the fireman when injured in the course of duty on\r\nthat person's property.  See Minnich.\r\n4. The trial judge cited Arthurs and the following cases in a footnote, but never mentioned the public duty rule explicitly in his order: \r\nTanner v. Florence Co. Treasurer, et. al., 336 S.C. 552, 521 S.E.2d 153 (1999); Jensen v. Anderson County Dep't of Soc.\r\nServs., 304 S.C. 195, 403 S.E.2d 615 (1991).  After the order was issued, this Court heard Arthurs v. Aiken County, 346 S.C.\r\n97, 551 S.E.2d 579 (2001). \r\n5. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10, et. seq. (Supp. 2001).  This Act defines the parameters of tort liability for governmental agencies\r\nin South Carolina.\r\n6. Appellant points out that section 15-78-60 (19) excludes activities of the South Carolina National Guard while engaged in training\r\non duty, but limits that exemption to activities other than vehicular accidents.

We reverse\r\nand remand.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nScott pled guilty to criminal conspiracy, common law robbery and kidnaping.  He received a sentence of five years for criminal\r\nconspiracy.  He was, additionally, sentenced concurrently to ten years for kidnaping and robbery, suspended upon confinement for\r\nthree and one-half years and five years probation.\r\n  Scott served approximately 89.6% of the term of incarceration.  Due to good conduct credits Scott \"maxed out\" his sentence, was\r\nreleased and placed in the CSP.\r\n\r\nThe State claims Scott violated the terms of his CSP nineteen times and failed to report for vocational rehabilitation. (1) The State\r\nsought to revoke his CSP. \r\n\r\nAt the revocation hearing, Scott argued he should be placed on probation, instead of CSP, because he \"maxed out\" his sentence. \r\nHe further claimed he was not in violation of his probationary sentence because electronic monitoring was not a probationary\r\ncondition.  The circuit court judge agreed, terminated Scott's CSP and ordered the State to place him on probation.  The State's\r\nmotion for reconsideration was denied.  The State appeals.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Did the State properly and timely serve Scott with its notice  of intent to appeal?\r\n\r\nII. Did the circuit court err in terminating Scott's CSP and ordering him placed on probation?\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nService of Notice of Intent to Appeal\r\n\r\nScott argues this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  because the State failed to timely serve its notice of intent to appeal. See \r\n  Rule 203, SCACR. We disagree.\r\n\r\nRule 203 requires the State serve a notice of appeal \"within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or\r\njudgment.\"  Rule 203(b)(2), SCACR (emphasis added).  The rule requires the State file the notice \"with the clerk of the lower\r\ncourt and the clerk of the appellate court within ten (10) days after notice of appeal is served.\"  Rule 203(d)(2), SCACR\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe State received the circuit court's order denying reconsideration on July 18, 2000, served its notice of intent to appeal on July\r\n21, 2000, and filed the notice with the South Carolina Court of Appeals and, erroneously, with the Clerk of Court of Richland\r\nCounty on the same date. (2)  The State correctly filed its notice of appeal with the Clerk of Court of Lexington County on July 31,\r\n2000.  \r\n\r\nThe State timely served a notice of appeal on Scott. See \r\nRule 203(b)(2), SCACR. The notice of appeal was timely filed with the Clerk of \r\nCourt of the Court of Appeals and a corrected notice of appeal with the Clerk \r\nof Court of Lexington County within ten days after serving Scott. See Rule \r\n203(d)(2), SCACR;  see also  Rule 234(a), SCACR (\"In computing any period \r\nof time . . . the day of the act . . . after which the designated period of time \r\nbegins to run is not to be included.\"). \r\nScott argues, however, the notice originally served on him incorrectly listed Richland County as the county from which the appeal\r\nwas taken.  As such, Scott believes the State failed to perfect service.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nWhile this Court has consistently held service of the notice \r\n  of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, (3) \r\n  non-prejudicial clerical errors in the notice are not detrimental to the appeal. \r\n  Moody v. Dickinson, 54 S.C. 526, 32 S.E. 563 (1899) (a court may allow \r\n  an appellant to correct a mere clerical error in the notice of intention to \r\n  appeal where there is no prejudice to the appellee);  see also Charleston \r\n  Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Housing Corp., 318 S.C. 471, 458 S.E.2d 431 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995). \r\n\r\nIt is undisputed Lexington County, rather than Richland \r\n  County, was the proper county in which to file the notice. The State mistakenly \r\n  filed in Richland County because Scott was supervised in Richland, the warrant \r\n  was initiated in Richland, the hearing took place in Richland, and the circuit \r\n  court mistakenly cited Richland County in its Order. The citation of the incorrect \r\n  county in such circumstances is a clerical error. Scott does not allege, nor \r\n  do we discern, he was prejudiced by the error, which was corrected within 10 \r\n  days of notice to Scott. We are, therefore, not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction. \r\n   See Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Housing Corp., supra.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTermination of Community Supervision \r\n\r\nScott contends the circuit court properly terminated his CSP because the Department may not require him to participate in the\r\nprogram after he has maxed out his sentence for the \"no parole\" offense.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is a court must \r\n  ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. Charleston County \r\n  Sch. Dist. v. State Budget and Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993). \r\n  \"What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence \r\n  of the legislative intent or will.\" Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory \r\n  Construction Â§ 46.03 at 94 (5th ed. 1992). If a statute's language is plain, \r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning \"the rules of statutory interpretation \r\n  are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.\" Hodges \r\n  v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 81 (2000). \r\n\r\nBecause Scott maxed out (4) the non-suspended portion of his sentence, with the benefit of good conduct credits, two statutes are\r\nrelevant to his situation.  The first provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, except in a case in which the death penalty or a term of life imprisonment is imposed,\r\nany sentence for a \"no parole offense\" as defined in Section 24-13-100 must include any term of incarceration and completion of\r\na community supervision program operated by the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services.  \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560 (Supp. 2001) (emphasis added).  \r\n\r\nThe second statute, concerning individuals who max out the active part of their sentence with the benefit of good conduct credits,\r\nprovides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\nAny person who has served the term of imprisonment for which he has been sentenced less deductions allowed therefrom for good\r\nconduct is considered upon release to have served the entire term for which he was sentenced unless the person is required to\r\ncomplete a community supervision program pursuant to Section 24-21-560.  If the person is required to complete a community\r\nsupervision program, he must complete his sentence as provided in Section 24-21-560 prior to discharge from the criminal justice\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-210 (E).\r\n\r\nScott incorrectly asserts the section \"simply sets out the \r\n  legal framework for the CSP when it is made a part of an offender's 'no parole \r\n  offense' sentence.\" The use of the words \"must\" along with the conjunction \"and\" \r\n  indicate Scott's sentence for kidnaping requires a term of incarceration along \r\n  with completion of a CSP.  See Hodges v. Rainey, supra; Mitchell v. Holler, \r\n  311 S.C. 406, 410, 429 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1993) (\"The words of a statute must \r\n  be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced \r\n  construction to limit or expand a statute's operation.\"). \r\n\r\nIn the second statute, the word \"unless\" indicates a \"no \r\n  parole\" offender has not completed his sentence, when using the benefit of good \r\n  conduct credits, until completing the CSP. Scott was incarcerated for approximately \r\n  90% of the non-suspended portion of his sentence and was eligible for community \r\n  supervision. (5) Scott took advantage of good \r\n  conduct credits to max out his 3 Â½ year sentence. See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 24-13-210 and Â§ 24-13-220.\r\n\r\nContrary to Scott's argument, Â§ 24-13-210  does not apply \"only to offenders who had at a minimum served eighty-five percent of\r\ntheir sentences.\"  Instead, the section applies to any \"no parole\" offender who statutorily maxes out his sentence with the benefit of\r\ngood conduct credits. (6)    \r\n\r\nUnder Â§ 24-13-210, Scott has not served his entire active term of incarceration until he completes a CSP.  The circuit court lacked\r\nthe authority to terminate Scott's CSP.  On remand, the circuit court shall determine whether Scott violated the conditions of his\r\nCSP and consider any violation in accordance with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(C) (Supp. 2001).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the reasons articulated above we REVERSE and REMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n1.  Along with participating in vocational rehabilitation, the community supervision conditions for Scott included intensive supervision\r\nand electronic monitoring not to exceed ninety (90) days.\r\n2.   This case, originally filed in the Court of Appeals, was transferred to this Court after submission of briefs but before oral\r\narguments.\r\n3.  Sadisco of Greenville, Inc. v. \r\n  Greenville County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 340 S.C. 57, 59, 530 S.E.2d 383, \r\n  383 (2000). \r\n4.   Scott argues that upon his release from his active sentence, his accumulated good conduct credits applied and were sufficient to\r\n\"buy out\" the remaining portion of his active sentence.  He argues he was, therefore, entitled to receive probation immediately upon\r\nrelease.  We reject this argument. The Legislature unequivocally requires all persons convicted of a \"no parole offense\" to\r\nparticipate in community supervision.  Scott's argument suggests the need to address the relationship, if any, between good conduct\r\ncredits and the requirements of CSP.  This issue is better addressed in the legislative forum but, in any event, is not properly before\r\nus for review.\r\n5.  An individual convicted of a \"no \r\n  parole offense\" must serve 85% of the \"actual term of imprisonment imposed,\" \r\n  less any part suspended, before becoming eligible for community supervision. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-150(A)(Supp. 2001). \"This percentage must \r\n  be calculated without the application of earned work credits, education credits, \r\n  or good conduct credits, and is to be applied to the actual term of imprisonment \r\n  imposed, not including any portion of the sentence which is suspended.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-150(A) (Supp. 2002). \r\n6.  An issue of concern is whether a \r\n  \"no parole\" offense can include a probationary segment and how probation relates \r\n  to CSP. A benefit of probation in such cases is it provides a vehicle to enforce \r\n  a restitution order.  See Barlet v. State, 288 S.C. 481, 343 S.E.2d 620 \r\n  (1986) (defendant's probation may be revoked for wilfully failing to pay restitution). \r\n  However, because the issue is not preserved for review we do not address whether \r\n  trial courts may use probation for \"no parole\" offenses or whether they may \r\n  instead require restitution as a condition of CSP.  See State v. Bailey, \r\n  298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25542","title":"Lucas v.

Condon, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen \r\n  Bullard, and Assistant Attorney General W. Bryan Dukes, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n__________\r\n JUSTICE \r\n  WALLER:  We granted Petitioner a belated review of his direct appeal pursuant \r\n  to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 60 (1975).  We affirm.  \r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner, \r\n  Johnny Lee Lucas (Lucas), was convicted of first degree burglary, grand larceny, \r\n  pointing and presenting a firearm, and possession of a firearm by a convicted \r\n  felon, in connection with the April 15, 1996, burglary of a North Charleston \r\n  home. [1]   He was sentenced to \r\n  life without parole for burglary under the recidivist statute, and given five \r\n  years on each of the remaining charges.\r\nDuring \r\n  Lucasâ€™ trial, his attorney, William Thrower, moved to be relieved as counsel \r\n  on the basis that his client intended to call a witness, Rose Marie Brown, who \r\n  planned to give perjured testimony.  The trial judge decided to take Brownâ€™s \r\n  testimony in camera.  The gist of her testimony was that Lucas had left \r\n  Brownâ€™s house with her husband, Robert Brown, at approximately 9:30a.m. on April \r\n  15, 1996, to go see the burglary victim, Mr. Lindenburg; Mrs. Brown believed \r\n  Lindenburg owed her husband some money.  During the in camera hearing, \r\n  it was revealed that Brownâ€™s testimony had been written out for her. The statement \r\n  was in handwritten form, and was not Mrs. Brownâ€™s handwriting.  She had been \r\n  given the statement by Lucasâ€™ attorney, Mr. Thrower.  Thrower advised the court \r\n  that he had met with Lucas on Sunday evening and that Lucas had given him the \r\n  statement to help Brown refresh her memory.  However, after talking with Brown \r\n  in the hallway on the day of trial, it had come to Throwerâ€™s attention that \r\n  her testimony was not going to be truthful.  He based this assertion on the \r\n  fact that when he questioned her as to whether the written statement was  the \r\n  sworn truth, she would only reply that it was what she was going to testify \r\n  to, and when again asked if everything in the statement were truthful, she would \r\n  not say so.  The trial court denied counselâ€™s motion to be relieved.\r\nAt \r\n  the close of evidence, Lucas moved for a mistrial on the ground that, inter \r\n  alia, â€œthe lawyer said he didnâ€™t want to handle this case, so I had ineffective \r\n  assistance.â€  The trial court denied the motion, ruling that counsel was still \r\n  there as Lucasâ€™ lawyer, notwithstanding Lucas was not obliged to use him if \r\n  he didnâ€™t want.  Closing arguments were then made by both Thrower and Lucas.  \r\n  Lucas renewed his motion for a mistrial based upon counselâ€™s â€œbacking out on \r\n  him.â€\r\nLucas \r\n  filed for PCR alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to perfect \r\n  an appeal, and alleging a denial of due process.  The PCR court ruled Lucas \r\n  was entitled to a belated appeal of his direct appeal issues pursuant to White \r\n  v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).  Thereafter, this Court affirmed \r\n  three of Lucasâ€™ direct appeal issues pursuant to Rule 220(b),SCACR.  However, \r\n  we granted certiorari to review the direct appeal issue concerning denial of \r\n  counselâ€™s motion to be relieved and denial of Lucasâ€™ motion for a mistrial.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhere an attorney forms a good faith basis for suspecting his client is about \r\n  to present perjured testimony, and thereafter reveals the suspected perjury \r\n  to the trial court and moves to be relieved as counsel, does the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  denial of the motion to be relieved constitute an abuse of discretion, depriving \r\n  the defendant of a fair trial?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPursuant to Rule 407, \r\n  SCACR, Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 3.3:\r\n\r\n(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly. . . \r\n  \r\n(4) Offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false.  If a \r\n  lawyer has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer \r\n  shall take reasonable remedial measures.\r\n  \r\n(b) The duties stated in paragraph (a) continue to the conclusion of \r\n  the proceeding, and apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information \r\n  otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.\r\n(c) A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence that the lawyer reasonably \r\n  believes is false.\r\n\r\nRule 1.6(b) of the RPC permits an attorney to reveal \r\n  client confidences â€œto the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary. \r\n  . . [t]o prevent the client from committing a criminal act. . . .â€  The notes \r\n  following Rule 1.6 recognize an exception to the general prohibition against \r\n  disclosure in that a lawyer may not counsel or assist a client in conduct that \r\n  is criminal or fraudulent, see Rule 1.2(d), and has a duty under Rule \r\n  3.3(a)(4) not to use false evidence.  If the lawyer's services will be used \r\n  by the client in materially furthering a course of criminal or fraudulent conduct, \r\n  the lawyer must withdraw, as stated in Rule 1.16(a)(1)(lawyer must withdraw \r\n  from representation if representation will result in violation of the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct or other law).  \r\nIn Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157 (1986), \r\n  the United States Supreme Court ruled that a criminal defendantâ€™s sixth amendment \r\n  right to effective assistance of counsel was not violated when the attorney \r\n  refused to cooperate with the defendant in presenting perjured testimony at \r\n  trial.  In Nix, the defendant, Whiteside, who was charged with murder, \r\n  had consistently advised his attorney that although he had not seen a gun in \r\n  the victimâ€™s hand, he was convinced the victim in fact possessed a gun.  Shortly \r\n  before trial, however, Whiteside told counsel he had seen â€œsomething metallicâ€ \r\n  in the victimâ€™s hand.  When asked about his change in stories, he told counsel \r\n  â€œIf I donâ€™t say I saw a gun, Iâ€™m dead.â€  Counsel advised Whiteside that if he \r\n  insisted upon testifying falsely, counsel would be compelled to advise the court \r\n  of his belief that Whiteside was committing perjury, and would also move to \r\n  withdraw as his counsel.  Whiteside ultimately testified in accordance with \r\n  his original version of events, admitting on cross examination that he had not \r\n  seen a gun in the victimâ€™s hand.  After he was convicted of murder, Whiteside \r\n  sought a new trial, claiming he had been deprived of a fair trial by counselâ€™s \r\n  admonitions not to testify as to seeing something metallic in the victimâ€™s hand.  \r\n  The Iowa Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the new trial motion, ruling counselâ€™s \r\n  actions were not only permissible, but were required under Iowa law. \r\nThereafter, Whiteside sought federal habeas corpus \r\n  relief, alleging he had been denied effective assistance of counsel and of his \r\n  right to present a defense by counselâ€™s refusal to allow him to testify as proposed.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed, reasoning that an intent \r\n  to commit perjury, communicated to counsel, does not alter a defendantâ€™s right \r\n  to effective assistance of counsel and that counselâ€™s admonition that he would \r\n  advise the court of Whitesideâ€™s perjury constituted a threat to violate his \r\n  duty to preserve client confidences.  The Eighth Circuit concluded that the \r\n  prejudice prong of Strickland v. Washington \r\n  [2]  was satisfied by an implication of prejudice from the conflict between \r\n  counselâ€™s duty of loyalty to Whiteside and his ethical duties.  Whiteside \r\n  v. Scurr, 744 F.2d 1323 (8th Cir. 1984).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court reversed in Nix, \r\n  stating, â€œAlthough counsel must take all reasonable lawful means to attain the \r\n  objectives of the client, counsel is precluded from taking steps or in any way \r\n  assisting the client in presenting false evidence or otherwise violating the \r\n  law.â€  477 U.S. at 166.  The Court went on to note that under the Iowa Code \r\n  of Professional Responsibility, the rules â€œdo not merely authorize disclosure \r\n  by counsel of client perjury, they require such disclosure. . .,â€  id. \r\n  at 168, and that the rules â€œexpressly permit withdrawal from representation \r\n  as an appropriate response of an attorney when the client threatens to commit \r\n  perjury.â€  Id. at 170.  The Court concluded that counselâ€™s representation \r\n  fell well within accepted standards of professional conduct, and did not pose \r\n  the type of â€œconflictâ€ which would obviate the need for a showing of prejudice \r\n  under Strickland v. Washington. [3]   \r\nWe find attorney Throwerâ€™s actions in the present \r\n  case consistent with  the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct.  As \r\n  noted previously, Thrower was prohibited by Rule 3.3. from offering evidence \r\n  he reasonably believed was false, \r\n  [4]  was authorized by Rule 1.6(b) to reveal confidences necessary to prevent \r\n  a criminal act, and was permitted to withdraw pursuant to Rule 1.16(a).  We \r\n  find no ethical violation.  Moreover, we find no prejudice to Lucas as a result \r\n  of the trial courtâ€™s denial of counselâ€™s motion to be relieved.  \r\nIn Matter of Goodwin, 279 S.C. 274, 305 \r\n  S.E.2d 578 (1983), this Court addressed the appropriate action of a trial judge \r\n  when faced with the situation of an attorney attempting to withdraw due to suspected \r\n  client perjury.  We stated, \r\n\r\nWhile an attorney has an ethical duty not to perpetrate a fraud upon \r\n  the court by knowingly presenting perjured testimony, the defendant has a constitutional \r\n  right to representation by counsel.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, \r\n  83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963).  Had the trial judge allowed the withdrawal, \r\n  any new attorney he appointed would, if faced with the same conflict, have moved \r\n  to withdraw, potentially resulting in a perpetual cycle of eleventh-hour motions \r\n  to withdraw.  Worse, new counsel might fail to recognize the problem and unwittingly \r\n  present false evidence.  [5] \r\n. . . [M]otions to withdraw must lie within the sound discretion of the \r\n  trial judge.  In making the decision, the trial court must balance the need \r\n  for the orderly administration of justice with the fact that an irreconcilable \r\n  conflict exists between counsel and the accused.  The court should consider \r\n  the timing of the motion, the inconvenience to the witnesses, the period of \r\n  time elapsed between the date of the alleged offense and the trial, and the \r\n  possibility that any new counsel will be confronted with the same conflict.   \r\n\r\n\r\n279 S.C. at 276-77, 305 S.E.2d at 579 (emphasis supplied).  \r\n  Here, it is patent that any new attorney would have been confronted with the \r\n  same dilemma.  Moreover, the motion to be relieved came nearly half way through \r\n  a very serious trial.  We find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of the motions to be relieved and for a mistrial.  \r\nFinally, we find Lucas has demonstrated no prejudice \r\n  from denial of counselâ€™s motion to be relieved.  Although Lucas himself decided \r\n  to cross-examine his witnesses, he did so of his own volition, with counsel \r\n  at his side at all times ready to assist in his defense. \r\n  [6]   Further, counsel made all appropriate motions at the close of both \r\n  the stateâ€™s case and the close of evidence, and gave a closing statement to \r\n  the jury.  Accordingly, Lucas has failed to demonstrate in what manner his defense \r\n  was prejudiced by denial of counselâ€™s motion to be relieved.  Lucasâ€™ convictions \r\n  and sentences are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE \r\n  and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]    The owners of the home, Mr. and Mrs. Lindenburg came home from \r\n    a walk and found the burglary in progress.  Mr. Lindenburg had a gun with \r\n    him and shot and killed Lucasâ€™ cohort, Robert Anthony Lee Brown, and shot \r\n    Lucas in the chest.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]    Strickland v . Washington, 466 U.S. 668 \r\n    (1984).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]    The Court stated, â€œHere, there was indeed a â€œconflict,â€ but of \r\n    quite a different kind; it was one imposed on the attorney by the clientâ€™s \r\n    proposal to commit the crime of fabricating testimony. . . This is not remotely \r\n    the kind of conflict of interests dealt with in Cuyler v. Sullivan \r\n    (allowing a defendant to obtain relief without a showing of prejudice due \r\n    to counselâ€™s representation of conflicting interests).  Id. at 175.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]   Lucas asserts Thrower did not â€œreasonably believeâ€ Brownâ€™s testimony \r\n    would be perjured because he could not say, for certain, that the testimony \r\n    was in fact false.  On the present record, we find Throwerâ€™s belief that Brown \r\n    would commit perjury were entirely reasonable, which is all that is required \r\n    under the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]    Although language in Goodwin indicated counsel was prohibited \r\n    from disclosing the suspected perjury, it was written in 1983, prior to adoption \r\n    of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which became effective in September \r\n    1990, and which specifically permit disclosure of client confidences if necessary \r\n    to prevent a criminal act.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]   In fact, at the outset of trial, by his own request, Lucas was appointed \r\n    co-counsel to assist in his defense.  Further, in response to Lucasâ€™ motion \r\n    for a mistrial, the court noted, â€œI denied his motion [to be relieved], and \r\n    he still sits there as your lawyer.  You donâ€™t have to use him if you donâ€™t \r\n    want to, but heâ€™s still available.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25543","title":"State v.

Valenta, Jr., and General Counsel and Deputy Director for Policy, \r\n  Eugene H. Matthews, of Columbia, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE \r\n  WALLER:  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion in State v. Martin, 341 S.C. 480, 534 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 2000).  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nThrough \r\n  a series of administrative errors, Martin was notified in December 1997, that \r\n  she had been â€œconvicted,â€ in absentia, of driving under the influence \r\n  (DUI) first on August 26, 1997.  A bench warrant was issued for her arrest, \r\n  she was fined $425.00, and her license was suspended for nearly six months.  \r\n  Nearly six months later, in June 1998, the state sought and obtained an Ishmell [1]  order reopening the case on the \r\n  ground that the traffic ticket had been â€œsigned offâ€ in error. [2]   The circuit court ruled that the stateâ€™s efforts to set aside \r\n  the ticket were both untimely and improperly handled. \r\n  [3]   Accordingly, the Ishmell order was vacated and the DUI first \r\n  ticket was reinstated.  \r\nThe Court \r\n  of Appeals affirmed the decision to vacate Ishmell order, but vacated \r\n  the portion of the circuit court's order which required reinstatement of Martinâ€™s \r\n  DUI â€œconviction.â€  We reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling and reinstate the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order.\r\nThe state \r\n  took no action between December 1997 and June 1998 to rectify the situation \r\n  or to notify Martin that her â€œconvictionâ€ had been erroneously entered.  Rather, \r\n  it issued a bench warrant for her arrest, suspended her driverâ€™s license, allowed \r\n  her to pay a $425.00 fine, and required her to enroll in ADSAP classes and purchase \r\n  SR-22 insurance in order to obtain a provisional driverâ€™s license.  Its failure \r\n  to take any remedial action to remedy this situation in a timely manner therefore \r\n  precluded its ability to challenge the entry of a conviction on the DUI first \r\n  ticket.  See Rule 29, SCRCrimP(in cases involving appeals from convictions \r\n  in magistrate's court, post trial motions must be made within ten (10) days \r\n  after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment disposing \r\n  of the appeal).   The state does not dispute that its motion to set aside the \r\n  original conviction was untimely.  As we noted in Brewer v. South Carolina \r\n  State Highway Depâ€™t, 261 S.C. 52, 56, 198 S.E.2d 256, 257 (1973), â€œa party's \r\n  time to appeal from a judgment in a magistrate's court or move for a new trial \r\n  therein . . . begin[s] [when] he has notice of the judgment.â€  Accordingly, \r\n  as the state concedes it had actual notice of the entry of Martinâ€™s â€œconvictionâ€ \r\n  in December 1997, and failed to timely appeal or take any other action to correct \r\n  the matter, it was procedurally barred from contesting the validity of that \r\n  â€œconviction.â€ [4]   The Court of Appeals erred in concluding otherwise.\r\nVACATED \r\n  AND REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, \r\n  C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]    Ishmell v.

Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-325(A) (Supp. 2002), \r\n  which provides:\r\n\r\n  (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except \r\n  as otherwise permitted to meet competition as provided by this chapter, \r\n  it is declared an unfair trade practice and unlawful for any person who is in \r\n  the retail business of selling motor fuel to sell motor fuel of like grade and \r\n  quality at retail at a price which is below the cost of acquiring the product \r\n  plus taxes and transportation where the intent or effect is to destroy or substantially \r\n  lessen competition or to injure a competitor.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  We find the term â€œmeet competitionâ€ as \r\n  used in this section means to meet the existing price of a competitor.\r\n FACTS [1] \r\nDuring the pertinent \r\n  time period,  both plaintiff (Jordan) and defendant (Boardman) operated convenience \r\n  stores in South Carolina.  Jordan operated â€œHot Spotâ€ and Boardman operated \r\n  â€œSmile Gas.â€  Jordan had two Hot Spot stores in Spartanburg County along I-26 \r\n  located within several miles of two of Boardmanâ€™s Smile Gas stores.  \r\nIn July 1998, Jordan began selling Shell \r\n  brand gasoline at its Hot Spot stores.  Shortly after the Shell logo and colors \r\n  went up at Jordanâ€™s stores, Boardman, who did not sell national brand name gasoline, \r\n  lowered the price of its regular unleaded gasoline, setting it at two cents \r\n  below the price of the Shell brand gasoline. Jordan responded with its own price \r\n  reduction, matching Boardmanâ€™s prices. Boardman lowered its prices again, reestablishing \r\n  a two-cent per gallon price differential.  This cycle of price adjustments continued \r\n  downward until both parties were selling below cost.  The parties continued \r\n  to sell below cost until early October 1998. \r\n  [2] \r\nJordan then commenced this action alleging \r\n  a violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA) under \r\n  Â§ 39-5-325(A).  The district court entered judgment for Boardman finding this \r\n  section did not apply to independent gasoline retailers and that selling below \r\n  cost was allowed to â€œmeet competition.â€ [3]   On appeal, the Fourth Circuit \r\n  reversed and remanded with directions that the district court certify to this \r\n  Court the question whether selling below cost was permissible under the â€œmeet \r\n  competitionâ€ exception.  The question now certified by the district court is:\r\n\r\nDoes an independent retailer \r\n  â€œmeet competitionâ€ by selling below cost at a price that is two cents below \r\n  the price of the national brand competitor under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-325(A) \r\n  of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nEssentially, the novel issue here is whether the term â€œmeet competitionâ€ means \r\n  a gasoline retailer may sell below cost only to match the price of a competitor \r\n  and not lower.  Here, Boardman sold below cost at two cents less than the price \r\n  charged by Jordan. [4]   Boardman \r\n  defends this practice on the ground retailers of nationally branded gasoline \r\n  have a market advantage over independent retailers based on name recognition \r\n  and â€œcustomer perceptionsâ€ instilled by advertising.  Boardman contends an independent \r\n  retailer should be allowed under Â§ 39-5-325(A) to sell at lower prices in order \r\n  to â€œmeet competitionâ€ from national brand gasoline retailers. We disagree.\r\nThe relevant statutory scheme indicates â€œmeet competitionâ€ means to match the \r\n  price charged by the competition without considering other competitive factors.  \r\n  Section 39-5-325(A) specifically states it is unlawful to sell gasoline below \r\n  cost â€œ[e]xcept as otherwise permitted to meet competition as provided by \r\n  this chapter.â€  The only other provision in this chapter relating to the \r\n  exemption for meeting competition is S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-350 (Supp. 2002) \r\n  which provides:\r\n\r\n  (A) . . . .Retail sales of \r\n  merchandise of like grade and quality at a price to meet existing competition \r\n  at any time in any town or locality are also exempt from the provisions of this \r\n  article.  But if such competition is created by any person in violation of this \r\n  article or when any two or more persons contend that they are meeting the competition \r\n  of the other and all would be making retail sales in violation of this article, \r\n  except for the above provisions allowing existing competition to be met, \r\n  any retailer affected thereby may enjoin all in such category from continuing \r\n  such practices in any court of competent jurisdiction in this State.\r\n(B)Any person selling motor fuel \r\n  at wholesale or retail at a price below the actual cost of acquiring the product, \r\n  including transportation and taxes, claiming exemption from this article on \r\n  the basis that such sales of motor fuel by that person are at a price to meet \r\n  existing competition under subsection (A) of this section shall keep \r\n  and maintain records substantiating each effort to meet the competition, \r\n  including the identity and place of business of the competitors whose competition \r\n  that person is meeting. . . .\r\n\r\nThe repeated reference to meeting \r\n  â€œexisting competitionâ€ indicates the legislature intended an exemption for below-cost \r\n  sales only to match the existing price of a competitor.  See Wade \r\n  v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 559 S.E.2d 586 (2002) (cardinal rule of \r\n  statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate intent of the legislature).  \r\n  To construe â€œexisting competitionâ€ to refer generally to any competitive factors, \r\n  rather than a competitorâ€™s existing price, would nullify the prohibition on \r\n  selling below cost.  A retailer could assert any number of factors that affect \r\n  competition i.e., location, hours of operation, appearance, overhead, \r\n  customer base, etc., to claim an exemption for meeting competition.\r\nFurther, the specific \r\n  directive in Â§ 39-5-350(B) that a retailer selling below cost keep records â€œsubstantiating \r\n  each effort to meet the competitionâ€ indicates a fluctuating factor such as \r\n  price rather than a more permanent competitive factor.\r\nFinally, as Boardman \r\n  acknowledges in its brief, independent retailers generally pay less for gasoline \r\n  and can therefore sell at a lower price than national brands without going below \r\n  cost.  Independent retailers therefore do have some competitive advantage over \r\n  the national brands and are not presumptively disadvantaged.  There is no support \r\n  for the argument the legislature intended to protect independent gasoline retailers \r\n  over retailers selling national brands.\r\nIn conclusion, we construe \r\n  the term â€œmeet competitionâ€ in Â§ 39-5-325(A) to mean â€œto meet the existing price \r\n  charged by a competitor.â€  A gasoline retailer who sells below cost at a price \r\n  less than that of the competition does not qualify for the exemption provided \r\n  in this section.  Accordingly, we answer the certified question in the negative.\r\n CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    These facts are taken from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appealsâ€™ slip opinion \r\n    in this case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    According to Boardmanâ€™s brief, Jordan actually reached below-cost levels first \r\n    because Jordan pays more for the same grade of gasoline.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  In deciding the case, the district court certified a question to \r\n    this Court regarding the appropriate standard for reviewing challenges to \r\n    state statutes on substantive due process grounds.  R.L. Jordan Co. v. \r\n    Boardman Petroleum, Inc., 338 S.C. 475, 527 S.E.2d 763 (2000).  Whether \r\n    the statute passes constitutional muster remains unanswered by the district \r\n    court and we express no opinion on the merits of that question.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    Apparently Jordan sold below-cost only to meet the prices charged by Boardman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25545","title":"The Housing Authority of the City of Charleston v.

Clark, of Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood, L.L.C., of Charleston, for petitioner.\r\nWillie A. Key, of Charleston, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We accepted this case in our original \r\n  jurisdiction to determine whether respondent has engaged in the unauthorized \r\n  practice of law.  We find he has and enjoin him from further engaging in such \r\n  conduct.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner (Housing Authority) commenced this action \r\n  seeking to enjoin respondent Key from the unauthorized practice of law.  We \r\n  appointed the Honorable John W. Kittredge as special referee to hear evidence \r\n  and make recommendations.  Based on the uncontested facts set forth below, Judge \r\n  Kittredge concluded respondent had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law \r\n  and recommended an injunction be issued.  No objections to the refereeâ€™s report \r\n  have been filed.  \r\nRespondent has a paralegal certificate \r\n  and worked as a paralegal at a law firm in Charleston for three years.  He has \r\n  been unemployed since 2000 and has no address or telephone number.  Respondent \r\n  volunteers at an office referred to as â€œthe Fair Housing Officeâ€ in Charleston \r\n  advising people who call with landlord complaints.  He is not paid.  No attorney \r\n  supervises the office.  \r\nIn 2001, on behalf of Jacqueline Sarvis and Derotha Robinson, respondent \r\n  prepared and filed a complaint in federal court alleging unlawful evictions. [1]   He appeared at a status conference \r\n  before the federal magistrate.  Respondent also prepared pleadings filed in \r\n  circuit court alleging an unlawful termination of public assistance rental benefits \r\n  for Joan Whitley and assisted Ms. Whitley at the hearing in circuit court.  \r\n  [2]   Respondent did not sign any of the pleadings he prepared but had them \r\n  signed by the plaintiffs as pro se litigants.  He accepted no payment \r\n  and in fact paid the filing fees out of his own pocket.  Respondent did not \r\n  obtain leave of court to represent any of these clients. [3] \r\n DISCUSSION\r\nRespondent defends his conduct on the ground he was not \r\n  paid and he had the clientsâ€™ permission to represent them. \r\n  [4]   \r\nThe practice of law includes the preparation of pleadings \r\n  and the management of court proceedings on the behalf of clients.  Doe v. \r\n  Condon, ___ S.C. ___, 568 S.E.2d 356 (2002).  Respondentâ€™s activities on \r\n  behalf of Whitley, Robinson, and Sarvis constituted the practice of law.  The \r\n  fact that respondent accepted no remuneration for his services is irrelevant.  \r\n  Our purpose in regulating the practice of law is to protect the public from \r\n  the negative consequences of erroneously prepared legal documents or inaccurate \r\n  legal advice given by persons untrained in the law.

Craig, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25546\r\nSubmitted September 20, 2002 - Filed \r\n  October 28, 2002\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Assistant Deputy Attorney \r\n  General J. Emory Smith, Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel.\r\nComing B. Gibbs, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to imposition of a sanction ranging from an admonition \r\n  to a public reprimand.  Respondent has also agreed to resign from membership \r\n  in the South Carolina Bar. [1]   We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.  The \r\n  facts as admitted in the agreement are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.       Real Estate Matters\r\nIn the first matter, respondent prepared a deed for a client \r\n  in 1986.  Respondent failed to include an acre of land in the deed.  In 1996, \r\n  the client informed respondent of this error.  Because respondent failed to \r\n  correct this error in a timely fashion, the client hired another attorney to \r\n  correct the error.\r\nIn the second matter, respondent represented the purchasers \r\n  in a real estate transaction in 1985.  The property was subject to a $2,000 \r\n  lien.  In 1999, the purchasers learned that the lien had not been satisfied \r\n  and notified respondent.  Respondent failed to respond to the purchasersâ€™ requests \r\n  for assistance, and the purchasers personally satisfied the lien.  Subsequently, \r\n  respondent reimbursed the purchasers for their costs in satisfying the lien \r\n  and otherwise settled the matter to their satisfaction.\r\nII.      Domestic Matter\r\nIn a third matter, respondent undertook representation \r\n  of a client in a domestic matter.  Respondent made inappropriate remarks to \r\n  the client, used vulgar language, told jokes with sexual references, and offered \r\n  to reduce his fee if the client would allow respondent to watch the client engage \r\n  in a specified act.  At some point, respondent informed the client that a hearing \r\n  had been scheduled in her case for February 1999 when, in fact, no hearing was \r\n  scheduled.  Respondent also failed to return the clientâ€™s telephone calls and \r\n  failed to respond to the clientâ€™s letter, dated January 19, 1999, requesting \r\n  the return of the fees paid by the client to respondent.  \r\nIII.    Failure to Respond to the ODC\r\nIn all of these matters, respondent failed to respond to ODCâ€™s initial inquiries \r\n  and did not respond in a timely fashion to ODCâ€™s letters pursuant to In re \r\n  Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).\r\nIV.    Employer Withholding Tax Matter\r\nLiens for payment of employer withholding taxes have been \r\n  filed against respondent by the South Carolina Department of Revenue and the \r\n  United States Internal Revenue Service.  Respondent has satisfied the lien filed \r\n  by the South Carolina Department of Revenue, but the federal lien has not been \r\n  satisfied.  \r\nLaw\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent \r\n  has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (failing to provide competent representation); Rule \r\n  1.3 (failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing \r\n  a client); Rule 1.4(a) (failing to promptly comply with reasonable requests \r\n  for information); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  Rule 8.4(b) (committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s \r\n  honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness); Rule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct involving \r\n  misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the \r\n  administration of justice).\r\nRespondent has also violated the following \r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating \r\n  the Rules of Professional Responsibility); Rule 7(a)(3) (knowingly failing to \r\n  respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(4) (committing \r\n  a serious crime); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration \r\n  of justice); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the Oath of Office taken upon admission \r\n  to the practice of law).\r\nConclusion\r\nRespondent has fully acknowledged that \r\n  his actions in the aforementioned matters were in violation of the Rules of \r\n  Professional Conduct and the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.  In \r\n  light of respondentâ€™s resignation from the South Carolina Bar, we accept this \r\n  agreement and publicly reprimand respondent. \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   This is the second occasion in which the Court has sanctioned \r\n    respondent.  In 1995, respondent was suspended from the practice of law for \r\n    15 months for negligent management of his trust account, failure to supervise \r\n    employees, lack of diligence, failure to avoid the appearance of impropriety, \r\n    and failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation.

Richardson, Jr., and Susan M. Johnston,  both of \r\n  Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDesa A. Ballard, of West Columbia and James W. Seeley, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction set forth in \r\n  Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent. [1]   The facts as admitted in the agreement are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.&nbsp; Chicago Title Insurance Matter\r\nRespondent was employed as an agent by Chicago Title \r\n  Insurance (CTI).  CTI conducted a routine audit of respondentâ€™s accounts and \r\n  discovered two questionable checks made payable to respondent.  Respondent admitted \r\n  that he had written two checks, made payable to himself and drawn upon his trust \r\n  account, in the amounts of $5,000 and $17,000.  Respondent admitted that he \r\n  had converted client funds for his personal use.  \r\nII.&nbsp; Client \r\n  Matters\r\nRespondent represented a client \r\n  during a real estate transaction in 1998.  The property cost $22,000, and client \r\n  intended to place a mobile home on the property.  Respondent conducted a title \r\n  search of the property; however, he failed to discover that a restriction on \r\n  the property precluded client from placing a mobile home on the property.  Upon \r\n  learning of the restriction, respondent purchased the property from client for \r\n  $22,430.  Respondent was able to purchase the property because he misappropriated \r\n  and converted funds from his trust account.  \r\nRespondent also represented another \r\n  client from 1973 until 1998.  Respondent held a power of attorney and was entrusted \r\n  with the management of clientâ€™s finances.  Respondent failed to properly document \r\n  financial transactions.  Furthermore, respondent misappropriated and converted \r\n  unidentified funds from other clients in favor of client and himself.       \r\nIn another matter, respondent represented a client \r\n  in multiple real estate transactions.  Respondent did not handle the real estate \r\n  transactions in a timely manner, which caused client to suffer additional expenses \r\n  in the amount of $17,000.  As a result, respondent paid client $17,000.  Respondent \r\n  was able to pay client because he misappropriated and converted funds from his \r\n  trust account.       \r\nIn yet another matter, respondent represented another \r\n  client during a real estate transaction.  Respondent received approximately \r\n  $72,459.39 from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.  Respondent wrote a check in the \r\n  amount of $62,370.67 as payment to satisfy clientâ€™s mortgage; however, respondent \r\n  never issued the check.  Instead, respondent misappropriated and converted the \r\n  funds to his personal use.\r\nFurthermore, in twenty-six other matters, respondent \r\n  received a total of $71,654.34 and converted the funds to his personal use.  \r\n  As of August 21, 2001, respondentâ€™s trust account had a negative balance of \r\n  approximately $111,000 to $148,000.  \r\nRespondent admitted to ODC that he began misappropriating \r\n  funds in 1995.  Respondent informed ODC that the funds were used to pay law \r\n  firm expenses; however, ODC discovered that the funds were converted for respondentâ€™s \r\n  personal use.  Furthermore, respondent informed ODC that he deposited an unspecified \r\n  amount of funds into his trust account as restitution for the converted funds.  \r\n  However, ODC discovered that respondentâ€™s statement was untrue.  \r\nLaw\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated the following Rules of \r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent \r\n  representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer shall abide by a clientâ€™s decisions \r\n  concerning the objectives of representation); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with \r\n  reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.5 (a lawyerâ€™s \r\n  fee shall be reasonable); Rule 1.8 (a lawyer shall not enter into a business \r\n  transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security \r\n  or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client); Rule 1.14 (a lawyer shall \r\n  maintain a normal client-lawyer relationship with a client who is impaired); \r\n  Rule 1.15 (a lawyer shall hold property of clients that is in the lawyerâ€™s possession \r\n  in connection with representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property); \r\n  Rule 4.1 (a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact \r\n  or law to a third person); Rule 4.4 (in representing a client a lawyer shall \r\n  not use means that have no purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden \r\n  a third person); Rule 8.4(a) (a lawyer shall not violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct): Rule 8.4(b) (a lawyer shall not commit a criminal act that reflects \r\n  adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer); \r\n  Rule 8.4(c) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); \r\n  Rule 8.4(d) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, \r\n  deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (a lawyer shall not engage in \r\n  conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice). \r\nIn addition, respondent has violated the following \r\n  Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending \r\n  to pollute the administration of justice or bring the legal profession into \r\n  disrepute); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon admission \r\n  to practice law).   \r\n Conclusion\r\n  We accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from \r\n  the practice of law in this state.  Respondent shall not be entitled to seek \r\n  reinstatement or readmission to the practice of law until he has fully repaid \r\n  all funds owed clients and/or the trust, including reasonable interest, and \r\n  until he has reimbursed the Lawyerâ€™s Fund for Client Protection for any and \r\n  all amounts paid, including reasonable interest, in connection with these matters.  \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice \r\n  of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n DISBARRED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent was placed \r\n    on interim suspension by order of this Court dated August 30, 2001.

Richardson, Jr., and Barbara M. Seymour, both of Columbia, for the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nJames G. Longtin, of Walterboro, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a sanction ranging from \r\n  an admonition to a thirty day suspension.  We accept the agreement and find \r\n  a thirty day suspension from the practice of law is the appropriate sanction.  \r\n  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.       Collection Matter\r\nClient A retained respondent to handle twelve collection \r\n  matters; however, respondent failed to take legal action on behalf of Client \r\n  A.  Respondent also failed to keep Client A informed regarding the status of \r\n  the collection matters and failed to respond to numerous requests from Client \r\n  A for information regarding the status of the matters.  \r\nII.      Bankruptcy Matter\r\nClient B retained respondent to handle a bankruptcy matter.  \r\n  Client B paid respondent $400 of an $1,800 retainer fee.  Thereafter, respondent \r\n  failed to adequately communicate with Client B regarding the status of his bankruptcy \r\n  matter.  Respondent also failed to timely and diligently return telephone calls \r\n  from Client B and failed to appear in court on behalf of Client B.\r\nIII.    Failure to Cooperate with Disciplinary Counsel\r\nBy letter dated June 20, 2000, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel notified \r\n  respondent of a complaint filed by Client A; however, respondent failed to respond \r\n  or otherwise communicate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel in response \r\n  to that letter, a subsequent letter sent pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, \r\n  277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), or a Notice of Full Investigation.  Respondent \r\n  finally responded to the allegations set forth in the complaint on May 31, 2001, \r\n  after being compelled by subpoena to appear before Disciplinary Counsel and \r\n  respond to questions under oath.  Respondent also failed to respond to letters \r\n  and a Notice of Full Investigation regarding the complaint filed by Client B, \r\n  finally responding to allegations set forth therein on January 22, 2002, after \r\n  once again being compelled to do so by subpoena.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule \r\n  1.2(a)(a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives \r\n  of representation and shall consult with the client as to the means by which \r\n  they are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence \r\n  and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4(a) (a lawyer shall keep a \r\n  client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply \r\n  with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.5(a)(a lawyer's fee shall \r\n  be reasonable); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite \r\n  litigation consistent with the interests of the client); Rule 8.4(a) (it is \r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent also admits that he has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to willfully fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary \r\n  authority); and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to \r\n  bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or to engage in conduct \r\n  demonstrating an unfitness to practice law). \r\nConclusion\r\nIn our opinion, respondent's misconduct warrants a thirty \r\n  day suspension from the practice of law.

Richardson, Jr. and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDesa A. Ballard, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to \r\n  Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent conditionally \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension from the practice of \r\n  law for a period of up to sixty days. \r\n  [1]   We accept the agreement and suspend respondent for sixty days. [2]   The facts as admitted in the agreement are \r\n  as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent was appointed to represent \r\n  a client in a post-conviction relief (PCR) matter.  Following a hearing on February \r\n  13, 2002, the PCR judge granted the client relief and directed respondent to \r\n  prepare an order.  Respondent delayed in preparing the order and in responding \r\n  to inquiries from the judge regarding the preparation of the order.  \r\nIn the course of investigating the complaint \r\n  made against respondent by the client, Disciplinary Counsel issued and served, \r\n  pursuant to certified mail, a subpoena requiring respondent to appear before \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel on July 17, 2002.  Respondent signed the postal service \r\n  form acknowledging service on June 5, 2002, but failed to appear before Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel.  Respondent also failed to respond to a telephonic inquiry placed to \r\n  his principal office by the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.  Further, respondent \r\n  failed to contact the Office of Disciplinary Counsel to seek a postponement \r\n  or to advise Disciplinary Counsel that he would be unable to appear in accordance \r\n  with the subpoena.                  \r\nRespondent also failed to timely respond to a letter dated \r\n  July 2, 2002, sent to him by the Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court regarding another of respondentâ€™s clients, even though the letter required \r\n  a response by July 8, 2002.  An officer of the Bureau of Protective Services \r\n  personally served respondent with another copy of the letter on July 10, 2002.  \r\n  However, respondent did not reply to the letter until July 12, 2002, nor did \r\n  he notify the Chief Justice, the Clerk of the Supreme Court, or the Office of \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel that his response would be delayed.\r\nFurther, prior to receiving notice of his interim suspension, \r\n  respondent placed a telephone call to the Department of Social Services (DSS) \r\n  on behalf of a former client seeking information regarding the amount of arrearages \r\n  owed by the former client.  Respondent and the attorney for DSS exchanged telephone \r\n  calls for several days and respondent admits that he continued to communicate \r\n  with DSS after he learned of his interim suspension.  Respondent contends that \r\n  he did not intend this request for information to constitute the practice of \r\n  law, but acknowledges that his continued communications with DSS could be construed \r\n  as the practice of law while he was under interim suspension. \r\nAdditionally, respondent acknowledges that at the time of \r\n  his interim suspension, his trust account reconciliations were several months \r\n  behind schedule.  All funds deposited into the trust account have since been \r\n  properly identified and accounted for, and respondent is working diligently \r\n  with his accountant to bring the reconciliations current.  Respondent also affirms \r\n  that they will remain current after his reinstatement to the practice of law.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that his conduct violated the following \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (failing to provide \r\n  competent representation); Rule 1.3 (failing to act with reasonable diligence \r\n  and promptness while representing a client); Rule 1.4 (failing to keep a client \r\n  reasonably informed about the status of a matter and failing to promptly comply \r\n  with requests for information); Rule 3.2 (failing to make reasonable efforts \r\n  to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client); Rule 5.5 \r\n  (engaging in the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct that is prejudicial \r\n  to the administration of justice).  \r\nRespondent also admits that he violated Rule 7(a)(3), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, \r\n  (willfully violating an order of the Supreme Court and failing to appear pursuant \r\n  to a subpoena issued by Disciplinary Counsel) and Rule 417, SCACR (failing to \r\n  maintain current financial records).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a definite suspension.  Accordingly, \r\n  we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from \r\n  the practice of law for sixty days.  Within fifteen days of the date of this \r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing \r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.   \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In 2000, this Court publicly reprimanded respondent \r\n    for improperly handling a trust account while he was an associate at another \r\n    law office.

In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the sanction of disbarment.  We accept the \r\n  agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state.  The \r\n  facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nOn October 4, 2000, respondent pled guilty in the United \r\n  States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to laundering monetary \r\n  instruments. [1]   He was sentenced \r\n  to thirty-two months in prison followed by two years of supervised release.  \r\n  In addition, respondent was ordered to pay a fine of $10,000.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 1.15 (client funds shall be appropriately safeguarded); Rule 4.1 (in the \r\n  course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement \r\n  of material fact or law to a third person or fail to disclose a material fact \r\n  to a third person when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal \r\n  or fraudulent act by a client); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for \r\n  a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on \r\n  the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); \r\n  Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it \r\n  is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial \r\n  to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent also admits that he has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to be convicted of a crime of moral turpitude or a serious crime); \r\n  and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage \r\n  in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the \r\n  courts or the legal profession into disrepute or to engage in conduct demonstrating \r\n  an unfitness to practice law). \r\nConclusion\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.  Respondent's \r\n  request that the period of disbarment be made retroactive to the date of his \r\n  interim suspension is denied.

We reverse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err by concluding \r\n  trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to a portion of the \r\n  Allen [1]  charge?\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nDuring deliberation, the trial judge received \r\n  a note from the jury requesting permission to speak with him.  The jury returned \r\n  to the courtroom and the foreman stated:  â€œWe have - - there are eleven of us \r\n  who feel one way and one that feels another way.â€  \r\nAfter inquiry by the trial judge, the \r\n  foreman stated he did not know whether the jury could reach a unanimous verdict.  \r\n  The trial judge instructed the jury to determine whether further deliberation \r\n  would be helpful and excused the jury.  \r\nWhen the jury returned to \r\n  the courtroom, the foreman stated the juryâ€™s â€œstatusâ€ was â€œthe same.â€  The judge \r\n  responded, â€œOkay, and I understand eleven jurors - - without telling me who \r\n  feels which way, eleven jurors feel one way and one juror feels another way.â€  \r\n  The foreman replied, â€œYes, sir.â€  \r\nThe trial judge gave the following Allen charge:   \r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Foreman and ladies and gentlemen, in the trial of a case \r\n  in this Court, as Iâ€™ve told you, you are the sole judges of the facts.  As Judge \r\n  of the law in this case, Iâ€™m not permitted to even give you a hint as to how \r\n  I feel about what verdict you should write in this case.  \r\nIt is my duty to take the law and state it to you, and it is your duty to write \r\n  the verdict in the case, but I can say this, that when a matter is in dispute \r\n  I realize it is not always easy for even two persons to agree. When twelve men and women must agree, it is correspondingly \r\n  more difficult.  We certainly understand that, but it is important that litigation \r\n  be ended if it may be ended without a juror doing violence to his or her own \r\n  conscience. \r\nOf course, at the same time no juror should be expected to give up an opinion \r\n  based on reasoning satisfactory to himself or herself merely for the purpose \r\n  of being in agreement. \r\nI have sometimes thought that the juror who could \r\n  render less service to the Court and to the country than any other juror is \r\n  the juror who says, I know what I want to do in this case and when and if everybody \r\n  agrees with me, then weâ€™ll write a verdict, and weâ€™ll not write a verdict until \r\n  that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nAt the same time, of course, I charge you that every juror \r\n  has the right to his or her own opinion and need not give it up merely for the \r\n  purpose of being in agreement. \r\nIt was never intended that the verdict of the jury should be the view of any \r\n  one person.  On the other hand, the verdict of the jury is supposed to be the \r\n  collective reasoning of all the men and women together. \r\nThatâ€™s why we have the jury, so that we may have that benefit of your collective \r\n  thought and reasoning.  It becomes your duty and it was always your duty to \r\n  tell other jurors how you feel about a case, and why you think as you do, but \r\n  on the other hand, it is also your duty to exchange views and the duty of the \r\n  other jurors to exchange views with you, and you should listen to each other \r\n  and give to the other such thought and meaning as you think it should have.  \r\n\r\nSo to some degree it can be said that - - and it always is the case, that jury \r\n  service can be a matter of give and take.  \r\nNow, if a Defendant is entitled to a verdict, then he is entitled to a verdict \r\n  now.  If the State is entitled to a verdict, then the State is entitled to a \r\n  verdict now.  \r\nNeither of them are entitled to a verdict at some later time.  The trial of \r\n  any case in this Court is an expensive proposition and it costs the taxpayers \r\n  substantial amounts of money to try a case.  \r\nBut a mistrial of a case is an unfortunate thing for if you do not agree on \r\n  a verdict then you must understand that it does not mean that any body will \r\n  win.  It just means that at some future term of Court before some other Judge \r\n  then some other jury is going to sit where you sit now.  \r\nThe same participants will come back and the same lawyers will come back, and \r\n  they will ask basically the same questions again.\r\nI guess they will get basically the same answers, and we will go through the \r\n  entire process again.\r\nNow, I have no reason to think that any other twelve men \r\n  and women are more capable of solving this controversy than you are.  So, Mr. \r\n  Foreman and ladies and gentlemen, Iâ€™m going to ask you to deliberate further \r\n  on this matter and see if you cannot write a verdict.  \r\nWith that in mind, I will ask you to return to the jury room \r\n  and continue deliberations and see if you can write a verdict in this case.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(Underline added). \r\nTrial counsel did not object to the Allen charge. \r\nThe jury continued deliberating and returned \r\n  with a verdict convicting petitioner of both offenses. [2]   \r\nThe PCR judge concluded trial counsel \r\n  was not ineffective for failing to object to the Allen charge. \r\nANALYSIS\r\nTo prove ineffective assistance of counsel, \r\n  the applicant must show trial counselâ€™s performance fell below an objective \r\n  standard of reasonableness and, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable \r\n  probability the result at trial would have been different.  Strickland v. \r\n  Washington, 466 U.S. 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Cherry \r\n  v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).  A reasonable probability \r\n  is one sufficient to  undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.  Id.  \r\n  If there is any probative evidence to support the findings of the PCR judge, \r\n  those findings must be upheld.  Anderson v. State, 342 S.C. 54, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  649 (2000).  The Court  will not uphold the PCR courtâ€™s findings if there is \r\n  no probative evidence to support them.  Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, \r\n  470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nThe trial judge has the duty to urge, \r\n  but not coerce, a jury to reach a verdict.  Green v. State, Op. No. 25515 \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 12, 2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 28 at 43).  An \r\n  Allen charge cannot be directed to the minority voters on the jury panel, \r\n  but must instead be even-handed, directing both the majority and the minority \r\n  to consider the otherâ€™s views.  Id.\r\nWhether an Allen charge is unconstitutionally \r\n  coercive must be judged â€œin its context and under all the circumstances.â€  Tucker \r\n  v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 483, 491, 552 S.E.2d 712, 716 (2001), citing Lowenfield \r\n  v. Phelps, 484 U.S. 231, 237, 108 S.Ct. 546, 550, 98 L.Ed.2d 568, 577 (1988).  \r\n  The Tucker Court considered various factors to determine whether the \r\n  given Allen charge was unconstitutionally coercive.  One factor addressed \r\n  whether the trial judge inquired into the juryâ€™s numerical division; another \r\n  considered whether the charge spoke specifically to the minority jurors.    \r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, we conclude the underlined \r\n  portion of the Allen charge was coercive.  Depending on the context, \r\n  the contested language could be perceived as being directed toward the minority \r\n  juror.  Here, the jury initially volunteered its numerical division to the trial \r\n  judge.  Not only did the trial judge not instruct the jury not to state its \r\n  division in the future, but he later inquired as to the juryâ€™s continued numerical \r\n  division.  This inquiry was improper.  Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U.S. \r\n  231, 239, 108 S.Ct. 546, 552, 98 L.Ed.2d 568, 578 quoting Brasfield \r\n  v. United States, 272 U.S. 448, Â­Â­Â­450, 47 S.Ct. 135, 136, 71 L.Ed.2d 345, \r\n  346 (1926) (â€œthe inquiry into the juryâ€™s numerical division necessitated reversal \r\n  because it was generally coercive and always brought to bear â€˜in some degree, \r\n  serious although not measurable, an improper influence on the juryâ€™.â€); State \r\n  v. Middleton, 218 S.C. 452, 63 S.E.2d 163 (1951) (improper for judge to \r\n  require jury to reveal nature or extent of its division).  Given the trial judge \r\n  confirmed the existence of one minority juror immediately before the Allen \r\n  charge, we conclude the underlined language was clearly directed to the â€œholdoutâ€ \r\n  and, under these circumstances, was coercive.  Accordingly, trial counselâ€™s \r\n  failure to object to the charge was unreasonable.  But for counselâ€™s failure \r\n  to object, there is a reasonable probability the outcome of trial would have \r\n  been different.   \r\nBecause the PCR judge erred by holding counsel \r\n  was not ineffective for failing to object to the Allen charge, we REVERSE.  \r\n TOAl, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Allen v.
