Gibson, Jr., Stephen P. Hughes, and Mary Bass Lohr, all of Howell, \r\n  Gibson &amp; Hughes, P.A., of Beaufort, for Appellant;\r\nWendy Bergfeldt Cartledge, of Columbia, for Respondent State of South Carolina;\r\nRobert L. Widener and Erik P. Doerring, both of McNair Law Firm, of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent Richard W. Holtcamp.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  Beaufort \r\n  County appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor \r\n  of the State, finding S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-32-240 (Supp. 2000) does not violate \r\n  S.C. Const. art. X.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBeaufort County asserts \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-32-240 violates S.C. Const. art. X.  The State contends \r\n  the statute is constitutional.  The Circuit Court granted Richard Holtcamp (â€œHoltcampâ€) \r\n  intervenor status and granted the Stateâ€™s motion for summary judgment. [1] \r\nAs no facts are in dispute, \r\n  no party argues summary judgment was improper as a matter of law.  The sole \r\n  issue is whether Â§ 27-32-240 violates S.C. Const. art. X.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBeaufort County argues \r\n  Article X prohibits the legislature from using different methods to determine \r\n  fair market value in two sub-classes of a particular class of property.  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nBecause this Court is reluctant to find \r\n  a statute unconstitutional, every presumption is made in favor of its constitutionality.  \r\n  Knotts v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resour., 348 S.C. 1, 558 S.E.2d \r\n  511 (2002).  A â€œlegislative act will not be declared unconstitutional unless \r\n  its repugnance to the constitution is clear and beyond a reasonable doubt.â€  \r\n  Joytime Distribs. and Amusement Co., Inc. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 640, \r\n  528 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1999), cert. denied 529 U.S. 1087, 120 S.Ct. \r\n  1719, 146 L.Ed.2d 641 (2000).   Beaufort County bears the burden of proving \r\n  the statute unconstitutional.   See Knotts, supra.\r\nBeaufort County attempts \r\n  to carry its burden by arguing the Legislature enacted Â§ 27-32-240 in contravention \r\n  of its limited powers under S.C. Const. art X, Â§ 1 and S.C. Const. art. X, Â§ \r\n  2(a).  South Carolinaâ€™s Constitution provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly may provide for the ad valorem taxation \r\n  by the State or any of its subdivisions of all real and personal property.  \r\n  The assessment of all property shall be equal and uniform in the following \r\n  classifications:\r\n . . .\r\n(5) All other real property not herein provided for shall \r\n  be taxed on an assessment equal to six percent of the fair market value of such \r\n  property.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. X, Â§ 1 (emphasis added).\r\nIt further provides:   \r\n\r\nThe General Assembly may define \r\n  the classes of property and values for property tax purposes of the classes \r\n  of property set forth in Section 1 of this article and establish administrative \r\n  procedures for property owners to qualify for a particular classification.  \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. X, Â§ 2 (a).\r\nThe statute at issue states:\r\n\r\nFor purposes of property taxation, \r\n  each time share unit, operating under a â€œvacation time sharing ownership planâ€ \r\n  as defined in item (8) of  Â§  27-32-10, must be valued in the same manner as \r\n  if the unit were owned by a single owner.  The total cumulative purchase price \r\n  paid by the time-share owners for a unit may not be utilized by the tax assessorâ€™s \r\n  offices as a factor in determining the assessed value of the unit.  A unit operating \r\n  under a â€œvacation time sharing lease planâ€ as defined in item (9) of  Â§ 27-32-10, \r\n  may, however, be assessed the same as other income producing and investment \r\n  property.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-32-240 (1).\r\nBeaufort County construes the sentence â€œ[t]he assessment \r\n  of all property shall be equal and uniform in the following classificationsâ€ \r\n  in Â§ 1 as mandating the Legislature value property in each subset of the section \r\n  uniformly.  Beaufort County relies upon this Courtâ€™s previous decisions which \r\n  provide:  â€œThe word â€˜assessmentâ€™ used in the Constitution and the statutes means \r\n  â€˜the value placed upon property for the purposes of taxation by officials appointed \r\n  for that purpose.â€™â€  Meredith v. Elliot, 247 S.C. 335, 342, 147 S.E.2d \r\n  244, 247 (1966) (citing Owings Mills, Inc. v. Brady, 246 S.C. \r\n  361, 143 S.E.2d 717 (1965)); see also Simkins v. City of Spartanburg, \r\n  269 S.C. 243, 237 S.E.2d 69 (1977). \r\nBeaufort County avers this definition clarifies \r\n  the Constitution as requiring â€œ[t]he [value placed upon property for the purposes \r\n  of taxation] shall be equal and uniform in the following classifications. . \r\n  .â€  As such Beaufort County believes the Legislature cannot require a local \r\n  assessor to value similar property differently as is mandated by Â§ 27-32-240.\r\nThe ad valorem tax is a product \r\n  of three separate sets of numbers: the assessment ratio, the millage rate, and \r\n  the fair market value of the property.  Ad valorem taxes are calculated \r\n  by multiplying the fair market value of a property by its assessment ratio to \r\n  obtain the assessed value.  The assessed value is then multiplied by the millage \r\n  rate to determine the property tax owed.  Homeownerâ€™s Guide to Property Taxes \r\n  in South Carolina, South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue 3; see also \r\n  Newberry Mills Inc. v. Dawkins, 259 S.C. 7, 190 S.E.2d 503 (1972) (discussing \r\n  assessment ratio, millage rate, values and calculation of property tax).  \r\nThree separate entities establish the \r\n  three values.  The millage rate is determined by local government.  The South \r\n  Carolina Constitution prescribes the assessment ratio.  S.C. Const. art. X, \r\n  Â§ 1.  The Legislature is empowered to prescribe the method of valuation to determine \r\n  the fair market value of properties enumerated in Â§ 1.  See S.C. Const. \r\n  art. X, Â§ 2(a); South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n v. South Carolina Tax Bd. Of Rev., \r\n  305 S.C. 183, 407 S.E.2d 627 (1991) (Legislature is empowered to define value); \r\n  South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n v. South Carolina Tax Bd. Of Rev., 278 S.C. \r\n  556, 299 S.E.2d 489 (1983).\r\nSection 2 of Article X further confers \r\n  upon the Legislature the power to â€œdefine the classes of property and values \r\n  for property tax purposes of the classes of property set forth in Section 1.â€  \r\n  The section is logical only if read to allow the Legislature to define sub-classes \r\n  of property for those classes enumerated in Â§ 1 and to determine how each sub-class \r\n  is valued for tax purposes.  Section 2â€™s grant of legislative power to â€œdefine \r\n  the classes of propertyâ€ would be meaningless were the intent of Â§ 1 to treat \r\n  all types of real property the same for tax purposes.  Cf. Davis v. \r\n  County of Greenville, 322 S.C. 73, 470 S.E.2d 94 (1996) (â€œA statute must \r\n  receive such construction as will make all of its parts harmonize with each \r\n  other and render them consistent with its general scope and object.â€). \r\nSection 1 does not prohibit the Legislature from \r\n  requiring different types of real property be valued the same.  Instead, it \r\n  requires each category of property enumerated retain the same assessment ratio \r\n  as other property within its class.  In other words, the South Carolina Constitution \r\n  requires that an assessment ratio be applied to eight distinct classes of property, \r\n  and that this assessment ratio must be uniform and equal to property within \r\n  each class. The methodology to determine the value of the property remains \r\n  a matter for the General Assembly.\r\nBeaufort Countyâ€™s reliance on Meredith, \r\n  Owings Mills, and Simkins, is misplaced.  This Court in each case \r\n  interpreted a version of Article X since amended.  Under the previous Article \r\n  X, the Legislature classified property, set the valuation method and set assessment \r\n  rates.  See S.C. Const. art. X (1976) (â€œThe General Assembly shall provide \r\n  by law for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation, and shall prescribe \r\n  regulations to secure a just valuation for taxation of all property, real, personal \r\n  and possessory. . . .â€).  The amended Article X removed the Legislatureâ€™s ability \r\n  to set assessment rates in Â§ 1 while maintaining its power to classify property \r\n  for valuation purposes and to establish valuation methods under Â§ 2.\r\nMeredith, Owings Mill, and Simkins \r\n  must be viewed in light of the former Article X.  A closer reading of each opinion \r\n  reveals this Court did not use the term â€œassessmentâ€ to refer to the valuation \r\n  of property as Beaufort County insists.  Instead, the term was used generically \r\n  to refer to the three-step process to determine the taxable value of the property.  \r\n  Further, to read â€œassessmentâ€ to equal â€œvalueâ€ is to ignore the explicit grant \r\n  of power to the Legislature in Â§ 2 to â€œdefine the classes of property and values \r\n  for property tax purposes of the classes of property set forth in Section 1.â€  \r\n  S.C. Const. art. X, Â§ 1 (emphasis added).\r\nSection Â§ 27-32-240 does \r\n  not violate S.C. Const. art. X.  The Legislature is empowered to determine that \r\n  a â€œvacation time sharing ownership planâ€ is valued differently from a â€œvacation \r\n  time sharing lease planâ€ under the power granted by Â§ 2. [2]    \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we AFFIRM the circuit courtâ€™s order.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n     Both Beaufort County and the State moved for summary judgment.  Holtcamp \r\n    filed a motion supporting the Stateâ€™s motion and opposing Beaufort Countyâ€™s \r\n    motion.  The circuit court granted the motion of State and Holtcamp.  Beaufort \r\n    Countyâ€™s motion for reconsideration was denied.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    Additionally, Judge Thomas Kemmerlinâ€™s order correctly notes the intent of \r\n    the Legislature in enacting Â§ 27-32-240 was to statutorily prohibit the tax \r\n    assessor from stacking the purchase price paid for each week of time for each \r\n    time-share unit.  Instead, the Legislature required an assessor to value only \r\n    the underlying land and building itself.  In doing so, the Legislature mandated \r\n    that â€œtime-share units are to be valued for tax purposes at what a single \r\n    owner would pay for the unit, not the aggregate price paid by all owners.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Larry D.

The Court of Appeals held Petitioner South \r\n  Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Companyâ€™s (Farm Bureauâ€™s) policy was primary \r\n  and Respondent S.E.C.U.R.E. Underwriters Risk Retention Groupâ€™s (SECUREâ€™s) insurance \r\n  was excess.  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co. v. S.E.C.U.R.E. Underwriters \r\n  Risk Retention Group, 347 S.C. 333, 554 S.E.2d 870 (Ct. App. 2001).  We \r\n  reverse.  \r\nFACTS\r\nFarm Bureau issued a homeowners liability \r\n  policy to Ralph and Mary Garrison.  SECURE issued a commercial general liability \r\n  policy to the Garrisonsâ€™ pest control business.  The Garrisonsâ€™ pet dog bit \r\n  a child while on the premises of the pest control business.  Both insurance \r\n  companies denied coverage and asserted, if there was coverage, their coverage \r\n  was secondary. \r\nThe Court of Appeals held both policies covered the occurrence.  \r\n  In addition, it applied the â€œtotal policy insuring intentâ€ rule to conclude \r\n  Farm Bureauâ€™s policy provided primary coverage while SECUREâ€™s coverage was excess.  \r\n  Id.   We granted a writ of certiorari to review the  application of the \r\n  â€œtotal policy insuring intentâ€ rule. \r\n  [1]   \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals properly apply the â€œtotal \r\n  policy insuring intentâ€ rule to determine Farm Bureauâ€™s policy was primary and \r\n  SECUREâ€™s was excess?  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nFarm Bureau contends the Court of Appeals misapplied the \r\n  â€œtotal policy insuring intentâ€ rule established in South Carolina Ins. Co. \r\n  v. Fidelity and Guar. Ins. Underwriters, Inc., 327 S.C. 207, 489 S.E.2d \r\n  200 (1997) (Fidelity), to conclude its policy provided primary coverage \r\n  while SECUREâ€™s provided secondary coverage for the occurrence.  Farm Bureau \r\n  asserts because the policiesâ€™ â€œother insuranceâ€ clauses provide Farm Bureauâ€™s \r\n  coverage is excess while SECUREâ€™s is primary, the Court of Appeals erred by \r\n  holding otherwise.  We agree.    \r\n\r\nFarm Bureauâ€™s â€œother insuranceâ€ \r\n  clause provides:\r\nOther Insurance-Coverage E - Personal Liability. \r\nThis insurance is excess over other valid and collectible insurance except insurance written specifically to cover\r\nas excess over the limits of liability that apply in this policy. \r\nSECUREâ€™s â€œother insuranceâ€ clause provides:\r\nIf other valid and collectible insurance is available to \r\n  the insured for a loss we cover under Coverages A or B of this Coverage Part, our obligations \r\n  are limited as follows: \r\n  a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Primary Insurance\r\nThis insurance is primary except when b. below applies.\r\nIf this insurance is primary, our obligations are not affected unless any \r\n  of the other insurance is also primary.  Then, we will share with all that \r\n  other insurance by the method described in c. below.  \r\n  b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Excess Insurance\r\nThis insurance is excess over any of the other insurance, whether primary, \r\n  excess, contingent or any other basis:\r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is Fire, Extended Coverage, Builderâ€™s Risk, \r\n  Installation Risk or similar coverage for â€œyour workâ€;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is Fire Insurance for premises rented \r\n  to you; or\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the loss arises out of the maintenance or use \r\n  of aircraft, â€œautosâ€, or watercraft to the extent not subject to Exclusion g. \r\n  of Coverage A (Section I).\r\n  \r\nWhen this insurance is excess, we will have no duty \r\n  under Coverage A or B to defend any claim or â€œsuitâ€ that any other insurer has \r\n  a duty to defend.  If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, \r\n  but we will be entitled to the insuredâ€™s rights against all those other insurers.  \r\n\r\n  \r\nWhen this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share \r\n  of the amount of the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of:\r\n    \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total amount that all such other insurance \r\n  would pay for the loss in the absence of this insurance; and \r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts \r\n  under all that other insurance.\r\nWe will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is \r\n  not described in this Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically \r\n  to apply in excess of the Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations and \r\n  Coverage Part. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Method of Sharing\r\nIf all of the other insurance permits contribution \r\n  by equal shares, we will follow this method also.  Under this approach, each \r\n  insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of \r\n  insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever comes first.  If any of the \r\n  other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute \r\n  by limits.  Under this method, each insurerâ€™s share is based on the ratio of \r\n  its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance \r\n  of all insurers. \r\n\r\n(Underline added).\r\nIn Fidelity, id., the Court was \r\n  presented with the situation where two concurrent policies contained competing \r\n  â€œexcessâ€ â€œother insuranceâ€ clauses (i.e., the language of both policies declared \r\n  they were â€œexcessâ€ to other available coverage).  The Court agreed that, â€œin \r\n  many cases, â€˜excessâ€™ â€˜other insuranceâ€™ clauses should cancel each other out, \r\n  because two policies with such clauses cannot both be treated as â€˜excessâ€™ \r\n  policies,â€ but held the â€œtotal policy insuring intentâ€ should â€œalways remain \r\n  the central issue in apportioning liabilities among multiple insurers.â€  Id. \r\n  S.C. at 215, S.E.2d at 204 (italic in original).  Accordingly, the Court held \r\n  â€œother insuranceâ€ clauses constitute only one factor among many others to consider \r\n  in determining how to apportion liability.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Court held:  \r\n\r\nWe find that in determining whether a loss covered by multiple insurers should \r\n  be prorated, or whether one policy should be treated as an â€˜excessâ€™ policy, \r\n  courts in South Carolina should consider the â€˜total policy insuring intentâ€™ \r\n  based on all the language of the insurance policies at issue.  If two policies \r\n  both contain â€˜excessâ€™ clauses, but otherwise appear to provide for primary coverage, \r\n  the excess clauses should be disregarded, and the concurrently covered loss \r\n  prorated according to the policy limits of the respective policies.\r\n\r\nId. S.C. at 219, S.E.2d at 206 (underline added). \r\nThe Court of Appeals erred by applying \r\n  the â€œtotal policy insuring intentâ€ rule in this case.  According to Fidelity, \r\n  the â€œtotal policy insuring intentâ€ rule applies when a court is required to \r\n  determine liability among insurers when there are competing insurance \r\n  clauses. [2]   \r\nUnder the plain language of SECUREâ€™s â€œother insuranceâ€ \r\n  clause, its insurance is primary.  Under the plain language of Farm Bureauâ€™s \r\n  â€œother insuranceâ€ clause, its insurance is â€œexcess.â€  Because these two provisions \r\n  are not mutually repugnant, it was unnecessary to apply the â€œtotal policy insuring \r\n  intentâ€ rule to allocate priority between the two carriers. [3]   Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in \r\n  applying the â€œtotal policy insuring intentâ€ rule to hold Farm Bureauâ€™s policy \r\n  was primary while SECUREâ€™s policy was secondary.  \r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice J. Ernest Kinard, Jr., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Although it argued in its brief that the two insurance policies did not provide \r\n    concurrent coverage, SECURE did not petition the Court for a writ of certiorari \r\n    on this issue.  Accordingly, the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision that the polices \r\n    provided concurrent coverage is the law of the case.  State v. Barroso, \r\n    328 S.C. 268, 493 S.E.2d 854 (1997) (where party fails to challenge holding \r\n    by Court of Appeals, ruling is law of the case).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The underlying facts, language \r\n    of the opinion, and State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. LiMauro, 482 \r\n    N.E.2d 13 (N.Y. 1985), discussed at length in the decision, support this conclusion.  \r\n    In LiMauro, the New York Court of Appeals was required to determine \r\n    the priority of three automobile insurance policies.  As noted in Fidelity, \r\n    â€œ[o]ne of the policies indisputably provided primary coverage, so the New \r\n    York court only had to resolve whether the amount of the loss exceeding the \r\n    limits of the primary policy should be prorated between the other two insurers, \r\n    . . . .â€  Fidelity, S.C. at 216, S.E.2d at 204.            \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    In essence, the Court of Appeals applied the â€œtotal policy insuring intentâ€ \r\n    rule first to determine Farm Bureauâ€™s policy was primary, in spite of policy \r\n    language to the contrary, and, consequently, in conflict with the primary \r\n    nature of SECUREâ€™s policy.  It again applied the â€œtotal policy insuring intentâ€ \r\n    rule to conclude Farm Bureauâ€™s policy was primary because it contained a clause \r\n    specifically providing coverage for animal liability.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25603","title":"The Father v.

South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Serv., 345 S.C. \r\n  57, 545 S.E.2d 523 (Ct. App. 2001).  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent Department of Social Services (DSS) determined a child \r\n  abuse complaint against Father was â€œindicated.â€  Father initiated an administrative \r\n  appeal of this finding; [2]  DSS responded by preparing to \r\n  take the matter before the family court.  Before DSS commenced any action, Father \r\n  brought this action to have the â€œindicatedâ€ finding purged from DSSâ€™ records. \r\n\r\nFollowing a series of hearings and orders, the family court ordered \r\n  the â€œindicatedâ€ finding of abuse be changed to â€œunfoundedâ€ and awarded Father \r\n  $22,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees as a sanction pursuant to the FCPSA. [3]   DSS appealed this award, and Father cross-appealed \r\n  the denial of his request for sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP.\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that while the family court could award \r\n  sanctions under the FCPSA, the facts here did not warrant the $22,000 attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee.  The court reversed that award, and further held that Father was not entitled \r\n  to any Rule 11 relief.  The Father, supra.  This Court granted \r\n  Fatherâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.  We now affirm.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether permitting an attorneyâ€™s fee award under the FCPSA \r\n  is inconsistent with this Courtâ€™s decision in Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of \r\n  Soc. Serv. v. Little, 309 S.C. 122, 420 S.E.2d 499 (1992)?\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the proper appellate standard of review under \r\n  the FCPSA?\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that \r\n  the $22,000 award to Father was an abuse of discretion under its view of the \r\n  evidence?\r\n  4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether Rule 11, SCRCP, sanctions should be considered \r\n  in this case?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n1.  Did the Court of Appeals effectively overrule \r\n  Little?\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (Supp. 2002) permits a court \r\n  to tax attorneyâ€™s fees against a state agency if it concludes â€œthat the agency \r\n  acted without substantial justification in pressing its claimâ€¦â€  Â§15-77-300(1).  \r\n  This Attorneyâ€™s Fee Act specifically exempts certain types of suits from its \r\n  ambit, including child abuse and neglect actions.  After the Attorneyâ€™s Fee \r\n  Act became effective on July 1, 1985, the General Assembly amended the Family \r\n  Courtâ€™s general jurisdiction statute to provide â€œsuit money including attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, may be assessed for or against a party to an action brought in or subject \r\n  to the jurisdiction of the family court.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(38) (Supp. \r\n  2002).  In Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Services v. Little, supra, \r\n  this Court held that the Attorneyâ€™s Fee Act in Title 15, specifically prohibiting \r\n  an award of attorneyâ€™s fees against DSS in a child abuse action even where DSS \r\n  acted without substantial justification, prevailed over the general jurisdiction \r\n  statute in Title 20.\r\nDSS complains that the effect of the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in \r\n  this case, holding that attorneyâ€™s fees and court costs may be assessed against \r\n  DSS in a child abuse and neglect action under the FCPSA, effectively overrules \r\n  Little.  We disagree.\r\nThe Attorneyâ€™s Fee Act bars an award of attorneyâ€™s fees in a child \r\n  abuse and neglect case even where DSS has acted without â€œsubstantial justification.â€  \r\n  Â§ 15-77-300.  On the other hand, in order to receive attorneyâ€™s fees and/or \r\n  court costs as a sanction under the FCPSA, the aggrieved party must show that \r\n  the party sought to be sanctioned acted â€˜frivolously.â€™  See, e.g., Hanahan \r\n  v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903 (1997) (denial of summary judgment \r\n  precludes finding of frivolity, and thus no sanction may be imposed under the \r\n  FCPSA).  A party who makes a â€˜frivolousâ€™ claim or raises a â€˜frivolousâ€™ defense \r\n  has committed a more egregious act than one who merely acts â€˜without substantial \r\n  justification.â€™  See Heath v. Aiken County, 302 S.C. 178, 394 \r\n  S.E.2d 709 (1990) (â€œA court need not go so far as to brand a claim â€˜frivolousâ€™ \r\n  in order for it to be found to be without substantial justificationâ€).\r\nThe General Assembly specifically exempted DSS from liability for  \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees when it acts without substantial justification in a child abuse \r\n  and neglect action.  Â§ 15-77-300.  When the legislature enacted the FCPSA, and \r\n  authorized the award of sanctions in the form of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs against \r\n  any party, including governmental entities, \r\n  [4]  found to have pursued frivolous litigation, it included no such exception.  \r\n  We are required to interpret these statutes as written.  By their plain terms, \r\n  the statutes exempt DSS from the payment of attorneyâ€™s fees where its pursuit \r\n  of a child abuse and neglect action was merely without substantial justification, \r\n  but do not exempt the agency from the possibility of sanctions in the form of \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and/or court costs where its actions rise to the level of frivolity.  \r\n  See, e.g., Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000) \r\n  (Court bound to give effect to legislatureâ€™s intent as expressed in plain and \r\n  unambiguous statutory language).  It is not for this Court to second-guess the \r\n  wisdom of these decisions made by the General Assembly.  E.g., Keyserling \r\n  v. Beasley, 322 S.C. 83, 86, 470 S.E.2d 100, 101 (1996).\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that attorneyâ€™s fees and/or court \r\n  costs may be awarded against DSS in an abuse and neglect case pursuant \r\n  to the FCPSA.  Nothing in this decision undermines or conflicts with our decision \r\n  in Little that attorneyâ€™s fees are not awardable against DSS in a child \r\n  abuse and neglect action pursuant to the Attorneyâ€™s Fee Act.\r\n2.  What is the proper standard \r\n  of appellate review of an award made pursuant to the FCPSA?\r\nWe granted Father permission to argue against precedent which holds \r\n  that the decision whether to award sanctions under the FCPSA is a matter in \r\n  equity, entitling the appellate court to take its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.  Kilcawley v. Kilcawley, 312 S.C. 425, 440 S.E.2d 892 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1994) cited with approval in Hanahan v. Simpson, supra.  \r\n  Father argues we should substitute an â€œabuse of discretionâ€ standard.  We adhere \r\n  to precedent.\r\nThe decision to impose \r\n  a sanction under the FCPSA is to â€œbe determined by the trial judge at the conclusion \r\n  of a trialâ€¦.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-30 (Supp. 2002).  Since the decision whether \r\n  to impose sanctions under the FCPSA is a decision for the judge, not the jury, \r\n  it sounds in equity rather than at law.  Cf. Flagstar Corp. v. Royal \r\n  Surplus Lines, 341 S.C. 68, 533 S.E.2d 331 (2000) (noting right to trial \r\n  by jury in law case).  Pursuant to the South Carolina Constitution, an appellate \r\n  court reviews findings of fact in an equity matter taking its own view of the \r\n  evidence.  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 5; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 \r\n  (Supp. 2002).\r\nFather argues that the \r\n  United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Cooter and Gell v. Hartmax Corp., \r\n  496 U.S. 384, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), setting forth the federal \r\n  appellate standard of reviewing a sanction award pursuant to Rule 11, FRCP, \r\n  applies by analogy and requires this Court to alter our scope of review.  We \r\n  disagree.\r\n\r\nIn Cooter and Gell, the \r\n  Supreme Court explained:\r\nIf the district courtâ€™s account \r\n  of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, \r\n  the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been \r\n  sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.  \r\n  Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact-finderâ€™s choice \r\n  cannot be clearly erroneousâ€¦.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the federal courts \r\n  employ a more deferential standard of review is not mandated by the federal \r\n  constitution, and thus our constitutional standard applies.  So long as sanctions \r\n  are decided by a judge and not a jury, the South Carolina Constitution mandates \r\n  an appellate court take its own view of the facts.  S.C. Const art. V, Â§ 5.\r\nThe â€œabuse of discretionâ€ \r\n  standard urged by Father does, however, play a role in the appellate review \r\n  of a sanctions award.  An abuse of discretion occurs where the decision is controlled \r\n  by an error of law or is based on unsupported factual conclusions.  See, \r\n  e.g., Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assoc., 346 S.C. 580, 553 S.E.2d 110 \r\n  (2001) (emphasis supplied).  For example, where the appellate court agrees with \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact, it reviews the decision to award sanctions, \r\n  as well as the terms of those sanctions, under an abuse of discretion standard.  \r\n  Cf., McDowell v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Serv., 304 S.C. \r\n  509, 405 S.E.2d 830 (1991) (in reviewing attorneyâ€™s fee sanction imposed pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300, appellate court looks to whether acts of party \r\n  sanctioned had reasonable basis in law and fact).\r\nWe adhere to our constitutionally mandated scope \r\n  of review.\r\n3.  Whether the Court of Appeals \r\n  committed errors in setting aside the $22,000 sanction based on its view of \r\n  the evidence?\r\nWe have reviewed the record in this matter, the family courtâ€™s order, \r\n  and the opinion of the Court of Appeals.  We find that while DSSâ€™s conduct in \r\n  this matter was flawed in some respects, Father did not meet his burden of proving \r\n  that DSS acted without a proper purpose in this case.  Â§ 15-36-20.  We agree \r\n  with the Court of Appealsâ€™ view of the evidence, and therefore affirm the decision \r\n  setting aside the FCPSA sanction.\r\n4.  Whether Rule 11, SCRCP, sanctions should be considered \r\n  in this matter? \r\nThe Court of Appeals held that the â€œcriteria for Rule 11 sanctions \r\n  are essentially the same as those for sanctions under the [FCPSA] Act.â€  The \r\n  Father v. DSS,  345 S.C. at 72, 545 S.E.2d at 531.  Accordingly, it held \r\n  that since Father could not prevail under the FCPSA, the family court committed \r\n  no error in failing to sanction DSS pursuant to the Rule. [5]   Id.  Father contends this was error.  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the standard for sanctions \r\n  under Rule 11 is essentially the same as that of the FCPSA.  Compare \r\n  Runyon v. Wright, 322 S.C. 15, 471 S.E.2d 160 (1996) (Rule 11 sanction \r\n  for frivolous filing or argument, or for bad faith filing) with Pool \r\n  v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 467 S.E.2d 753 (Ct. App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified, \r\n  329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998) (standard for FCPSA sanction is frivolity).  \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that there is no basis \r\n  to remand the case to the family court for consideration of Fatherâ€™s request \r\n  for Rule 11 sanctions.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons given above, the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals reversing the award of sanctions to Father is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  Henry F. Floyd, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-36-10 to -50 (Supp. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  See S.C. Code Ann.

Richardson, Jr. and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nGeorge M. Hearn, Jr., of Hearn, Brittain &amp; Martin, P.A., of Conway; and \r\n  Sally Wiggins Speth, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   Respondent and \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to accept \r\n  an admonition or a public reprimand.  We accept the agreement and issue a public \r\n  reprimand.\r\nAccording to the facts stated in the agreement, respondent \r\n  represented the purchaser in a real estate transaction.  Respondent was out \r\n  of town on the date of the closing.  \r\nPrior to leaving town, respondent caused to be prepared a HUD-1 settlement \r\n  statement, as well as several other closing documents, which he personally reviewed.  \r\n  However, the HUD-1 statement was actually signed for him by a paralegal, who \r\n  signed at respondent's direction and with his permission, on the date of the \r\n  closing.  The paralegal did not include a notation adjacent to respondent's \r\n  signature indicating her authority to sign on his behalf.  \r\nThe closing was conducted by the paralegal without respondent or another attorney \r\n  present.  Respondent maintains he remained accessible to the paralegal by telephone \r\n  throughout the closing.  He also maintains other attorneys in his law firm were \r\n  available and could have responded to any inquiries that may have arisen at \r\n  the closing.\r\nRespondent admits that he has allowed other real estate transactions or closings \r\n  to be conducted outside his presence and that the transactions and closings \r\n  were conducted by non-lawyer personnel who were instructed to contact respondent \r\n  by telephone if necessary.  Respondent now recognizes that either he or another \r\n  licensed attorney should have been physically present to conduct the actual \r\n  real estate transactions and closings.  Respondent states he has modified the \r\n  methods employed in his law practice to institute such a policy.\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall \r\n  provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2(a) (a lawyer shall abide \r\n  by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and shall \r\n  consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule \r\n  5.3(a) (a partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that \r\n  the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that a non-lawyer \r\n  assistant's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer); \r\n  Rule 5.3(b) (a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer \r\n  assistant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct \r\n  is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer); Rule 5.5(b) \r\n  (a lawyer shall not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance \r\n  of an activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); and Rule \r\n  8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate or attempt to \r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another \r\n  to do so, or do so through the acts of others).  By violating the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct, respondent has also violated Rule 7(a)(1) of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nWe agree with the finding of improper conduct and find that a public reprimand \r\n  is the appropriate sanction.  Accordingly, respondent is hereby reprimanded \r\n  for the conduct detailed above.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to state that we view with alarm the growing \r\n  tendency of attorneys to allow support staff to perform functions which should \r\n  be performed by attorneys.  We caution members of the Bar that this practice \r\n  dilutes the attorney-client relationship and diminishes the attorney's ability \r\n  to monitor all aspects of a case for which the attorney is ultimately responsible.  \r\n  We further direct the Bar's attention, once again, to In re Easler, 275 \r\n  S.C. 400, 272 S.E.2d 32 (1980), in which this Court set forth guidelines with \r\n  regard to the role of paralegals in assisting attorneys, and to State v. \r\n  Buyer's Service Co., Inc., 292 S.C. 426, 357 S.E.2d 15 (1987), in which \r\n  this Court held that real estate closings should be conducted only under the \r\n  supervision of attorneys.  We encourage members of the Bar to review these cases \r\n  as well as the provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct cited above which \r\n  address the delegation of functions to support staff.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25606","title":"Hendricks v.

Anderson, of Anderson Law Firm, P.A., of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Petitioner, Clemson University (\"Clemson\"), appeals from the\r\nCourt of Appeals' reversal of summary judgment for Clemson.  \r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nRespondent, R.J. Hendricks, II (\"Hendricks\") was \r\n  recruited out of high school by several colleges to play baseball. He received \r\n  a scholarship from St. Leo College, a Division II school in Florida, and chose \r\n  to attend St. Leo because it was closest to home. In his junior year at St. \r\n  Leo, Hendricks received permission to talk with Division I schools about transferring \r\n  in order to play baseball for a Division I team in his final year of eligibility. \r\n  Hendricks's father contacted Tim Corbin (\"Corbin\"), assistant coach at Clemson, \r\n  to inquire about a transfer for his son. \r\n  (1) Clemson pursued a one-time transfer exception for Hendricks from the \r\n  NCAA, and Hendricks applied for admission and was accepted by Clemson. \r\n  (2) Hendricks received a book scholarship for approximately $200 to $250, \r\n  but no other scholarship, athletic or otherwise, from Clemson.\r\nAt the time of his transfer, Hendricks had earned \r\n  80 of the 130 credit hours required for the \r\n \r\n degree he was pursuing at St. Leo \r\n  in Business Administration, with a cluster in Restaurant and Hotel Management. \r\n  Clemson did not offer the same major. When Hendricks decided to transfer to \r\n  Clemson, he knew he would have to return to St. Leo for a final semester (in \r\n  essence, for an extra semester) in order to graduate from St. Leo with his original \r\n  major.\r\nSometime in August, prior to registration, Hendricks \r\n  met with the athletic academic advisor assigned to him by Clemson's Student-Athlete \r\n  Enrichment Program, Barbara Kennedy-Dixon (\"Kennedy-Dixon\"). As Clemson did \r\n  not offer Hendricks's major, Kennedy-Dixon advised Hendricks to declare himself \r\n  a Speech and Communications major. Pursuant to her advice, Hendricks enrolled \r\n  in fifteen hours for the fall semester. A week and a half into the semester, \r\n  however, Kennedy-Dixon realized she had not evaluated whether Hendricks was \r\n  in compliance with the NCAA's fifty-percent rule, which required a student athlete \r\n  to complete at least fifty percent of the course requirements toward his major \r\n  to be eligible to compete during his fourth year of college enrollment. Recognizing \r\n  her mistake, Kennedy-Dixon advised Hendricks to drop one class and add two speech \r\n  classes, increasing his credit hours from fifteen to eighteen. Hendricks changed \r\n  his classes as advised. Kennedy-Dixon discussed the mistake with her graduate \r\n  assistant, but did not report it to the director of the program. A few days \r\n  before the end of the semester, Kennedy-Dixon realized that she had miscalculated \r\n  the total number of electives Hendricks could take and, consequently, that he \r\n  would not comply with the NCAA's fifty percent rule.  \r\n  (3)  \r\nUpon discovering her mistake, Kennedy-Dixon filed \r\n  a waiver application with the NCAA in which she claimed responsibility for Hendricks's \r\n  failure to satisfy the rule, and requested that the NCAA waive the rule to allow \r\n  Hendricks to play baseball. The NCAA denied the appeal. Hendricks passed all \r\n  of his fall course hours and remained at Clemson for the spring semester, but \r\n  was not allowed to play baseball. He returned to St. Leo the next fall without \r\n  a scholarship as planned. Hendricks graduated on schedule in December, but stayed \r\n  on at St. Leo for the spring semester to play baseball because he had not used \r\n  his final year of eligibility.\r\nClemson won the NCAA regional title that spring \r\n  and went to the College World Series. In his deposition, Clemson's head coach, \r\n  Coach Leggett, stated there was no limit on the number of players allowed on \r\n  the non-traveling team, but that the traveling team was limited to 25 players. \r\n  Based on Hendricks's performance in fall practice, Coach Leggett testified it \r\n  would have been very hard for Hendricks to make the traveling team. Coach Leggett \r\n  met with Hendricks at the end of the fall semester (before he was aware Hendricks \r\n  was ineligible) and explained to him that there were 3 players ahead of him \r\n  in the line-up for both of the positions Hendricks played, catcher and first \r\n  base.\r\nIn her deposition, Kennedy-Dixon admitted her mistakes \r\n  were likely caused by personal stress she was experiencing at the time. She \r\n  gave birth to a premature baby in June (before advising Hendricks in August), \r\n  and was traveling to Greenville daily to visit her baby who remained in neonatal \r\n  intensive care until October of Hendricks's first semester at Clemson. Kennedy-Dixon \r\n  described the purpose of her job as follows: \"We have a two-fold purpose . . \r\n  . . We try to help our students maintain academic excellence and certainly to \r\n  make sure that they remain academically eligible according to the NCAA and graduate.\" \r\n  \r\nHendricks sued Clemson for negligence, breach of \r\n  fiduciary duty, and breach of contract for Kennedy-Dixon's mistakes that made \r\n  him ineligible to play baseball at Clemson. The trial court granted Clemson's \r\n  motion for summary judgment on all causes of action. The Court of Appeals reversed \r\n  summary judgment, finding that genuine issues of material fact existed regarding \r\n  the viability of each of Hendricks's causes of action. Hendricks v. Clemson \r\n  Univ., 339 S.C. 552, 529 S.E.2d 293 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nClemson raises the following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the Court of Appeals err in finding there \r\n  was a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a duty to support \r\n  Hendricks's negligence claim?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n       Did the Court of Appeals err in finding there \r\n  was a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a fiduciary \r\n  duty between Kennedy-Dixon and Hendricks, as advisor and student?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.\r\n       Did the Court of Appeals err in finding a \r\n  genuine issue of fact regarding the existence of a contract between Hendricks \r\n  and Clemson?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      IV.\r\n       Did the Court of Appeals err in partially reversing \r\n  the trial court's holding that Hendricks suffered no measurable damages?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;Law/Analysis\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is \r\n  no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law. Hamiter v. Retirement Div. of South Carolina Budget \r\n  and Control Bd., 326 S.C. 93, 484 S.E.2d 586 (1997). In determining whether \r\n  any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.\r\nI. Negligence\r\nClemson argues the Court of Appeals erred when \r\n  it found Kennedy-Dixon's actions did not amount to gross negligence as a matter \r\n  of law, and reversed summary judgment for Clemson. We agree that the Court of \r\n  Appeals erred in reversing summary judgment on this issue, and find that summary \r\n  judgment was appropriate on the additional ground that Clemson owed no duty \r\n  to Hendricks.\r\nBoth the trial court and Court of Appeals agree \r\n  that the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (\"Tort Claims Act\") shields Clemson, \r\n  as a state-supported university, from liability for loss resulting from \"responsibility \r\n  or duty including but not limited to supervision, protection, control, confinement, \r\n  or custody of any student . . . except when the responsibility or duty is exercised \r\n  in a grossly negligent manner.\" \r\n  (4) The Court of Appeals discussed gross negligence at length and then addressed \r\n  Clemson's claim that it had no duty to ensure students' athletic eligibility. \r\n  Citing Kennedy-Dixon's description of her job duties and the proposition \r\n  that if an act is voluntarily undertaken, the actor assumes the duty to use \r\n  slight care, the Court of Appeals found there was at least a factual dispute \r\n  as to whether Clemson undertook the duty to advise Hendricks concerning compliance \r\n  with NCAA eligibility standards. Hendricks, 339 S.C. 552, 560-561, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 293, 297 (citing Miller v. City of Camden, 329 S.C. 310, \r\n  494 S.E.2d 813 (1997) (discussing assumption of duty by voluntary undertaking)).\r\n\"The determination of the existence of a duty is \r\n  solely the responsibility of the court.\" Miller, 329 S.C. 310, 494 \r\n  S.E.2d 813 (citing Ellis v. Niles, 324 S.C. 223, 479 S.E.2d 47 (1996). \r\n  Whether the law recognizes a particular duty is an issue of law to be decided \r\n  by the Court. Id. (citing Carson v. Adgar, 326 S.C. 212, 486 \r\n  S.E.2d 3 (1997)). An affirmative legal duty exists only if created by statute, \r\n  contract, relationship, status, property interest, or some other special circumstance. \r\n  Carson. Ordinarily, the common law imposes no duty on a person to act. \r\n  Where an act is voluntarily undertaken, however, the actor assumes the duty \r\n  to use due care. Id. (citing Russell v. City of Columbia, \r\n  305 S.C. 86, 406 S.E.2d 338 (1991)). \r\nHendricks's argument that Clemson affirmatively \r\n  assumed a duty of care when it advised him on which courses to take in order \r\n  to obtain NCAA eligibility does not fit into any of the causes of action previously \r\n  recognized in South Carolina. Under these circumstances, the Court must determine \r\n  whether the law will recognize a new duty of care between advisor and student.\r\nEllis.  \r\nIn considering the same question, a California \r\n  court found the issue of duty to be close, but leaned toward finding no duty \r\n  due to significant policy concerns. Brown v. Compton Unified Sch. Dist.,80 \r\n  Cal. Rptr. 2d. 171 (Cal. App. 1998). California represents the position of the \r\n  majority of states in refusing to recognize the tort of \"educational malpractice\" \r\n  in claims brought by students alleging they received an inadequate education. \r\n  Peter W. v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., 131 Cal. Rptr. 854 (Cal. \r\n  App. 1976) (seminal case); Ross v. Creighton Univ., 957 F.2d 1140 (1992) \r\n  (considering Illinois state law and citing cases from eleven other states that \r\n  have considered and rejected educational malpractice claims). Courts addressing \r\n  inadequate education claims, identify several policy concerns with recognizing \r\n  an actionable duty of care owed from educators to students: (1) the lack of \r\n  a satisfactory standard of care by which to evaluate educators, (2) the inherent \r\n  uncertainties of the cause and nature of damages, and (3) the potential for \r\n  a flood of litigation against already beleaguered schools. Peter \r\n  W.; Ross.  \r\nAlthough Hendricks is not alleging he received \r\n  an inadequate education while at Clemson, his claim regarding his advisor's \r\n  negligence should fail for the same reasons courts have refused to recognize \r\n  a duty in inadequate education cases. In Brown v. Compton Unified Sch. Dist., \r\n  a high school student sued his school for negligently advising him on which \r\n  classes to take, resulting in his being ineligible to play basketball at the \r\n  University of Southern California, and, consequently, in him losing his basketball \r\n  scholarship from that university. 80 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 172. Although \r\n  the court recognized his damages (the loss of the scholarship) were more readily \r\n  identifiable than in the normal educational malpractice claim, the court gave \r\n  great weight to the policy considerations discussed above. Id. Ultimately, \r\n  the court found the school immune based on a statute granting immunity to public \r\n  employees for negligent misrepresentations, but its analysis, recognizing the \r\n  dangers of imposing a duty on student advisors, is instructive in this case. \r\n  Id. at 173.\r\nWe believe recognizing a duty flowing from advisors \r\n  to students is not required by any precedent and would be unwise, considering \r\n  the great potential for embroiling schools in litigation that such recognition \r\n  would create. Further, the Court of Appeals citation to Miller, indicating \r\n  a duty may have been created by Clemson's voluntary undertaking to advise Hendricks \r\n  to ensure NCAA eligibility, is inapposite. 329 S.C. 310, 494 S.E.2d 813. The \r\n  line of cases Miller discusses have thus far been limited to situations \r\n  in which a party has voluntarily undertaken to prevent physical harm, not economic \r\n  injury. \r\nBecause we find Clemson did not owe a duty to Hendricks, \r\n  it is unnecessary to discuss whether Kennedy-Dixon's mistakes could \r\n  amount to gross negligence as required for recovery under the Tort Claims Act. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(25).\r\nII. Fiduciary Duty\r\nHendricks argues there is a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact regarding whether Clemson owed him a fiduciary duty. We disagree.\r\nWhether there is a fiduciary relationship between \r\n  two people is an equitable issue. Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 \r\n  S.C. 595, 358 S.E.2d 150 (Ct. App. 1987). Generally, legal issues are for the \r\n  determination of the jury and equitable issues are for the determination of \r\n  the court. Id. \"A confidential or fiduciary relationship exists when \r\n  one imposes a special confidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and \r\n  good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests \r\n  of the one imposing the confidence.\" O'Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, \r\n  15, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1992) (citing Island Car Wash, 292 S.C. \r\n  at 599, 358 S.E.2d at 152). This Court has recognized certain relationships \r\n  are by nature fiduciary, such as the attorney client relationship. O'Shea. \r\n  The relationship between advisor and student has not been so recognized \r\n  thus far. \r\nAlthough whether a fiduciary relationship has been \r\n  breached can be a question for the jury, the question of whether one should \r\n  be imposed between two classes of people is a question for the court. The Court \r\n  of Appeals cites Hotz v. Minyard for the proposition that the existence \r\n  of a fiduciary duty may be a factual question for the jury. 304 S.C. 225, 403 \r\n  S.E.2d 634 (1991). In our opinion, they have misapprehended Hotz. In \r\n  that case, the plaintiff alleged breach of a fiduciary duty by an attorney who \r\n  had represented both her and her father. Id. The Court found evidence \r\n  of the existence of a confidential, on-going attorney client relationship between \r\n  plaintiff and the attorney, and then held there was a factual issue presented \r\n  whether the attorney had breached a fiduciary duty under the circumstances \r\n  presented. Id. The Court sent the issue of breach, not the existence \r\n  of the relationship, to the jury. Id.\r\nHistorically, this Court has reserved imposition \r\n  of fiduciary duties to legal or business settings, often in which one person \r\n  entrusts money to another, such as with lawyers, brokers, corporate directors, \r\n  and corporate promoters. We decline to recognize the relationship between advisor \r\n  and student as a fiduciary one. \r\nIII. Breach of Contract\r\nHendricks argues there is at least a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact regarding the existence of a contract between him and Clemson. \r\n  We disagree. \r\nA contract is formed between two people when one \r\n  gives the other sufficient consideration either to perform or refrain from performing \r\n  a particular act. Benya v. Gamble, 282 S.C. 624, 321 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1984). Offer and acceptance are essential to the formation of a contract. \r\n  Id. (citing Pierce v. Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co., 444 \r\n  F. Supp. 1098 (D.S.C. 1978). If the evidence is conflicting or raises more than \r\n  one reasonable inference, the issue should be submitted to the jury. Benya.\r\nFor support, Hendricks and the Court of Appeals \r\n  cite cases from several jurisdictions that have acknowledged the possibility \r\n  that \"the relationship between a student and a university is at least in part \r\n  contractual.\" Carr v. St. John's University, 17 A.D. 632 (N.Y.A.D. \r\n  1962), affirmed without opinion, 187 N.E.2d 18 (N.Y. 1962). Many of \r\n  these cases involve disputes between student athletes and their schools. Ross \r\n  v. Creighton Univ., 957 F.2d 410 (7th Cir. 1992); Taylor v. Wake Forest \r\n  Univ., 191 S.E.2d 379 (N.C. App. 1972). Other cases involve claims related \r\n  to the quality of the education received by the student. Cencor, Inc. v. \r\n  Tolman, 868 P.2d 396 (Colo. 1994); Wickstrom v. North Idaho College, \r\n  725 P.2d 155 (Idaho 1986). \r\nAll of these cases, however, recognize that not \r\n  all aspects of the student/university relationship are subject to a contract \r\n  remedy. Cencor, 868 P.2d 396; Ross, 957 F.2d 410. Just \r\n  as courts have prohibited recovery in tort for educational malpractice claims, \r\n  courts have been equally reluctant to permit claims relating to academic qualifications \r\n  of students or to the quality of education received when they are brought in \r\n  contract. In barring contract actions for educational malpractice claims, courts \r\n  have noted that the policy concerns that preclude those claims in tort apply \r\n  with equal force when the claim is brought in contract. In Ross, a \r\n  student athlete sued the university alleging that the university accepted him \r\n  knowing he was not qualified academically to participate in its curriculum, \r\n  and made a specific promise to provide certain services to him to enable him \r\n  to participate meaningfully in the academic curriculum. Ross, 957 F.2d \r\n  at 411-12. The court allowed the claim to proceed as a breach of contract action, \r\n  but made clear that the lower court would not reach the question of whether \r\n  the university had provided deficient academic services. Id. \r\n  at 417. The court limited the inquiry to a determination of whether the university \r\n  had provided any real access to its academic curriculum at all. Id.  \r\nIn Cencor, the court adhered to the same \r\n  distinction, delineating between subjective and objective claims. In that case, \r\n  the plaintiffs asserted that certain provisions of their enrollment agreements \r\n  and the school's catalog constituted express contract terms. Cencor, \r\n  868 P.2d at 399. The court allowed plaintiffs' breach of contract claims to \r\n  go forward to the extent it referenced \"specific services for which the [plaintiffs] \r\n  allegedly paid and which Cencor allegedly failed to provide.\" The court placed \r\n  no value on the plaintiffs' general allegations that they had not received the \r\n  education they had been promised, and instead made clear that the claim was \r\n  proceeding based on the plaintiffs' allegations that Cencor had obligated itself \r\n  to provide such tangible things as modern equipment and computer training for \r\n  all students. 868 P.2d at 400. \r\nClemson admits that some aspects of the student/university \r\n  relationship are indeed contractual, but argues Hendricks has not pointed to \r\n  an identifiable contractual promise that Clemson failed to honor in this case. \r\n  We agree. Hendricks fails to point to any written promise from Clemson to ensure \r\n  his athletic eligibility, and submits no real evidence to support his claim \r\n  that such a promise was implied. He did not discuss NCAA academic eligibility \r\n  until he was already enrolled at Clemson. His conversations with Kennedy-Dixon \r\n  in June, according to both his deposition and Kennedy-Dixon's deposition, were \r\n  limited to what major would most easily transfer back to St. Leo. \r\nHendricks's claim calls for an adjudication of \r\n  the deficiency of Clemson's services. As such, allowing Hendricks's \r\n  claim to proceed would invite courts to engage in just the type of subjective \r\n  analysis that courts prohibiting educational malpractice claims in tort and \r\n  contract have avoided. \r\nIV. Damages\r\nAs discussed, we find no actionable duty or contract \r\n  existed under the circumstances presented. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to \r\n  address Hendricks' claim for damages.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE \r\n  the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court's grant of summary judgment \r\n  in favor of Clemson on all causes of action.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n1.  Hendricks and \r\n  his father knew Corbin because Corbin attempted to recruit Hendricks out of \r\n  high school to play for Presbyterian College, where Corbin was coaching at the \r\n  time.&nbsp; \r\n 2. The NCAA \r\n  has a one-time transfer rule that permits students to transfer one time during \r\n  their college career to another school without having to sit out for a year \r\n  after being released from the previous school.3. \r\n  Hendricks had only twenty-one hours of electives available, rather than the \r\n  thirty-two calculated by Kennedy-Dixon, due to certain foreign language requirements \r\n  that Hendricks had not met. Accordingly, six of Hendricks' eighteen hours were \r\n  excess electives, and he did not meet the fifty percent rule. To comply with \r\n  the fifty percent rule, Hendricks needed to take twenty hours toward his Speech \r\n  and Communications major in the fall semester.\r\n\r\n4.  S.C. Code Ann.

Justice, \r\n  of Chester; for petitioner.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia; for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition \r\n  for a writ of certiorari to determine whether the Court of Appeals improperly \r\n  vacated respondentâ€™s assault convictions.  State v. Wilkes, 346 S.C. \r\n  67, 550 S.E.2d 332 (Ct. App. 2001).  We reverse the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was indicted on one count of resisting arrest and two counts of \r\n  assault on a correctional facility employee.  He was convicted as charged and \r\n  sentenced to one year imprisonment for resisting arrest, two years consecutive \r\n  for the first assault, and three years consecutive for the second assault.  \r\n  Respondent appealed on the basis the indictments on the two counts of assault \r\n  on a correctional facility employee were insufficient to confer jurisdiction \r\n  on the trial court.\r\nThe body of one indictment reads:  â€œThat Leroy Wilkes did in Chester County \r\n  on or about April 24, 1999[,] assault Officer Marilyn K. Givens while she was \r\n  attempting to process him after his arrest.â€  The other indictment is identically \r\n  worded, except it names a different victim, Eric Schmid.  One indictment is \r\n  captioned:  â€œASSAULT ON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY EMPLOYEE Â§ 16-3-630.â€ [1]   The other is captioned:  â€œASSAULT ON CORRECTIONAL \r\n  OFFICER.â€  Both indictments contain a title of the charge in the body of the \r\n  indictment that states:  â€œASSAULT ON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY EMPLOYEE Â§ 16-3-630.â€\r\nA majority of the Court of Appeals vacated the two assault convictions, finding \r\n  the indictments did not contain a necessary element of the offense of assault \r\n  upon a correctional facility employee because the officers were not identified \r\n  as correctional facility employees in the body of the indictments.  The court \r\n  ruled the term â€œofficerâ€ was insufficient because the term could have referred \r\n  to the arresting officer and not the correctional facility employee.  The court, \r\n  citing State v. Tabory, 262 S.C. 136, 202 S.E.2d 852 (1974), further \r\n  found the State could not rely on the caption of the indictments to bolster \r\n  the fatally deficient indictments.\r\nChief Judge Hearn dissented.  She found the indictments, viewed as \r\n  a whole, were sufficient to confer jurisdiction because, while the body of the \r\n  indictments did not allege the officers were correctional facility employees, \r\n  that fact was so indicated by the caption and title of the indictments.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWere the indictments for assault on a correctional facility \r\n  employee sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the trial court?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  A circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction to convict a defendant of \r\n  an offense if there is an indictment that sufficiently states the offense, the \r\n  defendant waives presentment, or the offense is a lesser-included offense of \r\n  the crime charged in the indictment.  Brown v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 540 \r\n  S.E.2d 846 (2001).  An indictment is sufficient if it apprises the defendant \r\n  of the elements of the offense intended to be charged and apprises the defendant \r\n  what he must be prepared to meet.  Granger v. State, 333 S.C. 2, 507 \r\n  S.E.2d 322 (1998).  Further, an indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated \r\n  with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what \r\n  judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer \r\n  and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon.  Browning v. \r\n  State, 320 S.C. 366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995).\r\nWe find the indictments, as a whole, were sufficient to confer jurisdiction \r\n  upon the trial court.  The indictments apprised respondent of the elements of \r\n  the offense intended to be charged and apprised him of what he must be prepared \r\n  to meet.  See Granger v. State, supra.  The bodies of the \r\n  indictments indicate that respondent assaulted an officer while the officer \r\n  was attempting to process him after his arrest.  This language is substantially \r\n  in the language of Â§ 16-3-630 which defines the offense charged.  See \r\n  State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 275 S.E.2d 878 (1981) (indictment phrased \r\n  substantially in language of statute which creates and defines offense is ordinarily \r\n  sufficient).  The captions indicate the victim was a correctional facility employee \r\n  or cite Â§ 16-3-630.  Both indictments contain titles of the charge in the bodies \r\n  that state the victim was a correctional facility employee and both cite Â§ 16-3-630.  \r\n  The indictments clearly stated the offense with sufficient certainty and particularity \r\n  to enable the trial court to know what judgment to pronounce and respondent \r\n  to know what he was being called upon to answer.  See Browning v. \r\n  State, supra.\r\nWe disagree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ reading of State v. Tabory, \r\n  supra, that the caption of an indictment cannot be relied upon to confer \r\n  jurisdiction upon the trial court.  In Tabory, the Court held that â€œthe \r\n  State may not support a conviction for an offense intended to be charged by \r\n  relying upon a caption to the exclusion of the language contained in the \r\n  body of the indictment.â€  Tabory, 262 S.C. at 141, 202 S.E.2d at \r\n  854 (emphasis added).  In this case, the State is not relying on the captions \r\n  of the indictments to the exclusion of the language contained in the bodies \r\n  of the indictments.  Tabory does not hold that the caption of an indictment \r\n  may not be considered when, as here, it is consistent with the charging language, \r\n  nor does it prohibit the court from looking at the title of an indictment when \r\n  scrutinizing the indictment for legal sufficiency.\r\nBecause the indictments were sufficient, the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  by vacating respondentâ€™s convictions for assault on a correctional facility \r\n  employee.\r\nREVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice James R. \r\n  Barber, III, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] S.C.

Peeples, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25608\r\nHeard February 19, 2003 - Filed March \r\n  24, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nPaul Andrew Anderson, of Maxwell &amp; Anderson, of Aiken; for appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Deputy Attorney General Treva Ashworth, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, and Assistant Attorney General \r\n  Steven R. Heckler, all of Columbia; for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  Appellant, previously committed \r\n  pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-10 to \r\n  -170 (2002), appeals the circuit courtâ€™s finding there was no probable cause \r\n  to believe his mental abnormality or personality disorder had so changed that \r\n  he was safe to be at large and was not likely to commit acts of sexual violence.  \r\n  We affirm.\r\nPROCEDURAL FACTS\r\nIn 1994, appellant pled guilty to first-degree criminal sexual conduct \r\n  with a minor for sexually molesting his then six-year-old son.  He was sentenced \r\n  to ten years imprisonment.\r\nIn March 2000, a jury found appellant to be a sexually violent predator, \r\n  and he was committed pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the Act).  \r\n  Appellant did not appeal this finding.\r\nApproximately a year later, the Department of Mental Health (the \r\n  Department) forwarded to the court the results of appellantâ€™s annual review.  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-110 (2002) (person committed pursuant to the \r\n  Act shall have an examination of his mental condition performed once every year; \r\n  this report must be provided to the court that committed the person).  The court \r\n  ordered an examination of appellant by an independent expert.  As permitted \r\n  by Â§ 44-48-110, appellant petitioned the court for release from his commitment.\r\nA probable cause hearing was held on the issue whether the results of appellantâ€™s \r\n  annual review warranted a trial to determine if he should be released from commitment. [1]   Following the submission of \r\n  written reports and arguments by counsel, the court found there was no probable \r\n  cause to believe appellantâ€™s mental abnormality or personality disorder had \r\n  so changed that he was safe to be at large and was not likely to commit acts \r\n  of sexual violence.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the court err by finding there was no probable cause \r\n  to believe appellantâ€™s mental abnormality or personality disorder had so changed \r\n  that he was safe to be released and was not likely to commit acts of sexual \r\n  violence?\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nAt appellantâ€™s probable cause hearing, the court was presented with \r\n  the Departmentâ€™s annual treatment review summary, the results of tests previously \r\n  administered on appellant, a psychological consultation report from Dr. Carey \r\n  A. Washington, and a psychiatric evaluation report from Dr. Thomas V. Martin.\r\nThe annual review summary indicated appellant was diagnosed with \r\n  pedophilia, limited to incest.  After several months of treatment, appellant \r\n  admitted to sexually molesting his youngest son and took more responsibility \r\n  for his aberrant sexual behavior.  The summary noted appellant, who was a cooperative \r\n  and active participant in his treatment, had met some treatment plan goals and \r\n  was working on meeting other goals.  The Department recommended that appellant \r\n  continue in residential treatment to address several treatment concerns.\r\nAppellant was administered a Penile Plethysmograph (PPG), which is \r\n  designed to measure sexual responsiveness to a variety of stimuli across gender, \r\n  age, and sexual activity.  The PPG suggested female and male preschoolers (ages \r\n  two to four years) aroused appellant.\r\nAppellant was also administered the Abel Assessment for Sexual Interest \r\n  (ASI), which measures whether someone is aroused by something that is considered \r\n  abnormal, such as pedophilia.  This test indicated appellant was interested \r\n  in two-to-four-year-old females and eight-to-ten-year-old females and males.\r\nAppellant was also evaluated according to the Static-99 test.  The \r\n  Static-99 is a brief actuarial instrument designed to estimate the probability \r\n  of sexual and violent recidivism among adult males who have already been convicted \r\n  of at least one sexual offense against a child or non-consenting adult.  According \r\n  to the Static-99, appellant received a score of 3, which is consistent with \r\n  a medium-low risk category for re-offending.\r\nDr. Carey Washington, a licensed counseling psychologist, concluded \r\n  that appellantâ€™s â€œreturn to the community, if such is achieved, would be favorable \r\n  with restrictions.â€  Dr. Washington stated appellant presents â€œsome concern \r\n  and remorse about his behavior that possibly, over a period of time, could be \r\n  resolved and worked more favorably towards him.â€\r\nDr. Thomas Martin, a psychiatrist, noted that appellant, after several \r\n  months of intense treatment, â€œbroke through his denial and took responsibility \r\n  for the sexual offense against his youngest son.â€  Dr. Martin set out reasons \r\n  for releasing appellant to an outpatient setting and reasons for continuing \r\n  to confine appellant for treatment.  Dr. Martin found appellant was capable \r\n  of and motivated towards continuing sex offender treatment in the outpatient \r\n  setting.  He stated the outpatient treatment would have to be long-term and \r\n  meet at least weekly.  Dr. Martin also recommended that appellant would need \r\n  to take Zoloft, an antidepressant used to decrease an inappropriate sex drive.  \r\n  Dr. Martin did not conclude, in the language of the statute, that appellantâ€™s \r\n  mental abnormality or personality disorder had so changed that he was safe to \r\n  be at large and, if released, was not likely to commit sexually violent acts.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn review, the appellate court will not disturb the hearing courtâ€™s \r\n  finding on probable cause unless found to be without evidence that reasonably \r\n  supports the hearing courtâ€™s finding.  See In re Treatment \r\n  and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 568 S.E.2d 338 (2002) (citing Townes \r\n  Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976)) \r\n  (on appeal of non-jury law case, findings of fact will not be disturbed unless \r\n  found to be without evidentiary support).\r\nIn a Â§ 44-48-110 probable cause hearing, the committed person has \r\n  the burden of showing the hearing court that probable cause exists to believe \r\n  that his mental condition has so changed that he is safe to be released.  See \r\n  People v. Hardacre, 109 Cal. Rptr. 2d 667 (Cal. App. 2 Dist. 2001) (at \r\n  show cause hearing, committed person must establish probable cause to believe \r\n  his mental condition has changed so that he is no longer a danger to others).  \r\n  Appellant did not meet this burden at the probable cause hearing.\r\nAccording to the Departmentâ€™s annual review summary, appellant had \r\n  progressed in his treatment by meeting certain treatment goals, such as admitting \r\n  the sex offense against his son; however, there were several other treatment \r\n  goals appellant still had not met.  The Department recommended appellant continue \r\n  in residential treatment.\r\nDr. Washington reported appellant could be released from commitment in the \r\n  future, but the release would have to include restrictions.  Dr. Martin reported \r\n  appellant could be released from commitment to long-term outpatient care as \r\n  long as he was treated on a regular basis and was administered Zoloft. \r\nAppellant did not present evidence to show there is probable cause \r\n  to believe his mental condition has so changed that he is safe to be released.  \r\n  The Department and Dr. Washington both reported appellant was not ready to be \r\n  released, although he has made progress in his treatment.  While evidence exists \r\n  that appellant could be released to long-term outpatient care that meets on \r\n  a regular basis, there is no evidence that appellantâ€™s mental condition had \r\n  so changed that he is safe to be at large and, if released, unlikely to commit \r\n  sexually violent acts.\r\nBecause there is evidence that reasonably supports the hearing courtâ€™s \r\n  finding of no probable cause, we affirm the decision of the hearing court.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] S.C.

Richardson, Jr., and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, \r\n  Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nOscar W. Bannister, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a public reprimand.  We \r\n  accept the agreement and publicly reprimand respondent. \r\nFacts\r\nI.&nbsp; Failure to Comply With Order of Destruction\r\nRespondent, in his role as Clerk of Court for Greenville \r\n  County, was ordered to destroy, or witness the destruction of, certain weapons \r\n  submitted as criminal exhibits in general sessions court.  Respondent delegated \r\n  responsibility for destruction of the firearms to certain individuals, including \r\n  a Deputy Sheriff, who ultimately kept certain firearms for themselves.  Respondent \r\n  did not witness the destruction of the weapons, did not comply with the court \r\n  order, did not seek clarification of the order for three years, and did not \r\n  prevent the personnel to whom he delegated destruction of the weapons from taking \r\n  the weapons for their own personal use.\r\nRespondent was held in criminal contempt for failing to \r\n  comply with the order of destruction.  This Court reversed the Circuit Court's \r\n  order holding respondent in contempt, but stated the following in its opinion:\r\n\r\nMann's conduct in delaying any attempt to comply with or seek clarification \r\n  of the Order for three years was irresponsible.  Mann's failure to assure that \r\n  his staff did not violate the statutes by taking the weapons for their own purposes \r\n  clearly demonstrates that Mann was not faithful to his statutory responsibilities. \r\n\r\n\r\nCounty of Greenville v. Mann, 347 S.C. 427, 436, 556 S.E.2d 383, 388 \r\n  (2001).\r\nII.&nbsp; Electronic Surveillance of a Circuit Court Judge\r\nRespondent directed an employee to connect a video recorder to the \r\n  main video security system for the Greenville County Courthouse and videotaped \r\n  a Circuit Court Judge without the knowledge and permission of the Judge.  Respondent \r\n  also directed a member of his staff to take a video camera off the premises \r\n  of the courthouse and videotape the same Circuit Court Judge.  This videotaping, \r\n  which occurred on one occasion, was also done without the knowledge and permission \r\n  of the Judge.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Racial Slur\r\nIn a private discussion with members of his staff concerning instructions \r\n  or directives from a Circuit Court Judge, respondent stated, in effect, that \r\n  if he tried to second guess a judge he would be perceived as though he were \r\n  &quot;an uppity nigger on an old south plantation.&quot;  Respondent apologized \r\n  to a staff member who was offended by the remark and later issued a public apology.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent's conduct constitutes violations of the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 8.4(a)(it \r\n  is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate or attempt to violate the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d)(it is professional misconduct for \r\n  a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).  Respondent has also \r\n  violated the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(6)(it shall be a ground \r\n  for discipline for a lawyer to violate the oath of office taken upon admission \r\n  to practice law in this state); and Rule 7(a)(7)(it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to willfully violate a valid court order issued by a court of this \r\n  state).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public \r\n  reprimand.  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and \r\n  publicly reprimand respondent for his actions. \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25610","title":"In the Matter of Former Jasper County Magistrate Joyce Lynn Leavell","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25610","description":"This opinion publicly reprimands former Jasper County Magistrate Joyce Lynn Leavell for failing to promptly remit funds in a bond matter, collecting unauthorized fees in a warrant matter, failing to disclose her former employment by an attorney appearing before her, and arranging for a Magistrate's Sale of and issuance of title for a vehicle that did not properly belong to her.","date":"2003-03-24","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n25610\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Former Jasper County Magistrate Joyce Lynn\r\n        Leavell, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25610\r\nSubmitted March 11, 2003 - Filed March \r\n  24, 2003\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and James G. Bogle, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nCharles B. Macloskie, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this judicial disciplinary action, respondent, a former \r\n  Jasper County Magistrate, admits she committed acts of misconduct in violation \r\n  of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR, consents to a public reprimand, \r\n  has agreed to resign and agreed not to apply for any judicial office in the \r\n  State of South Carolina without the prior consent of this Court. [1]   A Subpanel of the Commission on Judicial Conduct \r\n  recommended respondent be publicly reprimanded and prohibited from applying \r\n  for a judicial position within the unified judicial system of the State of South \r\n  Carolina without prior consent of this Court.  The Full Panel of the Commission \r\n  on Judicial Conduct adopted the Subpanel report in its entirety.  We agree respondent \r\n  has committed judicial misconduct and that a public reprimand, the most severe \r\n  sanction we are able to impose in these circumstances, is the appropriate sanction.\r\nFacts\r\nI.&nbsp; Bond Matter\r\nRespondent received a $400 bond payment from an individual.  \r\n  On or about June 25, 1999, the individual executed an &quot;Assignment of Bond,&quot; \r\n  assigning the $400 to his attorney.  However, respondent failed to promptly \r\n  transmit the payment to the Jasper County Clerk of Court. \r\nOn or about March 7, 2000, a representative from the Clerk \r\n  of Court's Office spoke with respondent, who promised to comply with the &quot;Assignment \r\n  of Bond.&quot;  Instead, respondent submitted a check for $400, drawn on her \r\n  magistrate's account, to the Clerk of Court.  Between May 18, 1999, and March \r\n  14, 2000, respondent made five deposits into her magistrate's account, each \r\n  of which contained entries for cash in excess of $400.  None of the deposit \r\n  slips identified the source of the cash.  The first of the deposit slips, which \r\n  could have included the bond money at issue, was dated November 22, 1999.  By \r\n  not identifying the cash entries on the three deposit slips dated after November \r\n  9, 1999, respondent failed to follow the provisions of this Court's November \r\n  9, 1999 order regarding financial record keeping.\r\nII. Warrant Matter\r\nOn August 25, 2000, respondent accepted $250 from an individual \r\n  to withdraw a warrant.  Respondent issued a receipt identifying the purpose \r\n  of payment as &quot;Court Cost/Return Warrant.&quot; \r\nDuring questioning by Disciplinary Counsel pursuant to a \r\n  Notice to Appear, respondent testified she often charged varying amounts to \r\n  people who wished to withdraw arrest warrants.  The amounts varied from $50, \r\n  for a simple assault case, up to $250.  There is no authority, statutory or \r\n  administrative, to charge such a fee.\r\nIII.&nbsp; County Audit Matter\r\nAn audit of Jasper County was conducted for the fiscal year \r\n  ending June 30, 2000.  The audit included respondent's office.  The audit noted \r\n  the following deficiencies in respondent's office:  (a) no cash disbursements \r\n  or cash receipts were maintained; (b) deposits were entered on check stubs; \r\n  (c) bank reconciliations were not prepared; (d) old outstanding checks were \r\n  not investigated; and (e) monthly remittance reports were not made available.  \r\n  The effect of these conditions was a lack of accounting procedures that provided \r\n  no controlled environment for accountability.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Disqualification Matter\r\nBefore becoming a magistrate in 1995, respondent worked \r\n  as a legal secretary for Gary Brown, who practiced in Jasper County until retiring \r\n  in 1999.  In 1998, respondent acquired from Mr. Brown a 1975 Rolls-Royce four-door \r\n  sedan, which Mr. Brown had purchased in 1992 for $22,500.  Mr. Brown appeared \r\n  before respondent twice in 1999, representing the landlord in a landlord-tenant \r\n  matter, and a defendant at a preliminary hearing.  Respondent did not disclose \r\n  on the record at either of the hearings the receipt of the vehicle from Mr. \r\n  Brown, nor her employment with him.\r\nV. Vehicle Matter\r\nRespondent, as Chief Magistrate in Jasper County, prepared \r\n  a Court Order and Magistrate's Bill of Sale, dated July 29, 1999, for the aforementioned \r\n  vehicle.  The document was signed by Judge Donna D. Lynah, a part-time magistrate \r\n  in Jasper County at the time. [2] \r\n    Respondent was never a proprietor, owner, or operator of a business where \r\n  vehicles are stored, garaged, or repaired, nor was she a person who repaired \r\n  vehicles or furnished material for their repair or storage.  Only individuals \r\n  in those capacities may apply for a magistrate sale of a vehicle pursuant to \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-15-10 (1991).  The document indicated that public notice \r\n  had been given that the vehicle would be sold pursuant to section 29-15-10 for \r\n  &quot;Accrued Charges,&quot; in the amount of $3,000, allegedly incurred by \r\n  respondent.  The Magistrate's Bill of Sale stated the vehicle had been sold \r\n  to respondent for $30 on September 2, 1999, at a public auction.  The &quot;Accrued \r\n  Charges&quot; listed on the Magistrate's Bill of Sale were charges incurred \r\n  by respondent for repairs made on the vehicle; however, the person who allegedly \r\n  made the repairs was not a party to the Court Order and Magistrate's Bill of \r\n  Sale.\r\nSection 29-15-10 requires that written notice be given to \r\n  the owner of the vehicle prior to sale, that the magistrate insure that the \r\n  owner has been notified prior to the vehicle being sold, and that the magistrate \r\n  have advertised the vehicle for at least fifteen days by posting a notice in \r\n  three public places.  None of these requirements were met.\r\nRespondent represented to Judge Lynah that Mr. Brown was \r\n  aware of respondent's request for a Magistrate's Title and that a Magistrate's \r\n  Title for the vehicle was necessary because Mr. Brown had misplaced the title \r\n  to the vehicle.  Without Mr. Brown's knowledge or consent, respondent asked \r\n  Judge Lynah to conduct a judicial sale of the vehicle and to issue a Magistrate's \r\n  Title to the vehicle in respondent's name.  Respondent paid no money to Judge \r\n  Lynah in exchange for a Magistrate's Bill of Sale.  No fee of $30 was paid to \r\n  Judge Lynah for a public auction, as maintained by respondent, and no public \r\n  auction was held.  However, respondent falsely represented to the Department \r\n  of Revenue that she had paid $30 for the vehicle and, accordingly, paid casual \r\n  excise tax in the amount of $1.50.  Respondent then applied to the Department \r\n  of Public Safety to have the vehicle titled in her name.  A certificate was \r\n  issued to respondent on September 8, 1999.\r\nMr. Brown brought a claim and delivery action against respondent, \r\n  and others, to retrieve the vehicle.  Mr. Brown executed an affidavit for claim \r\n  and delivery stating that he was the lawful and registered owner of the vehicle \r\n  and had not given, nor sold, it to respondent.  Following a hearing on October \r\n  11, 2000, a circuit court judge issued an order directing respondent to return \r\n  the vehicle to Mr. Brown without delay.  The case was later settled.  Mr. Brown \r\n  agreed to dismiss the action with prejudice in exchange for respondent returning \r\n  permanent possession and title of the vehicle to Mr. Brown.  When respondent \r\n  failed to return the title, after verbal requests and a written demand, counsel \r\n  for Mr. Brown filed a Motion to Compel Settlement.  Thereafter, respondent signed \r\n  title of the vehicle over to Mr. Brown.\r\nVI.&nbsp; Disclosure Matter\r\nRespondent failed to disclose receipt of the aforementioned \r\n  vehicle in her Rule 501, SCACR, disclosure statements for the calendar years \r\n  1998 and 1999.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent has violated the following Canons of the Code \r\n  of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:  Canon 1(A) (a judge shall uphold the \r\n  integrity and independence of the judiciary); Canon 2 (a judge shall avoid impropriety \r\n  and the appearance of impropriety in all of the judge's activities); Canon 3(A) \r\n  (a judge shall follow certain standards in the performance of the judge's duties); \r\n  Canon 3(C)(1) (a judge shall diligently discharge the judge's administrative \r\n  responsibilities without bias or prejudice and maintain professional competence \r\n  in judicial administration, and should cooperate with other judges and court \r\n  officials in the administration of court business); Canon 3(C)(2) (a judge shall \r\n  require staff, court officials and others subject to the judge's direction and \r\n  control to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the \r\n  judge and to refrain from manifesting bias or prejudice in the performance of \r\n  their official duties); Canon (3)(C)(3) (a judge with supervisory authority \r\n  for the judicial performance of other judges shall take reasonable measures \r\n  to assure the proper performance of their judicial responsibilities); Canon \r\n  3(E)(1) (a judge shall disqualify herself in a proceeding in which the judge's \r\n  impartiality might reasonably be questioned); Canon 3(F) (a judge disqualified \r\n  by the terms of Section 3E may disclose on the record the basis of the judge's \r\n  disqualification and ask the parties to consider whether to waive jurisdiction; \r\n  if the parties agree the judge should not be disqualified, and the judge is \r\n  willing to participate, the judge may participate in the proceedings, but the \r\n  agreement shall be incorporated in the record of the proceeding); Canon 4(A)(1) \r\n  (a judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra-judicial activities so that \r\n  they do not cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially \r\n  as a judge); Canon 4(A)(2) (a judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra-judicial \r\n  activities so that they do not demean the judicial office); Canon 4(D)(1) (a \r\n  judge shall not engage in financial and business dealings that may reasonably \r\n  be perceived to exploit the judge's judicial position); Canon 4(D)(5) (a judge \r\n  shall not accept a gift, bequest, favor or loan from anyone except in limited \r\n  circumstances); Canon 4(H) (a judge may receive compensation and reimbursement \r\n  of expenses for the extra-judicial activities permitted by this Code if the \r\n  source of the payments does not give the appearance of influencing the judge's \r\n  performance of judicial duties or otherwise give the appearance of impropriety, \r\n  but the judge must report the receipt of the compensation).  By violating these \r\n  Canons, respondent has also violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Judicial \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.\r\nConclusion\r\nRespondent has fully acknowledged that her actions were \r\n  in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary \r\n  Enforcement.  We agree with the Commission on Judicial Conduct that a public \r\n  reprimand is the appropriate sanction because it is the only sanction that can \r\n  be imposed in this matter given the fact that respondent has resigned her position \r\n  as a magistrate.  Respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded for her conduct.  \r\n  Moreover, respondent shall not hereafter seek another judicial position in South \r\n  Carolina unless first authorized to do so by this Court.  Finally, respondent \r\n  is hereby ordered to pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings to the \r\n  Commission on Judicial Conduct within thirty days of the date of this opinion.  \r\n\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent submitted her resignation to the Governor \r\n    of South Carolina.

In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction set forth in \r\n  Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent \r\n  from the practice of law in this state.  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, \r\n  are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent, a 1999 graduate of the University of South \r\n  Carolina School of Law, prepared a false transcript of her law school grades.  \r\n  She changed C's she received in twelve courses to A's and B's and changed her \r\n  grade point average from a 2.96 to a 3.505.  Respondent submitted the false \r\n  transcript to law firms in several states, all of which hired her in partial \r\n  reliance upon the representations in the transcript.\r\nIn response to initial inquiries from the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel, respondent submitted a false affidavit.  In addition, in responding \r\n  to questions under oath pursuant to Rule 19(c)(4), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, respondent \r\n  provided false testimony with regard to the creation and distribution of the \r\n  false transcript.

Does State Farmâ€™s South Carolina automobile policy obligate it to compensate \r\n  an insured making a comprehensive or collision claim for any diminution in market \r\n  value where there is no dispute that the vehicle was adequately restored to \r\n  its pre-accident level of performance, appearance, and function?\r\nII. If the answer to the previous question is yes, is Plaintiff bound by the \r\n  appraisal provision within the insurance policy?\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts are not disputed.  Albert Schulmeyer (â€œSchulmeyerâ€) sustained damages \r\n  to his automobile as the result of an accident.  A State Farm Fire and Casualty \r\n  Company (â€œState Farmâ€) adjustor estimated the loss at $3,268.02.  State Farm \r\n  paid the amount of the loss minus the deductible.  \r\nSchulmeyer admits his vehicle was fully and properly repaired.  However, Schulmeyer \r\n  asserts State Farm failed to compensate him for an additional $1,000 in â€œdiminished \r\n  valueâ€ to the vehicle, which occurred as a result of the accident.  \r\nI\r\nDiminished Value\r\nSchulmeyer asserts State Farm is obligated to pay for any diminishment in value \r\n  of his vehicle beyond the cost of repairs.  Schulmeyer relies on Campbell \r\n  v. Calvert Fire Ins. Co., 234 S.C. 583, 109 S.E.2d 572 (1959), and Lumpkin \r\n  v. Allstate Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 19, 159 S.E.2d 852 (1968).\r\nIn Campbell, plaintiff claimed and judgment was entered for the total \r\n  loss of his vehicle. As there was no evidence to support the award, this court \r\n  reversed the trial court and remanded the matter for further action.  In the \r\n  opinion this Court wrote:  \r\n\r\nIt follows from the foregoing that where there is a partial loss and the automobile \r\n  can be repaired and restored to its former condition and value, the cost of \r\n  repairs is the measure of liability, less any deductible sum specified in the \r\n  policy.  But if, despite such repairs, there yet remains a loss in actual value, \r\n  estimated as of the collision date, the insured is entitled to compensation \r\n  for such deficiency.\r\n\r\nId. at 591, 109 S.E.2d at 576-77.  \r\nCampbell is distinguishable from the present case. The State Farm insurance \r\n  contract is more specific in its obligations than is the Campbell contract.  \r\n  The Campbell contract provided:\r\n\r\nThe limit of the companyâ€™s liability for loss shall not exceed either \r\n  (1)&nbsp; the actual cash value of the automobile, or if the loss is of a part \r\n  thereof the actual cash value of such part, at time of loss or\r\n  (2)&nbsp; what it would then cost to repair or replace the automobile or such \r\n  part thereof with other of like kind and quality, with deduction for depreciation, \r\n  or \r\n  (3)&nbsp; the applicable limit of liability stated in the declarations.          \r\n\r\n\r\nCampbell 234 S.C. at 589, 109 S.E.2d at 576.  \r\n\r\nThe State Farm contract at issue provides:\r\nThe limit of our liability for loss to property or any part of it is the lower \r\n  of:\r\n  \r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;the actual cash value; or\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;the cost of repair or replacement\r\n  \r\nActual cash value is determined by the market value, age and condition at the \r\n  time the loss occurred.  Any deductible amount that applies is then subtracted.\r\n\r\nThe State Farm policy defines the term â€œcost of repair or replacementâ€ as:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;the cost of repair or replacement agreed upon by you and us;\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;a competitive bid approved by us; or\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;an estimate written based upon the prevailing competitive price . . . [which] \r\n  means prices charged by a majority of the repair market in the area where the \r\n  car is to be repaired . . . \r\n  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the State Farm policy explicitly reserves the insurerâ€™s right \r\n  to indemnify the insured â€œfor the loss in money or may repair or replace the \r\n  automobile or such part thereof, as aforesaid.â€\r\nBeyond the difference in the degree of specificity, we note the Campbell \r\n  court failed to apply traditional principles of contract interpretation in construing \r\n  the insurance contract.  \r\nThe cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal \r\n  effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions as determined by the contract language.  United \r\n  Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 413 \r\n  S.E.2d 866 (Ct. App. 1992).  Parties to a contract have the right to construct \r\n  their own contract without interference from courts to rewrite or torture the \r\n  meaning of the policy to extend coverage.  Gambrell v. Travelers Ins. Cos., \r\n  280 S.C. 69, 310 S.E.2d 814 (1983).  \r\nIf the contractâ€™s language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines \r\n  the contractâ€™s force and effect.  See United Dominion, supra.  \r\n  When a contract is unambiguous a court must construe its provisions according \r\n  to the terms the parties used; understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular \r\n  sense.  C.A.N. Enter., Inc. v. South Carolina Health and Human Servs. Fin. \r\n  Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 373 S.E.2d 584 (1988).  \r\nAn insurance contract is read as a whole document so that â€œone may not, by \r\n  pointing out a single sentence or clause, create an ambiguity.â€  Yarborough \r\n  v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 592, 225 S.E.2d 344, 348 (1976).  \r\n  The meaning of a particular word or phrase is not determined by considering \r\n  the word or phrase by itself, but by reading the policy as a whole and considering \r\n  the context and subject matter of the insurance contract.  Id.\r\nRather than applying these principles, Campbell quoted a Texas case [1]  to define â€œrepairâ€ and â€œreplaceâ€ to mean â€œthe restoration of \r\n  the automobile to substantially the same condition in which it was immediately \r\n  prior to the collisionâ€, while noting â€œit would not be restored to the condition \r\n  if the repair left the market value of the automobile substantially less than \r\n  the value immediately before the collision.â€ Campbell, 234 S.C. at 592, \r\n  109 S.E.2d at 576.  The differing policy languages between the Campbell \r\n  contract and the more specific language in the State Farm Contract combined \r\n  with the requirement we apply traditional principles of contract interpretation \r\n  render a contrary result from Campbell. \r\n  [2]   \r\nSchulmeyer seeks to recover for diminution of his vehicleâ€™s \r\n  value.  The question is:  under the insurance contract â€œmust the insurer pay \r\n  for damage which is not repairable but which nonetheless results in a diminution \r\n  in value of the insured automobile?â€  See Carlton, 32 S.W.3d at \r\n  462.  Because Campbell does not control our decision, we have reviewed \r\n  authorities of other jurisdictions\r\nThere is split authority over whether a plaintiff should be allowed to recover \r\n  diminished value beyond the cost of repairs, with the recent trend disfavoring the claim. \r\n  [3]  \r\nThe minority view espoused \r\n  most recently by the Georgia Supreme Court in State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Mabry, 556 S.E.2d 114 (Ga. 2001), allows recovery for diminution \r\n  in value.  The Georgia court relied on public policy exceptions inherent in \r\n  Georgia insurance contracts which are not applicable under South Carolina law.  \r\n  Specifically, the Georgia court based its decision on the understanding implicitly \r\n  imported into each Georgia insurance contract that loss due to physical damages \r\n  encompasses both utility and value.  As such, an insurer is obligated under \r\n  Georgia law to pay the cost of repairs and diminution in value.  \r\nNo similar public \r\n  policy applies to insurance contracts in this state.  Rather this Court is required \r\n  to give effect to the plain meaning of the words in an unambiguous contract.  \r\n  See United Dominion, supra.  \r\nThe majority of states to recently address the issue deny recovery \r\n  for diminution in value.  These courts rest their decisions on the rationale \r\n  the terms â€œrepairâ€ and â€œreplaceâ€ are not ambiguous when viewed in light of the \r\n  entire contract.  See, e.g., Siegle, supra.  As \r\n  such they apply, as we must, the commonly used definition of those words to \r\n  limit any such recovery. \r\nGenerally, â€œrepairâ€ means â€œ[t]o mend, remedy, restore, renovate \r\n  . . . [t]o restore to a sound or good state after decay, injury, dilapidation, \r\n  or partial destruction.â€  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1298 (6th ed.1990); \r\n  see also Websterâ€™s II New College Dictionary 939 (1995) \r\n  (â€œrepairâ€ means â€œ[t]o restore to sound condition after damage \r\n  or injury . . .â€); Merriam-Websterâ€™s Collegiate Dictionary 991 (10th \r\n  ed.1999) (â€œrepairâ€ means â€œto restore by replacing a part or putting together \r\n  what is torn or brokenâ€).  \r\nIn the context of an insurance contract the word â€œreplaceâ€ means \r\n  the insurer will â€œrestore [the insuredâ€™s vehicle] to a former place or position,â€ \r\n  or â€œtake the place of  . . . as a substitute or successor.â€ See Siegle, \r\n  819 So.2d at 736; see also Merriam-Websterâ€™s Collegiate Dictionary 992 \r\n  (10th ed.1999). \r\nThere is no concept of value in the ordinary meaning of these words.  \r\n  See Carlton, supra; Markel, 822 So.2d at 627 (â€œTo \r\n  interpret the word â€˜repairâ€™ as encompassing the diminished value of an automobile \r\n  would go beyond the wordâ€™s plain meaning.â€).  As such the majority view disfavors \r\n  imparting the concept of value into â€œrepair or replaceâ€ provisions to require \r\n  an insurer pay for the loss of value as a result of an accident.  Carlton, \r\n  32 S.W.3d at 464 (â€œAscribing to the words â€˜repair or replaceâ€™ an obligation \r\n  to compensate the insured for things [i.e., diminished market value] which, \r\n  by their very nature, cannot be â€˜repairedâ€™ or â€˜replacedâ€™ would violate the most \r\n  fundamental rules of contract construction.â€).\r\nThe State Farm policy sub judice does \r\n  not recognize value as inherent in the concept â€œrepair or replacement.â€  The \r\n  policy recognizes the cost of repair or replacement may be determined by a rate \r\n  agreed between insurer and insured; a competitive bid approved by the insurer; \r\n  or an estimate based upon the prevailing competitive market price.  The policy, \r\n  read as a whole, defines repair or replacement as restoring the vehicle to pre-accident \r\n  mechanical function and condition and not as restoring value.  \r\nTo read value into the repair clause would arbitrarily read out of the \r\n  policy the insurerâ€™s right to determine whether to repair the vehicle or to \r\n  pay for its loss.  Bickel, 143 S.E.2d at 906.  The language provision \r\n  in the present case expressly limits coverage to the lesser of the actual value \r\n  or the cost of repair.  These are alternatives, which do not include an additional \r\n  obligation to pay for diminished value when the cost of repair is chosen.  â€œReading \r\n  into the cost of repair a requirement to also pay for diminished value would \r\n  render the limitation provision meaningless, as the insurer would essentially \r\n  always pay for the value of the car.â€  Driscoll, 227 F. Supp. 2d at 707; \r\n  see also Ray, 246 Cal.Rptr. at 596. [4] \r\nCertified Question Answered.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   \r\n    American Stand.

North Star Dodge Sales, Inc., 667 \r\n    S.W.2d 115 (Tex. 1984).\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]   Likewise, Lumpkin is not binding as precedent.  \r\n    In Lumpkin, this Court applied the Campbell \r\n    rule in dicta within a case concerning the tort of conversion.

We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThese are wrongful death and survival \r\n  actions brought by the estate of Carolyn Hill (Hill), who died of breast cancer \r\n  in 1994.  The complaints alleged her treating physician, Petitioner S. Perry \r\n  Davis, M.D. (Davis), was negligent in failing to timely read a suspicious mammogram, \r\n  which had been performed on Hill in November 1991.  As a result, Hillâ€™s breast \r\n  cancer was not diagnosed until June 1993, by which time it had metastasized \r\n  into her lymph nodes. [1]   \r\nAt trial, the court allowed introduction of $77,905.21 \r\n  in medical expenses billed to Hill.  Davis argued that only those amounts actually \r\n  paid by Medicaid should be admitted into evidence, for a total of $24,109.04.  \r\n  The difference between the &quot;billed&quot; amounts and the amounts actually \r\n  &quot;paid&quot; by Medicaid, totaled $51,620.59.  The jury awarded a total \r\n  of $1,082,103.71 to Hill's statutory beneficiaries and $1,000,000.00 to her \r\n  estate.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nIs evidence of amounts billed by a treating physician admissible \r\n  to establish a medical malpractice plaintiffâ€™s damages, where the plaintiff \r\n  is a Medicaid patient who is not liable for any amounts billed in excess of \r\n  the amount paid by Medicaid?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDavis argues the trial court should have limited Hillâ€™s \r\n  recovery for medical expenses to those amounts actually paid by Medicaid.  We \r\n  disagree. We find both the amount of the Medicaid payment and the amount billed \r\n  by Doctor Davis were admissible [2] \r\n   to establish the amount of Hillâ€™s damages. [3]      \r\nA plaintiff in a personal injury action seeking \r\n  damages for the cost of medical services provided to him as a result of a tortfeasor's \r\n  wrongdoing is entitled to recover the reasonable value of those medical services, \r\n  not necessarily the amount paid.  22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages, Â§ 198 (1988).  \r\n  Although the amount paid may be relevant in determining the reasonable value \r\n  of those services, the trier of fact must look to a variety of other factors \r\n  in making such a finding. Among those factors to be considered by the jury are \r\n  the amount billed to the plaintiff,  and the relative market value of those \r\n  services.  Kashner v. Geisinger Clinic, 638 A.2d 980 (Pa. 1994).  Clearly, \r\n  the amount actually paid for medical services does not alone determine the reasonable \r\n  value of those medical services. Nor does it limit the finder of fact in making \r\n  such a determination.  Id., citing D. Dobbs, Handbook on the \r\n  Law of Remedies Â§ 8.1, at 543 (1973) (&quot;The measure of recovery is not \r\n  the cost of services ... but their reasonable value.... [R]ecovery does not \r\n  depend on whether there is any bill at all, and the tortfeasor is liable for \r\n  the value of medical services even if they are given without charge, since it \r\n  is their value and not their cost that counts.&quot;); Restatement (Second) \r\n  of Torts Â§ 924 comment f (1979) (&quot;The value of medical services made necessary \r\n  by the tort can ordinarily be recovered although they have created no liability \r\n  or expense to injured person, as when a physician donates his services.&quot;). \r\nSee also Ellsworth v. Schelbrock, 611 N.W.2d 764 \r\n  (Wis. 2000)(noting that test is the reasonable value, not the actual charge).  \r\n\r\nWe are cognizant that several courts hold that \r\n  the amount paid by Medicaid (or similar programs) is dispositive of the reasonable \r\n  value of medical services.  See e.g. Moorhead v. Crozer Chester Medical \r\n  Center, 765 A.2d 786 (Pa. 2001); Hanif v. Housing Authority, 246 \r\n  Cal. Rptr. 192 (Cal. Ct. App. 1988); Bates v. Hogg, 921 P.2d 249, 252 \r\n  (Kan. Ct. App. 1996).  The basis for these cases appears to be that to allow \r\n  a plaintiff to claim the billed amount, as opposed to the paid amount, would \r\n  result in a windfall.  \r\nHowever, to hold that the plaintiff is limited \r\n  to damages in the amount actually paid by Medicaid is contrary to the purposes \r\n  behind the collateral source rule and would result in a windfall to the defendant \r\n  tortfeasor.  In our view, a defendant physician who agrees to become a Medicaid \r\n  provider, thereby agreeing to accept as compensation for medical services those \r\n  amounts set forth in the Medicaid agreement, who thereafter bills a Medicaid \r\n  patient for the full value of his services, may not claim that the true, reasonable \r\n  value of those services is the lesser amount paid by Medicaid.  Accordingly, \r\n  we hold the amount billed by Davis was relevant to establish the reasonable \r\n  value of the services provided to Hill. \r\n  [4]   \r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is affirmed.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., and MOORE, J., concur.  \r\n  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  I am in complete agreement that the reasonable value \r\n  of medical services is a jury issue and that Medicaid is a collateral source. \r\n  I disagree that the amount of billed medical services which is not paid by Medicaid \r\n  ($51,620.59) is recoverable as compensatory damages. Medicaidâ€™s unique characteristics \r\n  and the law of damages require finding only the amount paid by Medicaid is recoverable \r\n  as compensatory damages. \r\nThe collateral source rule prohibits the reduction of compensation received \r\n  by an injured party by compensation received from a source wholly independent \r\n  of the wrongdoer.  In re W.B. Easton Const. Co., Inc., 320 S.C. 90, 92, \r\n  463 S.E.2d 317, 318 (1995).  Courts applying the collateral source rule reason \r\n  â€œa negligent defendant is not entitled to enjoy the fruits of fortuitous circumstances, \r\n  employer generosity, or diligent effort on the part of the injured plaintiffâ€ \r\n  to reduce the tortfeasorâ€™s liability.  Steeves v. United States, 294 \r\n  F. Supp. 446, 457 (D.S.C. 1968).  I agree Medicaid is a collateral source because \r\n  it is compensation expended on the injured partyâ€™s behalf from a source wholly \r\n  independent of the wrongdoer.  \r\nHaving concluded Medicaid payments are a collateral source does not end our \r\n  inquiry.  While the collateral source rule applies to â€œcompensation receivedâ€ \r\n  by the plaintiff, the rule itself does not address whether the â€œamount billedâ€ \r\n  or the â€œamount paidâ€ is the amount of â€œcompensation receivedâ€ subject to the \r\n  rule.  See In re W.B. Easton Const. Co., Inc., supra; see \r\n  also Bates v. Hogg, 921 P.2d 249, 252 (Kan. Ct. App. 1996).  The \r\n  question whether the collateral source rule applies to the billed amount or \r\n  the paid amount is the central issue of this appeal.  The answer to that question \r\n  is provided by law of damages not the collateral source rule.  \r\nThe majority of courts to consider this issue have concluded the collateral \r\n  source rule applies only to the amount paid by Medicaid.  See, e.g., \r\n  McAmis v. Wallace,  980 F. Supp. 181 (W.D.Va.1997); Hanif v. Housing \r\n  Authority, 246 Cal. Rptr. 192 (Cal. Ct. App. 1988); Bates v. Hogg, \r\n  supra; but see Ellsworth v. Schelbrock, 235 Wis.2d \r\n  678, 611 N.W.2d 764 (Wisc. 2000) (holding the plaintiff may recover the amount \r\n  billed to Medicaid).\r\nThe majority of courts to consider this issue predicate their holdings on the \r\n  central tenet of compensatory damages: awards are intended to make an injured \r\n  person whole by placing him in the position enjoyed prior to the injury and \r\n  no more.  See Kapushinsky v. United States, 259 F. Supp. 1, 6 \r\n  (D.S.C. 1966); Hutchinson v. Town of Summerville, 66 S.C. 442, 45 S.E. \r\n  8 (1903); 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages Â§Â§ 26, 27 (1988); 11 S.C. Jurisprudence \r\n  Damages Â§ 2, 3 (1992).  Allowing a plaintiff to recover for the amount \r\n  billed to Medicaid does injury to this principle of law. \r\nThe Medicaid program provides individuals with medical treatment by doctors \r\n  who agree to accept such patients in exchange for payment at a predetermined \r\n  rate schedule.  The patient not only receives medical care, but also incurs \r\n  no liability for the cost of the care once the doctor accepts payment.  The \r\n  difference between the amount billed and the amount paid, the amount in issue \r\n  in this case, is â€œphantomâ€ money in that no one has paid the amount and no one \r\n  will incur a debt for the amount.\r\nWhat distinguishes Medicaid from traditional insurance programs and, even its \r\n  Medicare counterpart, is, the recipients, who fall below a certain income level \r\n  to be eligible, do not pay to receive the benefit. While the care of the impoverished \r\n  is an admirable social policy goal, in terms of the law of damages, the Medicaid \r\n  patient receives a windfall based on a loss not personally incurred.  The question \r\n  is â€œwhether the â€˜reasonable valueâ€™ measure of recovery means that an injured \r\n  plaintiff may recover from the tortfeasor more than the actual amount he paid \r\n  or for which he incurred liability for past medical care and services.â€  Hanif, \r\n  246 Cal. Rptr. at 194-95.   Stated another way, should a plaintiff be entitled \r\n  to claim and should a defendant be subject to liability for this â€œphantomâ€ money.\r\nBecause the plaintiff has never paid nor will ever be liable for the written-off \r\n  difference between the billed and paid amount, it is  â€œunconscionable to permit \r\n  the taxpayers to bear the expense of providing free medical care to a person \r\n  and then allow that person to recover damages for medical services from a tort-feasor \r\n  and pocket the windfall.â€ Bates, 921 P.2d at 253 (quoting Gordon \r\n  v. Forsyth County Hospital Authority, Inc., 409 F. Supp. 708, 719 (M.D.N.C. \r\n  1976)).  This case is â€œnot a situation where [p]laintiff avoided personally \r\n  paying a bill because a collateral source stepped in . . . no one paid the written-off \r\n  amount and as a result . . . [p]laintiff has not incurred this fee.â€  McAmis \r\n  980 F. Supp. at 184.  \r\nThe amount Medicaid pays is a collateral source to benefit a plaintiff who \r\n  has a right to recover that amount. The excess between the amount billed to \r\n  and the amount paid by Medicaid, for which a plaintiff is no longer liable, \r\n  is not protected by the rule.  It is not reasonable, under principles of compensatory \r\n  damage law, to allow Plaintiff to receive a windfall in damages of amounts for \r\n  which no entity is liable. [5] \r\nThe majority opinion predicates its definition of compensatory medical damages \r\n  on the legal fiction that the billed amount, which no one incurred as a debt, \r\n  can be a reasonable amount of damages.  This Court has created a right to a \r\n  compensatory remedy for a debt which never has nor ever will exist.  In sum, \r\n  this Courtâ€™s opinion may be interpreted as a plaintiffâ€™s right to be reimbursed \r\n  for money that will never be expended.  \r\nBecause the majority desires to require doctors to bear the cost of reimbursing \r\n  an injured party for a non-existent debt, I dissent.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]    A more detailed recitation of the facts is set \r\n    forth in the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]    It is unclear, from footnote 25 of the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion, \r\n    whether the amount of Medicaid payments was placed before the jury.  Haselden, \r\n    341 S.C. at 507, 341 S.E.2d at 306, n. 25.  As we read the colloquy between \r\n    the trial court and counsel, the court appears to have ruled that the amounts \r\n    paid by Medicaid were admissible, but that they did not, under the collateral \r\n    source rule, reduce the defendantsâ€™ liability.  ROA pp. 215-217.  Indeed, \r\n    the trial court instructed the jury that it could not consider any compensation \r\n    received by the plaintiff from a third party to lessen the defendantsâ€™ liability.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]   We concur with Davis that the collateral source rule applies to \r\n    Medicaid payments.  See e.g., Davis v. Management &amp; Training \r\n    Corp. Centers, 2001 WL 709380 (D. Kan. May 30, 2001); Williamson v. \r\n    Odyssey House, Inc., 2000 DNH 238, 2000 WL 1745101 (D.N.H. November 3, \r\n    2000); Chapman v. Mazda Motor of America, 7 F. Supp.2d 1123 (D. Mont. \r\n    1998); McAmis v. Wallace, 980 F.Supp. 181 (W.D.Va.1997);  Bates \r\n    v. Hogg, 921 P.2d 249, 252 (Kan. Ct. App. 1996); Brandon HMA, Inc. \r\n    v. Bradshaw, 2001 WL 1198984 (Miss. Oct. 11, 2001); Cates v. Wilson, \r\n    361 S.E.2d 734 (N.C. 1987); Ellsworth v. Schelbrock, 611 N.W.2d 764 \r\n    (Wis. 2000).  Since it is a â€œwholly independentâ€ collateral source, Hillâ€™s \r\n    damages are not limited by the amounts paid by Medicaid.  However, simply \r\n    because Hillâ€™s damages are not limited by the amount of Medicaid payments \r\n    received, it does not follow that the only admissible evidence as to amount \r\n    of her damages was the amount she was billed by Davis.  We note that in cases \r\n    in which evidence of Medicaid payments is admissible, a plaintiff is entitled \r\n    to a limiting instruction that such payments may not be used to limit recovery.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]   Our holding is criticized by the dissent as â€œrequir[ing] doctors \r\n    to bear the cost of reimbursing an injured party for a non-existent debt.â€ \r\n    On the contrary, we simply hold that the reasonable value of the medical services \r\n    is for the juryâ€™s determination.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  I would limit this Courtâ€™s \r\n    holding to Medicaid because of its unique attributes without deciding whether \r\n    an individual who has purchased medical insurance and paid premiums, through \r\n    a private insurer or the Medicare system, should be allowed to introduce evidence \r\n    of write-offs which may be a part of the benefit of their bargain.   Compare \r\n    Strahley v. Mercy Health Center of Manhattan, 2000 WL 1745291 (D. Kan. \r\n    2000) (excluding evidence of medical expenses written off due to a contract \r\n    between a health care provider and private insurance carrier) with \r\n    Acular v. Letourneau, 260 Va. 180, 531 S.E.2d 316 (Va. 2000) (allowing \r\n    evidence of medical expenses written off pursuant to a contractual agreement \r\n    between private insurance company and medical provider).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Brigina Dicks-Woolridge","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-03-19-01","description":"This order places Brigina Dicks-Woolridge on interim suspension and appoints George B.

Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, Senior Assistant Attorney \r\n  General Norman Mark Rapoport, and Special Assistant Attorney General Alexander \r\n  G. Shissias, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  The circuit court granted petitionerâ€™s \r\n  motion to quash an indictment charging petitioner with violating the Pollution \r\n  Control Act (the Act) [1] .  The \r\n  State appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed.  State v. Peake, 345 \r\n  S.C. 72, 545 S.E.2d 840 (Ct. App. 2001).  We granted certiorari, and affirm \r\n  the decision reinstating the indictment.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner, a real estate \r\n  developer, owned a private water treatment plant.  The Department of Health \r\n  and Environmental Control (DHEC) contacted petitioner in the summer of 1996 \r\n  concerning the operation of this plant.  In August 1996, petitioner and his \r\n  attorney [2]  met with DHEC representatives, \r\n  including Ms. Hunter-Shaw, [3]  \r\n  in Columbia.  As discussions continued during 1996, DHEC suggested petitioner \r\n  pay a substantial monetary penalty for violating the Act. \r\nAlso in 1996, unbeknownst to petitioner, \r\n  Ms. Hunter-Shaw referred  the case to a DHEC committee that reviews matters \r\n  and determines whether to refer the violations to the Attorney General for possible \r\n  criminal prosecution.  Ms. Hunter-Shaw never mentioned the potential criminal \r\n  liability to petitioner, and neither he nor his attorney ever inquired.  Both \r\n  petitioner and his attorney testified at the hearing on petitionerâ€™s motion \r\n  to quash the indictment that they had â€œassumedâ€ a settlement would cover â€œeverything.â€  \r\n  Ms. Hunter-Shaw testified at that hearing that she never discussed the possibility \r\n  of criminal charges with petitioner or his attorney because, â€œI didnâ€™t want \r\n  to put that at jeopardy, and it wouldnâ€™t - it simply wouldnâ€™t have come up.â€  \r\n  It is undisputed that Ms. Hunter-Shaw never affirmatively represented that the \r\n  settlement covered criminal charges as well as civil liability issues.\r\nEventually DHEC and \r\n  petitioner settled the civil matter by having petitioner deed the waste treatment \r\n  plant to the Town of Ninety Six.  No monetary penalty was exacted.  Shortly \r\n  thereafter, petitioner was indicted for violating S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§48-1-90(a) \r\n  and 48-1-320 of the Act.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; Can DHEC settle criminal charges arising from alleged violations \r\n  of the Act?\r\n  (2)&nbsp; Is â€œfundamental fairnessâ€ violated if the State is permitted \r\n  to prosecute petitioner under the facts of this case?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner first contends \r\n  that the State was forbidden to criminally prosecute him because of Ms. Hunter-Shawâ€™s \r\n  actions.  He relies on several theories to support this contention, including \r\n  estoppel, apparent authority, and actual authority, all premised on the alleged \r\n  â€œspecial natureâ€ of the Act.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that the circuit \r\n  court erred in granting petitionerâ€™s motion to quash the indictment.\r\nThe declared purpose \r\n  of the Act is â€œto maintain reasonable standards of purity of the air and water \r\n  resources of the State . . . . â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§48-1-20 (1986).  Further, â€œto \r\n  secure these purposes and the enforcement of these provisions of this chapter \r\n  [DHEC] shall have authority to abate, control, and prevent pollution.â€  Id.  \r\n  The Act contemplates that persons or entities that violate the Act may be subject \r\n  to both civil and criminal liability.  See S. C. Code Ann. Â§Â§48-1-300; \r\n  48-1-320; and 48-1-330.  A civil violation can result in the imposition of a \r\n  penalty while a criminal violation may result in a fine and/or \r\n  imprisonment.  Compare Â§48-1-320 (criminal) with Â§48-1-330 (civil).  \r\n  The most critical statute provides:\r\nÂ§48-1-210.  Duties of Attorney General and solicitors.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General shall be \r\n  the legal advisor of the Department and shall upon request of the Department \r\n  institute injunction proceedings or any other court action to accomplish the \r\n  purpose of this chapter.  In the prosecution of any criminal action by the Attorney \r\n  General and in any proceeding before a grand jury in connection therewith the \r\n  Attorney General may exercise all the powers and perform all the duties which \r\n  the solicitor would otherwise be authorized or required to exercise or perform \r\n  and in such a proceeding the solicitor shall exercise such powers and perform \r\n  such duties as are requested of him by the Attorney General.\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends \r\n  this statute, read with the other provisions of the Act, vest prosecutorial \r\n  authority in DHEC.  Petitioner also relies on the fact that the attorney who \r\n  would prosecute petitionerâ€™s criminal case is a DHEC employee, who has been \r\n  appointed an acting Attorney General, rather than an Attorney Generalâ€™s employee.  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe first sentence of \r\n  Â§48-1-210 envisions that DHEC will be responsible for the administration and \r\n  prosecution of civil matters and penalties, unless it requests the involvement \r\n  of the Attorney General.  See also S. C. Code Ann. Â§48-1-50(7) (DHEC \r\n  may â€œ[s]ettle or comprise any action or cause of action for the recovery of \r\n  a penalty or damages under this chapterâ€¦â€); Â§48-1-50(11) (DHEC may â€œ[a]dminister \r\n  penaltiesâ€¦.â€).  On the other hand, the second sentence of Â§48-1-210 provides \r\n  unequivocally that the Attorney General, or the solicitor acting pursuant to \r\n  the Attorney Generalâ€™s instructions, will bring any criminal charges.\r\nWe agree with the Court \r\n  of Appeals that Â§ 48-1-220 could be read to affect this distribution of authority.  \r\n  This one sentence statute provides: â€œProsecutions for the violation of a final \r\n  determination or order shall be instituted only by [DHEC] or as otherwise provided \r\n  for in this chapter.â€ [4]   Petitioner would read this statute to grant \r\n  DHEC the authority to determine whether to pursue a criminal prosecution, while \r\n  acknowledging the Attorney Generalâ€™s sole authority to control the process once \r\n  the decision to prosecute is made.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that \r\n  reading the statute in this way would cause it to run afoul of S.C. Const. art. \r\n  V, Â§24.  This constitutional provision vests sole discretion to prosecute criminal \r\n  matters in the hands of the Attorney General.  In State v. Thrift, 312 \r\n  S.C. 282, 440 S.E.2d 341 (1994), this Court held that a statute purporting to \r\n  require an executive agency to refer a case before a criminal violation could \r\n  be prosecuted was violative of this provision.  If Â§48-1-220 were read to make \r\n  DHEC the gatekeeper for criminal prosecutions arising under the Act, the statute \r\n  would be unconstitutional.\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  properly construed Â§48-1-220.  It read the first clause of Â§48-1-220 to give \r\n  DHEC authority over civil prosecutions, and read the second clause, â€œor as otherwise \r\n  provided for in this chapter,â€ to refer to criminal prosecutions brought by \r\n  the Attorney General pursuant to the second sentence of Â§48-1-210.  The decision \r\n  whether to pursue criminal charges for an alleged violation of the Act is vested \r\n  solely in the Attorney General.  The corollary of this proposition is that the \r\n  authority to grant immunity from criminal prosecution also resides exclusively \r\n  in the Attorney General. Cf., Ex parte Littlefield, 343 S.C. 212, \r\n  540 S.E.2d 81 (2000) (prosecutorâ€™s discretion whether to try, to plea, or not \r\n  to prosecute at all).\r\nFurther, the fact that \r\n  the Attorney General has the authority to â€œdeputizeâ€ an attorney employed by \r\n  a state agency to act as an Attorney General for purposes of prosecuting a criminal \r\n  case does not convert Ms. Hunter-Shaw or DHEC itself into an Attorney General.  \r\n  As the Court of Appeals pointed out, the deputization here occurred after the \r\n  civil settlement, and the DHEC attorney so deputized played no part in that \r\n  settlement.\r\nThe Attorney General, \r\n  not DHEC, determines whether to pursue criminal charges for a violation of the \r\n  Act.  To construe the Act in a manner that involves DHEC in the decision to \r\n  initiate or pursue criminal charges would create a constitutional infirmity \r\n  where none need exist.  E.g., Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 549 \r\n  S.E.2d 591 (2001) (statutes to be given a constitutional construction when possible). \r\n\r\nPetitioner next argues \r\n  that because he and his attorney â€œreasonablyâ€ assumed Ms. Hunter-Shaw to be \r\n  settling both civil and criminal liability issues, she was possessed of either \r\n  actual or apparent authority to do so.  Alternatively, he contends that because \r\n  of these reasonable beliefs, the State should be estopped to now pursue these \r\n  criminal charges.  The Court of Appeals consolidated these claims, and held \r\n  that because Ms. Hunter-Shaw lacked actual authority to grant criminal immunity, \r\n  the State could not be estopped.  We agree.  E.g., Heyward v. South \r\n  Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 240 S.C. 347, 352, 126 S.E.2d 15, 18 (1962) (â€œThe question \r\n  is not one of intention, but of power; and, if the officer has not power to \r\n  act, his action is not state action, and so affords no basis upon which to predicate \r\n  estoppel against the stateâ€).\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  properly held that the Act did not and could not authorize a DHEC employee to \r\n  extend criminal immunity to petitioner.\r\nFinally, petitioner \r\n  argues that it is fundamentally unfair and a violation of his due process rights \r\n  to allow the State to criminally prosecute him under these circumstances.  He \r\n  asserts a number of different bases for this proposition:\r\n\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was compelled to deed away his property with the false   inducement that \r\n  the whole matter would be resolved;\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If and when he is tried, the fact that he deeded the plant makes him appear \r\n  guilty; and\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same woman who falsely induced him to deed the property secretly reported \r\n  him to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nIt may well have been unfair of \r\n  Ms. Hunter-Shaw not to reveal the fact that she had referred the matter for \r\n  criminal consideration.  We nevertheless do not find that her conduct rose to \r\n  a level that would cause us to question the constitutionality of petitionerâ€™s \r\n  criminal prosecution. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the \r\n  Court of Appeals reversing the circuit court order quashing the indictment is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, J., concurs.  BURNETT, \r\n  J., concurring in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., and WALLER, J., concur.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  While I agree with this Courtâ€™s ultimate legal conclusion, \r\n  I write separately to address the conduct of DHEC in this matter for fear that \r\n  it is emblematic of the agency and the manner in which it manages our Stateâ€™s \r\n  citizens. [5] \r\nTo demonstrate the impropriety of DHECâ€™s actions a fuller recitation of the \r\n  facts is necessary.  Mr. Peake and his attorney met with DHEC officials, including \r\n  Ms. Hunter-Shaw, in August of 1996, to discuss the operation of the private \r\n  water treatment plant.  At that time, Ms. Hunter-Shaw suggested Mr. Peake deed \r\n  the sewer system to the Town of Ninety-Six.  Mr. Peake, on the advice of his \r\n  attorney, initially declined to do so for two obvious reasons.  First, deeding \r\n  the sewer system would result in the loss of a $325,000 investment in the property.  \r\n  Second, Mr. Peake was concerned such a transfer could be considered as evidence \r\n  of guilt in any subsequent criminal prosecution.  \r\nMs. Hunter-Shaw did not inform Mr. Peake or his attorney that she had recommended \r\n  investigation for possible criminal violations.  At the time Ms. Hunter-Shaw \r\n  sought to persuade Mr. Peake to deed the plant to the city, she began the process \r\n  for Mr. Peakeâ€™s subsequent indictment on criminal charges.\r\nDespite several subsequent personal and telephone conferences, \r\n  Ms. Hunter-Shaw never informed Mr. Peakeâ€™s attorney that DHEC was recommending \r\n  criminal prosecution because she â€œdidnâ€™t think it was anything that he needed \r\n  to know.â€  Mr. Peakeâ€™s attorney, now a Master-In-Equity in Spartanburg County, \r\n  testified that he would not have advised his client to deed over the plant if \r\n  the concern of criminal prosecution had not been resolved.  Further, the attorney \r\n  testified of his telephone conversations with Ms. Hunter-Shaw, which included \r\n  repeated assurances that if Mr. Peake deeded the plant to the Town of Ninety \r\n  Six then the â€œentire matterâ€ would go away.\r\nOf no solace to Mr. Peake is the observation that \r\n  had the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office criminally charged him earlier than it had, \r\n  or even if DHEC ever directly notified him they recommended he be criminally \r\n  charged, this case would not have been resolved as it was.  Mr. Peake under \r\n  criminal indictment would be afforded substantial rights against what could \r\n  only be deemed prosecutorial misconduct.  In keeping the details of a criminal \r\n  prosecution secret while maintaining the prospect of settlement which could \r\n  â€œmake the whole thing go awayâ€ DHEC sought to gain control of Mr. Peakeâ€™s property \r\n  while keeping alive the option of criminal prosecution.\r\nTo Mr. Peake the settlement offer by DHEC must be \r\n  accepted to conclude civil and potential criminal proceedings.  In exchange \r\n  for surrendering the $325,000 investment in the property, Mr. Peake reasonably \r\n  concluded the threats of prosecution by the State would be ended.  Instead the \r\n  â€œsettlementâ€ effected the surrender of the opportunity to obtain any return \r\n  on his investment while still being held accountable for possible criminal charges.  \r\n  The settlement was all the more troublesome because the act of surrendering \r\n  the land could be viewed as an acknowledgement of guilt.\r\nAt best this case illustrates the problems which can \r\n  occur when a governmental organization entrusts the enforcement of complicated \r\n  statutes to those not trained to understand the import of telling a citizen \r\n  â€œdo this and all your trouble will go away.â€  \r\nAt worst the facts here demonstrate a cultural environment \r\n  at a State agency to abuse those the agency is entrusted to serve in order to \r\n  obtain their idea of maximum results.  It must be remembered, however, that \r\n  government is not business and DHEC does not exist to defeat competitors.  Instead, \r\n  it is a State agency entrusted with the stewardship of the peopleâ€™s environment.  \r\n  This stewardship means they must not only zealously guard the environment, but \r\n  must also be zealously on guard against a tendency to abuse its powers for what \r\n  it considers to be the greater good.\r\nAlthough the Attorney General retains prosecutorial authority, \r\n  agency responsibilities must be completed with openness, candor and integrity.  \r\n  The matter was not something removed from Ms. Hunter-Shawâ€™s control or on the \r\n  periphery of her responsibilities.  The decision to proceed criminally against \r\n  Mr. Peake came directly from a referral by Ms. Hunter-Shaw.  This calculated \r\n  conduct may have allowed DHEC to effect transfer of the plant to a town and \r\n  allow the State to seek a criminal indictment, but Mr. Peake was inequitably \r\n  treated.\r\nWhile Ms. Hunter-Shaw is not a prosecutor, she should be aware of the spirit \r\n  and Rules of Professional Conduct governing prosecutors.   See Rule 407, \r\n  SCACR.  Importantly, a prosecutor is charged with the responsibility of being \r\n  â€œa minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate. . . . [t]his responsibility \r\n  carries with it specific obligations to see that the defendant is accorded procedural \r\n  justice.â€  Id., hist. n. \r\nIt is the rule of a prosecuting attorney, and those \r\n  in government whose actions ultimately determine whether someone will be deprived \r\n  of liberty or property, to: \r\n\r\n\r\n  avoid the role of a partisan, eager to convict . . . [to] deal fairly with the \r\n  accused as well as the other participants . . . . to set a tone of fairness \r\n  and impartiality, and while he may and should vigorously pursue the Stateâ€™s \r\n  case, in so doing he must not abandon the quasi-judicial role with which he \r\n  is cloaked under the law.\r\n\r\nState v. Boyd, 160 W.Va. 234, 233 S.E.2d 710 (1977).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court in addressing the \r\n  prosecutorâ€™s role provided a caution all government officials would do well \r\n  to heed:\r\n\r\n[He] is the representative not of an ordinary party to a \r\n  controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is \r\n  as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, \r\n  in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice \r\n  shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant \r\n  of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence \r\n  suffer.\r\n\r\nBerger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. \r\n  1314, 1321 (1935).\r\nAlthough this result will be of little assistance to Mr. \r\n  Peake, perhaps State agency personnel will be constantly cognizant of the duty \r\n  to, not only zealously fulfill their responsibility, but do so with equity and \r\n  integrity.          \r\nTOAL, C.J., and WALLER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§48-1-10 to -350 (1986 and Supp. \r\n    2001).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Petitionerâ€™s current attorney did not participate \r\n    in the negotiations.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  We note that Ms. Hunter-Shaw is not an attorney.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  We note this statute does not apply to petitionerâ€™s \r\n    situation since, according to the indictment, the criminal charges arise out \r\n    of the violation of a permit and a statute, rather than from a violation of \r\n    a â€œfinal determination or order.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [5]\r\n    \r\n   \r\n    This case brings to mind these insights concerning governments.  In moments \r\n    of content we are apt to invoke Henry Clayâ€™s words that â€œGovernment is a trust, \r\n    and the officers of the government are trustees; and both the trust and the \r\n    trustees are created for the benefit of the people.â€  John Bartlett, â€œHenry \r\n    Clay Speech at Ashland, KY, in March 1829, Familiar Quotations, (10th \r\n    ed. 1919), available at http://www.bartleby.com/100/ 348.2.html.  \r\n    Yet the facts of this case bring out the harsher inclination to exclaim â€œ[t]he \r\n    nine most terrifying words in the English language are, â€˜Iâ€™m from the government \r\n    and Iâ€™m here to help.â€™â€  James B.
