(â€œTrinityâ€)\r\n  completed the construction of a home for Respondent Virginia Newman\r\n  (â€œHomeownerâ€) in May 1999.Â  Shortly thereafter, the Homeowner filed a claim\r\n  against Trinity for breach of contract, negligence, and breach of warranty,\r\n  alleging defective construction primarily related to the installation of the\r\n  stucco siding.Â  Based on the report of an engineer hired by the Homeowner to\r\n  inspect the homeâ€™s construction, the Homeowner alleged that the application of\r\n  the stucco did not conform to industry standards and that these nonconforming\r\n  aspects of the stucco installation allowed water to seep into the home causing\r\n  severe damage to the homeâ€™s framing and exterior sheathing.Â  The Homeowner and\r\n  Trinity referred the action to binding arbitration in which an arbitrator\r\n  issued the Homeowner an award of itemized damages due to the defective\r\n  construction totaling $55,898.Â  \r\nAt the time of construction, Trinity held a commercial\r\n  general liability (CGL) policy issued by Appellant Auto-Owners Insurance\r\n  Company (â€œAuto-Ownersâ€).Â  Following arbitration, Auto-Owners sought a\r\n  declaratory judgment to determine its rights and obligations under the CGL\r\n  policy, contending that the damages awarded by the arbitrator were not covered\r\n  under the policy.Â  The trial court determined that the policy covered the\r\n  damages because they resulted from an â€œoccurrenceâ€ and because Auto-Owners\r\n  failed to show that any policy exclusions applied.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court determined that the CGL policy covered all but four items of the damages\r\n  provided for in the arbitration award.Â  Auto-Owners appealed.Â  After certifying\r\n  the case, we affirmed the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Auto-Owners Ins. Co., Inc.\r\n    v. Newman, Op. No. 1383 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 10, 2008) (Shearouse\r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 63).Â  \r\n\r\n\tOn rehearing, we now consider the following issue for\r\n  review:\r\n\tDid the trial court err in holding that the damages\r\n  awarded by the arbitrator for negligent construction were covered under a CGL\r\n  policy?Â Â  \r\n\r\nStandard of review\r\nA declaratory judgment action is neither legal nor equitable,\r\n  and therefore, the standard of review is determined by the nature\r\n  of the underlying issue.Â  Colleton County Taxpayers Assâ€™n v. Sch.\r\n    Dist. of Colleton County, 371 S.C. 224, 231, 638 S.E.2d 685, 688 (2006).Â  When\r\n  the purpose of the underlying dispute is to determine whether coverage exists\r\n  under an insurance policy, the action is one at law.Â  Auto-Owners Ins. Co.\r\n    v. Haman, 368 S.C. 536, 540, 629 S.E.2d 683, 685 (Ct. App. 2006). Â In an\r\n  action at law tried without a jury, the appellate court will not disturb the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless there is no evidence to reasonably\r\n  support them. Id.Â Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nA.&nbsp; Negligent construction as\r\n  an â€œoccurrenceâ€ under the policy\r\nAuto-Owners argues that the arbitratorâ€™s award for the\r\n  Homeownerâ€™s property damage is not covered by the policy.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Auto-Owners argues that pursuant to this Courtâ€™s opinion in L-J v. Bituminous\r\n    Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., 366 S.C. 117, 621 S.E.2d 33 (2005), the\r\n  subcontractorâ€™s defective installation of stucco did not cause an â€œaccidentâ€\r\n  constituting an â€œoccurrenceâ€ subject to coverage under the policy.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nThe CGL\r\n  policy issued by Auto-Owners in this case is the standard Insurance Services\r\n  Office (ISO) CGL policy used since 1986 and is identical to that reviewed by\r\n  this Court in L-J.Â  The relevant policy provisions state that Auto\r\n  Owners will â€œpay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay\r\n  as damages because of â€˜bodily injuryâ€™ or â€˜property damageâ€™ to which this\r\n  insurance applies.â€Â  The policy further explains that the insurance applies to\r\n  such â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ only if it is caused by an â€œoccurrence.â€Â  \r\nThe CGL policy\r\n  defines many of the particular terms used to outline the scope of its\r\n  coverage.Â  The policy defines â€œproperty damageâ€ as â€œphysical injury to tangible\r\n  property, including all resulting loss of use of that property,â€ and defines an\r\n  â€œoccurrenceâ€ as â€œan accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to\r\n  substantially the same harmful conditions.â€Â  The policy does not define the\r\n  term â€œaccident,â€ however, and this Court has found that in the absence of a\r\n  prescribed definition in the policy, the definition of â€œaccidentâ€ is â€œ[a]n\r\n  unexpected happening or event, which occurs by chance and usually suddenly,\r\n  with harmful result, not intended or designed by the person suffering the harm\r\n  or hurt.â€Â  Green v. U. Ins. Co. of America, 254 S.C. 202, 206, 174 S.E.2d\r\n  400, 402 (1970).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  begin our analysis in this case with a review of L-J, which all parties,\r\n  as well as the trial court, assert in support of their respective resolutions\r\n  of the issue.Â  In L-J, a developer hired L-J, Inc. (â€œL-Jâ€) as contractor\r\n  for the site development and road construction in a subdivision development.Â \r\n  366 S.C. at 119, 621 S.E.2d at 34.Â  L-J hired subcontractors to perform most of\r\n  the work, and four years after construction was completed, the roads began to\r\n  deteriorate due to negligent road design, preparation, and construction.Â  Id.Â  The developer sued L-J and the parties settled.Â  L-J subsequently sought\r\n  indemnification from Bituminous Fire and Marine Insurance Company\r\n  (â€œBituminousâ€) and three other insurance companies who insured L-J under\r\n  various CGL policies.Â  Id.Â  Bituminous refused to indemnify L-J and\r\n  brought a declaratory judgment action to determine whether its CGL policy\r\n  issued to L-J covered the damage to the roads caused by the negligent\r\n  construction.Â  Id. at 120, 621 S.E.2d at 34.Â  \r\nThis Court\r\n  found that although the deterioration to the roadways may have constituted\r\n  property damage, the various negligent acts of the subcontractors upon which\r\n  the developer based its claim did not constitute an â€œoccurrenceâ€ for which the\r\n  CGL policy provided coverage.Â  Id. at 123, 621 S.E.2d at 36.Â \r\n  Specifically, the Court found that the developerâ€™s claim alleged negligent\r\n  construction causing damage only to the defective work product itself (i.e. the\r\n  roadway), and that such a claim was merely one for faulty workmanship.Â  Id.Â  Reasoning that â€œfaulty workmanship is not something that is typically\r\n  caused by an accident or by exposure to the same general harmful conditions,â€\r\n  the Court held that the developerâ€™s claim did not allege an â€œoccurrenceâ€\r\n  falling within the policyâ€™s scope of coverage.Â  Id.Â  See also Isle of\r\n    Palms Pest Control Co. v. Monticello Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 12, 16, 459 S.E.2d\r\n  318, 320 (Ct. App. 1994) (explaining that a claim solely for economic losses\r\n  resulting from faulty workmanship is part of an insuredâ€™s contractual liability\r\n  which a CGL policy is not intended to cover).\r\nThe L-J court went on to explain, however, that\r\n  a CGL policy may provide coverage where faulty workmanship causes third party\r\n  bodily injury or damage to other property besides the defective work product.Â  Id. n.4.Â  To illustrate this theory, the Court examined the case of High\r\n    Country Associates v. New Hampshire Insurance Co., in which a condominium\r\n  homeownersâ€™ association sued the condominium builder seeking damages allegedly\r\n  due to negligent construction of the condominium buildings.Â  648 A.2d 474, 476\r\n  (N.H. 1994).Â  The complaint alleged that the continuous moisture intrusion\r\n  resulting from a subcontractorâ€™s defective installation of siding resulted in\r\n  moisture seeping into the buildings, which caused widespread decay of the\r\n  interior and exterior walls and loss of structural integrity over a nine-year\r\n  period.Â  Id.Â  The High Country court found that the complaint was\r\n  not simply a claim for faulty workmanship seeking damages to repair the\r\n  defective siding itself, but rather, was a claim for negligent construction\r\n  resulting in damage to other property.Â  Id. at 477.Â  The court\r\n  determined that the continuous exposure to moisture due to the defective\r\n  installation of siding constituted an â€œoccurrenceâ€ under the policy and that,\r\n  in this way, the homeownersâ€™ association had properly â€œalleged negligent\r\n  construction that resulted in an occurrence, rather than an occurrence of\r\n  alleged negligent construction.â€Â  Id. at 478.Â  Accordingly, High\r\n    Country held that the CGL policy would cover the homeownersâ€™ associationâ€™s\r\n  claim against the builder, if successful.Â  Id.\r\nWe find High Country equally instructive in\r\n  determining whether a CGL policy provides coverage in the instant case where an\r\n  arbitrator determined that the Homeowner incurred damages as a result of the\r\n  negligent application of stucco by Trinityâ€™s subcontractor.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  arbitrator found that the defective stucco allowed for continuous moisture\r\n  intrusion resulting in substantial water damage to the homeâ€™s exterior\r\n  sheathing and wooden framing.[1]Â \r\n  In our view, these findings establish that there was â€œproperty damageâ€ beyond\r\n  that of the defective work product itself, and that therefore, the Homeownerâ€™s\r\n  claim is not merely a claim for faulty workmanship typically excluded under a\r\n  CGL policy.\r\nFurthermore, although the subcontractorâ€™s negligent\r\n  application of the stucco does not on its own constitute an â€œoccurrence,â€ we\r\n  find that the continuous moisture intrusion resulting from the subcontractorâ€™s\r\n  negligence is an â€œoccurrenceâ€ as defined by the CGL policy.Â  In our view, the\r\n  continuous moisture intrusion into the home was â€œan unexpected happening or\r\n  eventâ€ not intended by Trinity - in other words, an â€œaccidentâ€ - involving â€œcontinuous or\r\n  repeated exposure to substantially the same harmful conditions.â€Â  See Travelers\r\n    Indem. Co. of Am. v. Moore &amp; Assocs., 16 S.W.3d 302, 309 (Tenn.\r\n  2007) (holding that whether an â€œaccidentâ€ has occurred under the terms of a CGL\r\n  policy requires a court to determine whether damages would have been\r\n  foreseeable if the insured had completed the work properly).Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  hold that the subcontractorâ€™s negligence resulted in an â€œoccurrenceâ€ falling\r\n  within the CGL policyâ€™s initial grant of coverage for the resulting â€œproperty\r\n  damageâ€ to the homeâ€™s framing and exterior sheathing.Â  See also Penn. Mfrs.\r\n    Assoc. Ins. Co. v. Dargan Constr. Co.,2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53366\r\n  (D.S.C. July 13, 2006).\r\nWe note that interpreting â€œoccurrenceâ€ as we do in this\r\n  case gives effect to the subcontractor exception to the â€œyour workâ€ exclusion\r\n  in the standard CGL policy.Â  On this matter, a brief history of CGL policies is\r\n  instructive.Â  A CGL policy in the home construction industry is designed to cover\r\n  the risks faced by homebuilders when a homeowner asserts a post-construction\r\n  claim against the builder for damage to the home caused by alleged construction\r\n  defects.Â  See Rowland H. Long, The Law of Liability Insurance, Â§\r\n  3.06(1) (2007).Â  Several construction-specific exclusions in the standard CGL\r\n  policy exclude from coverage certain types of property damage attributable to\r\n  risks outside the scope of CGL recovery.Â  See id.Â  The primary\r\n  exclusion is the â€œyour workâ€ exclusion which provides that the policy will not\r\n  cover â€œâ€˜property damageâ€™ to â€˜your work.â€™â€Â  In 1986, the insurance industry\r\n  amended the â€œyour workâ€ exclusion to provide that even if the property damage\r\n  is to the builderâ€™s own work, the â€œyour workâ€ exclusion does not apply â€œif the\r\n  damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your\r\n  behalf by a subcontractor.â€Â  See French v. Assurance Co. of America, 448\r\n  F.3d 693, 701 (4th Cir. 2006) (discussing the evolution of the standard CGL\r\n  policy).Â  In doing so, the insurance industry extended liability coverage for\r\n  property damage to the contractorâ€™s completed work arising out of work\r\n  performed by the subcontractor.[2]Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe facts of this case establish exactly the type of\r\n  property damage the CGL policy was intended to cover after the 1986 amendment\r\n  to the â€œyour workâ€ exclusion.Â  In construing the provisions of an insurance\r\n  policy, the Court must consider the policy as a whole and adopt a construction\r\n  that gives effect to the whole instrument and to each of its various parts and\r\n  provisions.Â  Yarborough v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584,\r\n  592, 225 S.E.2d 344, 349 (1976).Â  To interpret â€œoccurrenceâ€ as narrowly as\r\n  Auto-Owners suggests would mean that any time a subcontractorâ€™s negligence led\r\n  to the damage of any part of the contractorâ€™s overall project, a CGL insurer\r\n  could deny recovery on the basis that it is excluded from the policyâ€™s initial\r\n  grant of coverage.Â  This interpretation would render both the â€œyour workâ€\r\n  exclusion and the subcontractorâ€™s exception to the â€œyour workâ€ exclusion in the\r\n  policy meaningless. [3]Â Â Â  See French, 448 F.3d at 705-06. \r\nFor these reasons, we hold that the trial court\r\n  correctly found that the negligent application of stucco resulted in an\r\n  â€œoccurrenceâ€ of water intrusion, causing â€œproperty damageâ€ that is covered\r\n  under Trinityâ€™s CGL policy.\r\nB.&nbsp; Operation of policy\r\n  exclusion to exclude damages awarded for replacing the substrate\r\nAuto-Owners argues that even if the subcontractorâ€™s\r\n  negligent application of stucco resulted in an â€œoccurrenceâ€ under the CGL\r\n  policy, coverage for the resulting property damage is nevertheless barred by a\r\n  policy exclusion.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn exclusion found in the standard CGL policy\r\n  prohibits coverage for â€œâ€˜property damageâ€™ expected or intended from the\r\n  standpoint of the insured.â€[4]Â \r\n  Auto-Owners claims that pursuant to this exclusion, damages awarded by the\r\n  arbitrator related to the framing and exterior sheathing of the home are not\r\n  covered under the CGL policy because a construction professional would expect\r\n  substantial moisture intrusion from defective stucco to result in these types\r\n  of damages.Â  In our opinion, and in the absence of any evidence otherwise, it\r\n  is unreasonable to believe that Trinity expected or intended its subcontractor\r\n  to perform negligently.Â  Therefore, Trinity could not have expected or intended\r\n  the resulting property damage.Â  Cf. Lamar Homes v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co.,\r\n  242 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex. 2007) (â€œBut a deliberate act, performed negligently, is\r\n  an accident if the effect is not the intended or expected result; that is, the\r\n  result would have been different had the deliberate act been performed\r\n  correctly.â€).Â  Accordingly, we hold that\r\n  the property damage to the homeâ€™s framing and exterior sheathing was not\r\n  expected or intended by Trinity, and therefore, coverage of the Homeownerâ€™s\r\n  property damage is not barred by this exclusion contained in the CGL policy.Â Â Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Damages awarded for\r\n  replacement of the defective stucco\r\nAuto-Owners finally argues that even if an\r\n  â€œoccurrenceâ€ warrants recovery for the Homeownerâ€™s property damage, the trial\r\n  court erred in determining that the CGL policy covered the arbitratorâ€™s\r\n  itemized allowance for replacing and repairing the defective stucco itself as\r\n  an incidental cost to repairing the damage to other property.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  standard CGL policy grants the insured broad liability coverage for property\r\n  damage and bodily injury which is then narrowed by a number of exclusions.Â \r\n  Each exclusion in the policy must be read and applied independently of every\r\n  other exclusion.Â  Engineered Products, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,\r\n  295 S.C. 375, 378-79, 368 S.E.2d 674, 675-76 (Ct. App. 1988) (quoting Weedo\r\n    v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., 405 A.2d 788, 795 (N.J. 1979)).Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the subcontractor exception preserves coverage for property damage that would\r\n  otherwise be excluded as â€œyour work,â€ another policy exclusion bars coverage\r\n  for damage to the defective workmanship itself.Â  Specifically, the policy\r\n  exclusion provides that the insurance does not cover damages â€œclaimed for any\r\n  loss, cost or expense . . . for the repair, replacement, adjustment, removal or\r\n  disposal of . . . â€˜Your productâ€™; . . . â€˜Your workâ€™; or . . . â€˜Impaired\r\n  propertyâ€™; if such product, work or property is withdrawn . . . from use . . .\r\n  because of a known or suspected defect, deficiency, inadequacy or dangerous\r\n  condition in it.â€Â  These terms unambiguously prohibit recovery for the cost of\r\n  removing and replacing the defective stucco - even when the replacement of the\r\n  defective work may be incidental to the repair of property damage covered by\r\n  the policy - and serve as one of the bases for this Courtâ€™s acknowledgment that\r\n  a claim solely for economic losses resulting from faulty workmanship is part of\r\n  an insuredâ€™s contractual liability which a CGL policy is not intended to cover.Â  See L-J, 366 S.C. at 122, 621 S.E.2d at 35.Â  Accordingly, we hold\r\n  that any amount in the arbitratorâ€™s allowance allotted to the removal and\r\n  replacement of the defective stucco is not covered under the CGL policy. \r\nNevertheless, it is not possible from the record\r\n  before this Court to determine what portion of the arbitratorâ€™s itemized list\r\n  of damages may be attributed to the removal and replacement of the defective\r\n  stucco, and it is not the purpose of this declaratory judgment action to\r\n  relitigate the issue of damages.Â  Auto-Owners had an opportunity to raise this\r\n  matter when the issue of damages was litigated before the arbitrator, who\r\n  issued a final, binding award on the merits.[5] Â See Pittman Mortg. Co. v. Edwards, 327 S.C. 72, 76, 488 S.E.2d 335, 337\r\n  (1997) (â€œGenerally, an arbitration award is conclusive and courts will refuse\r\n  to review the merits of an award.â€).Â  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision finding that the CGL policy issued by Auto-Owners to Trinity covers\r\n  the damage awarded by the arbitrator to the Homeowner.Â  Although we reverse the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision to the extent that it orders recovery under the policy\r\n  for the removal and replacement of the defective stucco, there is no evidence\r\n  in the record indicating which damages\r\n  may be attributed to the removal and replacement of the defective stucco. Â \r\nWALLER,\r\n  BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  We have held that faulty\r\n  workmanship by a subcontractor which results in property damage only to the\r\n  work product itself is not an occurrence within the meaning of that term in a\r\n  comprehensive general liability (CGL) policy.Â  L-J, Inc. v. Bituminous Fire\r\n    and Marine Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 117, 621 S.E.2d 33 (2005).Â  Here, the general\r\n  contractorâ€™s â€œwork productâ€ is the entire home, including the stucco, the\r\n  framing, and the exterior sheathing.Â  In my view, there is no coverage under\r\n  the CGL policy because there is no occurrence, rather only faulty workmanship.Â  L-J, Inc., supra.\r\nAs\r\n  we explained in Century Indemnity Co. v. Golden Hills Bldrs., Inc., 348\r\n  S.C. 559, 561 S.E.2d 355 (2002):\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  comprehensive general liability policy, such as the one at issue, provides\r\n  coverage â€œfor all the risks of legal liability encountered by a business\r\n  entity,â€ with coverage excluded for certain specific risks.Â  Rowland H. Long,\r\n  L.L.M., The Law of Liability Insurance, Â§ 3.06[1] (2001).Â  This type of\r\n  insurance â€œis not intended to insure business risks, i.e., risks that\r\n  are normal, frequent, or predictable consequences of doing business, and which\r\n  business management can and should control or manage.â€Â  Id. Â§ 10.01\r\n  [1].Â  Specifically, â€œ[t]he policies do not insure [an insuredâ€™s] work itself,\r\n  but rather, they generally insure consequential risks that stem from that\r\n  work.â€Â  Id.

Co., 226 Ga.App. 200, 486 S.E.2d 71, 75 (1997) (noting risk intended to be insured is\r\n  possibility that work of insured, once completed, will cause bodily injury or\r\n\tdamage\r\n    to property other than to completed work itself, and for which insured may\r\n  be found liable; coverage applicable under CGL policy is for tort liability for\r\n  injury to persons and damage to other property and not for contractual\r\n  liability of insured for economic loss because completed work is not that for\r\n  which the damaged person bargained).\r\n\r\nId. at 565-66, 561 S.E.2d at 358 (emphasis in original).\r\nUnder the relevant\r\n  provisions of this CGL policy, Auto Owners is responsible for â€œproperty damageâ€\r\n  that is caused by an â€œoccurrence.â€Â  â€œOccurrenceâ€ as used in the policy â€œmeans\r\n  an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the\r\n  same general harmful conditions.â€Â  Faulty workmanship by subcontractors which\r\n  leads to deterioration or damages the work product itself is not an accident\r\n  within the meaning of a CGL policy.Â  L-J, Inc., supra.[6]Â \r\n  In L-J, as the majority notes, we also explained that there may be\r\n  coverage where faulty workmanship causes third party bodily injury or damage to\r\n  property other than the contractorâ€™s work product.Â  Here, we have neither\r\n  bodily injury nor damage to anything other than the contractorâ€™s work product.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  majority relies on High Country Assocs. v. New Hamp. Ins. Co., 139 N.H.\r\n  39, 648 A.2d 474 (1994), and finds that damage caused to other parts of the\r\n  house by the stucco subcontractorâ€™s faulty workmanship is a claim of property\r\n  damage beyond that of the defective work itself, and thus covered under the\r\n  policy.Â  I disagree.\r\nAs noted above, the\r\n  â€œwork productâ€[7] is the entire home constructed by Trinity for the Homeowners.Â  See L-J,\r\n    Inc., supra.Â  While I agree that High Country appears to\r\n  distinguish between the construction of the condominium units themselves (the\r\n  work product) and the damage done to the structure of these units, a later New\r\n  Hampshire case which cites High Country makes it clear that coverage\r\n  under a CGL policy exists only where there is actual damage to property other\r\n  than the insuredâ€™s work product.Â  Webster v. Acadia Ins. Co., 156 N.H.\r\n  317, 934 A.2d 567 (2007) (CGL coverage where negligent installation of new roof\r\n  caused damage to preexisting rafters).Â  As I understand High Country in\r\n  light of Webster, there would be no coverage here as only Trinityâ€™s\r\n  â€œwork productâ€ has been damaged as a result of the stucco subcontractorâ€™s\r\n  faulty workmanship.\r\nFinally,\r\n  I do not believe we need look at the terms of a policyâ€™s exclusion in order to\r\n  determine coverage.Â  Under existing South Carolina law, there is no occurrence\r\n  here, thus no property damage, and therefore no coverage.Â  The â€œyour workâ€\r\n  exclusion applies only where there is, in fact, â€œproperty damageâ€ to â€œyour\r\n  work.â€Â  Absent that threshold showing of coverage, there is no reason to reach\r\n  the exclusion, much less the subcontractor exception to the exclusion.Â  Compare Laidlaw Enviro. Serv. (TOC) v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Assur. Co. of Ill., 338\r\n  S.C. 43, 524 S.E.2d 847 (Ct. App. 1999) (exclusion does not create coverage but\r\n  limits it).\r\nI would reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] According to expert testimony from the consulting engineer hired by the Homeowner,\r\n  the subcontractorâ€™s application of stucco did not meet applicable building code\r\n  requirements and deviated from industry standards.Â  The expert testified that\r\n  the subcontractor did not apply the stucco to the required thickness; failed to\r\n  install a weep system or flashing around doors and windows; and used improper\r\n  caulking and banding methods.\r\n[2] C.D. Walters Construction Co., Inc. v. Firemanâ€™s Insurance Co., cited by\r\n  Auto-Owners in support of its argument, is distinguishable from the instant\r\n  case because it denied coverage under a CGL policy based on the â€œyour workâ€\r\n  policy exclusion before the 1986 modification to cover damage resulting from\r\n  subcontractor negligence.Â  281 S.C. 593, 597-98, 316 S.E.2d 709, 712 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\nWe would\r\n  also distinguish this Courtâ€™s decision in Century Indemnity Co. v. Golden\r\n    Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 561 S.E.2d 355 (2002), because the\r\n  coverage period for the policy at issue expired while the contractor was still\r\n  in possession of the home.Â  \r\n[3] In adopting this interpretation, the dissent asserts that we need not â€œlook at\r\n  the terms of a policyâ€™s exclusion in order to determine coverage.â€Â \r\n  Nevertheless, in order to determine the proper meaning of the term\r\n  â€œoccurrence,â€ we must read the policy as a whole and consider â€œthe context and\r\n  subject matter of the insurance contract.â€Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire and\r\n    Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003).Â  We decline to\r\n  adopt any construction of the CGL policy that renders a significant exclusion\r\n  meaningless, notwithstanding the objections voiced by the dissent.Â Â  \r\n[4] We note that instead of containing an exclusion to this effect, the pre-1986\r\n  CGL policy included this language in its initial grant of coverage as part of\r\n  the definition of â€œoccurrence.â€Â  See French, 448 F.3d at 701.Â  Although,\r\n  in our view, an analysis under our modern jurisprudence as to whether or not\r\n  there was an â€œoccurrenceâ€ essentially subsumes this particular 1986 amendment\r\n  to the policy, we set forth an analysis of the exclusionâ€™s applicability in\r\n  this case for the sake of completeness.\r\n[5] Auto-Owners represented Trinity in binding arbitration, made mandatory by the\r\n  terms of the insurance contract.Â  Auto-Owners did so with a reservation of\r\n  rights and an understanding that the coverage issue would be reserved for\r\n  judicial consideration in a separate proceeding.Â  When the arbitrator determined\r\n  damages, Auto-Owners did not seek review of or otherwise contest the damages\r\n  award.Â  \r\n[6] In my opinion, the definition of â€œaccidentâ€ in Travelers Indem. Co. of Am.\r\n  v. Moore &amp; Assoc., 216 S.W.3d 302 (Tenn. 2007), relied upon by the\r\n  majority, is fundamentally inconsistent with the definition we adopted in L-J,\r\n    Inc., supra.Â  See Gen. Sec. Indem. Co. of Az. v. Mtn.\r\n      States Mut. Cas. Co., 205 P.3d 529 (Colo. App. 2009) (identifying L-J,\r\n        Inc. as following majority rule that construction defect claims are not\r\n  accidents under a CGL policy and Moore as a minority rule decision).Â Â Â  \r\n[7] The CGL does not use this term: it is a combination of â€œyour productâ€ and â€œyour\r\n  work,â€ both terms defined under the contract.Â  Here, we are actually talking\r\n  about â€œyour workâ€ which means:Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\ta.&nbsp; work or\r\n  operations performed by you or on your behalf; and\r\n\tb.&nbsp; materials,\r\n  parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26715","title":"Brazell v.

C. Buddy Nicholson, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nOpinion No.Â  26715\r\nHeard June 10, 2009 - Filed September 8,\r\n  2009Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tBrian\r\n  Dumas, of Peake, Fowler &amp; Associates, of Columbia, for Petitioners.\r\n\t\t\t\tJ.\r\n  Rutledge Young, Jr., Stephen L. Brown, William L. Howard, Sr., and Russell G.\r\n  Hines, all of Young, Clement, Rivers, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Petitioners\r\n  filed a breach of contract action against Respondent arising out of a purchase\r\n  contract for the sale of a home and sought rescission of the entire contract.Â \r\n  The trial court granted Respondentâ€™s 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss the\r\n  remedy of rescission and the court of appeals affirmed.Â  We granted a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review that decision and now reverse.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn October 20, 2004, Petitioners and Respondent\r\n  entered into a sales contract for the purchase of a home located on Edisto\r\n  Island.Â  The closing took place on November 30, 2004.Â  Although neither party\r\n  was present at the closing, Petitioners executed a HUD-1 Settlement Statement\r\n  and a deed to Respondent prior to the closing, and the parties submitted\r\n  pre-signed closing documents at the closing.Â  The total purchase price of the\r\n  home was $550,000, and after satisfying liens on the property, Petitioners were\r\n  to receive $327,818.54.\r\nOn December 3, 2004, Respondent notified Petitioners\r\n  that the reverse osmosis water filtration system did not work.Â  On December 6,\r\n  2004, the deed was recorded.Â  Respondentâ€™s attorney forwarded a check of the\r\n  net proceeds to Petitioners but withheld $2,000 from the check and noted that\r\n  the amount reflected the â€œsellersâ€™ proceeds less $2,000 escrow for reverse\r\n  osmosis system repair.â€Â  The attorney sent an escrow agreement regarding how\r\n  the parties would treat the $2,000.Â  Petitioners refused to sign the escrow\r\n  agreement and refused to accept the check.Â  \r\nPetitioners filed suit alleging breach of contract and\r\n  seeking rescission of the entire contract.Â  The trial court reviewed the complaint\r\n  as well as the HUD-1 Statement and granted Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss the\r\n  remedy of rescission.Â \r\n  The court of appeals affirmed.Â  Brazell v. Windsor, 376 S.C. 83, 655\r\n  S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the\r\n  following issues:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in holding that the \r\n\t\t\tRule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion was not converted into a motion for summary\r\n  judgment after the trial court considered the HUD-1 Statement, which was not\r\n  attached to the complaint?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in holding the trial \r\n\t\t\tcourt properly granted the motion to dismiss the remedy of \r\n\t\t\trescission?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of\r\n  Review\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), a defendant may move\r\n  to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute\r\n  a cause of action.Â  If the facts and inferences drawn from the facts alleged in\r\n  the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, would\r\n  entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then the grant of a motion to\r\n  dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper.Â  Gentry v. Yonce, 337\r\n  S.C. 1, 5, 522 S.E.2d 137, 139 (1999). Â In deciding whether the trial court\r\n  properly granted the motion to dismiss, the appellate court must consider\r\n  whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\r\n  states any valid claim for relief. Â Id.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI. HUD-1 Statement\r\nPetitioners argue that the court of appeals erred in\r\n  holding that the trial court did not convert the 12(b)(6) motion into a summary\r\n  judgment motion in considering the HUD-1 Statement which was not attached to\r\n  the complaint.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn the complaint, Petitioners alleged that Respondent\r\n  had not paid the amount due under the sales contract â€œas set forth upon the\r\n  HUD-1 Settlement Statement attached to and incorporated herein by reference.â€Â \r\n  Although Petitioners failed to actually attach the HUD-1 Statement to the\r\n  complaint, Respondentâ€™s counsel attached a copy of it to their memorandum in\r\n  support of\r\n  the motion to dismiss the remedy of rescission.Â  The trial court specifically referenced\r\n  the HUD-1 statement in its order and considered the document in making the\r\n  ruling.\r\nA copy of a document which is an exhibit to a pleading\r\n  is a part of the pleading for all purposes if a copy is attached to such a\r\n  pleading. Â Rule 10(c), SCRCP.Â Â Â  In considering a\r\n  12(b)(6) motion, the trial court must base its ruling solely upon the allegations\r\n  set forth on the face of the complaint.Â  However, on a 12(b)(6) motion,\r\n  if matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by a court,\r\n  the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as\r\n  provided in Rule 56, SCRCP, and all parties shall be given reasonable\r\n  opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.Â  See Rule 12(b), SCRCP.\r\nWe hold that the trial court did not convert the\r\n  12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment by considering the HUD-1\r\n  Statement in making his ruling.Â  Petitioners explicitly stated that the\r\n  Statement was attached and incorporated by reference into the complaint.Â  Thus,\r\n  they brought the HUD-1 Statement to the attention of trial court and were on\r\n  notice of any information contained in it. Â In our view, allowing a trial court\r\n  to consider documents that are incorporated by reference in the complaint but\r\n  not actually attached thereto prevents a plaintiff from benefiting from his own\r\n  oversight or from surviving a motion to dismiss by intentionally omitting\r\n  documents upon which their claims are based.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not\r\n  convert the 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment by considering\r\n  the HUD-1 Statement.Â  \r\nII. Motion to Dismiss\r\nPetitioners argue the court of appeals erred in\r\n  affirming the trial courtâ€™s grant of Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss the remedy\r\n  of rescission.Â  We agree.\r\nA breach of contract claim warranting\r\n  rescission of the contract must be so substantial and fundamental as to defeat\r\n  the purpose of the contract.Â  Rogers v.\r\n    Salisbury Brick Corp., 299\r\n  S.C. 141, 143, 382 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1989).\r\n  Â Thus, a rescission will not be granted for a minor or\r\n  casual breach of a contract, but only for those breaches which defeat the\r\n  object of the contracting parties.Â  Id. at 143-44, 382 S.E.2d at 917.Â \r\n  In the absence of fraud, rescission is appropriate only if both parties can be\r\n  returned to the status quo prior to the contract.Â  King v. Oxford, 282\r\n  S.C. 307, 313, 318 S.E.2d 125, 129 (Ct. App.\r\n  1984).Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn the complaint, Petitioners alleged\r\n  Respondent breached the contract:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\ta.\r\n\t\t\t\tIn proceeding with the closing on\r\n  terms other than those as specified in the written agreement; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tb.\r\n\t\t\t\tIn failing to honor the â€œtime is\r\n  of the essenceâ€ provision of the agreement;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tc. \r\n\t\t\t\tIn failing initially to forward\r\n  any proceeds of the sale as specified in the duly executed HUD-1 Settlement\r\n  Statement to the [Petitioners] in a timely manner;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\td. \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn failing to subsequently forward\r\n  appropriate funds as clearly specified on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\te.\r\n\t\t\t\tBy arbitrarily and unilaterally\r\n  withholding funds from the [Petitioners]; all of the above constituting substantial\r\n  and material breaches of the written agreement for sale of real estate as\r\n  existing between the parties.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court found that the allegation\r\n  that Respondent withheld $2,000 from the contract price was a minor breach as a\r\n  matter of law and that rescission would not restore either party to the status\r\n  quo.Â  Similarly, the court of appeals held that the remedy of rescission was\r\n  not available because the alleged breach was not fundamental or substantial\r\n  enough to defeat the purpose of the contract.Â  However, the court of appeals\r\n  declined to address whether the parties could be returned to the status quo in\r\n  light of its dispositive holding that the breach was not fundamental.\r\nWe hold that the trial court erred in\r\n  granting Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss the remedy of rescission, and likewise,\r\n  that the court of appeals erred in affirming this decision.Â  In the complaint, Petitioners alleged Respondent breached several\r\n  provisions in the contract by withholding $2,000 from the purchase price.Â \r\n  While $2,000 may constitute a relatively small portion of the total purchase\r\n  price, Petitioners alleged the withholding of the proceeds was a material\r\n  breach, and thus, the allegations support a claim for relief.\r\nIn our view, the trial courtâ€™s and court\r\n  of appealsâ€™ error stems from focusing on the dollar amount withheld in determining whether Respondentâ€™s actions defeated\r\n  the purpose of the contract and the objective of the contracting parties.[1]Â \r\n  Numerous legal documents are executed in a real estate transaction and several\r\n  entities involved in the transaction, including the buyer, seller, lender,\r\n  mortgage company, and title insurance company, rely on the finality of the\r\n  closing.Â  Indeed, this Court has noted the importance of attorneysâ€™ compliance\r\n  with the proper real estate closing standards in disciplinary matters.Â  See\r\n    In re Barbare, 360 S.C. 560, 573, 602 S.E.2d 382, 388 (2004) and In re Lathan, 360 S.C. 326, 339, 600 S.E.2d 902, 908-09 (2004) (noting the Courtâ€™s trouble with â€œreal estate\r\n  transactions which have been the subject of misleading, fraudulent, and/or\r\n  criminal schemes. Inaccurate HUD-1 Settlement Statements and other closing\r\n  documents contribute to these deceptive activities.â€).Â  For these reasons, real\r\n  estate contracts are unique and courts should evaluate the purpose of\r\n  the real estate contract and the materiality of a breach in light of these\r\n  differences.\r\nIn the instant case, we find that the overriding\r\n  purpose of the contract was not merely to receive proceeds from the sale of a\r\n  home, but rather to finalize a real estate transaction and transfer title from\r\n  Petitioners to Respondent.Â  Respondent could have negotiated for provisions in\r\n  the contract regarding the reverse osmosis system or could have sought relief\r\n  by filing her own breach of contract action.Â  By withholding proceeds from the\r\n  purchase price, however, the transaction was not final, thereby potentially\r\n  defeating the purpose of the contract.\r\nAs a final matter, we hold that the trial court erred\r\n  in dismissing the remedy of rescission because the parties could not be\r\n  restored to the status quo.Â  Petitioners immediately took action after\r\n  Respondent failed to act in accordance with the contract.Â  When Respondent\r\n  failed to deliver the entire amount specified in the contract, Petitioners\r\n  instructed Respondent not to file the deed or take any further action regarding\r\n  title to the property.Â  Petitioners refused to accept the check or sign the\r\n  escrow agreement.Â  Nine days later, Petitioners filed the breach of contract\r\n  action seeking rescission of the contract â€œreturning the parties to the status\r\n  quo.â€Â  Moreover, it is feasible and practicable to transfer title in the\r\n  property back to Petitioners and return any additional moneys paid to restore\r\n  the parties to their original position.Â  See Ellie,\r\n    Inc. v. Miccichi, 358\r\n  S.C. 78, 94, 594 S.E.2d 485, 494 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004) (noting that rescission entitles the party to a return of the\r\n  consideration paid as well as any additional sums necessary to restore him to\r\n  the position occupied prior to the making of the contract).Â  \r\nWe note that whether it would be fair and equitable to\r\n  rescind the contract is a different issue from whether Petitioners have\r\n  sufficiently alleged a material breach of contract and sufficiently alleged\r\n  that rescission would allow them to be restored to the status quo.Â Â  See King, 282 S.C. at 314-15, 318 S.E.2d at 129 (refusing to rescind the\r\n  contract where the plaintiff would be materially prejudiced by rescission and\r\n  where the defendant could not restore the plaintiff to his former position).Â \r\n  Likewise, whether Petitioners would be able to survive a motion for summary\r\n  judgment is a different issue from whether Petitioners have failed to state a\r\n  claim.Â  We merely hold that because Petitioners have stated facts which, if\r\n  true, would entitle them to relief, the trial court erred in granting\r\n  Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss the remedy of rescission.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the court of\r\n  appeals correctly held that the trial court did not convert the 12(b)(6) motion\r\n  into a motion for summary judgment in considering the HUD-1 Settlement\r\n  Statement, but erred in affirming the grant of Respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss\r\n  the remedy of rescission.Â  Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further\r\n  proceedings.Â  \r\nWALLER, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.\r\n  Moore, concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent and would affirm the Court of\r\n  Appeals which upheld the trial courtâ€™s order granting respondentâ€™s Rule 12\r\n  (b)(6), SCRCP motion.Â  In my opinion, placing $2,000 in an escrow account\r\n  pending resolution of the reverse osmosis system issue may not have been the\r\n  best decision, but it was in no way â€œso substantial and fundamental as to\r\n  defeat the purpose of the contract.â€Â  Moreover, I do not agree with the\r\n  majority that a special standard should apply to real estate transactions,\r\n  since in my view the purpose of any sale is to transfer title from the seller\r\n  to the buyer.Â  Finally, I agree with the trial judge that rescission cannot lie\r\n  here as it is impossible to return respondent to the status quo ante the\r\n  closing.\r\nI would affirm.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In the order, the trial court noted that Respondent paid 99.6% of the contract\r\n  price and withheld only .04%.Â  The court found that Petitionersâ€™ complaint was\r\n  â€œover a minor .04%.â€\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26716","title":"Smith v.

Smith served\r\n  time on weekends at the Barnwell County Detention Center, where he was directed\r\n  to engage in various work activities.[1]Â \r\n  Smith also worked during the week at Bowe Construction.Â  While working at a\r\n  landfill during his weekend sentence, Smith fell from a tractor and injured his\r\n  back.\r\nBarnwell County elected\r\n  to cover its prisoners under the workersâ€™ compensation program, as allowed by\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-500 (2005).Â  Barnwell County accepted Smithâ€™s claim for\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation and began paying him compensation based upon an average\r\n  weekly wage of $40 a week, the amount provided in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-7-65 (2005)\r\n  as the average weekly wage for county and municipal prisoners.Â  Smith then\r\n  filed a Form 50 with the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission contending that the\r\n  average weekly wage from his regular employment, which he claimed was $333.82,\r\n  should also be included in determining his compensation.\r\nFollowing\r\n  a hearing, the single commissioner ruled that Smith could not include the\r\n  average weekly wage from his regular employment.Â  The full commission affirmed\r\n  and the circuit court reversed the full commission.Â  Barnwell County appealed.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in finding that Smith is an â€œemployeeâ€ \r\n\t\t\tof Barnwell County?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in finding that Smith may combine \r\n\t\t\twages from civilian employment with the statutory average weekly \r\n\t\t\twage for county prisoners?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  amount of compensation awarded under the workersâ€™ compensation statutes is\r\n  based on the workerâ€™s average weekly wage.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 provides\r\n  the method for calculating the average weekly wage, but allows for deviation\r\n  from the method â€œfor exceptional reasons . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40\r\n  (2005).Â  This Court has held that concurrent employment is one such exceptional\r\n  reason.Â  See Foreman v. Jackson Minit Markets, Inc., 265 S.C.\r\n  164, 217 S.E.2d 214 (1975).\r\nBarnwell County argues on appeal that Smith was not an\r\n  â€œemployeeâ€ of Barnwell County and therefore, since Smith was not working for\r\n  two or more employers when the injury occurred, Smith may not recover\r\n  compensation for concurrent employment.Â  We need not reach this issue because\r\n  we agree with the County that, even assuming Smith is an â€œemployeeâ€ for workersâ€™\r\n  compensation purposes, he may not combine wages under Â§ 42-1-40.Â  \r\nOriginally,\r\n  the average weekly wage for prisoners was addressed in Â§ 42-1-40, which\r\n  contained the â€œexceptional reasonsâ€ provision.[2]Â \r\n  In 1983, after this Courtâ€™s decision in Foreman, the General Assembly\r\n  removed the inmate section from Â§ 42-1-40 and included it in the newly-created\r\n  Â§ 42-7-65, which contains no â€œexceptional reasonsâ€ provision.Â  Section 42-7-65\r\n  is entitled â€œAverage weekly wage designated for certain categories of\r\n  employeesâ€[3] and provides in part, â€œ[t]he average weekly wage for county and municipal\r\n  prisoners is forty dollars a week.â€\r\nBy\r\n  removing inmates from Â§ 42-1-40, designating a specific weekly wage for\r\n  inmates, and not providing an â€œexceptional reasonsâ€ provision in Â§ 42-7-65, we\r\n  find that the General Assembly intended that inmates not be allowed to combine\r\n  wages in determining their average weekly wage.Â  Compare Boles v. Una\r\n    Water District, 291 S.C. 282, 353 S.E.2d 286 (1987) (holding that volunteer\r\n  firefighter may combine wages where firefighterâ€™s average weekly wage was set\r\n  forth in Â§ 42-1-40).Â  If the General Assembly had not intended such a result,\r\n  there would have been no reason to remove inmates from Â§ 42-1-40.Â  See Cannon\r\n    v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Serv., 371 S.C. 581,\r\n  430, 641 S.E.2d 429, 584 (2007), citing Denene, Inc. v. City of\r\n    Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 574 S.E.2d 196 (2002) (it must be presumed the\r\n  Legislature did not intend a futile act, but rather intended its statutes to\r\n  accomplish something).\r\nGiven\r\n  the above, we find that the General Assembly intended to deny inmates the\r\n  ability to combine wages in determining their average weekly wage.Â  See State\r\n    v. Scott, 351 S.C. 584, 588, 571 S.E.2d 700, 702 (2002) (The cardinal rule\r\n  of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.). Â Smith\r\n  is therefore limited to the average weekly wage provided by Â§ 42-7-65.[4]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAssuming arguendo that Smith is an â€œemployeeâ€ for purposes of the workersâ€™\r\n  compensation statute, we find that Smith may not combine wages.Â  The General\r\n  Assembly did not intend for an inmate to be able to combine wages in\r\n  determining his average weekly wage.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Though the record is silent as to whether Smithâ€™s labor was mandatory or\r\n  voluntary, he was apparently engaged in a voluntary program for labor on public\r\n  works allowed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-235 (2005).\r\n[2] Though Â§ 42-1-40 only specifically addressed the average weekly wage of inmates\r\n  of the State of South Carolina, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-500 (1977) provided for\r\n  workerâ€™s compensation coverage for certain county inmates in accordance with\r\n  the statutes addressing coverage for State inmates.Â  \r\n[3] 1983 Act No. 33, Â§ 1; county prisoners were added in 1991 Act. No. 16, Â§ 2.\r\n[4] We reject Smithâ€™s argument that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-7-65 (2005), as interpreted\r\n  by Appellant, is penal in nature and so, must be strictly construed against the\r\n  governmental entity seeking to enforce it.Â  â€œA determination of whether a\r\n  statute is civil or criminal in nature is primarily a question of statutory\r\n  construction, which begins by reference to the actâ€™s text and legislative\r\n  history.â€Â  See In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 648, 550 S.E.2d 311,\r\n  316 (2001).Â  â€œWhere the legislature has manifested its intent that the\r\n  legislation is civil in nature, the party challenging that classification must\r\n  provide â€˜the clearest proof that the statutory scheme is so punitive in either\r\n  purpose or effect as to negate the [legislatureâ€™s] intention.â€™â€ Id.Â  In the instant case, Smith has failed to show the punitive nature of Â§ 42-7-65,\r\n  a part of the workerâ€™s compensation act.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Lynch v.

Â We are not asked nor do we attempt to offer an opinion on the ultimate\r\n  issues of coverage in this case.Â  The ultimate questions of coverage remain\r\n  with the federal district court.\r\nI.\r\nSuper Duper, Inc., a\r\n  South Carolina corporation, manufactures education and therapy materials for\r\n  children.Â  Mattel, Inc., an international toy manufacturer, challenged Super\r\n  Duperâ€™s registration of four trademarks and filed formal notices of opposition\r\n  and petitions for cancellation with the United States Patent and Trademark\r\n  Office.Â  Super Duper brought a declaratory judgment action in the federal\r\n  district court to determine if its trademark infringed on Mattelâ€™s trademarks. Â Mattel\r\n  counterclaimed asserting trademark infringement along with other claims.\r\nSuper Duper was\r\n  insured by Travelers Indemnity Company of America and Travelers Property\r\n  Casualty Company of America (collectively â€œTravelersâ€) and Pennsylvania\r\n  National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company (â€œPenn Nationalâ€) under commercial\r\n  general liability insurance policies for â€œadvertising injury.â€ Â Super Duper\r\n  notified Travelers and Penn National about the trademark infringement\r\n  counterclaims and requested coverage.Â  Travelers and Penn National denied\r\n  coverage and refused to provide Super Duper a defense.Â  Thus, Super Duper\r\n  defended itself.Â  Subsequently, Mattel prevailed on its trademark infringement\r\n  claims.\r\nSuper\r\n  Duper brought this action in the federal district court seeking a declaratory\r\n  judgment and damages for failure to defend or indemnify, breach of contract,\r\n  and bad faith.\r\nA.\r\nThis\r\n  case involves three CGL policies provided by Travelers: 1999 policy (effective\r\n  from August 26, 1999 through August 26, 2000), 2000 policy (effective from\r\n  August 26, 2000 through August 26, 2001), and 2005 policy (effective from\r\n  August 26, 2005 through August 26, 2006).Â  The 1999 and 2000 CGL policies\r\n  include the following definition:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œAdvertising injuryâ€ means\r\n  injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses:\r\n\ta.&nbsp; Oral or written publication of material that slanders\r\n  or libels a person or organization or disparages a personâ€™s or organizationâ€™s\r\n  goods, products or services;\r\n\tb.&nbsp; Oral or written publication of material that violates\r\n  a personâ€™s right of privacy;\r\n\tc.&nbsp; Misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of\r\n  doing business; or\r\n\td.&nbsp; Infringement of copyright, title or slogan.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).[1]Â \r\n  The 2005 policy redefined â€œadvertising injuryâ€ as arising out of one or more of\r\n  the following offenses:\r\n\r\n\ta.&nbsp; Oral, written or electronic\r\n  publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or\r\n  disparages a personâ€™s or organizationâ€™s goods, products or services, provided\r\n  that claim is made or â€œsuitâ€ is brought by a person or organization that claims\r\n  to have been slandered or libeled, or whose goods, products or services have\r\n  allegedly been disparaged;\r\n\tb.&nbsp; Oral, written or electronic\r\n  publication of material that appropriates a personâ€™s likeness, unreasonably\r\n  places a person in a false light or gives unreasonable publicity to a personâ€™s\r\n  private life; or\r\n\tc.&nbsp; Infringement of copyright,\r\n  title or slogan, provided that claim\r\n  is made or â€œsuitâ€ is brought by a person or organization claiming ownership of such\r\n  copyright, title or slogan.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).[2]\r\n&nbsp;Effective from\r\n  August 26, 2005 to August 26, 2006, Travelers provided a Commercial Excess Liability\r\n  Umbrella (CUP) insurance policy for Super Duper.Â  This policy also included\r\n  â€œ[i]nfringement of copyright, title or sloganâ€ in its definition of\r\n  â€œadvertising injury.â€\r\nWe\r\n  turn next to the Penn National CGL policies, which were in effect August 26,\r\n  2001 through August 26, 2002 (referred to as â€œ2001 policyâ€) and August 26, 2002\r\n  through August 26, 2003 (referred to as â€œ2002 policyâ€).Â  The 2002 policy was\r\n  renewed for consecutive one-year terms, ending on August 26, 2006.Â  Unlike the\r\n  Traveler policies, the relevant Penn National Policies (2001 policy and 2002\r\n  policy) defined â€œadvertisement.â€Â  The 2001 Penn National policy stated,\r\n  â€œâ€˜[a]dvertisementâ€™ means a notice that is broadcast or published to the general\r\n  public or specific market segments about your goods, products or services for\r\n  the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.â€[3]Â \r\n  The 2002 Penn National policy mirrored the precedent policy only adding\r\n  references about the Internet and websites.\r\nThe\r\n  2001 and 2002 Penn National policies also included definitions for â€œpersonal\r\n  and advertising injuryâ€:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œPersonal\r\n  and advertising injuryâ€ means injury, including consequential â€œbodily injury,â€\r\n  arising out of one or more of the following offenses:\r\n\t. . . \r\n\tf.Â  The use of anotherâ€™s advertising idea in your\r\n  â€œadvertisementâ€; or\r\n\tg.Â  Infringing upon anotherâ€™s copyright, trade dress\r\n  or slogan in your â€œadvertisementâ€.[4]\r\n\r\nThe 2002 Penn\r\n  National CGL policy also included the following exclusion:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œPersonal\r\n  and advertising injuryâ€ arising out of the infringement of copyright, patent,\r\n  trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights.\r\n\tHowever,\r\n  this exclusion does not apply to infringement, in your â€œadvertisement,â€ of\r\n  copyright, trade dress or slogan.\r\n\r\nB.\r\nQuoting\r\n  portions of the above Penn National and Travelers policies, the federal court\r\n  certified the following questions in the indemnification action, which this\r\n  Court accepted:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n\t\t\tWhether an underlying suit premised upon trademark \r\n\t\t\tinfringement by the insured qualifies as injury arising out of the \r\n\t\t\toffense of â€œmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing \r\n\t\t\tbusiness?â€\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tWhether an underlying suit premised upon alleged \r\n\t\t\ttrademark infringement by the insured qualifies as injury arising \r\n\t\t\tout of the offense of â€œinfringement of copyright, title or slogan?â€\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.\r\n\t\t\tWhether an underlying suit premised upon trademark \r\n\t\t\tinfringement by the insured qualifies as injury arising out of the \r\n\t\t\toffense of â€œuse of anotherâ€™s advertising idea in your \r\n\t\t\tâ€˜advertisement?â€™â€&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4. \r\n\t\t\tWhether an underlying suit premised upon trademark \r\n\t\t\tinfringement by the insured qualifies as injury arising out of the \r\n\t\t\toffense of â€œinfringing [upon] anotherâ€™s copyright, trade dress or \r\n\t\t\tslogan in your â€˜advertisement?â€™â€[5]\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nII.\r\nAlthough the\r\n  federal district court quoted language from the Travelers and Penn National\r\n  policies in the certified questions posed to this Court, the federal court did\r\n  not seek our determination on the ultimate coverage questions, and we offer no\r\n  such opinion today.Â  Moreover, we neither reach the insurersâ€™ challenge to the\r\n  pleadings in the federal district court, nor do we reach the express exclusion\r\n  in Penn Nationalâ€™s 2002 policy.\r\nWe\r\n  now turn to the first two certified questions as they implicate Super Duperâ€™s policies\r\n  with Travelers.\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\tQuestion\r\n  1:Â  Whether an underlying suit premised upon trademark infringement by the\r\n  insured qualifies as injury arising out of the offense of â€œmisappropriation of\r\n  advertising ideas or style of doing business?â€\r\n\r\nIn State Auto Property &amp;

Travelers Indemnity Co. of America, 343 F.3d 249, 255-58 (4th Cir.\r\n  2003), the federal court of appeals interpreted the same contract language\r\n  applying North Carolina law.Â  We find the State Auto opinion\r\n  well-reasoned and sound, drawing on basic contract interpretation law to which South Carolina also adheres.[6]Â \r\n  Today, we adopt its analysis regarding whether trademark infringement constitutes\r\n  an advertising injury.\r\nState Auto began by recognizing the phrase â€œmisappropriation of advertising ideas or style\r\n  of doing businessâ€ presents two distinct questions: â€œ(1) whether\r\n  â€˜misappropriationâ€™ under the Travelers Policy is limited to common law\r\n  misappropriation, or whether it encompasses any claim related to the wrongful\r\n  use of a trademark; and (2) whether a trademark can constitute an advertising\r\n  idea or a style of doing business.â€Â  State Auto, 343 F.3d at 255.\r\nThe court in State Auto rejected Travelersâ€™\r\n  contention the undefined term misappropriation refers to the common law tort of\r\n  misappropriation[7] for a multitude of reasons: (1) North Carolinaâ€™s refusal to limit a similar\r\n  phrase, â€œunfair competition,â€ to its common law meaning when interpreting the\r\n  phrase in an insurance policy; (2) the majority of courts interpreting\r\n  â€œmisappropriationâ€ apply a general meaning, not the common law meaning; and (3)\r\n  an ambiguity must be resolved in the policyholderâ€™s favor.Â  343 F.3d at 255-57.\r\nWe too reject Travelersâ€™ contention the undefined term\r\n  misappropriation refers to the common law tort of misappropriation as the\r\n  insurance policy makes no such limitation and instead uses the general term\r\n  misappropriation, to which we apply its common meaning.Â  See Schulmeyer\r\n    v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134\r\n  (2003) (â€œWhen a contract is unambiguous a court must construe its provisions\r\n  according to the terms the parties used; understood in their plain, ordinary,\r\n  and popular sense.â€).Â  Generally, misappropriate is â€œto appropriate dishonestly\r\n  for oneâ€™s own use . . . [or] to appropriate wrongly or misapply in use.â€Â  Websterâ€™s Third New International Dictionary 1442 (2002).Â  Trademark infringement is squarely within this definition.\r\nEven\r\n  if we were to find uncertainty with the common understanding of the term\r\n  misappropriation, we would be left with an ambiguity and thus the same result. Â Ambiguous\r\n  terms must be construed in favor of the insured.Â  Greenville County v. Ins. Reserve Fund, 313 S.C. 546, 547-48, 443\r\n  S.E.2d 552, 553 (1994).Â  If Travelers intended to restrict its exposure solely\r\n  to the common law tort of misappropriation, then Travelers had both the means\r\n  and the responsibility to use restrictive language in the contract instead of\r\n  the general term â€œmisappropriation.â€\r\nNext, we turn to part two of question one: whether a\r\n  trademark can qualify as an advertising idea or a style of doing business.Â  State\r\n    Auto began its analysis by listing four functions a trademark serves:\r\n\r\n\t(1) it identifies and\r\n  distinguishes a sellerâ€™s goods; (2) it indicates that all goods bearing the\r\n  mark derive from the same source; (3) it signifies that all goods bearing the\r\n  mark are of the same quality; and (4) it serves as a prime instrument in the\r\n  advertisement and sale of the sellerâ€™s goods.\r\n\r\nState\r\n  Auto, 343 F.3d at 257-58 (citing 1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and\r\n  Unfair Competition Â§3:2 (4th ed. 2003)).Â  As a trademark is the prime\r\n  advertising instrument, we adopt State Autoâ€™s holding, â€œat the very least,\r\n  a trademark has the potential to be an advertising idea.â€Â  State Auto,\r\n  343 F.3d at 258.Â  As we do not reach the ultimate coverage issue, we end our\r\n  analysis here with our recognition a trademark has the potential to constitute\r\n  an advertising idea or a style of doing business.\r\nTherefore, we join the majority of courts finding\r\n  misappropriation may include trademark infringement.Â  See Cat Internet Servs., Inc. v.\r\n    Providence Washington Ins. Co., 333 F.3d 138, 142 (3rd Cir. 2003) (â€œWe\r\n  now hold that when a complaint alleges that an insured misappropriates and uses\r\n  trademarks or ideas in connection with marketing and sales and for the purpose\r\n  of gaining customers, the conduct constitutes â€˜misappropriation of an\r\n  advertising idea or style of doing businessâ€™ under Pennsylvania law.â€), Frog, Switch &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc. v.\r\n    Travelers Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 749 (3rd Cir. 1999) (â€œA trademark depends\r\n  for its effectiveness on communicating a message to consumers about the marked\r\n  good, which is the essence of advertising, and therefore allegations of\r\n  trademark infringement arguably allege misappropriation of an advertising\r\n  idea.â€), Adolfo House Distrib. Corp. v. Travelers Prop. &amp; Cas.\r\n    Ins. Co., 165 F.Supp.2d 1332, 1339 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (â€œThis court therefore concludes that allegations of trademark or trade\r\n  dress infringement meet the CGL â€˜advertising injuryâ€™ definition of â€˜advertising\r\n  injuryâ€™ under the definition sub-part for â€˜misappropriation of advertising\r\n  ideas or style of doing business.â€™â€). Â But see Advance Watch Co., Ltd. v. Kemper Nat.\r\n    Ins. Co.,\r\n    99 F.3d 795, 802 (6th Cir. 1996) (â€œ[T]his court concludes,\r\n  contrary to the district courtâ€™s conclusion, that â€˜misappropriation of\r\n  advertising ideas or style of doing businessâ€™ does not refer to a\r\n  category or grouping of actionable conduct which includes trademark or trade\r\n  dress infringement.â€).\r\nIn sum, we hold\r\n  misappropriation may encompass a claim related to the wrongful use of a\r\n  trademark, and a trademark may constitute an advertising idea or a style of\r\n  doing business.Â  Accordingly, to the first certified question, we answer yes.\r\nB.\r\n\r\n\tQuestion\r\n  2:Â  Whether an underlying suit premised upon alleged trademark infringement by\r\n  the insured qualifies as injury arising out of the offense of â€œinfringement of\r\n  copyright, title or slogan?â€\r\n\r\nThe 1999 and 2000 Travelers policies defined an\r\n  advertising injury as â€œ[i]nfringement of copyright, title or slogan.â€Â  The 2005\r\n  Travelers policy redefined â€œadvertising injuryâ€ as â€œ[i]nfringement of\r\n  copyright, title or slogan, provided that claim is made or â€˜suitâ€™ is brought by\r\n  a person or organization claiming ownership of such copyright, title or slogan.â€\r\nAgain, the policy\r\n  failed to define these terms, and we therefore must look to their common\r\n  meanings.Â  Super Duper conceded at oral argument it made no allegations pertaining\r\n  to copyright; thus, we shall examine the terms title and slogan.Â  A title is â€œa descriptive name.â€Â  Websterâ€™s Third New International Dictionary 2400 (2002).Â  A slogan is â€œa brief striking phrase used in advertising\r\n  or promotion.â€Â  Websterâ€™s Third New International Dictionary 2145 (2002).Â  Therefore, trademarks, titles,\r\n  and slogans are heavily related and can be synonymous.Â  Thus, coverage for\r\n  â€œinfringement of copyright, title or sloganâ€ may envelop trademark\r\n  infringement.Â  See Union Ins.\r\n    Co. v. Knife Co., Inc., 897 F. Supp. 1213,\r\n  1217 (W.D. Ark. 1995) (holding trademark infringement can be described\r\n  as infringement of a title or slogan as â€œboth titles and slogans . . . can\r\n  undoubtedly be protected as trademarksâ€).Â  Accordingly, we answer the second\r\n  certified question yes.\r\nIII.\r\nNow, we reach Penn\r\n  Nationalâ€™s policies, as certified questions three and four solely implicate\r\n  this insurer.Â  The quoted language in certified questions three and four appears\r\n  in Penn Nationalâ€™s 2001 and 2002 CGL policies, which state:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œPersonal\r\n  and advertising injuryâ€ means injury, including consequential â€œbodily injuryâ€,\r\n  arising out of one or more of the following offenses:\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tf.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of anotherâ€™s advertising\r\n  idea in your â€œadvertisementâ€; or\r\n\tg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infringing upon anotherâ€™s\r\n  copyright, trade dress or slogan in your â€œadvertisementâ€.\r\n\r\nThe Penn National policies\r\n  defined â€œadvertisementâ€ as, â€œa notice that is broadcast or published to the\r\n  general public or specific market segments about your goods, products or\r\n  services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.â€Â  The Travelers\r\n  policies include no such definition of â€œadvertisement.â€\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\tQuestion\r\n  3:Â  Whether an underlying suit premised upon trademark infringement by the\r\n  insured qualifies as injury arising out of the offense of â€œuse of anotherâ€™s\r\n  advertising idea in your â€˜advertisement?â€™â€\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  third certified question asks whether trademark infringement may occur when\r\n  anotherâ€™s advertising idea is used.Â  â€œAn â€˜advertising\r\n  ideaâ€™ is an â€˜idea for calling public attention to a product or business,\r\n  especially by proclaiming desirable qualities so as to increase sales or\r\n  patronage.â€™â€Â  Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Cloud Nine, LLC, 464 F.Supp.2d\r\n    1161, 1166 (D. Utah 2006) (quoting Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Badger Med.\r\n      Supply Co., 528 N.W.2d 486, 490 (Wis. Ct. App. 1995)).Â  As discussed supra,\r\n  there is a close link between advertising and trademarks.Â  This connection\r\n  exists under Penn Nationalâ€™s definition of an advertisement as â€œnotice\r\n  that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market\r\n  segments about your goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting\r\n  customers or supporters.â€Â  A trademark is â€œany â€˜word, name, symbol, or deviceâ€™\r\n  used by a manufacturer or merchant â€˜to identify his goods and distinguish them\r\n  from those manufactured by others.â€™â€Â  1 J. Thomas\r\n  McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition Â§3:4 (4th ed.\r\n  2009) (quoting Lanham Act Â§45, 15 U.S.C.A. Â§1127 (Supp. 2009)).\r\nThus, the use of anotherâ€™s advertising idea may include trademark\r\n  infringement because to infringe upon someoneâ€™s\r\n  trademark, which is an advertising device, one improperly uses anotherâ€™s\r\n  advertising idea to draw the consumerâ€™s attention to a product.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we answer the third certified question, yes.\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\n\tQuestion\r\n  4:Â  Whether an underlying suit premised upon trademark infringement by the\r\n  insured qualifies as injury arising out of the offense of â€œinfringing [upon]\r\n  anotherâ€™s copyright, trade dress or slogan in your â€˜advertisement?â€™â€\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  the fourth certified question, this Court must determine whether trademark\r\n  infringement occurs when a party improperly uses anotherâ€™s copyright, trade\r\n  dress or slogan in their advertisement.Â  Again, the definition of copyright is\r\n  not pertinent to this case, so we turn to trade dress and slogan.Â  As discussed supra, a slogan is\r\n  â€œa brief striking phrase used in advertising or promotion.â€Â  Websterâ€™s Third New International Dictionary 2145 (2002).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we hold a trademark may be a productâ€™s slogan.Â  Therefore, trademark\r\n  infringement potentially relates to the improper use of anotherâ€™s slogan.\r\nTrade dress is a more amorphous concept.Â \r\n  Historically trade dress included a productâ€™s labels and containers; now trade\r\n  dress refers to the productâ€™s packaging, the productâ€™s shape and design, and\r\n  the totality of elements creating the productâ€™s overall image.Â  1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks\r\n  and Unfair Competition Â§8.4 (4th ed.\r\n  2009).Â  Further, McCarthy stated, â€œthe history of American law throughout much\r\n  of the Twentieth Century is the gradual disappearance of distinctions between\r\n  the law of â€˜trade dressâ€™ and that of â€˜trademarks.â€™â€Â  1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks\r\n  and Unfair Competition Â§8.1 (4th ed. 2009).Â  Therefore, a trademark may\r\n  serve as an element to the overall trade dress of a product.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we answer the fourth certified question yes, as trademark infringement may\r\n  occur when a party infringes upon anotherâ€™s trade dress or slogan in its advertisement.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nIn answering these\r\n  certified questions, we make no judgments regarding the overall coverage issues\r\n  in this case.Â  We answer the certified questions narrowly and conclude, based\r\n  on the policies presented, trademark infringement has the potential to\r\n  constitute an advertising injury.Â  This potential is all we find today.Â  We\r\n  recognize this case requires more analysis, procedurally and substantively, to resolve\r\n  the partiesâ€™ disputes.\r\nCERTIFIED\r\n  QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; This\r\n  policy definition is the verbatim language provided by the Insurance Services\r\n  Office (ISO) for commercial general liability (CGL) policies in 1986.Â  6 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks &amp;\r\n  Unfair Competition Â§33:5 (4th ed. 2009).\r\n[2]&nbsp; Travelers\r\n  apparently did not insure Super Duper in the interim between the 2000 and 2005\r\n  policies.Â  Travelers used a CGL policy during this non-coverage time which\r\n  included an exclusion stating:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œPersonal and advertising injuryâ€\r\n  arising out of the infringement of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret\r\n  or other intellectual property rights.\r\n\tHowever this exclusion does not\r\n  apply to infringement, in your â€œadvertisementâ€, of copyright, trade dress or\r\n  slogan.\r\n\r\nAs Travelers conceded at oral argument, this exclusion\r\n  has no application in the case at hand as the 2005 CGL policy deleted this\r\n  exclusion in its entirety.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The\r\n  â€œadvertisementâ€ definition follows the 1998 standard language by ISO for CGL\r\n  policies.Â  6 J. Thomas McCarthy,\r\n  McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition Â§33:5 (4th ed. 2009).Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; Other\r\n  items in the definition differed slightly among the two policies, but\r\n  subsections f and g are identical.Â  These subsections are also identical to language\r\n  provided by the ISO for CGL policies in 1998.Â \r\n  6 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition Â§33:5 (4th ed. 2009).\r\n[5]&nbsp; We\r\n  note the second certified question uses the term â€œalleged trademark\r\n  infringement.â€Â  The remaining three questions make no such qualification.\r\n[6]&nbsp; Compare Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Rollison, 378 S.C. 600, 606, 663 S.E.2d 484, 487\r\n  (2008) (â€œAn insurance policy is a contract between the insured and the\r\n  insurance company, and the terms of the policy are to be construed according to\r\n  contract law.â€), and Superior Auto.

got letter yesterday stating blood tested\r\n  [positive for] HIV.â€Â  The handwritten chart note identified Mitchell correctly\r\n  as eighteen years old, but was erroneously dated May 14, 2001.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Chandler referred Mitchell to Dr. Kevin Shea, an infectious disease specialist\r\n  with Carolina Health Care (â€œCarolinaâ€).Â  On May 23, 2002, Dr. Shea met with\r\n  Mitchell and recorded Mitchellâ€™s medical history as follows:\r\n\r\n\tMr.\r\n  Mitchell is an 18 year old African-American male with no past medical history\r\n  who apparently tried to donate blood in April of this year.Â  He was noted to be\r\n  HIV positive.Â  Subsequent confirmation through Dr. Chandlerâ€™s office included a\r\n  positive ELISA and Western Blot.Â  He is referred at this time for further\r\n  evaluation.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFortis soon\r\n  received claims for Mitchellâ€™s treatment and for the blood testing that\r\n  indicated Mitchell was HIV positive.Â  Pursuant to company policy in cases\r\n  involving long-term disease, Fortis launched an investigation to determine\r\n  whether Mitchell had failed to disclose a pre-existing condition on his policy\r\n  application.\r\nIn June 2002, a\r\n  Fortis investigator contacted Mitchell to request that he identify his\r\n  healthcare providers and authorize a medical records release.Â  Mitchell did so,\r\n  and Fortis contacted Carolina and Dr. Shea to obtain Mitchellâ€™s medical records\r\n  and billing information.Â  Carolina sent Fortis copies of Dr. Chandlerâ€™s\r\n  records, Dr. Sheaâ€™s records, and Mitchellâ€™s blood test results.Â  \r\nA Fortis\r\n  investigator reviewed the records and discovered the erroneously-dated intake note\r\n  in Dr. Chandlerâ€™s files.Â  That information was then forwarded to Fortis Senior\r\n  Underwriter Kate Stephens (â€œStephensâ€) for review.Â  Stephens completed a\r\n  â€œreferral summaryâ€ for the rescission committee and recommended that Mitchellâ€™s\r\n  policy be rescinded on the grounds that he had misrepresented his HIV positive\r\n  status.Â  Stephensâ€™s summary referenced the handwritten notation on the intake\r\n  form as the sole foundation for her recommendation.Â  Some time shortly\r\n  thereafter, a Fortis employee - in all likelihood Stephens[1] - drafted an addendum to the referral summary, which read:\r\n\r\n\tThe only\r\n  question misrepresented on the Enrollment form is #20 - â€œWithin the last 10\r\n  years has any proposed insured been diagnosed as having or been treated for any\r\n  immune deficiency disorder.â€Â  Canâ€™t use the question re: AIDS as he does not\r\n  have AIDS, he has tested positive for the HIV virus.Â  This is the only question\r\n  Iâ€™ve found that we can use - any other suggestions?\r\n\tTechnically,\r\n  we do not have the results of the HIV test.Â  This is the only entry in the\r\n  medical records regarding HIV status.Â  Is this sufficient?\r\n\r\nThe referral\r\n  summary and addendum were sent to Fortisâ€™s rescission committee (â€œthe\r\n  committeeâ€).Â  On September 4, 2002, the committee conducted an approximately\r\n  two-hour meeting, in which they considered forty-six cases, including\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s.Â  When it came time to consider Mitchellâ€™s case, the committee\r\n  considered Stephensâ€™ referral summary and the addendum.Â  The committee voted to\r\n  rescind Mitchellâ€™s policy.Â  \r\nOn September 5,\r\n  2002, Fortis sent Mitchell a letter informing him that his health insurance\r\n  policy was rescinded due to a material misrepresentation on his application\r\n  form.Â  The letter stated that Fortis would â€œwelcome any additional information\r\n  you may have which would effect [sic] our decision to rescind your policy.â€Â \r\n  Upon receiving the letter, Mitchell attempted to contact Stephens in order to\r\n  inform her that he had not misrepresented his health status.Â  Mitchell was\r\n  directed to a customer service representative, who informed him that there was\r\n  â€œnothing [the representative] could doâ€ about the rescission.Â  \r\nMitchell then\r\n  sought the help of a case manager at the Hope Health free medical clinic.Â  The manager\r\n  called Stephens to inform her that she had medical records confirming that\r\n  Mitchell first tested for HIV positive after he had purchased the Fortis\r\n  policy.Â  The manager offered to send these records to Stephens by fax or mail.Â \r\n  Stephens spurned this offer and informed the manager â€œthat there was nothing\r\n  she could do at this time.â€[2]Â \r\n  Stephens did not provide any information regarding Mitchellâ€™s right to an\r\n  appeal.Â  \r\nOn June 4, 2003,\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s attorney sent Fortis a copy of Dr. Chandlerâ€™s initial test results\r\n  along with a letter informing Fortis that Mitchell was first diagnosed with HIV\r\n  in May 2002.Â  One week later, Fortis advised Mitchellâ€™s attorney that it would\r\n  review his appeal.Â  The rescission committee met to consider Mitchellâ€™s\r\n  appeal.Â  The information before the committee consisted of a single notation that\r\n  read: â€œletter from attorney stating that the insured did not misrep[resent]\r\n  coverage since the first diagnosis of AIDS was 5/14/2002.â€[3]Â \r\n  The committee denied Mitchellâ€™s appeal and upheld the rescission.[4]Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nProcedural Background\r\nOn July 21, 2003, Mitchell\r\n  filed this action for breach of contract and bad faith rescission of his health\r\n  insurance, seeking actual and punitive damages.Â  \r\nAt trial, Mitchellâ€™s insurance expert testified that it was Fortisâ€™s\r\n  practice to shut down an investigation once a single piece of evidence was\r\n  discovered that would support rescission.Â  Further, Mitchell introduced\r\n  testimony from Fortisâ€™s manager of\r\n  underwriting and correspondence - Stephensâ€™s direct supervisor - who testified\r\n  that she was â€œnot able to answerâ€ whether she or any of her employees â€œhad a\r\n  responsibility to find out the truthâ€ about a policyholderâ€™s medical\r\n  conditions.Â  On cross-examination,\r\n  Fortisâ€™s insurance expert conceded\r\n  that an insurance company has a duty to investigate and find information that\r\n  may lead to payment of a claim.\r\nIn light of this\r\n  testimony, Mitchell argued that Fortis acted in bad faith in rescinding his\r\n  policy solely on the basis of the handwritten note from Dr. Chandlerâ€™s files.Â \r\n  Mitchell argued that there was ample countervailing evidence in his medical\r\n  records to put any reviewer on notice that the handwritten note was erroneously\r\n  dated.[5]Â \r\n  Mitchell contended that the rescission committee, presented with the\r\n  â€œaddendum,â€ which openly acknowledged that the investigation had uncovered no\r\n  clear evidence that Mitchell was HIV positive prior to the inception of his\r\n  contract with Fortis, rescinded Mitchellâ€™s policy in the course of what was\r\n  likely no more than a three-minute review.[6]Â  \r\nMitchell also\r\n  argued that Fortis had tried to conceal evidence of its bad faith and that\r\n  Fortis had twice sent them an illegible copy of the addendum to the referral\r\n  form, and that Stephensâ€™s call log included no entry for her phone call with\r\n  the Hope Health case manager.Â  Mitchell questioned Fortisâ€™s practice of not\r\n  maintaining records of its referral forms in the same manner as other company\r\n  documents.\r\nAs to Mitchellâ€™s\r\n  actual and potential harm and the determination of damages, Mitchell presented\r\n  testimony from a medical expert who testified that without medical treatment,\r\n  he would contract AIDS in two years and likely die two years after that.Â \r\n  Mitchell introduced testimony from a health care expert who testified to the\r\n  minimum expected costs that it would take to care for Mitchell throughout his\r\n  life, not including complications from HIV and AIDS.Â  Mitchell also introduced\r\n  an economist who relied on the health care expertâ€™s figures to project a total\r\n  present value of $1,081,189.40 for Mitchellâ€™s treatment and costs.Â  \r\nThe jury awarded\r\n  Mitchell $186,000 in compensatory damages, including $36,000 on the breach of\r\n  contract claim and $150,000 on the bad faith rescission claim.Â  The jury also\r\n  awarded $15 million in punitive damages for the bad faith rescission claim.Â  \r\nFortis filed\r\n  post-trial motions to (1) elect remedies; (2) vacate, or in the alternative,\r\n  remit the punitive damages award; and (3) for judgment notwithstanding the\r\n  verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial absolute, or in the alternative, a\r\n  new trial nisi remittitur.Â  The circuit court granted the motion to\r\n  elect, and Mitchell elected actual and punitive damages on the bad faith cause\r\n  of action.Â  Following a hearing, the circuit court denied Fortisâ€™s remaining\r\n  motions.Â  \r\nFortis appealed and\r\n  we certified the case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCRAP.Â  Fortis now submits the\r\n  following questions for our review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the $15 million punitive damages verdict \r\n\t\t\tviolate Fortisâ€™s constitutional right to due process?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court admit improper evidence at \r\n\t\t\ttrial?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in denying Fortisâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tWas the juryâ€™s verdict a result of passion, \r\n\t\t\tcaprice, or prejudice?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of review\r\nAs a\r\n  preliminary matter, we restate the standard of review appellate courts should apply\r\n  to a trial courtâ€™s post judgment due process review of a punitive damages\r\n  award.Â  We have typically applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing\r\n  a trial courtâ€™s post judgment review of a punitive damages award.Â  See\r\n    Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 112, 406 S.E.2d 350, 355 (1991) (â€œ[O]nly\r\n  when the trial courtâ€™s discretion is abused, amounting to an error of law, does\r\n  it become the duty of this Court to set aside the award.â€); Hundley v. Rite\r\n    Aid of South Carolina, Inc., 339 S.C. 285, 314, 529 S.E.2d 45, 61 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000) (evaluating the trial courtâ€™s post-judgment review and finding â€œno abuse\r\n  of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s conclusions following its review of the jury\r\n  verdict.â€).Â  However, changes in the federal case law have persuaded us to\r\n  adopt a de novo standard for the review of trial court determinations of the\r\n  constitutionality of punitive damages awards.Â  Â Â \r\nIn Cooper\r\n  Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424 (2001), the United\r\n  States Supreme Court held that courts of appeal should apply a de novo standard\r\n  of review to district court determinations of the constitutionality of punitive\r\n  damages awards.Â  The Supreme Court identified three bases for its promulgation\r\n  of a de novo review standard.Â  First, the concepts involved in the due process\r\n  analysis of punitive damages awards are â€œfluid concepts that take their\r\n  substantive content from the particular contexts in which the standards are\r\n  being assessed.â€Â  Cooper Industries, 532 U.S. at 436 (quoting Ornelas\r\n    v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696 (1996)).Â  Second, the due process\r\n  criteria acquire content only through application, and â€œindependent review is\r\n  therefore necessary if appellate courts are to maintain control of, and\r\n  clarify, the legal principles.â€Â  Id. (quoting Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 697).Â  Third, â€œde novo review tends to â€˜unify precedentâ€™ and â€˜stabilize the law.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  (quoting Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 697-98). Â We agree with this\r\n  analysis.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  the reasons articulated in Cooper Industries, we find that determinations\r\n  of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards are best conducted pursuant\r\n  to a de novo review.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we hold that our appellate courts must conduct a de novo review when evaluating\r\n  the constitutionality of a punitive damages award.Â  Cooper Industries,\r\n  532 at 431. Â \r\nLaw/Analysis \r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Due\r\n  Process and Punitive Damages\r\nFortis argues that\r\n  the $15 million punitive damages award is so excessive as to violate its\r\n  constitutional right to due process under the standards set forth in Gamble\r\n    v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991) (hereinafter â€œGambleâ€),\r\n  and BMW of North America v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996) (hereinafter â€œGoreâ€).Â \r\n  We agree with this conclusion, although our analysis differs substantially from\r\n  that urged by Fortis.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nA.Â  The History of\r\n  Due Process Limitations on \r\nPunitive Damages\r\n  Awards\r\nThe\r\n  practice of awarding punitive damages originated in principles of common law\r\n  â€œto deter the wrongdoer and others from committing like offenses in the\r\n  future.â€Â  Laird v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 388, 393, 134 S.E.2d\r\n  206, 210 (1964).Â  â€œPunitive damages may properly be imposed to further a\r\n  stateâ€™s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its\r\n  repetition.â€Â  Gore, 517 U.S. at 568.Â  The stateâ€™s interests in awarding\r\n  punitive damages must remain consistent with the principle of penal theory that\r\n  â€œthe punishment should fit the crime.â€Â  Atkinson v. Orkin Exterminating Co.,\r\n    Inc., 361 S.C. 156, 164, 604 S.E.2d 385, 389 (2004) (quoting Mathias v.\r\n      Accor Economy Lodging Inc. and Motel 6 Operating L.P., 347 F.3d 672, 676\r\n  (7th Cir. 2003)).Â  \r\nNevertheless,\r\n  â€œwhile states possess discretion over the imposition of punitive damages, it is\r\n  well established that there are procedural and substantive constitutional\r\n  limitations on these awards.â€Â  State Farm v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 416 (2003).Â  â€œTo the extent an award is grossly excessive, it furthers no\r\n  legitimate purpose and constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of property.â€Â  Id. at 417.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1 (1991), the United\r\n  States Supreme Court had never directly considered the matter of whether a\r\n  punitive damage award could be so excessive as to violate due process.Â  In Haslip,\r\n  the Court held that a punitive damages award more than four times the amount of\r\n  compensatory damages did not violate the defendantâ€™s due process rights.Â \r\n  However, the Court acknowledged that unlimited discretion in the fixing of\r\n  punitive damages may invite extreme results that violate due process.Â  The\r\n  Court noted that â€œgeneral concerns of reasonableness and adequate guidance from\r\n  the court when the case is tried to a jury properly enter into the\r\n  constitutional calculus.â€Â  Id. at 18.Â  Since Haslip, the Court\r\n  has built a healthy body of jurisprudence that adds substance and context to\r\n  this area of law.Â  See TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources, 509\r\n  U.S. 443 (1993) (holding that the harm likely to occur from a defendantâ€™s\r\n  conduct was relevant to the due process inquiry); Honda Motor Co., Ltd. v.\r\n    Oberg, 512 U.S. 415 (1994) (holding that due process requires post-judgment\r\n  review of a punitive damages award); Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (identifying\r\n  three â€œguidepostsâ€ that assist a due process analysis); Cooper Industries v.\r\n    Leatherman Tool Grp., Inc., 532 U.S. 424 (2001) (adopting a de novo\r\n  standard of review for determining the constitutionality of punitive damages\r\n  awards); Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (identifying evidence that, if used to\r\n  support a punitive damages award, will violate due process); Phillip Morris\r\n    USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346 (2007) (holding that a punitive damages award\r\n  that is based on harm to others violates due process).Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court expounded upon Haslipâ€™s due process standard in Gore,\r\n  where it held that â€œ[e]lementary notions of fairness enshrined in our\r\n  constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only\r\n  of the conduct that will subject him to punishment, but also of the severity of\r\n  the penalty that a state may impose.â€Â  Gore, 517 U.S. at 575.Â  In Gore, the Court first adopted a specific test by which to conduct a\r\n  due process analysis. Â The Court established three guideposts that indicate\r\n  whether the due process requirement of fair notice has been met. In determining\r\n  the constitutionality of a punitive damages award, Gore directed that courts\r\n  consider: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendantâ€™s conduct; (2)\r\n  the disparity between the actual and potential harm suffered by the plaintiff\r\n  and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive\r\n  damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in\r\n  comparable cases.Â  Id. at 575.Â  \r\nSince Gore, much of the Supreme Courtâ€™s punitive damages jurisprudence has\r\n  focused on the type of evidence that may be used to support a punitive damages\r\n  award.Â  In Campbell, the Supreme Court held that punitive damages awards\r\n  may not be based on out-of-state conduct and must be related to the plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  injury or damage.Â  â€œA State cannot punish a defendant for conduct that may have\r\n  been lawful where it occurred. . . .Â  Nor, as a general rule, does a State have\r\n  a legitimate concern in imposing punitive damages to punish a defendant for\r\n  unlawful acts committed outside of the Stateâ€™s jurisdiction.â€Â  Campbell,\r\n  538 U.S. at 421-22.Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a] defendant should be punished for the\r\n  conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or\r\n  business.â€Â  Id. at 423.Â  \r\nSimilarly,\r\n  in Phillip Morris USA v. Williams, 549 U.S. 346 (2007), the Court held that\r\n  a punitive damages award that is based on evidence of harm to persons other\r\n  than the plaintiff or plaintiffs will violate due process.Â  The Court noted\r\n  that harm to others may be considered to help show that the conduct that caused\r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s harm also posed a risk to the public, but the jury may not go\r\n  further and base a punitive damages award on that evidence.Â  \r\nIn these\r\n  cases, the Supreme Court has continued to uphold Haslip and further\r\n  delineate the contours of punitive damages awards that â€œrun wild.â€Â  Haslip,\r\n  499 U.S. at 19.Â  Nevertheless, the Court has consistently declined to â€œdraw a\r\n  mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the\r\n  constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case.â€Â  Id. at\r\n  18.Â  \r\nB.Â  Gamble and\r\n  Punitive Damages Review \r\nUnder South Carolina Law\r\nOur\r\n  own jurisprudence has largely tracked the Supreme Courtâ€™s constitutional\r\n  pronouncements, beginning with our Gamble opinion, which was written in\r\n  response to Haslip.Â  In Gamble, we identified eight\r\n  considerations that trial courts should apply in conducting a post-judgment due\r\n  process review of any punitive damages award.Â  These considerations are: (1)\r\n  the defendantâ€™s degree of culpability; (2) the duration of the conduct; (3) the\r\n  defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment; (4) the existence of similar past\r\n  conduct; (5) the likelihood the award will deter the defendant or others from\r\n  like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to\r\n  result from such conduct; (7) the defendantâ€™s ability to pay; and (8) any other\r\n  factors deemed appropriate.Â  Gamble, 302 S.C. at 111-12, 406 S.E.2d at\r\n  354. \r\nWe\r\n  have said in the past that trial courts must consider both the Gamble and the Gore factors.Â  James v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 371 S.C.\r\n  187, 195, 638 S.E.2d 667, 671 (2006) (â€œAlthough we find the punitive damages\r\n  award was reasonable under the Gamble factors, we must also review the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling on punitive damages under Gore.â€).Â  However, considerations\r\n  of judicial economy weigh in favor of a less burdensome and duplicative\r\n  analysis.Â  We now hold that Gamble remains relevant to the post-judgment\r\n  due process analysis, but only insofar as it adds substance to the Gore guideposts.Â  With these considerations in mind, we articulate the following\r\n  test for our courts in conducting a post-judgment review of punitive damages\r\n  awards.\r\n1.Â  Reprehensibility\r\nFirst,\r\n  any court reviewing a punitive damages award should consider the degree of\r\n  reprehensibility of the defendantâ€™s conduct.Â  Reprehensibility is â€œperhaps the most important\r\n  indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.â€Â  Gore, 517 U.S. at 565. Â â€œThis\r\n  principle reflects the view that some wrongs are more blameworthy than\r\n  others.â€Â  Id.Â  In considering reprehensibility, a court should consider\r\n  whether: (i) the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; (ii) the\r\n  tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard for the\r\n  health or safety of others; (iii) the target of the conduct had financial\r\n  vulnerability; (iv) the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated\r\n  incident; and (v) the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or\r\n  deceit, rather than mere accident.[7]Â  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 419.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n2.Â  Ratio\r\nSecond,\r\n  the court should consider the disparity between the actual or potential harm\r\n  suffered by the plaintiff and the amount of the punitive damages award.Â  The\r\n  ratio of actual or potential harm to the punitive damages award is â€œperhaps the\r\n  most commonly cited indicium of an unreasonable or excessive punitive damages\r\n  award.â€Â  Gore, 517 U.S. at 580.Â  Although the Supreme Court has â€œbeen\r\n  reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm,\r\n  or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award,â€ and has\r\n  consistently declined to adopt a bright line ratio or simple mathematical test,\r\n  the Court has remarked that â€œin practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit\r\n  ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will\r\n  satisfy due process.â€Â  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 425.Â  Nevertheless, the Supreme\r\n  Court has made clear that â€œthere are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive\r\n  damages award may not surpass,â€ so long as â€œthe measurement of punishment is\r\n  both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and\r\n  the general damages recovered.â€Â  Id. at 425-26.Â  With this instruction\r\n  in mind, we note that a court, when determining the reasonableness of a\r\n  particular ratio of actual or potential harm to a punitive damages award, may\r\n  consider: the likelihood that the award will deter the defendant from like\r\n  conduct; whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result\r\n  from such conduct; and the defendantâ€™s ability to pay.[8]Â  Nevertheless, a court may not rely upon these considerations to\r\n  justify an otherwise excessive punitive damages award.\r\n\r\n3.Â  Comparative Penalty Awards\r\nThird,\r\n  the court should consider the difference between the punitive damages awarded\r\n  by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.Â \r\n  When identifying â€œcomparable casesâ€ a court may consider: the type of harm\r\n  suffered by the plaintiff or plaintiffs; the reprehensibility of the\r\n  defendantâ€™s conduct; the ratio of actual or potential harm to the punitive\r\n  damages award; the size of the award; and any other factors the court may deem\r\n  relevant.Â  \r\nPost-Judgment Due\r\n  Process Review\r\nIn the Instant Case\r\n1.Â  Reprehensibility\r\nTurning\r\n  to the facts of the instant case, we find ample support in the record to\r\n  establish that Fortisâ€™s conduct was reprehensible. Â \r\nFirst,\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s harm was economic,\r\n  rather than physical.Â  This would typically weigh against the reprehensibility\r\n  of Fortisâ€™s conduct.Â  However, this case is unique in that Mitchellâ€™s economic harm\r\n  - the termination of his health insurance policy - exposed him to great risk of\r\n  physical danger.Â  \r\nSecond,\r\n  this truth is also relevant to the consideration of whether Fortis demonstrated\r\n  an indifference to Mitchellâ€™s life and a reckless disregard to his health and\r\n  safety.Â  We conclude that Fortis did.Â  The record is clear that a person with HIV, without proper medication, will\r\n  develop AIDS and die within a relatively short time.Â  But for the free medical\r\n  services provided by Hope Health, Fortisâ€™s conduct would have deprived Mitchell\r\n  of health insurance for at least three years, during which time his health\r\n  would have surely deteriorated.Â  The jury could have reasonably inferred from\r\n  the evidence that Fortis deliberately ignored contextual and other evidence in\r\n  order to rescind Mitchellâ€™s policy on the pretext of a misrepresentation.Â  It\r\n  was reasonable to conclude, from the evidence presented, that Fortis was\r\n  motivated to avoid the losses it would undoubtedly incur in supporting\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s costly medical condition.Â  Based upon this evidence, we find that\r\n  Fortis was deliberately indifferent to its contractual obligations and to\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s health and wellbeing.Â Â  \r\nThird, Mitchell was financially\r\n  vulnerable.Â  Again, without the assistance of free medical services, Fortisâ€™s\r\n  actions would have rendered him unable to obtain additional insurance.Â  \r\nFourth,\r\n  Fortisâ€™s conduct involved repeated acts of deliberate indifference for more\r\n  than two years. Â Fortis reinstated Mitchellâ€™s policy nearly twenty months after\r\n  it had been put on notice that the evidence upon which it relied was\r\n  erroneous.Â  The rescission committee decided to reject Mitchellâ€™s appeal even\r\n  after his attorney contacted Fortis to emphasize the significance of the\r\n  medical records which demonstrated that Mitchell had not misrepresented his\r\n  condition at the time he applied for the policy.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  there is ample evidence in the record to support a finding that the harm\r\n  Mitchell suffered was a result of intentional deceit.Â  Stephensâ€™ addendum\r\n  acknowledged that the investigation yielded no clear evidence to establish that\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s HIV positive status predated his policy with Fortis.Â  The rescission\r\n  committee, when presented with this information, elected to rescind Mitchellâ€™s\r\n  policy.Â  After the initial rescission, Stephens was contacted by Mitchell,\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s Hope Health case worker, Mitchellâ€™s motherâ€™s insurance agent, and\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s attorney to inform her that her information was inaccurate.Â \r\n  Stephens did not appear at trial, and the jury was justified in drawing a\r\n  negative inference from her unavailability.Â  \r\nFortisâ€™s\r\n  refusal to conduct a further investigation suggests that it was aware of its\r\n  own wrongdoing. Furthermore, the lack of written rescission policies, the lack\r\n  of information available regarding appeal rights or procedures, the separate\r\n  retention policies for rescission documents, the omission of the case managerâ€™s\r\n  call from Stephensâ€™ phone log, and the inference evident from the record that\r\n  Fortis was in possession of Dr. Sheaâ€™s records as early as the summer of 2002,\r\n  were all evidence that Fortis tried to conceal the actions it took in\r\n  rescinding Mitchellâ€™s policy. \r\nBased\r\n  on these findings, we conclude that Fortisâ€™s conduct was highly reprehensible\r\n  and that the imposition of punitive damages was appropriate.Â  \r\n2.Â  Ratio\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the ratio guidepost, a court need not always compare the punitive\r\n  damages award to the actual damages awarded, but in certain cases may compare\r\n  it to the potential harm suffered by the plaintiff.Â  The Supreme Court\r\n  squarely addressed this issue in TXO, where the petitioner had brought a\r\n  frivolous claim against the respondentâ€™s oil and gas rights in an effort to\r\n  renegotiate its royalty arrangement with the respondent.Â  509 U.S. 443.Â  The jury in that case awarded $19,000 in actual damages and $10 million in punitive\r\n  damages.Â  The petitioner argued on appeal that the 526 to 1 ratio was grossly\r\n  excessive, but the Supreme Court found that there was ample evidence in the\r\n  record to support an inference that petitioner was seeking a multimillion\r\n  dollar reduction in its potential royalty obligation.Â  The Supreme Court held\r\n  that â€œit is appropriate to consider the magnitude of the potential harm that\r\n  the defendantâ€™s conduct would have caused to its intended victim if the\r\n  wrongful plan had succeeded, as well as the possible harm to other victims that\r\n  might have resulted if similar future behavior were not deterred.â€Â  Id. at 460.Â  Although the Court did not designate a monetary value to the potential\r\n  harm suffered by the respondent, it found that even the most conservative\r\n  approximations - each falling within a single-digit ratio to the $10 million\r\n  punitive damages award - did not â€œjar oneâ€™s constitutional sensibilities.â€Â  Id. at 462.Â  \r\nTurning\r\n  once again to the present case, there is ample evidence that Fortisâ€™s conduct\r\n  would have potentially resulted in a great deal of harm to Mitchell if not for\r\n  the free medical services of Hope Health.Â  In reviewing the ratio guidepost,\r\n  the circuit court found that because Mitchellâ€™s lifetime maximum payout on the\r\n  rescinded health insurance policy was $6 million, â€œthe potential economic loss\r\n  to [Mitchell] from the wrongful rescission was thusâ€ at least that amount.Â \r\n  However, in this de novo review, we need not - and in this case should not -\r\n  accept the circuit courtâ€™s assertion that Mitchell suffered $6 million in\r\n  potential harm.Â  This figure is unsupported by the evidence and too\r\n  speculative.Â  Rather, the more appropriate measure of potential harm, supported\r\n  by the evidence, is the present value of cost for the minimal evaluation and\r\n  treatment of HIV over Mitchellâ€™s lifetime - $1,081,189.40.Â  This figure bears a\r\n  closer relation to Mitchellâ€™s potential risk than the $6 million maximum\r\n  lifetime payout.Â  It also bears a closer relation to the reprehensibility of\r\n  Fortisâ€™s conduct because this figure represents the minimal pecuniary gain to\r\n  Fortis in rescinding the policy.Â  For these reasons, $1,081,189.40 is the\r\n  accurate measure of the potential harm to which Fortis exposed Mitchell and is\r\n  appropriately considered in evaluating the ratio to the punitive damages\r\n  award.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  next question we must ask is whether a ratio of 13.9 to 1, based upon the $15\r\n  million punitive damages award and $1,081,189.40 in potential harm, is grossly\r\n  excessive.Â  We conclude that it is.Â  \r\nIn Campbell , the Supreme Court observed that â€œwhen compensatory damages are\r\n  substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages,\r\n  can reach the outer limits of the due process guarantee.â€Â  538 U.S. at 425.Â  Although the determination of whether a compensatory damage award is\r\n  â€œsubstantialâ€ is necessarily an imprecise and relative inquiry, it is safe to\r\n  say that Mitchellâ€™s $150,000 in actual damages - excluding, for the moment, the\r\n  $1,081,189.40 in potential harm suffered - is a fairly substantial compensatory\r\n  damage award in South Carolina.\r\nWith\r\n  that in mind, we find that a 13.9 to 1 ratio, in this particular case, exceeds\r\n  due process limits.Â  There is ample evidence in the record to support the\r\n  imposition of punitive damages, and there is no need for further findings of\r\n  fact.Â  However, in order to determine the proper amount to remit, we must turn\r\n  to the third Gore guidepost, which instructs us to compare the present\r\n  award to civil penalties imposed in similar cases.Â  \r\n3.Â  Comparative\r\n  Penalty Awards\r\nAlthough a thorough review of case law has uncovered no cases on\r\n  all fours factually with the present case, South Carolina has a substantial, if\r\n  somewhat dated, history of upholding punitive damages awards against insurance\r\n  companies that fraudulently rescind their customersâ€™ health insurance\r\n  policies.Â  See Kinard v.\r\n    United Ins. Co., 237 S.C. 266, 116\r\n  S.E.2d 906 (1960) (where the jury awarded $200 in actual damages and $1,300\r\n  punitive damages against an insurer who stopped collecting the premiums from\r\n  the insured, with knowledge from the claims filed and from the agentâ€™s observation\r\n  that the insured was near death, so that the policy would lapse); Yarborough\r\n    v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co., 225 S.C. 236, 81 S.E.2d 359 (1954)\r\n  (where the jury awarded $7.50 in actual damages and $1,000 in punitive damages\r\n  against an insurer who repudiated a health insurance policy by failing to send\r\n  a notice of premiums due after the insured filed a claim for gall-bladder\r\n  trouble, and attempted to have the insured agree to a retroactive rider\r\n  excluding illnesses resulting from gall-bladder trouble); Riley v. Life\r\n    &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., 184 S.C. 383, 192 S.E. 394 (1937) (where the jury\r\n  awarded $36 in actual damages and $1,000 in punitive damages against an insurer\r\n  who stopped collecting premiums from the insured after it was clear that his\r\n  health was failing and with the obvious intention to cancel the life insurance\r\n  policy);[9] Jamison v. American Workmen Ins. Co., 169 SC 400, 169 S.E. 83 (1933)\r\n  (where the jury awarded $20 in actual damages and $480 in punitive damages\r\n  against an insurer who stopped notifying the insured when premiums were due\r\n  after the insured became very ill in hopes that the insured would miss a\r\n  payment and thereby justify rescission).Â Â Â  \r\nIn reviewing more recent punitive damages awards, South Carolina courts have most often upheld verdicts on the low end of the single-digit\r\n  spectrum, but have frequently deviated from this norm in cases involving\r\n  particularly egregious conduct.[10]Â  See James, 371 S.C. at 196-97, 638 S.E.2d at 671-72 (upholding a 6.82 to\r\n  1 ratio); Mackela v. Bentley, 365 S.C. 44, 614 S.E.2d 648 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005) (upholding a 3.75 to 1 ratio); Austin v. Specialty Transp. Services,\r\n    Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 594 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 2004) (upholding a 2.54 to 1\r\n  ratio); Collins Entertainment Corp. v. Coats &amp; Coats Rental Amusement,\r\n  355 S.C. 125, 584 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 2003) (upholding a 9.96 to 1 ratio); Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins.\r\n    Co., 321 S.C. 1, 466 S.E.2d 727 (1996) (upholding a 28 to\r\n  1 ratio).Â  Cf. Atkinson, 361 S.C. at 170, 604 S.E.2d at 392-93\r\n  (overruling a 127 to 1 ratio).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  our view, the conduct in this case was reprehensible enough to merit an award\r\n  towards the outer limits of the single-digit ratio.Â  See Campbell, 538 U.S. at 425 (observing that few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and\r\n  compensatory damages will satisfy due process). Â Fortis willfully disregarded\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s health and safety, and the jury so found in assessing this punitive\r\n  damages award.Â  In assessing this remittitur, we place great emphasis upon that\r\n  consideration.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  therefore remit the punitive damages award to $10 million, resulting in a ratio\r\n  of 9.2 to 1.Â  We believe a $10 million award in this case satisfies due process\r\n  and comports with South Carolina law.Â  We are also certain that a $10 million\r\n  award will adequately vindicate the twin purposes of punishment and deterrence that\r\n  support the imposition of punitive damages.Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Evidence\r\n  at Trial\r\nFortis argues that\r\n  the judgment should be vacated, or judgment rendered in its favor, because the\r\n  circuit court erred in admitting certain evidence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA.Â  Other Rescissions\r\nFortis\r\n  argues that the circuit court allowed the jury to consider evidence that the\r\n  rescission committee harmed nonparties to the suit, in violation of its\r\n  constitutional rights.Â  See Campbell, 538 U.S. at 420.Â  Fortis asserts that the jury should not have considered evidence indicating\r\n  that forty-five other rescission cases were considered with Mitchellâ€™s in the\r\n  course of a two-hour committee meeting.Â  This argument is without merit.Â  It is\r\n  evident from the record that Mitchell introduced this evidence in order to\r\n  establish the inference that Fortis could not have spent more than three\r\n  minutes in deliberating the rescission of Mitchellâ€™s policy.Â  Fortis could have\r\n  defended itself from such evidence had the rescission committee kept minutes in\r\n  its meetings.Â  The circuit court did not err in allowing this evidence.Â  \r\nB.Â  Post-claim Underwriting\r\nFortis\r\n  argues that the circuit court erred in allowing testimony regarding Fortisâ€™s\r\n  retrospective investigation practices, also known as â€œpost-claim\r\n  underwriting.â€Â  Fortis asserts that expert testimony indicating that this\r\n  practice is unlawful in â€œat least half a dozen statesâ€ constituted evidence of\r\n  out-of-state conduct that violated Fortisâ€™s constitutional right to due\r\n  process.Â  See Campbell, 538 U.S. 408.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFortis\r\n  argues that, as a general matter, post-claim underwriting is â€œperfectly lawfulâ€\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  However, in the context of this case, Fortisâ€™s post-claim\r\n  underwriting practices played a pivotal role in the harm inflicted upon\r\n  Mitchell in South Carolina.Â  This evidence was probative of Fortisâ€™s bad faith\r\n  conduct, and was properly submitted to the jury. \r\nC.Â  Improper Litigation Conduct\r\nFortis\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider evidence\r\n  that Fortis engaged in â€œimproper conductâ€ following the September 4, 2002\r\n  rescission committee meeting on the grounds that â€œdissimilar acts, independent\r\n  from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for\r\n  punitive damages.â€Â  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 422.Â  We disagree for three\r\n  reasons.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  the rescission was not final until June 2003 review of Mitchellâ€™s â€œappeal.â€ Â At\r\n  a bare minimum, all evidence of concealment until that point is allowable.Â \r\n  Second, this evidence is probative of Fortisâ€™s bad faith liability, not\r\n  punitive damages.Â  Lastly, Fortis waived any objection to the admission of\r\n  evidence of bad acts that occurred after the second rescission committee\r\n  meeting by: (1) repeatedly emphasizing their own â€œgood actâ€ of reinstatement\r\n  following the â€œtemporaryâ€ rescission, and (2) repeatedly arguing that Mitchell\r\n  himself acted negligently in failing to submit additional information prior to\r\n  March 8, 2004. \r\nD.Â  Value of\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s Free Medical Treatment\r\nFortis\r\n  argues that the circuit court erred in allowing the jury to consider the value\r\n  of the free medical care Mitchell received from Hope Health.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  value of Mitchellâ€™s free medical care is relevant to the determination of\r\n  damages because the collateral source rule provides that an award for damages\r\n  should not be decreased if the plaintiff receives compensation for all or part\r\n  of the damage from a collateral source.Â  See Haselden v. Davis, 353 S.C.\r\n  481, 579 S.E.2d 293 (2003) (holding that the proper measure of damages is the\r\n  â€œreasonable valueâ€ of the medical services, even if the plaintiff receives the\r\n  treatment free or at a discount).Â  In this case, the value of Mitchellâ€™s free\r\n  medical treatment is necessary to the determination of the amount of damage\r\n  Fortis inflicted upon Mitchell in rescinding his policy. \r\nE.Â  Mitchellâ€™s Future Medical Expenses \r\nFortis\r\n  argues that the circuit court erred in allowing the jury to consider the value\r\n  of the Mitchellâ€™s future medical expenses.Â  This objection, however, is\r\n  meritless.Â  This evidence is probative of Fortisâ€™s financial motive to rescind\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s policy, and we find it is relevant to Mitchellâ€™s allegations of bad\r\n  faith.Â  \r\nF.&nbsp; Mitchellâ€™s Risk of Death \r\nWithout Appropriate Medication\r\nFortis\r\n  argues that the circuit court erred in allowing the jury to consider the risk\r\n  of death Mitchell faced without treatment, because it was â€œirrelevant, highly\r\n  prejudicial, and . . . inflamed the jury.â€Â  We find this assertion to be\r\n  entirely without merit.Â  Evidence of the risk Mitchell faced without health\r\n  insurance coverage is properly admissible to establish Fortisâ€™s\r\n  reprehensibility and support an award for punitive damages.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Fortisâ€™s\r\n  Motion for JNOV\r\nWe\r\n  find it patently clear from the record that there is no support for Fortisâ€™s\r\n  claim that â€œthe evidence as a whole is susceptible to only one reasonable\r\n  inferenceâ€ that Fortis was not liable for bad faith rescission of Mitchellâ€™s\r\n  health insurance policy.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Passion,\r\n  Caprice, and Prejudice\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  we find no credible evidence anywhere in the record to support Fortisâ€™s\r\n  contention that â€œthe juryâ€™s $15 million punitive damages award and/or its\r\n  $150,000 compensatory damages award were the result of passion, caprice, or\r\n  prejudice, and therefore must be reversed and a new trial ordered.â€Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the forgoing\r\n  reasons, we affirm the juryâ€™s finding of liability on the bad faith cause of\r\n  action, affirm the $150,000 compensatory damages award, and remit the $15 million\r\n  punitive damages award to $10 million.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The addendum was not signed.Â  However, the record strongly supports the conclusion\r\n  that Stephens was the author, a fact that Fortis neither admitted nor denied.\r\n[2] Stephens had a similar conversation with Mitchellâ€™s\r\n  insurance agent, who called to inquire about the rescission at the request of\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s mother.Â  Stephens explained that Mitchell had misrepresented a pre-existing\r\n  condition on his application form, and provided no information regarding\r\n  Mitchellâ€™s right to an appeal.Â Â Â  \r\n[3] This notation was in error, as Mitchell was HIV positive, and did not have\r\n  AIDS.Â Â  \r\n[4] Â Fortis eventually reinstated Mitchellâ€™s policy on May 27, 2004, well after the\r\n  litigation had begun.\r\n[5] Deborah Poston, an employee of Carolina, testified\r\n  that when Mitchellâ€™s counsel notified her on March 8, 2004 that there might be\r\n  an error on one of the records, she reviewed the medical chart and determined\r\n  that there was a discrepancy in the date.Â  Poston testified that it took her\r\n  â€œfive minutesâ€ to verify the correct date.Â  She further indicated that all\r\n  records are kept chronologically, and that the misdated note was included with\r\n  2002 medical records.Â  Other contextual clues included Mitchellâ€™s age on the\r\n  note, which indicated he was eighteen (he would have been seventeen in 2001),\r\n  the corresponding day and month with the other records from Dr. Chandlerâ€™s\r\n  office, and Dr. Sheaâ€™s referral summary, which Fortis claimed it did not have\r\n  but Mitchell alleged was in the file.Â  \r\n[6] Mitchell introduced evidence that forty-five other cases were\r\n  considered with Mitchellâ€™s in a single two-hour meeting.Â  Mitchell thus argued\r\n  that it was unlikely that the committee spent more than three minutes on any\r\n  one case, including Mitchellâ€™s.Â Â  \r\n[7] We observe that this analysis adequately encompasses - and obviates the need\r\n  for - the first four factors of the Gamble review, which include the\r\n  defendantâ€™s degree of culpability, the duration of the conduct, the defendantâ€™s\r\n  awareness or concealment, and the existence of similar past conduct.Â  \r\n[8] We caution that trial courts must be careful about considering the\r\n  net worth of the defendant.Â  Wealth cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional\r\n  punitive damages award.Â  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 427.Â  While the\r\n  ability to pay remains relevant to the post-judgment due process review, a punitive\r\n  damages award should never be based solely on a percentage of the defendantâ€™s net\r\n  worth.Â  \r\n[9] These humble verdicts appear quaint in light of todayâ€™s multimillion dollar\r\n  awards.Â  Nevertheless, it helps to keep in mind that this $1,000 punitive\r\n  damages award was imposed for breach of a contract involving only $155 in life\r\n  insurance, paid at a weekly premium of 25 cents.\r\n[10] Fortis is correct to observe that most of South Carolinaâ€™s\r\n  punitive damages awards have been on the low end of the single-digit-ratio spectrum.Â \r\n  That does not mean the constitution requires this to be so.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26719","title":"Bryant v.

Pachak, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari\r\n  to review the grant of post-conviction relief (PCR) to Pete S. Bryant.Â  On\r\n  December 11, 1997, Bryant was convicted of armed robbery.Â  Because Bryant had\r\n  â€œprior conviction[s]â€ for armed robbery, he was sentenced to life without\r\n  parole under section 17-25-45 of the South Carolina Code.Â  The PCR court ruled\r\n  that Bryant was not subject to a life without parole sentence and vacated the\r\n  sentence.Â  We reverse.\r\nI.\r\nOn\r\n  December 27, 1996, at approximately 1:30 p.m., while armed with a pistol,\r\n  Bryant and accomplices robbed the E-Z Shop BP Station in Orangeburg County, South Carolina.Â  The next day, December 28, around 2:00 a.m., Bryant and accomplices committed\r\n  a second armed robbery of a convenience store, this time in Colleton County.Â  On December 29, shortly before midnight, Bryant and accomplices committed a\r\n  third and final armed robbery in Jasper County.Â  In early January 1997, Bryant\r\n  was arrested and charged with three armed robberies.\r\nBryant\r\n  pled guilty on July 8, 1997, to the armed robberies in Colleton and Jasper Counties and was sentenced to ten years in prison.Â  On December 11, 1997, Bryant was\r\n  convicted of the Orangeburg County armed robbery.Â  The trial court sentenced\r\n  Bryant to life without parole in light of its reading of sections 17-25-45 and 17-25-50\r\n  of the South Carolina Code.Â  Trial counsel failed to challenge the courtâ€™s\r\n  construction of these statutes.Â  Bryantâ€™s direct appeal was affirmed by the\r\n  court of appeals. Â State v. Bryant, Op. No. 99-UP-654 (S.C. Ct. App.\r\n  filed Dec. 21, 1999).\r\nII.\r\nBryantâ€™s\r\n  initial application for PCR in 2000 was denied.Â  In 2003, this Court held in State\r\n    v Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 154, 588 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2003) that sections\r\n  17-25-45 and 17-25-50 â€œmust be construed together in determining whether crimes\r\n  committed at points close in time qualify for a recidivist sentence.â€ Â The Gordon Court applied its decision retroactively.Â  Id. at 155 n.12, 588 S.E.2d\r\n  111 n.12.\r\nBased\r\n  on Gordon, Bryant filed the current PCR application in 2004 alleging\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to challenge the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  interpretation of sections 17-25-45(F) and 17-25-50.Â  Bryant asserted at the\r\n  PCR hearing that he was not a â€œcareer criminal,â€ the armed robberies were not\r\n  â€œisolated,â€ and the robberies constituted â€œone string of events.â€Â  The PCR\r\n  court agreed and granted relief.Â  The PCR court referenced Gordon and\r\n  found that â€œall the Applicantâ€™s armed robbery offenses stemmed from a single criminal\r\n  incident and were committed so closely in point of time as to be treated as one\r\n  offense under S.C. Code Ann. Section 17-25-50 (Supp. 2004).â€\r\nThe\r\n  State petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we granted.\r\nIII.\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court â€œwill reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision when it is controlled by\r\n  an error of law.â€ Â Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222,\r\n  225 (2000).Â  As this case involves statutory interpretation, we are presented\r\n  with a question of law.Â  See Catawba Indian Tribe of S.C. v. State, 372\r\n  S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007) (â€œThe issue of interpretation of a\r\n  statute is a question of law for the court.â€).\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the\r\n  intent of the legislature.â€Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v.\r\n    Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  A statute should be\r\n  read as a whole.Â  Id.Â  Further, â€œ[s]tatutes which\r\n  are part of the same legislative scheme should be read together.â€Â  Great\r\n    Games, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 339 S.C. 79, 84, 529 S.E.2d 6, 8 (2000).Â  â€œUnless there is something in the statute requiring a\r\n  different interpretation, the words used in a statute must be given their\r\n  ordinary meaning.â€Â  Mid-State Auto, 324 S.C. at 69, 476 S.E.2d at\r\n  692.\r\nIV.\r\nThe\r\n  resolution of this case requires the Court to examine the legislative history\r\n  of section 17-25-45, scrutinize the interplay between subsection (F) of section\r\n  17-25-45 and 17-25-50, and revisit Gordon, in light of the 2006\r\n  amendment to section 17-25-45(F).\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons discussed below, we adhere to that part of Gordon holding sections\r\n  17-25-45(F) and 17-25-50 must be construed together, as section 17-25-50\r\n  operates in some situations to preclude the imposition of a life without parole\r\n  sentence.Â  356 S.C. at 154, 588 S.E.2d 111.Â  We overrule Gordon insofar\r\n  as its assessment of legislative intent concerning sections 17-25-45(F) and\r\n  17-25-50.Â  356 S.C. at 153-54, 588 S.E.2d at 110-11.\r\nSpecifically,\r\n  referring to sections 17-25-45 and 17-25-50, a majority of this Court in Gordon stated â€œthe recidivist statute is aimed at career criminals, those who have been\r\n  previously sentenced and then commit another crime.â€ Â 356 S.C. at 154, 588\r\n  S.E.2d at 111.Â  Gordon further concluded that â€œ[t]he purpose of\r\n  requiring separate offenses is to ensure that those offenders being sentenced\r\n  under the harsh provisions of a recidivist sentencing statute have not been\r\n  classified as habitual offenders because of multiple convictions arising from a\r\n  single criminal enterprise.â€ Â Id. at 154, 588 S.E.2d at 110-11 (quoting State\r\n    v. Benjamin, 353 S.C. 441, 446, 579 S.E.2d 289, 291 (2003) (Waller, J.,\r\n  dissenting)).\r\nA.\r\nSection 17-25-45(F)\r\nIn\r\n  the abstract, the policy rationale of the majority in Gordon is entirely\r\n  defensible.Â  But the desired policy of the Gordon majority is at odds\r\n  with the unambiguous language in section 17-25-45(F).Â  We do not make this\r\n  finding lightly, for we recognize that a rigid application of section\r\n  17-25-45(F), standing alone, would lead to harsh results. Our perception of the\r\n  potential for harsh results, however, serves as no license to construe the\r\n  statute in a manner inconsistent with its clear language.Â  Moreover, as\r\n  addressed below, section 17-25-50 serves in most situations as a meaningful\r\n  safeguard to the perceived unfair imposition of a life without parole sentence.\r\nThe view\r\n  of the Gordon majority is, we believe, best understood by looking to the\r\n  predecessor to section 17-25-45(F).Â  In 1982, the Legislature repealed former\r\n  section 17-25-40 of the South Carolina Code (1976) and replaced it with section\r\n  17-25-45.Â  The statute listed certain offenses and provided that â€œany person\r\n  who has three convictionsâ€ shall be sentenced to life in prison.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(1)(A) (1985).Â  Of particular significance is the following\r\n  provision:\r\n\r\n\t[A]\r\n  conviction shall be considered a second conviction only if the date of the\r\n  commission of the second crime occurred subsequent to the imposition of the\r\n  sentence for the first offense.Â  A conviction shall be considered a third\r\n  conviction only if the date of the commission of the third crime occurred\r\n  subsequent to the imposition of the sentence for the second offense.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-25-45(1)(C) (1985).Â  The language of the 1982 statute fits well with policy\r\n  notions set forth in Gordon of â€œhabitual offenders,â€ â€œmultiple criminal\r\n  trials,â€ â€œmultiple convictions,â€ and â€œopportunities to understand the gravity\r\n  of [oneâ€™s] behavior.â€ Â Gordon, 356 S.C. at 154, 588 S.E.2d at 111.\r\nThe\r\n  1995 amendments to section 17-25-45 abandoned the necessity that a subsequent\r\n  offense for enhancement purposes occur after imposition of the sentence for the\r\n  prior offense.Â  The same is true with amendments subsequent to 1995.Â  Thus, while\r\n  the Gordon rationale fits well with the 1982 legislation, those policy\r\n  considerations are nowhere to be found in the prevailing statutory language,\r\n  effective with the 1995 amendments.\r\nIn\r\n  1996, when Bryant committed the armed robberies, subsection (F) provided:\r\n\r\n\tFor the\r\n  purpose of determining a prior conviction under this section only, a prior\r\n  conviction shall mean the defendant has been convicted of a most serious or\r\n  serious offense, as may be applicable, on a separate occasion, prior to the\r\n  instant adjudication.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(F) (Supp. 1995).\r\nAs noted, this\r\n  Court decided Gordon in 2003, making a determination of legislative intent\r\n  as to subsection (F).Â  In 2006, the Legislature amended section 17-25-45(F),\r\n  and we believe the amendment was in response to Gordon on two fronts.Â \r\n  First, the Legislature confirmed the correctness of Gordonâ€™s holding\r\n  that sections 17-25-45(F) and 17-25-50 must be construed together.Â  Second, the\r\n  Legislature repudiated Gordonâ€™s reading of â€œa prior or previous\r\n  conviction.â€\r\n\r\n\tFor the\r\n  purpose of determining a prior or previous conviction under this section and\r\n    Section 17-25-50, a prior or previous conviction shall mean the defendant\r\n  has been convicted of a most serious or serious offense, as may be applicable,\r\n  on a separate occasion, prior to the instant adjudication.Â  There is no\r\n    requirement that the sentence for the prior or previous conviction must have been\r\n    served or completed before a sentence of life without parole can be imposed\r\n    under this section.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(F)\r\n  (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).\r\nEven\r\n  in the absence of the second sentence added to subsection (F) in 2006, the\r\n  statute provides that â€œa prior conviction shall mean the defendant has been\r\n  convicted of a most serious or serious offense . . . on a separate occasion,\r\n  prior to the instant adjudication.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(F) (Supp. 1995).Â \r\n  Bryantâ€™s situation falls squarely within the triggering language of section\r\n  17-25-45(F), as it existed in 1996.Â  The last sentence in subsection (F), added\r\n  in 2006, confirms the timing feature contained in the first sentence and\r\n  repudiates Gordonâ€™s contrary interpretation. \r\nB.\r\nSection 17-25-50\r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  17-25-50 states:\r\n\tIn determining the number of offenses for\r\n  the purpose of imposition of sentence, the court shall treat as one offense any\r\n  number of offenses which have been committed at times so closely connected in\r\n  point of time that they may be considered as one offense, notwithstanding under\r\n  the law they constitute separate and distinct offenses.\r\n\r\nWhile\r\n  section 17-25-45(F) lends Bryant no support, the outcome of this case turns on\r\n  the meaning of section 17-25-50â€™s phrase\r\n  â€œso closely connected in point of time that they may be considered as one\r\n  offense.â€Â  We acknowledge the â€œso closely connected in point of timeâ€ language\r\n  in section 17-25-50 may become ambiguous as applied to certain situations.Â \r\n  When construing statutes forming part of the same legislative scheme, we must\r\n  examine the statutes together as a whole.Â  Accordingly, when we read the\r\n  unambiguous timing feature of â€œa prior convictionâ€ under section 17-25-45(F)\r\n  alongside section 17-25-50, we construe the language of section 17-25-50 to\r\n  preclude a life without parole sentence when the multiple offenses are\r\n  inextricably connected and share an immediate temporal proximity.\r\nState\r\n  v. Woody, 359 S.C. 1, 596 S.E.2d 907\r\n  (2004) illustrates a proper application of section 17-25-50 to preclude a life\r\n  without parole sentence.Â  Woody was convicted of second-degree burglary and had\r\n  two prior convictions for armed robbery.Â  Id. at 2, 596 S.E.2d at 907.Â  The\r\n  State sought to use both armed robbery convictions for enhancement purposes and\r\n  a life without parole sentence.Â  Id.Â  The Stateâ€™s position was rejected\r\n  because the armed robberies constituted, as a matter of law, one offense for\r\n  purposes of section 17-25-50.Â  Id. at 4, 596 S.E.2d at 908.Â  The two\r\n  armed robberies arose from a single\r\n  incident at the same time and at the same locationâ€”a robbery of the storeâ€™s\r\n  clerk and the store itself.Â  Id. at 2, 596 S.E.2d at 907.\r\nIn Koon\r\n  v. State, 372 S.C. 531, 534, 643 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2007), this Court held a\r\n  burglary committed on March 28th of a different building and a different\r\n  location clearly constituted a separate offense from burglaries occurring two\r\n  weeks prior on March 13th and March 14th.Â  Due to this determination, it was\r\n  not necessary for this Court to determine if the March 13th and March 14th burglaries\r\n  were so closely connected to constitute one offense. Â Today we address the\r\n  question left unanswered in Koon.\r\nOur\r\n  assessment of legislative intentâ€”multiple offenses inextricably connected and\r\n  sharing an immediate temporal proximityâ€”will not provide a sure answer in every\r\n  circumstance.Â  Because the â€œso closely connected in point of timeâ€ language in\r\n  section 17-25-50 may become ambiguous in some situations, it necessarily\r\n  follows that section 17-25-50 does not lend itself to a bright-line rule.Â  This\r\n  Court so held in Koon.Â  When a genuine ambiguity exists as a\r\n  result of the proposed application of section 17-25-50 to a given situation,\r\n  the rule of lenity requires\r\n  that the doubt must be resolved in the\r\n  defendantâ€™s favor. Â State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660,\r\n  662 (1991) (recognizing the settled rule that penal statutes must be strictly\r\n  construed in the defendantâ€™s favor); see also United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 17 (1994) (observing that\r\n  the rule of lenity â€œapplies only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory\r\n  construction, we are left with an ambiguous statuteâ€). Â Bifulco v. United\r\n    States, 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980) (â€œ[T]he â€˜touchstoneâ€™ of the rule of lenity\r\n  â€˜is statutory ambiguity.â€™â€).\r\nWe\r\n  find no ambiguity concerning the application of section 17-25-50 to Bryantâ€™s\r\n  multiple armed robberies over several days.Â  Bryant committed the three separate\r\n  armed robberies on different days, at different locations, and the robberies\r\n  involved different victims.Â  These separate and distinct crimes over a several\r\n  day period were not inextricably connected and did not share an immediate\r\n  temporal proximity.Â  Thus, Bryantâ€™s multiple armed robberies may not, as a\r\n  matter of law, be considered â€œone offenseâ€ under section 17-25-50.\r\nWe\r\n  emphasize that the determination of the number of prior convictions under\r\n  section 17-25-45(F) must be made in conjunction with the section 17-25-50 â€œone\r\n  offenseâ€ safeguard.Â  Cases involving the life without parole statutory scheme\r\n  tend to raise the specter of two concerns.Â  First, without the link between\r\n  sections 17-25-45(F) and 17-25-50, troubling issues would arise from the timing of the adjudications when a defendant is arrested and charged with multiple\r\n  serious offenses.Â  Assuming a defendant is adjudicated guilty, disposing of all\r\n  charges at the same time will avoid the application of section 17-25-45(F) as\r\n  it relates to those charges and preclude a life without parole sentence.Â  This\r\n  is so even if the offenses, if adjudicated separately, would otherwise require\r\n  a life without parole sentence.Â  Conversely, disposing of the charges at\r\n  different times would result in a life without parole sentence, unless the â€œone\r\n  offenseâ€ provision of section 17-25-50 operates to foreclose a life sentence.Â \r\n  It would be an unsettling policy that allows the state to manipulate the timing\r\n  of the adjudications of guilt to pursue a life without parole sentence.Â  Hence\r\n  the importance of section 17-25-50â€™s â€œone offenseâ€ safeguard.\r\nThis\r\n  leads to the second concern.Â  The language of section 17-25-50 is ambiguous\r\n  when applied to certain situations.Â  The imprecise language, â€œso closely\r\n  connected in point of time that they may be considered as one offense,â€ does\r\n  not remove in every situation the potential for manipulating the timing of the adjudications.Â \r\n  As with Bryantâ€™s multiple and separate armed robberies, the applicability or\r\n  nonapplicability of section 17-25-50 may be readily apparent in most\r\n  circumstances.Â  Nevertheless, section 17-25-50â€™s imprecise language will\r\n  continue to generate uncertainty in some situations.Â  Pending clarification\r\n  from the Legislature, we earnestly attempt today to discern legislative intent.\r\nV.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we hold: (1) section 17-25-45 operates to trigger a life without parole\r\n  sentence under the respective â€œtwo-strikesâ€ and â€œthree-strikesâ€ provisions; (2)\r\n  subsection (F) of section 17-25-45 sets forth a straightforward timing feature\r\n  for identifying â€œa prior conviction;â€ and (3) section 17-25-50 is intended to\r\n  serve as a legislatively sanctioned safeguard to ensure that a life without\r\n  parole sentence is not imposed in cases where the multiple section 17-25-45\r\n  offenses are â€œso closely connected in point of time that they may be considered\r\n  as one offense,â€ Â which we construe to mean the offenses are inextricably connected\r\n  and share an immediate temporal proximity.Â  In essence, what may be charged as\r\n  two, three or more strikes under section 17-25-45 must be deemed â€œone-strikeâ€\r\n  for sentencing purposes under section 17-25-50 and, as a result, preclude a\r\n  life without parole sentence.Â  We believe this approach most closely hews to\r\n  legislative intent based on what is admittedly imprecise statutory language.\r\nWe\r\n  reverse the grant of PCR to Bryant.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., concurs. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion. BEATTY\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion in which WALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in Justice Kittredgeâ€™s decision to reverse\r\n  the grant of post-conviction relief to respondent as I continue to believe that State v. Benjamin, 353 S.C. 441, 579 S.E.2d 289 (2003) was correctly\r\n  decided and should apply to persons such as respondent who received an LWOP\r\n  sentence pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 prior to the amendment of Â§\r\n  17-25-45 (F), effective July 1, 2006.Â  Further, I concur in his analysis of the\r\n  impact of the 2006 amendment on the interplay between Â§ 17-25-45 and S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-25-50 on cases arising after the effective date of that amendment.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  I disagree with the\r\n  majorityâ€™s analysis of the import of the Legislatureâ€™s 2006 amendment to\r\n  section 17-25-45(F).Â  In my view, this amendment does not call into question\r\n  the Gordon decision or its expression of legislative intent.\r\nSection\r\n  17-25-45(F) recognizes Gordonâ€™s requirement that it should be read\r\n  together with section 17-25-50.Â  To do so does not mean section 17-25-45(F)\r\n  should be read to the exclusion of section 17-25-50; nor does it mean that\r\n  section 17-25-50 acquired a new meaning or should be interpreted differently.Â \r\n  These sections should be interpreted in a manner that gives effect to both.Â \r\n  This may be accomplished by recognizing that section 17-25-45 focuses on how to determine a prior conviction and section 17-25-50 focuses on how a\r\n  conviction should be treated for sentencing purposes under certain circumstances.\r\nThe\r\n  issue in this case is the same as in Gordon; that is the correct\r\n  interpretation of section 17-25-50.Â  Section 17-25-50 is unquestionably\r\n  ambiguous in its use of the language â€œ. . . committed at times so closely\r\n  connected in point of time that they may be considered as one offense . . . .â€Â \r\n  There is no requirement under section 17-25-50 that multiple offenses occur at\r\n  the same time or in the same transaction.Â  Yet, the majority injects a\r\n  contemporaneous transactional requirement though none is found in either\r\n  section 17-25-45(e) or section 17-25-50 and is unnecessary to effectuate the\r\n  intent of either section.\r\nThe\r\n  Legislature has had ample opportunity since Gordon to further clarify\r\n  section 17-25-50 but has not done so.Â  Thus, it would appear that Gordonâ€™s\r\n  interpretation of legislative intent is correct.Â  The Legislatureâ€™s focus is\r\n  recidivism, and flexibility in interpreting â€œclose in timeâ€ is necessary to\r\n  give effect to legislative intent.Â  In Gordon, the multiple offenses\r\n  took place over a period of seven days.Â  Here, the offenses took place during a\r\n  period of fifty-four hours.Â  Assuming an LWOP sentence is inappropriate under\r\n  the facts of the instant case, Bryant would still be exposed to multiple,\r\n  maximum consecutive sentences.\r\n\r\nI\r\n  would affirm.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26724","title":"All Saints v.

Russell Campbell (â€œthe majority vestryâ€).Â  In\r\n  the 2005 Action, the minority vestry sought a declaration that they, and not\r\n  the majority vestry, were the officers of All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.Â \r\n  The 2000 Action and the 2005 Action were consolidated and tried in March 2006.Â \r\n  This appeal is from the trial courtâ€™s order.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  facts relevant to this appeal date to the early eighteenth century.Â Â  By the\r\n  Church Act of 1706, the South Carolina Commons House of Assembly (â€œCommons\r\n  Houseâ€) established the Church of England as the official religion of colonial\r\n  South Carolina and created the first parishes in the colony. Â Parishes were regionally\r\n  defined and served as ecclesiastical and political entities.Â  All Saints\r\n  Parish, however, was not formed at that time.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1734, George Pawley, a member of the Commons House, was appointed by\r\n  legislative enactment to erect church buildings in the St. Johnâ€™s and the Prince\r\n  George Parishes.Â  He was â€œauthorized to accept and take any grant or conveyance\r\n  of any lands within said parishes respectively, to them and their heirs, in\r\n  trust, for the inhabitants of said parishes.â€Â  Act No. 567 at Â§ 6, 3 S.C. Stat.\r\n  374, 375 (1734).Â  In 1745, Percival and Ann Pawley transferred approximately 60\r\n  acres to George Pawley and William Poole.Â  The language of this trust deed\r\n  (â€œthe 1745 Trust Deedâ€) provided that George Pawley and William Poole were\r\n  deeded the land â€œforever in Trust For the Inhabitants On Waccamaw Neck for Use\r\n  of A Chapel or Church for divine Worship of the Church of England established\r\n  by Lawâ€¦â€.Â  Consideration for this transfer was â€œthe Sum of one hundred pounds\r\n  current Money of South Carolina.â€[2]Â \r\n  The terms of the 1745 Trust Deed did not bestow any duties upon the trustees,\r\n  and there is no evidence to suggest that the trustees exercised any duties\r\n  relative to the 1745 Trust Deed.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  December 10, 1766, the inhabitants of the Waccamaw Neck formally petitioned the\r\n  Commons House requesting the establishment of their own parish.Â  In 1767, an\r\n  Act of the Commons House carved out a piece of the Prince George Parish, thus\r\n  creating a new Parish named All Saints in the Waccamaw Neck region.Â \r\n  Subsequently, on January 2, 1767, the 1745 Trust Deed was recorded in Charleston.[3] Â By 1774, both George Pawley and William Poole had died.Â  Neither the 1745 Trust\r\n  Deed nor the trusteeâ€™s wills named a successor trustee.Â  By all accounts, the\r\n  property at issue has been actively used as a place of worship since at least\r\n  1767, if not before.Â  \r\nThe relationship\r\n  between South Carolinaâ€™s colonial parishes and the Diocese of London was\r\n  severed during the Revolutionary War.Â  Nonetheless, the South Carolina General\r\n  Assembly re-established All Saints Parish in 1778.Â  Even though the Church of\r\n  England was formally disestablished as the official religion of South Carolina in 1790, the property at issue continued to be used as a place of worship.Â  \r\nÂ In\r\n  1820, the South Carolina General Assembly passed an Act which officially\r\n  incorporated the wardens and the vestry of All Saints Parish.Â  The Act\r\n  expressly enabled the congregation to â€œhave, hold, take and receiveâ€ both real\r\n  and personal property.Â  The congregationâ€™s incorporation was only effective for\r\n  a period of fourteen years.Â Â  In 1839, the South Carolina General Assembly\r\n  renewed the incorporation for an additional fourteen years and, in 1852, the\r\n  General Assembly did so indefinitely.\r\nAn\r\n  1880 Act of the South Carolina General Assembly established that title to any\r\n  property belonging to inactive Episcopal corporations, churches, or dormant\r\n  parishes was held in trust by the Trustees of the South Carolina Episcopal\r\n  Diocese.Â  The record makes clear that in 1902, due to the 1880 Act, the All\r\n  Saints congregation became concerned over the status of their incorporation and\r\n  the status of title to church property.Â  Evidence in the record also indicates\r\n  that this concern was exacerbated by the destruction of certain property\r\n  records in a â€œgreat storm.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  May 1902, as a result of its concern, the congregation asked the Diocese to\r\n  â€œcooperate with [them] in having the charter of th[e] Parish renewed.â€Â  The\r\n  Dioceseâ€™s Chancellor responded positively and not only suggested that the\r\n  congregation formally incorporate with the Secretary of State as a South\r\n  Carolina eleemosynary corporation, but also indicated that the Diocese would\r\n  execute a quit-claim deed transferring to the congregation any interest the\r\n  Diocese may have had in the All Saints property.Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nTherefore,\r\n  at the direction of the Diocese, the congregation re-incorporated in 1902 under\r\n  the name â€œAll Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.â€Â  Shortly thereafter, in 1903, the\r\n  Trustees of the Diocese signed a quit-claim deed (hereinafter the â€œ1903\r\n  Quit-Claim Deedâ€) transferring any interest the Diocese may have had in the congregationâ€™s\r\n  property to All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc. Â The Diocese did not retain any\r\n  interest in the property, reversionary or otherwise.Â  The 1903 Quit-Claim Deed\r\n  was recorded in the Georgetown County public records on May 30, 1903.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1987, the Diocese amended its constitution and canons so as to include the\r\n  â€œDennis Canon.â€Â  The Dennis Canon purports to declare a trust, in favor of the\r\n  ECUSA and the Diocese, on all real and personal property held by any\r\n  congregation.[4]Â \r\n  No such property canons existed in 1902 when the Diocese directed the\r\n  congregation to incorporate, or when it executed the 1903 Quit-Claim Deed in\r\n  favor of the newly created All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc. \r\nIn\r\n  August 2000, due to concern over the status of title to its property, the All\r\n  Saints congregation conducted a formal title examination.Â  The examiner\r\n  concluded that the 1745 Trust Deed and the 1903 Quit-Claim Deed were the only\r\n  recorded deeds pertaining to the congregationâ€™s property.Â  Soon thereafter, in\r\n  September 2000, the Diocese recorded a notice in Georgetown County purporting\r\n  to declare that the congregation held its property, pursuant to the Dennis\r\n  Canon, in trust for the benefit of the ECUSA and the Diocese (â€œthe 2000 Noticeâ€).Â \r\n  Because of the 2000 Notice and the 1745 Trust Deed, the congregation was unable\r\n  to acquire title insurance.\r\nIn\r\n  October 2000, the congregation, in the name of its corporate entity, All Saints\r\n  Parish, Waccamaw, Inc., filed a declaratory judgment action against the ECUSA\r\n  and the Diocese in which it sought an order declaring that the congregation\r\n  held title to its property or, in the alternative, held its property in trust\r\n  for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Waccamaw Neck pursuant to the 1745 Trust\r\n  Deed.Â  The Diocese and the ECUSA answered and counterclaimed asserting that the\r\n  property was subject to their canons and the 2000 Notice.Â  \r\nBy\r\n  consent order, a guardian ad litem was appointed to represent the\r\n  interests of John and Jane Doe, the unknown heirs of the original trustees to\r\n  the 1745 Trust Deed, George Pawley and William Poole.Â  The Does and the\r\n  congregation filed joint motions for summary judgment. Â The motions were\r\n  granted and, pursuant to the 1745 Trust Deed, the trial court found that the\r\n  Does held legal title to the property at issue and that the inhabitants of the\r\n  Waccamaw Neck held equitable title as beneficiaries to the 1745 Trust Deed.Â \r\n  The matter was remanded to the probate court for further fact finding with\r\n  respect to the identity of the parties to the 1745 Trust Deed.\r\nThe\r\n  ECUSA and Diocese appealed.Â  The court of appeals found that there were genuine\r\n  issues of material fact concerning whether the trust created by the 1745 Trust\r\n  Deed failed when the Church of England ceased to be established as the official\r\n  religion of South Carolina and whether the Statute of Uses operated to execute the\r\n  trust.Â  Accordingly, the court of appeals remanded the case to the circuit\r\n  court. Â All Saints Parish, Waccamaw v. The Protestant Episcopal Church in\r\n    the Diocese of South Carolina, 358 S.C. 209, 595 S.E.2d 253 (Ct. App. 2004),\r\n  cert denied, July 2005. \r\nIn\r\n  August 2003, prompted by events that are not relevant here, the congregation appointed\r\n  a committee to recommend whether it should leave the Diocese and the ECUSA.Â  On\r\n  December 9, 2003 the committee recommended that the corporate charter of All\r\n  Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc. be amended so as to delete references to the\r\n  canons and rules of the Diocese and the ECUSA.Â  Specifically, the committee\r\n  recommended that â€œArticle Fourthâ€[5] of the 1902 Certificate of Incorporation be amended to read:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    purpose of All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc., also known as All Saints Church,\r\n    is to create an environment in which all people and especially the inhabitants\r\n    of the Waccamaw Neck come to know Jesus Christ: to Love Him, to Worship Him, to\r\n    Learn of Him, to Proclaim Him, and to Minister in His Name.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the committee\r\n  recommended that the congregation additionally amend its charter so as to\r\n  affirmatively sever its affiliation with the ECUSA and the Diocese.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  December 17, 2003, after learning of the proposed amendments, Edward L. Salmon,\r\n  Jr., Bishop of the Diocese, sent a letter to the congregationâ€™s wardens and\r\n  each member of the vestry stating that the congregationâ€™s status was reduced from\r\n  that of a parish to a â€œmission.â€Â  In his letter, Bishop Salmon also declared that\r\n  the members of the congregationâ€™s vestry had abandoned their offices.[6]Â  \r\nOn\r\n  December 21, 2003, sixty members of the congregation signed a â€œRequest for\r\n  Special Congregational Meeting.â€Â  The purpose of this meeting was to discuss\r\n  and vote on whether the congregation should take the committeeâ€™s recommendations\r\n  and vote to amend its charter so as to change its corporate purpose and sever\r\n  its affiliation with the ECUSA and the Diocese.Â  Â Â Notice of the meeting was\r\n  sent to the congregationâ€™s members on December 23, 2003.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 8, 2004, five-hundred and seven of the congregationâ€™s members attended\r\n  the Special Congregational Meeting and more than a two-thirds majority voted to\r\n  amend the congregationâ€™s 1902 Certificate of Incorporation adopting the\r\n  aforementioned amendment to â€œArticle Fourth.â€Â  Additionally, more than a\r\n  two-thirds majority voted to amend the charter so as to withdraw from the\r\n  Diocese and the ECUSA, but remain part of the Anglican Communion by affiliating\r\n  themselves with the Episcopal Church of Rwanda and its Anglican Mission in America.[7]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the corporate secretary for All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.\r\n  prepared and signed the Articles of Amendment to the 1902 Certificate of\r\n  Incorporation.Â  These Articles of Amendment were filed in the South Carolina\r\n  Secretary of Stateâ€™s office on January 15, 2004. \r\nOn\r\n  January 9, 2005, a small group of members who remained loyal to the Diocese and\r\n  the ECUSA met with Bishop Salmon and purported to elect a new vestry for the\r\n  congregation - the minority vestry.Â  Subsequently, on January 16, 2004, the\r\n  majority group of members re-elected the vestry removed by the Bishop - the\r\n  majority vestry.Â  Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  January 20, 2005, the minority vestry filed the 2005 Action against the majority\r\n  vestry alleging that they forfeited office by recommending that the\r\n  congregation sever its affiliation with the ECUSA and the Diocese.Â  The minority\r\n  vestry sought a declaration that they were All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.â€™s\r\n  true officers.Â  Additionally, they sought the return of the congregationâ€™s real\r\n  and personal property.Â  The Diocese and Bishop Salmon joined in the action.Â \r\n  Subsequently, the trial court consolidated the 2000 Action and the 2005\r\n  Action.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  consolidated cases were tried and, after each of the parties presented its\r\n  case, the trial court decided both underlying actions as a matter of law.Â  With\r\n  respect to the 2000 Action, the trial court held that, pursuant to the terms of\r\n  the 1745 Trust Deed, legal title to the real property remained in the unknown\r\n  Heirs of George Pawley and William Poole, while beneficial title was possessed\r\n  by the â€œinhabitants of Waccamaw Neck.â€[8]Â \r\n  As to the 2005 Action, the trial court held that members of the minority vestry\r\n  were the true officers of All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.Â  In its original\r\n  bench order, however, the trial court declined to eject the majority group from\r\n  the real property because the identity of the parties to the trust created by\r\n  the 1745 Trust Deed was yet to be determined by the probate court.Â  Nonetheless,\r\n  upon a motion for reconsideration, the trial court ordered the Secretary of\r\n  State to cancel the Articles of Amendment filed by the majority group, ejected\r\n  the majority vestry from the property it occupied which was not granted to the\r\n  congregation by the 1745 Trust Deed, and restrained the majority vestry from\r\n  acting as the officers of All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.Â  \r\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the trial court and the\r\n  parties raise the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in holding\r\n  that the trust created by the 1745 Trust Deed remains valid?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in holding\r\n  that members of minority vestry were the corporate officers of All Saints\r\n  Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nBecause the trial court made its ruling on the 2000\r\n  Action pursuant to Rule 39(b), SCRCP, the standard of review with respect to\r\n  the 2000 Action is the same as that for an action at law tried without a jury.Â \r\n  In an action at law tried without a jury, the judgeâ€™s finding of fact will not\r\n  be disturbed unless there is no evidence to support the courtâ€™s finding.Â  Jowers\r\n    v. Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 552, 357 S.E.2d 710, 711 (1987).Â  \r\nThe standard of\r\n  review for the grant of a directed verdict applies to the review of the 2005\r\n  Action.Â  When reviewing a denial of a motion for directed verdict, this Court\r\n  applies the same standard as the trial court.Â  Gadson ex rel. Gadson v. ECO\r\n    Services of South Carolina, Inc., 374 S.C. 171, 175, 648 S.E.2d 585, 588\r\n  (2007).Â  In ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is\r\n  required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn\r\n  therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  Hurd\r\n    v. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 426, 611 S.E.2d 488, 491 (2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn\r\n  this case, we are called upon to adjudicate two disputes.Â  The 2000 Action is a\r\n  dispute between a congregation and its denomination over title to church\r\n  property.Â  The 2005 Action is a dispute among the congregationâ€™s members over\r\n  corporate control.Â  Because church disputes are very often prompted by\r\n  disagreements over religious doctrine and belief, the civil courts in this\r\n  country have addressed them carefully, keeping the First Amendment in mind.Â  The\r\n  decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning church dispute\r\n  litigation make clear that there is no constitutionally prescribed rule for a\r\n  civil courtâ€™s disposition of such matters.Â  Nonetheless, there is a general\r\n  constitutional command, based in the First Amendment, mandating that civil\r\n  courts Â â€œdecide churchâ€¦disputes without resolving underlying controversies over\r\n  religious doctrine.â€Â  Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich,\r\n  426 U.S. 696, 710 (1976).Â  \r\nWithin\r\n  the context of this general constitutional command, the Supreme Court of the United States has expressly approved two methods for a civil courtâ€™s resolution of church\r\n  disputes.Â  These approaches have become known as the â€œdeference approachâ€ and\r\n  the â€œneutral principles of law approach.â€Â  We hereby explicitly reaffirm that,\r\n  when resolving church dispute cases, South Carolina courts are to apply the neutral\r\n  principles of law approach as approved by the Supreme Court of the United\r\n  States in Jones v. Wolf, 443 U.S. 595 (1979), and expressed by this\r\n  Court in Pearson v. Church of God, 325 S.C. 45, 478 S.E.2d 849 (1996).Â \r\n  The following context is necessary for a clear understanding of this rule and\r\n  its application to the facts presented by this case.\r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court of the United States first approved the â€œdeference approachâ€ in\r\n  1871.Â  See Watson v. Jones, 80 U.S. 679 (1871).Â  Under this approach, a\r\n  court must only determine whether a church is â€œcongregationalâ€ or\r\n  â€œhierarchicalâ€ in nature.[9]Â \r\n  If the church is congregational, the court will resolve the dispute by deferring\r\n  to a majority of the congregation.Â  However, if the congregation at issue is\r\n  part of a hierarchical organization, the court will defer to the decision of\r\n  the ecclesiastical authorities.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the deference approach was, for a long time, the only approach explicitly\r\n  approved as constitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, this Court has issued a handful of opinions that are consistent with the deference\r\n  approach.Â  See Bramlett v. Young, 229 S.C. 519, 93 S.E.2d 873\r\n  (1956) (holding that a minority group of a local,\r\n  hierarchical Presbyterian churchâ€™s members were entitled to ownership and\r\n  control of church property because they were recognized as the true\r\n  congregation by the hierarchical authorities);Adickes v. Adkins,\r\n  264 S.C. 394, 215 S.E.2d 442 (1975) (holding that where a majority of a local\r\n  Presbyterian congregation voted to sever its connection with its hierarchical\r\n  authorities, the minority faction which the hierarchical authorities recognized\r\n  as the true congregation was entitled to control of the church properties); Seldon\r\n    v. Singletary, 248 S.C. 148, 326 S.E.2d 147 (1985) (holding that a local\r\n  church was part of a hierarchical denomination, thus, the minority group of\r\n  members recognized by the hierarchical authorities were entitled to possession\r\n  and control of church property).Â  In each of these cases we applied the deference\r\n  approach and analyzed the issues by determining whether the church at issue was\r\n  congregational or hierarchical in nature and deferred accordingly.Â  This short\r\n  analysis disposed of those cases and, in so doing, these decisions complied\r\n  with the First Amendmentâ€™s command that â€œcivil courtsâ€¦decide church property\r\n  disputes without resolving underlying controversies over religious doctrine.â€[10]Â  Serbian Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 710 (1976) quoting Presbyterian Church v. Hull Church, 393 U.S. 440, 449 (1969).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  deference approach, which the Supreme Court of the United States never\r\n  explicitly held was the only constitutional method of adjudicating church\r\n  disputes, is rigid in its application and does not give efficacy to the neutral,\r\n  civil legal documents and principles with which religious congregations and\r\n  denominations often organize their affairs.Â  Thus, throughout the country,\r\n  other approaches to the resolution of church disputes have slowly\r\n  developed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1979, the Supreme Court of the United States expressly approved the use of a\r\n  second method of resolving church disputes.Â  In Jones v. Wolf, the\r\n  Supreme Court affirmed a Georgia courtâ€™s use of the neutral principles of law\r\n  approach to resolve church disputes.Â  443 U.S. at 603 (holding that a state is\r\n  constitutionally entitled to adopt the neutral principles of law approach as a\r\n  means of adjudicating church disputes).Â  This method â€œrelies exclusively on\r\n  objective, well-established concepts of trust and property law familiar to\r\n  lawyers and judges.Â  It thereby promises to free civil courts completely from\r\n  entanglement in questions of religious doctrine, polity, and practice.â€Â  Id. at 603.Â  Church disputes that are resolved under the neutral principles of law\r\n  approach do not turn on the single question of whether a church is\r\n  congregational or hierarchical.Â  Rather, the neutral principles of law approach\r\n  permits the application of property, corporate, and other forms of law to\r\n  church disputes.Â  \r\nA\r\n  clear recitation of the neutral principles of law approach as adopted by this\r\n  Court was enunciated in Pearson v. Church of God.Â  In Pearson, we\r\n  articulated the rule that South Carolina civil courts must follow when\r\n  adjudicating church dispute cases.Â  We reaffirm and more fully explain this\r\n  rule here.Â  The Pearson rule provides: \r\n\r\n  (1)\r\n    Courts may not engage in resolving disputes as to religious law, principle,\r\n    doctrine, discipline, custom, or administration; (2) courts cannot avoid\r\n    adjudicating rights growing out of civil law; (3) in resolving such civil law\r\n    disputes, courts must accept as final and binding the decision of the highest\r\n    religious judicatories as to religious law, principle, doctrine, discipline,\r\n    custom, and administration.Â  \r\n\r\n325 S.C. at 53, 478 S.E.2d at\r\n  854.Â  \r\nThe Pearson rule establishes that where a civil court can completely resolve a church\r\n  dispute on neutral principles of law, the First Amendment commands it to do\r\n  so.Â  Nonetheless, where a civil court is presented an issue which is a question\r\n  of religious law or doctrine masquerading as a dispute over church property or\r\n  corporate control, it must defer to the decisions of the proper church\r\n  judicatories in so far as it concerns religious or doctrinal issues.Â  See Serbian\r\n    Eastern Orthodox Diocese, 426 U.S. at 709 (finding that the\r\n  controversy before the Court â€œessentially involve[d] not a church property\r\n  dispute, but a religious dispute the resolution of whichâ€¦is for ecclesiastical\r\n  and not civil tribunals.â€). Â Â \r\nIt\r\n  is with the Pearson rule in mind that we now turn to the two issues\r\n  before us in this appeal. Â We remain mindful of the First Amendment and its protections\r\n  of religious liberty. Â Nonetheless, adjudication of this matter does not\r\n  require us to wade into the waters of religious law, doctrine, or polity.Â  Â Â We\r\n  find that the Diocese and ECUSA organized their affairs with All Saints Parish\r\n  in a manner that makes the complete resolution of the questions presented achievable\r\n  through the application of neutral principles of property, trust, and corporate\r\n  law. \r\nI. Property Ownership\r\nTurning\r\n  to the 2000 Action, the trial court held that the trust created by the 1745\r\n  Trust Deed remained valid and that legal title is held by the unknown heirs of\r\n  George Pawley and William Poole while the beneficial title is held by the â€œInhabitants\r\n  of Waccamaw Neck.â€Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  upon an application of the relevant neutral principles of law, we hold that the\r\n  trial court erred in determining that the trust created by the 1745 Trust Deed\r\n  remains valid.Â  Further, we hold that this trust was executed by the Statute of\r\n  Uses and that title to the property is held by the congregational corporate\r\n  entity - All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Statute of Uses\r\nIt\r\n  is well established that â€œwhere there is a conveyance to one for the use of\r\n  another, and the trustee is charged with no duty which renders it necessary\r\n  that the legal estate should remain in him to enable him properly to perform\r\n  such duty, the Statute of Uses executes the use and carries the legal title to\r\n  the [beneficial] use.â€Â  Faber v. Police, 10 S.C. 376, 389-90 (1877).[11]Â Â  Further, in a trust where the trustees have no duties,\r\n  â€œthe legal and equitable titles are merged in the beneficiaries and the\r\n  beneficial use is converted into legal ownership.â€Â  Johnson v. Thornton,\r\n  264 S.C. 252, 257, 214 S.E.2d 124, 127 (1975).Â  Nonetheless, the Statute of\r\n  Uses will not operate to execute a trust where there is no beneficiary capable\r\n  of taking legal title.Â  See Bowen v. Humphreys, 24 S.C. 452, 455 (1886)\r\n  (holding that the Statute of Uses cannot execute a trust where there is no\r\n  identifiable beneficiary capable of holding title).Â  \r\nTherefore, there are two questions that must be asked in order to\r\n  determine if the trust created by the 1745 Trust Deed was executed by the\r\n  Statute of Uses: (1) whether the trustees had any duties relative to their\r\n  office, and (2) whether there is a beneficiary capable of taking title.Â  We\r\n  hold that the trustees of this trust did not have any duties relative to their\r\n  office and that the congregation of All Saints Parish was the intended\r\n  beneficiary and, upon its formation, was clearly capable of taking title.Â  \r\n1. Trusteesâ€™ Duties\r\nWe\r\n  hold that the 1745 Trust Deed did not impose any duties upon the trustees,\r\n  George Pawley and William Poole.Â  Pawley and Poole were colonial appointees\r\n  given the authority to accept conveyances of land for the purpose of establishing\r\n  parishes.Â  When named trustees to the 1745 Trust Deed, they were acting as\r\n  appointees of the colony, not as trustees with traditional duties.Â  This\r\n  conclusion is supported by the relevant legal realities of that time.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals in All Saints correctly stated that â€œin colonial times,\r\n  churches could not be recognized by the government until they owned property,\r\n  and they could not own property until they had been officially recognized.â€Â  All\r\n    Saints, 358 S.C. at 225, 595 S.E.2d at 262.Â  â€œAs such, a colonial practice\r\n  arose in which a settlor placed property in trust for a congregation until such\r\n  a time as the government recognized the church.â€Â  Id. (citing Town of\r\n    Pawlett, 9 U.S. (Cranch) at 330 (holding â€œno parish churchâ€¦could\r\n  have legal existence until consecration and consecration was expressly\r\n  inhibited unless a suitable endowment of land.â€)).Â  Pawley and Poole did not have any duties relative to the trust, but simply acted as custodians of the\r\n  property at issue until All Saints Parish was officially established.Â  This\r\n  conclusion is supported by language of the 1745 Trust Deed which did not\r\n  expressly impose any duties upon them, nor is there any evidence in the record\r\n  which suggests that either of the trustees performed any acts relative to their\r\n  office as trustee. \r\nFurther,\r\n  Percival and Ann Pawley were not traditional settlors of a trust.Â  Rather, they\r\n  sold the property at a price far above nominal value.Â  They were clearly\r\n  sellers of property to colonially appointed commissioners for the establishment\r\n  of a parish, purposes specified by the colonial government.\r\n2. Beneficiary Capable of\r\n  Taking Title\r\nHolding\r\n  that the trustees to the 1745 Trust Deed had no duties, we now analyze whether\r\n  there was a beneficiary capable of taking title.Â  According to the terms of the\r\n  1745 Trust Deed, the beneficiaries were â€œthe Inhabitants of Waccamaw Neck.â€Â  This\r\n  term is ambiguous and parol evidence should be used to ascertain its meaning. Â See Shelley v Shelley, 244 S.C. 598, 606, 137 S.E.2d 851, 855\r\n  (1964)(holding that parol evidence is admissible so long as its admission is\r\n  merely intended to explain and apply what the settlor has written). Â Â \r\nBased\r\n  on the following application of parol evidence, we hold that the term\r\n  â€œInhabitants of Waccamaw Neckâ€ was used by the settlors of the trust as an\r\n  expression referring to the yet-to-be-created All Saints Parish.Â  Early South Carolina colonial statutes used the term â€œinhabitantsâ€ when referring to the colonyâ€™s\r\n  parishes.Â  For instance, The Church Act of 1706 contains multiple uses of the\r\n  term â€œinhabitantsâ€ referring to parishes.Â  SeeÂ  Act No. 256 at Â§Â§ 7, 10,\r\n  12, 13, 19, 21, 22, 29, 30, 35, 2 S.C. Stat. 284-89 (1706).Â  Additionally, this\r\n  understanding of the term is supported by the historical context in which the\r\n  1745 Trust Deed was executed.Â  In 1745, the inhabitants of Waccamaw Neck were\r\n  parishioners of Prince Georgeâ€™s Parish.Â  They were clamoring for the\r\n  establishment of their own Parish congregation and had already been worshipping\r\n  on the land at issue for approximately eight years. Â It was within this\r\n  historical context that the 1745 Trust Deed was executed in expectation that\r\n  the subject property would be for the benefit of the yet-to-be formed All\r\n  Saints Parish.Â  Â \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  according to the express terms of the original Church Act of 1706, a colonial Parish\r\n  could hold title to land.Â  The Act specifically empowered commissioners â€œto\r\n  take up by grant from the Lords Proprietors, or purchase the same for them, or\r\n  any other person, and have, taken and receive so much land as they think\r\n  necessary for the several sites of the several churches.â€Â  Act No. 256 at Â§ 8,\r\n  2 S.C. Stat. 284.Â  Thus, when the Church Act of 1767 formed All Saints Parish,\r\n  the Statute of Uses operated to execute the trust created by the 1745 Trust\r\n  Deed and title vested in the intended beneficiary, the congregation of All\r\n  Saints Parish.Â  \r\nB. 1903 Quit-Claim Deed\r\nMoreover,\r\n  the 1903 Quit-Claim Deed makes clear that All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.\r\n  holds title to its property.Â  The All Saints Parish congregation was officially\r\n  incorporated in 1820.Â  In 1902, due to doubt over the status of the\r\n  congregationâ€™s incorporation, the Diocese directed it to re-incorporate as â€œAll\r\n  Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.â€Â  Shortly thereafter, in order to settle any\r\n  doubt as to the status of title to Parish property, the Diocese voluntarily\r\n  executed the 1903 Quit-Claim deed. The 1903 Quit-Claim Deed makes clear that\r\n  title to the property at issue is currently held by the congregationâ€™s\r\n  corporate entity - All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.Â Â Â Â  \r\nC. 2000 Notice and Dennis\r\n  Canon\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we hold that neither the 2000 Notice nor the Dennis Canon has any legal effect\r\n  on title to the All Saints congregationâ€™s property.Â  A trust â€œmay be created by\r\n  either declaration of trust or by transfer of propertyâ€¦.â€Â  Dreher v. Dreher,\r\n  370 S.C. 75, 80, 634 S.E.2d 646, 648 (2006).Â  It is an axiomatic principle of\r\n  law that a person or entity must hold title to property in order to declare\r\n  that it is held in trust for the benefit of another or transfer legal title to\r\n  one person for the benefit of another.Â  The Diocese did not, at the time it\r\n  recorded the 2000 Notice, have any interest in the congregationâ€™s property.Â \r\n  Therefore, the recordation of the 2000 Notice could not have created a trust\r\n  over the property.\r\nFor\r\n  the aforementioned reasons, we hold that title to the property at issue is held\r\n  by All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc., the Dennis Canons had no legal effect on\r\n  the title to the congregationâ€™s property, and the 2000 Notice should be removed\r\n  from the Georgetown County records.\r\nII. Corporate Control\r\nTurning\r\n  to the 2005 Action, we find that the trial court applied the deference\r\n  approach, determined that the congregation was part of a hierarchical\r\n  organization, and deferred to the Dioceseâ€™s ecclesiastical authorityâ€™s determination\r\n  that members of the minority vestry were the true officers of All Saints\r\n  Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile\r\n  it is true that â€œ[c]ourts may not engage in resolving disputes as to religious\r\n  law, principle, doctrine, discipline, custom, or administration,â€ Pearson,\r\n  325 S.C. at 53, 478 S.E.2d at 854, the resolution of the 2005 Action does not\r\n  require such judicial meddling.Â  The 2005 case turns on a determination of\r\n  whether the Articles of Amendment approved by the members of All Saints\r\n  Waccamaw, Inc. on January 8, 2004 were adopted in compliance with the South\r\n  Carolina Non-Profit Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-1001, et. seq.Â  We\r\n  find that the Articles of Amendment were lawfully adopted and effectively\r\n  severed the corporationâ€™s legal ties to the ECUSA and the Diocese.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find that the members of the majority vestry are the true officers of All\r\n  Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc.Â  \r\nPursuant\r\n  to the South Carolina Non-Profit Act, a religious corporation may amend its\r\n  Articles of Incorporation to add or change a provision permitted in the\r\n  articles or delete a provision not required in the articles. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  33-31-1001.Â  Amendment to a corporationâ€™s articles, to be adopted, must be\r\n  approved by (1) the board of directors, (2) the members â€œby two-thirds of the\r\n  votes cast or a majority of the voting power, whichever is less,â€ and (3) any\r\n  person whose approval is required by the Articles of Incorporation.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 33-31-1003(a)(1-3).Â  The passage of the Articles of Amendment approved\r\n  by the congregation on January 8, 2004 complied with all three of these\r\n  requirements.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  the Articles of Amendment were approved by the board of directors.Â  On December\r\n  8, 2003, while still in good standing with the Diocese, the majority vestry,\r\n  acting as the corporationâ€™s board of directors, approved the Articles of\r\n  Amendment at issue here.Â  Thus, the passage of the Articles of Amendment met\r\n  the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-1003(a)(1).\r\nSecond,\r\n  the Articles of Amendment were approved by the members of All Saints Parish,\r\n  Waccamaw, Inc. by two-thirds of the votes cast.Â  Five hundred and seven members\r\n  of All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc. were present at the January 8, 2004\r\n  meeting which was called to discuss and vote upon the Articles of Amendment.Â \r\n  Of the five hundred and seven members present, four hundred and sixty-four\r\n  votes were cast in favor of amending the Articles of Incorporation.Â  Therefore,\r\n  more than nine-tenths of the votes cast were in favor of the amendments,\r\n  clearly more than the two-thirds statutorily required.Â  There is no evidence in\r\n  the record to suggest that the members present and voting were not in good standing\r\n  at the time of the vote.Â  Thus, the passage of the Articles of Amendment\r\n  clearly met the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-1003(a)(2).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  nothing in the All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc. by-laws or the Constitutions\r\n  and Canons of the ECUSA or Diocese requires third-party approval for amendments\r\n  to the congregationâ€™s corporate charter, therefore the congregationâ€™s adoption\r\n  of the Articles of Amendment complied with the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  33-31-1003(a)(3).Â  The statutory provisions pertaining to a religious\r\n  corporationâ€™s amendment of its corporate charter were amended in 1994 so as to\r\n  add the option of third-party approval.Â  See 1994 S.C. Acts 384.Â  There\r\n  is no evidence in the record that, since that time, the Diocese has ever\r\n  attempted to gain approval power over amendments to the All Saints Parish,\r\n  Waccamaw, Inc. corporate charter.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  facts presented by this case demonstrate that the congregation, in compliance\r\n  with relevant statutory provisions and applicable bylaws, passed the Articles\r\n  of Amendment, thus removing any reference to the ECUSA and Diocese and\r\n  explicitly severing any legal relationship with those organizations.Â \r\n  Therefore, through the application of neutral principles of law, it is clear to\r\n  us that the true officers of All Saints Parish, Waccamaw, Inc. are the members\r\n  of the majority vestry.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision with respect to both the 2000\r\n  Action and the 2005 Action.\r\nWALLER, BEATTY,\r\n  JJ., Acting Justice James E. Moore and Acting Justice Perry M. Buckner, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Waccamaw Neck is a geographical area bounded by the Waccamaw River and Winyah Bay on the west and south, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the North Carolina line in the north.\r\n[2] According to the â€œAverage Earnings Index,â€ one hundred (100) British Pounds in\r\n  1745 was worth One Hundred Forty-One Thousand, Eight Hundred Twenty-Five\r\n  (141,825) British Pounds or Two Hundred Seventy-Seven Thousand, Seven Hundred\r\n  and Seventy-Eight (277,778) U.S. Dollars in 2007. \r\n[3] At the time, Charleston was the only place in South Carolina at which land instruments could be recorded.Â  \r\n[4] Presumably, the Dennis Canon was enacted in reaction to the Supreme Court of\r\n  the United Statesâ€™s opinion in Jones v.

Â The South Carolina Department\r\n  of Revenue (the Department) appealed.Â  \r\nWe reversed the decision of\r\n  the circuit court in SCANA Corporation and Subsidiaries v. South Carolina\r\n    Department of Revenue, Op. No. 26511 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 30, 2008)\r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 27 at 34).Â  Subsequently, we granted SCANAâ€™s petition\r\n  for rehearing and withdrew our former opinion. Â We now substitute this opinion\r\n  affirming the ruling of the circuit court.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe facts relevant to this\r\n  appeal are uncontested by the parties.Â  SCANA earned the investment tax credit\r\n  at issue pursuant to the Economic Impact Zone Community Development Act of 1995\r\n  (The Act).Â  1995 S.C. Acts 138.Â  The Act is codified as S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-14-60.Â  In pertinent part, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60 states:\r\n\r\n  (A)(1)\r\n    There is allowed an economic impact zone investment tax credit against the tax\r\n    imposed pursuant to Chapter 6 of this title for any taxable year in which the\r\n    taxpayer places in service economic impact zone qualified manufacturing and\r\n    productive equipment.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-14-60(A)(1).\r\nIn 1996, SCANA placed in\r\n  service certain qualifying equipment that earned it an Economic Impact Zone tax\r\n  credit (EIZ credit) in the amount of $29,575,619.Â  This EIZ credit far exceeded\r\n  SCANAâ€™s tax liability for the 1996 tax year leaving $15,323,257 of the EIZ\r\n  credit unused.\r\nOriginally, there was no\r\n  provision in the Act which provided that the EIZ credit could be carried forward\r\n  to subsequent tax years.Â  Nonetheless, in 1997, the General Assembly enacted a\r\n  carry-forward provision applicable to EIZ credits.Â  1997 S.C. Acts 151 Â§ 8.Â \r\n  This provision, which is codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60(D), states that\r\n  â€œ[u]nused [EIZ] creditâ€¦may be carried forward for ten years from the close of\r\n  the tax year in which the credit was earned.â€Â  The General Assembly provided\r\n  that the carry-forward provision â€œis effective for tax years beginning after\r\n  1996.â€Â  1997 S.C. Acts 151 Â§ 14.Â Â Â  \r\nSCANA applied the unused EIZ\r\n  credit earned in 1996 to its 1997 and 1998 tax liability pursuant to S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-14-60(D).Â  However, the Department denied SCANAâ€™s carry-forward\r\n  application of its EIZ credit because it was not earned in a tax year after\r\n  1996.Â  \r\nSCANA appealed to the\r\n  Administrative Law Court (ALC).Â  The ALC agreed with the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  interpretation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60(D) and found that the carry-forward\r\n  credit was properly denied because the EIZ credit was not earned in a tax year\r\n  beginning after 1996.Â  SCANA appealed to the circuit court, which reversed and\r\n  held that the EIZ credit earned but not used by SCANA in 1996 may be applied to\r\n  its tax liability for 1997 and 1998.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  May EIZ\r\n    credit earned but not applied in 1996 be carried forward to offset tax\r\n    liability in 1997 and 1998 pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60(D)?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues that S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60 is ambiguous and the circuit court erred in construing the\r\n  statute to allow SCANA to carry-forward the EIZ credit it earned, but was\r\n  unable to use, in 1996.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe find that the language of\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60(D) and its corresponding effective date are\r\n  unambiguous. Â â€œ[W]here a statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and\r\n  conveys a clear and definite meaningâ€¦the court has no right to impose another\r\n  meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 375, 377\r\n  (1994).Â  Thus, the only proposition that is needed to resolve the instant case\r\n  is this: in the 1997 and 1998 tax years, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60(D) allowed\r\n  unused EIZ credit to be carried forward beyond the close of the tax year in\r\n  which the credit was earned.Â  \r\n\r\n  As\r\n    enacted in 1997, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60(D) provided:\r\n  Unused\r\n    credit allowed pursuant to this section may be carried forward for ten years\r\n    from the close of the tax year in which the credit was earned.\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n    12-14-60(D).Â  This provision was â€œeffective for tax years beginning after\r\n    1996.â€ Â 1997 S.C. Acts 151 Â§ 14.\r\n\r\nSCANA earned the EIZ credit\r\n  at issue in 1996 but was not able to take full advantage of it in the 1996 tax\r\n  year.Â  When SCANA prepared its tax information for the 1997 and 1998 tax years,\r\n  the statutory law in effect provided that unused EIZ credit could be carried\r\n  forward â€œten years from the close of the tax year in which the credit was\r\n  earned.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60(D).Â  That SCANA was justified in claiming\r\n  the unused portion of its previously earned credit seems to follow rather\r\n  directly from a straight-forward application of the statute and its effective\r\n  date.Â  Thus, we discern no reasonable ambiguity here and hold that the\r\n  straight-forward application of the statutory law at issue provides that SCANA\r\n  may carry forward the EIZ credit it earned in 1996 to offset its tax liability\r\n  for 1997 and 1998.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  affirm the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWALLER, PLEICONES and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. BEATTY, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Because there are clearly divergent interpretations of\r\n  section 12-14-60(D), I find the effective date language of the carry-forward\r\n  provision is ambiguous and should be construed against SCANA.Â  Accordingly, I\r\n  would reverse the decision of the circuit court.\r\nIn view of the ambiguity, I\r\n  believe an application of the rules of statutory construction is necessary to analyze\r\n  the issue presented in this case.&nbsp; See Kennedy v. S.C. Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 348,\r\n  549 S.E.2d 243, 247 (2001) (â€œTherefore,\r\n  since the plain language of the statute lends itself to two equally logical\r\n  interpretations, this Court must apply the rules of statutory interpretation to\r\n  resolve the ambiguity and to discover the intent of the General Assembly. Â Where\r\n  the language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative\r\n  intent, the construing court may search for that intent beyond the borders of\r\n  the act itself.â€).\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain\r\n  and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Â Hodges v. Rainey, 341\r\n  S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  â€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient to\r\n  the one that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably\r\n  discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in light\r\n  of the intended purpose of the statute.â€ Â Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach\r\n    Election Commâ€™n, 342 S.C. 373, 380, 537 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â  The Court\r\n  should give words their plain and ordinary meaning, without resort to subtle or\r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation. Â Sloan v.\r\n    S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452, 469, 636 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  607 (2006). \r\nGuided by these well-established rules of\r\n  statutory construction, I would find the Legislature did not intend for unused\r\n  credit in 1996 to be carried forward to apply to 1997 tax liability.Â  \r\nThe quintessential rule of\r\n  statutory construction is to identify the intent of the Legislature in\r\n  promulgating a specific statute.Â  In order to do so in the instant case, it is\r\n  instructive to delve into the evolution of section 12-14-60(D).Â  See Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 402, 175 S.E.2d 805, 817 (1970)\r\n  (noting that in determining the legislative intent, the Court may properly look\r\n  at the legislative history of the\r\n  statute).\r\nThe EIZ credit was first\r\n  enacted in 1995.Â  The provision in question was created by Act No. 151 on June\r\n  24, 1997.Â  Act No. 151, 1997 S.C. Acts 825.Â  This amendment specifies that the\r\n  carry-forward provision is â€œeffective for tax years beginning after 1996.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-14-60(D) (Supp. 1997) (emphasis added).Â  In\r\n  view of this language, I believe the Legislature intended for the amendment to\r\n  apply to the tax year of 1997 and subsequent tax years.Â  \r\nBefore the effective date of\r\n  Act No. 151 in 1997, a carry-forward provision did not exist.Â  Inferentially, any\r\n  unused tax credits in 1996 â€œexpiredâ€ at the end of the 1996 tax year.[2]Â \r\n  Because the carry-forward provision was not enacted until after the expiration\r\n  of the 1996 tax credit at issue, I would find that it could not logically be\r\n  carried forward to apply to 1997 tax liability.Â  In other words, prior to 1997\r\n  there was no â€œunused credit.â€Â  Instead, credit was limited to the extent of the\r\n  tax liability for the year in which the credit accrued.Â  Thus, once the credit\r\n  was applied to the yearâ€™s tax liability, any remaining credit expired or\r\n  essentially ceased being in existence.\r\nAlthough the above analysis\r\n  focuses solely on the provision of Act No. 151 that specifically applies to\r\n  section 12-14-60(D), a review of the entire Act is essential and lends support\r\n  to the conclusion that the 1996 unused tax credit could not be applied in 1997. Cf. Foothills Brewing Concern, Inc. v. City of Greenville, 377\r\n  S.C. 355, 363, 660 S.E.2d 264, 268 (2008) (stating\r\n  â€œ[a] statute should not be construed by concentrating on an isolated phraseâ€).\r\nThis Act contains thirteen separate\r\n  legislative provisions.Â  Notably, several of these provisions contain different\r\n  effective dates which include retroactive dates.Â  For example, Section 1, which\r\n  applies to county sales and use tax, is effective â€œfor sales or use made on or\r\n  after December 1, 1992.â€Â  Act No. 151, 1997 S.C. Acts 819.Â  I believe the\r\n  retroactivity of Section 1 is of significant import given the entire Act No.\r\n  151 containing this section was approved on June 24, 1997.\r\nIn light of the\r\n  above-outlined legislative history, I believe the Legislature had it intended\r\n  would have expressly provided for tax credits earned prior to 1996 to be\r\n  carried forward.Â  To find otherwise would be contrary to the intent of the Legislature\r\n  given the other retroactive provisions in Act No. 151.Â  See Hercules,\r\n    Inc. v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 274 S.C. 137, 143, 262 S.E.2d 45, 48 (1980) (â€œIn the construction of statutes, there is a presumption\r\n  that statutory enactments are to be considered prospective rather than\r\n  retroactive in their operation unless there is a specific provision or clear\r\n  legislative intent to the contrary.â€).\r\nFinally, in cases involving a tax deduction,\r\n  any ambiguity is resolved against the taxpayer.[3] Â M. Lowenstein &amp; Sons, Inc. v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 277 S.C. 561, 290\r\n  S.E.2d 812 (1982); Davis Mech. Contractors, Inc. v. Wasson, 268 S.C. 26,\r\n  231 S.E.2d 300 (1977); C.W. Matthews Contracting Co. v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n,\r\n  267 S.C. 548, 230 S.E.2d 223 (1976); S. Soya Corp. v. Wasson, 252 S.C.\r\n  484, 167 S.E.2d 311 (1969).Â  Moreover, I would note that the allowance of a tax\r\n  credit is analogous to a tax deduction since both are a matter of legislative\r\n  grace.[4] Â \r\nBased on the foregoing, I would resolve the\r\n  ambiguity here against the taxpayer and find the Department properly disallowed\r\n  the carry-forward credit for EIZ credit earned in 1996.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We note that, due to the retirement of Justice James E. Moore and the untimely\r\n  passing of Acting Justice James W. Johnson, Jr., the panel on rehearing\r\n  consists of two members who were not part of the original panel.Â  \r\n[2]Â  SCANA conceded this point at oral argument.\r\n[3]Â  This is\r\n  contrary to the general rule that where substantial doubt exists as to the\r\n  construction of tax statutes, the doubt must be resolved against the\r\n  government.&nbsp; See S.C. Natâ€™l Bank v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 297\r\n  S.C. 279, 376 S.E.2d 512 (1989) (noting taxpayer should receive the benefit in\r\n  cases of doubt); Cooper River Bridge, Inc. v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 182 S.C.\r\n  72, 188 S.E. 508 (1936) (same); Columbia Ry., Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Carter,\r\n  127 S.C. 473, 121 S.E. 377 (1924) (same); State v. Charron, 351 S.C.\r\n  319, 569 S.E.2d 388 (Ct. App. 2002) (same (quoting Columbia Ry., Gas\r\n    &amp; Elec. Co.)).&nbsp;\r\n[4]Â  I note the\r\n  rule of construction in other jurisdictions is that because a tax credit is a\r\n  matter of grace, it is strictly construed against the taxpayer.&nbsp; See,\r\n    e.g., Texasgulf, Inc. v. Commâ€™r of Internal Revenue, 172 F.3d 209\r\n  (2d Cir. 1999); Team Specialty Prods., Inc. v. N.M. Taxation &amp; Revenue\r\n    Depâ€™t, 107 P.3d 4 (N.M. Ct. App. 2004); MacFarlane v.

Did the trial judge err in denying\r\n    Andersonâ€™s and Texacoâ€™s motions for a directed verdict/judgment non obstante\r\n      veredicto because Jamison did not present any evidence of actual agency to\r\n    support the vicarious liability verdicts?\r\n  2. Did the trial judge err in denying\r\n    Mini Martâ€™s motion for a directed verdict because there was no evidence of a\r\n    sale of alcohol?\r\n  3. Did the trial judge err in failing\r\n    to dismiss appellant John Morris from the suit?\r\n  4. Did the trial judge commit error\r\n    in ruling that Dr. Craneâ€™s expert testimony was admissible thus requiring a new\r\n    trial for Mini Mart?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Directed verdict/JNOV\r\nAnderson and Texaco each\r\n  argue entitlement to a directed verdict or a JNOV contending there was no\r\n  evidence that either entity had the right to control Mini Martâ€™s alcohol sales,\r\n  Mini Mart was therefore not their agent, and thus neither could be vicariously\r\n  liable.Â  The trial judge directed a verdict on Jamisonâ€™s apparent agency\r\n  claims, and submitted the case against Texaco and Anderson to the jury solely\r\n  on the theory of actual agency. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Under South Carolina law:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    decisive test in determining whether the relation of master and servant exists\r\n    is whether the purported master has the right or power to direct and control\r\n    the servant in the performance of his work and in the manner in which the work\r\n    is to be done.Â  Keitz v. National Paving Co., 214 Md. 479, 134 A.2d 296\r\n    (1957); see Fernander v. Thigpen, 278 S.C. 140, 144, 293 S.E.2d\r\n    424, 426 (1982) (â€œThe test to determine agency is whether or not the purported\r\n    principal has the right to control the conduct of his alleged agent.â€)\r\n    (Emphasis theirs); Young v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, 189, 165 S.E.2d 797, 802\r\n    (1969) (â€œThe general test applied isâ€¦whether there exists the right and\r\n    authority to control and direct the particular work or undertaking, as to the\r\n    manner or means of its accomplishment.â€); DeBerry v. Coker Freight Lines,\r\n    234 S.C. 304, 307-08, 108 S.E.2d 114, 116 (1959) (â€œThe right or power of\r\n    control retained by the person for whom the work is being done is uniformly\r\n    regarded as the essential criterion for determining whether the workman is an\r\n    employeeâ€¦.â€).\r\n  Watkins\r\n    v. Mobil Oil Corp., 291 S.C. 62,\r\n    65-66, 352 S.E.2d 284, 286 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n\r\nIn Watkins, a customer\r\n  sued Mobil after he was assaulted by the gas stationâ€™s assistant manager when\r\n  the customer entered the station to purchase cigarettes.Â  The station was\r\n  operated by a franchisee, which controlled the stationâ€™s operations, its\r\n  employees, and its premises.Â  The Court of Appeals held there was no evidence\r\n  that Mobil, the franchisor, had the right to control the conduct of the\r\n  business even though the employees wore Mobil uniforms and the station was\r\n  Mobil-branded. \r\nThe key question here is\r\n  whether Texaco and/or Anderson, as the jobber, has the right or power to direct\r\n  the manner or means of the purported agentâ€™s work, that is, to control Mini\r\n  Mart â€œin the performance of Â [its] work and the manner in which the work\r\n  is to be done.â€Â  Id.; see also Young v. Warr, 252 S.C.\r\n  179, 165 S.E.2d 797 (1969).\r\nIn an actual agency case, the\r\n  question is not whether the purported principal could have exercised control\r\n  over its agent, but whether it did so.Â  Compare Glover v. Boy Scouts\r\n    of America, 923 P.2d 1383 (Utah 1996) (right to control must rest on facts\r\n  as they exist, not speculation if different policies had been followed). [3]Â \r\n  We begin by looking at the three documents which govern the partiesâ€™\r\n  relationships: the Wholesaler Marketing Agreement between Motiva and Anderson,\r\n  Texacoâ€™s Brand Standards, and a Mystery Shopper Program which checks on Mini\r\n  Martâ€™s compliance with Texacoâ€™s Brand Standards.Â  Nothing in the agreement or\r\n  the Standards creates, on its face, an agency-principal relationship here.\r\nA franchisor is not the\r\n  principal of a branded gas station franchisee for purposes of all tort\r\n  liability.Â  Watkins, supra.Â  Moreover, a franchisor is not\r\n  vicariously liable for a tort committed at an independent gas station unless\r\n  the plaintiff can show that the franchisor exercised more control over the\r\n  franchisee than that necessary to ensure uniformity of appearance and quality\r\n  of services among its franchisees.Â  E.g., Kennedy v. Western Sizzler\r\n    Corp., 857 So.2d 71 (Ala. 2003); Vandemark v. McDonaldâ€™s Corp.Â  904\r\n  A.2d 627 (N.H. 2006); Ciup v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 928 P.2d 263 (N.M.\r\n  1996); Pate v. Alian, 49 P.3d 85 (Ok. Ct. App. 2002).\r\nTexaco and Anderson contend\r\n  that the Brand Standards are designed only to preserve Texacoâ€™s trademark and\r\n  its goodwill.Â  Jamison argues, however, that Texacoâ€™s requirements regarding\r\n  employee appearance[4] and courtesy[5] are indicative of control over employees.Â  Compare, e.g., Sipple v.\r\n    Starr, 520 S.E.2d 884 (W.Va. 1999) (jobber vicariously liable where he\r\n  ordered owner to clean the store, redecorate, obtain a liquor license, and to\r\n  fire an employee for having bad teeth); Wood v. McDonaldâ€™s, 603 S.E.2d\r\n  539 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004) (management company of franchisee liable where it\r\n  hired, fired, and supervised personnel and controlled operations on a daily\r\n  basis).\r\nIn addition to relying on the\r\n  Brand Standards requirements for employees as proof of control beyond that\r\n  ordinarily imposed by a franchisor, Jamison points to the Standardsâ€™\r\n  requirements where a Texaco-branded station opts to sell merchandise.Â  In such\r\n  cases, the Standards require certain displays and hours of operation,[6] signage,[7] and that cleanliness and hygiene standards be maintained.[8]Â  \r\nWe find nothing in these\r\n  requirements which supports a finding that Texaco or Anderson exercised control\r\n  over the sale of food, beverages, or general merchandise by Mini Mart.Â  As the\r\n  parties acknowledge, Texaco did not require Mini Mart to sell alcoholic\r\n  beverages, compare Sipple, supra, nor did Texaco or\r\n  Anderson exercise any control over Mini Martâ€™s decision to hire or fire employees.Â  Compare Wood, supra. Â Neither Texaco nor Anderson offered Mini\r\n  Mart any training material with regard to these types of sales.Â  Rather, Mini\r\n  Mart used training materials and seminars produced by the National Association\r\n  of Convenience Stores in training its employees in the responsible sale of\r\n  alcoholic beverages.\r\nAs noted above, Jamison\r\n  argues we should find indicia of control over and above the typical\r\n  franchisor-franchisee relationship in the use of the Mystery Shopper Program,\r\n  and the fact that Mini Mart, like all Texaco-branded stations, was required to\r\n  display a Texaco customer service number.Â  Under the Mystery Shopper Program,\r\n  branded stations were visited twice a year by an anonymous individual who\r\n  purchased only gasoline and checked the premises for compliance with the Brand\r\n  Standards in sixty-nine designated areas.[9]Â \r\n  In our view, nothing in the Mystery Shopper Program exceeded the scope of the\r\n  ordinary franchisor-franchisee relationship.Â  See, e.g., Schlotzkyâ€™s,\r\n    Inc. v. Hyde, 538 S.E.2d 561 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003) (franchisorâ€™s right to\r\n  inspect or evaluate franchiseeâ€™s compliance with standards and to debrand for\r\n  noncompliance is not evidence of day-to-day control).Â  Neither Texacoâ€™s\r\n  requirement that Mini Mart participate in this program, nor Andersonâ€™s role as\r\n  â€œenforcer,â€ that is, the party responsible for informing Mini Mart of areas\r\n  where the shopper found problems, is evidence of actual authority over Mini\r\n  Martâ€™s retail operation, particularly its sale of alcoholic beverages for off-premises\r\n  consumption.Â  Moreover, the required posting of the Texaco 800 number is in\r\n  keeping with Texacoâ€™s desire to maintain consistency among its\r\n  franchisees, and not indicative of Texacoâ€™s control over Mini Martâ€™s daily\r\n  operations.\r\nFinally, Jamison contends that\r\n  because Mini Mart expended approximately $190,000 to bring its station into\r\n  compliance with Texaco standards in order to retain the right to sell Texaco\r\n  gasoline, Texaco exercised control sufficient to submit the issue of actual\r\n  agency to the jury.Â  In our view, this business decision by Mini Mart does not\r\n  create an actual agency-principal relationship vis-Ã -vis alcoholic beverage\r\n  sales.\r\nWe hold the trial judge erred\r\n  in submitting the issue of Texacoâ€™s and/or Andersonâ€™s vicarious liability to\r\n  the jury.Â  We find no evidence to support a finding that either entity had the\r\n  right or power to control Mini Mart in the performance of its retail alcoholic\r\n  beverage sales or in the manner in which that work was done, and therefore\r\n  reverse the verdicts against Texaco and Anderson, holding each was entitled\r\n  to a directed verdict.Â  Watkins, supra; see also Allen\r\n    v. Greenville Hotel Partners, Inc., 409 F. Supp. 2d 672 (D.S.C. 2006)\r\n  (applying South Carolina law, court granted franchisor summary judgment finding\r\n  through its agreement and brand standards franchisor was merely maintaining\r\n  uniform standards and goodwill throughout the franchisorâ€™s system).\r\nThe\r\n  remaining three issues are raised on appeal by Mini Mart.\r\n2.Â  Directed verdict\r\nMini Mart contends the trial\r\n  judge erred in failing to direct a verdict in its favor because there was\r\n  insufficient evidence that it sold beer to Carlos.Â  The standard on appeal for\r\n  reviewing the denial of a directed verdict is whether there is any evidence to\r\n  support the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Watkins, supra.Â  Here, there is\r\n  testimony from Louis that the boys pooled their money, that Carlos Davis and\r\n  another young man entered the Mini Mart with that money, and that they emerged\r\n  with beer.Â  There was also testimony from a police officer that one of the\r\n  passengers in the wrecked automobile told him that the boys had purchased beer\r\n  from that convenience store.Â  The trial judge properly denied this directed\r\n  verdict motion because there was evidence that Mini Mart sold beer to the\r\n  underage boys.Â  Watkins, supra. \r\n3.Â  Dismissal of John\r\n  Morris from the suit\r\nMini Mart contends the trial\r\n  court erred in failing to direct a verdict or grant a JNOV motion for John\r\n  Morris, one of the owners of the Mini Mart.Â  This request is predicated on the\r\n  testimony of Johnâ€™s son, Kevin, that he bought out his fatherâ€™s interest in the\r\n  business in 1992, well before the alleged sale in 2000.Â  This issue was not\r\n  raised as a ground for a directed verdict during the liability stage of the\r\n  trial and is not preserved for this Courtâ€™s review.Â  E.g., In re\r\n    McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001) (only grounds raised in\r\n  directed verdict can be raised in JNOV motion).Â  Moreover, while Kevin\r\n  testified that he owned the station, he also testified that the business was\r\n  owned by his family.\r\n4.Â  New trial\r\nMini Mart contends the trial\r\n  court erred in admitting expert testimony from Dr. Crane concerning Carlos\r\n  Davisâ€™s probable level of impairment at the time of the accident because that\r\n  opinion was predicated on what the trial judge deemed an unreliable\r\n  blood alcohol level (BAL) test conducted by S.L.E.D.Â  We agree.[10]\r\nThe S.L.E.D. analysis used a\r\n  blood sample drawn at the hospital approximately one hour and fifty minutes\r\n  after the accident.Â  The sample was drawn to type blood, but the hospital did\r\n  no testing as Carlos died shortly after the sample was drawn.Â  The sample was\r\n  released to the Richland County Coronerâ€™s office on April 3, two days after the\r\n  accident.Â  It was delivered to S.L.E.D. for testing on April 4.Â  The S.L.E.D.\r\n  testing came about at the request of the officer who had investigated the\r\n  accident, after he learned from a passenger that the beer had allegedly been\r\n  illegally sold to Carlos by Mini Mart.\r\nAt trial, the trial judge\r\n  held that Jamison had not been able to prove a chain of custody â€œinsofar as was\r\n  practicable.â€ He subsequently held Dr. Crane could testify in reliance on the\r\n  result of the S.L.E.D. test, but not as to the result itself.Â  Before the jury,\r\n  Dr. Crane opined that Carlosâ€™ BAL at the time of the accident was 0.193.Â \r\n  Mini Mart contends that once the trial judge found that Jamison was unable to\r\n  present a â€œgoodâ€ chain of custody as to the blood tested by S.L.E.D., he erred\r\n  in allowing any evidence predicated on the testing of that sample.Â  We agree.\r\nIn Ex parte DHEC, 350\r\n  S.C. 243, 565 S.E.2d 293 (2002), the Court was asked whether the State could\r\n  use an individualâ€™s HIV record from testing done at DHEC, at the individualâ€™s\r\n  request, in the individualâ€™s criminal prosecution for knowingly transmitting HIV\r\n  to another person.Â  The Court held the DHEC record was admissible as a business\r\n  record under Rule 803(6), SCRE, even though there was no chain of custody.Â  The\r\n  Court held that the lack of a chain was not determinative of admissibility\r\n  because the trustworthiness of medical records is presumed and that test\r\n  results, including BAL test results, done for purposes of medical treatment are\r\n  admissible without a chain.Â  The Court emphasized the reliability of a test\r\n  done for medical purposes, but also held:\r\n\r\n  A person\r\n    charged with DUI based on a blood alcohol test taken at the time of his arrest\r\n    has no such protection and, therefore, needs the indica of reliability provided\r\n    by a chain of custody.\r\n  Ex\r\n    parte DHEC, 350 S.C. at 250-251, 565\r\n    S.E.2d at 297.\r\n\r\nHere, we have a situation\r\n  where a sample was drawn at a hospital for medical purposes but never tested.Â  Had the hospital performed Carlosâ€™ BAL test as part of its medical\r\n  treatment of him, the results would have been a part of Carlosâ€™ medical\r\n  record.Â  Under Ex parte DHEC, those results would be presumed\r\n  reliable as a business record regardless of a chain of custody.Â  The\r\n  fact that the BAL test was performed not for medical purposes necessitates that\r\n  the proponent be able to demonstrate a chain of custody insofar as\r\n  practicable in order for the results to be deemed reliable.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Without that showing, the test performed by S.L.E.D. on a sample drawn but not\r\n  tested for medical purposes, is unreliable.Â  Ex parte DHEC, supra; see also S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran 356 S.C. 413, 589\r\n  S.E.2d 753 (2008) (drug test results inadmissible where no complete chain of\r\n  custody shown); Gulledge v. McLaughlin, 328 S.C. 504, 492 S.E.2d 816 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1997) (BAL results admitted where chain of custody had â€œirregularitiesâ€\r\n  but was complete); Benton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. 26, 100 S.E.2d 534 (1957)\r\n  (BAL done by one hospital for purposes of litigation on blood drawn by another\r\n  hospital excluded because no complete chain of custody could be shown); Graham\r\n    v. State, 255 N.E.2d 652 (Ind. 1970) (if chain is incomplete, the evidence\r\n  cannot be introduced or made the basis for the testimony or report of an\r\n  expert).\r\nUnder Rule 703, SCRE, an\r\n  expert may rely on inadmissible evidence if the trial judge â€œexamines the\r\n  reliability of the inadmissible evidence and excludes opinions not deserving of\r\n  reliance in the specific instance and/or those that rely on grossly unreliable\r\n  data.â€Â  Kaye, Bernstein and Mnookin, The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence Â§ 3.6.1a\r\n  (2004).Â  Under South Carolina law, unless a test is conducted for medical\r\n  purposes, the result of that test is not reliable unless the proponent can\r\n  demonstrate a chain of custody.Â  Ex parte DHEC, supra. \r\nAll expert testimony must\r\n  meet a reliability threshold under Rule 702, SCRE, which imposes an affirmative\r\n  and meaningful gatekeeper function on the trial judge.Â  State v. White,\r\n  382 S.C. 265, 676 S.E.2d 684 (2009).Â  Here, the trial judge performed this duty\r\n  and held that the S.L.E.D. result was not reliable because he found that\r\n  Jamison did not prove a chain of custody insofar as practicable.Â  Having\r\n  made that finding, the judge erred in allowing Dr. Crane to give an\r\n  opinion based on that result.Â  An expert cannot testify to an opinion predicated\r\n  on an unreliable test.\r\nIn camera, Dr. Crane opined that Carlosâ€™ BAL had been 0.193\r\n  when the crash occurred based upon the S.L.E.D. analysis which tested the\r\n  sample at 0.168.Â  Dr. Crane also opined as to Carlosâ€™ BAL at the time of the\r\n  accident without reference to the S.L.E.D. test, using Louisâ€™ deposition and that\r\n  of another young man who was a passenger in the car with them that day.Â \r\n  Without the S.L.E.D. test, Dr. Crane opined that Carlosâ€™ BAL would have been\r\n  between 0.046 and 0.114.Â  \r\nJamison chose to present only\r\n  the higher S.L.E.D.-based BAL estimate when it examined Dr. Crane before the\r\n  jury.Â  Jamison argues on appeal that even if Dr. Craneâ€™s testimony should not\r\n  have been allowed to the extent it rested on the S.L.E.D. test, any error was\r\n  harmless since there was other evidence upon which Dr. Crane could base his\r\n  opinion that Carlos was intoxicated.Â  While certainly Dr. Crane presented such\r\n  testimony in his proffer, before the jury Jamison relied solely on the\r\n  S.L.E.D.-based extrapolation of 0.193.Â  The evidence, other than that of Dr.\r\n  Crane, that Carlos was intoxicated was not so overwhelming that we are\r\n  able to conclude that the admission of Dr. Craneâ€™s testimony was harmless error\r\n  here.Â  Mini Mart is therefore entitled to a new trial.[11]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that Texaco and\r\n  Anderson are entitled to a directed verdict, and that Mini Mart is entitled to\r\n  a new trial.Â  The jury verdict on appeal is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER, ACTING CHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Neither Star Enterprises nor Motiva is a party.\r\n[2] We refer to the respondents collectively as Jamison in the opinion.\r\n[3] We agree with appellants that â€œThe Road Map to the Bottom Lineâ€ and â€œThe\r\n  Successful Alcohol Management Training Guide,â€ both of which were created for\r\n  use by Texaco-owned stations, are not relevant to the agency issue as neither\r\n  document was provided to Mini Mart.\r\n[4] E.g., they must be neat, clean, not have visible tattoos or wear excessive\r\n  jewelry, and wear Texaco shirts and approved pants.\r\n[5] E.g., they must not smoke, eat, or listen to the radio in the sales counter\r\n  area, must greet and thank all customers, must be behind counter and offer\r\n  receipts.\r\n[6] The retail component is to be open 24 hours a day unless Texaco agrees to\r\n  shorter hours, and Texaco credit card applications and other point of sale\r\n  merchandise must be displayed in a specific space.\r\n[7] Legal notices must be displayed in back office, and only preapproved (printed\r\n  not hand written) signs can be used in the retail area.\r\n[8] E.g., coolers must be clean and kept between 34 and 38 degrees\r\n  Fahrenheit, shelves must be stocked with in-date merchandise, and area must be\r\n  kept clean and neat.\r\n[9] Among the items checked by the Mystery Shopper were whether the employees\r\n  complied with the Brand Standards appearance requirements and courtesy\r\n  standards, whether merchandise was properly priced and in-date, and whether the\r\n  premises and exterior were clean and well-kept.\r\n[10] We do not reach two other issues raised by Mini Mart regarding Dr. Craneâ€™s\r\n  testimony.Â  First, we find no objection which properly preserved the question\r\n  of Dr. Craneâ€™s qualification as an expert.Â  E.g., Harris v. Campbell,\r\n  293 S.C. 85, 358 S.E.2d 719 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Second, we disagree that whether\r\n  Carlos was impaired by alcohol at the time of the accident is an improper subject\r\n  for expert testimony.Â  E.g., Mizell v.

Smith, of Smith &amp; Koontz, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n___________\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  This case involves the\r\n  collection of a promissory note.Â  Financial\r\n  Federal Credit, Inc. (FFC Inc.), a Texas corporation, brought this action to\r\n  foreclose a judgment against property owned by Dennis Brown in South Carolina after it obtained a default judgment against Brown in a Texas federal court.Â \r\n  Brown filed a motion to dismiss, alleging the Texas default judgment was void\r\n  due to a lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  The circuit court granted Brownâ€™s motion\r\n  to dismiss, and FFC Inc. appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nI. FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFFC Inc. provided financing\r\n  to Gregg Construction Co., a South Carolina corporation, for the purchase of\r\n  equipment.Â  A Promissory Note dated April 29, 2002 was executed by Gregg\r\n  Construction Co. in the total amount of $574,992.[1]Â \r\n  Repayment of the loan was to be made in forty-eight monthly installments.Â  Gregg\r\n  Construction Co. did not make the payments as scheduled, however, so the full\r\n  unpaid balance became due pursuant to an acceleration clause.Â  \r\nÂ Prior to execution of the\r\n  Promissory Note, Brown had signed a continuing Guaranty whereby Brown guaranteed\r\n  all obligations of Gregg Construction Co. to FFC Inc.Â  The Guaranty, signed on\r\n  December 19, 2000, contained provisions regarding choice of venue and service\r\n  of process.Â  \r\nUnder the terms of the Guaranty,\r\n  venue for any litigation was to be in Harris County, Texas.Â  In addition, Brown\r\n  agreed that First Federal Commercial, Inc., of Houston, Texas would be his attorney-in-fact\r\n  and agent to accept or waive service of process, and that written notice of such\r\n  service or waiver would be sent to Brown by FFC Inc. at the address he designated\r\n  in the Guaranty within three days after the agent was either served or had executed\r\n  a waiver.Â  Brownâ€™s street address in Moncks Corner, South Carolina was listed\r\n  on the Guaranty directly below his signature.[2]Â  \r\nAfter Brown did not make the\r\n  payments promised under the Guaranty, FFC Inc. filed a complaint in federal\r\n  court in Texas pursuant to the partiesâ€™ contractual agreement as to venue. Â The\r\n  complaint was served on Mike Gallagher, Executive Vice President of First\r\n  Federal Commercial, Inc., as Brownâ€™s attorney-in-fact and agent.Â  \r\nFFC Inc. sent notice to Brown\r\n  at his designated address in South Carolina via certified mail (return receipt\r\n  requested) and first class mail that it had served First Federal Commercial,\r\n  Inc., his designated agent, with a complaint, a copy of which was enclosed.Â  The\r\n  certified mailing was returned unclaimed.Â  \r\nFFC Inc. obtained a default\r\n  judgment against Brown in the United States District Court for the Southern\r\n  District of Texas, Houston Division, in the amount of $210,750.02, plus\r\n  interest.Â  In the order granting default judgment, the court noted that Brown\r\n  was served with process through his designated agent and was served with FFC\r\n  Inc.â€™s motion for default judgment, but he had not responded to the complaint\r\n  or the motion and was in default. Â The Texas default judgment was transferred\r\n  to South Carolina and was recorded in the United States District Court for the\r\n  District of South Carolina.Â  A Transcript of Judgment was entered for\r\n  $210,750.02 in the South Carolina federal court. \r\nThe Transcript of Judgment\r\n  was subsequently recorded in the office of the Berkeley County Clerk of Court\r\n  and enrolled as a judgment.Â  The Berkeley County Clerk of Court issued a writ\r\n  of execution to the Berkeley County Sheriffâ€™s Department to satisfy the\r\n  judgment from property owned by Brown in Berkeley County.Â  \r\nFFC Inc. filed the current action\r\n  for Foreclosure of Judgment against Brown[3] in the Berkeley County Court of Common Pleas.Â  Brown moved to dismiss the\r\n  action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, for failure to state a claim for which\r\n  relief could be granted.Â  Specifically, Brown alleged the Texas default\r\n  judgment was void due to a lack of personal jurisdiction and that FFC Inc.\r\n  could not, therefore, enforce the judgment in South Carolina. Â Brown argued his\r\n  due process rights were violated by FFC Inc.â€™s service of process on an agent\r\n  who was essentially the same as FFC Inc. and who had an adverse interest.Â  The\r\n  circuit court granted Brownâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nII.Â  ISSUES\r\nOn appeal, FFC Inc. contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in granting Brownâ€™s motion to dismiss because the court\r\n  failed to limit its review to the facts alleged in the complaint, as required\r\n  by Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, and the circuit court did not have the authority to\r\n  rule on whether the Texas court lacked jurisdiction over Brown.Â  FFC Inc. further\r\n  contends that, even if the circuit court was within its authority to review\r\n  whether Brown was properly served in the Texas lawsuit, the circuit court erred\r\n  in dismissing its action because service upon Brown to obtain the default\r\n  judgment was proper. \r\n\r\nIII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  Scope of Motion to\r\n  Dismiss \r\nAt the hearing on Brownâ€™s\r\n  motion, FFC Inc. pointed out that Brownâ€™s motion to dismiss was technically made\r\n  under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, failure to state a cause of action, and that Brown\r\n  did not specifically move pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), SCRCP to dismiss for lack\r\n  of jurisdiction over the person.Â  During the ensuing colloquy, Brown reiterated\r\n  that he was arguing a lack of due process because there was no personal\r\n  jurisdiction to obtain the Texas default judgment and that the action to\r\n  foreclose on the judgment should, therefore, be dismissed. \r\nThe circuit court inquired\r\n  whether this was going to be the only argument FFC Inc. intended to make to\r\n  challenge the motion because, even if FFC Inc. was correct, the issue would\r\n  still come up at a later time.Â  FFC Inc. stated it was prepared to address the\r\n  merits of the case.Â  The circuit court stated:Â  â€œWell, letâ€™s address the merits\r\n  of the case.Â  Whether due process was denied and whether jurisdiction should\r\n  have been granted in the State of Texas to begin with, though, thatâ€™s the\r\n  bottom line issue.Â  And whether it comes up under 12(b) or summary judgment or\r\n  directed verdict, itâ€™s got to be decided at some point in time.â€Â  FFC Inc. expressly\r\n  agreed, stating it was â€œprepared to address thatâ€ issue.Â  \r\nIn our view, the circuit\r\n  court did not err in considering the issue of a lack of personal jurisdiction\r\n  and due process.Â  The 12(b)(6) label notwithstanding, Brown expressly argued a\r\n  lack of personal jurisdiction and due process in his motion to dismiss, so FFC\r\n  Inc. was on notice that this was the issue before the court.Â  In addition, FFC\r\n  Inc. affirmatively consented at the hearing to consideration of the issue.Â  The\r\n  parties did, in fact, thoroughly argue the merits of the jurisdictional\r\n  question at the hearing and FFC Inc. presented documents and law in support of\r\n  its position.Â  Thus, there is no error warranting reversal in this regard.\r\n\r\nB.Â  Dismissal of Action \r\nFFC Inc. next argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in dismissing its action because service upon Brown was\r\n  proper.\r\n(1)Â  Enforcement of\r\n  Judgments\r\nAs an initial matter, we note\r\n  actions to enforce foreign judgments are generally brought pursuant to the Uniform\r\n  Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-35-910 to -960 (2005\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2008), which was adopted in South Carolina in 1993.Â  In the current\r\n  action, however, FFC Inc. did not file a complaint pursuant to the Act; rather,\r\n  it transferred the Texas federal court judgment to a federal court in South Carolina, then recorded it in state court in Berkeley County, where it sought a\r\n  judgment lien and foreclosure. Â Brown and FFC Inc. advised the circuit court at\r\n  the hearing in this matter that they agreed the Act is not applicable here\r\n  because the Texas judgment was transferred to a South Carolina federal court.\r\nThe circuit court did not\r\n  apply the terms of the Act in this matter; however, section 15-35-540 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code provides that a transcript of judgment from a South\r\n  Carolina federal court may be indexed as a judgment in any county in this\r\n  state:\r\nA\r\n  transcript of a final judgment of any\r\n  court of record of this State or of any district or circuit court of the\r\n    United States within this State directing in whole or in part the payment\r\n  of money, may be docketed with the clerk of the court of common pleas in any\r\n    county and when so docketed shall be entered upon the book of abstracts and\r\n  duly indexed and shall have the same force and effect as a judgment of that\r\n    court.Â  Any such transcript shall set out the names of the parties,\r\n  plaintiff and defendant, the attorneys of record, the date and amount of the\r\n  judgment, the time from which interest is to be computed and the amount of\r\n  costs.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-540\r\n  (2005) (emphasis added); see Integrity Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 295\r\n  S.C. 143, 367 S.E.2d 441 (Ct. App. 1988) (stating section 15-35-540 allows the\r\n  entry of transcripts of final judgments of any district court of this state). \r\n(2) Â Personal Jurisdiction\r\nFFC Inc. contends the circuit\r\n  court erred in dismissing its action against Brown as the Texas default\r\n  judgment against Brown was not void due to a lack of personal jurisdiction.\r\nâ€œA judgment is void if a\r\n  court acts without personal jurisdiction.â€Â  BB &amp; T v. Taylor, 369\r\n  S.C. 548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 503&nbsp;(2006).Â  â€œA judgment of a court without\r\n  jurisdiction of the person or of the subject matter is not entitled to\r\n  recognition or enforcement in another state, or to the full faith and credit\r\n  provided for in the federal Constitution.â€Â  50 C.J.S. Judgments Â§ 986 (1997).Â \r\n  â€œA court generally obtains personal jurisdiction by the service of a summons.â€Â  BB &amp; T, 369 S.C. at 551, 533 S.E.2d at 503.\r\nâ€œA judgment of a court of\r\n  record of another state is entitled to the same presumptions of regularity in\r\n  jurisdiction as a domestic judgment, and such presumption can be overthrown\r\n  only by clear and convincing evidence of want of jurisdiction.â€Â  50 C.J.S. Judgments Â§ 987 (1997) (footnote omitted).Â  â€œWhere a judgment recovered in a court of\r\n  general jurisdiction in another state is relied on, and the record thereof is duly\r\n  authenticated or certified, and produced in evidence, it will be presumed that\r\n  the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties, in the\r\n  absence of proof to the contrary or of a showing to the contrary by the record\r\n  itself . . . .â€Â  Id. (footnote omitted).\r\nAt the hearing in this\r\n  matter, Brown argued his due process rights were violated and that there was no\r\n  personal jurisdiction to obtain the Texas default judgment because when FFC\r\n  Inc. effected service on his appointed agent at First Federal Commercial, Inc.,\r\n  FFC Inc. merely â€œserved itselfâ€ because the two entities were essentially the\r\n  same.Â  The circuit court agreed and ruled FFC Inc. was not entitled to enforce the\r\n  Texas default judgment in South Carolina against Brown because the Texas judgment was void due to a lack of personal service and due process. \r\nThe circuit court relied upon\r\n  the case of George v. American Ginning Co., 46 S.C. 1, 24 S.E. 41 (1896).Â \r\n  In American Ginning, the plaintiff, from New York, appointed William C.\r\n  Brown, of South Carolina, the companyâ€™s treasurer, as her attorney-in-fact to\r\n  commence an action on a promissory note and attach the property of the\r\n  defendant, American Ginning, a foreign corporation doing business in South Carolina.Â  Id. at 2, 24 S.E. at 41.Â  Brown procured a summons and complaint in\r\n  the name of the plaintiff against the corporation, and the sheriff issued a\r\n  return stating he had served the corporation by delivering a copy to a W. C.\r\n  Brown, the treasurer.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe corporation moved to\r\n  vacate a default judgment, arguing service was insufficient because the service\r\n  was made upon the same William C. Brown who was an officer of the corporation\r\n  while he was acting as the attorney-in-fact for the plaintiff.Â  Id. at 3, 24 S.E. at 41.Â  The trial court refused to vacate the default judgment.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, this Court reversed, stating:\r\nThe\r\n  question, then, resolves itself into an inquiry whether a person can legally\r\n    commence an action against a foreign corporation, of which he happens to be an\r\n    officer or agent, by serving himself with the process or summons necessary\r\n  to commence such action. Â So far as we are informed, there is no authority in\r\n  this state upon the point; and we do not think any is needed to show that such\r\n  a proposition, so utterly at variance with any proper conception of the due and\r\n  orderly administration of justice, cannot for a moment be entertained. Â To\r\n  concede such a proposition would open the door to the grossest fraud, which\r\n  would be a reproach to the administration of justice. Â Of course, we do not\r\n  mean to intimate that any fraud was intended in this particular case; but we\r\n  cannot assent to a proposition which, if established, would afford such an easy\r\n  mode of perpetrating frauds.\r\nAmerican\r\n  Ginning Co., 46 S.C. at 4, 24 S.E. at\r\n  42 (emphasis added).\r\nAmerican Ginning is not determinative here.Â  American Ginning involved an officer of a corporation bringing an action against that\r\n  corporation on behalf of a plaintiff, and then purporting to accept service on\r\n  behalf of the corporation.Â  The officer was essentially serving himself with\r\n  the action. That inherently involves a conflict of interest that is readily\r\n  apparent and offensive to any notion of due process.Â  In the current appeal, however,\r\n  FFC Inc. did essentially serve itself, but with the consent of Brown via the Guaranty\r\n  agreement.Â  Brown expressly consented to the appointment of the agent as well\r\n  as to venue and received the benefits of the contract.Â  He did not protest the\r\n  appointment of the agent until after this action occurred. Â In American\r\n    Ginning, there was no agreement as to the manner of service.Â  In the\r\n  current appeal, Brown specifically and expressly agreed to the manner of\r\n  service and, further, he even waived personal service altogether.Â  \r\nAlthough service confers\r\n  personal jurisdiction, â€œa defendant may waive personal service by consent or by\r\n  designating an agent to receive service of process.â€Â  Myrtle Beach Lumber Co. v. Globe Intâ€™l Corp., 281 S.C.\r\n  290, 292, 315 S.E.2d 142, 143&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984).Â  Further, where service is\r\n  accomplished in a manner consented to by the defendant, service of process is\r\n  valid and a court has jurisdiction over the defendant for purposes of entering\r\n  judgment.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Myrtle Beach Lumber Co.,\r\n  the defendants allowed their attorney to accept service of process and then asked\r\n  him to try to negotiate a settlement.Â  Id. at 291, 315 S.E.2d at 142.Â  When\r\n  no settlement was reached, the plaintiff obtained a default judgment.Â  Id.Â  The Court of Appeals held where the defendants had actual notice of the\r\n  complaint and expressly authorized their attorney to be their agent to accept\r\n  process, but then did not answer the complaint, the defendantsâ€™ challenge to\r\n  the imposition of a default judgment was without merit.Â  Id. at 292, 315\r\n  S.E.2d at 143.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals observed\r\n  service was accomplished in the manner consented to by the defendants, and\r\n  concluded:Â  â€œIf there has been any denial of due process, which this court\r\n  doubts, it â€˜is the result of a self-inflicted wound.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Patel\r\n    v. S. Brokers, 277 S.C. 490, 289 S.E.2d 642 (1982)).\r\nIn MinorPlanet Systems USA\r\n  Limited v. American Aire, Inc., 368 S.C. 146, 628 S.E.2d 43 (2006), we\r\n  considered a defendantâ€™s argument that a Texas default judgment should not be\r\n  enforced in this state due to an alleged lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  The\r\n  defendant, however, had signed a contract containing a forum selection clause providing\r\n  as follows:Â  \r\nCustomer\r\n  consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the State District\r\n  Court residing in Dallas County, Dallas, Texas (or if applicable the Federal\r\n  District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division) for all\r\n  litigation which may be brought with respect to . . . this agreement. Â \r\nId. at 148, 628 S.E.2d at 44.Â  \r\nWe held the forum selection\r\n  clause was enforceable under Texas law and the default judgment was enforceable\r\n  in South Carolina, noting that under Texas law, a defendant waives any\r\n  objection to the lack of personal jurisdiction by agreeing to a clause naming\r\n  Texas as the forum.Â  Id. at 150, 628 S.E.2d at 45 (citing In re AIU\r\n    Ins. Co., 148 S.W.3d 109 (Tx. 2004)).Â  Further, we noted that â€œ[u]nder South Carolina law, a consent to jurisdiction clause is generally presumed valid and\r\n  enforceable when made at armâ€™s length by sophisticated business entities.â€Â  Id. at 150 n.1, 628 S.E.2d at 45 n.1.Â  \r\nWe stated that under Texas\r\n  law, â€œenforcement of forum-selection clauses is mandatory unless the party\r\n  opposing enforcement clearly shows that enforcement would be unreasonable and\r\n  unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or\r\n  overreaching.â€Â  Id. at 150, 628 S.E.2d at 45 (quoting In re Automated\r\n    Collection Techs., Inc., 156 S.W.3d 557, 559 (Tx. 2004)).\r\nâ€œ[I]t is settled . . . that parties to a contract\r\n  may agree in advance to submit to the jurisdiction of a given court, to permit\r\n  notice to be served by the opposing party, or even to waive notice altogether.â€Â  Natâ€™l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311, 315-16 (1964).Â  \r\nBrown expressly consented to\r\n  venue in Texas and to the manner of service FFC Inc. provided here, and he\r\n  further consented to the waiver of personal service altogether.Â  The law\r\n  clearly provides that a party may not only consent to service via an agent, but\r\n  may also consent to a waiver of service.Â  Natâ€™l Equip. Rental, 375 U.S. at 315-16.Â  FFC Inc. provided Brown with notice by sending Brown copies of the\r\n  pleadings and other documents by certified mail (return receipt requested) and\r\n  by regular mail to the address he provided for service of process.Â  FFC Inc.\r\n  followed all of the agreed-upon procedures for service.Â  There is no indication\r\n  the agent did not promptly send notice to Brown or that another agent would\r\n  have effected service differently, so Brown has shown no prejudice in this\r\n  regard.Â  Further, Brown waived any argument about personal jurisdiction when he\r\n  agreed to the venue and service clauses in the Guaranty.Â  See, e.g., MinorPlanet,\r\n  368 S.C. at 152, 628 S.E.2d at 46 (enforcing Texas default judgment where the\r\n  defendant consented in advance to jurisdiction).\r\nMoreover, â€œthe effect and validity\r\n  of a foreign judgment must be determined by the laws of the state that supplied\r\n  the judgment.â€Â  Carson v. Vance, 326 S.C. 543, 548, 485 S.E.2d\r\n  126, 128 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The judgment to be enforced was from the Texas federal court.Â  Thus, we should look to Texas law regarding the sufficiency of\r\n  service of process.Â  Â \r\nIn the Texas federal district\r\n  court, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that an individual may be\r\n  served (1) by following state law for serving a summons in an action brought in\r\n  courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located\r\n  or where service is effected or (2)&nbsp;by delivering a copy of the summons\r\n  and complaint to an agent authorized to receive service of process.Â  See Rule 4(e)(1), FRCP (providing for service in accordance with state law); id. Rule 4(e)(2), (allowing service upon an authorized agent).[4]\r\nUnder\r\n  the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, pleadings â€œmay be served by delivering a copy\r\n  to the party to be served, or the partyâ€™s duly authorized agent or attorney of\r\n  record, as the case may be, either in person or by agent or by courier\r\n  receipted delivery or by certified or registered mail, to the partyâ€™s last\r\n    known address . . . or by such other manner as the court in its discretion\r\n  may direct. Â Service by mail shall be complete upon deposit of the paper . .\r\n    . in a post office . . . .â€Â  Rule 21(a), Tex. R. Civ. P. (emphasis added); cf. id. Rule 106 (stating a citation may be served on a defendant by\r\n  certified mail, return receipt requested).Â  Thus, under Texas law, FFC Inc.\r\n  gave proper service, even without the use of the agent, when it sent notice of\r\n  the pleadings to Brownâ€™s last known address, the address he supplied in the\r\n  Guaranty for service of process, by certified mail.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the\r\n  trial court erred in granting Brownâ€™s motion to dismiss.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nWALLER, J., concurs.\r\n  KITTREDGE, J., concurring in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J.,Â  and\r\n  PLEICONES, J., concur.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  I concur in the result reached by Justice Beatty\r\n  and agree that the circuit courtâ€™s order granting Brownâ€™s motion to dismiss\r\n  must be reversed.Â  Service of the pleadings on Brown pursuant to Texas law ends his personal jurisdiction challenge.Â  I write separately because I find it\r\n  unnecessary to reach Brownâ€™s claim that FFCâ€™s service of its summons and\r\n  complaint on itself violates due process.Â  \r\nBrown challenged the validity\r\n  of the Texas default judgment and argued that it was void due to lack of\r\n  personal jurisdiction.Â  As Justice Beatty correctly observes, because this\r\n  judgment originated in Texas, we must look to that stateâ€™s laws to determine\r\n  its effect and validity.Â  Minorplanet Systems USA Ltd. v. American Aire, Inc., 368 S.C. 146, 149,\r\n  628 S.E.2d 43, 45 (2006) (â€œThe\r\n  validity and effect of a foreign\r\n  judgment must be determined by the laws of the state which\r\n  rendered the judgment.â€).Â  \r\nA court must make two\r\n  findings before it may find that it has personal jurisdiction over a particular\r\n  defendant.Â  The first requirement of personal jurisdiction is that a defendant\r\n  have minimum contacts with the forum state. Â Burger King Corp.\r\n    v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985).Â  In this case, the forum selection clause contained\r\n  in the Guaranty gave the Texas courts personal jurisdiction over Brown\r\n  concerning his agreement with FFC.Â  See In re AIU Ins. Co., 148 S.W.3d 109, 112 (Tex. 2004)\r\n  (recognizing that a defendant waives any objection to lack\r\n  of personal jurisdiction by agreeing to a clause naming Texas as the forum).Â  Brown has not challenged the\r\n  validity of this portion of the forum selection clause.Â  \r\nSecond, it must be determined\r\n  whether service was proper under Texas law.Â  Furst v. Smith, 176 S.W.3d 864, 868 (Tex. App. 2005) (observing that\r\n  if a defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of a court, a plaintiff invokes\r\n  that jurisdiction by valid service of process).\r\nIn my view, Justice Beattyâ€™s\r\n  opinion conflates minimum contacts and service of process.Â  The matter of\r\n  minimum contacts is satisfied by the unchallenged venue selection provision.Â \r\n  The service of process issue is resolved through service of the pleadings on\r\n  Brown under Texas law.Â  After FFC served itself with the pleadings, the\r\n  pleadings were promptly served on Brown by certified mail to Brownâ€™s last known\r\n  address, as the partiesâ€™ agreement required.[5]Â \r\n  Rule 21(a), Tex.R.Civ.P. (providing that pleadings â€œmay be served â€¦ by\r\n  certified or registered mail, to the partyâ€™s last known addressâ€¦ Service by\r\n  mail shall be complete upon deposit of the paper â€¦ in a post office â€¦.â€).\r\nAccordingly, the service of\r\n  the pleadings on Brown was proper.Â  Because FFC established personal\r\n  jurisdiction by demonstrating minimum contacts and proper service, Brownâ€™s\r\n  personal jurisdiction challenge ends, making a resolution of his due process\r\n  challenge to the validity of the self-service clause unnecessary.Â Â  \r\nNot only does the Court\r\n  need not reach the due process challenge to self-service clauses, the facts of\r\n  the case do not squarely present this issue.Â  Contrary to Brownâ€™s assertion,\r\n  the agreement between FFC and Brown does not contain a true self-service\r\n  clause, for FFC (as Brownâ€™s agent) was required â€œto give written notice of such\r\n  service or waiver to [Brown] within three (3) days after service was effected\r\n  or such waiver was executed, by mailing such written notice to [Brownâ€™s]\r\n  address â€¦ by certified mail, return receipt requested.â€Â  The contract therefore\r\n  required notice to Brown of any process notwithstanding the ability of FFC to\r\n  initially serve itself or waive service.Â  Compliance with the Texas rules\r\n  concerning service also satisfied this contractual provision. Consequently, the\r\n  terms of this contract do not present a true self-service clause.\r\nI am concerned that the\r\n  opinion of Justice Beatty may be construed as giving this Courtâ€™s imprimatur to\r\n  self-service clauses in all contracts, regardless of the nature of the\r\n  contract, the sophistication of the parties and other considerations.Â  Justice\r\n  Beatty notes that FFC â€œdid essentially serve itself, but with the consent of\r\n  Brown via the Guaranty agreement.â€Â  Justice Beatty further states without\r\n  reservation that â€œwhere service is accomplished in a manner consented to by the\r\n  defendant, service of process is valid and a court has jurisdiction over the\r\n  defendant for purposes of entering judgment.â€Â  I do not subscribe to the view that\r\n  the presence of a self-service provision in a contract comports with due\r\n  process in all cases.Â  I am concerned the lead opinion may be giving an\r\n  unintended green light for self-service clauses in the boilerplate of every\r\n  contract under the sun.Â  \r\nIn my judgment, the posture\r\n  of this case dictates we not reach the due process challenge.Â  This is similar\r\n  to the approach taken in National Equipment Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent,\r\n  375 U.S. 311 (1964).Â  In National Equipment, defendants, who were Michigan farmers, leased farm equipment from the plaintiff corporation. Â The lease\r\n  purported to authorize service of process on Florence Weinberg of Long Island,\r\n  New York.Â  Although not disclosed, Florence Weinberg was the wife of one of the\r\n  plaintiff corporationâ€™s officers.Â  Plaintiff commenced an action in New York alleging defendants failed to make payments under the lease.Â  Plaintiff served\r\n  defendants by having the pleadings delivered to Mrs. Weinberg.Â  Significantly,\r\n  plaintiff and Mrs. Weinberg also served defendants with the summons and\r\n  complaint by certified mail in accordance with applicable service of process\r\n  rules.Â  Defendants defaulted and a judgment was entered for plaintiff.Â \r\n  Defendantsâ€™ effort to quash the service of the pleadings was ultimately decided\r\n  by the Supreme Court.Â  â€œSince [defendants] did in fact receive complete and\r\n  timely notice of the lawsuit pending against them,â€ the Court declined to reach\r\n  the due process claim.Â  Id. at 315.Â  (â€œWe need not and do not in\r\n  this case reach the situation where no personal notice has been given to the\r\n  defendant. Since the respondents did in fact receive complete and timely notice\r\n  of the lawsuit pending against them, no due process claim has been made. The\r\n  case before us is therefore quite different from cases where there was no\r\n  actual notice â€¦â€).Â  \r\nI would reverse the trial\r\n  court only on the basis that Brown was subject to personal jurisdiction in\r\n  Texas and was properly served with the pleadings under Texas law. \r\nTOAL, C.J. and\r\n  PLEICONES, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  By letter dated April 30, 2002, the Promissory Note\r\n  was amended to reflect a change in the commencement date of the instrument to\r\n  April 30, 2002.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The Guaranty specifically provided:\r\nAs a\r\n  material part of the consideration for FFCI entering into . . .Â  one or more\r\n  obligations from Subject or having Subject as an obligor thereon, Guarantor\r\n  hereby irrevocably designates and appoints First Federal Commercial Inc.,\r\n  Houston, Texas as Attorney-In-Fact and Agent for Guarantor, and in Guarantorâ€™s\r\n  name, place and stead to accept or waive service of any process (and for no other\r\n  purpose) within the State of Texas, FFCI agreeing to give written notice of\r\n  such service or waiver to Guarantor within three (3) days after such service\r\n  was effected or such waiver was executed, by mailing such written notice to\r\n  Guarantorâ€™s address as set forth below by certified mail, return receipt\r\n  requested; and Guarantor does hereby agree to the jurisdiction and venue of any\r\n  court located in Harris County, Texas, regarding any matter arising hereunder.Â \r\n  Guarantor hereby waives the right to have a jury trial in any action, case or\r\n  proceeding based on or relating hereto.\r\n[3]Â  In its complaint, FFC Inc. also named as defendants\r\n  Gilbert W.

Â Petitioner\r\n  argues that his attorney-client privilege was violated when, after he filed an\r\n  application for PCR, trial counsel turned over his entire trial file to the AGO.[1] Â We find that Petitionerâ€™s attorney-client privilege was not violated by the\r\n  disclosure of his entire trial file to the AGO and affirm the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  order.Â \r\nFacts/Procedural History\r\nPetitioner was convicted of\r\n  murder and first degree burglary, and he was sentenced to death.Â  We affirmed\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s conviction and sentence.Â  State v. Binney, 362 S.C. 353,\r\n  608 S.E.2d 418 (2005), cert denied, 546 U.S. 852 (2005).Â  \r\nOn April 7, 2006, after his\r\n  execution was stayed, Petitioner filed an application for PCR in which he\r\n  alleged that trial counsel was ineffective during the guilt and sentencing\r\n  phases of his trial.Â  Petitioner alleged many grounds of ineffectiveness.Â  In\r\n  particular, three of the allegations were so broad as to encompass effectively\r\n  the entire scope of trial counselâ€™s obligations in Petitionerâ€™s defense.Â \r\n  First, Petitioner alleged that â€œ[trial] counsel failed to investigate the facts\r\n  and circumstances surrounding the death of the victim.â€Â  Second, Petitioner\r\n  alleged that â€œ[trial] counsel failed to investigate, develop, and present all\r\n  available, relevant, and admissible mitigating evidence.â€Â  Third, Petitioner\r\n  alleged that â€œ[trial] counsel failed to investigate and present evidence in\r\n  support of all potential defenses in the guilt and innocence phase.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn February 27, 2007, trial\r\n  counsel met with attorneys from the AGO.Â  The purpose of this meeting was to\r\n  discuss the allegations made by Petitioner in his application for PCR.Â  Due to\r\n  the breadth of Petitionerâ€™s allegations of ineffectiveness, trial counsel\r\n  determined that it was necessary to make an entire copy of the trial file\r\n  available for review and copying by the AGO attorneys.Â  \r\nPetitioner later discovered\r\n  that trial counsel made the entire trial file available to the AGO.Â  Petitioner\r\n  moved the PCR court to order that his file be returned and that the AGO\r\n  attorneys who reviewed the file be disqualified from participating in his PCR\r\n  proceedings, arguing that his attorney-client privilege had not been waived as\r\n  to the entire file.Â  Following a hearing, the PCR court denied Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  motion finding that the broad allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel\r\n  contained in Petitionerâ€™s PCR application waived the attorney-client privilege\r\n  with respect to all material contained in the trial file.Â  \r\nPetitioner filed a notice of\r\n  appeal and a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the order of the PCR\r\n  court.Â  The PCR courtâ€™s denial of Petitionerâ€™s motion is interlocutory, and\r\n  thus not immediately appealable.Â  Nonetheless, due to the exceptional\r\n  circumstances of this matter, we granted Petitionerâ€™s writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the following issue:\r\n\r\n  Given\r\n    the particular allegations made in his April 7, 2006 application for PCR, did\r\n    Petitioner completely waive his attorney-client privilege with respect to his\r\n    trial file? \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIf the PCR courtâ€™s findings\r\n  are supported by any evidence of probative value in the record, they should be\r\n  upheld.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626\r\n  (1989).Â  Â Â \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner argues that he did\r\n  not completely waive his attorney client privilege upon application for PCR\r\n  and, therefore, this privilege was violated when trial counsel made his entire\r\n  file available to the AGO.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-130\r\n  (1996), which describes a PCR applicantâ€™s waiver of the attorney-client\r\n  privilege, states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  Where a\r\n    defendant alleges ineffective assistance of prior trial counselâ€¦as a ground for\r\n    post-conviction reliefâ€¦the applicant shall be deemed to have waived the\r\n    attorney-client privilege with respect to both oral and written communications\r\n    between counsel and the defendant, and between retained or appointed experts\r\n    and the defendant, to the extent necessary for prior counsel to respond to the\r\n    allegation.Â  This waiver of the attorney client privilege shall be deemed\r\n    automatic upon the filing of the application alleging ineffective assistance of\r\n    prior counsel and the court need not enter an order waiving the privilege.Â \r\n    Thereafter, counsel alleged to have been ineffective is free to discuss and\r\n    disclose any aspect of the representation with representatives of the State for\r\n    purposes of defending against the allegations of ineffectiveness, to the extent\r\n    necessary for prior counsel to respond to the allegation.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  interpreting statutes, th[is] Court looks to the plain meaning of the statute\r\n  and the intent of the Legislature.â€Â  Gay v. Ariail, 381 S.C. 341, 344, 673 S.E.2d 418, 420 (2009) (citing State\r\n    v. Dingle 376 S.C. 643, 659 S.E.2d 101 (2008)).Â  Furthermore,Â  \r\n\r\n  If possible, legislative intent should be found in the\r\n    plain language of the statute itself.Â  If a statuteâ€™s language is plain and\r\n    unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory\r\n    interpretation are not needed and the Court has no right to impose another\r\n    meaning.\r\n\r\nId.Â  (citing State v. Gaines, 380 S.C. 23, 667 S.E.2d\r\n  728 (2008)).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWe find that the language of S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-130 (1996) is plain and unambiguous.Â  Section 17-27-130\r\n  clearly states that an applicantâ€™s â€œwaiver of the attorney client privilege\r\n  shall be deemed automatic upon the filing of the application alleging\r\n  ineffective assistance of prior counselâ€¦.â€Â  In so far as it applies to this\r\n  case, we find that Petitionerâ€™s waiver of the attorney-client privilege was\r\n  automatic upon the filing of his application for PCR on April 7, 2006. Â In order to determine the scope of a PCR applicantâ€™s\r\n  waiver pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-130 (1996), the specific allegations\r\n  made in the initial application are controlling.Â  Due to the automatic nature\r\n  of this waiver, its scope cannot be whittled down by the subsequent amendment\r\n  of the application.[2] Â Â \r\nFurthermore, Â§ 17-27-130\r\n  states that an applicantâ€™s waiver is made â€œto the extent necessary for prior\r\n  counsel to respond to the allegation.â€Â  It is clear from the language of this\r\n  provision that the General Assembly did not intend for the scope of this waiver\r\n  to be entirely limited or automatically complete.Â  We find that the plain\r\n  language of Â§ 17-27-130 makes clear that the General Assembly intended for the\r\n  scope of the automatic waiver to be directly proportional to the breadth of the\r\n  allegations made in each individual PCR application.Â  \r\nTurning to the facts of this\r\n  case, upon application, Petitioner waived his attorney-client privilege â€œto the\r\n  extent necessary for prior counsel to respond to the allegation[s]â€ of ineffectiveness.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-130 (1996).Â  We find that the particular allegations\r\n  made in Petitionerâ€™s application for PCR were so broad as to effectuate a\r\n  complete waiver of his attorney-client privilege.Â  \r\nAlthough Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  application alleged many grounds of ineffectiveness, we find that the breadth\r\n  of three particular allegations constituted a complete waiver of Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  attorney-client privilege.Â  Specifically, Petitionerâ€™s application alleges that\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to (1) â€œinvestigate the facts\r\n  and circumstances surrounding the death of the victim,â€ (2) â€œinvestigate,\r\n  develop, and present all available, relevant, and admissible mitigating\r\n  evidence,â€ and (3) â€œinvestigate and present evidence in support of all\r\n  potential defenses in the guilt and innocence phase.â€Â  The breadth of these\r\n  allegations, which encompass in effect the entirety of trial counselâ€™s\r\n  obligations in presenting a defense, necessitated a review of the entire trial\r\n  file in order for the AGO, on behalf of trial counsel, to properly â€œrespond to\r\n  the allegation[s]â€ in Petitionerâ€™s application.Â  \r\nFinally, pursuant to the\r\n  clear and unambiguous language of Â§ 17-27-130, prior counsel was justified in\r\n  disclosing the entire trial file for reviewing and copying.Â  Section 17-27-130\r\n  states, \r\n\r\n  [C]ounsel\r\n    alleged to have been ineffective is free to discuss and disclose any aspect of\r\n    the representation with representatives of the State for purposes of defending\r\n    against the allegations of ineffectiveness, to the extent necessary for prior\r\n    counsel to respond to the allegation.Â  \r\n\r\nThis provision permits prior\r\n  counsel, when faced with extremely broad allegations of ineffectiveness, to provide\r\n  representatives of the State with any information he deems necessary for the\r\n  defense of his representation.Â  Under the specific facts of this case, prior\r\n  counsel was justified in making Petitionerâ€™s entire trial file available to the\r\n  AGO.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we rule that Petitioner\r\n  completely waived his attorney-client privilege pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-27-130 because the allegations made in his application for PCR were so broad\r\n  as to encompass in effect nearly the entire scope of trial counselâ€™s\r\n  obligations in Petitionerâ€™s defense.Â  \r\nWALLER, BEATTY and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J. dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent, and would require the AGO to\r\n  return trial counselâ€™s file, and would disqualify the AGO attorneys who viewed\r\n  that file.\r\nUnder our post-conviction\r\n  relief (PCR) statutes, subject to a limited number of exceptions not applicable\r\n  here, an applicant must file an application within a one year statute of\r\n  limitations or be barred from pursuing this form of collateral relief.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-40 through 50 (2003).Â  The overwhelming majority of these initial\r\n  applications, including the one at issue here, are filed by the inmate pro\r\n    se.Â  To hold, as does the majority, that the claims made in this\r\n  uncounseled document determine, forever, the scope of the applicantâ€™s waiver of\r\n  his attorney-client privilege is unsupported by the language of the statute. \r\nThe majorityâ€™s opinion rests\r\n  on its interpretation of Â§ 17-27-130, entitled â€œWaiver of attorney-client\r\n  privilege by allegation of ineffective prior counsel, access to files.â€Â  In its\r\n  entirety, this statute provides:\r\n\r\n  Where a\r\n    defendant alleges ineffective assistance of prior trial counsel or appellate\r\n    counsel as a ground for post-conviction relief or collateral relief under any\r\n    procedure, the applicant shall be deemed to have waived the attorney-client\r\n    privilege with respect to both oral and written communications between counsel\r\n    and the defendant, and between retained or appointed experts and the defendant,\r\n    to the extent necessary for prior counsel to respond to the allegation.Â  This\r\n    waiver of the attorney-client privilege shall be deemed automatic upon the\r\n    filing of the allegation alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel and\r\n    the court need not enter an order waiving the privilege.Â  Thereafter, counsel\r\n    alleged to have been ineffective is free to discuss and disclose any aspect of\r\n    the representation with representatives of the State for purposes of defending\r\n    against the allegations of ineffectiveness, to the extent necessary for prior\r\n    counsel to respond to the allegation.\r\n  In the\r\n    case of a defendant who has been convicted of a capital offense and sentenced\r\n    to death, the defendantâ€™s prior trial counsel or appellate counsel shall make\r\n    available to the capital defendantâ€™s collateral counsel the complete files of\r\n    the defendantâ€™s trial or appellate counsel.Â  The capital defendantâ€™s collateral\r\n    counsel may inspect and photocopy the files, but the defendantâ€™s prior trial or\r\n    appellate counsel shall maintain custody of their respective files, except as\r\n    to the material which is admitted into evidence in any trial proceeding.\r\n\r\nReading the first\r\n  paragraph of the statute, it is my opinion that the automatic waiver of the\r\n  privilege does not extend to the entire file, but is instead limited to: â€œoral\r\n  and written communications between counsel and the defendant, and between\r\n  retained or appointed experts and the defendant,[3] toÂ  the extent necessary for prior counsel to respond to the\r\n  allegationâ€¦.Thereafter, counsel alleged to have been ineffective is free to\r\n  discuss and disclose any aspect of the representation with representatives of\r\n  the Stateâ€¦to the extent necessary for prior counsel to respond to the\r\n  allegation.â€Â  It is noteworthy that whileÂ  this paragraph makes no mention of\r\n  counselâ€™s file, but insteadÂ  explicitly limits the permissible scope of\r\n  counselâ€™s disclosures to AGO attorneys, it is upon this paragraph of the\r\n  statute alone that the majority rests its holding.\r\nThe second paragraph of the\r\n  statute does directly reference the attorneyâ€™s file, and is specifically\r\n  directed to capital cases such as this.Â  This paragraph requires that the\r\n  capital defendantâ€™s trial and/or appellate attorneys make files available to\r\n  the defendantâ€™s PCR counsel who may inspect and copy the contentsÂ  but explicitly\r\n  requires that the original attorneys otherwise retain custody of their files.Â \r\n  To hold, as does the majority, that under this statute these attorneys are free\r\n  to turn over their entire files to the AGO is puzzling in light of the\r\n  statuteâ€™s clear directive that the files are to remain in the custody of the\r\n  original attorney, and be made available only to the applicantâ€™s attorney. Â I\r\n  would not foreclose the possibility that an attorney charged with rendering\r\n  ineffective assistance may need to rely upon an item in her file as part of her\r\n  defense, but that is a far cry from copying the entire file and turning it over\r\n  to the AGO. \r\nWhen the Court abolished the\r\n  doctrine of in favorem vitae, it did so in large part in reliance upon\r\n  the legislatureâ€™s adoption of the Uniform Post Conviction Relief Act.Â  State\r\n    v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  The decision today to hold\r\n  that thisÂ  pro se capital defendant has made a wholesale\r\n  waiver of his attorney-client privilege undermines one of the fundamental tenets\r\n  upon which the abolition of the ancient doctrine rested, that is, that PCR\r\n  â€œsafeguards the [capital defendant] and render[s] the protection afforded by in\r\n    favorem vitae surplusage.â€Â  Id. at 61, 406 S.E.2d 324. \r\nI would reverse the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order, require that the file be returned to trial counsel, and would\r\n  disqualify any member of the AGOâ€™s staff who has viewed this file or any of its\r\n  contents.Â  I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The issue presented by this matter is novel and capable of arising in every PCR\r\n  proceeding.Â  We granted a writ of certiorari in this case due to these\r\n  exceptional circumstances.Â  See In re Breast Implant Product Liability\r\n    Litigation, 331 S.C. 540, 503 S.E.2d 445 (1998); see also Laffitte v.\r\n      Bridgestone Corp., 381 S.C. 460, 674 S.E.2d 154 (2009) (finding that, where\r\n  a matter is not otherwise immediately appealable, this Court may issue a writ\r\n  of certiorari due to â€œexceptional circumstancesâ€).Â  In Bridgestone, we\r\n  â€œgranted a petition for a writ of certiorari in our original jurisdiction.â€Â  Bridgestone,\r\n  381 S.C. at 464.Â  Writing for the Court in that matter as I do here, my\r\n  statement of the procedural posture was incorrect.Â  A matter may not be before\r\n  this Court by a writ of certiorari and in our original jurisdiction.Â \r\n  The questions presented by Bridgestone, just as the issue presented\r\n  here, were before this Court by way of a writ of certiorari issued due to\r\n  exceptional circumstances, and not in our original jurisdiction.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Petitioner amended his application for PCR on May 7, 2007 and May 25, 2007.Â  These\r\n  amended applications are of no consequence in determining the degree to which\r\n  Petitioner waived his attorney-client privilege.\r\n[3] Note the statutory waiver does not extend to communications between the experts\r\n  and the defendantâ€™s attorney.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26725","title":"Hollman vs TLC Laser Eye Center","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26725","description":"On a writ of certiorari, the Court vacated the circuit court order allowing the respondents to contact nonparty patients of petitioners.

Woolfson,\r\n  Op. No. 2009-MO-025 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 28, 2009).Â  \r\n\r\nOn remand, the circuit court\r\n  found the interviews were necessary for respondentsâ€™\r\n  fraud cause of action, Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA) cause of action, and\r\n  in order for respondents to meaningfully respond to petitionersâ€™ defenses of\r\n  the statute of frauds and the statute of repose.Â  Petitioners now seek\r\n  another writ of certiorari to review the decision of the circuit court.Â  \r\nA writ of certiorari may be\r\n  issued to review a discovery order where exceptional circumstances exist.Â  Laffitte\r\n    v. Bridgestone Corp., 381 S.C. 460, 674 S.E.2d 154 (2009).Â  This matter presents exceptional circumstances which warrant the\r\n  issuance of a writ of certiorari.Â  Allowing the interviews will moot any claim\r\n  petitioners could raise on appeal that the discovery was erroneously allowed.Â \r\n  In addition, the privacy rights of patients is an issue of significant public\r\n  interest, and issues involving the release of patient information in discovery\r\n  is arising more often in the courts.Â  Accordingly, we grant the petition for a\r\n  writ of certiorari and dispense with further briefing.\r\nOn certiorari,\r\n  this Court will review only errors of law and will not review factual findings\r\n  unless wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  S.C. Bd. of Examâ€™rs in Optometry\r\n    v. Cohen, 256 S.C. 13, 180 S.E.2d 650 (1971).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s rulings on\r\n  discovery matters will not be disturbed by an appellate court absent a clear\r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Dunn v. Dunn, 298 S.C. 499, 381 S.E.2d 734 (1989). \r\nRule 26(b)(1), SCRCP,\r\n  provides, unless otherwise limited by order of the court, â€œ[p]arties may obtain\r\n  discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the\r\n  subject matter involved in the pending action . . . It is not ground for\r\n  objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the\r\n  information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of\r\n  admissible evidence.â€Â  If the discovery process threatens to become abusive or\r\n  create a particularized harm to a litigant or third party, the trial judge may\r\n  issue an order â€œto protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment,\r\n  oppression, or undue burden by expense.â€Â  Rule 26(c), SCRCP; Hamm v. S.C.\r\n    Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 312 S.C. 238, 439 S.E.2d 852 (1994).Â  If a person\r\n  requesting a protective order shows a particularized harm which will be caused\r\n  by allowing the discovery, the opposing party has the burden of showing the\r\n  information sought is â€œrelevant and necessaryâ€ to the case.Â  Laffitte v.\r\n    Bridgestone Corp., supra; Hamm v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, supra.Â \r\n  In determining whether a protective order is necessary, the trial judge is\r\n  required to weigh the factors of whether the information sought is â€œrelevant\r\n  and necessaryâ€ evidence against any particularized harm the opposing party may\r\n  suffer. Â Laffitte v. Bridgestone Corp., supra; Hamm v. S.C. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Commâ€™n, supra.Â  In determining whether information is necessary, the party\r\n  seeking the information must â€œdemonstrate with specificity exactly how the lack\r\n  of information will impair the presentation of the case on the merits to the\r\n  point that an unjust result is a real, rather than a merely possible, threat.â€Â  Laffitte v. Bridgestone Corp., 674 S.E.2d at 163.Â  The trial court must\r\n  determine whether there are reasonable alternatives available to discover the\r\n  information.Â  Id.\r\nAs to the requirement of\r\n  particularized harm, no protective device can limit the invasion of the\r\n  nonparty patientsâ€™ privacy once contact with them is permitted.Â  The nonparty\r\n  patients have a valid and legitimate expectation that their medical information\r\n  will remain confidential which outweighs respondentsâ€™ intent to use this\r\n  personal information to buttress their claims by showing a propensity by\r\n  petitioners for malpractice.Â  Petitioners have shown particularized harm to the\r\n  nonparty patients which will arise if the interviews are permitted.Â  Both the\r\n  State and Federal government have recognized the importance of the privacy\r\n  rights of patients.Â  Therefore, respondents must show the information sought\r\n  from the interviews is relevant and necessary to the case.\r\nAs to the requirement that the information sought be relevant, this\r\n  Court has held the information must be specifically relevant to the issues\r\n  involved in the litigation, not merely relevant to the subject matter of the\r\n  litigation.Â  Lafitte v. Bridgestone Corp. supra.Â  \r\nThe circuit court judge found\r\n  respondentsâ€™ â€œmethodology by which [they have] restricted its interview\r\n  requests provides a substantial basis for the relevancy.â€Â  He found â€œthe\r\n  ability to interview [the nonparty patients] and discuss their individual\r\n  experiences at TLC along with those of [respondents] is relevant under Rule\r\n  SCRCP 26 [sic] and permissible except to the extent that good cause exists to\r\n  restrict discovery of this information and these witnesses.â€Â  The judge further\r\n  found the information sought was directly related to the issues central to\r\n  respondentsâ€™ malpractice claims.Â  He stated the discovery of other patients\r\n  with problems and treatment similar to respondentsâ€™ problems is clearly relevant\r\n  since a central issue in the malpractice claims is â€œthe applicable standard of\r\n  care as it evolved during and after the time of [respondentsâ€™] surgeries.â€\r\nA claim for malpractice\r\n  requires a showing of the standard of care, a breach of the standard of care,\r\n  proximate cause, and damages.Â  Doe\r\n    v. Am. Red Cross Blood Servs., 297 S.C. 430, 377 S.E.2d 323 (1989). Â The standard of care which must be observed by a physician is that of\r\n  an average, competent practitioner acting in the same or similar circumstances.Â  Id.\r\nThe evidence relating to\r\n  treatment of the nonparty patients is irrelevant to respondentsâ€™ negligence claims\r\n  in that it cannot be used to show petitioners breached the standard of care\r\n  with a particular patient.Â  Â Â Accordingly, the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  the interviews with the nonparty patients were relevant to the causes of action\r\n  for malpractice.Â  Whether petitioners breached the standard of care with any\r\n  patients other than respondents is irrelevant to whether petitioners were\r\n  negligent in their treatment of respondents.\r\nA cause of action for fraud\r\n  requires: (1) a representation of fact; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality;\r\n  (4) either knowledge of the falsity of the representation or reckless disregard\r\n  of its truth or falsity; (5) the intent that the representation be acted on;\r\n  (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of the falsity of the representation; (7) the\r\n  hearerâ€™s reliance on the truth of the representation; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to\r\n  rely on the representation; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate\r\n  injury.Â  Schnellmann v. Roettger, 373 S.C. 379, 645 S.E.2d 239 (2007).\r\nThere is no evidence that any\r\n  of the nonparty patients were victims of fraud.Â  The treatment received by the nonparty patients is irrelevant to\r\n  respondentsâ€™ causes of action for fraud.Â  Whether other patients were similarly\r\n  treated does not prove any of the elements required to show fraudulent conduct\r\n  by petitioners toward respondents.\r\nTo establish a cause of\r\n  action under the UTPA, the plaintiff must prove unfair or deceptive acts or practices in\r\n  the conduct of any trade or commerce.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a)\r\n  (1985).Â  The unfair or deceptive act or practice must affect the\r\n  public interest.Â  Singleton v. Stokes Motors, Inc., \r\n  358\r\n  S.C. 369, 595 S.E.2d 461 (2004).Â  An impact on the public interest may be shown if the acts or\r\n  practices have the potential for repetition.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  potential for repetition may be proven by showing: (1) the same kind of actions\r\n  occurred in the past, thus making it likely they will continue to occur absent\r\n  deterrence; or (2) the defendantâ€™s procedures created a potential for\r\n  repetition of the unfair and deceptive acts.Â  Id.\r\nAlthough evidence of\r\n  petitionersâ€™ treatment of nonparty patients could be relevant for the UTPA\r\n  cause of action, as discussed below, the evidence is not necessary for\r\n  respondents to establish that cause of action.\r\nIn determining whether\r\n  information is necessary, the party seeking the information must â€œdemonstrate\r\n  with specificity exactly how the lack of information will impair the\r\n  presentation of the case on the merits to the point that an unjust result is a\r\n  real, rather than a merely possible, threat.â€Â  Laffitte v. Bridgestone\r\n    Corp., 674 S.E.2d at 163.Â  The trial court must determine whether there are\r\n  reasonable alternatives available to discover the information.Â  Id. Â \r\nThe circuit court found that\r\n  respondents allege petitioners engaged in a corporate-wide scheme to conceal\r\n  the harm done to respondents and other patients and to delay the disclosure of\r\n  crucial information beyond the applicable statutes of limitations and/or\r\n  repose.Â  The judge found the information sought from other patients is\r\n  necessary because the alleged scheme is based on the institutional quality of\r\n  petitionersâ€™ knowledge of the falsity of their representations and their\r\n  knowledge that the representations would be relied on by a significant number\r\n  of patients.Â  However, the circuit court failed to make specific findings as to\r\n  how the lack of information would impair respondentsâ€™ case.Â  \r\nRespondents may pursue their\r\n  claims against petitioners without interviewing petitionersâ€™ nonparty\r\n  patients.Â  Respondents failed to demonstrate with specificity what information\r\n  they seek or how the lack of interviews with the nonparty patients will impair\r\n  the presentation of their case to the extent that an unjust result is a real\r\n  threat.Â  Further, there is no evidence that there are no other reasonable\r\n  alternatives available to respondents to discover the information they seek\r\n  from the nonparty patients.Â  \r\nThe circuit court committed\r\n  an abuse of discretion in determining the interviews with the nonparty patients\r\n  were necessary.Â  Petitionersâ€™ treatment of other patients is not necessary to\r\n  establish any element of respondentsâ€™ causes of action.Â  In fact, no\r\n  information obtained in the interviews could establish whether petitioners\r\n  breached the standard of care when treating respondents or committed fraud on\r\n  respondents.Â  As to the UTPA cause of action, the circuit court did not make a\r\n  specific finding as to exactly how the lack of information obtained from the\r\n  interviews would impair respondentsâ€™ presentation of the merits of that cause\r\n  of action or that there were no reasonable alternatives available to discover\r\n  the information.Â  Laffitte v.\r\n    Bridgestone Corp., supra.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the record does not support the finding that the interviews are\r\n  necessary for the UTPA cause of action.\r\nFurther, it would be\r\n  inequitable to allow respondents to obtain nonparty patient information from\r\n  petitioners with the understanding the patients would not be contacted, only to\r\n  subsequently permit respondents to contact the patients.Â  Had the provision of\r\n  the Protective Order prohibiting respondents from contacting petitionersâ€™\r\n  patients not been included, there is a possibility petitioners would not have\r\n  disclosed the patient records, would have sought to redact the records, and/or\r\n  would have sought review of the order requiring the disclosure by writ of\r\n  certiorari or by refusing to comply with the order and appealing a contempt\r\n  citation.Â  Therefore, the order of the circuit court allowing respondents to\r\n  interview the nonparty patients is\r\nVACATED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26726","title":"Eldridge vs SC Department of Transportation","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26726","description":"The issue is whether an abandoned railroad right of way in Greenwood had any value for purposes of compensation.","date":"2009-09-21","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Eddie Wayne\r\n          Eldridge, Charles Louis Beaudrot, Russie Beaudrot Young, Bernard H.

Depâ€™t of\r\n    Transp., Op. No. 2007-UP-351 (Ct. App. filed July 11, 2007), in which the\r\n  Special Referee held Petitioners suffered no damages as the result of the\r\n  taking of an abandoned right-of-way in downtown Greenwood; the Court of Appeals\r\n  affirmed.Â  Â Â We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case\r\n  concerns an abandoned railroad right-of-way in Greenwood, SC.Â  Petitioners are\r\n  the current property owners along the right-of-way, and/or heirs of the\r\n  original landowners at the time the right-of-way was acquired by the railroad.Â  \r\nThe railroad,\r\n  located in downtown Greenwood, was originally acquired by Southern Railwayâ€™s\r\n  predecessor by virtue of an 1845 Act.Â  Some 150 years later, in the 1980â€™s, the\r\n  railroad elected to relocate its tracks to the outskirts of Greenwood.Â \r\n  Railroad attempted to convey its right-of-way to County by quitclaim deed.Â  Petitioners\r\n  brought this action challenging the conveyance, claiming ownership to the\r\n  right-of-way had reverted to them upon Railroadâ€™s abandonment.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter a long\r\n  procedural battle, the Court of Appeals held title to the former right of way\r\n  vested in the Plaintiffs, Petitioners herein.Â  Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 503 S.E.2d 191 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Petitioners consist of two\r\n  classes of individuals: 1) abutting landowners along the right-of-way when the\r\n  railroad tracks were removed in 1984, and 2) heirs to the original owners at\r\n  the time the right-of-way was acquired in 1852.Â  Petitioners were granted class\r\n  certification, and their takings claim was referred to the Special Referee.Â  \r\nThe sole issue\r\n  before the Referee was the amount of damages suffered by Petitioners as a\r\n  result of two projects in which Respondent, SCDOT, used the abandoned railroad\r\n  right of way.Â  The first project was the 1986 Project, consisting of two main\r\n  areas: 1) the portion of the right-of-way situated between two existing\r\n  roadways (the Property Between The Roads); and 2) the property directly\r\n  adjacent to the existing landowners (Adjacent Property).Â  The Adjacent Property\r\n  consists of 55,605 square feet, while the Property Between the Roads consists\r\n  of 102,372 square feet.Â  The second project was the Calhoun Road Project\r\n  (eighteen tracts located within the abandoned right-of-way along Calhoun Road).Â  \r\nThe Referee\r\n  awarded Petitioners damages for the taking of the Adjacent Property and the\r\n  Calhoun Road Project.[1]Â \r\n  As to the Property Between the Roads, however, the Referee held the property had\r\n  no value for compensation purposes inasmuch as it could not be used for\r\n  on-premises identification signs.Â  Accordingly, Petitioners were awarded no\r\n  damages for the taking of the Property Between the Roads.Â  The Court of Appeals\r\n  affirmed the Special Refereeâ€™s order.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of\r\n  Appeals err in affirming the Refereeâ€™s holding that the Property Between the\r\n  Roads could not be used for on-premises identification signs?\r\nON-PREMISES SIGNS\r\nThe Property\r\n  Between the Roads is essentially a median which runs through downtown\r\n  Greenwood.Â  Petitioners contend the Referee and Court of Appeals erred in\r\n  holding no signs could be placed on the Property Between the Roads.Â  We agree.\r\nAn â€œOn Premisesâ€\r\n  sign is defined by Regulation as â€œany sign which is designed, intended or used\r\n  to advertise or inform of the principal activity taking place, or the product\r\n  being sold on the property where the sign is located.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 63-342 (Q) (Supp. 2006).Â Â Â  Â Â  \r\nA 1986 Greenwood\r\n  County ordinance states as follows:\r\n\r\n  d) Permanent on premises identification signs for which a\r\n    permit is required:Â  One (1) free-standing identification sign per lot for each\r\n    100 feet, or fraction thereof of street frontage over 200 feet, provided said\r\n    signs shall . . . be located no closer than 5 feet from the nearest property\r\n    line. Â (Emphasis supplied).Â  \r\n\r\nThe Referee held\r\n  an â€œon premisesâ€ sign is required to be located on the actual property where\r\n  the business is located.Â  The Referee found the Property Between the Roads was\r\n  not contiguous or adjacent to any land where businesses were located, because\r\n  it is separated from any businesses by the existing roads.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed, and went one step further, noting that the 1996 order of\r\n  Judge Macaulay stated that â€œ[a]s to that portion of the former right-of-way\r\n  covered by streets, highways, and sidewalks for more than 20 years . . ., the\r\n  title lies in the City, County, and Highway Department.â€Â  Based upon the 1996\r\n  order,Â  the Court of Appeals found SCDOT owns the portion of the land upon\r\n  which the roads are situated,[2] such that the Property Between the Roads is physically separated from the business\r\n  properties and is not contiguous, adjacent to, or adjoining such properties.Â  Eldridge\r\n    v. Depâ€™t of Transp., Op. No. 2007-UP-351 (Ct. App. filed July 11, 2007). Â We\r\n  find the Court of Appeals and Referee placed too strict a construction on the definition\r\n  of â€œon premises.â€Â  \r\nIn Keane v.\r\n  Hodge, 292 S.C. 459, 357 S.E.2d 193 (Ct. App. 1987), the Court of Appeals\r\n  addressed a situation in which the Petitioners wished to erect a sign on their\r\n  easement, and the Hilton Head Board of Adjustment revoked their sign permit on\r\n  the ground that the easement was not appurtenant to the property it served,\r\n  such that Petitionersâ€™ proposed sign was not â€œon premisesâ€ but off premises.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding the easement was part of Petitionersâ€™\r\n  property, such that the sign was in fact on premises.[3]Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Keane,\r\n  the Court of Appeals stated, â€œ[O]rdinances in derogation of natural rights of\r\n  persons over their property are to be strictly construed as they are in\r\n  derogation of the common law right to use private property so as to realize its\r\n  highest utility and should not be impliedly extended to cases not clearly\r\n  within their scope and purpose.â€Â  292 S.C. at 464, 357 S.E.2d at 196, citing\r\n  Purdy v. Moise, 223 S.C. 298, 302, 75 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1953).Â Â  \r\nMore recently,\r\n  however, this Court acknowledged that the term â€œcontiguousâ€ has been broadly\r\n  interpreted.Â  Sonoco v. SC Depâ€™t of Revenue, 378 S.C. 385, 662 S.E.2d\r\n  599 (2008), citing Kizer v. Clark, 360 S.C. 86, 90-91, 600 S.E.2d\r\n  529, 532 (2004) (recognizing that marshlands and creeks do not defeat townâ€™s\r\n  contiguity for annexation purposes); Mosteller v. County of Lexington,\r\n  336 S.C. 360, 364-65, 520 S.E.2d 620, 623 (1999) (explaining the term\r\n  â€œcontiguousâ€ and stating â€œâ€˜[a]butâ€™ means to be contiguous . . . [h]owever, abut\r\n  does not always mean there must be actual contactâ€).Â  \r\nIn Sonoco,\r\n  we went further and distinguished between â€œcontiguousâ€ in a lay or secondary\r\n  sense, versus in legal contemplation, stating, â€œIn the legal field, it has been\r\n  defined as: â€˜[i]n close proximity; neighboring; adjoining; near in succession;\r\n  in actual close contact; touching at a point or along a boundary; bounded by or\r\n  traversed by.â€™ Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 290 (5th ed.1979).â€Â  378 S.C. at 391, 662\r\n  S.E.2d at 602.Â  Significantly, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-3-305 is also cited in Sonoco;\r\n  it states, in part: \r\n\r\n  For purposes of this chapter, â€œcontiguousâ€ means property which is\r\n    adjacent to a municipality and shares a continuous border.Â  Contiguity is not\r\n    established by a road, waterway, right-of-way, easement, railroad track,\r\n    marshland, or utility line which connects one property to another; however, if\r\n    the connecting road, waterway, easement, railroad track, marshland, or utility\r\n    line intervenes between two properties, which but for the intervening connector\r\n    would be adjacent and share a continuous border, the intervening connector does\r\n    not destroy contiguity.\r\n\r\nIn Sonoco,\r\n  we ultimately held a taxpayerâ€™s office buildings were subject to property tax\r\n  because the public road and railroad tracks did not defeat contiguity of the\r\n  plant and office buildings.Â  We find the issue presented here is squarely\r\n  controlled by our opinion in Sonoco; we find the contiguity requirement\r\n  is met here such that for purposes of the applicable ordinance, the signs may\r\n  be considered â€œon premises.â€Â Â  \r\nFurther support\r\n  for this result is found in the definition of â€œadjacent.â€ Blackâ€™s Law\r\n    Dictionary, 38 (5th Ed. 1979) defines it adjacent as â€œlying near or close\r\n  to; sometimes, contiguous, neighboring.Â  Adjacent implies that the two objects\r\n  are not widely separated, though they may not actually touch.â€Â Â  \r\nWe find the Court\r\n  of Appeals and Referee unduly restricted the definition of â€œon premises.â€Â Â \r\n  Given the liberal construction afforded the definition of â€œcontiguityâ€ in Sonoco,\r\n  we find the Property Between the Roadâ€™s separation by the roadway does not\r\n  defeat contiguity, such that the signs may be considered â€œon premisesâ€ for\r\n  purposes of the ordinance.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals opinion is\r\n  reversed, and the case is remanded to the Referee for calculation of damages.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY, J., and Acting Justice Timothy M. Cain, concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Because an intervening landowner\r\n  separates the Property Between the Roads and the Adjacent Property, I would\r\n  find that a sign placed on the former would not have constituted an\r\n  â€œon-premises identification signâ€ under the Greenwood County ordinances.Â \r\n  Consequently, the Court of Appeals correctly upheld the determination of the\r\n  special referee that the Property Between the Roads could not be used for\r\n  identification signs.\r\nIn my view, neither Sonoco\r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 378 S.C. 385, 662 S.E.2d 599 (2008), nor\r\n  case law on municipal annexation are dispositive.Â  The special referee first\r\n  invoked the word â€œcontiguousâ€ in attempting to determine whether a sign placed\r\n  on the Property Between the Roads would be considered â€œon premisesâ€ of the\r\n  Adjacent Property, for purposes of a Greenwood County Regulation.Â  The referee\r\n  took the term from Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways and Pub.\r\n    Transp., 287 S.C. 108, 336 S.E.2d 879 (Ct. App. 1985), which cited South\r\n  Carolina Regulation 63-342(Z).Â  The Regulation provided in part:\r\n\r\n  On-Premise\r\n    Sign, shall consist of any outdoor sign, display, device, figure, painting,\r\n    drawing, message, plaque, poster, billboard, or other thing which is designed,\r\n    intended or used to advertise or inform of the activity taking place on the\r\n    property where located, and any additional surrounding land which is under\r\n    lease or is owned in fee simple and is specifically reserved for use by said\r\n    activity.Â  Land considered for this purpose shall be contiguous with the land\r\n    occupied by the commercial or industrial activity and shall not be connected by\r\n    narrow bands or strips of land.Â  The area between the main building and the\r\n    advertising device must be improved and landscaped in a suitable manner so as\r\n    to portray a single unit.\r\n\r\n25A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 63-342(Z) (1985).\r\nIn my view, the broad\r\n  definition of â€œcontiguousâ€ developed in annexation statutes and case law is not\r\n  relevant to and does not comport with the term as it was used in defining an\r\n  â€œon-premiseâ€ sign.Â  Given that SCDOT holds title to the roadway separating the\r\n  properties rather than a mere easement,[4] I would hold that a sign placed on the Property Between the Roads is not an\r\n  â€œon-premises identification signâ€ of any business located on the Adjacent\r\n  Property.\r\nThe dispute over this land\r\n  began over two decades ago and I would take this opportunity to bring it to a\r\n  close.Â  I would affirm the Court of Appeals.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  No appeal is taken as to these awards.\r\n[2]Â  We concur in this holding.\r\n[3]Â  SCDOT also cites Young v. SC\r\n  Depâ€™t of Hwys and Public Transp., 278 S.C. 108, 336 S.E.2d 879 (Ct. App.\r\n  1985).Â  Young, however, merely cites Regulation 63-342 for the\r\n  proposition that â€œon-premise signs are located contiguous with the land\r\n  occupied by the commercial or industrial activity.â€\r\n[4] The Court of Appeals found that because Petitioners\r\n  did not appeal from Judge Macaulayâ€™s 1996 order, it became the law of the\r\n  case.Â  Eldridge v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., Op. No. 2007-UP-351\r\n  (Ct. App. filed July 11, 2007).Â  The Court of Appeals interpreted the order as\r\n  holding that SCDOT owns the portion of the land upon which the roads are\r\n  situated.Â  Id.Â  On certiorari, Petitioners do not challenge the Court of\r\n  Appeals interpretation of the order and it therefore must be accepted as the\r\n  law of the case.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp;\r\n    Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding that an\r\n  unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).\r\n[5] See Rule 220(c), SCACR (2008) (appellate court may affirm upon any\r\n  ground appearing in the Record on Appeal).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Irby E.

Hackett, Staff Attorney, both of\r\n          Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        Desa A.\r\n          Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the\r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a definite suspension from\r\n  the practice of law for twelve months.Â  Respondent requests that the suspension\r\n  be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension, June 27, 2008.Â  In\r\n    the Matter of Walters, 378 S.C. 596, 663 S.E.2d 482 (2008).Â  We accept the\r\n  agreement and impose a definite suspension of twelve months, retroactive to the\r\n  date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the\r\n  agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nFrom April 2003 through\r\n  October 2004, respondent committed a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 4 in\r\n  that, although he had knowledge of the actual commission of bank fraud, he\r\n  concealed the information by failing to inform a judge or other person in\r\n  authority of the felony.Â  The Acting United States Attorney charged respondent\r\n  by Information and respondent pled guilty on June 18, 2008.Â  On October 17,\r\n  2008, respondent was sentenced to twenty-four (24) months probation,\r\n  performance of 100 hours of community service, and participation in the home confinement\r\n  program with electronic monitoring for a period of four (4) months.Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent was ordered to pay a fine of $3,000 and a special\r\n  assessment of $100. \r\nRespondent self-reported\r\n  this matter to ODC. Â Â Â \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent completed a\r\n  series of closings on the same piece of property.Â  The last of the closings was\r\n  for Mr. and Mrs. Doe who were the buyers of the property.Â  At the time of that\r\n  closing, the mortgage on the property was to be paid from the closing proceeds,\r\n  however, it was not satisfied of record and no release was executed and filed.Â \r\n  This failure complicated Mr. and Mrs. Doeâ€™s attempt to sell the property at a\r\n  later date.Â  Respondent claims he did not personally receive notice of the\r\n  issues regarding the property until after Mr. and Mrs. Doe obtained the\r\n  satisfactions they required. \r\nÂ Respondent admits he had\r\n  previously represented a prior purchaser of the same property and that he\r\n  failed to insure that the proper releases and/or satisfactions were filed by\r\n  the lender after the July 7, 2005 closing.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation);\r\n    Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a\r\n    matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule\r\n    8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b)\r\n    (lawyer shall not commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the\r\n  lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects);\r\n  and Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage\r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation).Â  He\r\n  further admits that\r\n  his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction\r\n  regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be ground\r\n  for discipline for lawyer to be convicted of serious crime or crime of moral\r\n  turpitude), and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring\r\n  the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an\r\n  unfitness to practice law).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and impose a definite suspension of twelve months from the\r\n  practice of law, retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim\r\n  suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall\r\n  file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with\r\n  Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.[1]\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent shall not file a Petition for\r\n  Reinstatement until he has completed all conditions of his sentence.Â  See Rule 33, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of William E.
