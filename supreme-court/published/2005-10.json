Pieper, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26046\r\nHeard June 16, 2005 - Filed October 3, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Robert D. Cook, Senior Assistant Attorney General C. Havird Jones, Jr., and Assistant Attorney General Elizabeth R. McMahon, all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJames M. Griffin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This appeal raises the novel issue of whether a party has a right to a jury trial, under the state constitution, in a civil forfeiture proceeding involving an allegedly illegal video gaming machine.Â  We certified this case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, on the motion of Appellant, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED).Â  We now reverse the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that a right to a jury trial exists in such a case.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nLaw enforcement officials seized a Safari Skill video game belonging to Mims Amusement Co. (Owner) from a sports bar and grill in Berkeley County.Â  SLED agents presented the machine to a magistrate pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2712 (2000).Â  The magistrate found the machine was an illegal gambling device in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2710 (2000) and ordered its destruction.\r\nOwner moved for a post-seizure hearing and demanded a jury trial on the factual issue of whether the machine was an illegal gambling device.Â  The magistrate granted a post-seizure hearing to Owner, but denied the request for a jury trial.Â  Owner appealed the denial of its request for a jury trial to the circuit court.\r\nThe circuit court determined that all devices seized pursuant to Section 12-21-2710 are not necessarily illegal gambling devices because a magistrate must, as required by Section 12-21-2712, make a factual determination on the legality of a particular machine.Â  The circuit court remanded the case to the magistrate, with instructions that when the magistrate finds there is no factual dispute about the illegality of the machine, then it may order the machine destroyed pursuant to the statute.Â  However, when there is a factual dispute about the illegality of a particular machine, Owner is entitled to a jury trial to determine the issue.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in ruling that the owner of a video game machine seized by law enforcement authorities has a constitutional right to a jury trial in a civil forfeiture proceeding to determine whether the machine is an illegal gambling device?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a case raising a novel question of law, the Court is free to decide the question with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  The Court must decide the question based on its assessment of which answer and reasoning best comport with the law and public policies of this state and the Courtâ€™s sense of law, justice, and right.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004), and S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2004)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partnership, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (same); Antley v. New York Life Ins. Co., 139 S.C. 23, 30, 137 S.E. 199, 201 (1927) (â€œIn [a] state of conflict between the decisions, it is up to the court to â€˜choose ye this day whom ye will serveâ€™; and, in the duty of this decision, the court has the right to determine which doctrine best appeals to its sense of law, justice, and right.â€). \r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nSLED argues the circuit court erred in ruling the owner of a video gaming machine seized by law enforcement authorities has a constitutional right to a jury trial in a civil forfeiture proceeding to determine whether the machine is an illegal gambling device.Â  SLED contends the ruling was erroneous because (1) a video game machine which violates the statute is contraband per se, just as illegal liquor or drugs, because an illegal gambling device does not have a normally lawful purpose; (2) the magistrateâ€™s determination of whether a machine is an illegal gambling device is not the type of case in which the right to a jury trial was secured at the time of the adoption of the state constitution; (3) this Court has recognized that illegal gambling devices are contraband per se, and the due process required is a post-seizure hearing before a magistrate to show why a particular machine should not be forfeited; (4) the courts have never granted a jury trial in the seizure and destruction of illegal gambling devices; and (5) the forfeiture of illegal gambling devices is a strong deterrent to the possession and operation of such a devices, and granting a right to a jury trial would undermine the deterrent effect and cause unnecessary delays and problems in enforcement of the law.\r\nIn response, Owner contends (1) the State may not deprive an owner of his property without due process of law, which in this instance includes the right to a jury trial; (2) the state constitution, this Courtâ€™s precedent, and court rules guarantee Owner a right to a jury trial in magistrateâ€™s court to determine the legality of a particular machine; (3) a video game machine is not contraband per se because it may normally be used for lawful purposes, provided it is not in violation of Section 12-21-2710; and (4) whether a particular machine is an illegal game of chance or a legal game of skill may involve a material factual dispute which a party has a right to ask a jury to resolve.\r\nWe decide this case in light of the recent history of video gambling in South Carolina, which mushroomed from a rather clandestine and inauspicious beginning in 1986 into a multi-billion dollar business by its demise in July 2000.Â  See e.g. Johnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., 88 F. Supp. 2d 499 (D.S.C. 1999) (outlining the below-the-radar development of $2.5 billion video poker industry in South Carolina, legislative attempts to regulate it, and state appellate court decisions on issues relating to the industry), vacated by Johnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., 199 F.3d 710 (4th Cir. 1999) (vacating district courtâ€™s order because it improperly ruled on unsettled issues of state law); Westside Quik Shop, Inc. v. Stewart, 341 S.C. 297, 534 S.E.2d 270 (2000) (tracing history of anti-gambling statutes and subtle development of video poker industry); Johnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., 349 S.C. 613, 564 S.E.2d 653 (2002) (addressing various certified questions from district court relating to special inducements and cash payouts by video poker operators); Joytime Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 528 S.E.2d 647 (1999) (Court enjoined a public referendum as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority; Court further held statutory ban on cash payouts by video poker operators was severable from unconstitutional provision and thus enforceable as of July 1, 2000).[1] Â Â Â  \r\nGaming devices in general have long been recognized as legitimately within the police power of the State to control or take by forfeiture.Â  Westside Quik Shop, Inc. v. Stewart, 341 S.C. 297, 303, 534 S.E.2d 270, 273 (2000) (citing Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S. 133, 136 (1894)).Â  Gaming machines have been illegal and subject to forfeiture as contraband in this state since the 1930s.Â  Id. at 300, 534 S.E.2d at 271.Â  This Court consistently has deferred to the Legislatureâ€™s determination of which gaming devices must be sacrificed for the public welfare.Â  Furthermore, forfeiture serves a deterrent purpose both by preventing the further illicit use of the property and by imposing an economic penalty, thereby rendering the illegal behavior unprofitable.Â  Id. at 304, 534 S.E.2d at 273 (citing Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U.S. 442, 452 (1996) and Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663, 686-87 (1974)).\r\nAn action for forfeiture of property is a civil action at law.Â  192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. at 184, 525 S.E.2d at 876; State v. Petty, 270 S.C. 206, 208, 241 S.E.2d 561, 562 (1978).Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2712 (2000),[2] video gaming machines that are operated or possessed in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2710 (2000)[3] are subject to forfeiture as contraband per se.Â  Westside Quik Shop, 341 S.C. at 303, 534 S.E.2d at 273; 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. at 189, 525 S.E.2d at 879.Â  A claimantâ€™s right to due process of law in the seizure of video game machines is satisfied when he receives a post-seizure hearing, and due process does not mandate a pre-seizure hearing.Â  192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. at 196-97, 525 S.E.2d at 883.Â  Thus, we have decided that machines declared illegal by a magistrate or conceded to be illegal by the owner are contraband per se, and a claimant is entitled only to a post-seizure hearing.\r\nIn support of its argument, Owner points to this Courtâ€™s observation in State v. Kizer, 164 S.C. 383, 162 S.E. 444 (1932), that owners of nickel slot machines could have brought a claim and delivery action, to be tried before a jury, rather than continually and improperly seeking injunctions to prevent law enforcement authorities from seizing particular machines.Â  We have overruled Kizer â€œto the extent it permits the destruction of allegedly illegal property without any opportunity for the owner to contest the magistrateâ€™s determination of illegality.â€Â  192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. at 196-97, 525 S.E.2d at 883 (emphasis added).Â  We held in 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines that examination of a video gaming machine in magistrateâ€™s court, with the availability of a post-seizure hearing, provides adequate due process to the machineâ€™s owner; consequently, a claim and delivery action is neither necessary nor allowed.Â  Neither Kizer nor more recent authority resolves the issue at hand, which is whether a claimant has a right to demand that a jury, instead of only a judge, determine whether a particular machine is illegal and therefore subject to seizure and destruction as contraband per se.\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution provides â€œthe right of trial by jury shall be preserved inviolate.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.Â  The right to a trial by jury is guaranteed in every case in which the right to a jury was secured at the time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1868.Â  Medlock v. 1985 Ford F-150 Pickup, 308 S.C. 68, 70-71, 417 S.E.2d 85, 86 (1992).Â  The right to a jury trial encompasses forms of action that have arisen since the adoption of the Constitution in those cases where the later actions are of like nature to actions which were triable at common law at the time of the adoption of theÂ  Constitution.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Legislature may not abrogate the right to a jury trial simply by designating a proceeding as a civil action without a jury.Â  1985 Ford F-150 Pickup, 308 S.C. at 72, 417 S.E.2d at 87.Â  The Court has the final responsibility of construing the constitution and laws of this state, and must do so without concern for political or popular opinion.Â  E.g. Martin v. Condon, 324 S.C. 183, 189, 478 S.E.2d 272, 275 (1996); Evatte v. Cass, 217 S.C. 62, 65, 59 S.E.2d 638, 639 (1950); see also Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).\r\nCourts have recognized two classes of contraband subject to forfeiture by statute.Â  The first class is contraband per se, which are things that may be forfeited because they are illegal to possess and not susceptible of ownership.Â  This class includes illegal gambling devices such as roulette wheels or craps tables, â€œmoonshineâ€ liquor, illegal narcotic drugs, or unregistered guns.Â  The second class is derivative contraband, which are things that may be forfeited because they are instrumentalities of a crime, but which ordinarily are not illegal to possess.Â  This class includes items such as currency, vehicles, or real property used in the commission of a crime or traceable to the proceeds of criminal activity.Â  See State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 189, 525 S.E.2d 872, 879 (2000) (discussing two classes of contraband and determining that video game machines found by magistrate to be illegal gambling devices or conceded by owner to be such are contraband per se); U.S. v. Rodriguez Aguirre, 264 F.3d 1195, 1213 n.13 (10th Cir. 2001) (cocaine is contraband per se; automobile used in bank robbery is derivative contraband); State v. Edwards, 787 So.2d 981, 988-89 (La. 2001) (discussing two classes of contraband); People ex rel. Oâ€™Malley v. 6323 North LaCrosse Ave., 634 N.E.2d 743, 746 (Ill. 1994) (â€œContraband per se consists of items which are inherently illegal to possess.Â  There is a vast difference between the forfeiture of contraband per se and the forfeiture, by an innocent third party, of legal property - in this case a residence.â€); People v. One 1941 Chevrolet Coupe, 231 P.2d 832, 843 (Cal. 1951) (distinguishing between derivative contraband such as automobile and contraband per se or public nuisances per se such as gambling paraphernalia, counterfeit coins, diseased cattle, or decayed fruit and fish); State ex rel. Brett v. Four Bell Fruit Gum Slot Machines, 162 P.2d 539 (Okla. 1945) (slot machines are contraband per se); Frost v. People, 61 N.E. 1054, 1056 (Ill. 1901) (craps tables and roulette wheel are contraband per se because they â€œhad no value or use for any other purpose than that of gamblingâ€); City of Chicago v. Taylor, 774 N.E.2d 22, 31 (Ill. App. 1 Dist. 2002) (unregistered gun is contraband per se in locality which requires registration of guns).[4]\r\nA property interest in derivative contraband is not extinguished automatically if the property is used unlawfully; therefore, forfeiture of such property is permitted only as authorized by statute and in compliance with the safeguards of due process.Â  See U.S. v. $8,850 in U.S. Currency, 461 U.S. 555 (1983) (eighteen-month delay by government in filing civil forfeiture action did not constitute violation of due process under circumstances of case); U.S. v. $23,407.69 in U.S. Currency, 715 F.2d 162 (5th Cir. 1983) (due process requires government to explain and justify substantial delay in seeking civil forfeiture of seized property); Aguirre, 264 F.3d at 1213 n.13 (same); ); State v. Curran, 628 P.2d 1198, 1203 (Or. 1981) (distinguishing between contraband per se and derivative contraband, with the latter afforded greater legal protection than property which is inherently injurious to public welfare).Â  \r\nIn 1985 Ford F-150 Pickup, we addressed the ownerâ€™s right to a jury trial in the civil forfeiture of a pickup truck, an item of derivative contraband which normally is used for lawful purposes.Â  The State seized the truck pursuant to a statute forfeiting property used to produce or distribute illegal drugs.Â  We held that a right to a jury trial in such a proceeding existed when the state Constitution was adopted in 1868.Â  1985 Ford F-150 Pickup, 308 S.C. at 70-71, 417 S.E.2d at 86.\r\nWe further reasoned that, while an owner generally has the statutory right to replevy against the state for property wrongfully detained, items seized as a result of illegal drug offenses are not subject to replevin.Â  Instead, the items are considered to be in the custody of the department making the seizure, subject only to the orders of the court having jurisdiction over the forfeiture proceeding.Â  Property described in the drug forfeiture statute is forfeited and transferred to the government at the moment of illegal use, and the subsequent seizure and forfeiture proceeding merely confirm the transfer.Â  Id. at 71-72, 417 S.E.2d at 87.Â  Consequently, owners of seized property have a right to a jury trial in a civil forfeiture proceeding involving derivative contraband, i.e., when the property subject to forfeiture normally is used for lawful purposes.Â  Id.; Gossett v. Gilliam, 317 S.C. 82, 87, 452 S.E.2d 6, 8 (Ct. App. 1994) (recognizing same principle). \r\nIn 1985 Ford F-150 Pickup, we adopted the majority view on the issue of jury trials in civil forfeiture proceedings involving derivative contraband.Â  See e.g. State v. One 1981 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 728 A.2d 1259 (Me. 1999) (party in interest to an in rem civil forfeiture proceeding involving a vehicle and money, seized as a result of drug law violations, has a right to a jury trial under Maine Constitution); Idaho Dept. of Law Enforcement By and Through Cade v. Free, 885 P.2d 381, 386 (Idaho 1994) (finding a right to jury trial in civil forfeiture proceeding because that right existed at common law when Idaho Constitution was adopted); People ex rel. Oâ€™Malley v. 6323 North LaCrosse Ave., 634 N.E.2d 743 (Ill. 1994) (in civil forfeiture proceeding involving real property used to facilitate drug trafficking, Illinois Constitutionâ€™s jury trial provision mandates that claimant has right to jury trial; statute which denied such right was unconstitutional); Com. v. One 1984 Z-28 Camaro Coupe, 610 A.2d 36 (Pa. 1992) (owner of property subject to forfeiture under Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act, in this case a vehicle, is entitled to jury trial under Pennsylvania Constitution); Department of Law Enforcement v. Real Property, 588 So.2d 957, 967 (Fla. 1991) (forfeiture of property seized as a result of drug law violations must be decided by jury trial unless claimant waives that right). \r\nThe rule we adopted in 1985 Ford F-150 Pickup also is in accord with statutory and case law of the United States regarding the right to a jury trial in a civil forfeiture proceeding involving derivative contraband.Â  See C.J. Hendry Co. v. Moore, 318 U.S. 133, 152-53 (1943) (Supreme Court â€œhas repeatedly declared that, in cases of forfeiture of articles seized on land for violation of federal statutes, the district courts proceed as courts of common law according to the course of the Exchequer on informations in rem with trial by juryâ€); Garnharts v. U.S., 83 U.S. 162 (1872) (claimant whose goods have been seized on land for violation of internal revenue laws is entitled to trial by jury when he appears and denies facts charged in the information); U.S. v. One Lincoln Navigator 1998, 328 F.3d 1011 (8th Cir. 2003) (claimant has Seventh Amendment right to jury trial in federal non-admiralty civil forfeiture proceedings); U.S. v. One 1976 Mercedes Benz 280S, 618 F.2d 453 (7th Cir. 1980) (history and development of right to jury trial in civil forfeiture proceedings, and holding claimant entitled to jury trial); 8 James W. Moore et al., Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice Â§ 38.33[16][a] (3d ed. 2005) (most forfeiture statutes expressly provide for jury trial, but right exists in governmentâ€™s seizure of property which occurs on land even in absence of statutory provision).\r\nThe controlling question we must answer, then, is whether a video gaming machine - at the moment of seizure - is an item of contraband per se or derivative contraband.Â  Is the unexamined machine more like a roulette wheel or an automobile?Â  If it is the former, a claimant has no right to a jury trial; if it is the latter, a claimant has a right to a jury trial.Â  The parties have not cited and we have not found a case involving a video gaming machine in which a court has decided this precise issue.Â  \r\nWe conclude, based on our precedent addressing an ownerâ€™s right to adequate due process in the forfeiture of a machine and the statutory regulation of the video gaming business, that a video gaming machine constitutes contraband per se at the moment it is seized by authorities.Â  Section 12-21-2710 provides that\r\n\r\nit is unlawful for any person to keep on his premises or operate or permit to be kept on his premises or operated within this State any . . . video game machine with a free play feature operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of value . . . for the play of poker, blackjack, keno, lotto, bingo, or craps, or any machine or device licensed pursuant to Section 12-21-2720 and used for gambling . . . or other device pertaining to games of chance of whatever name or kind, including those machines, boards, or other devices that display different pictures, words, or symbols, at different plays or different numbers, whether in words or figures or, which deposit tokens or coins at regular intervals or in varying numbers to the player or in the machine . . . .â€\r\n\r\nSection 12-21-2710 exempts from its provisions legal vending machines which give a uniform and fair return in value for each coin deposited and in which there is no element of chance.Â  It is apparent, however, that an allegedly illegal video gaming machine is deemed an unlawful gambling device at the moment of seizure, i.e., the machine is contraband per se because it is illegal to possess and not susceptible of ownership.Â  Moreover, this conclusion is appropriate in light of South Carolinaâ€™s long-established statutory prohibitions on the ownership or use of specified gambling devices, including video gambling devices developed in recent years.Â  See Johnson, 88 F. Supp. 2d at 502 n.1 (â€œ[l]egislation designed to control â€˜the mischiefs of gamblingâ€™ was enacted by the South Carolina colonial legislature in 1712â€).Â  Accordingly, we conclude that a seized video gaming machine constitutes contraband per se in the nature of a roulette wheel, and is not in the nature of derivative contraband such as a vehicle or parcel of real property normally used for lawful purposes.\r\nThe owner of an item deemed contraband per se does not enjoy a constitutional right to a jury trial.Â  In Frost v. People, 61 N.E. 1054 (Ill. 1901), the appellant argued he had a right to a jury trial in the seizure and destruction of illegal gambling devices, which included two craps tables and a roulette wheel.Â  The Illinois Supreme Court disagreed.\r\n\r\nTrial by jury was never a right in summary proceedings, and the legislature did not violate the constitution by providing that gaming implements and apparatus should be destroyed, after a hearing, under the direction of the judge, justice, or court . . . . The legislature has determined that gambling implements and apparatus are pernicious and dangerous to the public welfare, and the keeping of them is an offense prohibited by law.Â  They are therefore not lawful subjects of property, which the law protects, but have ceased to be regarded or treated as property, and are liable to seizure, forfeiture, and destruction without violating any constitutional provision.\r\n\r\nId. at 1056; accord People v. One Pinball Machine, 44 N.E.2d 950, 957 (Ill. App. Dist. 2 1942) (â€œthe seizure of property employed as a gambling device in violation of a statute is a proceeding in rem, and being contraband, the provisions of the Constitution relating to trial by jury and depriving one of his liberty or property without due process of law are inapplicableâ€); Furth v. State, 78 S.W. 759 (Ark. 1904) (rejecting claimantâ€™s demand for jury trial in forfeiture of roulette wheel and other illegal gambling devices under rationale of â€œfish net case,â€ which allows seizure and destruction of property without jury trial when it is of little value or of no practical use except for illegal gambling); State v. Klondike Machine, 57 A. 994 (Vt. 1904) (seizure and destruction of gambling machine kept in public place is valid without the requirement of a jury); Kite v. People, 74 P. 886 (Colo. 1903) (claimant does not have right to jury trial in forfeiture of roulette wheel, which could only be used for illegal gambling); Annots., Right to Jury Trial In Case of Seizure of Property Alleged To Be Illegally Used, 17 A.L.R. 568 Â§ VI (1922) and 50 A.L.R. 97 Â§ VI (1927); Annot., Constitutionality of Statutes Providing for Destruction of Gambling Devices, 14 A.L.R.3d 366 Â§ 4 (1967).\r\nWe recently held that a magistrateâ€™s ruling on legality applies only to the machine before the court.Â  We further observed that a particular video gaming machine may be manipulated so as to change its nature from lawful to unlawful, which is one reason why the legality of a particular machine must be determined on an individual basis at the time of seizure and examination.Â  Allendale County Sheriffâ€™s Office v. Two Chess Challenge II, 361 S.C. 581, 587, 606 S.E.2d 471, 474 (2004).Â  We were not faced with the issue of a right to a jury trial in Allendale and our observation in that case is not dispositive.Â  While a machine ultimately may be shown to be lawful in a post-seizure hearing before a magistrate, it is nevertheless deemed contraband per se at the moment of seizure.Â  We conclude an ownerâ€™s right to due process in the civil forfeiture of a video gaming machine under the state constitution and pertinent statutes is satisfied when he is given a post-seizure hearing before the magistrate, with the right to appeal that ruling to circuit and appellate courts.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-20 (Supp. 2004), Â§ 14-5-340 (1976), Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004), and Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2004).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe owner of a video game machine seized by law enforcement authorities does not have a constitutional right to a jury trial in a civil forfeiture proceeding to determine whether the machine is an illegal gambling device because the device, at the moment of seizure, is deemed an item of contraband per se.Â  The ownerâ€™s constitutional right to due process of law is satisfied by a post-seizure hearing before the magistrate to determine the legality of a machine, with the right to appeal the ruling to higher courts.\r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  South Carolina media have published and aired an untold number of reports on video poker and the debate surrounding it since the 1990s.Â  A Columbia newspaper recently highlighted the history and apparent demise of the business, but noted SLED has seized hundreds of allegedly illegal video gambling machines in thirty-eight counties during the past eighteen months.Â  Clif LeBlanc, Gambling in S.C.:Â  The Debate Rages On, The State D1 (June 26, 2005). \r\n[2]Â  Section 12-21-2712 provides:\r\n\r\nAny machine, board, or other device prohibited by Section 12-21-2710 must be seized by any law enforcement officer and at once taken before any magistrate of the county in which the machine, board, or device is seized who shall immediately examine it, and if satisfied that it is in violation of Section 12-21-2710 or any other law of this State, direct that it be immediately destroyed.\r\n\r\n[3]Â  Section 12-21-2710 provides:\r\n\r\nIt is unlawful for any person to keep on his premises or operate or permit to be kept on his premises or operated within this State any vending or slot machine, or any video game machine with a free play feature operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of value, or other device operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of value for the play of poker, blackjack, keno, lotto, bingo, or craps, or any machine or device licensed pursuant to Section 12-21-2720 and used for gambling or any punch board, pull board, or other device pertaining to games of chance of whatever name or kind, including those machines, boards, or other devices that display different pictures, words, or symbols, at different plays or different numbers, whether in words or figures or, which deposit tokens or coins at regular intervals or in varying numbers to the player or in the machine, but the provisions of this section do not extend to coin-operated nonpayout pin tables, in-line pin games, or to automatic weighing, measuring, musical, and vending machines which are constructed as to give a certain uniform and fair return in value for each coin deposited and in which there is no element of chance.Â  Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for a period of not more than one year, or both.\r\n\r\n[4]Â  The governmentâ€™s seizure of alleged contraband may arise in the context of a civil or criminal forfeiture proceeding.Â  This appeal involves a civil forfeiture proceeding, not a criminal forfeiture proceeding which generally arises during the criminal prosecution of a person.Â  â€œThe critical difference between civil forfeiture and criminal forfeiture is the identity of the defendant.Â  In civil forfeiture, the Government proceeds against a thing (rem).Â  In criminal forfeiture, it proceeds against a human being (personam).Â  Any differences between civil forfeiture and criminal forfeiture arise from the practical and theoretical considerations implicated when the Government proceeds against an inanimate object or a person.â€Â  U.S. v.

(Stonhard) sued Carolina Flooring Specialists, Inc., Daniel Parham, and Manuel Parham (Defendants) alleging, among other things, that Defendants violated the terms of a non-compete agreement.[1]Â  Stonhard is a flooring company that uses a bidding process to gain customers.Â  Stonhard alleges that Defendants established a competing flooring business (Carolina Flooring) while still employed at Stonhard, and used their knowledge of Stonhardâ€™s pricing policy to marginally underbid Stonhard on several occasions.Â  After Stonhard became aware of this conduct, Defendants were fired.Â  Since then, Defendants have continued to operate Carolina Flooring.\r\nWhile employed at Stonhard, Defendants signed a non-compete agreement which provides:\r\n\r\nDuring my employment with Stonhard, and for a period of one (1) year subsequent to termination of employment with Stonhard, regardless of the reason for such termination, I shall not compete with Stonhard by engaging in any activity similar to the activities I undertake during the course of my employment with Stonhard.\r\n\r\nThe agreement also contained a choice-of-law provision stating that New Jersey law applied.Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â  Reformation of Non-Compete Agreement\r\nThe first question is whether a non-compete agreement which does not contain a geographical limitation may be reformed or â€œblue penciledâ€ according to New Jersey law and then enforced in South Carolina.Â  The answer to this question is no.Â  \r\nTerms in a non-compete agreement may be construed according to the law of another state.Â  Standard Register Co. v. Kerrigan, 238 S.C. 54, 70-71, 119 S.E.2d 533, 541-42 (1961).Â  But if the resulting agreement is invalid as a matter of law or contrary to public policy in South Carolina, our courts will not enforce the agreement.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nUnder New Jersey law, a court may modify or â€œblue pencilâ€ a non-compete agreement so as to make its terms reasonable.Â  Karlin v. Weinberg, 390 A.2d 1161, 1168 (N.J. 1978).Â  For example, when a geographical limitation in a non-compete agreement is overly broad, a court may decrease the limitation to make it reasonable, while at the same time continuing to enforce other terms in the agreement.Â  Id.; see also The Community Hosp. Group, Inc. v. More, 869 A.2d 884, 900 (N.J. 2005) (holding that the lower court should have decreased the geographical limitation in the non-compete agreement, and courts should not hesitate to partially enforce an agreement when it is reasonable to do so); Solari Indus., Inc. v. Malady, 264 S.2d 53, 61 (N.J. 1970) (adopting a rule permitting â€œthe total or partial enforcement of noncompetitive agreements to the extent reasonable under the circumstancesâ€). Â \r\nIn the present case, the non-compete agreement does not contain a geographical limitation, and we have been unable to find a single case from New Jersey in which a court has added a geographical term when one was previously omitted.Â  We hold, therefore, that the contract may not be reformed or blue-penciled so as to add an entirely new term to which neither of the parties agreed.\r\nBecause we find no term that may suffice as a substitute for a geographical restriction so as to render the covenant reasonable, we hold that the covenant is unenforceable as against public policy.Â  See Poole v. Incentives Unlimited, Inc., 345 S.C. 378, 548 S.E.2d 207 (2001) (holding that a covenant not to compete is enforceable if it is not detrimental to the public interest, is reasonably limited as to time and territory, and is supported by valuable consideration).Â  The agreement fails to limit the covenant to a particular geographical area.Â  To add and enforce such a term requires this Court to bind these parties to a term that does not reflect the partiesâ€™ original intention.Â  Therefore, we hold that the covenant, despite any reformation, is void and unenforceable as a matter of pubic policy.Â  \r\nII. Damages\r\nThe second certified question is: (1) whether New Jersey law would allow damages to be assessed from the time the alleged breach of the covenant commenced, rather than from the time the covenant is reformed, if reformed; and (2) whether such an award is against South Carolina public policy.\r\nWe have no case in South Carolina or from the Fourth Circuit that has granted any relief other than injunctive relief for breach of a covenant not to compete.Â  We are also unwilling to hold a party liable for breach of contract when the contract was void at the time of the alleged breach. Â The Second Circuit has ruled that an assessment of damages should relate back to the date the employment relationship was breached, in the same manner as a preliminary injunction.Â  A. N. Deringer, Inc. v. Strough, 103 F.3d 243 (2d Cir. 1996).Â  \r\nBecause we have held that the covenant is unenforceable, the answer to this certified question is no.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Extending the Expiration Date\r\nStonhard argues that equity and South Carolina public policy allows the district court to extend the expiration date of the covenant beyond the one-year time period after the Defendantsâ€™ termination of employment, which is provided in the contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nEven if equity and public policy allowed this Court to extend the time period of the covenant, the partiesâ€™ original agreement fails to provide any guidance as to exactly how long the covenantâ€™s expiration date could be extended.Â  The covenant provides that, should Defendantsâ€™ employment be terminated, Defendants will not compete with Stonhard for one year after the date of termination.\r\nAccordingly, any extension of the time period would be against public policy, because it would be arbitrary and set precedent allowing a court to disrupt a partyâ€™s private right to contract. \r\nConclusion\r\nWe hold that the non-compete agreement may not be reformed in accordance with New Jersey law and then enforced in South Carolina.Â  The absence of a geographical limitation makes the agreement void as a matter of law.Â Â  New Jerseyâ€™s â€œblue pencilingâ€ law, though appearing to provide a court with the discretion to rewrite unreasonable provisions, does not allow a provision to be written into a covenant when such a provision never previously existed.Â  Even if the agreement could be reformed in this manner under New Jersey law, the agreement would be unenforceable in South Carolina because the very act of adding a term not negotiated and agreed upon by the parties violates public policy. \r\nTherefore, the answer to each certified question is no.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that New Jersey would not permit this non-compete clause to be â€œblue-penciledâ€ to include a geographical limitation, and that therefore the answer to the first certified question is â€œNo.â€Â  Accordingly, I join only Part I of the majorityâ€™s decision as I would not reach the remaining questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The enforcement of the non-compete agreement forms the subject of the questions before this Court. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26048","title":"Hitachi Electronic Devices (USA), Inc. v.

Burwell, both of Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  This is a breach-of-contract action involving a contract for the sale of goods.Â  By consent of the parties, the action was tried by a master-in-equity, who ordered judgment for the petitioners (the Seller) and the other defendants.Â  In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded the case for trial.Â  Hitachi Elec. Devices (USA), Inc. v. Platinum Tech., Inc., Op. No. 2003-UP-766 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 31, 2003).Â  We granted a writ of certiorari and now reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Seller sold goods to the respondent (the Buyer).Â  The sales contract contained a warranty of performance, but the contract also provided for a particular remedy in the event of a breach of that warranty: repair the goods, replace the goods, or refund the purchase price.[1]Â  \r\nApproximately one year after taking delivery of the goods, the Buyer returned them to the Seller claiming rejection of the goods as non-conforming and demanding a refund of the purchase price.Â  The Seller refused, and the Buyer brought this action.Â  \r\nThe master ruled in favor of the Seller.Â  The master held that the Buyer had accepted the goods because the Buyer had failed to reject them within a reasonable time after their delivery, as required by article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code[2] (the U.C.C. or the Code).Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-602(1) (2003). Â The master also held that the Buyer had failed to give notice of breach to the Seller within a reasonable time after taking delivery, another article 2 requirement.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-607(3)(a) (2003).Â  Consequently, the master held, the Buyer was prevented from maintaining its breach-of-contract action.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed.Â  The court affirmed the masterâ€™s holdings that the Buyer had accepted the goods and failed to give seasonable notice of breach.Â  The court disagreed, however, that the failure to give seasonable notice of breach prevented the Buyer from maintaining its action.Â  According to the court, the failure prevented the Buyer from pursuing remedies specifically listed in article 2, but not from maintaining its action as a common-law breach-of-contract action in pursuit of the repair-or-replace remedy and common-law remedies.Â  The court therefore remanded the case for trial on whether the Seller breached and whether the Buyer was entitled to the contractual remedy, common-law remedies, or both.[3]\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n     Whether failure to give timely notice of breach to its seller prevents a buyer of goods from pursuing a contractual remedy intended by the parties to substitute for U.C.C. article 2â€™s default remedies.\r\n    \r\n     Whether a buyer can bring a common-law action to recover common-law remedies for breach of a U.C.C. article 2 warranty.\r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAt this point in the litigation, there is no dispute that article 2 of the U.C.C. applies to the transaction or that the warranty allegedly breached is an article 2 warranty.Â  Likewise, there is no dispute that the Buyer accepted the goods.Â  Acceptance, however, â€œdoes not of itself impair any other remedy provided by [article 2] for nonconformity.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-607(2) (2003).Â  A buyer who has accepted non-conforming goods can, in limited circumstances, revoke acceptance, or he can recover damages for breach of warranty.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 36-2-608 and -714 (2003). Â Â Â Â Â \r\nTo revoke acceptance or recover damages, however, â€œthe buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy ....â€Â  Â§ 36-2-607(3)(a).Â  There is currently no dispute that the Buyer failed to seasonably notify the Seller of the alleged breach of warranty.Â  Only the effect of this failure is disputed.\r\nI.Â  The Repair-or-Replace Remedy\r\nThe Buyerâ€™s failure to give seasonable notice of breach prevents the Buyer from pursuing the repair-or-replace remedy provided in the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ holding to the contrary is reversed. Â Â \r\nAs quoted above, article 2 states that a buyer who has failed to give seasonable notice of breach is â€œbarred from any remedy.â€Â  Â§ 36-2-607(3)(a).Â  â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. ... Where the statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (citations omitted).Â  The phrase â€œany remedyâ€ in section 36-2-607(3)(a) is plain and unambiguous; it encompasses all potential remedies for breach of an article 2 contract.Â  There is no dispute that the repair-or-replace remedy was crafted as a remedy for breach of the partiesâ€™ article 2 contract, so the Buyerâ€™s failure to comply with section 36-2-607(3)(a) bars the Buyer from this remedy.Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion misapprehends that although article 2 permits parties to substitute remedies for article 2â€™s default remedies,[4] the contract remains an article 2 contract.Â  Every other provision of article 2 continues to apply unless the provision is not mandatory and the parties opt out of it.Â  In fact, most sections of the U.C.C. merely provide default terms that can be altered by agreement; only a few are mandatory.[5]\r\nHere, the parties could have agreed that section 36-2-607(3)(a) would not apply in the event of breach.Â  The parties could have agreed that notice of breach would not be required at all, or they could have agreed upon a specific method of giving notice and a specific time frame within which to give it.Â  Since the parties did not opt out of section 36-2-607(3)(a), seasonable notice of breach of warranty was a condition precedent to the Sellerâ€™s obligation to fulfill its remedial promise to repair, replace, or refund.Â  \r\nII.Â  Common-Law Remedies\r\nWe also reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that the Buyerâ€™s failure to comply with section 36-2-607(3)(a) did not prevent it from pursuing common-law remedies for the alleged breach of warranty.Â  Â Â \r\nAs we have stated, the phrase â€œany remedyâ€ in section 36-2-607(3)(a) is plain and unambiguous.Â  It is broad enough to encompass common-law remedies.Â  Thus, a party to an article 2 contract must give seasonable notice of breach in order to recover common-law remedies for breach of that article 2 contract.Â  Here, the Buyer failed to give seasonable notice, so it cannot recover.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding lack of seasonable notice, the Buyer cannot recover the common-law remedies it seeks for a simpler reason: they do not exist.Â  The Buyer alleges that the Seller breached this article 2 contract by breaching its warranty of the goodsâ€™ performance.Â  Remedies for this type of breach are available exclusively under article 2 of the Code.Â  Â Â \r\nOnly where the U.C.C. is incomplete does the common law provide applicable rules.Â  On this point, South Carolina Code section 36-1-103[6] states the following: \r\n\r\n  Unless displaced by the particular provisions of [the  U.C.C.], the principles of law and equity, including  the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to  contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud,  misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy  or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement  its provisions.\r\n\r\nDisplacement occurs when one or more particular provisions of the U.C.C. comprehensively address a particular subject.Â  Flavor-Inn, Inc. v. NCNB Natâ€™l Bank of S.C., 309 S.C. 508, 511, 424 S.E.2d 534, 536 (Ct. App. 1992) (discussing Equitable Life Assurance Socâ€™y of the U.S. v. Okey, 812 F.2d 906, 908-911 (4th Cir. 1987) (applying South Carolina law and explaining that comprehensive treatment of a particular subject by the U.C.C. renders the common law displaced)).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nArticle 2 comprehensively addresses a buyerâ€™s remedies for breach of warranty.Â  A buyerâ€™s first recourse is to reject the non-conforming goods. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-601(a) (2003). Â In some cases, a buyer who has accepted non-conforming goods may revoke his acceptance.Â  See Â§ 36-2-608.Â  Generally, however, the remedy is damages,[7] and the usual measure â€œis the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-714(2) (2003).Â  Article 2 recognizes, however, that in some cases other methods of calculating damages may be more appropriate, and article 2 permits use of any method reasonable under the circumstances.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-714(1)-(2) (2003).Â  In addition, article 2 permits recovery of incidental and consequential damages.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 36-2-714(3) and -715 (2003).Â  This comprehensive system of remedies for breach of warranty displaces the common law.Â  Consequently, the Buyer cannot pursue common-law remedies for the Sellerâ€™s alleged breach of warranty. Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis case involves a contract governed by article 2 of the U.C.C.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that the Buyerâ€™s failure to comply with Code section 36-2-607(3)(a) did not prevent the Buyer from pursuing a contractual or common-law remedy, or both, would effectively render article 2 pointless with respect to breach-of-warranty claims.Â  The decision of the Court of Appeals is therefore \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\nÂ [1] We hereinafter refer to this remedy as the â€œrepair or replace remedy.â€\r\nÂ [2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 36-2-101 to -725 (2003).\r\nÂ [3] Seven members of the Court of Appeals declined to rehear the case en banc.Â  \r\nÂ [4] Article 2 permits parties to agree to â€œremedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in [article 2] and [] limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under [article 2], as by limiting the buyerâ€™s remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of nonconforming goods or parts.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-719(1)(a) (2003).\r\nÂ [5] Section 36-1-102(3) states the following:Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  The effect of provisions of this act may be varied by agreement, except as otherwise provided in this  act and except that the obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness and care prescribed by  this act may not be disclaimed by agreement but  the parties may by agreement determine the standards by which the performance of such  obligations is to be measured if such standards are  not manifestly unreasonable.\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-1-102(3) (2003).\r\n\r\nSection 36-1-102(4) adds that â€œ[t]he presence in certain provisions of this act of the words â€˜unless otherwise agreedâ€™ or words of similar import does not imply that the effect of other provisions may notÂ  be varied by agreement under subsection (3).â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-1-102(4) (2003).Â  \r\nÂ [6] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-1-103 (2003).\r\nÂ [7] The Buyer seeks damages in this case.Â  In fact, the Buyer argues that it is entitled to damages under the common law in addition to the repair-or-replace remedy.Â  Notwithstanding the lack of merit in its arguments for any recovery, the Buyer does not explain why it believes it is entitled to a double recovery. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26049","title":"Glaze v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Adrianne Turner, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES: We granted a writ of certiorari to review the denial of post-conviction relief (PCR) to Petitioner Leroy E. Glaze (Petitioner).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner pleaded guilty to distribution of crack cocaine.Â  During sentencing, Petitionerâ€™s attorney, the State, and the court agreed that Petitionerâ€™s pleas rendered him a three-time offender, meaning the sentence was subject to enhancement.[1]Â  Petitioner was on probation for a South Carolina crack-possession conviction and had a prior conviction from New Jersey for possession of marijuana.\r\nThe trial court first revoked Petitionerâ€™s probation and imposed a five-year sentence for the crack-possession conviction.Â  The trial court also sentenced Petitioner to ten years imprisonment for the crack distribution.Â  The sentences were to run concurrently.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Petitioner argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Petitionerâ€™s being sentenced as a three-time offender.Â  Petitioner asserted that his New Jersey conviction for marijuana possession should not have been considered and that he therefore should have been sentenced as a two-time offender.Â  Petitioner claimed that as the maximum sentence for a three-time offender is greater than that for a two-time offender, the trial courtâ€™s sentencing decision was affected by an error of law. \r\nThe basis for Petitionerâ€™s argument was that because the sentence for the New Jersey marijuana conviction violated his right to counsel under the Fourteenth Amendment,[2]Â  the conviction could not be used to enhance his present sentence. Â In the New Jersey trial, Petitioner was an indigent defendant and had neither waived his right to counsel nor been afforded counsel by the state.Â  He had spent ten days in jail awaiting trial because he could not post bail.Â  According to Petitioner, when the New Jersey court sentenced him to â€œtime served,â€ the court ran afoul of Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 99 S. Ct. 1158, 59 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1979), in which the United States Supreme Court held that absent a valid waiver, an indigent defendant convicted of a misdemeanor without the assistance of counsel cannot be sentenced to any term of imprisonment.Â  Consequently, Petitioner claimed, under Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 114 S. Ct. 1921, 128 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1994), the New Jersey marijuana conviction could not constitutionally be used to enhance his South Carolina sentence for crack-distribution.Â  \r\nThe PCR court held that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to Petitionerâ€™s being sentenced as a three-time offender.Â  The court held that the sentence for the New Jersey conviction was constitutional under Scott v. Illinois and that the conviction was therefore permissibly used for sentence enhancement under Nichols v. United States. Â Thus, the court denied PCR.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the PCR court erred in holding that trial counsel was not Â  ineffective for failing to object to the trial courtâ€™s sentencing Â Â Â Â Â  Petitioner as a three-time offender.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nâ€œTo establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the PCR applicant must establish that trial counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability the result would have been different.â€Â  Patterson v. State, 359 S.C. 115, 117, 597 S.E.2d 150, 151 (2004) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)) (emphasis added).Â  On review, the Court must affirm the factual findings of the PCR court if there is any probative evidence to support them.Â  The Court must reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision if based on an error of law.Â  Hall v. Catoe, 360 S.C. 353, 359, 601 S.E.2d 335, 338 (2004).Â  \r\nIn this case, Petitioner does not argue that the PCR courtâ€™s factual findings are unsupported by the evidence.Â  Rather, the case turns on a narrow issue of law: whether an indigent defendant convicted of a misdemeanor is unconstitutionally denied the right to counsel if he is sentenced to time served after neither waiving his right to counsel nor being provided counsel by the state.Â  We hold that he is not.Â  Consequently, Petitionerâ€™s time-served sentence was constitutional.Â  Trial counsel had no reason to object to the use of Petitionerâ€™s marijuana conviction as a sentence enhancer, thus counselâ€™s performance was not deficient.Â  \r\nIn Argersinger v. Hamlin, the United States Supreme Court held â€œthat absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless he was represented by counsel at his trial.â€Â  407 U.S. 25, 37, 92 S. Ct. 2006, 2012, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530, 538 (1972).Â  In Scott v. Illinois, the Court clarified that when imprisonment is an authorized punishment but is not actually imposed on an unrepresented defendant convicted of a misdemeanor, there is no abrogation of the right to counsel.Â  440 U.S. at 373-74, 99 S. Ct. at 1162, 59 L. Ed. 2d at 389.Â  In other words, actual imprisonment is the event that triggers the right to counsel.Â  Id.Â  Moreover, in Nichols v. United States, the Court held â€œthat an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under Scott because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.â€Â  511 U.S. at 748-49, 114 S. Ct. at 1928, 128 L. Ed. 2d at 755.\r\nHere, Petitioner argues that he was in fact imprisoned for the uncounseled marijuana conviction.Â  After he was arrested, he was unable to post bail and therefore spent ten days in jail while his trial was pending.Â  According to Petitioner, when he was sentenced to time served, he was actually sentenced to a ten-day term of imprisonment; he had just already served it.Â  Because he was not provided an attorney, Petitioner claims, the time-served sentence was invalid under Scott and it was therefore improper under Nichols for the sentencing judge to consider the marijuana conviction.\r\nAlthough Petitioner was nominally sentenced to prison for an uncounseled conviction, his time-served sentence was not in violation of Scott.Â  Petitionerâ€™s proposed application of Scott and Nichols would do nothing to prevent uncounseled losses of liberty.Â  For example, if Petitioner had not been sentenced to time served, but rather to a fine, then he would now have no basis for saying that the marijuana conviction was improperly used for sentence enhancement.Â  A fine for an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is perfectly valid under Scott, so the conviction would have been available as a sentence enhancer under Nichols.Â  Nevertheless, Petitioner still would have spent those ten days in jail. Â \r\nThe proper inquiry under Scott is whether the uncounseled misdemeanor conviction actually resulted in confinement.Â  Compare Nicholson v. State, 761 So.2d 924, 930-31 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000) (holding that a conviction which resulted in a time-served sentence can be used for sentence enhancement), with State v. Oâ€™Neill, 140 Ohio App. 3d 48, 746 N.E.2d 654 (Ct. App. Ohio 7 Dist. 2000) (holding that such a conviction cannot be used for sentence enhancement).Â  The reason that Petitioner spent ten days in jail is he was charged with a misdemeanor and could not post bail.Â  He was subjected to no period of confinement as a result of his uncounseled marijuana conviction, so his time-served sentence did not violate the constitution.Â  Trial counsel therefore had no reason to object based on Nichols to Petitionerâ€™s being sentenced as a three-time offender.Â  Trial counselâ€™s performance was therefore not deficient.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nPetitioner did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  The denial of PCR is \r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] For a first offense of crack distribution, a person â€œmust be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than fifteen years and fined not less than twenty-five thousand dollars.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B)(1) (2002).Â  â€œ[F]or a second offense or if, in the case of a first conviction ... the offender has been convicted of any of the laws of the United States or of any state, territory, or district relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana, depressant, stimulant, or hallucinogenic drugs, the offender must be imprisoned for not more than twenty-five years and fined not less than fifty thousand dollars.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B)(2) (2002).Â  â€œ[F]or a third or subsequent offense or if the offender has been convicted two or more times in the aggregate of any violation of the laws of the United States or of any state, territory, or district relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana, depressant, stimulant, or hallucinogenic drugs, the offender must be imprisoned for not more than thirty years and fined not less than one hundred thousand dollars.â€Â  S.C.

(Terex), Mark Lift Industries, Inc., and BPS Equipment Rental and Sales, Inc. (BPS Equipment).Â  The case was removed to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.Â  Simmonsâ€™ only basis of liability against Terex and Mark Lift Industries is a successor liability theory. \r\nSimmonsâ€™ complaint alleges he was injured in a work-related accident at a construction site on August 9, 1999, when an elevated scissorlift aerial work platform collapsed.Â  Mark Industries (Mark), a California corporation, designed, manufactured and sold the scissorlift in 1990.Â  BPS Equipment sold the scissorlift to the end user, which provided it for use on the construction site.\r\nMark filed for bankruptcy in federal bankruptcy court in July 1991.Â  The bankruptcy court entered an order granting Markâ€™s motion to sell specified assets for adequate consideration on November 6, 1991.Â  Terex was the winning bidder for the assets at an auction the next day.\r\nFollowing the auction, Mark and Terex entered into a purchase agreement.Â  Section 1.1 of the agreement provides:\r\n\r\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, at the Closing . . . all the Assets shall be transferred from seller to Buyer free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, encumbrances, restrictions or rights of others of every kind and description, including, without limitation, tax liens.Â  Nothing herein shall be construed as the assumption of or by Buyer of any liabilities of the Seller, including, without limitation, any liability for products manufactured or sold by Seller.\r\n\r\nUnder the agreement, the assets purchased by Terex included the inventory of supplies, raw materials, work in progress, finished goods, trademarks, service marks, trade names, goodwill, all intellectual property, such as drawings, designs, blueprints, patents, licenses, and technology. \r\nOn November 13, 1991, the bankruptcy court issued an order approving the auction of assets and the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement entered into by Mark and Terex on November 7, 1991.Â  Specifically, the order provided â€œthat [Mark] is authorized to sell the assets of its estate to Terex Corporation, the maker of the highest and best offer at the auction, on terms and conditions consistent with the Purchase Agreement and related attachments.â€Â  The order stated that â€œthe sale of the assets authorized hereby is free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances as may presently attach to the assets. . . .â€Â  The order further stated that the â€œsale of assets shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances of those creditors who had adequate notice of the Debtorâ€™s motion and opportunity to appear and object at the time of the hearing on the Motion. . . .â€ \r\nOn December 5, 1991, Terex created a wholly owned subsidiary to implement the asset purchase agreement between Mark and Terex.Â  The new corporation was named Mark Lift Industries, Inc. (Lift Industries).Â  The assets of Mark were transferred to Lift Industries several days later.\r\nLift Industries continued to manufacture similar scissorlifts at the California plant for several months, until mid-1992.Â  At this time, Lift Industries closed the plant in California, and relocated the assets and equipment to Terexâ€™s manufacturing plant in Waverly, Iowa.Â  Only three Mark employees, none of whom were officers or directors, continued with Terex following the closing of Lift Industriesâ€™ California plant.Â  From 1992 to 2001, Lift Industries marketed and distributed scissorlifts from its Iowa plant using the trade name used by Mark.\r\nTerex did not have any business relationship with Mark until purchasing its assets in the bankruptcy court auction.Â  There has never been any commonality of officers, directors, or stockholders between Mark and Terex. Â Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWe find the certified questions may be resolved in accordance with existing South Carolina authority. \r\nIn Brown v. American Ry. Express Co., 128 S.C. 428, 123 S.E. 97 (1924), this Court held that in the absence of a statute, a successor or purchasing company ordinarily is not liable for the debts of a predecessor or selling company unless (1) there was an agreement to assume such debts, (2) the circumstances surrounding the transaction warrants a finding of a consolidation or merger of the two corporations, (3) the successor company was a mere continuation of the predecessor,[1] or (4) the transaction was entered into fraudulently for the purpose of wrongfully defeating creditorsâ€™ claims.Â  Brown v. American Ry. Express Co., 128 S.C. 428, 123 S.E. 97 (1924) (successor corporation which purchased part of predecessorâ€™s assets was not liable for lost shipment by predecessor, where successor did not assume liability for such debts and predecessor remained a live and going concern with substantial assets).Â  \r\nOur opinion in Brown sets forth the proper test to determine, in a products liability action, whether there is successor liability of a company which purchases the assets of an unrelated company.Â  Certified Question number 2 is answered accordingly.Â  \r\nFurther, we conclude a plaintiff may maintain a state law-based product liability claim under a successor liability theory against a successor corporation which purchased the predecessorâ€™s assets in a voluntary sale approved by the federal bankruptcy court provided one of the exceptions set forth in the Brown opinion applies.Â  Accordingly, we find the District Court in this case may answer Certified Question number 1 by reference to the existing precedent set forth in Brown.Â  \r\nLastly, Terex urges us to find it may not be held liable as a successor because Simmons may seek recovery from the seller, BPS Equipment.Â  Terex asserts that when other entities may answer in damages under a strict liability or negligence theory, it is unnecessary to hold a successor corporation liable in a product liability action.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe find a plaintiff may maintain a product liability claim under a successor liability theory against a defendant when there are one or more other viable product liability defendants.Â  The status and availability of other potential defendants is irrelevant in determining the issue of a successor corporationâ€™s liability in a product liability action.Â  However, as noted in the answer to the first two certified questions, a plaintiff must fall within one of the four exceptions set forth in Brown.\r\nWe hold that each of the certified questions presented in this case may be answered in accordance with our opinion in Brown.\r\n CERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\n MOORE, J., Acting Justices John W. Kittredge and James R. Barber, concur.Â  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Because I believe the mechanical application of the factors recited in Brown v. American Ry. Express Co., 128 S.C. 428, 123 S.E. 97 (1924) without considering the facts which may support a finding of a consolidation, merger or continuation of the predecessor entity result in an injustice to the consumer, I respectfully dissent, in part.\r\nThe facts set forth by the district court and the majority reveal that Plaintiff Simmons alleges he was injured by the collapse of an elevated scissorlift aerial work platform manufactured in 1990 by the predecessor corporation, Mark Industries, Inc. (Mark).Â  Terex and its wholly owned subsidiary, Mark Lift Industries, Inc. (Lift Industries) purchased Markâ€™s assets in bankruptcy in 1991.Â  From December 1991 to September 1992, Terex continued to manufacture the same scissorlift platform as Mark had manufactured at the same California factory - using essentially the same technology, same design, same equipment, same marketing materials, same logo, same tradename, same supplier list, same dealer list, same customer list, and same employees.Â  Terex then moved the factory to Iowa, where from 1992 to 2001 it continued to manufacture the same scissorlift as Mark had manufactured - still using essentially the same technology, same design, same equipment, same marketing, same logo, same tradename, same supplier list, same dealer list, same customer list, and a few of the same employees.Â  \r\nThe federal district court has presented the Court with three questions, which I will address in the following order:\r\n\r\n  1.Â  In the product liability context in South Carolina, what test is employed to determine whether there is successor liability of a company which purchased the assets of an unrelated company?\r\n  2.Â  May a plaintiff maintain a product liability claim in South Carolina under a successor liability theory against a defendant which purchased only assets of a voluntarily bankrupt selling company in an arms-length and court-approved bankruptcy sale and the purchasing company did not approve of, participate in, cause, or contribute to the selling companyâ€™s bankruptcy?\r\n  3.Â  May a plaintiff maintain a product liability claim in South Carolina under a successor liability theory against a defendant when there are one or more other viable product liability defendants that may be liable to the plaintiff as a post-manufacturer seller of the allegedly defective product?\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn answering a certified question raising a novel question of law, this Court is free to decide the question based on its assessment of which answer and reasoning would best comport with the law and public policies of this state and the Courtâ€™s sense of law, justice, and right.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2004), and S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2004)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partnership, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (same); Antley v. New York Life Ins. Co., 139 S.C. 23, 30, 137 S.E. 199, 201 (1927) (â€œIn [a] state of conflict between the decisions, it is up to the court to â€˜choose ye this day whom ye will serveâ€™; and, in the duty of this decision, the court has the right to determine which doctrine best appeals to its sense of law, justice, and right.â€).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  SUCCESSOR LIABILITY AFTER PURCHASE OF ASSETS \r\nSimmons asserts the Court should adopt either of two exceptions to the general rule that a successor corporation which purchases the assets of a predecessor corporation is not liable for the predecessorâ€™s obligations and liabilities.Â  Both exceptions - continuity of enterprise and product line - are grounded in the premise that a person who is injured by a defective product should be able to bring a product liability action against a company which purchases the assets of an unrelated company and then continues manufacturing and distributing essentially the same product using the predecessorâ€™s assets, equipment, intellectual property and goodwill.\r\nTerex contends we should reject both exceptions and instead apply the four traditional exceptions to the rule that a successor corporation, in an asset purchase, usually does not assume the liabilities of the predecessor entity.Â  Terex argues that none of the four exceptions apply in this case, and Simmonsâ€™ lawsuit should be dismissed on a motion for judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\r\nIn South Carolina, in the absence of a statute, a successor or purchasing company ordinarily is not liable for the debts of a predecessor or selling company unless (1) there was an agreement to assume such debts, (2) the circumstances surrounding the transaction warrants a finding of a consolidation or merger of the two corporations,[2] (3) the successor company was a mere continuation of the predecessor, or (4) the transaction was entered into fraudulently for the purpose of wrongfully defeating creditorsâ€™ claims.Â  Brown v. American Ry. Express Co., 128 S.C. 428, 123 S.E. 97 (1924) (successor corporation which purchased part of predecessorâ€™s assets was not liable for lost shipment by predecessor, where successor did not assume liability for such debts and predecessor remained a live and going concern with substantial assets).Â  The case at hand involves the application of the emphasized â€œmere continuationâ€ exception.\r\nCourts nationwide apply the general rule expressed in Brown, which originated in the common law, to determine successor liability in the context of contract and creditor-debtor cases.Â  E.g. Huff v. Shopsmith, Inc., 786 So.2d 383, 388 (Miss. 2001); Niccum v. Hydra Tool Corp., 438 N.W.2d 96, 98 (Minn. 1989); Martin v. Abbott Laboratories, 689 P.2d 368, 384 (Wash. 1984); Schumacher v. Richards Shear Co., 451 N.E.2d 195, 198 (N.Y. 1983); Johnston v. Amsted Indus., Inc., 830 P.2d 1141, 1142-43 (Colo. App. 1992); 15 Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations Â§ 7122 (1999); 1 American Law of Products Liability 3d Â§ 7:1 (2001).\r\nMost courts traditionally have applied the mere continuation exception (also known as a de facto merger) contained in the general rule on successor liability only when there is commonality of ownership, i.e., the predecessor and successor corporations have substantially the same officers, directors, or shareholders, and the business continues largely unchanged.Â  E.g. Taylor v. Atlas Safety Equip. Co., 808 F. Supp. 1246, 1251 (E.D. Va. 1992) (applying Virginia law and stating that continuity of shareholders and management is key element of mere continuation exception); 15 Fletcherâ€™s Cyclopedia Corporations Â§ 7123.20 (discussing expansion of mere continuation exception); 1 American Law of Products Liability 3d Â§Â§ 7:10, 7:14, 7:19 (same); Phillip I. Blumberg, The Continuity of the Enterprise Doctrine:Â  Corporate Successorship in the United States Law, 10 Fla. J. Intl. L. 365, 371 (1996) (listing cases for proposition that mere continuation doctrine applies â€œonly where the successor has the same stockholders as the predecessor and conducts the same business with the same management, facilities, employees, products, and trade namesâ€).\r\nI disagree with the majority that the certified questions may be resolved by relying exclusively on a general rule of corporate law set forth in Brown more than eighty years ago.Â  The Brown court did not resolve the meaning of the mere continuation exception in South Carolina.Â  Brown should be the starting point of our analysis, not the beginning and end of it.\r\nFurthermore, Brown did not involve a bankrupt predecessor corporation or a defective product implicating modern product liability law.Â  Brown was decided in the nascent days of product liability law, a time preceding widespread acceptance of basic product liability principles now well established in this state and elsewhere.Â  In those days, the analysis of product liability cases was grounded primarily in negligence; the concept of strict liability in tort was not even a gleam in the eye of attorneys, judges, and professors who would develop and endorse the concept in the 1960s.Â  \r\nThe mere continuation exception enunciated in Brown - while valid and sufficient under existing law in other settings such as a merger or consolidation - should be interpreted in a manner which encompasses product liability claims against a successor corporation in appropriate circumstances.Â  An examination of the reasoning in Brown, as well as other precedent in this state, supports such an interpretation.\r\nThe basic rationale of the general rule expressed in Brown is obvious.Â  â€œIt would be manifestly unfair, unjust, and contrary to equity that [the successor] should thus acquire all of the assets of the other corporation, and its franchise, both to be, and to do, leaving no one to be sued by its creditors and no property to satisfy its debts and other liabilities, and not itself become responsible for such debts and other liabilities.Â  If [the successor] takes the benefit, it must, as has so often been said, take the burden, which equitably attaches, with it.â€Â  Brown 128 S.C. at 432, 123 S.E. at 99 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn an earlier case involving the same successor corporation as in Brown, but where the predecessor corporation no longer existed and the successor had agreed to resolve outstanding loss and damage claims, this Court rejected the successorâ€™s effort to avoid the claims with unusually strong language. \r\n\r\nThe [successorâ€™s] position does not appeal to us; it is an attempt to dodge the damages that [the plaintiff] has sustained by a quirk and technical question of the law, and smacks too much of a skin game, and hand stacked and dealt to dealer from the bottom of the deck. . . .Â  By its action [the successor] has allowed the [predecessor] to go out of existence and now proposes to let the [plaintiff] whistle for his money, and by its technicality, which would besmirch the character of any honest man, smacks its lips and licks its chops and congratulates itself on its shrewdness in avoiding its payment of a just claim.\r\n\r\nBrabham v. Southern Express Co., 124 S.C. 157, 117 S.E. 368 (1922).\r\nIn a similar vein, this Court has applied a trust-fund doctrine to ensure creditors may reach assets in the hands of the successor corporation when a transaction amounts to a de facto merger or consolidation.Â  See Beckroge v. S.C. Power Co., 197 S.C. 184, 194-95, 15 S.E.2d 124, 128 (1941) (transfer of assets from one corporation to another may amount to a merger in fact even when predecessor corporation continues to exist, particularly when amount paid by successor does not reflect true value of predecessor; in such cases, equity looks past form and at the real effect of the transaction and, by application of the trust fund doctrine, successor may be held liable to prior creditors to extent of assets received); Huggins v. Commercial &amp; Sav. Bank, 141 S.C. 480, 140 S.E. 177 (1927) (successor bank which by transfer obtained all assets of predecessor bank held liable to depositor of predecessor bank); Ex parte Sav. Bank of Rock Hill, 73 S.C. 393, 53 S.E. 614 (1906) (equity regards the property of a corporation as held in trust for the payment of debts, and recognizes the right of creditors to pursue the property wherever it may be transferred unless it has passed into the hands of a bona fide purchaser).\r\nOur appellate courts rarely have addressed successor liability in the context of a tort action and have never done so in a product liability action.Â  In Long v. Carolina Baking Co., 190 S.C. 367, 3 S.E.2d 46 (1939), plaintiff was injured when her vehicle collided with a baking company truck.Â  Carolina Baking, a North Carolina corporation, had operated a plant and done business in South Carolina since 1924.Â  In 1935, two years before the wreck, all assets of the predecessor corporation (Carolina Baking) were transferred to a successor corporation (Columbia Baking), a newly chartered Delaware corporation with its principal offices in Atlanta.Â  The predecessor was dissolved as a corporate entity, although no notice of dissolution was filed in South Carolina.Â  \r\nAfter the asset transfer, the successor continued to use the trade name of predecessor Carolina Baking, licensing the subject truck and its business in that name and using the name on its vehicles and buildings.Â  Carolina Baking entered a general appearance and defended the action.Â  The Court rejected the successorâ€™s attempt to avoid liability on the ground that Carolina Baking no longer existed and the plaintiff had failed to sue the proper corporate entity.Â  â€œ[T]he verdict and judgment against Carolina Baking Company [are] binding upon the existent corporate entity and its assets, by whatsoever name it may be known or called.Â  The corporate fiction and the rules surrounding it have been of inestimable service in the affairs of business, but they must be applied in such a manner as to promote justice, not to hinder or defeat it.â€Â  Long, 190 S.C. at 377, 3 S.E.2d at 50.[3]\r\nIn Bryant v. Waste Management, Inc., 342 S.C. 159, 536 S.E.2d 380 (Ct. App. 2000), the employee of a waste treatment plant sued the waste hauler for negligence after a waste container dropped on his foot, partially amputating it.Â  The Court of Appeals concluded Waste Management was the proper defendant because Chambers Waste Systems, the original defendant, had been subsumed by USA Waste Services, which in turn had merged with Waste Management while the lawsuit was pending.Â  The Court of Appeals rejected Waste Managementâ€™s argument it had been improperly substituted as a defendant pursuant to Rule 25(c), SCRCP.Â  Id. at 163-66, 536 S.E.2d at 382-84.\r\nThe above authority derived from contract and tort precedent reveals that our appellate courts have not looked favorably upon efforts by a successor corporation to employ corporate law principles to avoid liability to a wronged creditor or plaintiff.Â  In addition, I have considered the numerous foreign decisions, treatises, and law review articles offered by the parties and amici curiae, as well as authority revealed by the Courtâ€™s own research.Â  I have studied the leading cases of Turner v. Bituminous Cas. Co., 244 N.W.2d 873 (Mich. 1976) (adopting continuity of enterprise exception) and Ray v. Alad Corp., 560 P.2d 3 (Cal. 1977) (adopting product line exception), and their progeny.Â  E.g. Holloway v. John E. Smithâ€™s Sons Co., 432 F. Supp. 454 (D.S.C. 1977) (applying continuity of enterprise exception)[4]; Asher v. KCS Intern., Inc., 659 So.2d 598 (Ala. 1995) (applying continuity of enterprise exception); Savage Arms, Inc. v. Western Auto Supply Co., 18 P.3d 49 (Alaska 2001) (adopting continuity of enterprise); Huff v. Shopsmith, Inc., 786 So.2d 383 (Miss. 2001) (adopting product line exception); Ramirez v. Amsted Indus., Inc., 431 A.2d 811 (N.J. 1981) (adopting product line exception); Garcia v. Coe Mfg. Co., 933 P.2d 243 (N.M. 1997) (adopting product line exception); Kradel v. Fox River Tractor Co., 308 F.3d 328 (3d Cir. 2002) (product line exception is law of Pennsylvania); Hill v. Trailmobile, Inc., 603 A.2d 602 (Pa. Super. 1992) (applying product line exception); Martin v. Abbott Laboratories, 689 P.2d 368 (Wash. 1984) (adopting product line exception); Cyr v. B. Offen &amp; Co., 501 F.2d 1145, 1151-56 (1st Cir. 1974) (leading case adopting continuity of enterprise); Russell v. Philip D. Moran, Inc., 449 A.2d 1208 (N.H. 1982) (favorably citing Cyr and continuity of enterprise theory); but see Simoneau v. South Bend Lathe, Inc., 543 A.2d 407 (N.H. 1988) (calling Cyr into question because risk spreading, a basis of Cyr decision, is not accepted as a rationale for strict liability in New Jersey; however, court did not reject continuity of enterprise exception).[5]Â  \r\nI also have considered authority rejecting one or both exceptions.Â  Courts rejecting successor liability in the product liability setting have done so primarily because they believe it violates the principle that only those which are responsible for manufacturing and marketing a product should bear liability for its defects; the exceptions violate traditional principles of successor liability; the exceptions defeat the partiesâ€™ expectations arising from the negotiation and sale of assets; the successor has no control over products already produced and marketed; smaller successor corporations might face financial ruin if held liable for a predecessorâ€™s products; and the issue should be left to the legislature.Â  E.g. Winsor v. Glasswerks PHX, L.L.C., 63 P.3d 1040, 1046 (Ariz. App. Div. 1 2003); Johnston v. Amsted Indus., Inc., 830 P.2d 1141, 1146-47 (Colo. App. 1992); Bernard v. Kee Mfg. Co., Inc., 409 So.2d 1047, 1049-50 (Fla. 1982); Nissen Corp. v. Miller, 594 A.2d 564, 566-73 (Md. 1991); Niccum v. Hydra Tool Corp., 438 N.W.2d 96, 99 (Minn. 1989); Jones v. Johnson Mach. and Press Co., 320 N.W.2d 481 (Neb. 1982); Simoneau v. South Bend Lathe, Inc., 543 A.2d 407 (N.H. 1988); Downtowner, Inc. v. Acrometal Products, Inc., 347 N.W.2d 118, 121-25 (N.D. 1984); Flaugher v. Cone Automatic Mach. Co., 507 N.E.2d 331, 336-37 (Ohio 1987); Fish v. Amsted Indus., Inc., 376 N.W.2d 820, 823-25 (Wis. 1985); 15 Fletcherâ€™s Cyclopedia Corporation Â§ 7123.20; Restatement (Third) of Torts:Â  Products Liability Â§ 12 (1998); 1 American Law of Products Liability Â§Â§ 7:19-7:24.\r\nThe central inquiry is this:Â  Should a successor corporation, which under the law is rightfully allowed to seek financial gain from the accumulated goodwill and reputation of a predecessor after purchasing the predecessorâ€™s assets, simultaneously be allowed to rid itself of the burden of claims brought by persons injured by an allegedly defective product made by the defunct predecessor?Â  In other words, will the law allow the successor to embrace the benefits with one arm while evading the burdens with the other? \r\nI conclude the law should not allow such an obviously inequitable result, which does not comport with the sound public policies of this state with regard to corporate successor liability or product liability law.Â  This Court long has maintained that the burdens follow the benefits in the arena of successor liability under appropriate circumstances.Â  Brown 128 S.C. at 432, 123 S.E. at 99.Â  Moreover, as the Court aptly observed sixty-six years ago, â€œ[t]he corporate fiction and the rules surrounding it have been of inestimable service in the affairs of business, but they must be applied in such a manner as to promote justice, not to hinder or defeat it.â€Â  Long, 190 S.C. at 377, 3 S.E.2d at 50.\r\nThe Court has not previously had the opportunity to determine the meaning of the mere continuation exception set forth in Brown, 128 S.C. 428, 123 S.E. 97, in this context, and I would decline to interpret that exception as narrowly as other courts have.Â  The general rule and mere continuation exception are sufficiently flexible to encompass successor liability in the context of a product liability action.Â  I conclude that a successor corporation which acquires all or substantially all of the assets of a predecessor, whether through a transfer of stock or a transfer of assets for cash or the equivalent, may be held liable in a product liability claim arising from a unit previously manufactured and distributed by the predecessor when the successor is determined to be, in effect, a mere continuation of the defunct predecessor.\r\nIn determining this issue, a court should consider factors such as (1) whether the successor, taking lawful advantage of the predecessorâ€™s accumulated goodwill and reputation, held itself out to the world as a continuation of the predecessor through continued use of the predecessorâ€™s corporate identity, trade names, advertising, or other intellectual property; (2) whether the successor continued to manufacture substantially the same product line as the predecessor, recognizing that manufacturing activity by its nature involves modification of product lines and elimination of unprofitable items;Â  (3) whether theÂ  successor retained the predecessorâ€™s managers, employees, or sales force; (4) whether the successor continued to use the predecessorâ€™s equipment, supplier, dealer, or customer lists; (5) whether the successor assumed those liabilities and obligations of the predecessor ordinarily necessary for the continuation of normal business operations of the predecessor; and (6) whether the successorâ€™s officers, directors, or shareholders are substantially the same as the predecessorâ€™s.Â  No one factor can be dispositive in this fact-intensive analysis.Â  Again, the overarching principle in the analysis is that a successor which stands to benefit from exploitation of the predecessorâ€™s identity and accumulated goodwill and reputation may not avoid the burden of the predecessorâ€™s product liability claims.\r\nThis approach best comports with the policies and goals of both corporate law and product liability law in South Carolina.Â  It is well established that a successor corporation in appropriate circumstances obtains the benefits and accompanying burdens in the contract or creditor-debtor setting.Â  The same ought to be true in a product liability action involving a corporation which is found to be a mere continuation of the predecessor.\r\nâ€œ[S]trict liability for manufacturers exists in large part as a deterrent and a method of allocating the risk of loss among those best equipped to deal with it.â€Â  Madison v. American Home Products Corp., 358 S.C. 449, 454, 595 S.E.2d 493, 496 (2004).Â  The approach I propose is consistent with the notion that manufacturers - whether they are the original manufacturer or a successor - are in the best position to protect the public from defective products by evaluating the risks and ensuring they place a reasonably safe product in the stream of commerce.Â  Furthermore, this approach would encourage existing corporations to produce safe products because, knowing they will be unable to offer themselves for sale free of successor liability, they will have an additional incentive to manufacture safer products in order to maximize the corporationâ€™s market value if sold.\r\nI reject as speculative and unfounded the argument that holding a successor liable in a product liability action will damage business interests or prompt rash decisions by corporations.Â  Terex has not cited, nor have I found, any studies or evidence demonstrating that the view I propose would inhibit asset-based transactions, lead to increased piecemeal sales, or discourage large-scale transfers.Â  Potential legal liability often is a factor every responsible corporation must consider; however, it is not the driving or primary force behind every decision.Â  Successors contracting for an asset transfer in a free market, when they intend to continue the basic enterprise, will negotiate a price which reflects the fair market value of the transfer, taking heed of the risk of future claims.Â  A successor also may factor in the cost of purchasing successor liability insurance.Â  See e.g. Savage Arms, 18 P.3d at 56-58.Â  \r\nThe traditional rule on successor liability â€œwas designed for the corporate contractual world where it functions well.Â  It protects creditors and dissenting shareholders, and facilitates determination of tax responsibilities, while promoting free alienability of business assets.â€Â  Polius v. Clark Eqpt. Co., 802 F.2d 75, 78 (3d Cir. 1986).Â  However, courts have come to recognize, as I would, â€œthat the traditional rule of nonliability was developed not in response to the interests of parties to product liability actions, but rather to protect the rights of commercial creditors and dissenting shareholders following corporate acquisitions, as well as to determine successor corporation liability for tax assessments and contractual obligations of the predecessor.Â  Strict interpretation of the traditional corporate law approach leads to a narrow application of the exceptions to non-liability, and places unwarranted emphasis on the form rather than the practical effect of a particular corporate transaction.â€Â  Ramirez, 431 A.2d at 815-16.\r\nI agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court that it is somewhat anomalous and rather perplexing that after the long journey from the seminal product liability case of MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916), the drafters of the Restatement (Third) of Torts and courts rejecting successor liability in this context would frame the issue solely in terms of contract law and essentially ignore product liability law.Â  See Lefever v. K.P. Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., 734 A.2d 290, 294-95 (N.J. 1999).Â  The better view, as outlined above, is that strict liability in tort may be imposed on a successor corporation in a product liability action in a manner which allows corporations to protect their interests and yet still fulfills the goals of product liability law.\r\n2.Â  EFFECT OF FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT ORDER ON VIABILITY OF PRODUCT LIABILITY ACTION BASED ON STATE LAW\r\nI agree with the majority that a plaintiff may maintain a product liability claim in South Carolina under a successor liability theory against a defendant which purchased only the assets of a voluntarily bankrupt selling company in a transaction approved by the federal bankruptcy court.Â  As explained in Question 1, I part with the majority in its exclusive reliance on Brown, 128 S.C. 428, 123 S.E. 97.Â  I would apply the analysis previously set forth to determine whether the successor is a mere continuation of the predecessor.Â  Accordingly, I would answer â€œyesâ€ to Question 2 and analyze it in the following manner.\r\nTerex argues it cannot be held liable as a successor because it purchased the assets free and clear of all claims pursuant to the terms of a bankruptcy court order; the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires this Court give binding effect to the bankruptcy court order; and the Bankruptcy Code preempts a successor liability theory of recovery when the bankruptcy court approves the sale of assets.Â  I disagree.\r\nA.Â  LANGUAGE OF BANKRUPTCY COURT ORDERÂ Â Â  \r\nThe 1991 purchase agreement between Mark and Terex stated â€œ[n]othing herein shall be construed as the assumption of or by Buyer of any liabilities of the Seller, including, without limitation, any liability for products manufactured or sold by Seller.â€Â  The bankruptcy court order approving the sale provided that â€œ[Mark] is authorized to sell the assets of its estate to Terex . . . on terms and conditions consistent with the Purchase Agreement and related attachments.â€Â  The order stated that â€œthe sale of the assets authorized hereby is free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances as may presently attach to the assets. . .Â  (emphasis added).â€Â  The order further stated that the â€œsale of assets shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances of those creditors who had adequate notice of the Debtorâ€™s motion and opportunity to appear and object at the time of the hearing on the Motion (emphasis added).â€Â  \r\nTerex asserts the terms of the order and purchase agreement insulate it from product liability claims as the successor of Mark.Â  Simmons asserts the bankruptcy court order does not bar liability in this instance because - while the purchase agreement expressly mentioned product liability claims that may arise in the future - the order did not.Â  Citing the above-emphasized language, Simmons contends his product liability claim is not barred because it did not exist until he was injured in the 1999 accident; thus, it does not fall within the ambit of the order.\r\nI would decline to resolve this question by attempting to parse the language of the order and purchase agreement as Simmons suggests.Â  Instead, I would find that the order apparently incorporated the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement, which included the provision on future product liability claims purporting to insulate Terex from successor liability.Â  The real question which must be answered is whether such a provision precludes a state law-based product liability action against Terex.\r\nB.Â  FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE\r\nTerex argues this Court is required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to enforce the bankruptcy court order in its entirety, including the disclaimer of liability for future product liability claims.Â  I disagree.\r\nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause,[6] as well as the Full Faith and Credit Statute,[7] are inapplicable.Â  Simmons, who was injured in 1999, did not have an existing claim and never received notice of the bankruptcy proceeding before the sale of assets in 1991.Â  A court of this state is not required by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to enforce a foreign state judgment or order when it is rendered by a court lacking personal or subject matter jurisdiction, or when it is rendered in violation of due process of law without notice and a fair opportunity to be heard.Â  See Baker by Thomas v. General Motors Corp., 522 U.S. 222, 242 (1998) (Full Faith and Credit Clause and its implementing statute make the record of a judgment, rendered after due notice in one state, conclusive evidence in the courts of another State, or of the United States, of the matter adjudged) (Scalia, J., concurring); World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291 (1980) (â€œA judgment rendered in violation of due process is void in the rendering State and is not entitled to full faith and credit elsewhere. . . . Due process requires that the defendant be given adequate notice of the suit . . . and be subject to the personal jurisdiction of the court.â€); Barnes v. Buck, 346 A.2d 778, 782 (Pa. 1975) (â€œthe full and faith and credit clause does not require that we give recognition to a judgment rendered without jurisdiction or without notice and a fair opportunity to be heard; indeed, due process of law mandates that we not do so.â€); Pector v. Meltzer, 689 A.2d 814, 816 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 1997) (stating the â€œwell-established principle that a court of this State, when asked to enforce a foreign state judgment, must deny full faith and credit if the rendering court lacked in personam jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction, or failed to provide adequate notice and an opportunity to be heardâ€) (emphasis in original).\r\nC.Â  PREEMPTION\r\nTerex argues the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, specifically 11 U.S.C.A. Â§ 363(f) (West 2004),[8] preempts any attempt under state law to impose successor liability for product liability claims.Â  I disagree.\r\nâ€œThe Supremacy Clause provides that â€˜[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.â€™Â  It is basic to this constitutional command that all conflicting state provisions be without effect.â€Â  Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 746 (1981) (quoting U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2).Â  It is a â€œfamiliar and well-established principle that the Supremacy Clause . . . invalidates state laws that interfere with or are contrary to federal laws.â€Â  Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Labs, Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 712 (1985) (internal quotes omitted).Â  However, â€œ[c]onsideration under the Supremacy Clause starts with the basic assumption that Congress did not intend to displace state law.â€Â  Maryland, 451 U.S. at 746.\r\nIn the interest of avoiding unintended encroachment on the authority of the states, a court interpreting a federal statute pertaining to a subject traditionally governed by state law will be reluctant to find preemption.Â  Thus, preemption will not lie unless it is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.Â  Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).Â  Evidence of Congressâ€™ intent to preempt state law is sought in the text and structure of the statute at issue.Â  Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 95 (1983).Â  Congress did not intend the Bankruptcy Code to preempt all state laws.Â  Midlantic Natl. Bank v. N.J. Dept. of Environ. Protection, 474 U.S. 494, 506-07 (1986) (holding that bankruptcy trustee may not abandon environmentally contaminated property in contravention of state law that is reasonably designed to protect public health or safety).\r\nFederal law may preempt state law in three ways.Â  First, Congress may expressly define the extent to which it preempts state law.Â  Second, Congress may occupy a field of regulation, impliedly preempting state law.Â  Third, a state law may be preempted to the extent it conflicts with federal law.Â  Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers Assn., Inc. v. Agricultural Mktg. &amp; Bargaining Bd., 467 U.S. 461, 469 (1984); Professional Samplers, Inc. v. S.C. Empl. Sec. Commn., 334 S.C. 392, 397, 513 S.E.2d 374, 377 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Such a conflict arises when either compliance with both laws is impossible or when the state law frustrates the federal purpose and creates an obstacle to the fulfillment of federal objectives.Â  Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers, 467 U.S. at 469.\r\nI conclude Â§ 363(f), which establishes the bankruptcy trusteeâ€™s power to sell assets of the estate, does not preempt a state law which adjudicates a successor corporationâ€™s liability in a product liability claim.Â  Section 363(f) does not expressly preempt such a state law, and the Bankruptcy Code does not so occupy the field of product liability that such a state law is impliedly preempted.Â  Such a state law does not conflict with Â§ 363(f) because compliance with both laws is possible and the state law does not frustrate or create an obstacle to federal bankruptcy laws.Â  State successor liability law may co-exist with federal bankruptcy law because state law will not prevent asset sales or affect the trusteeâ€™s authority to conduct such sales, but merely may subject the purchaser to successor liability.Â  As explained in Question 1, a purchaser may consider any potential future liability in negotiating the sale of assets.Â  See Wilkerson v. C.O. Porter Mach. Co., 567 A.2d 598 (N.J. Super. Law. 1989) (preemption would not preclude applying product line theory of successor liability to asset purchaser in bankruptcy sale; application of successor liability to product liability claim would not conflict with bankruptcy orders involving sale of assets).\r\nAt least two courts have held liability for a product liability claim may not be imposed on a successor who purchased assets at a court-approved bankruptcy sale, although the decisions were not based on a preemption analysis.Â  See Nelson v. Tiffany Indus. Inc., 778 F.2d 533, 538 (9th Cir. 1985) (applying California law to hold the product line exception does not apply when there is a good-faith dissolution in bankruptcy which is not intended to avoid future tort claims against the predecessor; under such circumstances, the successor corporation has not caused the destruction of the plaintiffâ€™s remedies); In re White Motor Credit Corp., 75 B.R. 944 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 1987) (imposition of liability on successor corporation for preconfirmation product liability claims against predecessor was precluded by order of sale approving partiesâ€™ agreement that successor would not assume any liabilities of predecessor for personal injury or property damage because of alleged negligence or breach of warranty or under any other theory of product liability).\r\nI find more persuasive the views expressed by several courts which have held that a successor may be held strictly liable in a state law product liability claim despite a bankruptcy court order or purchase agreement purporting to discharge such liability.Â  See In re Savage Indus., Inc., 43 F.3d 714, 719-23 (1st Cir. 1994) (parties to an all-asset transfer in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, where purchase agreement purported to disclaim successorâ€™s liability for product liability claims not pending at time of sale, are not entitled to rely on protective jurisdiction of bankruptcy court to enjoin prosecution of a state-law based successor product-line liability action; court emphasized the importance of notice and procedural due process, which permeate the Bankruptcy Code); Zerand-Bernal Group, Inc. v. Cox, 23 F.3d 159, 161-64 (7th Cir. 1994) (bankruptcy court did not have power to enjoin state law product liability claim under successor doctrine despite language in order purporting to do so; court suggested that Â§ 363(f) may not be used to extinguish successor product-line claims); Mooney Aircraft Corp. v. Foster, 730 F.2d 367, 373-75 (5th Cir. 1984) (bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin plaintiffâ€™s product liability suit against successor which purchased assets used to make allegedly defective airplane because plaintiff did not have a claim at time of bankruptcy sale and so there was no property right to be deprived or claim to be divested); Schweitzer v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 758 F.2d 936, 941-44 (3d Cir. 1985) (discharge in bankruptcy does not discharge a product liability claim when claimant does not have a sustainable cause of action at the time of the discharge); In re Schwinn Bicycle Co., 210 B.R. 747 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1997) (bankruptcy court order approving sale of assets, which indicated successor-purchaser would not be regarded as successor in interest, could not bind plaintiff subsequently injured while using exercise equipment manufactured by predecessor; even assuming order was intended to have such an effect, applying it to accident victim whose product liability claim arose after sale of assets, and who had received no notice or opportunity to participate in bankruptcy process, would violate due process and bankruptcy notice requirements); Lefever v. K.P. Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., 734 A.2d 290, 295-301 (N.J. 1999) (federal bankruptcy law did not preclude forklift operatorâ€™s product liability claim against successor who purchased assets at bankruptcy sale because bankruptcy proceeding did not deal with his claim; court noted that successors who purchase assets at bankruptcy sale may be held liable in other contexts, including liability for environmental contamination, delinquent pension fund contributions, and age discrimination claims).\r\nIn sum, I conclude Simmons may maintain a state law-based product liability claim under a successor liability theory against a successor corporation which purchased the predecessorâ€™s assets in a voluntary sale approved by the federal bankruptcy court.\r\n3.Â  AVAILABILITY OF OTHER POTENTIAL DEFENDANTS\r\nTerex urges we find it may not be held liable as a successor because Simmons may look to seller, BPS Equipment, for recovery.Â  Terex asserts that when other entities may answer in damages to Simmons under a strict liability or negligence theory, it is unnecessary to hold a successor corporation liable in a product liability action.\r\nI agree with the majority this argument is without merit and conclude the answer to Question 3 is â€œyes,â€ a plaintiff may maintain a product liability claim under a successor liability theory against a defendant when there are one or more other viable product liability defendants.Â  The status and availability of a seller or other potential defendants are irrelevant in determining the issue of a successor corporationâ€™s liability in a product liability action.Â  To hold otherwise would be to grant a fortuitous windfall to a successor, if a plaintiff should prevail, while unfairly and improperly placing the entire burden of responding to the plaintiffâ€™s damages on remaining defendants.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn Question 1, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s decision to rely exclusively on Brown, 128 S.C. 428, 123 S.E. 97.Â  A successor corporation which purchases the assets of a predecessor may be held liable in a product liability action for an allegedly defective product manufactured by the predecessor when an analysis of the facts and circumstances reveals it is appropriate to hold the successor liable as a mere continuation of the predecessor.Â  In Question 2, I agree with the majority a plaintiff may maintain a product liability claim under a successor liability theory grounded in state law against a successor corporation which purchased the predecessorâ€™s assets in a voluntary sale approved by the federal bankruptcy court.Â  I disagree with the majorityâ€™s decision to rely exclusively on Brown in determining the issue of successor liability.Â  In Question 3, I agree with the majority that the fact there may be one or more viable product liability defendants who may be liable to Simmons as a seller of an allegedly defective product is irrelevant in analyzing the issue of successor liability.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Essentially, the dissent advocates an expansion of the mere continuation exception.Â  However, as noted by the dissent, the majority of courts interpreting the mere continuation exception have found it applicable only when there is commonality of ownership, i.e., the predecessor and successor corporations have substantially the same officers, directors, or shareholders.Â  We decline to extend the exception to cases in which there is no such commonality of officers, directors and shareholders.Â  Further, we find no conflict with Holloway v. John E. Smithâ€™s Sons Co., 432 F. Supp. 454 (D.S.C. 1977).Â  We do not find that the Holloway court established a new test of successor liability.Â  Although the court in Holloway did not cite the test established in Brown, it applied the mere continuation exception.Â  Unlike the present case in which Mark Lift and Terex did not share common officers, directors and shareholders, it appears from a reading of Holloway that there was, indeed, a commonality of ownership.Â  Accordingly, the mere continuation exception was properly applied to that case.Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  A merger, share exchange, or consolidation typically involves the transfer of stock, not just the transfer of assets such as real, personal, or intellectual property or goodwill.Â  The predecessor corporate entity ceases to exist and is merged into the successor, or both cease to exist and are consolidated into a new corporation.Â  It is widely accepted that the successor corporate entity in these situations is liable for all debts and obligations, including negligence and product liability claims, incurred by the predecessor.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-11-101 to -108 (1990 &amp; Supp. 2004) (mergers and share exchanges); 15 Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations Â§Â§ 7121-7122 (1999); 1 American Law of Products Liability 3d Â§ 7:10 (2001).Â  The issues presented in this case and others like it arise when only assets - not shares of stock - are sold or transferred to a successor corporation.\r\n[3]Â  The Court employed the same analysis and reached the same result in a companion case involving the estate of a plaintiff decedent.Â  Long v. Carolina Baking Co., 193 S.C. 225, 8 S.E.2d 326 (1939).\r\n[4]Â  I disagree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion there was commonality of ownership between the predecessor and successor corporations in Holloway.Â  Simmons, Op. No. 26050, at n.1.Â  As I read Holloway, Hobam, Inc., purchased the assets of an unrelated, separate corporation known as John E. Smith Sonâ€™s Co. and, in a common corporate tactic, retained the name and created a Hobam subsidiary called John E. Smith Sonâ€™s Co.Â  There is no indication that the officers, directors, and shareholders of Hobam were the same as the officers, directors, and shareholders of the old John E. Smith Sonâ€™s Co.Â  The district court explained that the successor business (the Hobam subsidiary) continued at the same address with virtually all of its previous employees, continued to maintain equipment sold by the predecessor, and held itself out to the public as a business entity under a name virtually identical to the predecessor corporation.Â  Id. at 456.Â  Furthermore, the case raised â€œ[t]he question of whether or not the corporation which purchases the assets of another business entity is a continuation of the previous entity for purposes of products liability . . . .â€Â  Id. at 455 (emphasis added).Â  The district court in Holloway applied the rationale of Cyr v. B. Offen &amp; Co., 501 F.2d 1145 (1st Cir. 1974), a leading â€œcontinuity of enterpriseâ€ case which in appropriate circumstances allows a successor corporation to be held liable for defective products manufactured by a defunct predecessor.\r\nAs previously explained, the successor corporation in the present case continued to manufacture the same scissorlift as did the predecessor - using essentially the same technology, same design, same equipment, same marketing, same logo, same tradename, same supplier list, same dealer list, same customer list, and a few of the same employees.Â  I agree with the rationale and outcome in Holloway, and cite it as additional support for the approach I believe the Court should adopt in the present case.\r\n[5]Â  The continuity of enterprise and product line theories have been distinguished as follows:\r\n\r\n[A] continuity of enterprise analysis seeks to establish whether there is substantial continuity of pretransaction and posttransaction business activities resulting from the use of the acquired assets, while a product line analysis seeks to establish whether there is a substantial continuity in the products resulting from the pretransaction and posttransaction use of the assets.\r\n\r\nNissen Corp. v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:Â  Appellant, Jessie Waylon Sapp, was convicted of the murder of a South Carolina Highway Patrolman in Berkeley County and was sentenced to death.[1]Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 2:30 a.m., on July 7, 2002, four state highway patrolmen were conducting a driverâ€™s license checkpoint in Berkeley County.Â  A pick-up truck with a female driver and male passenger approached the checkpoint and were stopped by Patrolman Patrick Sigwald.Â  When Sigwald noticed alcohol containers in the back of the truck, he instructed the driver, Kathryn Boles, to pull over to the right shoulder of the road.Â  Sigwald then approached the passenger side of the truck and asked the passenger, Sapp, for the registration and insurance certificate.Â  Sapp opened the glove box and began looking for papers.Â  Sigwald noticed an empty beer bottle on the front floor board and asked Sapp to hand it to him.Â  The driver of the truck (Boles) spoke up and indicated the beer had been her first one that night.Â  Sigwald asked Boles to step to the rear of the vehicle and she complied.Â  At that point, Corporal Jeff Johnson, the supervisor, came up and spoke to Sigwald, asking if Boles was under age twenty-one.Â  Patrolman Sigwald handed Corporal Johnson Sappâ€™s driverâ€™s license.Â  Johnson took the driverâ€™s license and approached the right-hand side of the truck, toward Sapp.Â  Sigwald heard a loud bang, and heard Johnson say, â€œyou sorry bastard.â€Â  Sigwald heard another gunshot, then several more, and saw Johnson firing shots at Sapp, who was running away.Â  Sigwald opened fire and Sapp eventually fell to the ground, wounded.Â  \r\nSigwald saw Johnson lying face down on the pavement.Â  He turned Johnson over and opened his bullet-proof vest, and saw one bullet hole right below the vest.Â  Johnson bled to death at the scene.Â  Sapp was charged with murder, and the state sought the death penalty based upon the aggravating circumstances that Sapp had created a great risk of death to more than one person, and that he had murdered a state law enforcement officer.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (C)(a)(3) and (7)(2003).Â  He was found guilty of murder, and sentenced to death.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.Â  Did the trial court err in excusing a potential juror for cause due to her religious beliefs concerning the death penalty?\r\n2.Â  Did the trial court err in sustaining the stateâ€™s objection to testimony of Sappâ€™s girlfriend as to whether she would like to see Sapp put to death? \r\n\r\n1.Â  REMOVAL OF JUROR FOR CAUSE\r\nDuring voir dire of potential juror Kathleen McNair, the trial court explained the three types of death penalty jurors: i.e., Type 1 would always vote for death if the offense of murder were established; Type 2 would never vote for the death penalty; and Type 3 would consider the facts of the case to decide if death were appropriate.Â  When asked which of these three types she was, McNair responded â€œwell, as a matter of fact, I donâ€™t believe in the death penalty because of my religion.â€Â  The court engaged in the following colloquy with McNair:\r\n\r\nQ.Â  Okay.Â  Well, let me ask you, when you say you donâ€™t believe in it, I appreciate that and I understand that.Â  You further stated that itâ€™s a part of your religion?\r\nA. Yeah, thatâ€™s the only thing.\r\nQ.Â  Okay.Â  Thatâ€™s no problem.Â  But the law of South Carolina would be and I would instruct you that the death penalty may be warranted in some cases.\r\nA.Â  I understand.\r\nQ.Â  You understand?\r\nA.Â  I understand that.\r\nQ.Â  But youâ€™re saying, as a juror you couldnâ€™t consider that law?\r\nA.Â  No, I couldnâ€™t just because of my belief.Â  Thatâ€™s all.\r\nQ.Â  Your belief would prevent you?\r\nA.Â  It is my religion, thatâ€™s it.Â  But otherwise, you know, it should be - you know, it should be that way.Â  But to me, I canâ€™t.\r\nQ.Â  You could never do that?\r\nA.Â  I canâ€™t decide on that because of my religion.Â  Iâ€™m sorry but - - \r\nQ.Â  I understand.Â  As I said, there are no correct answers to any of these.Â  Itâ€™s merely how you feel.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).Â  The solicitor then queried McNair as follows:\r\nQ.Â  Would it then be impossible if you sat on a jury for you to consider the death penalty based on your beliefs?Â  And let me take it one step further.Â  If youâ€™re sitting on a jury with the other 11 jurors and they all said the death penalty and you sort of believe, well, maybe the death penalty if it ever is appropriate might be appropriate here, could you sign your name on the death penalty verdict saying Iâ€™m calling for the death of the defendant?\r\n\r\nA.Â  Oh, this is hard.\r\nQ.Â  Youâ€™re not required to.\r\nA.Â  I probably will.Â  But because of my beliefs - what Iâ€™m telling you, I probably would because of the type of crime.\r\nQ.Â  Youâ€™re saying you probably would call for the death penalty if you thought it was appropriate?\r\nA.Â  Yes, because of the crime.\r\nQ.Â  Okay.Â  So depending on the circumstances of the case, you would set aside your religion?\r\nA.Â  Oh - - \r\nQ.Â  Again, weâ€™re not trying to put you in a position you canâ€™t be in.\r\nA.Â  I understand. \r\nQ.Â  Weâ€™re just trying to find out - - because if youâ€™re on the jury and you realize you couldnâ€™t, it would be too late for you to give both sides a fair trial.\r\nQ.Â  So thatâ€™s why we ask you up front.Â  So tell me about it again, just tell me what your feelings are about the death penalty.Â  \r\nA.Â  If I put my religion aside, if it wasnâ€™t my religion, I believe in it, I will go for the death penalty.\r\nQ.Â  Yes, maâ€™am.Â  But do you understand you donâ€™t have to put your religion aside? \r\nA.Â  I understand.\r\nQ.Â  When you go back there, you are who you are.\r\nA.Â  I am who I am, uh-huh.\r\nQ.Â  Now, knowing you do not have to put your religion aside, would that put you in a position that you couldnâ€™t deal with by being on the jury and having to determine the death penalty?\r\nA.Â  I could deal with it.Â  I know I can deal with it because I believe in God.Â  So I could deal with it.\r\nQ.Â  Could you do it if you thought it were appropriate?Â  Could you return a death penalty verdict and sign your name on a death penalty warrant?\r\nA.Â  If it was appropriate, yes.\r\nQ.Â  Appropriate is a term that you would have to make a determination after you hear the facts.Â  Are thereâ€”have you had an opportunity to think about the death penalty other than in yourâ€”in the sense of your religion?\r\nA.Â  I did thought about it. . . . (brief colloquy with court)\r\nQ.Â  What religion are you? \r\nA.Â  Iâ€™m a Methodist.\r\nQ.Â  And what is the teaching of that religion regarding the death penalty?\r\nA.Â  Thou shall not kill.\r\nQ.Â  Would that affect your ability to deliberate on a jury?\r\n\r\nAt this point, counsel for Sapp objected that she had already answered the question and the court overruled the objection, finding this a critical issue.Â  The court then queried whether Ms. McNair needed a moment.Â  (The court reporterâ€™s note indicates the juror was crying).Â  The trial court indicated the record was to reflect that the juror was emotionally distraught.Â  \r\nAfter discussing the matter with counsel, the trial court ruled: \r\n\r\nConsidering the answers given by Ms. McNair, observing also her demeanor in the courtroom during the examination and the questions propounded by the solicitor, which she never answered, became so emotionally distraught by the question, â€œWould that affect your ability to deliberate on a jury,â€ and she never answered the question.Â  Given her answers and her inconsistency or the inconsistency of her answers, given the feelings that she articulated to my questions and to the solicitorâ€™s questions that her religious beliefs were very sincere and deep seeded with her in her life, I would conclude that her inability to answer the question affecting her ability to deliberate and constantly apologizing is a human reaction to suggest that she couldnâ€™t consider it.Â  And therefore, she felt inadequate because she couldnâ€™t.Â  And that would be the only justification for somebody becoming emotionally distraught and apologizing.Â  So given that and given her demeanor and considering the totality and completeness of her answers, I would agree that sheâ€™s not qualified.Â  And the record is clear that Mr. Sapp finds and would argue that she is qualified and has stated - clearly I donâ€™t argue with the position that she indicated at one point that, yes, she could invokeâ€”award the death penalty.Â  But I believe it would substantially affect her ability to consider both sentences, that is her religious belief.Â  \r\n\r\nSapp asserts the trial court erred in excusing McNair for cause.Â Â  We disagree.Â  Â We find the record fully supports the trial courtâ€™s removal of the juror.\r\nThe exclusion of venire persons simply because they voice general objections to the death penalty or express conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction is unconstitutional.Â  Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968).Â  However, a prospective juror may be excluded for cause when his views on capital punishment are such as would â€œprevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.â€Â  Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424 (1985).Â  See also State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 135, 607 S.E.2d 57 (2004), cert. denied 125 S.Ct. 2942 (2005); State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1050 (1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(E) (juror may not be excused in a death penalty case unless his beliefs or attitudes against capital punishment would render him unable to return a verdict according to law).Â  When reviewing the trial courtâ€™s qualification or disqualification of prospective jurors, the responses of the challenged jurors must be examined in light of the entire voir dire.Â  Council, supra.Â  The determination of whether a juror is qualified to serve on a death penalty case is within the sole discretion of the trial judge and is not reversible on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence. Â State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326, 422 S.E.2d 133 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 915 (1993), overruled on other grounds, Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999). Â The ultimate consideration is that the juror be unbiased, impartial, and able to carry out the law as explained to him. Id.Â  On review, the trial courtâ€™s disqualification of a prospective juror will not be disturbed where there is a reasonable basis from which the trial court could have concluded that the juror would not have been able to faithfully discharge his responsibilities as a juror under the law.Â  State v. Green, 301 S.C. 347, 392 S.E.2d 157, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 881 (1990).Â  See also Wainwright, supra, (there will be situations where the trial court is left with the definite impression that prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law and this is why deference must be paid to trial court who sees and hears the juror).\r\nHere, McNair unequivocally stated, at the outset, that she could not consider the law regarding imposing the death penalty because of her religious beliefs, going on to apologize and state that â€œI canâ€™t decide that because of my religion.â€Â  After being questioned by the solicitor as to whether she could put aside her religion if she was on a death penalty jury and the other 11 members agreed on a sentence of death, she eventually stated that she probably would.Â  Ultimately, however, when questioned as to whether the Methodist teaching that â€œThou shalt not killâ€ would affect her ability to deliberate on the jury, McNair broke down in tears and was unable to answer the question.Â  \r\nGiven the deference which is afforded to trial courts in assessing a death penalty jurorâ€™s qualification, and McNairâ€™s initial responses that she could not vote for death due to her religious beliefs, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s disqualification of McNair.Â  Accord Commonwealth v. Duffy, 855 A.2d 764 (Pa. 2004) (where voir dire indicated juror was somewhat unclear as to her convictions regarding imposition of the death penalty, and these concerns could have substantially impaired her ability to function as an impartial juror, the trial court was in the best position to make that determination and did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the prospective juror for cause).\r\n2.Â  ACCOMPLICEâ€™S OPINION OF SENTENCE\r\nAt sentencing, counsel for Sapp cross-examined Kathryn Boles, the driver of the pick-up truck and Sappâ€™s former girlfriend, as to her relationship with Sapp.Â  After stating that she was not â€œin loveâ€ with Sapp, but did love him, counsel asked whether she would like to see him put to death.Â  The state objected that the question was inappropriate, and the court sustained the objection.Â  Sapp contends Boles should have been permitted to respond to his inquiry.Â  Although we agree that Boles should have been allowed to testify as to whether she wished to see Sapp put to death, her failure to respond to this question was in no way prejudicial.\r\nIn State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114, 525 S.E.2d 519, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 840 (2000), this Court stated:\r\n\r\nIn [State v.] Torrence, we adopted the Georgia Supreme Courtâ€™s distinction between a plea for mercy and the ultimate question to be decided by the jury: â€œ[A]lthough a defendant may present witnesses who know and care for him and are willing on that basis to ask for mercy on his behalf, a defendant may not present witnesses to testify merely to their religious and philosophical attitudes about the death penalty .... Nor is a defendant entitled to present the opinion of a witness about what verdict the jury â€˜oughtâ€™ to reach.â€Â  Torrence, 305 S.C. at 45, 51, 406 S.E.2d 315, at 318 (quoting Childs v. State, 257 Ga. 243, 357 S.E.2d 48, 60 (1987)).\r\n\r\nIn Johnson, notwithstanding the ruling that the trial court should have permitted Johnson to inquire of his sister whether she wanted him to die, we found no prejudice to Johnson because the sister was able to make a general plea for mercy on her brotherâ€™s behalf in the form of testimony concerning their abusive family life, and the fact that she expressed her love and affection for Johnson at trial.\r\nMore recently, in State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 596 S.E.2d 475, 481-482, cert. denied 125 S.Ct. 355 (2004), we addressed the issue of whether the trial court erred in refusing to allow a surviving victim to testify on cross-examination during the sentencing phase of the trial that he did not personally believe Wise should receive the death penalty.Â  We reiterated our holding in Johnson, stating, â€œ[a] close relative of a defendant, such as his sister, may be asked whether she wants the defendant to die, which is akin to asking her to make a general plea for mercy and not explicitly directed toward eliciting her opinion of what verdict the jury should reach.â€Â  359 S.C. at 26, 596 S.E.2d at 481.[2]Â  \r\nUnder Johnson and Wise, Boles should have been permitted to answer the question as to whether she would like to see Sapp put to death.Â  However, we find no prejudice.Â  Initially, it is implicit from Bolesâ€™ testimony that she would have answered that she did not wish to see Sapp put to death.Â  Further, given Bolesâ€™ testimony that she loved Sapp and had known him for years, we find her testimony akin to that in Johnson in which Johnsonâ€™s sister was able to express her love for him.Â  \r\nIn addition, Sappâ€™s mother testified at sentencing, stating, â€œIâ€™m begging you, please donâ€™t take my sonâ€™s life.Â  To take my sonâ€™s life is not going to bring back Corporal Johnson. . . Please if you kill my son, youâ€™re going to devastate the community again and more and more families.Â  Please donâ€™t do it.Â  Please donâ€™t kill him.â€Â  Sappâ€™s nine-year old nephew James also testified that if Sapp were gone from him, it would be the worst thing ever.Â  In light of this testimony, Sapp cannot demonstrate prejudice.Â  See State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 596 S.E.2d 488, cert. denied, 125 S.Ct. 485 (2004) (exclusion of testimony is harmless where it is cumulative to other testimony in the record); State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985); State v. Gaskins, 284 S.C. 105, 127, 326 S.E.2d 132, 145 (erroneous admission of evidence in sentencing phase may be reviewed for harmless error), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1120 (1985), overruled in part on other grounds State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  \r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nWe have conducted a proportionality review pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003).Â  We find the death sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Â Furthermore, a review of prior cases shows the death sentence in this case is proportionate to that in similar cases and is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the crime.Â  See State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 (1999), cert. denied 529 U.S. 1025 (2000); State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 993, (1992); State v. South, 285 S.C. 529, 331 S.E.2d 775, cert. denied 474 U.S. 888 (1985).\r\n AFFIRMED.[3]\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Sapp was also convicted of possession with intent to distribute (PWID) Ecstasy, 3rd offense, PWID cocaine, PWID morphine sulfate, possession of Xanax, 3rd offense, and unlawfully carrying a pistol.Â  He was given concurrent 20 year sentences on the PWID offenses, 1 year for the weapon offense, and 2 years for the Xanax offense.\r\n[2]Â  However, in Wise, we held the trial court properly prohibited the defendant from inquiring of a security officer who had been shot by Wise whether he thought Wise should be sentenced to death, stating, â€œ[w]e accept as true the proffer by Appellantâ€™s attorney Vance would testify he told the media shortly after the shootings he did not personally believe Appellant should receive the death penalty. However, such a statement by Vance would not constitute a plea for mercy on behalf of Appellant.Â  Instead, it would constitute Vanceâ€™ opinion of what verdict--life in prison versus the death penalty--the jury should reach. Accordingly, the trial judge properly disallowed the question, recognizing it was an attempt to elicit an inadmissible opinion from a witness.â€Â  596 S.E.2d at 482.Â  \r\n[3]Â Â  The remaining issues are affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  Sappâ€™s Issue 2- In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 93, 551 S.E.2d 235 , 238- 39 (2001)Â Â  (contemporaneous objection is required to preserve issues regarding a closing argument for review); State v.

Lofton, of Lofton &amp; Lofton, PC, and Andrew J. Savage, II, of Savage &amp; Savage, PA, both of Charleston, for respondent.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a confidential admonition, public reprimand, or definite suspension not to exceed sixty (60) days pursuant to Rule 7, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR. The facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nI.\r\nAt approximately 9:15 p.m. on November 8, 2003, Joseph S. Mendelsohn, a Charleston Municipal Court Judge, was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in Mount Pleasant.Â  Judge Mendelsohn was also charged with having an open container in his vehicle in violation of South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 61-6-4020 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 22-5-530 (Supp. 2004) provides that a person charged with a magistrate or municipal court offense may deposit a sum of money not to exceed the maximum fine with the magistrate, municipal judge, jail, or detention center in lieu of entering into a recognizance.Â  This provision is applicable, however, only in those jurisdictions which adopt the procedure.Â  The City of Charleston and the Charleston County Sheriffâ€™sâ€™ Department, which operates the Charleston County Detention Facility, use this procedure for DUI cases.Â  As of November 2003, Mount Pleasant had not adopted this procedure.Â  \r\nJudge Mendelsohn was transported to the Mount Pleasant Police Department for paperwork and administration of a Datamaster test.Â  While there, Judge Mendelsohn learned that, under procedures established by the Mount Pleasant Chief Municipal Judge, the bond for DUI was $1,002.00, but that bond could not be posted at that time.Â  Instead, under the established procedures, Judge Mendelsohn would be transferred to the Charleston County Detention Facility where he would remain until a bond hearing could be held the next morning at approximately 8:00 a.m.Â  \r\nJudge Mendelsohn knew the Mount Pleasant procedure was not the same procedure used in Charleston for DUI cases.Â  He questioned the arresting officer, a sergeant, and a lieutenant about the procedure.\r\nJudge Mendelsohn telephoned a Mount Pleasant municipal judge.Â  After the municipal judge discussed the bond policy with the police sergeant, he explained the policy to Judge Mendelsohn. \r\nThereafter, Judge Mendelsohn telephoned respondent, a Charleston County Magistrate.Â  Respondent, who was familiar with the procedure used in Charleston, asked the lieutenant why Judge Mendelsohn could not be released.Â  After the lieutenant explained Mount Pleasantâ€™s bond procedure, respondent remarked that he would go to the bond court and conduct a bond hearing for Judge Mendelsohn that night.Â  Respondent asked that Judge Mendelsohn be brought directly to bond court rather than first being booked into the detention center.Â  The lieutenant refused to bypass the standard booking procedure, stating respondent would be booked like any defendant.Â  The lieutenant then advised the arresting officer that respondent would be at the Charleston County Detention Center to conduct a bond hearing.Â  \r\nRespondent telephoned the Summary Court Director to inquire whether she could arrange for staff to meet him at the detention center to hold a bond hearing.Â  During the conversation, respondent and the Summary Court Director discussed that if a bond hearing was held at other than normal operating hours, respondent would be required to hold a bond hearing for all incarcerated defendants.Â  Respondent elected not to call in staff to hold bond hearings.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nRespondent met the arresting officer and Judge Mendelsohn at the detention center.Â  At some point, respondent took possession of the ticket, placed a â€œbond hearingâ€ stamp on the back, and entered the amount of $1,002.00.Â  When detention center officials expressed concerns over Judge Mendelsohnâ€™s release, respondent remarked â€œthis didnâ€™t happen until 8:00 a.m.,â€ or words of similar import and effect.Â  Respondent acknowledges it was his intention to facilitate Judge Mendelsohnâ€™s release without waiting for the morning bond hearing and to make it appear that Judge Mendelsohnâ€™s bond was set at 8:00 a.m. in accordance with Mount Pleasantâ€™s bond procedure.Â  \r\nRespondent communicated his setting of the bond to the Mount Pleasant Chief Judge and asked the judge to indicate his approval of the bond.Â  The Mount Pleasant Chief Judge called the Charleston County Detention Center and was advised that officers were in possession of a valid bond set by respondent.Â  The Mount Pleasant Chief Judge told the officers that, since a bond had been set, the bond procedure he had established did not apply.Â  Judge Mendelsohn was released from the Charleston County Detention Center at approximately 2:30 a.m.Â  \r\nContrary to the published directives of the Chief Justice, respondent did not undertake to set bonds for the other detainees in the detention center.Â  See Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order of November 28, 2000, revised July 1, 2001.Â  \r\nII.\r\nOn November 6, 2003, respondent presided over a bond reduction hearing.Â  Respondent represents he knew the defendant, the defendantâ€™s father, and the defendantâ€™s grandfather.Â  \r\nRespondent represents that when the defendant, an African-American, appeared in court for the bond hearing, respondent recalled a statement made to him by a veteran African American sheriffâ€™s deputy that â€œthere are four kinds of people in this world - black people, white people, red necks, and n_____.â€ Â Respondent alleges he repeated this statement to the defendant in an ill-considered effort to encourage him to recognize and change the path he had chosen in life.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent agrees he has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1(A) (judge should participate in establish, maintaining, and enforcing high standards of conduct and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2B (judge shall not allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence the judge's judicial conduct or judgment); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3(B)(5) (judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice, including but not limited to bias or prejudice based upon race); Canon 3B(7) (judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications, or consider other communications made to the judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending proceeding); and Canon 3B(8) (judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently, and fairly).Â  Â By violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent admits he has also violated the following provisions of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to willfully violate a valid order issued by a court of this state).Â Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent.Â  Standing alone, respondentâ€™s failure to comply with the Chief Justiceâ€™s Administrative Order would not necessitate imposition of a public reprimand.Â  Combined, however, with respondentâ€™s favoritism towards Judge Mendelsohn and his racial remark, the Court deems a public reprimand appropriate.Â  Accordingly, respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26053","title":"In the Matter of Karl Bryant Allen","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26053","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary opinion in which the Court issued a public reprimand.","date":"2005-10-24","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Karl Bryant Allen, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26053\r\nSubmitted September 12, 2005 -

Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to issuance of a letter of caution, an admonition, or a public reprimand and to the imposition of other requirements.Â  We accept the agreement. The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nOn or about August 24, 2000, respondent received a Covenant Not to Execute and a settlement check from opposing counsel to settle a portion of a claim for damages arising out of the death of respondentâ€™s clientâ€™s son.Â  The probate judge approved the settlement at a hearing on August 24, 2000.Â  Thereafter, on September 12, 2000, the probate court judge signed a written order approving the settlement and the clientâ€™s agreement to sign a Covenant Not to Execute.Â  The client timely executed the Covenant Not to Execute, however, the original document was misplaced and was not received by opposing counsel.Â Â  \r\nRespondent delayed in responding to opposing counselâ€™s requests that the executed Covenant Not to Execute be returned to him.Â  Opposing counsel filed a Motion to Compel respondent to either provide the executed covenant or return the settlement check.Â  Respondent did not appear at the February 26, 2001 Motion to Compel hearing before the circuit court.Â  Respondent states he has no recollection of receiving notice of this hearing.Â  \r\nOn February 27, 2001, the circuit court judge issued an order commanding respondent to deliver to opposing counsel the executed Covenant Not to Execute within ten days. Â The order also commanded respondent to pay opposing counsel $500.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees within thirty days.Â  Respondent neither appealed the order nor filed a motion for reconsideration.Â  Respondent did not comply with the order to deliver the signed Covenant Not to Execute or to pay opposing counselâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nOn March 19, 2001, opposing counsel filed a Rule to Show Cause why respondent had failed to comply with the February 27, 2001 order. Respondent failed to appear at the March 30, 2001 Rule to Show Cause hearing.Â  The circuit court judge found no valid reason why respondent had not delivered the executed covenant to opposing counsel and directed the Clerk of Court to execute the covenant.Â  Respondent subsequently paid the court-ordered attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nRespondent failed to timely respond to ODCâ€™s inquiries in this matter. \r\nMatter II\r\nA client alleged respondent failed to competently and diligently represent him. Â He further alleged respondent failed to adequately communicate with him about his pending legal matter.Â  \r\nFull investigation by ODC revealed no evidence to support the clientâ€™s allegations.Â  However, respondent failed to timely respond to ODCâ€™s inquiries in this matter.Â Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent represented Mr. Doe in a number of legal matters.Â  In 1999, Mrs. Doe consulted respondent about a potential personal injury claim arising from a dog bite.Â  Mrs. Doe alleged respondent accepted her case and a $100.00 check for costs.Â  \r\nRespondent denied accepting Mrs. Doeâ€™s case.Â  The disciplinary investigation revealed no evidence indicating respondent accepted Mrs. Doeâ€™s case.Â  Respondent represents the $100.00 check, which was from Mr. Doe, was for a legal matter for Mr. Doe and unrelated to the dog bite matter.Â  Â \r\nRespondent admits his records were insufficient to determine for which of Mr. Doeâ€™s cases the check was written.Â  Respondent also admits he could have taken steps to insure that Mrs. Doe understood he did not accept her dog bite case.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent entered into a deferred disciplinary agreement to resolve the three matters discussed above.Â  In that deferred disciplinary agreement, respondent admitted to violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct and agreed to comply with certain terms and conditions.Â  In the deferred disciplinary agreement, respondent stated that, due to injuries he sustained in an automobile accident and as a result of the terminal illness of his law partner, he did not devote sufficient attention to the management of his office and he was unable to diligently handle the volume of cases he had accepted.Â  In the deferred disciplinary agreement, respondent proposed to retain the services of a law office management advisor, meet with the advisor on stated occasions, and to insure that the advisor filed timely reports with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission).Â  Respondent agreed that his willful failure to comply with the terms of the deferred disciplinary agreement would constitute misconduct under the Rules of Professional Conduct and constitute grounds for discipline.Â  The deferred disciplinary agreement was accepted by the Investigative Panel of the Commission on January 16, 2004.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the deferred disciplinary agreement.Â  In particular, he failed to meet with his law office management advisor in accordance with specific provisions of the agreement and he failed to insure the advisor filed the reports required by the agreement.Â  Following respondentâ€™s noncompliance, the Investigative Panel terminated deferment of the discipline.Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with interests of the client); Rule 3.4(c) (lawyer shall not knowingly disobey obligation under the rules of a tribunal); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not fail to respond to lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority), and Rule 7(a)(9)it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully fail to comply with the terms of a finally accepted deferred disciplinary agreement). Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.[1]\r\nAdditionally, within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall retain the services of a law office management advisor.Â  The advisor must be a member in good standing with the South Carolina Bar and his or her services must be approved by ODC.Â  Respondent shall be responsible for the fees and costs associated with hiring the advisor. \r\nThe services of the advisor shall include the following:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         An initial review and assessment of respondentâ€™s law office management systems, including identification of problem areas and recommendations for improvement;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2.&nbsp;\r\n         A quarterly meeting with respondent (and members of his staff in the discretion of the advisor) to monitor the implementation of the advisorâ€™s recommendations;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        3.&nbsp;\r\n         Availability by telephone to respond to respondentâ€™s questions about law office management issues;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        4.&nbsp;\r\n         Within ninety (90) days of the date of this opinion, preparation of an initial report stating the extent to which respondentâ€™s law office management practices have been reviewed, suggestions for improvement, and the steps taken by respondent to implement those suggestions;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        5.\r\n         Immediate reporting to ODC of any failure on respondentâ€™s part to attend a scheduled appointment, provide requested access to information, or cooperate with the advisor in any fashion; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        6.&nbsp;\r\n         At the conclusion of one year, preparation of a final report stating the extent to which respondentâ€™s office management practices have been reviewed, the steps taken by respondent to implement the advisorâ€™s suggestions, and the advisorâ€™s opinion as to whether further improvement is necessary.Â Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nRespondent shall be responsible for the timely filing of the advisorâ€™s reports set forth in #4 and #6 above.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Respondent has agreed to pay the costs associated with the proceedings before the Commission.Â  Accordingly, respondent shall remit $130.25, which includes $104.00 for court reporter services, to the Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26054","title":"In the Matter of Ernest Hamilton","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26054","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary matter in which the Court imposed a public reprimand.","date":"2005-10-24","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Ernest Hamilton,\r\nRespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26054\r\nSubmitted September 27, 2005 - Filed October 24, 2005\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B.

Â The proposal mischaracterized part of the proposed settlement payment as a gift.Â  Respondent did not receive a response to the proposal and the litigation proceeded.Â  \r\nRespondent represents that he suffers from anxiety and was prescribed medication by a physician on an â€œas neededâ€ basis in 1994.Â  Respondent represents that, as his anxiety increased, his usage of the prescription medication also increased.Â  Respondent asserts he became addicted to the prescription medication and was suffering from this addiction at the time he sent the settlement proposal.[1] Â Respondent states that, due to his anxiety and addiction, he did not fully appreciate the consequences of portions of the settlement proposal at the time it was made, but he now acknowledges the ramifications.Â  \r\nRespondent represents he has voluntarily sought help for his addiction.Â  He states he has completed a detoxification program and has continued in an after-care program that includes intense weekly therapy and attendance at Narcotics Anonymous.Â  Respondent represents he no longed takes the prescription medicine to which he had become addicted.Â  He has entered into a contract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers and is working with a mentor in that program.\r\nRespondent was admitted to the South Carolina Bar in 1991.Â  He has no prior disciplinary history.Â  Respondent has fully cooperated with ODC.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall not assist client by participating in conduct which violates Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 4.5 (lawyer shall not threaten to present criminal charges solely to obtain an advantage in a civil matter); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).[2]Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was not addicted to illegal drugs.\r\n[2] Respondentâ€™s misconduct occurred before the effective date of the Amendments to the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See Court Order dated June 20, 2005.Â  The Rules cited in this opinion are those which were in effect at the time of respondentâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26056","title":"In the Matter of John J.

Hadden, Esquire, to serve as guardian, respondent had not contacted Attorney Hadden and, therefore, the appropriate documents concerning the appointment had not been signed and filed with the court.Â  Not wanting to disappoint his client, respondent signed Attorney Haddenâ€™s name to four (4) separate documents incident to his appointment as guardian, namely 1) Attorney Haddenâ€™s February 18, 2005, affidavit, 2) the Order Appointing Guardian Ad Litem Nisi dated March 1, 2005, 3)Â  the Answer of Guardian Ad Litem dated March 2, 2005, and 4) the Acknowledgement of Service of Guardian Ad Litem dated March 2, 2005.Â  \r\nPrior to the hearing, the family court judge requested a meeting with respondent and the guardian ad litem.

Brooks (Respondent) violated Rules 7(a)(1), 7(a)(3), 7(a)(4), 7(a)(5), and 7(a)(7) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, as well as Rule 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  The Panel recommended that Respondent receive an indefinite suspension from the practice of law, retroactive to the date of his 1996 definite suspension, and that Respondent pay the costs of this action.Â  We agree.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn 1980, Respondent was disbarred from the practice of law for failing to obey a police order in violation of the â€œblue light law,â€ for causing an affidavit to be prepared which misrepresented the incident, for having knowledge that this affidavit was fraudulently notarized, and for financing a drug deal for a client.Â  In re Brooks, 274 S.C. 601, 604-607, 267 S.E.2d 74, 75-77 (1980).Â  Respondent was reinstated to the practice of law in 1989.Â  In re Brooks, 298 S.C. 13, 13, 377 S.E.2d 827, 827 (1989).Â  According to court records, Respondent was the first attorney in South Carolina to be reinstated following disbarment.\r\nIn October of 1996, Respondent was suspended from the practice of law for nine months.Â  In re Brooks, 324 S.C. 105, 107, 477 S.E.2d 98, 99 (1996).Â  Respondent was suspended for making threatening and harassing phone calls to a clientâ€™s husband, making lewd comments to a client while inebriated in his [Respondentâ€™s] office, and serving a deposition notice on a party known to be represented by counsel when there was no discovery order.Â  Id. \r\nIn addition, the Court ordered Respondent to submit to monthly substance abuse testing during the first year following his suspension. Â Id. at 108, 477 S.E.2d at 99.Â  Following the first year, Respondent was to submit to testing every six months for two years. Â Id. Â After every test, the results were to be reported to the Court.Â  Id.Â  Respondent filed a petition for reinstatement from this suspension in January of 2002.\r\nLater that same month, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) notified the Court of a new disciplinary matter involving Respondent.Â  ODC alleged that Respondent failed to comply with the terms of his definite suspension and had committed misconduct by (1) failing to submit reports of substance abuse testing to the Court as required[1] and (2) pleading guilty to a string of alcohol related offenses occurring between October 1998 and May 1999.Â  In particular, Respondent pled guilty to:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        a.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Three (3) counts of driving under the influence, fourth offense and above, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-5-2930, 56-5-2940 (1991);\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        b.&nbsp;\r\n         Two (2) counts of driving under suspension, in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-460 (1991);\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        c.&nbsp;\r\n         One (1) count of violation of the Habitual Traffic Offender Law, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-1-1020, 56-1-1100 (Supp. 2004); and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        d.\r\n         One (1) count of leaving the scene of an accident, in violation ofÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-1220 (1991).\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Panel found that Respondent violated Rule 8.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (criminal act reflecting adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects) and the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (willfully violating a valid order of the Supreme Court); Rule 7(a)(4) (conviction of a crime of moral turpitude or a serious crime); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(7) (willfully violating a valid order issued by a court of this state).Â  The Panel recommended that Respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law, retroactive to the date of his 1996 definite suspension, and that Respondent pay the costs of this action.[2]\r\nIssues\r\nRespondent accepts the Panelâ€™s findings and conclusions, but disagrees with the recommended sanction of an indefinite suspension.Â  Respondent asks the Court to impose a definite suspension for less than nine months so that he can seek reinstatement pursuant to Rule 32 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the alternative, Respondent requests that the Court (1) waive the requirement that any future petition for reinstatement be referred to the Committee on Character and Fitness per Rule 33(d), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and (2) permit his reinstatement without fulfilling the requirements of Rule 33(f)(8), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (an attorney who has been disbarred or indefinitely suspended must take and pass the Bar Examination, take and pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam, and complete the Bridge the Gap program). \r\nRespondent additionally requests that the Court allow reinstatement from his 1996 suspension in the same manner.Â  Respondent asks that the Court consider these unusual requests in light of his intention to immediately retire from the practice of law; an intention driven by Respondentâ€™s extremely poor health.[3]\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court possesses the ultimate responsibility of determining sanctions in attorney disciplinary matters.Â  In re Rushton, 286 S.C. 543, 544, 335 S.E.2d 238, 238 (1985).Â  In this case, the Court must note that several of the crimes involved are felonies under South Carolina law. Â Violation of the Habitual Traffic Offender Law is a felony. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-1100 (Supp. 2004).Â  Additionally, DUI fourth offense and above carries a minimum prison sentence of one year[4], and is therefore a felony.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-1-2030(14) (Supp. 2004).Â  In the case of Respondent, these convictions represent not Respondentâ€™s first, second, or third DUI arrests, but at least the fourth, fifth, and sixth occasions on which Respondent elected to drive while under the influence of alcohol.Â  \r\nThis Court has imposed varying degrees of sanctions in cases involving a DUI conviction.Â  Looking at existing case law, Respondentâ€™s disciplinary history, and the serious nature of the offenses for which Respondent was convicted, we find that the proper sanction is an indefinite suspension retroactive to the date of Respondentâ€™s 1996 definite suspension.Â  Should Respondent desire to gain readmission to the practice of law, he must proceed according to Rule 33(d), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (unless otherwise directed by the Supreme Court, the petition for reinstatement shall be referred to the Committee on Character and Fitness), and Rule 33(f)(8), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (an attorney who has been disbarred or indefinitely suspended must take and pass the Bar Examination, take and pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam, and complete the Bridge the Gap program).Â  \r\nBecause Respondent has not satisfied the above requirements, we decline to address the issue of Respondentâ€™s petition for reinstatement from the 1996 definite suspension.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe are deeply saddened by the current state of Respondentâ€™s health.Â  However, we cannot ignore the serious nature of the conduct here at issue, nor can we simply overlook the fact that Respondent has twice before been sanctioned for attorney misconduct, including being disbarred from the practice of law.Â  Accordingly, we concur in the recommended sanction of the Panel and order that Respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law, retroactive to the date of his 1996 definite suspension, and that Respondent pay the costs of this action.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Court records showed that results for only nine of the fifteen required substance abuse tests were submitted. Â Eventually, the Panel concluded that all required tests were in fact performed and that Respondent had merely failed to ensure that the remaining six test results were submitted to the Court.Â  \r\n[2] The Panelâ€™s award of costs has not been contested.Â  See In re Yarborough, 348 S.C. 243, 249, 559 S.E.2d 836, 839-840 (2002) (holding that failure to take exception to the Panelâ€™s report constitutes an acceptance of the report).Â  \r\n[3] Respondent is seriously ill, is undergoing treatment, and has a poor prognosis.Â  \r\n[4] See S.C.

Gibbs, Jr., of Gibbs &amp; Holmes, and Donald H. Howe of Howe &amp; Wyndham, both of Charleston, for respondent.Â Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a letter of caution, admonition, or public reprimand pursuant to Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  The facts as set forth in the Agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent is a municipal court judge for the City of Charleston.Â  At approximately 9:15 p.m. on November 8, 2003, respondent was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in Mount Pleasant.Â  Respondent was also charged with having an open container in his vehicle in violation of South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 61-6-4020 (Supp. 2004).Â  Â \r\nRespondent was transported to the Mount Pleasant Police Department for paperwork and administration of a Datamaster test.Â  While there, respondent learned that, under procedures established by the Mount Pleasant Chief Municipal Judge, the bond for DUI was $1,002.00, but that bond could not be posted at that time.Â  Instead, under the established procedures, Judge Mendelsohn would be transferred to the Charleston County Detention Facility where he would remain until a bond hearing could be held the next morning at approximately 8:00 a.m.Â  \r\nRespondent knew the Mount Pleasant procedure was not the same as the procedure used in Charleston.Â  In Charleston, an arrestee can post the preset bond and be released without having to wait for a bond hearing.Â  Respondent believed the Mount Pleasant procedure was illegal and questioned the arresting officer, sergeant, and a lieutenant.Â  \r\nRespondent was allowed to use the telephone.Â  He called a Mount Pleasant municipal judge, again questioned the cityâ€™s procedure, and asked the judge to speak with the sergeant about the bond policy.Â  After speaking with the sergeant, the Mount Pleasant judge explained the policy to respondent.Â Â  \r\nAfter first attempting to telephone another Charleston County magistrate, respondent contacted Charleston County Magistrate James B. Gosnell, Jr.Â  Magistrate Gosnell was unfamiliar with the Mount Pleasant bond procedure.Â  Â \r\nMagistrate Gosnell asked the Mount Pleasant lieutenant why respondent could not be released.Â  After the lieutenant explained the procedure, Magistrate Gosnell remarked that he would go to the bond court and conduct a bond hearing for respondent that night.Â  Magistrate Gosnell asked that respondent be brought directly to bond court rather than first being booked into the detention center.Â  The lieutenant refused to bypass the standard booking procedure, stating respondent would be booked like any other defendant. The lieutenant then advised the arresting officer that Magistrate Gosnell would be at the Charleston County Detention Center to conduct a bond hearing.Â  \r\nMagistrate Gosnell met the arresting officer and respondent at the detention center.Â  At some point, Magistrate Gosnell took possession of the ticket, placed a â€œbond hearingâ€ stamp on the back, and entered the amount of $1,002.00.Â  Magistrate Gosnell communicated his setting of the bond to the Mount Pleasant Chief Judge and asked the judge to indicate his approval of the bond.Â  The Mount Pleasant Chief Judge called the Charleston County Detention Center and was advised that officers were in possession of a valid bond set by Magistrate Gosnell.Â  The Mount Pleasant Chief Judge told the officers that, since a bond had been set, the bond procedure he had established did not apply.Â  Respondent was released from the Charleston County Detention Center at approximately 2:30 a.m.Â  \r\nRespondent represents his contact with Magistrate Gosnell and others was only for the purpose of determining the validity of the Mount Pleasant bond procedure, which he believed to be illegal, and was not to obtain preferential treatment or to be excused from the established procedure.Â  Respondent acknowledges, however, that his contact with other judges concerning his ability to post bond has the appearance of seeking preferential treatment.Â  \r\nRespondent further represents he did not ask Magistrate Gosnell to set a bond outside the established procedure.Â  Respondent asserts that, although he did have personal contact with Magistrate Gosnell, he was not aware of all of Magistrate Gosnellâ€™s actions because he was involved in the booking process at the detention center and, at some point, was placed in a cell.Â  \r\nAdditionally, respondent represents his recollection is cloudy inasmuch as he was under the influence of alcohol.Â  Respondent contends he has no personal knowledge as to the individual actions and conversations of Magistrate Gosnell and others and that he learned of their activities only after the complaint in this matter was filed.Â  However, for purposes of this Agreement, respondent does not dispute the allegations.Â  \r\nRespondent agreed to and did forfeit bond on the DUI and open liquor offenses.Â  \r\nTo the best of ODCâ€™s knowledge, respondent has been forthright and cooperative in this matter.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent used his judicial office to evade the policies of the arresting jurisdiction in order to obtain a non-scheduled bond hearing and early release from jail.Â  His misconduct violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon\r\n2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); and Canon 2B (judge shall not lend the prestige of his judicial office to advance the judgeâ€™s private interests).Â  By violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent has also violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR (it shall be ground for discipline for a judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct).Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand. Â Accordingly, respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to Rule 402, SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2005-10-18-01","description":"This is an order which changes the early filing deadline for the July Bar Examination.","date":"2005-10-24","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRE:Â  Amendment to Rule 402, SCACR\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPursuant to Article V, Â§4A, of the South Carolina Constitution, Rule 402(d)(1)(i) is amendedÂ  by replacing Â the phrase â€œDecember 31â€ with the\r\nphrase â€œJanuary 10.â€\r\nThis change shall be effective immediately. \r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      s/Jean H.
