Coggiola and Deputy Disciplinary Counsel Barbara M. Seymour,\r\n  both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Council.\r\nMatthew Edward\r\n  Davis, of Gilbert, pro se, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â \r\n  In this attorney discipline matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC)\r\n  filed formal charges on allegations of misconduct against Matthew Edward Davis\r\n  (Respondent) stemming from alleged violations of eight different Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct.Â  Following a hearing, the Hearing Panel of the Commission\r\n  on Lawyer Conduct (Panel) recommended Respondent be disbarred and ordered to\r\n  pay the costs of these proceedings.Â  The Panel also recommended that Respondent\r\n  be ordered to pay restitution, reimbursement, and be required to complete the\r\n  Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust Account School, as a\r\n  condition of reinstatement.Â  Neither ODC nor Respondent took exception to the\r\n  Panel's recommended sanctions.Â  We agree with the Panel's findings, and adopt\r\n  all of the recommended sanctions. \r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nMatter A\r\n Respondent\r\n  has been convicted for numerous traffic offenses between 1998 and 2008,\r\n  including twenty driver's license suspensions and fourteen violations for\r\n  Driving Under Suspension (DUS).Â  \r\nMatter B\r\n In\r\n  2004, Respondent closed four loans in which his client's construction company\r\n  purchased real properties.Â  Respondent withheld approximately $3,000 from the\r\n  four closings to pay property taxes on his client's behalf.Â  Because Respondent\r\n  did not pay the taxes, this forced the client to pay these taxes from his own\r\n  income to avoid a tax sale.Â  Additionally, Respondent used the withheld funds\r\n  to pay a &quot;consultant,&quot; unauthorized by the client, and who did not actually\r\n  participate in the closing transactions.Â  The closing's settlement statements,\r\n  prepared by Respondent, erroneously reflected property tax payments that did\r\n  not occur and did not accurately reflect the unauthorized payment to a\r\n  consultant.Â  \r\nMatter C\r\n Respondent\r\n  accepted $350 from a client and agreed to perform title work, and to obtain a\r\n  title insurance policy.Â  Respondent used the client's funds to pay the premium\r\n  to the title insurance company, but the client never received the policy.Â  Respondent\r\n  claims that a previous outstanding mortgage on the property prevented issuance\r\n  of the policy, but admitted that he should not have used the client's money to\r\n  pay the premium after the policy could not be obtained.Â  \r\nMatter D\r\nIn\r\n  1996, Respondent handled property transactions for a deceased woman's estate.Â \r\n  Respondent accepted funds on behalf of the estate's heirs but one of the heirs\r\n  could not be located.Â  Respondent deposited $1,486.11 into a Certificate of\r\n  Deposit (CD) account at BB&amp;T on behalf of the missing heir.Â  Respondent\r\n  closed the CD account in May 2003 and deposited the funds into an investment\r\n  account with Carolina First Bank (Carolina First)[1]. Â Â Respondent\r\n  then withdrew the entire amount, an estimated $2,794.62, and transferred the\r\n  funds to his friend, an investor in California.Â  This transfer and subsequent\r\n  investment led to the loss of all funds.Â  Â \r\nMatter E\r\nIn\r\n  2002, Respondent contracted with a title abstractor to perform work on behalf\r\n  of Respondent's clients.Â  Respondent failed to pay the title abstractor for the\r\n  work she performed.Â  The title abstractor sued Respondent for $25,090 and\r\n  obtained a default judgment. Â Although Respondent disputes the total amount\r\n  owed he did not appeal or contest the default judgment.Â  The default judgment\r\n  remains outstanding.Â  Â \r\nMatter F\r\n This\r\n  Court placed Respondent on interim suspension on February 4, 2005. Â Â ODC\r\n  alleged that Respondent engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by\r\n  continuing to represent clients, and assist others in the practice of law\r\n  during his suspension.Â  \r\nSpecifically,\r\n  ODC alleged that in 2005 and 2006, Respondent's friend approached him with\r\n  mortgages already bearing the borrower's signatures.Â  Respondent then signed as\r\n  a witness to the borrower's signatures, even though Respondent did not know\r\n  whether an attorney facilitated the closing and did not witness the borrowers execute\r\n  the documents.Â  Respondent then notarized the attestation clause falsely\r\n  stating that he witnessed the mortgage's execution.Â  \r\n In\r\n  2009, ODC alleges, a client retained Respondent to conduct a title search and\r\n  render a title opinion in exchange for $100.Â  Respondent failed to provide the\r\n  title opinion in a timely manner, and blamed the delay on out-of-state\r\n  &quot;litigation.&quot;Â  Respondent claims that he requested the $100 payment\r\n  from the client to pay for copy expenses, and that he agreed to check the title\r\n  only, not to provide a title opinion.Â  However, in an email communication with\r\n  the client, Respondent referred to himself as &quot;esquire,&quot; and stated\r\n  his intention to provide a &quot;final opinion of title.&quot;Â  \r\nPanel's Recommendation\r\nThe\r\n  Panel found that Respondent committed misconduct with respect to all of the\r\n  above matters.Â  Therefore the Panel found Respondent violated the following\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.15\r\n  (Safekeeping of Property); Rule 4.1 (Truthfulness in Statements to Others);\r\n  Rule 4.4 (Respect for Rights of Third Persons); Rule 5.5 (Unauthorized Practice\r\n  of Law); Rule 8.1(b) (Bar Admissions and Disciplinary Matters); Rule 8.4\r\n  (Conduct Involving Dishonesty); Rule 8.4(b) (Criminal Conduct); and Rule 8.4(d)\r\n  (Conduct Involving Dishonesty).Â  The Panel also determined the Respondent\r\n  violated Rule 417 (Financial Recordkeeping), SCACR. \r\nThe\r\n  Panel considered three aggravating circumstances: Respondent's prior\r\n  disciplinary offenses[2],\r\n  the pattern of misconduct, and Respondent's lack of cooperation with ODC's\r\n  investigation.[3]Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on these findings the Panel recommended that this Court: (1) disbar Respondent\r\n  from the practice of law; (2) order Respondent to pay restitution to his former\r\n  clients and third parties harmed by his misconduct (3) order Respondent to\r\n  reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for sums paid on his behalf; and\r\n  (4) require Respondent to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics\r\n  School and Trust Account School as a condition of reinstatement.Â  \r\nII. Discussion\r\nThe\r\n  sole authority to discipline attorneys and decide appropriate sanctions rests\r\n  with this Court.Â  In re Welch, 355 S.C. 93, 96, 584 S.E.2d 369, 370\r\n  (2003); In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10-11, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  We\r\n  are not bound by the Panel's recommendation and may make our own findings of\r\n  fact and conclusions of law.Â  In re Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661\r\n  S.E.2d 102, 106 (2008).Â  Nonetheless, the findings and conclusions of the Panel\r\n  are entitled much respect and consideration.Â  Thompson, 343 S.C. at 11,\r\n  539 S.E.2d at 401.Â  Moreover, &quot;[a] violation must be proven by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence.&quot;Â  In re Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d\r\n  677, 682 (2006); see also Rule 8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCAR (&quot;Charges of\r\n  misconduct or incapacity shall be established by clear and convincing evidence,\r\n  and the burden of proof of the charges shall be on the disciplinary\r\n  counsel.&quot;). \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Panel that Respondent committed misconduct with respect to all\r\n  of the matters discussed above.Â  Neither party takes exception to the Panel's\r\n  findings.Â  Accordingly, &quot;the parties are deemed to have accepted the\r\n  Panel's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations&quot; as to\r\n  these matters.Â  In re Prendergast, 390 S.C. 395, 396 n.2, 702 S.E.2d\r\n  364, 365 n.2 (2010) (citing Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, which\r\n  states &quot;The failure of a party to file a brief taking exceptions to the\r\n  report constitutes acceptance of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\r\n  recommendations.&quot;).Â  \r\nThus\r\n  we find Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\r\n  407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping of Property); Rule 4.1\r\n  (Truthfulness in Statements to Others); Rule 4.4 (Respect for Rights of Third\r\n  Persons); Rule 5.5 (Unauthorized Practice of Law); Rule 8.1(b) (Bar Admissions\r\n  and Disciplinary Matters); Rule 8.4 (Conduct Involving Dishonesty); Rule 8.4(b)\r\n  (Criminal Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (Conduct Involving Dishonesty); and Rule 417\r\n  (Financial Recordkeeping) SCACR.\r\n We\r\n  conclude that Respondent's misconduct, coupled with his failure to provide any\r\n  explanation, warrants disbarment from the practice of law.Â  This Court has\r\n  recognized that &quot;the primary purpose of disbarment . . . is the removal of\r\n  an unfit person from the profession for the protection of the courts and the\r\n  public, not punishment of the offending attorney.&quot; Â In re Pennington,\r\n  393 S.C. 300, 304, 713 S.E.2d 261, 263 (2011) (citing In re Burr, 267\r\n  S.C. 419, 423, 228 S.E.2d 678, 680 (1976)).Â  Moreover, a central purpose of the\r\n  disciplinary process is to protect the public from unscrupulous and indifferent\r\n  lawyers.Â  In re Hall, 333 S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998); see\r\n    also In re Sifly, 279 S.C. 113, 115, 302 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1983) (finding disbarment appropriate for an attorney who failed to timely file an appeal on\r\n  behalf of a client, failed to adequately represent a client in a trust fund\r\n  matter resulting in significant monetary losses by the client, drew checks on\r\n  his personal account that were not sufficiently funded, had a civil judgment\r\n  entered against him, and failed to cooperate with disciplinary authorities or\r\n  appear to contest the charges against him).Â Â Â  \r\n Respondent\r\n  engaged in conduct which violated state law and the orders of this Court.Â  He\r\n  failed to adequately represent clients, sufficiently respect the rights of\r\n  third parties, or satisfy adverse monetary judgments.Â  Respondent is clearly\r\n  not fit to practice law.Â  We disbar Respondent.Â  Within fifteen days of\r\n  the filing date of this opinion, Respondent shall surrender his certificate of\r\n  admission to practice law and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court\r\n  showing he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp; \r\n Pursuant\r\n  to the Panel's recommendations, Respondent is ordered to pay restitution to his\r\n  former clients and third parties harmed by his misconduct, reimburse the\r\n  Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for sums paid on his behalf, and complete\r\n  the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust Account School as\r\n  a condition of his reinstatement. Further, Respondent is ordered to pay the\r\n  costs of the Panel proceedings within 60 days.Â  Â \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At the\r\n  hearing, Respondent\r\n  failed to provide documentation of any investment account at Carolina First or\r\n  any deposits made into such an account.Â  \r\n[2] Respondent's\r\n  disciplinary history includes a letter of caution in 1998 citing Rules 1.1\r\n  (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), and 1.15 (Safekeeping Property) of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR; a public reprimand in 2000 for failing\r\n  to comply with Rule 417 (Financial Recordkeeping) SCACR, and for violations of\r\n  Rules 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.15 (Safekeeping Property) and 8.4(a)\r\n  and (e) (Misconduct) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR; and\r\n  a definite suspension for sixty days in 2002 for violating Rules 1.1\r\n  (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication), 3.2 (Expediting\r\n  Litigation), 5.5 (Unauthorized Practice Law), and 8.4(a) and (e) (Misconduct)\r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n[3] Throughout ODC's\r\n  investigation into all of the matters described above, Respondent failed to\r\n  comply with ODC's requests and subpoenas.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27072","title":"Cole v.

Stratton, of Murphy\r\n  &amp; Grantland, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  HEARN: David Cole, the primary\r\n  appellant, was injured while catching during a father-son game of softball at a\r\n  Cub Scout outing when a baserunner collided with him at home plate.Â  He brought\r\n  this action alleging negligence and recklessness against the baserunner and the\r\n  sponsors of the game.Â  The circuit court judge granted summary judgment to the\r\n  baserunner, and we affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n In March 2004, David Cole and his son, David Jr., who was a\r\n  member of Cub Scout Pack 48, attended a Cub Scout family camping trip.Â  During\r\n  the course of the trip, Cole and David Jr. participated in a father-son, pick-up\r\n  softball game.Â  Jeff Wagner and his son were also on the camping trip and were\r\n  playing on the opposite team from the Coles in the softball game. Â Â Although\r\n  one of the older boys had been playing catcher, Cole took over the position\r\n  because he was afraid the boy would be hit by a foul ball or by the batter.Â  \r\n Neither of the\r\n  teams kept score, and during each inning everyone was allowed to bat. Â Apparently,\r\n  some of the fathers were playing too aggressively in the minds of some\r\n  participants and hitting the ball with full swings.Â  One of the Scout leaders,\r\n  Keith Corley, briefly interrupted the game and asked them to play more safely,\r\n  fearing that they were putting the scouts in danger.Â  \r\n During Wagner's next\r\n  turn at bat, he hit a double.Â  Another father came up to bat after him and hit\r\n  the ball into the outfield, potentially allowing Wagner to score.Â  As Wagner\r\n  reached home plate, he collided with Cole, who had moved on top of the plate,\r\n  thereby placing his body directly in the baseline.Â  Wagner was running so fast\r\n  that he was unable to stop or change directions in time to avoid Cole.Â  Upon impact,\r\n  Wagner flipped in the air and landed on a bat, breaking a rib.Â  Cole\r\n  suffered a closed head injury and was rendered semiconscious.Â  He then began\r\n  bleeding and went into convulsions.Â  Cole had to be airlifted to Palmetto\r\n  Richland Hospital where he spent two days in the intensive care unit.Â  David\r\n  Jr. witnessed the entire accident in fear that his father was going to die.Â  \r\n Cole and his wife\r\n  Karen, personally and as guardian ad litem for David Jr. (collectively,\r\n  Appellants), brought this action against Wagner, the Boy Scouts of America,\r\n  Indian Waters Council of the Boy Scouts of America, Pack 48, and Faith\r\n  Presbyterian Church for personal injury, loss of consortium, and negligent\r\n  infliction of emotional distress.Â  Wagner[1] moved for summary judgment, contending he owed no duty to Cole because Cole\r\n  assumed the risks incident to the sport of softball.Â  The circuit court granted\r\n  Wagner's motion, and this appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n An appellate court\r\n  reviewing a grant of summary judgment applies the same standard used by the\r\n  trial court.Â  Doe ex rel. Doe v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 393 S.C. 240, 244,\r\n  711 S.E.2d 908, 910 (2011).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate if &quot;there is\r\n  no genuine issue as to any material fact.&quot; Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â In\r\n  determining whether a triable issue of material fact exists, the Court must\r\n  construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-movant.Â  Wogan v. Kunze, 379 S.C. 581, 585, 666 S.E.2d 901, 903\r\n  (2008)Â  &quot;In order to withstand a motion for summary judgment in cases applying the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only\r\n  required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence.&quot;Â  Turner\r\n    v. Milliman, 392 S.C. 116, 122, 708 S.E.2d 766, 769 (2011).Â  &quot;A motion\r\n  for summary judgment on the basis\r\n  of the absence of a duty is a question\r\n  of law for the court to determine.&quot;Â  Oblachinski\r\n    v. Reynolds, 391 S.C. 557, 560, 706 S.E.2d 844, 845 (2011).Â  If a legal\r\n  duty is established, whether the defendant breached that duty is a question of\r\n  fact.Â  Singletary v. S.C. Dept. of Educ., 316 S.C. 153, 157, 447 S.E.2d\r\n  231, 233 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  that the circuit court erred in finding Cole assumed the risk of his injury by\r\n  engaging in a game of softball because Wagner's conduct was outside the scope\r\n  of the game.Â  Specifically, Appellants argue Wagner's behavior was inconsistent\r\n  with the ordinary risks of softball because the game was intended to be\r\n  noncompetitive, Wagner violated a rule of the game, and he acted recklessly.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n &quot;Primary implied assumption of risk arises when\r\n  the plaintiff impliedly assumes those risks that are inherent in a\r\n  particular activity.&quot;Â  Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal\r\n    Prop. Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 81, 508 S.E.2d 565, 570 (1998).Â  The doctrine of\r\n  primary implied assumption of risk &quot;goes to the initial determination of\r\n  whether the defendant's legal duty encompasses the risk encountered by the\r\n  plaintiff.&quot;Â  Id.Â  To establish a claim for negligence, a plaintiff\r\n  must first show that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.Â  Doe,\r\n  393 S.C. at 246, 711 S.E.2d at 911.Â  Absent a legally recognized duty, the\r\n  defendant in a negligence action is entitled to a judgment as matter of law.Â  Hurst\r\n    v. East Coast Hockey League, 371 S.C. 33, 37, 637 S.E.2d 560, 562 (2006).\r\n In Hurst, we\r\n  considered the application of assumption of risk in a sports context.Â  The\r\n  plaintiff was injured when a hockey puck struck him in the face while he was\r\n  watching a professional hockey game.Â  371 S.C. at 36, 673 S.E.2d at 561.Â  The\r\n  plaintiff sued the hockey team for negligence, and we affirmed the grant of\r\n  summary judgment for the team finding that &quot;a flying puck is inherent to\r\n  the game of hockey and is also a common, expected, and frequent risk of\r\n  hockey.&quot;Â  Id. at 38, 673 S.E.2d at 562-63.Â  We held that by\r\n  attending the hockey game, the plaintiff implicitly assumed the risks inherent\r\n  in the sport and the defendant had no duty to protect him from those risks.Â  Id. at 38, 673 S.E.2d at 562. \r\n Appellants argue\r\n  that Hurst is factually distinguishable, and therefore inapplicable, since\r\n  the plaintiff in Hurst was a spectator and the game was being played by\r\n  a professional team.Â  Both of these arguments are unavailing.Â  We acknowledge\r\n  that the duty owed by a player to a spectator may differ in form to a duty owed\r\n  to a coparticipant in a sport, but only because a duty owed to a spectator\r\n  would be greater.Â  Thus, if anything, by playing the game, Cole assumed a\r\n  greater risk than the plaintiff in Hurst who was a mere spectator.\r\n Furthermore, it is\r\n  legally inconsequential that Hurst involved a professional sport.Â  Hurst contained no qualifying language to limit its holding to the professional\r\n  sports context, and we take this opportunity to emphasize that the critical fact\r\n  is not the level of play, but the nature of the sport itself.Â  See Marchetti\r\n    v. Kalish, 559 N.E.2d 699, 702 (Ohio 1990) (&quot;Whether the activity is\r\n  organized, unorganized, supervised or unsupervised is immaterial to the\r\n  standard of liability.&quot;).Â  A risk inherent in a sport can be found at any\r\n  level of play, possibly more so in a non-professional arena where the players engage\r\n  with less skill and athleticism.Â  While Cole was playing a casual game in which\r\n  the teams did not even keep score, he was still playing softball, which is a\r\n  contact sport.[2]Â \r\n  Where a person chooses to participate in a contact sport, whatever the level of\r\n  play, he assumes the risks inherent in that sport.Â  See Landrum v. Gonzales,\r\n  629 N.E.2d 710, 714 (Ill. App. Ct. 1994) (noting that the relative inquiry into\r\n  the standard of care is whether the sport is a contact sport, which should be\r\n  determined &quot;by examining the objective factors surrounding the game\r\n  itself, not on the subjective expectations of the parties&quot;); Keller v.\r\n    Mols, 509 N.E.2d 584, 586 (Ill. App. Ct. 1987) (&quot;[I]n\r\n  determining whether a sports participant may be liable for injuries to another\r\n  player caused by mere negligence, the relevant inquiry is whether the\r\n  participants were involved in a contact sport,\r\n  not whether they were organized and coached.&quot;).Â  Therefore by playing\r\n  softball, Cole assumed those risks that are integral to the sport of softball,\r\n  which includes the risk of a collision at home plate.\r\n Appellants accordingly\r\n  contend that Wagner violated a rule of softball by &quot;running over the\r\n  catcher during a play at home plate,&quot; and therefore his conduct was\r\n  outside the scope of the game.Â  However, the risk of someone violating a rule\r\n  of the game is one of the risks taken when engaging in a sport. See Landrum,\r\n  629 N.E.2d at 714 (citing Oswald v. Township High Sch. Dist. No. 214,\r\n  406 N.E.2d 157, 160 (Ill. Ct. App. 1980)) (noting that &quot;rule infractions,\r\n  deliberate or unintentional, are virtually inevitable in contact games&quot;\r\n  and thus a different standard of care in such sports is justified).Â  If no one\r\n  ever violated the rules, then there would be no need for penalty shots in\r\n  basketball, a penalty box in hockey, or flags on the field in football.Â \r\n  Collisions at home plate are common, mainly because catchers often attempt to\r\n  keep a runner from scoring by blocking the plate with their body.Â  Even if a\r\n  rule prohibits running into the catcher, that fact alone is insufficient\r\n  evidence to show the injury resulting from the violation of the rule was not\r\n  inherent in the sport.Â  \r\n As a final matter, Appellants\r\n  argue that even if mere negligence may be outside the duty of care, Wagner's\r\n  conduct was reckless and therefore outside the scope of risks assumed in the\r\n  game of softball.Â  &quot;[R]ecklessness or willfulness may be inferred from\r\n  conduct so grossly negligent that a person of ordinary reason and prudence\r\n  would then have been conscious of the probability of resulting injury.&quot; Yuan\r\n    v. Baldridge, 243 S.C. 414, 419, 134 S.E.2d 248, 251 (1964).Â  &quot;[R]ecklessness\r\n  implies the doing of a negligent act knowingly . . . [or] the conscious failure\r\n  to exercise due care.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting State v. Rachels, 218\r\n  S.C. 1, 8, 61 S.E.2d 249, 252 (1950)).Â  &quot;Due care&quot; can be defined as\r\n  &quot;that degree of care which a person of ordinary prudence and reason would\r\n  exercise under the same circumstances.&quot;Â  Berberich v. Jack, 392\r\n  S.C. 278, 287, 709 S.E.2d 607, 612 (2011) (quoting Hart v. Doe, 261 S.C.\r\n  116, 122, 198 S.E.2d 526, 529 (1973)). \r\n Even assuming,\r\n  arguendo, that Wagner's conduct could be characterized as reckless, it was not\r\n  so reckless as to involve risks outside the scope of softball.Â  The likelihood\r\n  of someone running too fast to stop or playing more aggressively than\r\n  anticipated is part of the competitive atmosphere of athletics.Â  Almost all\r\n  contact sports, especially ones that require protective gear as part of their\r\n  equipment, involve conduct that a reasonably prudent person would recognize may\r\n  result in injury.Â  To the extent these risks inhere in the sport involved, we\r\n  hold some recklessness by coparticipants in a contact sport must be assumed as\r\n  part of the game. Accordingly, a player assumes the risk of ordinary\r\n  recklessness committed within the course of the game.\r\n We emphasize that\r\n  this holding is limited to recklessness committed within the scope of the game\r\n  and does not include intentional conduct by a coparticipant of a sport, or\r\n  conduct so reckless as to be outside the scope of the game. [3]Â  Even within\r\n  the context of a contact sport, players owe reciprocal duties to not\r\n  intentionally injure each other.Â  Cole does not allege that Wagner's conduct\r\n  was intentional nor does he allege such recklessness as would fall outside the\r\n  scope of the game of softball.Â  Thus, Wagner's conduct fell within the duty of\r\n  care he owed to Cole as a coparticipant in the game.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's\r\n  order granting summary judgment in favor of Wagner.\r\n TOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the decision to affirm the grant of\r\n  summary judgment because I would find that Wagner owed no duty to Cole under\r\n  these circumstances, relying on the doctrine of implied primary assumption of\r\n  the risk.Â  Hurst v. East Coast Hockey League, 371 S.C. 33, 637 S.E.2d\r\n  560 (2006).Â  I also note that I am not convinced that a game of pick-up\r\n  softball is a contact sport.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Coles settled with all the other defendants.\r\n[2] Numerous courts across the country have similarly\r\n  acknowledged softball is a contact sport.Â  See, e.g., D'Agostino v.\r\n    Easton Sports, Inc., No. X04HHDCV085026631S, 2010 WL 5492731, at *3 (Conn.\r\n  Super.

Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2010).Â  The\r\n  Court may affirm the ALC's decision, remand the matter, or reverse or modify it \r\n\r\nif substantial rights of the appellant have been\r\n  prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or\r\n  decisions are:\r\n  \r\n(a)&nbsp; in violation of constitutional or\r\n  statutory provisions;\r\n(b)&nbsp; in excess of the statutory\r\n  authority granted of the agency;\r\n(c)&nbsp; made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n(d)&nbsp; affected by other error of law;\r\n    (e)&nbsp; clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n  reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n(f)&nbsp; Arbitrary or capricious or\r\n  characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of\r\n  discretion.\r\n  \r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nEmerson raises two issues on appeal.\r\n\r\n(1)&nbsp; Where South Carolina\r\n  law provides that a non-resident corporation's dividend income is, in all\r\n  cases, statutorily excluded from South Carolina taxable income, does South\r\n  Carolina law further allocate the interest expenses related to those excluded\r\n  dividends to the non-resident corporation's principal place of business?\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)&nbsp; If South Carolina law\r\n  does allocate the interest expenses related to the excluded dividends to the\r\n  corporation's principal place of business, is the South Carolina income allocation\r\n  statute constitutional as applied to Emerson?\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmerson is a publicly traded, Fortune 500\r\n  company engaged in worldwide manufacturing activities.Â  Its principal place of\r\n  business is near St. Louis, Missouri, but it conducts business worldwide, including\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  Emerson conducts much of its business through hundreds of\r\n  foreign and domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries, from which Emerson receives\r\n  dividends.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nEmerson and its subsidiaries timely filed\r\n  consolidated income tax returns for South Carolina in fiscal years 1999 through\r\n  2002.Â  The periods at issue are tax years 1999, 2000, and 2001 (license tax\r\n  years 2000, 2001, and 2002).Â  In its initial returns, Emerson did not claim\r\n  deductions for expenses related to its receipt of dividends from subsidiary\r\n  corporations.Â  Emerson later filed amended returns, claiming the deductions and\r\n  seeking a refund.[1]Â \r\n  Emerson's claimed entitlement to the deductions on its South Carolina returns\r\n  is the question before the Court.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n A.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand Emerson's claim concerning\r\n  the expense deductions, it is necessary to understand the income side of the\r\n  ledger, together with South Carolina's &quot;matching principle.&quot;Â  Emerson\r\n  properly excludes from its taxable income dividends received from its\r\n  wholly-owned subsidiaries.Â  This is so because, for both federal and South Carolina income tax purposes, dividends\r\n  received by a parent corporation from a wholly-owned subsidiary generally will\r\n  not be subject to income tax.Â  See I.R.C. Â§ 243 (2006); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-6-40 (2000) (incorporating the Internal Revenue Code by reference); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-6-1110 (defining South Carolina taxable income by reference to\r\n  federal taxable income).Â  This is referred to as the &quot;Dividends Received\r\n  Deduction,&quot; (DRD) and the statute technically allows a one-hundred percent\r\n  deduction against qualifying dividend income.Â  The result is that such\r\n  qualifying dividend income is not taxable.Â  Here, it is stipulated that Emerson's\r\n  claimed expenses are related to dividend income qualifying for the DRD.Â  Thus, for\r\n  the years in question, the DRD permitted Emerson to claim no taxable income for\r\n  federal or South Carolina purposes as a result of the dividends it received from its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nEmerson argues the ALC erroneously\r\n  determined that, pursuant to S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-6-2220(2) (2000), certain expense\r\n  deductions of Emerson must be allocated to its principal place of business (Missouri),\r\n  and therefore Emerson could not use those deductions for South Carolina income\r\n  tax purposes.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA multistate corporation that conducts its\r\n  business partly within South Carolina is subject to state income tax based on\r\n  the portion of its business conducted in the state.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-6-2210(B) (Supp. 2010).Â  The portion of a corporation's total income that is\r\n  taxable in South Carolina is determined through a statutory scheme, which\r\n  distinguishes between the business and non-business income of a\r\n  multi-jurisdictional enterprise.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nA corporation's business income is\r\n  apportioned among the states in which it conducts business.Â  South Carolina levies\r\n  tax upon only the percentage of the taxpayer's total business which is\r\n  conducted within the state.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-6-2210(B) (2000); Container Corp. of Am. v. Franchise Tax Bd.,\r\n  463 U.S. 159, 164 (1983) (&quot;Under both the Due Process and the Commerce\r\n  Clauses of the Constitution, a state may not, when imposing an income-based\r\n  tax, tax value earned outside its borders.&quot;) (internal quotations\r\n  omitted); U.S. Steel Corp. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 259 S.C. 153, 156, 191 S.E.2d 9, 10 (1972) (&quot;The\r\n  statutory policy is designed to apportion to South Carolina a fraction of the\r\n  taxpayer's total income reasonably attributable to its business activity in\r\n  this State.&quot;).Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn contrast, a multi-jurisdictional enterprise's non-business income is not apportioned among various states.Â  Rather,\r\n  non-business income is allocated to or deemed to be earned in a particular\r\n  state depending on its form.[2]Â \r\n  If non-business income is not allocated to South Carolina, both the income and\r\n  related expenses are disregarded in the computation of South Carolina income\r\n  tax.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  12-6-2220 to -2230 (Supp. 2010).Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDuring the relevant time period, South\r\n  Carolina's allocation statute provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following items of income must be directly\r\n  allocated and excluded from the apportioned income and the\r\n  apportionment factors:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) Dividends received from corporate\r\n  stocks owned, less all related expenses, are allocated to the state of\r\n  the corporation's principal place of business . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-6-2220 (emphasis added).[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding expense deductions, South\r\n  Carolina follows the &quot;matching principle.&quot;Â  Succinctly stated, where\r\n  income is taxable in South Carolina, the expenses incurred in generating that\r\n  income may be matched against it as a deduction in South Carolina.Â  See Dalton v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 295 S.C. 174, 179, 367 S.E.2d 459, 462 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988) (&quot;The principle of matching income not\r\n  taxable in South Carolina . . . with the expenses that generated that\r\n  non-taxable income is firmly established as the law in South Carolina.&quot;).Â \r\n  Conversely, where income is not taxable in South Carolina, as is the case here,\r\n  the expenses incurred in generating that income may not be matched against it\r\n  as a deduction in South Carolina.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs concerns the construction of section\r\n  12-6-2220(2), although we granted Emerson's motion to argue against precedent, we\r\n  adhere to Avco Corp. v. Wasson, 267 S.C. 581, 230 S.E.2d 614 (1976).[4]Â  Avco construed the predecessor to section 12-6-2220 to require that if\r\n  dividend income was allocated out-of-state, the\r\n  expenses related to that allocable dividend income must also be allocated\r\n  out-of-state.Â  For purposes of applying this statute, we reject Emerson's\r\n  contention that allocation of related expenses is triggered only in the\r\n  presence of taxable income from the receipt of a dividend.Â  Avco spoke\r\n  to the issue of allocation of related expense where no dividend was received:\r\n  &quot;Although [section 12-6-2220(2)] refers to the allocation of 'Dividends\r\n  received . . . , less all related expenses,' the actual receipt of a dividend\r\n  from each stock purchased is not required before the interest expenses . . . are\r\n  to be allocated.&quot;Â  Id. at 586, 230 S.E.2d at 616.\r\n  \r\n  Avco properly construes section 12-6-2220(2).[5]Â \r\n    Accordingly, we find Avco supports DOR's determination to allocate Emerson's\r\n    related expenses to its principal place of business, Missouri.Â  We turn now to Emerson's\r\n    constitutional challenge to section 12-6-2220(2).\r\n  \r\n B. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmerson argues in the alternative that\r\n  section 12-6-2220(2), as applied, discriminates against non-resident taxpayers\r\n  in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.[6]Â  We disagree and reject Emerson's\r\n  premise that a disparate tax effect on two geographically diverse taxpayers,\r\n  viewed only in the context of one taxpayerâ€™s geographic domicile, constitutes unconstitutional\r\n  discrimination.Â  The constitutional challenge to section 12-6-2220(2) is made\r\n  only because Emerson was not allowed the interest expense deductions in its\r\n  home state of Missouriâ€”a feature of Missouri law over which we have no control.[7]Â  We reject the implication that the constitutionality of one\r\n  stateâ€™s allocation statute turns on the allowance of certain deductions in\r\n  another state.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n&quot;When the issue is the constitutionality of a\r\n  statute, every presumption will be made in favor of its validity and no statute\r\n  will be declared unconstitutional unless its invalidity appears so clearly as\r\n  to leave no doubt that it conflicts with the constitution.&quot; Home Health\r\n  Serv., Inc. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 312 S.C.\r\n  324, 327, 440 S.E.2d 375, 377 (1994).Â  &quot;Accordingly, the burden is on the\r\n  appellant to prove the unconstitutionality of the statute.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Emerson\r\n  has not met that burden.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe record reveals Emerson availed itself of these\r\n  same deductions numerous times against its taxable income in various other taxing\r\n  jurisdictions.[8]Â \r\n  We further point out that Emerson does not contend its non-taxable dividend\r\n  income has any nexus with this state.Â  Emerson neither claims section 12-6-2220\r\n  provides a direct commercial advantage to local businesses, nor contends that\r\n  application of section 12-6-2220 results in any discrimination where a\r\n  corporation's dividend income\r\n  is taxable.[9]Â  Rather, Emerson objects only to the application of section\r\n  12-6-2220 to deny interest deductions related to dividends that are not taxable\r\n  in South Carolina because such an application results in disparate treatment of\r\n  taxpayers based solely on residence.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe ALC correctly noted that section\r\n  12-6-2220 is an allocation statute, not a taxing statute.Â  The United States\r\n  Supreme Court has never found allocation itself unconstitutional.Â  While\r\n  allocation provisions are not immune from a successful Commerce Clause\r\n  challenge, by nature allocation rules necessarily result in income and expenses\r\n  being assigned to different geographic locations for similarly situated\r\n  taxpayers.Â  See 2 Richard D. Pomp &amp; Oliver Oldman, State &amp;\r\n  Local Taxation 10-26 to -29 (5th ed. 2005).Â  The Commerce Clause does not require any particular method of\r\n  allocation or apportionment, nor does it prohibit variety in methods among\r\n  states.Â  See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U.S. 267, 278 n.12\r\n  (1978) (describing disparate tax burdens alleged to be discriminatory as\r\n  &quot;simply a way of describing the potential consequences of the use of\r\n  different formulas by [various] States&quot;).Â  Moreover, we find Shaffer v. Carter Â instructive.Â \r\n  252 U.S. 37 (1920).Â  The United States\r\n  Supreme Court in Shaffer upheld Oklahoma's denial of deductions for out-of-state\r\n  losses to non-residents who were subject to Oklahoma's tax on in-state income. Â In rejecting the claim that Oklahoma's income tax act was\r\n  discriminatory, the Supreme Court stated:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  The difference [between residents and non-residents],\r\n    however, is only such as arises naturally from the extent of the jurisdiction\r\n    of the state in the two classes of cases, and cannot be regarded as unfriendly\r\n    or unreasonable discrimination.Â  As to residents it may, and does, exert its\r\n    taxing power over their income from all sources, whether within or without the\r\n    state, and it accords to them a corresponding privilege of deducting their\r\n    losses, wherever those accrue.Â  As to nonresidents, the jurisdiction extends\r\n    only to their property owned within the state and their business, trade, or\r\n    profession carried on therein, and the tax is only on such income as is derived\r\n    from those sources.Â  Hence there is no obligation to accord to them a deduction\r\n    by reason of losses elsewhere incurred.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  Id. at 57.Â  See Lunding v. N.Y. Tax\r\n  Appeals Tribunal, 522 U.S. 287, 298-99 (1998) (affirming Shaffer's\r\n  holding that a State may limit the deductions of non-residents to those related\r\n  to the production of in-state income).[10]Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s allocation scheme\r\n  generally, and section 12-6-2220 specifically, is internally consistent.Â  The\r\n  internal consistency is readily apparent when South Carolinaâ€™s â€œmatching\r\n  principleâ€ is considered, as discussed above.Â  To adopt Emerson's position\r\n  would be to reject South Carolinaâ€™s evenhanded approach to apportionment and\r\n  allocation of matching income and expenses.Â  The allegedly disparate results\r\n  complained of by Emerson do not demonstrate unconstitutional discrimination.Â  We are persuaded that section 12-6-2220(2) satisfies the\r\n  requirements of Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274\r\n  (1977) (holding that a state tax does not violate the Commerce Clause if it is\r\n  applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state, is\r\n  fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is\r\n  fairly related to services provided by the state).Â  See also Lung v. O'Chesky, 94 N.M. 802, 804, 617 P.2d 1317, 1319\r\n  (1980) (&quot;If the state has no jurisdiction to tax the income from a\r\n  particular source, there is no reason for it to extend exemptions and\r\n  deductions to a non-resident based on that income.&quot;).Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn sum, any disparate tax consequences, which\r\n  Emerson has failed to prove, are not a result of the application of section\r\n  12-6-2220 but rather are the product of the laws of Missouri, over which we\r\n  have no control.Â  Therefore, the ALC properly found Emerson failed to carry its\r\n  burden of proving that the application of section 12-6-2220 violates the\r\n  Commerce Clause.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  IV.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe affirm the ALC and find that section\r\n  12-6-2220 applies.Â  DOR properly disallowed Emerson's related expense\r\n  deductions.Â  Emerson's related expense deductions were properly allocated to\r\n  the state of its principal place of business, Missouri.Â  We further find the\r\n  matching principle requires that, where categories of income are directly\r\n  allocated, related expenses must also be allocated.Â  Finally, we find section\r\n  12-6-2220 does not discriminate against interstate commerce and thus does not\r\n  violate the Commerce Clause.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  AFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Emerson does not identify the precise\r\n  source of the dividend income or the origin of the related expenses.Â Â Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; Allocation formulas vary by state.Â  In\r\n  South Carolina, certain types of non-business income, such as interest income,\r\n  are allocated on the basis of the corporation's\r\n  principal place of business; however, other types of non-business income, such\r\n  as gains or losses from the sale of real property, are allocated on the basis\r\n  of situs.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-6-2220.\r\n[3]&nbsp; This subsection was amended effective June\r\n  7, 2005, to state, &quot;Dividends received from corporate stocks not\r\n    connected with the taxpayer's business, less all related expenses, are allocated to the state of\r\n  the corporation's principal place of business.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-6-2220(2) (Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).\r\n[4]&nbsp; Having carefully reviewed Avco, we adhere\r\n  to its construction of legislative intent concerning the predecessor to section\r\n  12-6-2220(2).Â  Application of the plain meaning of section 12-6-2220(2)\r\n  requires that Emerson's claimed expenses be allocated to the state of its\r\n  principal place of business. \r\n[5]&nbsp; We further note\r\n  that, in light of the constitutional prohibition against a state taxing income\r\n  that lacks a sufficient nexus with the state, taxation of certain non-business\r\n  income may, in some instances, be unconstitutional.Â  See Container\r\n    Corp., 463 U.S. at 165-66 (&quot;The Due Process and Commerce Clauses of\r\n  the Constitution do not allow a State to tax income arising out of interstate\r\n  activitiesâ€”even on a proportional basisâ€”unless there is a 'minimal connection'\r\n  or 'nexus' between the interstate activities and the taxing State, and 'a\r\n  rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the\r\n  intrastate values of the enterprise.'&quot;).Â  This observation is made in light\r\n  of Emerson's failure to identify the precise source of the dividend\r\n  income or the origin of the related expenses.Â  We are left to speculate whether\r\n  these dividends or related expenses have any nexus to South Carolina.Â Â  Â \r\n[6]&nbsp; Emerson also\r\n  argues section 12-6-2220 violates the Equal Protection Clauses of the\r\n  Fourteenth Amendment and the South Carolina Constitution and the Privileges and\r\n  Immunities Clause of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  However, those claims\r\n  are not properly preserved for review by this Court, and we do not address\r\n  them.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1), SCACR (&quot;The brief of appellant shall\r\n  contain . . . the particular issue to be addressed . . . followed by discussion\r\n  and citations of authority.&quot;); Travelscape, LLC v.

Co. v. Bair, 437 U.S. 267, 278-79\r\n  (1978) (acknowledging that variation in state income tax consequences for\r\n  multi-state corporations does not inhere in a particular state's formula but\r\n  instead is a product of the combination of different formulas).Â  The\r\n  constitutionality of a South Carolina statute does not hinge upon whether\r\n  another state allows or disallows a tax deduction. \r\n[8]&nbsp; Emerson claimed these same expense\r\n  deductions in other states.Â  Some states, like South Carolina, denied the\r\n  deductions altogether, some allowed Emerson to deduct only a portion of the\r\n  expenses, and other states permitted 100% of the expense deductions.\r\n[9]&nbsp; Emerson concedes\r\n  that, in the presence of taxable dividend income, application of section\r\n  12-6-2220 does not discriminate against interstate commerce.\r\n[10]&nbsp; We acknowledge that Shaffer and Lunding involved challenges under the Privileges and Immunities Clause; however, in the\r\n  context of a discrimination claim, the United States Supreme Court has spoken\r\n  of the &quot;mutually reinforcing relationship between the Privileges and\r\n  Immunities Clause of Art.

Fortino, Moore, Taylor\r\n  and Thomas, both of West Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE KITTREDGE: Â Â Â  We granted a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision affirming the trial court\r\n  judgment against Petitioner All Things Possible, Inc., for fraud in connection\r\n  with a real estate transaction case, where the truth was discoverable in the\r\n  public records.Â  Moseley v. All Things Possible, Inc., 388 S.C. 31, 694\r\n  S.E.2d 43 (Ct. App. 2010). Â We affirm. \r\nI.\r\n Petitioner All Things Possible, Inc., (ATP) sold an\r\n  undeveloped lot in the Secret Cove subdivision, located in Lexington County, to\r\n  Respondents Michael and Marsha Moseley.Â  The lot is burdened by an underground,\r\n  surface-water drainage easement[1] running diagonally across the entire length of the property, essentially\r\n  cutting the lot in half.Â  ATP, through its agents, was aware of the Moseleys'\r\n  desire to build a home on the lot.Â  Real estate agent Loretta Whitehead presented\r\n  to the Moseleys a copy of the plat, supplied by ATP, showing the lot in\r\n  question.[2]Â \r\n  The plat had been altered by removing the lines reflecting the existence and\r\n  location of the drainage easement.Â  Additionally, a square was drawn on the\r\n  plat, indicating where a home could be constructed.Â  \r\nAccording to the Moseleys, they\r\n  &quot;absolutely&quot; relied upon the falsified plat in purchasing the lot,\r\n  together with assurances from ATP related to the Moseleys' ability to build on\r\n  the lot.[3]Â \r\n  As noted by the court of appeals, the Moseleys were induced to purchase the lot\r\n  without obtaining an independent survey of the property. Â Conversely, the real\r\n  estate contract contained standard provisions, including the right of the\r\n  Moseleys to conduct a title examination and procure a survey of the lot.Â  \r\nThe easement is not recorded in any deed\r\n  within the chain of title; however, it is included on the recorded plat of the\r\n  subdivision.Â  The Moseleys retained an attorney, who in turn employed a title\r\n  abstractor.Â  The existence of the easement was not discovered in the title\r\n  search. \r\nAt the closing James H. Hampton gave the\r\n  Moseleys his ATP business card, which contained a Bible verse, Proverbs 11:25: &quot;The generous man will be prosperous and he who waters others will\r\n  himself be watered.&quot;Â  The Moseleys stated they trusted Hampton because he\r\n  &quot;presented himself as a minister who dabbled in building.&quot;Â  \r\nAfter purchasing the lot, the Moseleys\r\n  learned of the easement and the resulting inability to build a home suited to\r\n  their needs. Â The Moseleys sued ATP and Hampton alleging multiple causes of\r\n  action, including fraud.Â  The matter was tried nonjury solely on the fraud\r\n  claim.Â  The trial court found that fraud had been established by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence and awarded actual and punitive damages against Hampton and\r\n  ATP. Â The court of appeals reversed the judgment against Hampton.Â  The judgment\r\n  against ATP was affirmed.Â  ATP sought a writ of certiorari, which we granted.[4]Â  Â \r\nII.\r\n An\r\n  action for fraud is an action at law.Â  In an action at law, on appeal of a case\r\n  tried without a jury, the findings of fact will not be disturbed if there is\r\n  any evidence which reasonably supports the judge's findings. Â The judge's\r\n  findings in such an instance are equivalent to a jury's findings in a law\r\n  action. Townes Assoc., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221\r\n  S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  Our scope of review extends merely to the correction\r\n  of errors of law.Â  Temple v. Tec-Fab, Inc., 381 S.C. 597, 599-600, 675\r\n  S.E.2d 414,&nbsp;415&nbsp;(2009).\r\nIII.\r\nA.\r\n ATP first argues there is no clear and convincing evidence\r\n  that it engaged in fraud.Â  Under the &quot;any evidence&quot; standard of\r\n  review, the record contains evidence supporting the finding of fraud against\r\n  ATP.Â  That evidence consists of ATP supplying the Moseleys with the falsified\r\n  plat and related assurances that a home suited to their needs could be built on\r\n  the lot.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following\r\n  authorities: Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc., 343 S.C.\r\n  587, 594, 541 S.E.2d 257, 261 (2001) (&quot;An appellate court's scope of\r\n  review in cases of fraud, where the proof must be by clear, cogent and\r\n  convincing evidence, is limited to determining whether there is any evidence reasonably\r\n  supporting the circuit court's findings.&quot;); Harold Tyner Dev. Builders,\r\n    Inc. v. Firstmark Dev. Corp., 311 S.C. 447, 429 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\n  (affirming a judgment pursuant to a claim of fraud because the evidence, when\r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, was sufficient for a jury\r\n  to reasonably infer the alleged actions amounted to fraud); Gasque v.\r\n    Voyager Life Ins. Co. of S.C., 288 S.C. 629, 344 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n  (affirming the judgment pursuant to a fraud claim because the issue of whether the\r\n  insured made false representations to obtain insurance was a question of fact\r\n  for the jury).\r\n B.\r\n ATP\r\n  further argues that because the misrepresentation was discoverable in the\r\n  public record, the fraud claim must fail as a matter of law.Â  The specific\r\n  element challenged is the &quot;hearer's right to rely&quot; on the\r\n  misrepresentation.[5] Â ATP contends that because the existence of the easement was discoverable in\r\n  the public record, the Moseleys' reliance on the misrepresentation was not\r\n  reasonable as a matter of law.Â  We disagree and hold that a question of fact\r\n  existed as to whether the Moseleys' reliance was justified.\r\n ATP\r\n  is correct in that, generally, &quot;one cannot rely upon misstatement of\r\n  facts, if the truth is easily within its reach.&quot;Â  O'Shields v. S.\r\n    Fountain Mobile Homes, Inc., 262 S.C. 276, 282, 204 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1974) (internal\r\n  quotations omitted).Â  ATP points to LoPresti v. Burry to support its\r\n  contention that fraud cannot be actionable where the truth is discoverable in\r\n  the public records.Â  364 S.C. 271, 612 S.E.2d 730 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In LoPresti,\r\n  the purchasers of a home on a lake argued that removal of a dotted line\r\n  depicting a floodplain from the recorded subdivision plat amounted to a\r\n  misrepresentation by the seller.Â  The court of appeals concluded the purchasers\r\n  were on constructive notice of the floodplain because it was available in the\r\n  public records.Â  However, LoPresti does not stand for the bright-line\r\n  rule ATP seeks to advance.Â  The LoPresti court acknowledged there are\r\n  instances in which a purchaser's reliance will be reasonable, notwithstanding\r\n  constructive notice.Â  The court noted that constructive\r\n  notice is &quot;inapplicable especially 'where the very representations relied\r\n  on induced the hearer to refrain [from] an examination of the records.'&quot; See id. at 277 n.12, 612 S.E.2d at 733 (citing Reid v. Harbison Dev. Corp., 285 S.C. 557, 561, 330 S.E.2d 532, 534-35 (Ct. App.\r\n  1985)).\r\n The\r\n  case of Slack v. James is instructive. Â 364 S.C. 609, 614 S.E.2d 636\r\n  (2005), aff'g, 356 S.C. 479, 589 S.E.2d 772 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In a real\r\n  estate transaction, the seller informed the buyers that there were no easements\r\n  on the property.Â  After the parties entered into a written contract, the buyers\r\n  learned there was a permanent sewer easement across the property.Â  When the buyers\r\n  refused to proceed with the purchase, the seller sued the buyers for breach of\r\n  contract.Â  The buyers counterclaimed for, among other claims, fraud. Â The trial court dismissed the fraud counterclaim on\r\n  the basis that the buyers &quot;failed to exercise reasonable diligence to\r\n  protect their interests and had no right to rely on the real estate agent's\r\n  alleged misrepresentation as to the existence of the sewer line easement.&quot;\r\n  Â Id. at 612-13, 614 S.E.2d at 638.Â  The court of appeals reversed.Â  On\r\n  certiorari we concurred.Â  The court of appeals &quot;found that, while Buyers\r\n  could have ascertained the existence of the easement through investigation of\r\n  public records, their failure to do so does not preclude them from asserting a\r\n  tort claim for fraud or negligent misrepresentation.Â  The court held the\r\n  question of whether Buyers could reasonably rely on the statement at issue in\r\n  view of the information entered upon the public record is for a jury, not the\r\n  court, to determine.&quot; Â Id. at 613, 614 S.E.2d at 638.Â  We held that\r\n  the court of appeals &quot;properly found a question of fact exists as to\r\n  whether Buyers' reliance on the misrepresentation was reasonable although the\r\n  falsity of the alleged misrepresentation could have been ascertained by\r\n  examining the public records.&quot;Â  Id. at 615, 614 S.E.2d at 639 (internal\r\n  citations omitted).\r\nOur jurisprudence reflects a preference for a case by\r\n  case approach to the question of whether a hearer's reliance on\r\n  misrepresentations as to matters in the public record is reasonable.Â  That is\r\n  so because &quot;[f]raud . . . assumes so\r\n  many hues and forms, that courts are compelled to content themselves with\r\n  comparatively few general rules for its discovery and defeat, and all the facts\r\n  and circumstances peculiar to each case to bear heavily upon the conscience and\r\n  judgment of the court or jury in determining its presence or absence.&quot;Â  Conner\r\n    v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 466, 560 S.E.2d 606, 612 (2002)\r\n  (quoting Sullivan v. Calhoun, 117 S.C. 137, 139, 108 S.E. 189, 189\r\n  (1921)).\r\nWhile there may be cases in which a hearer's reliance\r\n  on a misrepresentation that is a matter of public record is unreasonable as a\r\n  matter of law, this is not one of those cases.Â  This case presented a question\r\n  of fact.Â  We find ATP's fraudulent misrepresentations, when viewed in a light most\r\n  favorable to the Moseleys, &quot;'induced\r\n  the [Moseleys] to refrain [from] an examination of the records.'&quot; Â LoPresti,\r\n  364 S.C. at 277 n.12, 612 S.E.2d at 733 (citing Reid\r\n    v. Harbison Dev. Corp., 285 S.C. at\r\n  561, 330 S.E.2d at 534).Â  Whether the Moseleys' reliance on ATP's fraud was\r\n  reasonable, given the easement was in the public record, was a question for the\r\n  fact-finder.\r\nMoreover, from a policy standpoint, we acknowledge the\r\n  benefits flowing from the constructive notice doctrine in which one is charged with\r\n  knowledge of matters in the public record.Â  Yet that general rule must at times\r\n  yield when confronted with fraudulent misrepresentations.Â  The purpose of the\r\n  recording act is, after all, to protect innocent purchasers, not fraudulent\r\n  sellers.Â  See Slack v. James, 356 S.C. at 483, 589 S.E.2d at 774 Â (&quot;The\r\n  purpose of the recording act is to protect one who buys a recorded title\r\n  against one who acquires a paper title but fails to record it.Â  The recording\r\n  act is not intended to protect a seller who makes a false or misleading\r\n  statement.&quot;).\r\nC.\r\n ATP\r\n  also assigns error to the court of appeals for upholding the judgment against\r\n  it after exonerating Hampton.Â  According to ATP, the court of appeals\r\n  improperly pointed to the real estate agent as ATP's agent.Â  We disagree and\r\n  affirm.Â  The record supports the finding that the real estate agent was acting\r\n  as ATP's agent.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (&quot;The appellate court may\r\n  affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in\r\n  the Record on Appeal.&quot;); see also Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys.\r\n    &amp; Servs., Inc., 343 S.C. 587, 594, 541 S.E.2d 257, 261 (2001) (&quot;An\r\n  appellate court's scope of review in cases of fraud, where the proof must be by\r\n  clear, cogent and convincing evidence, is limited to determining whether there\r\n  is any evidence reasonably supporting the circuit court's findings.&quot;). Â \r\n IV.\r\n  Â Â Â Â \r\n We\r\n  affirm the court of appeals.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The parties have stipulated as to the existence of the easement. \r\n[2]&nbsp; While there is evidence that ATP supplied the falsified plat with the\r\n  intent that it be relied on, there is no evidence that Whitehead was personally\r\n  responsible for its creation. \r\n[3]&nbsp; The Moseleys are school administrators.Â  Mr. Moseley's health situation\r\n  required a home that, because of the easement, the lot could not accommodate.Â \r\n  The lot, however, was &quot;buildable.&quot;Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; In its opinion, the court of appeals found the facts did not warrant\r\n  relief against Hampton.Â  That finding is the law of the case, for the Moseleys\r\n  did not seek certiorari on that issue. \r\n[5]&nbsp; In an action for fraud, a plaintiff must prove by clear\r\n  and convincing evidence the following elements:\r\n\r\n(1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3)\r\n  its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or a reckless disregard of\r\n  its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation be acted upon; (6) the\r\n  hearer's ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearer's reliance on its truth; (8)\r\n  the hearer's right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearer's consequent and\r\n  proximate injury.\r\n\r\nTurner v.

Code Â§ 6-29-820, challenging the\r\n  constitutionality of the Ordinance under federal and state law, which was\r\n  narrowed to a challenge under our state constitution.Â  Following a hearing, the\r\n  circuit court found the Ordinance's definition of family did not violate the\r\n  Due Process Clause of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  circuit court found Appellants failed to meet their burden of proving the\r\n  limitations set forth in the Ordinance were not reasonably related to any\r\n  legitimate governmental interest.Â  The circuit court further found the City had\r\n  not acted arbitrarily or wrongfully in passing the Ordinance and, therefore,\r\n  had not infringed upon Appellants' substantive due process rights under the\r\n  state constitution.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBecause Appellants challenge the\r\n  constitutionality of the Ordinance, the matter was directly appealed to this\r\n  Court.Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 14-8-200(b)(3) (Supp. 2010) (providing the right\r\n  of appeal from a final judgment involving a challenge on state or federal\r\n  grounds to the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance lies directly to the\r\n  Supreme Court).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  II.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAn issue regarding interpretation of a\r\n  legislative enactment is a question of law.Â  City of Rock Hill v. Harris,\r\n  391 S.C. 149, 152, 705 S.E.2d 53, 54 (2011).Â  In a\r\n  case raising a novel question of law, the Court is free to decide the question\r\n  with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  Id.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  III.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellants argue that the Ordinance's\r\n  definition of &quot;family,&quot; which limits to three the number of unrelated\r\n  persons who may reside together as a single housekeeping unit, arbitrarily and\r\n  capriciously deprives them of a cognizable property interest in violation of the\r\n  Due Process Clause of the South Carolina Constitution.[3]Â  We disagree.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n&quot;A municipal ordinance is a\r\n  legislative enactment and is presumed to be constitutional.&quot;Â  Town of Scranton v. Willoughby, 306 S.C. 421, 422, 412 S.E.2d 424, 425 (1992).Â  &quot;[E]very presumption will be made in favor of the\r\n  constitutionality of a legislative enactment; and a statute will be declared\r\n  unconstitutional only when its invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no\r\n  room for reasonable doubt that it violates some provision of the\r\n  Constitution.&quot;Â  Harris, 391 S.C. at 154, 705 S.E.2d at 55.Â \r\n  &quot;[T]he power to declare an ordinance invalid because it is so unreasonable\r\n  as to impair or destroy constitutional rights is one which will be exercised\r\n  carefully and cautiously, as it is not the function of the Court to pass upon\r\n  the wisdom or expediency of municipal ordinances or regulations.&quot;Â  Rush\r\n  v. City of Greenville, 246 S.C. 268, 276, 143 S.E.2d 527, 531 (1965).Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n&quot;The authority of a municipality to\r\n  enact zoning ordinances, restricting the use of privately owned property is\r\n  founded in the police power.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In reviewing substantive due\r\n  process challenges to municipal ordinances, a court must consider whether the\r\n  ordinance bears a reasonable relationship to any legitimate interest of\r\n  government.Â  Denene, Inc. v. City of\r\n  Charleston, 359 S.C. 85, 96, 596\r\n  S.E.2d 917, 923 (2004).Â  The validity of a particular\r\n  zoning ordinance must be considered not in the abstract, but in connection with\r\n  the locality and surrounding circumstances.Â  See Village of\r\n  Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 387-88 (1926) (noting the line dividing valid and invalid zoning\r\n  ordinances is not capable of precise delimitation but rather varies with the\r\n  surrounding circumstances and stating that &quot;[a] regulatory zoning\r\n  ordinance, which would clearly be valid as applied to the great cities, might\r\n  be clearly invalid as applied to rural communities&quot;).Â Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n&quot;In order to prove a denial of\r\n  substantive due process, a party must show that he was arbitrarily and\r\n  capriciously deprived of a cognizable property interest rooted in state\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Denene 359 S.C. at 96, 596 S.E.2d at 923.Â  &quot;The burden\r\n  of proving the invalidity of a zoning ordinance is on the party attacking it,\r\n  and it is incumbent upon [the challenger] to show the arbitrary and capricious\r\n  character of the ordinance through clear and convincing evidence.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;A legislative body does not deny due process simply because it does not\r\n  permit a landowner to make the most beneficial use of its property.&quot;Â  Harbit v. City of Charleston, 382 S.C. 383, 394, 675 S.E.2d 776, 782 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009).Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Village\r\n  of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1\r\n  (1974), the United States Supreme Court considered\r\n  the constitutionality of a similar zoning ordinance which prevented more than\r\n  two unrelated persons from living together in the same household.Â  Belle Terre\r\n  charged the property owner with violating the zoning ordinance after he rented\r\n  the home to six unrelated students from a local university.Â  The Supreme Court\r\n  found zoning ordinances which limit the number of unrelated people who\r\n  may live together in one household do not implicate a fundamental right of\r\n  association or privacy and are a valid exercise of a state's police power.[4]Â  Id. at 7-9.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlthough Belle Terre established\r\n  that the federal constitution does not afford substantive due process\r\n  protection in this instance, state courts are free to conclude that their\r\n  respective state constitutions do provide such protection.Â  Appellants argue\r\n  the City's definition of &quot;family&quot; is arbitrary and capricious and\r\n  bears no rational relationship to any legitimate state interest of government\r\n  in violation of the South Carolina constitution.[5]Â \r\n  Appellants also argue the Ordinance excludes many groups of individuals which\r\n  should be permitted to reside together as a single housekeeping unit.[6]\r\n  \r\n  \r\nHowever, as many other states have found,[7] we find the rationale of Belle\r\n  Terre persuasive and find there is a rational relationship between the\r\n  Ordinance's definition of &quot;family&quot; and the legitimate governmental\r\n  interests the Ordinance seeks to further. Â See Belle Terre 416\r\n  U.S. at 8 (&quot;[E]very line drawn by a legislature leaves some out that might\r\n  well have been included.Â  That exercise of discretion, however, is a\r\n  legislative, not a judicial, function.&quot;).Â  Where the rational relationship\r\n  standard is utilized, the law must\r\nbe upheld if it furthers any legitimate governmental\r\n  purpose.Â  Further, we must consider the Ordinance in the context of the\r\n  surrounding area, including the fact that the City is home to several colleges\r\n  and universities.[8]Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWith that in mind, we find the Ordinance\r\n  is a valid exercise of the City's broad police power and that there is a\r\n  rational relationship between the City's decision to limit to three the number\r\n  of unrelated individuals who may live together as a single housekeeping unit\r\n  and the legitimate governmental interests of controlling the undesirable\r\n  qualities associated with &quot;mass student congestion.&quot;Â  Cf. Harbit, 382\r\n  S.C. at 395, 675 S.E.2d at 782 (finding that because\r\n  the City of Charleston's zoning decision was reasonably founded and rationally\r\n  related to its stated interests of preserving the area's residential character,\r\n  the city's action in denying a rezoning application did not rise to the level\r\n  of being arbitrary or capricious and thus did not violate the property owner's\r\n  substantive due process rights).Â  Because we find the Ordinance is rationally\r\n  related to a legitimate governmental purpose, we find it does not violate the\r\n  Due Process Clause of the South Carolina Constitution.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE\r\n  and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Although the freedom to\r\n  select one's cohabitants could, under some circumstances, implicate the freedom\r\n  of association guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States\r\n  Constitution, we emphasize that we address only the limited argument before\r\n  usâ€”namely the rights of a landlord vis-Ã -vis a due process challenge under the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Districts designated as RD &quot;are\r\n  intended as one- and two-family residential areas with attached and detached\r\n  units with medium to high population densities.&quot;Â  Columbia City Code Â§\r\n  17-234.Â  The DP designation, when appended to a basic district classification,\r\n  is intended to further the purpose and intent of the Ordinance, including\r\n  protecting and improving the quality of the environment of the City by\r\n  encouraging &quot;the identification, recognition, conservation maintenance and\r\n  enhancement of areas, sites, structures, fixtures and other features of the\r\n  architectural, economic, social, cultural and political history of the City as\r\n  well as its natural features; to encourage appropriate use of such features,\r\n  areas, and sites, structures and fixtures; and to restrain influences adverse\r\n  to such purposes, and by so doing to promote the public welfare.&quot;Â \r\n  Columbia City Code Â§ 17-251.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Appellants also\r\n  raise equal protection and privacy challenges to the Ordinance.Â  However, the\r\n  circuit court's ruling did not specifically address those grounds, and\r\n  Appellants failed to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  Accordingly, those\r\n  issues are not preserved for review, and we do not address them.Â  See Shealy\r\n    v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000) (finding a trial\r\n  judge's general ruling was insufficient to preserve a specific issue for\r\n  appellate review and where a trial judge does not explicitly rule on an\r\n  argument raised and no Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion was filed, an appellate court\r\n  may not address the issue).Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; Three years later, the United States\r\n  Supreme Court found a zoning ordinance which restricted the categories of related individuals who could live together as a single housekeeping unit infringed\r\n  upon the fundamental rights regarding &quot;personal choice in marriage and\r\n  family life.&quot;Â  See Moore v. City of E. Cleveland, 431 U.S.\r\n  494, 496-500 (1977) (specifically distinguishing Belle Terre as not\r\n  involving the fundamental freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and\r\n  family life). \r\n[5]&nbsp; As Appellants\r\n  note, four states have found similar zoning provisions limiting occupancy of\r\n  unrelated individuals to be unconstitutional.Â  Those states have done so,\r\n  generally, because the ordinances preclude functional families from living\r\n  together.Â  Only California has determined that unrelated individuals possess a\r\n  fundamental right to choose cohabitants.Â  See City of\r\n    Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 610 P.2d 436 (Cal. 1980) (finding the right to choose one's unrelated cohabitants is encompassed within\r\n  the fundamental right to privacy protected by the California Constitution and\r\n  applying strict scrutiny in striking down the zoning ordinance).Â  The remaining\r\n  three states did not find the challenged zoning ordinances implicated a\r\n  fundamental right; rather, those states found the zoning ordinances did not\r\n  withstand rational basis review.Â  See Delta Charter Twp. v.\r\n    Dinolfo, 419 Mich. 253 (1984) (finding an\r\n  ordinance limiting occupation of single-family residences to any number of\r\n  related individuals and not more than one other unrelated person violated state\r\n  constitution's due process clause because it was not rationally related to\r\n  governmental objectives); State v. Baker, 81 N.J. 99 (1979) (construing state constitution and existing case law to\r\n  require zoning restrictions to be accomplished &quot;in the manner which least\r\n  impacts upon the right of individuals to order their lives as they see fit&quot;); McMinn v. Oyster Bay, 482 N.Y.S.2d 773 (1984) (noting the unique language of the Due Process Clause of\r\n  the New York Constitution and the suburban evolution away from\r\n  &quot;child-centered family units&quot; andÂ  finding a zoning ordinance\r\n  restricting households to related persons was arbitrary and unreasonable and\r\n  failed the rational relationship test).\r\n[6]&nbsp; Appellants argue the Ordinance impermissibly excludes various household units comprised\r\n  of unrelated people, including: two unrelated elderly people with two unrelated\r\n  caretakers or a residence shared by four unrelated foreign exchange students,\r\n  young professionals, nuns, judges or legislators.Â  However, because Appellants\r\n  are not included in any of these particular non-traditional family scenarios, they\r\n  are not before us and we do not address them.Â  See Broadrick v.\r\n    Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610 (1973) (&quot;Embedded in the traditional rules\r\n  governing constitutional adjudication is the principle that a person to whom a\r\n  statute may constitutionally be applied will not be heard to challenge that\r\n  statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to\r\n  others, in other situations not before the Court.&quot;); In the Interest of\r\n    Amir X.S., 371 S.C. 380, 385, 639 S.E.2d 144, 146 n.2 (2006) (&quot;The\r\n  traditional rule of standing for facial attacks provides that one to whom\r\n  application of a statute is constitutional may not attack the statute on\r\n  grounds that it might be unconstitutional when applied to other people or\r\n  situations.&quot;).\r\n[7]&nbsp; The overwhelming\r\n  majority of states that have considered the issue have found similar ordinances\r\n  restricting the number of unrelated persons that may live together to be\r\n  constitutional.Â  E.g., Dinan v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 220\r\n  Conn. 61 (1991) (restricting the definition of family\r\n  serves to provide an element of cohesion not to be found in occupancy of\r\n  property by individuals with separate rental agreements and no common bond of\r\n  significant duration); Ames Rental Prop. Ass'n v. City of Ames,\r\n  736 N.W.2d 255 (Iowa 2007) (noting that many of the\r\n  cases addressing similar ordinances involve college towns); State v.\r\n    Champoux, 252 Neb. 769 (1997) (noting the fact\r\n  that the City of Lincoln could have chosen to effectuate its objectives in a\r\n  variety of other ways does not demonstrate any constitutional defect in the\r\n  zoning ordinance restricting the definition of &quot;family&quot;); City\r\n    of Brookings v. Winker, 554 N.W.2d 827 (S.D. 1996) (noting the unavoidable population density problems in college towns and\r\n  finding party challenging statute failed to establish facts sufficient to\r\n  overcome the ordinance's presumption of validity).\r\n[8]&nbsp; In finding the Iowa Constitution was not\r\n  violated by a zoning ordinance of the town of Ames, home of Iowa State\r\n  University, which restricted the number of unrelated persons who may live\r\n  together to three, the Supreme Court of Iowa noted that &quot;it cannot be\r\n  ignored that Ames is a university campus city and therefore, experiences\r\n  typical secondary effects of mass student congestion.&quot;Â  See Ames\r\n    Rental Prop. Ass'n,\r\n  736 N.W.2d at 261 (&quot;Based on its experience with students living\r\n  off campus, the Ames city council made a reasonable policy decision to limit to\r\n  three the number of unrelated persons who may reside in a single-family\r\n  dwelling in certain areas.Â  It did so because groups of unrelated persons\r\n  typically have different living styles in comparison to groups of related\r\n  persons. . . .Â  By limiting the number of unrelated\r\n  persons who may live together, Ames's ordinance furthers the City's goal of creating\r\n  family-oriented neighborhoods that are safe and quiet for young children.&quot;).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27076","title":"Lozada v.

McIntosh, Senior Assistant Attorney General David\r\n  Spencer, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN: Jose\r\n  Lozada appeals the circuit court's order denying his petition for declaratory\r\n  judgment seeking to be removed from the Sex Offender Registry.Â  Lozada argues\r\n  that the crime to which he pled guilty in Pennsylvaniaâ€”unlawful restraintâ€”is\r\n  not a &quot;similar offense&quot; to the crime of kidnapping in South Carolina.Â \r\n  He accordingly contends that he should not be required to register as a sex\r\n  offender for unlawful restraint pursuant to Section 23-3-430(A) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2010).Â  We disagree and affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n In 1998, Lozada pled guilty in Pennsylvania to charges\r\n  of indecent assault and unlawful restraint.Â  He was sentenced to seven years'\r\n  probation.Â  Â Â Â Â Neither of these offenses required Lozada to register as a sex\r\n  offender in Pennsylvania.Â  In 2002, he requested a transfer of his probation to\r\n  South Carolina, after which the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department and the\r\n  Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services (DPPPS) informed him that\r\n  he would have to register on the Sex Offender Registry for his conviction of\r\n  indecent assault.Â  Lozada complied and has been on the registry since 2002.Â  \r\n In September of 2007, Lozada brought a declaratory\r\n  judgment action seeking to be removed from the registry, arguing that he\r\n  erroneously had been required to register because a DPPPS agent had mistakenly\r\n  interpreted indecent assault to be equivalent to rape.Â  At the hearing, the\r\n  South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) conceded that requiring Lozada\r\n  to register for the crime of indecent assault was improper because there was no\r\n  similar crime in South Carolina that required registering.Â  However, SLED argued\r\n  that Lozada's other conviction for unlawful restraint was similar to the crime\r\n  of kidnapping in South Carolina and Lozada should be required to remain on the\r\n  registry on that basis.Â  The circuit court agreed, denying Lozada's petition\r\n  for declaratory judgment and requiring him to remain on the registry for his\r\n  conviction of unlawful restraint.[1]Â \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;A declaratory judgment\r\n  action is neither legal nor equitable, and therefore, the standard\r\n  of review is determined by the nature of the underlying\r\n  issue.&quot;Â  Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Newman, 385 S.C. 187, 191, 684\r\n  S.E.2d 541, 543 (2009) (citing Colleton County Taxpayers Ass'n v. Sch. Dist.\r\n    of Colleton County, 371 S.C. 224, 231, 638 S.E.2d 685, 688 (2006)).Â \r\n  Whether an individual must be placed on the sex offender registry is a question\r\n  of law.Â  See generally Noisette v.

App. 1989) (&quot;Unless the cause of action and the relief\r\n  sought in a declaratory judgment action are distinctly equitable, the action\r\n  will be considered one at law.&quot;).Â Â  When reviewing an action at law, our\r\n  scope of review is limited to the correction of errors of law.Â  S.C.

Horry Cnty., 391 S.C. 76, 81, 705 S.E.2d 21, 24 (2011).Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLozada argues that\r\n  he should not be required to register on the South Carolina Sex Offender\r\n  Registry because unlawful restraint in Pennsylvania is not a &quot;similar\r\n  offense&quot; to kidnapping in South Carolina.Â  We disagree.\r\n Under\r\n  section 23-3-430(A), a person residing in South Carolina who pleads guilty in a\r\n  comparable court in the United States to a crime similar to any offense which\r\n  requires registration under section 23-3-430(C) must register on the South\r\n  Carolina Sex Offender Registry.Â  One of\r\n  the offenses requiring registration is kidnapping.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  23-3-430(C)(15).Â  In determining whether\r\n  a crime is an &quot;equivalent offense,&quot; we look at the conduct involved,\r\n  the elements of the offense, and the public policy behind the enactment of the\r\n  statutes.Â  In re Shaquille O'Neal B., 385 S.C 243, 253, 684 S.E.2d 549,\r\n  555 (2009).\r\n Under\r\n  Pennsylvania law, a person is guilty of unlawful restraint &quot;if he\r\n  knowingly: (1) restrains another unlawfully in circumstances exposing him to\r\n  risk of serious bodily injury, or (2) holds another in a condition of\r\n  involuntary servitude.&quot;Â  18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 2902(a) (2011).Â  Unlawful\r\n  restraint is a criminal act falling between the offense of kidnapping and false\r\n  imprisonment[2] as it &quot;cover[s] restraints which do not reach the magnitude of kidnapping\r\n  but are somewhat more serious than false imprisonment.&quot;Â  Id.,\r\n  official cmt. (2000).Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nSouth Carolina does not have different levels of crimes\r\n  involving deprivation of freedom.Â  Instead, the crime of kidnapping in South\r\n  Carolina is broad in scope.Â  Under our statute, a person is guilty of\r\n  kidnapping if he should &quot;unlawfully seize, confine, inveigle, decoy,\r\n  kidnap, abduct or carry away any other person by any means whatsoever without\r\n  authority of law.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 (2010).Â  Furthermore, we\r\n  have interpreted this statute to encompass restraint regardless of duration or\r\n  whether the victim was moved.Â  See State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 13-14,\r\n  512 S.E.2d 99, 105 (1999) (noting that the offense of kidnapping\r\n  &quot;commences when one is wrongfully deprived of freedom and continues until\r\n  the freedom is restored&quot; and further finding that proof of kidnapping\r\n  existed where defendant had bound victim with duct tape in her home).\r\n Examining the elements of the two crimes, it is clear that\r\n  if the acts had occurred in South Carolina, Lozada would have been guilty of\r\n  kidnapping.Â  While unlawful restraint addresses the prohibited conduct with\r\n  more specific language, this does not change the fact that the same conduct\r\n  would constitute kidnapping in South Carolina.Â  Furthermore, even though\r\n  Pennsylvania lists three crimes to punish conduct which in South Carolina would\r\n  all fall under kidnapping, the policies behind enacting the statutes are the\r\n  same.Â  Both criminalize conduct intended to deny a victim his liberty in some\r\n  way.Â  Although the South Carolina kidnapping statute does so with a broader framework,\r\n  the desire to protect the public from and punish criminals for such acts drove\r\n  the enactment of both these statutes.\r\n This difference in scope also explains the disparity in\r\n  punishment between the two crimes. Unlawful restraint is classified as a first\r\n  degree misdemeanor, 18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 2902(b).Â  It is punishable by up to five\r\n  years imprisonment, 18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 106(b)(6).Â  Conversely, kidnapping in South\r\n  Carolina is classified as a felony and is punishable by up to thirty years\r\n  imprisonment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 (2003).Â  Although the maximum\r\n  punishment for kidnapping is six times the maximum for unlawful restraint, it does\r\n  not follow that the actual punishments would have been different had Lozada\r\n  been sentenced in South Carolina.Â  Lozada did not serve any time in prison and\r\n  was only sentenced to probation.Â  The same could potentially have occurred in a\r\n  South Carolina court.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 (2010)\r\n  (&quot;After conviction or plea for any offense, except a crime punishable by\r\n  death or life imprisonment, the judge . . . may suspend the imposition or the\r\n  execution of a sentence and place the defendant on probation or may impose a\r\n  fine and also place the defendant on probation.&quot;).Â  Thus, the mere fact\r\n  that kidnapping allows for a greater punishment than unlawful restraint does\r\n  not prove that the offenses are not similar because kidnapping includes\r\n  significantly more culpable behavior.Â Â  \r\n Furthermore, the fact that a conviction for unlawful\r\n  restraint does not require registration as a sex offender in Pennsylvania does\r\n  not require us to find that the crimes are dissimilar.Â  In South Carolina, a\r\n  person guilty of kidnapping is required to register as a sex offender unless\r\n  the court &quot;makes a finding on the record that the offense did not include\r\n  a criminal sexual offense or an attempted criminal sexual offense.&quot;[3]Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430(15).Â  However, whether the defendant was required to\r\n  register in the state where the offense occurred does not control the analysis\r\n  of whether the offenses are similar, but is instead &quot;an alternative basis for registration.&quot;Â  In re O'Neil, 385 S.C. at 251, 684 S.E.2d\r\n  at 554.Â  \r\nThus,\r\n  based on the similarity in public policy\r\n  behind both statutes and the fact that all the conduct proscribed under\r\n  unlawful restraint is proscribed under the kidnapping statute, we find Lozada\r\n  was properly required to register as a sex offender in South Carolina.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's order\r\n  requiring Lozada's continued registration on the Sex Offender Registry for his\r\n  conviction of unlawful restraint.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Despite the court's order, at the time of oral\r\n  argument the registry still stated Lozada was registered for his indecent\r\n  assault conviction.Â  Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office, http://www.icrimewatch.net/offenderdetails.php?\r\n    OfndrID= 650409&amp;AgencyID=54288 (last\r\n  visited November 10, 2011). \r\n[2] In Pennsylvania, a person is guilty of kidnapping when\r\n  he &quot;unlawfully removes another a substantial distance under the circumstances\r\n  from the place where he is found, or if he unlawfully confines another for a\r\n  substantial period in a place of isolation.&quot;Â  18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 2901(a)\r\n  (2011).Â  A person is guilty of false imprisonment if he &quot;knowingly\r\n  restrains another unlawfully so as to interfere substantially with his\r\n  liberty.&quot; 18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 2903(a) (2011). \r\n[3] Lozada argues that because there is no finding that\r\n  the crime was sexual in nature, he should not be required to register even if\r\n  we conclude that kidnapping and unlawful restraint are similar offenses.Â  The\r\n  plain language of section 23-3-420(15) creates a presumption that the offender\r\n  would have to register unless the court made a separate finding the crime was\r\n  not sexual in nature.Â  Thus, the onus is on the defendant to demonstrate to the\r\n  court that the offense did not have sexual undertones.Â  Although there was no\r\n  cause to make such a finding in his original plea, Lozada could have presented\r\n  such evidence in his declaratory judgment petition.Â  See Hazel v. State,\r\n  377 S.C. 60, 65, 659 S.E.2d 137, 140 (2008). Â Moreover, when he pled\r\n  guilty to unlawful restraint, Lozada also pled guilty to indecent assault\r\n  arising out of the same incident.Â  Indecent assault occurs when a person &quot;has\r\n  indecent contact with the complainant, causes the complainant to have indecent\r\n  contact with the person or intentionally causes the complainant to come into\r\n  contact with seminal fluid, urine or feces for the purpose of arousing sexual\r\n  desire in the person or the complainant.&quot;Â  18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 3126(a)\r\n  (2011).Â  Thus, he cannot properly argue his conduct was not sexual in nature. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendments to Rule 416, South Carolina Appellate Court Rules","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2011-12-06-01","description":"Pursuant to Article V, Â§ 4, of the South Carolina Constitution, we hereby adopt the Bar's proposed amendments to Rule 416, SCACR, with some further amendments to Rules 10 and 20 of Rule 416, as set forth in the attachment to this Order.

JURISDICTION\r\nThe purpose of the Board is  to establish procedures whereby a dispute concerning fees, costs or  disbursements between a client and an attorney who is a member of the South  Carolina Bar (the Bar) may be resolved expeditiously, fairly and  professionally, thereby furthering the administration of justice, encouraging  the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct, assisting in  upholding the integrity and honor of the legal profession, and applying the  knowledge, experience and ability of the legal profession to the promotion of  the public good. As used in these Rules, &quot;fee&quot; is deemed to include a  legal fee, costs of litigation and disbursements associated with a legal cause,  claim or matter and &quot;client&quot; is defined as a person on whose behalf  professional legal services have been rendered by an attorney who is a member  of the South Carolina Bar. A dispute exists when the parties to an employment  agreement between lawyer and client have a genuine difference as to the fair  and proper amount of a fee. The amount in dispute, as used in these Rules, is  the dollar amount of that difference. A dispute does not exist solely because  of the failure of the client to pay a fee.\r\nUnder no circumstances will  the Board participate in: (1) a fee dispute involving an amount in dispute of  $50,000 or more; (2) disputes over fees which by law must be determined or  approved, as between lawyer and client, by a court, commission, judge, or other  tribunal. When an allegation of attorney misconduct arises out of a fee dispute  other than as to the reasonableness of the fee, the Board, in its discretion,  may refer the matter to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct. If the alleged  misconduct does not arise out of a fee dispute, it shall be referred to the  Commission on Lawyer Conduct.\r\nIf an attorney is suspended  from the practice of law after a fee dispute has been filed with the Board, the  Board shall retain jurisdiction over the dispute until the conclusion of the  fee dispute process. This shall include all applicable appeals under Rule 20.\r\nNo fee dispute may be filed  with the Board more than three (3) years after the dispute arose.\r\nJurisdictional issues shall  be determined by the circuit chair.\r\n\r\nRULE 10. COMMENCEMENT OF  PROCEEDINGS\r\nAll proceedings  hereunder shall be commenced by filing an application in the Office of the Bar,  on forms provided by the Bar. The application shall include a written statement  of the facts and circumstances surrounding the dispute, furnishing complete  names and addresses. If the client-applicant is not the person who paid for the  lawyer's services, the third party payer, with the written consent of the  client-applicant, may jointly file with the client-applicant, with both  signatures affixed to the application. If the materials submitted exceed  twenty-five (25) pages, the client-applicant shall submit three additional sets  of the materials. \r\nIf the responding  party is an attorney, the Bar shall forward the completed application, as  filed, to the attorney by electronic mail, with confirmation of delivery. If  the responding party is not an attorney, the Bar shall forward the completed  application, as filed, to the responding party by certified mail, return  receipt requested. A copy shall be sent by regular mail or email to the circuit  chair in the circuit where the principal place of practice of the attorney is  located. If the application involves attorneys in more than one circuit, a copy  of the completed application shall be sent to the chair of the Executive  Council, who shall designate which of these circuit chairs shall have  jurisdiction and shall proceed with the matter.\r\nIf the amount in dispute  exceeds $7,500, the circuit chair may appoint a hearing panel without  assignment of the matter to an assigned member.\r\nAfter the initial  correspondence, all other correspondence will be sent by regular mail or, with  the written consent of the client and lawyer, by email. Such written consent  may be withdrawn by written notice served on all other parties or attorneys. If  served by regular mail, correspondence will be deemed served upon deposit in  the U.S. Mail with proper postage affixed. If served by email, service is  complete upon transmission, unless the party making service learns that the  attempted service did not reach the person to be served. All parties have the  duty to inform the circuit chair of any change of address.\r\n\r\nRULE 11. INVESTIGATION BY  ASSIGNED MEMBER\r\nUpon receipt of the completed  application, the circuit chair shall promptly appoint the assigned member. The  assigned member shall conduct an investigation sufficient to enable the  rendering of an informed recommendation. The assigned member's recommendation  shall be written and contain the reasons for it. This report shall be submitted  to the circuit chair, with a copy to the Bar office, as soon as possible and  not later than ninety (90) days after appointment of the assigned member,  unless the time is extended by the circuit chair pursuant to Rule 12. The  circuit chair shall send a copy of the report to each of the parties and  notification of the circuit chair's concurrence or nonconcurrence with the  recommendations of the assigned member. \r\nThe attorney shall respond to  the issues raised in the application within thirty (30) days of being contacted  by the assigned member. The assigned member may extend the period for response  once and by no more than 30 days.\r\nThe parties to the dispute  and any witnesses on their behalves shall make themselves available for  interview at a time and place designated by the assigned member within the time  required for the assigned member to make a report. If a party or a witness  cannot, for any reason, be present at the designated time and place, that  witness or party shall submit a written response to the assigned member within  fourteen (14) days of the date the assigned member designated as the interview  date, unless the assigned member grants the party or witness an extension. The  party or witness may also submit a statement in writing, provided such  statement is delivered to the assigned member on or before the date designated  for the interview of that party or witness. The response to questions along  with the written statement, if any, together shall constitute the complete  statement of the party or witness concerning the dispute. In the event a party  fails to respond, then the assigned member must render a decision based upon  the available materials.\r\nThe assigned member may  encourage resolution of the dispute by compromise where the circumstances  warrant such effort. Efforts at compromise may include mediation of the dispute  by the assigned member. Compromise or consent agreements, whether written or  oral, become the final decision of the Board fifteen (15) days after the date  of a letter from the circuit chair to the parties confirming the agreement.\r\nIf the amount in dispute does  not exceed $1,000, in lieu of appointment of an assigned member, the circuit  chair may assign the dispute to the staff of the Bar for an expedited  investigation and recommendation. The staff in its discretion may make findings  based on written submissions by the parties or on such other information as may  be necessary to render an informed recommendation. In the event of such  assignment, the staff shall have the same powers and be governed by the same  duties and procedures as would an assigned member.\r\n\r\nRULE 12. SCHEDULE OF  PROCEEDINGS\r\n(a) All  fee disputes should be resolved within six (6) months. The assigned member's  report should be completed within thirty (30) to ninety (90) days after being  forwarded by the circuit chair. A fee dispute may not exceed six (6) months  without the written consent of the circuit chair for good cause shown. Any  extension of time granted by the circuit chair must be for a specified period  of time which shall be the least amount of time deemed necessary to resolve the  dispute.\r\n(b) If an assigned member does not respond to  reminders from the Bar office, the Bar office will notify the circuit  chair.&nbsp; \r\n(c) If  a fee dispute has been assigned and is pending, without an extension approved  by the circuit chair,\r\n\r\n  (1) more than ninety (90) days, then the circuit chair may, at his or her  discretion:\r\n  \r\n     (A) reassign the fee dispute;\r\n     (B) if the amount exceeds $7,500,  appoint a hearing panel, which shall schedule a hearing within thirty (30) days \r\n  \r\n  (2) more than six (6) months, then the circuit chair shall, with the  concurrence of the Executive Council Chair:\r\n  \r\n     (A) reassign the fee dispute;\r\n     (B)  if  the amount exceeds $7,500, appoint a hearing panel, which shall schedule a  hearing within thirty (30) days; or\r\n    (C) return  all investigative notes and application to the designated Bar staff member for  investigation as the assigned member.\r\n  \r\n\r\nIn these events, the original  assigned member shall immediately turn over notes and files to the circuit  chair.\r\n(d) If  the circuit chair is delinquent, then the case may be reassigned to the  Executive Council Chair or the Executive Council Chair's designee.\r\n\r\nRULE 13. PROCEEDINGS OF  THE BOARD\r\nIf the amount in dispute is  $7,500 or less, the decision of the assigned member or Bar staff, with the  concurrence of the circuit chair, shall be the final decision of the Board.\r\nIf the amount in dispute is  more than $7,500, the decision of the assigned member with the concurrence of  the circuit chair shall be served on the parties by first class mail, with  proper postage affixed, or by email, provided the parties have consented to  services by email in accordance with Rules 10. The decision is final unless a  written request for a hearing panel is made by filing such request with the  circuit chair within thirty (30) days after the date of mailing written  notification of the decision. (For Hearing Panel Decision, see Rule 17.)\r\nIf the chair does not concur  with the decision of the assigned member, a hearing panel will be appointed.\r\n\r\nRULE 20. APPEALS\r\n(a) A  party aggrieved by the final decision of the Board may appeal the decision to  the circuit court in the county where the principal place of practice of the  attorney is located. \r\n(b) To  confer jurisdiction of an appeal on the circuit court, the appealing party must  commence the appeal within thirty (30) days after the final decision is mailed  to the appealing party, except that if based upon corruption, fraud, or other  undue means, it must be commenced within thirty (30) days after such grounds  are known or should have been known.\r\n(c) In  order to commence an appeal, the appealing party must:\r\n\r\n  (1) file with the clerk of the circuit court a notice of appeal along with  a signed document certifying the names and addresses to which the appealing  party mailed copies of the notice and the date the copies were mailed. The  notice of appeal must contain (i) the names of all parties to the dispute, (ii)  an indication that the appealing party is appealing from a final decision of  the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board, (iii) a detailed statement of the grounds  for the appeal and (iv) the name, current mailing address, and telephone number  of the appealing party;\r\n    (2) pay the required filing fee to the clerk of  court;\r\n  (3)  mail each other party to the  dispute a copy of the notice of appeal; and\r\n  (4) mail a copy of the notice to  the South Carolina Bar Resolution of Fee Disputes Board.*\r\n\r\nA notice of appeal is  sufficient if it is in writing, is signed by the appealing party, and contains  the information required in sub-paragraph (c)(1).\r\n(d) Filing  an appeal does not stay the issuance of a Certificate of Non-Compliance.  However, if, upon the filing of a notice of appeal, a party pays the disputed  sum to the Bar to be held in trust pending resolution of the appeal, no  Certificate of Non-Compliance shall be issued. The Bar shall remit the disputed  sum to the prevailing party within ten (10) days of the final disposition of  the dispute.\r\n(e) The  Board shall supply to the circuit court a record on appeal, which shall include  such of the following materials as were involved in the proceedings of the  Board: the application, the decision of the assigned member, the concurrence or  non-concurrence of the circuit chair, and the decision of the hearing panel.\r\n(f) The  court shall affirm or vacate the final decision of the Board. The court may  vacate only where:\r\n\r\n  (1) the decision was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;\r\n  (2) there was evident partiality or corruption in an assigned member or  hearing panel member, or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;\r\n  (3) the assigned member or  hearing panel members exceeded their powers;\r\n  (4)  the hearing panel members  refused to postpone the hearing, if any, upon sufficient cause being shown  therefore, or the assigned member or hearing panel members refused to hear  evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise conducted the proceeding so  as to substantially prejudice the rights of a party; or&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  (5)  the hearing panel chair did  not provide notice of the hearing as required under Rule 15.\r\n\r\n(g) In vacating the final decision, the court  may order a reconsideration by a new assigned member appointed by the circuit  chair or, if vacating the decision of a hearing panel, a rehearing before a new  hearing panel appointed by the circuit chair. Any reconsideration or rehearing  shall be de novo, and no reports or decisions of any prior assigned  member or hearing panel shall be considered. When a final decision of the Board  is vacated, any judgment which may have been entered pursuant to that decision  also is vacated.\r\n(h)  The parties and the circuit court shall  provide the Board notice of all proceedings on appeal and the final disposition  of the appeal.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current address of the Board is  Post Office Box 608, Columbia, SC 29202. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nRULE 22. AMENDMENTS TO  RULES\r\nUpon approval by the Bar's  House of Delegates, amendments to these Rules shall be submitted to the Supreme  Court of South Carolina for approval.

Century BMW[1] in light of its decision\r\n  in AT&amp;T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion.[2]Â \r\n  Because the issue of preemption was not preserved for review in the South\r\n  Carolina proceedings, we reinstate our initial opinion.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n I.\r\n\r\n\r\n The underlying action originally came before\r\n  this Court on appeal of the trial court's denial of Appellant Century BMW's\r\n  motion to compel arbitration.Â  We affirmed in result the trial court's denial\r\n  of the motion to compel.[3]Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Following our decision, Appellant filed a\r\n  petition for rehearing, contending this Court's opinion was &quot;inconsistent\r\n  with the United States Supreme Court's recent decision in Stolt-Nielsen S.A.\r\n  v. Animalfeeds International Corp.&quot;[4]Â \r\n  Appellant stated that pursuant to Stolt-Nielsen, &quot;[t]he [Federal\r\n  Arbitration Act] clearly preempts South Carolina law, as this Court construed\r\n  it&quot; and &quot;[i]f a party cannot be compelled to class arbitration absent\r\n  an agreement to arbitrate as a class, a fortiori the FAA preempts any public\r\n  policy requiring class arbitration even where the parties agreed not to\r\n  arbitrate as a class.&quot;Â  In our order denying rehearing, we emphasized that\r\n  our opinion was &quot;wholly based on state law grounds, namely a provision in\r\n  a contract banning class action suits is invalid pursuant to the Dealers Act[5] and the public policy of this State.&quot;Â  We further admonished Appellant for\r\n  attempting to reframe the issues and miscast our holding as &quot;disingenuous\r\n  to the opinion and a holding we never made.&quot;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n Thereafter,\r\n  Appellant petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.Â \r\n  Although the issue was not raised to the trial court or this Court, Appellant\r\n  presented the following question in its certiorari petition:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhether\r\n  the Federal Arbitration Act preempts a state law invalidating a prohibition on\r\n  class arbitration contained in an arbitration agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court's opinion was vacated by the United States\r\n  Supreme Court and remanded for consideration in light of its decision in AT&amp;T\r\n  Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion.Â  Respondents argue that the matter of\r\n  preemption was not preserved in the South Carolina proceedings.Â  We agree and\r\n  therefore adhere to our initial opinion.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  II.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  A.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant contends that the issue of whether the FAA\r\n  preempted state law, which it raised to the United States Supreme Court, was\r\n  sufficiently preserved in the state court proceedings because Appellant\r\n  referenced the state and federal policies favoring arbitration in its filings.[6]Â  We disagree.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n&quot;Issue preservation rules are designed to give\r\n  the trial court a fair opportunity to rule on the issues, and thus provide us\r\n  with a platform for meaningful appellate review.&quot;Â  Queen's Grant II\r\n  Horizontal Prop. Regime v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 368 S.C. 342, 373, 628\r\n  S.E.2d 902, 919 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  At a minimum, issue preservation requires\r\n  that an issue be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  Wilder Corp.\r\n  v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  It is &quot;axiomatic\r\n  that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Imposing such a requirement on the appellant &quot;is meant to enable the lower\r\n  court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and\r\n  arguments.&quot;Â  I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406,\r\n  422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n Constitutional arguments are no exception to\r\n  the preservation rules, and if not raised to the trial court, the issues are\r\n  deemed waived on appeal.Â  Glover v. County of Charleston, 361 S.C. 634,\r\n  606 S.E.2d 773 (2004) overruled on other grounds by Byrd v. City of\r\n  Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 620 S.E.2d 76 (2005); see also Grant v.\r\n  S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 461 S.E.2d 388 (1995) (holding that a\r\n  due process claim raised for the first time on appeal was not preserved); Merriman\r\n  v. Minter, 298 S.C. 110, 378 S.E.2d 441 (1989) (refusing to consider an\r\n  equal protection challenge to a statute on appeal where it was not raised to\r\n  the trial court).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n Of course, a party is not required to use\r\n  the exact name of a legal doctrine in order to preserve the issue.Â  See State\r\n  v. Russell, 345 S.C. 128, 546 S.E.2d 202 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding issue was\r\n  preserved even though defendant did not use exact words &quot;corpus\r\n  delicti&quot; in his request for a directed verdict).Â  Nonetheless, the issue\r\n  must be sufficiently clear to bring into focus the precise nature of the\r\n  alleged error so that it can be reasonably understood by the judge.Â  Wilder\r\n  Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733; see also S.C. Dep't of\r\n  Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 641 S.E.2d 903\r\n  (2007) (finding that although SCDOT did not phrase objection in the exact terms\r\n  used in the issues on appeal, the objection was sufficiently specific to allow\r\n  the trial court to rule on the issue).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n Our appellate rules also offer guidance.Â \r\n  &quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered on appeal which is not set forth\r\n  in the statement of the issues on appeal.&quot;Â  Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR.Â \r\n  When an issue is not specifically set out in the statements of issues, the\r\n  appellate court may nevertheless consider the issue if it is reasonably\r\n  clear from an appellant's arguments.Â  See Eubank v. Eubank,\r\n  347 S.C. 367, 555 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding the statement of issue,\r\n  when read in conjunction with the argument, sufficiently raised the issue to\r\n  the court). Â However, &quot;[e]very ground of appeal ought to be so distinctly\r\n  stated that the reviewing court may at once see the point which it is called\r\n  upon to decide without having to 'grope in the dark' to ascertain the precise\r\n  point at issue.&quot;Â  Jones v. Lott, 387 S.C. 339, 346, 692 S.E.2d 900,\r\n  903 (2010) (internal citation omitted).Â  Similarly, a petition for rehearing\r\n  must &quot;state with particularity the points supposed to have been overlooked\r\n  or misapprehended by the court.&quot;Â  Rule 221(a), SCACR.Â  &quot;The purpose\r\n  of a petition for rehearing is not to present points which lawyers for the\r\n  losing parties have overlooked or misapprehended, nor is it the purpose of the\r\n  petition for rehearing to have the case tried in the appellate court a second\r\n  time.&quot;Â  Kennedy v. S.C. Retirement Sys., 349 S.C. 531, 532, 564\r\n  S.E.2d 322, 322 (2001) (quoting Jean H. Toal, Appellate Practice in South\r\n  Carolina 309 (1999)).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n B.\r\n\r\n\r\n South\r\n  Carolina is not alone in its issue preservation requirements.Â  The United\r\n  States Supreme Court has &quot;consistently refused to decide federal\r\n  constitutional issues raised [to it] for the first time on review of state\r\n  court decisions.&quot;Â  Cardindale v. Lousiana, 394 U.S. 437, 438\r\n  (1969); see also Webb v. Webb, 451 U.S. 493 (1981) (holding where\r\n  the Georgia Supreme Court failed to rule on federal issue, the United States\r\n  Supreme Court was without jurisdiction in the case); Hill v. California,\r\n  401 U.S. 797 (1971) (refusing to reach a Fifth Amendment question when the\r\n  issue was not raised, briefed, or argued at any level of state court).[7] Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Moreover,\r\n  the Supreme Court has stated &quot;[w]hen the highest state court is silent on\r\n  a federal question before us, we assume that the issue was not properly presented,\r\n  and the aggrieved party bears the burden of defeating this assumption by\r\n  demonstrating that the state court had a fair opportunity to address the\r\n  federal question that is sought to be presented here.&quot;Â  Adams v.\r\n  Robertson, 520 U.S. 83, 86-87 (1997) (internal citations omitted).[8]Â  The Supreme\r\n  Court has explained its reasoning for such policies:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n[I]n aÂ \r\n  federal system it is important that state courts be given the first opportunity\r\n  to consider the applicability of state statutes in light of constitutional\r\n  challenge, since the statutes may be construed in a way which saves their\r\n  constitutionality.Â  Or the issue may be blocked by an adequate state ground.Â \r\n  Even though States are not free to avoid constitutional issues on inadequate\r\n  state grounds, they should be given the first opportunity to consider them.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Cardindale,\r\n  394 U.S. at 439.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n C.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have carefully re-examined the record.Â  In all of\r\n  the submissions, memoranda, and hearings before the trial court, not once was\r\n  there a single mention of federal preemption as it relates to the issue before\r\n  us.Â  Certainly, Appellant cites to both the federal and state policy favoring\r\n  arbitration, and no party or court has ever disputed the obviousâ€”both the\r\n  federal and state\r\npolicies do favor arbitration.Â  However, a general\r\n  acknowledgment of a policy favoring arbitration is a far cry from a\r\n  specifically articulated preemption argument.[9]\r\n  \r\n  \r\n Tellingly, the trial court's order denying\r\n  Appellant's motion to compel states &quot;[t]he Plaintiff and Defendant agree\r\n  that Simpson v. MSA of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 644 S.E.2d 663 (2007)[10] is the controlling\r\n  authority of this motion.&quot; (emphasis added). Â In our opinion, this\r\n  opening sentence to the legal analysis section of the trial court's order demonstrates\r\n  Appellant and Respondents' mutual agreement that the case was to be decided by\r\n  reference to state law.Â  That finding was never challenged until the petition\r\n  for rehearing.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n Moreover, it is clear preemption was neither\r\n  a novel nor an unknown argument to Appellant.Â  Significantly, Appellant did\r\n  raise the issue of preemption to the trial court, albeit in a different context.Â  Respondents initially challenged the\r\n  arbitration agreement on the basis that it lacked certain formatting\r\n  requirements under the South Carolina Arbitration Act.Â  However, Appellant\r\n  successfully defeated that state law challenge based on preemption, specifically\r\n  arguing that the FAA preempted state law due to the presence of interstate\r\n  commerce.Â  The voluminous record is\r\n  otherwise silent as to any claim of preemption, until the petition for\r\n  rehearing filed with this Court.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n Simply stated, the question Appellant\r\n  presented to the United States Supreme Court, namely whether the FAA preempted\r\n  our state's legislative policy as set forth in the Dealers Act, was raised\r\n  neither to the trial court nor to our Court.Â  And although the issue of\r\n  preemption was raised in Appellant's rehearing petition, such an attempt was\r\n  untimely and improper as a party may not raise an issue for the first time in a\r\n  petition for rehearing. See Kennedy, 349 S.C. at 532, 564 S.E.2d at\r\n  322 (&quot;The purpose of a petition for rehearing is not to present points\r\n  which lawyers for the losing parties have overlooked or misapprehended, nor is\r\n  it the purpose of the petition for rehearing to have the case tried in the\r\n  appellate court a second time.&quot;).Â  Unquestionably, our opinion in Herron did not address federal preemption.Â  Rather, it quite naturally resolved the\r\n  matter solely on the basis of state law, just as the parties presented it to\r\n  us.Â  See State v. Austin, 306 S.C. 9, 19, 409 S.E.2d 811, 817\r\n  (Ct. App. 1991) (&quot;[A]ppellate courts in this state, like well-behaved\r\n  children, do not speak unless spoken to and do not answer questions they are\r\n  not asked.&quot;).Â  However, the absence of a preemption discussion is not\r\n  attributable to this Court's failure to recognize or understand the arguments\r\n  presented.Â  Rather, Appellants failed to present the issue to us, as evidenced\r\n  by our detailed order denying Appellant's petition for rehearing which rejected\r\n  Appellant's attempt to recast the issues that were presented to us.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n We are mindful of the need to approach issue\r\n  preservation rules with a practical eye and not in a rigid, hyper-technical\r\n  manner.Â  Yet, because Appellant can point to no instance where preemption was\r\n  properly raised or ruled upon, to disregard our issue preservation rules under\r\n  these circumstances would render them meaningless.Â  As this Court observed,\r\n  issue preservation rules &quot;prevent[] a party from keeping an ace card up\r\n  his sleeveâ€”intentionally or by chanceâ€”in the hope that an appellate court will\r\n  accept that ace card and, via a reversal, give him another opportunity to prove\r\n  his case.&quot;Â  I'On, 338 S.C. at 406, 526 S.E.2d at 724.Â  Here,\r\n  intentionally or by chance, Appellant kept the ace card of preemption up its\r\n  sleeve until after this Court filed its opinion.Â  Under even the most liberal\r\n  approach to issue preservation principles, we could not treat Appellant's\r\n  preemption argument as preserved in our courts as a matter of state law.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n Because the matter of preemption was not\r\n  raised to and ruled upon in any of the South Carolina proceedings, we find the\r\n  issue of preemption is procedurally barred as matter of state law and further\r\n  consideration in light of AT&amp;T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion is\r\n  unwarranted.Â  We reinstate our original opinion and decline to revisit it.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  ORIGINAL OPINION REINSTATED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  TOAL, C.J., BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice\r\n  James E. Moore, concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; 387 S.C. 525, 693 S.E.2d 394 (2010).Â Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; 131 S.Ct. 1740 (2011).\r\n[3]&nbsp; A detailed summary of the underlying facts\r\n  and the Court's reasoning for that decision can be found in our original\r\n  opinion.\r\n[4]&nbsp; 130 S.Ct. 1758 (2010).\r\n[5]&nbsp; The full title of the Act is the South\r\n  Carolina Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act, S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-15-10 et seq. (2007).\r\n[6]&nbsp; At oral argument on rehearing, counsel for Appellant went beyond its\r\n  brief and claimed it had made the argument to the effect that &quot;federal law\r\n  controls,&quot; and that such argument was sufficient to preserve the\r\n  preemption argument.Â  We would agree that the argument was preserved if\r\n  Appellant had ever made that argument in any manner related to the issue of\r\n  preemption, but it did not.Â  Just as the word &quot;preemption&quot; appears\r\n  nowhere in the briefs filed with this Court, neither does the argument that the\r\n  &quot;federal law controls.&quot;Â  In short, Appellant presented no argument\r\n  (prior to its rehearing petition) that could reasonably be construed to embrace\r\n  the matter of preemption.\r\n[7]&nbsp; Appellant contends that because the United\r\n  States Supreme Court granted certiorari, Respondents are precluded from arguing\r\n  that the preemption issue is not preserved.Â  We disagree.Â  The Supreme Court\r\n  has previously granted certiorari based on assertions in petitions and later\r\n  refused to rule on the issue because it realized the issue was never raised to\r\n  the state court.Â  See Cardindale, 394 U.S. at 438 (stating that\r\n  &quot;[a]lthough certiorari was granted to consider this question, the fact\r\n  emerged in oral argument that the sole federal question argued here had never\r\n  been raised, preserved, or passed upon in the state courts below&quot;); see\r\n    also Webb, 451 U.S. at 494-95 (stating that because the Court\r\n  disfavors the filing of the state court record, &quot;[the Court] [is] largely\r\n  dependent on assertions made by the parties as to what that record will\r\n  demonstrate concerning the manner in which a federal question was raised\r\n  below&quot;). \r\n[8]&nbsp; The Rules of the Supreme Court also require\r\n  a party to demonstrate the state court addressed the issue presented to it.Â \r\n  Rule 14 states in relevant part:\r\n\r\nIf\r\n  review of a state-court judgment is sought, specification of the stage in the\r\n  proceedings, both in the court of first instance and in the appellate courts,\r\n  when the federal questions sought to be reviewed were raised; the method or\r\n  manner of raising them and the way in which they were passed on by those\r\n  courts; and pertinent quotations of specific portions of the record or summary\r\n  thereof, with specific reference to the places in the record where the matter\r\n  appears (e. g., court opinion, ruling on exception, portion of courtâ€™s\r\n  charge and exception thereto, assignment of error), so as to show that the\r\n  federal question was timely and properly raised and that this Court has\r\n  jurisdiction to review the judgment on a writ of certiorari. \r\n\r\nSup. Ct.\r\n  R. 14(1)(g)(i).\r\n[9]&nbsp; We also note that Appellant cites a\r\n  provision of the FAA, 9 U.S.C. Â§ 2 (2006), in its trial court motions for the\r\n  proposition that the FAA applies to the arbitration agreement at hand.Â  Both\r\n  the trial court and this Court agreed with Appellant.Â  Yet Appellant never cited\r\n  section 2 of the FAA in any fashion that can be construed as anything akin to\r\n  the preemption argument it presented to the United States Supreme Court. \r\n[10]&nbsp; In Simpson, this Court denied a motion\r\n  to compel arbitration, finding an arbitration clause in a vehicle trade-in\r\n  contract was unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable due to a multitude of\r\n  one-sided terms.Â  Notably, the Simpson decision, however, in no way\r\n  dealt with federal preemption.Â  The word &quot;preemption&quot; appears in the Simpson opinion, only to note that preemption was not involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27077","title":"Union County Sheriff's Office v.

Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  27077\r\nHeard November 3, 2011 - Filed December\r\n  19, 2011Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nC.\r\n  Rauch Wise, of Greenwood, for Appellants.\r\nAttorney\r\n  General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Deputy\r\n  Attorney General T. Stephen Lynch, and Assistant Attorney General Mary Frances\r\n  Jowers, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal from a circuit court order affirming\r\n  a magistrate's court order upholding the destruction of seven video games\r\n  determined to be illegal gaming devices prohibited by S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-21-2710 (2000).Â  Appellant Farr (appellant) contends the magistrate's order\r\n  should have been reversed because the State could not identify which of the\r\n  seven machines the confidential informant (CI) had played, and because the\r\n  State could not show that six of the seven machines had a playable illegal game\r\n  at the time of the seizure hearing.Â  We affirm.\r\n Appellant owns\r\n  seven machines seized from a Union business.[1]Â \r\n  The magistrate issued an Order of Destruction/Notice of Post Seizure Hearing\r\n  and appellant timely sought a Post-Seizure Hearing.Â  Following this evidentiary\r\n  hearing, the magistrate issued an order finding the seven machines to be\r\n  illegal gambling devices, and affirming the Order of Destruction.Â  Appellant\r\n  appealed to the circuit court which upheld the magistrate's order after a\r\n  hearing.Â  Appellant's motion to alter or amend was denied. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n       Did the circuit court err in affirming the Order\r\n  of Destruction when the State could not demonstrate that any unlawful game\r\n  could be played on six of the seized machines at the post-seizure hearing?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n       Did the circuit court err in finding the State met\r\n  its burden of proof where the confidential informant (CI) could not identify\r\n  which of the seven machines she had played?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n The magistrate's\r\n  factual findings, confirmed by the circuit court, must be upheld by the\r\n  appellate court if supported by any evidence.Â  South Carolina Law\r\n    Enforcement Div. v. 1-Speedmaster S/N 00218, ____ S.C. ____, ____ S.E.2d\r\n  ___ (Ct. App. 2011).Â  At a post-seizure hearing, the burden is on the owner of\r\n  the res to show why the seized property should not be forfeited and\r\n  destroyed.Â  State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C.\r\n  176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000).\r\nI.&nbsp; Operational at time of hearing\r\nAppellant contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in upholding the magistrate's Order of Destruction when\r\n  the State was unable to prove that six of the seven machines had an illegal\r\n  game installed that could actually be played at the time of the post-seizure\r\n  hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\n The State presented\r\n  evidence that although no illegal game could be played on six of the seven\r\n  machines at the time of the hearing, the hard drive of each machine had an\r\n  administrative record reflecting that the illegal game(s) on the machine had\r\n  been played multiple times.Â  Expert testimony established that the seized\r\n  machines had been altered post-manufacture so that an individual possessing a\r\n  receiver, magnet, or other device could delete the game from the machineâ€™s\r\n  'play list' while leaving the administrative record.Â  A video introduced at the\r\n  post-seizure hearing[2] showed the CI playing an illegal game on one of the machines during the State's\r\n  undercover operation.\r\n Section 12-21-2710\r\n  makes it unlawful to possess illegal gambling machines, even if they are not\r\n  fully operational.Â  The mere possession of the gambling devices, or even their\r\n  component parts, is unlawful.Â  State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game\r\n    Machines, supra.Â  Moreover, testimony from the CI, the video showing\r\n  illegal games being played on one of the machines, evidence that illegal games\r\n  were installed on the machines, and evidence that the machines had been altered\r\n  to allow the &quot;quick&quot; deletion of games is sufficient to uphold the lower\r\n  courts' findings that the machines are illegal gambling devices under Â§\r\n  12-21-2710.Â  Moreover, appellant misstates the burden of proof at the post-seizure\r\n  hearing, which rests upon him to show why the machines should not be forfeited\r\n  and destroyed, and not with the State to prove the machines are operable.Â  State\r\n    v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, supra.Â  Appellant is\r\n  simply in error in arguing that the State must be able to play the illegal game\r\n  at the post-seizure hearing.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Identification\r\n The CI testified\r\n  that she was given $40 before entering the Union business.Â  She inserted the\r\n  two twenties into one of the machines and then played the same game several\r\n  times.Â  She later told the cashier that she was finished playing, and based\r\n  upon the number of free plays remaining on the machine, he gave her $15 from\r\n  the business's till.Â  At the hearing, the CI could not identify which machine\r\n  she had played, but a SLED agent testified that the $40, which had been marked\r\n  before being given to the CI, was found in one of the machines.Â  The SLED agent\r\n  could not identify from which machine the marked money was recovered.Â  \r\n Appellant contends\r\n  that the State failed in its burden of proof because the CI was unable to\r\n  identify on which of the seven machines seized she had actually played the\r\n  illegal game.Â  Appellant misunderstands the burden of proof at this\r\n  post-seizure hearing, which rests solely on the owner of the seized machines to\r\n  show why the machines should not be forfeited and destroyed.Â  State v. 192\r\n    Coin Operated Video Game Machines, supra.Â  There is evidence in the\r\n  record to support the factual findings that all seven machines are illegal\r\n  gambling devices.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n The circuit court\r\n  order affirming the magistrate's order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice Alexander S. Macaulay,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Since this forfeiture action is in rem, the proper defendants are only the\r\n  seven seized machines which are the subject of the Order of Destruction.\r\n[2] Appellant opted not to provide the video to this Court.Â  It is not clear\r\n  whether the video was before the circuit court.Â  In addition, the State had\r\n  eight photos that apparently were introduced at the Post-Seizure Hearing, none\r\n  of which were provided to the Court.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27078","title":"In the Matter of W.

Turner, Jr., Assistant\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nJ.\r\n  Steedley Bogan, of Bogan Law Firm, of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents\r\n  to the imposition of a definite suspension not to exceed two (2) years,\r\n  retroactive to March 13, 2007, the date of his interim suspension.Â  In the\r\n    Matter of McClain, 372 S.C. 518, 643 S.E.2d 680 (2007).Â  In addition,\r\n  respondent agrees to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics\r\n  School within one year of the imposition of a sanction and to make full\r\n  restitution to the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection (Lawyers' Fund).Â  We\r\n  accept the Agreement and impose a definite suspension of two years, retroactive\r\n  to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Respondent shall complete the\r\n  Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School within one year of the date of\r\n  this opinion and shall make full restitution to the Lawyers' Fund.Â  The facts,\r\n  as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n On March 9,\r\n  2007, respondent was arrested and charged with Breach of Peace-Aggravated\r\n  Nature.Â  The charge was later remanded to municipal court.Â  Ultimately, the\r\n  State entered a nolle prosequi on the misdemeanor charge.Â  ODC acknowledges\r\n  criminal conduct could not be established.Â  \r\n Respondent has\r\n  suffered from depression for a number of years and has been under treatment for\r\n  the condition.Â  In May of 2004, respondent suffered a massive heart attack that\r\n  affected his ability to work.Â  In addition, his wife had major health problems\r\n  which strained the family's finances.Â  \r\n Respondent's\r\n  wife worked as a bookkeeper at respondent's law office.Â  Respondent gave a copy\r\n  of Rule 417, SCACR, to his accountant and believed his wife and accountant were\r\n  properly reconciling his trust account.Â  Respondent acknowledges, however, that\r\n  he failed to properly supervise his wife in her handling of his accounts and\r\n  failed to ensure that his firm was operating in compliance with the provisions\r\n  of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  He further admits he was not properly reconciling his\r\n  trust account in accordance with the requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.&nbsp; \r\n As a result of\r\n  his failure to properly supervise his wife/employee, respondent's wife was able\r\n  to embezzle in excess of $75,000 of client funds from respondent's trust\r\n  account over a period of years.Â  Respondent's wife claims she took the funds to\r\n  keep their household running and that she kept her misdeeds from respondent due\r\n  to his heart problems.Â  The Lawyers' Fund has paid claims to respondent's\r\n  clients totaling $80,999.65.\r\n At some point,\r\n  respondent received an email from a client.Â  The email claimed respondent's\r\n  wife was having an affair and accused her of stealing trust account funds.Â \r\n  Initially, respondent did not believe the assertions but subsequently learned\r\n  them to be true.Â  \r\nCounsel\r\n  advised respondent to remove his wife from the office.[1]Â  Respondent submits that before he\r\n  could take any action in removing her or determining the truth about the funds,\r\n  he was placed on interim suspension.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  has been receiving medical treatment.Â  The physician has cleared respondent\r\n  medically to return to practice.Â  \r\nLAW\r\n Respondent\r\n  admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safe keep client property)\r\n  and Rule 5.3 (lawyer possessing managerial authority in law firm shall make\r\n  reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving\r\n  reasonable assurance that non-lawyer employee's conduct is compatible with\r\n  professional obligations of lawyer and shall make\r\n  reasonable efforts to ensure non-lawyer employeeâ€™s conduct is compatible with\r\n  professional obligations of lawyer).Â Â  He further admits he violated provisions\r\n  of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it is ground for discipline for lawyer to violate\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding\r\n  professional conduct of lawyers).Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and impose a definite suspension of two years, retroactive to the\r\n  date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Respondent\r\n  shall complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School within one\r\n  year of the date of this opinion and shall make full restitution to the\r\n  Lawyers' Fund.[2]Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file\r\n  an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent and his wife are now estranged.Â  \r\n[2] Within thirty (30) days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, the Lawyers' Fund and respondent shall enter into a payment plan\r\n  setting forth the terms by which respondent shall repay the Lawyers' Fund for\r\n  all funds paid on his behalf.Â Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Todd, Assistant Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nMax B.\r\n  Singleton, of Greer, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits\r\n  misconduct and agrees to the imposition of a public reprimand with conditions.Â \r\n  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand with conditions as\r\n  specified in the conclusion of this opinion.Â  The facts, as set forth in the\r\n  agreement, are as follows.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\n Respondent represented Client A on\r\n  criminal charges.Â  Respondent failed to communicate with Client A for several\r\n  months and failed to timely relay a plea offer made during that time.Â  Several\r\n  months after the initial plea offer, the prosecutor made a more favorable plea\r\n  offer.Â  Respondent relayed the plea offer to Client A; Client A rejected the\r\n  offer.Â  Ultimately, the charges against Client A were dismissed.Â  \r\n Respondent did not respond to ODC's\r\n  initial inquiry in this matter and did not respond in a timely manner to a\r\n  reminder letter sent pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514,\r\n  290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).Â  \r\nMatter II\r\n Client B, a criminal defense client,\r\n  filed a complaint against respondent.Â  Although the investigation did not\r\n  reveal misconduct during the representation, respondent failed to respond to\r\n  ODC's initial inquiry and responded only after receiving a reminder letter\r\n  pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, id..\r\nMatter III\r\n Respondent represented Client C on\r\n  criminal charges.Â  A dispute arose concerning the fee respondent originally\r\n  quoted and the fee he collected.Â  Respondent believed he had a written fee\r\n  agreement with Client C, but failed to retain a copy as required by Rule 417,\r\n  SCACR.Â  Respondent further violated Rule 417, SCACR, by failing to retain\r\n  records of the source and amount of payments received.Â  \r\n During the investigation, respondent\r\n  failed to timely respond to several inquiries from ODC.Â  He cited the birth of\r\n  his daughter and his wife's related medical problems for the delay of some of\r\n  his responses.Â  Respondent admits these personal issues negatively impacted his\r\n  communications with Client C and other clients.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\n Respondent wrote to Client D, directly\r\n  soliciting the client to hire him on pending drug charges.Â  Client D was not an\r\n  attorney and was a stranger to respondent.Â  \r\nRespondent did not file a copy of\r\n  the letter with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct as required by Rule 7.3(c),\r\n  RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  The letter contained none of the statements required by\r\n  Rule 7.3(d) (1), (2), and (3), although respondent represents he included a\r\n  second page with the mailing which included each of the statements required by\r\n  the rule.Â  Respondent was unable to produce a complete copy of the letter he\r\n  mailed to Client D.Â  Additionally, respondent acknowledges Rule 7.3 requires\r\n  that the words &quot;ADVERTISING MATERIAL&quot; appear on the front of each\r\n  page of the material and the words were not on the first page of the letter he\r\n  sent to Client D.Â  \r\nRespondent filed an untimely response\r\n  to ODC's initial inquiry in this matter. \r\nMatter V\r\n Respondent represented Client E on\r\n  criminal charges.Â  He failed to adequately communicate with Client D during the\r\n  misrepresentation and was ultimately relieved at the client's request.Â  \r\n Respondent failed to submit a full and\r\n  timely response to ODC's request for additional information in this matter.Â  \r\n\r\nMatter VI\r\n Client F hired respondent to represent\r\n  him on criminal charges.Â  Sometime after respondent began work and made an\r\n  appearance, the client advised he was unable to pay respondent's fee and asked\r\n  respondent to step aside so he could be assigned a public defender.Â  Respondent\r\n  failed to timely respond to this request, thereby delaying the client's access\r\n  to a public defender.Â  \r\n Respondent did not respond to ODC's\r\n  Notice of Investigation.Â  ODC sent respondent a reminder letter pursuant to In\r\n    the Matter of Treacy, supra, and scheduled respondent for an interview.Â \r\n  Respondent responded shortly before his scheduled interview, approximately two\r\n  months after issuance of the reminder letter.Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\n Client G hired respondent to represent\r\n  her on pending criminal charges in Spartanburg County.Â  Respondent reports he\r\n  had worked out a favorable plea deal approximately eleven months into the\r\n  representation, but the plea was postponed indefinitely as a result of the\r\n  client's attempted suicide.Â  By that time Client G had also been charged with a\r\n  crime in Greenville County.Â  Thereafter, she was arrested on three additional\r\n  Greenville County charges.Â  \r\n Respondent agreed to represent Client G\r\n  on all of her pending charges in both counties.Â  At times, respondent failed to\r\n  keep Client G informed of the status of her Spartanburg County charges.Â  \r\n Respondent failed to timely respond to\r\n  ODC's Notice of Investigation in this matter, but submitted a response shortly\r\n  before his interview with ODC.Â  Before the interview, respondent spoke with\r\n  Client G and they agreed she would release him from representing her on the\r\n  Greenville County charges.Â  Respondent prepared an order releasing him on three\r\n  of the Greenville County charges, but failed to release him on the fourth.Â \r\n  Believing he had been released on all of Client G's Greenville County charges,\r\n  he ceased working on the charges even though he still represented Client G on\r\n  the fourth charge. \r\n During his interview with ODC,\r\n  respondent agreed to submit additional information to support his response in\r\n  the matter.Â  After the interview, ODC sent respondent a written request for the\r\n  additional information on April 13, 2011.Â  In spite of reminders by letter and\r\n  telephone, respondent failed to comply with the request for additional\r\n  information until August 10, 2011.Â  His response was incomplete and required\r\n  ODC to make multiple additional inquiries to obtain a complete response.Â  \r\nLAW \r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, particularly Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall abide by a\r\n  client's decisions concerning objectives of representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer\r\n  shall act with diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4\r\n  (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of matter and\r\n  promptly inform client of any decision or circumstance to which client's\r\n  informed consent is required); Rule 1.16(d) (upon termination of\r\n  representation, lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to\r\n  protect a client's interests); Rule 7.3(c) (lawyer who uses written\r\n  solicitation shall maintain a file for two years showing the basis by which\r\n  lawyer knows the person solicited needs legal services and the factual basis\r\n  for any statements made in the written communication); Rule 7.3(d) (every written communication from lawyer soliciting\r\n  professional employment from a prospective client known to be in need of legal\r\n  services in a particular matter, and with whom the lawyer has no family, close\r\n  personal or prior professional relationship, shall conform to Rules 7.1 and 7.2,\r\n  RPC, and communication must contain certain statements); and Rule 8.1(b)\r\n  (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for information\r\n  from disciplinary authority).Â  In addition, respondent further admits that he\r\n  violated provisions of Rule 417, SCACR. Â Respondent acknowledges that his\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct)\r\n  and Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to knowingly\r\n  fail to respond to a lawful demand from disciplinary authority).Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent shall 1) pay the costs incurred in the investigation and\r\n  prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the\r\n  Commission) within thirty days of the date of this opinion and 2) complete the\r\n  Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School, Trust Account School, and\r\n  Advertising School within one year of the date of this opinion. \r\nFurther, within forty-five days of\r\n  the date of this opinion, respondent shall hire a law office management advisor\r\n  approved by the Commission.Â  Within thirty days of retaining the advisor,\r\n  respondent shall meet with the advisor to conduct a thorough review of\r\n  respondent's law office management practices.Â  Within thirty days of the\r\n  review, the advisor shall file a complete report of respondent's law office\r\n  management practices with the Commission.Â  The report shall include a review,\r\n  an analysis, and recommendations concerning respondent's law office management\r\n  practices.Â  Thereafter, for a period of two years, respondent shall meet with\r\n  his advisor once every three months and the advisor shall file a complete\r\n  report with the Commission within thirty days of each meeting.Â  Respondent\r\n  shall be responsible for payment of the advisor as well as timely submission of\r\n  the advisor's reports. \r\nRespondent's failure to comply\r\n  with any of the conditions set forth in this opinion or with the advisor's\r\n  recommendations shall constitute grounds for discipline.Â  Â Â Â \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27080","title":"In the Matter of Michael T.

Hursey, Jr., Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 27080\r\nHeard November 29, 2011 - Filed December\r\n  19, 2011\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLesley M. Coggiola,\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph P. Turner, Jr., Assistant Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.Â  \r\nMichael T. Hursey, Jr., of\r\n  Myrtle Beach, pro se Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this attorney disciplinary action, the Commission\r\n  on Lawyer Conduct (&quot;Commission&quot;) investigated Formal Charges filed\r\n  against attorney Michael T. Hursey, Jr. (&quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging\r\n  misconduct in thirteen matters. We disbar Respondent based on the underlying\r\n  misconduct and Respondent's abandonment of his law practice.Â  \r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nRespondent was admitted to\r\n  the practice of law in South Carolina on November 3, 2001. \r\nOn August 11, 2006, he was\r\n  placed on Interim Suspension by order of this Court.Â  In re Hursey, 370\r\n  S.C. 41, 634 S.E.2d 642 (2006).Â  Upon the petition of the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;ODC&quot;), the Court appointed Eldon D. Risher,\r\n  III as the attorney to protect the interests of Respondent's clients by order\r\n  dated November 20, 2006.[1]Â \r\n  At that time, it was discovered that Respondent had taken all of his files and\r\n  bank records with him, and ODC was unable to recover them.\r\nRespondent was\r\n  administratively suspended by the South Carolina Commission on Continuing Legal\r\n  Education and Specialization effective April 1, 2007 for noncompliance with CLE\r\n  reporting requirements.Â  He was formally suspended for noncompliance effective\r\n  June 1, 2007 by order of this Court dated June 6, 2007.Â  \r\nODC filed Formal Charges\r\n  against Respondent on May 13, 2010 alleging misconduct in thirteen matters.Â \r\n  The matters involved his delicts in handling a variety of real estate closings,\r\n  domestic actions, and a criminal case; his failure to pay a court reporter; and\r\n  his posting of inappropriate comments containing nudity, profanity, and drug\r\n  references on his MySpace page that identified the name and location of his law\r\n  firm.Â  \r\nRespondent did not answer\r\n  the Formal Charges despite evidence that notice was sent to him by certified\r\n  mail.Â  Respondent was held in default, and he was sent notice of the Default\r\n  Order as well as notice of the scheduling of the hearing date. Â Â \r\nThe Hearing Panel conducted\r\n  a hearing on May 25, 2011.Â  Respondent did not attend and was not represented\r\n  by counsel. Â Counsel for ODC stated repeated attempts had been made to serve\r\n  Respondent at his two last known addresses in South Carolina, but they had been\r\n  unable to locate him.Â  In addition, SLED had unsuccessfully explored several leads,\r\n  including reports that Respondent might have left the country.\r\nThe Hearing Panel thereafter\r\n  filed a written Panel Report in which it found the factual allegations in the\r\n  thirteen matters were deemed admitted due to Respondent's default and failure\r\n  to appear at the disciplinary hearing.Â  In summary, the Hearing Panel found\r\n  Respondent had committed the following acts:Â  \r\n(1) mishandled real estate\r\n  closings, which included having deeds improperly drawn (in some cases, mobile\r\n  homes purchased remained titled in the names of the sellers as Respondent or\r\n  his paralegal attempted to convey the mobile homes as part of the property\r\n  instead of separately), reciting false monetary amounts in the deeds, having a\r\n  $60,000 shortfall in his trust account, and failing to cooperate with\r\n  purchasers and lenders who requested deeds, mortgages, title binders and\r\n  policies, and other documents; Respondent failed to properly supervise the\r\n  paralegal with whom he was associated; the paralegal, who owned Paralegal\r\n  Services, LLC, manipulated trust accounts, forged Respondent's name to\r\n  documents and checks, and lost files (The Coleman Matter, The Normandin Matter,\r\n  The Baumgartner Matter, and The Lovelace Matter); \r\n (2) failed to communicate with a client\r\n  about her case and to promptly file a rule to show cause and have an order\r\n  signed despite repeated requests (The Rossi-Zita Matter); \r\n (3) failed to file a QDRO in a domestic case\r\n  (The Lewis Matter); failed to file a rule to show cause and to provide a\r\n  detailed billing statement in another domestic case (The Collins Matter); and\r\n  obtained a temporary order in a divorce case, but then did no further work and\r\n  ceased all communication with the client (The Carroll Matter);\r\n (4) failed to communicate with a client\r\n  about a civil case (The Attaway Matter); failed to adequately advise a client\r\n  in a criminal matter and refused to provide a partial fee refund after agreeing\r\n  to do so (The Shannon Matter); and accepted a client in another case and then\r\n  did no work on the case for over two years despite repeated requests (The Rush\r\n  Matter);\r\n(5) failed to pay a court\r\n  reporter $101.00 due for her services, despite repeated requests (The McCarthy\r\n  Matter); and\r\n(6) maintained a webpage on\r\n  MySpace.com that contained profanity and nudity along with the name of his law\r\n  firm and the city of its location; among his comments, Respondent stated he\r\n  would &quot;take the 5th&quot; in regards to what drugs he had done in the past\r\n  as well as which drugs he had done in the past week (The Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  Matter). \r\nThe Hearing Panel found the\r\n  admitted acts constituted misconduct and that Respondent violated the following\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct (&quot;RPC&quot;) contained in Rule 407, SCACR:Â \r\n  Rule 1.1 (competence); Rule 1.3 (diligence); Rule 1.4 (communication); Rule 1.5\r\n  (fees); Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property); Rule 3.2 (expediting litigation);\r\n  Rule 4.1 (truthfulness in statements to others); Rule 5.3 (responsibilities\r\n  regarding non-lawyer assistants); Rule 8.1(b) (knowing failure to respond to a\r\n  lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a)\r\n  (violating the RPC, knowingly assisting or inducing another to do so, or doing\r\n  so through the acts of another); Rule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct involving\r\n  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in\r\n  conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nThe Hearing Panel further\r\n  found that Respondent's conduct established grounds for discipline under the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE)\r\n  contained in Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (violation of the RPC); Rule\r\n  7(a)(3) (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary\r\n  authority); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice, tending to bring the legal profession into disrepute,\r\n  and demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violation of\r\n  the Oath of Office taken upon admission to practice law in South Carolina).Â  \r\nThe Hearing Panel recommended\r\n  the sanction of disbarment based on Respondent's &quot;underlying misconduct,\r\n  Respondent's failure to fully cooperate in the disciplinary investigation, and\r\n  his failure to answer the formal charges and appear at the hearing.&quot;Â  It\r\n  also recommended that, prior to filing any petition for reinstatement,\r\n  Respondent be required to (1) pay the costs of these proceedings, which total\r\n  $507.44; (2) pay restitution of $101.00 to the court reporter, Ms. McCarthy; and\r\n  (3) reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for any amounts paid to\r\n  Respondent's former clients as a result of his misconduct and, in the event the\r\n  Fund pays less than is actually owed to a client (because of any per\r\n  attorney/per client cap), that Respondent pay the former client the\r\n  difference.Â  \r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nNeither Respondent nor ODC\r\n  has filed a brief with this Court taking exception to the Panel Report and the\r\n  recommended sanction of disbarment.\r\nThe authority to discipline\r\n  attorneys rests entirely with this Court.Â  In re White, 391 S.C. 581,\r\n  707 S.E.2d 411 (2011); see also S.C. Const. art. V, Â§&nbsp;4 (&quot;The\r\n  Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction over the admission to the practice of law\r\n  and the discipline of persons admitted.&quot;).Â  The Court &quot;has the sole authority . . . to decide the appropriate\r\n  sanction after a thorough review of the record.&quot;&nbsp; In re Thompson,\r\n  343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).&nbsp; &quot;The Court is not bound\r\n  by the panel's recommendation and may make its own findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law.&quot;&nbsp; In re Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661\r\n  S.E.2d 102, 106&nbsp;(2008); see also Rule 27(e)(2), RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR (&quot;The Supreme Court may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in\r\n  part the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the\r\n  Commission.&quot;).&nbsp; \r\n&quot;A disciplinary\r\n  violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;&nbsp; In re\r\n    Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see also Rule\r\n  8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;Charges of misconduct or incapacity shall be\r\n  established by clear and convincing evidence, and the burden of proof of the\r\n  charges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.&quot;).\r\n Respondent was found to be in default for\r\n  failing to answer the formal charges and he failed to appear at the proceeding\r\n  before the Hearing Panel; consequently, he is deemed to have admitted the\r\n  factual allegations contained in the Formal Charges.Â  See Rule 24(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR\r\n  (&quot;Failure to answer the formal charges shall constitute an admission of\r\n  the factual allegations.&quot;); Rule 24(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;If\r\n  the respondent should fail to appear when specifically so ordered by the\r\n  hearing panel or the Supreme Court, the respondent shall be deemed to have admitted the factual\r\n  allegations which were to be the subject of such appearance and to have\r\n  conceded the merits of any motion or recommendations to be considered at such\r\n  appearance.&quot;); see also Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR\r\n  (&quot;The failure of a party to file a brief taking exceptions to the report\r\n  constitutes acceptance of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\r\n  recommendations.&quot;). \r\n We agree with the Hearing Panel\r\n  that the factual allegations, as deemed\r\n  admitted, support a finding of misconduct.Â  Having found that ODC has met the\r\n  burden of establishing Respondent's misconduct by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence, this Court need only determine the appropriate sanction and whether\r\n  to accept the Hearing Panel's recommendation of disbarment.Â  In re Boney,\r\n  390 S.C. 407, 702 S.E.2d 241 (2010); In re Jacobsen, 386 S.C. 598, 690\r\n  S.E.2d 560 (2010); In re Tullis, 375 S.C. 190, 652 S.E.2d 395 (2007).\r\nRespondent's circumstances\r\n  are similar to those of In re Boney, in which the attorney was charged\r\n  with committing misconduct in six matters.Â  390 S.C. at 408, 702 S.E.2d at\r\n  241.Â  This Court held the attorney's &quot;abandonment of her law practice\r\n  without appropriate regard for the interests of her clients, and her subsequent\r\n  misconduct in failing to answer the formal charges, failing to submit to ODC's\r\n  subpoena, and failing to appear at the hearing convened by the Hearing Panel,\r\n  as well as her continued failure to participate in the disciplinary process,\r\n  warrant[ed] her disbarment.&quot;Â  Id. at 416, 702 S.E.2d at 245-46.Â  We\r\n  noted the attorney had not communicated with ODC for over two years and,\r\n  according to a SLED investigator, she had left the state.Â  Id. at 416,\r\n  702 S.E.2d at 246.\r\nLikewise, disbarment was\r\n  deemed appropriate in In re Okplalaeke, 374 S.C. 186, 648 S.E.2d 593\r\n  (2007).Â  In that case, the attorney committed misconduct in nine matters,\r\n  including failing to properly disburse settlement money, threatening criminal\r\n  prosecution in order to gain advantage in a civil matter, and systematically\r\n  failing to properly oversee and fulfill the financial obligation of his law\r\n  practice, and then left the United States with no apparent intention of\r\n  returning and with the knowledge that disciplinary action against him was\r\n  imminent.Â  Id. at 194, 648 S.E.2d at 597-98.Â  The attorney never\r\n  answered the Formal Charges and did not appear at the disciplinary hearing.Â  Id. at 193, 648 S.E.2d at 597.Â  \r\nThe Court agreed with the\r\n  Hearing Panel &quot;that [the attorney's] conduct indicates an obvious\r\n  disinterest in the practice of law&quot; and found that &quot;since his\r\n  departure, [he] has shown no regard for the status of his license to practice\r\n  law in South Carolina.&quot;Â  Id. at 194, 648 S.E.2d at 597-98.Â  The\r\n  Court stated &quot;a central purpose of the attorney disciplinary process is to\r\n  protect the public from unscrupulous or indifferent lawyers.&quot;Â  Id. at 194-95, 648 S.E.2d at 598.\r\nWe concluded disbarment was\r\n  warranted in In Re Bagnell, 393 S.C. 382, 713 S.E.2d 304 (2011), where\r\n  the attorney agreed to represent a client in a dispute against a financial\r\n  institution over a debt, but then abandoned the client, causing the client to\r\n  suffer $28,800 in damages.Â  Id. at 383-84, 713 S.E.2d at 305.Â  The\r\n  attorney did not answer the Formal Charges, and he did not appear at the\r\n  proceeding before the Hearing Panel nor at oral argument in this Court.Â  Id. at 384, 713 S.E.2d at 305.Â  We cited a series of decisions supporting the\r\n  principle, articulated &quot;on numerous occasions,&quot; that an attorney who\r\n  fails to answer the charges or appear to defend or explain the alleged\r\n  misconduct indicates an obvious disinterest in the practice of law, and noted\r\n  that attorneys who engage in such conduct will face severe sanctions.Â  Id. at 386, 713 S.E.2d at 306.Â  \r\n In the current matter before this Court, we agree\r\n  with the Hearing Panel that disbarment is justified.Â  Due to Respondent's failure\r\n  to answer the Formal Charges Respondent is deemed to have admitted the factual\r\n  allegations in the thirteen matters outlined above, among them the failure to\r\n  maintain his trust account, the failure to adequately supervise the paralegal\r\n  with whom he was associated and to properly perform his duties as the closing\r\n  attorney, and the neglect of numerous matters in his representation of clients\r\n  in various real estate, domestic, and criminal cases.Â  \r\nFurther, Respondent has\r\n  abandoned his law practice without regard to the status of his law license.Â  Respondent\r\n  has never communicated with ODC, and he did not appear at the oral argument\r\n  before this Court.Â  Respondent's failure to petition this Court for\r\n  reinstatement within three years \r\nof his suspension as provided by Rule 419(g), SCACR is\r\n  additional proof of his obvious indifference to the practice of law and the\r\n  status of his law license.[2]Â  \r\nWe also agree with the\r\n  Hearing Panel's recommendation regarding the payment of costs, payment of\r\n  restitution to the court reporter, and reimbursement to the Lawyers' Fund for\r\n  Client Protection prior to filing a petition for reinstatement.Â  The payment of\r\n  costs is a crucial component of any disciplinary action, and both restitution\r\n  and reimbursement to the Fund are within the scope of allowable sanctions\r\n  frequently implemented by this Court.Â  See, e.g., In re Prendergast, 390\r\n  S.C. 395, 403-04, 702 S.E.2d 364, 368 (2010) (&quot;find[ing] the payment of\r\n  costs is a crucial component of a sanction for attorney misconduct&quot;); Rule 27(e)(3), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;The\r\n  Supreme Court may assess costs against the respondent if it finds the\r\n  respondent has committed misconduct.&quot;); Rule 7(b)(6), RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR (stating sanctions for misconduct may include the &quot;assessment of the\r\n  costs of the proceedings, including the cost of hearings, investigations,\r\n  prosecution, service of process and court reporter services&quot;); Rule\r\n  7(b)(5), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (allowing restitution); Rule 7(b)(9), RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR (providing for other appropriate sanctions).\r\nIII.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we\r\n  disbar Respondent.Â  Prior to any petition for reinstatement being filed,\r\n  Respondent must establish that he has (1)\r\n  paid the costs of the disciplinary proceedings; (2) paid restitution of $101.00\r\n  to the court reporter; and (3) reimbursed the Lawyers' Fund for Client\r\n  Protection for amounts paid to his former clients, as well as paid his former\r\n  clients any amounts owed that were not covered by the Fund.\r\nDISBARRED. \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Risher was\r\n  relieved from his appointment on September 18, 2008.Â \r\n[2]Â  Rule 419(g),\r\n  SCACR states:Â  &quot;If a lawyer fails to seek reinstatement within three (3)\r\n  years of being suspended by the Court, the lawyer's membership in the South\r\n  Carolina Bar shall be terminated and the lawyer's name shall be removed from\r\n  the roll of attorneys.Â  The lawyer must thereafter comply with Rule 402, SCACR,\r\n  to be readmitted to the practice of law in this state.&quot;Â  Administrative\r\n  suspensions and/or terminations are distinguishable from disbarment, and even if an attorney is no longer a member of the South\r\n  Carolina Bar, the attorney is still subject to discipline by this Court for\r\n  acts committed while an active member.Â  See Rule 2(q), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (defining a lawyer\r\n  subject to discipline as &quot;anyone admitted to practice law in this state,\r\n  including any formerly admitted lawyer with respect to acts committed prior to\r\n  resignation or disbarment&quot;); In re Trexler, 350 S.C. 483, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 470 (2002) (holding the attorney was subject to discipline for\r\n  additional acts of misconduct committed prior to disbarment for misconduct in\r\n  other matters).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Dudek, and Senior\r\n          Appellate Defender Joseph L. Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n          General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka,\r\n          of Columbia, and Solicitor William Walter Wilkins, III, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â \r\n  In this capital case, Jerry Buck Inman pleaded guilty to the murder,\r\n  first-degree burglary, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and kidnapping of\r\n  a Clemson University student.Â  The judge sentenced Inman to death for murder\r\n  and two consecutive thirty-year sentences for first-degree burglary and\r\n  first-degree criminal sexual conduct.[1]Â  \r\nOn appeal, Inman challenges the judge's acceptance of\r\n  his guilty plea as he contends it was conditional in that defense counsel maintained\r\n  Inman was entitled to be sentenced by a jury despite his plea of guilty.[2]Â \r\n  Additionally, Inman asserts the judge erred in addressing his allegations of\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct arising out of the Solicitor's treatment of the\r\n  defense's expert witness during the sentencing proceedings.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Inman claims the judge erred in the following respects:Â  (1) refusing to recuse\r\n  the Solicitor's Office from any further involvement in the case; (2) declining defense\r\n  counsel's request to question the Solicitor on the issue of prosecutorial\r\n  misconduct; and (3) declining to grant a mistrial despite a finding of\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct.Â  We affirm Inman's guilty plea and sentences.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Factual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nA.\r\nOn the evening of May 25, 2006, Tiffany Marie Souers (the\r\n  Victim), a rising junior at Clemson University, was alone in her off-campus\r\n  apartment as her roommates were gone for the day.Â  When one of her roommates\r\n  returned to the apartment during the afternoon of May 26, 2006, she discovered\r\n  the Victim's partially-clad body on the bedroom floor.Â  An autopsy revealed the\r\n  Victim had been sexually assaulted and died as the result of asphyxia due to\r\n  ligature strangulation with a bathing suit top.\r\nSurveillance photographs taken during the early\r\n  morning hours of May 26, 2006 captured a male, whose face was covered by a\r\n  bandana, attempting to use the Victim's ATM card at two different bank machines\r\n  in Clemson.Â  Â Â \r\nOn June 5, 2006, law enforcement was able to identify\r\n  Inman as the Victim's perpetrator based on DNA evidence obtained from the crime\r\n  scene and processed through the National DNA Database, which had Inman's DNA\r\n  evidence on file due to his prior out-of-state convictions for sexual offenses\r\n  in 1987 and 1988. Â Using this information, law enforcement conducted a\r\n  well-publicized nationwide search for Inman. Â On June 6, 2006 at approximately\r\n  11:45 p.m., law enforcement apprehended Inman in Dandridge, Tennessee.Â  \r\nShortly after his arrest, Inman orally confessed to\r\n  the crimes involving the Victim.Â  Within the course of the next three hours,\r\n  Inman gave separate written statements to an agent with the Tennessee Bureau of\r\n  Investigation and to agents with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division\r\n  (SLED).Â  In these two statements, Inman again confessed to the charged crimes\r\n  and recounted in detail the events underlying these crimes.Â  When asked to sign\r\n  these statements, Inman declined and stated &quot;we still have to go to\r\n  court.&quot;\r\nUltimately, Inman was extradited to South Carolina and\r\n  detained in the Pickens County Detention Center where a DNA sample was taken\r\n  from him and again conclusively matched to the DNA evidence recovered from the Victim\r\n  and her apartment.Â  Subsequently, a Pickens County grand jury indicted Inman\r\n  for murder, kidnapping, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and first-degree\r\n  burglary.Â  The Thirteenth Circuit Solicitor's Office timely served Inman with\r\n  its intent to seek the death penalty.[3]Â  \r\nAfter a circuit court judge determined that Inman was\r\n  competent to stand trial,[4] defense counsel filed a motion to determine the mode of trial.Â  In the motion,\r\n  counsel informed the judge of Inman's intent to enter a guilty plea to the\r\n  crimes and demand a jury trial for sentencing. Â After a hearing, the judge summarily\r\n  denied the motion on the ground he was &quot;constrained by the existing case\r\n  law in South Carolina and the statutes.&quot; \r\nB.\r\nOn August 19, 2008, Inman pleaded guilty to murder,\r\n  first-degree criminal sexual conduct, first-degree burglary, and kidnapping.Â \r\n  During the plea colloquy, the judge informed Inman of the charges, the maximum\r\n  possible sentences, and the constitutional rights that he was waiving by\r\n  pleading guilty, including the right to a jury trial.Â  Although Inman indicated\r\n  he understood these rights, defense counsel interjected that Inman should be\r\n  entitled to enter a guilty plea and then proceed to a jury trial for\r\n  sentencing.Â  In response, the judge informed Inman that he could not enter a\r\n  plea &quot;conditioned&quot; on the preservation of the jury trial issue.Â \r\n  Inman stated that he understood and still wished to plead guilty.Â  Inman then\r\n  admitted his guilt and expressed satisfaction with his defense counsel.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Solicitor Robert M. Ariail (the Solicitor) presented a factual basis for the charged\r\n  offenses that consisted of a stipulated summary of the facts.Â  \r\nWhen the judge resumed questioning Inman, he again\r\n  inquired whether Inman understood that by pleading guilty he was waiving his\r\n  right to have a jury sentence him for the murder conviction.Â  Inman responded\r\n  in the affirmative. Â Defense counsel, however, reiterated that Inman should not\r\n  have to waive the right to have a jury determine his sentence.Â  He emphasized\r\n  that he &quot;just want[ed] to make sure [the issue] is preserved.&quot;\r\nIn response, the judge again explained to Inman that\r\n  he could not accept a &quot;conditional guilty plea.&quot;Â  The judge also instructed\r\n  that he could not determine whether the jury sentencing issue was preserved for\r\n  appellate review as it was a decision for the South Carolina Supreme Court. Inman\r\n  indicated that he understood the judge's explanation and expressed his desire\r\n  to continue the plea proceeding.Â  The judge accepted Inman's plea and instructed\r\n  that the sentencing proceeding would be held on September 8, 2008.Â  \r\nThe Solicitor then expressed his concern that defense\r\n  counsel's statements about the preservation of an appellate issue effectively\r\n  made the plea conditional. Â Defense counsel disputed the conditional nature of\r\n  the plea, but assured Inman that the &quot;issue is preserved and will survive\r\n  the guilty plea.&quot;Â  \r\nBased on this exchange, the\r\n  judge debated whether to accept Inman's plea, but ultimately asked Inman\r\n  whether his plea was &quot;dependent&quot; on the jury sentencing issue. Â After\r\n  conferring with defense counsel, Inman acknowledged that his plea was not based\r\n  on whether he would succeed on an issue raised on appeal.Â  Inman stated,\r\n  &quot;I just want to enter the plea and get it over with, just go on from here\r\n  with the sentencing phase.&quot; \r\nAt\r\n  the conclusion of the plea colloquy, the judge accepted Inman's plea and found\r\n  that it was freely, knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. \r\nC.\r\nOn September 8, 2008, the judge commenced the non-jury\r\n  sentencing proceeding. Â In presenting its case for statutory aggravating\r\n  circumstances, the State called two of the law enforcement officers to whom\r\n  Inman confessed to the charged crimes. Â Additionally, Dr. Eric Dean\r\n  Christensen, the forensic pathologist who conducted the Victim's autopsy, certified\r\n  the Victim's death was caused by &quot;asphyxia due to ligature\r\n  strangulation.&quot; Â He further testified that there was &quot;extensive\r\n  bruising&quot; on the Victim's body, which he believed was consistent with a\r\n  physical struggle and the Victim being restrained.Â  He also found physical\r\n  evidence that suggested &quot;traumatic sexual relations.&quot;\r\nIn terms of Inman's criminal history, the State\r\n  offered extensive evidence of Inman's prior convictions in Florida and North\r\n  Carolina as well as evidence of two unadjudicated incidents that occurred after\r\n  Inman was released from the Florida Department of Corrections on September 1,\r\n  2005.\r\nSubsequently, defense counsel initiated the case for\r\n  mitigation.Â Â  As the defense's first expert witness, counsel called Dr. David\r\n  Richard Price, a forensic psychologist/neuropsychologist and clinical\r\n  psychologist, who interviewed Inman and reviewed records regarding Inman's\r\n  family, his prior crimes, his terms of incarceration, and his mental health\r\n  records.\r\nBased on these records, Dr. Price concluded that Inman\r\n  suffered from the following:Â  major depressive disorder, recurrent type; major\r\n  depressive disorder with psychotic features; bipolar disorder; psychorhythmic\r\n  disorder; schizoid personality disorder; dissociative identity disorder; and\r\n  sexual paraphilia.Â  In making these diagnoses, Dr. Price took into account\r\n  Inman's extensive psychiatric history and his childhood, which included\r\n  &quot;pretty significant&quot; records indicating that Inman had been sexually\r\n  abused, physically abused, grew up in a &quot;very unstable environment,&quot; suffered\r\n  with a mother who was schizophrenic and an alcoholic father, began using drugs\r\n  at an early age, and was incarcerated at age seventeen.Â  Dr. Price also\r\n  testified that Inman had attempted suicide on seven occasions, six of which occurred\r\n  while he was incarcerated.Â  He further stated that Inman believed the death\r\n  penalty was the appropriate punishment for the murder of the Victim.Â \r\n  Ultimately, Dr. Price opined that Inman committed the crimes against the Victim\r\n  while he was under the influence of a mental and emotional disturbance and that\r\n  his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was\r\n  substantially impaired. \r\nDefense counsel next called Dr. Marti Loring, a Georgia-licensed\r\n  clinical social worker and board certified expert in traumatic stress who was\r\n  employed at the Center for Mental Health and Human Development in Atlanta,\r\n  Georgia.Â  The defense offered Dr. Loring &quot;as an expert in the field of\r\n  trauma, abuse, forensic and therapeutic interviewing, and as a social historian\r\n  in capital sentencing cases.&quot;\r\nDuring voir dire, the Solicitor inquired\r\n  whether Dr. Loring had &quot;performed services under [her] licensed clinical\r\n  social worker status&quot; and whether she was licensed in South Carolina.Â \r\n  Upon receiving Dr. Loring's response that she was not licensed in South\r\n  Carolina, the Solicitor directed the judge's attention to section 40-63-200 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code,[5] which deals with the unauthorized practice of social work within the State of\r\n  South Carolina.Â  The Solicitor also pointed out that the statute &quot;carries\r\n  both civil and criminal penalties for violation.&quot;Â  Based on this statute,\r\n  the Solicitor argued that Dr. Loring was &quot;not qualified as an expert in\r\n  this state to testify or to render those services until she gets\r\n  licensed.&quot;Â  \r\nIn response, defense counsel argued that Dr. Loring's\r\n  Georgia license was sufficient to qualify her as an expert witness in Inman's\r\n  case. Â Counsel objected to the Solicitor's questioning and characterized it as\r\n  &quot;an inappropriate attempt to intimidate the witness with the authority\r\n  that this Solicitor has in this state to indict.&quot;Â  Counsel added that the\r\n  Solicitor had put Dr. Loring &quot;in a position where she may need to assert\r\n  her Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate herself by answering the\r\n  questions that I would otherwise have propounded to her.&quot;Â  \r\nThe judge overruled the Solicitor's objection as he\r\n  believed the intent of the statute was &quot;to prevent persons from opening\r\n  offices to conduct treatment in this state,&quot; which was distinguishable\r\n  from Dr. Loring being retained as an expert for the defense.Â  \r\nAfter the judge determined that Dr. Loring was\r\n  qualified to testify, defense counsel argued that the Solicitor's attempt to\r\n  intimidate Dr. Loring constituted a violation of Inman's due process rights to\r\n  present his defense.Â Â Â  The Solicitor disputed this allegation and stated he\r\n  could grant Dr. Loring immunity from prosecution in Inman's case.Â  However, he\r\n  clarified that he was not authorized to grant immunity for the other South\r\n  Carolina cases in which she had testified.Â  \r\nDr. Loring then expressed her concern about testifying\r\n  and was granted an opportunity to consult with Bill Godfrey, an attorney who\r\n  was present in the courtroom.Â  When court reconvened, Dr. Loring stated she\r\n  felt &quot;threatened as a witness&quot; and, as a result, invoked her Fifth\r\n  Amendment right against self-incrimination upon the advice of counsel.Â  Despite\r\n  assurances by the judge that she would be granted immunity in Inman's case and\r\n  prior cases, Dr. Loring maintained that she would not testify as she believed\r\n  she would be &quot;in violation of a criminal statute [that] would affect [her]\r\n  professional reputation in other cases and in other jurisdictions.&quot;Â  \r\nThe judge then held in abeyance any motions regarding\r\n  Dr. Loring's testimony and permitted defense counsel to call its remaining four\r\n  witnesses in mitigation. \r\nThe next day, defense counsel\r\n  moved for a mistrial based on the Solicitor's voir dire of Dr. Loring. Â Specifically,\r\n  counsel characterized the Solicitor's actions as prosecutorial misconduct.Â  As\r\n  additional support for this motion, defense counsel referenced an earlier\r\n  capital case where the Solicitor had confronted another defense witness with a\r\n  potential violation of section 40-63-200 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Counsel\r\n  claimed that in both of these instances the Solicitor had violated the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct[6] and section 16-9-340[7],\r\n  which makes it a crime to intimidate a witness &quot;by threat or force&quot;\r\n  or to &quot;attempt to obstruct or impede the administration of justice in any\r\n  court.&quot;Â  Because counsel did not believe the actions of the Solicitor\r\n  could be rectified, defense counsel moved for a mistrial as well as the recusal\r\n  of the Solicitor's office in the case.Â  In addition, defense counsel requested\r\n  that the judge implement a sentence of life without parole as he claimed the\r\n  Solicitor's conduct was &quot;intentional.&quot;\r\nIn response, the Solicitor\r\n  contended that he had neither threatened Dr. Loring nor moved to indict her\r\n  &quot;even though, theoretically, she would have violated the statute from a\r\n  prior case.&quot;\r\nAt the conclusion of these\r\n  arguments, counsel for Dr. Loring informed the court that Dr. Loring would not\r\n  testify and intended to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. \r\nThe judge did not rule on the\r\n  mistrial motion, but instead granted a continuance in order for defense counsel\r\n  to retain another social historian.Â  The judge, however, added that he\r\n  &quot;wouldn't rule that Dr. Loring [was] completely out of the case.&quot;Â  \r\nSeven months later, the judge\r\n  held a hearing on April 14, 2009 to consider whether Dr. Loring should be\r\n  released as a witness given the defense did not intend to call her and had\r\n  retained another social historian.Â  Â Â In his motion, counsel for Dr. Loring\r\n  objected to the State's out-of-state witness subpoena of Dr. Loring as a\r\n  necessary and material witness. Â At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge\r\n  declined to withdraw his certification of the subpoena[8] and stated that the case would proceed the following week. \r\nOn April 15, 2009, a Superior\r\n  Court in Atlanta, Georgia signed an order directing Dr. Loring to attend a\r\n  hearing the next day at 3:00 p.m. to determine her material witness status in\r\n  South Carolina. Â Because Dr. Loring was at work when the order was left at her\r\n  residence on the morning of April 16, 2009, she did not appear at the hearing.Â \r\n  Later that night, officers attempted to serve a warrant for her arrest.Â  After\r\n  Dr. Loring's counsel contacted the South Carolina plea judge regarding the\r\n  Georgia matter, the judge intervened and persuaded the District Attorney's\r\n  Office in Atlanta to &quot;table&quot; the warrant based on the assurance that\r\n  Dr. Loring would appear at the Pickens County Courthouse on April 20, 2009.\r\nOn April 20-22, 2009, the\r\n  judge reconvened the sentencing proceedings.Â  At the beginning of the hearing,\r\n  Dr. Loring's counsel recounted the events in Georgia and argued that this\r\n  constituted additional evidence of the Solicitor's attempt to intimidate Dr.\r\n  Loring.Â  As a result, he moved to have Dr. Loring immediately released as a\r\n  witness in Inman's case.\r\nDefense counsel concurred in these\r\n  arguments and stated that the &quot;sequence of events in Georgia would go\r\n  directly to the motion for prosecutorial misconduct and the mistrial that we\r\n  requested orally on September 11, 2008.&quot;Â  \r\nIn response, the Solicitor\r\n  denied any involvement in the Georgia events and claimed it was &quot;every bit\r\n  the fault of Dr. Loring, under the Georgia system.&quot; Â To counter this\r\n  statement, defense counsel called Dr. Loring as a witness to testify for the limited\r\n  purpose of documenting what transpired in Georgia.Â  Although Dr. Loring came\r\n  prepared to testify as a mitigation expert, she could not &quot;assure [the\r\n  court] a hundred percent that going through all this would not have an impact\r\n  on [her].&quot;Â  \r\nFollowing Dr. Loring's\r\n  testimony, defense counsel renewed its motion for the &quot;recusal of the\r\n  Thirteenth Circuit Solicitor's Office.&quot;Â  Counsel contended the Solicitor's\r\n  actions were intentional in that he knew the elimination of Dr. Loring's\r\n  testimony would significantly impact Inman's case.Â  In support of this\r\n  contention, defense counsel offered testimonial and documentary evidence that the\r\n  Solicitor's office had been involved in a similar incident wherein the\r\n  Solicitor questioned a defense expert, during the sentencing portion of a\r\n  capital case, regarding a potential violation of the South Carolina psychologist\r\n  licensing statutes. Â In that case, however, the defense withdrew the motion apparently\r\n  in exchange for the State withdrawing its notice to seek the death penalty.[9]\r\nAdditionally, defense counsel\r\n  offered evidence of two other capital cases, one in 2006[10] and another in 2007[11],\r\n  where Dr. Loring testified as an expert witness in the defense's case for\r\n  mitigation.Â  The Solicitor did not challenge Dr. Loring's qualifications in\r\n  either of these cases.Â  \r\nDefense counsel then sought\r\n  to recuse the Solicitor's office as advocates and call certain members as\r\n  witnesses in order to establish the defense's claim of intentional\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct.Â  \r\nAfter the judge denied this\r\n  motion, defense counsel called attorney Desa Ballard as an expert in the field\r\n  of legal ethics and professional responsibility in South Carolina. Â Based on\r\n  her assessment of the Solicitor's conduct, Ballard opined that the Solicitor\r\n  had violated &quot;a number of rules of professional responsibility in\r\n  connection with his examination of Dr. Loring, which occurred in September of\r\n  2008.&quot;Â  In view of the prior allegation of prosecutorial misconduct,\r\n  Ballard believed the Solicitor was clearly aware that questioning Dr. Loring\r\n  regarding the potential licensing violation was &quot;improper&quot; and\r\n  constituted intimidation of a witness.Â  \r\nDefense counsel then declined\r\n  to call Dr. Loring as witness.Â  Instead, counsel renewed its motion for a\r\n  mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct. Counsel reiterated that he wished\r\n  to call the Solicitor and members of his office as witnesses because he\r\n  believed the testimony was relevant to the motion.Â  In terms of relief, counsel\r\n  sought a mistrial and, in turn, the imposition of a life without parole\r\n  sentence as the Solicitor's deliberate misconduct precipitated the mistrial\r\n  motion and, thus, implicated double jeopardy.Â  \r\nThe judge denied each of\r\n  defense counsel's motions. Â In so ruling, the judge initially rejected\r\n  counsel's argument regarding double jeopardy as the judge found the Solicitor\r\n  had not &quot;deliberately goaded&quot; the defense into requesting a mistrial.\r\n  Â As to the merits of the mistrial motion, the judge concluded the Solicitor's\r\n  questioning of Dr. Loring was inappropriate and constituted prosecutorial\r\n  misconduct.Â  However, the judge declined to grant a mistrial as he found the\r\n  evidence did not support a finding of &quot;deliberate&quot; prosecutorial\r\n  misconduct.Â  Additionally, the judge concluded that Inman had not been\r\n  prejudiced as the misconduct occurred during a bench trial as opposed to a jury\r\n  trial and Dr. Loring had voluntarily appeared at the hearing and was willing to\r\n  testify. \r\nImmediately thereafter,\r\n  defense counsel moved for a continuance in order to prepare the mitigation\r\n  evidence as he had not been in contact with Dr. Loring since the September 2008\r\n  hearing and his recently-retained social historian had not completed her\r\n  research and was not prepared to testify.Â  Â Â The judge implicitly denied this\r\n  motion.\r\nOver defense counsel's\r\n  objections, the judge called and questioned Dr. Loring as a &quot;court\r\n  witness.&quot;Â  Dr. Loring testified she compiled a social history about the\r\n  life and family of Inman by interviewing Inman and members of his family as\r\n  well as reviewing Inman's medical history, school records, and prison records.Â \r\n  Relying on these records and interviews, Dr. Loring chronicled in detail the\r\n  physical and sexual abuse that Inman endured during his childhood.Â  She further\r\n  testified as to Inman's use of drugs at an early age, his diagnosed mental\r\n  illness, his suicide attempts, and his criminal history.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Throughout the\r\n  questioning, defense counsel repeatedly sought to limit the testimony of Dr.\r\n  Loring as counsel believed her opinions implicated attorney-work product as\r\n  they had been previously discussed amongst the defense team. \r\nAfter hearing closing\r\n  arguments and Inman's personal statement, the judge sentenced Inman to death\r\n  for murder and imposed two consecutive thirty-year sentences for first-degree\r\n  burglary and first-degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  In reaching this decision,\r\n  the judge explained in both his oral and written order that the State had\r\n  proven beyond a reasonable doubt three statutory aggravating circumstances to\r\n  warrant the death penalty.[12]Â \r\n  Specifically, the judge found that Inman murdered the Victim while in the\r\n  commission of kidnapping, first-degree burglary, and first-degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct.Â  \r\nIn terms of mitigating\r\n  factors, the judge found Inman committed the murder while under the influence\r\n  of mental or emotional disturbances[13] as there was evidence that Inman suffered from long-term mental health disorders.Â \r\n  Despite these mental health disorders, the judge emphasized that these\r\n  disorders did not excuse Inman from criminal responsibility for his actions\r\n  involving the Victim.\r\nFollowing the denial of his motion\r\n  to reconsider and for a new trial, Inman appealed his plea of guilty and his\r\n  sentence of death.\r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.&nbsp;Validity of Guilty Plea\r\nInman\r\n  asserts his guilty plea to murder should be vacated on the ground it\r\n  constituted an invalid conditional guilty plea. In support of this assertion,\r\n  Inman directs this Court's attention to the portion of the plea colloquy where\r\n  the judge expressed his opinion that the preservation of the jury sentencing\r\n  issue was a decision for the Supreme Court.Â  Inman characterizes the judge's\r\n  statements as erroneous &quot;speculations about appealability.&quot;Â  Based on\r\n  these statements and defense counsel's insistence that the issue was preserved\r\n  for appeal, Inman claims the judge had a duty to reject the plea as it was\r\n  conditional.\r\n&quot;In South Carolina,\r\n  guilty pleas must be unconditional.&quot;Â  State v. Downs, 361 S.C. 141,\r\n  145, 604 S.E.2d 377, 379 (2004).Â  &quot;[I]f an accused attempts to attach any\r\n  condition or qualification thereto, the trial court should direct a plea of not\r\n  guilty.&quot;Â  State v. Truesdale, 278 S.C. 368, 370, 296 S.E.2d 528,\r\n  529 (1982).Â  &quot;If the trial court accepts a conditional guilty plea, then\r\n  the plea will be vacated on appeal.&quot;Â  Downs, 361 S.C. at 145, 604\r\n  S.E.2d at 379. Â &quot;The basis for this rule is, of course, the settled\r\n  doctrine that a guilty plea constitutes waiver of all prior claims of\r\n  constitutional rights or deprivations thereof.&quot;Â  Truesdale, 278\r\n  S.C. at 370, 296 S.E.2d at 529. \r\nTurning to the facts of the\r\n  instant case, we find that Inman's guilty plea was unconditional.Â \r\n  Significantly, Inman never attempted to reserve the right to challenge or deny the\r\n  merits of his guilt.Â  Any condition that he sought to attach to the plea\r\n  involved an appellate challenge to section 16-3-20(B), which mandates that a\r\n  judge rather than a jury determine sentencing in a capital case if the\r\n  defendant enters a guilty plea.Â  Under the mandatory appeal procedures in\r\n  capital cases,[14] Inman was permitted to appeal this secondary sentencing issue; however, any\r\n  decision as to this issue did not affect the entry or validity of his plea.Â  Cf.Â  Downs, 361 S.C. at 145-46, 604 S.E.2d at 379-80 (concluding appellant's capital\r\n  guilty plea was unconditional where he never attempted to reserve the right to\r\n  later deny his guilt, but instead sought to reserve the right to present\r\n  evidence that he committed the crime while mentally ill, an issue that involved\r\n  post-sentencing treatment). \r\nFurthermore, even if Inman\r\n  preserved his challenge to section 16-3-20(B), he specifically abandoned this\r\n  issue on appeal as he correctly recognizes that this issue has been decided\r\n  against his position.Â  See State v. Allen, 386 S.C. 93, 687\r\n  S.E.2d 21 (2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3329 (2010) (noting, in\r\n  appeal of guilty plea and capital sentence, South Carolina precedent finding\r\n  that section 16-3-20 does not violate the Sixth Amendment to the United States\r\n  Constitution and concluding that it also did not violate the Eighth and\r\n  Fourteenth Amendments; noting that the statute requires the sentencing judge to\r\n  consider any mitigating circumstances allowed by law and that a defendant is\r\n  not precluded from offering evidence of his remorse and acceptance of\r\n  responsibility); State v. Crisp, 362 S.C. 412, 608 S.E.2d 429 (2005)\r\n  (adhering to Downs and rejecting claims that section 16-3-20(B) was\r\n  unconstitutional); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 135, 607 S.E.2d 57 (2004)\r\n  (citing Downs and concluding section 16-3-20(B) was constitutional); Downs,\r\n  361 S.C. at 146, 604 S.E.2d at 380 (discussing constitutionality of section\r\n  16-3-20(B) and finding capital defendant who pleaded guilty waived his right to\r\n  jury trial on both guilt and sentencing).\r\nFinally, a review of the plea\r\n  colloquy reveals Inman entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily as he\r\n  repeatedly acknowledged that he understood the charges against him, the\r\n  consequences of his plea, and the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty,\r\n  including the right to have a jury determine his guilt and sentence.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we conclude Inman's plea was valid.Â  See Hill v.\r\n    Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56 (1985) (&quot;The\r\n  longstanding test for determining the validity of a guilty plea is 'whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent\r\n  choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.'&quot;\r\n  (quoting North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 31 (1970)); Roddy\r\n    v. State, 339 S.C. 29, 33, 528 S.E.2d 418, 421 (2000) (&quot;To find a guilty plea is\r\n  voluntarily and knowingly entered into, the record must establish the defendant\r\n  had a full understanding of the consequences of his plea and the charges\r\n  against him.&quot;).\r\nB. Sentencing Proceedings \r\nHaving found that Inman's\r\n  guilty plea was valid, we must next assess Inman's issues arising out of the\r\n  sentencing proceedings.\r\n1.&nbsp; Recusal of Solicitor's Office/Questioning Solicitor as\r\n  a Defense Witness\r\nInman claims the judge abused\r\n  his discretion by declining to recuse the Solicitor's office as advocates[15] and refusing to allow defense counsel to question the Solicitor and members of\r\n  his staff on the claim of intentional prosecutorial misconduct.Â  \r\n&quot;[A] criminal defendant\r\n  has a right to call the prosecuting attorney as a witness, subject to the trial\r\n  court's usual discretion to exclude witnesses or evidence.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 453, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000) (citing State\r\n      v. Lee, 203 S.C. 536, 28 S.E.2d 402 (1943)).Â  In Quattlebaum, this\r\n  Court emphasized that &quot;litigants, and especially defendants in criminal\r\n  cases, should not be hampered in their choice of those by whom they choose to\r\n  prove their cases.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Â However, a defendant's right to\r\n  call a prosecuting attorney as a witness is not without limitation as this\r\n  Court has stated: \r\n\r\n  Although\r\n    a prosecuting attorney is competent to testify, his testifying is not approved\r\n    by the Courts except where it is made necessary by the circumstances of\r\n    the case, and, if he knows before the trial that he will be a necessary\r\n    witness, he should withdraw and have other counsel prosecute the case.Â  The\r\n    propriety of allowing the prosecutor to testify is a matter largely within the\r\n    trial Court's discretion. \r\n\r\nLee, 203 S.C. at 540, 28 S.E.2d at 403 (emphasis added). Â Â Other\r\n  jurisdictions have agreed with this Court's limitation on a prosecutor as a\r\n  defense witness and have further clarified that the testimony &quot;must be\r\n  relevant and material to the theory of the defense . . . [and] it must not be\r\n  privileged, repetitious, or cumulative.&quot;Â  Johnson v. State, 326 A.2d\r\n  38, 45 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1974) (citing State v. Lee, 203 S.C. 536, 28\r\n  S.E.2d 402 (1943)), aff'd, 339 A.2d 289 (Md. 1975).Â  \r\nIt is evident that this Court\r\n  and courts from other jurisdictions disfavor defense counsel calling a\r\n  prosecuting attorney to testify in a case in which he is participating as an\r\n  advocate.Â  See Bennett v. Commonwealth, 374 S.E.2d 303, 313 (Va.\r\n  1988) (&quot;[I]t is not desirable for the Commonwealth's Attorney to testify\r\n  as a witness on a material point in a case.Â  The circumstances are rare indeed\r\n  where any lawyer may properly testify in a case in which he is participating as\r\n  an advocate.&quot;); see also Erwin S. Barbre, Annotation, Prosecuting\r\n    Attorney as A Witness in Criminal Case, 54 A.L.R.3d 100 (1973 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2011) (analyzing cases where the propriety of a prosecuting attorney's\r\n  testifying in a criminal case on behalf of the prosecution or on behalf of the\r\n  defendant was at issue; recognizing that such a decision is dependent upon the\r\n  facts of the case, is discretionary, and generally does not require the\r\n  prosecutor to withdraw or be recused from the case when called on behalf of the\r\n  defendant).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nHowever, even if a prosecutor\r\n  is called as a witness by the defense, it is not always necessary for a trial\r\n  judge to recuse the prosecutor or the prosecuting office in its entirety.Â  In\r\n  fact, &quot;[t]here is no inherent right to disqualification when a member of\r\n  the state attorney's office is called as a witness in a case prosecuted by a\r\n  state attorney in the same office, unless actual prejudice can be shown.&quot;Â \r\n  81 Am. Jur. 2d Witnesses Â§ 229 (2004 &amp; Supp. 2011); People v.\r\n    Superior Court of San Luis Obispo, 148 Cal. Rptr. 704, 710 (Cal. Ct. App. 5th\r\n  Dist. 1978) (&quot;The general rule is that a district attorney's office should\r\n  not be recused from a case merely because one or more of its attorneys will be\r\n  called as witnesses for the defense.&quot;).\r\nApplying the foregoing to the\r\n  facts of the instant case, we find the judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing\r\n  to recuse the Solicitor's office as advocates and declining defense counsel's\r\n  request to question the Solicitor. Â \r\nInitially, we note that the\r\n  judge's determination of prosecutorial misconduct did not necessitate the\r\n  recusal of the entire Solicitor's office as this allegation primarily involved\r\n  the Solicitor.Â  See State v. Doran, 731 P.2d 1344 (N.M. Ct. App.\r\n  1986) (finding no merit to defendant's contention that entire staff of district\r\n  attorney's office should have been disqualified where prosecutor testified at\r\n  pretrial suppression hearing that was conducted by another assistant district\r\n  attorney).\r\nFurthermore, defense\r\n  counsel's primary reason for calling the Solicitor as a witness was to\r\n  establish that he intentionally committed misconduct.Â  Because a determination\r\n  of prosecutorial misconduct is not necessarily dependent upon the intent of the\r\n  prosecutor, such testimony was neither relevant nor material to the defense's\r\n  claim.Â  See People v. Hill, 952 P.2d 673, 683-84 (Cal. 1998) (discussing\r\n  concept of prosecutorial misconduct and stating &quot;injury to appellant is\r\n  nonetheless an injury because it was committed inadvertently rather than\r\n  intentionally&quot;; recognizing that the term &quot;prosecutorial\r\n  misconduct&quot; is a misnomer to the extent it &quot;suggests a prosecutor\r\n  must act with a culpable state of mind&quot;); Diggs v. State, 531\r\n  N.E.2d 461, 464 (Ind. 1988) (&quot;A prosecutor's warning of criminal charges\r\n  during a personal interview with a witness improperly denies the defendant the\r\n  use of that witness's testimony regardless of the prosecutor's good intentions.&quot;).Â \r\n  We emphasize that a determination of a prosecutor's intent is applicable where\r\n  the prosecutor intentionally goads the defense into moving for a mistrial[16] or the prosecutor's actions implicate the attorney-client relationship.[17]Â \r\n  Neither of these situations is present in the instant case.\r\nFinally, any testimony from the\r\n  Solicitor or members of his staff would have been cumulative as defense counsel\r\n  submitted significant testimonial and documentary evidence regarding the\r\n  Solicitor's use of this tactic in prior capital cases.Â  Specifically, defense\r\n  counsel cited the Laney case and offered evidence in the form of a trial\r\n  transcript and testimony from the Public Defender that established the\r\n  Solicitor employed a line of questioning as used against Dr. Loring to a\r\n  defense expert regarding a potential violation of the South Carolina\r\n  psychologist licensing statutes.Â  Defense counsel also offered evidence that\r\n  the Solicitor, in two capital trials that preceded Inman's case, did not\r\n  challenge Dr. Loring's lack of a South Carolina license to practice social\r\n  work.Â  Based on this evidence, defense counsel was able to support its theory\r\n  that the Solicitor knew the line of questioning was objectionable and only\r\n  employed it in Inman's case after he realized that jurors in the Edens/Holloway case relied heavily on Dr. Loring's testimony in sentencing the defendants to\r\n  LWOP rather than death.Â  \r\nIn view of the foregoing, we\r\n  find the judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to recuse the\r\n  Solicitor's office and refusing to permit defense counsel to call the Solicitor\r\n  and members of his staff as witnesses.Â  See Lee, 203 S.C. at 542,\r\n  28 S.E.2d at 404 (concluding trial judge did not err in refusing to allow\r\n  defense counsel to call solicitor as witness where testimony would have been\r\n  merely cumulative); see also Cooper v. State, 847 S.W.2d 521\r\n  (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992) (holding trial court did not err in refusing to allow\r\n  defendant to call district attorney general and assistant attorney general as\r\n  witnesses on issue of State's abuse of discretion in pursuing death penalty\r\n  where defendant did not allege facts to show how his constitutional rights were\r\n  violated); Bennett v. Commonwealth, 374 S.E.2d 303 (Va. 1988)\r\n  (concluding trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's\r\n  request to question Commonwealth's attorney on witness stand concerning reasons\r\n  for which continuance had been granted and concerning possible violations of\r\n  court order).\r\n2. Witness Intimidation\r\nHaving found the judge did not abuse his\r\n  discretion in refusing to recuse the Solicitor's office as advocates and\r\n  declining to permit defense counsel to question the Solicitor and members of\r\n  his staff, we must determine whether the Solicitor's voir dire of Dr.\r\n  Loring constituted witness intimidation and, in turn, prosecutorial misconduct.\r\nInman asserts the judge erred in refusing\r\n  to grant a mistrial and recuse the Solicitor's office from any further\r\n  involvement in the case despite a finding of prosecutorial misconduct arising\r\n  out of the Solicitor's intimidation of Dr. Loring using &quot;baseless criminal\r\n  prosecution&quot; and the subpoena of Dr. Loring as a State's witness.Â  \r\nIn contrast, the State claims the judge\r\n  properly denied the motion for a mistrial and recusal of the Solicitor's\r\n  office.Â  In support of this claim, the State argues that there was no\r\n  misconduct as the voir dire was appropriate based on the applicable\r\n  South Carolina licensing statute.Â  However, even if the Solicitor committed\r\n  misconduct, the State contends it was not prejudicial to Inman as the Solicitor\r\n  granted Dr. Loring immunity from prosecution and she voluntarily testified\r\n  during the sentencing hearing.\r\n&quot;The right to offer the testimony of\r\n  witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, is in plain terms the\r\n  right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant's version of the\r\n  facts as well as the prosecution's to the jury so it may decide where the truth\r\n  lies.&quot;Â  Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967).Â  &quot;This\r\n  right is a fundamental element of due process of law.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nAs this Court has recognized, the\r\n  constitutional right of a defendant to call witnesses requires that they be\r\n  called without intimidation from the State.Â  State v. Williams, 326 S.C.\r\n  130, 485 S.E.2d 99 (1997).Â  In Williams, this Court explained:\r\n\r\n  &quot;Improper intimidation of a witness may violate a defendant's\r\n    due process right to present his defense witnesses freely if the intimidation\r\n    amounts to 'substantial government interference with a defense witness' free\r\n    and unhampered choice to testify.&quot;' . . . Where substantial interference\r\n    is found, the next issue is whether the error can be deemed harmless. Â United\r\n      States v. Saunders, supra.Â  The rule in the Fourth Circuit appears to be\r\n    that governmental intimidation can be deemed harmless error where the witness\r\n    nonetheless testifies. Compare United States v. Teague, 737 F.2d 378 (4th\r\n    Cir. 1984) (harmless where defendant was not denied either all or the helpful\r\n    part of the witness' testimony as a result of the attempted intimidation) with United\r\n      States v. MacCloskey, 682 F.2d 468 (4th Cir. 1982).Â  Under this rule, the\r\n    intimidation in this case could not be deemed harmless.Â Â  We decline, however,\r\n    to adopt such an automatic reversal rule and hold that in order to obtain\r\n    relief, a defendant must demonstrate both substantial interference and\r\n    prejudice.\r\n\r\nId. at 135, 485 S.E.2d at 102.Â  However, even\r\n  if the defendant demonstrates substantial interference and prejudice, a new\r\n  trial is not always the requisite remedy.Â  Instead, &quot;[t]he remedy to be\r\n  afforded a defendant in this situation is determined by the facts and\r\n  circumstances of each case, depending on the prejudice suffered by the\r\n  defendant.&quot;Â  Id. at 136, 485 S.E.2d at 103.\r\nIn analyzing a\r\n  claim of prosecutorial misconduct based on alleged witness intimidation, this\r\n  Court has acknowledged the prosecutor's &quot;fundamental power&quot; to\r\n  &quot;bring charges against a person the prosecutor believes has committed a\r\n  crime.&quot;Â  State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 145, 508 S.E.2d 857, 862\r\n  (1998).Â  Â This power is, nevertheless, subject to &quot;constitutional\r\n  constraints.&quot;Â  Id.Â  For example, a prosecutor may not &quot;lob\r\n  baseless threats or charges at a potential defense witness in an effort to\r\n  prevent the witness from testifying.&quot;Â  Id. at 146, 508 S.E.2d at\r\n  863; see Lisa A. Wenger, Annotation, Admonitions Against Perjury or\r\n    Threats to Prosecute Potential Defense Witness, Inducing Refusal to Testify, As\r\n    Prejudicial Error, 88 A.L.R.4th 388 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2011) (analyzing\r\n  state and federal cases where prosecutor informs defense witness that that\r\n  witness could face perjury charges or other prosecution if the witness\r\n  testified). \r\nWe find the Solicitor's conduct toward Dr.\r\n  Loring unequivocally constituted witness intimidation.Â  Even if the Solicitor\r\n  was legitimately concerned about Dr. Loring's qualifications as an expert\r\n  witness, he could have filed a motion to disqualify her, which could have been\r\n  addressed in a pre-trial hearing without the presence of Dr. Loring.Â  By\r\n  challenging Dr. Loring as soon as she took the stand, the Solicitor's method of\r\n  questioning can only be viewed as an intimidation tactic. Â The Solicitor's\r\n  claimed grant of immunity to Dr. Loring did not negate the atmosphere of\r\n  intimidation as Dr. Loring repeatedly testified that she felt threatened.\r\nSecondly, based on the testimonial and\r\n  documentary evidence the defense presented on this issue, it is clear the\r\n  Solicitor knew this line of questioning was objectionable as it had formed the\r\n  basis of a previous allegation of prosecutorial misconduct in the Laney case.Â  \r\nFurthermore, at the time of the September\r\n  2008 sentencing hearing, the Solicitor was on notice from this Court that an\r\n  out-of-state expert witness's failure to comply with South Carolina licensing\r\n  requirements did not preclude the witness from testifying. Â In fact, the Court\r\n  had specifically held on February 25, 2008 that the lack of a South Carolina\r\n  professional license was merely a factor for the judge to consider as to the\r\n  witness's qualifications as an expert.Â  Fields v. J. Haynes Waters Builders,\r\n    Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 658 S.E.2d 80 (2008) (discussing Baggerly and finding\r\n  trial judge erred in disqualifying expert witness on the basis that witness\r\n  failed to comply with South Carolina's home inspection licensing requirements,\r\n  but concluding the error was harmless); see Baggerly v. CSX Transp.,\r\n    Inc., 370 S.C. 362, 635 S.E.2d 97 (2006) (recognizing conflict between Rule\r\n  702, SCRE's qualification for experts and a statute that defined the practice\r\n  of engineering to include the offering of expert technical testimony; holding\r\n  non-compliance with licensing requirements or with statutory law in specialized\r\n  areas does not require trial judge to automatically refuse to qualify a witness\r\n  as an expert); see also RE: Act No. 385 of 2006â€”relating to defining\r\n    the &quot;practice of medicine&quot;, S.C. Sup. Ct. Order dated Aug. 24,\r\n  2006 (staying the application of amendment to section 40-47-20(36) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code and, in turn, permitting out-of-state physicians to offer\r\n  testimony without seeking a South Carolina medical license before offering the\r\n  testimony).Â  Despite this Court's clear directive, the Solicitor combatively\r\n  challenged Dr. Loring's lack of a South Carolina social worker license.Â Â  \r\nFinally, the Solicitor's decision to\r\n  subpoena Dr. Loring as a witness, after the defense severed its ties with her,\r\n  provides additional evidence of witness intimidation.Â  Although the judge\r\n  granted the State's petition to certify Dr. Loring as a material witness, the\r\n  method of procuring her appearance at the sentencing hearing supports Inman's\r\n  claim of witness intimidation.Â  We believe it was disingenuous for the\r\n  Solicitor to assert that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the State\r\n  regarding the events that took place in Georgia.Â  Based on Dr. Loring's\r\n  testimony, it was clear that she was not attempting to abscond from Georgia and\r\n  purposefully decline to appear at the sentencing hearing.Â  Thus, we find the Solicitor's\r\n  initiation of the events in Georgia went beyond a necessary course of action. Â See Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935) (&quot;[A prosecutor]\r\n  may prosecute with earnestness and vigor-indeed, he should do so.Â  But, while\r\n  he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. Â It is as\r\n  much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful\r\n  conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just\r\n  one.&quot;), overruled on other grounds by Stirone v. U.S., 361\r\n  U.S. 212 (1960). \r\nBased on the foregoing, we find there is\r\n  evidence to support the judge's finding of prosecutorial misconduct as the\r\n  Solicitor's actions were done for no other purpose than to intimidate Dr.\r\n  Loring.[18] Â Â Â Â Â \r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mistrial\r\nHaving concluded\r\n  that the Solicitor's actions constituted prosecutorial misconduct, the question\r\n  becomes whether a mistrial was warranted.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  prejudicial effect of prosecutorial misconduct is determined by (1) the\r\n  cumulative effect of such misconduct; (2) the strength of the properly admitted\r\n  evidence of the defendant's guilt; and (3) the curative actions taken by the\r\n  court.&quot;Â  United States v. Anwar, 428 F.3d 1102, 1112 (8th Cir.\r\n  2005) (citations omitted).\r\nThe decision to\r\n  grant or deny a mistrial is within\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Cooper,\r\n  334 S.C. 540, 551, 514 S.E.2d 584, 590 (1999).Â  The granting of a motion for a mistrial\r\n  is an extreme measure that should be taken only when the incident is so\r\n  grievous the prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.Â  State v.\r\n    Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 310, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999).Â Â  Â \r\nAs will be\r\n  discussed, we find the judge correctly denied defense counsel's motion for a\r\n  mistrial trial as Inman has not established prejudice sufficient to warrant\r\n  such a severe remedy.\r\nFirst, any\r\n  assessment of prejudice to Inman must be viewed from the posture of a bench\r\n  trial as opposed to a jury trial.Â  It is well-established that it is a near\r\n  insurmountable burden for a defendant to prove prejudice in the context of a\r\n  bench trial as a judge is presumed to disregard prejudicial or inadmissible\r\n  evidence.Â  See Cole v. Commonwealth, 428 S.E.2d 303, 305 (Va. Ct.\r\n  App. 1993) (&quot;A judge, unlike a juror, is uniquely suited by training,\r\n  experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial\r\n  comments and to separate, during the mental process of adjudication, the\r\n  admissible from the inadmissible, even though he has heard both.Â  Consequently,\r\n  we presume that a trial judge disregards prejudicial or inadmissible\r\n  evidence.&quot; (citations omitted)); see also People v. Jackson,\r\n  949 N.E.2d 215, 229 (Ill. App. Ct. 2011) (&quot;In a bench trial, the danger of\r\n  prejudice due to the trial judge's questions to a witness is lessened.&quot;).\r\nHere, the judge\r\n  correctly considered that Dr. Loring did not have a South Carolina social worker's\r\n  license merely as a factor in her qualifications as an expert witness.Â  Having\r\n  found Dr. Loring qualified as an expert witness, the judge properly called and\r\n  questioned her as a court's witness.Â  Because Dr. Loring testified, Inman\r\n  cannot claim he was prejudiced as his counsel declined the opportunity to\r\n  question Dr. Loring.Â  Williams, 326 S.C. at 135, 485 S.E.2d at 102\r\n  (recognizing that governmental intimidation of a witness can be deemed harmless\r\n  error where the witness nonetheless testifies).\r\nFurthermore, any\r\n  testimony that was potentially excluded was arguably cumulative to that of Dr.\r\n  Price, who testified in detail regarding Inman's childhood, his family, his\r\n  mental health disorders, and his criminal history.Â  Finally, a review of the\r\n  judge's oral and written orders establishes that he thoroughly considered all\r\n  mitigating evidence.\r\nAlthough we find\r\n  the Solicitor committed prosecutorial misconduct, we conclude Inman's sentence\r\n  of death was not imposed in violation of his due process rights.Â  See 16C C.J.S. Constitutional Law Â§ 1644 (Supp. 2011) (&quot;The touchstone\r\n  of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the\r\n  fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor.&quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to\r\n  grant a mistrial.[19]\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Proportionality Review \r\nBased on our decision to\r\n  affirm Inman's guilty plea and the judge's rulings regarding the sentencing\r\n  proceedings, we must assess Inman's sentence of death as it is this Court's\r\n  duty to conduct a proportionality review of Inman's death sentence.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003).[20]Â  \r\n&quot;The United States\r\n  Constitution prohibits the imposition of the death penalty when it is either\r\n  excessive or disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 28, 596 S.E.2d 475, 482 (2004).Â  In conducting a\r\n  proportionality review, we search for similar cases in which the sentence of\r\n  death has been upheld.Â  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(E) (2003)\r\n  (providing that in conducting a sentence review the Supreme Court &quot;shall\r\n  include in its decision a reference to those similar cases which it took into\r\n  consideration&quot;).\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude the\r\n  sentence of death was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other\r\n  arbitrary factor, and the judge's finding of three statutory aggravating\r\n  circumstances for the murder is supported by the evidence.Â  In its case, the\r\n  State presented evidence of Inman's confessions, which detailed the events of\r\n  the Victim's murder, as well as testimony from the forensic pathologist that\r\n  confirmed Inman committed the murder while in the commission of kidnapping,\r\n  first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and first-degree burglary. \r\nFurthermore, a review of\r\n  prior cases establishes that the death sentence in this case is proportionate\r\n  to that in similar cases and is neither excessive nor disproportionate to the\r\n  crime.Â  See State v. Stanko, 376 S.C. 571, 658 S.E.2d 94 (2008) (death sentence\r\n  warranted where defendant was convicted of murder, ABWIK, criminal sexual\r\n  conduct, kidnapping, and armed robbery); State v. Evins, 373 S.C.\r\n  404, 645 S.E.2d 904 (2007) (death sentence warranted\r\n  where defendant was convicted of murder, kidnapping, first-degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct, and grand larceny); State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 599\r\n  S.E.2d 448 (2004) (death sentence upheld where jury found aggravating circumstances\r\n  of criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, armed robbery, physical torture, and\r\n  burglary); State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1996) (death\r\n  sentence upheld where defendant was convicted of murder, criminal sexual\r\n  conduct, armed robbery, and grand larceny of a motor vehicle).\r\nIV. Conclusion\r\nIn conclusion, we hold Inman entered a valid guilty\r\n  plea as the entry of the plea was not conditioned on the preservation or\r\n  outcome of the jury sentencing issue.Â  Moreover, even if Inman properly\r\n  preserved this issue, he has abandoned it on appeal and this Court has repeatedly\r\n  rejected his argument.Â  As to the propriety of the sentencing proceedings, we\r\n  conclude the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Inman's requests to\r\n  recuse the Solicitor's office as advocates and to question members of the\r\n  office.Â  Although we find the Solicitor committed prosecutorial misconduct in\r\n  his treatment of Dr. Loring, we conclude that Inman was not sufficiently\r\n  prejudiced to warrant the grant of a mistrial.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs. PLEICONES,\r\n  J., concurring in a separate opinion. TOAL, C.J., and HEARN, J., concur in both\r\n  opinions.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur with the majority but write separately to\r\n  elucidate my views of State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105\r\n  (2000), to the extent they differ from those expressed by the majority.\r\nI agree with the majority\r\n  that Quattlebaum should be limited to its facts.Â  A one-size-fits-all\r\n  solution is a poor response to prosecutorial misconduct.Â  â€œThe granting of a\r\n  motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an\r\n  incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect can be removed in no other\r\n  way.â€Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 310, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999)\r\n  (citing State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998)).Â  As the\r\n  United States Supreme Court has noted, interests beyond the supervision of\r\n  prosecutorial behavior are implicated by a decision to grant a new trial.Â  United\r\n    States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 506-507 (1983).Â  Although the duty to curb\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct is compelling, other weighty concerns are also at\r\n  stake, including the need to conserve judicial resources and to avoid imposing\r\n  additional burdens on victims.Â  Id. at 509.Â  The Hasting Court\r\n  rebuked the court below for failing to â€œconsider the trauma the victims of\r\n  these particularly heinous crimes would experience in a new trial, forcing them\r\n  to relive harrowing experiences now long past, or the practical problems of\r\n  retrying these sensitive issues more than four years after the events.â€Â  Id.\r\n  at 507.Â  \r\nEven where constitutional\r\n  protections are implicated, a new trial is called for only in situations where\r\n  the defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial is fundamentally compromised.Â  Id.\r\n  at 509 (â€œ[T]he Court has consistently made clear that it is the duty of a\r\n  reviewing court to consider the trial record as a whole and to ignore errors\r\n  that are harmless, including most constitutional violations.â€).Â  This is so\r\n  because â€œthe aim of due process â€˜is not punishment of society for the misdeeds\r\n  of the prosecutor but avoidance of an unfair trial to the accused.â€™â€ Smith\r\n    v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219 (1982) (quoting Brady v. Maryland,\r\n  373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963)).Â  Likewise, I believe that we should seek to avoid a\r\n  rule unduly punishing the citizens of this State for the misdeeds of solicitors.Â \r\n  A rule that turns on whether the misconduct was intentional would have such an\r\n  effect in some cases.Â  As the Court notes parenthetically, â€œ[t]he touchstone of\r\n  due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the\r\n  fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutorâ€ (citing 16C\r\n  C.J.S. Constitutional Law Â§ 1644 (Supp. 2011)).Â  Thus, fairness should\r\n  be the touchstone of the inquiry, and only in a limited set of exceptional\r\n  circumstances should prejudice be presumed.\r\nDirect intrusion into and\r\n  eavesdropping on the defendantâ€™s confidential communications with counsel, as\r\n  occurred in Quattlebaum, is the sort of violation that is likely to\r\n  taint the entire trial, making it fundamentally unfair.Â  But this is an\r\n  exception, not the general rule.Â  As the majority clarifies, Quattlebaum did not overrule prior case law that, under different facts, mandates an\r\n  inquiry into whether the prosecutorial misconduct resulted in prejudice before\r\n  a new trial is granted.Â  \r\nWith regard to witness\r\n  intimidation, the established rule in this State is that â€œin order to obtain\r\n  relief, a defendant must demonstrate both substantial interference and\r\n  prejudice.â€Â  State v. Williams, 326 S.C. 130, 135, 485 S.E.2d 99, 102\r\n  (1997).Â  In the present case, there is no claim that any substantive mitigating\r\n  testimony was lost.Â  Indeed, there is no claim that any testimony was lost.Â \r\n  The defendantâ€™s expert witness investigated appellantâ€™s social background and\r\n  was able to testify to her opinions regarding it.Â  Appellant claims only that\r\n  the effectiveness of the expertâ€™s testimony on mitigating factors pertinent to\r\n  sentencing was diminished by the solicitorâ€™s misconduct.Â  \r\nEven assuming that the\r\n  effectiveness of the testimony was reduced by the solicitorâ€™s attempts to\r\n  intimidate the witness, the testimony was given before a judge, not a jury.Â  A\r\n  judge is presumed to weigh evidence properly.Â  See Ross v. Jones,\r\n  58 S.C. 1, 35 S.E. 402, 405-406 (1900).Â  As the majority recognizes, the record\r\n  shows that the sentencing judge was fully aware of the solicitorâ€™s conduct and\r\n  related events surrounding the expertâ€™s testimony, even finding that it was\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct.Â  We must presume that he took them into account in\r\n  considering the testimony. \r\nThe solicitorâ€™s conduct in\r\n  this case was inexplicable and reprehensible.Â  In light of the aggravated\r\n  nature of the crime and the fact that the sentencing hearing took place before\r\n  a judge, it is difficult to comprehend how the solicitor believed that\r\n  intimidating an expert witness would be more likely to ensure a death sentence\r\n  than to create a risk of reversal.Â  See United States v. Teague,\r\n  737 F.2d 378, 382 (4th Cir. 1984) (describing prosecutorsâ€™ warnings to defense\r\n  witnesses of the consequences of perjury as â€œdangerous and foolish . . .\r\n  because they can violate a defendantâ€™s due process right to present his defense\r\n  witnesses freelyâ€ and thereby risk upsetting a guilty verdict).Â  Despite the\r\n  behavior of the solicitor, I would not ascribe a uniform â€œattitudeâ€ to the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s office.Â  I would limit myself to the facts appearing in the record,\r\n  which do not implicate the entire office.Â  Moreover, I cannot assume without\r\n  more evidence that the solicitor was responsible for the manner in which\r\n  Georgia authorities handled the matter.Â  Whatever the appropriate response to\r\n  the solicitorâ€™s conduct may be, it does not include reversal.Â  \r\nThus, for the reasons set\r\n  forth above, I concur in the judgment of the majority.\r\nTOAL, C.J. and HEARN, J.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The judge did not impose a sentence for the\r\n  kidnapping charge as Inman had been sentenced for the related murder.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann.

Laney, 367 S.C. 639, 627 S.E.2d 726 (2006).Â  However,\r\n  the pertinent portions of the Laney trial transcript and defense motions\r\n  reveal the Solicitor employed an identical tactic to that used against Dr.\r\n  Loring in questioning defense counsel's expert witness, Dr. Everington, with\r\n  respect to the lack of a South Carolina psychologist license. \r\n[10] In State v. David Edens and Jennifer Holloway,\r\n  a 2006 capital trial, Dr. Loring testified as a social historian without any\r\n  objection from the Solicitor as to her qualifications or lack of a South\r\n  Carolina license to practice social work.Â  During the jury deliberations, the\r\n  jurors requested to listen to Dr. Loring's trial testimony.Â  Because the jury\r\n  could not reach a unanimous verdict as to the death penalty, the defendants\r\n  were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.Â  Weeks after the\r\n  verdict, the Solicitor requested to meet with the jurors over dinner to discuss\r\n  the verdict.Â  One juror, who attended the dinner, testified the Solicitor\r\n  appeared upset with the LWOP verdict and wanted an explanation as to why the\r\n  jurors had not voted for a death sentence.\r\n[11]Â Â  State v.

Morris, 376 S.C. 189, 200, 656 S.E.2d 359, 365 (2008) (finding\r\n  the &quot;irrebuttable presumption of prejudice&quot; found in Quattlebaum was inapplicable where Appellant had not shown prosecutorial misconduct and had\r\n  not demonstrated his prosecution was unconstitutional,\r\n  improper, or that the government pursued a civil action or investigation solely\r\n  to obtain evidence for a criminal prosecution).\r\n[18] Â We will not tolerate witness intimidation from\r\n  anyone, including the Solicitor's office.Â  Furthermore, we are deeply concerned that the Solicitor's behavior\r\n  represents a pattern of misconduct that continues to undermine our state's\r\n  system of justice. Â Specifically, this Court is concerned with the\r\n  &quot;win at all costs&quot; attitude that appears to permeate the Solicitor's\r\n  office.Â  Because the plea judge determined that the Solicitor's conduct was not\r\n  intentional, we reluctantly defer to that factual finding.Â  However, we note\r\n  that in the future such misconduct may result in disciplinary proceedings.\r\n[19]Â  In light of our decision, we\r\n  need not address Inman's related issue that the Solicitor's office should have\r\n  been recused due to a finding of prosecutorial misconduct.\r\n[20]Â  See S.C.

Â The circuit court disagreed,\r\n  and ruled that the 2004 pardon relieved Respondent from the registration\r\n  requirements of section 23-3-430, and that the 2005 and 2008 amendments did not\r\n  apply retroactively.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\nThe parties raise three\r\n  issues on appeal: \r\n I. Whether\r\n  the 2004 pardon relieved Respondent of the registration requirements of section\r\n  23-3-430 of the South Carolina Code. \r\n II. Whether\r\n  the amendments to section 23-3-430 clarified rather than changed the law requiring\r\n  pardoned sex offenders to comply with the statute's registration requirements. \r\nÂ III. Whether\r\n  the amendments to section 23-3-430 are procedural or remedial in nature, and\r\n  therefore, apply retroactively.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nA declaratory judgment action\r\n  is neither legal nor equitable, but instead its character is determined by the\r\n  nature of the underlying issue.Â  Felts v. Richland Cnty., 303 S.C. 354,\r\n  356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  The underlying issue in this case concerns\r\n  interpretation of the state sex offender registration statute.Â  Interpretation\r\n  of a legislative enactment is a question of law.Â  City of Rock Hill v.\r\n    Harris, 391 S.C. 149, 152, 705 S.E.2d 53, 54 (2011); Charleston Cnty.\r\n      Parks and Recreation Comm'n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843\r\n  (1995).Â  In a case raising a novel question of law, this Court is free to\r\n  decide the question with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  City\r\n    of Rock Hill, 391 S.C. at 152, 705 S.E.2d at 54.Â  Â Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Whether the 2004 pardon relieved Respondent of his\r\n  registration requirements.\r\nRespondent argues that the\r\n  2004 pardon relieved him of the requirement to register as a sex offender.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nSection 24-21-940(A) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code defines &quot;pardon&quot; as the circumstance when\r\n  &quot;an individual is fully pardoned from all the legal consequences of his\r\n  crime and of his conviction, direct and collateral, including the punishment,\r\n  whether of imprisonment, pecuniary penalty or whatever else the law has provided.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-940 (2007). Â When a statute's terms are clear and\r\n  unambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a\r\n  court must apply the statute according to its literal meaning.Â  Miller v.\r\n    Aiken, 364 S.C. 303, 307, 613 S.E.2d 364, 366 (2005).Â  \r\nIn State v. Baucom,\r\n  340 S.C. 339, 531 S.E.2d 922 (2000), this Court addressed the use of pardoned\r\n  convictions as an enhancement device.Â  In that case, SCDPPPS pardoned the\r\n  defendant for ten offenses, including convictions for driving under the\r\n  influence.Â  Id. at 341, 531 S.E.2d at 922.Â  \r\nFive years after the pardon, police\r\n  charged Baucom with another DUI offense, and he argued that his pardoned\r\n  offenses should not be used to enhance that charge.Â  Id. at 341-42, 531\r\n  S.E.2d at 922-23.Â  The trial court disagreed and sentenced Baucom under section\r\n  56-5-2940 of the South Carolina Code, which at the time provided: \r\n\r\n  Any\r\n    conviction, entry of plea of guilty or of nolo contendere or forfeiture of\r\n    bail, for the violation of any law or ordinance . . . that prohibits a person\r\n    from operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating\r\n    liquor, drugs, or narcotics shall constitute a prior offense for the purpose of\r\n    any prosecution for any subsequent violation hereof.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2940 (1991\r\n  &amp; Supp. 1999). \r\nThe court of appeals affirmed\r\n  the sentence, and held that the phrase &quot;any conviction&quot; necessarily\r\n  included pardoned convictions.Â  Baucom, 340 S.C. at 344, 531 S.E.2d at\r\n  924.Â  This Court disagreed, holding that punishment is only one of the consequences\r\n  absolved by a pardon under South Carolina law.Â  Id. (noting that the\r\n  individual is absolved of all consequences of his crime and conviction and that\r\n  all of his civil rights are restored).Â Â  \r\n\r\n  In the instant case, SCDPPPS pardoned Respondent in 2004.Â  Thus, in light of the\r\n  command of section 24-21-940 of the South Carolina Code, the circuit court\r\n  correctly held that the pardon relieved Respondent from all direct and\r\n  collateral consequences of his pardoned crime, which would necessarily include\r\n  placement on the sex offender registry and continuous compliance with its\r\n  registration requirements.Â  \r\nII. Whether the amendments to section 23-3-430 clarified\r\n  rather than changed the law requiring pardoned sex offenders to comply with the\r\n  statute's registration requirements.\r\nAppellant asserts that the\r\n  General Assembly's amendments to section 23-3-430 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  clarified already existing law on pardoned sex offenders rather than changing\r\n  that law.Â  We find this position without merit.Â  \r\nThe General Assembly created\r\n  the state's sex offender registry in 1994.Â  However, at the time of its\r\n  creation, the statute did not address what effect a pardon may have on a sex\r\n  offender's registration requirement.Â  In 2005, the General Assembly amended the\r\n  statute to address this issue. Â \r\nThe\r\n  newly amended statute provided: \r\n\r\n  (F) If\r\n    an offender receives a pardon for the offense for which he was required to\r\n    register, the offender may not be removed from the registry except:\r\n  (1) as\r\n    provided by the provisions of subsection (E); or \r\n  (2) if\r\n    the pardon is based on a finding of not guilty specifically stated in the\r\n    pardon. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Â§ 23-3-430(F) (2007). \r\nIn 2008, the General Assembly\r\n  amended paragraph F to add &quot;the offender must reregister as\r\n  provided by Section 23-3-460 . . . .&quot; S.C. Code Â§ 23-3-430(F) (Supp. 2010)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The statute currently provides in pertinent part, &quot;[I]f\r\n  an offender received a pardon for which he was required to register the\r\n  offender must reregister as provided by Section 23-3-460 and may not be\r\n  removed from the registry . . . .&quot; Id. (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThese amendments to section\r\n  23-3-430 occurred subsequent to the General Assembly's creation of the state's\r\n  pardon statute. Â That statute provides, &quot;[A]n individual is fully pardoned\r\n  from all the legal consequences of his crime and of his conviction, direct and\r\n  collateral, including the punishment, whether of imprisonment, pecuniary\r\n  penalty, or whatever else the law has provided.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-21-940 (2007). Â \r\nIt is clear that the General\r\n  Assembly's amendments to the sex offender registry statute changed rather than\r\n  clarified the law.Â  The statute was silent regarding pardons at its creation in\r\n  1994.Â  In 2004, the General Assembly mandated, via section 24-21-940, that a\r\n  pardon relieved an individual of all criminal and civil penalties accompanying\r\n  her crime.Â  In 2005 and 2008, the General Assembly ensured that the broad\r\n  application of the pardon statute would not relieve sex offenders of their\r\n  registration obligation.Â Â  \r\nThe State relies on Stuckey\r\n  v. State Budget and Control Bd., 339 S.C. 397, 529 S.E.2d 706 (2000), in\r\n  support of its position that the General Assembly's amendments clarify the\r\n  legislature's original intent that, with only limited exceptions, even those\r\n  with pardons should be required to register.Â  In Stuckey, Appellant\r\n  began employment as a public school teacher in August 1972 and was enrolled in\r\n  the state retirement plan until she terminated her employment in June 1973.Â \r\n  Appellant attended law school full-time from August 1973 to May 1976, and in\r\n  October 1976 she began employment with the State Department of Education.Â  In\r\n  May 1995, Appellant filed a request with the South Carolina Retirement Systems\r\n  (Agency) for two years retroactive educational leave pursuant to section 9-1-1140\r\n  of the South Carolina Code, which at the time provided, &quot;[A] member who\r\n  leaves employment to attend graduate school and returns directly to employment\r\n  may establish up to two years' retirement credit by paying the actuarial cost\r\n  as determined by the [State Budget and Control] Board.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  9-1-1140 (1986).\r\nAgency denied Appellant's\r\n  request because she had not returned directly to covered employment.Â  Agency\r\n  interpreted &quot;directly&quot; to mean &quot;immediately&quot; but allowed\r\n  for a grace period of ninety days in order to accommodate teachers who had an\r\n  annual three month lapse in employment.Â  Stuckey, 339 S.C. at 400-01,\r\n  529 S.E.2d at 707.Â  This Court found that the General Assembly's amendment to section\r\n  9-1-1140 shed light on the legislature's intent.Â  Id. at 401, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  at 708.Â  After Appellant filed her claim, the General Assembly amended the\r\n  statute to provide, &quot;[A] member who leaves covered employment to attend\r\n  undergraduate or graduate school and returns to covered employment within\r\n    ninety days after the member's last date of enrollment may establish up to\r\n  two years' retirement credit by paying the actuarial costs as determined by the\r\n  board.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 9-1-1140 (Supp. 1997))\r\n  (emphasis added). \r\nThis Court found the\r\n  subsequent statutory amendment clarified original legislative intent.Â  Id. at\r\n  401, 529 S.E.2d at 708.Â  However, the statute creating the sex offender\r\n  registry did not speak to the issue of pardons, and thus, there was no language\r\n  for the subsequent amendments to clarify.Â  Thus, the facts and analysis of Stuckey are inapplicable to the amendments of section 23-3-430 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code.Â  \r\nThe purpose of the amendment\r\n  evinces the legislature's intent to except the sex offender registry\r\n  requirements from the broad relief afforded by the pardon statute, and no\r\n  evidence can be shown of a previous legislative intent that would require\r\n  clarification.Â  As such, we find Appellant's position is without merit.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Whether the amendments to section 23-3-430 are\r\n  procedural or remedial in nature.\r\nAppellant argues that the\r\n  amendments to section 23-3-430 of the South Carolina Code are procedural and\r\n  remedial in nature, and thus apply retroactively to Respondent's case.Â  It is a\r\n  well-settled rule of statutory construction that absent a specific provision or\r\n  clear legislative intent to the contrary, statutes are to be construed prospectively\r\n  rather than retroactively, unless the statute is remedial or procedural in\r\n  nature.Â  S.C. Dept. of Revenue v. Rosemary Coin Machs., Inc., 339\r\n  S.C. 25, 28, 528 S.E.2d 416, 418 (2000); Bartley v. Bartley Logging Co.,\r\n  293 S.C. 88, 90, 359 S.E.2d 55, 56 (1987).Â  The General Assembly did not\r\n  explicitly provide that the amendments to section 23-3-430 apply\r\n  retroactively.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430 (Supp. 2010).Â  Therefore,\r\n  the amendments may only apply to Respondent's case if this Court finds them to be\r\n  remedial or procedural.Â  \r\nA. Remedial\r\nA statute is remedial where\r\n  it creates new remedies for existing rights or enlarges the rights of persons\r\n  under disability.Â  Smith v. Eagle Constr. Co., 282 S.C. 140, 143, 318\r\n  S.E.2d 8, 9 (1984).Â  When a statute creates a new obligation or imposes a new\r\n  duty, courts generally consider the statute prospective only.Â  82 C.J.S.\r\n  Statutes Â§ 585 (2009).Â  \r\nThe State argues that the\r\n  amendments are remedial because &quot;the amendment enlarges the remedy\r\n  provided to law enforcement to gather information about sex offenders.&quot; However,\r\n  under this analysis, any law that expanded the police power could be considered\r\n  retroactive because of the enlarged &quot;remedy&quot; given to the State in executing\r\n  its responsibilities.Â  Moreover, the amendments to section 23-3-430 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code do not create a new right, but instead impose an obligation\r\n  which did not exist prior to the amendments.Â  The statute did not prevent\r\n  Respondent's removal from the sex offender registry at the time of his pardon.Â \r\n  However, the statute's amendments, if applied retroactively, would require\r\n  Respondent to remain on the sex offender registry.Â Â  \r\nThe balance of authority on\r\n  this subject weighs against this Court adopting the State's definition of\r\n  remedial. Hercules, Inc. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 274 S.C. 137, 143, 262\r\n  S.E.2d 45, 48 (1980) (holding that statutes affecting the remedy, not the right,\r\n  are generally retrospective); Kneisley v. Lattimer-Stevens Co., 533\r\n  N.E.2d 743, 745 (Ohio 1988) (finding a statute &quot;substantive&quot; instead\r\n  of &quot;remedial&quot; where it imposed new or additional burdens, duties,\r\n  obligations or liabilities as to past transaction); Weisart v. Stewart,\r\n  379 S.C. 300, 303 665 S.E.2d 187, 188 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding that a statute\r\n  is remedial and applies retroactively when it creates new remedies for existing\r\n  rights or enlarges rights of persons under disability); 82 C.J.S. Statutes Â§\r\n  585 (2009) (explaining that where a statute takes away or impairs vested rights\r\n  acquired under existing laws, creates new obligations, imposes a new duty, or\r\n  attaches a new disability, it will be construed as prospective only).\r\nB.&nbsp;Procedural\r\nThe State argues that the\r\n  2008 amendment is procedural because it sets forth the circumstances in which\r\n  an individual with a pardon is required to register as a sex offender.Â \r\n  However, a &quot;procedural&quot; law sets out a mode of procedure for a court\r\n  to follow, or &quot;prescribes a method of enforcing rights.&quot;Â  Black's Law\r\n  Dictionary 1083 (1979).Â  Moreover, a statute that limits a right is generally\r\n  not procedural.Â  Merchants Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 277\r\n  S.C. 604, 608, 291 S.E.2d 667, 669 (1982). \r\nIn Wiesart v. Stewart,\r\n  the court of appeals addressed whether amendments to the sex offender registry\r\n  statute were remedial or procedural.Â  379 S.C. 300, 665 S.E.2d 187 (Ct. App. 2009).Â \r\n  In 1979, a Maryland court convicted Wiesart of indecent exposure, and in 1995 he\r\n  pled guilty in Horry County to a controlled substance offense.Â  Id. at\r\n  302, 665 S.E.2d at 188.Â  Wiesart received probation, and his probation agent\r\n  informed him that he would have to register as a sex offender because of his\r\n  prior indecent exposure conviction.Â  Id. at 302, 665 S.E.2d at 188.Â \r\n  Prior to 1996, section 23-3-430 of the South Carolina Code required any person\r\n  convicted of indecent exposure to register annually as a sex offender.Â  Id.\r\n  Â In 1996, the General Assembly amended the statute to include a person\r\n  convicted of indecent exposure only &quot;if the court makes a specific finding\r\n  on the record based on the circumstances of the case the convicted person\r\n  should register as a sex offender.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nWiesart brought a declaratory\r\n  judgment action asserting that he was entitled to a hearing on the issue of\r\n  whether he was required to register as a sex offender.Â  Id.Â  The circuit\r\n  court ruled that the statute was not retroactive.Â  Wiesart, 379 S.C. at\r\n  302, 665 S.E.2d at 188.Â  The court of appeals disagreed finding that the\r\n  amendment was procedural because it set a mode of procedure for the trial court\r\n  to follow.Â  Id. at 303, 665 S.E.2d at 188.Â  \r\nIn State v. Frey, 362\r\n  S.C. 511, 608 S.E.2d 874 (Ct. App. 2005), the court of appeals reviewed a circuit\r\n  court's decision to admit evidence of blood-alcohol analysis test results.Â  Id. at 515, 608 S.E.2d at 877.Â  Frey objected, arguing that the State did not\r\n  present evidence that the blood sample was drawn by a qualified individual as\r\n  required by the implied consent statute.Â  Id. at 517-18, 608 S.E.2d at\r\n  877-88. Â The State countered that even if Frey's assertion was correct,\r\n  suppression would not be warranted because Frey was not prejudiced by the\r\n  failure to comply with the statute.Â  Id. at 518, 608 S.E.2d at 878.Â  The\r\n  General Assembly revised the statute shortly after Frey's trial by adding\r\n  subsection (e):Â  \r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    failure to follow any of these policies, procedures, and regulations, or the\r\n    provisions of this section, shall result in the exclusion from evidence any\r\n    test results, if the trial judge or hearing officer finds that such\r\n    failure materially affected the accuracy or reliability of the tests results or\r\n    the fairness of the testing procedure.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(e)\r\n  (2006) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe court of appeals noted\r\n  that although the revision above became effective shortly after the trial of\r\n  the case, the revision addressed procedural rather than substantive rights, and\r\n  was therefore retroactive.Â  Frey, 362 S.C. at 518 n.3, 608 S.E.2d at 878\r\n  n.3.Â  The court of appeals found that the State failed to establish that Frey's\r\n  blood sample was obtained in accordance with the statute.Â  Id. at 519,\r\n  608 S.E.2d at 879.Â Â  Thus, the court remanded the case to the circuit court for\r\n  a determination of whether &quot;such failure materially affected the accuracy\r\n  or reliability of the test results or the fairness of the testing\r\n  procedure.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nThe amendments to section\r\n  23-3-430 do not provide a procedure for a court to follow, or prescribe a\r\n  method for enforcing rights.Â  Thus, the amendments are not procedural and\r\n  cannot be applied retroactively to Respondent's case.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRespondent's 2004 pardon\r\n  relieved him of all consequences of his conviction for the foregoing reasons.Â \r\n  The General Assembly's 2005 and 2008 amendments to section 23-3-430 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code cannot be applied retroactively to Respondent's case.Â \r\n  Thus, we affirm the circuit court's order relieving Respondent of the requirement\r\n  to register as a sex offender.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent claimed that while walking from a parking lot to his apartment he\r\n  passed the open window of a female resident's apartment, and looked inside.Â  A\r\n  neighbor observed Respondent and reported the incident.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27083","title":"Doe v.

The\r\n  Administrative Law Court (ALC) affirmed this legal determination, as well as\r\n  the Hearing Officer's factual findings.Â  Because the decision of the Hearing\r\n  Officer and ALC is controlled by an error of law, we reverse and remand.Â  \r\nI.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nA.\r\nMedicaid is a program through\r\n  which the federal government, through the Social Security Administration (SSA),\r\n  provides financial assistance to states so that they may furnish medical care\r\n  to needy individuals.Â  Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Assoc., 496 U.S. 498,\r\n  502 (1990).Â  Participation in the program is voluntary; however, participating states\r\n  must comply with requirements imposed by the Medicaid Act and related regulations.\r\n  Â Id.Â  To receive federal funding, a state must submit and have approved\r\n  a &quot;plan for medical assistance&quot; that describes the nature and scope\r\n  of the state's Medicaid\r\n  program.Â  Id.Â  A state's plan must provide medical services for the\r\n  &quot;categorically needy&quot; and, among other things, must provide services\r\n  under any option to all Medicaid beneficiaries for whom they are medically\r\n  necessary.Â  See 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1396a(a)(1), (a)(10)(A)(i), (a)(10)(B)\r\n  (2006); Pharm. Research\r\n    &amp; Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh,\r\n  538 U.S. 644, 651 n.4 (2003).\r\nSupplemental\r\n  Security Income (SSI), which is Title XVI of the Social Security Act, provides\r\n  support for those who are aged, blind, or disabled and subsist on a limited\r\n  income.Â  20 C.F.R. Â§ 416.1100 (2011).Â  To receive SSI, a recipient must have a\r\n  disability such that he cannot accomplish &quot;substantial gainful\r\n  activity&quot; for profit.Â  20 C.F.R. Â§ 416.905 (2011).Â  Federal\r\n  regulations provide that an individual found eligible for SSI is automatically\r\n  enrolled in the Medicaid program and is entitled to the base level of benefits\r\n  the state must provide to all Medicaid beneficiaries.Â  42 U.S.C. Â§ 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(II) (2006); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 435.909(b)(1) (2010); Pharm. Research, 538 U.S. at 651 n.4.\r\nSince 1981,\r\n  Medicaid has provided funding for state-run home and community based services\r\n  (&quot;HCBS&quot;) through a waiver program.Â  For Medicaid-eligible individuals\r\n  whose medical needs require an institutional level of care, the waiver program\r\n  provides Medicaid funding to States to provide those individuals HCBS in lieu\r\n  of institutional care.[2]Â \r\n  42 U.S.C. Â§ 1396n(c) (2006); 42 C.F.R. Â§ 441.300 (2010); see Olmstead\r\n    v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 601 (1999).Â  The waiver program permits an eligible recipient who is mentally\r\n  retarded to receive Medicaid-funded HCBS, rather than institutional care in an\r\n  Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR).Â  Once an\r\n  individual is found eligible for such&nbsp;waiver services, a state must\r\n  conduct periodic reviews to ensure the recipient still meets the waiver program\r\n  eligibility requirements. Â 42 C.F.R. Â§ 441.302(c)(2)\r\n  (2010).\r\nFor purposes of basic\r\n  Medicaid eligibility, the\r\n  definition for mental retardation, in relevant part, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Mental\r\n    retardation refers to significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\r\n    with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the\r\n      developmental period; i.e., the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of\r\n      impairment before age 22.\r\n\r\n20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P,\r\n  App. 1 Â§ 12.05 (2011) (emphasis added).[3]Â  \r\nB.\r\nFor a state to\r\n  participate in the Medicaid HCBS waiver program, it must submit a detailed application\r\n  on a form provided by the federal government describing the group of\r\n  individuals to whom the services will be offered.Â  42 C.F.R. Â§ 441.301(b)(3)(2010).Â \r\n  For the purpose of defining eligibility for waiver services, a state is free to\r\n  impose in its waiver application eligibility criteria which are more\r\n  restrictive than basic Medicaid eligibility requirements.Â  42 C.F.R. Â§\r\n  441.301(b)(6) (2010).Â  \r\nBased on South\r\n  Carolina's waiver application, to continue to be eligible to receive HCBS\r\n  waiver services, a person must meet the following criteria: \r\n\r\n  1. The person has a\r\n    confirmed diagnosis of mental retardation or a related disability. \r\n  AND \r\n  2.&nbsp; The person's needs are\r\n    such that supervision is necessary due to at least one of the following:\r\n    impaired judgment, limited capabilities, behavior problems, abusiveness,\r\n    assaultiveness or because of drug effects/medical monitorship.\r\n  AND\r\n  3.&nbsp;The person is in need\r\n    of services directed toward a) the acquisition of the behaviors necessary to\r\n    function with as much self-determination and independence as possible; or b)\r\n    the prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current optimal\r\n    functional status.\r\n\r\nAttachment 1 to\r\n  Appendix D-3, South Carolina's Mental Retardation/Related Disabilities (MR/RD)\r\n  Waiver Document (Effective October 1, 2004-September 30, 2009).\r\nThe second and\r\n  third eligibility criteria are commonly referred to collectively as &quot;Level\r\n  of Care.&quot;Â  These criteria describe the minimum services and functional\r\n  deficits necessary to qualify for Medicaid-sponsored institutional care in an\r\n  ICF/MR.Â  South Carolina's waiver application provides that Level of Care\r\n  reevaluations will take place at least every twelve months.[4]Â  Appendix D-2, South Carolina's\r\n  Mental Retardation/Related Disabilities (MR/RD) Waiver Document (Effective\r\n  October 1, 2004-September 30, 2009).Â  South\r\n  Carolina's waiver application with the federal government does not include any\r\n  age-of-onset requirement and reveals no intent to vary from or otherwise limit\r\n  the group of individuals encompassed by the SSI definition of mental\r\n  retardation.Â  On the waiver application in effect in 2005, South Carolina\r\n  checked letter &quot;f,&quot; thereby expressing its intent to provide waiver\r\n  services to the group identified as &quot;mentally retarded persons and persons\r\n  with related disabilities.&quot;Â  In addition, where asked whether it would\r\n  impose any &quot;addition[al] targeting restrictions&quot; on the provision of\r\n  waiver services, South Carolina stated &quot;Not applicable.&quot;Â  \r\nIn 1990, the South Carolina General\r\n  Assembly adopted a definition of mental retardation that parallels the SSI\r\n  definition adopted by the federal government in 1985.Â  See Act. No. 496,\r\n  1990 S.C. Acts 2184, 2187; 50 Fed. Reg. 35038, 35068-69 (Aug. 28, 1985).Â  The definition,\r\n  codified at South Carolina Code section 44-20-30, states that mental\r\n  retardation is &quot;significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\r\n  existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during\r\n  the developmental period.&quot;[5]Â \r\n  The term &quot;developmental period&quot; was new to the 1990 definition, and\r\n  it is upon the construction of that term that this matter largely turns.Â  \r\nDDSN promulgated a regulation\r\n  which recites the SSI/44-20-30 definition of mental retardation (with only\r\n  minor changes in phrasing) and defined the term &quot;developmental\r\n  period&quot; as the period from conception to age twenty-two, consistent with\r\n  the SSI definition.[6]Â \r\n  26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 88-210(F) (Supp. 2010). Â Thus the definition of mental\r\n  retardation under state lawâ€”Regulation 88-210(F)â€”mirrors the SSI definition\r\n  with respect to the age-of-onset requirement. Â No South Carolina regulation\r\n  imposes additional diagnostic criteria for mental retardation in the context of\r\n  waiver services.Â  Nevertheless, DDSN attempted through a &quot;Policy of\r\n  Determination of Eligibility&quot; to impose more restrictive diagnostic\r\n  criteria for mental retardation for eligibility for waiver services in the form of an age-eighteen-onset\r\n  requirement for mental retardation.Â  The policy states:\r\n\r\n  DDSN evaluates referred individuals in\r\n    accordance with the definitions of Mental Retardation outlined in the\r\n      American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\r\n        Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition (DSM-IV, 1994) and the American Association\r\n          on Mental Retardation (AAMR 9th Edition, 1992). \r\n  Mental Retardation refers to substantial\r\n    limitations in present functioning. Diagnosis of mental retardation based on\r\n      the DSM-IV and AAMR definitions requires the following three criteria be\r\n    met: \r\n  . . . .\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The onset of mental retardation\r\n    is before age 18 years.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina\r\n  Dep't of Disabilities and Special Needs Policy for Determination of Eligibility\r\n  Guidelines to Operationalize Eligibility Policy (Effective July 1, 1998)\r\n  (emphasis added).[7]\r\nÂ II. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nJane Doe was born\r\n  on March 24, 1983, the product of an indisputably complicated birth.Â  She was\r\n  born at thirty weeks gestation, weighing just two pounds, three ounces.Â  At ten\r\n  months old, she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and her doctors diagnosed\r\n  her with a seizure disorder at age eleven.Â  As a result of her conditions, she\r\n  has limited use of her left hand, difficulty with balance, and an awkward\r\n  gait.Â  Additionally, Doe presents with other physical and emotional conditions,\r\n  including the nerve disorder Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, anxiety, depression,\r\n  and anger management problems.\r\nIn 2001, Doe\r\n  applied for SSI benefits from the SSA.Â  The psychological evaluation submitted\r\n  to the SSA showed her Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) to be sixty-nine,\r\n  Verbal IQ to be seventy-seven, and Performance IQ to be sixty-five.Â  Using\r\n  these scores and personal observations of Doe's functional abilities, the\r\n  doctor examining her concluded &quot;[s]he has multiple physical, mental, and\r\n  emotional impairments, including cerebral palsy with left spastic hemiparesis\r\n  and Mild Mental Retardation.&quot;Â  The SSA awarded Doe SSI based on a primary\r\n  diagnosis of mental retardation and a secondary diagnosis of cerebral palsy.Â \r\n  That determination has never been challenged.[8]Â \r\n  Respondent South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its\r\n  agent, DDSN, sought reimbursement from the federal government for\r\n  services they supplied using the diagnostic code for mental retardation.\r\nDoe is\r\n  unquestionably disabled.Â  Looking to her IQ scores beginning at age twelve,\r\n  Doe's full-scale IQ scores ranged from a low of sixty-six to a high of\r\n  seventy-three.Â Â  \r\nDDSN approved Doe's\r\n  application for waiver services in March 2003, and provided her with HCBS. Â Because\r\n  Doe's parents were unable to care\r\n  for her at home, DDSN placed Doe in a Community Training Home II (CTH II) facility operated by the Newberry\r\n  County Disabilities and Special Needs Board.[9]Â  \r\nIn 2005, DDSN\r\n  re-evaluated and terminated Doe's eligibility for waiver services.Â  Doe contended her benefits should not be terminated\r\n  and requested a fair hearing to review that decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§\r\n  1396a(a)(3) (2006) and section 126-380 of the South Carolina Code of\r\n  Regulations.Â  Relying on DDSN's definition of mental retardation in its policy\r\n  guidelines that the onset of mental retardation must occur prior to age\r\n  eighteen, the Hearing Officer referenced &quot;accepted psychological\r\n  doctrine&quot; and concluded Doe was not mentally retarded.[10]Â \r\n  Finding the absence of mental retardation (and related disability) dispositive,\r\n  the Hearing Officer did not reach the issue of whether Doe met the Level of\r\n  Care requirements for waiver services eligibility.Â  The ALC affirmed the Hearing\r\n  Officer.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nIII.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOur standard of review is\r\n  governed by the Administrative Procedures Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  The Court may affirm the agency's decision, remand the matter,\r\n  or reverse or modify it \r\nif\r\n  substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the\r\n  administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:\r\n\r\n  (a) Â in violation of constitutional or statutory\r\n    provisions;\r\n  (b) in excess of\r\n    the statutory authority granted of the agency;\r\n  (c) Â made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n  (d) affected by\r\n    other error of law;\r\n  (e) Â clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,\r\n    and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n  (f)&nbsp; Â arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of\r\n    discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nId.Â  We reverse because the decisions of the Hearing\r\n  Officer and ALC are controlled by an error of law.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.\r\nIt is Doe's\r\n  position that the SSA determination of disability and receipt of basic Medicaid\r\n  through SSI is binding on DDSN's\r\n  determination of whether she is entitled to\r\n  receive waiver services.Â  In the alternative, Doe argues it was error to impose\r\n  an age-eighteen-onset requirement in determining whether she is mentally\r\n  retarded and that DDSN must use the age-twenty-two-onset definition of mental\r\n  retardation.Â  \r\nWe disagree that, in the\r\n  context of waiver services, DDSN is bound by the SSA's determination that Doe is disabled, for Doe conflates her entitlement to basic Medicaid services\r\n  by virtue of her SSI disability with the issue of whether she is eligible to\r\n  receive HCBS through the optional Medicaid waiver program.Â  The federal\r\n  government has made it manifestly clear that states have wide discretion in\r\n  designing a waiver program that is tailored to the needs of the particular\r\n  state.Â  For example, in the &quot;Application for a Â§1915(c) Home\r\n  and Community-Based Services Waiver&quot; promulgated by the Centers for\r\n  Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the purpose of the HCBS Waiver Program is as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver program is authorized\r\n    in Â§ 1915(c) of the Social Security Act.Â  The program permits a State to\r\n    furnish an array of home and community-based services that assist Medicaid\r\n    beneficiaries to live in the community and avoid institutionalization.Â  The\r\n    State has broad discretion to design its waiver program to address the needs of\r\n    the waiver's target\r\n    population.Â  Waiver services complement and/or supplement the services that are\r\n    available to participants through the Medicaid State plan and other federal,\r\n    state and local public programs as well as the supports that families and\r\n    communities provide.\r\n  The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) recognize[]\r\n    that the design and operational features of a waiver program will vary\r\n    depending on the specific needs of the target population, the resources\r\n    available to the State, service delivery system structure, State goals and\r\n    objectives, and other factors.Â  A State has the latitude to design a waiver\r\n    program that is cost-effective and employs a variety of service delivery\r\n    approaches, including participant direction of services.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is clear that\r\n  states may impose additional criteria to the SSI definition of mental\r\n  retardation for the purposes of waiver services eligibility, and the SSI's prior determination of Doe as mentally retarded is not binding on the state's waiver\r\n  services eligibility determination\r\n  of whether Doe is mentally retarded.\r\nB.\r\nAlthough we reject Doe's initial\r\n  argument, we do agree with her contention that it was error to impose an age-eighteen-onset\r\n  requirement in determining whether she is mentally retarded.Â  South Carolina's waiver application allows it to do\r\n  one very specific thing: substitute home or community based services (HCBS) for\r\n  mandatory Medicaid services with respect to a defined subset of categorically\r\n  needy persons, without providing HCBS to every categorically needy person in\r\n  the State.Â  42 C.F.R. Â§ 440.240(b) (2010) (&quot;The [State] plan must provide\r\n  that the services available to any individual in the following groups are equal\r\n  in amount, duration, and scope for all recipients within the group: (1) The\r\n  categorically needy . . . .&quot;); id. Â§ 440.250(k) (&quot;[T]he\r\n  services provided under [a] waiver [of Â§ 440.240] need not be comparable for\r\n  all individuals within a group.&quot;); id. Â§ 441.301(b)(6) (requiring a\r\n  waiver request to &quot;[b]e limited to one of the . . . target groups or any\r\n  subgroup thereof&quot; and defining the target groups as the aged, disabled,\r\n  mentally retarded, developmentally disabled, and mentally ill).Â  Thus, the scope of HCBS furnished under the waiver\r\n  program and recipient eligibility criteria are defined by the waiver application.Â  However, South Carolina's waiver application with the federal\r\n  government does not include any age-of-onset requirement.Â  Â Â \r\nTo the extent a state is\r\n  permitted to issue regulations interpreting the general eligibility\r\n  requirements included in its waiver application, South Carolina regulations\r\n  reveal no intent to vary from the requirement that the onset of mental\r\n  retardation occur prior to age twenty-two.Â  Rather, the only regulation\r\n  addressing eligibility for HCBS states that HCBS &quot;may be provided to\r\n  Medicaid eligible persons eighteen years of age or older, who have been\r\n  determined by community long term care to require a skilled or intermediate\r\n  level of care.&quot;Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 126-304 (1976).Â  No South\r\n  Carolina regulation imposes additional diagnostic criteria for mental\r\n  retardation in the context of waiver services. \r\nMoreover, we find DDSN's policy guidelines are not entitled to\r\n  any deference in this regard.Â  The scope\r\n  of DDSN's rulemaking authority is defined by the South Carolina General Assembly,\r\n  and DDSN may exercise such authority only in that manner.Â  As discussed above,\r\n  in 1990, the General Assembly adopted a definition of mental retardation in\r\n  line with the SSI definition adopted by the federal government in 1985.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  DDSN promulgated regulation 88-210(F), which recites the SSI/44-20-30\r\n  definition of mental retardation and defines the term &quot;developmental\r\n  period&quot; as the period from conception to age twenty-two, consistent with\r\n  the SSI definition.[11]Â  Thus, the informal agency policy issued by DDSN, purporting to\r\n  implement an age-eighteen-onset requirement should be disregarded in\r\n  determining what classes of mentally retarded South Carolinians are entitled to\r\n  Medicaid waiver services because it lacks the force and effect of law and is in\r\n  direct conflict with Regulation 88-210(F), which defines the developmental\r\n  period as extending to age twenty-two.Â  Â \r\nV. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, it is clear that\r\n  South Carolina could have listed additional criteria in the waiver\r\n  application for the purpose of defining the population to whom it would provide\r\n  waiver services.Â  Likewise, DDSN could have promulgated regulations\r\n  incorporating those additional criteria as part of the definition of mental\r\n  retardation.Â  But no such steps were taken.Â  Rather, South Carolina adopted a\r\n  broad definition of mental retardation in section 44-20-30, using language that\r\n  parallels the SSI definition, and in Regulation 88-210, DDSN interpreted that\r\n  definition in a manner consistent with the SSA.Â  DDSN's interpretation of section 44-20-30 in its policy guidelines directly conflicts\r\n  with Regulation 88-210 and should be disregarded.\r\nWe find the Hearing Officer and\r\n  ALC erred in applying an age-eighteen-onset requirement for mental retardation.Â  We reverse and remand for consideration of whether,\r\n  applying the proper legal standard for mental retardation (onset prior to age\r\n  twenty-two), Doe is eligible to continue to receive waiver services. \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J. and BEATTY, J.,\r\n  concur.Â  HEARN, J. concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate\r\n  opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN: Respectfully, I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I\r\n  agree with the majority's holding that South Carolina can impose more\r\n  restrictive criteria for mental retardation in its waiver application or in a\r\n  regulation.Â  Where I part company with the majority, however, is with respect\r\n  to whether Regulation 88-210(F) applies in this case.Â  Because I do not believe\r\n  it does, I would find this absence of controlling statutory or regulatory\r\n  criteria permitted DDSN to apply its own diagnostic criteria to Doe and would\r\n  affirm.\r\nI.\r\nAs the majority correctly\r\n  notes, the starting point for our analysis is the waiver application itself.Â \r\n  Although many states elected to supply a wide range of specific diagnostic\r\n  criteria in their applications,[12] South Carolina has not done so.[13]Â \r\n  Similarly, Section 44-20-30(11) of the South Carolina Code (2002) simply\r\n  defines mental retardation as &quot;significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing\r\n  concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the\r\n  developmental period.&quot;Â  Due to this lack of guidance, in 1998 DDSN itself\r\n  adopted the criteria from the DSM-IV and the American Association on Mental\r\n  Retardation, Ninth Edition, defining mental retardation as: (1) an IQ of\r\n  approximately seventy or below; (2) a score of approximately seventy or below\r\n  on standardized measures of adaptive behavior; and (3) onset before the age of\r\n  eighteen.Â  These guidelines have not been promulgated into an official\r\n  regulation.\r\nSection 88-210(F) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code of Regulations differs from DDSN's guidelines in that\r\n  it extends the developmental period to the individual's twenty-second birthday. See 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 88-210(F) (2009). The majority accordingly\r\n  posits that Regulation 88-210(F) conflicts with, and thus trumps, DDSN's\r\n  guidelines as to the developmental period.Â  However, the regulatory definition\r\n  of &quot;developmental period&quot; by its terms applies only to the\r\n  regulations in question, see id. Â§ 88-210, which concern the licensing\r\n  of various facilities by DDSN and not eligibility for waiver services, see\r\n    id. Â§ 88-105. Â The majority thus states correctly that the scope of this\r\n  regulation is &quot;the licensing of all programs&quot; for the\r\n  treatment of the mentally retarded, even if those facilities provide waiver\r\n  services.Â  However, two unitalicized words are of particular import yet\r\n  side-stepped by the majority: &quot;licensing&quot; and &quot;programs.&quot;Â Â \r\n  Just as with statutes, we apply the plain meaning of regulations &quot;without\r\n  resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the regulation's\r\n  operation.&quot; Byerly v. Connor, 307 S.C. 441, 444, 415 S.E.2d 796,\r\n  799 (1992).Â  Because Regulation 88-210(F) plainly applies only to the licensing\r\n  of programs and not eligibility for services, it has no application in the case\r\n  before us.Â  As the majority itself recognizes, the only regulation\r\n  concerning eligibility for waiver services provides no guidance as to what\r\n  constitutes mental retardation. See 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 126-304(A)\r\n  (1976) (&quot;Home and community based services may be provided to Medicaid\r\n  eligible persons eighteen years of age or older, who have been determined by\r\n  community long term care to require a skilled or intermediate level of\r\n  care.&quot;).Â Â  The policy guidelines at issue here clearly are not at odds\r\n  with this regulation, nor do they conflict with Regulation 88-210(F) as they do\r\n  not concern the licensing of programs.\r\nIn support of its\r\n  conclusion that the regulation applies, the majority details the history of\r\n  Regulation 88-210 and section 44-20-30 to conclude that Regulation 88-210(F)\r\n  actually is an interpretation of section 44-20-30(11).Â  When this regulation\r\n  was passed, the licensing provisions were contained in Article 3 of Chapter 21,\r\n  and that chapter and article were (and still are) cited as the sole authority\r\n  for it.Â  The majority then points out that these provisions were subsequently\r\n  moved to Article 5 of Chapter 20 at the time the General Assembly added the\r\n  undefined term &quot;developmental period&quot; to the definition of mental\r\n  retardation found in the general provisions of Article 1 of Chapter 20.Â  In my\r\n  opinion, importing the specific licensing definition of developmental period\r\n  into the general provisions solely based on this renumbering of the statutes\r\n  lets the tail wag the dog, and I accordingly decline to divine any expansion of\r\n  the regulation's scope. Â The majority therefore &quot;resort[s] to subtle . . .\r\n  construction to . . . expand&quot; the regulation's operation. See Byerly,\r\n  307 S.C. at 444, 415 S.E.2d at 799. Â To borrow the majority's words, &quot;[i]n\r\n  the more than twenty years following these changes [to Title 44],&quot; DDSN\r\n  has never sought to expand the regulation beyond its plainly stated\r\n  boundaries.Â  \r\nEven accepting as\r\n  correct the majority's contention that Regulation 88-210(F) controls, the only\r\n  criteria provided is that the symptoms of mental retardation must present\r\n  themselves prior to age twenty-two.Â  The open question therefore is what those\r\n  symptoms must be in the absence of a comprehensive definition found in the\r\n  waiver application or a regulation, namely whether the remainder of the\r\n  diagnostic criteria in the guidelines apply or the SSI definition controls.\r\nBy acknowledging DDSN\r\n  is free to adopt its own criteria which are more restrictive than those found\r\n  in the SSI definition and narrowing its focus on the conflict between the guidelines and Regulation 88-210(F), the\r\n  majority ostensibly agrees the guidelines are in effect unless they conflict\r\n  with state law.Â  However, the majority at times seems to suggest that the SSI\r\n  definition has been adopted as a matter of state law and therefore is the\r\n  controlling definition.Â  In particular, the majority consistently references\r\n  the SSI definition and how it &quot;parallels,&quot; &quot;mirrors,&quot; is\r\n  &quot;in line with&quot;, and is &quot;consistent with&quot; state legislative enactments.Â  Furthermore, the majority writes that\r\n  Regulation 88-210(F) &quot;recites&quot; the SSI definition of mental\r\n  retardation and &quot;interpret[s] [section 44-20-30(11)] in a manner\r\n  consistent with&quot; it.Â The majority\r\n  also states that &quot;the scope of HCBS\r\n  furnished under the waiver program and recipient eligibility criteria are\r\n  defined by the waiver application,&quot; and this application &quot;reveals no\r\n  intent to vary from or otherwise limit the group of individuals encompassed by\r\n  the SSI definition of mental retardation.&quot;Â  It accordingly appears the\r\n  majority holds that state law incorporates the SSI definition.Â  The conclusion\r\n  which follows is that DDSN's guidelines are invalid in toto because they\r\n  wholly conflict with this definition.Â  To the extent this is the majority's\r\n  holding, I disagree.[14]\r\nIn my opinion, section\r\n  44-20-30(11) and Regulation 88-210(F) are not similar to the SSI definition in\r\n  any substantial regard.Â  The\r\n  SSI definition for mental retardation is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Mental\r\n    retardation refers to significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\r\n    with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the\r\n    developmental period; i.e., the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of\r\n    impairment before age 22.\r\n  The\r\n    required level of severity for this disorder is met when the requirements in A,\r\n    B, C, or D are satisfied.\r\n  A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Mental incapacity evidenced by\r\n    dependence upon others for personal needs (e.g., toileting, eating, dressing,\r\n    or bathing) and inability to follow directions, such that the use of\r\n    standardized measures of intellectual functioning is precluded; or\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp; A valid verbal, performance, or\r\n    full scale IQ of 59 or less; or\r\n  C.&nbsp;&nbsp; A valid verbal, performance, or\r\n    full scale IQ of 60-70 and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional\r\n    and significant work-related limitation or function; or\r\n  D.&nbsp;&nbsp; A valid verbal, performance, or\r\n      full scale IQ of 60-70, resulting in at least two of the following:\r\n    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marked restriction in activities\r\n      of daily living; or\r\n    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marked difficulties in maintaining\r\n    social function; or\r\n    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marked difficulties in maintaining\r\n    concentration, persistence, or pace; or\r\n    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeated episodes of\r\n    decompensation, each of extended duration.\r\n\r\n20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P,\r\n  App. 1 Â§ 12.05.Â  Section 44-20-30(11) simply defines mental retardation as\r\n  &quot;significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing\r\n  concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the\r\n  developmental period.&quot;Â  When these\r\n  two sections are juxtaposed, it is clear that the only mirror image\r\n  between the two is in the first line of the SSI definition.Â  In my opinion,\r\n  there is nothing to suggest that the General Assembly implicitly agreed to\r\n  incorporate the remaining 156 words by using language similar to the first line\r\n  of the SSI definition of mental retardation.\r\nLike section 44-20-30(11),\r\n  Regulation 88-210(K) defines mental retardation in broad terms.Â  The only\r\n  difference is that subsection (F) defines developmental period as being before\r\n  the individual's twenty-second birthday.Â  While it does provide one more piece\r\n  of the puzzleâ€”and only as to the licensing of programs and not waiver\r\n  eligibilityâ€”it conspicuously lacks the myriad other diagnostic criteria present\r\n  in the SSI definition.Â  I accordingly disagree that section 44-20-30(11) and\r\n  Regulation 88-210(F) are similar to the SSI definition and would find no intent\r\n  to adopt the SSI definition of mental retardation as a matter of state law.Â \r\n  Because it is not the law of this State, I would stay true to the majority's\r\n  central premise that states are free to set their own diagnostic criteria and\r\n  find the SSI definition does not inform our analysis.Â  \r\nDue to the lack of\r\n  controlling statutory or regulatory guidance, it was incumbent upon DDSN to set\r\n  its own criteria for mental retardation.Â  I certainly agree that such policy\r\n  guidance ordinarily does not have the effect of law and can never trump a valid\r\n  regulation or statute. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-10(4) (2005).Â  However,\r\n  I do not read the majority's opinion as suggesting that such guidance must be\r\n  wholly disregarded in cases where there are no controlling statutes or\r\n  regulations.Â  In this case, I do not believe there is any controlling law, and\r\n  it was therefore necessary for DDSN to issue its own criteria.Â  I would\r\n  accordingly adhere to our precedents deferring to agency interpretations of\r\n  statutes and hold the hearing officer did not err in applying DDSN's standard,\r\n  including onset before age eighteen. See\r\n    Byerly Hosp. v. S.C. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 319 S.C. 225, 229, 460 S.E.2d 383, 386 (1995)\r\n  (&quot;[B]ecause the Commission has been designated as the single state agency\r\n  for implantation of Medicaid, great deference must be accorded its\r\n  interpretations of Medicaid laws and regulations.&quot;).Â  \r\nII.\r\nBecause I believe the hearing\r\n  officer did not commit an error of law in applying DDSN's definition of mental\r\n  retardation, I proceed to reach the other issues raised on appeal by Doe.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of Mental\r\n  Retardation\r\nTurning to facts of this\r\n  case, Doe's scores place her right on the border of mental retardation under\r\n  DDSN's definition.Â  Between the ages of twelve and seventeen, her full scale IQ\r\n  scores ranged from a low of sixty-eightâ€”which was felt to be an underestimate\r\n  of her abilitiesâ€”to a high of seventy-three.Â  Additionally, the only adaptive\r\n  behavior score obtained before her eighteenth birthday was a seventy.Â  At this\r\n  point, it is left to the professional judgment of those reviewing Doe's\r\n  application to determine whether she is mentally retarded under DDSN's\r\n  standards.Â  While the record contains diagnoses made by various individuals,\r\n  including physicians who treated Doe, that she was mentally retarded before she\r\n  turned eighteen, the record also contains testimony of DDSN officials\r\n  expressing concern about the bald nature of some of these diagnoses and\r\n  evidence that Doe's levels of functioning may have been higher than meets the\r\n  eye.Â  Additionally, the record contains findings that she is in the borderline\r\n  range of intelligence, which is not equivalent to mental retardation.Â  The\r\n  record contains similarly conflicting evidence of the impact her intellectual\r\n  deficits have on her adaptive skills.\r\nViewing the record in its\r\n  entirety, I cannot say the ALC erred in affirming the hearing officer.Â  I\r\n  believe there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion that Doe does\r\n  not suffer from mental retardation.Â  Indeed, there may be substantial evidence\r\n  to support the opposite conclusion as well.Â  But, the fact that reasonable\r\n  minds may reach an opposite result based on the same evidence does not render\r\n  the hearing officer's order invalid. Waters\r\n    v. S.C. Land Res. Conservation Comm'n,\r\n  321 S.C. 219, 226, 467 S.E.2d 913, 917 (1996) (stating the fact that one could\r\n  draw inconsistent conclusions from the same body of evidence does not render\r\n  the agency's decision unsupported by substantial evidence).Â  The parties here presented voluminous evidence of\r\n  Doe's condition, each side fleshing out its position amply.Â  In the end, this\r\n  case boiled down to a quintessential factual determination and battle of the\r\n  experts.Â  Under our standard of review, I would find no error in the hearing\r\n  officer's decision.[15]\r\nDoe next argues the hearing\r\n  officer and the ALC erred in not giving controlling weight to the diagnoses of\r\n  mental retardation made by her treating physicians.Â  She bases her argument on\r\n  20 C.F.R. Â§ 404.1527(d)(2), which provides, &quot;If [the SSA] find[s] that a\r\n  treating source's opinion on the issue(s) of the nature and severity of [the]\r\n  impairment(s) is well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory\r\n  diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial\r\n  evidence in [the] case record, [the SSA] will give it controlling\r\n  weight.&quot;Â  Without discussing whether DDSN had sufficient reason to not\r\n  give controlling weight to these diagnoses, the language in this regulation by\r\n  its very terms applies only to SSA determinations of disability.Â  No party here\r\n  disputes that Doe is disabled.Â  Instead, we are faced with a state agency\r\n  determination of whether Doe is eligible for ICF/MR waiver services.Â  I can\r\n  find no statutes or regulations, and Doe has not directed us to any, which\r\n  require a state agency in DDSN's position to give controlling weight to a\r\n  treating physician's diagnosis. \r\nThis is not to say, however,\r\n  that a treating physician's diagnosis is not entitled to any weight.Â  To the\r\n  contrary, DDSN and the hearing officer ought to examine and consider the\r\n  opinions of those doctors as relevant, probative evidence of an applicant's\r\n  condition.Â  Under the facts of a particular case, DDSN and the hearing officer\r\n  may attach any such weight to these diagnoses as they see appropriate and the\r\n  facts permit.Â  While the policy behind 20 C.F.R. Â§ 404.1527(d)(2) is a good one,\r\n  there is no similar requirement under our regulations, and this Court is not in\r\n  a position to create one.Â  Instead, the diagnoses should be considered along\r\n  with the whole body of evidence in the record.Â  On appeal, the ALC and the\r\n  appellate courts also should consider them in light of all the other evidence\r\n  in determining whether DDSN's decision is supported by substantial evidence, or\r\n  is arbitrary or capricious.[16]\r\nIn a similar vein, Doe also\r\n  argues the hearing officer restricted the rights of her treating physicians to\r\n  practice medicine by not giving controlling weight to their diagnoses.Â  Every\r\n  state seeking to offer waiver services must provide in the application\r\n  &quot;[a] description of who will make these evaluations and how they will be\r\n  made.&quot; 42 C.F.R. Â§ 441.303(c)(1).Â  South Carolina's approved program\r\n  specifically permits non-physicians to determine whether an applicant suffers\r\n  from mental retardation.[17] South Carolina Waiver, App. B-6(c).Â  In this case, DDSN and the hearing officer\r\n  disagreed with the diagnoses made by Doe's treating physicians.Â  As discussed,\r\n  while the fact that some doctors did diagnose her as being mentally retarded\r\n  certainly is relevant evidence, it is just evidence.Â  Simply because DDSN\r\n  officials and the hearing officer in a regulatory action disagreed with the\r\n  diagnoses of Doe's treating physicians in no way limits their ability to\r\n  practice medicine.Â  Not only did these officials have the authority to\r\n  determine eligibility for MR/RD waiver services, it would be absurd to hold\r\n  that a disagreement with a physician infringes on that doctor's ability to\r\n  practice medicine in any way.\r\nDoe finally argues the\r\n  hearing officer erred in considering evidence outside of the record.Â  In\r\n  particular, Doe argues the hearing officer concluded the SSA awarded SSI\r\n  benefits for an unidentified condition other than mental retardation based on\r\n  his own experiences as an SSA disability examiner and disability hearing\r\n  officer.Â  However, I believe Doe's argument is not preserved for review as she\r\n  has raised it for the first time before this Court.Â  Doe accordingly argues\r\n  that because she is an incompetent, we should relax our preservation rules. See\r\n    Galloway v. Galloway, 249 S.C. 157, 160, 153 S.E.2d 326, 327 (1967).Â  It is\r\n  within our discretion to relax the preservation requirement when the rights of\r\n  a minor or incompetent are concerned. Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 65,\r\n  624 S.E.2d 649, 654 (2006).Â  I would decline to do so in this case because Doe\r\n  was at all times well-represented by counsel. Cf. Cumbie v. Cumbie, 245\r\n  S.C. 107, 113, 139 S.E.2d 477, 480 (1964) (reaching unpreserved issue because\r\n  &quot;[i]t is quite apparent here that the guardian ad litem for the\r\n  incompetent and the minor defendants treated the appointment as a pure\r\n  formality, and, as far as the record goes, made no effort whatever to protect\r\n  the interests of either the incompetent or said minors&quot;).\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Related Disability\r\nDoe argues she has two\r\n  related disabilities, cerebral palsy and epilepsy.Â  At no point did DDSN ever\r\n  question whether she suffers from either of those conditions.Â  Instead, the\r\n  relevant discussion was the extent of those conditions, including\r\n  whether they both had the requisite effect on Doe's adaptive skills and, in\r\n  particular, whether her epilepsy was as severe as she contended it was.Â  While\r\n  the witnesses in this case did observe and document her seizures, there was no\r\n  SSA diagnosis of epilepsy as there was for cerebral palsy.[18]Â \r\n  Accordingly, she first argues the hearing officer erred in not following the\r\n  procedures outlined in 42 C.F.R. Â§ 435.541 when evaluating her seizures. See 42 C.F.R. Â§ 435.541(c)(4)(i) (&quot;The [state] agency must make a\r\n  determination of disability in accordance with the requirements of this section\r\n  if any of the following circumstances exist: . . . The individual applies for\r\n  Medicaid as a non-cash recipient . . . and . . . [a]lleges a disabling\r\n  condition different from, or in addition to, that considered by SSA in making\r\n  its determination . . . .&quot;).Â  However, this requirement only applies when\r\n  a state agency instead of the SSA is making a disability determination\r\n  instead of the SSA, which only occurs in specific situations not applicable\r\n  here. See Medicaid\r\n  Program; Eligibility Determinations Based on Disability, 54 Fed. Reg. 50,755\r\n  (Dec. 11, 1989).Â  Doe is not asking DDSN\r\n  to determine whether she is disabled by her epilepsy; she is asking DDSN to\r\n  determine whether this condition is a related disability for purposes of\r\n  receiving HCBS.Â  Because these are two different determinations, I do not\r\n  believe the hearing officer erred in not following 42 C.F.R. Â§ 435.541 with\r\n  respect to Doe's epilepsy.\r\nShe next argues that the\r\n  hearing officer erred in applying the definition of related disability found in\r\n  section 44-20-30(15)[19] as opposed to the Medicaid[20] definition.Â  Although I believe the hearing officer did not err in applying the\r\n  definition from section 44-20-30(15), any error involved would be harmless.Â  Both\r\n  definitions contain the same requirement for limitation in three of six major\r\n  life areas, and as I conclude below, the hearing officer's findings that Doe's\r\n  conditions are not so limiting is supported by substantial evidence.Â  Doe also argues the hearing officer in any event erred\r\n  in his application of the definition of related disability found in section\r\n  44-20-30(15).Â  I agree with Doe that the hearing officer erred in his\r\n  interpretation, but I would find this error harmless as well for the same\r\n  reason.\r\nThe record establishes that\r\n  Doe's adaptive behavior scores were within the range for mental retardation,\r\n  and therefore within the range for a related disability.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  evidence shows that her limitations arose prior to her twenty-second birthday\r\n  and are likely to continue indefinitely.Â  However, I believe there is\r\n  substantial evidence to support the conclusion that Doe has not met the\r\n  requirement of experiencing &quot;substantial limitations&quot; in three of the\r\n  six major life areas listed in the statute.\r\nThe hearing officer described\r\n  her limitations as follows:\r\n\r\n  [Doe]\r\n    walks with a mild limp, with an awkward gait and she has some difficulty with\r\n    balance secondary to her left hemiparesis.Â  [Doe] has weakness in her left arm\r\n    with some contracture in her left hand.Â  She can only use her left hand as an\r\n    assist/stabilizer for small objects and she has difficulty using zippers, and\r\n    buttoning small buttons.Â  [Doe] is independent with dressing, bathing,\r\n    toileting, eating, transferring from one surface to another and ambulation;\r\n    however, she may require some prompting to perform some of these activities at\r\n    times.\r\n\r\nIn his final order, the\r\n  hearing officer made a series of specific findings leading to the conclusion\r\n  that Doe does not have a substantial limitation in any of the six major life\r\n  areas listed in the statute.Â  In sum, he found,\r\n\r\n  [Doe's]\r\n    Cerebral Palsy and Epileptic Seizure Disorder do not prevent [Doe] from\r\n    performing all self-care activities with little or no assistance or\r\n    supervision.Â  Her Cerebral Palsy and Epileptic Seizure Disorder do not affect\r\n    her understanding and use of language or learning; however, [Doe's]\r\n    longstanding mental disorders and learning disorder and/or borderline\r\n    intellectual function do affect these areas.Â  She is able to be independently\r\n    mobile despite her physical handicaps.Â  [Doe's] Cerebral Palsy and Epileptic\r\n    Seizure Disorder do not limit [Doe's] capacity for independent living; however,\r\n    her longstanding mental disorders are the biggest obstacle to this area of\r\n    major life activity.Â  [Doe's] Cerebral Palsy and Epileptic Seizure Disorder do\r\n    not result in substantial functional limitations in self-care, understanding\r\n    and use of language, learning, mobility, self-direction or capacity for\r\n    independent living; therefore, she does not have a Related Disability.\r\n\r\nAs the ALC recognized, Doe\r\n  has submitted voluminous evidence to support her position that she does indeed\r\n  suffer from a related disability.Â  Numerous witnesses recounted the limitations\r\n  Doe's conditions place on her daily life, and no one before the Court contends\r\n  that Doe can lead a truly normal life.Â  DDSN, on the other hand, introduced equally\r\n  voluminous evidence to demonstrate that her limitations may not be as severe as\r\n  they appear and are perhaps the product of her intentional efforts to not\r\n  integrate herself into the community.Â  In the end, the hearing officer found\r\n  that any limitations Doe does have generally result from mental illness and\r\n  disorders, not cerebral palsy and epilepsy.[21]Â \r\n  Once again, we are faced with an extremely close factual determination.Â  But,\r\n  also once again, it is not the province of an appellate court to weigh the evidence\r\n  before it on appeals from administrative proceedings.Â  Based on our standard of\r\n  review, I believe there is substantial evidence to support the finding that Doe\r\n  does not have substantial limitations in any of the major life areas and\r\n  accordingly does not suffer from a related disability.Â  Additionally, I can\r\n  discern no evidence that this finding by the hearing officer was arbitrary,\r\n  capricious, or an abuse of discretion.Â  Rather, it appears to be a\r\n  well-reasoned decision following a thorough review of the evidence presented.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due Process Claims\r\nDoe finally argues the\r\n  hearing officer violated her constitutional due process rights in three ways:\r\n  (1) basing his decision on reasons other than those contained in the notice\r\n  provided by DDSN to Doe; (2) determining Doe failed to exhaust her\r\n  administrative remedies; and (3) permitting DDSN to engage in retaliatory\r\n  conduct.Â  I disagree.\r\nAs to her first argument, a\r\n  state cannot withdraw Medicaid benefits without providing notice and an\r\n  opportunity to heard. O'Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773,\r\n  786-87 (1980).Â  In order to meet the requirements of procedural due process,\r\n  the State must provide adequate notice, adequate opportunity to be heard, the\r\n  right to introduce evidence, and the right to confront and cross-examine\r\n  witnesses. In re Vora, 354 S.C. 590, 595, 582 S.E.2d 413, 416 (2003).\r\nInitially, I do not believe\r\n  Doe's notice arguments are preserved for review.Â  Nowhere in the record does it\r\n  appear she raised this issue to the hearing officer or the ALC.Â  Indeed, Doe\r\n  concedes as much by preemptively arguing in her initial brief that we should\r\n  relax our preservation rules because she is an incompetent.Â  As discussed\r\n  previously, I would decline to do so under the facts of this case.Â \r\n  Furthermore, I question the merits of her argument.Â  Doe claims the hearing\r\n  officer engaged &quot;[i]n a classic case of trial by ambush&quot; when he\r\n  considered the results of evaluations performed by school psychologists offered\r\n  by DDSN from her high school years.Â  However, Doe's argument ignores the fact\r\n  that she had three months from the close of DDSN's case-in-chief to prepare her\r\n  own case.[22]Â \r\n  It would therefore appear she had ample notice and opportunity to respond to\r\n  this alleged ambush.\r\nSecond, Doe contends the ALC\r\n  erred in finding she has not exhausted her remedies with respect to her\r\n  argument that DDSN did not provide her with free choice of facilities for\r\n  treatment.Â  This issue is now moot in light of the decision of the United\r\n  States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that her freedom of choice claim\r\n  fails as a matter of law. See Doe v. Kidd, 501 F.3d 348, 358-60 (4th\r\n  Cir. 2007) (Doe I).Â  \r\nFinally, Doe argues the final\r\n  DDSN evaluation, the one which led to the termination of her benefits, was in\r\n  retaliation for a separate civil rights lawsuit she filed in federal court.[23]Â \r\n  In her brief to this Court, Doe engages in a lengthy discussion of the record\r\n  but cites no law to support her contentions.Â  She then argues due process\r\n  entitles her to notice and an opportunity to respond to the final 2005\r\n  evaluation, again citing no law and making only passing references to the\r\n  Fourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid Act.Â Â  The essence of her arguments,\r\n  however, is more of an attack on the credibility of DDSN's final decision, not\r\n  that DDSN engaged in retaliatory conduct.Â  Because I have already resolved that\r\n  issue, I find no error in rejecting this claim.\r\nIII.\r\nThe case before\r\n  us is the culmination of a long and contentious dispute regarding one young\r\n  woman's eligibility for certain Medicaid benefits.Â  Throughout this process,\r\n  tensions have flared as the parties have engaged in a vigorous dispute over\r\n  some very complicated and emotionally-charged issues.Â  At the center of all of\r\n  this is a now twenty-eight-year-old woman with undeniable cognitive and\r\n  adaptive deficits.Â  After a review of the\r\n  regulations concerning the labyrinthine Social Security and Medicaid Acts, I\r\n  agree there is no rule requiring states to be bound by the federal government's\r\n  disability determination or the SSI definition of mental retardation.Â  I\r\n  believe there is an express policy of granting states wide latitude in\r\n  designing and implementing programs to best meet their needs and the needs of\r\n  the target population.Â  Where I part company with the majority, however, is\r\n  with respect to whether South Carolina has adopted a different definition of\r\n  mental retardation.Â  In my opinion, DDSN acted within its authority in adopting\r\n  its present definition and would apply it in this case.\r\nAs to Doe's remaining\r\n  arguments, based on our standard of review, I would find the hearing officer's\r\n  determination that Doe does not suffer from mental retardation or a related\r\n  disability is supported by substantial evidence.Â  In administrative appeals,\r\n  this Court does not make findings of fact or weigh evidence; we sit only to\r\n  ensure that the findings below are supported by substantial evidence and are\r\n  not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.Â  As discussed, both\r\n  parties presented copious evidence of the nature and extent of Doe's\r\n  conditions.Â  Accordingly, it was the job of the hearing officer to make this\r\n  incredibly close factual call.Â  Simply because reasonable minds may disagree\r\n  with the result does not make it unsupported by substantial evidence or\r\n  arbitrary or capricious.Â  I also believe the hearing officer did not commit any\r\n  errors of law.Â  Therefore, I would affirm the order of the ALC.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Final Administrative Order, June 5, 2006.\r\n[2] A showing that the average\r\n  annual cost of HCBS would not exceed that of institutional services is also\r\n  required.Â  42 U.S.C. Â§ 1396n(c)(2)(D) (2006). \r\n[3] Although this particular part of the regulations\r\n  concerns benefits under a different portion of the Social Security Act, this\r\n  listing of impairments is the operative listing for Supplemental Security\r\n  Income and Medicaid purposes. 20 C.F.R. Â§ 416.905 (2011).\r\n[4] South Carolina filed a Request for a Renewal to a Â§\r\n  1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services Waiver (Effective January 1, 2010)\r\n  and a Request for an Amendment to a Â§ 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Waiver\r\n  (Effective March 1, 2011).Â  However, neither the renewal or amendment waiver application\r\n  altered the Level of Care evaluation criteria or frequency.Â Â  \r\n[5] Prior to the 1990 Act, South Carolina defined a\r\n  &quot;mentally retarded person&quot; as &quot;any person, other than a mentally\r\n  ill person primarily in need of mental health services, whose intellectual\r\n  deficit and adaptive level of behavior require for his benefit, or that of the\r\n  public, special training, education, supervision, treatment, care or control in\r\n  his home or community, or in a service facility or program under the control\r\n  and management of the Department.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-21-30 (1976).\r\nSubsequent to the\r\n  briefing and arguments in this case, the General Assembly, in 2011 Act No. 47,\r\n  changed the references to mental retardation in section 44-20-30 to\r\n  &quot;intellectual disability.&quot;Â  Although the definition of intellectual\r\n  disability is the same as it was for mental retardation, it has been moved to\r\n  subsection 12 of section 44-20-30.Â  To ensure our references are consistent\r\n  with the record in this case, we will continue to use the terminology in effect\r\n  at the time this case arose and was argued.\r\n[6] Chapter 88 of the South Carolina Code of Regulations\r\n  draws its statutory authority from title 44, chapter 20 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code.Â  While chapter 88 continues to list its statutory authority as article 3\r\n  of chapter 21, title 44 of the 1976 Code, that article was repealed in 1990.Â \r\n  The relevant statutory provisions were reenacted as article 5 of chapter 20.Â \r\n  This change was part of the same act that adopted the new definition in section\r\n  44-20-30.Â  1990 S.C. Acts 2184, 2200-04.Â  Notably, while the pre-1990\r\n  definition of mental retardation applied only to the article of title 44 in\r\n  which it was located, the new definition in section 44-20-30 explicitly applied\r\n  to the entire chapter.Â  Thus, the General Assembly manifested its intent that\r\n  the definition in section 44-20-30 would apply to the licensing provisions\r\n  interpreted in chapter 88 of the South Carolina Code of Regulations.Â  Those\r\n  regulations dictate that the developmental period extends to age twenty-two.Â \r\n  In the more than twenty years following these changes in the law, DDSN has not\r\n  altered the regulations to reflect a contrary view.\r\n[7] In ignoring Regulation 88-210 and finding DDSN's policy guidelines properly supplied more specific\r\n  criteria outside the waiver application, the dissent acknowledges the\r\n  fact that DDSN's policy guidelines are not regulations promulgated by a state agency; yet the dissent\r\n  finds the policy guidelines are entitled to deference in interpreting section\r\n  44-20-30.Â  In accordance with our statutory law, we hold an agency guideline\r\n  does not have the force of law, and in any event, can never trump a\r\n  regulation.Â  Our law provides that &quot;'[r]egulation' means each agency\r\n  statement of general public applicability that implements or prescribes law or\r\n  policy or practice requirements of any agency.Â  Policy or guidance issued by\r\n    an agency other than in a regulation does not have the force or effect of law.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-10(4) (2005) (emphasis added).Â  Thus, because the age-eighteen-onset\r\n  requirement found in DDSN's policy guidelines has not been formally adopted as\r\n  a regulation, it does not have the force and effect of law and is entitled to\r\n  no deference.Â  Indeed, the only South Carolina law addressing the age onset\r\n  requirement is Regulation 88-210.Â  \r\n[8] In other litigation involving Doe, the United States\r\n  Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit noted that Doe â€œhas developmental\r\n  disabilities including epilepsy, mild mental retardation, and cerebral palsy.â€Â  Doe v. Kidd, 501 F.3d 348, 351 (4th Cir. 2007).\r\n[9] A CTH II is not an ICF/MR\r\n  facility; it is classified as respite care rather than institutional care.Â \r\n  Patients in a CTH II receive twenty-four hour supervision and some training\r\n  depending on their assessed needs and care. Â A CTH II facility has one to two\r\n  staff responsible for up to four individuals.Â  During the pendency of this\r\n  appeal, DDSN agreed to continue providing Doe HCBS benefits.Â  \r\n[10] The hearing officer further determined that Doe did\r\n  not meet the definition of a related disability.Â  Because we conclude the\r\n  hearing officer applied the incorrect definition of mental retardation, we need\r\n  not reach Doe's separate challenge to the related disability finding.\r\n[11] The dissent asserts that Regulation 88-210 is\r\n  inapplicable to the question before us because it refers only to licensing, not\r\n  eligibility.Â  This ignores the fact that Regulation 88-210 is an interpretation\r\n  of the same statute, section 44-20-30, purportedly interpreted by DDSN's policy\r\n  guidelines.Â  We adhere to the basic principle that the same word should not be\r\n  given disparate meanings within a single statutory scheme.Â  Further, the plain\r\n  language of the regulation shows that the definitions in 88-210 apply to the\r\n  licensing of all programs &quot;for the care, maintenance, education,\r\n  training or treatment&quot; of mentally retarded persons that operate for at\r\n  least ten hours per week, unless specifically excluded.Â  26 S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 88-105.Â  Nothing in the text of 88-105 or 88-210 excludes non-residential\r\n  waiver services from the scope of the definitions found therein, and the\r\n  dissent does not appear to contest that some of the programs subject to the\r\n  definitions in 88-210 are waiver services.Â  Therefore, in our view, Regulation\r\n  88-210 expresses the view that the term &quot;developmental period&quot; in\r\n  section 44-20-30 has the same meaning in the context of waiver services as it\r\n  does in the context of basic Medicaid services.\r\n[12] For example,\r\n  Mississippi's application defines mental retardation as an IQ score of\r\n  approximately seventy or below, age of onset prior to age eighteen, and a\r\n  determination of deficits in adaptive behavior. Application for 1915(c) HCBS\r\n  Waiver, Mississippi, App. B-6(d).Â  Alaska defines the condition as an IQ of\r\n  less than seventy, plus or minus five points; age of onset prior to age\r\n  twenty-two; and &quot;a substantial disability to the individual's ability to\r\n  function in society.&quot; Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver, Alaska, App.\r\n  B-6(d).Â  Iowa simply incorporates by reference the definition of mental\r\n  retardation found in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and\r\n  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Application\r\n  for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver, Iowa, App. B-1(b).\r\n[13] South Carolina is not alone.Â  Massachusetts'\r\n  application, for example, merely defines the target group as\r\n  &quot;[p]articipants age 18 and older with an intellectual disability as\r\n  defined by the Massachusetts DDS who meet the ICF-MR level of care and who are\r\n  determined through an assessment process to require Community Living Supports\r\n  due to a moderate level of assessed need.&quot; Application for 1915(c) HCBS\r\n  Waiver, Massachusetts, App. B-1(b).Â  Virginia's application does the same thing:\r\n  &quot;Waiver services are limited to the following groups: individuals of any\r\n  age with a diagnosis of intellectual disability/mental retardation . . .\r\n  .&quot; Application for 1915(c) HCBS Waiver, Virginia, App. B-1(b).\r\n[14] If the majority is not holding that the SSI definition\r\n  applies, I do not understand the relevance of the many comparisons between this\r\n  definition and section 44-20-30(11), Regulation 88-210(F), and the waiver\r\n  application.\r\n[15] At various points, Doe also argues that DDSN and HHS\r\n  should be estopped from denying she suffers from mental retardation because they\r\n  sought reimbursement from the federal government for services they supplied\r\n  using the diagnostic code for mental retardation.Â  However, it appears Doe did\r\n  not learn of this fact until discovery.Â  To the extent such an act could give\r\n  rise to estoppel against the government, Doe's argument must fail because she\r\n  cannot prove any reliance on this billing practice. See Grant v. City of\r\n    Folly Beach, 346 S.C. 74, 80, 551 S.E.2d 229, 232 (2001).\r\n[16] For example, if a treating physician's diagnosis has\r\n  not been called into question or there are no competing diagnoses, not giving\r\n  it controlling weight may be arbitrary and an abuse of discretion.Â  That\r\n  situation is not present in the case before us.\r\n[17] The waiver application in effect at the time\r\n  permitted physicians to make an eligibility determination.Â  Based on this, Doe\r\n  argues that because her treating physicians found her to be mentally retarded,\r\n  their diagnoses control.Â  However, this argument assumes that her treating\r\n  physicians were actually &quot;performing initial evaluations of level of care\r\n  for waiver participants.&quot;Â  Nothing in the record indicates that they were\r\n  performing such a function here.\r\n[18] The doctor performing the SSI\r\n  examination concluded &quot;[s]he has multiple physical, mental, and emotional\r\n  impairments, including cerebral palsy with left spastic hemiparesis and Mild\r\n  Mental Retardation.&quot;Â  Based on this assessment, which included a fairly\r\n  thorough review of Doe's condition, the SSA awarded her SSI with a primary\r\n  diagnosis of mental retardation and a secondary diagnosis of cerebral palsy.\r\n[19] Section 44-20-30(15) provides, \r\n&quot;Related\r\n  disability&quot; is a severe, chronic condition found to be closely related to\r\n  mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for persons\r\n  with mental retardation and must meet the following conditions:\r\n(a)Â  It\r\n  is attributable to cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, or any other condition\r\n  other than mental illness found to be closely related to mental retardation\r\n  because this condition results in impairment of general intellectual\r\n  functioning or adaptive behavior similar to that of persons with mental\r\n  retardation and requires treatment or services similar to those required for\r\n  these persons.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (b)Â  It is manifested before twenty-two years of age.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (c)Â  It is likely to continue indefinitely.\r\n(d) It\r\n  results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following\r\n  areas of major life activity: self-care, understanding and use of language,\r\n  learning, mobility, self-direction, and capacity for independent living.\r\nDDSN has\r\n  offered no additional guidance with respect to related disabilities. \r\n[20] The regulatory definition reads in part,\r\nPersons with related conditions means individuals who\r\n  have a severe, chronic disability that meets all of the following conditions:\r\n(a) It is attributable to--\r\n\r\n  (1)Cerebral\r\n    palsy or epilepsy; or\r\n  (2)Any other\r\n    condition, other than mental illness, found to be closely related to mental\r\n    retardation because this condition results in impairment of general\r\n    intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior similar to that of mentally\r\n    retarded persons, and requires treatment or services to those required for\r\n    these persons.\r\n\r\n42 C.F.R. Â§ 435.1010. \r\n[21] Doe again argues the hearing officer failed in not\r\n  giving controlling weight to the conclusions of the physicians who treated Doe's\r\n  seizures and cerebral palsy.Â  As I concluded supra, failure to do so is\r\n  not legal error.\r\n[22] Although Doe was the party who brought the case\r\n  before the hearing officer, DDSN presented its evidence first January 24-26,\r\n  2006, and Doe presented her case April 27-28, 2006.\r\n[23] Doe filed a lawsuit alleging violations of the\r\n  Medicaid Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, and various state laws against\r\n  DDSN, HHS, and certain state officials. Doe I, 501 F.3d at 352.Â  Doe\r\n    I disposed of Doe's claim regarding her freedom of choice of providers. Id.\r\n  at 358-60.Â  The Fourth Circuit subsequently disposed of her remaining argument\r\n  that DDSN violated her civil rights by not providing her residential services\r\n  with reasonable promptness. Doe v. Kidd, No. 10-1191, 2011 WL 1058542,\r\n  at *4-5 (4th Cir. Mar. 24, 2011) (Doe II).Â  Doe II has no impact\r\n  on our decision in this case as the Fourth Circuit specifically left open the\r\n  issues regarding Doe's eligibility and retaliation claims for us to consider.

Farthing, all of Columbia; and Kevin Scott Brackett,\r\n          of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  TOAL: Kevin Cornelius Odems\r\n  (Petitioner) appeals the court of appeals' decision affirming his 2005\r\n  convictions for first degree burglary, grand larceny, criminal conspiracy, and\r\n  malicious injury.Â  The State's case against Petitioner consisted solely of\r\n  circumstantial evidence.Â  Petitioner argues that the State failed to present substantial circumstantial evidence of his involvement in any of the crimes charged, and\r\n  thus the circuit court should have directed a verdict on all four counts.Â  We\r\n  agree and reverse.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn March 21, 2005, Margaret\r\n  Burns noticed a brown car she did not recognize turning into her cousin's\r\n  driveway.Â  Burns telephoned law enforcement while she continued to watch the\r\n  car from her own vehicle parked across the street from the house.Â  Burns\r\n  observed two men knocking on the door of her cousin's house, and later observed\r\n  one of the men place something in the car's trunk.Â  Burns unsuccessfully\r\n  attempted to follow the car once it departed.Â  \r\nApproximately ninety minutes\r\n  after Burns notified police, a nearby sheriff's deputy spotted a brown\r\n  Cadillac.Â  The sheriff's deputy pulled the car over, and ordered the driver out\r\n  of the car.Â  The driver, Derrick Dawkins, exited the car, as he spoke to two men\r\n  located inside the car, Petitioner and Frederick Bell.Â  Dawkins testified at\r\n  trial that he told Petitioner that his license had been suspended, and that\r\n  shortly thereafter &quot;everybody ran.&quot;Â  Â \r\nA short time later Petitioner\r\n  knocked at the door of Donna Beane.Â  Petitioner informed Beane that he needed a\r\n  ride.Â  Beane did not know Petitioner, but allowed him to use her telephone to\r\n  call for a ride.Â  Petitioner did not call for a ride, but told Beane that if\r\n  police arrived she should inform them that he was her boyfriend.Â  Beane claimed\r\n  that Petitioner told her &quot;he was with somebody that didn't have a driver's\r\n  license or that had a suspended driver's license and that the person had gotten\r\n  pulled over and that he didn't want to get in any trouble.&quot; Â Â Beane\r\n  refused Petitioner's request just as police officers arrived.Â  Police took\r\n  Petitioner into custody as well as Dawkins and Bell who were found hiding in\r\n  Beane's backyard.Â  \r\nA police search of the Cadillac\r\n  recovered several items identified as stolen from the victim's home, including\r\n  a camcorder, a money jar containing between $300 and $400, a camera, three\r\n  watches, and a gun.Â  The estimated total value of the stolen items was over\r\n  $1,000.Â  \r\nThe York County grand jury\r\n  indicted Petitioner for first degree burglary, grand larceny, criminal\r\n  conspiracy, and malicious injury to an electric utility system.Â  At trial,\r\n  Petitioner moved for a directed verdict at the close of the State's evidence.Â \r\n  The circuit court denied the motion.Â  The jury convicted Petitioner of the four\r\n  charges, and the circuit court sentenced Petitioner to fifteen years\r\n  imprisonment.Â  The court of appeals affirmed Petitioner's convictions, holding\r\n  the circuit court did not err in refusing to grant a directed verdict on the\r\n  charges.Â  \r\nISSUE PRESENTED \r\nDid the court of appeals err in\r\n  holding the circuit court properly refused to direct a verdict for Petitioner\r\n  on the charges of first degree burglary, grand larceny, criminal conspiracy,\r\n  and malicious injury to an electronic utility meter?[1]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nOn appeal from the denial of\r\n  a directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the State.Â  State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 583, 541 S.E.2d\r\n  254, 256 (2001) (citing State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d\r\n  525, 531 (1999)).Â Â  The defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the\r\n  State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McHoney,\r\n  344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).Â  However, if there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n  an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  State\r\n    v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  A circuit judge should grant a directed verdict motion when the\r\n  evidence merely raises a suspicion the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Shrock,\r\n  283 S.C. 129, 132, 322 S.E.2d 450, 451-52 (1984). Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues that the\r\n  court of appeals erred in affirming the circuit court's refusal to direct a\r\n  verdict on the four charges for which he was convicted.Â  We agree.Â  This Court\r\n  has repeatedly affirmed the principle that when the State fails to produce\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed a particular\r\n  crime, the defendant is entitled to a directed verdict.Â  State v. Rothschild,\r\n  351 S.C. 238, 243, 569 S.E.2d 346, 348 (2000).Â  \r\nTwo cases from this Court's\r\n  jurisprudence are instructive in explaining the proof required in cases built\r\n  wholly on circumstantial evidence.Â  In State v. Bostick, 392 S.C. 134,\r\n  708 S.E.2d 774 (2011), the State accused Bostick of killing his neighbor,\r\n  Polite, and burning down her home.Â  The State presented the following evidence\r\n  against Bostick: (1) investigators found personal items belonging to Polite,\r\n  including a watch and two sets of car keys, in a burn pile located on the\r\n  Bostick family property; (2) Bostick's shoes contained a pattern that matched\r\n  gasoline, and gasoline was the accelerant used to start the house fire; (3) and\r\n  investigators found blood on the clothes Bostick was wearing the day of the\r\n  murder, but that evidence could not be matched to Polite's DNA.Â  Id. at\r\n  141-42, 708 S.E.2d at 778.Â  However, the State never introduced a motive or a\r\n  murder weapon into evidence.Â  Id.Â  Thus, &quot;the evidence presented by\r\n  the State raised, at most, a mere suspicion that Bostick committed this\r\n  crime.&quot;Â  Id. at 142, 708 S.E.2d at 778.Â  \r\nIn State v. Lollis this Court reviewed a court of appeals' decision affirming a circuit court's\r\n  refusal to direct a verdict on a charge of second degree arson.Â  343 S.C. 580,\r\n  581, 541 S.E.2d 254, 255 (2001).Â  Lollis lived in a mobile home with his common\r\n  law wife, Tammy Burgess.Â  Id. at 582, 541 S.E.2d at 255. Â Burgess\r\n  confessed to setting fire to the home and claimed that Lollis had no knowledge\r\n  of her plans.Â  Id.Â  According to Burgess, she burned the home in order\r\n  to erase the couple's mortgage debt.Â  Id.Â  However, the State charged\r\n  both Lollis and Burgess in the arson of the mobile home.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe State relied on four\r\n  pieces of circumstantial evidence to convict Lollis: (1) the marital\r\n  relationship between Burgess and Lollis; (2) Lollis's alleged financial trouble;\r\n  (3) the fact that Lollis placed his personal valuables from the home in a\r\n  storage room one day prior to the fire; and (4) Lollis's possession of the\r\n  storage room key on the day of the fire.Â  Id. at 584, 541 S.E.2d at 256.Â \r\n  However, alternate evidence showed that Lollis was current on his mortgage at\r\n  the time of the fire.Â  Lollis, 343 S.C. at 585, 541 S.E.2d at 257.Â \r\n  Moreover, Lollis testified he had no reason to burn down his home because of\r\n  extensive remodeling being done at the time of the fire, and that he moved his\r\n  belongings into storage in order to protect them from damage due to that remodeling\r\n  work.Â  Id. at 582-83, 541 S.E.2d at 255.\r\nThis Court held that the\r\n  State's evidence did not &quot;reasonably tend&quot; to \r\nprove Lollis's guilt: \r\n\r\n  First,\r\n    Burgess admitted to starting the fire without assistance from Lollis, without\r\n    his knowledge, and the State presented no evidence of an agreement between\r\n    them.Â  Second, the State presented no evidence of Lollis' financial trouble . .\r\n    . . Furthermore, Lollis did not have insurance on his personal property lost in\r\n    the fire.Â  Finally, Lollis presented a plausible explanation for placing\r\n    valuables in the storage room on the day of the fireâ€”he was trying to protect\r\n    them from drywall dust as he remodeled his home.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 585, 541 S.E.2d at 257 (holding that a mere\r\n  arousal of suspicion is an improper basis to deny a motion for directed\r\n  verdict). \r\nThe circumstantial evidence\r\n  presented in Petitioner's case is analogous to that found in Bostick and Lollis.Â  The State's case against Petitioner relied primarily on three\r\n  pieces of circumstantial evidence: (1) the fact that less than ninety minutes\r\n  after the burglary, police located Petitioner in the getaway car with the\r\n  burglars and the stolen goods; (2) Petitioner fled from law enforcement; and\r\n  (3) Petitioner asked an uninvolved person to lie for him.Â  State v. Odems,\r\n  385 S.C. 399, 404-05, 684 S.E.2d 573, 575 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  \r\nEven when viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the State, the circumstantial evidence presented does not\r\n  reasonably tend to prove Petitioner's guilt.Â  The sole eyewitness in\r\n  Petitioner's case described only two men at the scene.Â  A forensic investigator\r\n  testified that she collected twelve sets of fingerprints in the car and from\r\n  the stolen goods.Â  These sets included prints from both Dawkins and Bell, but\r\n  not Petitioner.Â  Dawkins testified during the State's case-in-chief and\r\n  explained how Petitioner ended up in the car with the stolen goods even though\r\n  he did not participate in the burglary[2]: \r\n\r\n  We\r\n    stopped at a little gas station up the road up there and that's where I ran\r\n    into [Petitioner] at, at the gas station . . . . He asked me can he get a\r\n    ride.Â  I said yeah, you can get a ride, man.Â  I didn't let him know what was\r\n    going on, what just happened you know, so we jumped in the car, we left.[3]Â  \r\n\r\nThe court of appeals\r\n  emphasized Petitioner's flight from law enforcement in finding State v.\r\n    Crawford controlling.Â  362 S.C. 627, 608 S.E.2d 886 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nIn Crawford, the\r\n  defendant was present at the scene of a rental store burglary.Â  Id. at\r\n  634-35, 608 S.E.2d at 890.Â  Police then located Crawford in the getaway car,\r\n  but he fled before an arrest could take place.Â  Id.Â  The driver told the\r\n  arresting officer that Crawford and the third passenger stole tools from the\r\n  rental store.Â  Id. at 631-32, 608 S.E.2d at 888.Â  However, at trial, the\r\n  driver testified that he could not say definitively whether Crawford\r\n  participated in the robbery.Â  Id. at 632, 608 S.E.2d at 889.Â  The other\r\n  passenger in the car testified that he acted alone during the robbery, and that\r\n  he did not inform the driver or Crawford that he planned on breaking into the\r\n  store.Â  Id.Â  The court of appeals upheld the circuit court's denial of a\r\n  directed verdict on a charge of criminal conspiracy.Â  Crawford, 362 S.C.\r\n  at 645-46, 608 S.E.2d at 896. \r\nThe flight in Crawford is distinguishable from that of Petitioner.Â  In Crawford, the statements\r\n  from the driver and passenger provided substantive direct evidence of at least\r\n  Crawford's presence at the crime scene, and in the case of the driver's first\r\n  statement, a direct implication in the crime itself.Â  Thus, the totality of the\r\n  circumstances could have created an inference that Crawford had knowledge he\r\n  was being sought by authorities.Â  Id. at 635, 608 S.E.2d at 890. \r\nIn relying on Crawford,\r\n  the court of appeals noted that flight evidence is relevant when the flight and\r\n  the offense charged are connected.Â  State v. Odems, 385 S.C. 399, 404,\r\n  684 S.E.2d 573, 575 (Ct. App. 2009) (citing State v. Pagan, 369 S.C.\r\n  201, 209, 631 S.E.2d 262, 266 (2006)).Â  However, in Petitioner's case, the\r\n  State failed to present evidence connecting Petitioner's flight with anything\r\n  other than Dawkins's statement regarding his suspended driver's license.Â  \r\nIn Crawford there was\r\n  no doubt regarding the defendant's presence at the scene of the crime,\r\n  regardless of whether it could actually be proven that he participated in the\r\n  crime.Â  In Petitioner's case, there is no evidence before this Court placing\r\n  Petitioner at the crime scene, or discounting the testimony of Dawkins and\r\n  Beane regarding Petitioner's reason for attempting to flee arrest.Â  We decline\r\n  to hold that flight alone is substantial circumstantial evidence of a\r\n  defendant's guilt.Â  \r\nPetitioner's overall actions\r\n  may appear suspicious, but mere suspicion is insufficient to support a guilty\r\n  verdict.Â  See State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 389-90, 605 S.E.2d 529, 531\r\n  (2004) (holding that the trial court must grant a directed verdict when the\r\n  evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty).Â  The\r\n  traditional circumstantial evidence definition illustrates the deficiency in\r\n  the State's evidence against Petitioner.Â  This definition provided that if the\r\n  State relies on circumstantial evidence to prove its case, the jury may not\r\n  convict the defendant unless: \r\n\r\n  Every\r\n    circumstance relied upon by the State be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and\r\n    . . . all of the circumstances proven be consistent with each other and taken\r\n    together, point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of\r\n    every other reasonable hypothesis.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 606 n.2, 677 S.E.2d at 626 n.2 (citing State\r\n  v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 274-76, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1989), abrogated\r\n    by State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 595-606, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478-82 (2004)).Â  \r\nDespite the Court's\r\n  abandonment of the use of this particular definition as a jury charge in State\r\n    v. Cherry, the definition illustrates the lack of evidence against\r\n  Petitioner.[4]Â \r\n  The State's key circumstantial evidence: (1) Petitioner's location in the\r\n  getaway car a relatively short time after the robbery; (2) Petitioner's flight\r\n  from law enforcement; and (3) Petitioner's attempt to enlist the assistance of\r\n  an uninvolved individual, do not point to his guilt for the crimes charged to\r\n  the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesisâ€”namely, the notion that he\r\n  did in fact join Dawkins at a gas station following the crime.Â Â  \r\nSimply put, the State offered\r\n  no direct evidence that Petitioner committed robbery in the first degree, grand\r\n  larceny, criminal conspiracy, or malicious injury.Â  However, substantial\r\n  circumstantial proof of Petitioner's involvement in one of the four offenses\r\n  would prove Petitioner's involvement as to all offenses.Â  The circumstantial\r\n  evidence presented by the State proves only that: (1) when stopped by the\r\n  sheriff's deputy, Petitioner was in the vehicle used by Dawkins and Bell to\r\n  leave the scene of the robbery; and that (2) following the stop, Petitioner\r\n  fled along with Dawkins and Bell.Â  \r\nThe State asks this Court to\r\n  uphold Petitioner's convictions based on evidence which does not satisfy the\r\n  standard adopted by this Court regarding the proof necessary in a\r\n  circumstantial evidence case.Â  See Bostick, 392 S.C. at 139-41, 708\r\n  S.E.2d at 777-78 (identifying three of this Court's seminal cases analyzing the\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence standard).Â Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circumstantial evidence\r\n  presented by the State does not reasonably tend to prove Petitioner's guilt,\r\n  and fails this Court's well-settled directive that circumstantial evidence that\r\n  is not substantial is insufficient to go to a jury.Â  Thus, we reverse the court\r\n  of appeals' decision affirming Petitioner's 2005 convictions.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED. \r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result\r\n  only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioner presents each of the four charges as separate issues in his appeal\r\n  to this Court.Â  However, the facts supporting the State's case against\r\n  Petitioner, and the propriety of the circuit court's refusal to direct a\r\n  verdict, are the same for each issue.Â  Thus, we address all four of\r\n  Petitioner's issues together.Â  \r\n[2] Bell refused to answer when asked what happened on the day of the burglary with\r\n  regard to Petitioner.Â  However, Bell testified that he was with Dawkins when\r\n  the home was burglarized, but that when they were later stopped by police,\r\n  Petitioner was with them.Â  Bell admitted that he never provided police a\r\n  statement implicating Petitioner.Â  \r\n[3] The State notes that Petitioner, Dawkins, and Bell are cousins.Â  The prosecutor\r\n  stated at trial that &quot;they're all cousins,&quot; and, &quot;[T]his\r\n  defendant, whose testimony is is [sic] cousins with with [sic] Derrick\r\n  Dawkins.Â  He's cousins and friends with Frederick Bell.Â  He's fromâ€”they're all\r\n  from Kings Mountain.&quot;Â  However, the State failed to present evidence of any\r\n  agreement or collusion between Petitioner, Dawkins, and Bell.Â  The existence of\r\n  a familial relationship between the three individuals does not affect the\r\n  validity of Dawkins's testimony or the analysis of the State's circumstantial\r\n  evidence.Â  In Lollis, this Court accepted the testimony of Lollis's\r\n  common law wife in finding that the State's evidence did not &quot;reasonably\r\n  tend&quot; to prove Lollis's guilt.Â  Lollis, 343 S.C. at 582, 541 S.E.2d\r\n  at 255.Â  In Bostick, the defendant's sisters testified that Bostick\r\n  argued with the victim and entered her house on the day the victim was killed\r\n  and her home burned.Â  Bostick, 392 S.C. at 138, 708 S.E.2d at 776.Â \r\n  However, this testimony did not elevate the State's circumstantial evidence\r\n  above &quot;mere suspicion.&quot;Â  Id. at 142, 708 S.E.2d at 778.Â  Thus,\r\n  it is clear that the simple and solitary fact that certain testimony comes from\r\n  a relative of the accused has not been shown to affect this Court's analysis of\r\n  whether circumstantial evidence is substantial.Â  \r\n[4] In State v. Grippon, this Court held if the jury is properly instructed\r\n  on reasonable doubt, it is unnecessary for the trial court to instruct the jury\r\n  that &quot;circumstantial evidence must be so strong as to exclude every other\r\n  reasonable hypothesis other than guilt.&quot; 327 S.C. 79, 83, 489 S.E.2d 462,\r\n  464 (1997).Â  This Court then recommended the following charge in cases relying\r\n  on circumstantial evidence:\r\n\r\n  Direct evidence is the testimony of\r\n    a person who asserts or claims to have actual knowledge of a fact . . . .\r\n    Circumstantial evidence is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances\r\n    indicating the existence of a fact.Â  The law makes absolutely no distinction\r\n    between the weight or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial\r\n    evidence . . . . Nor is a greater degree of certainty required of\r\n    circumstantial evidence than of direct evidence . . . . After weighing all the\r\n    evidence if you are not convinced of the guilt of the defendant by a reasonable\r\n    doubt, you must find [the defendant] not guilty.\r\n\r\nId. at 83-84, 489 S.E.2d at 464.Â  \r\nIn Cherry, this Court rejected the traditional\r\n  circumstantial evidence charge in favor of the Grippon charge.Â  Cherry,\r\n  361 S.C. at 601, 606 S.E.2d at 482 (holding that the traditional circumstantial\r\n  evidence definition served to confuse juries by leading them to believe that\r\n  the standard for measuring circumstantial evidence is different than that for\r\n  measuring direct evidence).\r\nHowever, the evaluation of circumstantial evidence\r\n  requires the connection of collateral facts in order to reach a conclusion, and\r\n  this process is not required when evaluating direct evidence.Â  Id. at\r\n  603, 606 S.E.2d at 483.Â  Thus, the traditional circumstantial evidence\r\n  definition provides more detailed information about the relation of\r\n  circumstantial evidence to the determination of guilt.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  definition does not, however, change the standard for evaluating evidence:\r\n  every circumstance must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
