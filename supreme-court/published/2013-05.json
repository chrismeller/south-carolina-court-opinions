Additionally, while we affirm the majority of the family court's\r\nequitable division, we reverse the inclusion of one tract of timber as marital\r\nproperty. We also reverse the reservation of alimony to the wife and modify that\r\nportion of the order which required the husband to pay $156,182 for the wife's\r\nattorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       Harriet Wilburn (Wife) and Paul Wilburn (Husband) were married in 1978,\r\nwhen Wife was twenty-five years old and Husband was twenty-nine years old. At\r\nthat time, Wife, a college graduate, was employed. Husband had graduated from\r\nlaw school and was employed in private practice.\r\n\r\n       The parties' first son was born in 1982. After his birth and by mutual\r\nagreement of the parties, Wife ceased working. Their second son was born in\r\n1984. Although Wife never returned to work, she made significant expenditures of\r\ntime and effort throughout the marriage caring for the children and running the\r\nhousehold. Around the time their second son was born, Husband became an\r\nassistant United States attorney, a position he held until 1994.\r\n\r\n       After his father's death in 1990, Husband inherited some shares of stock.\r\nWhen his mother died in 1991, he inherited additional stock and several parcels of\r\nreal property. Thereafter, Husband's health began to deteriorate, and he\r\nexperienced ulcers and depression. In 1994, he suffered a serious and debilitating\r\nstroke. Ultimately, he was paralyzed on the left side of his body. He also suffered\r\nsignificant mental impairment with only a quarter of his brain still functioning,\r\nresulting in spatial dyslexia and the inability to process chronologies or numbers.\r\nUpon being discharged from the hospital, Husband returned home where he was\r\ncared for by Wife and paid caretakers. He was never able to return to work and\r\nbegan receiving a monthly annuity payment from the federal government. Also,\r\nthe parties' home was not conducive to Husband's disability, so several years after\r\nhis stroke the parties moved to a new home designed specifically for handicap\r\naccessibility.\r\n\r\n      Prior to his stroke, Husband had opened account 9443 with Smith Barney.\r\nThe account was titled in his name only and managed by the parties' financial\r\nadvisor, Geddings Crawford. Shortly after the stroke, Wife and Crawford went to\r\n\na bank lockbox to remove stock certificates in Husband's name. At Husband's\r\ndirection, they placed the stocks from the lockbox and other securities in account\r\n9443. Husband then gave Wife power of attorney, and thereafter, she exercised\r\ncontrol over that account, writing checks from it as necessary to cover household\r\nexpenses. Additionally, other assets were placed in the account over the course of\r\ntheir marriage. For example, distributions from a charitable remainder trust and\r\nfunds from the parties' joint checking account were transferred into the account.\r\n\r\n       After Husband's stroke, the parties created the Wilburn Family Limited\r\nPartnership to which they both contributed assets. Husband and Wife each have a\r\none percent interest in the partnership and their sons have the remaining ninety-\r\neight percent. Husband is the general partner and can pay himself management\r\nfees at his discretion.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, the parties created the Paul E. Wilburn III Charitable\r\nRemainder Unitrust, an irrevocable trust, in order to provide them with money\r\nduring their lifetimes. Under the terms of the trust, Husband receives an annual\r\ndistribution in the amount of 7% of the value of the trust until his death, and then\r\nWife is to receive an identical distribution until her death, at which time the\r\nremainder goes to Presbyterian College.\r\n\r\n      In 2002, Wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. According to Wife,\r\nHusband's response to her illness was primarily concern as to who would care for\r\nhim. She underwent chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, as well as a\r\nhysterectomy. Eventually, the cancer went into remission, and in 2004 she finally\r\nbegan to feel she had recovered.\r\n\r\n       As Wife was coping with her own illness, she perceived Husband as having\r\nbecome paranoid, irritable, and obsessed with finding a cure for his paralysis.\r\nEventually, the marital relationship became unbearable for her. In 2008, she rented\r\nan apartment nearby, but remained in the marital home for five months thereafter\r\nto ensure Husband would be cared for when she left. In October of 2008, Wife left\r\nthe marital home, moved into her apartment, and filed a complaint for separate\r\nsupport and maintenance. Husband then revoked Wife's power of attorney. He\r\nalso opened two bank accounts—Palmetto Bank accounts 0109 and 8819—and\r\ntransferred the majority of the assets in account 9443 into those accounts.\r\n\r\n      Shortly after filing her initial complaint, Wife filed a motion to appoint a\r\nguardian ad litem for Husband and a motion to supplement the complaint to seek a\r\ndivorce and to bifurcate the issue of divorce from the other issues. The family\r\n\ncourt granted both motions and subsequently granted Wife a divorce based on one\r\nyear's separation. Following a trial on the remaining issues, the family court\r\nentered an order classifying the parties' assets as marital or nonmarital, dividing the\r\nmarital estate, reserving jurisdiction on the issue of alimony, and ordering Husband\r\nto pay Wife's attorney's fees and costs. Husband appealed, raising numerous issues\r\nrelated to the family court's identification of marital property, equitable division of\r\nthe marital estate, reservation of alimony to Wife, and award of attorney's fees and\r\ncosts.                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       This Court exercises de novo review over appeals in family court cases.\r\nLewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). However, we\r\nrecognize this broad scope of review does not alter the fact that a family court is\r\nbetter able to make credibility determinations because it has the opportunity to\r\nobserve the witnesses. Id. Additionally, the de novo standard does not relieve the\r\nappellant of the burden of identifying error in the family court's findings. Id.\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the family court will be upheld unless the Court finds\r\nthat a preponderance of the evidence weighs against the family court's decision.\r\nId.                              LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    EQUITABLE DIVISION\r\n\r\n      A.     Husband's Federal Annuity Payments\r\n     Husband contends the family court erred in classifying the monthly annuity\r\npayments he receives from the United States as marital property. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       Subject to certain exceptions, marital property is defined as \"all real and\r\npersonal property which has been acquired by the parties during marriage and\r\nwhich is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation.\"\r\nS.C. Code § 20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2011). When confronted with benefits, such as\r\nHusband's annuity, that are not specifically addressed by the statute, we look to\r\ntheir nature and purpose to determine if they are marital property. See, e.g.,\r\nTiffault v. Tiffault, 303 S.C. 391, 392-93, 401 S.E.2d 157, 158 (1991) (considering\r\nvested military retirement benefits); Hardwick v. Hardwick, 303 S.C. 256, 259-60,\r\n399 S.E.2d 791, 793 (Ct. App. 1990) (considering a vested retirement fund).\r\n\n       We have consistently held that a retirement benefit earned during the\r\nmarriage, whether vested or nonvested, is deferred compensation, and thus, is\r\nmarital property. See, e.g., Ball v. Ball, 314 S.C. 445, 447, 445 S.E.2d 449, 450\r\n(1994). A retirement benefit is marital property because spouses contribute to one\r\nanother's careers and both spouses defer assets they otherwise would have received\r\nduring the marriage in exchange for the benefit. Id. However, disability benefits\r\nare treated as income rather than marital property. Tinsley v. Tinsley, 326 S.C.\r\n374, 381-82, 483 S.E.2d 198, 202 (Ct. App. 1997). A disability benefit replaces\r\nthe income a spouse would earn were he or she not disabled, and thus, functions as\r\nincome, rather than as an asset earned during the course of the marriage. Id.\r\n\r\n      Here, the family court described the benefit as a pension Husband earned\r\nthrough his employment during the marriage. It found the pension was a disability\r\nbenefit following Husband's stroke, but converted to a pension when Husband\r\nreached the retirement age of sixty-two, which occurred shortly before the trial.\r\nAccordingly, the court held the annuity was a vested retirement benefit and thus,\r\nmarital property subject to equitable division; it ordered Husband to pay Wife fifty\r\npercent of all monies he received from the pension.\r\n\r\n        While Husband did begin receiving the annuity payments when he became\r\ndisabled following his stroke, the record establishes by a preponderance of the\r\nevidence that the benefit was and always has been a retirement benefit. Wife\r\ntestified she understood the benefit to be a pension and that Husband was able to\r\naccess the money earlier than the normal retirement date because of his disability.\r\nIn other words, she believed he received the benefits because he became eligible\r\nfor and took early retirement due to his disability. Wife also testified that she\r\nunderstood the benefit as converting to a retirement benefit when Husband reached\r\nage sixty-two. Husband offered no evidence as to the nature of the annuity\r\npayments.\r\n\r\n       More importantly, the records produced by the United States Office of\r\nPersonnel Management which administers Husband's annuity indicate it was a\r\nretirement benefit. Those records, which were introduced by Wife, contain an\r\n\"Application for Immediate Retirement\" completed by Husband shortly after his\r\nstroke. The application asked \"Is this an application for disability retirement?\" and\r\nHusband indicated it was. The records also repeatedly refer to the annuity as a\r\n\"disability retirement\" and state that \"disability retirement is a lifetime benefit.\"\r\nThe records make clear that the benefit comes from Husband's participation in the\r\nCivil Service Retirement System. Also, contrary to the family court's finding, the\r\n\nrecords contain no indication that the benefit converted to another form when\r\nHusband reached age sixty-two.\r\n\r\n       Therefore, while we disagree with the family court judge that the character\r\nof the annuity Husband began receiving upon his disability changed when he\r\nturned sixty-two, we conclude the preponderance of the evidence establishes it was\r\na retirement benefit which he received early because of his disability. Thus, we\r\nhold the benefit was properly classified as marital property, and affirm the family\r\ncourt as modified.\r\n\r\n      B. \t Smith Barney Account 9443 and Palmetto Bank Accounts 0109\r\n           and 8819\r\n\r\n      Husband contends the family court erred in finding that Smith Barney\r\naccount 9443 and Palmetto Bank accounts 0109 and 8819 were marital property.\r\nHe asserts the accounts were nonmarital from inception because they only contain\r\nhis nonmarital property, specifically stocks he inherited, and because the accounts\r\ndid not undergo transmutation. We find the record does not support Husband's\r\ncontentions and accordingly affirm the classification of the accounts as marital\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n       A party claiming an equitable interest in property upon divorce bears the\r\nburden of proving the property is marital. Miller v. Miller, 293 S.C. 69, 71 n.2,\r\n358 S.E.2d 710, 711 n.2 (1987). If the party presents evidence to show the\r\nproperty is marital, the burden shifts to the other spouse to present evidence to\r\nestablish the property's nonmarital character. Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289,\r\n294, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\n\r\n       The family court found there was no evidence of which specific securities\r\nwere used to create account 9443, and while there was evidence that some of the\r\nsecurities in the account were inherited, there was also evidence that other\r\nsecurities in the account were purchased during the marriage and in exchange for\r\nmarital assets, thus rendering them marital property. Additionally, the court found\r\nthe account became marital property through transmutation because of how the\r\naccount was used and controlled.\r\n\r\n        We find Wife satisfied her burden of proving account 9443 was marital. She\r\ntestified the account was funded not only with stocks Husband inherited but also\r\nwith stocks he purchased during the marriage, distributions from the charitable\r\nremainder trust, and funds from a joint checking account. Additionally, their\r\nfinancial advisor, Crawford, testified that when he started working for the parties,\r\n\naccount 9443 was a longstanding account with his firm that contained between a\r\nquarter and a half million dollars in assets, and he and Wife collected the stock\r\ncertificates from the lockbox and placed them in the account after Husband's\r\nstroke. He testified that the stock certificates were all in Husband's name, but\r\notherwise he did not provide any details as to their origins.\r\n\r\n       The burden thus shifted to Husband to establish the nonmarital character of\r\nthe account. Husband asserts the only assets placed in account 9443 were stocks\r\nhe inherited, and property a party acquires through inheritance is not marital\r\nproperty. S.C. Code § 20-3-630(A)(1). However, Husband testified that account\r\n9443 could also contain stocks his mother gave to Wife, Wife's nonmarital stocks,\r\nand stocks he purchased using income earned from his employment during the\r\nmarriage. Thus, Husband's own testimony was contradictory as to the character of\r\nthe assets in account 9443, and he did not carry his burden of establishing it\r\ncontained only his nonmarital property. Therefore, we agree with the family court\r\nthat Smith Barney account 9443 was marital property. Because the two Palmetto\r\nBank accounts were funded solely from account 9443, those accounts were also\r\nmarital property. Having found account 9443 was marital property from its\r\ninception, we need not consider the family court's alternate holding that the\r\naccount underwent transmutation. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\nInc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (declining to address the\r\nremaining issues where a prior issue was dispositive).\r\n\r\n      C.     The McDonald Tract\r\n      Husband argues the family court erred in finding the McDonald Tract, a\r\ntimber farm he inherited from his mother and valued at $740,710, had become\r\nmarital property through transmutation. We agree.\r\n\r\n      Property that is nonmarital when acquired may be transmuted into marital\r\nproperty if it becomes so commingled with marital property that it is no longer\r\ntraceable, is titled jointly, or is used by the parties in support of the marriage or in\r\nsome other way that establishes the parties' intent to make it marital property.\r\nTrimnal v. Trimnal, 287 S.C. 495, 497-98, 339 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1986).\r\n\r\n      The family court found the McDonald Tract became marital property\r\nthrough transmutation due to Wife's contributions to the management of the\r\nproperty and the use of proceeds from the property in support of the marriage.\r\nWhile Wife testified that she devoted considerable time to managing the tract,\r\nHusband disputed the extent to which she did so. He testified he made all of the\r\n\ndecisions in consultation with the forester, Charles Sibley. Sibley testified that\r\nboth parties managed the property. Proceeds from timber sales from the property\r\nwere deposited into the parties' joint checking account. When the value of the joint\r\nchecking account exceeded $100,000, Wife took money from the account and\r\ndeposited it into Smith Barney account 9443.\r\n\r\n       First, Wife's contributions to the management of the property are not\r\nsufficient to establish transmutation. While the expenditure of time and labor on\r\nproperty may be some evidence of the intent of the parties to treat property as\r\nmarital, it alone is not enough to establish intent. See Pruitt v. Pruitt, 389 S.C.\r\n250, 263, 697 S.E.2d 702, 709 (Ct. App. 2010) (holding the wife's labor in\r\nfinishing the construction of the marital home did not show the husband's intent to\r\ntreat the home as marital property); Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 158, 439\r\nS.E.2d 312, 315 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding the wife's labor in improving the marital\r\nhome over seventeen years did not establish transmutation because \"contributions\r\nof time and labor do not necessarily prove transmutation\").\r\n\r\n       Also, the use of income from the property in support of the marriage does\r\nnot establish transmutation. This issue was addressed in Peterkin v. Peterkin, 293\r\nS.C. 311, 360 S.E.2d 311 (1987), where the husband inherited and received as gifts\r\ncertain real estate, and the wife claimed the properties underwent transmutation in\r\npart because income from the properties was placed in the parties' joint account\r\nand used for family expenses. Id. at 313, 360 S.E.2d at 312. This Court held that\r\nwhile the use of property in support of a marriage is relevant to transmutation, the\r\nmere use of income from nonmarital assets does not transmute those assets into\r\nmarital property and is not relevant to transmutation. Id. at 313, 360 S.E.2d at 313.\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, we find Wife's contributions to the management of the\r\nproperty and the use of income from the property in support of the marriage do not\r\nestablish transmutation. Therefore, the McDonald Tract was Husband's nonmarital\r\nproperty, and the family court erred in identifying it as marital property.\r\n\r\n         D.    Wife's Nonmarital Assets\r\n       Husband argues the family court erred in classifying three accounts, Smith\r\nBarney account 9515, Bank of America money market account 9902, and Bank of\r\nAmerica certificate of deposit 5004, as Wife's nonmarital assets.1 He asserts Wife\r\nfailed to produce sufficient evidence to establish the source of the funds in the\r\n\r\n1   The total value of these three accounts at the time of trial was $379,529.\r\n\naccounts and that the court improperly placed the burden on him to establish the\r\nmarital nature of the assets. We disagree.\r\n\r\n      Wife presented testimony that the funds in each of the three disputed\r\naccounts were nonmarital property because they were inherited, gifted, or acquired\r\nbefore the marriage. See S.C. Code § 20-3-630(A) (excepting these properties\r\nfrom marital property). Husband adduced no evidence to contradict this testimony.\r\nInstead, Husband argues her testimony was insufficient because she failed to\r\npresent any documentary evidence. However, Wife's testimony, absent any\r\nevidence to the contrary, is sufficient to establish the source of the funds in these\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n       Husband also argues the family court erred by accepting Wife's testimony\r\nconcerning the source of the funds in her accounts when it did not accept his\r\ntestimony concerning the source of the funds in Smith Barney account 9443. Thus,\r\naccording to Husband, the family court unfairly manipulated the burden of proof\r\nagainst him. Husband's argument overlooks the evidence presented as to those\r\nassets. As noted, Husband did not contest Wife's testimony that the assets in her\r\naccounts were nonmarital. His failure to offer evidence controverting Wife's\r\ntestimony is sufficient justification to affirm the family court. See Honea v.\r\nHonea, 292 S.C. 456, 357 S.E.2d 191 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"[A] party cannot sit back\r\nat trial without offering proof, then come to this Court complaining of the\r\ninsufficiency of the evidence to support the family court's findings.\"). Regarding\r\naccount 9443, Wife testified that it was funded in part by marital assets, and\r\nHusband conceded that could well be the case. Husband's concession as to the\r\ncharacter of some of the assets used to fund this account together with Wife's\r\ntestimony are enough to support affirming the family court on this issue.\r\nAccordingly, we find no error in the classification of these accounts, respectively,\r\nas marital and nonmarital property.\r\n\r\n      E.     Trust Distributions\r\n       Husband also claims the family court erred in treating his distributions from\r\nthe irrevocable Paul Wilburn III Charitable Remainder Unitrust as marital property\r\nand ordering him to pay Wife half of all distributions he receives. He asserts that\r\nthe trust cannot be marital property because neither party owns the trust. 2 While\r\n\r\n2 Husband also contends the family court erred because the spendthrift provision of\r\nthe trust prohibits the allocation of distributions to Wife and the marital property\r\nstatute excludes from marital property any property excluded by written contract.\r\n\nwe agree that the trust was not marital property, we find the trust distributions are a\r\nmarital asset subject to equitable division and accordingly affirm the family court.\r\n\r\n       While this is an issue of first impression in South Carolina, courts in other\r\njurisdictions have held that trust distributions were marital property. For example,\r\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court considered an order holding that the corpus of\r\na trust was not marital property but the right to receive distributions from the trust\r\nwas marital property. In re Chamberlin, 918 A.2d 1 (N.H. 2007). Compared to\r\nSouth Carolina's statutory definition of marital property, the New Hampshire court\r\nemployed the more expansive definition contained in that state's statute under\r\nwhich any property belonging to either spouse, regardless of title, is marital\r\nproperty.3 Id. at 4. The court held that a trust creates separate legal interests, one\r\nin the trust corpus and another in the distributions. Id. at 5. The court also held\r\nthat once the parties placed property in the trust, they no longer owned that\r\nproperty, and therefore, the corpus was not marital property. Id. at 4. However, it\r\nheld that the right to receive distributions from the trust was marital property. Id.\r\nat 5.  The Vermont Supreme Court, applying a definition of marital property\r\nsimilar to New Hampshire's, as any property owned by a spouse, held that the right\r\nto receive distributions from a trust was marital property. Chilkott v. Chilkott, 607\r\nA.2d 883 (Vt. 1992). The trust there was similar to the trust at issue here, in that\r\nupon the death of his mother, the husband was entitled to receive distributions\r\nfrom the trust, and upon his death, the wife was to receive distributions from the\r\ntrust. Id. at 883-84. The husband argued his interest in the trust was not marital\r\nproperty because he did not own the trust. Id. at 884. The court concluded the\r\n\r\n\r\nHusband did not present that argument to the family court, and therefore, it is not\r\npreserved for our review. See State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 113, 485 S.E.2d 360,\r\n363 (1997) (holding an appellant cannot argue one ground at trial and then another\r\nground on appeal).\r\n3 The South Carolina Code defines marital property as \"all real and personal\r\nproperty which has been acquired by the parties during marriage and which is\r\nowned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . .\" S.C.\r\nCode § 20-3-630. The statute then excludes from marital property all property\r\nacquired by \"inheritance, devise, bequest, or gift from a party other than the\r\nspouse,\" acquired before or after the marriage, property acquired in exchange for\r\nsuch property, excluded by written contract of the parties, and any increase in\r\nvalue of such property. Id.\r\n\nparties owned an interest in the trust distributions and that interest was marital\r\nproperty. Id. at 883.\r\n\r\n       The parties did not direct us to any cases holding that trust distributions were\r\nnot marital property, and we have found none. Therefore, while we hold the trust\r\ncorpus is not the property of either spouse and thus cannot be marital property, we\r\nhold that trust distributions can be marital property depending on how and when\r\nthe interest was acquired or if the interest has undergone transmutation.4\r\n\r\n       While the family court here was not explicit, we conclude it found the trust\r\ndistributions had undergone transmutation because it based its holding on findings\r\nthat the intent behind the creation of the trust was to provide the parties with\r\nincome during their lifetimes and that distributions from the trust were deposited\r\ninto Smith Barney account 9443. The family court found, and Wife's testimony\r\nestablished, that the trust was created with the intent to provide for Husband and\r\nWife for the remainder of their lives. That intent was also evidenced by the terms\r\nof the trust that provided distributions to Husband for life and then to Wife for life\r\nfollowing Husband's death. The distributions were deposited into Smith Barney\r\naccount 9443, and the funds in that account were used in support of the marriage.\r\nAdditionally, Husband was clearly aware that the distributions were being used in\r\nsupport of the marriage because he attended yearly meetings discussing the\r\nperformance of that account and the parties' anticipated future needs. Taking these\r\nfacts together, we find the parties intended, from the time the trust was created, to\r\ntreat the right to receive distributions as marital property; therefore, transmutation\r\nwas established. Accordingly, we affirm the family court's finding that the right to\r\nreceive distributions was marital property.\r\n\r\n      F.     The Marital Home\r\n       Husband contends the family court erred in arbitrarily dividing the marital\r\nhome. Specifically, Husband asserts the court awarded him the home but then\r\neffectively rescinded that award by requiring him to pay Wife almost the entire\r\nvalue of the home.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Due to the expansive definition of marital property in New Hampshire and\r\nVermont as any property owned by a spouse, once those courts found a spouse had\r\na legal interest in trust distributions, the distributions were also deemed to be\r\nmarital property. Our State's narrower definition of marital property causes our\r\nholding to also be narrower.\r\n\n       Husband also contends the court erred because the apportionment deprived\r\nhim of his $60,958 in nonmarital equity in the home. In apportioning the marital\r\nproperty, the family court awarded the home to Husband and ordered him to pay\r\nWife $500,000 at the earlier of the sale of the home or thirty days after the entry of\r\nthe final order. The family court also assigned Husband $60,958 as his nonmarital\r\nproperty for the reduction in the mortgage balance which resulted from payments\r\nHusband made after the date of filing and before trial. Husband asserts that the\r\nhome was worth $512,814 at the time of trial, and thus by apportioning $512,814\r\nto the parties as marital property, the court deprived him of the $60,958 in\r\nnonmarital equity because the entire value of the home had already been\r\napportioned.\r\n\r\n       We find no error in the apportionment of the marital home. Initially, we\r\nnote that the family court's award of the home to Husband combined with the order\r\nto pay Wife was not in error. In order to make an in-kind distribution of the home\r\nto Husband and effect the equitable division deemed appropriate, the family court\r\nrequired him to pay a sum of money to Wife. Although the order stated the lump\r\nsum payment could be satisfied through the sale of the home, it also gave Husband\r\nthe option of paying Wife within ninety days presumably from other funds or the\r\nliquidation of another asset. It was Husband's choice as to how to satisfy the\r\nobligation. Accordingly, we reject Husband's argument that the family court\r\nawarded him the marital home and then effectively rescinded that award by\r\nrequiring him to make a payment to Wife in an amount close to the total value of\r\nthe home.\r\n\r\n       Husband introduced a schedule of marital assets listing the value of the\r\nhome both on the date of filing and date of trial as $512,814. However, he\r\npresented no evidence in support of that value. Wife also presented a schedule of\r\nassets, which stated the fair market value of the home was $810,000 on the date of\r\nfiling, but subject to a mortgage balance of $297,186, for a value to the parties of\r\n$512,814. Her schedule listed the value of the home on the date of trial as\r\n$573,772, and stated the change in value was due to payments made against the\r\nmortgage during the pendency of action. In support, Wife introduced an appraisal\r\nof the home completed near the date of filing, listing the value as $810,000. She\r\nalso introduced a mortgage loan statement contemporaneous with the date of filing\r\nstating the principal balance was $297,185.83, and a statement contemporaneous\r\nwith the date of trial stating the principal balance was $236,227.61. The parties\r\nagree and the court found that Husband paid down the mortgage balance on the\r\nhome by $60,958 during the action. Thus, accepting the only evidence presented,\r\nthe family court must have concluded the value of the home was $573,772 at the\r\n\ntime of trial. The family court therefore did not deprive Husband of any of his\r\nnonmarital asset of increased equity in the home by apportioning $573,772 as\r\nmarital and nonmarital assets to the parties. Accordingly, we affirm the family\r\ncourt's apportionment of the marital home.\r\n\r\n      G.     Overall Equitable Division of the Marital Estate\r\n       Husband contends the family court erred in apportioning the marital estate\r\nbecause he contributed the majority of the property to the marriage through his\r\ninheritances. He asserts he should have received more than approximately one-\r\nhalf of the marital estate and proposes that he receive sixty percent of the estate.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n       Upon divorce, the family court is required to make a final equitable\r\napportionment of the marital estate, and in making the apportionment the court is\r\nrequired to consider fifteen statutory factors. S.C. Code § 20-3-620 (Supp. 2011).\r\nOn appeal, we must review the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if\r\nequitable, we will uphold it regardless of whether we would have weighed specific\r\nfactors differently. Roberson v. Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 389, 597 S.E.2d 840, 842\r\n(Ct. App. 2004). In short, the family court's apportionment will not be overturned\r\non appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 329,\r\n461 S.E.2d 39, 41-42 (1995).\r\n\r\n       Here, after resolving the parties' disputes as to the marital versus nonmarital\r\nnature of their property, the family court set out \"Schedule 4\" which apportioned\r\nthe marital assets. Of the $3,888,758 in assets and debts for which the family court\r\nidentified a value, the court awarded Wife $1,744,765.50 or 45% and awarded\r\nHusband $2,143,992.50 or 55%.5\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Schedule 4 stated that Wife was to receive $1,744,768 and Husband was to\r\nreceive $2,143,995, but those totals reflect a slight addition error. Also, we note\r\nthe family court gave each party half of four marital assets without stating a value\r\nfor those assets: the parties' one percent interest in the Wilburn Limited\r\nPartnership, the distributions from the federal annuity, the distributions from the\r\nPaul E. Wilburn III Charitable Remainder Trust, and the Smith Barney #607-18926\r\nPaul E. Wilburn III TTEE FBO I. Remainder Trust. While those assets are\r\nrelevant under the statutory factors for apportionment and to the extent possible we\r\nconsider them, they were not included in the family court's consideration of the\r\ntotal amount of marital property awarded to each party either because no evidence\r\n\n        The family court made extensive factual findings and generally considered\r\nall fifteen statutory factors. In particular, the family court found Wife was able to\r\nobtain employment but faced great difficulty in doing so due to her lack of skills\r\nand long absence from the workforce. Husband neither was employed, nor could\r\nhe gain employment due to his disability. However, the family court also found\r\nHusband had an income of $9,250 per month, or $111,000 per year, from various\r\nassets and could increase his income by paying himself a management fee for\r\nserving as general partner of the Wilburn Limited Partnership or by cutting timber\r\nhe owned. The family court found Wife had income of approximately $1,000 per\r\nmonth from a family partnership held by her family and she was capable of earning\r\napproximately $1,300 per month through employment. Related to their ability to\r\nearn income was the parties' health. Wife's cancer was in remission at the time of\r\ntrial and she was otherwise in good health. Husband was permanently disabled\r\nfrom his stroke and suffered from a long history of depression. Additionally, after\r\nthe family court's equitable apportionment, the parties would each receive\r\napproximately $1,532.52 per month from the federal annuity and $1,975.08 per\r\nmonth from the Paul E. Wilburn III Charitable Remainder Trust.\r\n\r\n        The value of the marital property was $3,888,758, and the majority of those\r\nassets were acquired through Husband's inheritances. The family court found\r\nHusband had $614,344 and Wife had $346,297 in nonmarital assets. The parties\r\nalso had minimal debts in relation to their assets. While the family court did not\r\nstate its reasons for doing so, it awarded the marital home to Husband. However,\r\nas previously discussed, the court gave Husband the option of keeping the home or\r\nselling it, and thus, Husband cannot complain about the court's consideration of\r\nthis factor. Neither party was awarded separate maintenance or alimony.\r\n\r\n      Additionally, in light of our holding with respect to the McDonald Tract, the\r\nmarital estate will now be significantly smaller and Husband's nonmarital assets\r\nwill be significantly larger. Thus, following this appeal, Wife has an even greater\r\nneed for a large portion of the marital estate.\r\n\r\n      In conclusion, we find no abuse of discretion in the family court's\r\napportionment. Unquestionably, Husband contributed the majority of the assets\r\nand has serious medical expenses, however, this was a thirty year marriage and\r\nWife spent many years contributing to the marriage as well as caring for Husband\r\nin addition to the parties' children. While Wife was not awarded alimony due to\r\n\r\nas to their value was presented at trial or they are assets that provide recurring\r\npayments subject to fluctuation.\r\n\nthe size and apportionment of the marital estate as well as husband's disability,\r\nthere is no question she otherwise would have been a candidate for permanent\r\nalimony. Because of all these circumstances, we affirm the family court's\r\nequitable division of the marital estate of 45% to Wife and 55% to Husband.\r\n\r\nII.   RESERVATION OF JURISDICTION ON ALIMONY\r\n      Husband contends the family court erred in reserving jurisdiction to award\r\nWife alimony because there were no exigent circumstances present to justify the\r\nreservation. We agree.\r\n\r\n       Alimony may be reserved where the family court identifies circumstances\r\nthat are likely to create a need for alimony in the reasonably near future. Donahue\r\nv. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 363, 384 S.E.2d 741, 747 (1989). Where a spouse does\r\nnot need alimony at the time of trial and there is no evidence the spouse has an\r\nillness, the spouse's needs will foreseeably change in the near future, or some other\r\nextenuating circumstance, it is error to reserve jurisdiction on alimony. Id.\r\n\r\n       At trial, Wife testified that if she received her requested apportionment of\r\nthe marital estate, she did not want alimony, but that if the requested division was\r\nnot awarded, she would need alimony. Additionally, Wife's counsel stated to the\r\nfamily court that alimony would only be appropriate if the family court or an\r\nappellate court did not agree with Wife's proposed apportionment of the marital\r\nestate. Wife presented no evidence of physical or mental illness, foreseeable future\r\nneed, or other extenuating circumstances. While she testified she had suffered\r\nfrom breast cancer in the past, she did not assert the cancer as a reason to reserve\r\nalimony. She also testified the cancer was in remission and she had been healthy\r\nfor several years prior to the trial.\r\n\r\n       The family court held that due to the equitable apportionment of the marital\r\nproperty, the parties would each have sufficient assets to provide for them and\r\nalimony was not necessary. However, the court reserved the issue of alimony if,\r\non appeal, the equitable apportionment was not upheld as provided in the final\r\norder. Thus, the family court reserved the issue of alimony solely on the basis that\r\nits equitable division might be altered on appeal.\r\n\r\n        While we appreciate the dilemma in which Wife could find herself if her\r\nequitable division award was drastically altered on appeal, we decline to hold that\r\npossible changes in equitable apportionment on appeal constitute a sufficient\r\njustification for the reservation of alimony. Were we to hold otherwise, the\r\nreservation of alimony would be appropriate in every case and our prior case law\r\n\non the reservation of alimony would be superfluous. Accordingly, we hold the\r\nfamily court erred in reserving jurisdiction on alimony.\r\n\r\nIII.   ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS\r\n       Finally, Husband contends the family court erred in ordering Husband to pay\r\nall $156,182 of Wife's attorney's fees and costs because the court did not consider\r\nthe required factors, and even to the extent the court did properly consider the\r\nfactors, it reached an erroneous result. In light of our holdings herein, the\r\nbeneficial results obtained by Wife and the parties' respective financial conditions\r\nhave markedly changed. See E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d\r\n812, 816 (1992) (listing the factors to be considered in determining whether to\r\nmake an award); Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315\r\n(1991) (listing the factors to be considered in determining the amount of an award).\r\nTherefore, we conclude the attorney's fee award should be reduced and Husband\r\nshall pay only half of Wife's attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n      For the reasons set forth, we affirm in part and reverse in part the family\r\ncourt order. We affirm the classification of Husband's annuity payments, account\r\n9443, the Palmetto Bank accounts, and the trust distributions as marital property,\r\nthe classification of Wife's three accounts as her nonmarital property, the\r\napportionment of the marital home, and the ratio used to divide the marital estate.\r\nHowever, we conclude the family court erred in finding the McDonald Tract was\r\nmarital property and in reserving jurisdiction on the issue of alimony. Also, we\r\nreduce the award of attorney's fees and costs to $78,091.\r\n\r\n       We modify the family court's equitable apportionment by removing the\r\nMcDonald Tract, valued at $740,710, from the marital estate and deeming it\r\nHusband's nonmarital property. That modification reduces the marital estate from\r\n$3,888,763 to $3,148,053. In order to effect the 45%/55% equitable division\r\nordered by the family court, we reduce the $500,000 payment Husband was\r\nordered to make to Wife to $171,856.10. In total, in addition to the approximately\r\n$3,507.60 per month Wife will receive from Husband's federal annuity and trust\r\ndistributions, Wife shall receive $1,416,621.60 of the marital assets identified on\r\nSchedule 4, and Husband shall receive $1,731,426.40.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.

Bauknight as\r\npersonal representative and trustee. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\n                                     I. FACTS\r\n\r\n     James Brown (\"Brown\"), a singer and entertainer known as \"The Hardest-\r\nWorking Man in Show Business\" and \"The Godfather of Soul,\" died in Atlanta,\r\nGeorgia on December 25, 2006. Brown left an estate widely estimated to be worth\r\nanywhere from $5 million to over $100 million that is at the heart of this dispute\r\namong numerous parties.\r\n\r\n       By will dated August 1, 2000, Brown devised all of his personal and\r\nhousehold effects to six adult named children: Deanna J. Brown Thomas, Yamma\r\nN. Brown, Vanisha Brown, Daryl J. Brown, Larry Brown, and Terry Brown.\r\nBrown left the remainder of his estate to The James Brown 2000 Irrevocable Trust\r\nvia a pour-over provision in his will.\r\n\r\n       Brown created the 2000 Irrevocable Trust under a separate agreement, also\r\ndated August 1, 2000, as part of his estate plan to provide financial assistance for\r\nthe education of his grandchildren and disadvantaged youths. The agreement\r\ncreating the 2000 Irrevocable Trust includes Schedule A, which indicates Brown\r\nplaced his long-time residence at Beech Island, Aiken County, and other assets in\r\nthe trust as part of its initial funding, although the record contains some\r\ndiscrepancies as to the timing of the transfers.\r\n\r\n        Albert H. Dallas, Alfred1 A. Bradley, and David G. Cannon were named as\r\nthe co-personal representatives of Brown's estate and as the co-trustees of the 2000\r\nIrrevocable Trust. In the trust document, Brown created an Advisory Board,\r\ninitially to be comprised of three members, who were to confer with and advise the\r\n\r\n1 Bradley's first name also appears as \"Alford\" in various documents in the record,\r\nincluding Brown's will and trust. We further note variations exist in the record\r\nregarding the spelling of the names of Vanisha Brown (also \"Venisha\") and\r\nTommie Rae Hynie Brown (also \"Tomi Rae Hynie\" and \"Tommie Rae Hyne\").\r\nThe names herein are as they appear in the case caption presented to this Court.\r\n\ntrustees in a manner consistent with Brown's objectives for the trust. There were\r\nalso provisions regarding trustee succession, which required three trustees to serve\r\nat all times.\r\n\r\n       Upon Brown's death, the principal and income contained in the 2000\r\nIrrevocable Trust, as augmented by Brown's general estate, was to be divided, by\r\nits terms, into two \"shares\" or subtrusts: (1) The Brown Family Education Trust\r\n(\"Family Trust\"), which was capped in the amount of $2 million for tax purposes\r\nand designated for the education of Brown's grandchildren; and (2) The James\r\nBrown \"I Feel Good\" Trust (\"Charitable Trust\"), which Brown declared \"shall be\r\nused solely for the tuition, educational expenses, and financial assistance of . . .\r\npoor and financially needy children, youth, or young adults (Who are both\r\nqualified and deserving) who seek and have need of such assistance to obtain and\r\nfurther their education at the many educational entities and/or institutions available\r\nin the States of South Carolina and Georgia.\" Thus, Brown's estate planning\r\ndocuments indicate Brown intended the bulk of his wealth to be used to support the\r\nCharitable Trust.\r\n\r\n       Brown's will and trust each contained a no-contest clause, which provided\r\nthat any beneficiary who challenged the will or the 2000 Irrevocable Trust \"shall\r\nforfeit his or her entire interest thereunder.\" Brown noted in both documents that\r\nthe persons described therein, i.e., the six named children and their legitimate\r\nissue, comprised \"the entire class . . . acknowledge[d] to be [his] heirs and issue.\"\r\nBrown expressly disavowed any other potential beneficiaries, stating, \"I have\r\nintentionally failed to provide for any other relatives or other persons, whether\r\nclaiming, or to claim, to be an heir of mine or not.\" Brown stated any person not\r\nprovided for in his will or trust \"whether or not claiming to be a beneficiary, party\r\nin interest, or otherwise shall not have standing or be qualified to contest, claim an\r\ninterest in or otherwise dispute the disposition of [his] estate as he herewith\r\ndisclaims and disinherits any such person.\" Brown stated that any challenge by\r\nsuch persons to the disposition of his estate or the validity of the documents would\r\n\"be considered an affront to [his] wishes,\" and \"shall be vigorously challenged as\r\nsuch by his fiduciaries.\" In the trust agreement, Brown declared that he was not\r\nthen married and that he did not want the trust estate to ever go to a spouse: \"It is\r\nthe Grantor's [Brown's] intention that the trust estate be available only to the\r\nbeneficiaries and not . . . the Grantor's past or future spouse. The Trustee(s) are\r\ndirected to enforce this provision.\"\r\n\r\n     Thereafter, on November 27, 2001, Brown and Tommie Rae Hynie\r\n(\"Tommie Rae\") executed a Prenuptial Agreement in which Tommie Rae\r\n\nacknowledged that she was entering the agreement knowingly and voluntarily and\r\nthat she had the opportunity to receive the advice of counsel of her own choosing.\r\nTommie Rae waived any right to Brown's property or the receipt of alimony in the\r\nevent of a separation or divorce from Brown, and she agreed to waive any claim\r\nfor an interest in his estate in the event of his death, including the rights to a\r\nstatutory share of Brown's estate or to any interest as an omitted spouse.\r\n\r\n       On December 14, 2001, Brown and Tommie Rae participated in a marriage\r\nceremony in Aiken County. In 2004, Brown brought annulment proceedings\r\nagainst Tommie Rae after discovering that she had participated in a marriage\r\nceremony in Texas in 1997 with another individual, Javed Ahmed. Brown\r\nattached documents to his pleadings showing Tommie Rae had not been granted an\r\nannulment of the prior marriage until April 15, 2004. Tommie Rae counterclaimed\r\nfor a divorce from Brown on the ground of physical cruelty, and in his reply,\r\nBrown sought genetic testing of a son, respondent \"James B.,\" born to Tommie\r\nRae on June 11, 2001. The parties dismissed their respective suits in a consent\r\norder filed August 16, 2004, in which Tommie Rae agreed to \"forever waive any\r\nclaim of a common law marriage to [Brown], both now and in the future.\" The\r\nparties thereafter had an on-and-off-again relationship up until Brown's death on\r\nDecember 25, 2006.\r\n\r\n       In 2007, five of the six adult children Brown named in his will as well as\r\nTommie Rae, all Respondents herein, brought actions to set aside Brown's will and\r\nthe 2000 Irrevocable Trust based on undue influence. They alleged Brown's estate\r\nshould, instead, pass by the laws of intestate succession. Tommie Rae claimed that\r\nshe was entitled to an elective share or an omitted spouse's share of Brown's estate\r\nand that her son, James B. (via a guardian ad litem), was entitled to a share of the\r\nestate as an omitted child. The probate court transferred these claims and all\r\nfilings thereafter to the circuit court.\r\n\r\n       Appellants were initially appointed by the circuit court in March 2007 as\r\nSpecial Administrators with limited duties to oversee the handling of Brown's\r\nestate after petitions were filed by some of Brown's family members seeking the\r\nremoval of Dallas, Bradley, and Cannon as personal representatives. The court\r\nmade the selection after the parties could not agree on who should be appointed.\r\nUltimately, the three original fiduciaries either resigned or were removed from\r\ntheir positions as personal representatives and trustees.2\r\n\r\n2 The three left amid allegations that Cannon had misappropriated funds belonging\r\nto Brown. Bradley is now deceased. In 2011, Cannon entered a plea under North\r\n\n      In November 2007, the circuit court appointed Appellants as the personal\r\nrepresentatives for Brown's estate and as trustees of the 2000 Irrevocable Trust,\r\nwith full authority as if they had been appointed in the original placement order.\r\nThe South Carolina Attorney General (\"AG\"), who had recently intervened in the\r\ncase on the ground the claims involved a charitable trust, unsuccessfully opposed\r\nthe appointment of Appellants as fiduciaries.3\r\n\r\n       After ongoing negotiations directed by the AG, the parties entered into a\r\ncompromise agreement at an informal mediation session on August 10, 2008. The\r\nsettling parties named in the agreement were Tommie Rae, the children and\r\ngrandchildren of Brown, and the AG. Appellants contend they did not participate\r\nin the discussions or in the agreement as they received no notice of them. The\r\nagreement was thereafter submitted to the circuit court for its approval pursuant to\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-1102 (2009). Appellants were given notice of the\r\nagreement and participated in all proceedings related to the court's consideration of\r\nthe compromise.\r\n\r\n       In January 2009, the circuit court appointed Russell L. Bauknight, a certified\r\npublic accountant, as Special Administrator for Brown's estate and Special Trustee\r\nof the 2000 Irrevocable Trust. Bauknight was appointed, at the Respondents'\r\nsuggestion, for the limited purpose of providing input and recommendations to the\r\ncourt regarding the compromise agreement. The circuit court ordered Appellants\r\nto continue in their fiduciary capacities at that time, except for the limited duties\r\nassigned to Bauknight.\r\n\r\n       A hearing was conducted over seven days from January to April 2009. At\r\nthe first hearing date on January 30th, the parties advised the circuit court that\r\nRespondent Terry Brown, one of the six children Brown named in his will, had\r\n\r\nCarolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970) to charges of taking money from Brown,\r\nfor which he was sentenced to house arrest. The prosecuting authority did not seek\r\nrestitution from Cannon although Cannon reportedly retained a million-dollar\r\nmansion in Honduras as well as an interest in Brown's publishing companies.\r\n3  Although references herein are to the \"AG\" generally, the current AG's\r\npredecessor handled most of the filings in this matter, including the motion to\r\nintervene, which the circuit court granted, without objection, on October 11, 2007.\r\nThe court also granted the Georgia AG's motion to intervene, but the Georgia AG\r\nis no longer participating in the action, as it was later determined South Carolina's\r\nAG was the appropriate and necessary party.\r\n\njoined in the compromise, so that the agreement now included an addendum. In\r\nexchange for his participation, Terry Brown was given \"an absolute and superior\r\nRight of First Refusal to purchase any and all of the James Brown Assets (whether\r\non an asset or stock basis) to be sold in any Proposed Transfer\" for a period of ten\r\nyears.The circuit court approved the compromise agreement by order of May 26,\r\n2009, over the objections of Appellants.4 The circuit court found the agreement\r\nwas executed by all persons having beneficial interests that were affected by the\r\ncompromise, the will and trust controversy was pursued in good faith, and the\r\nagreement was fair, equitable, and reasonable.\r\n\r\n       Under the terms of the agreement brokered by the AG, the parties would\r\njointly seek the removal of Appellants as the personal representatives of Brown's\r\nestate and as trustees of the 2000 Irrevocable Trust. All challenges to the will were\r\nto be dismissed, and the settling parties agreed that such contests were brought in\r\ngood faith and with probable cause. Tommie Rae was recognized as the surviving\r\nspouse of Brown, and all children and grandchildren who were parties to the\r\nagreement were acknowledged to be Brown's legitimate issue and heirs without the\r\nneed for DNA testing to verify their status.\r\n\r\n       The settling parties agreed to create a new trust called the James Brown\r\nLegacy Trust (\"Settlement Entity\"), which will \"receive, hold, manage and be\r\nauthorized to sell the James Brown Assets.\" The trustee and any successor trustee\r\nfor the Settlement Entity was to be selected solely by the AG. The settling parties\r\nwho had any intellectual property rights to Brown's music or persona created under\r\nfederal copyright laws or laws for heirs agreed to surrender those rights to the\r\nSettlement Entity. Tommie Rae waived any spousal rights that she might have and\r\nthe children waived any rights to Brown's assets that they might otherwise have\r\nbeyond any share to be received in the compromise.\r\n\r\n       A (New) Charitable Trust, similar to the existing Charitable Trust formed\r\nfrom the 2000 Irrevocable Trust, was to be created by the AG with the advice and\r\ncounsel of the parties. The AG was to have the sole authority to select the\r\nmanaging trustee as well as any successor trustee. An Advisory Board was to be\r\nestablished, whose members would \"serve at the pleasure of and on such terms as\r\n\r\n4 The compromise agreement contained in the record is actually a series of\r\ndocuments signed by some of the parties at different times, rather than one\r\nagreement, and an addendum signed by all parties.\r\n\nthe [AG] shall decide.\" The number of members on the Advisory Board was to be\r\ndetermined by the AG, but would include a member selected by Tommie Rae and\r\none selected by each of Brown's adult children, and the roles of all members of the\r\nboard were expressly stated to \"be solely advisory.\" The (New) Charitable Trust\r\nwould also have Honorary Family Trustees in a number to be decided by the AG\r\nand who would serve under the same terms and conditions as the Advisory Board.\r\nA trust similar to the Brown Family Education Trust was to be established for the\r\neducation of the grandchildren and their issue, to be funded with $2 million.\r\n\r\n       The parties were to divide their distributional interest in the Settlement\r\nEntity as follows: a net 47.5% to the (New) Charitable Trust; a net 23.75% to\r\nTommie Rae, which includes any share attributable to her son; and a net 4.79% to\r\neach of Brown's adult children who are settling parties. For voting purposes,\r\nhowever, the (New) Charitable Trust was to retain a 50% voting and control\r\ninterest in the Settlement Entity, the named adult children were to retain a 25%\r\nvoting and control interest, and Tommie Rae was to retain a 25% voting and\r\ncontrol interest. The parties indicated in their agreement that they intended this to\r\nbe a binding private agreement, but they also desired court approval of the\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n       The circuit court approved the compromise agreement and directed\r\nAppellants to execute the agreement. At the request of the settling parties, the\r\ncircuit court appointed Bauknight to have full authority as the personal\r\nrepresentative for Brown's estate and as trustee, and Appellants were removed\r\nfrom those positions.\r\n\r\n       Appellants appealed these rulings as well as additional, related orders, and\r\nthe Court of Appeals consolidated the appeals. This Court granted a request for\r\ncertification by the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and the\r\ncase was transferred to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n                               II. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.    Standing\r\n\r\n        As an initial matter, Respondents assert Appellants do not have standing to\r\npursue this appeal because they have no interest in the subject matter of the\r\nlitigation, i.e., the will and trust; therefore, the appeal should be dismissed.\r\nSpecifically, Respondents argue Appellants lack standing to appeal the circuit\r\ncourt's approval of the settlement agreement and the AG's involvement since they\r\n\nhad no vote or veto power over the settlement at the trial level. Respondents\r\nfurther argue Appellants lack standing to appeal their removal as personal\r\nrepresentatives and trustees because (1) their failure to adequately brief this point\r\noperates as a waiver of the issue; and (2) once the order was issued removing them\r\nas fiduciaries, its effect was immediate and their only interest in this matter became\r\na peripheral one pertaining to their claim for fees for the time they acted as\r\nfiduciaries.\r\n\r\n       \"Before any action can be maintained, there must exist a justiciable\r\ncontroversy.\" Byrd v. Irmo High Sch., 321 S.C. 426, 430, 468 S.E.2d 861,\r\n864 (1996). Justiciability encompasses several doctrines, including ripeness,\r\nmootness, and standing. Jackson v. State, 331 S.C. 486, 491 n.2, 489 S.E.2d 915,\r\n917 n.2 (1997) (citation omitted). \"Standing refers to a party's right to make a\r\nlegal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right.\" Michael P. v.\r\nGreenville County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 385 S.C. 407, 415, 684 S.E.2d 211,\r\n215 (Ct. App. 2009). \"Generally, to have standing, a litigant must have a personal\r\nstake in the subject matter of the litigation.\" Id. at 415-16, 684 S.E.2d at 215.\r\n\r\n       As noted by Appellants, there was no specific ruling discussing Appellants'\r\nstanding in the circuit court's order of May 2009, and the matter was not raised in a\r\nRule 59 motion. Although the circuit court did refer to standing, it was in the\r\ncontext of discussing authority from another jurisdiction when the circuit court\r\nreviewed the facts of that case. This Court has previously declined to consider\r\nstanding where the matter was not both raised to and ruled upon by the trial court,\r\nand it is questionable whether the issue was properly preserved here, although it\r\nwas briefed. See, e.g., James v. Anne's Inc., 390 S.C. 188, 193, 701 S.E.2d 730,\r\n732-33 (2010) (observing this Court has the inherent authority to consider\r\njusticiability, but when a party raises the issue, our courts have applied error\r\npreservation principles and have held the issue was not preserved where the trial\r\ncourt did not first rule on the issue).\r\n\r\n       Assuming, arguendo, that the circuit court impliedly ruled on the issue, we\r\nconclude Appellants have standing. Appellants were properly made parties to the\r\naction and were allowed to set forth specific challenges to the proposed\r\ncompromise agreement for the circuit court's consideration under S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 62-3-1102 (2009). We agree with Appellants that they have standing based on\r\nthe explicit terms of the trust agreement, which conferred upon the trustees the\r\nauthority to handle claims for or against the trust estate (including the authority to\r\nmediate or compromise claims), and based on their official fiduciary capacities\r\n\npursuant to state law.5 See S.C. Code Ann. § 62-7-405(c) (2009) (\"The settlor of a\r\ncharitable trust, the trustee, and the Attorney General, among others may maintain\r\na proceeding to enforce the trust.\"); P.H. Vartanian, Annotation, Right of Trustee of\r\nExpress Trust to Appeal from Order or Decree Not Affecting His Own Personal\r\nInterest, 6 A.L.R.2d 147, 152 (1949 & Later Case Service 1997) (stating where an\r\norder threatens the existence of a trust, prevents a trustee from performing his\r\nduties, or depletes the trust fund with unreasonable claims, the trustee may, in his\r\nfiduciary or representative capacity, appeal therefrom as an aggrieved party); see\r\nalso Columbia Union Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. v. Bundschu, 641 S.W.2d 864, 879\r\nn.10 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982) (stating \"where a trustee is affected by a judgment in his\r\nofficial capacity, he is aggrieved and may appeal\"); In Re Estate of Birch, 378\r\nN.Y.S.2d 792, 797 (App. Div. 1976) (holding \"that the Attorney General and the\r\ntrustee had standing\" because \"[t]he trustee has a legal obligation to defend the\r\ntrust . . . [and] [t]he Attorney General, likewise, has a duty to represent the\r\nbeneficiaries where there are dispositions for religious and charitable purposes\");\r\nIn re Crawford's Estate, 16 A.2d 521 (Pa. 1940) (involving an appeal from an\r\norder removing the appellant as a co-trustee).\r\n\r\nB.    Court's Approval of Compromise Agreement\r\n\r\n       In their appeal, Appellants contend the compromise agreement was not\r\neligible for court consideration under section 62-3-1102 because the trust did not\r\nagree to it and the AG had no authority to speak for the trust. Appellants assert a\r\ncompromise can be considered under the statute only if all holders of beneficial\r\ninterests agree to it, and the 2000 Irrevocable Trust, which was entitled to the\r\nresidue of Brown's estate, was the chief holder of a beneficial interest in the estate.\r\nThe trust, however, was not represented in the settlement and did not agree to\r\nreducing its share of Brown's estate by half, so there was no compromise\r\nagreement for the circuit court to consider.\r\n\r\n       Appellants argue the AG's authority to enforce a charitable trust does not\r\ngive him the authority to direct the settlement of an estate dispute, remove existing\r\ntrustees, and administer a new trust with the AG at the helm. Appellants argue the\r\nAG effectively placed himself in control of most of Brown's assets by securing sole\r\nauthority to select a managing trustee of the new entity, and then proceeded to give\r\n\r\n\r\n5   We need not reach Appellants' alternative arguments that they have constitutional\r\nstanding or standing under the public importance exception.\r\n\naway over half of the estate to disinherited family members and purported family\r\nmembers, all in contravention of Brown's express wishes that the bulk of his\r\nwealth be used for the charitable purpose of educating disadvantaged youths.\r\n\r\n       Appellants further assert that, even if the agreement were eligible for court\r\nconsideration, the agreement did not meet the statutory standard necessary to\r\nnullify Brown's estate plan because (1) it was not a compromise of a bona fide\r\n(good faith) challenge to Brown's will, and (2) it was unjust and unreasonable.\r\n\r\n       Upon appeal, \"[t]he question [for an appellate court] is did the [ruling] court\r\nabuse its discretion in approving the compromise?\" In re Estate of Horton, 90 Cal.\r\nRptr. 66, 68-69 (Ct. App. 1970). An abuse of discretion occurs when a court's\r\norder is controlled by an error of law or there is no evidentiary support for the\r\ncourt's factual conclusions. Fairchild v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 398 S.C. 90, 727\r\nS.E.2d 407 (2012); see also Univ. of S. Cal. v. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 617 S.E.2d\r\n135 (Ct. App. 2005) (stating the interpretation of a statute approving a compromise\r\nagreement presents a question of law); Perreault v. The Free Lance-Star, 666\r\nS.E.2d 352 (Va. 2008) (same). For the reasons to be discussed, we hold the circuit\r\ncourt erred in approving the compromise agreement in the current matter.\r\n\r\n      (1) Eligibility for Court Consideration\r\n\r\n      We first consider Appellants' contention that the proposed compromise\r\nagreement was ineligible for court consideration.\r\n\r\n       \"A compromise agreement is void unless executed in compliance with the\r\ngoverning statute.\" In re Estate of Riley, 266 P.3d 1078, 1080 (Ariz. Ct. App.\r\n2011). Section 62-3-1102 of the South Carolina Code establishes the following\r\nprocedure for securing court approval of a compromise agreement resolving an\r\nestate controversy:\r\n\r\n             (1) The terms of the compromise shall be set forth in an\r\n      agreement in writing which shall be executed by all competent\r\n      persons and parents acting for any minor child having beneficial\r\n      interests or having claims which will or may be affected by the\r\n      compromise. . . .\r\n\r\n             (2) Any interested person, including the personal representative\r\n      or a trustee, then may submit the agreement to the court for its\r\n      approval and for execution by the personal representative, the trustee\r\n\n      of every affected testamentary trust, and other fiduciaries and\r\n      representatives.\r\n\r\n             (3) After notice to all interested persons or their\r\n      representatives, including the personal representative of the estate and\r\n      all affected trustees of trusts, the court, if it finds that the contest or\r\n      controversy is in good faith and that the effect of the agreement upon\r\n      the interests of persons represented by fiduciaries or other\r\n      representatives is just and reasonable, shall make an order approving\r\n      the agreement and directing all fiduciaries subject to its jurisdiction\r\n      to execute the agreement.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-1102 (2009) (emphasis added).6 \"Upon the making of the\r\norder and the execution of the agreement, all further disposition of the estate is in\r\naccordance with the terms of the agreement.\" Id. § 62-3-1102(3).7\r\n\r\n        Citing University of Southern California v. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 617 S.E.2d\r\n135 (Ct. App. 2005), Appellants contend \"where a trust is beneficiary of a devise,\r\nit is the trust, acting through its trustee, which alone has statutory authority to\r\nparticipate in a Section 1102 settlement agreement.\"8 Appellants contend the\r\n\r\n6 The first sentence of subsection (3) was amended in 2010, but the change does\r\nnot impact this appeal. Act No. 244, 2010 S.C. Acts 1764.\r\n7 See Columbia Union Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 641 S.W.2d at 874 (stating once a\r\ncompromise agreement is approved, the property devolves under the terms of the\r\nagreement, not the testamentary instrument, so the judgment on appeal adjudicates\r\na contract, not a will contest, and the efficacy of the agreement depends only on the\r\nwritten agreement among all persons with a beneficial interest or claim affected by\r\nthe compromise and the determination of the ruling court that the controversy is in\r\ngood faith and that the agreement affects fairly the interests of persons represented\r\nby fiduciaries or their representatives).\r\n8 In Moran, the Court of Appeals held that a trust, created by a pour-over\r\nprovision in the decedent's will, was the entity with a \"beneficial interest\" in the\r\ndecedent's estate, whereas the appellant University, which was a beneficiary of the\r\ntrust, was merely an \"interested person\" in the estate. 365 S.C. at 282-83, 617\r\nS.E.2d at 141-42. Therefore, the trustee had the authority to compromise a claim\r\non behalf of the trust and the trustee was required to execute a compromise\r\nagreement to settle a dispute over the estate. Id. The court held the University was\r\n\ncircuit court could not approve the compromise agreement without their consent as\r\ntrustees. Appellants assert they were not given notice of the parties' negotiations,\r\nso the beneficiaries were unrepresented. They also contend the circuit court erred\r\nin finding the AG has the authority to direct or enter into a compromise on behalf\r\nof the charitable beneficiaries.\r\n\r\n        Respondents, in contrast, contend Appellants are improperly attempting to\r\nbroaden Moran to give a trustee absolute and sole control over settlements, and\r\nthis is antithetical to the purpose of section 62-3-1102. They state that under\r\nAppellants' theory, the beneficiaries of a trust could never reach a compromise\r\nbecause a trustee could always single-handedly veto the process.\r\n\r\n       Respondents argue that under the statutory framework, the important\r\nquestion is whether all beneficial interests were represented at the hearing in this\r\nmatter. The AG asserts he represents the beneficial interests of a charitable trust,\r\nbut even if he does not, the charitable beneficiaries would have been represented\r\nby Appellants at the hearing, since they contended they represented the \"trust\" and\r\nwere present to voice their objections to the proposed compromise. Consequently,\r\nthe charitable beneficiaries were represented at the hearing, either by the AG or by\r\nAppellants as trustees. Moreover, trustees do not have a statutory right to\r\nunilaterally prevent a compromise.\r\n\r\n       Under the statute, any \"interested person\"9 may submit the proposed\r\nagreement to the court after notice has been given to all interested persons and\r\ntheir representatives, and the agreement must be executed by all persons having\r\n\"beneficial interests\" in the estate10 as well as fiduciaries. Thus, Appellants\r\n\r\n\r\nentitled to notice and to an opportunity to voice its objection to the compromise,\r\nbut its signature was not required for court approval of the agreement. Id. The\r\nMoran case did not involve the AG's representation of charitable beneficiaries,\r\nhowever, so there is no discussion in this regard.\r\n9 An \"interested person\" under our Probate Code \"includes heirs, devisees,\r\nchildren, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, and any others having a property right in\r\nor claim against a trust estate or the estate of a decedent, ward, or protected person\r\nwhich may be affected by the proceeding. It also includes persons having priority\r\nfor appointment as personal representative and other fiduciaries representing\r\ninterested persons.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 62-1-201(20) (2009).\r\n\nunquestionably were entitled to notice (and a corresponding opportunity to be\r\nheard) and they were necessary signatories based on the express terms of the\r\nstatute. Appellants dispute, however, whether they were properly noticed and\r\nwhether their signatures could be compelled by the court, and they contend the\r\nagreement was not eligible for the court's consideration.\r\n\r\n       Although Appellants were not given notice of the negotiations engaged in by\r\nthe other parties prior to reaching the settlement, Appellants admittedly were given\r\nnotice of the proposed compromise ultimately reached, and they fully participated\r\nin the extensive hearings held over a four-month period in the circuit court, at\r\nwhich time they were given the opportunity to voice their objections. It is notice\r\nof the proposed compromise and any hearings that is statutorily required, as it is\r\nthe final proposal that is subject to the court's scrutiny under section 62-3-1102.\r\nThe method by which the proposal was reached, including how many of the parties\r\nactively participated in any preliminary discussions, is not a determinative factor in\r\nwhether the agreement is eligible to be presented to the circuit court for\r\nconsideration.11\r\n\r\n       In addition, section 62-3-1102(3) specifically states that if the court \"finds\r\nthat the contest or controversy is in good faith and that the effect of the agreement\r\nupon the interests of persons represented by fiduciaries or other representatives is\r\njust and reasonable, [it] shall make an order approving the agreement and\r\ndirecting all fiduciaries subject to its jurisdiction to execute the agreement.\" S.C.\r\n\r\n10 The Reporter's Comments to section 62-3-1102 state, \"The agreement must be\r\nsigned by all persons having a beneficial interest in or claim against the estate,\r\nwhose interest or claim is affected by the agreement.\" Reporter's Comments to\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-1102 (2009) (emphasis added). What constitutes a\r\n\"beneficial interest in an estate\" is not specifically defined in the Probate Code.\r\nSee Milner v. Milner, 361 S.W.3d 615, 620 (Tex. 2012) (defining a \"beneficial\r\ninterest\" as \"[a] right or expectancy in something (such as a trust or an estate), as\r\nopposed to legal title to that thing\" (alteration in original) (quoting Black's Law\r\nDictionary 885 (9th ed. 2009)); accord In re Estate of Sullivan, 724 N.W.2d 532\r\n(Minn. Ct. App. 2006) (also applying the definition in Black's Law Dictionary).\r\nThe Probate Code does define a \"beneficiary\" in S.C. Code Ann. § 62-1-201(2),\r\nbut only as it relates to trusts.\r\n11Any alleged overreaching by the AG in the actual terms of the settlement and\r\nany resulting unfairness in the compromise ultimately reached are more\r\nappropriately considered in evaluating if the compromise was just and reasonable.\r\n\nCode Ann. § 62-3-1102(3). Thus, while Appellants were necessary signatories to\r\nthe compromise, it is clear from the plain language of the statute that the circuit\r\ncourt had the authority to direct their execution of the document if it found the two\r\npreceding conditions for approval were met.\r\n\r\n      The Reporter's Comments to section 62-3-1102 reiterate that a personal\r\nrepresentative or testamentary trustee may be directed by the court to sign the\r\nagreement:  Subsection (2) requires submission of the agreement to the\r\n      probate court for approval. The application for approval may be made\r\n      by an interested party or by the personal representative. The\r\n      application would request approval of the agreement and would\r\n      request an order directing or permitting the personal representative\r\n      and the trustee of an affected testamentary trust to execute the\r\n      agreement.\r\n\r\nReporter's Comments to S.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-1102 (2009) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      The official Comment to section 3-1102 of the Uniform Probate Code, on\r\nwhich our South Carolina statute is based, states the provision for obtaining court\r\napproval of compromise agreements was specifically intended to prevent executors\r\nand testamentary trustees from single-handedly vetoing such agreements:\r\n\r\n             The thrust of the procedure [for approving settlement\r\n      agreements] is to put the authority for initiating settlement proposals\r\n      with the persons who have beneficial interests in the estate, and to\r\n      prevent executors and testamentary trustees from vetoing any such\r\n      proposal. . . . Because executors and trustees may have an interest in\r\n      fees and commissions which they might earn through efforts to carry\r\n      out the testator's intention, the judgment of the court is substituted for\r\n      that of such fiduciaries in appropriate cases.12\r\n\r\nUnif. Probate Code, Comment to § 3-1102 (amended 1993), 8 U.L.A. 305 (1998)\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n12 The AG argues Appellants have sought $5 million in fees for their service, so\r\nthis case would be an appropriate one for the court to substitute its judgment for\r\nthat of the fiduciaries.\r\n\n       As the Comment to section 3-1102 of the Uniform Act unequivocally states,\r\nthe purpose of this provision is to prevent trustees from unilaterally vetoing\r\nsettlement agreements based on a desire to earn fees or based on some other\r\nmotive. See In re Estate of Riley, 266 P.3d 1078, 1083 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011)\r\n(observing the purpose of the statute regarding compromise agreements, which is\r\nbased on the Uniform Probate Code, is to keep the power to make compromises\r\ninvolving the estate in the hands of the estate's beneficiaries and to prevent\r\nexecutors and testamentary trustees from vetoing such proposals); In re Estate of\r\nSmith, 355 N.Y.S.2d 994, 995 (App. Div. 1974) (stating \"Appellant, as executor\r\nand trustee under the will, does not have such an interest as would prevent any\r\ncompromise made among all the parties beneficially interested in the estate\"; \"the\r\ninterests sought to be protected under a compromise agreement are those of named\r\nand unnamed beneficiaries\"); In re Estate of Smith, 349 N.Y.S.2d 281 (Surrog. Ct.\r\n1973) (holding the objections of the preliminary executor and nominated executor\r\nand trustee to the proposed settlement should be overruled and that the attorney\r\ngeneral has the right and power to enter into a compromise on behalf of the\r\nultimate, unspecified, and indefinite charitable beneficiaries mentioned in the\r\ndecedent's will); see also In re Will of Seabrook, 218 A.2d 648, 652 (N.J. Super.\r\nCt. Ch.

Radford, George Gleason Bogert, & George Taylor Bogert, The\r\nLaw of Trusts & Trustees § 1009, at 450 n.3 (3d ed. 2006) (\"Under UPC §§ 3-1101\r\nand 3-1102 a compromise of a will contest will bind a testamentary trustee.\").\r\n\r\n        In general, we agree with Appellants that, as the trustees of the 2000\r\nIrrevocable Trust, they were conferred the authority under the trust documents and\r\nunder South Carolina law to compromise claims involving the trust. However,\r\nwhere the trust involves charitable entities, the trustee has a duty to defend the\r\ntrust, and the AG has the duty to represent the unspecified charitable beneficiaries.\r\nSee In Re Estate of Birch, 378 N.Y.S.2d 792, 797 (App. Div. 1976) (stating \"[t]he\r\ntrustee has a legal obligation to defend the trust . . . [and] [t]he Attorney General,\r\nlikewise, has a duty to represent the beneficiaries where there are dispositions for\r\nreligious and charitable purposes\"); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 1-7-130 (2005)\r\n(providing the AG shall enforce the due application of funds given or appropriated\r\nto public charities within the state); S.C. Code Ann. § 62-7-405(c) (2009) (\"The\r\nsettlor of a charitable trust, the trustee, and the Attorney General, among others\r\nmay maintain a proceeding to enforce the trust.\"); Epworth Children's Home v.\r\n\nBeasley, 365 S.C. 157, 616 S.E.2d 710 (2005) (stating the AG is the proper party to\r\nprotect the interests of the public at large in administering or enforcing charitable\r\ntrusts). The AG was allowed to intervene in this action, without objection, and\r\nthere is no challenge on appeal as to the propriety of the intervention.13\r\n\r\n        Contrary to Appellants' assertion, it was the circuit court, not the AG, which\r\ngave final approval to the compromise agreement submitted by the parties, and the\r\ncircuit court repeatedly noted its duty was to review the compromise to determine\r\nif it satisfied the two statutory factors (a good faith controversy, a fair and just\r\neffect), and it set forth its findings in this regard. In contrast, the requirements to\r\nseek court approval of an agreement under section 62-3-1102 are distinguishable,\r\ni.e., the agreement must be in writing and executed by all parties with beneficial\r\ninterests in the estate, it must be submitted to the court by an interested party,\r\nnotice must be given to all interested parties, and there must be an opportunity to\r\nbe heard. We find these requirements were met and the compromise was eligible\r\nfor the court's consideration.\r\n\r\n      (2) Section 62-3-1102's Two-Part Test for Court Approval\r\n\r\n       Having found the circuit court may approve a compromise agreement after\r\nnotice to, but over the objection of, Appellants, our next consideration is the\r\npropriety of the circuit court's approval of the agreement itself. In this regard, a\r\ntwo-part test is employed under section 62-3-1102: (1) whether the compromise\r\nsettles a good-faith controversy between the parties, and (2) whether the\r\ncompromise is just and reasonable.\r\n\r\n       In this case, actions were brought by some of Brown's adult children and\r\nTommie Rae to set aside Brown's will and the 2000 Irrevocable Trust on the\r\nground of undue influence. Tommie Rae also claimed she was entitled to an\r\nelective share or an omitted spouse's share of Brown's estate as his surviving legal\r\nspouse, and that her child, James B., was entitled to a share of the estate as an\r\nomitted child. In approving the compromise, the circuit court found the settling\r\nparties had initiated their contests to Brown's will and trust in good faith, and that\r\nthe settlement was just and reasonable. We question whether the parties\r\n\r\n\r\n13 The order authorized the AG \"to intervene in this matter to represent and protect\r\nthe interests of the beneficiaries of any charitable trust created by [Brown's 2000\r\nwill] and the [2000 Irrevocable Trust] or any other assets of the Estate of James\r\nBrown that may be impressed with a charitable trust . . . .\"\r\n\nestablished the existence of a good faith controversy, but conclude the compromise\r\nwas not just and reasonable, in any event.\r\n\r\n             (a) Requirement of a Good Faith Controversy\r\n\r\n      The first part of the two-part statutory mandate of section 62-3-1101(3)\r\nrequires that the court \"finds that the contest or controversy is in good faith[.]\"\r\n\r\n       The circuit court found that there was a good faith basis for each of the\r\nclaims asserted by Respondents. As to the claim of undue influence, the circuit\r\ncourt found the credibility of the four principal witnesses to the validity of the will\r\nand the 2000 Irrevocable Trust was questionable because the attorney who drafted\r\nthe will, H. Dewain Herring, is now in jail for a crime of violence, and the\r\ntestimony of the three original trustees, Dallas, Bradley, and Cannon, who had\r\nbeen removed from their fiduciary positions, was suspect and contradictory in prior\r\nproceedings. For example, the court noted Dallas had testified that he had\r\nknowingly allowed his attorney to agree to a stipulation containing false\r\ninformation because he did not want to lose his position as a fiduciary. The court\r\nfound the questionable credibility of these four individuals supported the good\r\nfaith basis of the contestants' claims. Further, the circuit court found there were\r\nseveral examples of undue influence in the record, including the fact that the trust\r\nauthorized the trustees to spend up to 50% of gross income for management\r\npurposes, and there was a blank deed signed by James Brown and witnessed in\r\nHerring's client file. The court also noted there was a controversy regarding what\r\nassets were actually transferred to the trust during Brown's lifetime.\r\n\r\n        The circuit court further found a good faith controversy existed regarding\r\nthe assertion of Tommie Rae for either an elective share14 or an omitted spouse's\r\nshare15 of the estate. The court stated that, although Tommie Rae had undergone a\r\n\r\n14 A \"surviving spouse has a right of election to take an elective share of one-third\r\nof the decedent's probate estate.\" S.C. Code Ann. 62-2-201(a) (2009). \"[P]robate\r\nestate means the decedent's property passing under the decedent's will plus the\r\ndecedent's property passing by intestacy, reduced by funeral and administration\r\nexpenses and enforceable claims.\"  Id. § 62-2-202. The right of election of a\r\nsurviving spouse and the rights of the surviving spouse to a homestead allowance\r\nand exempt property can be waived by a written agreement. Id. § 62-2-204.\r\n15 The omitted spouse statute provides that, \"[i]f a testator fails to provide by will\r\nfor his surviving spouse who married the testator after the execution of the will, the\r\n\npurported marriage ceremony in 1997 with another man before she had a marriage\r\nceremony with Brown in 2001, Tommie Rae had obtained an annulment of her\r\nmarriage to Ahmed on April 15, 2004 on the basis Ahmed did not have the\r\ncapacity to marry. Thus, there was no impediment to her marriage to Brown.16\r\nThe circuit court also found that an agreement that Tommie Rae had executed in\r\nwhich she agreed never to assert a common law marriage with Brown had no\r\nbearing on Tommie Rae's claim as a surviving legal spouse. Moreover, after that\r\nagreement was executed, Brown published an autobiography in which he referred\r\nto Tommie Rae as his \"wife\" and to James B. as his \"son,\" so the circuit court\r\nfound Tommie Rae's legal status was muddled by the actions of the parties.\r\n\r\n       Even if Tommie Rae did not prevail on a claim for a spousal share, the\r\ncircuit court found significant arguments existed to warrant recognizing a claim for\r\nan omitted child's share for James B. under S.C. Code Ann. § 62-2-302 (2009),\r\nwhich would allow the child an intestate share of the probate estate. The court did\r\nnote that such a claim is not conclusive, however, because if Brown had made\r\ntransfers to the child that were in lieu of a provision by will, then those transfers\r\n\r\nomitted spouse, upon compliance with the provisions of subsection (c), shall\r\nreceive the same share of the estate [s]he would have received if the decedent left\r\nno will unless: (1) it appears from the will that the omission was intentional; or\r\n(2) the testator provided for the spouse by transfer outside the will and the intent\r\nthat the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown by statements of\r\nthe testator or from the amount of the transfer or other evidence.\" Id. § 62-2-\r\n301(a).\r\n16Tommie Rae had claimed her marriage to Ahmed had been procured by fraud\r\nbecause she had discovered that Ahmed already had three or more wives in\r\nPakistan and was merely seeking U.S. citizenship, and that he had refused to live\r\nwith her as husband and wife. Tommie Rae's request for an annulment from\r\nAhmed was hastily granted by the family court in Charleston County during the\r\npendency of Brown's separate annulment action against her. The circuit court\r\nnoted the decision of the Court of Appeals in Lukich v. Lukich, 368 S.C. 47, 627\r\nS.E.2d 754 (Ct. App. 2006), in which the Court of Appeals held that an annulment\r\ndeclaring a spouse's first marriage void could not retroactively validate the spouse's\r\nsecond marriage. The circuit court distinguished Brown's situation, opining that\r\nthe rule in Lukich did not apply where the first marriage was never valid because\r\none of the parties was already married. This Court has since affirmed Lukich, in\r\nLukich v. Lukich, 379 S.C. 589, 666 S.E.2d 906 (2008). We express no opinion,\r\nhowever, on the circuit court's interpretation here.\r\n\ncould be deemed to satisfy the child's share.17 The circuit court stated it was not\r\nonly the presence of each of these individual, primary claims, but also their\r\ncumulative effect, that supported its finding of a good faith controversy between\r\nthe parties.\r\n\r\n       In general, a threat to contest a will must be made in good faith in order for\r\nthe surrender of the right to constitute consideration for a family settlement, and if\r\nit is made in bad faith to extort a settlement, or if the claim is known to be\r\nfrivolous and without foundation, then it is not in good faith. M.L. Cross,\r\nAnnotation, Family Settlement of Testator's Estate, 29 A.L.R.3d 8, at § 27 (1970 &\r\nSupp. 2011).\r\n\r\n       The \"good faith\" requirement has been variously interpreted, with\r\njurisdictions applying definitions that can be categorized along a continuum from a\r\nsubjective to an objective standard,18 and they have afforded the claims a level of\r\n\r\n17   The statute provides, \"If a testator fails to provide in his will for any of his\r\nchildren born or adopted after the execution of his will, the omitted child, upon\r\ncompliance with subsection (d), receives a share in the estate equal in value to that\r\nwhich he would have received if the testator had died intestate unless: (1) it\r\nappears from the will that the omission was intentional; or (2) when the will was\r\nexecuted the testator had one or more children and devised substantially all of his\r\nestate to his spouse; or (3) the testator provided for the child by transfer outside the\r\nwill and the intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown\r\n. . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 62-2-302(a) (2009).\r\n18 Compare 80 Am. Jur. 2d Wills § 982 (2002) (stating \"it need not appear that a\r\nground of opposition in fact would have defeated the will; rather, it is enough if the\r\nparties consider it so far doubtful as to be the subject of a compromise\" (footnote\r\nomitted)), with Holt v. Holt, 282 S.E.2d 784, 787 (N.C. 1981) (\"The mere\r\nrelinquishment of a right to contest a will is not sufficient consideration to support\r\na reciprocal promise to modify the will unless there is a bona fide dispute as to the\r\nwill's validity.\"), and id. at 789 (\"Whether there is a bona fide dispute depends,\r\nfurthermore, not on what any particular party to the alleged compromise may\r\nsubjectively believe about it, but whether the bona fides of the disagreement may,\r\nunder all the facts and circumstances of the case, be reasonably found to exist by\r\nthe trier of fact. This principle inheres in our decisions; and cases from other\r\njurisdictions with near uniformity hold that absent any basis in fact and law upon\r\nwhich to challenge the validity of a will, a compromise promise to distribute the\r\nproperty differently from the manner contemplated by the will is unenforceable\r\n\nscrutiny that is less than that given to ordinary contracts, up to what has been\r\ndescribed as \"close scrutiny.\"19\r\n\r\n        However, it is universally acknowledged that full proof of the asserted\r\nclaims is not required because the raison d'etre for the statute is to dispense with\r\nthe necessity of litigating the merits of the claims. The circuit court's duty was not\r\nto decide the ultimate question of the merits of the undue influence and other\r\nclaims; rather, the statutory standard is whether the proposed compromise\r\nagreement resolves a good faith controversy and whether the agreement is just and\r\nreasonable. See generally M.L. Cross, supra, 29 A.L.R.3d 8 (family settlements);\r\nsee also Warner v. Warner, 1 A.2d 911, 914-15 (Conn. 1938) (stating forbearance\r\nin pursuing a claim known to be frivolous or without foundation is not in good\r\nfaith; however, the question is not whether there was in fact undue influence, but\r\nwhether the parties could in good faith reasonably believe so, and the test is not\r\nwhether the claim would have succeeded in the litigation, as that would involve a\r\ntrial of the issue that was compromised, and the purpose of the law in encouraging\r\ncompromises would thus be defeated; a compromise does not import finality as to\r\nthe sufficiency of the grounds for opposition to a will, as the compromise in effect\r\nincludes a discontinuance of the investigation of the claim); In re Estate of Yeley,\r\n959 N.E.2d 888, 893 (Ind. Ct. App. 2011) (\"A court order approving a settlement\r\nagreement is not an adjudication of the issues of the litigation, but rather is an\r\navoidance of adjudication.\").\r\n\r\n      That being said, we have substantial concerns about the circuit court's\r\nfindings in this regard. Although proof of a claim is not required, we believe\r\nsomething more than a subjective belief or a mere allegation is necessary to avoid\r\nthe potential for collusion among disinherited or disgruntled family members who\r\n\r\n\r\ndue to lack of consideration if the reciprocal promise is merely not to contest the\r\nwill.\").\r\n19 Compare Skaggs v. Cullipher, 941 S.W.2d 443, 447 (Ark. Ct. App. 1997)\r\n(stating family agreements resolving estate and will matters \"are afforded a legal\r\nstatus distinct from typical contracts, and will be enforced without closely\r\nscrutinizing the consideration of the transaction or the strict legal rights of the\r\nparties\"), with Fleisch v.

App. Ct.\r\n1999) (stating \"family settlements are subjected to close scrutiny to determine\r\nwhether the disputes they purport to resolve are genuine or simply ill-conceived\r\nthreats concocted to subvert the settlor's intent\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\nwish to dispose of the testator's estate plan and substitute it with one more to their\r\nliking.As to the claim of undue influence, it has been frequently stated that, \"[i]n\r\norder to void a will on the ground of undue influence, the undue influence must\r\ndestroy free agency and prevent the maker's exercise of judgment and free choice.\"\r\nIn re Estate of Cumbee, 333 S.C. 664, 671, 511 S.E.2d 390, 393 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe influence necessary to void a will must amount to force and coercion. Id. \"A\r\nmere showing of opportunity or motive does not create an issue of fact regarding\r\nundue influence.\" Id. \"In cases where allegations of undue influence have been\r\nsuccessful, there has been evidence of threats, force, restricted visitation, or an\r\nexisting fiduciary relationship at the time of or before the will's execution.\" Id. at\r\n671-72, 511 S.E.2d at 394 (citation omitted). Although there is a presumption of\r\nundue influence in the making of a will involving fiduciaries, the ultimate burden\r\nalways remains with the proponent. Gordon v. Busbee, 397 S.C. 119, 723 S.E.2d\r\n822 (Ct. App. 2012). \"[T]he circumstances must point unmistakenly and\r\nconvincingly to the fact that the mind of the testator was subject to that of some\r\nother person so the will is that of the latter and not of the former.\" Byrd v. Byrd,\r\n279 S.C. 425, 427, 308 S.E.2d 788, 789 (1983). In addition, \"even if a contestant\r\ndoes establish an inference of undue influence, the unhampered opportunity of the\r\ntestator to change the will after the operation of undue influence destroys this\r\nconclusion.\" Hembree v. Estate of Hembree, 311 S.C. 192, 196-97, 428 S.E.2d 3,\r\n5 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\n       The circuit court's scant references to alleged improprieties in the handling\r\nof Brown's will, while troubling, do not bear directly on the issue of whether\r\nBrown's desires for the disposition of his estate were overborne to such an extent\r\nthat the resulting distribution was not the product of his own free will. In\r\nparticular, although the circuit court focused on the later imprisonment of the\r\nattorney who drafted the will, the imprisonment was for a crime totally unrelated to\r\nhis services as an estate planner. This fact has no bearing on the execution of\r\nBrown's testamentary documents and sheds no light on whether Brown's will was\r\nsomehow overcome at the time he signed the documents finalizing his estate plan.\r\nSee Russell v. Wachovia Bank, 353 S.C. 208, 219, 578 S.E.2d 329, 335 (2003) (\"In\r\norder for the will to be void due to undue influence, '[a] contestant must show that\r\nthe influence was brought directly to bear upon the testamentary act.\" (alteration in\r\noriginal) (emphasis added) (quoting Mock v. Dowling, 266 S.C. 274, 277, 222\r\nS.E.2d 773, 774 (1976)).\r\n\n       Similarly, the fact that one provision regarding management fees in the trust\r\ncould be deemed \"generous\" would support at most reformation of the document,\r\nbut would not justify the complete destruction of Brown's estate plan.20 See\r\ngenerally In re Estate of Schroeder, 441 N.W.2d 527 (Minn. Ct. App. 1989)\r\n(stating to constitute a good faith will contest, the objections must have legal merit;\r\nthe appellate court found that even if the testimony were true, at most it would\r\nhave supported reformation of the will, not the overthrow of the decedent's entire\r\ntestamentary plan); Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 399, 608 S.E.2d 849, 854 (2005)\r\n(stating \"a showing of general influence is not tantamount to undue influence\" and\r\n\"a contestant must show that the undue influence was brought directly to bear upon\r\nthe\" challenged transaction such that it prevented the grantor's exercise of\r\njudgment and free choice).\r\n\r\n       All indications in the record are that Brown was of sound mind and strong\r\nphysical constitution until the time of his death, as he had only recently returned\r\nfrom touring and was making preparations for future performances when he\r\nsuddenly became ill and passed away. Cf. Russell, 353 S.C. at 219, 578 S.E.2d at\r\n335 (finding no undue influence where it was \"undisputed that [the] [t]estator was\r\nindependent, and physically mobile until a few days before his death,\" and that the\r\n\"[t]estator, while elderly, was not infirm, mentally or physically, and was not\r\nprevented from seeing relatives, friends or business associates\").\r\n\r\n       It appears Brown painstakingly developed his estate plan over the course of\r\nseveral years, and in various drafts, including the will in dispute here, Brown made\r\nit clear that he intended the bulk of his estate to be used for the education of\r\ndisadvantaged youths, as he had provided for his family members during his\r\nlifetime. His estate documents explicitly state that he had named all of those he\r\nwished to be the beneficiaries of his estate, and that any further claimants,\r\nincluding future spouses or those purporting to be heirs, were purposefully\r\nexcluded. Another strong indicator of Brown's intent is his inclusion of no-contest\r\nclauses in both his will and trust.\r\n\r\n      The record contains numerous references to the fact that Brown repeatedly\r\nmade his intentions known during his lifetime to his family, friends, and business\r\nassociates, and he had even met with family members not too long before his\r\n\r\n20 Both Brown's will and trust contained severability clauses that stated if any part\r\nthereof should be found invalid, illegal, or inoperative for any reason, it was his\r\nintention that the remaining parts be fully effective as far as possible and\r\nreasonable.\r\n\nunexpected death and had reaffirmed his intentions in this regard. Brown had a\r\nreputation as a strong-willed individual who did not take orders from others, and\r\nhe made his desires abundantly clear during his lifetime. We find there is no\r\nreasonable basis for the undue influence claim asserted here other than as a means\r\nto dismantle Brown's estate plan. The result is to enable those who were\r\ndisinherited to obtain Brown's assets to the detriment of the charitable entity that\r\nBrown so fervently desired. Because he knew that it would be a source of dispute,\r\nBrown went to remarkable lengths to protect his right to designate the appropriate\r\nlegacy for his life's work, including having numerous provisions in his estate\r\ndocuments and informing family members of his intentions in advance. We see no\r\nreasonable or substantial basis to support a good faith finding here.21 See Anderson\r\nv. Anderson, 44 N.E.2d 43, 47 (Ill. 1942) (\"[T]here must be some reasonable or\r\nsubstantial basis for the claims advanced by the parties which are surrendered by\r\nthe agreement.\"); Russell, 353 S.C. at 220, 578 S.E.2d at 335 (finding evidence of\r\nthe testator's \"unhampered opportunity\" to change his will negated any undue\r\ninfluence that the appellants put forth); cf., e.g., Estate of Cumbee, 333 S.C. at 672-\r\n73, 511 S.E.2d at 394-95 (holding the determination that the testator's will was the\r\nproduct of undue influence was supported by the evidence, which showed the\r\ntestator's conversations were overheard using a baby monitor, the testator\r\ndeveloped hand signals to communicate with her visitors, the beneficiary had the\r\ntestator's power of attorney and managed all of her finances, and that same\r\nbeneficiary controlled the execution of the will).\r\n\r\n       The AG acknowledged during oral arguments in this matter that he\r\nundertook no inquiry into the undue influence claims of the Respondents and the\r\ncircumstances surrounding Brown's execution of his will. While we do not believe\r\na full-blown, formal investigation is required before a compromise may be\r\nreached, we believe something more than a mere accusation and the subjective\r\nopinion of the Respondents is necessary to justify court approval of a compromise\r\nthat seeks to vitiate the decedent's entire estate plan on the basis of a vague\r\nallegation of undue influence. Cf. Russell, 353 S.C. at 220, 578 S.E.2d at 335\r\n(noting \"the circumstances surrounding the execution of the Will . . . is the critical\r\nissue when evaluating an undue influence case\"); In re Last Will and Testament of\r\nSmoak, 286 S.C. 419, 427, 334 S.E.2d 806, 810-11 (1985) (stating a witness's\r\ntestimony that the will was the result of undue influence was a conclusion\r\n\"obviously drawn out of thin air\" as the witness \"knew absolutely nothing about\r\n\r\n21Knowing of the potential for an attack on his estate plan after his death, Brown\r\nhad admonished all potential challengers to his will and trust that such actions\r\nwould \"be considered an affront to [his] wishes.\"\r\n\nthe circumstances under which the Will was executed\"; the court noted \"one of the\r\nbasic rights known to our civilization is the privilege of disposing of property by\r\nWill as one elects\").\r\n\r\n       As to the spousal claims, even if Tommie Rae were able to establish a claim\r\nas Brown's surviving spouse, she executed a prenuptial agreement, in which she\r\nindicated that she had the opportunity to consult with counsel of her own choosing\r\nand waived all rights to Brown's property or any statutory claims against his estate.\r\nA valid prenuptial agreement would normally preclude any right to an elective\r\nshare. See S.C. Code Ann. § 62-2-204 (2009) (\"The right of election of a surviving\r\nspouse . . . may be waived . . . by a written contract . . . signed by the party waiving\r\nafter fair disclosure.\"). She also executed an agreement waiving any claim to\r\nstatus as a common-law spouse.22 Although the circuit court correctly noted the\r\nagreement to waive any claim as a common-law spouse would not be dispositive of\r\nTommie Rae's claim that she was a surviving spouse, the circuit court did not\r\nacknowledge the sizeable bar posed by a prenuptial agreement.\r\n\r\n       Beyond this, Brown's testamentary documents state that he was specifically\r\nomitting any other beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries, including a future\r\nspouse or heirs, based on his desire to leave most of his estate to charity after\r\nproviding for the education of his grandchildren. See S.C. Code Ann. § 62-2-\r\n301(a) (2009) (providing an omitted spouse is not entitled to a statutory share\r\nwhere \"(1) it appears from the will that the omission was intentional; or (2) the\r\ntestator provided for the spouse by transfer outside the will and the intent that the\r\ntransfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown by statements of the\r\ntestator or from the amount of the transfer or other evidence\").\r\n\r\n       As for the claim of the pretermitted child, we note it was not supported by a\r\nproperly-authenticated DNA test, even though one had been offered to Tommie\r\nRae for her child, and Brown himself had previously requested a DNA test during\r\nhis relationship with Tommie Rae.23 The child was not born of the marriage,\r\n\r\n22 Tommie Rae's waiver of any claim for status as a common-law wife begs the\r\nquestion of the necessity to do so if she was, in fact, the legal spouse of Brown.\r\nMoreover, the timing of the waiver raises additional questions because it arose\r\nfrom Brown's filing of an annulment action.\r\n23 There was a test performed, but the testing lab stated in its report that it could\r\nnot verify the accuracy of the results because the samples were not submitted in\r\naccordance with established protocol (\"The samples were not collected according\r\n\nwhich is certainly not required for a pretermission claim, but this fact does mean\r\nthat he does not enjoy a presumptive status as Brown's child, which would have\r\nbeen a significant factor supporting the finding of a good faith claim.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, as recognized by the circuit court, an omitted child is not entitled\r\nto a statutory share if \"it appears from the will that the omission was intentional\" or\r\n\"the testator provided for the child by transfer outside the will and the intent that\r\nthe transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 62-2-302(a)(1), (3) (2009). In light of the strong language in Brown's will that\r\nhis failure to provide for any other person \"claiming, or to claim, to be an heir\" was\r\n\"intentional and not occasioned by accident of mistake,\" we think this claim has\r\nsome weakness, although it presents a closer question. (Emphasis added.) We do\r\nnot believe, however, that this claim involving only one party can single-handedly\r\nvalidate the tenuous and unrelated claims of all of the remaining parties so as to\r\njustify the finding of a good faith controversy.\r\n\r\n       In sum, we question whether the claims were asserted in good faith since the\r\nprimary claim asserted by the parties as a basis for discarding Brown's\r\ntestamentary documents, undue influence, was of dubious validity. There was also\r\na major impediment to Tommie Rae's spousal claim that undermines confidence in\r\nthe court's finding of a good faith controversy. We further find the circuit court's\r\nstatement that the totality of the claims supported a good faith finding is\r\nunpersuasive, as it is based on the assumption that each claim met some threshold\r\nlevel of viability. To the contrary, we do not believe the cobbling together of\r\ntenuous claims can be the basis for a good faith finding that would justify the\r\ndrastic results sanctioned here. See 80 Am. Jur. 2d Wills § 982 (2002) (stating \"a\r\ncourt may decline to approve or enforce a settlement agreement which does not\r\nsettle a 'good faith contest or controversy,' as where an agreement seeks only to set\r\naside an otherwise valid will. In other words, a family settlement agreement may\r\nfail for lack of adequate consideration when there is lack of a reasonable or\r\nsubstantial basis for any claims surrendered by it.\" (footnotes omitted)).\r\n\r\n             (b) Requirement of a Just and Reasonable Agreement\r\n\r\n      Appellants further argue that, even if the compromise was of a bona fide\r\nchallenge to the will, it was not just and reasonable, which would preclude court\r\napproval under the statutory standard.\r\n\r\nto AABB guidelines and the laboratory cannot verify the origin of the DNA\r\nsamples.\").\r\n\n       In addition to the presence of a good faith controversy between the parties,\r\nthe ruling court must find \"the effect of the agreement upon the interests of persons\r\nrepresented by fiduciaries or other representatives is just and reasonable[.]\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 62-3-1102(3). Both parts of the two-part test must be satisfied to\r\nwarrant approval of a compromise agreement. In re Estate of Schroeder, 441\r\nN.W.2d 527 (Minn. Ct. App. 1989); see also In re Estate of Birch, 378 N.Y.S.2d\r\n792, 797 (App. Div. 1976) (stating where a necessary requirement for a\r\ncompromise agreement is lacking, the agreement may not be approved). Even\r\nassuming a good faith controversy existed among the parties, we agree that the\r\ncompromise should not have been approved because the record does not indicate\r\nthat the second element of the two-part test has been met.\r\n\r\n       Our state statute does not explicitly provide a standard for determining\r\nwhether a compromise is \"just and reasonable,\" nor does the Uniform Probate\r\nCode. A similar observation was made by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, which\r\nultimately \"conclude[d] that to be just and reasonable, an estate plan in a settlement\r\nagreement must defer to the testator's intent unless a departure from that intent is\r\nreasonably necessary to protect the interests of the beneficiaries.\" Schroeder, 441\r\nN.W.2d at 533 (citing Fratcher, IV Scott on Trusts § 337.6 (4th ed. 1989)). The\r\nMinnesota court noted this is consistent with the statutory scheme and it is also\r\nimplied by a comment to the Uniform Probate Code, which states, \"The only\r\nreason for approving a scheme of devolution which differs from that named by the\r\ntestator or the statutes governing intestacy is to prevent dissipation of the estate in\r\nwasteful litigation.\" Id. (quoting Comment, Uniform Probate Code, 8 U.L.A. § 3-\r\n1102 (1983)). The court observed an estate plan in a settlement agreement may\r\naffect a trust; \"[h]owever, an estate plan which differs from the testator's intent can\r\nbe approved only in limited circumstances.\" Id. 24\r\n\r\n       In Schroeder, the court found the decedent had clearly expressed her intent\r\nin a will executed with the requisite formalities and that the respondents had\r\nbrought a frivolous will contest in a collusive move to destroy a trust created by the\r\ndecedent. Id. at 534 (citing Bogert, Trusts § 152 (6th ed. 1987)). The appellate\r\ncourt found \"[t]o approve such a settlement agreement threatens to unravel two\r\nfundamental principles of probate law: (1) the paramount importance of carrying\r\nout the intention of the testator, and (2) the requirement that a testator express his\r\nintention with the requisite formalities.\" Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n24 A compromise approved by the court \"is binding even though it may affect a\r\ntrust or an inalienable interest.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-1101 (2009).\r\n\n       In determining that the settlement in the current appeal was just and\r\nreasonable, the circuit court observed there could be a potential beneficial effect if\r\na marital deduction was obtained and further stated that, in addition to dropping\r\ntheir claims, the settling parties had, as part of the compromise, signed over their\r\nfederal copyright termination rights. The circuit court found these rights could be\r\na significant benefit for the charitable beneficiaries because they might form a\r\nsubstantial portion of the future value of the estate. There was, however, no\r\nevidence presented as to the potential value of these rights that could be compared\r\nto the potential value the Respondents would obtain by having Brown's\r\ntestamentary plan voided.25 The court also opined that the settlement was\r\nnecessary to protect the charitable trust from the threat of litigation.\r\n\r\n       In our view, the evidence does not support the finding that the compromise\r\nwas just and reasonable. The compromise orchestrated by the AG in this case\r\ndestroys the estate plan Brown had established in favor of an arrangement overseen\r\nvirtually exclusively by the AG. The result is to take a large portion of Brown's\r\nestate that Brown had designated for charity and to turn over these amounts to the\r\nfamily members and purported family members who were, under the plain terms of\r\nBrown's will, given either limited devises or excluded.\r\n\r\n      Even if a good faith controversy had existed, the remedy more appropriately\r\nwould have been the reformation of the documents to provide for any monies\r\npayable, not the total dismemberment of Brown's carefully-crafted estate plan and\r\n\r\n25 The parties submitted a legal article indicating the copyright termination rights,\r\nor recapture rights, could be valuable, but the majority of the article focused on the\r\ninherent difficulties in obtaining these rights. As the author observed: \"So\r\ncomplicated and borderline byzantine are these requirements that leading copyright\r\ncommentators have characterized a successful termination of a copyright grant as a\r\nfeat 'accomplished against all odds.' \" Peter Afraslabi, Superman's Latest Episode:\r\nThe Rights of Authors and their Families to Terminate a Copyright Grant and\r\nRecapture the Copyright, Orange County Lawyer, Sept. 2008, at 37 (quoting Patry\r\non Copyright § 752 (2007)). This consideration, together with the fact that it could\r\ntake decades for some of these recapture rights to become available, makes their\r\npotential value as compared to any settlement amounts unclear. Moreover, the\r\nrecord also contains a proposal from an Atlanta firm regarding Brown's estate in\r\nJune 2007, in which it stated the value of Brown's estate had three major\r\ncomponents: (1) likeness/publicity, (2) property, and (3) Brown's music catalogue,\r\nof which it indicated Brown's publicity rights, not the music rights, were the most\r\nvaluable.\r\n\nits resurrection in a form that grossly distorts his intent. We find the compromise\r\nproposed here is fundamentally flawed because the entire proposal is based on an\r\nunprecedented misdirection of the AG's authority in estate cases. We also believe\r\nthat a departure from the testator's intent is not reasonably necessary to protect the\r\nbeneficiaries' interests because any alleged advantage to them occasioned by the\r\navoidance of further litigation, as propounded by the settling parties, is illusory at\r\nbest.  \"A will is an expression of a testator's intent to dispose of the testator's\r\nproperty after death.\" In re Estate of Pallister, 363 S.C. 437, 448, 611 S.E.2d 250,\r\n256 (2005). The right to make a will directing the ultimate disposition of one's\r\nproperty is one of the basic rights known to our civilization, and it encompasses the\r\nright to make it according to the testator's pleasure and in his absolute discretion,\r\nwhether judiciously or capriciously, justly or unjustly, subject only to the restraints\r\nupon the power of disposition that the law has imposed. In re Last Will and\r\nTestament of Smoak, 286 S.C. 419, 427, 334 S.E.2d 806, 811 (1985) (citation\r\nomitted); see also Mock v. Dowling, 266 S.C. 274, 278, 222 S.E.2d 773,\r\n775 (1976) (\"It is elementary that the statutory right of a competent person to\r\ndispose of [his] property as [he] wishes may not be thwarted by disappointed\r\nrelatives or by one who thinks the [testator] used bad judgment or was misled.\").\r\n\r\n        The law generally favors an agreement of compromise among family\r\nmembers to avoid a will contest or to promote the settlement and distribution of an\r\nestate. Duncan v. Alewine, 273 S.C. 275, 255 S.E.2d 841 (1979); Dibble v. Dibble,\r\n248 S.C. 165, 149 S.E.2d 355 (1966); see also In re Estate of Yeley, 959 N.E.2d\r\n888, 894 (Ind. Ct. App. 2011) (\"[T]he settlement agreement is a contractual\r\nagreement to transfer and distribute property among the parties so as to avoid\r\nlitigation.\"). However, \"[a] settlement agreement must defer to the testator's intent\r\nunless departing from his intent is reasonably necessary to protect the beneficiaries'\r\ninterests.\" In re Estate of Sullivan, 724 N.W.2d 532, 535 (Minn. Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n       In granting the AG's Motion to Intervene, to which no objections were\r\ninterposed, the circuit court ruled the AG was authorized to intervene pursuant to\r\nhis parens patriae, statutory, and common law authority. The AG undoubtedly has\r\nthe authority to intervene to protect the public interest of a charitable trust.\r\nHowever, the AG has no authority to become completely entrenched in an action\r\nthat began here as one to set aside a will and for statutory shares, direct the\r\nsettlement negotiations, and then fashion a settlement that discards Brown's will\r\nand his 2000 Irrevocable Trust and replaces them with new trusts, only to give\r\nhimself sole authority to select the managing trustee. By so doing, the AG has\r\n\neffectively obtained control over the bulk of Brown's assets and has given his\r\noffice unprecedented authority to oversee the affairs of the parties that has not\r\nheretofor been recognized in our jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n       \"The role of the Attorney General is as an overseer of charities representing\r\nthe public, the ultimate beneficiary of the charitable trust.\" In re Estate of Horton,\r\n90 Cal. Rptr. 66, 68 (Ct. App. 1970) (citation omitted). \"His duty is to remedy\r\nabuses in trust management.\" Id. (citation omitted). However, the AG is not \"in\r\nthe position of a super administrator of charities with control over, or right to\r\nparticipate in, the contractual undertakings of the charities.\" Id.\r\n\r\n         In discussing the duties of the attorney general as the protector, supervisor,\r\nand enforcer of charitable trusts, one treatise observes: \"As an adjunct to his\r\nenforcement powers, the Attorney General is frequently granted powers of\r\nsupervision and investigation regarding the administration of charities. However, .\r\n. . in the absence of a statute, this power does not extend to the continuous\r\noversight of a charity's administration when the settlor's intent is clear and there is\r\nno allegation of actual or threatened breach [of trust by a charitable trustee].\"\r\nRonald Chester, George Gleason Bogert, George Taylor Bogert, The Law of Trusts\r\nand Trustees § 411, at 25-26 (3d ed. 2005).\r\n\r\n        \"[I]t is axiomatic that a trustee is always under the direction and guidance of\r\nthe court . . . .\" Kingdom v. Saxbe, 161 N.E.2d 461, 466 (Ohio, Ashtabula County\r\nProb. Ct. 1958). Although the AG certainly has duties in regards to charitable\r\ntrusts, if he believed Appellants, as trustees, were not good stewards, the remedy\r\nwould be to seek their removal and replacement. Brown's 2000 Irrevocable Trust\r\ncontained a detailed procedure for the succession of trustees that was gutted and\r\nreplaced with provisions allowing the AG the sole authority to select the managing\r\ntrustee and to serve at his pleasure. 26 Cf. In re Estate of Ward, 23 P.3d 108, 112\r\n(Ariz. Ct. App. 2001) (\"The remedy for bona fide problems with the trustee is not\r\nrewriting a will or trust but replacing the trustee with a new trustee . . . .\").\r\n\r\n      Although the stated justification for the compromise was to avoid the\r\npotential of a substantial threat to the charitable beneficiaries occasioned by\r\nRespondents' claims, the compromise condoned by the AG here results in an\r\n\r\n26 Brown's trust agreement provided that, upon notice a trustee would no longer\r\nserve, the remaining trustees were to select a successor, and if they did not timely\r\ndo so, the obligation fell to the advisory board. If that also failed, then the\r\nselection was to be made by the court with jurisdiction over the trust.\r\n\noutright gift of half of the estate to the family members and purported family\r\nmembers who challenged Brown's will and trust based on tenuous claims. As the\r\nenforcer of charitable trusts, we believe the AG's efforts would have been better\r\nserved in attempting to make a cursory evaluation of the claims rather than\r\ndirecting a compromise which ultimately resulted in the AG obtaining virtual\r\ncontrol over Brown's estate. Based on all the circumstances, we do not believe the\r\neffect of the compromise is just and reasonable, and we cannot condone its\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nC.    Removal of Appellants as Personal Representatives and Trustees\r\n\r\n       Appellants next argue the circuit court erred in removing them from their\r\nfiduciary positions.27\r\n\r\n      Appellants assert the circuit court removed them without complying with the\r\nprocedures outlined in sections 62-3-611 (removal of personal representative), 62-\r\n3-614 (appointment of special administrator), or 62-3-616 (powers and duties of\r\nspecial administrator) of the South Carolina Code, and no statutory ground was\r\nclaimed or found justifying the removal of Appellants as trustees as required by\r\nsection 62-7-706 (removal of trustees).\r\n\r\n       Section 62-3-611 governs removal of a personal representative. Subsection\r\n(a) provides \"[a] person interested in the estate may petition for removal of a\r\npersonal representative for cause at any time\" and requires a hearing to be held\r\nafter notice. S.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-611(a) (2009).28 Subsection (b) provides\r\n\"[c]ause for removal exists when removal would be in the best interests of the\r\nestate . . . .\" Id. § 62-3-611(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27 Appellants further argue the circuit court erred in ordering them to sign the\r\ncompromise agreement, since their removal was effective \"immediately.\"\r\nAppellants' argument in this regard is now moot based on our holding the circuit\r\ncourt erred in approving the compromise agreement in the first instance, as their\r\nsignatures are effectively nullified by our ruling. As a general matter, however, we\r\nfind no error in a court directing fiduciaries to sign a compromise while ordering\r\ntheir removal, as it is understood the acts are to proceed in logical sequence.\r\n28 Section 62-3-611(a) was subsequently amended, but the change is not relevant\r\nto these proceedings. Act No. 244, 2010 S.C. Acts 1764.\r\n\n       Respondents contend the circuit court took up the issues related to\r\nAppellants' removal at the hearing to consider whether it should approve the\r\nsettlement agreement; thus, a hearing and the opportunity to be heard was afforded\r\nto Appellants. Further, all of the settling parties petitioned the circuit court for\r\nAppellants' removal well in advance of the hearing, thus providing adequate notice.\r\nIn addition, the circuit court found an irreconcilable conflict existed between\r\nAppellants and the settling parties because Appellants had expressed continuing\r\nopposition to their actions. Thus, the circuit court had cause to remove them and\r\nreplace them with a professional fiduciary.\r\n\r\n      We find the circuit court did not violate the statutory provisions regarding\r\nthe removal of personal representatives. Notice and a hearing were provided, and\r\nthe court had cause to remove them as it was in the best interests of the estate.\r\nWhile we ultimately agree with Appellants in the specific conflict over the\r\ncompromise agreement, we note the parties remained at odds over the handling of\r\nBrown's estate matters.\r\n\r\n        We are also aware that Appellants have sought $5 million in fees for their\r\nservices as fiduciaries for a relatively short interval of time. In addition,\r\nAppellants sought and obtained permission from the circuit court to sell iconic\r\nassets from Brown's estate in order to raise funds, and a large portion of the\r\namount raised went first to pay Appellants' own attorneys' fees. Appellants also\r\nunsuccessfully attempted to sell Brown's GRAMMY award at auction; the process\r\nwas halted only because officials from the National Academy of Recording Arts\r\nand Sciences reclaimed the award after informing Appellants that it was a long-\r\nstanding policy that the award could not be sold by recipients or anyone acting on\r\ntheir behalf. These actions and the extreme discord between the parties convince\r\nus that Appellants' continued service as fiduciaries is not in the best interests of the\r\nestate.As to section 62-7-706, regarding the removal of trustees, this provision is\r\ncited once by Appellants, but it is not otherwise discussed. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 62-7-706 (2009). Thus, Appellants have set forth no issue in this regard for the\r\nCourt's consideration. See Houck v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7,\r\n620 S.E.2d 326 (2005) (observing an argument is effectively abandoned if the\r\nappellant's brief treats it in a conclusory manner). The other provisions cited by\r\nAppellants concerning the appointment and duties of a special administrator\r\nlikewise afford no basis for relief here. See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 62-3-614, -616\r\n(2009).\r\n\n        We hold Appellants have shown no error in the circuit court's ruling\r\nremoving them from their fiduciary positions. However, in light of our decision\r\ninvalidating the compromise agreement, we likewise void Bauknight's\r\nappointment, which was made in conjunction with the settlement agreement, and\r\nunder which he was to serve at the pleasure of the AG.29 The circuit court should,\r\nupon proper application, appoint fiduciaries to oversee these matters in accordance\r\nwith the provisions for succession outlined in Brown's trust and estate documents.\r\nThe circuit court may consider at that time whether Bauknight should be appointed\r\nto fill a fiduciary position.30 In addition, the circuit court shall also review the\r\npropriety of all fees, including attorneys' fees and trustees' fees, paid in relation to\r\nthis action, and shall order all unearned fees or unapproved fees to be disgorged\r\nand returned to Brown's estate.  III. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       The circuit court did a commendable job in attempting to sort out this\r\ndifficult situation, but after considering the record and evaluating the positions of\r\nthe numerous parties who seek a share of Brown's estate, we conclude the\r\nsettlement reached in this case was not a fair and just resolution of a good faith\r\ncontroversy and that court approval is not appropriate.\r\n\r\n       The agreement served to transfer a large portion of the estate assets to\r\npersons who had been specifically excluded from Brown's will, in contravention of\r\nhis stated desires. Throughout the record, it is clear that Brown's oft-repeated\r\n\r\n29 The probate court appointed Bauknight to serve as a Special Administrator, but\r\nonly until the \"various orders related to the removal of the former Personal\r\nRepresentatives and the appointment of Russell Bauknight as Personal\r\nRepresentative have been finally concluded.\"\r\n30 We note the AG and/or Bauknight have allegedly entered into contingency-fee\r\nagreements with outside counsel, Kenneth Wingate, for Wingate to sue Appellants\r\non behalf of the State, Bauknight, and others while also representing private\r\nplaintiffs in the suit. We are aware that a suit has been filed in Richland County\r\nseeking damages to Brown's estate allegedly arising during Appellants' service as\r\nfiduciaries. Despite FOIA requests, the AG had refused to publicly release all of\r\nthe documents pertaining to this reported arrangement. However, the AG has\r\nrecently informed this Court, in petitions filed after this Court's initial opinion, that\r\nhe is now withdrawing as a party in that lawsuit and his office will maintain a\r\nmonitoring role.\r\n\nintent was to leave the bulk of his estate to charity for the education of needy\r\nchildren, as well as to provide up to $2 million for the education of his own family\r\nmembers. The settlement plan subverts that stated desire. The settlement\r\nprovisions allowing the AG to select the trustee, and his continued influence over\r\nthe trust overreaches his statutory authority, as there is no provision allowing an\r\nAG to become involved in the day-to-day operations of a trust. Moreover, the\r\nAG's primary job is the enforcement of charitable trusts, and in this case, the\r\ncompromise dismantles the existing charitable trusts, to great ill effect on Brown's\r\nestate plan, rather than enforces it. These facts all demonstrate that the agreement\r\nshould not be condoned by this Court, and we reverse the circuit court's finding to\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\n       We affirm the circuit court's removal of Appellants from their fiduciary\r\npositions, and, in light of our decision invalidating the circuit court's approval of\r\nthe compromise agreement, we likewise void the appointment of Bauknight. We\r\ndirect the circuit court, upon proper application, to appoint fiduciaries to oversee\r\nthese matters in accordance with the provisions of Brown's estate and trust\r\ndocuments, and to evaluate the propriety of all fees, as specified above, that are\r\nrelated to this case.\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, the order of the circuit court is affirmed in part and\r\nreversed in part, and the matter is remanded to the circuit court for further\r\nproceedings in accordance with this decision.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n     KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore,\r\nconcur. TOAL, C.J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I concur in nearly all of the majority's excellently\r\nresearched and learned opinion, with the exception of the finding regarding the\r\nremoval of the court-appointed fiduciaries. I continue to hold the opinion that the\r\ncourt ordered fiduciaries Pope and Buchanan should have been retained. However,\r\nin light of the fact that the rest of the Court sees this issue differently, I agree with\r\nall of the directives and holdings contained in the majority opinion with respect to\r\nthe further handling of these matters on remand. My agreement includes\r\nconcurrence in our ruling that, on remand, the circuit court should decide who to\r\nappoint as fiduciary and should review all attorney and other fees and order all\r\nunearned or unapproved fees to be disgorged and returned to Mr. Brown's estate. I\r\nalso write separately to comment on what I view as the government's\r\nunprecedented encroachment into estate administration, which had we accepted it,\r\nwould be the end of estate administration as we know it in this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n       As an initial note, I concur wholeheartedly in the portions of the majority\r\nopinion finding that the contestants had no good faith basis upon which to bring\r\ntheir claims against the estate and that the terms of the settlement were not just and\r\nreasonable. The effect of the circuit court's order is to allow a group of\r\n\"beneficiaries\" with highly questionable or completely invalid claims to agree with\r\neach other to receive benefits the testator chose to deny them without even having\r\nto take any steps toward substantiating the validity of their claims or verifying the\r\ntestator's incapacity. Had any steps been taken to verify their claims, I am of the\r\nopinion that the circuit court would have found all completely lacking in merit,\r\nwhich in turn would have lead to the disinheritance of every contestant of the will\r\nunder the no-contest clauses contained in the estate documents. See Russell v.\r\nWachovia Bank, N.A., 370 S.C. 5, 633 S.E.2d 722 (finding no-contest clause was\r\nvalid and enforceable where claims of undue influence lacked probable cause in\r\nthat they did not represent a bona fide inquiry into the testators carefully drafted\r\nestate plans).31\r\n\r\n\r\n31We upheld Judge Russell's estate plan, including the no-contest clause because it\r\ncould not be shown that Judge Russell lacked testamentary capacity or that his\r\nability to make decisions of this nature had been overborn by others. Mr. Brown is\r\nentitled to the same treatment. Mr. Brown's estate plan, including its no-contest\r\nprovisions, must be enforced because there has been no showing that he lacked\r\ntestamentary capacity or that his will was overborn by others. If we will uphold a\r\nno-contest clause in Judge Russell's case, where the issue of capacity was actually\r\ncontested, it is only just to uphold Mr. Brown's estate plan, including the no-\r\n\n       While I agree with the majority that the purpose of a settlement agreement is\r\nnot to litigate the merits of the claims against the estate, accusations in a complaint\r\nand inferences made from other fragmented facts in the Record cannot form the\r\nbasis of a good faith controversy to invalidate an otherwise carefully drafted estate\r\nplan. Instead, courts must require the settling parties to put forward some \"forecast\r\nof evidence indicating that at trial [they] would be able to show that a bona fide\r\ndispute existed as to the validity of the [estate provisions] in question.\" Holt v.\r\nHolt, 282 S.E.2d 784, 785 (N.C. 1981); see also O'Neil v. O'Neil, 155 S.E.2d 495,\r\n501 (N.C. 1967) (\"The record discloses no information as to the circumstances\r\nunder which the 'Will' was drafted. Nor does the record indicate what inquiries, if\r\nany, have been made to determine what testimony the draftsman and the witnesses\r\nwould give relevant to what occurred prior to and at the time of the execution of\r\nthe 'Will.'\"). Otherwise, it is impossible to say to that the claims were brought in\r\ngood faith. Further inquiry is especially important, where, as here, it appears the\r\ncontestants' chance of success on the merits was highly unlikely. Furthermore, any\r\nagreement sanctioning a windfall to these contestants which also simultaneously\r\ndefeats Mr. Brown's express desire that one hundred percent of that money go to\r\nfund the educational pursuits of needy children cannot be just or reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The fact that the AG has agreed to the settlement is of no consequence, as\r\nthe court is the ultimate arbiter of the merits of any settlement agreement devolving\r\nfrom a testator's express intent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       The AG has taken unprecedented action in this case. After effecting a total\r\ntakeover of Mr. Brown's estate by excluding its trustees and banding together with\r\nparties who stand only to gain from the invalidation of the testator's devise, the AG\r\ndisposed of the court-appointed trustees, created a new settlement entity, and\r\ninserted himself into the day-to-day operations of a newly created charitable trust,\r\nthe Legacy Trust. Along the way, a seemingly carefully executed testamentary\r\ndevise was completely disregarded without any sworn testimony that the\r\ndocument, itself, is somehow defective. In asking this Court to give our\r\nimprimatur to the settlement agreement, Respondents effectively asked us to\r\ndispense with the cardinal rule of trusts and estates law that the intent of the\r\n\r\ncontest provisions, where there was no real evidence-based challenge to Mr.\r\nBrown's capacity.\r\n\ntestator must prevail wherever possible. See Johnson v. Thornton, 264 S.C. 252,\r\n257, 214 S.E.2d 124, 127 (1975) (\"In determining this question we are guided by\r\nthe rule that in construing the provisions of a will the intention of the testator is the\r\nprimary inquiry of the court.\"); Limehouse v. Limehouse, 256 S.C. 255, 257, 182\r\nS.E.2d 58, 59 (1971) (\"The court's aim in construing a Will is to discover and\r\neffectuate the expressed intention of the testator.\"). Were we to accept the new\r\nestate plan, we would undermine any confidence citizens may have in their ability\r\nto do with their personal assets as they wish, leading to a chilling effect on future\r\ntestators in South Carolina wishing to make charitable testamentary devises, as the\r\nresult sought by the AG would permit him to become the effective \"super member\"\r\nof the boards of directors or trustees of these future testators' foundations whenever\r\nhe chose to intervene in the administration of their estates. Evelyn Brody, Whose\r\nPublic? Parochialism and Paternalism in State Charity Law Enforcement, 79 Ind.\r\nL. J. 937, 1034 (2004).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       As outlined by the majority, four months after intervening in the action,32 the\r\nAG convened a mediation in Augusta, Georgia, and intentionally excluded\r\nAppellants, the court-appointed fiduciaries of Mr. Brown's estate. During the\r\nensuing negotiations, the AG purported to \"settle\" the claims against the estate by\r\ncreating a new estate plan, under which nearly fifty percent of the residuary estate,\r\nwhich Mr. Brown left entirely to the Charitable Trust for the education of needy\r\nchildren, was now divided between some of Mr. Brown's adult children and his\r\npurported spouse. In settlement of these parties' claims against the estate, the AG\r\nand these family members created a new charitable trust, the Legacy Trust. The\r\nAG gave himself sole authority to select, remove, and replace the managing trustee\r\nof the Legacy Trust.33 Furthermore, the disinherited children and putative wife of\r\nMr. Brown were authorized to select a trustee from whom the managing trustee\r\n\r\n32Everyone agrees that the AG's initial intervention was proper amidst allegations\r\nof fraud and misappropriations of the trust funds by the original trustees, Bradley,\r\nDallas, and Cannon.\r\n33In fact, the settling parties represented to the circuit court that under the\r\nsettlement agreement, \"there will be a replacement of the currently serving\r\npersonal representatives and trustees with a managing trustee who will be\r\ncontrolled completely by the attorney general of South Carolina\" and that \"the\r\n[AG] under the documents has full power to remove and replace any trustee\r\nserving . . . as trustee of the . . . Legacy Trust.\"\r\n\nwould seek input and advice when managing the Legacy Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      In approving the settlement agreement, the circuit court observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      When the [AG] does appear in litigation involving a charitable trust\r\n      either by motion for intervention or being brought in by an\r\n      amendment to the pleadings, he has a right to take charge and control\r\n      that portion of the litigation which relates to the charitable trust . . .\r\n      This authority that allows the [AG] to control the litigation also\r\n      provides that the [AG] has exclusive authority, in order to protect the\r\n      public interest, to settle or compromise litigation . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Therefore, it is for the [AG], as the officer charged with the duty of\r\n      protecting charitable beneficiaries, to exercise his discretion as to the\r\n      appropriateness of a settlement. It is the responsibility of this Court in\r\n      reviewing the record to determine if the [AG] acted in good faith [in]\r\n      entering in this compromise agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        This is a gross misstatement of AG's authority. While the circuit court\r\nultimately approved the settlement, in my view, this erroneous statement of law\r\nsuggests that the circuit court did not engage in meaningful independent review of\r\nthe settlement because the court wrongly assumed that the AG had discretion to\r\nsettle the estate, with the court merely required to \"rubber-stamp\" any agreement\r\npresented to it by the AG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       It goes almost without saying that the AG, like the attorneys general of most\r\nstates, has common law and statutory authority to enforce trusts domiciled in the\r\n\nState of South Carolina. See S.C. Code Ann. § 1-7-130 (Supp. 2011).34 The\r\nprecedents relied upon by the circuit court and cited by Respondents are in line\r\nwith this position and stand for the proposition that the attorney general is the\r\nappropriate party to \"protect the interests of the public at large in the matter of\r\nadministering and enforcing charitable trusts.\" Epworth Children's Home v.\r\nBeasley, 365 S.C. 157, 163 n.3, 616 S.E.2d 710, 713 n.3 (2005) (citing Furman\r\nUniv. v. McLeod, 238 S.C. 475, 482, 120 S.E.2d 865, 868 (1961)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Epworth and Furman are foundational in that they define the role of an\r\nattorney general in our state jurisprudence; however, these cases cannot be read as\r\nbroadly as Respondents urge. In my view, these cases illustrate the traditional role\r\nof the AG's enforcement and oversight role in charitable trust administration, but\r\ndo not grant the AG a \"blank check\" authorizing the AG to do what he will when it\r\ncomes to charitable enforcement. Under the traditional model, the role of an\r\nattorney general in overseeing charitable entities is \"limited . . . to ascertaining that\r\ntrustee actions are permitted by, and not inconsistent with, the underlying trust\r\ninstrument, and safeguarding against fraud.\" Mark Sidel, The Struggle for\r\nHershey: Community Accountability and the Law in Modern American\r\nPhilanthropy, 65 U. Pitt. L. R. 1, 2 (2002); cf. 1 S.C. Jur. Attorney General § 14\r\n(\"The Attorney General is charged with responsibility for enforcement of the due\r\napplication of funds given or appropriated to public charities within the State of\r\nSouth Carolina. He is responsible for the prevention of breaches of trust in the\r\nadministration of public charities. His duty is to protect the interests of the public\r\nat large rather than those who may have an immediate or peculiar interest in a\r\ncharitable trust.\" (footnotes omitted)). This traditional oversight role, contrary to\r\nthe AG's view, \"does not include . . . a right to direct either the day-to-day affairs\r\nof the charity or the action of the court.\" Id. at 32 (citation omitted).35\r\n\r\n\r\n34I note that this power to enforce the trust is not exclusive. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n62-7-405(c) (\"The settlor of a charitable trust, the trustee, and the Attorney\r\nGeneral, among others may maintain a proceeding to enforce the trust.\" (emphasis\r\nadded)).\r\n\r\n\r\n35 The facts of both Epworth and McLeod exemplify the valid exercise of attorney\r\ngeneral enforcement power. In Epworth, 365 S.C. 157, 616 S.E.2d 710, the\r\ntrustees wished to terminate the trust in a manner that was violative of the settlor's\r\n\n       This viewpoint is very much in line with other state court and scholarly\r\nopinions. For example, in Midkiff v. Kobayashi, 507 P.2d 724, 745 (Haw. 1973),\r\nthe Hawaii Supreme Court aptly described an attorney general's role in charitable\r\ntrust administration as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The function of the attorney general, as parens patriae of charitable\r\n      trusts, is to oversee the activities of the trustees to the end that the\r\n      trust is performed and maintained in accordance with the provisions of\r\n      the trust document, and to bring any abuse or deviation on the part of\r\n      the trustees to the attention of the court for correction. The authority\r\n      of the attorney general over charitable trusts does not extend beyond\r\n      the performance of that function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(internal citations omitted).36\r\n\r\nintent, and the attorney general intervened to protect the charitable trust from\r\ndestruction. In McLeod, 238 S.C. 475, 120 S.E.2d 865, the attorney general was\r\nmade a party to protect the public interest when trustees sought to deviate from the\r\ntechnical terms of the trust.\r\n36 Importantly, the Hawaii Supreme Court found that the attorney general did not\r\nhave the authority to sanction trustee deviation from the provisions of the trust. Id.\r\nInstead, that court stated, \"If a deviation from any trust provision is necessary in\r\nthe interest of the trust, the power to authorize the deviation rests solely with the\r\ncourt.\" Id. Our facts are slightly different, but I think the import of this statement\r\nrings true in the present controversy, as the circuit court, in approving the AG's\r\nsettlement agreement, wrongly assumed that the AG had total control over the\r\nlitigation, and thus the court's approval was a foregone conclusion. The\r\nRespondents repeatedly proclaimed to the court that they sought court approval of\r\nthe agreement not out of legal necessity, but as a matter of course, because court\r\napproval of a private settlement agreement was not essential to its validity. In my\r\nview, in any instance where any party desires to deviate from the express terms of\r\na testamentary trust, meaningful court review is required. See, e.g., Brown v. Ryan,\r\n788 N.E.2d 1183, 1191 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003) (citations omitted) (holding while \"the\r\ncommunity has an interest in enforcing the trust and the Attorney General\r\n\n       Of course, this view of the AG's supervisory powers, embodied in reporting\r\nrequirements and other oversight and investigative tactics, does not mean that the\r\nAG has no role to play when a charitable trust is involved. In Estate of Horton, 90\r\nCal. Rptr. 66, 68 (Ct. App. 1970), the California court was presented with the\r\nquestion of how much involvement the attorney general should have in settlement\r\nnegotiations involving several charitable entities and other beneficiaries of a\r\ntestamentary trust. In approving the settlement agreement, the court defined the\r\nrole of the attorney general as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The role of the Attorney General is as an overseer of charities\r\n      representing the public, the ultimate beneficiary of the charitable trust\r\n      . . . . His duty is to remedy abuses in trust management . . . . He is a\r\n      necessary party to proceedings affecting the disposition of the assets\r\n      of a charitable trust . . . . It is his right and duty to participate in\r\n      proceedings to protect charitable gifts . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. (internal citations omitted). While the court found the attorney general \"has\r\nundoubted standing to seek redress in the courts of contracts entered into by\r\ncharities which are collusive, tainted by fraud or which demonstrate any abuse of\r\ntrust management,\" the court also found that the attorney general could not assume\r\n\"the position of a super administrator of charities with control over, or right to\r\nparticipate in, the contractual undertakings of the charities.\" Id.; cf. Mary Grace\r\nBlasko, Curt S. Crossley, David Lloyd, Standing to Sue in the Charitable Sector,\r\n28 U.S.F. L. Rev. 37, 47 (1993) (\"The attorney general does not . . . have a right to\r\nregulate the actions of a charity or to direct its day-to-day affairs. Courts have\r\ndenied the attorney general authority to intervene in suits contesting wills\r\ninvolving charities, to enforce obligations owing to charities, to intervene or appear\r\nfor the establishment of an invalid charitable trust, or to authorize deviations from\r\ntrust provisions.\" (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresents the community in seeing that the trust is properly construed and that the\r\nfunds are applied to their intended charitable uses[,]\" the state could not \"compel\r\nthe court to terminate the trust and end the relationship between the Trustees and\r\nthe Trust corpus.\").\r\n\n       While no one disputes the propriety of the AG's initial intervention amidst\r\nallegations of fraud by the original trustees, once the court appointed Pope and\r\nBuchanan as fiduciaries, the AG's involvement was no longer necessary to stave\r\noff maladministration of the Charitable Trust. At that point, the AG should have\r\nassumed a more passive role. Carl Schramm, Law Outside the Market: The Social\r\nUtility of the Private Foundation, 30 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 355, 372–73 (2006)\r\n(\"In general . . . government oversight is premised on a view of nonintervention in\r\nthe substantive decision-making and operations of foundations . . . . 'With few\r\nexceptions, the law neither attempts to control the decisions of managers, made in\r\ngood faith, as to how the purposes will be achieved, nor how their organizations\r\nwill be administered.' Generally, a state attorney general can pursue legal action\r\nagainst foundations in cases where charitable assets are in jeopardy (thus possibly\r\nviolating donor intent), and in cases involving illegal actions.\" (quoting Waldemar\r\nA. Nielsen, The Golden Donors: A New Anatomy of the Great Foundations 13, 110\r\n(1985))).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Instead, the AG took it upon himself to discontinue the court-appointed\r\ntrustees' administration of the trust in accordance with their fiduciary\r\nresponsibilities by settling the claims against the estate, and then proceeded to\r\ncreate an entirely new estate plan in which he has a direct role in the management\r\nand day-to-day operation of the Charitable Trust through the appointment, at will,\r\nof the managing trustee. Thus, the AG impermissibly crossed \"the line between\r\noversight and management\" in this case. Brody, supra, at 974. Absent any claims\r\nof fraud or mismanagement, the trustees should have been permitted to probate the\r\nwill in accordance with its terms or engaged in any settlement negotiations they\r\ndeemed necessary to protect the assets of the estate. Cf. Murphey v. Dalton, 314\r\nS.W.2d 726, 730–31 (Mo. 1958) (\"And trustees of a public charitable trust, like\r\ntrustees of a private trust, may bring actions against third persons to recover or\r\npreserve or protect the trust assets and may bring suits for instructions, and it\r\nshould follow that they may take any reasonable action (including the defense of a\r\nwill contest suit) necessary to uphold the validity of the trust established by a will\r\nand thereby protect and preserve the trust assets . . .\"). When the AG hijacked the\r\nproceedings here, the case was nothing more than a run-of-the-mill will contest\r\n(aside from the size of the estate).37 The AG had no authority to act as the lawyer\r\n\r\n\r\n37   Indeed, I question whether the AG has any role to play in a will contest. See\r\n\nfor the trust or the trustees by entering into this settlement agreement at the\r\nexclusion of the rightful fiduciaries. See Murphey, 314 S.W.2d at 730–31 (finding\r\nthe trustee was empowered to hire outside counsel to defend a will contest and\r\nstating \"the attorney general as the attorney for the public is not the attorney for the\r\ntrustee of a public charitable trust who was appointed by the settlor, and that when\r\nand under what circumstances the attorney general is a necessary or proper party to\r\na will contest or to any other suit involving a public charitable trust or when and\r\nunder what circumstances he should or must bring such action, has nothing to do\r\nwith the right of a trustee to be represented by counsel of his own choosing.\"\r\n(internal citations omitted)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, as noted by the majority, the testamentary documents, which\r\nare the guiding indicator of a testator's intent, absent a court finding otherwise,\r\nconferred upon the trust, acting through its trustees, and upon the estate, acting\r\nthrough the personal representatives, the power to compromise claims. Trust, Art.\r\nX(19); Will, ITEM VI; see also Bob Jones Univ. v. Strandell, 344 S.C. 224, 230,\r\n543 S.E.2d 251, 254 (Ct. App. 2001) (citation omitted) (\"In construing a will, a\r\ncourt's first reference is always to the will's language itself.\"); Limehouse v.\r\nLimehouse, 256 S.C. 255, 257, 182 S.E.2d 58, 59 (1971) (\"The court's aim in\r\nconstruing a Will is to discover and effectuate the expressed intention of the\r\ntestator. In searching for intention, however, we may not conjecture how the\r\n\r\n\r\nCom. ex rel. Ferguson v. Gardner, 327 S.W.2d 947, 949 (Ky. 1959) (\"The\r\ncontention that the Attorney General should be permitted to intervene and\r\nparticipate as a party in the present type of will contest does not appeal to this court\r\nas being independently sound in principle. The object of the contest is to determine\r\none issue, i. e. [sic], whether the papers probated are the last will and testament of\r\nEd Gardner. If not, nothing was thereby devised, bequeathed, or created to go to\r\ncharity, and there will be no administration to be supervised.\"); Spang v. Cleveland\r\nTrust Co., 134 N.E.2d 586, 591 (Ohio Com. Pl. 1956) (\"The object of this will\r\ncontest proceeding is to determine one simple issue: Whether the paper writing is\r\nthe last will and testament of the testatrix.

The object of the proceeding is not primarily, if at all, to\r\nterminate a charitable trust. The will contest proceeding may result in the\r\nnonexistence of a purported trust created by a paper writing, having no recognition\r\nin law as a conveyancing, assigning, transferring, bequeathing or devising\r\ninstrument.\" (emphasis in original)).\r\n\ntestator might have chosen to express himself had his mind adverted to the\r\nparticular contingency. Circumstances known to the testator at the execution of his\r\nWill are an admissible aid in construing doubtful provisions, but the main recourse\r\nmust be to the language used. We may not redraft the Will, nor may we doctor a\r\ncrucial part.\" (internal citations omitted)). There has not been a finding by any\r\ncourt concerning the validity of the will or the trust instruments. Therefore, the\r\nplain language of the testamentary documents only reinforces Appellants' claim\r\nthat the AG overstepped his authority in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        In sum, the Court has rightly decided that the AG simply does not possess\r\nthe sweeping and unprecedented authority he assumed in this case, perhaps best\r\nillustrated by the dearth of case law supporting the AG's position in our own\r\njurisprudence. The AG orchestrated the fabrication of an entirely new estate plan\r\nunder the auspices of his power to intervene in the litigation when settlement\r\nnegotiations in this case should have been undertaken (or not) by the trustees as the\r\nrightful fiduciaries of the charitable trust, and not the AG. The AG, absent claims\r\nof fraud or mismanagement, has no right to interfere in the operation of a validly\r\ncreated testamentary trust based solely on his statutory authority to enforce a\r\ncharitable trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Where discretion is conferred on a charity's board, proper state\r\n      enforcement action over fiduciary decision making reduces to a single\r\n      rule: The role of the attorney general and courts is to guard against\r\n      charity fiduciaries' wrongdoing, and not to interfere in decision\r\n      making carried out in good faith . . . . To this end, an attorney general\r\n      is vested with the authority to seek to correct breaches of fiduciary\r\n      duty that have not otherwise been remedied by the board. However,\r\n      the attorney general is not a \"super\" member of the board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrody, supra, at 1034.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Because the circuit court labored under the erroneous assumption that the\r\nAG had the right to control this litigation, failed to review the bona fides of the\r\nclaims against the estate, and approved a settlement that was entirely unjust and\r\n\nunreasonable based on the dubious claims of the contestants, I would further find\r\nthat the circuit court erred in removing Appellants as fiduciaries of the estate based\r\non the recommendation of the settling parties.38\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38 Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that the circuit judge, on remand, has the\r\nauthority to review the propriety of Bauknight's continued service to the estate in a\r\nfiduciary capacity. I further join in the majority's directive that the circuit judge\r\nshould proceed to review all fees awarded and requested up to this point in these\r\nproceedings, determine the appropriateness of such fees, and order the payment or\r\nthe disgorgement of such fees based on his calculations.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27233","title":"Sigmon v.

Sigmon,\r\n366 S.C. 552, 623 S.E.2d 648 (2005). We granted certiorari to review the circuit\r\ncourt's dismissal of Sigmon's application for post-conviction relief (PCR) and now\r\naffirm.          FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       Sigmon and Rebecca \"Becky\" Larke were in an intimate relationship for\r\napproximately three years. They were living together in her trailer when she\r\ninformed Sigmon she did not want to see him anymore. Becky's parents, Gladys\r\nand David Larke, lived next door to them in a trailer on the same property. David\r\nalso informed Sigmon that Becky wanted him to move out and served him with\r\neviction papers, stating Sigmon had to leave within two weeks. Becky\r\nsubsequently moved in with her parents. Sigmon believed she had begun a new\r\nrelationship and although he pleaded with her to come back, she refused. Sigmon\r\nbecame increasingly obsessed with Becky, stalking her in an attempt to verify she\r\nwas seeing another man.\r\n\r\n      About a week after Becky asked him to leave, Sigmon was drinking and\r\nsmoking crack cocaine with his friend, Eugene Strube, in Becky's trailer. At some\r\npoint in the evening, Sigmon decided he would go to the Larkes' home the\r\nfollowing morning after Becky left to take her children to school and tie up\r\nBecky's parents. When Becky returned home, Sigmon intended to kidnap her and\r\ndisappear with her, but he did not want her parents to be able to call the authorities.\r\nSigmon and Strube eventually ran out of crack and Strube fell asleep.\r\n\r\n        In the morning, after they saw Becky leave, Strube and Sigmon exited the\r\ntrailer. However, Strube changed his mind about helping Sigmon and left.\r\nSigmon grabbed a baseball bat from beneath his trailer and entered the Larkes'\r\ntrailer. Upon seeing Sigmon, David told his wife to bring him his gun, and Sigmon\r\nhit him in the back of the head several times with the bat. Sigmon then saw\r\nGladys, ran after her into the living room, and hit her several times in the head. He\r\nreturned to the kitchen where David lay and hit him several more times with the\r\nbat because he was still moving. He then went back to Gladys, saw that she was\r\nstill moving, and hit her several more times.\r\n\r\n     Sigmon retrieved David's gun and waited for Becky to return home. When\r\nBecky arrived, Sigmon brandished the gun, took her car keys, and forced her in her\r\n\ncar. He intended to pick up his own car and drive to North Carolina with Becky.\r\nHowever, she managed to jump out of the car and tried to run away. Sigmon pulled\r\nover and chased after her, shooting her several times. When he realized he was out\r\nof bullets, he got back in her car and fled. Although Becky was injured, she\r\nsurvived the assault and told the witnesses who came to her aid that Sigmon told\r\nher he had either tied up or killed her parents. Police officers were dispatched to\r\nthe Larkes' home where the bodies were discovered.\r\n\r\n      A manhunt ensued and Sigmon was eventually captured in Gatlinburg,\r\nTennessee after he called his mother, who was assisting the police in locating him.\r\nHe was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the Gatlinburg police\r\ndepartment where he confessed to murdering the Larkes and kidnapping and\r\nshooting Becky. He admitted that he intended to kill Becky and then kill himself.\r\nOfficers from Greenville arrived to transfer him back to Greenville, but, at\r\nSigmon's request, they took his statement before leaving Tennessee. He again\r\nconfessed to his crimes and stated his plan had been to kill Becky and himself.\r\n\r\n       Sigmon was indicted for two counts of murder; assault and battery with\r\nintent to kill; kidnapping and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\nviolent crime; first degree burglary; and grand larceny. The case proceeded to trial\r\nonly on the murder and first degree burglary charges. Sigmon conceded guilt and\r\npresented no evidence in his defense. The State presented expert testimony that\r\nboth of the Larkes died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head, describing the\r\nseverity of their wounds. Both sustained nine lacerations to the head, causing\r\nhemorrhaging and filling the sinuses with blood, so that they were breathing in\r\nblood as they died. It was estimated that both lived for three to five minutes before\r\ndying from their wounds. Additionally, both sustained defensive wounds to their\r\nforearms. The jury ultimately found Sigmon guilty.\r\n\r\n       During the penalty phase, the defense presented testimony regarding\r\nSigmon's mental state, such as his issues with childhood abandonment and neglect\r\nthat affected the development of his social mores and overall judgment, as well as\r\nevidence of an extensive history of drug use stemming from his \"recurrent major\r\ndepressive disorder\" or his \"chemical dependency disorders.\" Sigmon additionally\r\npresented evidence that he was adapting to prison life and that he was not a\r\nproblematic or difficult prisoner. Sigmon testified he was sorry for the crimes and\r\nadmitted he probably deserved to die.\r\n\r\n     The court charged the jury to consider three factors in aggravation: that two\r\nor more persons were killed, that the murder was committed during the\r\n\ncommission of a burglary, and that the murder was committed with physical\r\ntorture.   It also charged the jury to consider four statutory mitigating\r\ncircumstances: that the defendant had no prior history of criminal convictions\r\ninvolving the use of violence against another person; the murder was committed\r\nwhile the defendant was under the influence of emotional or mental disturbance;\r\nthe capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, or\r\nconform his conduct to the law was substantially impaired; and the defendant was\r\nprovoked by the victim. Although Sigmon requested a charge on the statutory\r\nmitigating circumstance of age or mentality, the judge declined to give that charge,\r\nnoting mental state would be covered by the other mitigating circumstances he\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\n       The jury ultimately sentenced Sigmon to death. On direct appeal, this Court\r\naffirmed Sigmon's convictions and sentences. Sigmon, 366 S.C. 552, 623 S.E.2d\r\n648. Sigmon subsequently filed an application for PCR. The State filed a return\r\nand motion to dismiss, and Sigmon amended his application, arguing his counsel\r\nprovided ineffective assistance in failing to properly preserve various issues for\r\nappellate review, failing to adequately present evidence of his mental state, and\r\nattempting to blame the victims for the crimes. Sigmon moved for summary\r\njudgment, submitting depositions of his trial attorneys. At the hearing, the PCR\r\ncourt ultimately dismissed Sigmon's application. We granted Sigmon's petition for\r\na writ of certiorari on the following issues:\r\n\r\n      I.     Did the PCR court err in failing to find trial counsel ineffective when\r\n             they failed to object to the solicitor's reference to his own opinion of\r\n             the death penalty during his closing statement?\r\n\r\n      II.    Did the PCR court err in finding trial counsel was not ineffective for\r\n             failing to argue that the trial court was required to charge the jury on\r\n             the statutory mitigating factor of the age and mentality of the\r\n             defendant at the time of the crime under Section 16-3-20(C)(b)(7) of\r\n             the South Carolina Code (2003) because evidence in the record\r\n             showed Sigmon was intoxicated during the commission of the crimes?\r\n\r\n      III.   Did the PCR court err in failing to find trial counsel ineffective for\r\n             failing to object to the trial court's charge on non-statutory mitigation?\r\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       To prevail in a PCR action, an applicant must satisfy a two prong test: he\r\nmust first show his counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of\r\nreasonableness, and he is then required to prove he suffered prejudice as a result of\r\ncounsel's deficient performance. Franklin v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 563, 570-71, 552\r\nS.E.2d 718, 722-23 (2001) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687\r\n(1984)). \"However, there is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate\r\nassistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant\r\ndecisions in the case.\" Edwards v. State, 392 S.C. 449, 456, 710 S.E.2d 60, 64\r\n(2011) (internal quotation omitted).\r\n\r\n        When a defendant challenges a death sentence, prejudice is established when\r\n\"there is a reasonable probability that, absent [counsel's] errors, the sentencer—\r\nincluding an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the\r\nevidence—would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\r\ncircumstances did not warrant death.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695. \"A reasonable\r\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of\r\ntrial.\" Rhodes v. State, 349 S.C. 25, 31, 561 S.E.2d 606, 609 (2002).\r\n\r\n       The applicant in a PCR hearing bears the burden of establishing his\r\nentitlement to relief. Suber v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886\r\n(2007). We will uphold the PCR court's findings if supported by evidence of\r\nprobative value within the record and we will only reverse where there is an error\r\nof law. Lomax v. State, 379 S.C. 93, 101, 665 S.E.2d 164, 168 (2008).\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.    CLOSING ARGUMENT\r\n\r\n       Sigmon argues the trial court erred in not finding his counsel ineffective for\r\nfailing to object to the State's closing arguments because the Solicitor expressed his\r\nown opinion as to why the death penalty was the appropriate punishment and\r\nthereby injected an arbitrary factor into the proceedings in violation of the Eighth\r\nAmendment and Section 16-3-25(C)(1) of the South Carolina Code (2003). We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n       \"A solicitor's closing argument must not appeal to the personal biases of the\r\njurors nor be calculated to arouse the jurors' passions or prejudices, and its content\r\nshould stay within the record and reasonable inferences to it.\" Humphries v. State,\r\n\n351 S.C. 362, 373, 570 S.E.2d 160, 166 (2002). \"When a solicitor's personal\r\nopinion is explicitly injected into the jury's deliberations as though it were in itself\r\nevidence justifying a sentence of death, the resulting death sentence may not be\r\nfree from the influence of any arbitrary factor . . . .\" State v. Woomer, 277 S.C.\r\n170, 175, 284 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1981). However, \"[i]mproper comments do not\r\nautomatically require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant.\"\r\nSimmons v. State, 331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998). \"The relevant\r\nquestion is whether the solicitor's comments so infected the trial with unfairness as\r\nto make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\" Id. at 338, 503 S.E.2d at\r\n166-67.\r\n\r\n      During his closing argument, the solicitor stated:\r\n\r\n      Now, when we asked for the death penalty, it's a fair and appropriate\r\n      question for you to say back to me, Solicitor Ariail, why do you think\r\n      that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment in this case? And\r\n      I can best summarize it by a response that I got from a juror in\r\n      another case on voir dire, and that juror said, as to her response in\r\n      her argument for the death penalty, that they’re [sic] are mean and\r\n      evil people who live in this world, who do not deserve to continue to\r\n      live with the rest of us, regardless of how confined they are. And\r\n      that's what the basis of our request for the death penalty is. There are\r\n      certain mean and evil people that live in this world that do not deserve\r\n      to continue to live with us.\r\n\r\n      ….\r\n\r\n      And there are people, there are people who will argue that the death\r\n      penalty is not a deterrent. But my response as the solicitor of this\r\n      circuit is, it is a deterrent to this individual and that is what we are\r\n      asking, is to deter Brad Sigmon and send the message that this type of\r\n      conduct will not be tolerated in Greenville County, or anywhere in\r\n      this State. And let that decision that you reach ring like a bell from\r\n      this courthouse, that people will understand that we will not accept\r\n      brutal behavior such as this. Thank you.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Trial counsel did not object.\r\n\r\n      When deposed for the PCR hearing, counsel stated he considered this\r\npersonal reference inappropriate, and it was his understanding that such statements\r\n\nwould be inadmissible. He further noted that if he had not objected to it, it was\r\neither because he “missed it or was oblivious.” Nevertheless, the PCR court\r\nconcluded that the statements would not justify an objection because they did not\r\ndiminish the role of the jury in rendering a death sentence nor were they\r\ninflammatory. Instead, it found the closing argument was overall tailored to the\r\nfacts within the record regarding the specific crimes at issue.\r\n\r\n       Although within this portion of the closing the solicitor appears to be asking\r\nthe jurors to accord some weight to his determination of the appropriateness of the\r\ndeath penalty, we do not believe the statements are objectionable within the\r\ncontext of his entire argument. Sigmon relies on Woomer in arguing that the\r\ncomments were inadmissible. In Woomer, we reversed a death sentence on direct\r\nappeal where the solicitor's argument plainly attempted to minimize the jurors'\r\nsense of responsibility in choosing death. Woomer, 277 S.C. at 175, 284 S.E.2d at\r\n360. We held the solicitor's statements were inadmissible because he repeatedly\r\nstated that he himself had undertaken the same difficult process. Specifically, he\r\nstated:[T]he initial burden in this case was not on you all. It was on me. I\r\n       am the only person in the world that can decide whether a person is\r\n       going to be tried for his life or not. . . . I had to make this same\r\n       decision, so I have had to go through the same identical thing that you\r\n       all do. It is not easy.\r\n\r\nId. at 175, 284 S.E.2d at 359. Unlike the statements in that case, we do not find the\r\nsolicitor's comments here diminished the role of the jury in sentencing Sigmon to\r\ndeath. Although the solicitor mentioned his own considerations, he did not go so\r\nfar as to compare his undertaking in requesting the death penalty to the jury's\r\ndecision to ultimately impose a death sentence. His statements were not designed\r\nto diminish the jury's role and therefore, did not result in the prejudice identified in\r\nWoomer.Instead, we find the statements more akin to those we upheld on direct\r\nappeal in State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d 364 (1990), where the solicitor told\r\nthe jury that \"if this [wasn't] a case in which a jury should impose the death\r\npenalty, if this [wasn't] the type of case in which the State should seek the death\r\npenalty and expect the death penalty, then there is none.\" Id. at 33, 393 S.E.2d at\r\n372 (alterations in original). He further implored the jury to \"do what is right,\"\r\nstating \"if it was not right in this case, it was never right.\" We held that these\r\nstatements were easily distinguishable from the statements in Woomer, noting they\r\n\ndid not lessen the role of the jury in sentencing death by mentioning the solicitor's\r\nrole in the process and did not contain the solicitor's personal opinions. As Bell\r\nillustrates, the solicitor has some leeway in referencing the State's decision to\r\nrequest death, provided he does not go so far as to equate his initial determination\r\nwith the jury's ultimate task of sentencing the defendant. Although the solicitor\r\nhere articulated why he chose to request the death penalty, he did not equate his\r\nrole with that of the jury.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, examining the closing argument as a whole, we find the\r\nsolicitor often emphasized the important role the jury played in determining the\r\nappropriate sentence. He acknowledged that this was a \"tough decision for [it] to\r\nhave to make\" but that it was \"a responsibility that the government places upon its\r\ncitizens.\" Although Sigmon makes much of the solicitor's frequent references to\r\nthe fact that he represented the State, we fail to discern the error. The jurors were\r\naware the State brought the charges against Sigmon and knew the State was asking\r\nfor the death penalty. It is reasonable to assume that the jury therefore inferred that\r\nthe solicitor believed death was the appropriate sentence. We therefore find trial\r\ncounsel were not deficient for not objecting to the State's closing argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n   II.    STATUTORY MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES\r\n\r\n      Sigmon also argues his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to obtain a\r\ncharge on the statutory mitigating circumstance of age or mentality because\r\nevidence at trial established he was intoxicated at the time of the murders. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n      We have held that where there is evidence that the defendant was intoxicated\r\nat the time the crime was committed, the trial judge is required to submit the\r\nmitigating circumstances in section 16-3-20(C)(b)(2), (6), and (7). State v.\r\nVasquez, 364 S.C. 293, 301, 613 S.E.2d 359, 363 (2005), abrogated on other\r\ngrounds by State v. Evans, 371 S.C. 27, 637 S.E.2d 313 (2006). Sigmon contends\r\nevidence in the record clearly demonstrates he was intoxicated at the time of the\r\nmurders and his trial attorneys were ineffective for not making this argument to\r\nobtain the charge of statutory mitigation for age or mentality. However, we find\r\nthere is evidence of probative value supporting the PCR court's finding that\r\nSigmon was not intoxicated at the time of the murders.\r\n\n       During the penalty phase, counsel requested a charge pursuant to section 16-\r\n3-20(C)(b)(7) on “the age or mentality of the defendant at the time of the crime”\r\nbased on the evidence presented as to Sigmon’s mental state at the time of the\r\nmurders. This mitigating circumstance would be in addition to the other mitigating\r\ncircumstances the court charged under section 16-3-20(C)(b): that (1) \"[t]he\r\ndefendant has no significant history of prior criminal conviction involving the use\r\nof violence against another person;\" that (2) \"[t]he murder was committed while\r\ndefendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance;\" (6) that\r\n\"[t]he capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to\r\nconform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired;\" and\r\nthat (8) \"[t]he defendant was provoked by the victim into committing the murder.\"\r\nThe trial court declined to charge (7), concluding any inference from mental state\r\nwas encapsulated in (6).\r\n\r\n       In his deposition for Sigmon's PCR hearing, trial counsel admitted that upon\r\nreading the statute anew, it did appear that subsection (7) was substantively\r\ndifferent from subsection (6), but also stated he had \"no knowledge or memory of\r\ndistinction on these issues then or now.\" He further stated that at trial he thought\r\n\"the facts were the thing that would carry the day, not any charge [the court]\r\nhappened to give about mitigation.\" The PCR court ultimately found there was\r\ninsufficient evidence of intoxication at the time of the crime to require charges\r\npursuant to section 16-3-20(C)(b)(2), (6), and (7) and thus found that it was not\r\nineffective assistance to only obtain charges on (2) and (6).\r\n\r\n       Although the record supports the conclusion Sigmon ingested drugs and\r\nalcohol prior to the murders, it does not establish he was intoxicated when he\r\ncommitted the crimes. At trial, Sigmon presented evidence through testimony of\r\nStrube and Dr. Morton that the night before he committed the crimes he smoked\r\ncrack cocaine and consumed alcohol. Dr. Morton testified that given Sigmon's\r\nhistory of drug use, the effect of the substances could last up to twenty-eight days.\r\nHowever, his testimony focused on Sigmon's other mental instabilities, such as his\r\nrecurrent major depressive disorder and his chemical dependency disorders, and\r\ntheir psychological effects; it did not pertain to whether Sigmon was intoxicated at\r\nthe time of the crime. Furthermore, Strube testified that on the night before the\r\nmurders, he and Sigmon were smoking crack cocaine and drinking beer, but ran\r\nout of crack at some point in the evening, and Strube went to sleep. Although this\r\nsupports the conclusion that Sigmon ingested crack and alcohol in the evening and\r\npossibly into the early morning, it does not necessarily indicate Sigmon was still\r\nintoxicated when he entered the Larkes' home the next morning.\r\n\n       Additionally, trial counsel stated in his deposition that he did not attribute\r\nSigmon's behavior to intoxication, but to psychological problems. He noted\r\nSigmon's issues with abandonment, which were exacerbated by Becky's behavior\r\nduring the break-up, stating Sigmon was \"wound up like a top when he committed\r\nthis crime.\" When asked whether he considered the drug and alcohol use as\r\nevidence of Sigmon's intoxication at the time the crimes were committed, counsel\r\nresponded, \"I absolutely cannot tell you whether we considered intoxication . . . I\r\ndon't remember ever thinking he was drunk.\"\r\n\r\n       Thus, the record supports the PCR court's finding that Sigmon was not\r\nintoxicated at the time of the murders, and therefore his attorneys were not\r\ndeficient for failing to argue that his intoxication warranted the charge of\r\nmitigating factor (7).\r\n\r\n   III.    NON-STATUTORY MITIGATING FACTORS CHARGE\r\n\r\n       Sigmon finally argues trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the\r\ntrial court's instructions on non-statutory mitigating circumstances because the\r\ncharge disparaged the legitimacy of this type of evidence. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       \"A jury instruction must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\"\r\nState v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 218, 499 S.E.2d 209, 215 (1998). \"The test to\r\ndetermine the propriety of the trial judge's charge is what a reasonable juror would\r\nhave understood the charge to mean.\" State v. Bell, 305 S.C. 11, 16, 406 S.E.2d\r\n165, 168 (1991). \"The sentencing jury in a capital case may not be precluded from\r\nconsidering as mitigating evidence any aspect of the defendant's character or\r\nrecord and any circumstances of the crime that may serve as a basis for a sentence\r\nless than death.\" Id. at 19, 406 S.E.2d at 170.\r\n\r\n      During the sentencing phase of the trial, the court charged the jury to\r\nconsider non-statutory factors of mitigation as follows:\r\n\r\n      [A] mitigating circumstance is neither a justification or [sic] an excuse\r\n      for the murder. It's [sic] simply lessens the degree of one's guilt. That\r\n      is it makes the defendant less blameworthy, or less culpable.\r\n\r\n      ….\r\n\n       A non-statutory mitigating circumstance is one that is not provided\r\n      for by statute, but it is one which the defendant claims serves the same\r\n      purpose. That is to reduce the degree of his guilt in the offense.\r\n\r\nSigmon argues the instructions improperly narrowed the evidence the jury would\r\nconsider in mitigation to factors relating specifically to the crime, to the exclusion\r\nof other evidence presented, such as Sigmon's adaptability to prison life,\r\nacceptance of responsibility for his actions, and remorse for the crimes.\r\n\r\n      However, Sigmon analyzes this language in isolation. The court's overall\r\ncharge to the jury included the instruction that the jury could consider:\r\n\r\n      whether the defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment for\r\n      any reason, or for no reason at all . . . . In other words you may\r\n      choose a sentence of life imprisonment if you find a statutory or non-\r\n      statutory mitigating circumstance, or you may choose a sentence of\r\n      life imprisonment as an act of mercy.\r\n\r\nThus, the court clearly indicated the jury's power to consider any circumstance in\r\nmitigation, and a reasonable juror would have known he could consider any reason\r\nin deciding whether to sentence Sigmon to death. We further disagree with\r\nSigmon's contention that the charge effectively reduced the weight of non-statutory\r\ncircumstances. The court did not describe those circumstances as \"not provided for\r\nby law,\" as Sigmon contends, but instead simply distinguished them from the\r\nstatutory circumstances by stating they were \"not provided for by statute.\" The\r\nqualification seems to have been added for clarity, not to inject a hierarchy into\r\nmitigating circumstances. We therefore find trial counsel were not deficient for\r\nnot objecting to the charge.  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       We find Sigmon has not presented evidence that trial counsel were deficient.\r\nIn light of this conclusion, it is not necessary for us to reach the second prong of\r\nprejudice in analyzing Sigmon's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the PCR court's dismissal of Sigmon's application for post-\r\nconviction relief.\r\n\r\n   TOAL, C.J., BEATTY, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

We find that under the South\r\nCarolina Constitution, the General Assembly had and exercised the power to\r\ndetermine the contribution rates of enrollees for the State's health insurance plan in\r\n2013. We hold the Budget and Control Board violated the separation of powers\r\nprovision by substituting its own policy for that of the General Assembly, enter\r\njudgment for the petitioners, and direct the Board to use the appropriated funds for\r\npremium increases.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nI.    THE STATE HEALTH PLAN\r\n       The State provides its employees and certain other persons with health\r\ninsurance through a statewide, group health insurance plan (the Plan). The persons\r\neligible for participation in the Plan, as set forth in Section 1-11-720 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2005 & Supp. 2012), consist of State employees and retirees, their\r\nspouses and dependents, and employees of numerous statutorily specified entities,\r\nincluding for example, counties, municipalities, and private organizations.\r\n\r\n      Prior to 1992, the Budget and Control Board received authority yearly to\r\nadminister the Plan through the annual appropriations act. In 1992, the General\r\nAssembly enacted Section 1-11-710 of the South Carolina Code, codifying the\r\nBoard's authority to administer the plan. As it existed prior to 2012, section 1-11-\r\n710 provided in relevant parts:\r\n\r\n      (A) The State Budget and Control Board shall:\r\n\r\n             (1) make available to active and retired employees of this State\r\n             and its public school districts and their eligible dependents\r\n             group health, dental, life, accidental death and dismemberment,\r\n             and disability insurance plans and benefits in an equitable\r\n\n            manner and of maximum benefit to those covered within the\r\n            available resources.\r\n\r\n            (2) approve by August fifteenth of each year a plan of benefits,\r\n            eligibility, and employer, employee, retiree, and dependent\r\n            contributions for the next calendar year. The board shall devise\r\n            a plan for the method and schedule of payment for the employer\r\n            and employee share of contributions . . . .\r\n\r\n            The amounts appropriated in this section shall constitute the\r\n            State's pro rata contributions to these programs . . . .\r\n\r\n            (3) adjust the plan, benefits, or contributions, at any time to\r\n            insure the fiscal stability of the system.\r\n\r\n            (4) set aside in separate continuing accounts in the State\r\n            Treasury, appropriately identified, all funds, state-appropriated\r\n            and other, received for actual health and dental insurance\r\n            premiums due. Funds credited to these accounts may be used\r\n            to pay the costs of administering the health and dental insurance\r\n            programs and may not be used for purposes of other than\r\n            providing insurance benefits for employees and retirees. A\r\n            reserve equal to not less than an average of one and one-half\r\n            months' claims must be maintained in the accounts and all\r\n            funds in excess of the reserve must be used to reduce premium\r\n            rates or improve or expand benefits and funding permits.\r\n\r\n            ....\r\n\r\n       On June 26, 2012, Act No. 278 was enacted, creating the South Carolina\r\nPublic Employee Benefit Authority (PEBA) as codified at Section 9-4-10, et seq.\r\nof the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012), and amending section 1-11-710 by\r\ntransferring the Board's powers and duties under that statute to PEBA.1\r\nAdditionally, the Act made PEBA's decisions subject to approval by a majority\r\n1The Act substituted \"Board of Directors of the South Carolina Public Employee\r\nBenefit Authority\" for \"State Budget and Control Board\" in subsection 9 of the\r\ndefinitions provision of Article 5, Section 1-11-703 of the South Carolina Code.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 1-11-703 (Supp. 2012). The Act also substituted \"board\" for\r\n\"State Budget and Control board\" in subsection A of section 1-11-710. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 1-11-710 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\nvote of the Board as set forth in Section 9-4-45 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n2012). The Act took effect July 1, 2012, and thus, as of that date, PEBA exercises\r\nthe powers formerly exercised by the Board in relation to the Plan, and the Board\r\nhas a veto power over PEBA's decisions.\r\n\r\n      Although nine of PEBA's eleven members had been appointed on or before\r\nthe August 15th deadline for setting the yearly terms of the Plan as specified in\r\nsection 1-11-710, only two members had taken the oath of office and only one\r\nmember had filed his statement of economic interests on or before that deadline.\r\n\r\nII.   THE 2012 BUDGET PROCESS AND THE PLAN\r\n      The State's budget and the Plan's budget operate on different timetables\r\nbecause the State's fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30, whereas the Plan's fiscal\r\nyear runs from January 1 to December 31. For that reason, in addition to any\r\npremium increases the General Assembly decides the State must cover in the\r\nupcoming Plan year, the State's budget each year must also cover the last six\r\nmonths of the insurance premium increases set by the Board on August 15th of the\r\nprevious year, an amount known as the \"annualization.\"\r\n\r\n       Employees covered by the Plan are split into \"general fund employees\" and\r\n\"non-general fund employees.\" General fund employees consist of State and\r\nschool district employees, and the premiums borne by the State through general\r\nfund appropriations cover these employees. See S.C. Code Ann. § 1-11-710. For\r\nfiscal year 2012-2013, general fund employees constituted 51.6% of the Plan's\r\nenrollees. Non-general fund employees work for those entities specified in section\r\n1-11-720, and if an employer entity chooses to provide insurance to its employees\r\nthrough the Plan, the employer is responsible for paying the employer portion of\r\nthe premiums—the portion borne by the State for general fund employees. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 1-11-720.\r\n\r\n       In November 2011, the Board produced a memorandum informing the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the Plan's needs in relation to the State's budget for fiscal\r\nyear 2012-2013. The memorandum stated the Plan required an annualization of\r\n$14.264 million and $15.767 million to cover new, general fund retirees. Also, the\r\nPlan's insurance premiums had increased over the past year by $79,705,991. Thus,\r\nto cover the premium increases for the first six months of the Plan's fiscal year, the\r\nPlan required $39,852,996. Removing the portion attributable to non-general fund\r\nemployees, the Plan required a premium increase of $20,564,146 for general fund\r\nemployees.\r\n\n       The memorandum presented the General Assembly with three options for\r\ndividing the premium increases between the State and enrollees. First, the General\r\nAssembly could split the premium increases evenly between the State and\r\nenrollees which would require an appropriation of $14.487 million for premium\r\nincreases, and when combined with the annualization and new retiree costs would\r\nnecessitate a total appropriation of $44.878 million. Second, the General\r\nAssembly could place the entire premium increase on the State which would\r\nrequire an appropriation of $20.564 million, and when combined with the\r\nannualization and new retiree costs would necessitate a total appropriation of\r\n$50.595 million. Third, the General Assembly could place the entire premium\r\nincrease on the enrollees which would only require appropriations for the\r\nannualization and new retiree costs, for a total appropriation of $30.031 million.\r\n\r\n      On August 3, 2012, the 2012-2013 Appropriations Act was enacted.2 In\r\nSection 80C under a heading for State employee benefits, and a subheading for rate\r\nincreases, the General Assembly appropriated $51,528,219 for health insurance\r\nemployer contributions.\r\n\r\n       On August 8, 2012, the Board convened and considered the Plan's benefits\r\nand contribution rates for 2013. First, the Board discussed what powers it\r\npossessed after the creation of PEBA and concluded the Board served in a de facto\r\ncapacity for PEBA because it did not yet exist. In the discussion of contribution\r\nrates that followed, all of the members of the Board acknowledged the General\r\nAssembly fully funded the premium increases such that enrollees would not bear\r\nany of the increases. However, by a three-to-two vote, the Board decided to split\r\nthe premium increase equally between the State and enrollees.\r\n\r\nIII.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n       Petitioners Bernadette Hampton, Jackie Hicks, and Carlton Washington filed\r\na petition for original jurisdiction and a complaint with this Court challenging the\r\nBoard's decision. Hampton is Vice-President of the South Carolina Education\r\nAssociation, Hicks is President of the South Carolina Education Association, and\r\nWashington is Executive Director of the South Carolina State Employees\r\nAssociation. The petitioners all participate in the Plan's health insurance by virtue\r\nof their employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  See South Carolina Legislature, 2012-2013 Appropriations Bill H. 4813,\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/appropriations2012/ta12ndx.php.\r\n\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED\n\r\n\r\nI.\t    Did respondents violate the separation of powers required by the South\r\n       Carolina Constitution?\r\n\r\nII.\t   Did the General Assembly unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority\r\n       to the Board to unilaterally increase Plan premiums?\r\n\r\nIII. \t Is the challenged conduct subject to an injunction and mandatory\r\n       reimbursement of premium increases to enrollees?\r\n\r\n                                LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. \t   SEPARATION OF POWERS\r\n       The petitioners argue the Board did not have the power, except in limited\r\ncircumstances not applicable here, to raise premiums for enrollees. They contend\r\nthat the Board thus violated the separation of powers required by the South\r\nCarolina Constitution because it substituted its policy choices for those enacted by\r\nthe General Assembly. We agree.\r\n\r\n      The South Carolina Constitution establishes three branches of government\r\nand requires they be \"forever separate and distinct from each other, and no person\r\nor persons exercising the functions of one of said departments shall assume or\r\ndischarge the duties of any other.\" S.C. Const. art. I, § 8. This mandate of a\r\nseparation of powers stems from \"the desirability of spreading out the authority for\r\nthe operation of the government. It prevents the concentration of power in the\r\nhands of too few, and provides a system of checks and balances.\" State ex rel.\r\nMcLeod v. McInnis, 278 S.C. 307, 312, 295 S.E.2d 633, 636 (1982).\r\n\r\n       At its simplest, the constitutional division of powers can be described as\r\n\"[t]he legislative department makes the laws; the executive department carries the\r\nlaws into effect, and the judicial department interprets and declares the laws.\"\r\nState ex rel. McLeod v. Yonce, 274 S.C. 81, 84, 261 S.E.2d 303, 305 (1979). In our\r\ndivision of powers, the General Assembly has plenary power over all legislative\r\nmatters unless limited by some constitutional provision. Clarke v. S.C. Pub. Serv.\r\nAuth., 177 S.C. 427, 438–39, 181 S.E. 481, 486 (1935). Included within the\r\nlegislative power is the sole prerogative to make policy decisions; to exercise\r\ndiscretion as to what the law will be. State v. Moorer, 152 S.C. 455, 479, 150 S.E.\r\n269, 277 (1929); Sutton v. Catawba Power Co., 101 S.C. 154, 157, 85 S.E. 409,\r\n410 (1915). The executive branch is constitutionally tasked with ensuring \"that the\r\n\nlaws be faithfully executed.\" S.C. Const. art. IV, § 15. Of course, the executive\r\nbranch, including the Board, may exercise discretion in executing the laws, but\r\nonly that discretion given by the legislature. See Moorer, 152 S.C. at 478, 150 S.E.\r\nat 277. Thus, while non-legislative bodies may make policy determinations when\r\nproperly delegated such power by the legislature, absent such a delegation,\r\npolicymaking is an intrusion upon the legislative power.\r\n\r\n      Respondents contend they had complete discretion to take the challenged\r\naction because the General Assembly simply appropriated the $51 million without\r\nany indication as to what the funds were appropriated for. In other words, the\r\nrespondents argue the General Assembly did not direct the Board to fund the\r\npremium increases through any particular means, rather the Plan received a general\r\nappropriation of $51 million and the Board was required to decide how those funds\r\nshould be spent. Alternatively, the respondents assert the Board had the power to\r\ndecline the appropriated funds and unilaterally set the State and enrollee\r\ncontribution rates. We reject both contentions.\r\n\r\n       We accept the unremarkable principle asserted by the respondents and\r\nacknowledged by other jurisdictions that an appropriation is only a spending cap,\r\nnot a spending mandate, and therefore, an executive agency is generally not\r\nrequired to spend all appropriated funds. See, e.g., Detroit City Council v. Mayor\r\nof Detroit, 537 N.W.2d 177, 181 (Mich. 1995) (\"[A]n appropriation is not a\r\n'mandate' to spend.\"); Island Cnty. Comm. on Assessment Ratios v. Dept. of\r\nRevenue, 500 P.2d 756, 763 (Wash. 1972) (\"An appropriation of public monies by\r\nthe legislature is not a mandate to spend, rather it is an authorization given by the\r\nlegislature to a designated agency to use not to exceed a stated sum for specified\r\npurposes.\"); see also 81A C.J.S. States § 399 (2012) (\"The appropriation is . . .\r\nmerely an authorization to spend the appropriated sums.\"). To require otherwise\r\nwould be to force agencies to waste tax dollars, rather than to encourage the\r\nefficient delivery of governmental services.\r\n\r\n       However, as established by this Court and decisions from other jurisdictions,\r\nan executive agency's power to decline to use all appropriated funds does not exist\r\nwhen there is a legislative mandate requiring the expenditure of those funds. We\r\nhave made clear that \"[t]he General Assembly has the duty and authority to\r\nappropriate money as necessary for the operation of the agencies of government\r\nand has the right to specify the conditions under which appropriated monies shall\r\nbe spent.\" Edwards v. State, 383 S.C. 82, 90, 678 S.E.2d 412, 416 (2009).\r\nFurthermore, where the General Assembly directs that appropriated funds be\r\ntreated in a particular manner, executive agencies must comply with those\r\n\ndirections. See id. at 91, 678 S.E.2d at 417 (holding that the \"General Assembly\r\nhas the authority to mandate that the Governor apply for federal funds which it has\r\nappropriated\" and the Governor must comply with that mandate).\r\n\r\n        Other jurisdictions, while generally recognizing that an executive agency\r\nmay decline to spend appropriated funds, also acknowledge that a statute may\r\ndeprive an agency of that power by directing the expenditure of the funds. For\r\nexample, in Ellis v. City of Valdez, 686 P.2d 700 (Alaska 1984), the Alaska\r\nSupreme Court recognized that beyond the usual appropriation of funds by the\r\nlegislature, in some instances the legislature \"both sets aside funds to be used by an\r\nadministering authority for a particular purpose, and affirmatively directs the\r\nauthority to accomplish the specified purpose.\" Id. at 705. The court went on to\r\nconsider an appropriation of funds to purchase property and an agency's decision\r\nnot to purchase the property. Id. at 704-06. The court concluded that because\r\nthere was no \"indication of a legislative mandate directing [the agency] to acquire\r\n[the property],\" the agency was under no statutory duty to purchase the property.\r\nId. at 706.\r\n\r\n       Similarly, in Felicetti v. Secretary of Communities & Development, 438\r\nN.E.2d 343 (Mass. 1982), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court considered\r\nwhether an executive agency acted contrary to an appropriations act by refusing to\r\nuse appropriated funds. Id. at 344. The agency interpreted the act as requiring\r\nfederal approval of the state's energy assistance plan prior to the agency releasing\r\nthe funds to eligible individuals. Id. at 345. The court disagreed and construed the\r\nact as requiring the funds be distributed prior to federal approval. Id. at 346. The\r\ncourt noted that while executive agencies normally may decline to spend\r\nappropriated funds, that principle was not applicable because the agency's \"action\r\nin withholding the funds effectively contravened Legislative policy.\" Id. Thus, the\r\ncourt held the agency's failure to use the appropriated funds as specified violated\r\nthe appropriations act. Id. at 347.\r\n\r\n       In light of the appropriations act and section 1-11-710, we find the General\r\nAssembly mandated the appropriated funds be spent in full on the premium\r\nincreases and afforded the Board no discretion as to enrollee premiums. The 2012-\r\n2013 Appropriations Act expressed the clear intent of the General Assembly that\r\nthe entire $51 million appropriation be spent on the premium increases and\r\nenrollees not bear any of the premium increase. Under a subheading entitled \"Rate\r\nIncreases,\" the $51 million was listed as being appropriated for \"HLTH\r\nINSURANCE-EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS.\" Also, the amount, while\r\nslightly more than, closely corresponded to the amount specified in the Board's\r\n\nreport to the General Assembly as necessary if the General Assembly decided the\r\nState should cover all of the premium increases. In short, in appropriating this\r\namount for that purpose, the General Assembly made clear it had decided the State\r\nwould bear all of the premium increase.3 Furthermore, the members of the Board\r\nall acknowledged that the appropriation indicated that intent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The respondents dispute this conclusion by pointing to prior appropriations acts\r\nin which the General Assembly included provisos limiting the ability of the Board\r\nto raise enrollee premiums and the lack of such a proviso in the 2012-2013\r\nAppropriations Act. For example, Proviso 63B.5 of the 1998-1999 Appropriations\r\nAct provided: \"When devising a plan for the method and schedule of payment for\r\nthe employer and employee share of contributions for Plan Year 1999, the Board\r\nshall not increase the contribution rates nor decrease benefits for State Health Plan\r\nparticipants.\" The respondents assert this language indicates the General Assembly\r\nunderstands that without such limitations, the Board can freely spend less than the\r\nfull amount appropriated for premium increases. While provisos are useful where\r\nan appropriations act is open to interpretation, when an appropriation is clear, a\r\nproviso is unnecessary. Here, the appropriation was clear—the Board was to use\r\nall of the appropriated funds to cover the premium increases—and thus the lack of\r\na proviso is immaterial.\r\n\r\n      Likewise the respondents argue the inclusion of a \"carry-over\" provision in\r\nthe 2012-2013 Appropriations Act demonstrates the General Assembly's\r\nrecognition that the Board can decline to spend the appropriated funds on premium\r\nincreases. Contrary to the respondents' assertions, the carry-over provision is\r\ncompatible with the Board having to use all funds appropriated for premium\r\nincreases for that purpose because other sources of carry-over funds exist. For\r\nexample, the Plan's costs for a particular year may be less than anticipated and the\r\nsurplus funds could be carried-over to the next year.\r\n\r\n      The respondents also assert the General Assembly's attempt to amend\r\nsection 1-11-710 through the 2000-2001 Appropriations Act indicates the Board\r\nhas the power to decline appropriated funds. Section 21 of the 2000-2001\r\nAppropriations Act as passed by the General Assembly would have restricted the\r\nBoard's ability to raise enrollee contribution rates; however, Governor Hodges\r\nvetoed Section 21. Again, while the General Assembly there expressed a desire to\r\ncodify specific restrictions on the Board's powers in relation to the Plan, that is\r\nimmaterial in light of the General Assembly's clear intent for the Board to spend all\r\n\n       Additionally, section 1-11-710 mandates the expenditure of the funds\r\nappropriated for premium increases, and thus the Board does not have the power to\r\ndecline to spend all of the appropriated funds. Section 1-11-710(A)(1) provides\r\nthe Board shall make available to enrollees a group health plan with \"maximum\r\nbenefit to those covered within available resources.\" Therefore, the statute requires\r\nthat the Board use all appropriated funds, because to do otherwise—to decline\r\nfunds and instead place a greater burden on enrollees—would contravene the\r\nmandate to provide \"maximum benefit . . . within available resources.\" In other\r\nwords, section 1-11-710 directs the expenditure of the funds and thus deprives the\r\nBoard of the power to decline to spend the appropriated funds.\r\n\r\n       Finally, we are guided in our consideration of section 1-11-710 and the\r\n2012-2013 Appropriations Act by the nondelegation doctrine. That doctrine is a\r\ncomponent of the separation of powers doctrine and prohibits the delegation of one\r\nbranch's authority to another branch. Bauer v. S.C. State Hous. Auth., 271 S.C.\r\n219, 232, 246 S.E.2d 869, 876 (1978). While the legislature may not delegate its\r\npower to make laws, it may \"authorize an administrative agency or board to 'fill up\r\nthe details' by prescribing rules and regulations for the complete operation and\r\nenforcement of the law within its expressed general purpose.\" S.C. State Hwy.\r\nDept. v. Harbin, 226 S.C. 585, 594, 86 S.E.2d 466, 470 (1955) (citations omitted).\r\nTherefore, so long as a statute does not give an agency \"unbridled, uncontrolled or\r\narbitrary power,\" it is not a delegation of legislative power. Bauer, 271 S.C. at\r\n233, 246 S.E.2d at 876.\r\n\r\n        In a somewhat similar case, the Board adopted a plan to reduce\r\nappropriations under the 1992 Appropriations Act because of projected revenue\r\nshortfalls. Gilstrap v. S.C. Budget & Control Bd., 310 S.C. 210, 423 S.E.2d 101\r\n(1992). The Board's action was challenged as beyond its statutory authority, and\r\nwe found that construing the statute as allowing the Board to reduce appropriations\r\nwith the only limitation being that its reductions be as uniform as possible would\r\nviolate the nondelegation doctrine. Id. at 216, 423 S.E.2d at 105. We held that\r\n\"[i]f the Act is so broad as to allow the Board to apply reductions with the only\r\nrequirement being that they be applied uniformly, the effect would be to allow the\r\nBoard to appropriate funds with unbridled discretion.\" Id. Accordingly, we\r\nrefused to construe the statute as unconstitutional when a constitutional reading\r\nwas possible, and held the Board did not have the claimed discretion to reduce\r\nappropriations. Id.\r\n\r\nof the 2012-2013 appropriated funds on the premium increases and section 1-11-\r\n710's clear mandate that the Board spend all appropriated funds.\r\n\n       Here, if the Board could decline appropriated funds based on its own policy\r\nchoices, it would have the unbridled power to disregard the General Assembly's\r\nappropriations and make its own appropriations decisions. See id. at 212, 423\r\nS.E.2d at 103 (holding that the appropriation of public funds is a legislative\r\nfunction and that the Board's claimed power to reduce appropriations according to\r\nits own criteria would be an impermissible delegation of legislative powers).\r\nFurthermore, if the Board can make its own choices as to enrollee premiums based\r\nsolely on what it believes to be the best policy, the legislature has impermissibly\r\ndelegated its powers to the Board. Therefore, to interpret section 1-11-710 and the\r\n2012-2013 Appropriations Act as giving the Board the power to decline\r\nappropriated funds and instead set contribution rates at the level it desires would\r\nconstitute an impermissible delegation of legislative powers in violation of the\r\nseparation of powers. We will not construe statutes to be unconstitutional when\r\nsusceptible to a constitutional interpretation. Joytime Distributors & Amusement\r\nCo., Inc. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 640, 528 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1999). That constraint\r\non our interpretation of the statutes further supports our conclusion that the Board\r\nlacked the power to decline the appropriated funds.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, we hold the Board violated the separation of powers by acting\r\nbeyond its statutory authority and infringing upon the General Assembly's power to\r\nmake policy determinations, when it declined to use the appropriated funds for the\r\npremium increases and instead raised enrollee contribution rates.\r\n\r\nII.    NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE\r\n       Having found that the Board violated the separation of powers in declining\r\nthe appropriated funds and setting a different enrollee contribution rate, we need\r\nnot consider the petitioners' assertion that the Board violated the nondelegation\r\ndoctrine. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613,\r\n518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (declining to address the remaining issues where a\r\nprior issue was dispositive).\r\n\r\nIII.   INJUNCTION AND REIMBURSEMENT\r\n      Petitioners request an injunction prohibiting the increase of their insurance\r\npremiums and compelling the Board to utilize the funds appropriated in the 2012-\r\n2013 Appropriations Act for premium increases. The respondents contend an\r\ninjunction is not warranted because they will comply with this Court's ruling. An\r\ninjunction is a drastic equitable remedy courts may use in their discretion in order\r\nto prevent irreparable harm to a party. Denman v. City of Columbia, 387 S.C. 131,\r\n\n140-41, 691 S.E.2d 465, 470 (2010). Due to its drastic and extraordinary nature,\r\ncourts should issue injunctions with caution and only where no adequate remedy\r\nexists at law. Strategic Res. Co. v. BCS Life Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 540, 544, 627\r\nS.E.2d 687, 689 (2006). Petitioners do not face irreparable harm as any premiums\r\npaid could be returned. Also, the declaratory judgment entered herein provides\r\npetitioners with an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, an injunction is not\r\nnecessary.4                     CONCLUSION\r\n      For the reasons set forth, we enter judgment for the petitioners and declare\r\nthe Board's premium increase unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of\r\npowers. We direct the Board to apply the appropriated funds to the Plan's premium\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Petitioners also sought the reimbursement to enrollees of all premium increases\r\npaid as a result of the Board's decision. The increased premiums were to be\r\ncollected from enrollees starting on January 1, 2013. However, on November 30,\r\n2012, the collection of the increased premiums was stayed by order of the Court.\r\nAccordingly, no increased premiums were collected from enrollees, there are no\r\nfunds to return to enrollees, and the petitioners' request is moot.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27246","title":"C-Sculptures v.

C-\r\nSculptures, LLC v. Brown, 394 S.C. 519, 716 S.E.2d 678 (Ct. App. 2011). We\r\n\nreverse, for we find the arbitrator exceeded his powers, as his decision constitutes a\r\n\"manifest disregard of the law.\" See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-48-130 (Supp. 2012);\r\nGissel v. Hart, 382 S.C. 235, 676 S.E.2d 320 (2009).\r\n\r\n                                           I.\r\n\r\nThe underlying dispute arises from a construction contract whereby Respondent C-\r\nSculptures, LLC, a general contractor, agreed to build a home for Petitioners\r\nGregory and Kerry Brown. The contract price was in excess of $800,000.\r\nHowever, Respondent only possessed what is referred to as a Group II license,\r\nlimiting Respondent to construction projects that did not exceed $100,000. A\r\ndispute arose between the parties, and Respondent filed an action in circuit court\r\nseeking to enforce a mechanic's lien against Petitioners. Upon Petitioners' motion\r\nand pursuant to an arbitration clause in the parties' contract, the circuit court matter\r\nwas stayed pending arbitration.\r\n\r\nPetitioners sought to have the matter dismissed after they learned Respondent held\r\nonly a Group II license. In a detailed memorandum in support of their motion to\r\ndismiss, Petitioners argued that Respondent did not have a valid license and was\r\ntherefore prohibited from bringing a legal or equitable action to enforce the\r\ncontract pursuant to S.C. Code Ann section 40-11-370(C) (Supp. 2012).1\r\n\r\nThe arbitrator was apprised of the applicable law, but nevertheless denied\r\nPetitioners' motion to dismiss \"after due consideration of all the evidence and\r\nauthorities presented by the parties in this Arbitration.\" Respondent prevailed at\r\narbitration, receiving an award of damages and an award of attorney's fees as the\r\nprevailing party pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. section 29-5-10(b) (Supp. 2012).\r\nPetitioners challenged the arbitration award, contending the arbitrator's denial of\r\ntheir motion to dismiss amounted to a manifest disregard of the law. Following\r\nadverse decisions in the circuit court and the court of appeals, we granted a writ of\r\ncertiorari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Section 40-11-370(C) provides: \"An entity which does not have a valid\r\nlicense as required by this chapter may not bring an action either at law or in\r\nequity to enforce the provisions of a contract. . . .\"\r\n\n                                          II.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has a strong policy favoring resolution of disputes through\r\nalternative dispute resolution, including arbitration. See Gissel v. Hart, 382 S.C.\r\n235, 240, 676 S.E.2d 320, 323 (2009) (\"Arbitration is a favored method of disputes\r\nin South Carolina\"). \"Generally, an arbitration award is conclusive and courts will\r\nrefuse to review the merits of an award.\" Id. at 241, 676 S.E.2d at 323. An award\r\nwill be vacated only under narrow, limited circumstances, inter alia, \"when the\r\narbitrator exceeds his or her powers and/or manifestly disregards or perversely\r\nmisconstrues the law.\" Id. (citing Tech. College v. Lucas & Stubbs, 286 S.C. 98,\r\n333 S.E.2d 781 (1985)). This Court has held that for a court to vacate an\r\narbitration award based upon an arbitrator's \"manifest disregard for the law,\" the\r\n\"governing law ignored by the arbitrator must be well defined, explicit, and clearly\r\napplicable.\" Id. Indeed, \"[a]n arbitrator's 'manifest disregard of the law,' as a basis\r\nfor vacating an arbitration award occurs when the arbitrator knew of a governing\r\nlegal principle yet refused to apply it.\" Id. at 241-42, 676 S.E.2d at 323.\r\n\r\n                                         III.\r\n\r\nPetitioners argue the court of appeals erred in refusing to find the arbitrator\r\nmanifestly disregarded the law in declining to dismiss the action. They maintain\r\nthe plain language of section 40-11-370(C) is clear, defined, explicit, and\r\nunquestionably applicable, yet the arbitrator simply chose to ignore it. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"Under the plain meaning rule, it is not the court's place to change the meaning of a\r\nclear and unambiguous statute.\" Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d\r\n578, 581 (2000). \"Where the statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and\r\nconveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not\r\nneeded and the court has no right to impose another meaning.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed that Respondent is a \"general contractor\" that performs \"general\r\nconstruction\" within the meaning of section 40-11-20(8) and (9) of the South\r\nCarolina Code. Section 40-11-30 states:\r\n\r\n      No entity or individual may practice as a contractor by performing or\r\n      offering to perform contracting work for which the total cost of\r\n      construction is greater than five thousand dollars for general\r\n      contracting . . . without a license issued in accordance with this\r\n      chapter.\r\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 40-11-30 (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nA contractor's failure to hold a license required by section 40–11–30 is governed\r\nby section 40–11–370 of the South Carolina Code, which provides in pertinent\r\npart: (A)It is unlawful to use the term \"licensed contractor\" or to perform or\r\n         offer to perform general or mechanical construction without first\r\n         obtaining a license as required by this chapter.\r\n      ….\r\n\r\n      (C)An entity which does not have a valid license as required by this\r\n         chapter may not bring an action either at law or in equity to\r\n         enforce the provisions of a contract. . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe term \"valid\" is clear and unambiguous, and leaves no room for statutory\r\nconstruction. Respondent admits it did not have the appropriate license, yet\r\nattempts to avoid the door-closing effect of section 40-11-370(C) by claiming it\r\nwas merely \"under-licensed.\" The statute manifestly forecloses Respondent's\r\ninterpretation, as the term \"valid\" does not give rise to the slightest ambiguity.2\r\nOur case law is in accord.\r\n\r\nIn Duckworth v. Cameron, 270 S.C. 647, 244 S.E.2d 217 (1978), a residential\r\nhome builder, who was not licensed, entered into a contract for the construction of\r\na house. This Court analyzed a similar statute that prohibited a residential home\r\nbuilder who did not have the required license from bringing an action to enforce\r\nthe contract. We found the statute \"clear and unambiguous. Any builder who\r\nviolates the chapter by entering into a contract for home construction without\r\nobtaining the required license simply cannot enforce the contract.\" Id. at 649, 244\r\nS.E.2d at 218 (emphasis added); see also Earthscapes Unlimited, Inc. v. Ulbrich,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Moreover, section 40-11-270(A) provides that \"[a] licensee is confined to the\r\nlimitations of the licensee's license group and license classifications or\r\nsubclassifications as provided in this chapter.\"\r\n\n390 S.C. 609, 614, 703 S.E.2d 221, 224 (2010) (recognizing but not enforcing\r\nsection 40-11-370(B) because \"Appellants did not raise section 40-11-370 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code as an affirmative defense at any stage in the proceeding\r\nbelow, we find this affirmative defense was not properly pled\"); Skiba v. Gessner,\r\n374 S.C. 208, 210, 648 S.E.2d 605, 605-06 (2007) (citing section 40-11-370 and\r\nrecognizing it as an affirmative defense, noting \"that an entity which does not have\r\na valid license as required by Chapter 40 may not bring an action at law or in\r\nequity to enforce the provisions of a contract\").\r\n\r\nIn this case, the arbitrator erred in failing to grant Petitioners' motion to dismiss\r\nbased upon the affirmative defense of section 40-11-370. Despite such error,\r\nRespondent seeks refuge in the narrow standard of manifest disregard. Indeed,\r\nmanifest disregard is an exacting standard, but it is not insurmountable. See, e.g.,\r\nN.Y. Tel. Co. v. Commc'ns Workers of Am. Local 1100, 256 F.3d 89 (2nd Cir.\r\n2001) (affirming district court's vacating of arbitration award where arbitrator\r\nmanifestly disregarded the law by explicitly rejecting precedent of the Second\r\nCircuit and relying on opinions outside of the Circuit); Montes v. Shearson Lehman\r\nBros., Inc., 128 F.3d 1456 (11th Cir. 1997) (finding lack of indication that\r\narbitrators rejected party's express urging to disregard the law necessitated\r\nreversing affirmance of the arbitration award); Spear, Leeds & Kellogg v. Bullseye\r\nSec., Inc., 291 A.D.2d 255 (N.Y. App. Div. 2002) (finding that because individual\r\nclaimants, as a matter of law, cannot assert a cause of action to recover for\r\nwrongdoing done to a corporation, the rendering of award based on such a claim\r\nwas properly vacated as manifest disregard of the law); Wichinksy v. Mosa, 847\r\nP.2d 727 (Nev. 1993) (finding arbitrator demonstrated a manifest disregard of the\r\nlaw by awarding punitive damages in the absence of clear and convincing evidence\r\nof fraud, oppression or malice).\r\n\r\nHere, we hold \"the governing law ignored by the arbitrator [is] well defined,\r\nexplicit, and clearly applicable[,]\" and consequently, the manifest disregard\r\nstandard has been met. See Gissel, 382 S.C. at 241, 676 S.E.2d at 323. Therefore,\r\nwe reverse the court of appeals and direct that judgment be entered for Petitioners.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Having resolved the case on the basis of the section 40-11-370 challenge, we do\r\nnot reach the remaining issue. Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (appellate court need not address\r\nremaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting\r\nin a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I am appalled that respondent, licensed only for\r\nconstruction projects up to $100,000, bid upon this project that far exceeded\r\nthe scope of his license. Unlike the majority, however, I cannot say that the\r\narbitrator manifestly disregarded the law. Gissel v. Hart, 382 S.C. 235, 676\r\nS.E.2d 320 (2009); Lauro v. Visnapuu, 351 S.C. 507, 570 S.E.2d 551 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2002) (Hearn, J., concurring). I therefore reluctantly dissent and would\r\naffirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nHeretofore we have not had occasion to define the term \"valid license\" as\r\nused in S.C. Code Ann. § 40-11-370(C) (Supp. 2012). While I may very well\r\nagree with the majority that respondent did not possess a valid license within\r\nthe meaning of that statute, the question, in my view, is not whether the\r\nstatutory term is clear and unambiguous, but whether the arbitrator\r\nknowingly refused to give the term its well-defined and explicit meaning.\r\nGissel, supra. In my opinion, this strict standard is not met here either by\r\nreference to an opinion analyzing the term in a similar statute4 or to a\r\ndecision that mentioned but did not enforce the statute,5 especially since in\r\nboth cases the contractor had no license while respondent here admittedly\r\npossesses a Group II license. Under our very limited scope of review, I\r\nwould uphold the arbitrator's award.\r\nSince I would uphold the decision of the Court of Appeals on the \"manifest\r\ndisregard\" issue, I reach the question whether the Court of Appeals erred in\r\naffirming the attorney's fee award. While I question that court's application\r\nof the mechanic's lien statute, the arbitrator's attorney's fee award rested on\r\nmultiple grounds, not all of which have been challenged. I would therefore\r\naffirm the award of attorney's fee in result only.\r\nFor the reasons given above, I reluctantly dissent and would affirm the result\r\nreached by the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4   Duckworth v.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a\r\npublic reprimand. Respondent has also resigned his position and has agreed never\r\nto seek nor accept a judicial office in South Carolina without the express written\r\npermission of this Court after written notice to ODC. We accept the agreement\r\nand publicly reprimand respondent, the most severe sanction we are able to impose\r\nunder these circumstances.\r\n\n                                        Facts\r\n\r\n                                      Matter I\r\n\r\nA defendant appeared before respondent in a criminal matter. After initially\r\nsetting a higher bond, respondent set the defendant's bond at $10.00. Thereafter,\r\nrespondent posted bond on the defendant's behalf out of respondent's own personal\r\nfunds and signed the bond form as both Judge and Surety. Respondent self-\r\nreported this matter.                 Matter II\r\n\r\nRespondent arraigned a defendant on the felony charge of Malicious Injury to\r\nProperty. Subsequently, at the request of the parties, respondent signed a paper\r\nstating that the victim agreed to drop all charges against the defendant based upon\r\npayment of $1,178.80. The defendant was later indicted on the matter and was\r\narrested when he failed to appear. Respondent submits he felt that he signed the\r\npaper as a witness to the parties' exchange for restitution but now recognizes that\r\nhe should not have signed the paper as it could give the defendant the impression\r\nthat the matter was dismissed by him. Matter III\r\n\r\nA defendant was charged with four counts of unlawful use of a telephone. The\r\nmatter was continued at the request of the prosecuting officer. When the jail\r\nmistakenly transported the defendant, respondent allowed the prisoner to plead\r\nguilty without the arresting officer and victim being present or being notified of the\r\nproceeding. In mitigation, respondent submits the defendant served the maximum\r\namount of jail time for the crime.   Matter IV\r\nA defendant who was ticketed for an expired tag failed to appear for court and was\r\ntried in her absence by another judge in April 2010. The defendant was found\r\nguilty, a fine was imposed, and the defendant's driver's license was suspended.\r\n\r\nIn June 2010, a clerk changed the case history from guilty to not guilty, and the\r\ndisposition code for the matter was changed to respondent's disposition code to\r\nreflect that respondent was the trial judge. The clerk reports she changed the\r\ndisposition at respondent's direction.\r\n\nA municipal court judge reports that he spoke with respondent at the time the\r\ndefendant received the ticket. The municipal court judge reported that he called\r\nrespondent when the defendant provided proof that she had renewed her tags and\r\nasked respondent to dismiss the matter.\r\n\r\nRespondent does not remember the matter, but submits in mitigation that tickets\r\nfor expired tags are dismissed as a matter of course when the defendant provides\r\nproof that the tags have been renewed. While acknowledging it is improper to\r\nchange another judge's order, respondent submits that any actions he took were\r\nconsistent with how other defendants with the same charge are treated.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter V\r\n\r\nRespondent presided over a matter where the complainant sought a restraining\r\norder against a police officer. In announcing his decision, respondent commented\r\non the fact that granting a restraining order could have a serious effect on the\r\nofficer's career and incorrectly applied a reasonable doubt standard in not granting\r\nthe complainant a restraining order. While there is no indication respondent knew\r\nthe officer in question, respondent acknowledges it was improper to apply a\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt standard.     Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR: Canon 1 (judge shall uphold\r\nintegrity and independence of judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in\r\nestablishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall\r\npersonally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the\r\njudiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and\r\nappearance of impropriety in all of judge's activities); Canon 2A (judge shall\r\nrespect and comply with the law); Canon 3B(2) (judge shall be faithful to the law);\r\nand Canon 3B(7) (judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a\r\nproceeding the right to be heard according to law).\r\n\r\nRespondent admits he has also violated the following provisions of the Rules for\r\nJudicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be\r\nground for discipline for judge to violate Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule\r\n\n7(a)(4) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to persistently perform judicial\r\nduties in an incompetent or neglectful manner).\r\n\r\n                                     Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand\r\nbecause respondent is no longer a judge and because he has agreed not to hereafter\r\nseek nor accept another judicial position in South Carolina without first obtaining\r\nexpress written permission from this Court after due notice in writing to ODC. As\r\npreviously noted, this is the strongest punishment we can give respondent, given\r\nthe fact that he has already resigned his duties as a judge. See In re Gravely, 321\r\nS.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996) (\"A public reprimand is the most severe sanction\r\nthat can be imposed when the respondent no longer holds judicial office.\")\r\nAccordingly, respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded for his conduct.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27248","title":"Bodman v.

The taxidermist takes\r\nonly your skin.\" Not necessarily so, according to Matthew Bodman. In this\r\naction brought in our original jurisdiction, Bodman alleges that the sheer\r\nnumber of exemptions to and caps on this State's sales and use tax removes\r\nany rational relationship they have to the underlying tax itself. He therefore\r\n\nrequests that we strike down all of the exemptions and caps as being\r\nunconstitutional, leaving behind only the imposition of the tax. In particular,\r\nhe contends that the entire exemption and cap scheme violates our State\r\nconstitution's equal protection guarantee and prohibition against special\r\nlegislation. We disagree.\r\n\r\n              FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       The facts of this case are simple and not in dispute. Bodman is a\r\nresident and taxpayer of Richland County, South Carolina. He is also the\r\nproud father of two young children, who presently are not yet old enough to\r\nattend public school. Ostensibly, he is also a consumer of goods subject to\r\nthis State's sales and use tax.\r\n\r\n      A state-wide tax totaling six percent is imposed on the sale of all\r\npersonal property at retail, the proceeds of which are used to support\r\neducation. The first part of this tax is a five percent tax imposed by Section\r\n12-36-910 of the South Carolina Code (2000 & Supp. 2011). This five\r\npercent tax is divided up into a four percent levy and a one percent levy. Id. §\r\n12-36-2620 (2000 & Supp. 2011). The four percent portion of the tax is\r\ncredited to the public school building fund. Id. § 12-36-2620(1); id. § 59-21-\r\n1010 (2004). As to the remaining one percent, the funds it raises are\r\ndeposited into the South Carolina Education Improvement Act of 1984 Fund\r\n\"as a fund separate and distinct from the general fund of the State.\" Id. § 12-\r\n36-2620(2); id. § 59-21-1010(B).\r\n\r\n       On top of this five percent tax, Section 12-36-1110 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2011) levies an additional one percent sales tax.\r\nRevenues derived from this tax are credited to the Homestead Exemption\r\nFund, id. § 12-36-1120 (Supp. 2011), which is also separate and distinct from\r\nthe general fund, id. § 11-11-155 (2011). Without delving into too much\r\ndetail, this fund provides a revenue stream for school districts in lieu of\r\ncertain property taxes. See id. § 11-11-156 (2011).\r\n\r\n     Over the years, the General Assembly has passed into law a series of\r\nexemptions to and caps on the tax imposed by this general scheme.\r\nCurrently, there are seven caps on the amount of the tax. Id. § 12-36-2110\r\n\n(2000 & Supp. 2011). Additionally, there are seventy-eight exemptions from\r\nthe tax. Id. § 12-36-2120 (Supp. 2011). These exemptions run the gamut\r\nfrom textbooks used in primary and secondary education, id. § 12-36-2120(3)\r\n(2000), to water sold by public utilities, id. § 12-36-2120(12) (Supp. 2011), to\r\nelectricity used to irrigate crops, id. § 12-36-2120(44) (2000), to a certain\r\npercentage of the gross proceeds from the rental or lease of portable toilets,\r\nid. § 12-36-2120(62) (Supp. 2011), and to sweetgrass baskets, id. § 12-36-\r\n2120(64) (Supp. 2011). Recent data show that as a result of these numerous\r\nexemptions, South Carolina now exempts more sales taxes than it collects.\r\n\r\n       Spurred on by recent budget concerns and this declining source of\r\nrevenue for education, Bodman sought our original jurisdiction pursuant to\r\nRule 245, SCACR, to challenge the sales tax exemption and cap scheme. He\r\nasks that we strike down the exemptions and caps in toto because the number\r\nof them has grown to the point where they no longer bear a rational\r\nrelationship to the purpose of imposing the tax in the first place. He therefore\r\nargues that sections 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120 violate the equal protection\r\nclause and the prohibition against special legislation found in our State's\r\nconstitution. We accepted this suit in our original jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      We are reluctant to declare a statute unconstitutional. In re Treatment\r\nand Care of Luckbaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 134, 568 S.E.2d 338, 334 (2002).\r\nHence, we will make every presumption in favor of finding it constitutional.\r\nId. Moreover, if possible, we must construe a statute so that it is valid. State\r\nv. Neuman, 384 S.C. 395, 402, 683 S.E.2d 268, 271 (2009). The party\r\nchallenging the statute bears the heavy burden of proving that \"its repugnance\r\nto the constitution is clear and beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Luckabaugh, 351\r\nS.C. at 134-35, 568 S.E.2d at 344.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n   I.    Does Bodman have standing to bring this claim?\r\n\n    II.    Do sections 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120 violate the equal protection\r\n           clause of the South Carolina Constitution?\r\n\r\n    III.   Do sections 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120 violate the prohibition\r\n           against special legislation where a general law can be made\r\n           applicable?        LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n    I.     STANDING\r\n\r\n      As a threshold matter, the State and the Department of Revenue\r\n(collectively, Defendants) assert that Bodman does not have standing to bring\r\nthis action because he has not suffered an individualized injury. Bodman\r\ncounters that he has sufficient standing as a taxpayer and under the public\r\nimportance exception to the individualized injury requirement.\r\n\r\n       \"Standing to sue is a fundamental requirement in instituting an action.\"\r\nJoytime Distribs. & Amusement Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 639, 528 S.E.2d\r\n647, 649 (1999). Under our current jurisprudence, there are three ways in\r\nwhich a party can acquire this fundamental threshold of standing: (1) by\r\nstatute; (2) through what is called \"constitutional standing\"; and (3) under the\r\npublic importance exception. ATC S., Inc. v. Charleston Cnty., 380 S.C. 191,\r\n195, 669 S.E.2d 337, 339 (2008).\r\n\r\n       Bodman does not claim any statute confers standing upon him. 1 As to\r\nconstitutional standing, one of the core requirements is that the plaintiff\r\nsuffered a \"'concrete and particularized'\" injury. Id. (quoting Lujan v.\r\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). Here, to the extent\r\nBodman has suffered or will suffer any harm as a result of this tax scheme,\r\nthis harm is shared by all taxpayers in the State. In ATC, we unanimously\r\nclosed the door to a litigant asserting standing simply by virtue of his status\r\nas a taxpayer for this reason. There, we explained that \"[t]he injury to ATC .\r\n. . as a taxpayer is common to all property owners in Charleston County.\r\n\r\n1We reject any averment that the fact Bodman is proceeding under the\r\nDeclaratory Judgment Act has any impact on our standing analysis\r\n\nThis feature of commonality defeats the constitutional requirement of a\r\nconcrete and particularized injury.\" Id. at 198, 669 S.E.2d 340-41 (citing\r\nFrothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488 (holding that a taxpayer lacks\r\nstanding when he \"suffers in some indefinite way in common with people\r\ngenerally\")). We reaffirm this principle today and hold that Bodman's status\r\nas a mere taxpayer is insufficient to confer standing upon him.\r\n\r\n       What remains to be determined is whether Bodman can claim standing\r\nunder the public importance exception, a rule which \"has been the subject of\r\nmuch confusion and misapplication.\" Jessica Clancy Crowson & C.W.\r\nChristian Shea, Standing in South Carolina: What is Required and Who Has\r\nIt?, S.C. Law., July 2009, at 19. Generally speaking,\r\n\r\n     a private individual may not invoke the judicial power to\r\n     determine the validity of an executive or legislative act unless the\r\n     private individual can show that, as a result of that action, a direct\r\n     injury has been sustained, or that there is immediate danger a\r\n     direct injury will be sustained.\r\n\r\nJoytime Distribs., 338 S.C. at 639, 528 S.E.2d at 649-50. However, we have\r\nrecognized that \"standing is not inflexible.\" Davis v. Richland Cnty. Council,\r\n372 S.C. 497, 500, 642 S.E.2d 740, 741 (2007). Thus, \"standing may be\r\nconferred upon a party when an issue is of such public importance as to\r\nrequire its resolution for future guidance.\" Id. In recent years, we routinely\r\nhave found standing through this exception. See Sloan v. Dep't of Transp.,\r\n379 S.C. 160, 170-71, 666 S.E.2d 236, 241 (2008); Davis, 372 S.C. at 500,\r\n642 S.E.2d at 741-42; Sloan v.

Charleston\r\nCnty., 333 S.C. 519, 531, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999).\r\n\r\n     We tempered the application of the public importance exception\r\nsomewhat in ATC. In doing so, we reminded the bench and bar that\r\n\"[w]hether an issue of public importance exists necessitates a cautious\r\n\nbalancing of the competing interests presented.\" ATC, 380 S.C. at 198, 669\r\nS.E.2d at 341. To avoid an overzealous use of this exception, we said that\r\n\"[t]he key to the public importance analysis is whether a resolution is needed\r\nfor future guidance. It is this concept of 'future guidance' that gives meaning\r\nto an issue which transcends a purely private matter and rises to the level of\r\npublic importance.\" Id. at 199, 669 S.E.2d at 341. Moreover, the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States recently explained how more limited rules of\r\nstanding are actually beneficial for the judicial process:\r\n\r\n            Few exercises of the judicial power are more likely to\r\n      undermine public confidence in the neutrality and integrity of the\r\n      Judiciary than one which casts the Court in the role of a Council\r\n      of Revision, conferring on itself the power to invalidate laws at\r\n      the behest of anyone who disagrees with them. In an era of\r\n      frequent litigation, class actions, sweeping injunctions with\r\n      prospective effect, and continuing jurisdiction to enforce judicial\r\n      remedies, courts must be more careful to insist on the formal\r\n      rules of standing, not less so. Making the . . . standing inquiry all\r\n      the more necessary are the significant implications of\r\n      constitutional litigation, which can result in rules of wide\r\n      applicability that are beyond Congress' power to change.\r\n\r\nAriz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, 131 S. Ct. 1436, 1449 (2011).\r\n\r\n     However, we need not revisit the requirements for the public\r\nimportance exception today because even if Bodman does have standing\r\nunder it, his claims fail on the merits.\r\n\n   II.   EQUAL PROTECTION\r\n\r\n      Bodman's first challenge is that sections 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120\r\nare unconstitutional because they do not afford equal protection of the laws.\r\nBased on the limited grounds on which Bodman has presented this case to us,\r\nwe disagree.\r\n\r\n       The South Carolina Constitution provides that no \"person shall be\r\ndenied the equal protection of the laws.\" S.C. Const. art. I, § 3. \"The sine qua\r\nnon of an equal protection claim is a showing that similarly situated persons\r\nreceived disparate treatment.\" Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348,\r\n354, 461 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1995); see also Sloan v. Bd. of Physical Therapy\r\nExam'rs, 370 S.C. 453, 481, 636 S.E.2d 598, 613 (2006) (\"A crucial step in\r\nthe analysis of any equal protection issue is the identification of the pertinent\r\nclass . . . .\"). Not all classifications are unconstitutional, however, for \"[t]he\r\nequal protection clause only forbids irrational and unjustified classifications.\"\r\nLuckabaugh, 351 S.C. at 147, 568 S.E.2d at 351 (quotation omitted). So long\r\nas the statute \"does not implicate a suspect class or abridge a fundamental\r\nright, the rational basis test is used\" to determine whether the classification\r\nfalls into the prohibited group. Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 359 S.C.\r\n85, 91, 596 S.E.2d 917, 920 (2004). A classification will survive rational\r\nbasis review when it bears a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose\r\nsought to be achieved, members of the class are treated alike under similar\r\ncircumstances, and the classification rests on a rational basis. Id.\r\n\r\n       We give great deference to the General Assembly's decision to create a\r\nclassification. Davis v. Cnty. of Greenville, 313 S.C. 459, 465, 443 S.E.2d\r\n383, 386. Consequently, those who challenge the validity of one under\r\nrational basis review must \"negate every conceivable basis which might\r\nsupport it.\" Lee v. S.C. Dep't of Natural Res., 339 S.C. 463, 470 n.4, 530\r\nS.E.2d 112, 115 n.4 (2000). Furthermore, \"it is entirely irrelevant for\r\nconstitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged\r\ndistinction actually motivated the legislature.\" Id. The classification also\r\ndoes not need to completely achieve its purpose to withstand constitutional\r\nscrutiny. Id. Moreover, \"[t]he fact that the classification may result in some\r\n\ninequity does not render it unconstitutional.\" Davis, 313 S.C. at 465, 443\r\nS.E.2d at 386.\r\n\r\n        Accordingly, our entire equal protection inquiry revolves around\r\ninterplay between the specific classification created and the purported basis\r\nfor it, with a challenger coming under rational basis review facing a steep hill\r\nto climb. As illustrated above, sections 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120 do not\r\ncreate a single classification each 2; they create eighty-five between them\r\ncovering a wide range of commercial activity from the leasing of portable\r\ntoilets to the sale of textbooks for primary and secondary education. Thus,\r\nwe are unable to examine the scheme as a whole. Instead, consistent with the\r\nprinciples outlined above, we must determine whether each one of them is\r\nsupported by any rational basis.\r\n\r\n       However, Bodman has prevented us from doing so. The argument he\r\nadvances instead is that the sheer number of exemptions and caps in sections\r\n12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120 has rendered the statutes arbitrary and thus\r\nunconstitutional. Moreover, he points to the wide range of transactions\r\nwhich fall under these statutes as evidence of a lack of a \"cohesive scheme,\"\r\nwhich accordingly makes the entire group arbitrary and presumably lacking\r\nin a rational basis. Yet, in no uncertain terms he argues that the scheme must\r\nstand or fall as a whole based solely on the number of \"patchwork\"\r\nexclusions and caps. He even went so far as to explicitly decline the\r\nDefendants' invitation to examine whether individual exemptions and caps\r\nare supported by a rational basis.3\r\n\r\n     We rejected this very argument in Ed Robinson Laundry & Dry\r\nCleaning, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Revenue, 356 S.C. 120, 588\r\nS.E.2d 97 (2003). There, we considered an identical challenge to the same\r\n\r\n2 We assume arguendo that each cap and exemption would be a classification\r\nfor equal protection purposes. Additionally, we assume arguendo that\r\nBodman has been subjected to disparate treatment as a result of these\r\nclassifications.\r\n3 In his reply brief, he writes, \"the Court cannot make a determination as to\r\nthe 'adequacy, fairness, and sufficiency' of the various exemptions, but must\r\nlook at the exemption scheme as a whole.\"\r\n\nstatutory scheme, where Ed Robinson Laundry contended that the number of\r\nexemptions alone rendered section 12-36-2120 arbitrary and therefore\r\nunconstitutional. Id. at 125-26, 588 S.E.2d at 100. We noted that while the\r\nexemptions may be arbitrary in the political or economic sense of the word,\r\nthat does not mean they are arbitrary in the constitutional sense. Id. at 126,\r\n588 S.E.2d at 100. We accordingly held \"Robinson's argument that '[t]he\r\nsheer number of exemptions demonstrates the exemptions are arbitrary' is\r\nwithout merit. We are concerned not with size or volume but with content.\"\r\nId. Because Bodman's challenge, like Ed Robinson Laundry's, deals only\r\nwith size and volume and not content, it must fail.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, we reject Bodman's contention that we should not be\r\nbound by this decision4 and hold that it is in accord with our constitutional\r\nprinciples. Bodman bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat the classifications created are not supported by any rational basis, not just\r\nthat the scheme as a whole is arbitrary. Indeed, we recently noted that\r\n\"[w]ere we to examine the rationality of a law irrespective of any\r\nclassification it creates, we would impermissibly step from our position as the\r\narbiter of a statute's constitutionality and into the seats of the General\r\nAssembly.\" Cabiness v. Town of James Island, 393 S.C. 176, 191, 712 S.E.2d\r\n416, 424 (2011). Permitting him to attack these statutes on equal protection\r\ngrounds without any consideration of the classifications or their relationship\r\nto their putative legislative goal therefore would fundamentally alter the core\r\nof our analysis, which is a step we refuse to take. Bodman's view would even\r\nremove our presumption of constitutionality by employing a form of \"guilt by\r\nassociation,\" where potentially valid caps and exemptions are struck down\r\nfor violating the equal protection clause simply because they happen to be in\r\na larger scheme that may include invalid parts (but we do not know for sure).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 He argues both that stare decisis should not bar our reconsideration of this\r\nissue and, regardless, that Ed Robinson Laundry is distinguishable from the\r\ncase at hand because there were fewer exemptions in the statute when that\r\ncase was decided. At the time, section 12-36-2120 contained sixty-one\r\nexemptions. Ed Robinson Laundry, 356 S.C. at 125 n.2, 588 S.E.2d at 100\r\nn.2.\r\n\nWe cannot sanction a rule which so readily vitiates the high burden of proof a\r\nchallenger must meet in these cases. 5\r\n\r\n     By expressly declining to offer proof as to the basis underlying any of\r\nthe classifications created by sections 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120, the\r\nmanner in which Bodman has presented this case for our review precludes us\r\nfrom determining whether the exemptions and caps violate equal protection.\r\nBodman therefore has not met his burden of proof.\r\n\r\n    III. SPECIAL LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n      Next, Bodman argues sections 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120 violate our\r\nconstitution's prohibition against special legislation. Due to our conclusion\r\nabove, this issue need not detain us long.\r\n\r\n       Our constitution prohibits the enactment of special laws where a\r\ngeneral law can be made applicable. S.C. Const. art. III, § 34, cl. IX. \"When\r\na statute is challenged on the ground that it is special legislation, the first step\r\nis to identify the class of persons to whom the legislation applies.\" Cabiness,\r\n393 S.C. at 189, 712 S.E.2d at 423. Next, we must determine the basis for\r\nthat classification, remembering that \"the mere fact a statute creates a\r\nclassification does not render it unconstitutional special legislation.\" Id.\r\nThus, our special legislation analysis parallels the one we use for equal\r\nprotection. Id.\r\n\r\n      As with his equal protection challenge, Bodman's contention that\r\nsections 12-36-2110 and 12-36-2120 constitute special legislation rests solely\r\non the fact that there are so many caps and exemptions that they no longer\r\nbear a rational relationship to the purpose of the tax. Once again, we stated in\r\nEd Robinson Laundry that \"[w]e are concerned not with size or volume but\r\nwith content.\" 356 S.C. at 126, 588 S.E.2d at 100. Because Bodman\r\n\r\n5This disposes of Bodman's reliance on People v. Abrahams, 353 N.E.2d 574\r\n(N.Y. 1976) and Kroger Co. v. O'Hara Township, 392 A.2d 266 (Pa. 1978)\r\nfor the proposition that a statute violates equal protection when it contains too\r\nmany exceptions. Those cases are not consistent with the law of South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\nexpressly insists that we not examine the content of the caps and exemptions,\r\nwe hold he has failed to meet his burden in proving them unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we hold Bodman has not met his burden of\r\nproof and enter judgment in favor of the Defendants. We emphasize that our\r\nholding rests solely on the fact that Bodman's challenge is to the number of\r\ncaps and exemptions and not whether individual ones would withstand\r\nconstitutional scrutiny. Thus, nothing in our opinion today should be\r\nconstrued as precluding a challenge based on the content of individual caps\r\nand exemptions at a later date.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in a\r\nseparate opinion. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I concur in the majority's well-reasoned decision,\r\nbut write separately to emphasize our conclusion that today's result does not\r\nforeclose a future challenge based on the content of individual exemptions\r\nand caps. In my opinion, many of these exemptions and caps could not\r\nwithstand even a minimal level of scrutiny under an equal protection\r\nanalysis. The most egregious violation of equal protection is the sales tax cap\r\nfound in section 12-36-2110(A) of the South Carolina Code. S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 12-36-2110 (A) (2000 & Supp. 2012).6 That section provides a maximum\r\n\r\n6(A) The maximum tax imposed by this chapter is three hundred dollars for\r\neach sale made after June 30, 1984, or lease executed after August 31, 1985,\r\nof each:\r\n\r\n      (1) aircraft, including unassembled aircraft which is to be\r\n      assembled by the purchaser, but not items to be added to the\r\n      unassembled aircraft;\r\n\r\n      (2) motor vehicle;\r\n\r\n      (3) motorcycle;\r\n\r\n      (4) boat;\r\n\r\n      (5) trailer or semitrailer, pulled by a truck tractor, as defined in\r\n      Section 56-3-20, and horse trailers, but not including house\r\n      trailers or campers as defined in Section 56-3-710 or a fire safety\r\n      education trailer;\r\n\r\n      (6) recreational vehicle, including tent campers, travel trailer,\r\n      park model, park trailer, motor home, and fifth wheel; or\r\n\r\n      (7) self-propelled light construction equipment with compatible\r\n      attachments limited to a maximum of one hundred sixty net\r\n      engine horsepower.\r\n\n$300 sales tax cap on all sales and leases of aircrafts, motor vehicles, motor\r\ncycles, boats, certain trailers, and recreational vehicles.\r\n\r\n       To determine whether a statue violates equal protection we utilize a\r\nthree prong test examining (1) whether the law treats \"similarly situated\"\r\nentities differently, and if so, (2) whether the General Assembly has a rational\r\nbasis for that disparate treatment, and (3) whether that disparate treatment\r\nbears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose. See Ed\r\nRobinson Laundry and Dry Cleaning, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 356 S.C.\r\n120, 123–24, 588 S.E.2d 97, 99 (2003). In my opinion, under the exemptions\r\nand caps scheme, retailers who specialize in selling exempted products are\r\ntreated differently from retailers who sell non-exempted products, and this\r\ndisparate treatment extends to manufacturers of exempted and non-exempted\r\nproducts. In my view, this disparate treatment does not bear a rational\r\nrelationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.\r\n\r\n       In 2009, the General Assembly created the South Carolina Taxation\r\nRealignment Commission (TRAC). The General Assembly directed TRAC\r\nto undertake a thorough assessment of the State's current tax structure. In its\r\nDecember 2010 report, TRAC noted that South Carolina adopted its motor\r\nvehicles sales tax cap of $300 in 1984 to compete with a similar cap utilized\r\nin North Carolina. Final Report of the S.C. Taxation Realignment Comm'n,\r\nat 55 (Dec. 2010) (hereinafter TRAC Report).7 The General Assembly sought\r\nto appease automobile dealers, particularly in border counties, who\r\ncomplained of lost sales to North Carolina car dealers. Id. While originally\r\nintended to place South Carolina on competitive footing with North Carolina,\r\n\r\n\r\nthe sales tax cap no longer serves this purpose because North Carolina has\r\nmoved away from a flat, across the board tax cap on motor vehicles. Id. at\r\n55–58. Indeed, TRAC noted the obsolete nature of the cap, concluding,\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-36-2110 (A) (2000 & Supp. 2012).\r\n7 South Carolina Taxation Realignment Commission,\r\nwww.scstatehouse.gov/citizensinterestpage/TRAC/TRAC.html (last visited\r\nApr. 11, 2013).\r\n\n\"South Carolina's $300 maximum sales tax cap on motor vehicle purchases is\r\ntruly unique among the 50 states. The cap, entirely appropriate and necessary\r\nin 1984, 26 years later, represents one of the most regressive aspects of the\r\nState's entire sales and use tax code today.\" 8 Id. at 73.\r\n\r\n       From my perspective, while South Carolina's sales tax cap for motor\r\nvehicles had a rational basis connected to a legitimate governmental purpose\r\nin 1984, in 2012, it has outlived the intended purpose of making South\r\nCarolina competitive with neighboring states with regard to the motor vehicle\r\nmarket. Moreover, section 12-36-2110's regressive nature is clearly evident\r\nin its application to consumers who purchase old or debilitated motor\r\nvehicles and those consumers with the financial means to afford modern\r\nluxury motor vehicles and private aircraft. Thus, in my view, section 12-36-\r\n2110(A) of the South Carolina Code represents an arbitrary and capricious\r\nexception to the sales tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      It is likely that the same can be said for many of the other exemptions\r\nor caps when viewed on an individual basis. However, the nature of\r\nBodman's argument prevents this Court from exercising such a review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8   TRAC explained:\r\n       As case in point, a resident purchasing a $6,000 car pays an\r\n       effective sale tax rate of 5 percent—a tax rate that is 10 times\r\n       HIGHER than a resident buying a car that costs $56,000, whose\r\n       effective tax rate in South Carolina is just 0.54 percent—a tax\r\n       rate 10 times less on a car that costs 10 times more. That is the\r\n       definition of a regressive tax. TRAC therefore recommends\r\n       repeal of South Carolina's outdated and regressive sales tax cap\r\n       on cars.\r\n\r\nTRAC Report, supra, at 73 (emphasis in original).\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in the judgment for the defendants, but\r\nwrite separately because I would decide the case on the ground that Bodman\r\nlacks standing. Bodman asserts that both taxpayer and “public importance”\r\nstanding entitle him to maintain this declaratory judgment action challenging\r\nthe constitutionality of certain tax statutes. While we permit generalized\r\ntaxpayer standing when an individual seeks equitable relief, e.g., Myers v.\r\nPatterson, 315 S.C. 248, 433 S.E.2d 841 (1993), Bodman does not seek an\r\ninjunction but rather requests we strike down numerous statutory provisions.\r\nAccordingly, he lacks taxpayer standing. ATC S., Inc., v. Charleston Cty.,\r\n380 S.C. 195, 669 S.E.2d 337 (2008).\r\n\r\nBodman also asserts standing under our state-created “public importance”\r\nexception. In my opinion, this narrow exception to standing cannot be\r\ninvoked by a taxpayer, challenging taxing statutes, who cannot meet the\r\ntaxpayer standing threshold. “Public importance” standing should be\r\ninvoked only where the challenge cannot be otherwise raised, and should not\r\nbe used to evade the application of other well-established standards. Cf.\r\nSloan v. Dep’t of Transp., 379 S.C. 160, 666 S.E.2d 236 (2008) (Pleicones,\r\nJ., dissenting); Sloan v.

S.C. Code Ann. § 12-36-\r\n920(A) (Supp. 2012). That seven percent tax is composed of several components,\r\nincluding a two percent \"local accommodations tax\" (A-Tax), which is remitted to\r\nthe counties and municipalities where it was collected.1 S.C. Code Ann. § 12-36-\r\n2630(3). Counties and municipalities receiving A-Tax revenues must expend those\r\nfunds in accordance with the statutory provisions governing the allocation of A-\r\nTax revenues (the Act). See S.C. Code Ann. § 6-4-5 to -35 (Supp. 2012)\r\n(providing procedure for expending A-Tax funds).\r\n\r\nFor purposes of disposing of this case, we need only examine briefly section 6-4-\r\n10(4), which provides for the expenditure of A-Tax funds generally referred to as\r\n\"65% Funds.\" These funds are allocated for \"tourism-related expenditures.\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 6-4-10(4)(a) and (b). It is statutory provisions relating to these 65%\r\nFunds that are the subject of this appeal.\r\n\r\nThe Act defines tourism-related expenditures to include:\r\n\r\n      The criminal justice system, law enforcement, fire protection, solid\r\n      waste collection, and health facilities when required to serve tourists\r\n      and tourist facilities. This is based on the estimated percentage of\r\n      costs directly attributed to tourists.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 6-4-10(4)(b)(4).\r\n\r\nSubsection (4)(b) further explicitly provides that municipalities with \"a high\r\nconcentration of tourism activity\" may use the 65% Funds \"to provide additional\r\ncounty and municipal services, including, but not limited to, law enforcement,\r\ntraffic control, public facilities . . . .\" However, subsection (4)(b) also provides:\r\n\r\n      The funds must not be used as an additional source of revenue to\r\n      provide services normally provided by the county or municipality but\r\n\r\n1The other components are as follows: four percent is credited to the state public\r\nschool building fund and the remaining one percent is credited to the South\r\nCarolina Education Improvement Act of 1984 Fund.

Code Ann. § 6-4-10(4)(b) (emphasis added). The Act makes clear that \"[i]n\r\nthe expenditure of these [65%] funds, counties and municipalities are required to\r\npromote tourism . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 6-4-10(4)(d).\r\n\r\nThe legislature specifically provided for a local advisory committee and, more\r\nimportantly for purposes of this appeal, a statewide oversight body—the Tourism\r\nExpenditure Review Committee (TERC)—to ensure counties and municipalities\r\ncomply with the basic requirements set forth in the Act. S.C. Code Ann. § 6-4-35.\r\nCounties and municipalities are required to submit annual reports, which TERC\r\nreviews to determine if the expenditures comply with the Act. S.C. Code Ann. §§\r\n6-4-25(D); -35(B)(1)(a). In its annual report, the county or municipality must\r\nsubmit a \"list of how funds from the accommodations tax are spent\" and \"must\r\ninclude funds received and dispersed [sic] during the previous fiscal year.\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 6-4-25(D)(3).\r\n\r\nThe legislature granted TERC the authority to challenge a local government's\r\nexpenditure of 65% Funds. TERC must notify the county or municipality, which\r\nmay provide \"further supporting information\" regarding its expenditure for TERC\r\nto consider in its compliance determination. S.C. Code Ann. § 6-4-35(B)(1)(a).\r\nSignificantly, for TERC to pursue a challenge, the Act further provides:\r\n\r\n      If [TERC] finds an expenditure to be in noncompliance, it shall certify\r\n      the noncompliance to the State Treasurer, who shall withhold the\r\n      amount of the expenditure found in noncompliance from subsequent\r\n      distributions in accommodations tax revenue otherwise due the\r\n      municipality or county. An appeal from an action of [TERC] under\r\n      this subitem lies with the Administrative Law Judge Division.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 6-4-35(B)(1) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n                                        II.\r\n\r\nOver the years, the City of Myrtle Beach and TERC have occasionally disputed the\r\nmeaning of various provisions of section 6-4-10(4)(b). However, no particular\r\n\nexpenditure or allocation is at issue here, nor are any A-Tax revenues being held\r\nby the State Treasurer in connection with this appeal. While TERC has indicated\r\nthat it may certify as noncompliant the City's expenditures of 65% Funds, it has not\r\ndone so here. To resolve this difference of opinion, the City first filed an action in\r\nthe Administrative Law Court, which granted TERC's motion to dismiss the matter\r\nfor lack of jurisdiction. TERC then filed the current action in circuit court as a\r\ndeclaratory judgment action seeking to have section 6-4-10(4) construed. The City\r\ndid not challenge the jurisdiction of the circuit court. The circuit court adopted the\r\nCity's view of section 6-4-10(4), from which TERC has appealed. We dismiss the\r\nappeal.                                    III.\r\n\r\nAlthough neither party has raised the question, we first consider whether this Court\r\nhas subject matter jurisdiction over this case. Even where the parties do not raise\r\nsuch a challenge, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is properly raised for the\r\nfirst time on appeal by the appellate court \"since the parties cannot by consent or\r\nagreement confer jurisdiction on the court to render a declaratory judgment in the\r\nabsence of an actual justiciable controversy.\" Power v.

Moreover, I would reach the merits and affirm.\r\nIn South Carolina, \"subject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and\r\ndetermine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question\r\nbelong.\" Storm M.H. ex rel. McSwain v. Charleston Cty. Bd. of Trustees, 400\r\nS.C. 478, 735 S.E.2d 492 (2012) citing Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 538\r\nS.E.2d 245 (2000). As set forth below, I find the circuit court has subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment suit.\r\nUnder South Carolina's declaratory judgment act:\r\n            Any person interested under a deed, will, written contract\r\n            or other writings constituting a contract or whose rights,\r\n            status or other legal relations are affected by a statute,\r\n            municipal ordinance, contract or franchise may have\r\n            determined any question of construction or validity arising\r\n            under the instrument, statute, ordinance, contract or\r\n            franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other\r\n            legal relations thereunder.\r\n            S.C. Code Ann. § 15-53-30 (2005).\r\nFurther, § 15-53-20 (2005) of the act provides:\r\n            Courts of record within their respective jurisdictions shall\r\n            have power to declare rights, status and other legal relations\r\n            whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. No\r\n            action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the\r\n            ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for.\r\n            The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in\r\n            form and effect. Such declarations shall have the force and\r\n            effect of a final judgment or decree.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear this declaratory\r\njudgment action and to construe the statute. While it is true that the\r\n\nenforcement mechanism is in the Administrative Law Judge Division and\r\ntherefore the circuit could have exercised its discretion and declined to hear\r\nthis matter,3 the existence of this remedy does not deprive the circuit court of\r\njurisdiction nor does it negate the existence of a justiciable controversy. I\r\ntherefore dissent from the majority's sua sponte conclusion that the circuit\r\ncourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action.\r\nFurther, I would affirm the circuit court's construction of S.C. Code Ann. § 6-\r\n4-10(4) (2004).\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n See e.g. Bank of Augusta v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n                         FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n       On July 26, 2007, the Beaufort County Grand Jury indicted Appellant for\r\ncriminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree (CSC-First) in violation of\r\nsection 16-3-655 of the South Carolina Code. On July 1, 2010, Appellant and the\r\nState negotiated a plea to Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature\r\n(ABHAN) pursuant to North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970) (Alford plea).\r\nThe negotiated plea included a sentence of ten years' imprisonment suspended\r\nupon the service of five years' probation, and also included two special conditions\r\nprohibiting Appellant from contacting the victim, or her family, and requiring\r\nAppellant to successfully complete sex abuse counseling. According to the terms\r\nof the negotiated plea, Appellant would face lifetime sex offender registration if he\r\nfailed to successfully complete sex abuse counseling.\r\n\r\n      The circuit court explained to Appellant the significance of his Alford plea:\r\n\r\n      The Court: What you are basically doing is you are pleading guilty but\r\n                 you say I'm just doing this to get it over with. I'm not\r\n                 really admitting I did it, but I will go ahead and plead that\r\n                 I did it and suffer the consequences?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Yes, sir. I'm not guilty but I'm pleading to this—\r\n\r\n      The Court: That's what you are doing?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Because I’m three years into this—\r\n\r\n      The Court: If you enter your plea, even if you say it's under Alford,\r\n                 you subject yourself to being sentenced just like you were\r\n                 pleading guilty straight up; do you understand that?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Yes.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\n     The circuit court also explained the sex abuse counseling requirement of\r\nAppellant's probation:\r\n\r\n      The Court:\t Now the other condition that I heard is you've got to\r\n                  complete sex offender counseling. If you don't\r\n                  successfully complete that, you are going to have to\r\n                  register as a sex offender forever. Believe me, that's\r\n                  about worse than going to jail?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: I agree. \n\r\n      ....\n\r\n\r\n      The Court:\t Anyway, if you don't like that sex offender counseling\r\n                  once you start it, you can stop it but there are going to be\r\n                  even worse consequences. Do you understand that?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      The Court: Do you think you can comply with probation if I accept\r\n                 the negotiation?\r\n\r\n      Appellant: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      The circuit court accepted the negotiated plea, and sentenced Appellant\r\nunder the plea's terms. Prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the circuit court\r\nreminded Appellant of the importance of fulfilling the negotiated plea's counseling\r\nrequirement:\r\n\r\n      The Court: You must successfully complete sex abuse counseling. If\r\n                  not completed, you must register as a sex offender. And\r\n                  that's forever. Do you have any questions?\r\n\r\n       Appellant: No, sir.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Appellant initially complied with his probation requirements and began sex\r\nabuse counseling with SouthEastern Assessments (SEA) in July 2010. SEA's sex\r\nabuse counseling methodology called for Appellant to accept responsibility for the\r\nunderlying acts of his conviction while undergoing at least three polygraph\r\n\nexaminations. The Record suggests that Appellant submitted to at least two\r\npolygraph examinations. Appellant failed a polygraph examination on September\r\n15, 2010, and then admitted that he abused the victim in this case, providing details\r\nof the abuse. On October 26, 2010, Appellant informed his probation agent that he\r\nwould not attend a third polygraph examination, although he desired to comply\r\nwith required sex abuse counseling. Appellant claimed his probation required him\r\nto complete sex abuse counseling, but not a polygraph examination, and that he did\r\nnot want to admit guilt to a sex offense because he pled guilty to ABHAN. As a\r\nconsequence, Appellant's probation agent issued him a Probation Citation charging\r\nAppellant with violating a special condition of his probation:\r\n\r\n      Appellant has been instructed by his agent to complete Sex Abuse\r\n      Counseling with [SEA]. [SEA] requested [Appellant], as part of his\r\n      counseling, to complete a 3rd and subsequent lie detector test in order\r\n      to be allowed to attend sex abuse counseling classes. [Appellant] has\r\n      refused to attend any further lie detector test[s] although he has stated\r\n      he is willing to attend counseling classes. [Appellant] has failed to\r\n      follow the advice and instructions of his agent and special condition\r\n      that he successfully complete sex abuse counseling.\r\n\r\n(alterations added).\r\n\r\n       On November 8, 2010, SEA terminated Appellant from the sex abuse\r\ncounseling program due to noncompliance, informing Appellant's probation agent\r\nthat, \"The use of the polygraph is a standard of care as established by the\r\nAssociation for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (ATSA), an international\r\norganization dedicated to the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders.\"\r\n\r\n       Appellant appeared before the circuit court on November 18, 2010,\r\nregarding the alleged probation violation. The circuit court continued Appellant's\r\nprobation and ordered Appellant to successfully complete the required sex abuse\r\ncounseling. However, on January 12, 2011, Appellant received another Probation\r\nCitation alleging that he failed to comply with the sex abuse requirement:\r\n\r\n      Failure to follow the advice and instructions of his agent and the\r\n      continuation order by [the circuit court] on 11/18/2010 by: Not being\r\n      able to attend sex offender counseling, offender will NOT admit his\r\n      guilt, which is a requirement of sex offender counseling. This action\r\n      constitutes a violation of his original agreement.\r\n\n(emphasis in original) (alterations added).\r\n\r\n       On January 28, 2011, Appellant again appeared before the circuit court\r\nregarding his second alleged probation violation. Appellant argued that at his\r\noriginal sentencing, the circuit court did not provide adequate notice that Appellant\r\nwould have to admit guilt as part of his sex abuse counseling. The circuit court\r\nrejected Appellant's assertion:\r\n\r\n      It's clear, from [the] sentencing sheet, condition two of the sentence\r\n      that [Appellant], one, must complete it and he doesn't complete it he's\r\n      got to register. It's an either or proposition and that's my reading of it.\r\n      It's an either or proposition. He hasn't completed it. He's been given\r\n      every opportunity to complete it. I think he was in front of [the circuit\r\n      court] last month . . . . [The circuit court] ordered him to go back and\r\n      he didn't complete it . . . . Because he hasn't successfully completed\r\n      sex abuse counseling, I’m going to order that he now has to register as\r\n      a sex offender . . . . He's had the opportunity to go through sex abuse\r\n      counseling. He has not successfully completed it as ordered by [the\r\n      circuit court] and so therefore, I am ordering that he register as a sex\r\n      offender based on his failure to complete counseling.\r\n\r\n(alterations added).\r\n\r\n       Appellant appealed the circuit court's decision, and this Court certified the\r\ncase for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                 ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n\r\n      Whether the circuit court erred in requiring Appellant to register as a\r\n      sex offender for failing to complete sex abuse counseling when\r\n      Appellant failed to complete sex abuse counseling as a result of his\r\n      refusal to admit guilt, and Appellant was not given prior notice that\r\n      completion of counseling would require such an admission.\r\n\r\n                           STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       The determination to revoke probation is within the discretion of the circuit\r\ncourt. State v. Ellis, 397 S.C. 576, 579, 726 S.E.2d 5, 6 (2012) (citing State v.\r\nWhite, 218 S.C. 130, 135, 61 S.E.2d 754, 756 (1950)). This Court's authority to\r\nreview the findings of a lower court regarding probation revocation and related\r\n\nissues is confined to the correction of errors of law, unless it appears that the action\r\nof the circuit court amounted to a manifest abuse of discretion. Id.\r\n\r\n                                   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       Appellant claims that the circuit court failed to provide adequate notice that\r\na condition of his probation required him to admit guilt. The gravamen of\r\nAppellant's claim is that his Alford plea allowed him to maintain his innocence,\r\nand therefore, he should not have to comply with a probation sanction which\r\nrequires him to accept responsibility for the crime. Alternatively, Appellant argues\r\nthat, at the very least, due process required the circuit court inform Appellant of\r\nthis possibility. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       In Alford, a grand jury indicted the defendant, Henry Alford, for first degree\r\nmurder. Alford, 400 U.S. at 26. Alford directed his attorney to interview several\r\nwitnesses that Alford claimed would confirm his innocence. Id. at 27. However,\r\nthe witnesses did not support Alford's claim, and instead provided statements\r\nstrongly indicating Alford's guilt. Id. Alford's attorney recommended that he\r\nplead guilty, and the prosecutor agreed to accept a guilty plea to second degree\r\nmurder. Id. Alford, of his own volition, pled guilty to the reduced charge. Id.\r\nPrior to acceptance of the plea, the trial court heard sworn testimony from a police\r\nofficer and two witnesses that supported the narrative that shortly before the killing\r\nAlford took his gun from his house, stated his intention to kill the victim, and\r\nreturned home with the declaration that he had carried out the killing. Id. at 28.\r\nAlford testified that he did not commit the murder but pled guilty because he faced\r\na possible death sentence if convicted. Id. at 28–29. The trial court asked Alford\r\nwhether he desired to plead guilty in light of his denial of guilt, and Alford\r\nconfirmed that he did. Id. The trial court then sentenced Alford to thirty years'\r\nimprisonment. Id.\r\n\r\n       Alford later filed a habeas petition, and argued that his guilty plea was the\r\nproduct of fear and coercion, and therefore invalid. Id. A divided panel of the\r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed. Id. at 30. However,\r\nthe United States Supreme Court reversed, and held that the mere fact Alford pled\r\nguilty primarily to limit a possible penalty did not necessarily demonstrate that his\r\nplea was not the product of free and rational choice. Id. at 31. According to the\r\nSupreme Court, the strong factual basis for the plea and Alford's expressed desire\r\nto enter the plea prevented any constitutional deprivation:\r\n\n      Confronted with the choice between a trial for first-degree murder, on\r\n      the one hand, and a plea of guilty to second-degree murder, on the\r\n      other, Alford quite reasonably chose the latter and thereby limited the\r\n      maximum penalty to a 30-year term. When his plea is viewed in light\r\n      of the evidence against him, which substantially negated his claim of\r\n      innocence and which further provided a means by which the judge\r\n      could test whether the plea was being intelligently entered, its validity\r\n      cannot be seriously questioned.\r\n\r\nId. at 38 (citation omitted); see also Gaines v. State, 335 S.C. 376, 380–81, 517\r\nS.E.2d 439, 441–42 (1999) (establishing that the trial court must determine the\r\nvoluntariness of a defendant's Alford plea pursuant to factors outlined in Boykin v.\r\nAlabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969)); Baxley v. State, 255 S.C. 283, 286, 178 S.E.2d\r\n535, 536 (1971) (recognizing the Alford plea's validity).\r\n\r\n       The primary thrust of the Alford decision is that a defendant may voluntarily\r\nand knowingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he is\r\nunwilling or unable to admit he participated in the acts constituting the crime.\r\nUnited States v. Morrow, 914 F.2d 608, 611 (4th Cir. 1990). The Alford plea is, in\r\nessence, a guilty plea and carries with it the same penalties and punishments.1 See,\r\ne.g., Carroll v. Virginia, 701 S.E.2d 414, 420 (Va. 2010) (\"We hold further that\r\nCarroll's failure to receive warning at the time he entered his Alford plea that such\r\na refusal could result in the revocation of his probation is a collateral and not a\r\ndirect consequence of his plea and does not render the revocation improper.\");\r\nPerry v. Virginia, 533 S.E.2d 651, 652–53 (Va. App. 2000) (holding that Alford\r\npleas are treated the same as guilty pleas and thus by freely and intelligently\r\n\r\n1 Thus, courts are generally required to confirm that a factual basis exists for the\r\nAlford plea. See Morrow, 914 F.2d at 611 (holding that trial court has wide\r\ndiscretion in determining this factual basis, and is not required to replicate the trial\r\nthat the prosecutor and defendant entered a plea agreement to avoid); see also\r\nHiggason v. Clark, 984 F.2d 203, 208 (7th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 977\r\n(1993) (\"Whether a choice is informed and reached without inappropriate\r\npressure—that is, whether it is voluntary—depends on the information known and\r\noptions open to the defendant, including what he has learned out of court.\"); United\r\nStates v. Fountain, 777 F.2d 351, 357 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1029\r\n(1986) (\"Turning to the specifics of the present appeal, we must re-emphasize the\r\ndual responsibility of the prosecutor and the judge in establishing a factual basis\r\nfor a guilty plea, and more importantly, the mutually exclusive nature of that\r\nresponsibility.\").\r\n\nentering an Alford plea, the defendant waived his right to appeal the issue of\r\nwhether the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he\r\nwas guilty of the charge).\r\n\r\n      This Court touched on the minimal differences between an Alford plea and a\r\nstandard guilty plea in the punishment context with its decisions in State v. Ray,\r\n310 S.C. 431, 427 S.E.2d 171 (1993) and Zurcher v. Bilton, 379 S.C. 132, 666\r\nS.E.2d 224 (2008).\r\n\r\n       In Ray, this Court held that an Alford plea may provide a valid basis for\r\nimposition of the death penalty. In that case, a grand jury indicted the defendant\r\nfor assault and battery with intent to kill, armed robbery, first degree burglary,\r\ngrand larceny, kidnapping, and murder arising from three different incidents which\r\noccurred during late August and early September 1990. Ray, 310 S.C. at 433, 427\r\nS.E.2d at 172. The defendant sought to mitigate his culpability by claiming to\r\nhave been voluntarily intoxicated during commission of the crimes, and entered an\r\nAlford plea to the kidnapping and murder charges. Id. at 434, 427 S.E.2d at 173.\r\nThe trial court accepted the plea, and imposed a death sentence in the separate\r\nsentencing proceeding. Id.\r\n\r\n       The defendant argued on appeal that the trial court erred in accepting his\r\nguilty plea to capital murder in the absence of an admission of guilt, and that a\r\ndeath sentence should not rest on an Alford plea which does not include an explicit\r\nadmission of guilt. Id. This Court disagreed:\r\n\r\n      In determining the validity of a guilty plea, we are persuaded that the\r\n      paramount concern is whether it was entered freely and voluntarily.\r\n      We discern no prejudice to an accused in a capital punishment case\r\n      who seeks to plead guilty without an explicit admission of guilt if\r\n      such a plea would be in his best interests, and if freely and voluntarily\r\n      made. In the present case, appellant does not claim innocence or\r\n      allege that his guilty plea was involuntary, made under duress, or that\r\n      the trial judge committed a constitutional violation. Therefore, we\r\n      conclude that an Alford plea may form a valid basis for imposition of\r\n      the death penalty.\r\n\r\nId. at 435, 427 S.E.2d at 173.\r\n\n       In Zurcher, this Court held that a defendant's Alford plea collaterally estops\r\nthat defendant from litigating a civil claim based on the same facts as the criminal\r\nconviction, stating:\r\n\r\n      We find no legal or practical justification for excluding guilty pleas\r\n      from the ambit of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Although the\r\n      defendant who enters a guilty plea has chosen a legal strategy which\r\n      avoids a trial while the defendant who is adjudicated guilty has opted\r\n      to take his chances at a contested trial, both are means to the same\r\n      legal end: the imposition of the punishment prescribed by law. . . . An\r\n      Alford plea is not distinguishable from a standard guilty plea in this\r\n      regard. An Alford plea—a guilty plea accompanied by an assertion of\r\n      innocence—was held to be a constitutional admission of guilt . . . .\r\n      The Alford court reasoned that so long as a factual basis exists for a\r\n      plea, the Constitution does not bar sentencing a defendant who makes\r\n      a calculated choice to accept a beneficial plea arrangement rather than\r\n      face overwhelming evidence of guilt. Under this same reasoning, we\r\n      find that the defendant must likewise accept the collateral\r\n      consequences of that decision. Therefore, we hold that the entry of an\r\n      Alford plea at a criminal proceeding has the same preclusive effect as\r\n      a standard guilty plea.\r\n\r\nId. at 136–37, 666 S.E.2d at 226–27.\r\n\r\n       This Court's decisions in Ray and Zurcher clearly establish that in South\r\nCarolina there is no significant distinction between a standard guilty plea and an\r\nAlford plea. The Alford plea may nevertheless offer advantages to both the state\r\nand the defendant by facilitating a more efficient trial, providing the defendant a\r\nchoice that benefits her interests, or obviating a humiliating public admission of\r\nguilt. See Stephanos Bibas, Harmonizing Substantive-Criminal Law Values and\r\nCriminal Procedure, 88 Cornell L. Rev. 1361, 1373–74 (2003). However, under\r\nSouth Carolina law, the Alford plea does not create a special category of defendant\r\nexempt from the punishment applicable to her conviction. Thus, circuit courts are\r\nunder no duty to provide notice to Alford defendants any differently than the notice\r\nprovided to defendants entering a standard guilty plea, or those defendants\r\nadjudicated guilty. As the circuit court noted in the instant case, \"If you enter your\r\n\nplea, even if you say it's under Alford, you subject yourself to being sentenced just\r\nlike you were pleading guilty straight up.\"2\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, the circuit court ensured that Appellant understood that\r\nhis Alford plea did not mean that he would be sentenced any differently than a\r\nguilty defendant. The Record demonstrates that Appellant maintained his\r\ninnocence, but made a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent Alford plea to conclude\r\nthe proceedings and place the matter behind him. Appellant simply failed to\r\nsatisfy a condition of his probation, and the circuit court properly ordered him to\r\nregister as sex offender for life as would have been appropriate for a defendant\r\nsentenced pursuant to a standard guilty plea.3\r\n\r\n\r\n2 See Colorado v. Birdsong, 958 P.2d 1124, 1127 (Colo. 1998) (\"An Alford plea is\r\na guilty plea. As such, the trial court's obligations to advise the defendant were no\r\ngreater than any other guilty plea. Similarly, the trial court's concession to the\r\ndefendant in accepting the Alford plea did not create an implicit agreement to\r\npermit him to continue on probation in the violation of the clear and reasonable\r\nconditions of that probation.\"); Warren v. Schwarz, 579 N.W.2d 698, 707, 709\r\n(Wis. 1998) (\"Put simply, an Alford plea is not the saving grace for defendants who\r\nwish to maintain their complete innocence. Rather it is a device that defendants\r\nmay call upon to avoid the expense, stress, and embarrassment of trial and to limit\r\none's exposure to punishment . . . . A circuit court's plea colloquy cannot\r\nreasonably be expected to encompass all treatment and conditions of probation\r\nwhich the defendant might need in the future.\"); Idaho v. Jones, 926 P.2d 1318,\r\n1322 (Idaho 1996) (holding that trial court did not deny the defendant due process\r\nby accepting his Alford plea and imposing a probation condition ordering the\r\ndefendant complete sex abuse counseling requiring an admission of guilt).\r\n3 Appellant attempts to place his claim within the ambit of the court of appeals'\r\ndecision in State v. Brown, 349 S.C. 414, 563 S.E.2d 339 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nHowever, Appellant's case is distinguishable from Brown. In that case, the\r\ndefendant pled guilty to two counts of CSC-First, and in addition to his prison\r\nsentence, the circuit court imposed a probation condition that the defendant obtain\r\n\"treatment for problem.\" Id. at 415, 563 S.E.2d at 339. The defendant attended\r\nall sex abuse counseling sessions, but failed to admit guilt, and thus, his probation\r\nofficer issued him a Probation Citation for violating the condition of his probation\r\nrequiring him to obtain \"treatment for problem.\" Id. at 415–16, 563 S.E.2d at 339–\r\n40. At a revocation hearing, the circuit court viewed ordering the defendant to\r\n\"attend and successfully complete,\" as unnecessary, and that ordering mental\r\n\nhealth counseling and directing a defendant to \"follow all advice,\" was sufficient.\r\nId. at 417, 563 S.E.2d at 340. The court of appeals reversed, holding:\r\n\r\n      Here, the probation order unambiguously stated [the defendant] was to\r\n      obtain treatment for his problem; it did not specifically order him to\r\n      complete treatment. Nor did it specify that [the defendant] \"must\r\n      follow all advice\" or anything of that nature. Moreover, even if the\r\n      order were interpreted to mean [the defendant] had to successfully\r\n      complete a treatment program, it did not on its face require him to\r\n      complete a particular sex offender program or admit his guilt in order\r\n      to do so. Finally, the record reflects the order's vague directive to\r\n      \"obtain treatment for problem\" clearly resulted in confusion among\r\n      the complaining probation agent, [the defendant's] mental health\r\n      counselor, the [South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and\r\n      Pardon Services (DPPPS)] administrative hearing officer, and the\r\n      DPPPS prosecuting officer.\r\n\r\nId. at 418, 563 S.E.2d at 341 (emphasis in original) (alterations added). Although\r\nthe court of appeals noted that the circuit court's order did not provide sufficient\r\nwarning that he would have to admit guilt, the court also did not hold that\r\nprobation orders must contain specific language regarding guilt. To the contrary,\r\nthe court of appeals expressed approval of the circuit court's clarification of the\r\norder which mentioned only \"successful completion of the program,\" and found\r\nerror only with the circuit court refusal to allow the defendant the opportunity to\r\ncomply with that interpretation. Id. at 418, 419–20, 563 S.E.2d at 341, 342.\r\n(\"Although we agree with the circuit court's reading of the probation order, we find\r\n[the defendant] should have been afforded an opportunity to comply with that\r\ninterpretation, particularly in light of the fact that he otherwise complied with all\r\naspects of his probationary sentence.\").\r\n\r\n       We agree with the court of appeals' analysis in Brown, and hold that a circuit\r\ncourt's order requiring successful completion of court ordered counseling provides\r\na defendant with sufficient notice of her probation conditions. See, e.g., North\r\nCarolina v. Alston, 534 S.E.2d 666, 669 (N.C. App. 2000) (\"[D]efendant's plea\r\nbargain set forth specified probationary conditions, which he agreed to perform,\r\nincluding \"active\" participation and \"successful\" completion of \"a sexual offender\r\ntreatment program,\" as well as defendant's stipulation that his \"[f]ailure to fully\r\nparticipate and successfully complete\" such program would \"constitute immediate\r\ngrounds for revocation\" of his probation. Defendant not only agreed to such terms\r\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       The foregoing authority and this Court's precedent demonstrate the general\r\nconsensus that an Alford plea is merely a guilty plea with the gloss of judicial grace\r\nallowing a defendant to enter a plea in her best interests. Moreover, the defendant\r\nentering an Alford plea is still treated as guilty for the purposes of punishment, and\r\nsimply put, is not owed anything merely because the State and the court have\r\nagreed to deviate from the standard guilty plea. In the instant case, the circuit court\r\nordered Appellant to successfully complete sex abuse counseling or face lifetime\r\nsex offender registration. It is clear that this treatment would comprise counseling\r\nfor the crime Appellant pled guilty to committing. Additionally, Appellant then\r\nreceived notice that he would need to admit guilt through his participation in the\r\nprogram, and the circuit court re-ordered Appellant to complete the counseling\r\nprior to the probation revocation. However, Appellant failed to comply. See, e.g.,\r\nNew Hampshire v. Woveris, 635 A.2d 454, 455 (N.H. 1993) (\"In this case,\r\nhowever, the defendant is hard-pressed to argue that he was not on notice of these\r\nrequirements, particularly after the first probation revocation hearing, the entirety\r\nof which focused on his failure to participate adequately in the counseling\r\nprograms because of his continued denial of culpability for his actions.\").\r\nTherefore, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court order imposing\r\nlifetime sex offender registration.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduring the oral plea colloquy with the court, but personally, along with his counsel,\r\nsigned the plea transcript incorporating the terms of the plea bargain.\").\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27251","title":"Broom v.

However, because we hold she was not\r\nprejudiced by the error, the grounds for termination were established by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence, and termination is in the child's best interest, we affirm.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       In March of 2007, Mother gave birth to Child.1 Five months later, on\r\nAugust 7, 2007, the Pickens County Department of Social Services received a\r\nreport of neglect from a sheriff's deputy. Three families—six adults and eleven\r\nchildren—resided in Child's home, the trash was overflowing, moldy dishes and\r\nfood were strewn about, Mother and Father admitted to using cocaine, and Child\r\nhad a visibly flat head which Mother explained resulted from her being left in a car\r\nseat for extended periods. Mother also admitted that Child had received her\r\nimmunizations from the health department, but had not seen a doctor since birth.\r\nThe same day, DSS filed a complaint for removal of Child and her older half-sister\r\n(Sister) due to abuse and neglect.2 The following day, Child tested positive for\r\ncocaine.\r\n\r\n       On August 17, 2007, Child and Sister were removed from the home and\r\nplaced in emergency protective custody. A week later, Child was placed with the\r\nBrooms for foster care.3 Following a hearing, the family court found probable\r\ncause for removal of Child based on the positive drug test and Mother's admission\r\nof substance abuse. The court also gave legal custody of Child to DSS and\r\ndirected the appointment of counsel for Mother. At some point thereafter an\r\nattorney was appointed to represent Mother.\r\n\r\n      Following a merits hearing, the family court issued an order finding physical\r\nabuse and neglect and approving treatment plans for the parents. Mother's\r\n\r\n1 Child's father (Father) voluntarily relinquished his parental rights during this\r\naction.\r\n2 Child and Sister are both Mother's biological children, but have different fathers.\r\n3 Sister, who is not at issue in this case, was also placed with the Brooms for foster\r\ncare. In February 2008, Sister was removed from the Brooms' home and placed\r\nwith her paternal grandparents. Then in May 2009, the family court ordered that\r\nSister could be returned to Mother immediately upon the completion of a favorable\r\nhomestudy and approval of the guardian ad litem. However, Sister was not\r\nreturned to Mother until almost a year later, in March of 2010.\r\n\ntreatment plan required her to obtain a safe and stable home, undergo\r\npsychological and substance abuse assessments, complete parenting classes, obtain\r\nand maintain employment for six consecutive months, and undergo random drug\r\ntesting. Additionally, the court approved a visitation plan which provided that\r\nMother was to visit Child at least twice per month.\r\n\r\n        In the ensuing months, Mother failed several drug tests, with her last failed\r\ntest occurring in January of 2008. At a permanency planning hearing that month,\r\nshe admitted that if she was tested at that time, she would be positive for cocaine.\r\nPresumably, she quit using drugs at some point thereafter as she passed all\r\nsubsequent drug tests. At the permanency planning hearing, she also agreed Child\r\nshould remain in DSS custody because her home was still not safe. In the resulting\r\ninitial permanency planning order, the family court declined to return Child to\r\nMother and Father because Mother had tested positive for cocaine and they both\r\nadmitted to continued use.\r\n\r\n       In April of 2008, Mother was arrested on burglary and grand larceny charges\r\nand spent two months in jail. She was released and completed a pretrial\r\nintervention program. One year later, in April of 2009, a second permanency\r\nplanning hearing was held. Mother and the other parties agreed that Child should\r\nnot be returned to her at that time because Child faced an unreasonable risk of\r\nharm from her not having completed the treatment plan. The court ordered that\r\nChild was to remain in DSS custody.\r\n\r\n       On May 15, 2009, the Brooms filed this action for termination of parental\r\nrights and adoption, listing Mother, Father, and DSS as defendants. The complaint\r\nsought termination of Mother's parental rights on the grounds of Mother failing to\r\nvisit Child in excess of six months, Mother failing drug rehabilitation and suffering\r\nfrom the diagnosable condition of drug addiction, Mother surrendering possession\r\nof Child without making adequate arrangements for her care, and Child having\r\nbeen in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.\r\n\r\n      The Brooms filed a motion for temporary relief which, in part, sought the\r\nappointment of counsel for Mother and Father. In an order entered June 30, 2009,\r\nthe Honorable Kinard Johnson found they were not entitled to court-appointed\r\ncounsel because the action was not brought by DSS. In a later hearing before the\r\nHonorable Alex Kinlaw, Mother objected to proceeding without counsel, and\r\nwhile the court noted that objection in its subsequent order, it did not make any\r\nfindings or rulings relevant thereto.\r\n\n       In October of 2009, Mother married. In November 2010, she had a third\r\nchild, fathered by her husband. Mother ceased working outside the home and\r\ndevoted her time to caring for her third child and Sister.\r\n\r\n       A final hearing was scheduled for August 11, 2010, but Mother retained\r\nSouth Carolina Legal Services to represent her one week prior to the hearing. Her\r\nnew counsel moved for a continuance of the hearing in order to prepare, and the\r\nmotion was granted. While several additional continuances were granted in the\r\ncase, none were requested by Mother.\r\n\r\n       On November 1, 2011, a final hearing, at which Mother was represented by\r\ncounsel, was held on the Brooms' TPR action.4 Christy Harris, the DSS\r\ncaseworker assigned to Child, testified about the visitation between Mother and\r\nChild, stating Child often cried during the visitation and did not identify Mother as\r\nher parent. She also presented a visitation log which showed that Mother typically\r\nvisited Child for one hour once per month. Mother only exercised her minimum,\r\ntwice per month visitation in two of the fifty months Child had been in foster care.\r\nShe did not visit Child for eight months from December 21, 2007, to August 30,\r\n2008. She also failed to visit Child in eleven other months.5 In short, Mother\r\nexercised only thirty-four of the minimum one hundred visits she was permitted to\r\nmake. She explained her failure to visit more often as arising from difficulties\r\nscheduling visits with DSS and the Brooms and the cancellation of visits by the\r\nBrooms. Harris acknowledged that her log did not reflect when visitation was\r\nrequested but was unable to be scheduled. She also acknowledged there were\r\ntimes when Mother requested visitation but she or the Brooms were not available.\r\n\r\n        Harris testified that for two and a half years after the April 2, 2009\r\npermanency planning hearing, DSS did not request another hearing despite the\r\nfamily court stating Mother would be ready for the return of Child by October of\r\n2009. While DSS policy apparently—and remarkably—does not require the\r\nautomatic scheduling of a hearing when a parent completes a treatment plan, Harris\r\nasked a DSS attorney to set a hearing for the case but it was never done. She also\r\ntestified Mother did not complete her treatment plan in a timely manner because\r\nshe did not complete it within one year of Child's removal. She noted that the\r\n\r\n4 The adoption matter was held in abeyance until after the termination of parental \n\r\nrights and any appeal were resolved. \n\r\n5 Mother failed to visit Child in the months of July, September, and November \n\r\n2008; January, June, August, and October 2009; February, April, and July 2010; \n\r\nand September 2011. \n\r\n\nfoster care review board, which meets every six months, recommended adoption at\r\nits previous five or six meetings. However, she testified that DSS supported the\r\nreunification of Mother and Child as being in Child's best interest.\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Broom testified concerning her family and Child's place in it. Both Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Broom hold advanced degrees in their respective fields and are gainfully\r\nemployed. At the time, in addition to having four-year-old Child, they had three\r\nsons, ages seventeen, fifteen, and ten and another foster child, age three, in their\r\nhome. Their sons are all accomplished as students, athletes, and musicians.\r\n\r\n       When Child arrived in the Brooms' home she suffered from serious\r\ndevelopmental difficulties. At the age of five months, when placed stomach-down\r\non a blanket she was unable to roll-over, move, or even turn her head to breathe.\r\nShe was also unable to track movement with her eyes or sit up on her own. Since\r\nthat time, the Broom family engaged in numerous treatments and exercises to\r\naddress Child's misshapen head and developmental difficulties. The most striking\r\nexample is that Child had to wear a corrective helmet for six months in order to\r\nreshape her head. She is now developmentally advanced for her age and is actively\r\ninvolved in family activities, school, and church.\r\n\r\n        Over Mother's objection that neither she nor her report had been disclosed\r\nprior to the hearing, bonding expert Meredith Loftis testified about the bond\r\nbetween Child and the Brooms. She expressed her opinion that Child should be\r\nplaced with the Brooms and highlighted the permanency needed in a child's life\r\nand the feeling of permanency Child had developed in the Broom family. She\r\ntestified that Child views the Brooms as her family and if she was removed from\r\nthem, she would be at risk of suffering from attachment disorder which may cause\r\nemotional, behavioral, and substance abuse problems later in life.\r\n\r\n       Mother testified an attorney was appointed to represent her in the DSS case.\r\nHowever, she last heard from him in 2009, and was unsure why he failed to\r\ncontinue to represent her. He did state to her at one point that he could not\r\nrepresent her in the Brooms' TPR action. It seems he was still representing her at\r\nthe initial permanency planning hearing on April 2, 2009, because he is listed as\r\nappearing as her counsel in the ensuing order.\r\n\r\n       Mother further testified that her understanding from the April 2009\r\npermanency planning hearing was that she had completed the treatment plan but\r\nwould have to return to court to have Child returned. She thought DSS would\r\nschedule the necessary hearing. She acknowledges that at no time, even after\r\nretaining South Carolina Legal Services, did she file a motion for Child's return.\r\n\n       The guardian ad litem for Child testified that termination of parental rights\r\nand adoption by the Brooms was in Child's best interest. In support, he testified\r\nthat Child is more bonded with the Brooms and that to remove her from their home\r\nwould be detrimental. Additionally, a volunteer guardian ad litem testified that\r\ntermination of parental rights and adoption by the Brooms was in Child's best\r\ninterest due to the bond she developed with them in the important early years of\r\nher life.\r\n\r\n      The family court entered a final order terminating Mother's parental rights.\r\nThe order first found that the termination of parental rights and adoption by the\r\nBrooms was in Child's best interest. It relied on the fact that Child was removed\r\nfrom Mother at age five months and had lived with the Brooms for over four years\r\nthereafter. It also highlighted the efforts by the Brooms to alleviate Child's\r\nproblems, the improvement Child made in their home, Child's beliefs that the\r\nBrooms are her family, the bonding between Child and the Brooms, and the\r\nexcellent home environment the Brooms provide Child. The order also\r\nacknowledged Mother's love for Child and the strides Mother had made in\r\nimproving her life and ability to serve as a parent. In conclusion, the order\r\nsummarized TPR and adoption as being in Child's best interest because:\r\n\r\n      [Child] has essentially spent the entire 4½ years of her life with the\r\n      Brooms. She is fully integrated into the Broom family, and has very\r\n      little bonding or attachment to [Mother]. . . . The evidence is\r\n      compelling that taking this child out of her current home would be a\r\n      highly traumatic event for [her], presenting a significant risk of major\r\n      long-term consequences including attachment and other possible\r\n      disorders.\r\n\r\n       Turning to the statutory grounds for TPR, the court found that the Brooms\r\nfailed to present clear and convincing evidence of a diagnosable condition, drug\r\naddiction, or abandonment, and thus two of the alleged statutory grounds were not\r\nsatisfied. However, the court found both the ground of a child remaining in foster\r\ncare for fifteen of the last twenty-two months and the failure to visit ground were\r\nsatisfied. Regarding the failure to visit, the court found \"an inconsistent pattern of\r\nvisitation,\" and that Mother failed to visit Child \"for a period exceeding six\r\nconsecutive months from December 21, 2007 until August, 2008.\" As to the\r\nfifteen months in foster care ground, the court found it was estalished by the\r\nundisputed evidence that Child had lived with the Brooms in foster care for the\r\nprevious four years. The court also considered Charleston County Department of\r\nSocial Services v. Marccuci, 396 S.C. 218, 721 S.E.2d 768 (2011), which held that\r\n\nthe fifteen months ground should not be strictly applied where much of the delay is\r\nattributable to others. The court acknowledged that Mother experienced significant\r\nprocedural delays attributable to others in that her counsel \"unilaterally stopped\r\nrepresenting her in the DSS action,\" and the case was continued four times\r\ndelaying its resolution by one year—from October 27, 2010, to November 1, 2011.\r\nHowever, it found those delays distinguishable from the delays in Marccuci\r\nbecause Child had already been in foster care for fifteen months before any of\r\nthose delays occurred. It also found Marccuci distinguishable because there the\r\nfather did not abuse or neglect the child, whereas here, Mother admitted she abused\r\nand neglected Child.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, the family court terminated Mother's parental rights and placed\r\ncustody of the Child with the Brooms. Mother filed a motion for reconsideration\r\nbased on the failure to appoint her counsel and that the court erred, in light of\r\nMarccuci, in strictly adhering to the fifteen of twenty-two months ground where\r\nthere were procedural delays she did not cause. The family court denied the\r\nmotion and this appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\nI. \t   Did the family court err in terminating Mother's parental rights where\r\n       she was denied the assistance of appointed counsel?\r\n\r\nII. \t Did the family court err in finding a statutory ground for termination\r\n      existed?\r\n\r\nIII. \t Did the family court err in permitting an expert to testify where the\r\n       expert and her report were not disclosed prior to the hearing?\r\n\r\n                               LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. \t   DENIAL OF COUNSEL\r\n\r\n       Mother asserts the family court erroneously terminated her parental rights\r\nbecause she was denied counsel at critical stages of the proceedings. She contends\r\nthat had counsel been appointed, her attorney would have moved for the return of\r\nChild. She asserts therefore that because Child would not have been in foster care\r\nfor as long, Child would have been returned to her. While we find the denial of\r\ncounsel was erroneous, we conclude the error did not prejudice Mother or render\r\nthe termination of her parental rights unfair, and thus does not warrant reversal.\r\n\n       In the criminal context, the United States Supreme Court has held the Due\r\nProcess Clause of the United States Constitution provides criminal defendants with\r\nan absolute right to counsel where their liberty is at stake. See Argersinger v.\r\nHamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 37–38 (1972). In light of the serious consequences of a\r\ncriminal conviction, the Court concluded that \"in our adversary system of criminal\r\njustice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be\r\nassured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.\" Gideon v. Wainwright, 372\r\nU.S. 335, 344 (1963). However, the procedural protections required by the Due\r\nProcess Clause in the criminal setting do not necessarily apply to the termination of\r\nparental rights.\r\n\r\n       In Lassiter v. Department of Social Services of Durham County, 452 U.S. 18\r\n(1981), the United States Supreme Court held there is no absolute right to counsel\r\nfor an indigent parent in a TPR proceeding. In reaching that conclusion, the Court\r\nviewed its prior case law as establishing a presumption that an absolute right to\r\nappointed counsel only exists where a defendant's physical liberty is at stake. Id. at\r\n25. Specifically, the Court noted there is no per se right to counsel for parole\r\nrevocation proceedings or for a criminal prosecution in which imprisonment is not\r\na possible punishment. See id. at 26 (citing Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979);\r\nMorrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972)). Applying the three-part test set forth\r\nin Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), for determining what procedural\r\nprotections due process requires, the Court concluded a parent subject to a\r\ntermination of parental rights proceeding has an extremely important right at stake,\r\nthe state's interest is often aligned with the parent in seeking a correct decision, and\r\nthe complexity of a TPR proceeding and the likely incapacity of the parent create a\r\nrisk of erroneous determinations. Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 31. The Court thus held\r\nthat while there is no absolute right of indigent parents in TPR proceedings to have\r\nappointed counsel, there may be specific cases where the parent's interest is\r\nparticularly strong, the state's interest is weak, and there is such a high risk of error,\r\nthat due process would require the appointment of counsel. Id. Accordingly, the\r\nCourt adopted the standard set forth in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973),\r\nas governing whether due process requires the appointment of counsel for a\r\nparticular indigent parent in a TPR proceeding. Lassiter, 452 U.S. at 31–32.\r\nUnder that standard, if considering the totality of the circumstances \"fundamental\r\nfairness\" would be lacking absent appointed counsel, the state must provide\r\ncounsel. Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 790.\r\n\r\n      This Court dealt with the issue of appointed counsel for indigent TPR\r\ndefendants in South Carolina Department of Social Services v. Vanderhorst, 287\r\nS.C. 554, 340 S.E.2d 149 (1986), where a mother's parental rights were terminated\r\n\nwithout representation by counsel. The Court described Lassiter as requiring \"a\r\nreviewing court [to balance] private interests, the government's interests and the\r\nrisk that procedures used will lead to erroneous decisions.\" Id. at 559, 340 S.E.2d\r\nat 152. Based on the use of expert psychological evaluations, the mother's erratic\r\nbehavior indicating mental instability, and the damage to her position caused by\r\nher pro se representation, the Court held that due process required that the mother\r\nbe appointed counsel. Id. at 559–60, 340 S.E.2d at 152–53. The Court also\r\ndeclined to \"join the majority of states which hold that due process requires the\r\nappointment of counsel for indigents in all termination of parental rights case,\" but\r\ndid express \"caution that under our interpretation of Lassiter[,] cases in which\r\nappointment of counsel is not required should be the exception.\" Id. at 560, 340\r\nS.E.2d at 153.\r\n\r\n      Thereafter, the South Carolina General Assembly enacted Section 20-7-1570\r\nof the South Carolina Code (Supp. 1985) which provided: \"If the parent is not\r\nrepresented by counsel, the judge shall make a determination on a case by case\r\nbasis whether counsel is required. If the parent is indigent and counsel is not\r\nappointed, the judge shall enter on the record the reasons counsel was not\r\nrequired.\" Vanderhorst, 287 S.C. at 559 n.3, 340 S.E.2d at 152 n.3. As the Court\r\nrecognized, that statute was merely \"legislative recognition of the Lassiter\r\nrequirement.\" Id. However, the legislature subsequently replaced that statute with\r\na provision that: \"Parents, guardians, or other persons subject to a termination of\r\nparental rights action are entitled to legal counsel. Those persons unable to afford\r\nlegal representation must be appointed counsel by the family court, unless the\r\ndefendant is in default.\" S.C. Code § 63-7-2560(A) (2010).\r\n\r\n       Thus, while under the United States Constitution and the South Carolina\r\nConstitution there is no absolute right to counsel for an indigent parent subject to a\r\nTPR proceeding, S.C. Code §63-7-2560(A) now provides an absolute statutory\r\nright to counsel for indigent parents subject to TPR proceedings. The statutory\r\nlanguage could not be clearer in providing that an indigent parent must be\r\nappointed counsel. Furthermore, the absolute nature of the requirement is\r\nespecially manifest in light of the fact that the current statute replaced a statute\r\nrequiring counsel only on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n       Here, Mother was denied counsel because the TPR action was a private\r\naction rather than one filed by DSS. However, Section 63-7-2560(A) makes no\r\ndistinction based on the party seeking the termination of parental rights. Rather, it\r\nprovides that any indigent parent subject to \"a termination of parental rights\r\n\nproceeding\" must be provided counsel. S.C. Code § 63-7-2560(A). Thus, the\r\ndenial of counsel was erroneous.6\r\n\r\n       In considering whether the denial of counsel requires reversal, we are\r\nmindful that TPR actions are markedly different from criminal cases, the area in\r\nwhich the denial of counsel commonly arises. While the remedy of reversing and\r\nremanding for the appointment of counsel and a new trial where a defendant is\r\ndenied counsel is appropriate in a criminal case, that is not necessarily true in the\r\nTPR context. In a sense, the facts of a criminal trial are frozen in time. However,\r\na family court considering the termination of parental rights must make a decision\r\nas to what is best for the child going forward. Thus, the merits of a TPR action can\r\nchange during the pendency of the action, whereas the merits of a criminal trial do\r\nnot ordinarily change during its pendency. Additionally, while criminal cases are\r\nfocused on the rights of the defendant, a TPR action must consider both the right of\r\nthe parent to raise her child and the child's best interest.\r\n\r\n       In short, unlike a criminal case, it may be impossible to truly remedy the\r\ndenial of counsel in a TPR action. The best interest of a child changes with the\r\npassage of time, and thus there is no way to turn back the hands of time and put a\r\nparent in the position she would have been in had she not been denied counsel.\r\nFurthermore, simply ordering the child to be returned to the parent may be neither\r\na just nor proper remedy because the best interest of the child is paramount and\r\nmay not be served by that remedy.\r\n\r\n       For those reasons, we elect to join other courts in holding that where a parent\r\nis deprived of counsel for some time prior to the final TPR hearing, but has counsel\r\nat the final hearing, the decision will only be reversed where the denial of counsel\r\nprejudiced the parent. See, e.g., Briscoe v. State, Dep't of Human Servs., 912\r\nS.W.2d 425, 427 (Ark. 1996); In re People ex rel. S.D. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 691\r\nN.W.2d 586, 592 (S.D. 2004); In re Tiffany Marie S., 470 S.E.2d 177, 186–87 (W.\r\nVa. 1996); In re MN, 78 P.3d 232, 240 (Wyo. 2003). Accordingly, where the\r\nparent erroneously denied counsel was not prejudiced thereby, the denial of\r\ncounsel is not reversible error.\r\n\r\n       Here, while the lack of counsel likely delayed the resolution of the case, we\r\nfind that it did not affect the outcome. Even had counsel been present, the\r\nstatutory grounds for termination would have been satisfied and it would have been\r\n\r\n6 We note that Mother's constitutional right to counsel under the case-by-case\r\napproach set forth in Lassiter and Vanderhorst was not at issue here.\r\n\nin Child's best interest for Mother's parental rights to be terminated. Child was\r\nplaced in foster care on August 24, 2007, and while the exact date is not clear from\r\nthe record, Mother's appointed attorney did not cease representing her until after\r\nApril 2, 2009.7 At that point, Child had already been in foster care for nineteen\r\nmonths, and thus the fifteen months in foster care was already satisfied while she\r\nwas still represented by counsel.\r\n\r\n       Also, assuming her counsel abandoned her following the hearing on April 2,\r\n2009, Mother was unrepresented for only sixteen months before she obtained\r\nrepresentation from S.C. Legal Services in August of 2010. That sixteen months\r\nrepresents only a small portion of the fifty months Child had been in foster care at\r\nthe time of the final hearing. It is inescapable that a longer period of delay in the\r\nresolution of this case—the nineteen months between the removal of Child in\r\nAugust 2007 and the permanency planning hearing in April 2009—was due to\r\nMother's failure to satisfy her treatment plan. Also, Mother was not even capable\r\nof having Child returned for some portion of the sixteen months she was\r\nunrepresented as she agreed at the April 2, 2009 permanency planning hearing that\r\nshe had not yet completed the treatment plan and was not ready to have Child\r\nreturned to her.\r\n\r\n        Furthermore, Mother was again represented for fifteen months from August\r\n2010 until the final hearing in November 2011, and she never filed a motion for the\r\nreturn of Child during that time. Additionally, that fifteen month period means that\r\nthe fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months in foster care ground for TPR was\r\nsatisfied even excluding the time before she obtained counsel in the TPR action.\r\n\r\n       Finally, even if the lack of counsel affected the length of time Child\r\nremained in foster care, the failure to visit ground for termination was still\r\nsatisfied. Mother did not argue that the lack of counsel affected her ability to visit\r\nChild, nor do we see how it could have. To the contrary, Mother did not provide\r\nany explanation beyond her own conduct for the majority of the visits she missed.\r\nTherefore, we conclude her denial of counsel was not prejudicial.\r\n\r\n7While the details are not clear from the record, we are deeply concerned that here\r\nan appointed attorney apparently unilaterally terminated his representation of\r\nMother. The Rules of Professional Conduct could not be clearer that \"[a] lawyer\r\nmust comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal\r\nwhen terminating a representation.\" Rule 1.16, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nFurthermore, attorneys have a duty to communicate with their clients. See Rule\r\n1.4, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n\nII.   STATUTORY GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION\r\n       The family court found that two statutory grounds for termination were\r\nsatisfied: Child having been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-\r\ntwo months and Mother's failure to visit. Mother contends the family court erred\r\nbecause those grounds were not satisfied by clear and convincing evidence. We\r\ndisagree.8\r\n\r\n       The statutory grounds for termination of parental rights must be proven by\r\nclear and convincing evidence. Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 257, 296\r\nS.E.2d 338, 339 (1982). On appeal, pursuant to its de novo standard of review, the\r\nCourt can make its own determination from the record of whether the grounds for\r\ntermination are supported by clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\nServs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\n      A.    Fifteen of the Most Recent Twenty-Two Months in Foster Care\r\n       Section 63-7-2570(8) of the South Carolina Code (2010) provides for the\r\ntermination of parental rights where: \"The child has been in foster care under the\r\nresponsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.\"\r\nMother did not contest the fact that Child continuously remained in foster care for\r\nover four years prior to the TPR hearing—from August 24, 2007, until November\r\n1, 2011. Thus, there can be no dispute that simply in terms of time spent in foster\r\ncare, the ground was satisfied.\r\n\r\n        The real crux of Mother's argument is that the resolution of the case was\r\nextensively delayed for reasons beyond her control and thus the family court erred\r\nin strictly adhering to the statutory ground. In support, Mother relies on Marccuci\r\nand Loe v. Mother, Father, & Berkeley County Department of Social Services, 382\r\nS.C. 457, 675 S.E.2d 807 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\n      In Marccuci, a father was arrested and his daughter was removed to DSS\r\ncustody. His parental rights were later terminated on the ground the child had been\r\nin foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months, among other grounds.\r\n\r\n8 We note that Mother made a conclusory assertion in her brief that the family\r\ncourt erred in considering Child's best interest prior to determining whether a\r\nstatutory ground for termination existed. Mother failed to raise that issue to the\r\nfamily court, and thus it is not preserved for our review. Hoffman v. Powell, 298\r\nS.C. 338, 340 n.2, 380 S.E.2d 821, 822 n.2 (1989) (holding that a claim not raised\r\nbefore the trial court will not be considered for the first time on appeal).\r\n\nMarccuci, 396 S.C. at 224, 721 S.E.2d at 772. On appeal, the Court held that\r\nwhile the family court was technically correct in finding the ground satisfied, the\r\nparticular facts of the case caused the ground to not support termination of parental\r\nrights. The Court stated, \"Where there is 'substantial evidence that much of the\r\ndelay . . . is attributable to the acts of others,' a parent's rights should not be\r\nterminated based solely on the fact that the child has spent greater than fifteen\r\nmonths in foster care.\" Id. at 227, 721 S.E.2d at 773 (quoting S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\nServs. v. Cochran, 356 S.C. 413, 420, 589 S.E.2d 753, 756 (2003) (Pleicones, J.,\r\nconcurring)). The Court went on to conclude that \"the delays generated and road\r\nblocks erected in the removal action made it impossible for the parties to regain\r\nlegal custody of [the child] prior to the expiration of the fifteen month period.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       In Loe, the family court terminated a mother's parental rights based on the\r\nfifteen months ground, among others, after her children were in foster care for over\r\nthree years. Loe, 382 S.C. at 461–62, 675 S.E.2d at 809–10. DSS admitted that it\r\nhad caused the delays in reunifying the mother and her children. Id. at 469, 675\r\nS.E.2d at 814. On appeal, the court of appeals held that the fifteen months ground\r\nwas not satisfied because DSS was responsible for the delays. Id. at 471, 675\r\nS.E.2d at 814.\r\n\r\n       Marccuci and Loe are inapposite here. While the resolution of this case was\r\ndelayed in part for reasons beyond Mother's control, it was also significantly\r\ndelayed due to her failure to participate in her treatment plan. Furthermore, Child\r\nhad already been in foster care for fifteen months before any of the delay not\r\nattributable to Mother occurred. Mother, and no one else, through her drug usage\r\nand resistance to the treatment plan, caused Child to remain in foster care for\r\nfifteen months. The delay that followed does not change the fact that Child spent\r\nan excessive period of time during the crucial early years of her life in foster care\r\nsolely because of Mother's actions. Accordingly, we find the fifteen months in\r\nfoster care statutory ground for termination satisfied by clear and convincing\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n      B.     Failure to Visit\r\n       Mother also argues the family court erred in finding she willfully failed to\r\nvisit Child. She does not dispute that she failed to visit Child for a period of six\r\nmonths or more in 2008. Rather, she argues the period she failed to visit in 2008 is\r\ninsufficient to find the ground satisfied and there is no evidence her failure to visit\r\nwas willful. We disagree.\r\n\n       Section 63-7-2570(3) provides that parental rights may be terminated where\r\n\"[t]he child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,\r\nand during that time the parent has willfully failed to visit the child.\" Willfulness\r\nis a question of intent to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each\r\ncase, and the family court judge has wide discretion in making the determination.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992).\r\nWhile the judge has wide discretion, willfulness must be established by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 137, 538\r\nS.E.2d 285, 289 (Ct. App. 2000). Conduct by a parent that shows a purpose to\r\nforego parental duties is willful \"because it manifests a conscious indifference to\r\nthe rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.\" S.C.\r\nDep't of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 630, 627 S.E.2d 718, 721–22 (2006).\r\n\r\n        Mother contends the facts of her case are analogous to those in South\r\nCarolina Department of Social Services v. M.R.C.L., 390 S.C. 329, 701 S.E.2d\r\n757 (Ct. App. 2010), rev'd on other grounds, 393 S.C. 387, 712 S.E.2d 452 (2011),\r\nand the failure to visit finding should be overturned for the same reasons. There,\r\nthe mother was permitted to visit her child for fifteen months and made fourteen\r\nvisits, but the visits were characterized as \"sporadic,\" with three of them occurring\r\nduring the month preceding the TPR hearing. Id. at 335, 701 S.E.2d at 760. The\r\ncourt of appeals noted that \"South Carolina courts have not quantified how many\r\nvisits a parent may make while legally failing to visit.\" Id. at 335, 701 S.E.2d at\r\n759. The court reversed the finding of failure to visit because the mother visited\r\nthe child on average once per month and the record failed to provide sufficient\r\nevidence of willfulness. Id. at 335, 701 S.E.2d at 760.\r\n\r\n       This case is materially distinguishable from M.R.C.L. There, the evidence\r\nonly indicated the visitation was sporadic, not that there was a sustained period\r\nduring which no visitation occurred. Also, in M.R.C.L., the mother visited on\r\naverage once per month. Here, Mother failed to visit for eight consecutive months\r\nand visited significantly less than once per month—visiting only thirty-four times\r\nover the fifty months Child was in foster care.\r\n\r\n       While there was no evidence the mother's sporadic visitation was willful in\r\nM.R.C.L., here there was ample evidence of willfulness. Willfulness does not\r\nmean that the parent must have some ill-intent towards the child or a conscious\r\ndesire not to visit; it only means that the parent must not have visited due to her\r\nown decisions, rather than being prevented from doing so by someone else.\r\nMother was questioned at the TPR hearing as to why she failed to visit for eight\r\nmonths in 2008 and her only explanation was that she \"wasn't where I needed to be\r\n\nat the time\" and that she was incarcerated for a portion of that time. In other\r\nwords, she does not explain her failure to visit for that period of time as the result\r\nof anything but her own choices and actions. Similarly, Mother was not able to\r\nprovide an explanation for why she failed to visit Child in September 2011, just\r\ntwo months prior to the TPR hearing, other than to say that she was sure she called\r\nto schedule a visit. While Mother tried to explain away the lack of visits as\r\nresulting from difficulties scheduling visits with DSS and the Brooms, that\r\nexplanation does not alter the fact that she missed numerous months of visitation\r\nwhen it was clearly possible to schedule at least one visit per month. In\r\nconclusion, Mother's willful failure to visit Child for eight months followed by\r\ninfrequent and sporadic visitation over the following years is sufficient to satisfy\r\nthis statutory ground.\r\n\r\nIII.   EXPERT TESTIMONY\r\n       Finally, Mother argues the family court erred in permitting the Brooms'\r\nbonding expert, Meredith Loftis, to testify. At the hearing, Mother objected to\r\nLoftis' testimony on the ground she \"was never given any sort of notice of a written\r\nreport or her testimony.\" Mother's counsel explained that she had twice requested\r\na list of the Brooms' witnesses, but Loftis had never been disclosed, and the\r\nBrooms' counsel admitted he failed to disclose Loftis. The Brooms' called Loftis\r\nas a witness, and the court stated it was going to permit her to testify over Mother's\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\n       We find Mother has abandoned this issue. Issues raised in a brief but not\r\nsupported by authority may be deemed abandoned and not considered on appeal.\r\nHunt v. Forestry Comm'n, 358 S.C. 564, 573, 595 S.E.2d 846, 851 (Ct. App.\r\n2004). Her brief cites no authority, other than Family Court Rule 25 which only\r\nencourages the prompt exchange of information, in support of her position. She\r\nalso presents no argument as to how the family court's ruling was an abuse of\r\ndiscretion or prejudiced her. See Fields v. Reg'l Med. Cent. Orangeburg, 363 S.C.\r\n19, 25–26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (the admission or exclusion of evidence is\r\nwithin the trial judge's discretion and to warrant reversal an appellant must show\r\nboth abuse of discretion and prejudice).\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n      For the reasons set forth, while we hold it was error for Mother to be denied\r\ncounsel, we find both statutory grounds for TPR were satisfied during the time she\r\nhad appointed counsel, so we discern no prejudice. Because we find the statutory\r\ngrounds for termination were satisfied and termination of Mother's parental rights\r\n\nwas in Child's best interest, we affirm the family court's termination of Mother's\r\nparental rights.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.

The jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\nthe Town on the developers' due process claim, but awarded the developers\r\n$450,000 in actual damages on their equal protection claim. Both parties appealed.\r\nThe Town argues the circuit court erred in denying its motions for a directed\r\nverdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on the developers' equal\r\nprotection claim, and in granting the developers' motion for attorney's fees and\r\ncosts. The developers argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment\r\nin favor of the Town on its claims for equitable and declaratory relief. This Court\r\ncertified this case for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. We affirm in part\r\nand reverse in part.       FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n       In February 2007, the developers entered into a contract to purchase a\r\nthirteen-acre tract located on Bryan Road in the Town of Hollywood. Thereafter,\r\nthe developers filed an application with the Town's Planning Commission to\r\nrezone the property for residential use. The Planning Commission heard the matter\r\non June 14, 2007, at which time the developers presented a \"preliminary lot\r\nsketch\" and indicated their intent to subdivide and develop the property into\r\nseventeen residential lots. Commissioner Matthew Wolf informed the developers\r\ntheir plans did not require rezoning; instead, Wolf instructed the developers to file\r\nfor approval with the Planning Commission to subdivide their property. Wolf\r\nfurther stated that before the Planning Commission could hear a subdivision\r\napplication, the developers needed to give notice to all landowners within a 300-\r\nfoot radius of their property and gather information about roadways, drainage, and\r\ntimber removal. Another Commissioner stated,\r\n\r\n             Hopefully you can get all this information together and\r\n             maybe present it at a later date, possibly, and we can act\r\n             upon it. But as of tonight, based on what has been\r\n             presented to this Commission, we would not be doing our\r\n             job as Commissioners if we were to consider it.\r\n\nThe developers asked for clarification as to whether they needed to present the\r\nmatter to the Planning Commission, and Commissioner Wolf restated that the\r\ndevelopers should appear before the Commission again and present \"a plat for\r\napproval.\" The Planning Commission ultimately tabled the issue based on\r\n\"inadequate information and the fact that none of the ordinances of the Town [had]\r\nbeen followed.\"\r\n\r\n        The Planning Commission then opened the floor for public comments.\r\nCouncilwoman Annette Sausser stated she did not support the developers'\r\nsubdivision.1 Sausser stated Bryan Road was too narrow to handle any additional\r\ntraffic without improvement and noted the developers' property was located near a\r\ndangerous curve where multiple accidents had occurred.2 Sausser also cited\r\ndrainage and environmental concerns associated with a nearby marshland and\r\nstated the Town's constituents did not support the developers' subdivision.\r\n\r\n       Other constituents also expressed concern about drainage issues and Bryan\r\nRoad's ability to withstand additional traffic. One constituent stated, \"Bryan\r\nRoad[] is a one-car road. You cannot get two large vehicles past each other. And\r\nthe idea that there might be another 30 cars coming down through there is just so\r\ndifficult to imagine.\" Another constituent stated ingress and egress for residents\r\nalong Bryan Road would not be satisfactory with additional traffic, and also\r\nexpressed concern about the ability of emergency vehicles to access the road.\r\n\r\n       Subsequent to the meeting, the developers met with Kenneth Edwards, the\r\nTown's zoning administrator, who indicated he would approve the subdivision\r\nhimself if the developers applied for it in two phases. Edwards ultimately signed\r\nthe developers' proposed plats, purporting to approve them, in two stages—half of\r\nthe lots on June 22, 2007, and the remaining lots on June 27, 2007. Thereafter, the\r\ndevelopers closed on the property and recorded the plats in the Charleston County\r\nRMC office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1The developers assert that prior to their appearance before the Planning\r\nCommission, Sausser approached them, ran \"her thumb across her neck to simulate\r\ncutting her throat,\" and told them their project would \"never happen.\"\r\n2 Sausser stated she was familiar with Bryan Road because she formerly resided in\r\nStono Plantation, a residential neighborhood adjacent to the developers' property\r\nwhich was initially approved for subdivision in 1985. Commissioner Wolf also\r\nresides in Stono Plantation.\r\n\n       When the developers began working on the subdivision, the Town issued a\r\nstop-work order. After the developers indicated they would not comply with the\r\nstop-work order, the Town filed this action seeking declaratory and injunctive\r\nrelief. Specifically, the Town sought a declaration that the developers could not\r\nsubdivide their property without approval from the Town's Planning Commission\r\nand an injunction prohibiting subdivision of the property until such approval was\r\nobtained. The developers filed equal protection, due process, and state law\r\ncounterclaims. Thereafter, the parties struck the case with leave to restore in an\r\neffort to resolve the matter through another Planning Commission hearing.\r\n\r\n       On August 14, 2008, the developers appeared before the Planning\r\nCommission a second time to discuss the \"preliminary subdivision\" of their\r\nproperty. During the meeting, the Planning Commission informed the developers\r\nof multiple issues they needed to address before the Commission could approve the\r\nsubdivision, including an acceptable septic system, a wetlands certification letter,\r\nand a traffic study of Bryan Road. Again, constituents expressed concern about\r\nBryan Road's ability to handle a heightened level of traffic and the effect it would\r\nhave on the dangerous curve adjacent to the developers' property.\r\n\r\n       In reference to the traffic study, Commissioner Wolf stated, \"[N]o one's\r\ndenying access to the [developers'] lot. No one has ever suggested that there be no\r\naccess to that lot.\" Instead, Wolf stated, it is a matter of \"commonsense and safety\r\nfor the Town of Hollywood.\" Wolf stated Bryan Road is \"one of the most\r\ndangerous roads in Hollywood\" with a high density of traffic. Consequently, Wolf\r\nexplained, the Planning Commission requested a traffic study to ensure Bryan\r\nRoad could withstand a heightened level of traffic and that it would not hinder\r\nemergency vehicles' access to the properties along Bryan Road. The Planning\r\nCommission ultimately tabled the subdivision request until the developers\r\naddressed all necessary issues.\r\n\r\n       On March 29, 2010, the parties restored their case in the circuit court.\r\nThereafter, the Town moved for summary judgment on its claims for declaratory\r\nand injunctive relief as well as the developers' counterclaims. In response, the\r\ndevelopers submitted an affidavit by William Floyd. Floyd stated that during their\r\nfirst meeting, the Planning Commission instructed the developers they were in the\r\nwrong place and directed them to Edwards, the Town's zoning administrator, who\r\nsubsequently approved their plats. Floyd claimed the Town then took the position\r\nthat Edwards did not have authority under the Town's ordinances to approve the\r\nsubdivision, but could not cite to a specific ordinance or produce the ordinances for\r\nreview. Floyd claimed he made multiple demands for the ordinances, but the\r\nTown claimed it could not produce them because it \"was in the process of\r\n\n'recodifying' them and the [o]rdinances were not in any one place where they could\r\nbe retrieved.\" Floyd stated, \"The Town has never adopted a consistent policy with\r\nus. Rather, it evolves as is necessary to stop us.\" Floyd further stated, \"It is\r\nshocking that the Town now cites [o]rdinances which did not exist when this\r\ncontroversy began, and if the [o]rdinances did exist, which I doubt, the Town was\r\nunable to produce them.\"\r\n\r\n      The circuit court granted the Town's motion for summary judgment as to its\r\nclaims for equitable and declaratory relief, but denied the motion as to the\r\ndevelopers' counterclaims. The circuit court found the Town's ordinances did not\r\nvest Edwards with the \"authority to approve a final subdivision plat of this kind\" or\r\nto waive compliance with the subdivision-approval process set forth in the Town's\r\nordinances; rather, because the developers intended to subdivide their property into\r\nmore than three lots, the circuit court found the Planning Commission must\r\napprove the subdivision plats. The circuit court further found that although the\r\nTown's ordinances were in the process of recodification during the developers'\r\napplication process, they were effective during this time because the Town adopted\r\nthem in 1998 and preserved the original language in the recodified version.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court ruled the developers may not subdivide their\r\nproperty without the Planning Commission's approval, and that the plats Edwards\r\nsigned were \"null, void and of no effect.\"\r\n\r\n       At trial, Edward Horton, the Town's current zoning administrator, testified\r\nhe informed the developers, by way of letter and orally before the Planning\r\nCommission, of the requirements they needed to meet before the Commission\r\nwould approve their subdivision. These requirements included approval of a septic\r\nsystem, alternate access routes, and a tree survey, which are required of all\r\ndevelopers. Commissioner Wolf testified the Planning Commission also informed\r\nthe developers they needed to conduct a traffic study along Bryan Road, noting\r\n\"traffic is one of the key issues for any development [the Commission] review[s].\"\r\nWolf further testified that although the Town's ordinances did not require traffic\r\nstudies, the Planning Commission requires them as a matter of discretion \"where\r\nthere is a . . . critical juncture like this particular case where you have a dangerous\r\nintersection with a . . . road that doesn't conform to any county or state standards.\"\r\n\r\n      Mayor Jacqueline Heyward testified the Planning Commission did not\r\nrequire a traffic study for Wide Awake Park, a seven-acre park located on Trexler\r\nAvenue, because the park was already developed when the Town acquired it.\r\nMayor Heyward further noted lots were consolidated, rather than subdivided, to\r\nmake Wide Awake Park possible. Mayor Heyward also briefly testified about\r\nHolly Grove, a low-income housing project located on Baptist Hill Road.\r\n\nMayor Heyward testified Holly Grove was initiated prior to her tenure as mayor\r\nand that she did not think the Planning Commission required a traffic study, but\r\nstated Holly Grove was a \"planned development, which is different from a\r\nsubdivision.\" Mayor Heyward explained that although a planned development is\r\nsubject to the zoning process, including a wetland study, that process is different\r\nfrom the process of subdividing a piece of property. Mayor Heyward further\r\ntestified that neither Baptist Hill Road nor Trexler Avenue were dangerous roads.\r\n\r\n      After the developers rested, the Town moved for a directed verdict on all of\r\nthe developers' counterclaims, arguing they failed to meet their burden of proof.\r\nRegarding the equal protection claim, the developers responded,\r\n\r\n             The obvious disparity is in the adjoining subdivision,\r\n             which is Stono Plantation. No one has required Stono\r\n             Plantation to provide a traffic study or to prove that they\r\n             have access, and, in fact, the two subdivisions sit side by\r\n             side and utilize the same access, so it is abundantly clear\r\n             in this record that the two similarly situated property\r\n             owners are being held to different standards.\r\n\r\nConversely, the Town argued the developers failed to present any evidence\r\nconcerning the process Stono Plantation, or any other development, underwent to\r\nobtain subdivision approval. The developers responded, \"Your Honor, I think it's\r\nunnecessarily complicated. Bryan Road is either open to the public or it's not.\"\r\nThe circuit court granted the Town's motion for a directed verdict on the\r\ndevelopers' state law claims, but denied the motion as to the developers' equal\r\nprotection and due process claims.\r\n\r\n      After an initial deadlock, the jury returned a verdict for the Town on the\r\ndevelopers' due process claim, but awarded the developers $450,000 in actual\r\ndamages on their equal protection claim. The Town filed a post-trial motion for a\r\nJNOV, which the circuit court denied. The developers filed a motion for\r\nreconsideration of the circuit court's grant of summary judgment on the Town's\r\nclaims, and for attorney's fees and costs. The circuit court denied the motion for\r\nreconsideration but granted the motion for attorney's fees and costs, finding the\r\ndevelopers were entitled to fees under Section 15-77-300 of the South Carolina\r\nCode because they were the \"prevailing party.\"\r\n\n                                   ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n         I.\t    Whether the circuit court erred in granting the Town's motion\r\n                for summary judgment on its claims for equitable and\r\n                declaratory relief.3\r\n\r\n         II.\t   Whether the circuit court erred in denying the Town's motions\r\n                for a directed verdict and JNOV on the developers' equal\r\n                protection claim, and in awarding attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n        By statute, the trial court must uphold a decision by the Planning\r\nCommission unless there is no evidence to support it. Kurschner v. City of\r\nCamden Planning Comm'n, 376 S.C. 165, 173, 656 S.E.2d 346, 351 (2008) (citing\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-840 (2005)). This Court will uphold the trial judge's\r\ndecision unless it was based on an error of law or is not supported by the evidence.\r\nId. at 174, 656 S.E.2d at 351.      LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.\t      Equitable and Declaratory Relief\r\n       The developers argue the circuit court erred in granting the Town's motion\r\nfor summary judgment on its claims for equitable and declaratory relief. The\r\ndevelopers contend the circuit court \"erred by not giving any weight\" to Floyd's\r\naffidavit and refusing to \"accept that the Town operates without published\r\nordinances even though the affidavit . . . creates a genuine issue of material fact on\r\nthis point.\" The developers assert they presented evidence that the ordinances did\r\nnot exist at the time they applied for the subdivision of their property, and that \"the\r\nordinances came into existence after the fact to bolster the Town's position.\" The\r\ndevelopers argue that because the existence of the ordinances is in doubt, it is\r\nimpossible for this Court to conclude Edwards' approval of the plats was ultra\r\nvires. The developers further contend that if the Town's ordinances did exist,\r\nsummary judgment was nevertheless improper because, under section 30-12 of the\r\nTown's Code, their \"subdivision application\" was automatically approved after the\r\nPlanning Commission failed to take action on it within sixty days. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3   This issue addresses both of the questions the developers present to this Court.\r\n\n       In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the\r\nsame standard as the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Quail Hill, L.L.C. v.\r\nCnty. of Richland, 387 S.C. 223, 234, 692 S.E.2d 499, 505 (2010). Summary\r\njudgment is proper if, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Id. (citing Rule 56(c), SCRCP).\r\nHowever, it is not sufficient for a party to create an inference that is not reasonable\r\nor an issue of fact that is not genuine. Evans v. Stewart, 370 S.C. 522, 526, 636\r\nS.E.2d 632, 635 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n        Section 30-7 of the Town's Code states no subdivision plat may be filed or\r\nrecorded in the RMC Office and no building permits may be issued \"until the plat .\r\n. . has been submitted to and approved by the town planning commission according\r\nto the procedures set forth in this chapter.\" HOLLYWOOD, S.C., CODE § 30-17\r\n(2008). Section 30-34 provides the Planning Commission's procedure for review\r\nand approval of subdivision plats shall consist of two separate steps: (1) review and\r\napproval of a preliminary plat, and (2) review and approval of a final plat.\r\nHOLLYWOOD, S.C., CODE § 30-34(a) (2008). That section further provides that\r\n\"the developer may submit a sketch plan for the planning commission's informal\r\nreview prior to step one.\" HOLLYWOOD, S.C., CODE § 30-34(b). However, as an\r\nexception to the general rule that subdivision plats must be approved by the\r\nPlanning Commission, section 30-12 states the Town's zoning administrator may\r\napprove and sign plats without referring them to the Planning Commission upon a\r\nfinding that all requirements have been met and the property is being subdivided\r\ninto \"three or fewer lots.\" HOLLYWOOD, S.C., CODE § 30-12(1) (2008).\r\n\r\n       We find the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the\r\nTown with respect to its claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. The Town's\r\nordinances clearly state the Planning Commission, rather than the zoning\r\nadministrator, must approve subdivision plats if the property is subdivided into\r\nmore than three lots. See HOLLYWOOD, S.C., CODE §§ 30-12, 34. Because the\r\ndevelopers intended to subdivide their property into seventeen lots, Edwards did\r\nnot have authority to approve their plats. See id.; see also Carolina Chloride, Inc.\r\nv. Richland Cnty., 394 S.C. 154, 166‒68, 714 S.E.2d 869, 874‒76 (2011) (stating\r\nmisrepresentations of law made by a zoning administrator are generally not\r\nactionable even if made in good faith); Quail Hill, 387 S.C. at 236‒38, 692 S.E.2d\r\nat 506‒07 (finding a governmental entity is not estopped from enforcing its\r\nordinances where its employee gives erroneous information or acts in contradiction\r\nto an ordinance); Carolina Nat'l Bank v. State, 60 S.C. 465, 473, 38 S.E. 629, 632\r\n\n(1901) (stating a \"public officer derives his authority from statutory enactment\"\r\nand all persons dealing with an officer outside his scope of authority do so at their\r\nown peril).\r\n\r\n         Although the developers claim the Town enacted its ordinances after the\r\ndevelopers' subdivision application in an effort to thwart their project, the preface\r\nof the Town's Code states it was adopted in 1998 and simply recodified in 2008.\r\nHOLLYWOOD, S.C., CODE, Preface (2008), available at http://library.municode.com\r\n/index.aspx?clientId=14414 (last visited Jan. 30, 2013). Additionally, the 2008\r\nversion of the Code lists the section number each ordinance held in the 1998\r\nversion. See, e.g., HOLLYWOOD, S.C., CODE §§ 30-12, 34, 37-38. Thus, the\r\nTown's ordinances requiring that the Planning Commission approve subdivision\r\nplats existed long before the developers sought to subdivide their property in 2007.\r\nAlthough we are troubled by the Town's inability to produce a copy of its Code on\r\nat least one occasion, we find the developers were on notice that their intended\r\nsubdivision would require approval from the Planning Commission. During their\r\nfirst meeting, the Planning Commission instructed the developers that rezoning\r\nwas unnecessary, and that the developers would instead need to gather additional\r\ninformation and appear before the Commission at a later date to present a plat for\r\napproval. We take this opportunity, however, to remind the Town that its\r\nordinances must be made \"available for public inspection at reasonable times\" as\r\nrequired by Section 5-7-290 of the South Carolina Code.\r\n\r\n       We also reject the developers' argument that their subdivision application\r\nwas automatically approved due to the Planning Commission's alleged failure to\r\napprove or deny the application within sixty days. This argument is not preserved\r\nfor this Court's review because the circuit court did not rule on it and the\r\ndevelopers did not include it in their Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for\r\nreconsideration. See Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23‒24, 602 S.E.2d\r\n772, 779‒80 (2004) (stating an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\ncourt in order to be preserved for appellate review, and that a party must file a Rule\r\n59(e), SCRCP, motion to preserve an issue the trial court fails to rule on).\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, we find the circuit court properly granted summary judgment\r\nin favor of the Town on its claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.\r\n\r\nII.   Equal Protection and Attorney's Fees\r\n      The Town argues the circuit court erred in denying its motions for a directed\r\nverdict and JNOV on the developers' equal protection claim because they failed to\r\ndemonstrate that the Planning Commission treated them differently than other\r\n\nsimilarly situated developers. The Town asserts that neither Wide Awake Park nor\r\nHolly Grove is similarly situated to the developers' property because one is a park\r\nand the other is a low-income planned development. The Town further contends\r\nthe circuit court erred in granting the developers' motion for attorney's fees and\r\ncosts because the Town was entitled to a directed verdict or JNOV on the equal\r\nprotection claim or, at the very least, acted with \"substantial justification\" in\r\ndefending that claim. We agree.\r\n\r\n        When reviewing the trial court's ruling on a motion for a directed verdict or\r\nJNOV, this Court applies the same standard as the trial court by viewing the\r\nevidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party. RFT Mgmt. Co. v. Tinsley & Adams, L.L.P., 399 S.C. 322, 331‒\r\n32, 732 S.E.2d 166, 171 (2012). The trial court must deny a motion for a directed\r\nverdict or JNOV if the evidence yields more than one reasonable inference or its\r\ninference is in doubt. Id. Moreover, a JNOV motion may be granted only if no\r\nreasonable juror could have reached the challenged verdict. Id. This Court will\r\nreverse the trial judge's ruling only when there is no evidence to support the ruling\r\nor it is controlled by an error of law. Carolina Chloride, 394 S.C. at 163, 714\r\nS.E.2d at 873.\r\n\r\n       No person shall be denied equal protection of the law. U.S. CONST. AMEND.\r\nXIV, § 1; S.C. CONST. ART.

City of Folly Beach, 357\r\nS.C. 414, 428, 593 S.E.2d 462, 469 (2004). \"The sine qua non of an equal\r\nprotection claim is a showing that similarly situated persons received disparate\r\ntreatment.\" Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 354, 461 S.E.2d 388, 391\r\n(1995). Where an alleged equal protection violation does not implicate a suspect\r\nclass or abridge a fundamental right, the rational basis test is used. Vill. of\r\nWillowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000); Dunes W. Golf Club, L.L.C. v.\r\nTown of Mt. Pleasant, 401 S.C. 280, 293, 737 S.E.2d 601, 608 (2013); Sunset Cay,\r\n357 S.C. at 428‒29, 593 S.E.2d at 469. To prevail under the rational basis\r\nstandard, a claimant must show similarly situated persons received disparate\r\ntreatment, and that the disparate treatment did not bear a rational relationship to a\r\nlegitimate government purpose. Dunes W., 401 S.C. at 293‒94, 737 S.E.2d at 608;\r\nBibco Corp. v. City of Sumter, 332 S.C. 45, 53, 504 S.E.2d 112, 116 (1998).\r\n\r\n       In Dunes West, the Court clarified that the equal protection clause does not\r\nprohibit different treatment of people in different circumstances under the law.\r\nDunes W., 401 S.C. at 294‒95, 737 S.E.2d at 608‒09 (quoting Harbit v. City of\r\nCharleston, 382 S.C. 383, 396, 675 S.E.2d 776, 782‒83 (Ct. App. 2009)). In that\r\ncase, the Dunes West Golf Club (Dunes West) brought an equal protection claim\r\nagainst the Town of Mount Pleasant after it denied Dunes West's petition to rezone\r\n\na portion of the golf course property for residential use. Id. at 286‒87, 737 S.E.2d\r\nat 604‒05. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Mount\r\nPleasant. Id. Dunes West appealed, arguing summary judgment was improper\r\nbecause it presented evidence that Mount Pleasant granted another substantially\r\nsimilar rezoning petition and there was no rational basis for the disparate treatment.\r\nId. at 293, 737 S.E.2d at 608. This Court affirmed, finding there were material\r\ndifferences between the two rezoning petitions which demonstrated a rational basis\r\nfor treating them differently. Id. at 294‒95, 737 S.E.2d at 608‒09. Specifically,\r\nthe Court noted that unlike Dunes West's rezoning petition, the comparator's\r\npetition, Snee Farm Country Club, was accompanied by a comprehensive\r\ndevelopment proposal and a detailed impact assessment, involved virtually no\r\nalteration to golf course areas of play, received general support from the\r\ncommunity, and stipulated that monies generated from the rezoning were to be\r\napplied to specific recreational improvements. Id. Dunes West's petition, on the\r\nother hand, did not contain an impact assessment, was opposed by the community,\r\nand required alterations to wetlands, existing easements, and numerous areas of the\r\ngolf course. Id.\r\n\r\n       We find the circuit court erred in denying the Town's motions for a directed\r\nverdict and JNOV because the developers failed to show the Planning Commission\r\ntreated them differently than other similarly situated developers in the subdivision\r\napplication process. Instead, the developers claim \"this case is not the traditional\r\nequal protection case\" and cite arguments in support of their due process claim.\r\nSpecifically, the developers argue Councilwoman Sausser acted improperly by\r\nmaking a throat-cutting gesture and stating their development would \"never\r\nhappen.\" The developers further contend Commissioner Wolf should not have\r\nparticipated in the Planning Commission hearings because he lives in the adjoining\r\nsubdivision. However, while the developers assert these actions alone demonstrate\r\na denial of equal protection, the alleged misconduct relates only to the developers'\r\ndue process claim, which the jury rejected and the developers did not appeal. The\r\ndevelopers' confusion is further highlighted by the fact that they quote due process\r\nlaw in support of their equal protection argument, including A Helping Hand,\r\nL.L.C. v. Baltimore, 515 F.3d 356 (4th Cir. 2008) (discussing the factors to be\r\nconsidered for a substantive due process claim).\r\n\r\n      The pertinent issue before this Court is whether the developers presented\r\nevidence that the Planning Commission treated them differently than other\r\nsimilarly situated developers. See Dunes W., 401 S.C. at 293‒94, 737 S.E.2d at\r\n\n608; Bibco Corp., 332 S.C. at 53, 504 S.E.2d 116; Grant, 319 S.C. at 354, 461\r\nS.E.2d at 391. We find that, like the plaintiff in Dunes West, the developers failed\r\nto meet their burden of proof.\r\n\r\n      In response to the Town's motion for a directed verdict during trial, the\r\ndevelopers argued the Planning Commission treated the developers of Stono\r\nPlantation differently because it did not require a traffic study despite the fact that\r\nStono Plantation is adjacent to the developers' property. However, Stono\r\nPlantation is not a \"similarly situated\" comparator because it was approved for\r\nsubdivision in 1985, long before the Town adopted its ordinances and created the\r\nPlanning Commission in 1998.\r\n\r\n       The developers also argued the Planning Commission treated them\r\ndifferently than the developers of Wide Awake Park and Holly Grove because the\r\nCommission did not require traffic studies for those projects. However, there are\r\nmaterial differences between those projects and the developers' subdivision. See\r\nDunes W., 401 S.C. at 294‒95, 737 S.E.2d at 609. Wide Awake Park is a public\r\npark rather than a residential subdivision, was already developed when the Town\r\nacquired it, and required consolidation rather than subdivision of lots. Holly Grove\r\nis a low-income, \"planned development\" subject to a different approval process\r\nthan residential subdivisions. Moreover, unlike the developers' subdivision, the\r\ncommunity did not oppose either of those projects. See id. (stating public\r\nopposition furnishes a rational basis for disparate treatment in zoning decisions).\r\n\r\n       Additionally, neither Wide Awake Park nor Holly Grove is located on Bryan\r\nRoad and the developers failed to present evidence suggesting the projects posed\r\nthe same traffic and safety concerns as the developers' proposed subdivision. The\r\nTown presented evidence that Bryan Road is \"one of the most dangerous roads in\r\nHollywood\" and that the developers' property is located along a dangerous curve\r\nwhere multiple accidents have occurred. Commissioner Wolf testified the\r\nPlanning Commission's purpose behind requiring a traffic study was to ensure\r\nBryan Road could safely support additional travelers. Because the addition of a\r\nnew residential subdivision on Bryan Road would create a heightened level of\r\ntraffic, we find the Planning Commission's decision to require a traffic study was\r\nrationally related to the legitimate goal of maintaining the safety of its citizens\r\nliving and traveling along Bryan Road. See Strickland v. State, 276 S.C. 17, 21,\r\n274 S.E.2d 430, 432 (1981) (stating the government has a legitimate interest in the\r\nsafety of those using public roadways). We further find there are material\r\ndifferences between the developers' subdivision and its alleged comparators—\r\nWide Awake Park and Holly Grove—which demonstrate a rational basis for\r\n\ntreating them differently. See Dunes W., 401 S.C. at 295, 737 S.E.2d at 609;\r\nHarbit, 382 S.C. at 396, 675 S.E.2d at 782‒83.\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in denying the Town's motions\r\nfor a directed verdict and JNOV on the developers' equal protection claim.\r\nBecause the developers are no longer the \"prevailing party,\" we also find the\r\ncircuit court erred in awarding attorney's fees and costs to the developers. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 15-77-300(A) (stating the \"prevailing party\" may recover reasonable\r\nattorney's fees).                   CONCLUSION\r\n       We affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the\r\nTown on its claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, reverse the circuit court's\r\ndenial of the Town's motions for a directed verdict and JNOV on the developers'\r\nequal protection claim, and reverse the circuit court's award of attorney's fees and\r\ncosts to the developers.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27253","title":"Gibbs v.

State, 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395\r\n(1991), for PCR counsel failed to seek certiorari review following the denial of\r\nPetitioner's first PCR application. After being convicted by a jury of kidnapping,\r\narmed robbery, and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a\r\nviolent crime, and unsuccessfully pursuing a direct appeal, Petitioner sought PCR\r\non two grounds: (1) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to contemporaneously\r\nobject to the introduction of a lineup, a show-up, and in-court identifications; and\r\n(2) trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a jury instruction on the law of\r\nalibi as part of the defense strategy. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                                        I.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of April 10, 2005, a robbery occurred at a grocery store in\r\nGeorgetown, South Carolina. The police arrived to the scene shortly after the\r\nrobber fled. Three different witnesses were interviewed about the incident. One\r\nwitness, John Fowlkes, described the robber as a middle-aged or older black man\r\nwith a \"scruffy beard with distinct gray colorings in it.\" He also noted the robber\r\nwore a black hat and blue jacket. Another witness, Greg Morton, indicated the\r\nrobber was wearing a black hat and a blue or black jacket. Eric Sessions, the third\r\nwitness, informed police the robber was wearing a blue hat and a blue jacket.\r\nOfficers also reviewed a surveillance tape that captured the robbery, and a black\r\njacket found at Petitioner's home was positively identified by all three witnesses as\r\nthe jacket worn by the robber.\r\n\r\nApproximately ten days after the robbery, police officers presented two\r\nphotographic lineups, each containing six pictures of people generally matching\r\nthe description given by the witnesses, to each witness individually.1 The first\r\nphotographic lineup contained a picture of Petitioner. Upon viewing the lineups,\r\nFowlkes and Morton identified Petitioner as the robber. Sessions, however, was\r\nunable to identify the perpetrator via the lineups.\r\n\r\nNearly one week later, Petitioner was transported to the police station for\r\nquestioning. The three witnesses were brought to the station to view Petitioner.\r\n\r\n1At the time of trial, the second lineup had been lost. However, two police\r\nofficers and two of the witnesses testified that the photographs in the second lineup\r\nwere similar to the photographs contained in the first.\r\n\nAccording to Fowlkes, he was taken to a one-way mirror to determine whether\r\nPetitioner had any involvement in the robbery. Fowlkes testified he saw a white\r\nmale and Petitioner behind the glass and that he instantly recognized Petitioner as\r\nthe robber. Likewise, Morton testified Petitioner was in the room with two police\r\nofficers and was able to identify Petitioner as the robber. When Sessions viewed\r\nPetitioner, however, he informed police he was sure Petitioner was not the\r\nperpetrator.2\r\n\r\nPetitioner was subsequently charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, and\r\npossession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a violent crime.\r\n\r\nPetitioner moved to suppress the evidence related to the photographic lineup,\r\nshow-up, and any potential in-court identifications. Following a pretrial in camera\r\nhearing pursuant to Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972), the trial court denied\r\nPetitioner's motion to suppress. The trial court found the photographic lineup and\r\nshow-up identifications were not unduly suggestive and permitted the witnesses to\r\nmake in-court identifications at trial.\r\n\r\nAt trial, both Fowlkes and Morton identified Petitioner as the robber.3 Fowlkes's\r\nphotographic lineup identification, show-up identification, and in-court\r\nidentification were admitted into evidence without contemporaneous objection by\r\nthe defense.4 When the State sought to introduce Morton's photographic lineup\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 All three witnesses were also permitted to hear Petitioner's voice during the\r\nshow-up. Again, Fowlkes and Morton stated they recognized Petitioner's voice\r\nfrom the robbery, while Sessions stated it was not the robber's voice.\r\n3   Sessions, however, testified Petitioner was not the robber.\r\n4 Defense counsel later objected to the introduction of the photographic\r\nidentifications after the State requested the store surveillance footage be admitted\r\ninto evidence, stating, \"I mean, Your Honor, for clarification when the lineup was\r\nintroduced into evidence previously I think I did not voice an objection. I would\r\nlike the record to reflect that the lineup that was introduced was subject to a\r\nprevious objection. The court has ruled and admitted that lineup but I'd like the\r\nrecord to reflect that that is subject to our previous objection.\"\r\n\nidentification into evidence, defense counsel raised a contemporaneous objection.5\r\nHowever, defense counsel did not object to the introduction of Morton's show-up\r\nor in-court identifications.6\r\n\r\nFollowing the State's case-in-chief, Petitioner presented an alibi defense.\r\nSpecifically, Petitioner testified he was at home with his mother and girlfriend\r\nwatching television at the time the robbery occurred. Petitioner's mother and\r\ngirlfriend corroborated his story. Both testified they were home with Petitioner on\r\nthe night of the robbery watching the television show JAG between 9:00 and 10:00\r\np.m. The State presented two rebuttal witnesses who testified that the only two\r\nstations available to Petitioner did not air JAG on the night of the robbery.7\r\n\r\nDuring closing arguments, both defense counsel and the State presented arguments\r\nto the jury regarding Petitioner's alibi. The trial court held a charge conference\r\noutside the presence of the jury. Defense counsel did not request a jury instruction\r\non the law of alibi testimony. In its charge, the trial court provided instructions to\r\nthe jury on the burden of proof in criminal cases and reasonable doubt and\r\ninformed the jury they should consider only competent evidence and determine the\r\ncredibility of the witnesses. Additionally, the trial court instructed the jury on\r\nidentification and that the State had the burden of proving identity beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.8\r\n\r\nPetitioner was convicted by the jury on all three counts and sentenced to\r\nconcurrent terms of twenty years' imprisonment for the armed robbery and the\r\nkidnapping, and five years' imprisonment to run consecutively for the possession\r\n\r\n5 Specifically, defense counsel stated that his objection was \"[s]ubject to [his]\n\r\nprevious objection.\"\n\r\n6 Defense counsel did object to the introduction of the lineup itself into evidence. \n\r\n7 Petitioner's mother and girlfriend testified that the only channels available on \n\r\nPetitioner's television were ABC and FOX. Petitioner, however, testified that his \n\r\ntelevision also received two other channels, including the local CBS channel, \n\r\nwhich could have aired the CBS affiliated show. \n\r\n8The court explained that identification testimony is \"an expression of belief or \n\r\nimpression by a witness,\" and the accuracy of the identification must be \n\r\ndetermined by considering the believability of each identification witness. \n\r\n\nof a firearm during commission of a violent crime. On direct appeal, the court of\r\nappeals affirmed Petitioner's conviction and sentence. State v. Gibbs, Mem. Op.\r\nNo. 2007-UP-333 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 27, 2007).\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Petitioner filed two applications for PCR, which were consolidated\r\ninto one action. In seeking relief, Petitioner alleged defense counsel was\r\nineffective for failing to contemporaneously object to the introduction of the\r\nphotographic lineup, show-up, and in-court identifications and for failing to\r\nrequest an alibi charge.\r\n\r\nAt the PCR hearing, defense counsel testified he believed Petitioner's best defense\r\nwas to challenge the witnesses' inconsistent identifications but admitted he should\r\nhave objected to the introduction of the identification evidence and preserved the\r\nissue for appellate review. However, he assumed the identifications would be\r\nadmitted, and he was solely concerned with rebutting the identifications. Counsel\r\nalso testified that he did not request the jury instruction on the law of alibi because\r\nhe believed the identification issues was the stronger defense strategy. He\r\nnonetheless acknowledged that he should have requested an alibi charge.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court found defense counsel was deficient for failing to\r\ncontemporaneously object to the introduction of the photographic lineup, show-up,\r\nand in-court identifications because counsel's mistake foreclosed review of the\r\nissues on appeal. However, the PCR court found Petitioner was not prejudiced by\r\ncounsel's deficiency because the trial court admitted the identifications after\r\nconducting a thorough Neil v. Biggers hearing.\r\n\r\nRegarding the alibi charge, the PCR court found defense counsel's performance\r\nwas deficient because he failed to ensure that an alibi instruction was given to the\r\njury. However, the PCR court found that Petitioner had not proven prejudice\r\nbecause the jury charge given \"was sufficient to inform the jury that the State had\r\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Petitioner] was not at home at the time of\r\nthe of the crime, and that he was, in fact, at the scene of the crime.\"9 Thus, the\r\nPCR court denied Petitioner relief. No appeal was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9The PCR court also noted that the critical issue in the case was credibility, and\r\nnot alibi \"because the jurors could believe either the State's identification witness,\r\nor they could believe the alibi witnesses, but not both.\" (emphasis in original).\r\n\nFollowing his initial PCR application and hearing, Petitioner filed a subsequent\r\nPCR application. Petitioner alleged his PCR counsel failed to file a notice of intent\r\nto appeal the denial of relief in his first PCR. The State filed an amended return\r\nrequesting a hearing pursuant to Austin v. State, 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395\r\n(1991). After an evidentiary hearing, the PCR court found Petitioner was entitled\r\nto belated review of the denial of his first PCR application. Thereafter, Petitioner\r\nfiled an Austin petition for writ of certiorari from the first PCR court's order\r\ndenying him relief. This Court granted the petition for writ of certiorari as to the\r\norder granting a belated appeal and from the order denying Petitioner PCR\r\npursuant to Rule 243, SCACR.             II.\r\n\r\nTo establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, \"the applicant must show\r\nthat: (1) counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing\r\nprofessional norms, and (2) counsel's deficient performance prejudiced the\r\napplicant's case.\" Speaks v. State, 377 S.C. 396, 399, 660 S.E.2d 512, 514 (2008)\r\n(citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)). An applicant may\r\ndemonstrate prejudice by establishing, by a reasonable probability that, \"but for\r\ncounsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\r\ndifferent.\" Edwards v. State, 392 S.C. 449, 459, 710 S.E.2d 60, 66 (2011) (citation\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the findings of the PCR court, this Court applies an \"any evidence\"\r\nstandard of review. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626\r\n(1989). The \"PCR court's ruling should be upheld if it is supported by any\r\nevidence of probative value in the record.\" Speaks, 377 S.C. at 399, 660 S.E.2d at\r\n514 (citing Cherry, 300 S.C. at 119, 386 S.E.2d at 626).\r\n\r\n                                       III.\r\n\r\nWith respect to both issues on appeal, the PCR court found trial counsel was\r\ndeficient, but that Petitioner was not prejudiced by his counsel's deficient\r\nperformance. We hold these findings are amply supported by the evidence. We\r\naddress each in turn.\r\n\n                                             A. \n\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends the PCR court erred in finding he was not prejudiced by\r\ncounsel's failure to contemporaneously object to the introduction of the\r\nphotographic lineup, show-up, and in-court identifications. We disagree.10\r\n\r\nThe purpose of an in camera hearing when the State offers identification witnesses\r\nis for the trial court to decide \"whether the in-court identification was of\r\nindependent origin or was the tainted product of the circumstances surrounding the\r\nprior, out-of-court identification.\" Id. (citing State v. Ramsey, 345 S.C. 607, 613,\r\n550 S.E.2d 294, 297 (2001)). When analyzing the admissibility of an out-of-court\r\nidentification, courts utilize a two-pronged analysis. State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282,\r\n287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447 (2000). First, a court must determine \"whether the\r\nidentification process was unduly suggestive.\" Id. (quoting Curtis v.\r\nCommonwealth, 396 S.E.2d 386, 388 (Va. Ct. App. 1990)). Second, a court must\r\ndetermine \"whether the out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable that\r\nno substantial likelihood of misidentification existed.\" Id.\r\n\r\nAfter conducting a thorough in camera Neil v. Biggers hearing, the trial court\r\ndetermined the identification procedures utilized by the police, specifically the\r\nphotographic lineup and the suggestive show-up, were not unduly suggestive.\r\n\r\nWe find support for the PCR court's determination that the trial court did not abuse\r\nits discretion in finding the photographic lineup identifications were reliable, as\r\nthere was not a substantial likelihood of misidentification. See Moore, 343 S.C. at\r\n286, 540 S.E.2d at 447. Moreover, we concur with the assessment that the failure\r\nof one witness to positively identify Petitioner as the robber does not require a\r\ncontrary result, as the credibility of the witnesses was thoroughly vetted and put to\r\nthe jury. See, e.g., Melton v. Williams, 281 S.C. 182, 186, 314 S.E.2d 612, 614–15\r\n(Ct. App. 1984) (citations omitted) (\"Assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a\r\nquestion for the jury, not the court, and it is the jury that decides the weight to be\r\nafforded the testimony.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n10The PCR court correctly held that defense counsel's failure to make a\r\ncontemporaneous objection constituted deficient performance. See State v.\r\nHoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (reiterating that \"[a]\r\ncontemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve an error for appellate\r\nreview\").\r\n\nAs to the show-up identifications, Petitioner argues that the trial court erroneously\r\nadmitted these identifications and trial counsel's failure to object was prejudicial.\r\nIn general, \"one-on-one show-ups have been sharply criticized, and are inherently\r\nsuggestive.\" Moore, 343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 448 (quoting Jefferson v. State,\r\n425 S.E.2d 915, 918 (Ga. Ct. App. 1992)). Nevertheless, there is no bright line\r\nrule concerning show-ups, as the ultimate decision is controlled by the particular\r\nfacts and circumstances. For example, courts have deemed a show-up procedure\r\nproper \"where it occurs shortly after the alleged crime, near the scene of the crime,\r\nas the witness' memory is still fresh, and the suspect has not had time to alter his\r\nlooks or dispose of evidence, and the showup may expedite the release of innocent\r\nsuspects, and enable the police to determine whether to continue searching.\" State\r\nv. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 78, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting 22A\r\nC.J.S. Criminal Law § 803). \"The closer in time and place to the scene of the\r\ncrime, the less objectionable is a show-up.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThus, the inquiry turns upon \"whether, under the totality of the circumstances,\r\nthere was a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\" State v. Moore,\r\n343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 448 (quoting Jefferson v. State, 425 S.E.2d at 918).\r\nIn other words, \"[s]uggestiveness alone does not mandate the exclusion of\r\nevidence.\" Mansfield, 343 S.C. at 78, 538 S.E.2d at 263 (citations omitted).\r\nInstead, \"[r]eliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of\r\nidentification testimony.\" Id. (citations omitted); see also State v. Moore, 343 S.C.\r\nat 287, 540 S.E.2d at 448 (\"[T]he identification need not be excluded as long as\r\nunder all the circumstances the identification was reliable notwithstanding any\r\nsuggestive procedure.\" (quoting Jefferson v. State, 425 S.E.2d at 918)).\r\n\r\nWhile the show-up procedures used here were unduly suggestive, the finding of the\r\nPCR court that the identifications were reliable under the circumstances is\r\nsupported by the evidence. Because the two witnesses previously identified\r\nPetitioner as the robber from the photographic lineup, the subsequent show-up may\r\nbe characterized as merely confirmatory and therefore reliable, despite the\r\nsuggestive procedure. See Moore, 343 S.C. at 287, 540 S.E.2d at 448–49\r\n(\"Although one-on-one show-ups have been sharply criticized, and are inherently\r\nsuggestive, the identification need not be excluded as long as under the [the totality\r\nof the] circumstances the identification was reliable notwithstanding any\r\nsuggestive procedure.\").\r\n\r\nIn sum, the failure of trial counsel to contemporaneously object to the\r\nidentification testimony did not result in any prejudice to Petitioner. The probative\r\n\nevidence in the record supports the PCR court's finding that the trial court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in admitting the evidence because the identifications were not\r\nso unduly suggestive as to create a likelihood of misidentification. Thus, a\r\ncontemporaneous objection by trial counsel would not have changed the outcome\r\nof Petitioner's case on appeal.            B.\r\n\r\nPetitioner also contends the PCR court erred in finding Petitioner was not\r\nprejudiced by his counsel's deficient performance in failing to request a jury\r\ncharge on alibi. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn evaluating whether a PCR applicant has suffered prejudice as a result of a jury\r\ncharge, the jury charge must be viewed \"in its entirety and not in isolation.\" Battle\r\nv. State, 382 S.C. 197, 203, 675 S.E.2d 736, 739 (2009).\r\n\r\nAt trial, Petitioner asserted an alibi defense, but defense counsel failed to request\r\nan alibi instruction. The PCR court determined that trial counsel's failure to\r\nrequest an alibi instruction constituted deficient representation, but Petitioner \"has\r\nnot proven that he suffered prejudice from the lack of an alibi charge.\" The PCR\r\ncourt relied on the jury charge as a whole to support its finding of no prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe relevant portion of the jury charge was:\r\n\r\n      Now, at issue in this case is the identification of the Defendant as the\r\n      person who committed the crimes charged. The State has the burden\r\n      of proving identity beyond a reasonable doubt. You must be satisfied\r\n      beyond a reasonable doubt of the accuracy of the identification of the\r\n      Defendant before you may convict the Defendant. . . . You must\r\n      determine the accuracy of the identification of the Defendant. You\r\n      must consider the believability of each identification witness in the\r\n      same way as you do any other witness. . . . Once, again, I instruct you\r\n      the burden of proof is on—the burden of proof is on the State and\r\n      extends to every element of the crime and this specifically includes\r\n      the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the\r\n      Defendant as the person who committed the crimes. If after\r\n      examining the testimony you have a reasonable doubt as to the\r\n      accuracy of the identification you must find the Defendant not guilty.\r\n\nGiven the clarity of the jury charge requiring the State to prove identity beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt, the PCR court's finding of no prejudice must be sustained under\r\nthe any evidence standard of review.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only. TOAL,\r\nC.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I respectfully dissent. While I agree that the PCR\r\njudge correctly found defense counsel ineffective for failing to request a jury\r\ncharge on alibi, I would find the PCR court erred in finding Petitioner was not\r\nprejudiced by counsel's deficient performance because (1) the evidence presented\r\nat trial warranted an alibi charge and (2) the State did not present overwhelming\r\nevidence of Petitioner's guilt.\r\n\r\n       An alibi charge is required where the defendant claims to be elsewhere at the\r\ntime the crime was committed. State v. Robbins, 275 S.C. 373, 374–75, 271\r\nS.E.2d 319, 319–20 (1980). Generally, the failure to give an alibi charge under\r\nthese circumstances constitutes reversible error. Id. However, if the State presents\r\noverwhelming evidence of a defendant's guilt at trial, then there is no reasonable\r\nprobability that the result of the trial would have been different had trial counsel\r\nrequested an alibi charge, and reversible error is not present. Ford v. State, 314\r\nS.C. 245, 248, 442 S.E.2d 604, 606 (1994). \"An alibi charge places no burden on\r\nthe defendant, but emphasizes that it is the State's burden to prove the defendant\r\nwas present at and participated in the crime.\" Roseboro v. State, 317 S.C. 292,\r\n294, 454 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1994) (citing State v. Bealin, 201 S.C. 490, 23 S.E.2d\r\n746 (1943)).\r\n\r\n       It is the settled law of this State that to avoid a finding of ineffectiveness for\r\nfailing to request an alibi charge, defense counsel \"must articulate a valid reason\r\nfor employing a certain strategy\" and therefore, not requesting the charge.\r\nRoseboro, 317 S.C. at 293–94, 454 S.E.2d at 313 (citation omitted). While our\r\nprior cases may have suggested a per se rule of prejudice based on the mere failure\r\nof defense counsel to request an alibi charge, see Commonwealth v. W. Hawkins,\r\n894 A.2d 716, 732 n.21 (Pa. 2006) (noting that this Court's ruling in Roseboro\r\n\"approaches a rule of per se prejudice under the circumstances\" but \"did not rule\r\nout that a reasonable basis for declining the instruction might occur\"), it is my\r\nopinion that claims of ineffectiveness based on the failure to request an alibi\r\ninstruction have been and should continue to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis\r\nunder an objective standard of reasonableness, Roseboro, 317 S.C. at 294, 454\r\nS.E.2d at 313. In Roseboro, this Court reiterated that \"[a]n alibi charge is\r\nconsidered especially crucial when the evidence is entirely circumstantial,\" and\r\n\"[t]he Solicitor's disparagement of [the] petitioner's alibi further renders counsel's\r\nstrategy unreasonable since an alibi charge would have corrected any impression\r\n[the] petitioner bore any burden of proof at trial.\" Id. at 294, 454 S.E.2d at 313. In\r\nanother instance, this Court found that the failure to request an alibi charge is not\r\nprejudicial where the State has presented \"overwhelming evidence of the\r\n\npetitioner's guilt.\" See Ford v. State, 314 S.C. 245, 248, 442 S.E.2d 604, 606\r\n(1994). All of these circumstances are contributive factors towards a\r\ndetermination that \"counsel's professed strategy\" in a given case is either valid or\r\n\"invalid under an objective standard of reasonableness.\" Roseboro, 317 S.C. at\r\n294, 454 S.E.2d at 313.\r\n\r\n       In the present case, Petitioner argues that the evidence of guilt was not\r\noverwhelming because Sessions testified that Petitioner was not the robber; there\r\nwas conflicting evidence concerning the color of the jacket found in Petitioner's\r\nhome; and there was no other evidence connecting Petitioner to the robbery and\r\nthat the State's reference to Petitioner's alibi testimony meant that the jury was not\r\nproperly instructed that alibi \"was not an affirmative defense imposing upon the\r\ndefendant the burden of proof.\" On the other hand, the State argues that defense\r\ncounsel and the State both referenced the alibi testimony in their closing\r\narguments, and the State acknowledged that it had the burden of proving its case.\r\nIn addition, the State argues that the trial judge gave a jury charge which included\r\ninstructions on the burden of proof and the credibility of witnesses. Therefore, the\r\nState contends, the jurors would have understood that, if they found the testimony\r\nof Petitioner, his mother, and his girlfriend credible, a verdict of not guilty would\r\nbe required.\r\n\r\n       The PCR court adopted a position consistent with the State's view that the\r\njury charge on the whole, including standard instructions on the burden of proof\r\nand the credibility of witnesses, prohibited a finding that Petitioner suffered\r\nprejudice in this case.11\r\n\r\n\r\n11Likewise, the majority relies on this portion of the jury charge to support its\r\nconclusion that the PCR court's finding of no prejudice is supported by evidence in\r\nthe Record. However, the legal concepts of alibi and credibility are not the same.\r\nWhile credibility deals with the believability of the witnesses, alibi testimony is\r\npresented for the purpose of proving that it was impossible for the defendant to\r\ncommit the crime charged. Compare, e.g., State v. Robbins, 275 S.C. 373, 375,\r\n271 S.E.2d 319, 320 (1980) (\"Alibi means elsewhere, and the charge should be\r\ngiven when the accused submits that he could not have performed the criminal act\r\nbecause he was in another place at the time of its commission.\"), with Small v.\r\nPioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 465, 494 S.E.2d 835, 843 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\n(\"The fact finder is imbued with broad discretion in determining credibility or\r\nbelievability of witnesses.\"). As discussed infra, I disagree with the majority that\r\n\n       However, in my view, the State did not present overwhelming evidence of\r\nPetitioner's guilt. The police did not find a gun, money, a black fishing hat, or any\r\nother physical evidence linking Petitioner to the robbery, with the exception of the\r\njacket. While all three witnesses identified the jacket found in Petitioner's home as\r\nthe one worn by the robber at trial, this evidence contradicted the witnesses'\r\nstatements concerning the jacket's appearance. Finally, the identity evidence was\r\nconflicting.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, as in Roseboro, an alibi charge here was necessary to correct any\r\nindication the Solicitor may have given in his closing remarks that Petitioner \"bore\r\nany burden of proof at trial.\" Roseboro, 317 S.C. at 294, 454 S.E.2d at 313\r\n(emphasis added); see also Riddle v. State, 308 S.C. 361, 364, 418 S.E.2d 308, 310\r\n(1992) (finding that the defense counsel's error in failing to request an alibi charge,\r\ncoupled with the remarks made by the solicitor during closing arguments, were\r\nprejudicial to the defendant because \"the absence of a charge on alibi gave rise to a\r\nconclusion by the jury that it was impermissible for them to consider the alibi\r\ndefense.\"). In this case, there is no doubt the State's closing argument gave the\r\nimpression that Petitioner bore some burden of proof on the issue of alibi, as the\r\nSolicitor referenced whether Petitioner could prove that he was at another place\r\nduring the crime. Moreover, the Solicitor went out of his way to disparage the\r\nalibi witnesses, referring to them as liars and suggesting that Petitioner's girlfriend\r\nwas high on drugs during her testimony.\r\n\r\n       During the PCR hearing, defense counsel stated he made a tactical decision\r\nto focus on the identification issues instead of the alibi evidence but that the law on\r\nalibi \"certainly should have been charged to the jury.\" In light of the\r\ncircumstantial nature of the State's case, the lack of overwhelming evidence\r\nproving Petitioner's guilt, and the State's disparagement of Petitioner's alibi\r\ntestimony, in my view defense counsel's rationale for failing to request the alibi\r\ninstruction was not reasonable under the circumstances. Therefore, I would find\r\nthe PCR court erred in finding Petitioner suffered no prejudice by his counsel's\r\nfailure to request an alibi instruction.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe instruction provided, absent an explicit instruction on the law of alibi, was\r\nsufficient to overcome the concerns outlined in Roseboro and present in this case.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27229","title":"Sparks v.

Fund c/o Walker, Hunter & Associates, Op. No. 2010-UP-525 (S.C. Ct.\r\nApp. filed Dec. 13, 2010), affirming the decision and order of the South Carolina\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission (the Commission)1 awarding Clifton Sparks\r\n(Petitioner) five hundred weeks of compensation for total and permanent disability\r\nbut denying him lifetime benefits because he did not suffer \"physical brain\r\ndamage\" within the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-10(C) (Supp. 2011) as a\r\nresult of a compensable injury. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                                       FACTS\r\nPalmetto Hardwood, Inc., employed Petitioner as a saw operator. Petitioner\r\nsuffered three work-related injuries during this employment, the first two of which\r\ninjured Petitioner's lower back. In the third incident, Petitioner was required to\r\nremove a piece of metal from under a gang saw. In the process, the metal\r\nexploded and a three- to four-inch cubic piece struck him in the head.\r\n\r\nPetitioner subsequently sought workers' compensation for his injuries. At the\r\nhearing, Petitioner testified to substantial head pain, loss of cognitive ability, and\r\nother brain-function-related symptoms, including inability to read without severe\r\nheadache, loss of his mathematical abilities, inability to balance while standing or\r\nto walk without a cane, hand tremors, anxiety, and more.\r\n\r\nSix doctors opined regarding whether Petitioner had suffered a physical brain\r\ninjury. Two opined that Petitioner might have suffered a mild brain injury as a\r\nresult of the work accident but that any difficulties resulting from it were\r\nintermingled with other problems, including pain and psychiatric disturbances.\r\nThree opined simply that Petitioner had suffered a physical brain injury. One\r\nopined that Petitioner had suffered no physical brain injury. The Commission\r\nfound that Petitioner had sustained a compensable injury to his head, including a\r\nmild concussion, but that his testimony relating to the extent of his brain injury was\r\n\r\n\r\n1We refer to both the Workers' Compensation Appellate Panel and the Workers'\r\nCompensation Full Commission as the Commission.\r\n\nnot credible and that the evidence failed to show that Petitioner had been dazed and\r\nconfused after his head injury or suffered nausea, vomiting, cognitive impairments,\r\nor post-concussive headaches. The Commission found both that Petitioner had\r\nsuffered a compensable injury to his head and that \"the claim for physical brain\r\ninjury borders on the frivolous.\" It also found him to be totally and permanently\r\ndisabled. The Commission ruled that Petitioner should receive only five hundred\r\nweeks of compensation as a result of his total and permanent disability and medical\r\nexpenses causally related to the three compensable injuries.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the circuit court remanded to the Commission for it (1) to explain\r\nwhether the \"physical brain injury\" it found \"border[ed] on the frivolous\" was\r\nintended to be the same as or different from \"physical brain damage\" as used in §\r\n42-9-10(C) and (2) to reconcile the order's seemingly contradictory findings that\r\nPetitioner suffered a compensable injury to the head with its finding of no physical\r\nbrain injury.\r\n\r\nOn remand, the Commission clarified that \"Claimaint has failed to carry his burden\r\nof proof to establish physical brain damage as contemplated by S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n42-9-10. Although Finding of Fact #7 above notes an injury-by-accident to the\r\nbrain, this does not constitute damage to the brain.\"\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the circuit court affirmed the Commission's order. Petitioner\r\nsubsequently appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed in an unpublished\r\nopinion. This Court granted certiorari. We now affirm.\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues that the Court of Appeals erred when it applied an improper\r\ndefinition of \"physical brain damage\" within the meaning of § 42-9-10(C). We\r\ndisagree.                           DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law. CFRE, LLC v. Greenville\r\nCounty Assessor, 395 S.C. 67, 74, 716 S.E.2d 877, 881 (2011). Further, \"[t]he\r\nconstruction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be\r\naccorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent\r\ncompelling reasons.\" Id. at 77, 716 S.E.2d at 882. However, if the agency's\r\ninterpretation conflicts with the statute's plain language, it must be rejected. Id.\r\n\nThe agency's interpretation of \"physical brain damage\" is clearly consonant with\r\nthe intent of the General Assembly as more fully discussed below.\r\n\r\n“The primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\nof the Legislature.” Gilstrap v. South Carolina Budget and Control Bd., 310 S.C.\r\n210, 213 (1992). “If the statute is ambiguous, . . . courts must construe the terms\r\nof the statute.” Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332, 342, 713 S.E.2d\r\n278, 283 (2011). “A statute as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and fair\r\ninterpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers. In\r\ninterpreting a statute, the language of the statute must be read in a sense that\r\nharmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.” Id.\r\n(citation omitted).\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-10(C) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n      Notwithstanding the five-hundred-week limitation prescribed in this\r\n      section or elsewhere in this title, any person determined to be totally\r\n      and permanently disabled who as a result of a compensable injury is a\r\n      paraplegic, a quadriplegic, or who has suffered physical brain damage\r\n      is not subject to the five-hundred-week limitation and shall receive the\r\n      benefits for life.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.) At issue in this case is the term \"physical brain damage.\"\r\n\"[W]ords in a statute must be construed in context.\" Southern Mut. Church Ins.\r\nCo. v. South Carolina Windstorm and Hail Underwriting Ass'n, 306 S.C. 339, 342,\r\n412 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1991). Thus, \"the Court may not, in order to give effect to\r\nparticular words, virtually destroy the meaning of the entire context; that is, give\r\nthe particular words a significance which would be clearly repugnant to the statute,\r\nlooked at as a whole, and destructive of its obvious intent.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe immediate context of the term \"physical brain damage\" suggests that the\r\nGeneral Assembly intended a more restrictive meaning than the most literal\r\ninterpretation as urged by Petitioner. Section 42-9-10(C) awards lifetime benefits\r\nfor totally disabled claimants suffering \"physical brain damage\" as an exception to\r\nthe normal five-hundred-week limitation along with only two other conditions:\r\nparaplegia and quadriplegia. Both of these conditions are by definition severe,\r\npermanent physical impairments. Thus, the context implies the General Assembly\r\n\nmeant to require severe, permanent impairment of normal brain function in order\r\nfor an injured worker to be deemed physically brain damaged under § 42-9-10(C).\r\n\r\nMoreover, within a single statutory scheme, the same word should be given\r\nconsistent meaning. Doe v. South Carolina Dept. of Health and Human Services,\r\n398 S.C. 62, 73 n.11, 727 S.E.2d 605, 611 n.11 (2011). Here, the General\r\nAssembly used the term \"brain damage\" only one other time in the workers'\r\ncompensation statutes, where it is included in a list of \"permanent physical\r\nimpairments.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-400(d) (Supp. 2011). Insofar as the term\r\n\"brain damage\" in § 42-9-400(d) is more clearly defined than it is in § 42-9-10(C),\r\nthat definition should inform our interpretation of the term \"brain damage\" in §42-\r\n9-10(C). We conclude, therefore, the General Assembly intended \"physical brain\r\ndamage\" in §42-9-10(C) to have a meaning consonant with § 42-9-400(d) of\r\npermanent physical damage to the brain.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we note that this interpretation is consistent with that of the\r\nCommission and thus affords proper deference to the agency. CFRE, LLC, supra.\r\n\r\nFinally, a definition of \"physical brain damage\" restricting it to severe permanent\r\ndamage appears to be consonant with the purpose of the workers' compensation\r\nstatutes to provide only minimal compensation. See Town of Mt. Pleasant, supra;\r\nWigfall v. Tideland Utilities, Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 115-16, 580 S.E.2d 100, 107-08\r\n(2003) (the purpose of the workers' compensation provisions is \"to provide a no-\r\nfault system focusing on quick recovery, relatively ascertainable awards and\r\nlimited litigation. In exchange for these benefits, the parties and society as a whole\r\nbear some costs\"; \"they are not designed to compensate the employee for his\r\ninjury, but merely to provide him with the bare minimum of income and medical\r\ncare to keep him from being a burden to others.\" (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\nSection 42-9-10(C) also requires that the damage be \"physical.\" \"Physical\" means\r\n\"[o]f or pertaining to the body, as distinguished from the mind or spirit; bodily\"\r\nand \"[o]f or pertaining to material things.\" American Heritage Dictionary 935\r\n(2nd College Ed. 1991). Nothing in the context of the statute suggests that this\r\nword should be interpreted otherwise. We thus decline to impose a requirement\r\nthat the damage be proved through an \"objective diagnostic medium,\" since some\r\nindisputably physical brain damage may not be revealed by diagnostic instruments\r\nthat can detect only relatively gross physical abnormalities.\r\n\nPetitioner also argues that the General Assembly's use of the verb phrase \"has\r\nsuffered\" indicates that the injury need not result in permanent damage, since this\r\nform of the verb requires no more than that the action—here \"suffered\"— occur at\r\nsome (indeterminate) point in the past. We disagree. The present perfect tense\r\nmay signify that the action occurred in the past but has continuing effects in the\r\npresent, began in the past and continues into the present or is completed in the\r\npresent, or is completed at the present time. See Commonwealth v. U.S. E.P.A.,\r\nNo. 96-4274, slip op. at 3 (6th Cir. Sept. 2, 1998), In re Gwynne P., 215 Ill.2d 340,\r\n357-58 (Ill. 2005); Schieffelin & Co. v.

The General\r\nAssembly's use of this tense is consistent with a finding that it intended \"physical\r\nbrain damage\" to denote damage that is permanent and therefore necessarily\r\ncontinues to have effect into the present.\r\n\r\nThus, we conclude that \"physical brain damage\" as used in § 42-9-10(C) is\r\nphysical brain damage that is both permanent and severe.\r\n\r\nAs to Petitioner's remaining issues, we find substantial evidence in the record to\r\nsupport the Commission's decision. See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135-36,\r\n276 S.E.2d 304, 306-07 (1981); Shealy v.

Menezes (Petitioner) argues that the court of\r\nappeals erred in its analysis of when a claim for breach of fiduciary duty accrues\r\nunder Delaware law. We disagree. The court of appeals performed a\r\nknowledgeable and perceptive analysis of the instant case. However, our review of\r\nDelaware law leads us to a different conclusion regarding the efficacy of\r\nPetitioner's claim. Thus, we affirm the court of appeals' decision in part, reverse in\r\npart, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n                         FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n       Petitioner served as the chief financial officer (CFO) and interim chief\r\nexecutive officer (CEO) of Safety Components International, Incorporated (SCI),\r\nfrom 1999 until 2006. SCI was a publicly traded Delaware company with its\r\nheadquarters and principal place of business located in Greenville, South Carolina.\r\nSCI designed and developed airbag fabric and airbag cushions. In 2005, SCI\r\npossessed a 66% share of the North American outsourced airbag cushion market,\r\nand an 11% share of the total North American airbag cushion market, along with a\r\n38% share of the European outsourced airbag cushion market, and a 16% share of\r\nthe total European airbag cushion market. In June 2006, SCI terminated Petitioner.\r\nPetitioner sued SCI, alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and violation of the\r\nSouth Carolina Payment of Wages Act. In addition, a short time after his\r\ntermination, Petitioner exercised his stock options and became an SCI shareholder.\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, the SCI board of directors (the SCI Board) entered into merger\r\nnegotiations with the former International Textile Group (FITG). WL Ross &\r\nCompany, LLC (Respondents), controlled both SCI and FITG. Respondents\r\ninclude a New York investment firm, specializing in leveraged restructurings,\r\nleveraged buyouts, and industry consolidations of financially distressed companies.\r\nRespondents owned approximately 75.6% of SCI and held four of the five seats on\r\nthe SCI Board. Respondents formed FITG in 2004 as a privately held Delaware\r\ncorporation with its headquarters and principal place of business in Greensboro,\r\nNorth Carolina. FITG consisted of four principle lines of business: apparel fabrics,\r\n\ninterior furnishings, government uniform fabrics, and specialty fabrics and\r\nservices. Respondents owned 85.4% of FITG and held five of the six seats on the\r\nFITG board of directors (the FITG Board).\r\n\r\n       On August 29, 2006, the SCI Board approved the merger agreement between\r\nSCI and FITG. The SCI Board publicly announced the terms of the merger on\r\nAugust 30, 2006, with the filing of a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange\r\nCommission (SEC). On September 1, 2006, the SCI Board filed a Joint Proxy\r\nStatement/Prospectus, also known as a Form S-4, with the SEC. The Form S-4\r\nprovided shareholders with details of the merger between SCI and FITG. The\r\nForm S-4 explained that shares of FITG common stock would be converted into\r\nthe right to receive shares of SCI common stock at an exchange ratio of one share\r\nof SCI common stock for every 1.4739 shares of FITG common stock. The Form\r\nS-4 also explained that as a precondition of the merger, SCI would have to adopt\r\nan amended certificate of incorporation reflecting the newly merged company.\r\nHowever, this precondition was a mere formality, as shareholders owning 75.6%\r\nof the company, i.e. Respondents, indicated they intended to adopt such a\r\ncertificate and re-elect their directors to the SCI Board. According to the Form S-\r\n4, completion of the merger did not require any further action by SCI shareholders,\r\nbut FITG shareholders would have to approve the merger. However, Respondents\r\nowned 86.4% of FITG's stock and consented in writing to the merger at the time of\r\nthe Form S-4's issuance. The Form S-4 also provided shareholders with\r\ninformation regarding the 2006 Annual Meeting where the merger would be\r\nformally finalized. It is clear from the Form S-4, that due to Respondent's\r\nownership role in SCI and FITG, the planned procedures at the 2006 Annual\r\nMeeting were a formality.\r\n\r\n       The more intricate details of the merger are not pertinent to our analysis.\r\nHowever, Petitioner argues that Respondents breached their fiduciary duty to SCI's\r\nshareholders by approving merger terms which were unfair to SCI shareholders,\r\nfailing to conduct due diligence regarding the financial condition of FITG, and\r\nfailing to protect SCI's minority shareholders.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Petitioner alleged that Respondents violated their fiduciary duties by:\r\n\r\n         (a) proposing the [m]erger and then allowing it to close \n\r\n             notwithstanding the financial condition of FITG; \n\r\n\n      On September 28, 2006, Petitioner and SCI resolved the termination suit and\r\nexecuted a Settlement Agreement and Release (the Release). The Release\r\nextinguished all of Petitioner's claims against SCI:\r\n\r\n      As a material inducement to Employer to enter into this Confidential\r\n      Settlement Agreement, [Petitioner] does hereby release, acquit and\r\n      forever discharge . . . from any and all manner of actions, causes of\r\n\r\n      (b) approving the [m]erger on terms which gave 65% ownership to the\r\n          FITG stockholders and diluted the minority shareholders to 35%,\r\n          or at all [sic];\r\n\r\n      (c) not providing accurate and complete information regarding FITG .\r\n          . . or ensuring that such information was provided;\r\n\r\n      (d) failing to learn of the financial situation of FITG and failing to take\r\n          it into account or see that it was taken into account with regard to\r\n          the [m]erger;\r\n\r\n      (e) failing to ensure that proper due diligence was conducted on behalf\r\n          of SCI or FITG;\r\n\r\n      (f) allowing the representation at the [m]erger closing that the\r\n          [material adverse change] [c]lause condition was satisfied;\r\n\r\n      (g) failing to call off or renegotiate the [m]erger (or caus[ing] it to be\r\n          called off or renegotiated) because of the financial condition of\r\n          FITG;\r\n\r\n      (h) allowing the debt previously held by FITG to be transferred to\r\n          Combined Company and/or by allowing that debt to be converted\r\n          into preferred stock;\r\n\r\n      (i) allowing or causing the renegotiation [of] the SCI's credit facility\r\n          and/or obtaining $100 million of additional preferred stock in\r\n          connection therewith; and/or\r\n\r\n      (j) otherwise failing to protect the interests of the minority\r\n          stockholders of SCI.\r\n\n      action, suits, claims, setoffs, debts, compensation, salary, benefits,\r\n      sums of money, accounts, covenants, trespasses, damages, judgments\r\n      and demands whatsoever, in law or in equity, whether known or\r\n      unknown, liquidated, contingent, absolute, or otherwise, which\r\n      [Petitioner] either has had or now has against [Respondents] for or\r\n      related to any matter or things whatsoever from the beginning of time\r\n      up to and including the date of execution hereof. It is [Petitioner's]\r\n      intention to release all rights and claims that he may lawfully release.\r\n\r\n      The Release specifically barred Petitioner from bringing any claim as an\r\nowner of any stock or interest arising prior to the Release's execution and from\r\npursuing any claims made, or that could have been made, in his employment\r\nlawsuit.\r\n\r\n      On October 20, 2006, SCI and FITG completed their merger, creating the\r\nnew International Textile Group (NITG). On April 9, 2008, Petitioner sued\r\nRespondents alleging breach of fiduciary duties. Respondents asserted the\r\naffirmative defense that the Release barred Petitioner's claim, moved for summary\r\njudgment, and asserted a counterclaim for breach of the Release. On July 31,\r\n2008, the parties appeared before the trial court on this motion.\r\n\r\n       The parties agreed that this case presented a single issue of law: \"[W]hen did\r\nthe claims alleged in [Petitioner's] complaint accrue under Delaware law.\"\r\nRespondents asserted that, under Delaware law, a cause of action for breach of\r\nfiduciary duty accrues \"when the wrong occurs,\" and in the merger context, this\r\nwrong occurs when a merger's terms are fixed. In this case, because Respondents\r\ncontrolled both SCI and FITG, the merger's terms were fixed when the SCI Board\r\napproved the merger. Under Respondents' view of Delaware law, the SCI Board\r\nfixed the merger terms prior to execution of the Release, thus barring Petitioner's\r\nclaim.Petitioner countered that the alleged wrong could not have occurred prior to\r\nwhen he could make a claim for damages. Accordingly, Petitioner argues that\r\nunder Delaware law, a claim for breach of fiduciary duty cannot accrue until the\r\nmerger is officially closed by vote of the company shareholders. Petitioner also\r\nfocused on damages, and the general rule that a cause of action for the recovery of\r\ndamages only accrues when the action can be prosecuted to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\n\n      The trial court agreed that Petitioner's claims accrued no earlier than the\r\nclosing of the merger. The trial court denied Respondents' motion for summary\r\njudgment, struck their affirmative defenses based on the Release, and dismissed\r\nRespondents' counterclaim for breach of the Release.\r\n\r\n      Respondents appealed and the court of appeals reversed. Menezes v. WL\r\nRoss & Co. LLC, 392 S.C. 584, 709 S.E.2d 114 (Ct. App. 2011). The court of\r\nappeals noted the recent trend in Delaware law favoring the view that a claim for\r\nbreach of fiduciary duty accrues as soon as the wrongful act occurs, and that\r\nwhether or not a plaintiff can sue for damages is not dispositive because a plaintiff\r\ncan seek injunctive relief. Id. at 593, 709 S.E.2d at 119 (citing with approval\r\nAlbert v. Alex Brown Mgmt. Servs. Inc., No. 762–N, 2005 WL 1594085, at *18\r\n(Del. Ch. 2005)). Thus, the court of appeals held the trial court erred by relying\r\non case law distinguishable from the latest Delaware decisions. Id. at 595, 709\r\nS.E.2d at 120 (\"After reviewing the facts sub judice and all the relevant case law,\r\nwe conclude the circuit court's reliance . . . was misplaced.\").\r\n\r\n      Petitioner sought review from this Court, and we granted certiorari.\r\n\r\n                                 ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n\r\n      Did the court of appeals err in reversing the circuit court's holding that\r\n      Petitioner's claims accrued at the close of the merger?\r\n\r\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       The question of when a cause of action arises or accrues is a question of law.\r\nStephens v. Draffin, 327 S.C. 1, 5, 488 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1997); Brown v. Finger,\r\n240 S.C. 102, 111–12, 124 S.E.2d 781, 785–86 (1962). This Court undertakes a de\r\nnovo review of all issues of law, and is free to decide matters of law with no\r\nparticular deference to the trial court. Fields v. J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc.,\r\n376 S.C. 545, 564, 658 S.E.2d 80, 90 (2008).2\r\n\r\n2 Delaware law controls the question of the accrual date as claims concerning the\r\nfiduciary duties of corporate officers are governed by the state of incorporation.\r\nMenezes, 392 S.C. at 589–90, 709 S.E.2d at 117 (relying on Restatement (First) of\r\nConflicts of Laws § 187 (1934)). \"Generally, the rights and obligations of\r\nstockholders, including the relative rights of stockholders as respects the\r\ncorporation itself, are determined and controlled by the law of the state of\r\nincorporation.\" Id. at 590, 709 S.E.2d at 117 (quoting 18 Am.Jur.2d Corporations\r\n\n                                   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n                            I.   Fiduciary Duty Defined\r\n\r\n      Resolution of Petitioner's claim requires a brief description of Delaware law\r\nregarding the fiduciary duties of corporate directors and officers.\r\n\r\n       Under Delaware law, the duties of a fiduciary are composed of three\r\nelements: care, loyalty, and good faith. Hillary Sale, Enron and the Future of U.S.\r\nCorporate Law and Policy, 89 Cornell L. Rev. 456, 463 (2004). Directors and\r\nofficers who comply with the duty of care are more likely to weigh decisions,\r\nconsult with appropriate advisors, and disclose conflicts of interest. Id. at 465.\r\nCourts monitor the duty of care through the business judgment rule, which\r\ndelegates the business affairs of Delaware corporations to the board of directors.\r\nId. \"The business judgment rule presumes that in making decisions and managing\r\nthe corporation, fiduciaries have acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in\r\nthe honest belief that the action taken was in the best interest of the company.\" Id.\r\n(quoting Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805, 812 (Del. 1984)). In Smith v. Van\r\nGorkom, 488 A.2d 858, 893 (Del. 1985),3 the Delaware Supreme Court held that\r\ncorporate directors cannot create a \"safe harbor\" for their decisions by simply\r\nsecuring shareholder approval. Id.\r\n\r\n        The duty of loyalty requires corporate officers and directors act in the best\r\ninterest of the corporation and prioritize the corporation's interest above their own.\r\nId. at 483. The traditional formulation of the duty of loyalty states that if corporate\r\ndirectors and officers are independent of, and disinterested in, the complained of\r\ntransaction, the court will not find them liable for a breach of that duty, unless the\r\nfacts of the transaction are \"such that no person could possibly authorize it if he or\r\nshe were attempting in good faith to meet their duty.\" Id. at 484–85 (citing\r\nGagliardi v. Trifoods Int'l Inc., 683 A.2d 1049, 1053 (Del. Ch. 1996)).\r\n\r\n§ 21). South Carolina courts generally follow the traditional choice of law rules as\r\nstated in the Restatement of Conflicts of Laws. Id. (citing McDaniel v. McDaniel,\r\n243 S.C. 286, 292, 133 S.E.2d 809, 813 (1963)).\r\n3Overruled on other grounds by Gantler v. Stephens, 965 A.2d 695, 713 n.54 (Del.\r\n2009) (articulating the proper scope of the shareholder ratification doctrine); see\r\nalso Emerald Partners v. Berlin, 787 A.2d 85, 90 (Del. 2001) (recognizing that\r\npart of Van Gorkom's holding has been superseded by statute).\r\n\n        Finally, corporate directors and officers acting in good faith abide by the\r\nnorms of corporate governance and comply with legal standards while performing\r\ntheir jobs. Id. at 485. Egregious or conspicuous failures to do so are subject to\r\nliability under the duty of good faith. Id. For example, directors must ensure that\r\ncomplaints about the company are sufficiently investigated. Id. Officers must\r\ncreate appropriate systems within the company to ensure proper governance, and\r\nmaterial decisions must be supported by all reasonably available facts. Id.; see\r\nalso Robert Summers, The General Duty of Good Faith—It's Recognition and\r\nConceptualization, 67 Cornell L. Rev. 810, 811 (1982) (\"[A]lthough the general\r\nduty of good faith and fair dealing is no more than a minimal requirement (rather\r\nthan a high ideal), its relevance . . . is peculiarly wide-ranging, and it rules out\r\nmany varieties of bad faith in a diverse array of contexts.\").\r\n\r\n       In our view, Delaware courts focus on the possible injury created by\r\ncorporate directors' failure to adhere to their duties, apart and aside from any after\r\nthe fact ratification or approval by corporate shareholders.\r\n\r\n       In his brief before this Court, Petitioner states unequivocally that \"under\r\nDelaware law, a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the directors or officers\r\nof a corporation sounds in tort.\" Petitioner is incorrect.\r\n\r\n      A recent commentary, upon which Petitioner relies, discussed this point:\r\n\r\n      After a brief flirtation with the earlier theories that breaches of\r\n      fiduciary duty arose in contract, a strong majority view emerged that\r\n      characterized breaches of fiduciary duty as tort claims. For example,\r\n      in the part of the country that was ground zero for the savings and\r\n      loan crisis, courts consistently held that claims for breach of fiduciary\r\n      duty against corporate fiduciaries were tort claims.\r\n\r\nJ. Travis Laster, Michelle D. Morris, Breaches of Fiduciary Duty and the\r\nDelaware Uniform Contribution Act, 11 Del. L. Rev. 71, 92–93 (2010). However,\r\nPetitioner failed to include in his brief the article's subsequent paragraph. That\r\nparagraph is critical to understanding the article's intended point:\r\n\r\n      As a result of these authorities, there is now a large body of case law\r\n      outside of Delaware that treats a claim for breach of fiduciary duty\r\n      against corporate directors as a tort. These decisions do not make\r\n      fine distinctions between \"legal\" or \"equitable\" torts, nor do they\r\n\n      delve into the nuances of the equitable underpinnings of the\r\n      relationship. They simply hold that a breach of fiduciary duty is a\r\n      tort. The natural consequence of such an approach is that contribution\r\n      under the Uniform Act would exist, unless a state has adopted the\r\n      provision from the 1955 revision excluding breaches of fiduciary duty\r\n      from its coverage. Delaware's approach to fiduciary duties,\r\n      however, is not so simple.\r\n\r\nId. at 93 (emphasis added). The Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Cede &\r\nCo. v. Technicolor Inc., 634 A.2d 345 (Del. 1993), assists in understanding the\r\nreasoning behind the Delaware courts' position.\r\n\r\n        The Technicolor chronicle spans twenty years of litigation and six remands\r\nby the Delaware Supreme Court. Laster, 11 Del. L. Rev. at 94 n.130. The\r\npertinent issue flows from an appraisal proceeding brought by Cinerama,\r\nIncorporated (Cinerama) following the acquisition of Technicolor, Incorporated\r\n(Technicolor). See Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 542 A.2d 1182, 1184 (Del.\r\n1988) (analyzing an interlocutory appeal regarding, inter alia, a shareholder's right\r\nto maintain an action for fraud in connection with the merger as well as appraisal\r\naction). Cinerama developed evidence that it believed supported a claim that the\r\nTechnicolor directors breached their duties of loyalty and care, and filed an action\r\nasserting this claim. Id. The trial court first ruled on the terms of the appraisal,4\r\nand then issued a separate opinion addressing the fiduciary duty claim. The trial\r\ncourt held that even if the directors failed to exercise due care, the plaintiffs bore\r\nthe burden to establish causation and damages. Cinerama, Inc. v. Technicolor,\r\nInc., Civ. A. No. 83581991, 1991 WL 111134, at *3–4 (Del. Ch. June 24, 1991)\r\n(\"But I am of the view that the questions of due care . . . need not be addressed in\r\nthis case, because even if a lapse of care is assumed, plaintiff is not entitled to a\r\njudgment on this record. That is because in this situation, where there is no self-\r\ndealing or other breach of loyalty, it is plaintiff's burden to establish by evidence\r\nthat it was injured as a result of the board's action. This it has not done.\").\r\n\r\n      Cinerama appealed, and the Delaware Supreme Court reversed.\r\nTechnicolor, 634 A.2d at 370. The court held that tort principles did not control a\r\nclaim for breach of fiduciary duty, and that these principles \"have no place in a\r\nbusiness judgment rule standard of review analysis.\" Id. at 370. The Delaware\r\nSupreme Court's decision in Technicolor represents the last significant discussion\r\n\r\n4See Cede Co. v. Technicolor Inc., Civ. A. No. 7129, 1990 WL 161084, at *1 (Del.\r\nCh. Oct. 19, 1990).\r\n\namong Delaware courts regarding the proper characterization of breach of\r\nfiduciary duty claims. Laster, 11 Del. L. Rev. at 96. However, later cases follow\r\nTechnicolor in treating a breach of fiduciary duty claim as distinct from common\r\nlaw tort or contract claims. Id. (citing North Am. Catholic Educ. Programming\r\nFound., Inc. v. Gheewalla, 930 A.2d 92, 103 n.43 (Del. 2007); IM2 Merch. and\r\nMfg., Inc. v. Tirex Corp., No. CIV.A.18077, 2000 WL 1664168, at *6 (Del. Ch.\r\nNov. 2, 2000) (\"Plaintiffs' claim is really one based on contract or tort law, rather\r\nthan the law of fiduciary duty.\")).\r\n\r\n        The Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Technicolor surprised\r\ncommentators previously under the assumption that a breach of fiduciary duty was\r\na tort, especially in light of the majority of jurisdictions outside of Delaware that\r\nclassify the breach in this way. Id. at 97–98. However, it is clear that while a\r\nbreach of fiduciary duty may \"look, swim, or quack like a tort,\" under Delaware\r\nlaw, it is not. See id. at 98 (citing McMillan v. Intercargo Corp., 768 A.2d 492,\r\n506 n.62 (Del. Ch. 2000) (using the \"duck\" analogy in determining which\r\ncontractual merger provisions with defensive impacts would be reviewed as\r\ndefensive measures)); see also Bovay v. H.M. Byllesby & Co., 38 A.2d 808, 820\r\n(1944) (holding that where corporate officers and directors are required to answer\r\nfor enriching themselves through injury to the corporation, the court would \"not\r\nregard such acts as mere torts, but as serious breaches of trust\").\r\n\r\n       The foregoing authority provides clarity on two points important to the\r\nresolution of the instant case. First, Delaware courts generally focus on the\r\ncorporate directors' actual breach of fiduciary duty, as an injury, regardless of\r\nwhether that breach causes separate damage. Second, Delaware courts do not\r\nconsider a breach of fiduciary duty a mere tort, but instead as its own distinct cause\r\nof action. This perspective comports with the very existence of Delaware's\r\ndeferential business judgment rule, and robust business court regime. Treating\r\nmalfeasance by corporate directors and officers as torts would represent a\r\nsignificant incongruity with the rationale behind Delaware's Chancery Court\r\nsystem.5\r\n\r\n\r\n5 The Delaware Chancery Court is widely recognized as the nation's preeminent\r\nforum for the determination of disputes involving the internal affairs of the\r\nthousands of corporations and business entities conducting a vast amount of the\r\nworld's commercial affairs. Delaware State Courts,\r\nhttp://courts.delaware.gov/chancery/ (last visited Jan. 27, 2013); see also Rick\r\nGeisenberger, The Delaware Corporation Franchise Tax, 30 Del. Law. 18, 19\r\n\n                        II.   The Claim Accrual Narrative\r\n\r\n       The parties have constructed a battle royale between what appears to be two\r\ncompeting lines of cases explaining when a claim for breach of fiduciary duty\r\naccrues under Delaware law. However, these competing cases are best viewed as\r\ntwo subsets representing different eras in a continuing narrative of the Delaware\r\ncourt's evolution on claim accrual in the fiduciary duty context. The Delaware\r\nSupreme Court's controversial decision in Van Gorkom stands as a dividing line\r\nbetween that subset of cases holding that a claim for breach of fiduciary duty\r\naccrues only after a party is injured in the form of actual damages, and the later\r\nsubset that view the breach itself as sufficient injury to support a claim. Thus, we\r\nanalyze the authority pertinent to the instant case in three sections: pre-Van\r\nGorkom authority,6 the Van Gorkom decision, and post-Van Gorkom authority.7\r\n\r\n    A. Pre-Van Gorkom\r\n\r\n       In Kaufman v. Albin, 447 A.2d 761 (Del. Ch. 1982), Turner & Newell\r\nIndustries, Incorporated (Turner), proposed a tender offer for the shares of stock of\r\nPhillip A. Hunt Chemical Corporation (Hunt). Hunt's board of directors (the Hunt\r\nBoard) voted unanimously to recommend to all Hunt stockholders that they accept\r\nthe offer and tender their shares to Turner. Id. at 762. However, the Hunt Board\r\nsubsequently considered the ramifications of the proposed offer on certain\r\n\r\n\r\n(2012) (\"[O]ur Court of Chancery is a unique, centuries-old business court that,\r\nalong with the Delaware Supreme Court, has authored most of the modern U.S.\r\ncorporate case law.\"); John F.

Rev. 1915, 1915 (2012) (arguing that business courts do not\r\nserve to attract companies from other states because, inter alia, those courts are\r\nunlikely to successfully compete with the Delaware Chancery Court).\r\n6The line of cases cited in the trial court's order: Baron v. Allied Artists Pictures\r\nCorp., 717 F.2d 105 (3rd Cir. 1983); Dofflemeyer v. W.F. Hall Printing Co., 558 F.\r\nSupp. 372 (D. Del. 1983); Kaufman v. Albin, 447 A.2d 761 (Del. Ch. 1982).\r\n7 The line of cases relied on by the court of appeals in reversing the trial court's\r\norder: Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Coca-Cola Co., 954 A.2d 910 (Del. 2008);\r\nKahn v. Seaboard Corp., 625 A.2d 269 (Del. Ch. 1993); Brown v. Automated\r\nMktg. Sys., Inc., No. 6715, 1982 WL 8782, at *1 (Del. Ch. Mar. 22, 1982).\r\n\nunexercised stock options held by Hunt employees, including officers. Id. The\r\nHunt Board decided to avoid certain profit charges by accelerating the option date\r\nof all options held by non-officer employees. Id. The Hunt Board allowed\r\ncorporate officers the opportunity to cancel their options and receive the difference\r\nbetween the option price and the tender officer price. Id. The Hunt Board adopted\r\nthese decisions by resolution on August 22, 1977. Id. However, the resolutions\r\nwere contingent upon Turner's actual commencement of the tender offer. Id. The\r\ntender offer began on September 12, 1977, and was consummated on October 3,\r\n1977. Id. The plaintiffs contended that the directors wasted corporate assets by\r\npermitting corporate officers to surrender their options in connection with the\r\ntender offer. Id.\r\n\r\n      A primary issue in Kaufman was the date the cause of action arose. The\r\ndefendants argued that the action arose on August 22, 1977, the date the Hunt\r\nBoard took action. Id. at 763. The plaintiffs countered that the wrong did not\r\noccur until October 3, 1977, the date the tender offer ended, and that until the\r\ntender offer's actual completion, no injury could have occurred. Id.\r\n\r\n       The trial court agreed with the plaintiffs, relying on precedent stating that\r\nwhen exchanges of stock are contingent upon shareholder approval, the transaction\r\nis not complete until the shareholder vote takes place. Id. at 764 (citing Lavine v.\r\nGulf Coast Leaseholds, 122 A.2d 550 (Del. Ch. 1956); Folk, The Delaware\r\nGeneral Corporation Law, 487 (1967)). According to the trial court, the wrong\r\n\"was a continuing wrong.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       In Dofflemyer v. W.F. Hall Printing Company, 558 F. Supp. 372 (D. Del.\r\n1983), the United States District Court for the District of Delaware analyzed the\r\ndefendant's motion to dismiss a derivative action brought by Robert and Josephine\r\nDofflemyer (the plaintiffs) against W.F. Hall Printing Company's board of\r\ndirectors (the defendants) in connection with a merger of W.F. Hall Printing\r\nCompany and a second tier subsidiary of Mobil Corporation. Id. at 375. The\r\nplaintiffs claimed that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by engineering\r\na merger that served no valid business purpose but benefited the majority\r\nshareholders' interests. Id. at 379. Allegedly, the defendants obtained an\r\ninvestment opinion from a banking firm they knew not to be independent,\r\nmaneuvered to avoid provisions in the bylaws intended to protect minority\r\nshareholders, and issued a false and misleading proxy statement. Id.\r\n\r\n       The parties disputed when the statute of limitations began to run on the\r\nplaintiffs' claim. Relying on Kaufman, the district court held that the plaintiffs\r\n\ncould not have sued for damages until the merger was \"actually accomplished.\" Id.\r\nAccording to the court, until that time, the plaintiffs had suffered no injury as a\r\nresult of the defendants' acts. Id.\r\n\r\n       Later that same year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third\r\nCircuit issued its decision in Baron v. Allied Artists Pictures Corporation, 717 F.2d\r\n105 (3rd Cir. 1983). In that case, John Baron, a stockholder in Allied Artists\r\nPictures Corporation (Allied Pictures), appealed a summary judgment decision\r\ndismissing his complaint as time-barred. Id. at 106. Baron sought damages and\r\ndeclaratory relief concerning a merger between Allied Pictures and Allied\r\nIndustries consummated on January 20, 1976. Baron alleged that the proxy\r\nsolicitations, dated November 24, 1975, were false and misleading. Id. Baron\r\nfiled his complaint on January 19, 1979. Id.\r\n\r\n       The Delaware district court had consistently recognized the principle that the\r\nstatute of limitations begins to run from the date of the injury caused by the\r\ndefendant. Id. (citing Rose Hall, Ltd. v. Chase Manhattan Overseas Bank, 494 F.\r\nSupp. 1139, 1157 (D. Del. 1980), Oliver B. Cannon & Son, Inc. v. Fidelity &\r\nCasualty Co., 484 F. Supp. 1375, 1388 (D. Del. 1980); Freedman v. Beneficial\r\nCorp., 406 F. Supp. 917, 922 (D. Del. 1975)). Thus, the district court held that\r\nBarron's complaint fell outside of Delaware's three year statute of limitations. Id.\r\nat 107.The Third Circuit reversed, relying on precedent recognizing the general\r\nprinciple that a cause of action for the recovery of damages accrues only when it\r\ncould be prosecuted to a successful conclusion. Id. at 108 (citing United States v.\r\nWurts, 303 U.S. 414, 418 (1938); Grayson v. Harris, 279 U.S. 300, 304–05 (1929);\r\nCity of Philadelphia v. Lieberman, 112 F.2d 424, 428 (3d Cir. 1940)). The Third\r\nCircuit did not view Baron's injury as having taken place at the time of the actual\r\nbreach:\r\n\r\n      Had Baron filed his complaint seeking money damages caused by\r\n      anticipated use of the proxies in consummation of the merger, that\r\n      complaint would properly have been dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n      12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which money damages could\r\n      be awarded. Until the plaintiff can allege facts which would survive\r\n      such a motion, his cause of action for damages, personal or derivative,\r\n      has not accrued. Until it has accrued the statute of limitations does\r\n      not come into operation.\r\n\nId. at 109; but see Brown v. Automated Mktg. Sys., No. 6715, 1982 WL 8782, at *2\r\n(Del. Ch. Mar. 22, 1982) (\"Nor can there be an argument that no wrong occurs\r\nuntil the merger is voted upon and approved. The transaction of which she\r\ncomplains is the act of Automated's board in passing a resolution approving the\r\nmerger on terms which she feels to be unfair to the public shareholders.\"); FMC\r\nCorp. v. R.P. Scherer Corp., 1982 WL 17888, at *2 (Del. Ch. Aug. 6, 1982) (\"In\r\nthis case, FMC wants to contest what the Directors . . . approved and were\r\nsubmitting to the stockholders for approval. Why should FMC be heard to\r\ncomplain about what they bought? The Proxy Statement had been public for 16\r\ndays.\").\r\n\r\n      In our view, prior to the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Van Gorkom,\r\nthere was a fractured view among Delaware courts regarding the point at which a\r\nclaim for breach of fiduciary duty accrues.8 Therefore, some of these decisions\r\nlend support to Petitioner's argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8However, in Brambles USA, Inc. v. Blocker, 731 F. Supp. 643 (D. Del. 1990), the\r\nDelaware district court distinguished the tender offer of Kaufman from a fixed\r\ncontract situation like that in the instant case:\r\n      For similar reasons, Brambles' reliance on Kaufman is misplaced. In\r\n      that case, until the requisite number of shareholders tendered pursuant\r\n      to the tender offer there was no transaction. As the Court said, until\r\n      that time the transaction complained of was subject to extinction. The\r\n      resolutions of the board in Kaufman were simply not binding until it\r\n      was consummated by the shareholders tendering the requisite number\r\n      of shares into the tender offer. In the case sub judice, the merger in\r\n      May, 1988, fixed the method of payment. That it may have provided\r\n      an alternative method of payment does not mean that the\r\n      Exchange/Put Agreement and the Merger Agreement were not\r\n      binding on the parties. Thus it was not a resolution as in Kaufman;\r\n      rather, it was a fixed contract.\r\nId. at 650 (internal citations omitted). Thus, the Brambles and FMC Corp.\r\ndecisions support a plausible view that Delaware courts have consistently held that\r\na breach of fiduciary duty claim accrues at the time a merger's terms are fixed, and\r\nthat a tender offer, like that in Kaufman, is a distinct situation for accrual analysis\r\npurposes.\r\n\n   B. The Van Gorkom decision\r\n\r\n      As discussed, supra, the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Technicolor\r\nexplained that tort principles do not belong in the analysis of a breach of fiduciary\r\nduty under Delaware law. See Technicolor, 634 A.2d at 370. We view the\r\nTechnicolor decision as a natural extension of the Delaware Supreme Court's\r\nsweeping opinion in Van Gorkom.\r\n\r\n      In Van Gorkom, the shareholders of Trans Union Corporation (Trans Union)\r\nbrought a class action seeking rescission of a cash-out merger of Trans Union into\r\nNew T Company (New T), a wholly owned subsidiary of Marmon Group,\r\nIncorporated. 488 A.2d 858, 863.\r\n\r\n       In August 1980, Trans Union CEO Jerome Van Gorkom began discussions\r\nwith Trans Union senior management to discuss the possibility of selling Trans\r\nUnion due to the company's inability to generate sufficient income. Id. at 865.\r\nVan Gorkom decided to meet with Jay Pritzker, a corporate takeover specialist. Id.\r\nat 866. However, prior to the meeting, and without consulting with Trans Union's\r\nboard of directors (the Trans Union Board), Van Gorkom calculated, along with\r\nthe CFO, an estimated price for Trans Union at $55 per share. Id. On September\r\n13, 1980, Van Gorkom met with Pritzker and presented a plan for Pritzker to\r\npurchase Trans Union at $55 per share and \"pay off most of the loan in the first\r\nfive years.\" Id. Pritzker expressed interest in Van Gorkom's offer, and the two\r\nbegan a series of secret meetings on September 17 and 18. Id. at 867. Pritzker and\r\nVan Gorkom agreed that a merger would occur, and that the Trans Union Board\r\nneeded to act on the merger proposal no later than September 21. Id. On\r\nSeptember 19, Van Gorkom consulted with Trans Union's bank regarding\r\nfinancing and retained an outside attorney, instead of Trans Union's legal staff, to\r\nadvise him on the merger. Id. On that same day, Van Gorkom called a special\r\nmeeting of the Trans Union Board for September 20. Id. On September 20, Van\r\nGorkom provided the Trans Union Board with a thirty-minute presentation on the\r\nmerger. Id. at 868. The meeting lasted approximately two hours, and based solely\r\non Van Gorkom's short oral presentation, the Trans Union Board approved the\r\nmerger. Id. at 869. On September 22, Trans Union issued a press release\r\nannouncing the definitive agreement. Id. On December 19, a shareholder\r\ncommenced class action litigation. Id. at 870. On February 10, Trans Union\r\nstockholders approved the merger. Id.\r\n\n       The trial court found that the Trans Union Board's conduct was not reckless\r\nor improvident, but informed. Id. at 871. The trial court held that the Trans Union\r\nBoard was free to turn down Pritzker's offer, and that the parties did not reach a\r\nlegally binding offer until after the Trans Union Board had been informed of the\r\nmerger terms. Id. However, the plaintiffs maintained on appeal that the initial\r\ndecision to accept the $55 per share offer was not informed. Id. The Delaware\r\nSupreme Court agreed.\r\n\r\n        The Delaware Supreme Court found that the Trans Union Board's decision\r\nto sell the company to Pritzker was not an informed business judgment:\r\n\r\n      The directors (1) did not adequately inform themselves as to Van\r\n      Gorkom's role in forcing the \"sale\" of the Company and in\r\n      establishing the per share purchase price; (2) were uninformed as to\r\n      the intrinsic value of the Company; and (3) given these circumstances,\r\n      at a minimum, were grossly negligent in approving the \"sale\" of the\r\n      Company upon two hours' consideration, without prior notice, and\r\n      without the exigency of a crisis or emergency.\r\n\r\nId. at 874. Thus, the court concluded that the Trans Union Board was grossly\r\nnegligent in failing to act with informed reasonable deliberation in agreeing to the\r\nmerger proposal on September 20. Id. at 882, 893 (\"We hold, therefore, that the\r\nTrial Court committed reversible error in applying the business judgment rule in\r\nfavor of the director defendants in this case.\"). Additionally, the court held that the\r\nTrans Union Board could be held liable for the fair value of the plaintiffs' shares on\r\nSeptember 20. Id. at 893.\r\n\r\n       The Van Gorkom decision caused widespread angst about the personal\r\nculpability of corporate directors. See Sale, 89 Cornell L. Rev. at 466. The\r\nDelaware General Assembly swiftly amended the Delaware General Corporation\r\nLaw to allow for an optional charter provision to exculpate directors for violating\r\nthe duty of care. Id. This charter provision may only be proposed by directors and\r\nonce approved by shareholders, may only be removed by directors. Id. In\r\naddition, several judicial decisions have chipped away at Van Gorkom's breadth.\r\nSee, e.g., Gantler, 965 A.2d at 713 n.54 (holding that scope of the common law\r\nshareholder ratification doctrine encompasses only those director actions that do\r\nnot legally require shareholder approval and overruling Van Gorkom to the extent\r\nit held otherwise); Emerald Partners, 787 A.2d at 90 (\"The purpose of Section\r\n102(b)(7) was to permit shareholders . . . to adopt a provision in the certificate of\r\nincorporation to exculpate directors from any personal liability for the payment of\r\n\nmonetary damages for breaches of their duty of care, but not for duty of loyalty\r\nviolations, good faith violations and certain other conduct.\" (emphasis in original)).\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, an essential point from Van Gorkom remains good law: A\r\ncorporate board violates its fiduciary duty when it approves a merger or other\r\ncorporate act inconsistent with the duty of care, loyalty, or good faith, and this act\r\ngives rise to a cause of action regardless of later shareholder approval. Delaware\r\ncases following Van Gorkom illustrate this principle.\r\n\r\n   C. Post-Van Gorkom\r\n\r\n       In Dieter v. Prime Computer, 681 A.2d 1068 (Del. Ch. 1996), Prime\r\nComputer, Incorporated (Prime) was a Delaware corporation with its offices in\r\nMassachusetts. D.R. Holdings, Incorporated (Holdings), a Delaware corporation,\r\nformed two wholly owned subsidiaries: Acquisition and DR Merger, Inc. (DR\r\nMerger), to acquire Prime. Id. at 1069. On June 23, 1989, the Prime board of\r\ndirectors (the Prime Board) approved a merger between Prime and Acquisition and\r\nDR Merger. Id. at 1070. The Prime Board announced the merger agreement on\r\nAugust 4, 1989. The plaintiffs, Prime shareholders, challenged the merger's terms\r\nand filed a motion for class certification against Prime, Acquisition, and DR\r\nMerger (collectively, the defendants). Id. at 1072. The defendants challenged the\r\nplaintiffs as appropriate representatives of the class and asserted that the plaintiffs\r\nfailed the \"typicality\" requirement. Id. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs\r\ndid not have a claim typical to other class members because \"they purchased all of\r\ntheir shares of Prime stock between October 23, 1989 and December 12, 1989,\"\r\nwell after the Prime Board announced the merger on August 4, 1989. Id.\r\n\r\n      The trial court agreed:\r\n\r\n      The challenged transaction is [the Prime Board's] approval of the\r\n      [m]erger. The alleged breach of fiduciary duty occurred at the time\r\n      the [the Prime Board] approved the [m]erger [a]greement—June 23,\r\n      1989. It is not the [m]erger that constitutes the wrongful act of which\r\n      [the plaintiffs] complain; it is the \"fixing of the terms of the\r\n      transaction.\" [The plaintiffs] will be subject to a defense that there is\r\n      no continuing wrong. Arguably, [the defendants] refusal to cancel the\r\n      [m]erger was not the wrongful act producing allegations of breach of\r\n      fiduciary duty; it was the original decision to effectuate the [m]erger.\r\n\nId. (internal citations omitted).9\r\n\r\n      In Seidel v. Lee, 954 F. Supp. 810 (D. Del. 1996), the Delaware district court\r\nanalyzed whether a plaintiff's state law claims in a securities based lawsuit were\r\ntime-barred. In that case, the district court held that publicly filed documents give\r\nadequate notice of possible wrong-doing, sufficient to support a claim:\r\n\r\n      However, beneficiaries should not put on blinders to such obvious\r\n      signals as publicly filed documents, annual and quarterly reports,\r\n      proxy statements, and SEC filings. Here, the Court concludes that the\r\n      public documents, which form the basis of many of Plaintiff's claims,\r\n      could have provided Plaintiff with adequate notice of any alleged\r\n      misconduct by Defendants.\r\n\r\nId. at 817 (holding the doctrine of inherent unknowability inapplicable to the\r\nplaintiff's case and barring the plaintiff's state law claims).\r\n\r\n       In Albert v. Alex. Brown Management Services, No. Civ.A. 762-N, 2005 WL\r\n1594085, at *1 (Del. Ch. June 29, 2005), the plaintiffs, investors in two exchange\r\nfunds, sued the funds' managers for breach of fiduciary duty. Id. at *1. Each\r\nplaintiff contributed appreciated securities to the funds in the hopes of receiving a\r\ndiversified basket of securities, capital appreciation, and tax deferral. Id. After the\r\nfunds' value collapsed, the funds' managers suspended redemptions and\r\ncommunications with the investors. Id. The plaintiffs sued, and the managers\r\nsought to dismiss both complaints, arguing, inter alia, that the plaintiffs' claims\r\nwere time-barred. Id.\r\n\r\n     The plaintiffs argued that their claims did not accrue until after the allegedly\r\nwrongful acts, specifically, when the funds' net asset value sank below the level the\r\nmanager's initially reported.

Id. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim:\r\n\r\n      This is incorrect. The law in Delaware is crystal clear that a claim\r\n      accrues as soon as the wrongful act occurs. This is so because the\r\n      plaintiffs were harmed as soon as the alleged wrongful acts occurred.\r\n      Whether or not the plaintiffs could have sued for damages is not\r\n      dispositive as to whether the claim accrued, since, as soon as the\r\n      alleged wrongful act occurred, the plaintiffs could have sought\r\n      injunctive relief. They did not. Instead, they waited until the value of\r\n      the [f]unds climbed to dizzying heights, and then came crashing\r\n      down.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added). The court also described the strong policy considerations\r\nbehind this view of claim accrual:\r\n\r\n      The flaw in the plaintiffs' argument is best exemplified by their claims\r\n      for hedging. The wrongful act the plaintiffs allege is the unhedging of\r\n      the funds. However, after the defendants unhedged the funds, their\r\n      value skyrocketed. This was due, of course, to the fact that the funds\r\n      were exposed to much more risk. Assuming (without deciding) that\r\n      unhedging the funds was a wrongful act, it was wrongful because it\r\n      exposed the funds to this extra risk. However, under the plaintiffs'\r\n      theory, they are given the equivalent of a call option. If the unhedging\r\n      of the funds works out, and the value of the funds goes up, the\r\n      plaintiffs will have no complaint. But if the hedging (or lack thereof)\r\n      strategy does not work out, and the value of the funds falls, the\r\n      plaintiffs can sue. This clearly is not, and should not be, the law. The\r\n      plaintiffs made the decision to ride the bubble to the top. They cannot\r\n      now complain that the bubble burst. The court reiterates that a claim\r\n      accrues at the time of the alleged wrongdoing, and not when the\r\n      plaintiff suffered a loss.\r\n\r\nId.   The In re SunGard Data Systems, Inc. v. Shareholders Litigation, No.\r\nCiv.A. 1221-N, 2005 WL 1653975, at *1 (Del. Ch. July 8, 2005), decision is an\r\nexample of a suit actually commenced under the post-Van Gorkom accrual\r\nprinciple. In that case, shareholders of SunGard Data Systems, Incorporated\r\n(SunGard) filed a class action suit claiming breach of fiduciary duty in the\r\nproposed merger of the company with Solar Capital Corporation (Solar). Id. at *1.\r\n\nFollowing approval of the merger, SunGard's shareholders were to receive $36 per\r\nshare, a 44.4% premium over the share's prior market price. Id. The plaintiffs\r\nclaimed that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to an unfair\r\nprice and that the defendants failed to provide adequate disclosure of the proposed\r\nmerger. Id. The plaintiffs sought an order expediting proceedings for the purpose\r\nof presenting a motion for a preliminary injunction. Id. The court denied the\r\nmotion and ruled the plaintiffs failed to present a colorable claim. Id. at *1–2\r\n(\"The Proxy Statement devotes over 15 pages to a description of the investment\r\nbankers' analyses . . . [T]his information is public and readily available to the\r\nshareholders. Viewed in relation to the 'total mix' of available disclosure, this\r\nclaim does not give rise to a colorable claim of breach of the duty of disclosure.\").\r\nThe SunGard decision is a practical application of the post-Van Gorkom rule\r\nindicating that Delaware courts expect claims for breach of fiduciary duty to be\r\nbrought at the time the alleged breach occurs, and that the viability of those claims\r\nwill be evaluated with reference to disclosures made when a merger is proposed\r\nand accepted.\r\n\r\n      Finally, the Delaware Supreme Court appears to have given a sign of\r\napproval of the post-Van Gorkom approach to claim accrual in its review of In re\r\nCoca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Shareholders Litigation, C.A. No. 1927-CC, 2007 WL\r\n3122370, at *1 (Del. Ch. Oct. 17, 2007). See Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters v.\r\nCoca-Cola Co., No. 601, 2008 WL 2484587, at *1 (Del. June 20, 2008) (\"This\r\n20th day of June 2008, upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, and their\r\ncontentions in oral argument, it appears to the Court that the judgment of the Court\r\nof Chancery should be affirmed on the basis of and for the reasons set forth in its\r\ndecision dated October 17, 2007.\").10\r\n\r\n       In that case, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the Teamsters)\r\nfiled a derivative action against Coca-Cola (Coke) alleging breaches of fiduciary\r\nduty. Coca-Cola, 2007 WL 3122370, at *1. Nominal defendant, Coca-Cola\r\nEnterprises (CCE), was the largest bottler and distributor of Coke beverage\r\nproducts in the world. Id. Initially formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Coke,\r\nCCE was spun off in 1986 as an independent, public company. Id. Its relationship\r\nwith former parent Coke continued pursuant to a series of contracts and licensing\r\nagreements. Id. The most important of those contracts was the 1986 Master Bottle\r\nContract (the 1986 MBC). Id. The 1986 MBC defined the contours of the\r\n\r\n10Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Coca-Cola Co., 954 A.2d 910 (Table) (Del.\r\n2008).\r\n\nrelationship between CCE and Coke, and the plaintiffs alleged that Coke and\r\nCCE's directors worked together to abuse the relationship between the two\r\ncompanies. Id. at *2. The Teamsters filed suit on February 7, 2006. Id. at *1–2.\r\nCoke argued that regardless of any actions taken in the years immediately\r\npreceding the lawsuit, all of the Teamsters' claims arose from the 1986 MBC. Id.\r\nat *2. Thus, Delaware's three year statute of limitations barred the Teamsters'\r\ncomplaint. Id. at *4 (\"Where, as here, a plaintiff seeks money damages for breach\r\nof fiduciary duties, the claim will 'be subject to the three-year limitations period of\r\n10 Del. C. § 8106' and this Court need not 'engage in traditional laches analysis.'\"\r\n(citations omitted)). The trial court agreed, and held that under Delaware law, a\r\nplaintiff's cause of action accrues at the moment of the wrongful act—not when the\r\nharmful effects of the act are felt—even if the plaintiff is unaware of the wrong.\r\nId. at *5, 7 (\"CCE's relationship with Coke may not be optimal, but it is guided by\r\na contract formed in 1986.\").11\r\n\r\n\r\n11The trial court in the instant case cited Coca-Cola in support of its finding in\r\nfavor of Petitioner:\r\n\r\n      As recently re-affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court, there can be\r\n      no breach of fiduciary duty claim regarding an underlying contract\r\n      until the contract is legally enforceable. Accordingly, since FITG had\r\n      no right to enforce the merger until the closing date, plaintiff's claims\r\n      for breach of fiduciary duty did not accrue until that date.\r\n\r\n     However, the court of appeals adequately addressed the trial court's\r\nmisapprehension of Coca-Cola's \"legally enforceable\" language:\r\n\r\n      Finally, we do not believe the \"legally enforceable rights\" language in\r\n      Kahn and Coca–Cola necessitate[s] a finding that [Petitioner's] claim\r\n      accrued after the merger. Once the merger agreement was signed,\r\n      SCI and FITG had legally enforceable rights against each other to\r\n      proceed with all aspects of the merger agreement in good faith. If\r\n      they did not, they would be in breach of the agreement and subject to\r\n      suit. More importantly, once the merger agreement was signed,\r\n      [Petitioner], as a shareholder, had a legally enforceable right to enjoin\r\n      the merger.\r\n\r\nMenezes, 392 S.C. at 596, 709 S.E.2d at 121 (alterations added).\r\n\n        In our view, post-Van Gorkom decisions stand for the proposition that, under\r\nDelaware law, a shareholder's claim for breach of fiduciary duty accrues at the\r\ntime corporate directors or officers breach their fiduciary duty. In the merger\r\ncontext, this includes a board of directors fixing merger terms inconsistent with\r\ntheir fiduciary role. The leading treatise on Delaware corporation law reflects this\r\nview:    Generally, the determinative issue is when the specific acts of alleged\r\n         wrongdoing occurred, and not when their effect is felt. Therefore, the\r\n         circumstances of the case will determine whether the transaction is\r\n         executed or continuing. For instance, an offer made by the\r\n         corporation to certain of its stockholders to exchange one class of\r\n         stock for another, which was specifically conditioned on approval by\r\n         the corporation's other stockholders, was held to not be completed\r\n         until stockholder approval was obtained. On the other hand, both a\r\n         proposed merger and a proposed supermajority voting provision\r\n         have been held to be consummated when their terms were fixed and\r\n         announced by the board of directors, and not to be continuing\r\n         transaction up to the time of stockholder approval.\r\n\r\n2 Edward P. Welch, Folk on the Delaware General Corporation Law:\r\nFundamentals § 327.3.2 (2010) (emphasis added);12 see also Wacht v. Cont'l\r\nHosts, Ltd., Civ. A. No. 7954, 1993 WL 315461, at *2–3 (Del. Ch. Aug. 5, 1993)\r\n(finding that a shareholder could have challenged a proposed merger at the time of\r\nthe merger's announcement).\r\n\r\n\r\n12   Kaufman v. Albin, supra, relied on an older version of this treatise:\r\n\r\n         Accordingly, the circumstances of the case will determine whether the\r\n         transaction is executed or continuing. If the action complained of\r\n         requires stockholder approval, the transaction is not considered\r\n         complete until the stockholders have approved it.\r\n\r\nKaufman, 447 A.2d at 764 (citing Folk, The Delaware General Corporation Law,\r\n487 (1967)). The revision to the Folk treatise demonstrates the Delaware court's\r\nevolution on the accrual of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, and the\r\ninapplicability of the Kaufman decision to the instant case.\r\n\n                             III.     Petitioner's Claim\r\n\r\n      Petitioner argues that the court of appeals erred in holding that his claim for\r\nbreach of fiduciary duty accrued when the SCI Board voted to approve the merger,\r\nand not when the merger was formally consummated by a shareholder vote. We\r\ndisagree, and find that the trial court erred in relying on pre-Van Gorkom authority.\r\nThe court of appeals properly reversed in light of the current state of Delaware law\r\nregarding accrual of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\r\n\r\n       Petitioner attempts to distinguish post-Van Gorkom case law, and argues, for\r\nexample, that cases such as Dieter v. Prime Computer,13 and FMC Corporation v.\r\nR.P. Scherer Corporation,14 are inapplicable because those cases address a\r\nshareholder's standing to bring a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. This\r\ndistinction is of no moment. In order to have standing one must generally have a\r\npersonal stake in the subject matter of the lawsuit, i.e., one must be a real party in\r\ninterest. Glaze v. Grooms, 324 S.C. 249, 255, 478 S.E.2d 841, 845 (1996); see,\r\ne.g., Appriva S'holder Litig. Co. v. EV3, Inc., 937 A.2d 1275, 1293 (Del. 2007) (\"In\r\nboth actions, the defendants contend that the plaintiffs are not the real parties in\r\ninterest. '[A] real party in interest objection closely resembles the defense of\r\nfailure to state a claim for relief because it presupposes that the plaintiff does not\r\nhave the substantive right [standing] to enforce the claim he is making.'\"\r\n(alterations in original)) (citing 6A Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and\r\nProcedure § 1554 (3d 2004)).\r\n\r\n       A determination of when a claim accrues is essential in deciding whether a\r\nperson has a viable stake in the subject matter of a lawsuit. Therefore, deciding the\r\nquestion of claim accrual through a standing analysis only increases the relevance\r\nof these opinions. Additionally, decisions addressing the standing issue are only a\r\nportion of the cases cutting against Petitioner's claim.\r\n\r\n       Petitioner also accuses the court of appeals of ignoring Teachers' Retirement\r\nSystem of Louisiana v. Aidinoff, 900 A.2d 654 (Del. Ch. 2006), which allegedly\r\nmakes \"clear\" that Petitioner's cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty could\r\nnot have occurred prior to the closing of the merger. However, in our view, if the\r\ncourt of appeals \"ignored\" Aidinoff, it is because the case is inapposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n13   681 A.2d 1068 (Del. Ch. 1996).\r\n14   No. 6889, 1982 WL 17888, at *1 (Del. Ch. Aug. 6, 1982).\r\n\n       In Aidinoff, the plaintiff, Teacher's Retirement System of Louisiana\r\n(Teachers), sought relief on behalf of nominal defendant American International\r\nGroup (AIG), against three AIG executives, Maurice Greenberg, Edward\r\nMatthews, and Howard Smith, and a separate corporation, Starr & Company,\r\nIncorporated (Starr) (collectively, the defendants). Aidinoff, 900 A.2d at 658.\r\nStarr operated four general insurance agencies and secured substantial payments\r\nfrom reinsurers dealing with AIG. Id. Greenberg, Matthews, and Smith were\r\nStarr's top three shareholders. Id. Greenberg served as Starr CEO, and Matthews\r\nand Smith served as directors. Id. Teachers claimed that Starr did not perform any\r\nduties that AIG could not perform in-house, and that the corporation existed\r\nmerely as a vehicle to enrich Greenberg, Matthews, and Smith. Id.\r\n\r\n       Teachers alleged that this sham contractual relationship existed for at least\r\ntwenty years before the period challenged in their complaint—1999 to 2004. Id.\r\nTeachers also complained that AIG annually decided to continue the practice. Id.\r\nat 658–59. The defendants argued, inter alia, that Teachers' claims were time-\r\nbarred. Id. at 659. The court disagreed, and held that although the contractual\r\nrelationship originated far outside the statute of limitations, AIG had no contractual\r\nduty to place business through Starr and had an annual opportunity to terminate\r\nStarr's contracts:\r\n\r\n      Therefore, the complaint is not challenging the original decision of\r\n      AIG to sign the [agreements] in the 1970s. It is attacking the\r\n      allegedly disloyal and self-enriching decision of Greenberg,\r\n      Matthews, and Smith to perpetuate an unfair relationship with Starr,\r\n      with the supine complicity of the outside directors of AIG, who\r\n      breached their duty of care by failing to understand, much less\r\n      knowingly approve, the Starr—AIG relationship.\r\n\r\nId. at 659, 666. Curiously, Petitioner cites this very paragraph in support of his\r\nposition. However, unlike the plaintiff in Aidinoff, Petitioner challenges an\r\noriginal decision, that of the SCI Board to adopt the terms of the merger with\r\nFITG. Petitioner does not challenge later, separate acts, such as the propriety of\r\nthe shareholder vote approving the merger. Thus, Aidinoff’s holding does not\r\nsupport Petitioner's view of claim accrual, and its focus on the possible continuing\r\nwrong of contract renewal is immaterial to the instant case.\r\n\r\n       The most recent Delaware authority does not comport with the notion that a\r\nplaintiff must wait for actual damages prior to filing an action for breach of\r\nfiduciary duty, and there are important public policy justifications for this trend.\r\n\nFor one, the actions of corporate directors and officers are given deference through\r\napplication of the business judgment rule, but this deference evaporates when the\r\ndirectors and officers fail to abide by the duties of care, loyalty, or good faith.\r\nSecond, forcing a plaintiff to wait for actual damages translates into requiring a\r\ncompany and its shareholders to undergo possibly significant harm instead of\r\ntaking action to prevent that harm. Efficiency and opportunity costs disfavor this\r\napproach. Finally, requiring a showing of actual damages for a breach of fiduciary\r\nduty allows individuals to purchase a lawsuit after a merger's terms have been\r\nfixed and publicly announced. This type of litigation has been expressly rejected\r\nby Delaware courts.                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       The foregoing analysis of Delaware law makes clear that a claim for breach\r\nof fiduciary duty accrues at the time of the breach, and that a plaintiff need not\r\nshow damages in order to bring her claim. In the merger context, this breach takes\r\nplace when the directors fix or adopt the terms of a merger contract. The facts of\r\nthe instant case demonstrate that any alleged breach occurred when the SCI Board\r\nadopted and publicly announced the terms of the merger with FITG. Following the\r\nSCI Board's adoption and announcement of the merger terms, but prior to the\r\nmerger's completion, Petitioner released all claims he held against SCI.15\r\n\r\n15 The court of appeals' decision contains a separate concurrence addressing the\r\ntrial court's combination of Petitioner's ten claims for breach of fiduciary duty.\r\nMenezes, 392 S.C. at 597–98, 709 S.E.2d at 121–22. The concurrence states that\r\non remand, the trial court should divide Petitioner's claim because \"one or more\r\nacts could be deemed a separate breach of fiduciary duty based on when each act\r\noccurred.\" Id. at 598, 709 S.E.2d at 122. We disagree.\r\n\r\n        Procedurally, any objection to the trial court's consolidation of Petitioner's\r\nallegation is not preserved for review. Id. at 598, 709 S.E.2d at 121. Additionally,\r\nit is not even clear that Petitioner contests the consolidation. Id. (\"Appellants\r\nneither argued that the claims should be considered separately, nor asked the court\r\nto alter or amend its ruling on the issue.\").\r\n        According to the concurrence, any claims arising between Petitioner's\r\nsigning of the Release on September 28, 2006 and the finalizing of the merger on\r\nOctober 20, 2006, are valid. The concurrence is theoretically correct. If Petitioner\r\nreleased all claims on September 28, 2006, any separate breaches of fiduciary duty\r\nthat occurred after that point would not be covered by the release. However,\r\nPetitioner's ten allegations are all consanguine with the SCI Board's adoption of the\r\n\nTherefore, we acknowledge the court of appeals' well-reasoned analysis, but\r\ndisagree that Petitioner's claim merely \"could\" have arisen prior to the closing of\r\nthe merger. Instead, we find that Petitioner held a valid claim at the time he signed\r\nthe Release, and therefore, his suit cannot be sustained and is dismissed with\r\nprejudice. The court of appeals correctly held that trial court erred in dismissing\r\nRespondents' defenses and counterclaim relating to the Release.\r\n\r\n      Thus, we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. The court of\r\nappeals' decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger terms. Each of the ten allegations stems from the SCI Board's fixing the\r\nmerger terms, which occurred prior to the date Petitioner released all claims\r\nagainst SCI. Thus, the trial court properly consolidated Petitioner's allegations,\r\nand the parties to this action acquiesced in that decision.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27255","title":"State v.

Farthing, and Solicitor Daniel E.\r\n            Johnson, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n      JUSTICE HEARN: Duplicity is an ill-favored quality in both life and the\r\nlaw, and here we deal with duplicity in several forms. While commonly\r\nunderstood to be synonymous with deceitfulness and double-dealing, when used in\r\n\nthe law, duplicity means \"[t]he charging of the same offense in more than one\r\ncount of an indictment.\" Black's Law Dictionary 541 (8th ed. 2004). After a\r\ncourse of duplicitous conduct in which appellant Myron Samuels romanced two\r\nwomen at the same time, he was tried and convicted for assaulting those women.\r\nHe now challenges his conviction and sentence on the grounds the indictment was\r\nduplicitous. Because of the distinct risks created by duplicitous indictments, we\r\nhold that an indictment is defective and entitles a defendant to relief if it is\r\nduplicitous, providing it results in prejudice to the defendant. Although we agree\r\nthe indictment was duplicitous, we find Samuels was not prejudiced and\r\naccordingly affirm his conviction and sentence.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       Samuels was romantically involved with two women, Patricia Speaks and\r\nCarla Daniels, among others, but told each woman he was involved with her alone.\r\nEventually, Speaks and Daniels learned of the other's relationship with Samuels.\r\nOn the evening of April 14, 2009, Daniels traveled to Speaks' home in Columbia,\r\nsuspecting Samuels was there and wanting to confront him. Samuels was there,\r\nand after Daniels entered the home, she and Speaks began to discuss their situation.\r\nSpeaks informed Daniels that Samuels was romantically involved with two\r\nadditional women and that she had copied their telephone numbers from his phone.\r\nThey then decided to call the other women in Samuels' presence, ostensibly to alert\r\nthem to the health dangers inherent in Samuels' duplicity.\r\n\r\n       While Daniels was speaking to one of the other women on the phone, she\r\nfelt something touch her forehead. She looked up to see Samuels holding the\r\nbarrel of Speaks' pistol against her forehead. Speaks began screaming, and\r\nSamuels then turned to her and threatened her with the gun. Samuels then fled\r\nfrom the home, and when Speaks ran after him to retrieve her pistol, Samuels hit\r\nher, knocking her to the ground. The women then called the police.\r\n\r\n       Samuels was indicted for one count of assault with intent to kill by a\r\nRichland County grand jury. The one count alleged: \"That Myron Samuels did in\r\nRichland County on or about April 14, 2009, with malice aforethought commit an\r\nassault with intent to kill upon the victim, Patricia Speaks and/or Carla Daniels, in\r\nviolation of Section 17-25-30 C/L, Code of Laws of South Carolina, (1976, as\r\namended).\r\n\n       At the outset of Samuels' trial, he moved to quash the indictment on the\r\nground that it charged two separate offenses by listing both Daniels and Speaks as\r\nvictims. Samuels contended that by including two victims in the indictment, the\r\njury could be divided on whether he committed the assaults on each woman, but\r\ncould still convict him if each juror believed he assaulted one of the women. He\r\nalso argued the indictment was deficient because the grand jury was presented with\r\ntwo victims and there was no way to determine that the grand jury voted for a true\r\nbill as to both victims. The State asserted that an indictment only must give a\r\ndefendant notice of the alleged crime, and this indictment satisfied that standard.\r\nThe circuit court ruled the indictment was valid because it provided notice and\r\ndenied the motion, relying on State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).\r\n\r\n      At the conclusion of the trial, a special verdict form with two parts was\r\nsubmitted to the jury without objection. First, the jury was asked to determine\r\nwhether Samuels was guilty of assault with intent to kill, guilty of assault of a high\r\nand aggravated nature, guilty of simple assault, or not guilty as to Speaks. The\r\nform then asked the jury to make a separate finding for Daniels using the same\r\noptions. The jury found Samuels guilty of simple assault of Speaks and assault of\r\na high and aggravated nature of Daniels.\r\n\r\n      During the trial, the court had stated that even if the jury found him guilty as\r\nto both victims, he could only be sentenced on one count. At sentencing, Samuels\r\nargued that under the rule of lenity, he could only be sentenced to the lesser\r\noffense of simple assault. The court declined that request, and for the crime of\r\nassault of a high and aggravated nature, sentenced him to ten years' incarceration,\r\nsuspended to time served and three years of probation, two hundred hours of\r\ncommunity service, and anger management classes.\r\n\r\n                              ISSUES PRESENTED\r\nI. \t   Did the circuit court err in refusing to quash the indictment?\r\n\r\nII.\t   Did the circuit court err in sentencing Samuels for assault of a high and\r\n       aggravated nature rather than simple assault?\r\n\n                                LAW/ANALYSIS\n\r\n\r\nI.    DUPLICITOUS INDICTMENT                  \n\r\n      Samuels asserts the circuit court erred in denying his motion to quash\r\nbecause the indictment was duplicitous in alleging he assaulted \"Patricia Speaks\r\nand/or Carla Daniels.\" While we agree that the indictment was duplicitous, we\r\nhold defendant is not entitled to any relief due to the lack of prejudice.\r\n\r\n      In Gentry, we held the sufficiency of an indictment is determined by whether\r\n\r\n      (1) the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to\r\n      enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the\r\n      defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he\r\n      may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon; and (2) whether it\r\n      apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense that is intended\r\n      to be charged.\r\n\r\nGentry, 363 S.C. at 102–03, 610 S.E.2d at 500. The indictment here provided\r\nsufficient notice to Samuels and the court by stating what crime he allegedly\r\ncommitted, on what date, where, and the name of the victims. In short, Samuels\r\nknew from the indictment what allegations he would be required to defend against\r\nat trial, and the indictment was therefore sufficient under Gentry.\r\n\r\n       However, Gentry addressed the sufficiency of indictments generally, and did\r\nnot consider duplicitous indictments which allege two distinct and separate\r\noffenses in the same count. See 41 Am. Jur. 2d Indictments and Informations §\r\n207 (2013). Duplicitous indictments \"implicate a defendant's rights to notice of the\r\ncharge against him, to a unanimous verdict, to appropriate sentencing and to\r\nprotection against double jeopardy in a subsequent prosecution.\" United States v.\r\nMurray, 618 F.2d 892, 896 (2d Cir. 1980). For example, such indictments present\r\nthe risk that a jury divided on the two separate offenses in one count could\r\nnevertheless convict through a general verdict on the one count. United States v.\r\nRobinson, 627 F.3d 941, 957 (4th Cir. 2010); see also United States v. Sturdivant,\r\n244 F.3d 71, 75 (2d Cir. 2001) (discussing the \"risk that the jurors may not have\r\nbeen unanimous as to any one of the crimes charged\"). Duplicitous indictments\r\nalso can create sentencing problems, such as where a jury's general verdict leaves\r\n\nthe sentencing judge unsure as to whether the defendant is guilty of and subject to\r\npunishment for multiple offenses. See Sturdivant, 244 F.3d at 78–79 (discussing\r\nthe sentencing implications of a duplicitous indictment and general verdict). For\r\nthose reasons, duplicitous indictments are generally considered defective and may\r\nbe dismissed on that ground. See 41 Am. Jur. 2d Indictments and Informations §\r\n209 (2013).\r\n\r\n       However, proceeding to trial on a duplicitous indictment does not alone\r\ncreate reversible error. For example, federal courts employ a prejudice analysis\r\nand will reverse a conviction for duplicity only where two or more distinct crimes\r\nare combined into one count and the defendant is prejudiced thereby. See United\r\nStates v. Mauskar, 557 F.3d 219, 226–27 (5th Cir. 2009); Sturdivant, 244 F.3d at\r\n75. In adopting that standard, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second\r\nCircuit reasoned that \"[i]f the doctrine of duplicity is to be more than an exercise in\r\nmere formalism,\" it can only be applied where prejudice exists, i.e., where the\r\npolicy considerations supporting the rule against duplicitous indictments are\r\nactually present. Murray, 618 F.2d at 897. In analyzing whether a defendant\r\nsuffered prejudice, the Second Circuit has helpfully listed relevant policy\r\nconsiderations:\r\n\r\n      avoiding the uncertainty of whether a general verdict of guilty\r\n      conceals a finding of guilty as to one crime and a finding of not guilty\r\n      as to another, avoiding the risk that the jurors may not have been\r\n      unanimous as to any one of the crimes charged, assuring the defendant\r\n      adequate notice, providing the basis for appropriate sentencing, and\r\n      protecting against double jeopardy in subsequent prosecutions.\r\n\r\nSturdivant, 244 F.3d at 75.\r\n\r\n      We recognize both the policy considerations supporting a prohibition against\r\nduplicitous indictments and that the Gentry standard does not protect against the\r\npotential harms. In recognition of those considerations, but also to avoid mere\r\nformalism, we adopt the federal standard. Accordingly, we supplement the Gentry\r\nstandard by holding that a defendant will prevail on appeal when he establishes\r\nboth that an indictment was duplicitous and that he was prejudiced by the\r\nduplicity.\r\n\r\n       Applying that two part standard to this case, we first agree with Samuels that\r\nhis indictment was duplicitous. For offenses against the person, a separate offense\r\n\nexists for each person subjected to the criminal conduct. See State v. Jones, 344\r\nS.C. 48, 54, 543 S.E.2d 541, 543 (2001). Samuels was charged with one count of\r\nassault with intent to kill, and assault requires that the defendant engage in conduct\r\nthat threatens another person, and thus is clearly an offense against the person. See\r\nState v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 397–98, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285–86 (2000). Therefore,\r\neach victim of his threatening conduct constituted a new assault offense. By\r\nincluding both victims in one count, the indictment charged two offenses in one\r\ncount and was defective for duplicity.\r\n\r\n       Despite the indictment's duplicity, we find no prejudice to Samuels due to\r\nthe actions of the circuit court. A duplicitous indictment's potential prejudice can\r\nbe cured through jury instructions and the use of a special verdict. See Robinson,\r\n627 F.3d at 958 (\"It is black letter law that duplicitous indictments can be cured\r\nthrough appropriate jury instructions.\"); Mauskar, 557 F.3d at 226–27 (finding the\r\ndefendant was not prejudiced due to the trial court's clear instructions that in order\r\nto return a guilty verdict, the jury had to unanimously agree he committed one of\r\nthe offenses in a duplicitous indictment). At Samuels' trial, the circuit court\r\ninstructed the jury a guilty verdict required unanimous agreement among the jurors\r\nthat Samuels assaulted Daniels or unanimous agreement he assaulted Speaks. The\r\ncourt also employed a special verdict form requiring the jury to make separate\r\nfindings of guilt or innocence as to Daniels and Speaks. Furthermore, Samuels\r\nwas only sentenced for one offense despite the jury finding him guilty of two\r\noffenses. Accordingly, because Samuels cannot demonstrate how he was\r\nprejudiced by the duplicitous indictment, he is not entitled to the reversal of his\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nII.   SENTENCING\r\n\r\n      Samuels also asserts that because the indictment was duplicitous the circuit\r\ncourt erred in sentencing him for assault of a high and aggravated nature. He\r\ncontends the court was required to apply the rule of lenity and sentence him for\r\nsimple assault, the lesser of the two offenses for which he was found guilty. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n      Initially, we note the rule of lenity is a rule of statutory construction. See\r\nBryant v. State, 384 S.C. 525, 533, 683 S.E.2d 280, 284 (2009) (\"When a genuine\r\nambiguity exists as a result of the proposed application of [a penal statute] to a\r\ngiven situation, the rule of lenity requires that the doubt must be resolved in the\r\ndefendant's favor.\"); State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662\r\n\n(1991) (\"[W]hen a statute is penal in nature, it must be construed strictly against\r\nthe State and in favor of the defendant.\"). Because the circuit court was not\r\nconstruing a penal statute in sentencing Samuels, the rule of lenity is not applicable\r\nhere.  Samuels also relies on Sturdivant for the proposition that when a defendant\r\nis charged through a duplicitous indictment, the sentencing court must give him the\r\nbenefit of the doubt and sentence him to the lesser offense. We find that Samuels\r\nreads Sturdivant's holding too broadly and it is distinguishable on the facts. There,\r\nunlike the present case, the jury returned a general verdict on the duplicitous\r\nindictment. Sturdivant, 244 F.3d at 75. At sentencing, the trial court assumed the\r\njury found the defendant guilty of both offenses contained in the duplicitous\r\nindictment and sentenced him accordingly. Id. On appeal, the Second Circuit\r\nfound the defendant had been improperly sentenced based on both offenses\r\nbecause it was unclear from the general verdict which of the two offenses the jury\r\nunanimously agreed upon. Id. at 78. Therefore, the court remanded for\r\nresentencing, concluding the defendant should be sentenced to the offense\r\ninvolving the lesser penalty in order to ensure he was not prejudiced by the unclear\r\nnature of the jury's verdict. Id. at 80.\r\n\r\n       The present case is materially different from Sturdivant in that here, the\r\ncircuit court employed a special verdict form that unequivocally established the\r\njury found Samuels guilty of both assault of a high and aggravated nature and\r\nsimple assault. However, because Samuels was indicted and tried for only one\r\ncount, the court only sentenced him for one of the offenses comprising that count.\r\nBecause he was found guilty of assault of a high and aggravated nature, we find no\r\nerror in the circuit court sentencing him for that offense.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we hold that although Samuels' indictment was\r\nduplicitous, it does not require reversal because he was not prejudiced. We also\r\nhold the circuit court did not err in sentencing Samuels for assault of a high and\r\naggravated nature. Accordingly, we affirm Samuels' conviction and sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27256","title":"Shirley's Iron Works v.

Southco\r\nGrassing, Inc. (Sloan I), 377 S.C. 108, 659 S.E.2d 158 (2008). When\r\nsubcontractors Shirley's Iron Works, Inc. and Tindall Corporation (collectively\r\nRespondents) did not receive full payment from the general contractor Gilbert\r\nGroup, LLC (Gilbert) for their work on a public construction project for the City of\r\nUnion (the City), they filed suit, asserting the City failed to comply with the\r\nstatutory bond requirements pertaining to contractors working with subcontractors\r\non public projects found in the SPPA. The circuit court granted summary\r\njudgment to the City. The court of appeals reversed and remanded. Shirley's Iron\r\nWorks, Inc. v. City of Union, 397 S.C. 584, 726 S.E.2d 208 (Ct. App. 2009). We\r\ngranted a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals decision. We now affirm\r\nin part, reverse in part, and remand. Further, we clarify Sloan I and hold that a\r\ngovernmental entity may be liable to a subcontractor only for breach of contract for\r\nfailing to comply with the SPPA bonding requirements.\r\n\r\n                                         I.\r\nIn 2002, the City issued a request for proposals for the design and construction of a\r\nspec building. Thereafter, the City contracted with Gilbert for the project, the cost\r\nof which totaled approximately $875,000. Gilbert entered into contractual\r\nagreements with various subcontractors, including Respondents. The City did not\r\nrequire Gilbert to secure a payment bond, and it is undisputed no payment bond\r\nwas secured. Ultimately, Gilbert failed to fully compensate all of the\r\nsubcontractors after they completed work on the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 29-6-210 -290 (Supp. 2012).\r\n2   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 15-78-10 -220 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\nAt the project's completion, the City contended it owed $111,270 on its contract\r\nwith Gilbert. Respondents also had significant unpaid invoices.3 After the City\r\nwas notified of Gilbert's failure to pay its subcontractors,4 the City offered to\r\ndistribute the balance of its contract with Gilbert to the unpaid subcontractors in\r\nexchange for a release of the City's liability. The City offered each Respondent\r\n$25,000. Upon Respondents' refusal to accept the offer and execute a release in\r\nfavor of the City, the City distributed their pro rata portions to the other unpaid\r\nsubcontractors.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Respondents filed a Complaint against the City, alleging the City should\r\nbe required to pay the amounts owed under their respective subcontracts because\r\nthe City failed to require Gilbert to secure a payment bond in violation of S.C.\r\nCode Ann. section 29-6-250.5 Respondents also requested attorney's fees pursuant\r\nto S.C. Code Ann. section 15-77-300 (Supp. 2012).6 The City filed an answer\r\ndenying Respondents' allegations. The City also filed a third-party complaint\r\nagainst Gilbert, alleging Gilbert was negligent in failing to acquire a payment\r\nbond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3Respondent Shirley's Iron Works had unpaid invoices in the amount of $132,782.\r\nRespondent Tindall Corporation had unpaid invoices in the amount of $165,500.\r\n4A City administrator testified that the $111,270 was the balance owed as of the\r\nproject's completion. However, he could not remember the date upon which the\r\nCity learned of Gilbert's nonpayment, but stated it was while the project was still\r\nunder construction.\r\n5Section 29-6-250(1) provides that when a governmental entity is a party to a\r\ncontract to improve real property, and the contract is for a sum in excess of\r\n$50,000, the property owner must require the general contractor to provide a\r\npayment bond in the full amount of the contract.\r\n6 Section 15-77-300(A) states that in any civil case contesting state action, the\r\nprevailing party may recover reasonable attorney's fees if the governmental agency\r\nacted without substantial justification in pressing its claim against the party, and\r\nthere are no special circumstances that would make the award of attorney's fees\r\nunjust.\r\n\nIn 2004, Judge Paul Short granted the City's motion to strike Respondents' request\r\nfor attorney's fees.7 No appeal was taken from the order granting the motion to\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nIn August 2005, Respondents filed an Amended Complaint against the City and\r\nGilbert, asserting third-party beneficiary status of the contract between the City\r\nand Gilbert, alleging Gilbert failed to pay Respondents for their work, and\r\ncontending the City failed to require Gilbert to secure a payment bond in violation\r\nof the SPPA. This Amended Complaint was considerably more detailed than the\r\noriginal complaint. In the \"Facts\" section, Respondents contended section 29-6-\r\n250(1) created an obligation on the City to ensure that a payment bond is in place\r\nto protect subcontractors and is a term of the City's contract with Gilbert.\r\nRespondents asserted they were third-party beneficiaries of the City's contract with\r\nGilbert because the bonding requirements of section 29-6-250 serve to protect\r\nRespondents as subcontractors and are \"legislatively mandated contractual\r\nobligations\" incorporated into the contract as a matter of law. Respondents argued\r\nthey were damaged by the City's breach of its statutorily imposed contractual\r\nobligation to secure a payment bond from Gilbert. Respondents asserted causes of\r\naction for (1) \"[v]iolation of S.C. Code Ann. [section] 29-6-250,\" (2) attorney's\r\nfees for violation of S.C. Code Ann. section 27-1-15, (3) negligence, (4) quantum\r\nmeruit, and (5) attorney's fees and prejudgment interest.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Judge Steven John granted the City's motion to strike Respondents'\r\nclaims for attorney's fees and prejudgment interest. Judge John noted that Judge\r\nShort's previous order stated Respondents' original complaint sounded in tort, and\r\nthat attorney's fees and prejudgment interest were not available under the TCA.\r\nJudge John held that Judge Short's unappealed order \"constitute[d] the law of the\r\ncase,\" which he was \"bound to apply.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently, both parties moved for summary judgment. Judge John Few granted\r\nthe City's motion for summary judgment on all of Respondents' causes of action\r\nand denied Respondents' motion. Judge Few found Respondents' claims sounded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7Judge Short also granted the City's motion to join Gilbert as a defendant, finding\r\nGilbert and the City were \"joint tortfeasors whose alleged acts combined and\r\nconcurred to cause the harm for which [Respondents] seek to recover.\"\r\n\nin tort and were barred by the TCA. Additionally, Judge Few held that a\r\ngovernmental entity's violation of the SPPA does not give rise to a private cause of\r\naction by a subcontractor.8 Respondents appealed, and the court of appeals\r\nreversed and remanded.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the court of appeals reversed Judge Few's findings with respect to\r\nRespondents' negligence claim, holding that the SPPA provided for a tort cause of\r\naction which was not governed by the TCA. The court reasoned that Sloan I\r\nsupported its conclusion. Additionally, the court of appeals held Judge John's and\r\nJudge Short's previous orders stating Respondents' claims sounded in tort were not\r\nthe law of the case and Respondents' Amended Complaint, when read as a whole,\r\nsufficiently pled a third-party beneficiary breach of contract cause of action for\r\nviolation of the SPPA. Concluding a ruling on the merits would be premature, the\r\ncourt of appeals remanded to the circuit court for findings regarding Respondents'\r\ntort, breach of contract, and quantum meruit claims to determine liability and\r\ndamages.9 This court granted the City's writ of certiorari to review the court of\r\nappeals opinion.                         II.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same\r\nstandard as the trial judge under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Bovian v. Canal Ins., 383\r\nS.C. 100, 105, 678 S.E.2d 422, 424 (2009). Summary judgment is proper if,\r\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is no\r\ngenuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\nmatter of law. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 Judge Few's order was based, in part, on the court of appeals decision in the\r\nSloan I litigation. See Sloan Constr. Co. v. Southco Grassing, Inc., 368 S.C. 523,\r\n629 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 2006). However, Judge Few issued his summary\r\njudgment order prior to our opinion in Sloan I, which reversed the court of appeals.\r\n9The court of appeals also found Respondents' claim for attorney's fees under\r\nsection 27-1-15 of the South Carolina Code was not preserved for review and\r\nRespondents have not appealed this ruling.\r\n\n                                         III.\r\n\r\n                                          A.\r\n\r\nWith the enactment of the TCA in 1986, the legislature intended to remove the\r\ncommon law bar of sovereign immunity in certain circumstances, but only to the\r\nextent legislatively authorized. See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-20 (declaring it is the\r\npublic policy of the state that government entities are only liable for torts within\r\nthe limitations of this chapter). However, the TCA expressly delineated many\r\nexceptions to the waiver of immunity, including that the governmental entity is not\r\nliable for loss resulting from failure to enforce any law or statute. See id. § 15-78-\r\n60(4).\r\n\r\nThereafter, in 2000, the legislature enacted the SPPA. The SPPA reads in pertinent\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n      (1) When a governmental body is a party to a contract to improve real\r\n      property, and the contract is for a sum in excess of fifty thousand\r\n      dollars, the owner of the property shall require the contractor to\r\n      provide a labor and material payment bond in the full amount of the\r\n      contract . . . .\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      (3) For purposes of any contract covered by the provisions of this\r\n      section, it is the duty of the entity contracting for the improvement to\r\n      take reasonable steps to assure that the appropriate payment bond is\r\n      issued and is in proper form.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 29-6-250 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nIt is the interplay of these two statutory schemes which is implicated in the present\r\ncase. Both parties rely on Sloan I to advance their respective positions.\r\n\r\nIn Sloan I, this Court addressed whether a subcontractor may bring a private right\r\nof action against a governmental entity for failure to comply with the statutory\r\nbonding requirements of the SPPA. A subcontractor working on a state highway\r\nmaintenance project brought claims against the Department of Transportation\r\n(SCDOT) for its alleged failure to comply with the bonding requirements of the\r\nSPPA. The subcontractor brought an action for negligence against SCDOT\r\n\npursuant to the TCA and a breach of contract claim alleging SCDOT was obligated\r\nto it, as a third-party beneficiary to the contract between SCDOT and the\r\ncontractor, to ensure that the contractor was properly bonded pursuant to the\r\nSPPA.\r\n\r\nWe held the SPPA is specifically applicable to subcontractors and suppliers on\r\ngovernment projects and outlines a detailed bonding scheme that significantly\r\nexpands the protections already afforded these parties. Sloan I, 377 S.C. at 114,\r\n659 S.E.2d at 161. However, the Court noted the SPPA does not expressly provide\r\nfor a private right of action between the subcontractor and the contracting\r\ngovernment body. Id. at 114, 659 S.E.2d at 162. Nevertheless, the Court reasoned\r\nthe \"very title of the SPPA clearly indicates the [legislature] intended to provide\r\nstronger payment protection specifically for subcontractors and suppliers on\r\ngovernment projects.\" After an analysis of the terms of the SPPA, we held \"the\r\nlegislature must have intended for those to whom the government owed the duty to\r\nbe able to vindicate their rights under a statute enacted for their special benefit.\"\r\nId. (noting \"the SPPA is framed solely in the context of payment security by virtue\r\nof its location in Chapter 6, Title 26, entitled 'Payments to Contractors,\r\nSubcontractors, and Suppliers'\"). Thus, we found \"an implied private right of\r\naction by a subcontractor against the government exists under the SPPA.\" 10\r\n\r\nSpecifically addressing the third-party beneficiary claim, the Court relied on the\r\nreasoning of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in A.E.I. Music Network, Inc. v.\r\nBus. Computers, Inc., 290 F.3d 952 (7th Cir. 2002). In A.E.I., the Seventh Circuit\r\nexplained that the statutory bond requirement, which is similar to this state's, was a\r\ncontractual term incorporated by the legislature. In creating the bond requirement,\r\nthe Seventh Circuit reasoned the legislature intended public works construction\r\ncontracts to protect subcontractors. A.E.I., 290 F.3d at 955. Thus, the A.E.I. court\r\nheld the subcontractor's claim as a third-party beneficiary sounded in common law\r\nas a claim for breach of contract. Id. at 957.\r\n\r\n\r\n10In 2011, after a second appeal in the Sloan litigation, this Court modified its\r\nholding from Sloan I. See Sloan Constr. Co. v. Southco Grassing, Inc. (Sloan II),\r\n395 S.C. 164, 717 S.E.2d 603 (2011). In Sloan II, we held that the governmental\r\nentity did not owe a continuing duty to maintain the payment bond throughout the\r\ncourse of the project. However, because Respondents allege that the City failed to\r\nensure that a payment bond was procured in the first instance, Sloan II's holding\r\ndoes not impact this case.\r\n\nWe found A.E.I.'s analysis persuasive and stated:\r\n\r\n      Because the legislature intended to protect contractors by creating\r\n      bonding requirements, and because the subcontractors are the only\r\n      ones with a financial stake in enforcing the bond requirements,\r\n      subcontractors are direct third-party beneficiaries to the contract\r\n      between a government entity and a general contractor to which the\r\n      SPPA is applicable. For this reason, the government may be liable to\r\n      a subcontractor for breach of contract for failing to comply with the\r\n      SPPA bonding requirements.\r\n\r\nSloan I, 377 S.C. at 120, 659 S.E.2d at 165 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe Sloan I Court did not address the subcontractor's negligence claim in the body\r\nof the opinion. However, in footnote five, which is the source of the apparent\r\nconfusion in the current appeal, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n      Although we find that the court of appeals incorrectly based its\r\n      conclusion with respect to the SPPA on this issue on federal Miller\r\n      Act jurisprudence, we nevertheless agree that a claim for failure to\r\n      enforce the bonding requirements of the SPPA is not properly brought\r\n      pursuant to the Tort Claims Act because the Act does not act as a\r\n      waiver of sovereign immunity when a governmental entity fails to\r\n      enforce a statute. See S.C. Code Ann. § 15–78–60(4) (2005). See\r\n      also Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 292–93, 594 S.E.2d\r\n      557, 563–64 (Ct.App.2004) (noting that the South Carolina Tort\r\n      Claims Act is only a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for tort\r\n      claims against government entities and does not create new\r\n      substantive causes of action). Therefore, the Tort Claims Act is not\r\n      relevant to the government's liability for failure to comply with a duty\r\n      under the SPPA.\r\n\r\nId. at 118, 659 S.E.2d at 164, n.5 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nWe find footnote five is clear and presents no ambiguity. The TCA forecloses a\r\ntort action under the SPPA. Indeed, this Court must presume the legislature knew\r\nof and contemplated the TCA in enacting the SPPA. See State v. McKnight, 352\r\nS.C. 635, 648, 576 S.E.2d 168, 175 (2003) (\"There is a presumption that the\r\nlegislature has knowledge of previous legislation as well as of judicial decisions\r\n\nconstruing that legislation when later statutes are enacted concerning related\r\nsubjects.\"). The TCA is the sole and exclusive remedy for tort actions against the\r\ngovernment. See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-200 (\"Notwithstanding any other\r\nprovisions of law, [the TCA] is the exclusive and sole remedy for any tort\r\ncommitted by an employee of a governmental entity while acting within the scope\r\nof the employee's official duty.\"). And, subsection (4) of section 15-78-60 makes\r\nclear that the government is not liable in tort for its failure to enforce a statute. See\r\nalso Proctor v. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 290, 628 S.E.2d\r\n496, 502 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"The [TCA] governs all tort claims against\r\ngovernmental entities and is the exclusive civil remedy available in an action\r\nagainst a governmental entity or its employees.\" (quoting Parker v. Spartanburg\r\nSanitary Sewer Dist., 362 S.C. 276, 280, 607 S.E.2d 711, 714 (Ct. App. 2005))).\r\nFootnote five in Sloan I reinforces these provisions and plainly excludes a tort\r\naction under the SPPA.\r\n\r\nFinally, after expressly stating that \"the government may be liable to a\r\nsubcontractor for breach of contract for failing to comply with the SPPA bonding\r\nrequirements[,]\" we addressed the extent of governmental liability under the SPPA.\r\nSloan I, 377 S.C. at 120, 659 S.E.2d at 165(emphasis added). The Court observed\r\nthat \"in a tort or a contract action arising under the SPPA, the government entity's\r\nliability is limited to the remaining unpaid balance on the contract with the general\r\ncontractor when the subcontractor notifies the government of the general\r\ncontractor's nonpayment.\" Id. at 121, 659 S.E.2d at 165-66 (emphasis added). We\r\nbelieve the superfluous use of the term \"tort\" here is the reason for the lingering\r\nconfusion whether a violation of the SPPA will support a tort cause of action.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the court of appeals found that the Respondents could proceed against\r\nthe City on a tort cause of action based on our conclusion that \"the SPPA\r\nestablishes both an affirmative duty on the governmental body to require payment\r\nbonding, as well as a standard of care for overseeing the issuance of a proper\r\npayment bond.\" The court of appeals held such language \"clearly suggested a tort\r\nremedy for breach of the duty created pursuant to section 29-6-250 of the SPPA.\"\r\n\r\n                                           B.\r\n\r\nBoth parties contend the court of appeals was correct in finding Respondents' cause\r\nof action for violation of the SPPA was a tort. The City argues a tort cause of\r\naction is governed by, and ultimately barred by, the TCA. Conversely,\r\nRespondents contend the court of appeals properly held the SPPA permits a tort\r\n\ncause of action, notwithstanding the TCA. We reject both contentions, for the\r\nSPPA does not permit a private cause of action sounding in tort.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\nof the legislature. Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).\r\n\"There is a presumption that the legislature has knowledge of previous legislation\r\nas well as of judicial decisions construing that legislation when later statutes are\r\nenacted concerning related subjects.\" McKnight, 352 S.C. at 648, 576 S.E.2d at\r\n175. \"It is presumed that the Legislature is familiar with prior legislation, and that\r\nif it intends to repeal existing laws it would . . . expressly do so; hence, if by any\r\nfair or liberal construction two acts may be made to harmonize, no court is justified\r\nin deciding that the later repealed the first.\" Hodges, 341 S.C. at 88-89, 533 S.E.2d\r\nat 583.\r\n\r\nWe reject the suggestion that the legislature intended to provide a tort remedy\r\nunder the SPPA. First, the text of the pertinent sections of the SPPA sounds in\r\ncontract, not tort. Sloan I adopted the reasoning of A.E.I., which held the bonding\r\nrequirement is incorporated into public works construction contracts and a\r\nsubcontractor's claim sounded in common law as a claim for breach of contract.\r\nAnd this Court's definitive holding in Sloan I could not have been clearer: \"For this\r\nreason, the government may be liable to a subcontractor for breach of contract for\r\nfailing to comply with the SPPA bonding requirements.\" Sloan I, 377 S.C. at 120,\r\n659 S.E.2d at 165.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is true that Sloan I, in the section concerning relief, referenced a \"tort or\r\ncontract action arising under the SPPA . . . .\" However, we now clarify that no tort\r\naction arises under the SPPA. Therefore, we reverse the court of appeals with\r\nrespect to its holding and find that the SPPA does not provide for a tort cause of\r\naction against a governmental entity.      C.\r\nThe City next contends the court of appeals erred in reversing the circuit court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment as to the claim of third-party beneficiary breach of\r\ncontract. Specifically, the City contends the law of the case doctrine forecloses a\r\nthird-party beneficiary claim, and even assuming it does not, Respondents did not\r\nsufficiently plead a third-party beneficiary breach of contract action in their\r\nAmended Complaint. We disagree and affirm the court of appeals in both respects.\r\n\n                                          i.\r\n\r\nAn unappealed ruling is the law of the case and requires affirmance. Transp. Ins.\r\nCo. & Flagstar Corp. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 389 S.C. 422, 432, 699 S.E.2d\r\n687, 691 (2010). Certainly,\r\n\r\n      The doctrine of the law of the case applies to an order or ruling which\r\n      finally determines a substantial right. . . . Ordinarily an interlocutory\r\n      order which merely decides some point or matter essential to the\r\n      progress of the cause, collateral to the issues in the case, is not binding\r\n      as the law of the case, and may be reconsidered and corrected by the\r\n      court before entering a final order on the merits.\r\n\r\nWeil v. Weil, 299 S.C. 84, 89, 382 S.E.2d 471, 473 (Ct. App. 1989) (quoting 21\r\nC.J.S. Courts Section 195 at 335 (1940)). This State has a long-standing rule that\r\none judge of the same court cannot overrule another. Charleston Ctny. Dep't of\r\nSoc. Servs. v. Father, 317 S.C. 283, 288, 454 S.E.2d 307, 310 (1995).\r\n\r\nWe find the orders of Judge John and Judge Short are not the law of the case\r\ninsofar as the Amended Complaint is concerned. Neither Judge Short nor Judge\r\nJohn specifically ruled on the issue of whether Respondents pled a third-party\r\nbeneficiary breach of contract claim. Moreover, the City's motions to strike did not\r\nrequire the trial court to determine whether a breach of contract action had been\r\npled.11 Therefore, we hold the law of the case doctrine does not foreclose\r\nRespondents' third-party beneficiary contract claim.\r\n\r\n                                          ii.\r\n\r\n\"Pleadings are to be liberally construed 'to do substantial justice to all parties.'\"\r\nQuality Towing, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 29, 33, 530 S.E.2d 369, 371\r\n(2000) (quoting Rule 8(f), SCRCP). \"It is elementary that the principal purpose of\r\npleadings is to inform the pleader's adversary of legal and factual positions which\r\nhe will be required to meet on trial.\" S.C. Nat'l Bank v. Joyner, 289 S.C. 382, 387,\r\n346 S.E.2d 329, 332 (Ct. App. 1986); see also Langston v. Niles, 265 S.C. 445,\r\n\r\n\r\n11Furthermore, the two orders merely granted the City's motion to strike with\r\nregard to attorney's fees and prejudgment interest pursuant to section 15-7-300 and\r\nshould not be viewed beyond their intended and limited purpose.\r\n\n455, 219 S.E.2d 829, 833 (1975) (\"The purpose of pleadings is to place the\r\nadversary on notice as to what the issues are.\").\r\n\r\nWe find Respondents' Amended Complaint pled a third-party beneficiary contract\r\nclaim. In the \"Facts\" section of the Amended Complaint, Respondents allege they\r\nwere \"third-party beneficiaries\" of the City's contract with Gilbert because the\r\nbonding requirements are \"legislatively mandated contractual obligations\" that\r\nwere incorporated into the contract as a matter of law. The First Cause of Action\r\nincorporated the allegations within the \"Facts\" section and is entitled \"Violation of\r\nS.C. Code Ann. section 29-6-250.\" While the word \"contract\" does not appear in\r\nthe first cause of action, neither do the words \"tort\" or \"negligence.\" A fair reading\r\nof the Amended Complaint leads to the reasonable conclusion that the first cause\r\nof action is one for breach of contract. Moreover, in light of our holding in section\r\nB, infra, the only claim that can be asserted under section 29-6-250 is a contract\r\nclaim. Thus, we hold the Amended Complaint sufficiently put the City on notice\r\nthat Respondents were proceeding on a third-party beneficiary claim theory.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we affirm the court of appeals on the issues relating to Respondents'\r\nthird-party beneficiary breach of contract claim.\r\n\r\n                                         D.\r\n\r\nThe City also contends the court of appeals erred in reversing summary judgment\r\nas to Respondents' quantum meruit claim. We agree. Because there is no dispute\r\nas to the existence or validity of the underlying contract at issue, which is\r\nfundamentally at odds with the quasi-contractual theory of quantum meruit, we\r\nreverse the court of appeals' holding with respect to this claim. See Sloan I, 377\r\nS.C. 108, 659 S.E.2d 158 (holding the SPPA's bonding requirements are\r\nincorporated into all public works construction contracts); Strickland v. Coastal\r\nDesign Assocs., 294 S.C. 421, 424, 365 S.E.2d 226, 228 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"The law\r\nis well settled in this nation that where an express contract has been rescinded or\r\nabandoned, one furnishing labor or materials in part performance may recover in\r\nquantum meruit unless the original contract remains in force.\" (emphasis added)).\r\nThe grant of summary judgment in favor of the City on the quantum meruit claim\r\nis reinstated.\r\n\n                                          E. \n\r\n\r\nAs a final matter, the City contends summary judgment should have been affirmed\r\nin any event because it has satisfied its obligation under the SPPA by paying the\r\nremaining balance on its contract with Gilbert to several of the unpaid\r\nsubcontractors. Thus, the City argues no remand is necessary. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSloan I limits the City's liability to the remaining unpaid balance on the contract\r\nwith Gilbert at the time the City received notice of Gilbert's nonpayment. 377 S.C.\r\nat 120, 659 S.E.2d at 165-66. The record is unclear as to the City's methodology of\r\npayment disbursement, and there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the\r\ndate upon which the City learned of Gilbert's nonpayment, as well as the amount\r\nremaining unpaid at that time. Because factual questions are in dispute, summary\r\nresolution would be premature.12         IV.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court of appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in\r\npart, and this matter is remanded to the circuit court for resolution of the remaining\r\nissues consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12In light of our holdings, remand is limited to liability and damages based only on\r\nthe surviving third-party beneficiary breach of contract claim.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27257","title":"Amisub v.

The\r\ndispute arises out of Piedmont's contention that an urgent care center operated by a\r\ncompetitor, Carolinas Physicians Network, Inc. (CPN), was required to have a\r\nCertificate of Need (CON) or a Non-Applicability Determination (NAD) from the\r\nSouth Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). CPN\r\nis a wholly owned subsidiary of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority, d/b/a\r\nCarolinas Healthcare System (CHS). The ALC granted summary judgment to\r\nCHS and CPN on the basis the urgent care center was a licensed private physician's\r\noffice and, thus, exempt from CON review as a matter of law. The Court of\r\nAppeals reversed, finding summary judgment was premature, and remanded to\r\nallow Piedmont the opportunity to conduct discovery. The Court of Appeals\r\nrejected DHEC's argument that the ALC did not have subject matter jurisdiction in\r\nthis case because the agency had issued no staff decision subject to a contested\r\ncase hearing. Amisub of S.C., Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, Op.\r\nNo. 2010-UP-523 (S.C. Ct. App. refiled Apr. 25, 2011). This Court granted\r\nDHEC's petition for a writ of certiorari as to the issue of jurisdiction. We reverse.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n                       I. Development of Medical Center\r\n\r\n      CPN is a nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of North Carolina.\r\nIt owns and operates physicians' offices in North Carolina and South Carolina.\r\nCPN is a wholly owned subsidiary of CHS, a nonprofit health care system based in\r\nCharlotte, North Carolina.\r\n\r\n       On October 17, 2007, CHS wrote to DHEC and requested confirmation that\r\nits proposed construction of a medical office building in Fort Mill, South Carolina\r\n\ndid not require CON review. A DHEC staff member responded on October 26,\r\n2007 and confirmed that the \"project does not require Certificate of Need review\r\nbecause it is an expenditure by a health care facility for a non-medical project\" as\r\nprovided in S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 § 104(2)(f) (Supp. 2008). The letter's\r\nsubject line referenced this decision as E-07-125 / Construction of a medical office\r\nbuilding / Carolinas Medical Center — Fort Mill Office Plaza / Fort Mill, South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n       Upon learning of DHEC's grant of a written exemption for the construction\r\nproject, Piedmont filed a request for final review (RFR) by the DHEC Board of E-\r\n07-125 (the exemption decision) in 2007. The DHEC Board declined review on\r\nthe basis the request was untimely. Piedmont then requested a contested case\r\nhearing. The ALC ruled Piedmont's challenge was not timely filed, and the matter\r\nas to E-07-125 was dismissed in 2008. Amisub of S.C., Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Health\r\n& Envtl. Control, 2008 WL 4879672 (ALC order filed Oct. 3, 2008). Piedmont\r\ndid not further challenge this ruling.\r\n\r\n      According to Piedmont, CHS thereafter had the medical office building\r\nconstructed in Fort Mill at a cost of approximately $13.9 million. CPN opened its\r\nurgent care center there on January 12, 2009. CPN employed two family medicine\r\nphysicians, two nurses, and other personnel to staff the center. The practitioners\r\nprovide primary care, including initial diagnosis and treatment, from 8:00 a.m. to\r\n8:00 p.m. seven days a week. Patients are not required to have appointments, and\r\nthey do not stay overnight at the facility. CPN reportedly owns the center and the\r\npersonal property, including the equipment, used to treat the patients.\r\n\r\n       Prior to the opening of the urgent care center, Piedmont's counsel met with\r\nDHEC staff on January 5, 2009, regarding the plan to establish the center at the\r\nFort Mill medical office building. On January 16, 2009, Piedmont's counsel sent a\r\nfollow-up letter to DHEC requesting that DHEC \"take immediate steps to require\r\nCHS's submission of either a non-applicability request or a CON application\" for\r\nthe urgent care center. Piedmont's counsel asserted CHS's actions were contrary to\r\nits previous written assurance to DHEC that it would not open an urgent care\r\ncenter without first obtaining a CON or a NAD, citing a 2007 letter from CHS to\r\nDHEC.1 Counsel further asserted that expenditures by a health care facility in\r\n\r\n1 Bennett Thompson, a CHS Management Associate, made the statement in a\r\nletter to DHEC dated December 19, 2007, in which he acknowledged CHS's\r\nreceipt of DHEC's grant of a written exemption for the construction of the medical\r\nbuilding. According to an affidavit dated April 3, 2009 of Dan Wiens, CPN's\r\n\nexcess of $2 million required a CON and that, while the offices of licensed private\r\npractitioners generally are exempt, that exemption does not apply to the urgent care\r\ncenter because, \"upon information and belief, the physicians who will staff the\r\ncenter are employed by a public health care facility (or its affiliate) . . . .\"\r\n\r\n       On January 28, 2009, Piedmont's counsel, Daniel Westbrook, spoke with\r\nBeverly Patterson, Director of DHEC's CON program, about the urgent care center\r\nand was informed by Patterson that \"DHEC had not decided to take any action to\r\nrequire Carolinas [CHS] to apply for a Non-applicability Determination or\r\nCertificate of Need for its Ft. Mill urgent care center.\" Counsel prepared an\r\naffidavit dated January 30, 2009 summarizing this telephone conversation.\r\nCounsel added, \"As of the date of this affidavit, I have not received a writing from\r\nDHEC memorializing its decision to not take any action against Carolinas [CHS]\r\nfor the opening of its urgent care center.\"\r\n\r\n       On February 2, 2009, Piedmont's counsel filed with the Clerk of the DHEC\r\nBoard a written request for final review, which sought the Board's review of\r\n\"DHEC's staff decision\" not to require a CON or a NAD for the opening of the\r\nurgent care center.2 Counsel attached his affidavit dated January 30, 2009 that\r\nsummarized his telephone conversation with the Director of DHEC's CON\r\nprogram. Counsel asked the Board (1) to issue a cease and desist order prohibiting\r\nfurther operation of the center until there was a final decision on a CON\r\n\r\n\r\nSenior Vice President for Operations, CPN later determined the CON Act was not\r\napplicable to the urgent care center because it was the office of a licensed private\r\npractitioner (which did not require a written exemption), so it did not seek or\r\nreceive a formal exemption determination from DHEC.\r\n2 Counsel stated, \"Piedmont challenges DHEC staff's decision on the grounds that:\r\n1) it violates S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-160(3) and S.C. Code Ann. Reg[s]. 61-15\r\n§ 102(1)(c) which requires a person or health care facility to obtain a CON before\r\nundertaking an expenditure on behalf of a health care facility in excess of $2\r\nmillion; 2) it violates S.C. Code Ann. Reg[s]. 61-15 § 102(1)(3) which requires an\r\napplicant to request a formal determination by the Department of the applicability\r\nof the CON requirements when any question exists; 3) the exemption to CON\r\nreview found in S.C. Code Ann. Reg[s]. [61-15] § 104 do not apply to [CHS's]\r\nconstruction of an urgent care center; 4) it deprives Piedmont of due process under\r\nthe South Carolina and United States Constitutions; and 5) the staff's decision was\r\narbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.\"\r\n\napplication or a NAD request, and (2) to require CHS to file a CON application or\r\na NAD request prior to reopening the center.\r\n\r\n       The Clerk of the DHEC Board responded to Piedmont's counsel on February\r\n4, 2009, declining the request for review. The Clerk noted the request was filed\r\n464 days after DHEC's decision in the matter was mailed to the applicant on\r\nOctober 26, 2007, and any request for review was due within fifteen days after\r\nnotice of the decision. The subject line of the letter referenced \"Docket No. 09-\r\nRFR-06 - Staff decision dated October 26, 2007, (mailed 1/7/2009), to approve an\r\nexemption (E-07-125) for an expenditure by health care facility for a non-medical\r\nproject.\" Thus, the letter referenced DHEC's earlier determination that the\r\nconstruction of the medical office building was exempt from CON requirements,\r\nrather than Piedmont's question regarding the opening of the urgent care center.\r\n\r\n       Counsel for Piedmont wrote to the Clerk of the Board and acknowledged\r\nthat any challenge to E-07-125 would be untimely and that Piedmont was not\r\nchallenging the exemption for the building construction in 2007. Counsel\r\nexplained, \"The DHEC staff decision for which we seek review is the unwritten\r\ndecision made in January or February 2009 and communicated to me verbally on\r\nJanuary 28, 2009, as described in my affidavit of January 30, 2009 . . . .\" Counsel\r\nasserted DHEC's determination that the center was a private practitioner's office\r\nand therefore not subject to CON review was in error because the physicians there\r\nwere employed by a health care facility. Counsel asked for clarification as to\r\nwhether the letter of February 4, 2009 represented a final decision of the DHEC\r\nBoard to deny Piedmont's request for review.\r\n\r\n      Thereafter, the Clerk of the Board notified Piedmont that the DHEC Board\r\nhad met on February 12, 2009 and had declined to conduct a final review\r\nconference in this matter.  II. Contested Case Hearing\r\n\r\n       On March 5, 2009, Piedmont filed a request with the ALC for a contested\r\ncase hearing, challenging DHEC's failure to require CHS to apply for and obtain a\r\nCON or a NAD for the urgent care center. CHS and DHEC were named as\r\nrespondents in the filing. Counsel argued a CON or a NAD was required because\r\nthe urgent care center was established by or on behalf of a health care facility, i.e.,\r\nCHS. Counsel for Piedmont attached his January 30, 2009 affidavit regarding his\r\nconversation with DHEC staff, along with Piedmont's request for review and the\r\nnotice from the DHEC Board declining review.\r\n\n       CPN (which was added as a respondent by consent of the parties) and CHS\r\nmoved for a dismissal or for summary judgment.3 At the hearing before the ALC\r\non April 16, 2009, Piedmont asserted no discovery had been completed and argued\r\nthe center was not entitled to classification as a private physician's office because it\r\nwas owned and operated by a health care facility. Specifically, Piedmont asserted\r\nthe center4 is marketed as a CHS facility, not as a physicians' practice, and that\r\nCHS, which originally expended the funds to construct the medical office building,\r\ncontrols the urgent care center through its wholly owned subsidiary, CPN.\r\nPiedmont contended further discovery was needed to determine the actual\r\nrelationship of the various entities and the true nature of the operations at the\r\nurgent care center.5\r\n\r\n       DHEC, in contrast, argued that a licensed private practitioner's office is\r\nexempt from CON requirements and no written exemption is required from DHEC;\r\nthat the CON requirements apply to health care facilities such as hospitals, but\r\nurgent care centers are not included within that statutory definition; that the center\r\nchallenged here is a private physician's office and therefore exempt as a matter of\r\nlaw; and discovery was not needed as ownership of the center was not a\r\ndeterminative factor since no restrictions as to ownership appear in any of the\r\nprovisions providing an exemption from CON review for the office of a licensed\r\nprivate practitioner.6\r\n\r\n\r\n3 CPN's motion requested a dismissal based on a lack of jurisdiction (CPN\r\nasserted there was no DHEC decision giving rise to a contested case), and it\r\nalternatively moved for summary judgment on the basis the urgent care center was\r\nexempt from CON requirements as a private physician's office.\r\n4It is variously referred to in the Appendix as \"Carolinas Healthcare Urgent Care\r\nCenter-Fort Mill\" and as \"Carolinas Medical Center-Fort Mill Urgent Care.\"\r\n5 Piedmont alleges CHS subsequently sold its ownership in the medical office\r\nbuilding, and CPN then leased the office space from HR of Carolinas, L.L.C.\r\n6 In an affidavit dated April 3, 2009, DHEC's CON Director, Beverly Brandt\r\n(formerly Patterson), stated an \"urgent care center\" is not defined in the CON Act\r\nor associated regulations. Brandt further stated \"[t]he identity of the owner of the\r\nphysician's office practice is not relevant to whether this exemption applies. If the\r\nphysician's office practice operates under the name of 'urgent care center' or a\r\n\n                    III. ALC's Grant of Summary Judgment\r\n\r\n       The ALC found summary judgment was appropriate because the urgent care\r\ncenter qualifies as the office of a licensed private practitioner and is therefore\r\nexempt from CON review as a matter of law. The ALC observed that \"[t]he\r\nessence of Piedmont's argument is that the physician office exemption does not\r\napply to physician offices owned by a health care facility.\" However, the ALC\r\nstated this issue does not create a question of fact. The ALC observed that neither\r\nthe CON Act enacted by the South Carolina General Assembly nor any associated\r\nregulations place any restriction on the type of private physician's office that is\r\nentitled to receive the exemption from CON review. The ALC concluded the\r\nownership of the center and whether CPN is a health care facility had no bearing\r\non whether the urgent care center is a private physician's office, so further\r\ndiscovery was not necessary on this point. Consequently, the ALC granted\r\nsummary judgment in favor of CPN and CHS.\r\n\r\n                        IV. Reversal by Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n       Piedmont appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed and remanded.\r\nAmisub of S.C., Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, Op. No. 2010-UP-\r\n523 (S.C. Ct. App. refiled Apr. 25, 2011). The court determined the ALC \"erred in\r\nfinding that it could resolve the case as a matter of law by granting summary\r\njudgment without affording Piedmont the opportunity to conduct discovery.\" Id.,\r\nslip op. at 2. The court also stated it \"disagree[d] with [DHEC's] subject matter\r\njurisdiction argument.\" Id. at 3. The court noted DHEC \"sought reconsideration of\r\n[the] initial opinion because it alleged there was no decision rendered by [DHEC]\r\nin this matter.\"7 Id. However, the court found \"[t]he record indicates that there\r\nwas a decision by [DHEC] to exempt the Center from review.\" Id. This Court\r\ngranted certiorari as to DHEC's arguments regarding subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimilar name, but still retains the nature of simply a physician's office practice,\r\nthen it qualifies for this exemption.\"\r\n7 Although the ALC questioned the lack of a written decision by DHEC at the\r\ncontested case hearing, the issue was not extensively discussed at that time and the\r\nALC's order does not specifically address this point. However, since the ALC\r\nruled on the merits of Piedmont's claim, it is reasonably inferable that the ALC\r\ndetermined it had jurisdiction.\r\n\n                           STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       The Administrative Procedures Act (APA)8 governs appeals from the ALC.\r\nMurphy v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 396 S.C. 633, 723 S.E.2d 191\r\n(2012). Under section 1-23-610(B) of the APA, an appellate court may reverse or\r\nmodify the decision of the ALC if the appellant's substantial rights have been\r\nprejudiced because the decision is (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory\r\nprovisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon\r\nunlawful procedure; (d) affected by an error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view\r\nof the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n(f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by an abuse of discretion or a clearly\r\nunwarranted exercise of discretion. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2012);\r\nKiawah Dev. Partners, II v. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, Op. No. 27065\r\n(S.C. Sup. Ct. refiled Feb. 27, 2013) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 28); Murphy,\r\n396 S.C. at 639, 723 S.E.2d at 194.\r\n\r\n                                LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       On certiorari, DHEC argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding the ALC\r\nhad subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute. Specifically, DHEC asserts it did\r\nnot issue a staff decision requiring notice and an opportunity for a hearing in a\r\ncontested case proceeding before the ALC.\r\n\r\n                    I. ALC's Jurisdiction in Contested Cases\r\n\r\n       The General Assembly has the authority to limit the subject matter\r\njurisdiction of a court it has created; therefore, it can prescribe the parameters of\r\nthe ALC's powers. Howard v. S.C. Dep't of Corrections, 399 S.C. 618, 733 S.E.2d\r\n211 (2012); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-500 (2005 & Supp. 2012) (creating an\r\nAdministrative Law Judge Division and subsequently renaming it the ALC); S.C.\r\nDep't of Consumer Affairs v. Foreclosure Specialists, 390 S.C. 182, 700 S.E.2d\r\n468 (Ct. App. 2010) (observing the ALC does not have the authority to exceed its\r\nstatutorily granted powers).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 Some of the APA statutes were amended after this proceeding, but the changes\r\ndo not affect the outcome here.\r\n\n       By statute, the General Assembly has authorized the ALC to preside over\r\n\"contested case\" proceedings. S.C. Code Ann § 1-23-600(A) (Supp. 2012); see\r\nalso id. § 44-1-60(F)(2) (allowing applicants, permittees, licensees, or affected\r\npersons to file a request for a contested case hearing with the ALC in accordance\r\nwith the APA after receiving a written decision from DHEC); S.C. Dep't of Rev. v.\r\nClub Rio, 392 S.C. 636, 642, 709 S.E.2d 690, 694 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"The statutory\r\nscheme confers on the ALC subject matter jurisdiction over [DHEC's] contested\r\ncases.\").\r\n\r\n       A \"contested case\" is defined in the APA as \"a proceeding including, but not\r\nrestricted to, ratemaking, price fixing, and licensing, in which the legal rights,\r\nduties, or privileges of a party are required by law or by Article I, Section 22,\r\nConstitution of the State of South Carolina, 1895,9 to be determined by an agency\r\nor the [ALC] after an opportunity for hearing.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-505(3)\r\n(Supp. 2012) (defining a \"contested case\" in ALC matters); see also id. § 1-23-\r\n320(A) (stating that, in a contested case, all parties must be afforded an opportunity\r\nfor a hearing after proper notice). A \"license\" in this context \"includes the whole\r\nor part of any agency permit, franchise, certificate, approval, registration, charter,\r\nor similar form of permission required by law . . . .\" Id. § 1-23-505(4) (emphasis\r\nadded).A brief overview of the specific provisions governing CONs, NADs, and\r\nexemptions will provide guidance in analyzing whether Piedmont's challenge in\r\nthis case was properly before the ALC as a contested case.\r\n\r\n                  II. The CON Act & DHEC's Review Process\r\n\r\nA.    The CON Act\r\n\r\n      (1) CON Requirements\r\n\r\n      The State Certification of Need and Health Facility Licensure Act (CON\r\nAct) governs the establishment of medical facilities and projects in South Carolina.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. §§ 44-7-110 to -385 (2002 & Supp. 2008).10 \"The purpose of [the\r\n\r\n\r\n9 S.C. Const. art. I, § 22 (\"No person shall be finally bound by a judicial or quasi-\r\njudicial decision of an administrative agency affecting private rights except on due\r\nnotice and an opportunity to be heard.\").\r\n\nCON Act] is to promote cost containment, prevent unnecessary duplication of\r\nhealth care facilities and services, guide the establishment of health facilities and\r\nservices which will best serve public needs, and ensure that high quality services\r\nare provided in health facilities in this State.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-120 (2002).\r\nThe General Assembly has designated DHEC as the sole state agency for control\r\nand administration of the program for granting CONs and the licensure of health\r\nfacilities and other related activities. Id. § 44-7-140.\r\n\r\n       Section 44-7-160 provides a person or \"health care facility\" as defined under\r\nthe CON Act is required to obtain a CON from DHEC before undertaking certain\r\nenumerated activities, such as constructing a new health care facility, changing the\r\nexisting bed complement of a health care facility, making capital expenditures by\r\nor on behalf of a health care facility in excess of a certain threshold prescribed by\r\nregulation, or acquiring medical equipment that is to be used for diagnosis and\r\ntreatment if the total project cost is in excess of an amount established by\r\nregulation. Id. § 44-7-160.\r\n\r\n       The CON Act defines a \"health care facility\" to include entities such as\r\nhospitals that provide overnight medical or surgical care, nursing homes,\r\nrehabilitation facilities, and other facilities for which a CON is required by federal\r\nlaw.11 Id. § 44-7-130(10). Urgent care centers are not included among the entities\r\nlisted as constituting a health care facility, and they are not otherwise defined in the\r\nCON Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10 The parties here rely on the version of the CON Act in the main volume and the\r\n2008 Code Supplement because the CON Act was amended after this action arose.\r\n11 The CON Act provides: \"'Health care facility' means acute care hospitals,\r\n                                 \r\npsychiatric hospitals, alcohol and substance abuse hospitals, methadone treatment\r\nfacilities, tuberculosis hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory surgical facilities,\r\nhospice facilities, radiation therapy facilities, rehabilitation facilities, residential\r\ntreatment facilities for children and adolescents, habilitation centers for mentally\r\nretarded persons or persons with related conditions, and any other facility for\r\nwhich [CON] review is required by federal law.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-130(10)\r\n(2002). \"Hospital\" is defined as \"a facility organized and administered to provide\r\novernight medical or surgical care or nursing care of illness, injury, or infirmity\r\nand may provide obstetrical care, and in which all diagnoses, treatment, or care is\r\nadministered by or under the direction of persons currently licensed to practice\r\nmedicine, surgery, or osteopathy.\" Id. § 44-7-130(12).\r\n\n       An application for a CON must be submitted to DHEC and must be\r\naccompanied by proof that the applicant published a notice in a newspaper serving\r\nthe area where the project is to be located announcing that an application is being\r\nmade. Id. § 44-7-200(A), (B). After receipt of the application with proof of\r\npublication and payment of an initial application fee, DHEC shall publish a notice\r\nin the State Register that an application has been accepted for filing. Id. § 44-7-\r\n200(D).Once DHEC has determined that an application is complete, \"affected\r\npersons\"12 must be notified, and this notification begins the review period. Id.\r\n§ 44-7-210(A). DHEC may hold a public hearing, if timely requested, to gather\r\nadditional information and obtain public comment about the proposed project. Id.\r\n§ 44-7-210(B). Ultimately, DHEC staff will make a proposed decision to grant or\r\ndeny the CON based on the staff review, and notice of the proposed decision shall\r\nbe sent to the applicant and affected persons who have asked to be notified. Id.\r\n§ 44-7-210(D).\r\n\r\n       \"The proposed decision becomes the final agency decision within ten days\r\nafter the receipt of a notice of the proposed decision by the applicant unless\" (1) an\r\naffected person showing good cause timely requests reconsideration of the staff\r\ndecision in writing, or (2) the applicant or other affected person with standing\r\nmakes a written request for a contested case hearing before the board or its\r\ndesignee regarding the grant or denial of the CON. Id. \"The department's\r\nproposed decision is not final until the completion of reconsideration or contested\r\ncase proceedings.\" Id. § 44-7-210(E).\r\n\r\n       \"After the contested case hearing is concluded and a final board decision is\r\nmade, a party who participated in the contested case hearing and who is adversely\r\naffected by the board's decision may obtain judicial review of the decision in the\r\ncircuit court pursuant to the [APA].\" Id. § 44-7-220.\r\n\r\n      (2) Exemptions from CON Requirements\r\n\r\n      Certain institutions and transactions are exempt from CON requirements.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-170 (2002 & Supp. 2008); 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-\r\n\r\n12 An \"affected person\" under the CON Act includes, among others, the applicant,\r\npersons residing with the geographic area to be served by the applicant, and\r\npersons located in the health service area who provide services similar to the\r\nproposed project. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-130(1) (2002).\r\n\n15, § 104 (Supp. 2008). Section 44-7-170 provides a CON is not needed for,\r\namong other things, \"the offices of a licensed private practitioner whether for\r\nindividual or group practice except as provided for in Section 44-7-160(1) and\r\n(6)[.]\"13 S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-170(A)(2) (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Regulation 61-15 lists twelve transactions that are exempt from CON\r\nrequirements. 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 § 104(2)(a) to (l). Among those is\r\nan exemption for \"[t]he offices of a licensed private practitioner whether for\r\nindividual or group practice except as provided for in Section 102.1.f[.]\"14 Id.\r\n§ 104(2)(e) (emphasis added). The term \"licensed private practitioner\" is not\r\ndefined in the CON Act or DHEC's regulations, and the only limiting or qualifying\r\nlanguage appears in section 44-7-170 and regulation 61-15 as specified above.\r\n\r\n       Six of the twelve exempted transactions require that approval of the\r\nexemption be obtained in writing from DHEC. Notably, the exemption for the\r\noffice of a licensed private practitioner is not among those requiring DHEC to\r\nissue a written exemption. Id. § 104(2)(e).\r\n\r\n      If a person or health care facility is required to obtain a written exemption\r\nfrom DHEC, a written request for the exemption must be submitted, accompanied\r\nby a project description, including its cost and any other information deemed\r\nnecessary for DHEC to make a determination on the exemption request. Id.\r\n§§ 104(1), 105. Thus, as to the exemptions requiring written approval from\r\nDHEC, there is a formal decision issued in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13 Section 44-7-160(1) states a CON is required for the construction or\r\nestablishment of a new health care facility. S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-160(1) (2002).\r\nSection 44-7-160(6) provides a CON is required for the acquisition of medical\r\nequipment to be used for diagnosis or treatment where the total project cost\r\nexceeds an amount specified by regulation. Id. § 44-7-160(6). Neither of these\r\nprovisions is in contention here.\r\n14 Section 102(1)(f) removes the exemption for the following: \"The acquisition of\r\nmedical equipment which is to be used for diagnosis or treatment if the total\r\nproject cost is in excess of $600,000[.]\" 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15\r\n§ 102(1)(f) (Supp. 2008).\r\n\n(3) Determinations of Nonapplicability\r\n\r\n       A provider may seek a written determination from DHEC that the CON Act\r\ndoes not apply to a proposed project; a determination of this kind is known as a\r\nNAD. InMed Diagnostic Servs., L.L.C. v. MedQuest Assocs., Inc., 358 S.C. 270,\r\n594 S.E.2d 552 (Ct. App. 2004). This usually occurs when a question arises as to\r\nwhether the total cost of a project falls below the threshold that would otherwise\r\ntrigger the requirement for a CON. See 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15\r\n§§ 102(1)(c) ($2,000,000 threshold for capital expenditures by or on behalf of a\r\nhealth care facility) & 102(1)(f) ($600,000 threshold for the acquisition of medical\r\nequipment to be used for diagnosis or treatment); see also MRI at Belfair, L.L.C. v.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 392 S.C. 314,709 S.E.2d 626 (2011) (noting\r\na formal written determination that the total project cost for the acquisition of\r\nmedical equipment did not exceed the $600,000 threshold is procured by a NAD).\r\n\r\n       Obtaining \"a NAD [is] a process for which DHEC has formulated exacting\r\nprocedural requirements.\" InMed Diagnostic Servs., L.L.C., 358 S.C. at 278-79,\r\n594 S.E.2d at 556. The procedure is outlined in section 102 of Regulation 61-15,\r\ngoverning applicability, which states that \"[w]hen any question exists, a potential\r\napplicant shall forward a letter requesting a formal determination by [DHEC] as to\r\nthe applicability of the [CON] requirements to a particular project.\" 24A S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Regs. 61-15, § 102(3) (emphasis added). \"Such a letter shall contain a\r\ndetailed description of the project including the extent of modifications, changes in\r\nservices, and total costs.\" Id. \"Additional information may be requested as may be\r\nreasonably necessary to make such applicability determination.\" Id. \"The\r\nDepartment shall respond within sixty days of receipt of the necessary\r\ninformation.\" Id. Thus, by its terms, the NAD procedure is directed to a potential\r\napplicant, and it requires DHEC to issue a formal determination to that party\r\nregarding whether or not a CON is necessary for a proposed project.\r\n\r\nB.    DHEC Provisions Governing Review\r\n\r\n       Section 44-1-60, governing appeals from DHEC decisions giving rise to\r\ncontested case hearings, provides that \"[a]ll department decisions involving the\r\nissuance, denial, renewal, suspension, or revocation of permits, licenses, or other\r\nactions of the department which may give rise to a contested case shall be made\r\nusing the procedures set forth in this section.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 44-1-60 (Supp.\r\n2008).\r\n\n      \"The initial decision involving the issuance, denial, renewal, suspension, or\r\nrevocation of permits, licenses, or other action of the department shall be a staff\r\ndecision.\" Id. § 44-1-60(C) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       \"In making a staff decision on any permit, license, certification or other\r\napproval, the department staff shall take into consideration all material comments\r\nreceived in response to the public notice in determining whether to issue, deny or\r\ncondition such permit, license, certification or other approval.\" Id. § 44-1-60(D).\r\n\"At the time that such staff decision is made, the department shall issue a\r\ndepartment decision, and shall base its department decision on the administrative\r\nrecord which shall consist of the application and supporting exhibits, all public\r\ncomments and submissions, and other documents contained in the supporting file\r\nfor the permit, license, certification or other approval.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       \"Notice of the department decision must be sent to the applicant, permittee,\r\nlicensee, and affected persons who have asked to be notified by certified mail,\r\nreturn receipt requested.\" Id. § 44-1-60(E). \"The department decision becomes the\r\nfinal agency decision fifteen days after notice of the department decision has been\r\nmailed to the applicant, unless a written request for final review is filed with the\r\ndepartment by the applicant, permittee, licensee, or affected person.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      Not later than sixty days after the receipt of a request for final review, a final\r\nreview conference must be conducted by the DHEC Board or its designee. Id.\r\n§ 44-1-60(F). \"If a final review conference is not conducted within sixty days, the\r\ndepartment decision becomes the final agency decision, and an applicant,\r\npermittee, licensee, or other affected person may request a contested case hearing\r\nbefore the [ALC], in accordance with the [APA], within thirty days after the\r\ndeadline for the final review conference.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       After review, the DHEC Board or its designee \"shall issue a written final\r\nagency decision based upon the evidence presented.\" Id. § 44-1-60(F)(2)\r\n(emphasis added). \"The written decision must explain the bases for the decision\r\nand inform the parties of their right to request a contested case hearing before the\r\n[ALC].\" Id. (emphasis added). \"[T]he written decision must be mailed to the\r\nparties . . . .\" Id. \"Within thirty days after the receipt of the decision an applicant,\r\npermittee, licensee, or affected person desiring to contest the final agency decision\r\nmay request a contested case hearing before the [ALC], in accordance with the\r\n[APA].\" Id.\r\n\n      With this background in mind, we turn now to DHEC's arguments regarding\r\nwhether there was a decision in the current matter that was subject to a contested\r\ncase proceeding.      III. Jurisdiction for Contested Case\r\n\r\n       DHEC contends the ALC did not have subject matter jurisdiction to conduct\r\na contested case hearing because there was no staff decision issued by DHEC\r\nrequiring notice and an opportunity to be heard.\r\n\r\n       DHEC asserts, \"A telephone conversation between a staff member and an\r\nattorney is not a staff decision within the purview of S.C. Code Ann. § 44-1-60\r\n(Supp. 2008); nor is an affidavit by an attorney recounting a telephone\r\nconversation with a staff member. In ruling otherwise, the Court of Appeals\r\nimproperly applied S.C. Code Ann. § 44-1-60 (Supp. 2008).\" See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 44-1-60(C) (\"[T]he initial decision involving the issuance, denial, renewal,\r\nsuspension, or revocation of permits, licenses, or other action of the department\r\nshall be a staff decision.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       DHEC argues that neither CPN nor CHS sought a certificate evidencing\r\npermission to open the urgent care center because a CON was not required by law,\r\nand a private physician's office is not one of the exemptions requiring a party to\r\nobtain written proof of its entitlement to the exemption from DHEC. See 24A S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Regs. 61-15 § 104(2)(e). Thus, since there was no approval or\r\npermission required by law from DHEC for the offices of a licensed private\r\nphysician, in the form of a CON, NAD, formal exemption, or any other manner,\r\nthere was no decision issued by DHEC that qualifies for a contested case hearing\r\nbefore the ALC, citing S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-600(A) (authorizing the ALC to\r\npreside over hearings of contested cases involving DHEC) and S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 1-23-505(3) (defining a contested case as a \"proceeding including, but not\r\nrestricted to, rate-making, price fixing, and licensing, in which the legal rights,\r\nduties, or privileges of a party are required by law or by Article I, Section 22,\r\nConstitution of the State of South Carolina, 1895, to be determined by an agency\r\nor the [ALC] after an opportunity for hearing\" (emphasis added)). DHEC further\r\nargues that, because there was no formal staff decision subject to review, the Clerk\r\nof the DHEC Board properly notified Piedmont that the Board would not hold a\r\nfinal review conference.\r\n\n       In contrast, Piedmont maintains the ALC did have jurisdiction, stating,\r\n\"Because DHEC made the decision that hospital-owned urgent care facilities are\r\nexempt from DHEC CON review and this decision adversely affects Piedmont, the\r\n[ALC] has jurisdiction to review this matter.\" Like DHEC, it also cites the\r\nstatutory language in section 44-1-60(C), but particularly relies upon the portion\r\nstating an initial decision involving permits, licenses, \"or other action of the\r\ndepartment shall be a staff decision.\" See id. § 44-1-60(C) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Piedmont alleges it was DHEC's unwillingness to communicate its \"staff\r\ndecision\" in writing that caused it to take the unusual step of relying upon counsel's\r\naffidavit to memorialize the decision in order to seek a contested case hearing.\r\nPiedmont maintains this unwritten staff decision became a final agency decision\r\nwhen the board met in February 2009 and decided to deny Piedmont's request for\r\nreview, a written decision evidenced by the letter that was sent to Piedmont. See\r\nid. § 44-1-60(F) (\"If a final review conference is not conducted within sixty days,\r\nthe department decision becomes the final agency decision, and an applicant,\r\npermittee, licensee, or affected person may request a contested case hearing before\r\nthe [ALC], in accordance with the [APA], within thirty days after the deadline for\r\nthe final review conference.\"\r\n\r\n       Piedmont maintains that, as a purported \"affected person,\" it was entitled to\r\nchallenge DHEC's determination in a contested case hearing. Piedmont further\r\nalleges that, under the DHEC regulations, CPN or CHS should have sought an\r\napplicability determination from DHEC if any question existed regarding the\r\nproject.15 See 24A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-15 § 102(3) (governing the procedure\r\nfor obtaining a NAD).\r\n\r\n       In finding there was a decision subject to a contested case hearing before the\r\nALC, the Court of Appeals stated, \"The record indicates that there was a decision\r\nby the Department to exempt the Center from review.\" Amisub of S.C., Inc. v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Health & Envtl. Control, Op. No. 2010-UP-523, slip op. at 3 (S.C. Ct.\r\nApp. refiled Apr. 25, 2011). \"For example, in a letter from CHS to the Department\r\ndated December 19, 2007, CHS stated that the Department provided notification\r\nthat the Center was exempt from CON review.\" Id. \"Also, in a letter dated\r\nFebruary 13, 2009, from the Department, written to CHS and Piedmont, the\r\nDepartment stated, '[t]he S.C. Board of Health and Environmental Control decided\r\n\r\n15 However, we find that, where the potential applicant, here CPN, did not make\r\nsuch a request based on its belief that it did not need DHEC approval, this failure\r\ncannot serve as the basis for a reviewable decision in a contested case matter.\r\n\non February 12, 2009, not to conduct a Final Review Conference on the above-\r\nreferenced matter.'\" Id. (alteration in original). The court noted DHEC's letter\r\n                    \r\ndeclining to conduct a final review conference referenced in the subject line a\r\n\"Staff decision dated October 26, 2007,\" and included in the same letter was a\r\nreference to section 44-1-60(F). Id.\r\n\r\n        We agree with DHEC that the first letter cited by the Court of Appeals as\r\nevidence of a staff decision, the letter dated December 19, 2007 from CHS to\r\nDHEC, refers, on its face, to an unrelated staff decision issued in a separate matter,\r\ni.e., DHEC's grant of an exemption to CHS in 2007 for the construction of the\r\nmedical office building. It did not constitute a decision on the subsequent opening\r\nof the urgent care center, which occurred some two years later. Moreover, the\r\nletter is from one of the parties; it is not a formal decision issued by DHEC.\r\n\r\n       We also find no support for the determination by the Court of Appeals that\r\nthere was a staff decision as to the urgent care center based on the letter dated\r\nFebruary 13, 2009 from DHEC declining the request for a final review conference.\r\nPiedmont had cited section 44-1-60(F), which provides that a department decision\r\nbecomes the final agency decision if a final review conference is not timely\r\nconducted, to support its argument that the DHEC Board's failure to conduct a\r\nreview conference gave rise to a final agency decision subject to a contested case\r\nhearing. However, this reference to the statute in DHEC's letter declining review\r\nwas included along with other information outlining general review procedures,\r\nand neither DHEC's general reference to section 44-1-60(F) nor the statute itself\r\ncan transform a letter simply declining review into a staff decision. In this case,\r\nthere is no original department decision existing that could have become a final\r\nagency decision under the statute.\r\n\r\n       DHEC asserts the Court of Appeals did not specifically address Piedmont's\r\ncontention that counsel's affidavit memorializing the alleged staff decision could\r\nbe considered sufficient to demonstrate a decision subject to review. We believe\r\nthis only serves to further illustrate the nebulous nature of Piedmont's contention.\r\nIn any event, we find the phone conversation with DHEC staff is not a \"staff\r\ndecision\" on the grant or denial of a license, permit, or other matter for which a\r\ndetermination is required by law, and it does not fall within the statutory\r\nparameters for a contested case.\r\n\r\n       CPN and CHS neither sought nor received a formal approval from DHEC\r\nfor a CON or a NAD, and there was no license, order, or decision issued. If DHEC\r\nhad determined that CPN was in violation of any applicable provision, it was\r\n\nentitled to pursue an enforcement action. DHEC, however, never found that CPN\r\nor CHS was in violation of any procedures.\r\n\r\n       Piedmont alleges DHEC has taken a contradictory position in this case\r\nbecause it has argued there was no staff decision, while at the same time the\r\naffidavit of its CON Director shows that DHEC did make a decision to exempt the\r\nurgent care center from CON requirements. However, we discern no inconsistency\r\nin DHEC's position. DHEC has averred there was no formal, written decision in\r\nthis case because the statutory and regulatory exemption for the offices of a\r\nlicensed private practitioner do not mandate that a provider obtain a written\r\nexemption from DHEC on this basis. Thus, there was no formal staff decision\r\nrequired by law, and there was no staff decision issued that was subject to the\r\nALC's review.\r\n\r\n        Piedmont's dispute here essentially concerns its desire to challenge CPN's\r\nentitlement to an exemption from the CON process based on its status as the office\r\nof a licensed private practitioner. Under the CON Act and the regulation, this\r\nexemption does not require a formal, written determination or approval from\r\nDHEC. In urging that it be allowed to assert its challenge in a contested case\r\nproceeding, Piedmont maintains the lack of a written exemption and formal\r\ndecision would insulate DHEC's decisions in this regard from any oversight.\r\nDHEC, in contrast, alleges that to allow Piedmont to utilize the contested case\r\nprocess, which is specifically defined and limited by our General Assembly, would\r\nsubject DHEC to an overwhelming number of contested case matters on everyday\r\ndecisions that the General Assembly did not see fit to subject to CON review or the\r\ncontested case process.\r\n\r\n       Our review of the relevant statutes and regulations evinces the clear\r\ndelineation of separate procedural tracks in these matters. For example, CON\r\napplications must go through a rigorous and detailed examination before resulting\r\nin a formal decision. The NAD procedure, which is less exacting, is used when an\r\napplicant (not a competitor) is unsure whether the total project costs will be under\r\nthe threshold that would otherwise require a CON. In addition, some of the\r\nexemptions require that approval for the exemption be obtained in writing from\r\nDHEC, while others do not; in such cases, however, the requirement for written\r\napproval is expressly noted within the exemption. In each of the foregoing\r\ncircumstances, i.e., where there is a CON, a NAD, or an exemption for which\r\nwritten approval is required, a formal decision emanates from DHEC for which a\r\ncontested case proceeding is provided by law.\r\n\n       Since there was no legal duty owed by DHEC to issue a staff decision in this\r\nmatter, which is the trigger giving rise to a contested case, there was no\r\ncorresponding obligation that Piedmont be afforded a contested case hearing\r\nbefore the ALC. Accordingly, we hold Piedmont may not utilize the contested\r\ncase review process where it has not been authorized by the General Assembly.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we conclude the Court of Appeals erred in finding\r\nPiedmont has established the existence of a staff decision by DHEC that is\r\nproperly the subject of a contested case hearing and in remanding the matter for\r\ndiscovery and further proceedings.16\r\n\r\n      REVERSED.\r\n\r\n PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore,\r\nconcur. HEARN, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16 Although we conclude the ALC lacked jurisdiction to review this matter in a\r\ncontested case proceeding, we find no fault in the ALC's reasoning. The General\r\nAssembly did not choose to include an \"urgent care center\" in its statutory\r\ndefinition of a \"health care facility.\" The only possible item the center could fall\r\nunder is a \"hospital,\" but the center clearly does not meet the CON Act's definition\r\nof a hospital because it does not offer medical and surgical services to its patients\r\non an overnight basis. Thus, to sua sponte include an \"urgent care center\" within\r\nthe statutory definition of a \"health care facility\" would be beyond the function of\r\nthis Court. Moreover, we are concerned that Piedmont's suggestion that we should\r\ntreat physicians' offices owned by hospitals differently from those that are not\r\nwould constitute an improper judicial restriction on a legislative provision, and it\r\nwould effectively eviscerate the private business model, a result that we do not\r\nbelieve was ever intended by the General Assembly. The statutory and regulatory\r\nprovisions regarding the exemption for a private physician's office contain the only\r\nrestrictions set forth by the General Assembly and by DHEC, respectively, and\r\nPiedmont cannot independently engraft additional limitations that were not so\r\nspecified by those authorities.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27258","title":"State v.

McCulloch, Jr. of\r\n   Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This case is one of two1 heard by the Court that\r\npresents the question of whether a pre-breath test videotape recording is required\r\nupon an arrest for driving under the influence (DUI) if the arrestee refuses the\r\nbreath test. At both trials, the trial court dismissed the DUI charges, finding that\r\nthe arresting officers did not comply with section 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) of the South\r\nCarolina Code by failing to videotape a twenty-minute pre-test waiting period. See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) (2006). The same panel of the court of\r\nappeals affirmed Ryan Hercheck's dismissal, but reversed Justin Elwell's dismissal\r\nseven months later. The State now appeals the dismissal of Hercheck's case, and\r\nElwell appeals the reversal of the dismissal in his case. With respect to Hercheck's\r\nappeal, we reverse the court of appeals.\r\n\r\n                       FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       Hercheck was arrested on December 10, 2006 for driving under the\r\ninfluence (DUI), 1st offense, after his car collided with another vehicle while\r\ndriving eastbound on South Carolina Highway 48. According to the traffic\r\ncollision report, Hercheck attempted to leave the scene of the accident, but was\r\napprehended. The arresting officer requested Hercheck submit to a breath test, and\r\nHercheck refused. Hercheck's conduct, through his refusal of the breath test, was\r\nvideotaped. However, once Hercheck refused the breath test, the arresting officer\r\nshut down the videotape recording and placed Hercheck into custody.\r\n\r\n       This case proceeded to trial in magistrate's court on May 15, 2008. During a\r\npre-trial hearing, the magistrate heard arguments concerning Hercheck's motion to\r\ndismiss the charges due to the arresting officer's failure to record a twenty-minute,\r\npre-test waiting period, which Hercheck alleged was required under section 56-5-\r\n2953. Because the arresting officer only filmed twelve minutes prior to Hercheck's\r\nrefusal of the test, the magistrate dismissed the case: \"The failure of the arresting\r\nofficer to produce the video required by this section is not grounds for a dismissal\r\nif the officer submits the sworn affidavit. You either got the video or got to submit\r\nthe affidavit. If he didn't submit the affidavit he cut it off twelve minutes and\r\nwasn't twenty minutes, I don't have no choice by law to grant [Hercheck's] motion\r\nto dismiss and so I do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1The other case, State v. Justin Elwell, Op. No. 27259 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 29,\r\n2013) (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. 24 at 54), was heard immediately following this\r\ncase.\r\n\n      The State appealed the magistrate's dismissal to circuit court, and a hearing\r\nwas convened on January 27, 2009. By order dated June 1, 2009, the circuit court\r\nupheld the dismissal of Hercheck's case.\r\n\r\n       The State appealed the case to the court of appeals. In an unpublished\r\nopinion, the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the case, stating \"the plain\r\nlanguage of subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) mandates a twenty minute video-\r\nrecording of the arrested individual's conduct during the breath test waiting period,\r\nand no exception exists permitting premature termination of the videotaping in the\r\nevent the arrested individual indicates he or she will not submit to the breath test.\"\r\nSee State v. Hercheck, Op. No. 2011-UP-161 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 13, 2011).\r\nIn addition, the court of appeals declined to find error in the circuit court's refusal\r\nto reverse the magistrate court's dismissal of Hercheck's case based on a\r\ndetermination that the \"totality of the circumstances\" exception provided in 56-5-\r\n2953(B) was inapplicable, because such an action by the circuit court was \"not an\r\nerror of law.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       This Court granted the State's petition for writ of certiorari to review the\r\ncourt of appeals' decision.             ISSUES\r\n\r\n   I.\t    Whether section 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) requires law enforcement\r\n          officers to videotape a twenty-minute pre-test waiting period when\r\n          the arrestee refuses to take a breath test?\r\n\r\n   II.\t   Whether the court of appeals erred in refusing to reverse the \n\r\n          dismissal of this case based on the totality of the circumstances \n\r\n          under section 56-5-2953(B) of the South Carolina Code?\n\r\n\r\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State\r\nv. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). Therefore, this Court is\r\nbound by the trial court's factual findings unless the appellant can demonstrate that\r\nthe trial court's conclusions either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an\r\nerror of law. State v. Laney, 367 S.C. 639, 644, 627 S.E.2d 726, 729 (2006).\r\n\n                                      ANALYSIS\n\r\n\r\n    I.    Videotape Requirement\r\n\r\n      The State argues that section 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) does not require a law\r\nenforcement officer to videotape the entire twenty-minute pre-test waiting period\r\nonce the arrestee refuses a breath test. We agree.\r\n\r\n       Pursuant to section 56-5-2953(A), any person arrested for DUI \"must have\r\nhis conduct at the incident site and the breath test site videotaped.\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 56-5-2953(A) (2006).2 To this end, there are certain requirements that must\r\nbe met at the breath test site (in addition to those required at the incident site and\r\noutlined in subsection 56-5-2953(A)(1)), one of which is that the videotape \"must\r\nalso include the person's conduct during the required twenty-minute pre-test\r\nwaiting period, unless the officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying that it was\r\nphysically impossible to video-tape this waiting period . . . . [, h]owever, if the\r\narresting officer administers the breath test, the person's conduct during the twenty-\r\nminute pre-test waiting period must be videotaped.\" Id. at § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d).3\r\nThe breath test videotape must also: (1) be completed within three hours of the\r\nperson's arrest or a probable cause determination, unless compliance is impossible\r\nbecause the person requires emergency medical treatment; (2) \"include the reading\r\nof Miranda rights, the entire breath test procedure, the person being informed that\r\nhe is being videotaped, and that he has the right to refuse the test;\" and (3) \"must\r\ninclude the person taking or refusing the breath test and the actions of the breath\r\ntest operator while conducting the test.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(a)–(c)\r\n(2006).4\r\n\r\n2 Because Hercheck was arrested prior to the enactment of the 2008 amendments\r\n(effective February 10, 2009) to this section, we decide this case under the 2006\r\nversion of the statute.\r\n3 The current provision is codified at 56-5-2953(A)(2)(c), and reads: \"The video\r\nrecording at the breath test site must . . . also include the person's conduct during\r\nthe required twenty-minute pre-test waiting period, unless the officer submits a\r\nsworn affidavit certifying that it was physically impossible to video record this\r\nwaiting period.\" See S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(c) (Supp. 2012).\r\n4The current provision deletes the three-hour requirement and the requirement for\r\nvideotaping the reading of the Miranda rights (which is now included as part of the\r\n\n      The court of appeals found that \"the plain language of subsection 56-5-\r\n2953(A)(2)(d) mandates a twenty minute video-recording of the arrested\r\nindividual's conduct during the breath test waiting period and no exception exists\r\npermitting premature termination of the videotaping in the event the arrested\r\nindividual indicates he or she will not submit to the breath test.\" Hercheck, Op.\r\nNo. 2011-UP-161.\r\n\r\n       The State argues the exact opposite that the statutory language is clear and\r\nunambiguous, as it refers to a \"pre-test\" waiting period. On the other hand,\r\nHercheck argues that nothing in the language used in the statute permits the State\r\nto prematurely stop videotaping the arrestee's conduct once an arrestee refuses to\r\nsubmit to the breath test. Instead, Hercheck asserts that \"[t]he law plainly requires\r\nthat the breath site video 'must' include 'the person's conduct during the required\r\ntwenty-minute pre-test waiting period' unless the officer submits a sworn affidavit\r\ncertifying physical impossibility to do so.\" See S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-\r\n2953(A)(2)(d)).\r\n\r\n       \"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is a court must ascertain and give\r\neffect to the intent of the legislature.\" State v. Scott, 351 S.C. 584, 588, 571 S.E.2d\r\n700, 702 (2002) (citing Charleston Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. State Budget & Control Bd.,\r\n313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993)). \"What a legislature says in the text of a statute is\r\nconsidered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will.\" Id. (quoting Norman\r\nJ. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction § 46.03 at 94 (5th ed. 1992)).\r\nTherefore, \"[i]f a statute's language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear\r\nmeaning 'the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no\r\nright to impose another meaning.'\" Id. (quoting Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85,\r\n533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000)); see also State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 561, 647\r\nS.E.2d 144, 161 (2007) (\"All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the\r\nmaxim that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the\r\nlanguage used.\" (citing McClanahan v. Richland Cnty. Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438,\r\n567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002))). However, penal statutes will be strictly construed\r\nagainst the state. Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332, 342, 713 S.E.2d\r\n278, 283 (2011) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n      We agree with the State that the inclusion of the word, \"pre-test,\" plainly\r\nrequires a breath test be administered for the videotape requirement to apply, and if\r\n\r\nincident site videotape requirements). See S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(a)–\r\n(b) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\nthere is no test, the statute does not require a videotape. In other words, if no test is\r\nadministered, then there can be no \"pre-test waiting period.\" Otherwise, the\r\nlegislature would not have included the \"pre-test\" modifier. See, e.g., Breeden v.\r\nTCW, Inc./Tennessee Exp., 355 S.C. 112, 120, 584 S.E.2d 379, 383 (2003) (stating\r\n\"[e]very word, clause, and sentence must be given some meaning, force, and effect,\r\nif it can be done by any reasonable construction.\" (citation omitted)); Davenport v.\r\nCity of Rock Hill, 315 S.C. 114, 117, 432 S.E.2d 451, 453 (1993) (\"It is never to be\r\nsupposed that a single word was inserted in the law of this state without the\r\nintention of thereby conveying some meaning.\" (citation omitted)); cf. Pittman,\r\n373 S.C. at 561, 647 S.E.2d at 161 (\"Whenever possible, legislative intent should\r\nbe found in the plain language of the statute itself.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n       The State further argues that it would be contrary to the legislative purpose\r\nof the subsection to require a twenty-minute videotape once an arrestee refuses the\r\nbreath test.\r\n\r\n       In Roberts, this Court stated that \"the purpose of section 56-5-2953 . . . is to\r\ncreate direct evidence of a DUI arrest.\" Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C.\r\n332, 347, 713 S.E.2d 278, 285 (2011). Once an arrestee refuses the breath test, the\r\nevidence gathering portion is over. As a consequence, we agree with the State that\r\nonce Hercheck refused the test and no breath test was administered, the statute did\r\nnot require the arresting officer to continue to videotape the twenty-minute pre-test\r\nwaiting period, and therefore, the videotape produced at trial complied with the\r\nstatutory requirements. To require otherwise, would result in the officer having to\r\nundergo a useless and absurd act. See Leviner v. S.C. Dep't of Highways and Pub.\r\nTransp., 313 S.C. 409, 412, 438 S.E.2d 246, 248 (1993) (\"[I]t is unreasonable to\r\nexpect an arresting officer to consider a refusal as conditional so that he must\r\nremain near the arrested person for an extended period of time. The arresting\r\nofficer would be required to forsake other duties to arrange for a belated test that\r\nthe motorist had already refused after receiving warnings of the consequences of\r\nhis noncompliance.\" (footnote omitted)).\r\n\r\n       Finally, the State argues that precedent supports its reading of the statute.\r\nMore specifically, relying on State v. Parker, 271 S.C. 159, 245 S.E.2d 904 (1978),\r\nand State v. Jansen, 305 S.C. 320, 408 S.E.2d 235 (1991), the State claims that the\r\ntwenty-minute pre-test waiting period merely makes up part of the foundational\r\nrequirements for the State's showing to admit the breath test results and to ensure\r\nthat the breath test results are accurate and reliable as evidence at trial. For this\r\nreason, the State claims that the twenty-minute pre-test waiting videotape is not\r\n\nrequired unless a breath test is actually administered. To the extent that all of these\r\ncases were enacted prior to the enactment of the codification of the statute,\r\nHercheck argues, they do not bear on the court's interpretation of the statutes\r\ntoday.5While we agree with Hercheck's contention that the statutory language must\r\ncontrol, we further agree with the State that these cases could be relied on to\r\ninform the Court's decision in this case. In the similar case, State v. Elwell, the\r\ncourt of appeals relied on these two cases to inform their reading of the term\r\n\"required\" in the subsection, finding that the legislature's inclusion of that term was\r\ndirectly linked to the pre-codification Parker and Jansen decisions. See State v.\r\nElwell, 396 S.C. 330, 334, 721 S.E.2d 451, 453 (Ct. App. 2011).\r\n\r\n      In Parker, this Court announced a test for laying a breath test foundation:\r\n\r\n      Prior to admitting such evidence, the State may be required to prove\r\n      (1) that the machine was in proper working order at the time of the\r\n      test; (2) that the correct chemicals had been used; (3) that the accused\r\n      was not allowed to put anything in his mouth for 20 minutes prior to\r\n      the test[;] and (4) that the test was administered by a qualified person\r\n      in the proper manner.\r\n\r\nParker at 163, 245 S.E.2d at 906. In Jansen, the Court held that the State was not\r\nrequired to abide by the waiting period requirement in implied consent cases when\r\na suspect refuses to take a breath test, stating \"[T]he Parker precautions are\r\nintended to ensure that the results of the breathalyzer test if given are accurate and\r\nreliable as evidence at trial,\" and therefore, the precautions were futile if no test\r\nwere administered. Jansen, at 322, 408 S.E.2d at 237. Therefore, the Elwell court\r\ninterpreted the subsection to mean that only when the waiting period is required\r\ncan the videotape recording also be required; if no test is administered, then the\r\nwaiting period is rendered unnecessary, and so then is the videotape recording of\r\nthat waiting period. Elwell, 396 S.C. at 335, 721 S.E.2d at 453–54. We find that\r\nthis is a valid construction of the subsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 We note that the subsection was first codified in 1998, and therefore longstanding\r\nSLED policy does not bear on our decision today. Instead, the statutory language\r\nis controlling, and SLED must change its policies to comply.\r\n\n   II.     Totality of the Circumstances\r\n\r\n       The State also argues that the court of appeals erred in affirming the circuit\r\ncourt's refusal to reverse the magistrate court's determination that the \"totality of\r\nthe circumstances\" exception was inapplicable under section 56-5-2953(B).\r\n\r\n       We need not reach this question because the statutory interpretation question\r\nis dispositive. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n518 S.E.2d 591 (1999) (finding an appellate court need not address remaining\r\nissues on appeal when a decision in a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n                                    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we reverse the court of appeals' decision in this case\r\nand find that a twenty minute pre-test video recording is not required where an\r\narrestee has refused the breath test under section 56-5-2953 of the South Carolina\r\nCode.

Barfield, Jr., of Lancaster, for\r\n   Respondent.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This case is one of two1 heard by the Court that\r\npresents the question of whether a pre-breath test videotape recording is required\r\nupon an arrest for driving under the influence (DUI) if the arrestee refuses the\r\nbreath test. At both trials, the trial court dismissed the DUI charges, finding that\r\nthe arresting officers did not comply with section 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) of the South\r\nCarolina Code by failing to videotape a twenty-minute pre-test waiting period. See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) (2006). The same panel of the court of\r\nappeals affirmed Ryan Hercheck's dismissal, but reversed Justin Elwell's dismissal\r\nseven months later. Elwell appeals the reversal of the dismissal in his case, and the\r\nState appeals the dismissal of Hercheck's case. With respect to Elwell's case, we\r\naffirm.                 FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       On January 3, 2009, Elwell was arrested and indicted for driving under the\r\ninfluence (DUI), 2nd offense, in Chester County. On that date, Elwell was taken to\r\na breath test site, where the arresting officer informed Elwell that he was being\r\nvideotaped, delivered Miranda2 warnings, and requested Elwell submit to a breath\r\ntest, but also informed him of his right to refuse the test. All of these actions were\r\nvideotaped. Elwell refused the test, which was also videotaped, but the arresting\r\nofficer turned off the video recording equipment after Elwell refused the test but\r\nbefore twenty minutes had elapsed.\r\n\r\n       On December 2, 2009, this case proceeded to trial in the circuit court.\r\nDuring a pre-trial hearing, the circuit court dismissed the case, finding the arresting\r\nofficer did not comply with section 56-5-2953 of the South Carolina Code by\r\nturning off the videotape recording after Elwell refused the breath test but prior to\r\nthe expiration of the twenty minute waiting period.\r\n\r\n      The State appealed. Relevant to this appeal, the court of appeals held that\r\nsubsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) does not require the videotape to include a twenty-\r\nminute waiting period if an arrestee refuses to submit to the breath test. State v.\r\nElwell, 396 S.C. 330, 333, 721 S.E.2d 451, 452 (Ct. App. 2011).\r\n\r\n1The other case State v. Hercheck, Op. No. 27258 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 29,\r\n2013) (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. 24 at 46), was heard by the Court immediately\r\npreceding this case.\r\n2   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\n       Elwell now appeals, and this Court granted his petition for writ of certiorari\r\nto resolve the discrepancy in outcomes between this case and State v. Hercheck.\r\n\r\n                                        ISSUE\r\n\r\n      Whether section 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) requires law enforcement\r\n      officers to videotape a twenty-minute pre-test waiting period when the\r\n      arrestee refuses to take a breath test?\r\n\r\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State\r\nv. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). Therefore, this Court is\r\nbound by the trial court's factual findings unless the appellant can demonstrate that\r\nthe trial court's conclusions either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an\r\nerror of law. State v. Laney, 367 S.C. 639, 644, 627 S.E.2d 726, 729 (2006).\r\n\r\n                                      ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n        Pursuant to section 56-5-2953(A), any person arrested for DUI \"must have\r\nhis conduct at the incident site and the breath test site videotaped.\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 56-5-2953(A) (2006).3 To this end, there are certain requirements that must\r\nbe met, one of which is that the videotape \"must also include the person's conduct\r\nduring the required twenty-minute pre-test waiting period, unless the officer\r\nsubmits a sworn affidavit certifying that it was physically impossible to video-tape\r\nthis waiting period . . . . [, h]owever, if the arresting officer administers the breath\r\ntest, the person's conduct during the twenty-minute pre-test waiting period must be\r\nvideotaped.\" Id. at § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d).4 The breath test site videotape must\r\n\r\n3 Because Elwell was arrested prior to the enactment of the 2008 amendments\r\n(effective February 10, 2009) to this section, we decide this case under the 2006\r\nversion of the statute.\r\n4 The current provision is codified at 56-5-2953(A)(2)(c), and reads: \"The video\r\nrecording at the breath test site must . . . also include the person's conduct during\r\nthe required twenty-minute pre-test waiting period, unless the officer submits a\r\nsworn affidavit certifying that it was physically impossible to video record this\r\nwaiting period.\" See S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(c) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\nalso: (1) be completed within three hours of the person's arrest or a probable cause\r\ndetermination, unless compliance is impossible because the person requires\r\nemergency medical treatment; (2) \"include the reading of Miranda rights, the entire\r\nbreath test procedure, the person being informed that he is being videotaped, and\r\nthat he has the right to refuse the test; and (3) \"must include the person taking or\r\nrefusing the breath test and the actions of the breath test operator while the\r\nconducting the test.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(a)–(c) (2006).5\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals based its decision to reverse the trial court on the plain\r\nlanguage of subsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d), which requires the videotape to\r\ninclude the arrestee's conduct \"during the required twenty-minute pre-test waiting\r\nperiod.\" Elwell, 396 S.C. at 334, 721 S.E.2d at 453 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. § 56-\r\n5-2953(A)(2)(d)) (emphasis in original). It is the use of the words \"required\" and\r\n\"pre-test\" that the court of appeals focused on to \"limit the application of the\r\nsubsection:\"\r\n\r\n         First, the use of \"pretest\" indicates the entire waiting period must\r\n         precede a breath test. Second, the use of \"required\" indicates the\r\n         waiting period must be videotaped only if the waiting period itself is\r\n         required.\r\n\r\nId. As to whether the waiting period is \"required,\" the court focused on the\r\nanalysis contained in the implied consent cases decided prior to the codification of\r\nthe subsection at issue, State v. Parker, 271 S.C. 159, 245 S.E.2d 904 (1978) and\r\nState v. Jansen, 305 S.C. 320, 408 S.E.2d 235 (1991).6 Id. at 334–35, 721 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n5 The current provision deletes the three-hour requirement and the requirement for\r\nvideotaping the reading of the Miranda rights (which is now included as part of the\r\nincident site videotape requirements). See S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2953(A)(2)(a)–\r\n(b) (Supp. 2012).\r\n6   In Parker, this Court announced a test for laying a breath test foundation:\r\n\r\n         Prior to admitting such evidence, the State may be required to prove\r\n         (1) that the machine was in proper working order at the time of the\r\n         test; (2) that the correct chemicals had been used; (3) that the accused\r\n         was not allowed to put anything in his mouth for 20 minutes prior to\r\n         the test[;] and (4) that the test was administered by a qualified person\r\n         in the proper manner.\r\n\nat 453–54. Finding that the General Assembly enacted subsection 56-5-\r\n2953(A)(2)(d) in 1998 with the implied consent statute in mind, the court of\r\nappeals found that the phrase \"required twenty-minute pre-test waiting period\" was\r\ndirectly linked to the reasoning of Parker and Jansen, and consequently, where a\r\n\"breath test is refused, the twenty-minute waiting period is not required and\r\ntherefore, need not be videotaped.\" Id. at 335, 721 S.E.2d at 453–54.\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals further found its reading to be consistent with the\r\nlegislative purpose behind the requirement, stating \"[h]ere, the primary intention\r\nbehind section 56-5-2953 was to reduce the number of DUI trials heard as\r\nswearing contests by mandating the State videotape important events in the process\r\nof collecting DUI evidence.\" Elwell, 396 S.C. at 336, 721 S.E.2d at 454 (footnote\r\nomitted). Therefore, \"the statute ensures the attempt to establish the breath test's\r\nreliability need not endure such swearing contests\" and when a breath test is given,\r\n\"the waiting period's videotaping provides evidence that helps resolve credibility\r\ndisputes as to the procedure used in administering the breath test.\" Id. However,\r\nwhere no breath test is given, the court of appeals found \"none of those credibility\r\ndisputes will arise.\" Id. Finally the court reasoned:\r\n\r\n      The statute must be interpreted with realistic circumstances and\r\n      rationales in mind, and this interpretation follows that approach. See\r\n      State v. Baker, 310 S.C. 510, 512, 427 S.E.2d 670, 672 (1993) (\"A\r\n      statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair\r\n      interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the\r\n      lawmakers.\"). Our interpretation does not require a police officer to\r\n      turn off the video recorder after the person refuses to take the test, nor\r\n      does it frustrate the statute's general requirement that a person arrested\r\n      for DUI \"have his conduct at . . . the breath test site videotaped.\" §\r\n      56–5–2953(A). In all cases, the videotape must still include the person\r\n      being informed he is being videotaped, being informed he may refuse\r\n      the test, and refusing the breath test if he in fact does so. See S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParker at 163, 245 S.E.2d at 906. In Jansen, the Court held that the State was not\r\nrequired to abide by the waiting period requirement in implied consent cases when\r\na suspect refuses to take a breath test, stating \"[T]he Parker precautions are\r\nintended to ensure that the results of the breathalyzer test if given are accurate and\r\nreliable as evidence at trial,\" and therefore, the precautions were futile if no test\r\nwas administered. Jansen, at 322, 408 S.E.2d at 237.\r\n\n      Code Ann. § 56–5–2953(A)(2)(b)–(c) (Supp. 2007). Accordingly, if a\r\n      person refuses to take the breath test, dismissal of a DUI charge is not\r\n      warranted for the failure to videotape the person's conduct for twenty\r\n      minutes so long as the other requirements of subsection 56–5–2953\r\n      (A)(2) are satisfied.\r\n\r\nId. at 336–37, 721 S.E.2d at 454 (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\n       The State argues that section 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) does not require a law\r\nenforcement officer to videotape the entire twenty-minute pre-test waiting period\r\nonce the arrestee refuses a breath test. Elwell argues that his case is simple, in that\r\nthe videotape was produced, it was incomplete and therefore the statute was\r\nviolated. Moreover, Elwell interprets the statute's repeated reference to \"conduct\"\r\nto mean that the State is required to videotape all conduct, not just pre-test\r\nconduct, for the full twenty minutes. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       \"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is a court must ascertain and give\r\neffect to the intent of the legislature.\" State v. Scott, 351 S.C. 584, 588, 571 S.E.2d\r\n700, 702 (2002) (citing Charleston Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. State Budget & Control Bd.,\r\n313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993)). \"What a legislature says in the text of a statute is\r\nconsidered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will.\" Id. (quoting Norman\r\nJ. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction § 46.03 at 94 (5th ed. 1992)).\r\nTherefore, \"[i]f a statute's language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear\r\nmeaning 'the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no\r\nright to impose another meaning.'\" Id. (quoting Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85,\r\n533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000)); see also State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 561, 647\r\nS.E.2d 144, 161 (2007) (\"All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the\r\nmaxim that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the\r\nlanguage used.\" (citing McClanahan v. Richland Cnty. Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438,\r\n567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002))). However, penal statutes will be strictly construed\r\nagainst the state. Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332, 342, 713 S.E.2d\r\n278, 283 (2011) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n       In our opinion, the inclusion of the term \"pre-test\" plainly requires a breath\r\ntest be administered for the video requirement to apply, and if there is no test, the\r\nstatute does not require a videotape. Otherwise, the legislature would not have\r\nincluded the \"pre-test\" modifier. See, e.g., Breeden v. TCW, Inc./Tennessee Exp.,\r\n355 S.C. 112, 120, 584 S.E.2d 379, 383 (2003) (stating \"[e]very word, clause, and\r\nsentence must be given some meaning, force, and effect, if it can be done by any\r\n\nreasonable construction.\" (citation omitted)); Davenport v. City of Rock Hill, 315\r\nS.C. 114, 117, 432 S.E.2d 451, 453 (1993) (\"It is never to be supposed that a single\r\nword was inserted in the law of this state without the intention of thereby\r\nconveying some meaning.\" (citation omitted)); cf. Pittman, 373 S.C. at 561, 647\r\nS.E.2d at 161 (\"Whenever possible, legislative intent should be found in the plain\r\nlanguage of the statute itself.\" (citation omitted)). Moreover, we agree with the\r\nElwell court's interpretation concerning the inclusion the term \"required\" in the\r\nstatute. The court of appeals correctly and reasonably interpreted the pre-\r\ncodification Parker and Jansen decisions to interpret the statute, concluding that\r\nonly when the waiting period is required can the videotape recording also be\r\nrequired. On the other hand, if no test is administered, then the waiting period is\r\nrendered unnecessary, and so then is the videotape recording of that waiting\r\nperiod.Furthermore, we agree with the court of appeals' analysis concerning the\r\nlegislative purpose behind the videotape requirements. In Roberts, this Court\r\nstated that \"the purpose of section 56-5-2953 . . . is to create direct evidence of a\r\nDUI arrest.\" Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332, 347, 713 S.E.2d 278,\r\n285 (2011). Once an arrestee refuses the breath test, the evidence gathering\r\nportion is over. As a consequence, we agree with the State that once Elwell\r\nrefused the test and no breath test was administered, the statute did not require the\r\narresting officer to continue to videotape the twenty-minute pre-test waiting period,\r\nand therefore, the videotape produced at trial complied with the statutory\r\nrequirements. To require otherwise, would result in the officer having to undergo a\r\nuseless and absurd act. See Leviner v. S.C. Dep't of Highways and Pub. Transp.,\r\n313 S.C. 409, 412, 438 S.E.2d 246, 248 (1993) (\"[I]t is unreasonable to expect an\r\narresting officer to consider a refusal as conditional so that he must remain near the\r\narrested person for an extended period of time. The arresting officer would be\r\nrequired to forsake other duties to arrange for a belated test that the motorist had\r\nalready refused after receiving warnings of the consequences of his\r\nnoncompliance.\" (footnote omitted)).\r\n\r\n       Elwell argues that the remedy for the State's noncompliance is provided in\r\nCity of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 646 S.E.2d 879 (2007). Suchenski is\r\ninapplicable under the present facts. In that case, the respondent was arrested for\r\nDUI and was later indicted for DUAC (driving with an unlawful alcohol\r\nconcentration). Suchenski, 374 S.C. at 14, 646 S.E.2d at 879. At the incident site,\r\nthe arresting officer's video equipment malfunctioned, and the respondent moved\r\nto dismiss the charges based on the officer's failure to provide a \"complete\"\r\n\nvideotape from the incident site. Id. The municipality argued that the case should\r\nnot have been dismissed. Id. at 16, 646 S.E.2d at 880–81. The Court found that\r\n\"[u]nder § 56-5-2953, a violation of the statute, with no mention of prejudice, may\r\nresult in dismissal of the charges.\" Id. at 16, 646 S.E.2d at 881. Therefore, Elwell\r\nargues that in the present case, where a complete videotape was not produced, the\r\nCourt should uphold the dismissal of the charges due to the State's violation of the\r\nstatute. We agree that the proper remedy in this case for failure to comply with the\r\nstatutory requirements elucidated in section 56-5-2953 would be dismissal.\r\nHowever, because no statutory violation occurred in this case, we need not rely on\r\nSuchenski for a remedy here.       CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appeals' decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n      PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27260","title":"Alexander v.

We reverse and remand.                                 I.\r\nIn 1988, the Barnwell County Council (the Council or Respondents) passed an\r\nordinance creating the Board of Trustees (the Board) for the Barnwell County\r\nHospital (the Hospital). The ordinance stated the Board was created \"for the\r\npurposes of operating and maintaining adequate hospital facilities for the residents\r\nof Barnwell County[,]\" and delineated the powers and duties of the Board.1 The\r\nordinance also described the composition of the Board, set term limits, and\r\nprovided members annual compensation. Over the years, the Council has passed\r\nvarious ordinances related to the Board.\r\n\r\nAppellants, former Board members, allege that in 2009, during their time of\r\nservice on the Board, the Council was developing a strategy in conjunction with\r\nBamberg and Allendale Counties to close the respective county hospitals and\r\ncreate one hospital for all three counties. Appellants assert the Council embarked\r\nupon various detrimental actions against the Hospital in connection with the\r\nstrategy and maintain these actions financially crippled the Hospital. According to\r\nAppellants, when they resisted the Council's plan, which included the Hospital\r\nfiling for bankruptcy, the Council voted to remove Appellants from the Board and\r\nappointed themselves as Board members. The Council, in their new, self-\r\nappointed status as Board members, placed the Hospital in bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nAppellants filed an action seeking a declaration that the Council violated the\r\nconstitutional prohibition against dual office holding when it assumed positions as\r\nBoard members. In response, the Council filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to\r\nRule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, for failure to state a claim. The Council argued the claim\r\npresented a non-justiciable political question, and the dual office prohibition was\r\nnot violated by what it termed a \"vertical\" duality. Specifically, the Council\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n1The powers and duties include, but are not limited to, the authority to: adopt\r\nbylaws; operate the Hospital and its facilities; accept gifts, donations, and devises;\r\nimprove and maintain the Hospital facilities; establish rates charged by the\r\nHospital; contract; expend the proceeds derived from revenue generated; sue and\r\nbe sued; employ various personnel; establish personnel policies; and adopt a\r\nbudget to be approved by the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n \r\n\r\n\r\ncontended that because the Board is a sub-entity of the Council, the two offices\r\nrepresented vertical, rather than horizontal, duality which does not run afoul of the\r\nConstitution. They cited no authority to support this unique theory.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court granted the Council's motion to dismiss, finding the issue was a\r\nnon-justiciable political question. Nevertheless, the circuit court addressed and\r\nrejected the dual office holding challenge. Appellants filed a notice of appeal, and\r\nthe appeal was certified to this Court, pursuant to Rule 204, SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                         II.\r\n\r\n                                         A.\r\n\r\nAppellants first contend the circuit court erred in holding the issue presented was a\r\nnon-justiciable political question. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the\r\nseparation of powers.\" Segars-Andrews v. Judicial Merit Selection Comm'n, 387\r\nS.C. 109, 121, 691 S.E.2d 453, 460 (2010) (quoting S.C. Pub. Interest Found. v.\r\nJudicial Merit Selection Comm'n, 369 S.C. 139, 142, 632 S.E.2d 277, 278 (2006)).\r\n\"The fundamental characteristic of a nonjusticiable 'political question' is that its\r\nadjudication would place a court in conflict with a coequal branch of government.\"\r\nId. at 122, 691 S.E.2d at 460 (quoting S.C. Pub. Interest Found., 369 S.C. at 142-\r\n43, 632 S.E.2d at 278). \"In the instance of nonjusticiability, consideration of the\r\ncause is not wholly and immediately foreclosed; rather, the Court's inquiry\r\nnecessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be\r\njudicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection\r\nfor the right asserted can be judicially molded.\" Id. (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369\r\nU.S. 186, 198 (1962)). Indeed, the political question doctrine \"is one of 'political\r\nquestions,' not one of 'political cases.'\" Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962).\r\n\"The courts cannot reject as 'no law suit' a bona fide controversy as to whether\r\nsome action denominated 'political' exceeds constitutional authority.\" Id.\r\nTherefore, \"this Court is duty bound to review the actions of the Legislature when\r\nit is alleged in a properly filed suit that such actions are unconstitutional[.]\"\r\nSegars-Andrews, 387 S.C. at 123, 691 S.E.2d at 460.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court erred in dismissing Appellants' claim as a nonjusticiable political\r\nquestion. A court must conduct a limited examination of the matter when it is\r\nargued a non-justiciable political question is presented. Here, Appellants do not\r\nchallenge the wisdom of the Council's actions or the process by which this\r\n\r\n \r\n\n \r\n\r\n\r\nsituation developed. Nor do Appellants contest the broad powers granted to\r\ncounties by the legislature.2 Rather, Appellants make a specific and concrete\r\nassertion that due to Respondents' actions, Respondents now hold two offices for\r\nhonor or profit in violation of the Constitution. This question presents a bona fide\r\nlegal challenge which is proper for judicial resolution.       B.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution provides: \"No person may hold two offices of\r\nhonor or profit at the same time.\" S.C. Const. art. VI, § 3. To be considered an\r\noffice for purposes of the dual office holding provision, it must be demonstrated\r\nthat \"'the power of appointment comes from the state, the authority is derived from\r\nthe law, and the duties are exercised for the benefit of the public.'\" Segars-\r\nAndrews, 387 S.C. at 124, 691 S.E.2d at 461 (quoting Willis v. Aiken County, 203\r\nS.C. 96, 103, 26 S.E.2d 313, 316 (1943)). Furthermore, \"'[t]he powers conferred\r\nand the duties to be discharged with regard to a public office must be defined,\r\ndirectly or impliedly, by the legislature or through legislative authority.'\" Id.\r\nquoting (63C Am Jur.2d Public Officers and Employees § 5 (2009)).\r\n\r\nThe Council concedes, as it must, that service on the Board constitutes an office in\r\nthe constitutional sense.3 See Op. S.C. Att'y Gen., 2007 WL 655610, at *1-2\r\n(2007) (finding service on the Board is a constitutional office). Indeed, the\r\nordinance creating the Board establishes the specifics of Board composition and\r\nmembership, and contains an extensive list of powers and duties afforded to the\r\nmembers of the Board.\r\n\r\nDespite its concession, the Council asserts there is no constitutional violation in\r\nserving in more than one office. The Council contends its duality is vertical, rather\r\n                                                            \r\n2 With the passage of the Home Rule Act, S.C. Code Ann. §§ 4-9-10 -1210 (Supp.\r\n2012), and specifically section 4-9-30(6), counties were granted broad powers to\r\nestablish, regulate, merge or abolish such boards, agencies, departments and\r\npositions as may be necessary and proper. See also S.C. Const. Art. VIII, § 7\r\n(\"The General Assembly shall provide by general law for the structure,\r\norganization, powers, duties, functions and the responsibilities of counties . . . .\").\r\nIt is this broad grant of power which the Council asserts renders the claim at hand a\r\nnon-justiciable political question.\r\n3Likewise, it is undisputed that service on the Council is an office in the\r\nconstitutional sense.\r\n\r\n \r\n\n \r\n\r\n\r\nthan horizontal, and is therefore constitutional. The Council's argument\r\nmisapprehends the prohibition on dual office holding.4 See Ashmore v. Greater\r\nGreenville Sewer Dist., 211 S.C. 77, 89-90, 44 S.E.2d 88, 94 (1947) (\"The\r\nproposition seems to us to prove itself, that a member cannot sit upon the board of\r\nauditorium trustees established in the act under review and at the same time retain\r\nhis membership in the General Assembly. The language of the fundamental law is\r\nplain and unambiguous. It admits of no doubt of its meaning.\"). Membership on\r\nthe Board is a separate and distinct constitutional office, and the Council has not\r\nasserted its service on the Board is in an ex officio capacity supported by a\r\nconstitutional nexus. Given the record before us, we are constrained to conclude\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n4 The most prominent exception to the dual office prohibition is the ex officio or\r\nincidental duties exception, which provides that \"dual office holding in violation of\r\nthe constitution is not applicable to those officers upon whom other duties relating\r\nto their respective offices are placed by law.\" Segars-Andrews (quoting Ashmore\r\nv. Greater Greenville Sewer Dist., 211 S.C. 77, 92, 44 S.E.2d 88, 95 (1947)). \"A\r\ncommon example is ex officio membership upon a board or commission of the unit\r\nof government which the officer serves in his official capacity, and the functions of\r\nthe board or commission are related to the duties of the office.\" Ashmore, 211 S.C.\r\nat 92, 44 S.E.2d at 95 (emphasis added). This exception \"may properly be invoked\r\nonly where there is a constitutional nexus in terms of power and responsibilities\r\nbetween the first office and the 'ex officio' office.\" Segars-Andrews, 387 S.C. at\r\n126, 691 S.E.2d at 462.\r\n\r\nRespondents briefly referenced the ex officio argument in their memorandum in\r\nsupport of the motion to dismiss, but the circuit court did not rule on the issue.\r\nMoreover, Respondents do not present on appeal the ex officio argument as an\r\nadditional sustaining ground. Correspondingly, Appellants have not addressed the\r\nex officio exception in briefing. While a respondent may raise on appeal any\r\nadditional sustaining grounds appearing in the record, even where those reasons\r\nhave not been ruled on by the lower court, we are reticent to invoke an alternative\r\nsustaining ground where the ground is not raised in the appellate brief. I'On, LLC\r\nv. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419-20, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000)\r\n(recognizing that a respondent may abandon an additional sustaining ground by\r\nfailing to raise it in the appellate brief). Invoking an additional sustaining ground\r\nunder such circumstances would generally be unfair to an unaware appellant. We\r\nemphasize that we do not intimate that the ex officio exception applies in this case.\r\nWe merely observe that we do not reach that issue in light of the general\r\nframework concerning additional sustaining grounds.\r\n\r\n \r\n\n \r\n\r\n\r\nRespondents' simultaneous service on the Council and the Board constitutes\r\nimproper dual office holding in violation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court erred in granting the motion to dismiss Appellants' declaratory\r\njudgment action, and we reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, and HEARN, JJ., concur.
