Bauer, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and \r\n  respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant \r\n  to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and \r\n  agrees to either an admonition or a public reprimand.Â  We accept the agreement \r\n  and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are \r\n  as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was the physician and family friend of M.C., an eighteen year old \r\n  woman.Â  On April 16, 1996, respondent prescribed an anti-depressant for M.C.; \r\n  she took the medication throughout the time of the incident pertinent to this \r\n  matter.\r\nOn May 3, 1996, respondent accompanied M.C. to dinner, a nightclub, and his \r\n  home and he consumed alcoholic beverages at each location.Â  M.C. drank a portion \r\n  of a light beer at respondentâ€™s home.Â  At his home, respondent began to kiss \r\n  and fondle M.C.Â  M.C. expressed her desire to end the episode and called friends \r\n  to pick her up from respondentâ€™s home. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn May 31, 1999, the State Board of Medical Examiners issued an order publicly \r\n  reprimanding respondent, fining him $10,000, and indefinitely suspending his \r\n  license to practice medicine pending successful completion of an acceptable \r\n  psychological and behavioral assessment program. [1] Â  By order dated February 17, 2002, the State \r\n  Board of Medical Examiners reinstated respondentâ€™s medical license in a probationary \r\n  status until respondentâ€™s compliance with specified terms and conditions.Â Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent agrees to comply with the February 17, 2002 Supplemental Order of \r\n  the State Board of Medical Examiners and to notifyÂ  ODC of any change in the \r\n  status of his license to practice medicine.Â  ODC reserves the right to take \r\n  further action as to this matter based on any change in the status of respondentâ€™s \r\n  license to practice medicine.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that he has committed a criminal act (simple assault) and \r\n  that this misconduct violates Rule 8.4(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR.Â  See Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for \r\n  a lawyer to commit a criminal act which reflects adversely upon his honesty, \r\n  trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer in other respects).Â  In addition, respondent \r\n  admits he has violated Rule 8.4(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  See \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes \r\n  grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (it shall be \r\n  a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct). \r\n\r\nWe find that respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent \r\n  for his misconduct.

[1] Â  Because the saltwater contamination \r\n  of the lagoons has allegedly damaged the golf course, Scratch Golf filed a cause \r\n  of action for breach of contract and negligence against the Developer and the \r\n  Dunes West Property Owners Association.Â  \r\nMeanwhile, based on its concern that it would be unable to collect on a judgment \r\n  entered against the Developer, Scratch Golf argued before the Master that he \r\n  should grant a preliminary injunction in order to capture some of the Developerâ€™s \r\n  assets before the undeveloped Dunes West property was sold to John Weiland Homes.Â  \r\n  Scratch Golf asserted that the total damages caused by the saltwater contamination \r\n  were $6 million, which represents the cost of rebuilding much of the golf course.Â  \r\n  The Developer, however, asserted that the damages amount to $600,000. [2] Â Â Â  \r\nThe Master granted Scratch Golfâ€™s motion for a preliminary injunction and set \r\n  an escrow amount at $4.5 million.Â  In addition, pursuant to Rule 65, SCRCP, \r\n  the Master held that Scratch Golf would purchase a $1 million bond as security \r\n  in the event the Developer was wrongfully enjoined.Â  The Developer has appealed \r\n  the Masterâ€™s ruling, and pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, this Court certified \r\n  the case from the court of appeals.\r\nThe Developer raises the following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;\r\n    Did the Master have the authority to issue the \r\n      preliminary injunction?&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did the Master err in finding that Scratch Golf \r\n      presented sufficient evidence to justify an injunction?&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did the Master err in setting the amount of Scratch \r\n      Golfâ€™s bond at $1 million?&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review \r\nUpon review of an action in equity, this Court may make factual findings based \r\n  on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes Associates, \r\n  Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\n I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Authority to Issue an Injunction\r\nThe Developer asserts that the \r\n  Master did not have the authority to issue the preliminary injunction that poured \r\n  $4.5 million of the Developerâ€™s assets into an escrow account.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Developer relies on a United \r\n  States Supreme Court decision, Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance \r\n  Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 119 S. Ct. 1961 (1999), which held that a \r\n  U.S. District Court was not authorized to issue a preliminary injunction -- \r\n  absent a prior attachment of a money judgment -- because the remedy was historically \r\n  unavailable in a federal court of equity.Â  This decision limiting a federal \r\n  courtâ€™s equitable powers is not dispositive of whether a state court judge may \r\n  restrain a defendantâ€™s assets prior to the attachment of a money judgment.Â  \r\n  There is no federal question here that would cause the Grupo decision \r\n  to be binding in this state court proceeding.Â  Thus we decline to apply the \r\n  Grupo analysis to this matter.\r\n II.&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriateness of the Preliminary Injunction\r\nThe Developer asserts that the \r\n  Master erred in granting the preliminary injunction because Scratch Golf did \r\n  not present sufficient evidence to establish that injunctive relief was appropriate.Â  \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nAn injunction is a drastic remedy issued by the court in its discretion to \r\n  prevent irreparable harm suffered by the plaintiff.Â  Flanagan, S.C. Civil \r\n  Procedure, 507 (2d ed. 1996).Â  For a preliminary injunction to be granted, \r\n  the plaintiff must establish hat (1) it would suffer irreparable harm if the \r\n  injunction is not granted: (2) it will likely succeed on the merits of the litigation; \r\n  and (3) there is an inadequate remedy at law.Â  County of Richland v. Simkins, \r\n  348 S.C. 664, 669, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nAlthough Scratch Golf may be able \r\n  to satisfy elements 1 and 2, it cannot satisfy element 3 because there was an \r\n  alternative remedy at law available for Scratch Golf: the statutory remedy of \r\n  attachment.Â  Therefore, an injunction was not the appropriate remedy. \r\nAt the preliminary injunction \r\n  hearings, Scratch Golf argued that if an injunction were not granted, it would \r\n  suffer irreparable harm having no adequate legal remedy to recover the proceeds \r\n  from the sale of Dunes West in order to satisfy the potential judgment it would \r\n  have against the Developer.Â  Scratch Golf feared that the Developerâ€™s $1 million \r\n  umbrella insurance policy, the Property Ownerâ€™s Association $1 million umbrella \r\n  insurance policy, or any leftover proceeds from the sale of the development \r\n  would not be available to satisfy a judgment.Â  Scratch Golf further argued that \r\n  even if there were leftover proceeds from the sale, the Developer would take \r\n  the proceeds out of the state to invest elsewhere, making it difficult for Scratch \r\n  Golf to recover its judgment interest from those proceeds.Â  \r\nThis argument that Scratch Golf \r\n  asserted -- that once it receives a money judgment from its contract and tort \r\n  action, it may have difficulty collecting from the Developer because \r\n  the Developer may â€œtake its assets and runâ€ out of the state -- is not proper \r\n  justification for why a preliminary injunction should be issued but rather is \r\n  justification for the statutory remedy of attachment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-19-10 \r\n  (2003), the attachment statute, provides:\r\nIn any action:\r\n\r\n  (8) When any person or corporation is about to remove any of his or its property \r\n    from this State, or has assigned, disposed of or secreted or is about to assign, \r\n    dispose of or secrete any of his or its property with intent to defraud creditors \r\n    as mentioned in this chapter;\r\n  The plaintiff at the time of issuing the summons or any time afterwards may \r\n    have the property of such defendant or corporation attached, in the manner \r\n    prescribed in this chapter, as a security for the satisfaction of such judgment \r\n    as the plaintiff may recover.\r\n\r\nAs this Court has stated, â€œ[t]he purpose of attachment generally is to take \r\n  a defendantâ€™s property into legal custody so that it may be applied to the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  debt, when established.â€Â  John Deere Plow Co. of St. Louis v. L.D. Jennings, \r\n  Inc., 203 S.C. 426, 27 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1952).Â  Â â€œ[A]n attachment is merely \r\n  a provisional remedy in aid of an action, and hence, to make it available, an \r\n  action must be commenced in regular form.â€Â  Williamson v. Eastern Bldg. Assâ€™n., \r\n  54 S.C. 582, 32 S.E. 765, 770 (1899) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nWe find Scratch Golfâ€™s argument that a preliminary injunction was necessary \r\n  to protect its pre-judgment interest in the Developerâ€™s property should have \r\n  been an argument justifying the necessity of an attachment.Â  Due to the confusing \r\n  and unusual posture of this case, we remand this matter to the Master so that \r\n  the parties may argue the merits of whether an attachment -- not an injunction \r\n  -- may be litigated pursuant to the attachment statute.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe remand the matter to the Master \r\n  for further proceedings to evaluate the attachment issue.Â  We preserve the status \r\n  quo, both the escrow of $4.5 million and the $1 million surety bond, until the \r\n  Master issues an order resolving the attachment question.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The saltwater inflow occurs during an above-average high tide. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  This amount comes from the affidavit of the Director of Golf Course \r\n    Management at Kiawah Island Club, Tommy Witt, who is not an expert in engineering \r\n    or plant and soil science.Â  These damage figures only cover replacing dead \r\n    grass and not replacing contaminated soil.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of H.

[1] Â  Respondents United HealthCare Services (UHS), \r\n  United Health Group (UHG), and United HealthCare Insurance (UHI), (collectively \r\n  â€œUnitedâ€), provide managed health care services for HMOâ€™s.Â  \r\nIn 1984, CCP and UHS entered into an \r\n  Administrative Services Agreement, whereby UHS agreed to provide various services \r\n  in furtherance of CCPâ€™s business as a South Carolina HMO.Â  CCP had few, if any, \r\n  employees, and outsourced virtually all of its work to United.Â  \r\nÂ \r\nIn 1996, the parties entered into a new \r\n  agreement.Â  Section 11.14 of the 1996 Services Agreement stated that:\r\n\r\n[a]ny controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating \r\n  to this Agreement or a breach of the Agreement, except as otherwise provided \r\n  shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the \r\n  American Arbitration Association.Â  Upon such submission, UHS and [CCP] shall \r\n  each choose one arbitrator and those two arbitrators shall mutually agree on \r\n  the selection of the third arbitrator.Â  Matters submitted to arbitration shall \r\n  be determined by a majority vote of the arbitrators, and such decision shall \r\n  be binding upon the parties.Â  The arbitrators shall have no power to award any \r\n  punitive or exemplary damages or to vary or ignore the terms of this Agreement \r\n  and shall be bound by controlling law.Â  It is the intent of the parties that \r\n  all disputes arising under this Agreement which are not otherwise resolved be \r\n  resolved by binding arbitration and not by other forms of legal proceedings. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn May 2001, CCP filed suit against UHS, \r\n  UHG, UHI, Ronald Harms, and Edward Graves.Â  Harms was a former chief financial \r\n  officer of CCP, and Graves was a former chief executive officer of CCP.Â  Harms \r\n  and Graves were United employees at the time they served on the CCP board of \r\n  directors, and are still employed by United.Â  CCP alleged, among other things, \r\n  that all the defendants failed to cooperate in good faith with CCP to promote \r\n  CCPâ€™s economic interests, failed to properly account for funds that United held \r\n  as a fiduciary to CCP, and generally put the economic interests of United ahead \r\n  of CCP.&nbsp; \r\nUnited moved to dismiss or stay the proceedings \r\n  and compel arbitration.Â  In response, CCP filed an amended complaint, which \r\n  included new causes of action for fraud, fraud in the inducement, and fraudulent \r\n  concealment in the making of the arbitration clause.Â  CCP also alleged that \r\n  the arbitration provision was unconscionable and violated South Carolina public \r\n  policy because it limited discovery and limited CCPâ€™s rights and remedies under \r\n  the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA).&nbsp; \r\nUnited moved to dismiss the three causes \r\n  of action related to the making of the arbitration clause pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \r\n  SCRCP, for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  \r\n  United argued the arbitration agreement was valid and enforceable, and that \r\n  the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) required that all of the claims be submitted \r\n  to arbitration.Â  \r\nCCP moved to file a second amended complaint, which the trial court granted.Â  \r\n  However, the trial court then granted Unitedâ€™s motion to compel arbitration \r\n  and to dismiss three of CCPâ€™s causes of action related to the making of the \r\n  arbitration clause. [2] Â  The trial court also ruled that the inclusion \r\n  of defendants Harms and Graves as defendants did not defeat Unitedâ€™s right to \r\n  arbitrate the dispute, despite the fact that Harms and Graves were not parties \r\n  to the 1996 Services Agreement containing the arbitration clause.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial court ordered that the remaining claims be arbitrated pursuant to \r\n  the rules of the American Arbitration Association and stayed the proceedings \r\n  pending the outcome of arbitration.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in dismissing CCPâ€™s causes of action for fraud,\r\n          unconscionability, and a violation of public policy pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2.&nbsp;\r\n        &nbsp;Did the trial court err in finding that the arbitration clause was \r\n  applicable to individual defendants and in staying the remaining claims pending \r\n  arbitration?Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n12(b)(6) Motions\r\nCCP contends the trial court erred in dismissing the causes of action for fraudulent \r\n  inducement, unconscionability, and violation of public policy pursuant to Rule \r\n  12(b)(6).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss must be based solely \r\n  upon the allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, \r\n  333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d 69, 73 (1999); Washington v. Lexington County \r\n  Jail, 337 S.C. 400, 405, 523 S.E.2d 204, 206 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  A 12(b)(6) \r\n  motion should not be granted if the facts alleged and the inferences reasonably \r\n  deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any theory \r\n  of the case.Â  Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 5, 522 S.E.2d 137, 139 (1999).Â  \r\n  The question to be considered is whether, when viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the plaintiff, the complaint states any valid claim for relief.Â  Further, \r\n  the complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff \r\n  will prevail.Â  Gentry, id. at 5, 522 S.E.2d at 139.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Fraud and Concealment\r\nSouth Carolina law generally favors arbitration.Â  McMillan v. Gold \r\n  Kist, Inc., 353 S.C. 353, 359, 577 S.E.2d 482, 485 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In \r\n  interpreting agreements within the scope of the FAA, â€œdue regard must be given \r\n  to the federal policy favoring arbitration, and ambiguities as to the scope \r\n  of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration.â€Â  Stokes \r\n  v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 606, 610, 571 S.E.2d 711, 714 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002) (quoting Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees \r\n  of Leland Stanford Junior University, 489 U.S. 468, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 \r\n  L.Ed.2d 488 (1989)).Â  Any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should \r\n  be resolved in favor of arbitration.Â  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Associates, \r\n  346 S.C. 580, 597, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â  Further, unless the Court can \r\n  say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to \r\n  an interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should be ordered.Â  Id. \r\n  at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118.\r\nA written provision in any contract evidencing a transaction involving \r\n  commerce to settle by arbitration shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, \r\n  save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any \r\n  contract.Â  9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2 (2000).Â  A party cannot avoid arbitration through \r\n  rescission of an entire contract when there is no independent challenge to the \r\n  arbitration clause itself.Â  There must be fraud in the inducement of the arbitration \r\n  agreement to avoid arbitration of the contract.Â  South Carolina Pub. Serv. \r\n  Auth. v. Great Western Coal (Kentucky), Inc., 312 S.C. 559, 562-63, 437 \r\n  S.E.2d 22, 24 (1993) (citing Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. \r\n  Co., 388 U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.E.2d 1270 (1967)).Â  â€œFraud as a defense \r\n  to an arbitration clause must be fraud specifically as to the arbitration \r\n  clause and not the contract generally.â€Â  South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth., \r\n  id. at 563, 437 S.E.2d at 24 (emphasis added).Â Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, CCP alleged that at the time it was considering \r\n  and negotiating the 1996 Services Agreement with United, CCP relied on and utilized \r\n  the employees and services of United to run virtually all of CCPâ€™s business.Â  \r\n  Further, CCP had no employees of its own, and used United employees to fill \r\n  all of its officer positions. \r\nCCP alleged that, during the 1996 negotiations, Bill Martin [3]  was both its CEO and a paid employee of UHS.Â  CCP alleged that \r\n  as its CEO, Martin was responsible for negotiating and reviewing proposed contracts.Â  \r\n  CCP further alleged that Martin failed to object to the inclusion of the arbitration \r\n  clause in the 1996 Services Agreement because Martin knew United had committed \r\n  various torts and other wrongful acts against CCP and Martin knew that United \r\n  planned to commit additional torts and wrongful acts against CCP in the future.Â  \r\n  Alternatively, CCP alleged that Martin knew United inserted the arbitration \r\n  clause into the 1996 Services to limit CCPâ€™s ability to discover the extent \r\n  of Unitedâ€™s misconduct and to limit its ability to recover punitive or exemplary \r\n  damages.Â  CCP further alleged that Martin failed to disclose to CCPâ€™s board \r\n  of directors why United wanted the arbitration clause included or to explain \r\n  the impact of the provision, and that Martin told CCPâ€™s board that the 1996 \r\n  Services Agreement was merely changing the method of payment between CCP and \r\n  United.Â  \r\nThe trial court found that the pleadings failed to state a claim that \r\n  CCP was fraudulently induced into agreeing to the arbitration provision.Â  The \r\n  trial court found that any reliance on the alleged misconduct only went to the \r\n  entire 1996 Services Agreement and not solely to the arbitration clause.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial court ruled that, pursuant to Prima Paint, any claims regarding \r\n  the making of the 1996 Service Agreement must be arbitrated.Â  \r\nCCP argues on appeal that the fraud alleged in the complaint is particular to \r\n  the arbitration clause and does not go to the entire agreement.Â  CCP essentially \r\n  alleges that the contract was procured through fraud and that the arbitration \r\n  clause was a vehicle used by United to further the fraud, to prevent its discovery, \r\n  and to prevent recovery if the fraud was discovered.Â  CCP also argues that, \r\n  had Martin performed his duties as CEO and informed CCP that United was committing \r\n  torts, breaches of the 1984 contract, and various other malfeasances against \r\n  CCP, CCP would never have agreed to a clause mandating arbitration and limiting \r\n  punitive damages. However, CCP claims that because United controlled so much \r\n  of its business and possessed so many of its records and files, CCP was held \r\n  captive by United and would have been forced to sign the 1996 Services Agreement \r\n  regardless of whether Martin informed CCP of Unitedâ€™s misconduct and its intent \r\n  to commit future misconduct. [4] Â  Therefore, CCP contends in its \r\n  brief that, had it known United was acting improperly, CCP would have still \r\n  signed the 1996 Services Agreement, but would not have agreed to the arbitration \r\n  clause within the contract. [5]   \r\nWe hold that CCP made no allegation of fraud specifically as to the arbitration \r\n  clause, but only challenged the contract generally in its assertion that United \r\n  committed fraud as to the contract.Â  CCP has not alleged that United lied or \r\n  committed fraud to induce CCP to enter into the arbitration clause or that United \r\n  lied or misrepresented the effect of the arbitration agreement, its validity, \r\n  CCPâ€™s ability to recover punitive damages, or CCPâ€™s ability to demand a jury \r\n  trial.Â  Therefore, the issue of whether the entire contract was fraudulently \r\n  induced is the proper question here; meaning the matter must be decided in arbitration.Â  \r\n  South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth., id. at 563, 437 S.E.2d at 24.Â  \r\n\r\nThe dissent argues that CCPâ€™s allegation that the arbitration provision \r\n  was inserted to limit CCPâ€™s ability to discover the extent of the misconduct \r\n  and to limit punitive damages is sufficient under notice pleading rules to survive \r\n  a 12(b)(6) motion.Â  However, the dissent ignores the rationale behind Prima \r\n  Paint and the strong presumption favoring arbitration of disputes.Â  Further, \r\n  in very similar cases, other courts have held an allegation that an arbitration \r\n  clause was used to further a scheme to defraud is not sufficient to allege fraud \r\n  as to the arbitration clause specifically.Â  Garten v. Kurth, 265 F.3d 136, \r\n  133-44 (2nd Cir. 2001) (citing Campaniello Imports, Ltd., \r\n  v. Saporiti Italia, S.p.A., 117 F.3d 655 (2nd Cir. 1997) (where \r\n  there is merely a link between the arbitration clause and general fraud alleged \r\n  by the plaintiff, and nothing deficient in an arbitration clause itself, a plaintiff \r\n  may not establish a connection between the alleged fraud and the arbitration \r\n  clause merely by adding the allegation that the arbitration clause was a part \r\n  of the overall scheme to defraud); Phillips v. Home Equity Services, Inc., \r\n  179 F.Supp.2d 840, 845 (N.D. Ill. 2001) (where there was no evidence that the \r\n  defendants misrepresented the purpose or the operation of the arbitration clause, \r\n  there was no evidence to conclude that the parties never agreed to arbitrate \r\n  their dispute); Hayes Children Leasing Co. v. NCR Corp., 37 Cal.App.4th \r\n  775 (Cal. App. 1 Dist. 1995) (holding that it is not enough to allege that the \r\n  arbitration clause was inserted to further a fraudulent scheme; the question \r\n  in all cases simply is whether the agreement to arbitrate itself was induced \r\n  by some fraud).Â  \r\nWe can find no allegation in the complaint that the arbitration clause \r\n  itself was induced by fraud.Â  CCP has simply alleged that United was engaged \r\n  in fraudulent conduct throughout negotiations, and that the arbitration clause \r\n  was inserted in a scheme to further that fraud.Â  To follow the dissentâ€™s rationale \r\n  would violate the holding in Prima Paint \r\n  [6]  and undermine the policy favoring arbitration.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Unconscionability and Public Policy\r\nCCP argues that it adequately pled the arbitration provision was unconscionable \r\n  and in violation of public policy.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnconscionability has been recognized as the absence of meaningful choice on \r\n  the part of one party due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms \r\n  that are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair \r\n  and honest person would accept them.Â  Fanning v. Fritzâ€™s Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick, \r\n  Inc., 322 S.C. 399, 403, 472 S.E.2d 242, 245 (1996).\r\nThe trial court ruled that CCPâ€™s allegations of unconscionability and violation \r\n  of public policy as to the arbitration clause were based on the same claims \r\n  the trial court rejected; that had CCP known of the alleged misconduct by United \r\n  and Martin, it would have still entered into the 1996 Services Agreement but \r\n  would not have agreed to the arbitration clause.Â  Therefore, the trial court \r\n  dismissed both causes of action for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule \r\n  12(b)(6).Â Â Â  \r\nCCP argues it sufficiently pled the arbitration clause was unconscionable because \r\n  Martin, in his capacity as CEO, breached his fiduciary duties by acting in the \r\n  best interests of United.Â  Again, CCP argues that Martin should have informed \r\n  CCP about the arbitration clause and the rights being forsaken by CCP.Â  CCP \r\n  further contends the arbitration clause was one-sided in favor of United because \r\n  it prevents discovery [7]  and \r\n  prohibits an award of punitive damages.\r\nWe hold that CCP has failed to allege any facts that would show the clause was \r\n  unconscionable.Â  Both parties were sophisticated entities and, as United points \r\n  out in its brief, CCP was apparently represented by independent counsel.Â  While \r\n  CCP alleged it lacked a meaningful choice as to the entire contract, CCP has \r\n  simply failed to allege that it lacked a meaningful choice as to the arbitration \r\n  clause specifically.Â  Therefore, we agree with the trial courtâ€™s ruling that \r\n  any misconduct by Martin affected whether the entire agreement was unconscionable, \r\n  not simply the arbitration clause. \r\nAs to the substantive claim involving the public policy issue, CCP alleged that \r\n  because the clause sought to limit CCPâ€™s rights and remedies, the clause was \r\n  unenforceable as a matter of law.Â  In its complaint, CCP also alleged that its \r\n  rights and remedies under the SCUTPA were limited by the clause.Â  This Court \r\n  has not addressed whether it violates South Carolina public policy for parties \r\n  to voluntarily forgo punitive damages in an arbitration agreement.Â Â Â  \r\nThe general rule is that courts will not enforce a contract which is \r\n  violative of public policy, statutory law, or provisions of the Constitution.Â  \r\n  Beach Co. v. Twillman, Ltd., 351 S.C. 56, 64, 566 S.E.2d 863, 866-67 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â  As noted in 83 A.L.R.3d 1037, 1039 (1978):\r\n\r\ncourts in some cases have held that an arbitrator has the power, at least \r\n  in certain circumstances, to award punitive damages. Thus, the court in one \r\n  case has held that arbitrators possess the power, apparently without limitation \r\n  in a labor law context, to award punitive damages.Â  In other cases, however, \r\n  the courts have taken the position that arbitrators have the power to award \r\n  punitive damages only when they are given such power by express language in \r\n  the contract authorizing arbitration or in the submission papers.\r\n\r\nA number of courts in other jurisdictions have held that an arbitration \r\n  agreement limiting or excluding punitive damages is enforceable.Â  Martin \r\n  v. SCI Mgt. L.P., 296 F.Supp.2d 462 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (parties to an arbitration \r\n  agreement may expressly preclude an arbitrator from awarding punitive damages); \r\n  Investment Partners, L.P. v. Glamour Shots Licensing, Inc., 298 F.3d \r\n  314 (Miss. App. 2002) (holding provisions in arbitration agreements that prohibit \r\n  punitive damages are generally enforceable); 7-Eleven, Inc. v. Dar, 757 \r\n  N.E.2d 515 (Ill. App. 2001) (holding arbitrators may award punitive damages \r\n  only where the parties have expressly agreed to the arbitratorâ€™s authority to \r\n  award punitive damages). \r\nOther courts have held that an arbitration agreement excluding punitive \r\n  damages violates public policy.Â  Ex parte Thicklin, 824 So.2d 723 (Ala. \r\n  2002) (holding that it violates Alabama public policy for a party to contract \r\n  away its liability for punitive damages, regardless of whether the provision \r\n  was intended to operate in an arbitral or a judicial forum); State ex rel. \r\n  Dunlap v. Berger, 567 S.E.2d 265 (W. Va. 2002) (holding prohibitions on \r\n  punitive damages and class action relief that would be the result of the application \r\n  of a purchase and finance agreement are clearly unconscionable).\r\nCCP cites In re Managed Care Litig., 132 F.Supp.2d 989 (S.D. Fla. \r\n  2000), in support of its public policy argument.Â  In that case, the U.S. District \r\n  Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled that a similar clause \r\n  [8]  excluding punitive or exemplary damages was unenforceable as a matter \r\n  of public policy as it related to the plaintiffâ€™s RICO [9]  claims.Â  However, the United \r\n  States Supreme Court overturned that decision in PacifiCare Health Systems, \r\n  Inc. v. Book, 538 U.S. 401, 123 S.Ct. 1531, 155 L.Ed.2d 578 (2003).Â  The \r\n  Supreme Court held that the issue of whether statutory treble damages under \r\n  the RICO statute were barred was not yet ripe because there was some question \r\n  as to whether treble damages were punitive or compensatory, and it was unclear \r\n  how an arbitrator would rule on the issue.Â  PacifiCare, 538 U.S. at 1535-36.Â  \r\n\r\nBased on PacifiCare, it is clear an arbitrator may or may not \r\n  choose to award treble damages in accordance with the SCUTPA, depending upon \r\n  whether an arbitrator finds the SCUTPA was violated and whether the arbitrator \r\n  finds that statutory treble damages are punitive or compensatory damages.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we hold that the question of whether the clause preventing punitive damages \r\n  violates public policy as to the SCUTPA is not yet ripe because an arbitrator \r\n  has not ruled on the issue.Â  \r\nHowever, CCP is also seeking punitive damages in several common law causes \r\n  of action.Â  We hold that this issue is also not ripe for two reasons.Â  First, \r\n  it is unclear whether CCP will prevail on the merits in arbitration.Â  Second, \r\n  it is unclear whether an arbitrator would find that punitive damages are warranted.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we hold that any challenge that the clause violates public policy \r\n  is premature.Â  See Hawkins v. Aid Assn. for Lutherans, 338 F.3d \r\n  801 (7th Cir. 2003) (holding that complaints about the unavailability \r\n  of punitive damages must first be presented to the arbitrator).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, we note that our holding in no way limits CCPâ€™s ability \r\n  to pursue its claims of fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause, unconscionability, \r\n  and public policy violations in arbitration.Â  See Larryâ€™s United Super, \r\n  Inc. v. Werries, 253 F.3d 1083, 1086-87 (8th Cir. 2001) (holding that whether \r\n  federal public policy prohibits an individual from waiving certain statutory \r\n  remedies is an issue that may be raised when challenging an arbitratorâ€™s award).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Non-Signatory Defendants; Stay of Proceedings\r\nCCP also contends that, even assuming the arbitration clause is enforceable, \r\n  the claims against Harms and Graves fall outside of its scope and must be litigated.Â  \r\n  CCP also contends the trial court erred in staying the proceedings.Â  We disagree, \r\n  and hold that the trial courtâ€™s order is not immediately appealable.\r\nThis Court has \r\n  held that the FAA does not preempt South Carolina state law in regard to procedural \r\n  rules on the appealability of arbitration orders.Â  Tolerâ€™s Cove Homeowners \r\n  Assn., Inc. v. Trident Const. Co., Inc., 355 S.C. 605, 611, 586 S.E.2d 581, \r\n  584-85 (2003) (holding there is no federal policy favoring arbitration under \r\n  a certain set of procedural rules and the federal policy is simply to ensure \r\n  the enforceability of private agreements to arbitrate; therefore, South Carolina \r\n  law is not invalidating the arbitration agreement or undermining the goals and \r\n  policies of the FAA).Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-200(a) (2003), an \r\n  appeal may be taken from:\r\n\r\n(1) An order denying an \r\n  application to compel arbitration made under Â§ 15-48-20;\r\n(2) An order granting an \r\n  application to stay arbitration made under Â§ 15-48-20(b);\r\n(3) An order confirming \r\n  or denying confirmation of an award;\r\n(4) An order modifying or \r\n  correcting an award;\r\n(5) An order vacating an \r\n  award without directing a rehearing; or\r\n(6) A judgment or decree entered pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\r\n\r\nSection 15-48-200 does not expressly permit an appeal from \r\n  an order granting an application to compel arbitration or from an order to stay \r\n  claims pending arbitration.Â  Therefore, the order compelling arbitration of \r\n  the claims against Harms and Graves and staying the remaining claims is not \r\n  immediately appealable.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of CCPâ€™s fraud, public policy, \r\n  and unconscionability claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  Any claims related \r\n  to the making of the contract or the arbitration clause may be pursued in arbitration.Â  \r\n  We also hold the trial courtâ€™s order compelling arbitration of the claims against \r\n  the non-signatories and staying the proceedings is not immediately appealable.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\n MOORE and PELICONES, JJ., concur.Â  Acting Justice Roger M. Young \r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\nACTING JUSTICE YOUNG:Â  I concur in Part 1. B. and Part 2 of the majorityâ€™s \r\n  opinion. I respectfully dissent from Part 1. A., in which the majority holds \r\n  that the Appellantâ€™s complaint does not specifically allege fraud in the inducement \r\n  of the making of the arbitration clause contained in the contract. The majority \r\n  finds the complaint alleges fraud in the inducement of only the contract. I \r\n  disagree. I read the Second Amended Complaint as pleading a cause of action \r\n  that sufficiently alleges fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause \r\n  to comply with precedents of this Court and Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. Therefore, \r\n  I would reverse the trial courtâ€™s grant of the Respondentsâ€™ Rule 12(b)(6) motion \r\n  to dismiss and remand to the trial court for further proceedings on that cause \r\n  of action.\r\nAs the majority notes, in S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great W. Coal (Ky), Inc., \r\n  312 S.C. 559, 563, 437 S.E.2d 22, 24 (1993), this Court adopted the Prima \r\n  Paint rule, which holds that to avoid arbitration through the rescission \r\n  of the entire contract, a party must allege fraudulent inducement in the making \r\n  of the arbitration clause specifically. A party may not avoid arbitration by \r\n  alleging fraudulent inducement in the making of the contract generally. I find \r\n  the Appellant has met this burden.\r\nThe Appellantâ€™s 21st cause of action in the Second Amended Complaint alleges \r\n  that the United Respondents [10] \r\n   inserted the arbitration clause into the contract to limit Appellantâ€™s \r\n  ability to discover the extent of the United Respondentsâ€™ misconduct and to \r\n  limit Appellantâ€™s right to recover punitive damages.Â  Specifically, the amended \r\n  complaint alleges that Bill Martin, an employee of the United Respondents and, \r\n  allegedly, an agent of Appellant, knew the true reason the United Respondents \r\n  wanted the arbitration clause inserted, knew of the Appellantâ€™s Board of Directors \r\n  reliance on him to advise the Board concerning contractual matters, and failed \r\n  to disclose to the Board why the United Respondents wanted the arbitration clause \r\n  inserted or of its impact. The complaint alleges that Martin informed the Appellantâ€™s \r\n  Board that the contract merely changed the method of payment between the parties \r\n  and that the United Respondents required Martin and other United employees to \r\n  provide Appellant with false information regarding their true intentions concerning \r\n  the fulfillment of contract obligations. This cause of action further alleges \r\n  the United Respondents planned to commit additional torts, breaches of contract \r\n  and fiduciary duties, as well as other unspecified wrongs. The complaint specifically \r\n  alleges the United Respondents had the arbitration clause inserted in an effort \r\n  to prevent the Appellant from discovering these past and future planned wrongdoings, \r\n  as well as to limit the Appellantâ€™s right to recover punitive damages for this \r\n  misconduct. Finally, the cause of action alleges the United Respondents required \r\n  their employees to hide both the reason for the insertion of the arbitration \r\n  clause and the impact of the clause. \r\nAt no point does the Second Amended Complaint allege the Respondents \r\n  fraudulently induced Appellant into entering the contract generally. This cause \r\n  of action appears to be carefully drafted and is very specific in its averment \r\n  of facts that allege the arbitration clause was fraudulently inserted in an \r\n  attempt by the United Respondents to limit the Appellantâ€™s ability to discover \r\n  other wrongful acts committed by the United Respondents as well as to limit \r\n  the Appellantâ€™s right to recover punitive damages for those wrongful acts.\r\nThe Appellantâ€™s original complaint and its first amendment would not have survived \r\n  a S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great W. Coal (Ky), Inc. challenge.Â  However, \r\n  the trial court allowed the Appellant to amend the complaint a second time, \r\n  and in my opinion this last amendment corrected the earlier defects. The Appellant \r\n  should not be penalized for these earlier shortcomings when analyzing the Second \r\n  Amended Complaint. When viewed in a light most favorable to the Appellant as \r\n  required in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Second Amended Complaint sets forth \r\n  facts that specifically allege the arbitration clause itself was the subject \r\n  of the fraudulent inducement, and not the contract generally. Therefore, I would \r\n  remand the case to the trial court with instructions to proceed on the fraudulent \r\n  inducement cause of action while staying the remainder of the case until such \r\n  time as that issue has been resolved.\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The parent company of CCP was originally known as Physicians Heath \r\n    Plan of South Carolina (PHPSC).Â  At some point the name appears to have been \r\n    changed to Physicians Health Plan, Inc. (PHP).Â  In 1996, the company was reorganized \r\n    and CCP was created as a for-profit subsidiary of PHP.Â  For simplicityâ€™s sake, \r\n    we refer to appellant as CCP throughout.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The trial court also implicitly found that the FAA applied because \r\n    the contract was one evidencing a transaction involving commerce pursuant \r\n    to 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2 (2000).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Despite CCPâ€™s allegations of wrongdoing against \r\n    Martin, he is not a named defendant.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  [4] It is unclear from the record why CCP allowed itself to become so entangled \r\n    with United.Â  However, it appears that at some point after it signed the 1996 \r\n    Services Agreement, CCP decided to become more independent of United and discovered \r\n    the alleged fraud. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  CCP supports its argument with the affidavit of Dr. Rice Holcombe, \r\n    who became Chairman of the Board of Directors in 1996.Â  Dr. Holcombe claims \r\n    that, had he been informed of the prior misconduct by United or its intent \r\n    to commit future misconduct, he would not have agreed to the inclusion of \r\n    the arbitration clause in its current form, or would have insisted the arbitration \r\n    clause be removed altogether.Â  Ordinarily, if, on a motion for judgment on \r\n    the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded \r\n    by the trial court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment \r\n    and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Rule 12(c), SCRCP; Berry \r\n    v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 492 S.E.2d 794 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding that \r\n    where the trial court dismisses a cause of action based upon matters outside \r\n    the pleadings, a 12(b)(6) motion is converted into Rule 56 motion for summary \r\n    judgment).Â  However, while United claims in its brief that Dr. Holcombeâ€™s \r\n    affidavit cannot be considered because the affidavit relates to factual issues \r\n    that are inappropriate to take into consideration at the 12(b)(6) stage, neither \r\n    party argues that the motion should have been converted into a motion for \r\n    summary judgment.Â  Further, CCP states in its reply brief that the affidavit \r\n    is not needed to decide the issue because the second amended complaint is \r\n    sufficient standing alone.Â  Accordingly, we have not considered the affidavit \r\n    in our decision.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  A minority of courts have rejected Prima Paint \r\n    on state law grounds.Â  Shaffer v. Jeffery, 915 P.2d 910 (allegations \r\n    of fraud in the inducement of a contract or agreement generally, apart from \r\n    the clause to arbitrate, must be resolved by the court prior to either compelling \r\n    arbitration or dismissing the case); Blaine v. John Coleman Hayes &amp; \r\n    Associates, Inc., 818 S.W.2d 33 (1991) (adopting the minority viewpoint \r\n    that if there are allegations the contract in general was procured by fraud, \r\n    that a court, not an arbitrator should make that determination).Â  However, \r\n    this Court adopted the Prima Paint rule in South Carolina Pub. Serv. \r\n    Auth.Â  Further, as noted above, the parties have not challenged the judgeâ€™s \r\n    implicit ruling that the transaction involves interstate commerce.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  We note that the arbitration clause does not expressly prevent discovery, \r\n    and the American Arbitration Association rules provide that arbitrators have \r\n    broad authority to order and control discovery, including depositions.Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  The case involved several similar arbitration \r\n    clauses that excluded punitive damages.Â  UHG was one of the defendants.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C.A.

Johnston, \r\n          Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, and Princess Henryhand Hodges, Assistant \r\n          Disciplinary Counsel, all of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        \r\n        M. Parker Vick, pro se, of Spartanburg.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Â In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the sanctions provided by Rule 7, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from \r\n  the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, \r\n  are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent wrote seventeen checks to the Clerk of \r\n  the Bankruptcy Court for clientsâ€™ filing fees.Â  The checks were returned for \r\n  insufficient funds during May and June 2003.Â  The checks were written on respondentâ€™s \r\n  operating account and were made good by him upon being informed they had been \r\n  returned.Â  \r\nRespondent was sanctioned by the Honorable John E. \r\n  Waites.Â  By order dated September 15, 2003, respondent was required to pay $200 \r\n  to the South Carolina Bar Pro Bono Program (the Program) within fifteen days.Â  \r\n  Respondent delivered a $200 check written from his attorneyâ€™s account to the \r\n  Program, but it was returned for insufficient funds.Â  Respondent subsequently \r\n  paid the Program two hundred dollars.Â  \r\nWhile investigating this matter, ODC uncovered that,Â  \r\n  between May 20 and July 2, 2003, respondent wrote four checks to himself from \r\n  his trust account.Â  The funds, $6,080, were to be held for a probate matter.Â  \r\n  Although the four checks were noted â€œattorneyâ€™s fees,â€ respondent admits the \r\n  funds were not earned fees and he used these funds for his personal use.Â  As \r\n  a result of contact from ODC, respondent replaced the funds on September 18, \r\n  2003.Â  At no time did respondentâ€™s trust account fall into a negative balance.Â Â  \r\n\r\nODC states that, to its best knowledge and belief, \r\n  respondent has fully and immediately cooperated with ODCâ€™s inquires into these \r\n  matters.Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.15 (lawyer \r\n  shall hold client property in lawyerâ€™s possession separately from his own property); \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and \r\n  Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, \r\n  deceit, or misrepresentation). Â In addition, respondent admits his \r\n  misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or \r\n  any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers), \r\n  Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration \r\n  of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or \r\n  conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (lawyer \r\n  shall not violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in \r\n  this state).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely suspend \r\n  respondent from the practice of law.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this \r\n  opinion, respondent shall surrender his certificate of admission to practice \r\n  law in this state to the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit with the \r\n  Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25881","title":"In the Matter of Kitchel","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25881","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary matter in which the Court imposed an eighteen month definite suspension for misconduct.","date":"2004-10-25","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:windowtext;}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:windowtext;}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{font-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent\r\n\t{text-indent:.75in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent2\r\n\t{text-indent:1.0in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      In the Matter of Dirk J.\r\n      Kitchel,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25881\r\nSubmitted October 5, 2004 - Filed October \r\n  25, 2004\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B.

Kitchel, pro se, of Charleston.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the \r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any sanction up to an \r\n  eighteen monthÂ  suspension from the practice of law.Â  See Rule 7, RLDE, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and impose a definite suspension of \r\n  eighteen months from the practice of law.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, \r\n  are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nIn 2000, respondent was paid a \r\n  retainer of approximately $5,000 to represent Client A in defense of federal \r\n  drug charges.Â  During the time that respondent represented Client A, Client \r\n  A was also represented by Attorney Newman in an unrelated matter.Â  In the course \r\n  of that representation, Mr. Newman obtained approximately $2,268.90 on Client \r\n  Aâ€™s behalf.Â  In November 2000, Mr. Newman forwarded those funds to respondent \r\n  in trust for Client A.Â  At the time the funds were forwarded to respondent, \r\n  Mr. Newman notified respondent of his claim to attorney fees from those funds.Â  \r\n  Client A claimed he did not owe Mr. Newman any money and refused to allow respondent \r\n  to disburse funds to him.Â  \r\nWhen respondent did not receive \r\n  a copy of a written agreement between Client A and Mr. Newman concerning the \r\n  funds, respondent disbursed the funds to Client A and to himself without holding \r\n  in trust the amount claimed by Mr. Newman.Â  Respondent did not prepare a written \r\n  accounting of the disbursement of these funds.Â  \r\nInvestigation of the complaint \r\n  was referred to an Attorney Appointed to Assist Disciplinary Counsel (ATA).Â  \r\n  The ATA notified respondent of his appointment by letter dated November 25, \r\n  2002, requesting respondent contact him within thirty days to arrange for a \r\n  meeting.Â  Respondent failed to respond or otherwise communicate with the ATA \r\n  in response to his November 25, 2002 letter.Â  On December 26, 2002, the ATA \r\n  sent respondent a second letter, again requesting his contact within thirty \r\n  days.Â  This letter was sent to respondent by certified mail and receipt was \r\n  confirmed.Â  Respondent failed to respond or otherwise communicate with the ATA \r\n  following receipt of the December 26, 2002 letter.Â  \r\nRespondent did respond to the \r\n  initial inquiries of ODC in this matter.Â  However, he failed to respond to the \r\n  Notice of Full Investigation served on him on June 26, 2003.Â  Respondent subsequently \r\n  appeared pursuant to Rule 19(c)(4), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and responded to \r\n  the allegations on the record.Â Â  \r\nMatter \r\n  II\r\nIn June 2002, Mrs. B paid respondent \r\n  a retainer of approximately $2,500 to represent her son, Client B, in a post-conviction \r\n  relief matter.Â  Respondent fully investigated the case and adequately communicated \r\n  with his client about the investigation.Â  When Mrs. B and Client B became dissatisfied \r\n  with the time it was taking for a hearing to be scheduled, Mrs. B terminated \r\n  respondentâ€™s representation.Â  Respondent failed, however, to confirm the termination \r\n  with Client B and failed to seek a withdrawal from the matter with the court.\r\nRespondent was notified of the \r\n  complaint by letter from ODC.Â  The letter requested a response within fifteen \r\n  days.Â  Respondent did not respond to the letter or to a subsequent letter sent \r\n  pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).Â  \r\n  Respondent also failed to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation served \r\n  on him on June 27, 2003.Â  Respondent subsequently appeared pursuant to Rule \r\n  19 (c)(4), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and responded to the allegations on the record.Â  \r\n\r\nMatter \r\n  III\r\nOn September 24, 2002, respondent \r\n  was paid a retainer to represent Client C in a federal criminal case.Â  Client \r\n  C entered a guilty plea on November 4, 2002 and was scheduled to be sentenced \r\n  at a March 4, 2003 hearing.Â  Respondent had no contact with his client following \r\n  the plea.Â  Respondent did not provide him with a copy of the presentence report.\r\nBecause respondent was not diligently \r\n  collecting his mail and because his office telephone had been disconnected, \r\n  respondent did not receive the notice of the sentencing hearing and, therefore, \r\n  failed to appear.Â  Telephone calls were placed from the clerk of courtâ€™s office \r\n  to respondent, but he could not be reached.Â  The presiding judge appointed new \r\n  counsel to represent Client C in the sentencing phase of his case.Â  \r\nRespondent was notified of the \r\n  complaint by letter from ODC which requested a response within fifteen days.Â  \r\n  Respondent did not respond to that letter or a subsequent inquiry sent pursuant \r\n  to In the Matter of Treacy, id.Â  Respondent also failed \r\n  to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation served on June 27, 2003.Â  Respondent \r\n  subsequently appeared pursuant to Rule 19 (c)(4), RLDE, Rule, 413, SCACR.Â Â  \r\n\r\nMatter \r\n  IV\r\nIn November 2002, Client D paid \r\n  respondent approximately $585 to handle a bankruptcy matter.Â  Respondent competently \r\n  and diligently represented Client D, however, the bankruptcy was dismissed because \r\n  Client D did not produce certain documentation required by the trustee.Â  Client \r\n  D demanded respondent refund his retainer and provide him with his client file.Â  \r\n  Respondent did not refund the fee as he felt it had been earned.Â  However, respondent \r\n  did not send Client D his client file.Â  \r\nRespondent was notified of the \r\n  complaint by letter from ODC which requested a response within fifteen days.Â  \r\n  Respondent did not respond to that letter or a subsequent inquiry sent pursuant \r\n  to In the Matter of Treacy, id.Â  Respondent also failed \r\n  to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation served on June 27, 2003.Â  Respondent \r\n  subsequently appeared pursuant to Rule 19 (c)(4), RLDE, Rule, 413, SCACR.Â Â  \r\n\r\nMatter \r\n  V\r\nClient E paid respondent a retainer \r\n  to assist him in defense of driving while intoxicated charges pending in Georgia.Â  \r\n  At the time respondent was retained, he was not licensed to practice law in \r\n  Georgia.Â  Although respondent advised Client E that he was not licensed in Georgia \r\n  and that he could only try to get the matter continued until a deal could be \r\n  made or Georgia counsel could be retained, respondent did not confirm this arrangement \r\n  in writing.Â  \r\nRespondent sent a request to the \r\n  clerk of court for a continuance of the hearing.Â  Respondent called to confirm \r\n  receipt and was informed that the request was denied.Â  Respondent informed Client \r\n  E that he needed to retain an attorney licensed in Georgia and that his hearing \r\n  was not continued.Â  Neither respondent nor Client E appeared at the hearing.Â  \r\n  As a result, Client Eâ€™s license was suspended.Â  \r\nRespondent was notified of the \r\n  complaint by letter from ODC which requested a response within fifteen days.Â  \r\n  Respondent did not respond to that letter or a subsequent inquiry sent pursuant \r\n  to Matter of Treacy, id.Â  Respondent also failed to respond to \r\n  the Notice of Full Investigation served on July 31, 2003.Â  Respondent subsequently \r\n  appeared pursuant to Rule 19 (c)(4), RLDE, Rule, 413, SCACR.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nRespondent acknowledges he should \r\n  have confirmed both the limited scope of his representation and the status of \r\n  Client Eâ€™s case in writing.Â  Although his failure to do so did not violate the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, respondent acknowledges that documentation of \r\n  this communication with his client would have been the better practice.Â  \r\nMatter \r\n  VI\r\nClient F hired respondent to represent \r\n  her in a bankruptcy matter.Â  She was unable to pay the full fee at the first \r\n  meeting and agreed in writing that respondent would not file until his retainer \r\n  and costs were paid in full.Â  Respondent proceeded to collect the necessary \r\n  documentation and to prepare the forms for filing. The file was complete when \r\n  Client F made her final payment, however, respondent failed to file the petition \r\n  on her behalf.Â  Respondent ceased his work on Client Fâ€™s file without notice \r\n  to her, without refunding her fees and costs, and without returning her client \r\n  file.Â  \r\nRespondent was notified of the \r\n  complaint by letter from ODC.Â  The letter requested a response within fifteen \r\n  days.Â  Respondent did not respond to that letter.Â  Respondent also failed to \r\n  respond to the Notice of Full Investigation served on him on August 19, 2003.Â  \r\n  Respondent subsequently appeared pursuant to Rule 19(c)(4), RLDE, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR, and responded to the allegations on the record.Â  \r\nMatter \r\n  VII\r\nClient G consulted with respondent \r\n  about a bankruptcy matter in September 2002.Â  She was unable to pay the full \r\n  $500 fee and $200 costs at the first meeting.Â  She paid $200 and agreed in writing \r\n  that respondent would not file until he was paid in full.Â  Respondent proceeded \r\n  to collect the necessary documentation and to prepare the forms for filing.Â  \r\n  In April 2003, the file was completed when Client G made her second payment \r\n  of $250.Â  Respondent informed Client G that he would not file until the final \r\n  payment of $250 was received.Â  Client G did not pay and respondent did not file.Â  \r\n  Client G telephoned respondent on a couple of occasions; respondent admits he \r\n  did not return the calls.Â  \r\n Respondent failed to respond to \r\n  the Notice of Full Investigation served on him on August 19, 2003.Â  Respondent \r\n  subsequently appeared pursuant to Rule 19 (c)(4), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and \r\n  responded to the allegations on the record.Â  \r\nMatter \r\n  VIII\r\nMrs. H filed a complaint regarding \r\n  the manner in which respondent was handling her sonâ€™s, Client Hâ€™s, case.Â  A \r\n  copy of the complaint was provided to respondent on February 3, 2004, along \r\n  with a request for a written response to the allegations within fifteen days.Â  \r\n  Respondent did not comply.Â  Respondent did respond to the Notice of Full Investigation.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that his misconduct constitutes \r\n  grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer \r\n  shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction \r\n  regarding professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(3) (lawyer shall not knowingly \r\n  fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority), Rule 7(a)(5) \r\n  (lawyer shall not engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of \r\n  justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct \r\n  demonstrating an unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (lawyer shall \r\n  not violate the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law).Â  In addition, \r\n  respondent admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:&nbsp; Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent \r\n  representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness \r\n  in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed \r\n  about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for \r\n  information); Rule 1.5 (lawyerâ€™s fee shall be reasonable); \r\n  Rule 1.15(a)(lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons separate \r\n  from lawyerâ€™s own property; complete records of account funds shall be kept \r\n  by the lawyer); 1.15(b) (upon receiving funds or other property in which a client \r\n  or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or \r\n  third person); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation, \r\n  a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a \r\n  clientâ€™s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing \r\n  time for employment of other counsel, and surrendering papers and property to \r\n  which the client is entitled); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable \r\n  efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client); \r\n  Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for \r\n  information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in \r\n  conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice). [1] Â  Finally, respondent \r\n  admits he violated the financial recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.&nbsp;\r\nÂ \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and impose \r\n  a definite suspension of eighteen months from the practice of law.Â  Respondentâ€™s \r\n  request the suspension be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension \r\n  is denied.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall \r\n  file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with \r\n  Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Senior \r\n  Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel. \r\nJ. Steedley Bogan, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the \r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to either an indefinite \r\n  suspension or disbarment.Â  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent from \r\n  the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, \r\n  are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was admitted to the practice \r\n  of law in North Carolina in 1996 and the practice of law in South Carolina in \r\n  1998.Â  From 1998 until 2000, he worked as an associate for the law firm of Forquer \r\n  &amp; Green in the firmâ€™s Charlotte office.Â  In 2000, respondent formed the \r\n  partnership of Forquer, Green &amp; Lattimore with offices in Greenville and \r\n  Charleston.Â  In 2001, the firm of Forquer, Lattimore &amp; Calloway was formed \r\n  to succeed Forquer &amp; Green in Charlotte.Â  Neither Forquer, Green, nor Calloway \r\n  are licensed to practice law in South Carolina. \r\nThe primary business of Forquer, \r\n  Green &amp; Lattimore was residential real estate closing services.Â  Respondent \r\n  worked out of the Greenville office from early 2001 until August 2003.Â  The \r\n  firm employed various associates licensed in South Carolina until its dissolution \r\n  upon respondentâ€™s departure.Â Â  \r\nI.\r\nOn December 17, 2002, respondent \r\n  conducted a residential real estate closing for Client A.Â  For her convenience, \r\n  respondent traveled from his office in Greenville to Anderson to conduct the \r\n  closing.Â  Respondent did not bring any witnesses to the closing and conducted \r\n  the closing with only Client A present.Â  Upon his return to the office, non-lawyers \r\n  signed as witnesses and notary on the closing documents.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that non-lawyers \r\n  signing closing documents as witness or notary when they were not present at \r\n  the closing was routine in his office, especially during a period of high volume \r\n  that occurred as a result of the low interest rates from 2002 through 2004.Â  \r\n  Respondent further admits that, on occasion, his staff would witness and notarize \r\n  documents prior to closing and prior to execution by the signatory.Â  Respondent \r\n  states this practice violated his own policies and procedures, but acknowledges \r\n  he is responsible.Â  \r\nIn the Greenville office during \r\n  this high volume period, non-lawyers conducted real estate closings outside \r\n  the presence of a licensed attorney.Â  Although respondent had policies in place \r\n  against this practice, he acknowledges it did occur and that he is responsible \r\n  for creating an environment in which the practice was tacitly condoned.Â  \r\nII.\r\nRespondent failed to complete his \r\n  mandatory continuing legal education (CLE) requirements for 2002.Â  He filed \r\n  an incomplete reporting affidavit with the Commission on Continuing Legal Education \r\n  and Specialization (the Commission).Â  On February 7, 2003, respondent was served \r\n  with a notice from the Commission that his licensed to practice law was suspended \r\n  as of February 5, 2003, for failing to meet mandatory CLE requirements.Â  Respondent \r\n  subsequently obtained the credits needed for compliance and filed an amended \r\n  affidavit.Â  His administrative suspension was lifted on February 26, 2003.\r\nWhile suspended, respondent continued \r\n  to practice law.Â  Eighty-four closings were conducted in the Greenville office \r\n  during the twenty-one days in which respondent was suspended.Â  During this period \r\n  of time, no licensed attorneys worked in the Greenville office.Â  Respondent \r\n  acknowledges he was aware he was suspended and not permitted to practice law, \r\n  but nevertheless admits he made a conscious decision to continue to do so.Â  \r\n\r\nIII.\r\nIn August 2001, respondent conducted \r\n  a real estate closing in which Clients B &amp; C sold one of two adjacent lots \r\n  they owned.Â  The lot sold had a house on it; the adjacent lot was empty.Â  As \r\n  a result of errors in the title search, the closing documents conveyed and encumbered \r\n  the empty lot rather than the lot with the house that the clients had intended \r\n  to sell.Â  \r\nIn Spring 2002, respondent was informed \r\n  of the error.Â  Respondent corrected the problem by having the clients and the \r\n  buyer sign reciprocal deeds.Â  Respondent failed, however, to secure a release \r\n  of the empty lot from the buyerâ€™s mortgage company until July 2003, after receiving \r\n  notice of the grievance filed by Client B and C.Â  This caused a several month \r\n  delay in Client B and Câ€™s sale of the empty lot to a new buyer.Â  Respondent \r\n  failed to adequately communicate with Client B and C during the time he was \r\n  attempting to solve the problems.\r\nIV.\r\nOn January 9, 2003, respondent conducted a real estate \r\n  closing in which Client D and E were selling their home to buyer.Â  Through no \r\n  fault of respondent, the lender did not fund the loan and the transaction had \r\n  to be cancelled. \r\nWhen the problems were resolved, the closing \r\n  was rescheduled for February 11, 2003.Â  Respondent conducted the second closing \r\n  even though he was aware his license to practice law was suspended.Â  Respondentâ€™s \r\n  partner, Green, was present in the office when the loan was closed, but Green \r\n  was not licensed to practice law in this state.Â  Respondent failed to sign some \r\n  of the closing documents.Â  A non-lawyer in the office subsequently signed respondentâ€™s \r\n  name to the closing documents without indicating someone was signing for him.Â  \r\n  This was not done with respondentâ€™s specific authorization, however, respondent \r\n  acknowledges he was responsible for creating an environment in which non-lawyers \r\n  in his office would assume the practice was acceptable.Â  \r\nV.\r\nFrom March 2001 through July 2002, \r\n  the Greenville office of Forquer, Green &amp; Lattimore conducted 166 closings \r\n  in which National City Mortgage was the lender.Â  In instances in which the loans \r\n  were for refinancing rather than purchase money purposes, representatives of \r\n  the lender insisted that the closing be done prior to completion of the title \r\n  search and the title work be done during the three-day recession period.Â  Respondent \r\n  advised the borrowers in these cases that the title search had not been conducted \r\n  and that the closings would not be completed or the loans funded until the title \r\n  work was complete.Â  Respondent instructed the borrowers to sign closing documents \r\n  without property descriptions.Â  The property descriptions would be added once \r\n  the title work was complete.Â  This process was contrary to the firmâ€™s standard \r\n  practice and, as a result, the post-closing process in many of the files was \r\n  not timely handled.Â  In forty-eight of the National City files, the mortgages \r\n  were not recorded as of January 2003.Â  By the time respondent was contacted \r\n  by National City Mortgage, many of the mortgages had been lost and had to be \r\n  re-executed.Â  \r\nIt was the firmâ€™s practice to collect \r\n  the title insurance policy premium from the closing and then issue a separate \r\n  check once respondent issued the title opinion.Â  Forquer visited the office \r\n  periodically to collect the premium checks.Â  It was his responsibility to pay \r\n  the premium over to the title company which would then issue the policy.Â  In \r\n  approximately eighty-four of the National City Mortgage closings, premiums were \r\n  collected, but policies were not issued. \r\nVI.\r\nRespondent received a significant \r\n  portion of his business in Anderson from three mortgage loan brokerage companies.Â  \r\n  Certain employees and owners of these mortgage loan brokerage companies conspired \r\n  with certain loan officers employed by National City Mortgage and certain real \r\n  estate appraisers to obtain loans on properties for more than the properties \r\n  were worth using inflated appraisals.Â  (The mortgage brokers, loan officers, \r\n  and appraisers are referred to collectively as â€œCo-Conspirators.â€).Â  Respondent \r\n  conduct the closings on many of the properties involved in the conspiracy.Â  \r\n\r\nIn several instances, the Co-Conspirators \r\n  obtained the fraudulent loans by using a practice known as property â€œflipping.â€Â  \r\n  In an illegal property flip, a straw buyer or co-conspirator (Buyer A) will \r\n  enter into a contract to purchase property for its actual value from the Seller.Â  \r\n  Buyer A will not obtain financing but will, instead, enter into a contract to \r\n  sell the property to a co-conspirator (Buyer B) at an inflated price.Â  Buyer \r\n  B will then use an appraisal for the inflated price to obtain a loan.Â  Closings \r\n  on the sale from Seller to Buyer A and from Buyer A to Buyer B are done at the \r\n  same time.Â  Buyer A will pay the contract price to Seller from the loan proceeds \r\n  and will then often split the difference with Buyer B.Â  The actual transaction \r\n  is contrary to the information contained on the HUD-1 forms, which misrepresents \r\n  the sales prices and the source of the funding for the purchases and often falsely \r\n  indicates that the buyers are contributing significant down payments in cash.Â  \r\n  According to the Agreement for Discipline by Consent, when no payments are made \r\n  to the lender and the property is foreclosed, the lender can recoup only the \r\n  actual value of the property rather than the amount loaned on the inflated appraisal.Â  \r\n\r\nAn illegal property flip generally \r\n  requires the conspiracy of at least one of the buyers, an appraiser, and a mortgage \r\n  broker or loan officer.Â  It also requires the assistance of an attorney who \r\n  is aware of the fraud, chooses to look the other way, or who fails to supervise \r\n  non-lawyer assistants engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  In order \r\n  for the flip to work, the same attorney has to close both transactions.Â  If \r\n  an attorney conducts a closing on property for a certain sales price and funds \r\n  that closing with proceeds from the immediate resale of the same property for \r\n  a significantly higher amount, the attorney has constructive notice that the \r\n  second sale might be based on a fraudulently inflated appraisal of the property.Â  \r\n  This is particularly true when the buyer leaves the closing with both the property \r\n  and with money from the loan.Â  \r\nIn the case of the loans closed \r\n  by respondent, in addition to the constructive notice described above, respondent \r\n  had actual knowledge in at least two of the transactions that the appraisals \r\n  were inflated.Â  In several of the transactions, respondent falsely represented \r\n  on closing documents that mortgage broker fees to a Co-Conspirator were payments \r\n  to creditors of the borrower.Â  \r\nRespondent was on further notice \r\n  that the conduct of the Co-Conspirators might be illegal because, in connection \r\n  with several of the closings, the documents reflected that the loans were for \r\n  refinancing rather than purchase money.Â  At the same time, respondent prepared \r\n  documents actually conveying the property.Â  Additionally, at least one Co-Conspirator \r\n  who was personally known to respondent used aliases to obtain some of the loans.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Co-Conspirators used 116 fraudulent \r\n  appraisals, each of which had been inflated by at least $50,000 to obtain loans \r\n  from National City Mortgage.Â  The Co-Conspirators pled guilty to federal felony \r\n  conspiracy charges and admitted to obtaining inflated amounts totaling $13,000,000.\r\nRespondent closed eighty-eight \r\n  loans for the Co-Conspirators with inflated appraisals of at least $25,000 each.Â  \r\n  Respondent did not share in the profits from the fraudulently obtained loans, \r\n  but he did benefit from significant business generated by the various mortgage \r\n  brokers involved.Â  Additionally, respondent charged a fee of $175 for the title \r\n  search on each closing.Â  In cases of flip transactions done simultaneously on \r\n  the same property, there is no need for a second title search.Â  Respondent essentially \r\n  double-billed for this work.Â  \r\n On June 3, 2004, respondent pled \r\n  guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud in the United States \r\n  District Court arising out of his involvement in the above-described activities \r\n  relating to the National City Mortgage loans.Â  As of the date of the Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent, respondent had not been sentenced.Â  \r\nVII.\r\nRespondent conducted a closing on \r\n  a refinancing loan for Client F in September 2002.Â  Respondent issued and mailed \r\n  a check to Client Fâ€™s existing lender to pay off her mortgage.Â  In December \r\n  2002, Client F received a notice from her lender that payment had not been received.Â  \r\n  When respondent received a copy of this notice, he reissued payment to the lender \r\n  with a request that it apply the payment retroactively to September.Â  The lender \r\n  would not comply with this request and returned the check as insufficient to \r\n  pay the debt.Â  In March 2003, Client F received a delinquency notice.Â  At that \r\n  time, respondent paid the full amount claimed by the lender using his firmâ€™s \r\n  funds to make up the shortage.Â  \r\nAlthough respondent maintained a \r\n  separate trust account for the Greenville office and kept some financial records \r\n  there, primary bookkeeping and account reconciliation were conducted by non-lawyers \r\n  in the Charlotte office.Â  Respondent did not supervise this process and was \r\n  not informed of discrepancies in the trust account.Â  Additionally, non-lawyers \r\n  in respondentâ€™s Greenville office often placed checks returned by lenders and \r\n  deeds or mortgages returned by the RMC office into the closing files without \r\n  alerting respondent to the problem.Â  For these reasons, respondent was unaware \r\n  that the two checks issued to Client Fâ€™s lender did not clear the bank in a \r\n  timely fashion but sat non-negotiated in Client Fâ€™s file.Â  It was not until \r\n  Client F contacted respondent with her delinquency notices that respondent took \r\n  action to correct the situation.Â  \r\nVIII.\r\nAt the request of Client Gâ€™s lender, \r\n  the Greenville office conducted a closing for Client G in July 2001.Â  Due to \r\n  miscommunication on the lenderâ€™s part, both respondentâ€™s firm (on behalf of \r\n  Client G) and the lender ordered title searches on the property.Â  Respondent \r\n  issued a title opinion and paid out funds from the closing for his title search \r\n  and for a title policy.Â  When the lender learned it would have to pay for the \r\n  title work it conducted, the lender demanded respondent reimburse it for this \r\n  expense, claiming respondent was hired solely to â€œwitnessâ€ the closing.\r\nInitially, respondent refused \r\n  to refund the money, asserting his firmâ€™s policies prohibited â€œwitness-onlyâ€ \r\n  closings and required their own title work.Â  In order to maintain a good working \r\n  relationship with the lender, however, respondent decided to pay $500 to share \r\n  in the loss.Â  The check to Client Gâ€™s lender was written on the Greenville officeâ€™s \r\n  operating account.Â  The check was returned for insufficient funds.Â  Respondent \r\n  was unable to explain the deficiency because all accounting and bookkeeping \r\n  for the operating account had been transferred to the Charlotte office.Â  The \r\n  firm ultimately paid the lender $500 plus bank fees incurred as a result of \r\n  the returned check.Â  \r\nIX.\r\nIn October 2002, respondent conducted \r\n  a loan closing for Client G.Â  At the closing, he withheld an estimated payment \r\n  for the property taxes that would become due in January 2003.Â  In January 2003, \r\n  payment was issued to the tax authority for the amount withheld, however, the \r\n  estimate was lower than the actual taxes due.Â  Client G contacted respondentâ€™s \r\n  office in June 2003 to inform him that she had received a delinquent tax notice.Â  \r\n  Payment was reissued in the full amount with respondentâ€™s firm paying the difference.Â  \r\n  Client G made numerous attempts to get information from respondent about the \r\n  status of her tax payment.Â  She had no success.Â  In fact, at the time she filed \r\n  her disciplinary complaint, the matter had been resolved but respondent had \r\n  failed to inform Client G.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that, due \r\n  to his insufficient supervision of the firmâ€™s accounting practices, he was unaware \r\n  the tax check did not clear the bank for six months.Â  He acknowledges that the \r\n  volume of real estate closings he was attempting to accomplish in the Greenville \r\n  office led to misfiling and misplacing important documents such as the trust \r\n  account check that was returned by the tax office.Â  Respondent further acknowledges \r\n  that his delegation of the responsibility to respond to Client Gâ€™s inquiries \r\n  was not sufficient to meet his obligation to adequately communicate with his \r\n  client.Â  \r\nX.\r\nIn April 2002, respondent conducted \r\n  a closing on the sale of property from Mr. H to Mr. I.Â  In the transaction, \r\n  Mr. H was selling a portion of a tract of land encumbered by a mortgage owed \r\n  by Mr. H.Â  The agreement provided Mr. Hâ€™s lender would accept $35,000 in exchange \r\n  for a release of the portion of the property being purchased by Mr. I.Â  Mr. \r\n  I obtained a loan on the property and, by June 2003, had paid it off.Â  Mr. I \r\n  then attempted to borrow additional funds using the property as collateral.Â  \r\n  In the course of closing on this second loan, it was discovered that Mr. Hâ€™s \r\n  mortgage still encumbered the portion of the property now owned by Mr. I.Â  \r\nIn May 2002, after the closing on \r\n  the sale from Mr. H to Mr. I, respondent had issued payment to Mr. Hâ€™s lender.Â  \r\n  However, the lender did not accept the payment or release its mortgage because \r\n  certain documentary requirements had not been met by respondent at the time \r\n  of the closing.Â  Respondentâ€™s file contains no record of receiving the check \r\n  back from the lender, although the lender did produce a cover letter indicating \r\n  that it had sent the check back.Â  The firm ultimately paid $35,000 plus interest \r\n  to the lender and obtained a release of Mr. Iâ€™s portion of the property.Â Â  \r\n From the time of the closing in \r\n  April 2002 until payment was made in August 2003, the balance in respondentâ€™s \r\n  trust account remained sufficient to cover the $35,000 withheld from the closing.Â  \r\n  Respondent admits that his failure to adequately supervise the firmâ€™s trust \r\n  accounting procedures resulted in his failure to know that the check to Mr. \r\n  Hâ€™s lender had never cleared the bank.Â  He also acknowledges that the volume \r\n  of real estate closings he was attempting to accomplish in the Greenville office \r\n  led to misfiling and misplacing important documents such as the payoff check \r\n  that Mr. Hâ€™s lender returned.Â  \r\nXI.\r\nFor each of the law offices in which \r\n  closings on South Carolina properties were handled (Greenville, Rock Hill, Charleston, \r\n  and Charlotte), Robert Forquer and Scott Green opened a bank account called \r\n  the â€œrecordingâ€ account.Â  When funds were collected at closing to pay fees for \r\n  the recording of mortgages, deeds, and other documents, a check in the amount \r\n  collected would be written from the real estate trust account and deposited \r\n  into the recording account for that office.Â  Checks to the appropriate county \r\n  office would, in turn, be written from the recording account and delivered with \r\n  the documents to be filed.Â  The firm routinely and intentionally overcharged \r\n  clients for these recording fees and failed to reimburse the amounts not used \r\n  for the designated purpose.Â  The overcharges ranged from $2.00 to $40.00 per \r\n  closing.Â  \r\nThe recording accounts were also \r\n  sometimes used for processing the entire closing.Â  The firm failed to maintain \r\n  sufficient records of the recording accounts and failed to identify and track \r\n  client funds maintained in the accounts.Â  No record was kept in the closing \r\n  files of the actual amounts paid for recording fees and no accounting of overcharges \r\n  to the clients was kept.Â  The overcharges for the recording fees were separate \r\n  from the attorneyâ€™s fees and courier fees charged to clients.Â  \r\nThe funds in the recording accounts \r\n  were used for a variety of purposes other than document recording fees, including \r\n  office expenses (stamps, bank charges, staff lunches), correction of errors \r\n  in closings (payoff shortages and miscalculation of title insurance premiums), \r\n  settlement of minor claims against the firm, payroll or other payments to staff, \r\n  and checks to Mr. Forquer and Mr. Green in various amounts, including checks \r\n  for $4,000 and $7,000.\r\nThe source of the funds in the recording \r\n  accounts (client charges and overcharges for recording fees) was insufficient \r\n  to cover the firmâ€™s uses of the account.Â  As a result, the accounts were frequently \r\n  short of funds.Â  Mortgages, deeds, and other closing documents were routinely \r\n  held and not timely filed because there were insufficient funds in the recording \r\n  account to pay the recording fees.Â  Occasionally, associates used their own \r\n  money to pay recording fees and then sought reimbursement from the firm.Â  \r\nIn the Greenville office, a paralegal \r\n  with signatory authority on the recording and real estate trust accounts wrote \r\n  a series of approximately twenty-five checks payable to herself or to cash in \r\n  various amounts.Â  This paralegal was also responsible for reconciling the recording \r\n  account and maintaining records associated with it.Â  Upon receipt of the cancelled \r\n  checks, the paralegal altered the payee to make it appear that the checks had \r\n  been written to county offices for legitimate purposes.Â  Using this method, \r\n  the paralegal took approximately $46,000 from the recording account.Â  \r\nAlthough he was unaware of the paralegalâ€™s \r\n  activities in this regard, respondent had supervisory authority over the employee.Â  \r\n  From February 2003 through May 2004, the Greenville recording account had insufficient \r\n  fund charges of approximately $11,522.Â  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that the \r\n  recording accounts were client trust accounts.Â  He further acknowledges that, \r\n  as a partner in the Greenville, Charleston, and Charlotte offices, he shared \r\n  responsibility for the safekeeping of client funds and for maintaining certain \r\n  financial records.Â  Respondent acknowledges that the use to which his firm put \r\n  the recording account funds constituted mismanagement, commingling, and misappropriation.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct \r\n  he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to \r\n  a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and \r\n  promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall \r\n  keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly \r\n  comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15(a) (lawyer \r\n  shall hold property of clients in the lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with \r\n  a representation separate from the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 5.1 (partner \r\n  in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect \r\n  measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm conform to \r\n  the Rules of Professional

employeeâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer); \r\n  Rule 5.3(b) (lawyer having direct supervisory authority over a non-lawyer shall \r\n  make reasonable efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with \r\n  the professional obligations of the lawyer); Rule 5.3(c) (lawyer shall be responsible \r\n  for conduct of a non-lawyer that would be a violation of the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if either the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge \r\n  of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved or the lawyer is a partner \r\n  in the law firm in which the non-lawyer is employed, or has direct supervisory \r\n  authority over the non-lawyer, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences \r\n  can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take remedial action); Rule 5.5(b) \r\n  (lawyer shall not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance \r\n  of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (lawyer shall not commit a

engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice). \r\nIn addition, respondent admits his conduct \r\n  violated Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Respondent admits his misconduct is grounds for discipline \r\n  under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it is a ground \r\n  for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4) \r\n  (it is a ground for discipline for lawyer to be convicted of a crime of moral \r\n  turpitude or a serious crime); Rule 7(a)(5) (it is a ground for discipline for \r\n  lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute administration of justice or \r\n  to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating \r\n  an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it is a ground for discipline \r\n  for lawyer to violate oath of office).Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent.Â  Respondentâ€™s request that the disbarment \r\n  be made retroactive to the date he was placed on interim suspension is denied.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of \r\n  this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing \r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender \r\n  his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  \r\n\r\n DISBARRED.\r\nTOAL,

Simons, III, of Simons and Keaveny, of Charleston, for Respondents-Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This cross-appeal arises \r\n  from an action brought by homeowners Bert and Stephanie Atkinson (Atkinsons) \r\n  against Orkin Exterminating Company (Orkin), seeking recovery for structural \r\n  damage to their home caused by termite infestation.Â  In this appeal, Orkin seeks \r\n  a remittitur of the punitive damages award, and the Atkinsons seek reversal \r\n  of the trial courtâ€™s decision to offset their compensatory damages by the amount \r\n  they received in a settlement from a third party. \r\n  [1] Â  After certifying this case from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule \r\n  204(b), SCACR, we reverse and remand the issue concerning the amount of punitive \r\n  damages, with instructions, and reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision to offset \r\n  compensatory damages.&nbsp; \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn the underlying action, the Atkinsons sued Orkin, \r\n  among others, for breach of contract with a fraudulent act and negligence.Â  \r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Contract with a Fraudulent Act\r\nWhen the Atkinsons purchased their home in 1995, \r\n  they discovered that the previous owners of the house had purchased and maintained \r\n  a termite bond from Orkin since 1972.Â  The documents comprising the termite \r\n  bond included a LIFETIME TERMITE DAMAGE GUARANTEE, which provided up to $100,000 \r\n  in recoverable repair costs for termite damage at a fixed, renewable rate of \r\n  $28 per year (fixed-rate provision).Â  The guarantee also included a provision \r\n  that allowed customers to transfer the bond to any subsequent purchaser of the \r\n  house (transferability provision). Orkin categorizes this version of the LIFETIME \r\n  TERMITE DAMAGE GUARANTEE as a â€œpre-1975 contractâ€ because it provided benefits \r\n  and coverage not available to customers today. [2] Â  \r\nSoon after the Atkinsons moved into their new home, \r\n  they attempted to have the termite bond transferred to them as permitted by \r\n  the transferability provision.Â  But, when the Atkinsons contacted Earl Beck \r\n  (Beck), then manager of Orkinâ€™s Charleston office, seeking to have the bond \r\n  transferred in their name, Beck refused.Â  Instead, Beck offered the Atkinsons \r\n  a new contract with less desirable terms.Â  The Atkinsons rejected the offer, \r\n  and Orkin canceled the termite bond in June 1996 for non-payment.Â  At trial, \r\n  Orkin admitted that it breached the contract when it refused to honor the transferability \r\n  provision. [3] \r\nBecause Orkin refused to transfer the contract, \r\n  the Atkinsons obtained coverage from Terminix.Â  In August 1996, after Orkinâ€™s \r\n  protection had expired and while Terminixâ€™s bond was in force, the Atkinsons \r\n  discovered termites and termite damage in the structure of their house.Â  Terminix \r\n  denied full coverage, asserting that most of the termite damage took place during \r\n  the twenty-four years that Orkinâ€™s coverage applied.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negligence\r\nBefore the Atkinsons purchased the house, Orkin conducted \r\n  a routine inspection and reported that the residence was free of termites and \r\n  termite damage.Â  Shortly after they moved into the house, the Atkinsons found \r\n  living termites and termite damage in a windowsill.Â  Further investigation revealed \r\n  termite damage in the structure of the house.\r\nTo determine the extent of the termite damage, the \r\n  Atkinsons hired Cam Lay of Clemson Universityâ€™s Department of Pesticide Regulation \r\n  (South Carolinaâ€™s regulatory agency for pest control businesses) to conduct \r\n  an additional inspection of the house.Â  Lay concluded that Orkin (1) failed \r\n  to report termite damage, (2) violated state regulatory standards by failing \r\n  to disclose powder-post-beetle damage and decay damage, and (3) failed to disclose \r\n  crawl-space-moisture readings.Â  At trial, Orkin admitted that it negligently \r\n  failed to disclose prior termite damage to the house in its inspection report \r\n  but denied the remaining allegations in Layâ€™s report.\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Orkinâ€™s 1980 Initiative\r\nIn 1980, Orkinâ€™s president wrote a memorandum outlining \r\n  an initiative that directed branch managers to raise the renewal rates of all \r\n  pre-1975 contracts in direct contradiction to the fixed-rate provision.Â  The \r\n  memo prescribed the manner in which managers were to deal with customers complaining \r\n  about rate increases.Â  It provided that if the customers mentioned a pamphlet \r\n  that Orkin sent to some customers to promote the fixed-rate provision, the managers \r\n  would ask the customers to read the fixed-rate language aloud, over the telephone.Â  \r\n  If the customers repeated the language verbatim, the manager would tell them \r\n  that â€œa computer mistake was madeâ€ and that a corrected bill would be sent.Â  \r\n  But if the customers did not repeat the language verbatim, the customers were \r\n  told that the rates were â€œeligible for increaseâ€ according to a â€œrecent legal \r\n  ruling.â€Â  At trial, over Orkinâ€™s objection, the judge allowed the Atkinsons \r\n  to submit this memo into evidence.Â Â  \r\nFour years after Orkin began its initiative to \r\n  raise rates, the Federal Trade Commission (â€œFTCâ€) filed an administrative complaint \r\n  alleging that Orkinâ€™s unilateral renewal rate increase was an unfair trade practice.Â  \r\n  In addition, the administrative law judge ordered Orkin to reimburse those customers \r\n  who paid increased rates pursuant to Orkinâ€™s initiative.Â  The Eleventh Circuit \r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed the ALJâ€™s ruling. Orkin Co., Inc. v. Federal Trade \r\n  Commâ€™n, 849 F.2d 1354 (11th Cir. 1988).\r\nAfter Orkin was enjoined from raising rates on \r\n  its pre-1975 contracts, Orkin decided to change its advertising material as \r\n  to the transferability provision as well.Â  For many years, the renewal forms \r\n  Orkin sent to customers contained the statement, â€œ[i]f you sell your property \r\n  this protection can be transferred to the new owner.Â  An excellent selling point \r\n  for you.â€ Orkin removed this language from its renewal forms after the FTC ruling.Â  \r\n\r\nAt trial, Orkinâ€™s president admitted that the FTC \r\n  ruling caused Orkin to lose money and that the company had conducted â€œsome economic \r\n  analysisâ€ to determine its projected losses.Â  During discovery, Orkin did not \r\n  disclose any findings from that analysis. \r\n  [4] Â  In an attempt to show that Orkin had a financial incentive to breach \r\n  the transferability provision in its pre-1975 contracts, the Atkinsons retained \r\n  Dr. Perry Woodside (Woodside), an economist and business professor at the College \r\n  of Charleston, to project (1) Orkinâ€™s current and potential losses for honoring \r\n  the fixed-rate provision; and (2) Orkinâ€™s current and projected gain if Orkin \r\n  dishonored the transferability provision.Â  The Atkinsons offered Woodsideâ€™s \r\n  projections to show that Orkinâ€™s gain from breaching the transferability provision \r\n  would mitigate Orkinâ€™s losses due to the FTC ruling.Â  Over Orkinâ€™s objection, \r\n  the trial judge allowed Woodside to testify that Orkin could have sustained \r\n  â€œstaggeringâ€ losses amounting to $53,872,894 as a result of the FTC ruling.Â  \r\n  In addition, Woodside testified that Orkin could realize a gain of $42,352,548 \r\n  if it dishonored the transferability provision.Â  \r\nThe jury awarded $75,259.33 in compensatory damages \r\n  - $6,191 for the contract claim and $69,068.33 \r\n  [5]  for the negligence claim.Â  The jury also awarded $786,500 in punitive \r\n  damages for the contract claim. [6] \r\n    \r\nIn a post-trial motion, \r\n  Orkin requested that the court reduce the Atkinsonsâ€™ damages award by the amount \r\n  recovered from the Atkinsonsâ€™ settlement with Terminix.Â  Because the trial judge \r\n  found that â€œTerminixâ€™s conduct could be a contributing factor in the neglience \r\n  cause of action and, thus, a contributing factor to Plaintiffâ€™s damages,â€ the \r\n  judge granted Orkinâ€™s motion for set-off.Â  The parties filed notices of cross-appeal \r\n  and submitted the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWas the punitive damages award so excessive as to violate Orkinâ€™s due \r\n  process rights? \r\n   \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDid the trial court err in offsetting the Atkinsonâ€™s judgment by the \r\n  amount received from the settlement with Terminix? \r\n   \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Due Process and Punitive Damages\r\nThe jury returned a verdict \r\n  finding Orkin liable for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act \r\n  and awarded $6,191 in compensatory damages and $786,500 in punitive damages, \r\n  a ratio of approximately approximately 127 to 1.Â  Orkin argues that the punitive \r\n  damages award was so excessive that it violated its right to due process.Â  We \r\n  agree.\r\nThe practice of awarding \r\n  punitive damages originated in principles of criminal law â€œto deter the wrongdoer \r\n  and others from committing like offenses in the future.â€ Laird v. Nationwide \r\n  Ins. Co., 243 S.C. 388, 393, 134 S.E.2d 206, 210 (1964).Â  Historically, \r\n  our courts have recognized that punitive damages are intended to punish a wrongdoer \r\n  when â€œcriminalâ€ conduct is intertwined with civil causes of action.Â  See \r\n  Dorsey D. Ellis, Jr., Fairness and Efficiency in the Law of Punitive Damages, \r\n  56 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1, 12-20 (1982) (describing how the court system has come \r\n  to approve public punishment in private actions by utilizing punitive damages).Â Â  \r\n  This Court has held that â€œ[p]unitive damages also serve to vindicate a private \r\n  right to the injured party.â€¦â€ Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (quoting Harris v. Burnside, 261 S.C. 190, 196, \r\n  199 S.E.2d 65, 68 (1973)).\r\nThe policy behind awarding \r\n  punitive damages must also remain consistent with the principle of penal theory \r\n  that the â€œpunishment should fit the crime.â€ Mathias v. Accor Economy Lodging \r\n  Inc. and Motel 6 Operating L.P., 347 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir. 2003).Â  â€œIn \r\n  sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and \r\n  proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages \r\n  recovered.â€Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 \r\n  U.S. 408, 426 (2003).Â  \r\nBecause punitive damages \r\n  are quasi-criminal in nature, the process of assessing punitive damages is subject \r\n  to the protections of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of \r\n  the United States Constitution.Â  The Due Process Clause insures that â€œa person \r\n  receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment, \r\n  but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose.â€Â  BMW of \r\n  North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 574 (1996).Â  In addition, a defendantâ€™s \r\n  right to reasonable notice should not be diminished simply because the defendant \r\n  is a deep pocket corporation. Id. at 585.Â  For example, in Gore, \r\n  the United States Supreme Court proclaimed, â€œ[t]he fact that BMW is a large \r\n  corporation rather than an impecunious individual does not diminish its entitlement \r\n  to fair notice of the demands that the several States impose on the conduct \r\n  of business.â€ Id.\r\nAfter the parties submitted \r\n  their briefs in the present case, the United States Supreme Court issued its \r\n  opinion in State Farm v. Campbell, which considered whether a \r\n  punitive damages award was so excessive as to violate due process.Â  538 U.S. \r\n  at 416-429.Â  In Campbell, plaintiffs sued State Farm in a Utah trial \r\n  court for bad-faith failure to settle - a legal theory similar to South Carolinaâ€™s \r\n  bad faith (now negligent) failure to settle cause of action set forth in Tyger \r\n  River Pine Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 170 S.C. 286, 170 S.E. 346 (1933).Â  \r\n  During trial, the judge allowed the plaintiffs to present evidence of other \r\n  instances around the nation in which State Farm had refused, in bad faith, to \r\n  settle a clientâ€™s claim.Â  \r\nThe Utah Supreme Court \r\n  noted that State Farm was being punished for its nationwide policies rather \r\n  than for the conduct in the Campbellsâ€™ case and reduced plaintiffsâ€™ punitive \r\n  damages award from $145 million to $25 million.Â  State Farm subsequently petitioned \r\n  the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which the Court granted.Â  \r\n  The Court held that the punitive damages award was so excessive as to violate \r\n  State Farmâ€™s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United \r\n  States Constitution.Â  Campbell, 538 U.S. at 429.\r\nIn determining the constitutionality \r\n  of the punitive damages award, the Campbell Court looked to three guideposts [7]  set forth in Gore: \r\n\r\n(1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendantâ€™s misconduct; (2) the disparity \r\n  between the actual and potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive \r\n  damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by \r\n  the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.\r\n\r\nCampbell, 538 U.S. at 418 (citing Gore, 517 U.S. at 575).Â  In \r\n  addition, the United States Supreme Court applied a de novo standard \r\n  of review and instructed appellate courts to so the same when reviewing punitive \r\n  damage awards. Â Campbell, 538 U.S. at 417 (citing Cooper Indus., Inc. \r\n  v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 435-436 (2001)). \r\nIn the present case, we \r\n  reverse and remand the issue of punitive damages because (1) the trial court \r\n  improperly admitted evidence that unfairly prejudices Orkinâ€™s case; and (2) \r\n  the award is so excessive that it constitutes an irrational and arbitrary deprivation \r\n  of property under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the \r\n  United States Constitution.\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Degree of Reprehensibility of \r\n  Orkinâ€™s Misconduct  \r\nOrkin argues that the trial \r\n  judge caused the degree of reprehensibility of Orkinâ€™s conduct to be unfairly \r\n  inflated by allowing the jury to consider evidence of Orkinâ€™s 1980 initiative \r\n  and Woodsideâ€™s expert testimony concerning Orkinâ€™s current and potential loss \r\n  for honoring the fixed-rate provision in all its pre-1975 contracts.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n\r\nThe first guidepost established \r\n  in Gore is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendantâ€™s misconduct, \r\n  which the United States Supreme Court held is â€œ[t]he most important indicium \r\n  of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.â€¦â€ Gore, 517 U.S. at \r\n  575.Â  The United States Supreme Court has provided state courts with a list \r\n  of considerations to be used in determining the degree of reprehensibility of \r\n  a defendantâ€™s conduct:\r\n\r\nthe harm caused was physical \r\n  as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a \r\n  reckless disregard of the health and safety of others; the target of the conduct \r\n  had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an \r\n  isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, \r\n  or deceit, or mere accident.\r\nâ€¦\r\nThe existence of any one of these \r\n  factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a \r\n  punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.\r\n\r\nCampbell, 538 U.S. at 419.\r\nWe find the evidence of Orkinâ€™s \r\n  1980 initiative and Woodsideâ€™s expert testimony about the initiative unfairly \r\n  amplified the degree of reprehensibility of Orkinâ€™s conduct and, in turn, unfairly \r\n  inflated the amount of punitive damages the jury awarded.Â  \r\n(a) Orkin Initiative Memo\r\nThe Atkinsons argue that Orkin, which was already \r\n  enjoined from breaching the fixed-rate provision, was searching for new ways \r\n  to mitigate the losses of its unprofitable pre-1975 contracts.Â  On the contrary, \r\n  Orkin contends that because the initiative was not related to the conduct in \r\n  the Atkinsonsâ€™ breach of contract claim, the trial judge erred in allowing the \r\n  memo to be admitted.Â  We agree with Orkin.Â  \r\nThe United States Supreme Court considered a similar \r\n  issue in Campbell.Â  During the damages phase, the trial judge allowed \r\n  the plaintiff to present evidence concerning State Farmâ€™s prior conduct, suggesting \r\n  that State Farm had developed a nationwide policy of denying claims and refusing \r\n  to settle claims in bad-faith.Â  The trial court not only allowed testimony of \r\n  State Farmâ€™s conduct toward the Campbells, it accepted testimony concerning \r\n  State Farmâ€™s denial of claims around the country.Â  Much of the evidence concerning \r\n  State Farmâ€™s out-of-state conduct was dissimilar and unrelated to State Farmâ€™s \r\n  conduct toward the Campbells.Â  Because of the dissimilarity in conduct, the \r\n  United States Supreme Court held that State Farmâ€™s out-of-state conduct was \r\n  not admissible to inflate the Campbellsâ€™ punitive damages award:\r\n\r\n[t]he courts awarded punitive \r\n  damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbellâ€™s \r\n  harm.Â  A defendantâ€™s dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability \r\n  was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.Â  A defendant \r\n  should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being \r\n  an unsavory individual or business.Â  Due process does not permit courts, in \r\n  the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other partiesâ€™ \r\n  hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of reprehensibility \r\n  analysisÂ  \r\nâ€¦.\r\nPunishment on these bases creates \r\n  the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct.\r\n\r\nCampbell, 538 U.S. at 422-423.Â Â  \r\nThe â€œsimilarityâ€ analysis conducted in Campbell \r\n  arises from the same general relevance safeguards addressed by Rule 403, SCRE \r\n  (a court shall rule evidence inadmissible if its probative value is substantially \r\n  outweighed by its prejudicial value).Â  The analysis applied in Campbell, \r\n  however, requires us to determine, in the present case, whether evidence of \r\n  the 1980 initiative is â€œsimilar toâ€ the breach of the transferability provision.Â  \r\n  In other words, unless Orkinâ€™s past conduct is â€œsimilarâ€ to the conduct directed \r\n  at the Atkinsons, it is inadmissible.\r\nFor the following reasons, we find Orkinâ€™s initiative \r\n  directing agents to breach the fixed-rate provision (Orkinâ€™s past conduct) is \r\n  dissimilar from Orkinâ€™s breach of the transferability provision in the present \r\n  case.Â  First, Orkinâ€™s past â€œinitiativeâ€ conduct was directed toward existing \r\n  customers, while Orkinâ€™sÂ  â€œtransferabilityâ€ conduct in the present case only \r\n  affected the Atkinsons, who were prospective customers.Â  In addition, those \r\n  affected by Orkinâ€™s past conduct would have coverage but for a higher price, \r\n  while the conduct here forced the Atkinsons to negotiate coverage from an entirely \r\n  different provider.Â  Finally, Orkinâ€™s past conduct involved an attempt to make \r\n  unprofitable contracts profitable, while the conduct in the present case was \r\n  an attempt to get out of an unprofitable contract.Â  \r\nSecond, Orkinâ€™s past conduct arose from an initiative \r\n  developed almost fifteen years before Orkin dishonored the transferability provision \r\n  in the present case.Â  In addition, Orkin was enjoined from unilaterally raising \r\n  rates more than ten years before Orkin had any contractual obligation with the \r\n  Atkinsons.Â  We find that the considerable period of time between Orkinâ€™s past \r\n  conduct and Orkinâ€™s conduct in the present case lends further support to our \r\n  finding that the two are dissimilar.\r\nAllowing the jury to consider \r\n  evidence of Orkinâ€™s breach of the fixed-rate provision was extremely prejudicial \r\n  because it allowed the jury to punish Orkin for conduct unrelated to the conduct \r\n  in the present case.Â  Moreover, at trial, the Atkinsons did not present any \r\n  evidence that Orkin refused to honor the transferability provision on other \r\n  contracts in South Carolina.Â  The fact that Orkin stood to gain financially \r\n  from breaching both provisions of the contract is not sufficient to render the \r\n  two breaches â€œsimilar.â€Â  Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in \r\n  allowing the Atkinsons to present evidence of the Orkin initiative and, in doing \r\n  so, permitted the Atkinsons to unfairly exaggerate the degree of reprehensibility \r\n  of Orkinâ€™s conduct.\r\n(b)Â  Expert Testimony\r\nOrkin argues that the trial \r\n  judge erred in admitting into evidence Woodsideâ€™s expert testimony concerning \r\n  Orkinâ€™s projected losses for honoring the fixed-rate provision of all its pre-1975 \r\n  contracts.Â  We agree. \r\nIt is well settled that \r\n  â€œopinion testimony of an expert may be based upon a hypothetical question.â€Â  \r\n  Gazes v. Dillardâ€™s Depâ€™t Store, Inc., 341 S.C. 507, 514, 534 S.E.2d 306, \r\n  310 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  But â€œthe hypothetical question must be based on facts \r\n  supported by the evidence â€¦.â€Â  Id.\r\nWe hold that Woodsideâ€™s \r\n  testimony as to Orkinâ€™s projected loss from honoring the fixed-rate provision \r\n  of its contracts is inadmissible for the same reasons we find the 1980 initiative \r\n  was inadmissible.Â  This projection is based upon conduct that is too dissimilar \r\n  from the conduct in the present case and is therefore, inadmissible because \r\n  it unfairly inflates the reprehensibility of Orkinâ€™s conduct in the present \r\n  case.\r\nOn the other hand, we are \r\n  much more hesitant to restrict outright Woodsideâ€™s testimony concerning Orkinâ€™s \r\n  gain from breaching the transferability provision in all its pre-1975 contracts.Â  \r\n  This testimony - subject to the evidentiary safeguards of Gazes and Campbell \r\n  - could be probative of the reprehensibility of Orkinâ€™s conduct in the present \r\n  case.\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disparity between compensatory and punitive damage awards\r\nThe jury awarded the Atkinsons $786,500 in punitive \r\n  damages and $6,191 in compensatory damages, representing a 127 to 1 ratio. [8] Â  We hold that such a sizable disparity between \r\n  punitive and compensatory damages establishes a presumption that the punitive \r\n  damages award is an unconstitutional deprivation of property. \r\nThe Campbell opinion provides that â€œfew \r\n  awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, \r\n  to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.â€ \r\n  [9]  538 U.S. at 424 (quoting Gore, 517 U.S. at 582).Â Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  â€œthe Constitutional line [setting forth the appropriate ratio of actual to punitive \r\n  damages] is not marked by a simple mathematical formula.â€ Id.Â  The Court \r\n  emphasized that â€œbecause there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages \r\n  award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may \r\n  comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in \r\n  only a small amount of economic damages.â€ Id.Â  \r\nRecently, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals \r\n  upheld a punitive damages award that exceeded a single-digit ratio where a particularly \r\n  egregious act resulted in small economic damages. Mathias, 347 \r\n  F.3d at 678.Â  In that case, the plaintiff suffered bites from hundreds of bed \r\n  bugs when he and his family rented a hotel room from the defendant.Â  The court \r\n  upheld a punitive damages award that exceeded a single-digit ratio because â€œ[t]he \r\n  defendantâ€™s behavior was outrageous but the compensable harm done was slight \r\n  and at the same time difficult to quantify because a large element of it was \r\n  emotional.â€Â  Id. at 677.\r\nAlthough the amount of compensatory damages in the \r\n  present case was particularly low, Orkinâ€™s acts were not so egregious as to \r\n  warrant a 127 to 1 ratio.Â  Therefore, we hold that the Atkinsons have failed \r\n  to rebut the presumption that the three-digit, punitive-compensatory damages \r\n  ratios in this case is unconstitutional.Â  \r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanctions for Comparable Misconduct  \r\nFinally, Campbell requires us to consider \r\n  cases involving comparable conduct to determine whether the ratio in the case \r\n  before us is unconstitutional.Â  After reviewing cases involving breach of contract \r\n  with a fraudulent act, we find that the 1 to 127 ratio awarded in this case \r\n  is well above the average compensatory-punitive damages ratio.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 466 S.E.2d \r\n  727 (1996) (upholding a punitive damage award that was approximately 28 times \r\n  compensatory damages); Pinkney v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 268 S.C. 430, \r\n  234 S.E.2d 654 (1977) (upholding an award of $5,000 compensatory damages and \r\n  $4,000 punitive damages).Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The Collateral Source Rule\r\nThe Atkinsons argue that proceeds from their settlement with Terminix \r\n  was a â€œcollateral source,â€ and therefore Orkin was not entitled to any set-off.Â  \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nAccording to the collateral source rule, a wrongdoer \r\n  should not receive a windfall simply because the injured party received compensation \r\n  from an independent source.Â  Rattenni v. Grainger, 298 S.C. 276, 379 \r\n  S.E.2d 890 (1989).Â  Moreover, this rule has been liberally applied in South \r\n  Carolina to preclude the reduction of damages.Â  See Otis Elevator v. Hardin \r\n  Constr. Co., 316 S.C. 292, 450 S.E.2d 41 (1994) (contractual right to indemnification \r\n  not defeated by fact that loss was actually paid by an insurance company); Rattenni, \r\n  298 S.C. at 277, 379 S.E.2d at 892 (1989) (tortfeasorâ€™s liability for damages \r\n  not reduced by underinsurance proceeds); Powers v. Temple, 250 S.C. 149, \r\n  156 S.E.2d 759 (1976) (tortfeasorâ€™s liability for damages not reduced by disability \r\n  payments from employer).Â  To qualify as a collateral source, the source must \r\n  be â€œwholly independent of the wrongdoer.â€Â  Citizens and S. Natâ€™l Bank of \r\n  South Carolina v. Gregory, 320 S.C. 90, 92, 463 S.E.2d 317, 318 (1995).Â  \r\n\r\nIn a post-trial motion, Orkin asked the court to reduce the judgment by \r\n  the amount the Atkinsons recovered from their settlement with Terminix. Because \r\n  the judge viewed Terminix and Orkin as joint tortfeasors, the judge reduced \r\n  the amount Orkin owed by the amount Terminix had already paid in settlement.Â  \r\n  The trial judge also reasoned that the negligence claim was â€œgeneral in natureâ€ \r\n  and that â€œTerminixâ€™s conduct could be a contributing factor in this cause of \r\n  action and, thus, a contributing factor to Plaintiffâ€™s damages under the negligence \r\n  cause of action.â€ \r\nWe find that the trial judge erred in treating \r\n  Orkin and Terminix as joint-tortfeasors.Â  The duties that Orkin and Terminix \r\n  owed the Atkinsons were based upon independent, unrelated contracts, not a common \r\n  duty of care.Â  Moreover, we see no indication that the claims against Terminix \r\n  constituted a â€œcontributing factorâ€ to Orkinâ€™s negligent inspection of the house. \r\n  Accordingly, we hold that the proceeds from the Terminix settlement was a collateral \r\n  source, and therefore the trial court erred in offseting the judgment, by the \r\n  amount the Atkinsons received in settlement.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe recognize that Orkinâ€™s \r\n  breach of the transferability provision in the contract with the Atkinsons will \r\n  support a jury award of significant punitive damages.Â  Nevertheless, after applying \r\n  the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s holding in Campbell, we reverse and \r\n  remand this case on the issue of the amount of punitive damages awarded, with \r\n  instructions that on retrial of the issue of the amount of punitive damages, \r\n  evidence of Orkinâ€™s 1980 initiative and Woodsideâ€™s expert testimony concerning \r\n  Orkinâ€™s current and potential losses for honoring the fixed-rate provision of \r\n  its pre-1975 contracts must not be admitted.Â  \r\nWe also reverse the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to offset the proceeds from the Atkinsonsâ€™ settlement with \r\n  Terminix.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the juryâ€™s award of $75,259.33 in actual damages \r\n  without setting off that amount by the $31,111.75 the Atkinsons received in \r\n  their settlement with Terminix.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Initially, the Atkinsons sued both Terminix Service, Inc. (Terminix) \r\n    and Orkin but settled with Terminix for $31,111.75 before trial. \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2] In 1975, Orkin changed its contracts omitting the fixed-rate \r\n    provision and including language allowing Orkin to unilaterally increase renewal \r\n    rates.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The trial court found that Beck, as manager of Orkinâ€™s Charleston \r\n    branch, was Orkinâ€™s agent, and therefore Orkin was vicariously liable for \r\n    Beckâ€™s actions.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The trial judge found that Orkin abused the discovery process \r\n    and sanctioned Orkin $25,000.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  The negligence award breaks down into $10,268.33 for expenses \r\n    the Atkinsons incurred before trial and $58,800 in repair costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [6] The trial judge permitted the jury to review Orkinâ€™s 1999 \r\n    financial statement during its consideration of punitive damages.Â  The punitive \r\n    damages award constituted one percent of Orkinâ€™s net worth that year.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  The Campbell Court used the word â€œguidepostâ€ to emphasize \r\n    its intent to create a guide, not a bright-line rule.Â  Campbell, 538 \r\n    U.S. at 424.Â  For example, Judge Posner of the Seventh Circuit recently explained \r\n    that it is not necessary for courts to follow rigid mathematical rules when \r\n    reviewing a punitive damages award:Â  â€œWhat follows from these principles, \r\n    however, is that punitive damages should be admeasured by standards or rules \r\n    rather than in a completely ad hoc manner, and this does not tell us what \r\n    the maximum ratio of punitive to compensatory damages should be in a particular \r\n    case.â€Â  Mathias, 347 F.3d at 676.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  The jury found for the Atkinsons on both the breach of contract \r\n    accompanied by a fraudulent act and negligence claims.Â  The punitive damages \r\n    award attached to the breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act claim, \r\n    which was the only cause of action in the complaint that warrants punitive \r\n    damages. See Scott v. Porter, 340 S.C. 158, 172, 530 S.E.2d \r\n    389, 396 (2000) (holding that it is only proper for a jury to award punitive \r\n    damages for a negligence claim when that negligence was wilful, wanton, or \r\n    reckless); Wright v. Public Savings Life Ins. Co., 262 S.C. 285, 289, \r\n    204 S.E.2d 57, 59 (1974) (holding punitive damages may be awarded when a breach \r\n    of contract is accompanied by a fraudulent act).Â  Therefore, we did not include \r\n    the juryâ€™s compensatory damages award as to Orkinâ€™s simple negligence in our \r\n    computation of the ratio. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]  The Campbell Court recites a long history of statutory \r\n    sanctions concerning double, treble, or quadruple damages awarded to deter \r\n    and punish.Â  The Court provides that â€œwhile they are not binding, they are \r\n    instructiveâ€ in that they all provide single-digit ratios.

Dudek, and Jeffrey P. Bloom, both of \r\n  Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John \r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: This is a death penalty case.Â  Appellant pleaded \r\n  guilty to murder, kidnapping, and first-degree criminal sexual conduct with \r\n  a minor.Â  With respect to the murder, the circuit court found the following \r\n  aggravating circumstances: Appellant committed the murder while in the commission \r\n  of criminal sexual conduct; Appellant committed the murder while in the commission \r\n  of a kidnapping; and Appellant murdered a child eleven years old or younger.Â  \r\n  The circuit court sentenced Appellant to death. \r\n  [1] Â  This opinion consolidates Appellantâ€™s direct appeal and the sentence \r\n  review required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (2003).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe victim, a six-year-old boy, was taken into a wooded area of a park, raped, \r\n  and strangled to death.Â  After newspapers reported the murder, Appellant told \r\n  his sister that he had committed the crime.Â  Appellantâ€™s sister reported this \r\n  to the police and disclosed Appellantâ€™s location.Â  The police found and detained \r\n  Appellant, and he confessed.Â  \r\nAppellant was charged with murder, kidnapping, and first-degree criminal sexual \r\n  conduct with a minor.Â  At the plea hearing, Appellant expressed the desire to \r\n  plead guilty but was uncertain whether he wanted to later present evidence that \r\n  he was mentally ill at the time of the crime (guilty but mentally ill or GBMI). \r\n  [2] Â  Appellant never suggested that he wanted to plead guilty only if found \r\n  mentally ill.Â  Rather, Appellant repeatedly stated that he knew he wanted to \r\n  admit guilt.Â  Moreover, Appellant claimed to understand that if he were to present \r\n  evidence of mental illness and the court were to find him GBMI, death would \r\n  remain a possible sentence. [3] \r\nThe court proceeded with the hearing on the guilty plea while permitting Appellant \r\n  to defer the decision whether to claim mental illness.Â  Upon the courtâ€™s inquiry \r\n  Appellant claimed to understand that by pleading guilty he waived his right \r\n  to a jury trial on both guilt and sentencing.Â  When the judge asked if Appellant \r\n  wanted to impanel a jury, admit guilt, and ask the jury to decide the sentence, \r\n  Appellant answered in the negative.Â  The court accepted Appellantâ€™s guilty plea \r\n  as voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently entered.Â  \r\nAt a later hearing, Appellant did present evidence that he was mentally ill \r\n  when the crime occurred.Â  An expert testified that Appellantâ€™s mental condition \r\n  rendered him unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, that \r\n  is, he was mentally ill.Â  Two other experts testified that Appellant was not \r\n  mentally ill, that he could so conform his conduct.Â  After considering the evidence, \r\n  the court ruled that Appellant failed to prove he was GBMI. \r\n  [4] Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt sentencing the court found the three aggravating circumstances stated above.Â  \r\n  In addition, even though Appellantâ€™s attorneys represented that Appellant had \r\n  instructed them to neither â€œoffer any mitigation to the courtâ€ nor â€œargue to \r\n  the court for a sentence of life without parole,â€ the court found four mitigating \r\n  circumstances. [5] Â  After considering both sets of circumstances, \r\n  the court sentenced Appellant to death.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;Whether Appellantâ€™s guilty plea was an invalid conditional plea.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Whether Appellant had a right to a jury trial on sentencing of which \r\n  he was deprived.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Whether the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence \r\n  Appellant to death because the indictment did not allege aggravating circumstances.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  The Plea\r\nAppellant claims his guilty plea was a conditional plea and therefore \r\n  invalid.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina, guilty pleas must be unconditional.Â  State v. Peppers, \r\n  346 S.C. 502, 504, 552 S.E.2d 288, 289 (2001); State v. Oâ€™Leary, \r\n  302 S.C. 17, 18, 393 S.E.2d 186, 187 (1990); State v. Truesdale, \r\n  278 S.C. 368, 370, 296 S.E.2d 528, 529 (1982).Â  If â€œan accused attempts to attach \r\n  any condition or qualificationâ€ to a guilty plea, then â€œthe trial court should \r\n  direct a plea of not guilty.â€Â  Truesdale, 278 S.C. at 370, 296 S.E.2d \r\n  at 529.Â  If the trial court accepts a conditional guilty plea, then the plea \r\n  will be vacated on appeal.Â  Peppers, 346 S.C. at 505, 552 S.E.2d at 290.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAppellant asserts his plea was conditional because he pleaded guilty while \r\n  deferring the decision whether to present evidence of mental illness.Â  Appellant \r\n  argues the potential of being found mentally ill constituted a condition attached \r\n  to his plea.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAppellant never attempted to reserve the right to later deny his guilt.Â  He \r\n  reserved the right only to present evidence that he committed the crime while \r\n  mentally ill.Â  Guilty but mentally ill is still guilty.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-24-70 (2003) (requiring that a GBMI defendant be sentenced as guilty); \r\n  see also State v. Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121, 126, 484 S.E.2d 869, \r\n  872 (1997) (noting that a finding of GBMI â€œdoes not absolve a defendant of guiltâ€).Â  \r\n  The difference between guilty and GBMI pertains only to post-sentencing medical \r\n  treatment.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-70 (2003).Â  Appellantâ€™s guilty \r\n  plea was unconditional.\r\nII.Â  The Sentencing Procedure\r\nAppellant asserts Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 153 \r\n  L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), renders unconstitutional the requirement in S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-3-20(B) (2003) that the sentencing proceeding be held before the judge \r\n  when a defendant pleads guilty to murder.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe capital-sentencing procedure invalidated in Ring does not exist \r\n  in South Carolina.Â  Arizonaâ€™s statute required the judge to factually determine \r\n  whether there existed an aggravating circumstance supporting the death penalty \r\n  regardless whether the judge or a jury had determined guilt.Â  Ariz. Rev. Stat. \r\n  Â§ 13-703(C) (2001) (amended 2002); Ring, 536 U.S. at 597, 122 S. Ct. \r\n  at 2437, 153 L.Ed.2d at 569.Â  In South Carolina, conversely, a defendant convicted \r\n  by a jury can be sentenced to death only if the jury also finds an aggravating \r\n  circumstance and recommends the death penalty.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B) \r\n  (2003); Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 652, 594 S.E.2d 462, 466 (2004).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn any event, Ring did not involve jury-trial waivers and is not implicated \r\n  when a defendant pleads guilty.Â  Other courts have also reached this conclusion.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., Leone v. Indiana, 797 N.E.2d 743, 749-50 (Ind. \r\n  2003); Colwell v. Nevada, 118 Nev. 807, 59 P.3d 463, 473-74 (Nev. 2003); \r\n  Illinois v. Altom, 338 Ill.App.3d 355, 362, 788 N.E.2d 55, 61 (Ill. App. \r\n  5 Dist. 2003), app. denied, 203 Ill.2d 663, 792 N.E.2d 308 (Ill. 2003).Â  \r\n\r\nAppellant was informed that by pleading guilty he waived his right to a jury \r\n  trial on both guilt and sentencing.Â  He does not argue his waiver was made involuntarily, \r\n  unknowingly, or unintelligently.Â  See Burnett v. State, 352 S.C. \r\n  589, 576 S.E.2d 144 (2003) (discussing waivers of constitutional rights).Â  Appellant \r\n  was not deprived of his right to a jury trial.\r\nIII.Â  The Indictment\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to sentence him to death because the indictment charging him with murder \r\n  [6]  did not allege an aggravating circumstance. [7] Â  Appellant did not challenge \r\n  the indictment below, but subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, \r\n  including on appeal.Â  See Koon v. State, 358 S.C. 359, 365, 595 \r\n  S.E.2d 456, 459 (2004).Â  We disagree with Appellant on the merits. \r\nAppellant asserts Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, \r\n  147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and Ring v. Arizona, supra, mandate \r\n  that indictments in state capital cases allege aggravation.Â  Appellant is incorrect.Â  \r\n  The Court expressly noted in both Apprendi and Ring that the cases \r\n  did not involve challenges to state indictments.Â  Apprendi, 530 U.S. \r\n  at 477, 120 S. Ct. at 2356, 147 L.Ed.2d at 447 n. 3; Ring, 536 U.S. at \r\n  597, 122 S. Ct. at 2437, 153 L.Ed.2d at 569 n. 4.Â  More important, the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment has not been construed to incorporate the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s Presentment \r\n  or Indictment Clause.Â  See Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 477, 120 S. Ct. \r\n  at 2356, 147 L.Ed.2d at 447 n. 3; Ring, 530 U.S. at 597, 122 S. Ct. at \r\n  2437, 153 L.Ed.2d at 569 n. 4; Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. \r\n  625, 633, 92 S. Ct. 1221, 1226-27, 31 L.Ed.2d 536, 543-44 (1972); Hurtado \r\n  v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 534-35, 4 S. Ct. 111, 120-21, 28 L.Ed. 232, \r\n  238 (1884).Â  State law governs indictments for state-law crimes.Â  \r\nUnder South Carolina law, aggravating circumstances need \r\n  not be alleged in an indictment for murder.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-30 (2003); \r\n  State v. Butler, 277 S.C. 452, 456-57, 290 S.E.2d 1, 3-4 (1982) (subsequent \r\n  history omitted).Â  The aggravating circumstances listed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  16-3-20(C)(a) (2003) are sentencing factors, not elements of murder.Â  See \r\n  Butler, 277 S.C. atÂ  456-67, 290 S.E.2d at 3-4.Â  The circuit court had \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to sentence Appellant to death.\r\nSENTENCE REVIEW\r\nThe Court must conduct a proportionality review of Appellantâ€™s death sentence \r\n  based on the record.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(A) (2003).Â  In conducting the \r\n  review, the Court considers similar cases in which the death penalty has been \r\n  upheld.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(E) (2003).\r\nWe find Appellantâ€™s death sentence was not the result of passion, \r\n  prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the evidence supports the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s findings of aggravation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) \r\n  (2003).Â  Further, in relation to sentences in similar cases, Appellantâ€™s was \r\n  neither excessive nor disproportionate to his crime.Â  See State \r\n  v. Passaro, 350 S.C. 499, 567 S.E.2d 862 (2002); State v. Stokes, \r\n  345 S.C. 368, 548 S.E.2d 202 (2001); State v. Rogers, 338 S.C. 435, 527 \r\n  S.E.2d 101 (2000); State v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, 518 S.E.2d \r\n  588 (1999); State v. Charping, 333 S.C. 124, 508 S.E.2d 851 (1998), cert. \r\n  denied, Charping v. South Carolina, 527 U.S. 1007, 119 S. Ct. 2345, \r\n  144 L.Ed.2d 241 (1999); State v. Conyers, 326 S.C. 263, 487 S.E.2d 181 \r\n  (1997).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellantâ€™s guilty plea was not a conditional \r\n  plea, and Appellant was not deprived of his right to a jury trial.Â  In addition, \r\n  the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to sentence Appellant to death.Â  \r\n  Finally, the punishment was proportionate to the crime.Â  Appellantâ€™s guilty \r\n  plea and sentence are\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Appellant was not sentenced for the kidnapping \r\n    or first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-910 \r\n    (2003) does not permit a sentence for kidnapping if the defendant is sentenced \r\n    for murder. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  A defendant is GBMI if at the time of the offense, \r\n    â€œhe had the capacity to distinguish right from wrong or to recognize his act \r\n    as being wrong as defined in Section 17-24-10(A), but because of mental disease \r\n    or defect he lacked sufficient capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements \r\n    of the law.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-20(A) (2003).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-70 (2003) requires that \r\n    a defendant found GBMI be sentenced â€œas provided by law for a defendant found \r\n    guilty.â€Â  This Court has held it is constitutional to sentence a GBMI defendant \r\n    to death.Â  State v. Wilson, 306 S.C. 498, 512, 413 S.E.2d 19, 27 (1992) \r\n    (subsequent history omitted).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The defendant has the burden of proving mental \r\n    illness by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-20(D) \r\n    (2003).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  First, Appellant had â€œno significant history of prior criminal \r\n    conviction involving the use of violence against another person.â€Â  Second, \r\n    Appellant committed the murder while â€œunder the influence of mental or emotional \r\n    disturbance.â€Â  Third, Appellantâ€™s capacity â€œto appreciate the criminality \r\n    of his act or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially \r\n    impaired.â€Â  And fourth, Appellantâ€™s age or mentality at the time of the crime \r\n    weighed in his favor.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  The indictment stated Appellant â€œdid in Aiken \r\n    County on or about April 17, 1999, with malice aforethought, kill [the victim] \r\n    by means of asphyxia due to manual strangulation and said victim died as a \r\n    proximate result thereof.Â  All in violation of Section 16-3-10 of the South \r\n    Carolina Code of Laws (1976), as amended.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [7]    The State timely gave Appellant notice of aggravation \r\n    pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.

Barber, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25885\r\nSubmitted September 23, 2004 - Filed \r\n  October 25, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General \r\n  Elizabeth R. McMahon, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nActing Deputy Chief Attorney Wanda P. Hagler, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  We granted certiorari to determine \r\n  whether the post-conviction relief (PCR) court erred by finding counsel ineffective \r\n  for promising respondent a specific sentence.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent pled guilty to third-degree arson, second-degree burglary, \r\n  criminal conspiracy, and malicious injury to property.Â  He received ten-year \r\n  concurrent sentences for the arson and injury to property charges.Â  He also \r\n  received fifteen years imprisonment for second-degree burglary and five years \r\n  imprisonment for conspiracy.Â  Those sentences were each to be served consecutive \r\n  to the ten-year imprisonment terms for a total imprisonment period of thirty \r\n  years.Â  Respondent did not appeal.Â  Thereafter, his PCR application was granted.\r\nRespondent and Michael Easter (Easter) vandalized White Knoll High School, \r\n  causing approximately $250,000 in damage.Â  During the plea proceeding, the solicitor \r\n  submitted respondentâ€™s prior criminal record and informed the plea court there \r\n  were no plea negotiations and that the solicitor felt consecutive sentences \r\n  would be appropriate.\r\nBefore accepting respondentâ€™s guilty plea, the plea court questioned \r\n  respondent extensively about the plea, asking him, inter alia, whether \r\n  he understood he could get fifteen years for second-degree burglary, ten years \r\n  for arson, ten years for malicious injury to property, and five years for criminal \r\n  conspiracy and whether he had been promised anything for pleading guilty.\r\nThe plea court sentenced respondentâ€™s accomplice in the crimes, Easter, earlier \r\n  the same day.Â  Easter was given a total sentence of twenty-two years imprisonment.Â  \r\n  At respondentâ€™s plea proceeding, before sentencing respondent, the court noted \r\n  several factors he had considered in arriving at a sentence for respondent.Â  \r\n  First, that respondentâ€™s record was more severe than Easterâ€™s.Â  Second, that \r\n  both respondent and Easter had cooperated with law enforcement.Â  Finally, the \r\n  court stated the sentence he gave would send a message to the public to stay \r\n  away from schools and other public institutions.Â  The court then sentenced respondent \r\n  to a total imprisonment period of thirty years.\r\nRespondent testified at \r\n  the PCR hearing that he initially informed counsel that if his sentence would \r\n  be more than twenty years, then he would go to trial.Â  Respondent testified \r\n  that, on the day of the plea, counsel told him he had talked to the plea judge \r\n  and the judge told counsel respondent would get a sentence comparable to Easterâ€™s \r\n  twenty-two year sentence.Â  Respondent testified counsel gave him his word that \r\n  he would not get more than twenty or twenty-two years if he pled guilty.Â  Respondent \r\n  stated if he had known an agreement did not exist whereby he would receive a \r\n  sentence comparable to Easterâ€™s sentence, he would not have pled guilty but \r\n  would have gone to trial.\r\nCounsel testified he explained \r\n  the maximum sentencing range to respondent and that there was no plea deal.Â  \r\n  He stated he told respondent he felt this particular judge would not give consecutive \r\n  sentences for those charges.\r\nCounsel testified the plea \r\n  court, which had just heard Easterâ€™s plea, told counsel he did not see why the \r\n  sentences for respondent would be any different from Easterâ€™s, unless he heard \r\n  something new and different during the plea.Â  Counsel stated he repeated this \r\n  information to respondent and told him he felt comfortable respondent would \r\n  receive a sentence in the twenty-two year range, but he did not guarantee such \r\n  a sentence.Â  Counsel testified that if he had known the sentence would have \r\n  differed that much from Easterâ€™s, he would have recommended going to trial.\r\nThe PCR court \r\n  found that because counsel advised respondent he would receive a sentence comparable \r\n  to Easterâ€™s sentence, counsel was ineffective.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err by finding counsel ineffective for promising respondent \r\n  a specific sentence?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTo prove counsel ineffective when a guilty plea is challenged, petitioner must \r\n  show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that, but for counselâ€™s errors, \r\n  there is a reasonable probability a guilty plea would not have been entered.Â  \r\n  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985); Jordan v. State, 297 S.C. \r\n  52, 374 S.E.2d 683 (1988).Â  A defendant who pleads guilty upon the advice of \r\n  counsel may attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea \r\n  only by showing the advice he received from counsel was not within the range \r\n  of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.Â  Carter v. State, \r\n  329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998) (quotations and citation omitted).\r\nWhile counsel told respondent the plea court had indicated he would \r\n  likely give respondent a sentence comparable to Easterâ€™s twenty-two year sentence, \r\n  counsel made no promises.Â  He also informed respondent there were no plea negotiations \r\n  and informed him of the possible range of sentences.Â  Further, the plea court \r\n  informed respondent of the maximum sentences he could receive for the charges \r\n  prior to respondentâ€™s plea being entered.Â  The plea court also asked respondent \r\n  whether he understood there were no promises made regarding his guilty plea.Â  \r\n  Respondentâ€™s answers to those questions reflect an awareness of the potential \r\n  range of sentences and an understanding that he had not been promised anything \r\n  in return for his guilty plea.Â  Accordingly, counselâ€™s performance was not deficient \r\n  even though he related his belief to respondent that the court would give a \r\n  twenty-two year sentence instead of the thirty years respondent received.Â  See \r\n  Wolfe v. State, 326 S.C. 158, 485 S.E.2d 367 (1997) (fact defendant â€œhopedâ€ \r\n  and â€œexpectedâ€ to get reduced sentence does not render plea invalid; â€œwishful \r\n  thinking regarding sentencing does not equal a misapprehension concerning the \r\n  possible range of sentencesâ€); Harres v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 318 S.E.2d \r\n  360 (1984) (fact defendant â€œthoughtâ€ judge would give lighter sentence not ground \r\n  for relief); State v. Dozier, 263 S.C. 267, 210 S.E.2d 225 (1974) (disparate \r\n  sentences between co-defendants is not per se abuse of discretion); cf. \r\n  Knox v. State, 340 S.C. 81, 530 S.E.2d 887 (2000) (to be knowing and \r\n  voluntary, plea must be entered with awareness of consequences of plea, i.e. \r\n  proper advice by judge on mandatory minimum sentencing).\r\nTherefore, the PCR court erred by granting respondent relief for \r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  See Gilchrist v. State, 350 \r\n  S.C. 221, 565 S.E.2d 281 (2002) (Court will not uphold findings of PCR court \r\n  if no probative evidence supports those findings).\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
