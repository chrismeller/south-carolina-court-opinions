Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 626 S.E.2d 59 (2006).Â  We affirm, in result, and\r\n  reverse in part.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner,\r\n  William R. Douglas, was convicted of committing a lewd act on a minor.Â  The\r\n  Victim, who was 10 years old at the time of trial, testified she was molested\r\n  by Douglas when she was 7 years old.Â  When the Victim told her Grandmother about\r\n  the abuse one year later, she was taken to see Gwen Herod, the Sumter County\r\n  Victimâ€™s Assistance Officer.Â  \r\nHerod\r\n  testified at trial that she conducts â€œforensic interviewsâ€ with child victims\r\n  and follows the children through the court system.Â  Douglas objected to her\r\n  qualification as an expert, contending there is no such field of expertise.Â  Douglas also asserted Herodâ€™s testimony improperly bolstered Victimâ€™s testimony and was\r\n  unduly prejudicial.Â  The court qualified Herod as an expert, finding her testimony\r\n  relevant and admissible. Â \r\nHerod\r\n  testified before the jury that she does â€œforensic interviewingâ€ using the RATAC\r\n  method.[1]Â \r\n  Herod testified that she had testified in court several times before.Â  Although\r\n  she did not have a college degree, she had attended a 40-hour training course\r\n  on forensic interviewing, and had completed two weeks of training classes.Â  She\r\n  had been a victimâ€™s advocate for the solicitorâ€™s office for eleven years, and\r\n  had interviewed hundreds of victims.Â  According to Herod, the RATAC method is\r\n  used nationwide and is known as forensic interviewing of children.Â  \r\nHerod\r\n  testified before the jury about the RATAC method, stating:\r\n\r\n  During the rapport stage, Iâ€™m building a rapport with this child,\r\n    we are talking about school or things that she enjoys, Iâ€™m introducing myself\r\n    to her, telling her what my role is and going over the rules of the interview,\r\n    we talk a lot about telling the truth and telling a lie and we make an\r\n    agreement with each other that I will tell her the truth and that she will tell\r\n    me the truth, if we get past that, if the child agrees to do that, we go on to\r\n    name, I find out about their family . . . \r\n\r\nHerod then\r\n  testified she utilized the RATAC method with Victim in this case, and that as a\r\n  result, she received information which led her to conclude a follow up was\r\n  necessary, and that the victim needed to go to the Durant Center for a medical\r\n  evaluation.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s qualification of Herod as an expert\r\n  in the field of forensic interviewing.Â  The Court of Appeals further found\r\n  that, in any event, Herodâ€™s testimony was harmless and did not improperly\r\n  bolster Victimâ€™s testimony.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the\r\n  Court of Appeals err in affirming the qualification of Herod as an expert in\r\n  the field of forensic interviewing, and in affirming admission of her\r\n  testimony?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals held â€œthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding\r\n  Herod had â€˜acquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the\r\n  subject matter of [her] testimony as would enable [her] to give guidance and\r\n  assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope\r\n  of the juryâ€™s good judgment and common knowledge.â€™â€Â  Douglas, 367 S.C.\r\n  at 519, 626 S.E.2d at 70.Â  (Internal citation omitted).Â  The Court of Appeals\r\n  also found the trial court had sufficient evidence that forensic interviewing\r\n  was a recognized field, and that, in any event, any error was harmless.Â  Under\r\n  the facts presented here, we find it was unnecessary for Herod to be qualified\r\n  as an expert.Â  \r\nPursuant\r\n  to Rule 601, SCRE, every person is competent to be a witness unless otherwise\r\n  provided by statute or the rules.Â  Rule 602, SCRE, prohibits a witness from\r\n  testifying to matters unless evidence is introduced sufficient to demonstrate\r\n  the witness has personal knowledge.Â  Rule 602 is subject to the provisions of\r\n  Rule 703, SCRE, which provides:\r\n\r\n  The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert\r\n    bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the\r\n    expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts\r\n    in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the\r\n    facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.\r\n\r\nLay\r\n  witnesses are permitted to offer testimony in the form of opinions or\r\n  inferences if the opinions or inferences are rationally based on the witnessâ€™\r\n  perception, and will aid the jury in understanding testimony, and do not\r\n  require special knowledge.Â  Rule 701, SCRE; State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 (1996). Â \r\nHere, Herod\r\n  testified she had been employed as the Sumter County victimâ€™s assistance\r\n  officer since 1998.Â  Although she did not have a college degree, she had\r\n  attended a 40-hour training course on forensic interviewing, and had completed\r\n  two weeks of training classes.Â  She had interviewed hundreds of victims and had\r\n  testified in court several times before.Â  Herod testified she had been back for\r\n  follow up courses and advanced courses and that there was a monthly national\r\n  newsletter in order to enable her to keep up with things going on nationwide\r\n  regarding the forensic interviewing process.Â  \r\nHerod\r\n  also testified as to her utilization of the R-A-T-A-C method to establish a\r\n  rapport with child victims, and testified as to her interview with the victim\r\n  in this case.Â  Ultimately, Herod testified that based on the interview, it was\r\n  her opinion the victim needed to go to the Durant Center for a medical exam.Â Â Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  the testimony given by Herod in the present case simply was not required to be\r\n  presented by an expert witness.[2]Â \r\n  Herod testified only as to her personal observations and experiences, and her\r\n  interview with the Victim in this case.Â  Accordingly, we find it was\r\n  unnecessary for the trial court to have qualified her as an expert.Â  However, although\r\n  Herod did not need to be so qualified in this case, we nonetheless affirm the\r\n  result reached by the Court of Appeals, because Douglas suffered no prejudice either\r\n  as a result of Herodâ€™s testimony or by her qualification as an expert.Â  \r\nDouglas contends, in part, that Herodâ€™s testimony was unduly prejudicial inasmuch as the\r\n  jury was likely to give her testimony undue weight simply because of her\r\n  qualification as an expert.Â  Such a contention is untenable.Â  The same tests\r\n  which are commonly applied in the evaluation of ordinary evidence are to be\r\n  used in judging the weight and sufficiency of expert testimony.Â  Anderson v. Campbell Tile Co., 202 S.C. 54, 24 S.E.2d 104 (1943). Â As with\r\n  any witness, the jury is free to accept or reject the testimony of an expert\r\n  witness.Â  State v. Milian-Hernandez, 287 S.C. 183, 186, 336 S.E.2d 476,\r\n  478 (1985).Â  The fact that Herod was qualified as an expert did not require the\r\n  jury to accord her testimony any greater weight than that given to any other\r\n  witness.Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nDouglas further asserts that Herodâ€™s testimony could have been construed by the jury as\r\n  vouching for Victimâ€™s veracity, such that it should have been excluded under\r\n  Rule 403, SCRE, because its prejudicial impact outweighed its probative value.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  Initially, we note that the Court of Appeals concluded that\r\n  â€œ[t]he only reasonable inference the jury could have drawn from Herodâ€™s\r\n  testimony is that she believed the victim told the truth about being sexually\r\n  assaulted.â€Â  367 S.C. at 520, 626 S.E.2d at 71.Â  This was error.Â Â  Herod never\r\n  stated she believed Victim; she did not even state the Victim in this case\r\n  agreed to tell her the truth, and she gave no indication concerning Victimâ€™s\r\n  veracity.Â  Herod testified only that, in conducting forensic interviews and\r\n  building a rapport with a child, they talk about things.Â  She stated, â€œIâ€™m\r\n  introducing myself to her, telling her what my role is and going over the rules\r\n  of the interview, we talk a lot about telling the truth and telling a lie and\r\n  we make an agreement with each other that I will tell her the truth and that\r\n  she will tell me the truth, if we get past that, if the child agrees to do\r\n  that, we go on.â€Â  There is no evidence whatsoever that Herod believed the\r\n  Victim to be telling the truth.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that\r\n  the only reasonable inference is that Herod believed Victim was telling the\r\n  truth is reversed. \r\nMoreover, the only opinion given by Herod was that she\r\n  concluded Victim needed a medical exam. Â A pediatric nurse practitioner thereafter\r\n  examined Victim and determined she had vaginal tearing and scarring consistent\r\n  with past penetration. Â In light of this evidence, there is no conceivable\r\n  prejudice to Douglas from Herodâ€™s testimony.Â  Accord State v.\r\n    Shumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) (probative value of the rape\r\n  trauma evidence outweighed prejudicial effect).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nGiven\r\n  the nature of Herodâ€™s testimony, which was based upon her own personal\r\n  observations and discussions with child victims, we find it was unnecessary to\r\n  qualify her as an expert in this case.Â Â  Herod testified to the manner in which\r\n  she conducts interviews, and testified as to her recommendation upon\r\n  interviewing the Victim in this case.Â  This testimony simply did not need to be\r\n  in the form of expert testimony.Â  Accordingly, to the extent the Court of\r\n  Appeals upheld the qualification of Herod as an expert in this case, its\r\n  opinion is reversed.Â  However, because Herodâ€™s testimony did not vouch for the\r\n  veracity of the Victim, and was not prejudicial to Douglas, we affirm the\r\n  result reached by the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\nREVERSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\nÂ TOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority\r\n  that the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the qualification of Herod.Â \r\n  However, because I find that Herodâ€™s testimony was prejudicial to the\r\n  defendant, I respectfully dissent, and would remand for a new trial.\r\nIn my opinion, it\r\n  was not only unnecessary but improper for the circuit court to qualify Herod as\r\n  an expert witness.Â  This Courtâ€™s jurisprudence and Rule 702 of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Evidence emphasize the role of the trial court as the\r\n  gatekeeper in determining, among other things, whether the expertâ€™s testimony\r\n  consists of scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge that will assist\r\n  the trier of fact. Fields v. J. Haynes Water Builders, Inc., 376 S.C.\r\n  545, 658 S.E.2d 80 (2008); Rule 702, SCRE.Â  In my opinion, while much of\r\n  Herodâ€™s factual testimony was admissible, it did not assist the jury in\r\n  assessing matters beyond its common knowledge and was therefore not proper\r\n  expert testimony.Â  \r\nHerodâ€™s\r\n  testimony went to an ultimate issue for the jury: the victimâ€™s credibility.Â \r\n  Herod testified that in applying the RATAC method, she and the victim â€œtalk a\r\n  lot about telling the truth and telling a lie and we make an agreement with\r\n  each other that I will tell her the truth and that she will tell me the truthâ€\r\n  and â€œif the child agrees to do thatâ€ Herod continues the interview.Â  Herod\r\n  testified that after concluding the interview, she determined â€œthat [the\r\n  victim] needed to go to the Durant Center for a medical exam . . . .â€Â  I agree\r\n  with the Court of Appeals that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from\r\n  Herodâ€™s testimony is that, based upon her training, she believed that the\r\n  victim was being truthful.Â  Juries do not require the assistance of human\r\n  â€œtruth detectorsâ€ in assessing the credibility of testimony.\r\nI cannot agree with\r\n  the majority that qualifying Herod as an expert was harmless.Â  As in many CSC\r\n  cases, this case turned primarily on the veracity of the victim.Â  In the\r\n  instant case, while physical evidence indicated that the victim had been\r\n  abused, no physical evidence other than the testimony of the victim connected\r\n  Petitioner to the crime.Â  Notwithstanding that expert testimony is to be\r\n  assessed utilizing the same tests of credibility applied to that of non-expert\r\n  witnesses, qualification as an expert clothes the witness with an air of\r\n  authority that does not attach to â€œordinaryâ€ witnesses.Â  In his closing\r\n  argument, counsel for the State noted â€œwhat this comes down to is believability\r\n  and credibilityâ€ and contrasted his â€œexpertâ€ witnesses with witnesses presented\r\n  by the defense.[3]Â \r\n  Given the importance of credibility in this case, Herodâ€™s testimony in this\r\n  regard was not harmless. See State v. Ellis, 345 S.C. 175, 178,\r\n  547 S.E.2d 490, 492 (2001) (â€œAn officerâ€™s improper opinion which goes to the\r\n  heart of the case is not harmless.â€). \r\nFor\r\nthe reasons given above, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Herod testified R-A-T-A-C was an acronym for Rapport;\r\nAnatomy; Touch; Abuse Scenario; Closure.Â  \r\n[2] Â We are not unmindful that numerous states in\r\n  recent years have upheld the qualification of expert witnesses in the field of\r\n  forensic interviewing.Â  See, e.g., Kilby v. Commonwealth, 663\r\n  S.E.2d 540 (Va. 2008); Golden v. State, 984 So.2d 1026 (Miss. App.\r\n  2008); Lattimer v. State, 2006 WL 1073190 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert.\r\n    denied 951 So.2d 563 (Miss. 2007); Mooneyham v. Mississippi, 915 So.\r\n  2d 1102 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005); State v. Speers, 98 P.3d 560, 566\r\n  (Ariz.Ct.App.2004); In re A.H., 578 S.E.2d 247 (Ga. Ct. App. 2003); State\r\n    v. Thompson, 799 A.2d 1126 (Conn. App. 2002); Siharath v. State, 246\r\n  Ga.App. 736, 737-738, 541 S.E.2d 71 (Ga. App. 2000) (no abuse of discretion in\r\n  court qualifying witness as an expert in forensic evaluation); Louisiana v.\r\n    Hilton, 764 So. 2d 1027 (La. Ct. App. 2000).Â  Under Rule 702, SCRE, â€œ[i]f\r\n  scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of\r\n  fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness\r\n  qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\r\n  may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€Â  See Baggerly\r\n    v. CSX Transport, Inc., 370 S.C. 362, 635 S.E.2d 97 (2006).Â  Although there\r\n  may be a case in which qualification of an expert in this field is proper, we\r\nfind no such necessity in the present case.Â  \r\n[3] In his closing argument, counsel for the State argued: â€œwhat this comes down to\r\n  is believability and credibility.Â  Whatâ€™s believable, the testimony of that\r\n  little girl and what she told you here in this courtroom, followed up with an\r\n  expert in interviewing and followed up with an expert in medical examination\r\n  and confirmed by her grandmother.Â  Thatâ€™s the evidence, not mom who gets on the\r\n  stand who doesnâ€™t ever say anything about this Terry guy and the fact that she\r\n  was gone to church and other places or James Wandtke, the best friend who[â€™s]\r\nhere to help my buddy out . . . .â€\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26578","title":"Ross Marine, LLC v.

Belton, 379 S.C. 132, 666 S.E.2d 264\r\n  (2008).\r\nFACTS\r\nAttorney\r\n  Query has represented David Browder since approximately 1984.Â  In 1993, Browder\r\n  went to work for appellant Ross Marine.[1]Â \r\n  Browder recommended attorney Query to Ross Marine, and over the next seven\r\n  years Query and attorney Gliserman represented Ross Marine in several legal\r\n  matters.Â  Browder, who was employed by Ross Marine as managing sales representative,\r\n  was the primary contact between Ross Marine and the attorneys regarding these\r\n  legal matters: most of the suits were collection actions brought by Ross\r\n  Marine, although Query defended Ross Marine in a negligence action, and brought\r\n  a products liability suit on its behalf.\r\n\\In\r\n  September 2000 Ross Marine terminated Browderâ€™s employment.Â  Attorneys Query\r\n  and Gliserman formed an LLC (Firm) with attorney Sautter in 2002, and the Firm\r\n  undertook to represent Browder in a Workerâ€™s Compensation proceeding.[2]Â \r\n  In August 2003, Browder, represented by the Firm, filed an employment suit\r\n  against Ross Marine (the Browder case).Â  The merits of Browder were sent to arbitration.[3]Â  \r\nRoss\r\n  Marine sought to stay the Browder arbitration pending resolution of its\r\n  request for an injunction preventing the Firm from representing Browder\r\n  because, Ross Marine claimed, the Firm had a disqualifying conflict of\r\n  interest.Â  In the Browder case, the circuit court issued an order\r\n  denying Ross Marineâ€™s request to enjoin the Firm from representing Browder,\r\n  holding, among other things, that:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1)\r\n    Ross Marine has failed to offer\r\n  any proof that the [Firm]&hellip;represented Ross Marine in matters related to Mr.\r\n  Browder&rsquo;s termination or other claims detailed in the Browder complaint;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2)\r\n    Ross Marine has failed to offer\r\n  any proof that any of the attorneys of the firm will be called on to use any\r\n  information acquired in the previous representation to the detriment of Ross\r\n  Marine, or that the attorneys ever acquired any information in the previous\r\n  representation that could be used adversely to the interests of Ross Marine or\r\n  any of the other defendants or for the benefit of Browder in the instant case;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3)\r\n     I find that Ross Marine has failed\r\n  to establish that they will suffer irreparable harm if the case moves forward\r\n  and the [Firm] continues to represent plaintiff David Browder.&nbsp; By review of\r\n  the entire record, I note that Ross Marine has had the ample time of\r\n  approximately a year from the filing of this case to the present to fully\r\n  develop their conflict position and submit the same for the Court&rsquo;s review and\r\n  consideration,&nbsp; I find that Ross Marine has failed to establish a likelihood of\r\n  success on the merits of their conflict allegations;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4)\r\n     I find the defendants have failed\r\n  to offer any proof that attorney Query is likely to be a material witness in\r\n  the instant case;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    5)\r\n     I conclude that the [Firm] and\r\n  their members did not breach or violate Rule 407, SCACR, Rules 1.7 and 1.9 of\r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nRoss\r\n  Marine appealed this order to the Court of Appeals.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals heard the Browder appeal in November 2005 and affirmed the\r\n  circuit court order in an unpublished opinion filed in December 2005.Â  Browder\r\n    v. Ross Marine, Op. No. 2005-UP-613 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 8,\r\n  2005).Â  This Court denied certiorari in March 2007.\r\nWhile the Browder case was pending in circuit court, four of the six Browder defendants\r\n  filed this suit against the Firm, styling it as a request for injunctive and\r\n  declaratory relief as well as for negligence,[4] seeking: a stay of the Browder arbitration;[5] an injunction disqualifying the Firm from representing Browder in the Browder case; a declaration that there is a disqualifying conflict; damages; and\r\n  attorneys fees.Â  The circuit court dismissed the suit both on the merits, i.e.\r\n  that there is no conflict of interest, and because the same issue was pending\r\n  in the Browder case,[6] denied any further discovery, and awarded the Firm costs.Â  On reconsideration,\r\n  the special circuit judge reiterated that he was dismissing both the\r\n  declaratory judgment action and the negligence action for a failure of proof,\r\n  but deleted the requirement that Ross Marine pay costs.[7]Â \r\n  Ross Marine then appealed.\r\nThis appeal was\r\n  filed after the Court of Appeals had decided the Browder appeal, but\r\n  while certiorari was pending in this Court.Â  The Court of Appeals held the\r\n  present appeal in abeyance pending this Courtâ€™s disposition of the Browder certiorari request.Â  After certiorari was denied, the Court of Appeals issued\r\n  an order permitting the disposition of the Browder appeal and certiorari\r\n  to be briefed in this appeal, which was subsequently transferred to this Court.\r\nISSUE/ANALYSIS\r\nThe issue in this\r\n  suit is whether the Firm has a disqualifying conflict of interest, which is the\r\n  same question litigated in the Browder appeal.Â  As the Browder appeal has been concluded, we affirm the dismissal of this suit on the basis of\r\n  collateral estoppel.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (court can affirm on any\r\n  ground appearing in the record).Â  â€œWhen an issue has been actually litigated\r\n  and determined by a valid and final judgment, the determination is conclusive\r\n  in a subsequent action whether on the same or a different claim.â€Â  Zurcher\r\n    v. Bilton, supra.Â  Here, the claims are identical: that the Firm has\r\n  a conflict of interest such that it cannot represent Browder in his employment\r\n  suit against Ross Marine.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  collateral estoppel should not be invoked unless the party was afforded a full\r\n  and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first case.Â  Zurcher, supra.Â \r\n  In the Browder order, the circuit court judge held that â€œRoss Marine has\r\n  had the ample time of approximately a year from the filing of this case until\r\n  the present to fully develop their conflict positionâ€¦.â€Â  On appeal, appellants\r\n  did not challenge that finding, and it is too late to allege now that they were\r\n  not afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the conflict claim in the Browder case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe issue\r\n  raised here and in Browder is identical, and Ross Marine had a full and\r\n  fair opportunity to litigate it in Browder.Â  Accordingly, collateral\r\n  estoppel bars this suit.Â  Zurcher v. Bilton, supra.Â  The circuit\r\n  court order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We will refer to the appellants collectively as Ross Marine.\r\n[2] The filing of the workers compensation claim preceded the formation of the LLC.\r\n[3] It appears that the arbitration has not yet taken place.\r\n[4] The negligence claim is predicated on the Firmâ€™s alleged breach of its duty to\r\n  Ross Marine not to engage in representation where there is a conflict of\r\ninterest.\r\n[5] Note that Browder is not a party to the Ross Marine suit.\r\n[6] Browder was on appeal when the Ross Marine order was filed.\r\n[7] In light of the language used in the order on rehearing, the ruling below is\r\n  best viewed as one granting summary judgment since the special circuit judge\r\n  considered matters outside the pleadings in holding there was no evidence of\r\nany conflict.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26579","title":"South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company v.

Milling, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26579\r\n  Heard November 19, 2008 - Filed January\r\n12, 2009 \r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        John\r\n          Dwight Hudson, of Hudson Law Office, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\n        Dirk\r\n          Julius Derrick, of Conway, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE MOORE:Â  Appellant\r\n  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Appellant) filed this\r\n  declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that its policy did not cover\r\n  the damage to Howard and Cherie Durhamâ€™s (Respondents) swimming pool when it\r\n  â€œfloatedâ€ after Respondents drained the pool.Â  The parties agreed to submit the\r\n  case to the circuit court which found that the policy covered the damage to the\r\n  pool.Â  We find that the policy exclusions apply and so reverse the order of the\r\n  circuit court.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nRespondentsâ€™\r\n  home and in-ground pool are located in Horry County and were covered by a\r\n  homeownerâ€™s policy of insurance issued by Appellant.Â  At one point, Respondents\r\n  drained the water from their pool to empty it in order to clean the pool.Â \r\n  Before the pool was fully emptied, the area experienced rainfall over a\r\n  four-day period.Â  The pool was then fully emptied and, within two to three days\r\n  of being fully emptied, the pool â€œfloatedâ€ out of its foundation and rose from\r\n  the ground, causing damage to the pool and deck.\r\nRespondentsâ€™\r\n  expert explained that pressure from underground water, the presence and depth\r\n  of which varies from place to place, will result in a pool â€œfloatingâ€ if the\r\n  pool is drained.Â  â€œFloatingâ€ can be avoided by unscrewing a plug in the drain\r\n  system, which allows the ground water that is higher than the base of the pool\r\n  to enter and relieve pressure upon the pool.\r\nRespondentsâ€™\r\n  filed a claim under their homeownerâ€™s policy.Â  Both parties agreed that the policy\r\n  applied to the swimming pool, but Appellant denied coverage based on two\r\n  sections of the policy.Â  The relevant language is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Section\r\n    I - Perils Insured Against\r\n  Coverage\r\n    A - Dwelling and \r\n  Coverage\r\n    B - Other Structures\r\n  We\r\n    insure against risks of direct physical loss to property described in Coverages\r\n    A and B.Â  However, we do not insure loss:\r\n  . . .\r\n  2.\r\n    caused by:\r\n  . . .\r\n  b.\r\n    freezing, thawing, pressure or weight of water, ice, hail, snow or sleet,\r\n    whether driven by wind or not, to a:\r\n  (1)\r\n    fence, pavement, deck, patio, or swimming pool.\r\n  . . .\r\n  e. these\r\n    below:\r\n  . . .\r\n  (6)\r\n    settling, cracking, shrinking, bulging or expansion of driveways, pavements,\r\n    patios, foundations, walls, floors, roofs or ceilings.\r\n  . . . \r\n  Section\r\n    I - Exclusions\r\n  We do\r\n    not insure for loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.Â \r\n    Such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing\r\n    concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.\r\n  3. Water\r\n    Damage, meaning:\r\n  . . . \r\n  c. water\r\n    below the surface of the ground, including water which exerts pressure on or\r\n    seeps or leaks through a building, sidewalk, driveway, foundation, swimming\r\n    pool or other structure.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  parties agreed to stipulations on facts and evidence and submitted the case to\r\n  the circuit court for decision.Â  The court found in favor of Respondents and\r\n  awarded policy limits.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUE\r\nIs the damage to\r\nRespondentsâ€™ pool and deck subject to an exclusion in the insurance policy?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis\r\n  case raises a novel question of law in South Carolina.Â  In such a case, the\r\n  appellate court is free to decide the question with no particular deference to\r\n  the lower court. Iâ€™On, LLC v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411,\r\n  526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 5; S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  primary point of contention in this case is what â€œcausedâ€ Respondentsâ€™ pool to\r\n  â€œfloat.â€Â  Appellant contends that the pool â€œfloatedâ€ because of the presence of\r\n  underground water pressure in conjunction with Respondents draining the pool\r\n  without pulling the plug.Â  In Appellantâ€™s view, if the water pressure was a\r\n  factor of any kind in causing the loss, even an indirect or remote one, the language\r\n  of the policy excludes the loss.\r\nA. The circuit court\r\n  improperly defined the term â€œcause.â€\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found that the cause of the pool â€œfloatingâ€ was the Respondents\r\n  removing all of the water without removing the plug.Â  The court noted that the\r\n  word â€œcauseâ€ is not defined in the Policy and cited State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty\r\n    Co. v. Barrett, 340 S.C. 1, 530 S.E.2d 132 (Ct. App. 2000), for the\r\n  proposition that â€œ[w]here a term is not defined in an insurance policy, it is\r\n  to be defined according to the usual understanding of the termâ€™s significance\r\n  to the ordinary person.â€ Id. at 8, 530 S.E.2d at 136.Â  The circuit court\r\n  then continued, â€œ[t]he meaning of the pivotal word â€˜causeâ€™ has primarily\r\n  developed in the conte[x]t of tort and insurance law where causation is an\r\n  essential element in establishing liabilityâ€ and applied tests utilized in\r\n  determining legal causation.Â  Citing the reasoning of Bebber v. CAN\r\n    Insurance Companies, 189 Misc.2d 42, 729 N.Y.S.2d 844 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2001), the court found that the draining was a â€œbut forâ€ cause of the â€œfloatingâ€ and\r\n  that the underground water pressure was a natural, static force which could not\r\n  be an intervening cause.Â  The court also concluded that the rainfall prior to\r\n  the pool â€œfloatingâ€ was not a factor, since the parties stipulated that the\r\n  hydrostatic pressure was present both before and after the pool was emptied.\r\nAmong other points,\r\n  Appellant complains that the circuit court incorrectly defined the term â€œcauseâ€\r\n  in construing the policy.Â  We agree.Â  The circuit court correctly noted that\r\n  the term â€œcauseâ€ is not defined by the policy and that in such case the court\r\n  must define the term according to the usual understanding of the termâ€™s\r\n  significance to the ordinary person.Â  However, rather than attempting to\r\n  ascertain the understanding to the ordinary person, the court looked instead to\r\n  tort law and tests â€œutilized in determining legal causation.â€\r\nâ€œCauseâ€\r\n  in the context of an insurance policy and in the usual understanding of the\r\n  termâ€™s significance to the ordinary person is not the same as legal causation. See 7 Couch on Insurance 3d Â§ 101:40 (Steven Plitt, et al., eds., 2008).Â \r\n  The circuit court noted that â€œ[a] circumstance which merely â€˜sets the stateâ€™ is\r\n  not regarded as being a proximate cause merely because the circumstance made\r\n  possibl[e] the subsequent loss.â€ (citing Couch on Insurance, 2nd,\r\n  sec. 74.713; Bebber, supra).Â  Yet the usual understanding of the\r\n  word â€œcauseâ€ does not require that an event or condition be the proximate\r\n  cause.Â  The American Heritage Dictionary defines â€œcauseâ€ as â€œ[s]omething\r\n  that produces an effect, result, or consequenceâ€ and â€œ[t]he person, event, or\r\n  condition responsible for an action or result.â€Â  In applying this definition of\r\n  â€œcauseâ€ the â€œbut forâ€ test is appropriate.Â  While it is true, as the Bebber court noted, that â€œbut forâ€ the plaintiffâ€™s drainage of the pool the damage\r\n  would not have occurred, it is also true that â€œbut forâ€ the underground water\r\n  pressure, the damage would not have occurred.Â  Therefore, the underground water\r\n  pressure was a â€œcauseâ€ of the damage.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  the pressure was certainly not the sole cause of the â€œfloating.â€Â  Case law from\r\n  other jurisdictions demonstrates two main tests for determining coverage where\r\n  the loss is the result of multiple causes.Â  The majority of jurisdictions\r\n  follow the efficient proximate cause doctrine which provides that in\r\n  circumstances with two or more identifiable causes, the court looks to the\r\n  cause which is determined to have set the chain of events in motion. See Amherst Country Club, Inc. v. Harleysville Worcester Ins. Co., 561\r\n  F.Supp.2d 138, 150 (D.N.H. 2008).Â  If this â€œefficient proximate causeâ€ is\r\n  covered under the terms of the policy, then the loss is covered. Id.Â  The minority rule is the concurrent cause rule, which asks whether one of the\r\n  causes of a loss is covered. Id.Â  If so, then the loss is covered\r\n  notwithstanding the fact that there is also an excluded cause in the chain of\r\n  causation. Id.Â  In the instant case, neither doctrine applies since the\r\n  policy contains an anti-concurrent causation clause.Â  The exclusion provides\r\n  that â€œ[s]uch loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event\r\n  contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.â€Â  Consequently,\r\n  though the underground water pressure was not the sole cause of the loss or\r\n  even the efficient proximate cause, it was a cause of the loss and so, the\r\n  exclusion applies.\r\nB. Exclusion applies to loss resulting from a\r\n  condition existing at the time at which the policy was made. \r\nIn\r\n  finding coverage, the circuit court found that the exclusion regarding water\r\n  damage did not contemplate Respondentsâ€™ situation, since the definitions of\r\n  water damage describe events or conditions not existing at the time the policy\r\n  was written, such as floods, waves, etc.Â  We find that the language of the\r\n  water damage exclusion does not support the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation.\r\nThe\r\n  water damage provision excludes coverage for loss caused by â€œwater below the\r\n  surface of the ground, including water which exerts pressure on or seeps or\r\n  leaks through a . . . swimming pool or other structure.â€Â  Nothing in the\r\n  language excludes an existing condition as a cause.Â  Moreover, the use of the\r\n  word â€œexertsâ€ in the present tense suggests that an existing condition is\r\n  contemplated by the exclusion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nUnderground\r\n  water pressure was at least one cause of the damage to Respondentsâ€™ pool.Â \r\n  Under the exclusions and anti-concurrent causation clause of the policy, the\r\n  loss is excluded from coverage.Â  We therefore reverse the order of the circuit\r\ncourt. \r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26580","title":"State v.

Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160 (1970),\r\n  to CSCM in the first degree.Â  Solicitor stated that if Appellant did not accept\r\n  the plea deal, then he would proceed to call the cases to trial separately in\r\n  order to subject Appellant to sentence enhancements and punishment of life\r\n  without the possibility of parole under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45.[1]Â  \r\nAppellant\r\n  pled guilty to the charges of CSCM in the second degree and entered an Alford plea to CSCM in the first degree.Â  The judge explained to Appellant that by\r\n  pleading to the crimes, he faced a possible sentence of between zero and 70\r\n  years in prison and that he must serve at least 85 percent of the sentence.Â  \r\nThe plea judge then found that Appellantâ€™s decisions\r\n  to plead guilty to the charges of CSCM in the second degree were knowingly,\r\n  voluntarily, and intelligently made, and accepted both pleas.Â  The judge then\r\n  began to address Appellantâ€™s Alford plea, at which point Appellantâ€™s\r\n  counsel (Counsel) interjected and, after lengthy discussion, moved to withdraw\r\n  the Alford plea.Â  Counsel explained her position to the court:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Counsel:\r\n    Judge, [the motion for withdrawal] is\r\n  based on the fact that if I had ever been presented with an option to separate\r\n  [the charges] in any way, I would have always believed we should have gone to\r\n  trial on [the charge of CSCM in the first degree] and have entered guilty pleas\r\n  to the two C.S.C. seconds.&nbsp; I have not only not been given that option; I have\r\n  been told repeatedly I do not have that option.&nbsp; He either pleads two guilties\r\n  and one Alford or the solicitor is going to proceed in a different\r\n  manner on the two firsts.&nbsp; I understand we&rsquo;re in front of the court now and we\r\n  may be in a different posture, but that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re standing in front of you\r\n  like this because I was told that was not an option and that if I wanted . . . \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    The Court:\r\n    The options that you were given were what\r\n  to present to me.&nbsp; Nobody controls my options as to what plea I accept or don&rsquo;t\r\n  accept.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Counsel:&nbsp;\r\n    No, judge, but the option I was given is\r\n  that he could plead on the first one and then under the new law [the State] was\r\n  going to serve him with life without parole notice and he had a slam-dunk case\r\n  on that other one.&nbsp; The girl is pregnant, no question about it, and he would -\r\n  - he would get life without parole.&nbsp; That was essentially what was presented to\r\n  me, and there was no variation from that other than us enter these pleas as we\r\n  are in the process of trying to do today.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    . . . \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    The Court:&nbsp;\r\n    And so you advised your client that those\r\n  were the potential consequences if he didn&rsquo;t plead to all of them as a package.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Counsel:\r\n    Yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    The Court:\r\n    And so when he made the decision to plead\r\n  guilty [sic] to the charge against - - involving [the charge of CSCM in the\r\n  first degree] and up until the point where . . . the solicitor was no longer\r\n  able to call . . . the July to September charge [of CSCM in the second degree]\r\n  as the second charge, up until that point it was his intention and his desire\r\n  to plead guilty [sic] to the charge involving [CSCM in the first degree].&nbsp;\r\n  Correct?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Counsel:&nbsp;\r\n     Yes, sir, based - - yes, sir.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe plea judge offered to refuse to accept all three\r\n  pleas, but Counsel declined.Â  Ultimately, the judge refused to allow Counsel to\r\nwithdraw only the Alford plea and instead accepted the plea.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the plea judge err in denying Appellantâ€™s motion to withdraw his Alford plea?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe withdrawal of a guilty plea is generally within\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Riddle, 278 S.C. 148,\r\n  150, 292 S.E.2d 795, 796 (1982).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial\r\n  courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of\r\n  law. State v. Lopez, 352 S.C. 373, 378, 574 S.E.2d 210, 212 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant bears the burden on appeal of showing an\r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Appellant has made no such showing and so, we affirm.\r\nSolicitor offered Appellant the chance to enter an Alford plea to the charge of CSCM in the first degree as part of a package deal.Â  Upon\r\n  Counselâ€™s interjection, the plea judge advised that he would not allow\r\n  withdrawal of only the Alford plea, but rather would allow same in\r\n  conjunction with withdrawal of all three pleas, so as to retain the integrity\r\n  of the package. Â Counsel declined, and admitted that if Solicitor had the power\r\n  to call all three cases, then Appellant intended to follow through with his Alford plea.Â  The plea judge did not abuse his discretion in retaining the package\r\n  deal by refusing to allow withdrawal of only the Alford plea.[2]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe plea judge did not abuse his discretion in\r\n  refusing to allow withdrawal of the Alford plea alone.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  affirm.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, J., concurs. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in a\r\nseparate opinion in which TOAL, C.J. and BEATTY, J., concur.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â \r\n  I concur in result.Â  Prior to formal acceptance of the Alford plea, the\r\n  plea judge formally accepted Appellantâ€™s guilty plea to two counts of criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree.Â  Appellant sought to withdraw\r\n  the Alford plea prior to formal acceptance of that plea.Â  I write\r\n  separately because, in my judgment, in a typical guilty plea a defendant has a\r\n  right to withdraw a guilty plea prior to formal acceptance by the plea judge.Â  Harden\r\n    v. State, 453 So.2d 550, 550-51 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984) (â€œUntil formal\r\n  acceptance has occurred, the plea binds no one: not the defendant, the\r\n  prosecutor, or the court . . . . Â [F]ormal acceptance of a plea occurs when the\r\n  trial court affirmatively states to the parties, in open court and for the\r\n  record, that the court accepts the plea.â€) (internal citations omitted); State\r\n    v. Creamer, 161 S.W.3d 420, 425 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005) (â€œUp until acceptance\r\n  of the guilty plea by the trial court, a defendant has unfettered latitude to\r\n  withdraw his plea.â€); see also Fed.\r\n  R. Crim. P. 11(d)(1) (â€œA defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo\r\n  contendere . . . before the court accepts the plea, for any reason or no reason\r\n  . . . .â€).Â  Withdrawal of a guilty plea prior to formal acceptance is,\r\n  therefore, generally a matter of right and not a matter within the plea judgeâ€™s\r\n  discretion.Â  This case, however, does not present the typical situation.Â  In\r\n  light of the package deal associated with all charges and the plea judgeâ€™s\r\n  offer for Appellant to withdraw all pleas, I agree with the result reached by\r\n  the majority.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section 17-25-45 provides that upon a conviction for a â€œmost serious offenseâ€ a\r\n  person must be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole\r\n  if the person has a prior conviction for a â€œmost serious offense.â€Â  Section\r\n  17-25-45(C) provides that both CSCM in the first and second degree are â€œmost\r\n  seriousâ€ offenses.Â  Both Solicitor and Appellantâ€™s counsel believed that\r\n  Appellant could have received a sentence for life without parole under Â§\r\n  17-25-45 if convicted separately on the three charges of CSCM.Â  We express no\r\n  opinion as to the application of the statute to Appellantâ€™s situation as that\r\n  matter is not before us.\r\n[2] Appellant also seems to argue that he did not\r\n  understand the consequences of the plea since Counsel and Solicitor stated that\r\n  he faced life without parole (LWOP) if he did not accept the Stateâ€™s\r\n  â€œall-or-nothingâ€ deal.Â  Appellant contends that he was, in fact, not eligible\r\n  for LWOP under then-existing law and therefore, the judge abused his discretion\r\n  in refusing to allow Appellant to withdraw the plea.Â  This argument is not\r\n  properly preserved since it was not presented at Appellantâ€™s plea hearing. See State v. McKinney, 278 S.C. 107, 108, 292 S.E.2d 598, 599 (1982)\r\n  (failure to assert before trial court that plea was not knowing and intelligent\r\n  precludes consideration of the issue on appeal).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26582","title":"State v.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: Â Â Â Â  This is a mandatory appeal from a sentence of death.Â  On March 16,\r\n  2002, Army recruiter Sergeant First Class Tracy Davis was gunned down outside\r\n  his apartment in Lexington County, South Carolina.Â  Kevin Mercer (Mercer) was\r\n  convicted of murder, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm in the commission\r\n  of a violent crime, and sentenced to death.Â  In his appeal, Mercer challenges:\r\n  (1) the disqualification of a juror; (2) the exclusion of evidence, both in the\r\n  guilt and sentencing phases; (3) the denial of his post-trial motion for\r\n  additional funds to test gloves for gunshot residue; and (4) the denial of his\r\n  post-trial motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence.Â  We\r\n  affirm.Â  \r\nI.\r\nPrior\r\n  to his death, Sergeant First Class Tracy Davis (Davis) lived near Columbia, South Carolina, where he served as an active-duty member of the United States\r\n  Army.Â  He was attached to Fort Jackson where he trained Army recruiters. \r\nOn\r\n  the evening of March 16, 2002, Davis arrived home at approximately 11:30 P.M. to\r\n  the Raintree Apartments.Â  As was his custom, he backed his vehicle, a white\r\n  Lincoln Navigator, into a parking spot outside his apartment.Â  According to a\r\n  witness, after exiting his truck, Davis encountered a man and words were\r\n  apparently exchanged. \r\nThe\r\n  witness to the encounter was Davisâ€™s roommate, Sergeant First Class Clifton\r\n  Magwood (Magwood).Â  Magwood witnessed the confrontation from an apartment\r\n  window. Â Magwoodâ€™s room is on the second floor of the apartment, and his window\r\n  looks out over the parking lot.Â  Magwood testified that he heard a disturbance,\r\n  got out of bed, looked through his blinds and observed Davis with a heavyset\r\n  man, apparently armed with a handgun, demanding the keys to Davisâ€™s vehicle.Â \r\n  Magwood saw the robber forcing Davis toward the rear of the vehicle and heard Davis tell the armed man, â€œAll right.Â  Iâ€™ll give it to you.â€\r\nMagwood\r\n  left his vantage point to call 911 and summon help.Â  The 911 call was logged at\r\n  11:32 P.M. Shortly thereafter, while running downstairs to help his roommate,\r\n  Magwood heard a gunshot; he hurried outside to find Davis lying in the bushes\r\n  near the parking lot.Â  Magwood saw Davisâ€™s Navigator leaving the apartment\r\n  complex.Â  Davis died as a result of a gunshot to the back of the head.\r\nMagwood\r\n  only saw one individual confront Davis with a gun. Although Magwood only saw\r\n  the individual from the back, he provided an immediate and detailed description\r\n  of the assailant to law enforcement.Â  The suspect was described as â€œa black maleâ€;\r\n  â€œbroad shouldersâ€; â€œheavy build, muscularâ€; anywhere from 5â€™11â€™â€™ to 6â€™2â€ and\r\n  weighing â€œ215 to 225.â€Â  Magwood further described the suspectâ€™s clothing as â€œa\r\n  dark outfit, could be jean or denim or some type of dark outfit with a dark\r\n  hat.â€ \r\nMagwoodâ€™s\r\n  detailed description of the killer, along with a description of the Navigator,\r\n  was dispatched to all officers in the vicinity, by way of a â€œbe on the\r\n  lookout,â€ commonly referred to as a BOLO.Â  Deputy Dennis Stazer of the\r\n  Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Office responded to the BOLO broadcast by\r\n  positioning his patrol car (at 11:42 P.M.) at what he believed could be an\r\n  intercept position on a nearby interstate, I-20.Â  Within minutes, a white\r\n  Navigator drove past Deputy Stazerâ€™s location.Â  Deputy Stazer pulled in behind\r\n  the suspect vehicle and initiated a traffic stop at 11:50 P.M.Â Â  Â Â \r\nThere\r\n  were two black males in the Navigator, Mercer in the driverâ€™s seat and Marcus\r\n  Thompson in the front passengerâ€™s seat. Deputy Stazer utilized his patrol carâ€™s\r\n  â€œlight bar . . . to light up the interior of the [Navigator].â€ Â Deputy Stazer\r\n  approached the driverâ€™s side and asked the driver (Mercer) for his license and\r\n  registration.Â  Mercer produced his license, but could not find the vehicle\r\n  registration.Â  Mercer eventually located a receipt from a car dealership and\r\n  handed it to Deputy Stazer.Â  The receipt confirmed that the Navigator belonged\r\n  to the murder victim, Davis.Â  Mercer and Thompson were taken into custody.Â  \r\nInside\r\n  the Navigator, a .357 caliber handgun was retrieved from under the driverâ€™s\r\n  seat.[1]Â \r\n  Testing matched the handgun to the bullet removed from Davis during the\r\n  autopsy.Â  Gunshot residue (GSR) testing done on Mercerâ€™s hands revealed\r\n  materials considered to be consistent with GSR, although the test results were\r\n  not conclusive.Â  Testing done on Thompsonâ€™s hands resulted in a negative test\r\n  for GSR.Â  Four gloves (two pairs) were found in Thompsonâ€™s possession but were\r\n  not tested for GSR.Â  As Thompson was removed from the vehicle, a plastic bag\r\n  containing fourteen .357 bullets â€œfell out of his pants legs.â€ \r\nMercer\r\n  matched the detailed description of the assailant furnished by Magwood.Â  Mercer\r\n  is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 220 pounds.[2] The officers on the scene of the arrest confirmed that Mercer is a broad-shouldered,\r\n  muscular individual, consistent with Magwoodâ€™s description.Â  Mercer was\r\n  arrested wearing a â€œdark[,] . . . like a denim . . . jean jacket outfitâ€; he\r\n  was also wearing â€œa black . . . baseball style cap.â€\r\nConversely,\r\n  Thompson is â€œvery slenderâ€ and â€œnarrow-shoulderedâ€ and weighs about 150 pounds.\r\n  Â At the time of his arrest, Thompson was wearing â€œa black tee shirt that was\r\n  over a white tee shirt,â€ with the white tee shirt conspicuously sticking out\r\n  from the black tee shirt.Â  Thompson was not wearing a hat.\r\nMercer\r\n  and Thompson were charged with murder, armed robbery, possession of a firearm during\r\n  the commission of a violent crime, and criminal conspiracy.Â  Based on the\r\n  Stateâ€™s view of the evidence, Thompson pled guilty to accessory before the fact\r\n  of armed robbery, and accessory after the fact of murder, and armed robbery; he\r\n  was sentenced to 28 years in prison.Â  Mercerâ€™s charges proceeded to trial with\r\n  the State seeking the death penalty. Â Mercer\r\n  pursued a third-party guilt defense, pointing to Thompson as the shooter.Â  The jury convicted Mercer, with the jury ultimately\r\n  recommending a sentence of death, from which Mercer appeals.\r\nII.\r\nMercer raises six issues on\r\n  appeal, which we place in four categories:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1)\r\n    Whether the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion in finding a juror not death penalty qualified under Wainwright\r\n    v. Witt.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (2)\r\n    Whether the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion during the guilt phase by excluding the testimony of Thompson&rsquo;s\r\n  attorney &ldquo;that Thompson was charged as only an accessory after the fact and\r\n  that he was released on bond.&rdquo;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (3)&nbsp;\r\n    Whether the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion during the penalty phase by (a) precluding Dr. John Steedman from\r\n  opining that a &ldquo;SPECT Scan&rdquo; of Mercer&rsquo;s brain revealed an &ldquo;abnormality&rdquo;; and\r\n  (b) precluding Dr. Steedman from offering expert psychiatric opinion testimony.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (4)\r\n    Whether the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion in denying Mercer&rsquo;s post-trial motions, one seeking additional funds\r\n  to test Thompson&rsquo;s gloves for gunshot residue; and a second motion for a new\r\n  trial based on after-discovered evidence that Thompson confessed to a cellmate that\r\nhe committed the murder.\r\n  \r\n\r\nIII.\r\nJuror John Doe[3] and Wainwright v. Witt\r\nMercer\r\n  claims the disqualification of Juror John Doe violated his Sixth and Fourteenth\r\n  Amendment rights.Â  We disagree.Â  In Wainwright\r\n    v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985), the Supreme\r\n  Court stated that the critical issue regarding the disqualification of a\r\n  capital juror is â€œwhether the jurorâ€™s views would â€˜prevent or substantially\r\n  impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\r\n  instructions and his oath.â€™â€Â  Id. at 424 (quoting Adams v. Texas,\r\n  448 U.S. 38, 45 (1980)).Â  The Wainwright Court observed that a jurorâ€™s\r\n  bias need not be â€œproved with â€˜unmistakable clarityâ€™ . . . [because] bias\r\n  cannot be reduced to question-and-answer sessions which obtain results in the\r\n  manner of a catechism.â€Â  Id. at 424.Â  Finally, the Wainwright Court noted that â€œthere will be situations where the trial judge is left with\r\n  the definite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully\r\n  and impartially apply the law . . . [and that] is why deference must be paid to\r\n  the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.â€Â  Id. at 425-26.Â  It is\r\n  with this standard in mind that we address whether the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion in disqualifying Juror John Doe.\r\nWe have carefully reviewed the\r\n  lengthy colloquy involving Juror Doe.Â  While it is possible to cherry-pick certain\r\n  responses and perhaps conclude that Juror Doe is qualified, a review of the\r\n  totality of the responses reveals a potential juror vacillating and struggling\r\n  with his strong convictions against the death penalty.Â  Juror Doe, without\r\n  hesitation, expressed an ability to impose a life sentence.Â  Conversely, when\r\n  the trial court asked if the juror could vote for a sentence of death, Juror\r\nDoe responded, â€œIâ€™m not sure, sir.â€Â  \r\nThe State followed the courtâ€™s\r\n  questioning by pursuing the same line of inquiry, to which Juror Doe responded\r\n  that â€œitâ€™s just hard to judge, you know, someone else . . . for something that\r\n  theyâ€™ve done.â€Â  Following up, the State zeroed in on Juror Doeâ€™s reservations,\r\n  asking whether Juror Doe could sign his name to a death penalty verdict, to\r\nwhich Doe responded, â€œI donâ€™t think so, sir.â€Â  \r\nDefense counsel attempted to\r\n  rehabilitate Juror Doe, but without much success.Â  Doe stated he would â€œtryâ€ to\r\n  consider both options.Â  The trial court permitted both sides to vet Juror Doe\r\n  thoroughly. Doe answered, â€œprobably so,â€ when asked if his feelings would\r\n  interfere with serving on the jury. Â And when Doe was asked, â€œif you were\r\n  convinced that a death sentence was appropriate that you could sign that form\r\n  along with the other jurors,â€ he answered, â€œ[t]hat goes back to like having to\r\n  put my name on the line you said when -- for a death sentence.Â  Iâ€™d still have\r\nto think about that.â€Â  \r\nThe trial court\r\n  concluded that Juror John Doe was not qualified under Wainwright: \r\n\r\n  I think the juror is not qualified. . . . Â Thereâ€™s\r\n    several things that I think need to be mentioned, and the first is the jurorâ€™s\r\n    demeanor. . . . Â I believe that . . . this jurorâ€™s views on capital punishment\r\n    would substantially impair his ability to perform his duties as a juror in\r\n    accordance with the instructions that I would give him.\r\n  . . .Â  A lot of times I think we see jurors\r\n    who hesitate . . . [and] I feel as though I can get a sense as to whether the\r\n    juror is hesitating because they are trying to think deeply and be completely\r\n    open and honest with us or are they hesitating because they are troubled by the\r\n    . . . issue that theyâ€™re about to discuss.\r\n  I did not get the impression, as I do\r\n    sometimes, that this juror hesitated because he was trying to be clear about\r\n    his feelings.Â  I got the impression that he hesitated because he was troubled\r\n    by . . . what he thought would be the question of whether or not he would be\r\n    able to impose the death penalty. . . . Â And in the end I am left . . . with\r\n    the impression that . . . this jurorâ€™s views on the death penalty would\r\n    substantially impair his performance of his duty to . . . follow the\r\n    instructions that I would give him.Â  And so I find that he is disqualified.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the trial\r\n  court acted well within its broad discretion in finding Juror Doeâ€™s views would\r\n  substantially impair his ability to follow his oath and the courtâ€™s instructions\r\n  on the law.Â  See Uttecht v. Brown, 551 U.S. 1, 9 (2007) (â€œDeference to\r\n  the trial court is appropriate [which necessarily involves granting the trial\r\n  court broad discretion] because it is in a position to assess the demeanor of\r\n  the venire, and of the individuals who compose it, a factor of critical\r\n  importance in assessing the attitude and qualifications of potential jurors.â€); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 135, 141, 607 S.E.2d 57, 60 (2004) (adhering to\r\n  the rule that a â€œtrial courtâ€™s disqualification of a prospective juror will not\r\n  be disturbed where there is a reasonable basis . . . [to] conclude[] that the\r\n  juror would not have been able to faithfully discharge his responsibilities as\r\n  a jurorâ€); Â State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 10, 515 S.E.2d 508, 512 (1999)\r\n  (following the rule that unless unsupported by the evidence, â€œdetermination of\r\n  whether a juror is qualified to serve on a death penalty case is within the\r\n  sole discretion of the trial judgeâ€).Â  Even the cold record before us reflects\r\n  Juror Doeâ€™s hesitancy and profound unease with the prospect of performing his\r\n  duties as a juror in accordance with his oath and the courtâ€™s instructions.Â  State\r\n    v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 503, 476 S.E.2d 903, 908 (1996) (finding that the\r\n  trial court acted correctly by disqualifying a juror that â€œdeclared that she\r\n  did not think she could sign a form recommending the death penaltyâ€); State\r\n    v. Longworth, 313 S.C. 360, 366, 438 S.E.2d 219, 222 (1993) (disqualifying\r\n  a juror who initially stated â€œhe â€˜probably couldâ€™ considerâ€ the death penalty\r\n  but later stated he did not â€œthink soâ€).Â  We affirm the disqualification of\r\n  Juror John Doe.\r\nIV.\r\nExclusion of Â Marcus Thompsonâ€™s Lawyerâ€™s Testimony\r\nDuring the guilt\r\n  phase, Mercer sought to introduce testimony from Thompsonâ€™s lawyer regarding\r\n  the reduced charges against Thompson.[4]Â \r\n  Specifically, Mercer wanted to introduce testimony that he and Thompson were\r\n  initially charged with the same offenses, but later Thompsonâ€™s charges were\r\n  reduced and he was released on bond.Â  Mercer claimed the information was\r\n  relevant as part of his defense of third-party guilt.Â  The State objected to\r\n  this testimony, asserting that it was not relevant to third-party guilt or\r\n  otherwise.Â  The trial court sustained the objection. Â Finding the proffered testimony\r\n  of Thompsonâ€™s attorney concerning Thompsonâ€™s reduced charges and bail status\r\n  not relevant to any issue before the jury, including third-party guilt, we\r\n  affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.[5]\r\nV.\r\nExclusion\r\n  of Expert Mitigation Evidence\r\nMercer retained numerous\r\n  well-credentialed experts for the penalty phase, including a neurologist, a forensic\r\n  psychiatrist, a pharmacologist, a sociologist licensed as a clinical social\r\n  worker, and a corrections expert. Â During the penalty phase, the defense\r\npresented a comprehensive review of Mercerâ€™s troubled life.\r\nThe mitigation evidence\r\n  revealed much about Mercer.Â  A sampling of the evidence reveals that Mercer has\r\n  a â€œdamaging disability in terms of . . . making judgment[s] and inferencesâ€ and\r\n  that he suffers from â€œuntreated depression.â€Â  The experts opined that Mercerâ€™s\r\n  abusive upbringing resulted in post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety\r\n  disorder, which â€œare connected with previous trauma, nightmares[,] . . . distressive\r\n  recollectionsâ€ and substance abuse. Beyond Mercerâ€™s life experiences, he\r\n  suffered from a myriad of cognitive deficiencies, including neurological\r\n  dysfunction and learning disabilities.Â  Because Mercer struggled from an early\r\n  age to function in life and hold regular employment, he was found to be\r\ndisabled by the Social Security Administration. \r\nAgainst this backdrop of a\r\n  thorough mitigation presentation, we are presented with two challenges to the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s exclusion of expert testimony in the penalty phase. Â â€œA ruling on\r\n  the admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court\r\n  and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Washington, 379 S.C. 120, 123-24, 665 S.E.2d 602, 604 (2008) (internal\r\ncitations omitted).Â  \r\nWe first address the claim\r\n  that the trial court abused its discretion in preventing Dr. John Steedman from\r\n  opining that a â€œSPECT Scanâ€ of Mercerâ€™s brain revealed an â€œabnormality.â€Â  While\r\n  we agree that it was clear error to exclude this testimony, we do not find that\r\n  Mercer was prejudiced by the error.Â  Next is the assignment of error in\r\n  connection with the trial court precluding Dr. Steedman from offering\r\npsychiatric opinion testimony.Â  Again, we find no reversible error.\r\nA. â€œSpect Scanâ€Â  \r\nDr. Steedman is a medical\r\n  doctor who is board certified in neurology and psychiatry. Â Dr. Steedman\r\n  analyzed a â€œSPECT Scanâ€ conducted on Mercerâ€™s brain.[6]Â \r\n  The SPECT Scan was initially reviewed by a radiologist who noted a\r\n  â€œquestionable abnormality.â€Â  Dr. Steedman was prepared to render a stronger\r\n  finding of an abnormality.Â  The State objected strenuously against such\r\n  testimony, claiming surprise and prejudice.Â  After an offer of proof and\r\n  lengthy discussion, the trial court sustained the objection on the basis of Rule\r\n  403, SCRE, and a so-called â€œdiscovery orderâ€ violation.Â  This ruling rises to\r\nthe level of an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nApplication of Rule 403 should\r\n  be cautiously invoked against a capital defendant in the penalty phase,\r\n  especially in light of the due process implications at stake when a capital\r\n  defendant seeks to introduce mitigation evidence.[7] Â The probative value of Dr. Steedmanâ€™s excluded testimony was, as a matter of\r\n  law, not substantially outweighed by its potential for prejudice, as a result\r\n  of the purported late disclosure or otherwise.Â  Reliance on the so-called\r\n  â€œdiscovery orderâ€ cannot withstand even minimal scrutiny, for there was no\r\n  formal discovery order.[8]Â \r\n  In any event, Dr. Steedman was disclosed to the State, as was the general\r\nsubstance of his testimony.Â  \r\nWe nevertheless find no\r\n  reversible error.Â  When the entirety of the record is considered, the exclusion\r\n  of Dr. Steedmanâ€™s proffered testimony of an abnormality juxtaposed to the\r\n  radiologistâ€™s notation of a â€œquestionable abnormalityâ€ resulted in no prejudice\r\n  to Mercer.Â  Despite the erroneous ruling, a review of the record demonstrates\r\n  that Dr. Steedman testified at length concerning Mercerâ€™s cognitive deficiencies.Â \r\n  Dr. Steedmanâ€™s unchallenged testimony included reference to the SPECT Scan\r\n  results as â€œconfirmatoryâ€ of Mercerâ€™s learning disorder.Â  More to the point, the\r\n  same evidence the State successfully and erroneously challengedâ€”the SPECT Scan\r\nabnormalityâ€”was already in evidence without objection.\r\nAnother defense expert previously\r\n  testified that the SPECT Scan revealed an abnormality. Dr. Donna\r\n  Schwartz-Watts, a defense psychiatrist, testified that she â€œordered whatâ€™s\r\n  called a SPECT Scan.Â  And what a SPECT Scan is, this is one of the newer tests\r\n  in medicine and it shows brain function. . . . Â But what it does, itâ€™s a . . .\r\n  picture of how your brain functions, and that test came back abnormal.Â  Thereâ€™s\r\n  a . . . small area thatâ€™s not normal on there. . . .â€Â  Later, as Dr. Schwartz-Watts\r\n  began to sum up her testimony, she again talked about the SPECT Scan.Â \r\n  Referring to Mercer, she said that â€œitâ€™s already a bad brain in the sense that\r\n  heâ€™s got a learning disability and . . . we even know that on a SPECT Scan\r\n  thereâ€™s an abnormality.â€Â  Thus, the very â€œSPECT Scan abnormalityâ€ testimony\r\n  Mercer sought to admit through Dr. Steedman was presented to the jury without\r\n  objection through Dr. Schwartz-Watts. We therefore find the trial courtâ€™s error\r\n  in excluding Dr. Steedmanâ€™s opinion testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985)\r\n  (quoting State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 93, 180 S.E.2d 888, 890 (1971))\r\n  (noting that an error is harmless when it â€œâ€˜could not reasonably have affected\r\nthe result of the trialâ€™â€).\r\nB.Â \r\n  Exclusion of Dr. Steedmanâ€™s psychiatric opinion\r\nAs noted, Dr.\r\n  Steedman is board certified in both neurology and psychiatry.Â  When Mercer\r\n  sought to elicit brief testimony from Dr. Steedman as a psychiatrist, the State\r\n  objected, claiming Dr. Steedman was only disclosed as an expert in neurology.Â  The\r\n  basis of the Stateâ€™s objection arose from the nonexistent discovery order,\r\n  discussed above.Â  The trial court entertained the objection, and Mercer\r\n  proceeded to make an offer of proof.Â  The offer of proof of Dr. Steedmanâ€™s\r\n  psychiatric opinion comprises a mere half page in this voluminous record.Â  The\r\n  thrust of Dr. Steedmanâ€™s psychiatric opinion was that the â€œtypes of [Mercerâ€™s]\r\n  abnormalities . . . are a cumulative effect on poor judgment, depression,\r\n  anxiety, thought disorders, [and] paranoia.â€ Â The Stateâ€™s objection was\r\n  sustained, and Dr. Steedman was prevented from rendering a psychiatric\r\n  opinion.Â  \r\nAlthough the basis of the\r\n  Stateâ€™s objection was specious, no reversible error is present.Â  The excluded\r\n  evidence was presented to the jury through other witnesses, especially Dr.\r\n  Schwartz-Watts, without objection.Â  Even defense counsel acknowledged that the\r\n  proffered psychiatric opinion testimony of Dr. Steedman â€œcertainly . . . mirrors\r\n  [and] dove-tail[s]â€ with Dr. Schwartz-Watts. As a result, Mercer sustained no\r\n  prejudice from the exclusion of this cumulative evidence. Â State v. Graham,\r\n  314 S.C. 383, 386, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994) (noting that a harmless error\r\n  analysis depends upon a host of factors, one of which is whether the excluded\r\nevidence was cumulative).\r\nVI.\r\nDenial\r\n  of Mercerâ€™s Post-trial Motions \r\nWe finally address Mercerâ€™s\r\n  two post-trial motions.Â  These motions cannot be properly understood and\r\n  evaluated in a vacuum, for they naturally flow from Mercerâ€™s efforts to create\r\n  a reasonable doubt in the Stateâ€™s case by pointing to Marcus Thompson as the\r\nshooter.\r\nThe\r\n  centerpiece of Mercerâ€™s guilt phase defense was third-party guiltâ€”Thompson as\r\n  the triggerman.Â  As defense counsel asserted in the opening statement to the\r\n  jury:Â  \r\n\r\n  One of the key factors in this case was omitted [from\r\n    the solicitorâ€™s opening remarks], and that is riding in the Lincoln Navigator\r\n    was a second person.Â  Ladies and Gentlemen that second person is not here\r\n    today.Â  We donâ€™t know where he is.Â  Last time I heard he was out on bond.Â  Last\r\n    time I heard he wasnâ€™t even charged with murder or armed robbery.Â  That wasnâ€™t\r\n    how it started out.Â  He was charged with all the same things that Kevin Mercer\r\n    was.\r\n  . . . . \r\n  . . .Â  Suffice it to say Marcus Thompson was in the\r\n    Navigator and heâ€™s not here today, and we believe that Marcus Thompson, in fact,\r\n    was the shooter.Â  Thatâ€™s our theory.Â  Itâ€™s pretty simple.Â  \r\n\r\nThis theme was pursued\r\n  throughout the trial, as the defense sought to create a reasonable doubt that\r\n  Mercer was the triggerman.Â  This approach was directly linked to what Mercer\r\n  characterized as a â€œtunnel visionâ€ approach to the investigation. Â One example\r\n  comes from the gloves taken from Thompson that were not tested for gunshot residue\r\n  (GSR).Â  Counsel for Mercer argued forcefully that the Stateâ€™s decision not to\r\n  test the gloves for GSR demonstrated the Stateâ€™s myopic view to focus on Mercer\r\n  at the expense of a thorough and proper investigation.Â  The following excerpts\r\nfrom the closing argument illustrate this defense strategy:\r\n\r\n  [The State does not] want to talk about Marcus\r\n    Thompson. . . . Â You know, we had to dig and bring out the things about Marcus\r\n    Thompson.Â  They didnâ€™t want to show you any evidence about him.Â  They wanted to\r\n    ignore anything about him that would give you the full picture of what happened\r\n    on May 16, 2002. . . . Â We had to pull it out of them. \r\n  . . . . \r\n  . . .Â  But do we know that it wasnâ€™t Marcus Thompson\r\n    with gloves on that pulled that trigger in that dimly-lit parking lot? \r\n  . . . . \r\n  They didnâ€™t show you the gloves because it points\r\n    directly to Marcus Thompson being the shooter. \r\n  . . . . \r\n  . . .Â  And weâ€™d know . . . if they had sent those\r\n    gloves to the [State Law Enforcement Division] lab. Â Weâ€™d know if they were full\r\n    of barium, antimony, and lead.Â  Weâ€™d know that.Â  \r\n  . . . . \r\n  . . . Â Maybe Marcus Thompson with his gloves on shot\r\n    Sergeant Davis and then went and got Kevin [Mercer].Â  Itâ€™s up to the State to\r\n    prove it, and they havenâ€™t done it. \r\n  . . . . \r\n  They chose to declare Kevin Mercer the shooter and\r\n    ignore the other evidence, ignore the other possibilities, ignore Marcus\r\n    Thompson and his gloves.\r\n\r\nA. Denial of funding\r\npost-trial to test Thompsonâ€™s gloves\r\nMercerâ€™s\r\n  post-trial motion for funds to test Thompsonâ€™s gloves for GSR was denied.Â  The\r\n  matter of authorizing funds to capital defendants lies within the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-26(C)(1) (2003)\r\n  (authorizing the trial court to award funds where court determines requested\r\n  funds are â€œreasonably necessaryâ€); see also State v. Matthews,\r\n  291 S.C. 339, 345, 353 S.E.2d 444, 448 (1986) (holding that the decision to\r\n  award funds to capital defendants is a matter within the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  discretion).Â  Before trial, the trial court authorized $53,000 for Mercerâ€™s\r\n  defense.Â  The trial judge went further and invited defense counsel to request\r\n  additional funds â€œif what I have authorized in this order is not going to get\r\n  you all the way to trial.â€ Â The record discloses no additional funding request\r\n  prior to this post-trial motion.\r\nOf\r\n  particular significance to a proper resolution of this post-trial funding\r\n  request is the fact that Mercer retained a GSR expert for trial.Â  The expert, Jeffrey\r\n  Hollifield, is a chemist, formerly employed with the South Carolina State Law\r\n  Enforcement Division.Â  Hollifield was assigned the limited task of analyzing\r\n  the inconclusive results of the GSR test conducted on Mercer.Â  For apparent\r\n  strategic reasons, Hollifield was not tasked with testing the gloves found in\r\n  Thompsonâ€™s possession.Â  As discussed above, the defense opted to challenge the\r\n  adequacy of the Stateâ€™s investigation, pointing to the Stateâ€™s failure to test\r\n  Thompsonâ€™s gloves.Â  Having elected not to test Thompsonâ€™s gloves for trial\r\n  purposes, there is no abuse of discretion in the denial of Mercerâ€™s post-trial\r\n  motion for additional funding.\r\nB. Denial\r\n  of new trial motion based on after-discovered evidence\r\nFollowing\r\n  the trial, and while the case was initially on appeal, Solicitor Myers received\r\n  a letter from Kevin Fuller, who had been one of Thompsonâ€™s cellmates at the\r\n  Lexington County Detention Center.Â  In a second letter to Solicitor Myers,\r\n  Fuller asked for â€œhelpâ€ and â€œsome probationâ€ with his pending charges.Â  According\r\n  to Fuller, Thompson had admitted to shooting the victim.Â  Solicitor Myers\r\n  promptly forwarded Fullerâ€™s letters to defense counsel, who filed a motion for\r\n  a new trial based on after-discovered evidence.Â  Because this information came\r\n  to light after the filing of the appeal, we remanded the matter to the trial\r\n  court to conduct an evidentiary hearing.Â  The trial court heard the matter\r\n  fully and, in a detailed order, denied the new trial motion, both as to the\r\n  guilt and sentencing phases.Â  Mercer assigns error to the denial of his new\r\n  trial motion.\r\nThe\r\n  decision whether to grant a new trial rests within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court, and this Court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s decision absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Johnson, 376 S.C. 8, 11, 654 S.E.2d\r\n  835, 836 (2007); State v. Simmons, 279 S.C. 165, 166, 303 S.E.2d 857,\r\n  858 (1983).Â  Having carefully considered the new trial motion, fully cognizant\r\n  of Mercerâ€™s third-party guilt defense, we find no abuse of discretion in the\r\n  denial of his motion.\r\nIn order for Mercer to prevail\r\n  in his new trial motion premised upon after-discovered evidence, he must show\r\n  the after-discovered evidence:Â  (1) is such that it would probably change the\r\n  result if a new trial were granted; (2) has been discovered since the trial;\r\n  (3) could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered prior to\r\n  the trial; (4) is material; and (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  State\r\n    v. Spann, 334 S.C. 618, 619-20, 513 S.E.2d 98, 99 (1999). Â Â The State\r\nconcedes that all elements are met, save the first element.\r\nIn\r\n  this post-trial setting, our jurisprudence recognizes the gatekeeping role of\r\n  the trial court in making a credibility assessment.[9]Â  State v. Porter, 269 S.C. 618, 621, 239 S.E.2d 641, 643 (1977) (noting\r\n  that the determination of whether new evidence is credible for purposes of a\r\n  new trial motion rests with the trial court); State v. Deese, 266 S.C.\r\n  534, 538, 225 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1976) (noting that the trial court is tasked\r\n  with assessing the new evidence in a motion for a new trial); State v.\r\n    Pierce, 263 S.C. 23, 33, 207 S.E.2d 414, 419 (1974) (quoting State v.\r\n      Mayfield, 235 S.C. 11, 34-35, 109 S.E.2d 716, 729 (1959)) (â€œThe credibility\r\n  of newly-discovered evidence offered in support of a motion for a new trial is\r\n  a matter for determination by the circuit judge to whom it is offered.Â  In him,\r\n  not this court, resides the power to weigh such evidence; and his judgment\r\n  thereabout will not be disturbed except for error of law or abuse of\r\n  discretion.â€). Â On review, we may not make our own findings of fact.Â  The\r\n  deferential standard of review constrains us to affirm the trial court if\r\n  reasonably supported by the evidence.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  after-discovered evidence is limited to Fullerâ€™s testimony that Thompson\r\n  admitted to being the triggerman. Thompsonâ€™s participation in, and first-hand\r\n  knowledge of, the crime, was clearly known to Mercer and the State from the\r\n  beginning.Â  With the proper standard of review in mind, we review the trial\r\n  court findings.\r\nWe\r\n  begin with the trial courtâ€™s conclusion concerning Fullerâ€™s testimony:\r\n\r\n  I carefully observed Fullerâ€™s demeanor and listened to\r\n    his testimony.Â  In my view, the inconsistencies in his own stories, the\r\n    differences between his version and that of Thompson and Johnston, and the\r\n    inconsistency of Fullerâ€™s story with known facts did not result from mistake or\r\n    failure of recollection, but rather from intentional, calculated\r\n    misrepresentations.Â  I believe Fuller fabricated the story about Thompson\r\n    admitting to shooting Sergeant Davis.Â  I believe Fuller purposefully made\r\n    different statements about this at different times when Fullerâ€™s view of what\r\n    version of the story suited Fullerâ€™s interests best had changed.Â  Finally,\r\n    apart from the factors listed above, Fuller simply left me with the clear impression\r\n    he was not telling the truth.Â  Fullerâ€™s testimony has very little credibility.\r\n\r\nFullerâ€™s\r\n  criminal record includes multiple convictions for burglary, aggravated assault\r\n  and battery, and criminal domestic violence.Â  Fuller characterized his criminal\r\n  history as a â€œnice record.â€ We recognize that all the key participants in the\r\n  post-trial hearing have extensive criminal records.Â  \r\nMore\r\n  relevant to the inquiry is careful scrutiny of the actual statements Fuller\r\n  attributes to Thompson.Â  Given the inconsistencies with Fullerâ€™s story, there\r\n  is a basis to sustain the trial courtâ€™s lack of credibility finding.Â  For\r\n  example, on cross examination at the evidentiary hearing, Fuller gave varying\r\n  versions as to when Thompson confessed to the murder. Â Concerning the substance\r\n  of the various statements, when Fuller was confronted with the inconsistency\r\n  â€œabout what happened to the gun,â€ he said he â€œmiswroteâ€ the initial statement\r\n  because he â€œwas in a hurry.â€[10]Â \r\n  Another inconsistency is found in Fullerâ€™s account of where Davis was shotâ€”as Davis was exiting his vehicle (which is Fullerâ€™s account) versus outside the vehicle.\r\nFuller\r\n  informed investigators in a July 19, 2006, interview that another cellmate\r\n  could corroborate Thompsonâ€™s alleged confession. The other cellmate, Timothy\r\n  Johnston, did testify, but he denied Fullerâ€™s account of the Thompson\r\n  confession.Â  The trial court found Johnstonâ€™s testimony credible.Â  \r\nFullerâ€™s\r\n  credibility may be assessed not only by internal inconsistencies within his\r\n  statements and testimony, but also by contrasting the purported Thompson\r\n  confession against what are fairly solid facts.Â  First, the only witness to the\r\n  crime, Magwood, provided a physical description of the assailant, a description\r\n  that closely matched the much bigger Mercer and not the slender Thompson.Â \r\n  Second, Magwood saw Davis being forced, apparently at gunpoint, by the heavyset\r\n  assailant toward the rear of the Navigator; Magwood found Davis lying in the\r\n  bushes next to the parking lot.Â  This is at odds with the Fuller account of the\r\n  murder occurring in the area of the driverâ€™s door.Â  Third, Fuller testified to\r\n  a blood smear on the Navigator; the vehicle was stopped only minutes after the\r\n  murder and no blood was found in or on the vehicle.Â  Fourth, according to\r\n  Fuller, Thompson shot Davis â€œpointblank . . . behind his ear.â€ Â The pathologist\r\n  opined that, because of the absence of soot or stippling around the wound, the\r\n  fatal shot came from a distance of â€œat least two feet away from the skin of the\r\n  victim.â€ Â Fifth, according to Fuller, Thompson moved the murder weapon during\r\n  the traffic stop and placed it under Mercerâ€™s seat.Â  This is at odds with the\r\n  testimony of Deputy Stazer, who pulled the vehicle over and saw no such\r\n  movement in the vehicle. \r\nTo\r\n  be sure, Mercer may challenge the certitude of these so-called facts, but their\r\n  cumulative effect informed the judgment of the trial court in assessing the\r\n  post-trial motion based on after-discovered evidence.Â  \r\nHaving\r\n  thoughtfully considered the evidence, the trial court determined that â€œthere is\r\n  essentially no chance the jury would believe Fullerâ€™s testimony that Thompson\r\n  confessed to shooting Sergeant Davis.â€Â  This finding of course is beyond the\r\n  applicable â€œwould probably change the resultâ€ standard. Â Spann, 334 S.C.\r\n  at 619, 513 S.E.2d at 99.Â  In denying the post-trial motion as to the guilt\r\n  phase, the trial court observed that the jury was charged, without objection,\r\n  on the law of â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all.â€Â  In denying the post-trial\r\n  motion as to the sentencing phase, the trial court observed that the jury was\r\n  charged that it could recommend a death sentence only if it found that Mercer\r\n  was the triggerman.[11] \r\nMercer\r\n  takes issue with the denial of his post-trial motion.Â  Mercer posits a\r\n  different view of the facts.Â  Mercer, in essence, invites this Court to make\r\n  different credibility determinations, especially with respect to Fuller.Â  Beyond\r\n  Fuller, it is argued that the trial court had a valid reason not to believe\r\n  cellmate Johnston over Fuller, for Johnston was facing life imprisonment with a\r\n  pending burglary first-degree charge.[12]Â \r\n  We respectfully decline Mercerâ€™s invitation to engage in de novo fact\r\n  finding.Â Â  We further reject the suggestion to ignore the trial courtâ€™s gatekeeping\r\n  role in post-trial after-discovered evidence motions. \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    credibility of newly-discovered evidence offered in support of a motion for a\r\n    new trial is a matter for determination by the circuit judge to whom it is\r\n    offered.Â  In him, not this court, resides the power to weigh such evidence; and\r\n    his judgment thereabout will not be disturbed except for error of law or abuse\r\n    of discretion.\r\n\r\nMayfield, 235 S.C. at 34-35, 109 S.E.2d at 729.Â  \r\nTo\r\n  accept Mercerâ€™s premise that a jury must weigh the conflicting evidence ignores\r\n  the State v. Spann factors and the gatekeeping role of the trial court\r\n  as outlined in many cases, including State v. Mayfield.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  approach advanced by Mercer confuses the applicable standard in post-trial\r\n  after-discovered evidence motions with the admissibility of third-party guilt\r\n  evidence at trial. \r\nThe\r\n  question before us, then, is whether the trial courtâ€™s denial of the post-trial\r\n  motion amounts to an abuse of discretion.Â  We hold it does not.Â  In so ruling,\r\n  we are sensitive to the notion that a mere finding of a witnessâ€™s lack of\r\n  credibility does not complete the analysis, because a witness may lack persuasive\r\n  credibility and still create reasonable doubt.Â  This sensitivity forms part of\r\n  our consideration.Â  We have drawn the line, however, with Mercerâ€™s desire to\r\n  use Fullerâ€™s testimony for â€œresidual doubtâ€ as to guilt in the sentencing\r\n  phase. Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U.S. 164, 172-74 (1988) (clarifying Eighth\r\n  Amendment jurisprudence by noting that a state is not constitutionally required\r\n  to allow a capital defendant to submit â€œresidual doubtâ€ mitigation evidence in\r\n  the sentencing phase of a capital case).Â  We affirm the denial of Mercerâ€™s\r\n  post-trial motion based on after-discovered evidence. \r\nVII.\r\nWe\r\n  have conducted the statutorily mandated review under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25\r\n  (2003).Â  We find the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion,\r\n  prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.Â  We further find that the evidence\r\n  supports the juryâ€™s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and that\r\n  the sentence of death is proportionate to sentences imposed under similar\r\n  situations.Â  State v. Huggins, 336 S.C. 200, 519 S.E.2d 574 (1999); State\r\n    v. McWee, 322 S.C. 387, 472 S.E.2d 235 (1996).Â  Mercerâ€™s convictions and\r\nsentence of death are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n  Â Â Â Â \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Deputy Stazer did not testify to seeing a\r\n  handgun when he first approached the driverâ€™s window.Â  Moreover, Deputy Stazer,\r\n  who â€œhad to keep [his] eyes on both of them,â€ saw no movement from either\r\n  Mercer or Thompson.Â  Deputy Stazer testified that had there been any movement\r\n  in the vehicle he considered as a threat, he would have responded with deadly\r\n  force.Â  This testimony concerning the lack of movement, especially by Thompson,\r\n  acquires relevance when read in context with Mercerâ€™s post-trial motion for a\r\n  new trial based on after-discovered evidence.\r\n[2] This height and weight is taken from Mercerâ€™s\r\n  driverâ€™s license which he produced to Deputy Stazer.Â  There is nothing in the\r\n  record that contradicts this description. \r\n[3] We use the pseudonym John Doe. \r\n[4] Neither the State nor Mercer called Thompson\r\n  as a witness.\r\n[5] Although this evidence was not admissible, we\r\n  do recognize that defense counsel, in her opening remarks to the jury, referred\r\n  to Thompsonâ€™s reduced charges and bond status.Â  According to counselâ€™s opening\r\n  statement, â€œWe donâ€™t know where [Thompson] is.Â  Last time I heard he was out on\r\n  bond.Â  Last time I heard he wasnâ€™t even charged with murder or armed robbery.Â \r\n  That wasnâ€™t how it started out.Â  He was charged with all the same things that\r\nKevin Mercer was.â€\r\n[6] SPECT is an acronym for single-photon emission\r\n  computerized tomography.Â  Richard E. Redding, The Brain-Disordered\r\n    Defendant: Neuroscience and Legal Insanity in the Twenty-First Century, 56 Am. U. L. Rev. 51, 121 (2006).Â  According to Dr. Steedman, â€œa spect scan is a . . . nuclear medicine\r\n  study.Â  It is . . . a way of looking at the function of somebodyâ€™s brain in\r\n  terms of how much blood flow is running through the cortex.Â  Itâ€™s mainly useful\r\n  in detecting whether there are asymmetries and regional differences in blood\r\n  flow . . . to parts of the brain which indicates . . . how hard those parts of\r\n  the brain are working.â€Â  An abnormal spect\r\n  scan means there is either increased or decreased blood flow to a\r\n  certain area in the brain.Â  A decreased flow of blood to a particular region of\r\n  the brain may be referred to as an abnormality and may be associated with\r\n  general cognitive deficiencies and learning disorders.Â  \r\n[7] This Court reminds the bench and bar of the  importance of a meaningful mitigation defense and, concomitantly, the ability  of a capital defendant to fully present mitigation evidence. &nbsp;See Council v.  State, __ S.C. __, __ S.E.2d __ (2008), Op. No. 26543 (S.C. Sup. Ct. re-filed Dec. 29, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 48 at 12) (relying in large part upon Wiggins  v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), this Court determined that counsel&rsquo;s failure  to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence resulted in the  ineffective assistance of counsel requiring a new sentencing hearing).&nbsp; The  trial courts, vested with considerable discretion in evidentiary matters, must  not neglect the due process implications involved in a capital defendant&rsquo;s  right to present mitigation evidence.\r\n[8] In this case, the State repeatedly asked the\r\n  trial court to order Mercer to disclose his experts and to require a written\r\n  report from his experts.Â  The trial court refused to order defense experts to\r\n  produce written reports.Â  State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 216-17, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 873, 878 (2007) (holding that Rule 5, SCRCrimP, provides no basis for a\r\n  trial court to require the creation of written defense expert reports for\r\n  disclosure to the State).Â  The trial court ultimately relented to the Stateâ€™s\r\n  discovery requests by ordering the parties to meet and attempt to resolve the\r\n  impasse.Â  This was done, and because defense counsel failed to hit the bullâ€™s\r\n  eye concerning Dr. Steedmanâ€™s precise opinion regarding the SPECT Scan study,\r\n  the State cried foul.Â  The Stateâ€™s claim of unfair surprise is meritless. Â \r\n[9] The\r\n  analytical framework at play in this post-trial motion (imposing on the trial\r\n  judge a gate-keeping role in making credibility determinations) stands in stark\r\n  contrast to the admissibility of third-party guilt evidence at trial.Â  Provided\r\n  threshold admissibility is met, third-party guilt evidence may not be excluded\r\n  based on the trial courtâ€™s view of the evidence or the perceived â€œstrengthâ€ of\r\n  the Stateâ€™s case. Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319, 330-31 (2006)\r\n  (reversing the exclusion of evidence in a criminal trial and holding that the\r\n  trial court may not exclude evidence of third-party guilt based upon a\r\n  determination of the strength of the Stateâ€™s evidence).Â Â Â  \r\n[10] This inconsistency concerns Mercerâ€™s possession\r\n  of the murder weapon immediately after the murder as he exited the apartment\r\n  complex in Davisâ€™s Navigator.Â  \r\n[11] The trial court charged the jury:Â  \r\n\r\n  Now,\r\n    you will recall that in the guilt phase of the trial I charged you on the\r\n    concept of the hand of one is the hand of all.Â  That concept does not apply in\r\n    this penalty phase of the trial. . . .Â  Before you may consider imposing the\r\n    death penalty, you must first find that the State has proven beyond a\r\n    reasonable doubt that the defendant, Kevin J. Mercer, fired the shot that\r\n    killed the victim.Â  If you find that the State has failed to prove that Kevin\r\n    J. Mercer fired that shot, then you may not impose the death penalty but you\r\n    must impose a life sentence.Â  \r\n\r\n[12] As between Johnston and Fuller, the trial court\r\n  recalled Johnstonâ€™s testimony to the effect that â€œFuller thought he could\r\n  benefit from fabricating a story about Thompson shooting Sergeant Davis.â€Â \r\n  While the record confirms that Fuller was seeking â€œhelpâ€ with his charges, Johnston did not testify to any such â€œfabricationâ€ admission by Fuller.Â  Mercer is correct\r\n  in challenging the trial courtâ€™s erroneous finding in this regard.Â  We view the\r\n  error as insignificant.Â  The strong findings of the trial court against\r\n  Fullerâ€™s credibility cannot reasonably be said to be dependent on this one\r\n  finding.Â  This finding does not form a meaningful part of the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  order, for it stands alone in an otherwise coherent analysis. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of William H.

Conley, both of Simons &amp; Keaveny, of Charleston, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tC.\r\n  Bradley Hutto, of Williams &amp; Williams, of Orangeburg, and Mark Brandon\r\n  Tinsley, of Gooding &amp; Gooding, of Allendale, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review an order of the Court of\r\n  Appeals which dismissed the appeal of Petitioner Brandon Blake as untimely.Â  We\r\n  find Petitionerâ€™s appeal was timely filed and, accordingly, we reverse and\r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nA jury awarded\r\n  Respondent, William Curtis, a $450,000 verdict for injuries sustained in an\r\n  auto accident with Petitioner, Blake. Â Immediately following the verdict, on\r\n  October 31, 2005, Blake requested to make post-trial motions at a later date.Â Â \r\n  The trial court ruled post-trial motions could be made in written form,\r\n  stating, â€œWeâ€™ll have ten days to file any post-trial motions.Â  And yâ€™all can\r\n  just send those to me in Spartanburg, and I will rule on those without the\r\n  necessity of actual oral argument.â€Â  \r\nOn November 10,\r\n  2005, the tenth day after the verdict, Blake served opposing counsel with a\r\n  Rule 59(b) motion for new trial by placing it in the mail.Â  The motion was\r\n  filed by the Orangeburg Clerk of Court five days later, on November 15, 2005.Â \r\n  Curtis responded, claiming the motion was untimely as it was not filed within\r\n  the ten days allotted by the trial judge; the circuit court ruled the motion\r\n  was timely but denied the motion for a new trial on the merits.Â  \r\nBlakeâ€™s appeal to\r\n  the Court of Appeals was dismissed by Judge Cureton on the ground that the\r\n  appeal was untimely.Â  Judge Cureton ruled the motion had to be delivered to and\r\n  received by the Clerk of Court no later than November 10, 2005 in order to\r\n  comply with the trial courtâ€™s instructions.Â Â  As it did not, Judge Cureton\r\n  found the late-filed motion did not stay the time for service of the notice of\r\n  appeal, such that the appeal was untimely.[1]Â \r\n  On motion for reconsideration, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals\r\n  affirmed.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of\r\n  Appeals err in dismissing the appeal as untimely where the motion for a new\r\n  trial was served on opposing counsel on the tenth day after trial?Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA â€œmotion for a new\r\n  trial shall be made promptly after the jury is discharged, or in the\r\n  discretion of the court not later than 10 days thereafter.â€Â  Rule 59(b), SCRCP.\r\n  Â (Emphasis supplied).Â  A timely Rule 59 motion stays the time for an appeal for\r\n  all parties until receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or\r\n  denying such motion.Â  Elam v. SCDOT, 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772\r\n  (2004).Â  The question here is whether the post-trial motion was â€œmadeâ€ at the\r\n  time it was filed with the court, or when it was served on opposing counsel.Â \r\n  We find the motion was â€œmadeâ€ when it was placed in the mail for service on\r\n  opposing counsel.Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial judge\r\n  here exercised his discretion in allowing the parties ten days in which to make\r\n  a post-trial motion.Â  The court then ruled the motion, which was served on the\r\n  tenth day, was timely made.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAlthough Rule 59(b)\r\n  does not define the term â€œmade,â€ other portions of Rule 59 utilize service as\r\n  the effective date.Â  For example, Rule 59(c) sets for the Time for Serving\r\n  Affidavits, stating, â€œ[w]hen a motion for new trial is based upon affidavits\r\n  they shall be served with the motion.â€Â  Similarly, Rule 59(d) permits a court\r\n  on its own initiative to â€œgrant a motion for a new trial, timely served. . .â€Â  Under\r\n  Rule 59(e), â€œa motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later\r\n  than 10 days after receipt of written notice of the entry of the order.â€[2] Â Â Â Â \r\nFurthermore, this\r\n  Court has previously held Rule 59(b) requires service of post trial\r\n  motions within ten days after judgment.Â  See Diamond Jewelers v.\r\n    Naegele Outdoor Advertising, 290 S.C. 260, 349 S.E.2d 888 (1985)\r\n  (recognizing post-trial motions to amend, alter and for a new trial must be served\r\n  not later than ten days after entry of judgment).Â  \r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  hold a motion for a new trial is timely so long as it is served within the time\r\n  period allotted by the trial judge.[3]Â \r\n  We find the trial court properly held Blakeâ€™s motion for a new trial was timely.Â \r\n  We reinstate the appeal and remand the matter to the Court of Appeals for\r\n  consideration on the merits.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Pursuant to Rule 59(f), the time for appeal is\r\n  stayed by a timely Rule 59 motion.\r\n[2] Â In contrast, the current federal version of\r\n  Rule 59(b) specifically requires a new trial be filed no later than 10\r\n  days after the entry of judgment, and Rule 59(c) and (e) also specifically\r\n  require filing rather than service.Â  Prior to the Federal Rule\r\n  59â€™s amendment in 1995, it was the date of service of the motion rather\r\n  than the date of filing which was significant.Â  If service was timely, it was\r\n  sufficient if the motion was filed within a reasonable time after service.Â Â  See Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Â§ 2812 (1995).\r\n[3]Â  It is, however, within the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  discretion whether to allow up to ten days for post-trial motions to be made.Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26584","title":"Johnson v.

Â Sonoco unsuccessfully sought rehearing in the Court of\r\n  Appeals.Â  We subsequently denied Sonocoâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.Â \r\n  The remittitur was sent to the lower court on June 13, 2007.\r\nPrior\r\n  to the conclusion of the underlying appeal, Johnson filed a motion to compel\r\n  payment of the compensation benefits in the circuit court, together with a\r\n  subsequent motion in the circuit court for sanctions (interest and a ten\r\n  percent penalty) against Sonoco.Â  Sonoco objected to the jurisdiction of the\r\n  circuit court on two grounds: (1) the award of workersâ€™ compensation benefits\r\n  was stayed during the appeal, and (2) absent a remand from the appellate court,\r\n  the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider Johnsonâ€™s motions.Â  The\r\n  circuit court rejected Sonocoâ€™s arguments and awarded relief, calculating\r\n  Johnsonâ€™s entitlement to interest as of the date of the single commissionerâ€™s\r\n  order, May 29, 2002, and assessing a ten percent penalty.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  initial order granting relief was filed December 20, 2006, and an amended order\r\n  was filed on March 6, 2007, following Sonocoâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â \r\n  Sonoco appealed.Â  Thereafter, as noted above, the underlying appeal became\r\n  final and the remittitur was sent to the lower court.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the circuit court order of March 6, 2007, Sonoco paid Johnson his compensation\r\n  benefits, but continued with the current appeal challenging the award of\r\n  interest and ten percent penalty.Â  The appeal is before us pursuant to Rule\r\n  204(b), SCACR, certification.\r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  first issue we must resolve is whether the appeal in the underlying case stayed\r\n  Sonocoâ€™s responsibility to make weekly compensation payments to Johnson.Â  Rule\r\n  225(a), SCACR, provides the general rule that service of a notice of appeal in\r\n  a civil matter automatically stays matters affected by the appeal.Â  Some of the\r\n  exceptions to this rule are found in Rule 225(b), which sets forth a non-exhaustive\r\n  list.Â  Rule 225 expressly provides that exceptions to the general rule extend\r\n  beyond the list in subsection (b) and are found in statutes, court rules, and\r\n  case law.\r\nThis Court provided\r\n  such case law when it previously addressed this issue of whether an award of\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation benefits by the circuit court would be stayed by the\r\n  service of the notice of appeal in Case v. Hermitage Cotton Mills, 236\r\n  S.C. 515, 534, 115 S.E.2d 57, 67-68 (1960).Â  In Hermitage this Court\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n\t[I]f the\r\n  Commission should deny him compensation and upon his appeal the circuit court\r\n  should reverse the Commission and hold his claim compensable, the weekly payments\r\n  to be made by the employer pending determination of an appeal from that\r\n  judgment to the Supreme Court should commence from the\r\n  date of the circuit courtâ€™s judgment and should not be calculated retroactively\r\n  from the date of the Commissionâ€™s decision.\r\n\r\nId.Â  In making this determination, this Court interpreted\r\n  section 72-356 of the South Carolina Code (1952).Â  Hermitage, 236 S.C.\r\n  at 534, 115 S.E.2d at 67.Â  This section is substantially similar to section\r\n  42-17-60 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007).Â  We hold that the rule in Hermitage is on point.Â  Therefore, when the commissionâ€™s denial of benefits is reversed\r\n  and the award is made by the circuit court, the weekly payments are not stayed\r\n  by the appeal.[1]\r\nWe further note\r\n  that we have already made such a ruling in this case.Â  In an order\r\n  issued by this Court on November 14, 2006, this Court granted Sonocoâ€™s motion\r\n  for an extension of time to file its petition for certiorari, and we\r\n  specifically stated that the award of benefits to Johnson â€œis not stayed by the\r\n  pendency of this matter.â€Â  This Court went on to cite section 42-17-60; Rule\r\n  225, SCACR; Hermitage, 236 S.C. 515, 115 S.E.2d 57; and McLeod v.\r\n    Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., 280 S.C. 466, 313 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nWe next turn to the\r\n  authority of the circuit court to compel, in the absence of a remand order, the\r\n  weekly payments during the pendency of the appeal.Â  The answer is unambiguously\r\n  provided in Rule 225(a), SCACR, which states, â€œ[t]he lower court . . . retains\r\n  jurisdiction over matters not affected by the appeal including the authority\r\n    to enforce matters not stayed by the appeal.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  circuit court retained authority to compel the payment of weekly benefits, and\r\n  Sonocoâ€™s arguments to the contrary are without merit.Â  No remand from the\r\n  appellate court was necessary.Â  Moreover, because the awards of interest and\r\n  penalty are inextricably linked to Sonocoâ€™s nonpayment of benefits, we follow\r\n  the rationale of Hermitage and hold that the matters\r\n  of interest and penalty were not stayed by the appeal.\r\nSonoco\r\n  further challenges the authority of the circuit court to award interest and assess\r\n  the ten percent penalty under section 42-9-90 of the South Carolina Code (1976).Â  Sonoco contends such an\r\n  award rests exclusively in the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  We find this\r\n  issue is not preserved.Â  The issue first appears in Sonocoâ€™s motion seeking\r\n  reconsideration of the circuit courtâ€™s December 20, 2006 order.Â  An issue may\r\n  not be raised for the first time in a motion to reconsider. Â Commercial\r\n    Credit Loans, Inc. v. Riddle, 334 S.C. 176, 186, 512 S.E.2d 123, 129 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1999) (â€œFurther, because the transcript of the proceedings below is\r\n  omitted from the record, it appears the first time Commercial Credit made this\r\n  argument was in its Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration. Â Accordingly, this\r\n  issue is not properly preserved for our review.â€). Â The matters of interest and\r\n  the ten percent penalty were squarely before the circuit court, and Sonocoâ€™s\r\n  pre-hearing written responses to Johnsonâ€™s motions did not raise the section\r\n  42-9-90 challenge.Â  Moreover, the transcript of the hearing in the circuit\r\n  court is not included in the record on appeal. Â Medlock v. One 1985 Jeep\r\n    Cherokee VIN 1JCWB7828FT129001, 322 S.C. 127, 132, 470 S.E.2d 373, 376\r\n  (1996) (â€œThe appellant has the burden of providing this court with a sufficient\r\n  record upon which to make a decision.â€); Smith v. Ridgeway Chemicals, Inc.,\r\n  302 S.C. 303, 306, 395 S.E.2d 742, 744 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œIt is incumbent upon\r\n  an appellant to present a record sufficient to permit a review of a trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s rulings.â€).Â  We therefore affirm the awards of interest and ten percent\r\n  penalty.Â  Johnson is additionally entitled to interest on the ten percent\r\n  penalty.\r\nWe do agree with Sonocoâ€™s final assignment of error that Johnson\r\n  is not entitled to interest from the date of the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  We\r\n  are guided by the reasoning of Hermitage.Â  236 S.C. at 534, 115 S.E.2d at 67-68 (â€œ[U]pon his\r\n  appeal [if] the circuit court should reverse the Commission and hold his claim\r\n  compensable, the weekly payments to be made by the employer pending\r\n  determination of an appeal from that judgment to the Supreme Court should\r\n  commence from the date of the circuit courtâ€™s judgment and should not be\r\n  calculated retroactively from the date of the Commissionâ€™s decision.â€).Â  This Court\r\n  in Hermitage cited to section 72-356 of the South Carolina Code (1952)\r\n  in referencing a thirty-day supersedeas on appeals from an award of benefits.Â  Id.\r\nSection\r\n  72-356 is the predecessor to section 42-17-60 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007).Â  The thirty-day time period for appeals\r\n  remains a part of section 42-17-60, with the provision that â€œafter that time, the employer is required to make weekly payments\r\n  of compensation and to provide medical treatment ordered . . . .â€Â  Because the\r\n  commission denied Johnsonâ€™s claim and the circuit court awarded benefits, we apply\r\n  this statutory thirty-day supersedeas following the entry of the circuit court\r\n  order, after which the compensation payments should have been made.Â  There was\r\n  no legitimate reason to justify or excuse Sonocoâ€™s failure to pay compensation\r\n  benefits to Johnson during the pendency of the underlying appeal.Â  Johnson is therefore entitled to an award of interest calculated\r\n  from June 15, 2005, which is thirty days from the award of benefits in the circuit\r\n  court.Â  We remand to the circuit court for the sole purpose of calculating the\r\n  interest due Johnson.\r\nIII.\r\nThe\r\n  award of workersâ€™ compensation benefits by the circuit court was not stayed by\r\n  the appeal.Â  Pursuant to Rule 225(a), the circuit court had jurisdiction to\r\n  compel the payment of benefits, as well as interest and penalty, during the\r\n  pendency of the appeal.Â  We affirm the circuit court in its entirety, save the\r\n  effective date of the award of interest.Â  The matter is remanded to the circuit\r\n  court to calculate the award of interest calculated from June 15, 2005.[2]\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED; AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.

Condition Precedent\r\nAppellant argues that the master erred in finding that\r\n  the contract contained a condition precedent.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and\r\n  give legal effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions as determined by the contract\r\n  language.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 353\r\n  S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003).Â \r\n  Where the contractâ€™s language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone\r\n  determines the contractâ€™s force and effect.Â  Schulmeyer, 353 S.C. at\r\n  495, 579 S.E.2d at 134.Â  A contract\r\n  is read as a whole document so that one may not create an ambiguity by pointing out\r\n  a single sentence or clause.Â  Id.Â  It is a question of law for the court whether the\r\n  language of a contract is ambiguous.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623,\r\n  550 S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001).Â  \r\nWe hold that the master correctly found that the contracts\r\n  contained a condition precedent that all owners sign the contract agreeing to\r\n  sell their interests before any contract could be enforced.Â  Reading all of the\r\n  provisions as a whole, we find that the contract assumes that all owners would sell\r\n  their interests in the property and that Appellant would subsequently be the\r\n  sole owner of the property.Â  For example, the contract provides that â€œall\r\n  heirsâ€ agree to a certain purchase price and that closing would be held after\r\n  â€œthe last contractâ€ was signed.Â  The language used in the contract indicates\r\n  that the parties contemplated that the closing would not take place until all\r\n  owners agreed to the terms of the contract, and thus, Appellant could not\r\n  enforce the contract against any owner until all owners signed a contract.Â  \r\nAppellant argues that the primary purpose of the contract was for\r\n  the purchase of individual interests in the property and that â€œfrom the date\r\n  the last contract is signedâ€ relates only to the timing of the closing.Â  In our\r\n  view, Appellant impermissibly focuses on one provision in order to create an\r\n  ambiguity and ignores the rest of the language in the contract indicating that\r\n  the contract required unity of all owners before closing would take place.Â  See Schulmeyer, 353\r\n  S.C. at 495, 579 S.E.2d at 134 (recognizing that the meaning of a\r\n  particular word or phrase is not determined by considering the word or phrase\r\n  by itself, but by reading the contract as a whole and considering the context\r\n  and subject matter of the contract).Â  However, even if the contract was\r\n  ambiguous, any ambiguity will be construed in favor of Respondents as the\r\n  non-drafting party.Â  See S. Atl. Fin. Servs., Inc. v.\r\n    Middleton, 356 S.C. 444, 447, 590 S.E.2d 27,\r\n  29 (2003) (holding that ambiguous language\r\n  in a contract should be interpreted strongly in favor of the non-drafting\r\n  party).Â  \r\nHad Appellant intended to purchase the interests of an individual\r\n  owner without regard to the other ownersâ€™ interest, he could have easily drafted\r\n  a contract to reflect this intent.Â  In our view, to construe the contract\r\n  according to Appellantâ€™s interpretation would not be faithful to the entire\r\n  document and would not reflect the partiesâ€™ intentions.Â  Accordingly, we hold\r\n  that the contract contained a condition precedent which was not satisfied.Â  \r\nII.\r\n  Respondentsâ€™ Ability to Enforce the Condition Precedent\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that even if the contract contained a condition precedent requiring all\r\n  owners to sign the contract, this condition would have been for the benefit of\r\n  Appellant, which he could waive and which could not be enforced by\r\n  Respondents.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Ehlke v. Nemec Const. Co., Inc., the court of appeals held that where a condition precedent was\r\n  solely for the benefit of one party, it could not be asserted as a forfeiture\r\n  by the other party.Â  298 S.C. 477, 381 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  In this case,\r\n  however, Appellant cannot show the condition was solely for his benefit.Â \r\n  Rather, the condition was in accordance with the partiesâ€™ intent\r\n  that the contract would be enforceable once all of the owners had signed the\r\n  contract.Â  See id. at 480, 381 S.E.2d at 511 (finding that the\r\n  intention of the parties as deduced from the language used, the surrounding\r\n  circumstances at the time the contract was executed, and the purpose sought to\r\n  be accomplished by the insertion of the provisionâ€ was that parties intended\r\n  that the condition precedent was for the benefit of the plaintiff).Â  Again, if\r\n  the parties intended for this condition to be solely for Appellantâ€™s benefit,\r\n  Appellant could have easily drafted language reflecting this intent.Â  \r\nIII.\r\n  Substantial Compliance\r\nAppellant argues that even if the contract contained a condition\r\n  precedent requiring all owners to sign the contract, he substantially complied\r\n  with this condition because eight of the nine contracts distributed were\r\n  signed.Â  We disagree.\r\nIf a\r\n  contract contains a condition precedent, that condition must either occur or it\r\n  must be excused before a partyâ€™s duty to perform arises.Â  See Worley v. Yarborough Ford, Inc., 317 S.C. 206, 210, 452 S.E.2d\r\n  622, 624 (Ct. App. 1994) (recognizing that a\r\n  condition precedent is a fact\r\n  other than the lapse of time,\r\n  which, unless excused, must exist or occur before a duty of immediate performance arises).Â  In this case, before the closing could occur, the contract required all of the\r\n  owners to sign the contract.Â  This condition has not been met and has not been\r\n  excused.Â  Therefore, we hold that Appellant may not circumvent the contractâ€™s\r\n  condition precedent by arguing substantial compliance.[3]Â Â  \r\nIV. Testimony\r\nAppellant argues that the master erred in excluding his testimony\r\n  regarding the intent of the parties in using specific terms in the contract\r\n  such as â€œall heirsâ€ and â€œclosing.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThe parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic\r\n  evidence of agreements or understandings contemporaneous with or prior to execution\r\n  of a written instrument when the extrinsic evidence is to be used to\r\n  contradict, vary or explain the written instrument.Â  In re Estate\r\n    of Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 275-76, 539 S.E.2d\r\n  703, 708 (2000).Â  Where a written\r\n  instrument is unambiguous, parol evidence is inadmissible to ascertain the true\r\n  intent and meaning of the parties.Â  Id.\r\nWe\r\n  hold that the master properly excluded this testimony. Â The terms in the\r\n  contract are unambiguous and Appellant was therefore barred from introducing\r\n  evidence to explain these terms.Â  See Silver v. Aabstract Pools &amp; Spas, Inc., 376 S.C. 585, 591, 658 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008), quoting McPherson v. J.E. Sirrine &amp; Co., 206 S.C. 183,\r\n  204, 33 S.E.2d 501, 509 (1945) (â€œIn construing and determining the effect of a\r\n  written contract, the intention of the parties and the\r\n  meaning are gathered primarily from . . . the four corners of the instrumentâ€).\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the master correctly\r\n  denied Appellant specific performance relief.Â  \r\nWALLER, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Owner Iola Moore Smith was unable to sign the contract because she was\r\n  incompetent, and before family members could obtain a power of attorney, she\r\n  passed away.Â  \r\n[2] Respondents and the guardian ad litem argue that we should dismiss this\r\n  appeal because Appellant failed to serve the notice of appeal on the guardian ad\r\n    litem pursuant to Rule 203, SCACR.Â  We find Appellant was not required to\r\n  serve the notice of appeal upon the guardian ad litem because this\r\n  appeal does not involve the partition action and thus, the guardian ad litem is\r\n  not an â€œadverse partyâ€ in this appeal and not a â€œrespondent.â€Â  \r\n[3] This argument appears to be an estoppel claim.Â  However, any\r\n  estoppel issues are not preserved for review as Appellant did not raise the\r\n  issue of estoppel before the master and has not explicitly raised it to this\r\n  Court.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26586","title":"Windham v.

Riddle, 370 S.C. 415, 635 S.E.2d 558 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  This Court granted the Riddlesâ€™ petition for a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe\r\n  Riddles and Windham are adjacent property owners in Orangeburg County. Â Both parties purchased their property from a common grantor, Danny Covington.Â  Covington purchased the combined property in 1991 from Edisto Farm Credit.Â  Marvin Davis,\r\n  the previous owner, had used the property as a dairy farm. Â In 1992, Covington had the property surveyed and divided into two tracts, 1-A and 1-B.Â  \r\nOn November 15,\r\n  1992, Covington and Windham entered into a contract of sale for the\r\n  approximately 142.38 acre tract 1-B (the Windham tract).Â  Pursuant to the terms\r\n  of the contract, Windham agreed to purchase the tract in monthly installments\r\n  over a ten-year period but was allowed to pre-pay the balance without penalty.Â \r\n  During the period of these payments, Windham was allowed full possession and\r\n  occupancy of the property.Â  After Windham satisfied the purchase price, Covington agreed to deliver â€œgood and marketable titleâ€ to Windham.Â  In addition to these\r\n  terms, the contract provided in part:\r\n\r\n\tSeller\r\n  to have a 50&#8242; easement of ingress and egress for the purpose of operating\r\n  and maintaining an irrigation system.Â  [S]aid easement to be centered over\r\n  existing underground piping.Â  Seller agrees not to pump pond lower than 4&#8242;\r\n  below full stage.Â  Existing overhead utilities easement to remain as is.Â  When\r\n  possible seller to run system at times convenient to buyer.Â  Buyer not\r\n  restricting use more than 36 hours at a given time.Â  Seller to have all rights\r\n  to use waters in pond.Â  Seller and buyer mutually agree to use pond dam and canal\r\n  as an easement.Â  [S]eller providing buyer 25&#8242; easement for ingress and\r\n  egress to canal through existing woods road. \r\n\r\nAfter entering into the\r\n  contract of sale, Windham and her family used the tract as a family retreat,\r\n  and they visited every other weekend.Â  Covington continued to farm on tract 1-A.Â  \r\nIn June of 1993, Covington leased a portion of the 257.49 acre tract 1-A (the Riddle tract) to the Riddles,\r\n  who began using the land to operate a dairy farm. Â In the spring of 1994, Covington and the Riddles installed an aboveground irrigation system over the existing\r\n  underground piping on the Windham tract.Â  The pumping station for the\r\n  irrigation system is located on the pond that Windham owns and transports water\r\n  to the Riddle tract.Â  Access to the pump is controlled by a locked gate on the Windham tract.\r\nOn November 17,\r\n  1997, Covington conveyed tract 1-A in its entirety to the Riddles.Â  The deed\r\n  provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tSaid\r\n  conveyance is subject to a 30-foot easement, a 50-foot irrigation easement, a\r\n  25-foot access easement along existing woods road and a canal, all as set forth\r\n  and shown on the above-referenced plat.Â  \r\n\r\nOn\r\n  December 15, 1998, pursuant to the installment contract, Covington deeded the\r\n  tract to Windham after she paid off the purchase price.Â  The deed stated in\r\n  relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tSaid\r\n  conveyance is subject to a (fifty) 50 foot easement of ingress and egress for\r\n  the purpose of operating and maintaining an irrigation system and an agreement\r\n  as to the use of said irrigation easement and irrigation system as set forth in\r\n  that certain Contract of Sale by and between Danny Covington a/k/a J. Danny\r\n  Covington, as Seller and Dorothy Windham, as Buyer dated November 15, 1992 and\r\n  recorded in the office the Register of Deeds for Orangeburg County on December\r\n  28, 1992 . . . . \r\n\r\nAlthough Windham initially allowed the Riddles to use the pond for irrigation purposes, she brought\r\n  an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the Riddles on\r\n  November 12, 2003, claiming the Riddles exceeded the use of the easement as\r\n  contemplated by Covington and Windham in the contract of sale.Â  In her\r\n  Complaint, Windham specifically alleged the Riddles:Â  allowed their livestock\r\n  to roam on Windhamâ€™s property; destroyed Windhamâ€™s fences, gates, and security\r\n  devices; operated the irrigation system for excessive periods of time which\r\n  created a nuisance; obtained waters from Windhamâ€™s property without any legal\r\n  right; and allowed third parties access to the Windham property for\r\n  â€œunauthorized purposes.â€ Â As the basis for her action, Windham asserted the\r\n  easement created in the contract of sale and resulting deed was an easement in\r\n  gross and, thus, the Riddles had no right to this easement.Â  In response, the\r\n  Riddles asserted Windham was estopped from denying the validity of the\r\n  easement. Â The Riddles also claimed the easement was appurtenant to the Riddle\r\n  tract.Â  \r\nAfter a trial, the\r\n  master-in-equity found that the contract of sale between Windham and Covington, in conjunction with the Windham and Riddle deeds, established â€œvarious\r\n  easements for the purpose of irrigating Tract 1-A, the Riddle property.â€Â  The\r\n  master further held the easements were appurtenant to the Riddle tract and,\r\n  therefore, passed to the Riddles when Covington conveyed the land to them.Â \r\n  Additionally, the master concluded that Windham could not maintain an action\r\n  for trespass because the Riddles, the owners of the dominant estate, did not\r\n  abuse or exceed the limits of the easements.Â  Ultimately, the master dismissed Windhamâ€™s Complaint with prejudice and ordered that the â€œirrigation easements are\r\n  appurtenant to the real estate subject to this action and exist as set forth on\r\n  the recorded plats.â€Â  \r\nSubsequently, the\r\n  master denied Windhamâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Windham then appealed the masterâ€™s decision to the Court of Appeals. \r\nIn a divided\r\n  opinion, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the master-in-equity.Â  Windham v. Riddle, 370 S.C. 415, 635 S.E.2d 558 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The\r\n  majority found the master erred by concluding that the easement at issue was\r\n  appurtenant rather than in gross.Â  Prefacing its analysis with a general\r\n  discussion of the differences between an appurtenant easement and an easement\r\n  in gross, the majority focused on the installment land contract that was the\r\n  subject of the dispute.Â  Citing this Courtâ€™s opinion in Lewis v. Premium\r\n    Investment Corporation, the majority noted that typically in this type of\r\n  contract, â€œthe seller retains legal title until the purchase price has been\r\n  fully paid, and the purchaser is entitled to immediate possession.â€Â  Id. at 419, 635 S.E.2d at 560; see Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351\r\n  S.C. 167, 170-73, 568 S.E.2d 361, 363-64 (2002) (stating that in an installment\r\n  land contract, the seller retains legal title until the purchase price is fully\r\n  paid and that the vendee in possession of the land is the owner of an equitable\r\n  interest in the property).Â  \r\nRelying\r\n  on the long-standing common law rule that an easement cannot exist where both\r\n  the purported servient and dominant estates are owned by the same person, the\r\n  majority found that an easement could not have been created by the 1992 contract\r\n  of sale.Â  Id. at 419, 635 S.E.2d at 560 (citing Haselden v. Schein,\r\n  167 S.C. 534, 539, 166 S.E. 634, 635 (1932)).Â  Specifically, the majority\r\n  stated, â€œ[a]s Covington retained legal title to the Windham tract and also held\r\n  title to the Riddle tract, no easement could have been created by the Windham contract of sale in 1992.â€Â  Windham, 370 S.C. at 419, 635 S.E.2d at 560.Â Â  \r\nThe majority further\r\n  relied on its earlier decision in Springob v. Farrar, 334 S.C. 585, 514\r\n  S.E.2d 135 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In Springob, Dr. Shenoy owned Lot 14, and\r\n  his wife owned adjoining Lot 13, where the Shenoysâ€™ home was located.Â  The\r\n  Shenoys built a well on Lot 14 and attached it to an irrigation system serving Lot 13.Â  In 1986, Dr. Shenoy sold Lot 14 to L.G.B., Inc.Â  The deed from Dr. Shenoy\r\n  â€œreserved to the Grantorâ€ an easement on Lot 13 for use of the well on Lot 14.Â  A house was built on Lot 14 and eventually the Farrars bought the property in\r\n  1988.Â  The deed to the Farrars stated â€œthis conveyance is subject to all\r\n  easements, rights, reservations, restrictions, and covenants of record\r\n  affecting said property.â€ Â Id. at 587, 514 S.E.2d at 137.Â  The Farrarsâ€™\r\n  closing attorney informed them of the easement to the well located on their\r\n  property.Â  In 1989, Mrs. Shenoy sold Lot 13 to Kenneth Perry, and the South\r\n  Carolina Federal Savings Bank obtained title to the lot through foreclosure.Â \r\n  While Lot 13 was vacant, the Farrars disconnected the well on their property\r\n  from the Lot 13 irrigation system and connected it to their own system serving Lot 14.Â  \r\nIn 1993, Springob\r\n  purchased Lot 13 unaware of the easement on Lot 14.Â  After discovering the well\r\n  on Lot 14, Springob demanded use of the well, but the Farrars refused.Â \r\n  Springob brought an action for trespass and intentional interference with and\r\n  obstruction of an easement.Â  He also sought an injunction prohibiting the Farrars\r\n  from further interfering with the easement.Â  The Farrars answered, asserting\r\n  the easement was personal to Dr. Shenoy and, therefore, was an easement in\r\n  gross.Â  The Court of Appeals agreed with the Farrars, finding the easement was\r\n  in gross rather than appurtenant.Â  In so holding, the Court of Appeals stated:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  this case, L.G.B. Deed reserved an easement in favor of â€œthe Grantor.â€Â  The\r\n  grantor of the L.G.B. Deed was Dr. Shenoy, the sole owner of Lot 14.Â  Because\r\n  the easement was reserved for Dr. Shenoy only, and Dr. Shenoy did not own Lot 13, the lot benefited by the easement, the requirement that an appurtenant easement\r\n  have â€œone terminus on the land of the party claiming itâ€ is not satisfied.\r\n\r\nId. at 589, 514 S.E.2d at 137-38.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the Windham deed referred to the language of the contract of sale, which\r\n  reserved an easement in favor of â€œSellerâ€ only, and Covington no longer owned\r\n  the Riddle tract at the time he deeded the Windham tract, the majority further\r\n  found an appurtenant easement was not created for the benefit of the Riddles as\r\n  in Springob.Â  Windham, 370 S.C. at 419-20, 635 S.E.2d at 560-61.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, the dissent found that an appurtenant easement was established in the\r\n  contract for the sale of the land from Covington to Windham. Â Id. at 421-22,\r\n  635 S.E.2d at 561. Â In reaching this conclusion, the dissent focused on when\r\n  the easement was created and distinguished the instant case from Haselden and Springob.Â  The dissent believed that the contract of sale between Windham and Covington, rather than the deed, was â€œthe instrument that established the\r\n  legal relationship between the partiesâ€ and was â€œthe functional equivalent of a\r\n  conveyance coupled with a method of financing.â€Â  Id. at 422, 635 S.E.2d\r\n  at 561.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the dissent believed that â€œno discussion of the requirement that an appurtenant\r\n  easement have one terminus on the land of the party claimingâ€ was necessary,\r\n  the dissent felt compelled to distinguish Springob because the majority\r\n  heavily relied on that decision.Â  Id. at 423, 635 S.E.2d at 562.Â Â Â  Â \r\nIn\r\n  distinguishing that case, the dissent noted that in Springob, the person\r\n  who reserved the easement never owned the purported dominant estate, only\r\n  owning at one time the servient estate.Â  In contrast, Covington â€œunquestionably\r\n  owned the dominant estate at the time the contract was entered into.â€Â  Id. at 423, 635 S.E.2d at 562.Â  Secondly, the dissent did not find dispositive the\r\n  fact that the Riddle deed did not create an appurtenant easement.Â  The dissent\r\n  reasoned that â€œthere is no necessity to expressly mention an easement\r\n  appurtenant when conveying the dominant estate.â€ Id. Â Because â€œall the\r\n  elements necessary for the creation of an easement appurtenant were in\r\n  existence at the time the contract was entered into between Covington and\r\n  Windham,â€ the dissent concluded that the later conveyance of â€œâ€˜bare legal titleâ€™\r\n  was a required fulfillment of the contractual terms already set in stone.â€Â  Id. at 423-24, 635 S.E.2d at 562. \r\nThe Riddles\r\n  petitioned for and were granted a writ of certiorari for this Court to review\r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  Riddles assert the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the easement created\r\n  through the sales of two parcels by Covington, a common grantor, was an\r\n  easement in gross rather than an appurtenant easement.Â  Relying primarily on the\r\n  dissent, the Riddles claim that under the majorityâ€™s analysis â€œthe nature of\r\n  this transaction [an installment land contract] erects an insurmountable\r\n  obstacle to the easementâ€™s being recognized as appurtenant.â€Â  Although the\r\n  Riddles do not dispute that Covington retained â€œtitle ownershipâ€ of the\r\n  servient estate after the 1992 sale to Windham, they contend the sales contract\r\n  conveyed to Windham the most significant rights in the property.Â  Thus, the\r\n  Riddlesâ€™ right of access â€œwas described and reserved in the 1992 sales\r\n  agreement.â€Â  As will be discussed, we agree with the majority opinion in the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ decision and specifically reject the reasoning in the\r\n  dissenting opinion.\r\nâ€œAn easement is a right which one person\r\n  has to use the land of another for a specific purpose, and gives no title to\r\n  the land on which the servitude is imposed.â€ Douglas v. Med. Investors, Inc.,\r\n  256 S.C. 440, 445, 182 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1971) (citations omitted).Â  â€œAn\r\n  easement is therefore not an estate in lands in the usual sense.â€ Id.Â  An easement may be created by reservation in a deed. Â Sandy Island Corp. v.\r\n    Ragsdale, 246 S.C. 414, 419, 143 S.E.2d 803, 806 (1965).Â  \r\nIn construing a deed, â€œthe intention of the grantor must be ascertained and\r\n  effectuated, unless that intention contravenes some well settled rule of law or\r\n  public policy.â€ Â Wayburn v. Smith, 270 S.C. 38, 41-42, 239 S.E.2d 890,\r\n  892 (1977).Â  â€œIn determining the grantorâ€™s intent, the deed must be construed as a whole and effect given to every part if it\r\n  can be done consistently with the law.â€ Gardner v. Mozingo, 293\r\n  S.C. 23, 25, 358 S.E.2d 390, 391-92 (1987). Â â€œThe intention of the grantor must\r\n  be found within the four corners of the deed.â€ Id. \r\nIn Tupper v. Dorchester County, this Court\r\n  distinguished between the types of easements, stating:\r\n\r\n\tThe character of an express easement is\r\n  determined by the nature of the right and the intention of the parties creating\r\n  it. 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 13 (1966).Â  An easement in\r\n  gross is a mere personal privilege to use the land of another; the privilege is\r\n  incapable of transfer. Â Sandy\r\n    Island Corp. v. Ragsdale, 246 S.C. 414, 143 S.E.2d 803 (1965).Â  In\r\n  contrast, an appurtenant easement inheres in the land, concerns the premises,\r\n  has one terminus on the land of the party claiming it, and is essentially\r\n  necessary to the enjoyment thereof. Â Id.; Smith v. Commissioners,\r\n  312 S.C. 460, 441 S.E.2d 331 (Ct. App. 1994); Carolina Land Company, Inc. v.\r\n    Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 217 S.E.2d 16 (1975); Sandy Island Corp. v. Ragsdale,\r\n  supra; 12 S.C. Juris. Easements Â§ 3.Â  It also passes with the dominant\r\n  estate upon conveyance. Â Carolina Land Co., Inc. v. Bland, supra.Â  Unless\r\n  an easement has all the elements necessary to be an appurtenant easement, it\r\n  will be characterized as a mere easement in gross. 12\r\n  S.C. Juris. Easements Â§ 3(c). Where language in a plat reflecting an\r\n  easement is capable of more than one construction, that construction which\r\n  least restricts the property will be adopted. Â Hamilton v. CCM, Inc.,\r\n  274 S.C. 152, 263 S.E.2d 378 (1980).\r\n\r\nTupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325-26,\r\n  487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).\r\nApplying the foregoing to the facts of the instant case, we agree\r\n  with the Court of Appealsâ€™ majority opinion.Â  Under an installment land\r\n  contract, legal title to the subject property is not transferred to the buyer\r\n  until the purchase price is satisfied.Â  Lewis, 351 S.C. at 170-73, 568 S.E.2d at 363-64.Â \r\n  Therefore, pursuant to the Windham sales contract, Covington retained legal\r\n  title to the Windham tract until 1998, when Windham paid off the purchase\r\n  price.Â  The 1998 Windham deed stated that it was subject to the easement in\r\n  favor of Covington, the seller, as set forth in the 1992 sales contract.Â  Because\r\n  Covington retained legal title to both the Windham tract and the Riddle tract\r\n  in 1992, an easement could not have been created by the 1992 installment land\r\n  contract. Â Haselden, 167 S.C. at 539, 166 S.E. at 635.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we agree with the Court of Appeals that the 1998 Riddle deed did not create an\r\n  appurtenant easement.Â  Before Covington conveyed legal title to Windham in 1998, he sold tract 1-A to the Riddles in 1997.Â  Given that the Windham deed reserved the easement to Covington and he sold the dominant estate to the\r\n  Riddles in 1997, the â€œterminusâ€ requirement for an appurtenant easement was not\r\n  met similar to the conveyance in Springob.Â  See Shia v.\r\n    Pendergrass, 222 S.C. 342, 351, 72 S.E.2d 699, 703 (1952) (noting the\r\n  absence of a terminus on property is fatal to claim of an appurtenant\r\n  easement).\r\nIn\r\n  reaching this conclusion, we have carefully considered the dissenting opinion\r\n  in the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.[1]Â  For several reasons, we believe that an adoption of\r\n  that approach would create\r\n  unforeseeable ramifications in this stateâ€™s current property jurisprudence. \r\nFirst, the inherent nature of an installment land contract, an\r\n  unrecorded document, precludes the creation of an appurtenant easement at the\r\n  point the contract is entered into by the parties.Â  With an installment land contract, the seller retains\r\n  legal title until the purchase price is fully paid.Â  Thus, an installment land\r\n  contract is not, as asserted by the Riddles, tantamount to a conveyance.Â  If an\r\n  appurtenant easement were created at the point the contract was entered into,\r\n  problems would arise if the buyer defaulted before legal title was conveyed by\r\n  a deed.Â  The question would then become whether the easement would be\r\n  extinguished when the buyer defaulted or if it transferred to the next buyer.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find it is essential to retain the two-part procedure of an installment land\r\n  contract which requires not only a contract of sale but also a deed to convey\r\n  ownership to the property after the purchase price has been satisfied.Â  Unlike\r\n  the Riddles, we do not view these requirements as â€œtechnical,â€ but rather, find\r\n  they serve a legitimate purpose for all parties involved in installment land\r\n  contracts.Â  Therefore, we reject the Riddlesâ€™ contention that an appurtenant\r\n  easement may be created simply by entering into an installment land contract.\r\nSecondly, we believe this radical approach to appurtenant\r\n  easements is based more on efficiency than legal analysis.Â  See John E. Lansche, Jr., Ancient, Antiquated, &amp;\r\n    Archaic:Â  South Carolina Fails to Embrace the Rule that a Grantor May Reserve\r\n    and Easement in Favor of a Third Party, 52 S.C. L. Rev. 269, 285 (2000) (â€œBy overruling the common law, states\r\n  like California and Kentucky made it easier for potential buyers conducting a\r\n  title search to find encumbrances on a specific tract of land.Â  Under the\r\n  common-law rule, if a grantor wanted to reserve an easement in favor of a third\r\n  party the grantor had to execute a deed of easement to that third person.Â \r\n  Next, the grantor had to execute a deed to the grantee.â€).Â  Although the common\r\n  law approach may require additional steps in creating an easement in favor of a\r\n  third party, it is not a task that is insurmountable.Â  Therefore, we decline to\r\n  overrule settled property law. \r\nFinally,\r\n  even though this decision may appear to be inequitable, we note the Riddles are\r\n  not without other irrigation options given their property borders the Little\r\n  River.[2]Â \r\n  Thus, it is questionable whether an appurtenant easement is essentially\r\n  necessary to the enjoyment of the property.Â  See Kershaw v. Burns,\r\n  91 S.C. 129, 133, 74 S.E. 378, 379 (1912) (â€œThe principle is well settled that\r\n  a right of way appurtenant cannot be granted, unless it is essentially\r\n  necessary to the enjoyment of the land to which it appertains.â€); Ballington\r\n    v. Paxton, 327 S.C. 372, 380, 488 S.E.2d 882, 887 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œAn\r\n  appendant or appurtenant easement must inhere in the land, concern the\r\n  premises, have one terminus on the land of the party claiming it, and be essentially\r\n  necessary to the enjoyment thereof.â€). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we hold the Court of Appeals correctly found the Riddles do\r\n  not have an appurtenant easement for access and irrigation purposes across Windhamâ€™s property.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result\r\n  only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We have also reviewed the dissent in Springob and several secondary sources which have advocated for this Court to overrule\r\n  the common law requirements for appurtenant easements.Â  These authors have\r\n  characterized the current easement law of South Carolina to be â€œacademicâ€ and\r\n  â€œarchaic.â€Â  According to these authors, the trend among other jurisdictions is\r\n  to overrule the common law which would favor effectuating a grantorâ€™s intent to\r\n  create an interest, i.e., an easement, to a third party.Â  See Springob,\r\n  334 S.C. at 595-99, 514 S.E.2d at 141-43 (Anderson, J., dissenting) (outlining\r\n  cases from other jurisdictions where the appellate courts rejected the common\r\n  law rule that one cannot reserve an easement to a stranger to the title);Â  John\r\n  E.

Shealy, III, both of Baker, Ravenel &amp; Bender, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â Â Â Â  In Hancock v. Mid-South Management Co., Inc., the court of appeals affirmed the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of Respondent Mid-South Management Company.Â  370 S.C. 131, 634 S.E.2d 12 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  We granted a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review that decision and now reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nPetitioner Betty J. Hancock filed a negligence action\r\n  against Respondent after she tripped and fell in the parking lot of the office\r\n  of The Newberry Observer, which is owned by Respondent.Â  Petitioner\r\n  alleged Respondent was negligent in failing to maintain a safe premises.Â \r\n  Respondent moved for summary judgment, and at the hearing, the parties\r\n  submitted deposition testimony from Petitioner and Petitionerâ€™s daughter-in-law\r\n  (Daughter) and photographs of the parking lot.Â  Although Petitioner could not\r\n  identify the exact cause of her fall, she testified that she tripped on â€œa rock\r\n  or something to that effect,â€ â€œsomething raised up,â€ and â€œbroken asphalt.â€Â \r\n  Daughter, who witnessed the fall, testified that Petitioner â€œtripped on that\r\n  mess in front of the Observer.â€Â  Additionally, Petitioner submitted an\r\n  affidavit from a former employee who worked at the office of The Newberry\r\n    Observer which provided that the employees were aware that the parking lot\r\n  was in disrepair and that they had complained to management regarding the\r\n  deteriorated state of the parking lot.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Respondent finding that the\r\n  change in the elevation in the parking lot caused Petitionerâ€™s fall, that the\r\n  change in elevation was not a dangerous condition, and that even if it was a\r\n  dangerous condition, Respondent had no duty to warn since the elevation change\r\n  was an open and obvious condition.Â  The court of appeals affirmed the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision, and\r\n  Petitioner presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    court of appeals err in affirming the circuit courtâ€™s decision granting summary\r\n    judgment?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and\r\n  it is clear the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Â Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the\r\n  evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence\r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Â Koester\r\n    v. Carolina Rental Ctr., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994).Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nWe first address\r\n  Respondentâ€™s argument that Petitioner must present more than a mere scintilla\r\n  of evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment.Â  The rule followed in\r\n  the federal court system provides that â€œa â€˜mere\r\n  scintilla of evidenceâ€™ is not sufficient to withstand the challenge.â€ Â Rogers v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 356 S.C. 85, 92, 588 S.E.2d 87,\r\n  90 (2003), quoting Crinkley v. Holiday Inns, 844 F.2d 156, 160 (4th Cir.1988).Â  We recognize that the court of appeals has been\r\n  somewhat inconsistent on whether a mere scintilla of evidence will overcome a\r\n  motion for summary judgment.[1]Â \r\n  This Court, however, has consistently held that where the federal standard applies or\r\n  where a heightened burden of proof is required, there must be more than a scintilla of evidence in order to\r\n  defeat a motion for summary judgment.[2]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold that in cases applying the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the non-moving\r\n  party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to\r\n  withstand a motion for summary judgment.Â  However, in cases requiring a\r\n  heightened burden of proof or in cases applying federal law, we hold that the\r\n  non-moving party must submit more than a mere scintilla of evidence to\r\n  withstand a motion for summary judgment.[3]Â  \r\nTurning to the merits of the case, although the operator of a parking lot is not an insurer of\r\n  the safety of those who use the lot, reasonable care must be used by the\r\n  operator to keep the premises used by invitees in a reasonably safe condition.Â  Henderson v. St.\r\n    Francis Community Hosp., 303 S.C. 177, 180, 399 S.E.2d\r\n  767, 768 (1990). Â However, a\r\n  possessor of land is not liable to his invitees for physical harm caused to\r\n  them by any activity or condition on the land whose danger is known or obvious\r\n  to them, unless the possessor should anticipate the harm despite such knowledge\r\n  or obviousness.Â  Callander v. Charleston\r\n    Doughnut Corp., 305\r\n  S.C. 123, 126, 406 S.E.2d 361, 362 (1991),\r\n  adopting Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 343A, Known or Obvious Dangers (1965).\r\nIn our view, the court\r\n  of appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment.Â \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s testimony, Daughterâ€™s testimony, and the former employeeâ€™s\r\n  affidavit showed that the parking lot was in a state of disrepair.Â  Thus, taken\r\n  in a light most favorable to Petitioner, evidence shows that Respondent knew or\r\n  should have known that a dangerous condition existed on its premises and that\r\n  invitees would have to encounter this condition.Â  See Henderson, 303 S.C. at 180, 399 S.E.2d at 769 (reversing the trial courtâ€™s grant of a JNOV motion because the\r\n  plaintiff presented evidence that a hospital failed to keep its parking lot\r\n  reasonably safe).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the court of appeals erred in affirming the grant of summary judgment based on\r\n  the finding that even if the parking lot contained a dangerous condition it was\r\n  open and obvious.Â  While a parking lotâ€™s state of disrepair may be considered\r\n  open and obvious, a jury could determine that Respondent should have anticipated\r\n  that such a condition may cause an invitee to fall and injure themselves.Â Â  See Creech v.\r\n    South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Dept., 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997)\r\n  (holding that a dock without a guard rail on one side was an open and obvious\r\n  condition, but that the defendant should have anticipated the harm); Callander, 305 S.C. at 126, 406 S.E.2d at 363 (holding that although a\r\n  missing seat on a stool was an open and obvious condition, the owner should\r\n  have anticipated the harm).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the that the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  grant of summary judgment because a genuine issue of material facts exists\r\n  regarding whether Petitionerâ€™s injuries resulted from a dangerous condition\r\n  and, if so, whether Respondent should have anticipated this type of harm.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals.\r\nWALLER,\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In Anders v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins.\r\n  Co., the court of appeals stated that â€œ[a]t the summary judgment stage of the proceedings,\r\n  it [is] only necessary for the [nonmoving party] to submit a scintilla of\r\n  evidence warranting determination by a jury.â€Â  307 S.C. 371, 375,\r\n  415 S.E.2d 406, 408 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  However, the court of appeals has also declared that â€œ[t]he existence\r\n  of a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving partyâ€™s position is\r\n  not sufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment.Â  Shelton\r\n    v. LS &amp; K, Inc., 374 S.C. 294, 297,\r\n  648 S.E.2d 307, 308 (Ct. App. 2007); see\r\n    also Bravis v. Dunbar, 316 S.C. 263, 265, 449 S.E.2d\r\n495, 496 (Ct. App.1994).Â  \r\n[2] See Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353\r\n  S.C. 208, 578 S.E.2d 329 (2003) (applying the unmistakable and convincing evidence standard in an undue influence case); Whaley v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362\r\n  S.C. 456, 609 S.E.2d 286 (2005) (applying the federal\r\n  heightened standard in a Federal Employerâ€™s Liability Act suit); and Fleming v. Rose, 350\r\n  S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002) (applying the clear and\r\nconvincing standard of proof in a libel action brought by a public figure).\r\n[3] We note that this appeal does not depend on whether a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence is sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment\r\nbecause Petitioner has presented more than a scintilla of evidence.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26588","title":"Hipp v.

Id.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe circuit court cited three grounds for enjoining\r\n  suspension of Respondentâ€™s driverâ€™s license: (1) that the applicable statute is\r\n  ambiguous; (2) the doctrine of laches; and (3) that suspension twelve years\r\n  after conviction violates the â€œfundamental fairnessâ€ required by due process.Â \r\n  We find the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion as to fundamental fairness to be\r\n  persuasive and so, affirm.[1]\r\nA\r\n  personâ€™s interest in his driverâ€™s license is property that a state may not take\r\n  away without satisfying the requirements of due process. Bell v.\r\n    Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed2d 90 (1971).Â Â  Due process is\r\n  violated when a party is denied fundamental fairness. City of Spartanburg v. Parris, 251 S.C. 187, 191, 161 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1968).Â  \r\nThis Court addressed facts similar to those in the case at hand in State v. Chavis, 261 S.C. 408, 200 S.E.2d 390 (1973).Â  While we found\r\n  fundamental fairness was not violated by suspension after a one-year delay, we\r\n  allowed that there might be circumstances under which it could be soundly held\r\n  that the State had no right to suspend a driverâ€™s license after a lengthy delay. Id. at 411, 200 S.E.2d at 391.Â  We find in the instant case the\r\n  extreme circumstances contemplated by Chavis.Â  Â Â \r\nWhile\r\n  we do not intend to set forth a bright line rule, we find that imposition of a\r\n  suspension after more than twelve years delay, where Respondent bears no fault\r\n  for the delay, is manifestly a denial of fundamental fairness.[2]Â \r\n  Though neither dispositive nor directly applicable to the instant case, we note\r\n  that Title 56 of the South Carolina Code, which addresses â€œMotor Vehicles,â€ is\r\n  replete with ten-year limitations for purposes of sentence enhancement and\r\n  keeping record of convictions. See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  56-1-746 (for purposes of determining a prior offense for sentence enhancement\r\n  of alcohol-related offenses, only convictions within ten years of the date of\r\n  the most recent violation are considered prior offenses); 56-1-1340 (violation\r\n  convictions shall be entered in the records of the SCDMV for a period of ten\r\n  years); 56-5-2940 (for sentence enhancement of convictions for operating motor\r\n  vehicle under influence of alcohol or drugs, only those violations which\r\n  occurred within ten years preceding date of last violation constitute prior\r\n  violations); 56-5-1990 (in determining time of suspension of driverâ€™s license,\r\n  only violations which occurred within ten years of the last violation shall\r\n  constitute prior violations).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that under the unique\r\n  circumstances of this case, the attempted suspension of Respondentâ€™s driverâ€™s license\r\n  twelve years after conviction constitutes a denial of fundamental fairness.Â \r\n  The order enjoining suspension is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\nWALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Having found the circuit courtâ€™s decision supported by its finding that\r\n  Respondent was denied fundamental fairness, we do not address the remaining\r\n  grounds. See Wilson v. Moseley, 327 S.C. 144, 147, 488\r\nS.E.2d 862, 864 (1997). \r\n[2] It should be noted that neither Respondent nor SCDMV is at fault for the\r\n  delay.Â  The unexplained delay in reporting the 1993 violation appears to be\r\nsolely attributable to the inaction of the State of Georgia.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26589","title":"McCullar v.

Estate of Cox, Op. No. 2006-UP-332 (S.C. Ct. App. filed September 20,\r\n  2006).Â  We reverse.\r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Court of Appeals that there is no subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  issue here, and thus both the Estate and the circuit court erred in relying on\r\n  Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP. Â In our opinion, however, the Court of Appeals erred in\r\n  failing to exercise its discretion under Rule 220(c), SCACR, to affirm the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s dismissal on another ground appearing in the record.Â  \r\nSubject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is defined as â€œthe power of a court to hear and determine\r\n  cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Dove\r\n    v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598 (1994) (internal citation\r\n  omitted).Â  Tort suits are within the circuit courtâ€™s jurisdiction.Â  Sabb v.\r\n    South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d 231 (2002).Â  Here, on\r\n  its face, this complaint alleges a tort and therefore is not subject to\r\n  dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals cited cases holding the capacity of parties to sue or be sued is not a\r\n  question of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  It is true that whether a party is a\r\n  â€œreal party in interestâ€ is not a matter of subject matter jurisdiction,[1] nor is the issue of a partyâ€™s capacity to sue.[2]Â \r\n  What is at issue here, however, is not capacity, standing, or party in\r\n  interest, but something much more fundamental: whether, at the time the suit\r\n  was purportedly commenced, there existed a juridical entity known as â€œEstate of\r\n  Dr. William Cox Campbell.â€Â  Since it is undisputed that Dr. Campbellâ€™s Estate\r\n  was closed months before this action was allegedly commenced by the then pro\r\n    se respondents, the answer is â€œno.â€\r\nÂ The\r\n  general rule, cited by this Court in a suit brought by a nonexistent plaintiff,\r\n  is:\r\n\r\n  [I]f\r\n    there is a lack of legal entity, the whole action failsâ€¦.If an action is\r\n    brought in the name of that which under the lex fori has no legal\r\n    entity, it is as if there was no plaintiff in the record and therefore no\r\n    action before the Courtâ€¦Although an action brought in the name of that which\r\n    has no legal entity is a nullity, an action in which a legally existing\r\n      plaintiff has been misnamed is still a true action, to which the court can\r\n    give full effect, subject only to defendantâ€™s right to object at the threshold\r\n    for misnomerâ€¦.\r\n\r\nCommercial &amp; Savings\r\n  Bank of Lake City v. Ward, 146 S.C.\r\n  77, 143 S.E. 546 (1928) (Ward) (internal citation omitted) (emphasis in\r\n  original); see also Blackwood v. Spartanburg Commandery No. 3,\r\n    Knights Templar, 185 S.C. 56, 193 S.E. 195 (1937) overruled in part on\r\n      other grounds Scovill v. Johnson, 190 S.C. 457, 3 S.E.2d 543 (1939,)\r\n  citing the Ward rule with approval in a defendant misnomer case.\r\nWe reverse the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals because an action brought against a\r\n  nonexistent defendant is a nullity.Â  While the Estate sought unsuccessfully to characterize\r\n  this fundamental defect as a Rule 12(b), SCRCP, issue, a fair reading of the\r\n  record and the circuit courtâ€™s ruling is that the dismissal rests on the lack\r\n  of a defendant.Â  The Estate raised this issue promptly,[3] the defect is fatal to Respondentsâ€™ suit,[4] and the action was properly ended by the circuit court.[5]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals reinstating this lawsuit is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\nWALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.
