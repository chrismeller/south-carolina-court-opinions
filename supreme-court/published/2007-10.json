Seymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, all of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tRodman C. Tullis, of Spartanburg, Respondent, pro se.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel filed formal charges against respondent, Rodman C. Tullis, alleging misconduct in eight different\r\n  matters.Â  Respondent failed to file an answer, and he was found\r\n  to be in default.Â  After a hearing,[1] the sub&#8209;panel and the full panel recommended that respondent be\r\n  disbarred and be required to pay various costs.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline is\r\n  given rests entirely with this Court. Â In re McFarland, 360 S.C. 101,\r\n  600 S.E.2d 537 (2004); In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551 S.E.2d 586\r\n  (2001).Â  Under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), respondent\r\n  is in default and therefore is deemed to have admitted all factual allegations of\r\n  the formal charges. Â See Rule 24 RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  The charges of\r\n  misconduct against respondent likewise are deemed admitted, and therefore, the\r\n  Court must only determine the appropriate sanction.Â  E.g., Matter of\r\n    Thornton, 327 S.C. 193, 489 S.E.2d 198&nbsp;(1997).\r\nIn In re Murph,\r\n  350 S.C. 1, 4, 564 S.E.2d 673, 675&nbsp;(2002), the Court stated the following:\r\n\r\n\tAn\r\n  attorney usually does not abandon a license to practice law without a fight. Â Those\r\n  who do must understand that â€œneglecting to participate [in a disciplinary\r\n  proceeding] is entitled to substantial weight in determining the sanction.â€â€¦ Â An\r\n  attorneyâ€™s failure to answer charges or appear to defend or explain alleged\r\n  misconduct indicates an obvious disinterest in the practice of law. Â Such an\r\n  attorney is likely to face the most severe sanctions because a central purpose\r\n  of the disciplinary process is to protect the public from unscrupulous or\r\n  indifferent lawyers.\r\n\r\n(Citation\r\n  omitted).\r\nWe\r\n  find respondent, inter alia, failed to adequately communicate with his\r\n  clients, failed to act with diligence and competence; misused and mismanaged\r\n  trust account funds; and failed to respond to Disciplinary Counsel inquiries\r\n  and notices of full investigation regarding these matters.\r\nBased\r\n  on the admitted facts, respondent\r\n  violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), found in Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR:\r\n\r\n\tRule 1.1 - Competence\r\n\tRule 1.2 - Scope of Representation\r\n\tRule 1.3 - Diligence\r\n\tRule 1.4 - Communication \r\n\tRule 1.5 - Fees \r\n\tRule 1.8 - Conflict of Interest; Prohibited \r\n\t\tTransactions\r\n\tRule 1.15 - Safekeeping of Property\r\n\tRule 1.16 - Declining or Terminating \r\n\t\tRepresentation\r\n\tRule 4.4 - Respect for Rights of Third Persons\r\n\tRule 8.1 - Bar Admissions and Disciplinary \r\n\t\tMatters\r\n\tRule 8.4(d) &amp; (e) - Dishonesty or \r\n\t\tMisrepresentation, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of \r\n\t\tJustice\r\n\r\nWe further find the following violations of the\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â   \r\n\r\n\tRule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of Professional \r\n\tConduct) \r\n\tRule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute \r\n\tthe administration of justice or to bring the courts or legal profession \r\n\tinto disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law)\r\n\tRule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon \r\n\tadmission to the practice of law).\r\n\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  respondent has engaged in misconduct which warrants the severe sanction of\r\n  disbarment.Â  See, e.g., In re Murph, 350 S.C. at 5, 564\r\n  S.E.2d at 675-76 (attorney disbarred for, inter alia, failing\r\n  to:Â  represent a client competently; act with reasonable diligence and\r\n  promptness; keep a client reasonably informed; deliver promptly to a client or\r\n  third person funds that the client or person was entitled to receive; and respond\r\n  to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); In the\r\n    Matter of Edwards, 323 S.C. 3, 448 S.E.2d 547 (1994) (attorney\r\n  disbarred for, inter alia, failing to represent his clients diligently\r\n  and competently; failing to keep clients informed, misappropriating or\r\n  improperly using client funds, knowingly presenting false testimony, and\r\n  failing to cooperate in investigation of disciplinary charges against him).[2]\r\nIn\r\n  addition to disbarment, we also order respondent to pay\r\n  both restitution of $410.00 to chiropractor Princess Porter and the costs of\r\n  these disciplinary proceedings.\r\nWithin\r\n  fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with\r\n  the Clerk of Court showing that he has compiled with Rule 30 of Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Perry M.

Department of Public Safety, of Blythewood, for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant was charged with possession of\r\n  alcohol by a minor in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-8920 (Supp. 2006).[1]Â \r\n  The case was heard in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  After the Stateâ€™s presentation of\r\n  its case, the magistrate granted appellantâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on\r\n  the ground Â§ 20-7-8920 was unconstitutional as applied to appellant.\r\nThereafter, the\r\n  State appealed to the circuit court and argued that the magistrate erred by directing\r\n  a verdict of not guilty.Â  At a hearing to determine whether the circuit court\r\n  had jurisdiction to hear the Stateâ€™s appeal, the State indicated it was not\r\n  seeking to reinstate the charge against appellant, but was seeking review of\r\n  the magistrateâ€™s finding that the statute was unconstitutional.Â  The court\r\n  found that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal and subsequently found the\r\n  magistrate had erred by ruling Â§ 20-7-8920 was unconstitutional.Â  Appellant now\r\n  appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court have jurisdiction to hear the\r\n  appeal?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues the State does not have a right to appeal from a judgment in favor of a\r\n  defendant in a criminal case.Â  The State counters that it has the right to\r\n  appeal on purely legal grounds.\r\nWe have recognized\r\n  there are limited situations where the State may appeal.Â  State v. McKnight,\r\n  353 S.C. 238, 577 S.E.2d 456 (2003).Â  In State v. Holliday, 255 S.C. 142, 177 S.E.2d 541 (1970), we stated that, \r\n \r\n\r\n\tWhile a limited right of\r\n  appeal in criminal cases has been conferred upon the State by statute in a\r\n  number of jurisdictions, the extent of the right of the prosecution to appeal\r\n  in this jurisdiction has been defined by our judicial decisions.\r\n\tBased primarily upon the double\r\n  jeopardy provisions of the Constitution, we have long recognized that the State\r\n  has no right of appeal from a judgment\r\n\tof acquittal in a criminal case, unless the verdict of acquittal was\r\n  procured by the accused through fraud or collusion.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nState v. Holliday, 255 S.C. at 144-145,\r\n  177 S.E.2d at 542 (internal citations omitted).\r\nThe Holliday court noted that â€œno writ of error, appeal, or other proceeding lies on behalf\r\n  of the state to review or to set aside a verdict or a judgment of acquittal in\r\n  a criminal case, although there may have been error committed by\r\n    the court, or a perverse finding by the jury.â€Â  Id. at 145, 177 S.E.2d\r\n  at 542-543 (citation omitted).Â  These cases refusing the Stateâ€™s right of\r\n  appeal are premised upon the basic double jeopardy principle that a defendant\r\n  in a criminal prosecution is in legal jeopardy when he has been placed on trial\r\n  under a valid indictment and a competent jury has been sworn.Â  State v.\r\n    McKnight, supra.\r\nAs noted in State\r\n  v. McKnight, 353 S.C. at 239, n.2, 577 S.E.2d at 457, n.2, the State may appeal\r\n  an order quashing an indictment or the grant of a new trial after conviction if\r\n  based on an error of law.Â  However, these situations involve either a dismissal\r\n  prior to the jury being sworn or the grant of a new trial following conviction,\r\n  not an acquittal.\r\nWhether or not the\r\n  magistrate erred in his ruling of law, appellant was acquitted and is now out\r\n  of court.Â  The circuit court erred by finding the State may appeal the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s ruling.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Section\r\n  20-7-8920 was amended in June 2007.Â  The amendment does not affect the instant\r\n  case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26385","title":"In the Matter of Bobby J.

Long\r\n  and, later, as Jacobsen Pincus &amp; Long (the Firm).Â  Although Karl Jacobsen,\r\n  Monet Pincus, and respondent were all signatories on the Firmâ€™s trust account,\r\n  respondent was the primary person responsible for overseeing the Firmâ€™s trust\r\n  account and maintaining the Firmâ€™s financial records.Â  During 2003, the Firm\r\n  failed to maintain journals, ledgers, checkbook registers, and reconciliation\r\n  reports as required by Rule 417, SCACR, and failed to maintain adequate\r\n  bookkeeping or accounting procedures to accurately account for client funds.\r\nDuring\r\n  2003, the Firmâ€™s trust account was out of balance.Â  In July 2003, respondent\r\n  noticed an accounting discrepancy indicating the Firmâ€™s trust account was out\r\n  of balance.Â  He hired an accountant to audit the trust account and discovered\r\n  the account was short approximately $15,000.Â  Upon learning this, respondent\r\n  brought the trust account back into balance over a period of several months by\r\n  leaving earned fees in the trust account until the balance was restored.Â \r\n \r\nIn September\r\n  2003, respondent suffered personal problems which, at times, affected his\r\n  ability to competently and diligently represent clients.Â  During this time,\r\n  respondent occasionally ignored client files that needed attention.Â  On one\r\n  occasion, respondent failed to timely correct inaccurate information on a\r\n  document filed with the Bankruptcy Court.Â   \r\nDuring\r\n  2003, Jacobsen undertook representation of more bankruptcy clients than he\r\n  could competently and diligently handle and was repeatedly sanctioned by the Columbia\r\n  Division of the Bankruptcy Court.Â  These sanctions included reprimands and orders\r\n  to disgorge fees.Â  In November 2003, Jacobsen was suspended by consent from\r\n  practicing before the Bankruptcy Court.Â  Respondent was aware of these problems\r\n  and failed to take action to correct them.  \r\nPincusâ€™ October\r\n  2003 departure from the Firm, Jacobsenâ€™s suspension from the Bankruptcy Court,\r\n  and respondentâ€™s December 2003 relocation to Greenville left the Firm with no\r\n  attorney admitted before the Bankruptcy Court in the Columbia area although the\r\n  Firm had approximately 2000 pending bankruptcy cases.Â  Problems in the Firmâ€™s Columbia office were not replicated in the Greenville office.Â \r\n \r\nOn or\r\n  about March 15, 2004, in anticipation of Jacobsenâ€™s interim suspension and the\r\n  appointment of an attorney to protect clientsâ€™ interests pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, respondent entered into an agreement to transfer\r\n  approximately 144 of the Firmâ€™s files to a Greenville bankruptcy attorney.[1]Â  Respondent then submitted an Interim\r\n  Consent Order Substituting Counsel to United States Bankruptcy Judge John E.\r\n  Waites.Â  Within days, the other attorney withdrew his consent to transfer and\r\n  did not acquire any client files.Â  Respondent now recognizes that this effort,\r\n  while intended to benefit clients, would have violated the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct if consummated.Â  See Rule 1.6 (confidentiality of\r\n  client information) and Rule 1.16(d) (lawyer shall give client reasonable\r\n  notice of termination of representation) of Rule 407, SCACR.Â Â   \r\nOn March\r\n  17, 2004, respondent permanently closed the Firmâ€™s Greenville office.[2]Â  As of that date, the office door was\r\n  locked and the answering machine for the Greenville office advised that the\r\n  office was closed and someone would be contacting current clients to make\r\n  arrangements.Â  At that time, the Firm had approximately 400 cases pending\r\n  before the Spartanburg Division of the Bankruptcy Court, including the 144\r\n  active cases respondent had attempted to transfer to another attorney.Â \r\n  Respondent also had several court appearances scheduled for the week in which\r\n  he closed the office.Â   \r\nOn March\r\n  18, 2004, Jacobsen was placed on interim suspension and attorneys were\r\n  appointed to protect his clientsâ€™ interests (APCI). Â See In the\r\n    Matter of Jacobsen, 357 S.C. 630, 595 S.E.2d 241 (2004).Â  Respondent\r\n  represents, and ODC does not dispute, that he believed he was not entitled to\r\n  access his own files and that he was cooperating with the Court by leaving his\r\n  files for the APCI.Â  Respondent now recognizes that he should not have closed\r\n  his office in response to speculative statements about an impending suspension,\r\n  but should have continued to represent all of his clients and keep all office\r\n  resources available to them until being specifically ordered to do otherwise by\r\n  the Court or its APCI.Â  Once the APCI took possession of the files, respondent\r\n  fully cooperated and resumed active representation on those files that the APCI\r\n  determined should be returned to him.Â  Respondent has since handled those\r\n  matters without complaint and has fully cooperated with ODC in these matters.Â \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  facts, as set forth in the Addendum, are as follows.Â  On or about March 18,\r\n  2004, respondent issued an electronic check from a personal account in the\r\n  amount of $2,724.00 payable to the Firmâ€™s trust account.Â  The check was not\r\n  negotiated at the time it was written.Â  The original, non-negotiated check was\r\n  later discovered by an APCI.Â  The APCI attempted to deposit the check, but by\r\n  that time, respondentâ€™s personal account had been closed and the check was no\r\n  longer negotiable.Â   \r\nAt the\r\n  time the March 18, 2004 check was written, it had been respondentâ€™s practice to\r\n  deposit checks received from clients into the Firmâ€™s operating account and then\r\n  transfer the funds by check from the operating account into the trust account.Â \r\n  When the Firm began experiencing difficulties, respondent felt it would be\r\n  prudent to deposit the client checks into his personal account, rather than the\r\n  Firmâ€™s operating account, and then transfer those funds to the Firmâ€™s trust\r\n  account.Â  Respondentâ€™s purpose in processing client funds through the operating\r\n  account was to avoid depositing checks into the trust account that might be\r\n  returned for insufficient funds.Â   \r\nThe March\r\n  18, 2004 check at issue was written as part of this method of dealing with\r\n  client checks.Â  Respondent now recognizes that it was improper to deposit\r\n  client funds into any account other than a trust account, regardless of his\r\n  purpose.Â   \r\nNeither respondent\r\n  nor ODC are able to identify to which client or clients the $2,724.00 belongs.Â \r\n  Respondent has paid $2,724.00 to the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection.Â  These\r\n  funds shall be applied toward any claims made against respondent, Jacobsen, or\r\n  the Firm.Â   \r\n\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Â Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n    competent representation to client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall lawyer shall act\r\n    with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.15\r\n    (lawyer shall hold client property separate from lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule\r\n    5.1(a) (partner in firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure firm has in\r\n    effect measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in firm conform to\r\n    Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 5.1(c)(2) (lawyer shall be responsible for\r\n    another lawyerâ€™s violation of Rules of Professional Conduct if lawyer is\r\n    partner in firm in which other lawyer practices and knows of conduct at time\r\n    when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable\r\n    remedial action); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving\r\n    dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall\r\n    not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice). Â Respondent\r\n  further admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of the financial\r\n  recordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Finally, respondent admits his\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule\r\n  413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer\r\n  to violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this\r\n  jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement and Addendum and definitely\r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law for a thirty (30) day period.Â \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BEATTY,\r\n  JJ., concur.
