Clary, Judge\r\n Opinion No. 24849\r\n Heard September 24, 1998 - Filed November 9, 1998\r\n AFFIRMED\r\n Assistant Appellate Defender M. Anne Pearce, of S.C.\r\n Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for appellant.\r\n Attorney General Charles Molony Condon; Assistant\r\n Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka; Assistant\r\n Attorney General Robert F. Daley, Jr., and Solicitor\r\n Warren B. Giese, all of Columbia, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n MOORE, A.J.: Appellant was convicted in 1986 for the\r\nmurder of Marilee Whitten. This Court affirmed by memorandum opinion\r\nin 1987 but subsequently reversed the denial of post-conviction relief.\r\n Fossick v. State, 371 S.C. 375, 453 S.E.2d 899 (1995) (counsel ineffective\r\nfor failing to object to solicitor's argument regarding lack of remorse).\r\n Appellant was re-tried in May 1996, convicted, and sentenced to life\r\n p.3\r\n\r\nSTATE v. FOSSICK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n imprisonment. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Seventeen-year-old Marilee Whitten was last seen alive on May 11,\r\n 1985. Her partially decomposed and naked body was found in a wooded\r\narea of lower Richland County four days later. Appellant, who was\r\nMarilee's co-worker, was interviewed several times by police over the next\r\nfour months.  He ultimately confessed he killed Marilee after forcing her\r\ninto the trunk of his car, driving to a wooded area, and attempting to rape\r\nher.  Appellant subsequently led police to the murder weapon, a vase-like\r\nlamp base, that he had discarded in a nearby trash heap. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhether the trial judge erred in excluding impeachment\r\nevidence of a prior inconsistent statement by State's witness\r\nShane Parker and, if so, was the error harmless? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant and Marilee met at the animal clinic where they both\r\nworked part-time.  Shane Parker, another teenager, worked there also.\r\nShane testified for the State. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccording to Shane's testimony, he, appellant, and Marilee all left\r\nwork shortly after 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, May 11.  Shane spoke with\r\nthem briefly in the parking lot before leaving.  He was driving around a\r\nnear-by neighborhood when he saw appellant's and Marilee's cars parked\r\non the side of the road.  He spoke with appellant while Marilee remained\r\nsitting in her car.  This was around 1:30 p.m.  Shane then drove off.\r\nWhen he called Marilee's house later that afternoon, she was not at home.\r\nMarilee's parents testified she never returned home from work. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn cross-examination, defense counsel asked Shane if he had once\r\nhad a girlfriend named Michelle.  Shane acknowledged he had and that\r\nthey had double-dated with Michelle's sister and a friend named Lee\r\nKeefe.  Defense counsel then asked: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nQ: Do you recall a time back in 1989 when you got mad at\r\nMichelle and said, \"I killed that bitch.  I'll kill you, too.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.4\r\n\r\nSTATE v. FOSSICK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A: No, that was never said.\r\n Q: It was never said in the presence of your friend Lee Keeffe\r\nand other individuals?\r\n A: No, sir.\r\n Q: So you deny saying that.\r\n A: Yes, sir.\r\n On re-direct, Shane again denied he had made such a statement. After\r\nthe State rested its case, appellant proffered the testimony of Lee Keeffe\r\nto the effect that Keeffe heard Shane say to Michelle: \"I killed that bitch\r\nand I'll kill you.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The State objected on the ground that under Rule 608(b), SCRE,\r\nextrinsic evidence is not admissible to attack a witness's credibility. To\r\nthe contrary, appellant argued this evidence was admissible as extrinsic\r\nevidence of a prior inconsistent statement under Rule 613(b), SCRE. The\r\ntrial judge ruled the evidence inadmissible for impeachment under Rule\r\n608(b).1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Rule 613(b) provides in pertinent part: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(b) Extrinsic Evidence of Prior Inconsistent Statement of\r\n Witness. Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement\r\n by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is advised of\r\n the substance of the statement, the time and place it was\r\n\r\n 1As an alternative ground for excluding this evidence, the trial judge\r\n ruled it was inadmissible evidence of third-party guilt under State v. Parker,\r\n294 S.C. 465, 366 S.E.2d 10 (1988), and State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16\r\nS.E.2d 532 (1941). Appellant never challenged this ruling until oral\r\nargument before this Court. Accordingly, we decline to determine whether\r\nShane's statement should have been admitted as evidence of third-party guilt.\r\nSee State ex rel. Carter v. State, 325 S.C. 204,  481 S.E.2d 429 (1997) (Court\r\nwill not decide issue raised for first time at oral argument). Even if this\r\nevidence is inadmissible as substantive evidence, however, it may still be\r\nadmissible for impeachment purposes. See State v. Staley, 294 S.C. 451, 365\r\nS.E.2d 729 (1988) (defendant's prior convictions admissible for impeachment\r\n but not evidence of guilt).\r\n p.5\r\n\r\nSTATE v. FOSSICK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made, and is\r\n given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement. If a \r\nwitness does not admit that he has made the prior inconsistent statement,\r\n extrinsic evidence of such statement is admissible. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n (emphasis added). Since Shane denied the statement, the proffered\r\nextrinsic evidence was admissible under Rule 613(b).2 We conclude the\r\ntrial judge erred in excluding Keeffe's testimony as impeachment evidence\r\n but find the error harmless. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In determining harmless error regarding any issue of witness\r\ncredibility, we will consider the importance of the witness's testimony to\r\n the prosecution's case, whether the witness's testimony was cumulative,\r\nwhether other evidence corroborates or contradicts the witness's testimony,\r\nthe extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and the overall\r\n strength of the State's case. State v. Holmes, 320 S.C. 259, 464 S.E.2d\r\n334 (1995) (citing Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673 (1986)). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Here, the main thrust of Shane's testimony was that he left\r\nappellant and Marilee about 1:30 p.m. on the day Marilee disappeared.\r\nThis same information was admitted intoevidence as part of a statement\r\nappellant made to police months before his confession that he was with\r\nMarilee at 1:30 p.m. that day when Shane saw them on the side of the\r\nroad. Appellant's father also testified to this statement which appellant\r\nmade to police in his father's presence. Accordingly, Shane's testimony\r\nwas cumulative. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Further, Shane's testimony was relatively unimportant to the State's\r\ncase which rested on appellant's confession and the fact he led police to\r\nthe murder weapon. In addition, appellant was permitted extensive cross- \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Rule 608(b), upon which the trial judge based his exclusion of this\r\nevidence, does not apply. Rule 608(b) provides in pertinent part:\r\n (b) Specific Instance of Conduct. Specific instances of the\r\nconduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting\r\n the witness' credibility, other than conviction of crime as provided\r\nin Rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\r\n Although Rule 608 prohibits extrinsic evidence, it applies only to evidence of\r\nconduct and  not evidence of a statement. United States v. Higa, 55 F.3d 448\r\n (9th Cir. 1995).\r\n p.6\r\n\r\nSTATE v. FOSSICK \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n examination of Shane and impeached him with extrinsic evidence of\r\nconduct Shane denied. In light of all these factors, exclusion of Shane's\r\nprior inconsistent statement as impeaching evidence was harmless. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n FINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n p.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24850","title":"Davenport v.

We granted certiorari to review the Court of\r\nAppeals' opinion in Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property \r\nRegime, 325 S.C. 507, 482 S.E.2d 569 (Ct. App. 1997). We affirm as\r\nmodified. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlvin Davenport is a resident of Cotton Hope Plantation located on\r\nHilton Head Island. The plantation is organized under state law as Cotton\r\nHope Plantation Horizontal Regime (\"Cotton Hope\"). Cotton Hope\r\nis composed of ninety-six condominium units located in multiple buildings.\r\nEach building consists of three levels. The building s have three stairways\r\neach, one in the middle and two on either side. Davenport's unit is on the\r\ntop level, approximately five feet from a stairway. Davenport leases his unit\r\nfrom the owner. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCotton Hope employed Property Administrators, Incorporated (\"PAI\")\r\nto maintain the grounds at Cotton Hope Plantation, In April 1991, PAI, as\r\nCotton Hope's agent, hired Carson Landscaping Company, Inc., (\"Carson'') to\r\nperform landscaping and general maintenance work at the condominiums.\r\nCarson's duties included checking the outdoor lights and changing light bulbs\r\nas needed. The contract between Cotton Hope and Carson also required\r\nCarson to indemnify Cotton Hope for any losses resulting from Carson's\r\nnegligence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn June 1991, Davenport began reporting that the floodlights at the\r\nbottom of the stairway he used were not working. Davenport testified he\r\nmade several phone calls to PAI complaining, about the problem. Davenport\r\nnevertheless continued to use the stairway during this On the evening\r\nof August 12, 1991, Davenport fell while descending the stairway closest to\r\nhis apartment, Davenport, testified he fell after attempting to place his foot \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non what appeared to be a step but was really a shadow caused by the broken\r\nfloodlights. He admitted not using the handrail in the stairway. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDavenport sued Cotton Hope for his injuries. Cotton Hope, in turn,\r\nbrought a third-party claim against Carson for indemnification. At the close\r\nof all the evidence, the trial court directed a verdict against Davenport,\r\nfinding he had assumed the risk of injury. The trial court also held that\r\neven if assumption of risk were abrogated by the adoption of comparative\r\nnegligence, Davenport was more than fifty-percent negligent. The trial court\r\nthen directed a verdict in favor of Carson on Cotton Hope's third-party claim,\r\nfinding there was nothing for Carson to indemnify. Davenport and Cotton\r\nHope appealed the trial court's ruling. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime,\r\n325 S.C. 507, 482 S.E.2d 569, the Court of Appeals held that assumption of\r\nrisk had been subsumed by South Carolina's adoption of comparative\r\nnegligence. As such, assumption of risk was no longer a complete defense to\r\na negligence claim but, instead, was simply another factor to consider in\r\ncomparing the parties' negligence. The court ruled that the relative\r\nnegligence of Davenport and Cotton Hope turned on factual considerations\r\nwhich should have been submitted to the jury. As for Cotton Hope's cross-\r\nappeal, the court remanded the issue for jury determination. Judge Goolsby\r\ndissented, arguing assumption of risk was not subsumed by comparative\r\nnegligence because assumption of risk and contributory negligence were\r\nseparate and distinct concepts. In a separate opinion, Judge Stilwell\r\nconcurred in Judge Goolsby's dissent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Court granted Cotton Hope's petition for a writ of certiorari to\r\naddress the following issues: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(1) Is assumption of risk a doctrine which has, and should continue to\r\nmaintain, a separate, independent, and distinct identity from\r\ncontributory negligence? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(2) Can Davenport's assumption of the risk created by Cotton Hope's\r\nalleged negligence be \"compared\" with that negligence in apportioning\r\nliability under South Carolina's comparative negligence schemes? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(3) Can Cotton Hope's alleged negligence, based on objective standards, \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nbe merged with or compared to the subjective standards which form the\r\nbasis of assumption of the risk, i.e. Davenport's decision to take the\r\nalleged risk? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.10\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) Should South Carolina adopt a policy which would allow people to\r\nvolunteer to be plaintiffs by taking unnecessary risks even if created\r\nby others? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(5) Did Davenport know, understand, and appreciate the alleged risk\r\nhe undertook such that he assumed the risk as a matter of law and\r\nshould be barred from recovery? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(6) Did Davenport establish any duty breached by Cotton Hope? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(7) Did Davenport's negligence exceed that of Cotton Hope? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(8) Even if assumption of risk is subsumed, did the Court of Appeals\r\nerr in holding that under our comparative negligence system a trial\r\ncourt cannot direct a verdict for the defendant? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(9) Should the trial court's directed verdict be upheld on the basis that\r\nthe broken light was not the proximate cause of Davenport's injury? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(10) If it is determined that assumption of risk is subsumed by\r\ncomparative negligence, should such a ruling be applied prospectively\r\nonly? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA. ASSUMPTION OF RISK IN A COMPARATIVE FAULT SYSTEM (Issues 1-5) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe threshold question we must answer is whether assumption of risk\r\nsurvives as a complete bar to recovery under South Carolina's comparative\r\nnegligence system. In Nelson v. Concrete Supply Company 303 S.C. 243, 399\r\nS.E.2d 783 (1991), we adopted a modified version of comparative negligence.\r\nUnder this system, \"[f]or all causes of action arising on or after July 1, 1991,\r\na plaintiff in a negligence action may recover damages if his or her\r\nnegligence is not greater than that of the defendant.'' Nelson, 303 S.C. at\r\n245, 399 S.E.2d at 784. Nelson made clear that a plaintiff's contributory\r\nnegligence would no longer bar recovery unless such negligence exceeded that\r\nof the defendant. Not so clear was what would become of the defense of\r\nassumption of risk. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina first adopted assumption of risk within the employment \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.11\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontext.1  See, e.g., Hooper v. Columbia &amp; Greenville R. R. Co., 21 S.C. 541,\r\n547 (1884). The doctrine rested in contract and was founded upon a theory\r\nof consent whereby the servant assumed those risks of employment that he\r\nknew of or should have known about. Stogner v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific\r\nTea Co., 184 S.C. 406, 192 S.E. 406 (1937). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Court ultimately extended the defense to negligence cases outside\r\nthe traditional master-servant context. See, e.g., Smith v. Edwards, 186 S.C.\r\n186, 195 S.E. 236 (1938). In Smith, The plaintiff died as a result of burns\r\nshe suffered while receiving a \"permanent wave\" at a beauty shop. The\r\ndefendant argued that the plaintiff had diabetes which made her peculiarly\r\nsusceptible to the injuries, and consequently, she assumed the risk of injury.\r\nThe plaintiff argued that under these facts, assumption of risk was not\r\navailable as an affirmative defense. This Court disagreed, stating, \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1The modern notion of assumption of risk has its roots in the Latin\r\nmaxim volenti non fit injuria (\"to one who is willing, no harm is done\") which\r\nwas originally applied in Roman Law by validating the process in which a\r\nfree citizen sold himself into slavery. See Jane P. North, Employees'\r\n Assumption of Risk: Real or Illusory Choice?, 52 Tenn. L. Rev. 35 (1984); 65A\r\nC.J.S. Negligence Â§ 174(1) at 287 (1966). In the nineteenth century,\r\nassumption of risk became entrenched in the English common law primarily\r\nas a result of Lord Abinger's opinion in Priestly v. Fowler, 3 M. &amp; W. 1, 150\r\nEng.Rep. 1030 (Ex. 1837). In Priestly, the plaintiff, a servant of the\r\ndefendant, was injured after being thrown to the ground when a \"van\"\r\noverloaded by another servant broke down. Lord Abinger denied recovery,\r\nstating, \"the plaintiff must have known as well as his master, and probably\r\nbetter, whether the van was sufficient, whether it was overloaded, and\r\nwhether it was likely to carry him safely.\" 150 Eng.Rep. at 1033. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe doctrine of assumption of risk, grounded in laissez-faire economics,\r\nflourished during the Industrial Revolution. See North, 52 Tenn. L. Rev. 35.\r\nApplication of the defense was based upon the social justification that\r\nemployers in a rapidly industrializing society had to be free to pursue their\r\neconomic goals. Id. at 40. In line with this philosophy, assumption of risk\r\nmade its way into the American common law. See Tuttle v. Detroit, Grand\r\nHaven &amp; Milwaukee Ry., 122 U.S. 189, 196, 7 S. Ct. 1166. 1169, 30 L. Ed.\r\n1114 (1886)(\"[assumption of risk] is a rule of public policy, inasmuch as an\r\nopposite doctrine would not only subject employers to unreasonable and often\r\nruinous responsibilities, thereby embarrassing all branches of business . . .\r\n.\"). Today, because of workmen's compensation laws, the defense is applied\r\nless often in its traditional context of work-related injuries. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"[assumption of risk] applies to any case . . . where the facts proved show\r\nthat the person against whom the doctrine of assumption of risk is pleaded\r\nknew of the danger, appreciated it, and acquiesced therein.\" Smith, 186 S.C.\r\nat 191, 195 S.E. at 238. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCurrently in South Carolina, there are four requirements to\r\nestablishing the defense of assumption of risk: (1) the plaintiff must have\r\nknowledge of the facts constituting a dangerous condition; (2) the plaintiff\r\nmust know the condition is dangerous; (3) the plaintiff must appreciate\r\nthe nature and extent of the danger; and (4) the plaintiff must voluntarily expose\r\nhimself to the danger. Senn v. Sun Printing Co., 295 S.C. 169, 367 S.E.2d\r\n456 (Ct. App. 1988). \"The doctrine is predicated on the factual situation of\r\na defendant's acts alone creating the danger and causing the accident, with\r\nthe plaintiff's act being that of voluntarily exposing himself to such an\r\nobvious danger with appreciation thereof which resulted in the injury.\" Id.\r\nat 173, 367 S.E.2d at 458. Assumption of risk may be implied from the\r\nplaintiffs conduct. Hoeffner v. The Citadel, 311 S.C. 361, 492 S.E.2d 190\r\n(1993). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs noted by the Court of Appeals, an overwhelming majority of\r\njurisdictions that have adopted some form of comparative negligence have\r\nessentially abolished assumption of risk as an absolute bar to recovery.\r\nDavenport, 325 S.C. at 514 n. 4, 482 S.E.2d at 573 n. 4; see also F. Patrick\r\nHubbard &amp; Robert L. Felix, Comparative Negligence in South Carolina:\r\nImplementing Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 43 S.C. L. Rev. 273, 332 (1992);\r\nJean W. Sexton, Tort Law -- Assumption of Risk and Pennsylvania's\r\nComparative Negligence Statute -- Howell v. Clyde, 620 A.2d 1107 (Pa.1993),\r\n67 Temp. L. Rev. 903, 910-11 (1994). In analyzing the continuing viability\r\nof assumption of risk in a comparative negligence system, many courts\r\ndistinguish between \"express\" assumption of risk and \"implied\" assumption\r\nof risk. See W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts,\r\nÂ§ 68 at 496 (5th ed. 1984). Implied assumption of risk is further divided into\r\nthe categories of \"primary\" and \"secondary\" implied assumption of risk. Id.\r\nWe will discuss each of these concepts below. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nExpress assumption of risk applies when the parties expressly agree in\r\nadvance, either in writing or orally that the plaintiff will relieve the\r\ndefendant of his or her legal duty toward the plaintiff. See Restatement\r\n(Second) of Torts Â§ 496B (1965), Prosser and Keeton, Â§ 68 at 496; Victor E.\r\nSchwartz, Comparative Negligence, Â§ 9.2 (3d ed. 1994). Thus, being under\r\nno legal duty, the defendant cannot be charged with negligence. Prosser and\r\nKeeton, Â§ 68 at 481. Even in those comparative fault jurisdictions that have \r\n  \r\np.13 \r\n  \r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabrogated assumption of risk, the rule remains that express assumption of\r\nrisk continues as an absolute defense in an action for negligence.2 The\r\nreason for this is that express assumption of risk sounds in contract, not tort,\r\nand is based upon an express manifestation of consent. See, e.g., Salinas v.\r\nViestra, 695 P.2d 369, 375 (Idaho 1985); Prosser and Keeton, Â§ 68 at 496. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTo avoid confusion, at least one court has suggested replacing the term\r\n\"express\" assumption of risk with \"consent.\" Salinas, 695 P.2d at 375. In\r\nfact, this Court has analyzed such cases in terms of exculpatory contracts.\r\nHuckaby v. Confederate Motor Speedway, Inc., 276 S.C. 629, 281 S.E.2d 223\r\n(1981). In Huckaby, a race spectator signed a waiver and release form before\r\nsuffering an injury at a race track. This Court barred the spectator's suit\r\nagainst the track owner, stating, \"'If a prospective participant wishes to place\r\nhimself in the competition sufficiently to voluntarily agree that he will not\r\nhold the organizer or sponsor of the event liable for injuries, the courts\r\nshould enforce such an agreement.\"' Id. at 631, 281 S.E.2d at 224 (citation\r\nomitted). As an additional sustaining ground, the Huckaby Court concluded\r\nthat the spectator's suit was barred by assumption of risk. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nExpress assumption of risk is contrasted with implied assumption of\r\nrisk which arises when the plaintiff implicitly, rather than expressly, assumes\r\nknown risks. As noted above, implied assumption of risk is characterized as\r\neither primary or secondary. Primary implied assumption of risk arises when\r\nthe plaintiff impliedly assumes those risks that are inherent in a particular \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 See Knight v. Jewett, 834 P.2d 696 (Cal. 1992); Fell v.

COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivity. See, e.g., Fortier v. Los Rios Community College Dist., 45 Cal. App.\r\n4th 430 (1996)(student injured in a collision during football drill); Swagger\r\nv. City of Crystal, 379 N.W.2d 183 (Minn. App. 1985)(injured while watching\r\nsoftball game). Primary implied assumption of risk is not a true affirmative\r\ndefense, but instead goes to the initial determination of whether the\r\ndefendant's legal duty encompasses the risk encountered by the plaintiff.\r\nE.g., Perez v. McConkey, 872 S.W.2d 897 (Tenn. 1994); Scott v. Pacific West\r\nMountain Resort, 834 P.2d 6 (Wash. 1992); see also Prosser and Keeton, Â§ 68\r\nat 496. In Perez, the Tennessee Supreme Court summarized the doctrine in\r\nthe following way: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn its primary sense, implied assumption of risk focuses not on\r\nthe plaintiff's conduct in assuming the risk, but on the\r\ndefendant's general duty of care. . . . Clearly, primary implied\r\nassumption of risk is but another way of stating the conclusion\r\nthat a plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case [of\r\nnegligence] by failing to establish that a duty exists. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n872 S.W.2d at 902. In this sense, primary implied assumption of risk is\r\nsimply a part of the initial negligence analysis.3 Blackburn v. Dorta, 348\r\nSo.2d 287, 291 (Fla. 1977). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 In South Carolina, there are no cases that apply the term \"primary\r\nimplied\" assumption of risk. However, in Gunther v. Charlotte Baseball, Inc.,\r\n854 F.Supp. 424 (D.S.C. 1994), the federal district court was faced with the\r\nquestion of whether a spectator at a baseball game was barred, under South\r\nCarolina law, from suing the stadium owner for injuries sustained after being\r\nstruck by a foul ball. The court noted that the issue was one of first\r\nimpression in South Carolina. The court proceeded to bar the plaintiffs suit,\r\nstating, \"the vast majority of jurisdictions recognize this hazard [being struck\r\nby a foul ball] to be a risk that is assumed by the spectators because it\r\nremains after due care has been exercised (erecting a screen), and it is not\r\nthe result of negligence by the ball club.\" Gunther, 8.54 F.Supp. at 428\r\n(citing Anderson v. Kansas City Baseball Club, 231 S.W.2d 170 (Mo. 1950)).\r\nThe court's statement, in this regard, was an implicit application of the\r\ndoctrine of primary implied assumption of risk -- the defendant's duty of care\r\ndid not encompass the risk involved, and as such, there was no prima facie\r\ncase of negligence. Nevertheless the court relied upon a general theory of\r\nassumption of risk since this issue had not yet been directly addressed by a\r\nSouth Carolina court. Id. In doing so, the court cited a variety of South\r\nCarolina cases including Huckaby v. Confederate Motor Speedway, Inc., 276\r\nS.C. 629, 281 S.E.2d 223 (an express assumption of risk case). Id. at 429. \r\n  \r\np.15\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary implied assumption of risk, on the other hand, arises when\r\nthe plaintiff knowingly encounters a risk created by the defendant's\r\nnegligence. Carol A. Mutter, Moving to Comparative Negligence in an Era \r\nof Tort Reform, 57 Tenn. L. Rev. 199, 286 (1990). It is a true defense\r\nbecause it is asserted only after the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case\r\nof negligence against the defendant. Secondary implied assumption of risk\r\nmay involve either reasonable or unreasonable conduct on the part of the\r\nplaintiff. In Litchfield Company of South Carolina, Inc. v. Sur-Tech, Inc., 289\r\nS.C. 247, 249, 345 S.E.2d 765, 766 (Ct. App. 1986), the Court of Appeals\r\nillustrated secondary \"unreasonable\" implied assumption of risk: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[T]he conduct of a plaintiff in assuming a risk may itself be\r\nunreasonable and thus negligent because the risk he assumes is\r\nout of all proportion to the advantage which he is seeking to\r\ngain. For example, if a plaintiff dashed into a fire in order to\r\nsave his hat, it might well be argued that he both assumed the\r\nrisk of being injured and that he acted unreasonably. In such \r\ncases, a defendant can maintain both defenses. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(emphasis added).4 Since express and primary implied assumption of risk are\r\ncompatible with comparative negligence, we will refer to secondary implied\r\nassumption of risk simply as \"assumption of risk.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs alluded to in Litchfield, supra, assumption of risk and contributory\r\nnegligence have historically been recognized as separate defenses in South\r\nCarolina. See Ruth v. Lane, 254 S.C. 431, 175 S.E.2d 820 (1970)(rejecting\r\nthe argument that the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of\r\nrisk may be merged into the same defense and treated interchangeably);\r\nCooper v. Mayes, 234 S.C. 491, 496, 109 S.E.2d 12, 15 (1959) (\"Attempt in\r\nsuch cases to interrelate assumption of risk and contributory negligence is\r\nmore academic than practical, and sometimes loses sight of the fact that the\r\ndifference between the two is fundamental and not merely of degree.\"); Broom\r\nv. Southeastern Highway Contracting, Company, Inc., 291 S.C. 93, 352 S.E.2d\r\n302 (Ct. App. 1986)(holding that unlike contributory negligence, which is\r\nbased on carelessness and inadvertence, assumption of risk requires\r\ndeliberate and voluntary choice to assume a known risk). However, other \r\n  \r\n\r\n4Reasonable implied assumption of risk exists when the plaintiff is\r\naware of a risk negligently created by the defendant but, nonetheless,\r\nvoluntarily proceeds to encounter the risk; when weighed against the risk of\r\ninjury, the plaintiff's action is reasonable. See Jean W. Sexton, 6-1 Temp. L. Rev. 903. \r\n  \r\np.16\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourts have found assumption of risk functionally indistinguishable from\r\ncontributory negligence and consequently abolished assumption of risk as a\r\ncomplete defense. See Hubbard and Felix, 43 S.C. L. Rev. at 290; Carol A.\r\nMutter, 57 Tenn. L. Rev. at 286. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTo date, the only comparative fault jurisdictions that have retained\r\nassumption of risk as an absolute defense are Georgia,5 Mississippi,6\r\nNebraska,7 Rhode Island,8 and South Dakota.9 See Henry Woods and Beth\r\nDeere, Comparative Fault, Â§ 6:6 (3d ed. 1996); Schwartz, Â§ 9.3. Only the\r\nRhode Island Supreme Court has provided a detailed discussion of why it\r\nbelieves the common law form of assumption of risk should survive under\r\ncomparative negligence. See Schwartz, Â§ 9.3. In Kennedy v. Providence\r\n Hockey Club, Inc., 376 A.2d 329 (R.I. 1977), the Rhode Island Supreme Court\r\ndistinguished between assumption of risk and contributory negligence\r\nemphasizing the former was measured by a subjective standard while the\r\nlatter was based on an objective, reasonable person standard. The court\r\nfurther noted that it had in the past limited the application of assumption\r\nof risk to those situations where the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the\r\nhazard. The court then rejected the premise that assumption of risk and\r\ncontributory negligence overlap: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[C]ontributory negligence and assumption of the risk do not\r\noverlap; the key difference is, of course, the exercise of one's free\r\nwill in encountering the risk. Negligence analysis, couched in\r\nreasonable hypotheses, has no place in the assumption of the risk\r\nframework. When one acts knowingly, it is immaterial whether\r\nhe acts reasonably. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Kennedy, 376 A.2d at 333. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRhode Island's conclusions are in sharp contrast with the West Virginia\r\nSupreme Court's opinion in King v. Kayak Manufacturing Corp., 387 S.E.2d \r\n  \r\n\r\n5 Harris v. Star Service &amp; Petroleum Co., 318 S.E.2d 239 (Ga. 1984).\r\n6 Singleton v. Wiley, 372 So.2d 272 (Miss. 1979).\r\n7 Fritchley v. Love-Courson Drilling Co., 129 N.W.2d 515 (Neb. 1964).\r\n8 Kennedy v. Providence Hockey Club, Inc., 316 A.2d 329 (R.I. 1977).\r\n9 Bartlett v. Gregg 92 N.W.2d 654 (S.D. 1958). \r\n  \r\np.17\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n511 (W.Va. 1989). Like Rhode Island, the West Virginia Supreme Court in\r\nKing recognized that assumption of risk was conceptually distinct from\r\n contributory negligence.  The court specifically noted that West Virginia's\r\n doctrine of assumption of risk required actual knowledge of the dangerous\r\ncondition, which conformed with the general rule elsewhere in the country.\r\n King, 387 S.E.2d at 516. In fact, the court cited Rhode Island's decision in\r\n Kennedy as evidence of this general rule. Id. at n.9. Nevertheless, the West\r\nVirginia court concluded that the absolute defense of assumption of risk was\r\nincompatible with its comparative fault system.10 The court therefore adopted\r\n a comparative assumption of risk rule, stating, \"a plaintiff is not barred from\r\nrecovery by the doctrine of assumption of risk unless his degree of fault\r\narising therefrom equals or exceeds the combined fault or negligence of the\r\n other parties to the accident.\" King, 387 S.E.2d at 517.11 The court\r\nexplained that the absolute defense of assumption of risk was as repugnant\r\n to its fault system as the common law rule of contributory negligence. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA comparison between the approaches in West Virginia and Rhode\r\n Island is informative. Both jurisdictions recognize that assumption of risk is\r\nconceptually distinct from contributory negligence. However, Rhode Island\r\n focuses on the objective/subjective distinction between the two defenses and,\r\n therefore, retains assumption of risk as a complete bar to recovery. On the\r\n other hand, West Virginia emphasizes that the main purpose of its\r\n comparative negligence system is to apportion fault. Thus, West Virginia\r\nrejects assumption of risk as a total bar to recovery and only allows a jury\r\n to consider the plaintiff's negligence in assuming the risk. If the plaintiff's\r\n total negligence exceeds or equals that of the defendant, only then is the \r\n  \r\n\r\n10 In Bradley, v. Appalachian Power Co., 256 S.E.2d 879 W.Va 1979),\r\nWest Virginia adopted a \"less than or equal to\" comparative negligence\r\nsystem whereby a plaintiff is barred from recovery only if his negligence is\r\n equal to or greater than the defendant's negligence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n11The court offered the following Jury instruction: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUnder our law, the plaintiff can be guilty of assumption of risk\r\nand still be entitled to recover damages from the defendant(s) so\r\nlong as the plaintiff's fault from assumption of risk does not\r\nequal or exceed the combined negligence of the other parties\r\nwhose negligence contributed to the accident. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nKing, 387 S.E.2d at 517 n. 17. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.18\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaintiff completely barred from recovery. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLike Rhode Island and West Virginia, South Carolina has historically\r\nmaintained a distinction between assumption of risk and contributory\r\nnegligence, even when the two doctrines appear to overlap. See Litchfield,\r\n289 S.C. 247, 345 S.E.2d 765.  Thus, the pertinent question is whether a\r\nplaintiff should be completely barred from recovery when he voluntarily\r\nassumes a known risk, regardless of whether his assumption of that risk was\r\nreasonable or unreasonable. Upon considering the purpose of our\r\ncomparative fault system, we conclude that West Virginia's approach is the\r\nmost persuasive model. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Nelson, we adopted Chief Judge Sanders's analysis of comparative\r\nnegligence as stated in Langley v. Boyter, 284 S.C. 162, 32.5 S.E.2d 550 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1984) opinion quashed on procedural grounds by 286 S.C. 85, 332 S.E.2d\r\n100 (1985). In Langley, Judge Sanders provided the following justification\r\nfor adopting a comparative negligence system: \"It is contrary to the basic\r\npremise of our fault system to allow a defendant, who is at fault in causing\r\nan accident, to escape bearing any of its cost, while requiring a plaintiff, who\r\nis no more than equally at fault or even less at fault, to bear all of its costs.\"\r\n Langley, 284 S.C. at 183, 325 S.E.2d at 562. By contrast, the main reason\r\nfor having the defense of assumption of risk is not to determine fault, but to\r\n prevent a person who knowingly and voluntarily incurs a risk of harm from\r\n holding another person liable. See Wallace v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., 300 S.C.\r\n518, 389 S.E.2d 155 (Ct. App. 1989). Cotton Hope argues that the\r\njustification behind assumption of risk is not in conflict with South Carolina's\r\ncomparative fault system. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs stated by Judge Sanders, it is contrary to the premise of our\r\ncomparative fault system to require a plaintiff, who is fifty-percent or less at\r\nfault, to bear all of the costs of the injury. In accord with this logic, the\r\ndefendant's fault in causing an accident is not diminished solely because the\r\nplaintiff knowingly assumes a risk. If assumption of risk is retained in its\r\ncurrent common law form, a plaintiff would be completely barred from\r\nrecovery even  if his conduct is reasonable or only slightly unreasonable. In\r\nour comparative fault system, it would be incongruous to absolve the\r\ndefendant of all liability based only on whether the plaintiff assumed the risk\r\n of injury.  Comparative negligence by definition seeks to assess and compare\r\n the negligence of both the plaintiff and defendant. This goal would clearly \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.19\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe thwarted by adhering to the common law defense of assumption of risk.12 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOur conclusion that the absolute defense of assumption of risk is\r\ninconsistent with South Carolina's comparative negligence system is\r\n buttressed by our recent opinion in Spahn v. Town of Port Royal, 330 S.C.\r\n168, 499 S.E.2d 205 (1998). In Spahn, we observed that South Carolina had\r\n historically treated the doctrine of last clear chance as separate and distinct\r\n from the doctrine of contributory negligence. Nevertheless, we held that last\r\n clear chance had been subsumed by our adoption of comparative negligence\r\n in Nelson. We stated that the \"all or nothing\" effect of last clear chance, in\r\nrelieving the plaintiff of liability, was inconsistent with the purpose and\r\n policy behind our adoption of comparative negligence. In support of this\r\n position, we cited Laws v. Webb, 658 A.2d 1000 (Del. 1995)(a doctrine that\r\nassigns sole liability to one party regardless of the amount of fault simply\r\ncannot survive under a system of comparative negligence). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBased on the above discussion, we answer the first five issues presented\r\nin this appeal in the following manner: (1) although the absolute defense of\r\nassumption of risk has historically been treated as a separate defense from\r\ncontributory negligence, it is incompatible with our comparative fault system;\r\n(2) a plaintiff's conduct in assuming a risk can be compared with the\r\ndefendant's negligence; (3) a plaintiff's conduct in assuming the risk can be\r\nmade a part our comparative fault system; (4) by abolishing assumption of\r\nrisk as an absolute bar to recovery, South Carolina will not be adopting a\r\npolicy that would encourage people to take unnecessary risks; and (5) even\r\n if Davenport assumed the risk of injury, he will not be barred from recovery\r\n unless his negligence exceeds the defendant's negligence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe therefore hold that a plaintiff is not barred from recovery by the\r\ndoctrine of assumption of risk unless the degree of fault arising therefrom is\r\ngreater than the negligence of the defendant. To the extent that any prior\r\nSouth Carolina cases are inconsistent with this approach, they are overruled.\r\nExpress and primary implied assumption of risk remain unaffected by our\r\ndecision. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nB. RETROACTIVE/PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF NEW RULE (Issue 10) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCotton Hope argues that if assumption of risk, is abolished as an \"all\r\n or nothing\" defense, such action should be applied prospectively only. We \r\n  \r\n\r\n12 The Ohio Supreme Court used a similar analysis in Anderson v.\r\nCeccardi, 415 N.E.2d 780, 783 (Ohio 1983). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.20\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\" [T]he general rule regarding retroactive application of judicial decisions\r\nis that decisions creating new substantive rights have prospective effect only,\r\nwhereas decisions creating new remedies to vindicate existing rights are\r\napplied retrospectively.  Prospective application is required when liability is\r\n created where formerly none existed.\" Toth v. Square D Co., 298 S.C. 6, 8,\r\n 377 S.E.2d 584, 585 (1989)(citations omitted); see also Hardaway v. Lexington\r\n County, 314 S.C. 22, 443 S.E.2d 569 (1994). In the instant case, Davenport\r\n may still be barred from recovery if his negligence exceeds Cotton Hope's\r\nnegligence. Thus, his conduct in assuming the risk remains part of the\r\ncomparative negligence analysis. Moreover, it would not be unfair or\r\n inappropriate to apply such a ruling retrospectively because defendants do\r\nnot rely upon the doctrine of assumption of risk when they commit negligent\r\nacts. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe therefore apply our present ruling to the instant case and to all\r\ncauses of action that arise or accrue after the date of this opinion. Thus,\r\nexcept for this case, if a cause of action arose or accrued prior to our decision\r\ntoday, it will be governed by the common law form of assumption of risk, if\r\napplicable, as it existed under South Carolina case law before this opinion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nC. APPLICATION OF NEW RULE TO INSTANT CASE (Issues 6-9) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCotton Hope argues that even if this Court abrogates assumption of\r\nrisk as a complete defense, the trial court's directed verdict should be upheld\r\nbased on the following arguments: (1) as a matter of law, Cotton Hope did\r\nnot breach any duty owed to Davenport; (2) the broken light was not a\r\nproximate cause of Davenport's injury; and (3) as a matter of law,\r\nDavenport's negligence exceeded that of Cotton Hope. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUpon review of an order granting a motion for directed verdict, the\r\nevidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most\r\nfavorable to the non-moving party. If only one inference can be drawn from\r\nthe evidence, the motion must be granted. Adams v. Creel, 320 S.C. 274, 465\r\nS.E.2d 84 (1995); Brady Dev. Co., Inc. v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 312\r\nS.C. 73, 439 S.E.2d 266 (1993). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCotton Hope argues that it did not breach any duty owed to Davenport.\r\nSpecifically, Cotton Hope contends that it only had a duty to warn Davenport\r\nof concealed dangerous conditions, and since Davenport knew of the danger,\r\nCotton Hope was relieved of its duty to warn.  In Murphy v. Yacht Cove \r\n  \r\np.21\r\n\r\nDAVENPORT v. COTTON HOPE PLANTATION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHomeowners Association, 289 S.C. 367, 345 S.E.2d 709 (1986), we held that\r\na member of a condominium association, established pursuant to the\r\nHorizontal Property Act, may bring a tort action against the association for\r\nfailing to properly maintain the common elements. Pursuant to the South\r\nCarolina Horizontal Property Act, \"general common elements\" include\r\nstairways.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-20(f)(2) (1991). Section 27-31-120 further\r\nprovides that \"[a]ny conveyance or lease of an individual apartment is\r\ndeemed to also convey or lease the undivided interest of the owner in the\r\ncommon elements, both general and limited, appertaining to the apartment\r\nwithout specifically or particularly referring to same.\" Thus, Cotton Hope\r\nowed a duty to Davenport, the lessee, to properly maintain the stairway. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCotton Hope next argues that the broken light was not the proximate\r\ncause of Davenport's injury. Cotton Hope contends that the broken light\r\ncould not have caused the injury because the light, if working, would have\r\nbeen blocked by Davenport's body anyway. We find this to be a fact question\r\nfor jury determination. Oliver v. South Carolina Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub.\r\nTransp., 309 S.C. 313, 422 S.E.2d 128 (1992)(proximate causation is\r\nordinarily a fact question for the jury). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCotton Hope finally argues that we should affirm the trial court's ruling\r\nthat, as a matter of law, Davenport was more than fifty-percent negligent.\r\nThe trial court based its ruling on the fact that Davenport knew of the\r\ndanger weeks before his accident, and he had a safe, alternate route.\r\nHowever, there was also evidence suggesting Cotton Hope was negligent in\r\nfailing to properly maintain the lighting in the exterior stairway. In the light\r\nmost favorable to Davenport, it could be reasonably concluded that\r\nDavenport's negligence in proceeding down the stairway did not exceed\r\nCotton Hope's negligence. Thus, it is properly submitted for jury\r\ndetermination. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the Court of Appeals' decision is AFFIRMED AS\r\nMODIFIED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney\r\nGeneral Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney\r\n General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia, and\r\nSolicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for\r\n respondent.\r\n PER CURIAM: Appellant Alexander Santee Johnson was convicted of\r\nmurder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The sole issue on appeal is\r\nwhether Johnson was entitled to a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter.\r\nWe hold that he was and, accordingly, we reverse.\r\n FACTS \r\n  \r\np.23\r\n\r\nSTATE v. JOHNSON\r\n The facts, taken in the light most favorable to Johnson, indicate that\r\nin the early morning hours of December 12, 1995, Johnson was \"hanging out\"\r\nwith Frank Moore, Travis Croft, and the victim, Curt Kirksey. According to\r\nwitnesses, Kirksey had taken the keys to Johnson's vehicle and wouldn't give\r\nthem back to him. Kirksey then went into his house, and Johnson left.\r\nMoore and Croft were still outside Kirksey's house 15-20 minutes later when\r\nJohnson returned. Kirksey's live-in girlfriend, Lola Smith, testified Johnson\r\nknocked on their door at approximately 2:00AM and asked to speak to\r\nKirksey. Kirksey came to the door and he and Johnson \"had words.\"\r\nKirksey then went outside and \"sort of pushed [Johnson] off the porch.\"\r\nAccording to one witness, Kirksey was the first one to throw a punch.\r\nAnother witness testified that \"[Kirksey] was getting the best of [Johnson].\"\r\nSeveral witnesses testified that, during the fight, Johnson took out a gun and\r\nshot Kirksey several times; Kirksey died a short time later.\r\n ISSUE1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n 1 At oral argument before this Court, the state maintained the issue\r\nraised by Johnson is procedurally barred under our opinion in State v. \r\nWhipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1996). We disagree and take this\r\nopportunity to clarify Whipple.\r\n In Whipple, supra, the defendant asserted error in the trial court's\r\nfailure to instruct the jury concerning his thirty year parole eligibility, or\r\nalternatively, in the failure to give a \"plain and ordinary meaning\" charge\r\npursuant to State v. Norris, 285 S.C. 86, 328 S.E.2d 339 (1985). A majority\r\nof this Court found the issue procedurally barred stating \"Whipple's failure\r\nto object to the charge as given, or to request an additional charge when\r\ngiven an opportunity to do so constitutes a waiver of his right to complain on\r\nappeal.\" 476 S.E.2d at 688. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Finney stated\r\nhe \"would hold that where a defendant's request for a jury charge is denied\r\nin a pre-charge conference, he need not renew that request after the charge\r\nis omitted from the jury instructions in order to preserve the issue for\r\nappellate review.\" 476 S.E.2d at 690. Accordingly, combining the majority's\r\nholding with the dissent, Whipple is now being read to hold that where a\r\nparty's jury charge objections or requests are denied on-the-record after a pre-\r\ncharge conference, the party must renew those objections or requests\r\nsubsequent to the courts instructions to the jury.  The majority opinion in\r\nWhipple, however, did not establish such a rule. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In Whipple, there was no on-the-record discussion regarding whether\r\nthe judge would give Whipple's requests to charge.  The only discussion at\r\np.24\r\n\r\nSTATE v. JOHNSON\r\n Did the court err in refusing Johnson's request to charge the law\r\nof voluntary manslaughter?\r\n DISCUSSION\r\n A trial court should refuse to charge a lesser-included offense only\r\nwhere there is no evidence the defendant committed the lesser rather than\r\nthe greater offense. State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994). In\r\ndetermining whether the evidence requires a charge on voluntary\r\nmanslaughter, this Court must view the facts in a light most favorable to the\r\ndefendant. State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 474 S.E.2d 430 (1996). To warrant\r\na court's eliminating the offense of manslaughter, it should very clearly\r\nappear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce the crime from\r\n murder to manslaughter. State v. Lowery , 315 S.C. 396, 434 S.E.2d 272 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nall was during voir dire at the guilt phase. Whipple asked the court to voir\r\ndire the jury concerning their understanding of life imprisonment, and\r\ncounsel advised the court he would request a parole eligibility instruction if\r\nthe trial reached a sentencing phase. There was absolutely no further\r\ndiscussion of such a charge in either the guilt or sentencing phase.\r\nThereafter, although Whipple submitted written requests to charge at\r\nsentencing, there was no colloquy as to whether the court would give the\r\nrequested charges, nor did Whipple object to the judge's charge as given after\r\nbeing given an opportunity to do so. Unlike the present case, the brief\r\ncolloquy in Whipple is simply not an on-the-record ruling as to whether the\r\ncourt would give a certain charge. Accordingly, we adhere to our ruling that\r\nWhipple failed to preserve the issue by failing to object to the judge's charge\r\nas given. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n However, we clarify that neither our opinion in Whipple, nor Rule\r\n20(b), SCRCrimP (notwithstanding requests to charge, party must object to\r\nthe giving or failure to give an instruction before the jury retires .... Failure to\r\ndo so constitutes a waiver of objection) have altered the long-standing rule\r\nthat where a party requests a jury charge and, after opportunity for\r\ndiscussion, the trial judge declines the charge, it is unnecessary, to preserve\r\nthe point on appeal, to renew the request at conclusion of the court's\r\ninstructions. Rogers v. Florence Printing Co., 233 S.C. 567, 106 S.E.2d 258\r\n(1958); State v. Grant, 275 S.C. 404, 272 S.E.2d 169 (1980). Unlike Whipple,\r\nJohnson's request to charge was denied on-the- record after an opportunity for\r\ndiscussion. Accordingly, the issue is preserved for review, and Johnson was\r\nnot required to renew his request at the conclusion of the charge.\r\n p.25\r\n\r\nSTATE v. JOHNSON \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n (1993). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in\r\nsudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation. Lowery, supra.\r\nAlthough words alone may not constitute sufficient legal provocation, words\r\naccompanied by some overt, threatening act may be sufficient. Id. In Lowery ,\r\nwe held the defendant was entitled to a charge on voluntary manslaughter\r\nwhere the defendant and victim were in a heated argument and \"the\r\ndecedent was about to initiate a physical encounter\" when the shooting\r\noccurred. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Here, Johnson and the victim had \"had words\" and were engaged in a\r\nfight at the time the shooting occurred. Under Lowry, it is patent Johnson\r\n was entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge. Accordingly, the judgment\r\n below is \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np. 26 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24852","title":"State v.

Brown Amusement Co., Inc., \r\n326 S.C. 453, 485 S.E.2d 103 (Ct. App. 1997).  We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGladys Mullinax, respondent, filed this lawsuit to recover her\r\nhusband's gambling losses pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.Â§ 32-1-20 (1991). Mr.\r\nMullinax sustained these losses during 1991 to 1993 while playing video\r\npoker on petitioners' machines. Mr. Mullinax contacted an attorney and was\r\ntold that he could sue for his losses from the preceding three months or\r\nsomeone else could sue for three times the amount of his losses from the\r\npreceding three years. Together, Mr. and Mrs. Mullinax visited the attorney\r\nand Mr. Mullinax paid the attorney. Mr. Mullinax continued to play the\r\nvideo poker machines even after visiting the attorney. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the conclusion of respondent's case, petitioners moved for a\r\ndirected verdict on the ground that respondent and her husband acted in\r\ncovin and collusion in bringing the lawsuit. The trial judge granted\r\npetitioners' motion for directed verdict on the ground that the suit was\r\nrespondent's in name only and the suit was collusive as a matter of law. The\r\nCourt of Appeals reversed finding the evidence does not conclusively show\r\nthat Mr. Mullinax intentionally refrained from bringing the action in his own\r\nname so that respondent could sue for three times the amount. Petitioners\r\nJ. M. Brown Amusement Co., Inc. (Brown) and Petroleum Distributors, Inc.\r\npetitioned for review by this Court. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn ruling on directed verdict motions, the trial court must view\r\nthe evidence and all inferences which may reasonably be drawn therefrom in\r\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party. Fleming v. Borden, Inc.,\r\n316 S.C. 452, 450 S.E.2d 589 (1994). If more than one reasonable inference\r\ncan be drawn from the evidence, the case must be submitted to the jury. Id.\r\nIn reviewing an order granting a directed verdict, the appellate court views\r\nthe evidence and all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the party against whom the directed verdict was granted.\r\nUnlimited Services, Inc. v. Macklen Enter., Inc., 303 S.C. 384, 401 S.E.2d 153\r\n(1991). \r\n  \r\np.2\r\n\r\nMullinax v J. M. Brown Amusement \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent brought this action under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-1-20\r\n(1991)1 which allows a third party to sue for recovery of the gambling losses\r\nof another when the loser fails to sue for those losses. Respondent asserts\r\nthat the statute contemplates collusion on the part of the gambler to\r\npurposefully neglect to bring a lawsuit during the three month period\r\nprovided in S.C. Code Ann.Â§ 32-1-10 (1991)2so that a third party can recover\r\ntreble damages under Â§  32-1-20. Respondent maintains there was no\r\nevidence presented that her husband purposely failed to file suit to allow\r\nrespondent to sue for a greater amount. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn this case of first impression, the Court of Appeals looked to\r\nother jurisdictions for guidance in determining the implication of covin and\r\ncollusion under similar gambling loss recovery statutes.  The Illinois Supreme\r\nCourt considered a case under a similar gambling loss recovery statute in\r\nKizer v. Walden.3 In Kizer a brother brought an action to recover the losses \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Section 32-1-20 provides that:\r\nIn case any person who shall lose such money or other\r\nthing as aforesaid shall not, within the time aforesaid,\r\nreally and bona fide and without covin or collusion sue and\r\nwith effect prosecute for the money or other things so by\r\nhim or them lost and paid and delivered as aforesaid, it\r\nshall be lawful for any other person, by any such action or\r\nsuit as aforesaid, to sue for and recover the same and\r\ntreble the value thereof . . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2 Section 32-1-10 states that:\r\nAny person who shall at any time or sitting, by\r\nplaying at cards, dice table or any other game\r\nwhatsoever or by betting on the sides or hands of\r\nsuch as do play at any of the games aforesaid, lose to\r\nany person or persons so playing or betting, in the\r\nwhole, the sum or value of fifty dollars and shall pay\r\nor deliver such sum or value or any part thereof shall\r\nbe at liberty, within three months then next ensuing,\r\nto sue for and recover the money or goods so lost and\r\npaid or delivered or any part thereof from the\r\nrespective winner or winners . . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 65 N.E. 116 (111. 1902). \r\n  \r\np.3\r\n\r\nMullinax v. J. M. Brown Amusement \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof his gambling brother. In considering the issue of covin or collusion, the\r\nKizer court found the jury should have been allowed to decide whether any\r\ncollusion between the brothers was so extreme as to bar suit under the\r\nstatute. The Kizer court looked for evidence that the loser refrained from\r\nrecovering his losses within the statutory period and then brought the action\r\n\"in the name of his brother, or some other person, for the purpose of\r\nrecovering against the winner treble the amount of his losses.\" Kizer, at 118.\r\nThe court concluded that the trial court is not entitled to take the case from\r\nthe jury where the right of recovery depends on the existence of extrinsic\r\nfacts about which the evidence is conflicting. Kizer, id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Court of Appeals noted that Mr. Mullinax denied telling the\r\nfirst attorney to delay filing an action and stated he called the lawyer\r\n\"several times . . . . He never made a move and never [did] anything, until\r\nfinally I called him and cussed him out and told him to send my stuff back\r\nto me . . . He drug his feet from March until about October.\" Mr. Mullinax\r\ntestified that he had not engaged in any type of trickery, deceit or collusion.\r\nHe testified further that the lawsuit was respondent's and not his and he\r\ntold respondent that he would help her get the money back anyway he could.\r\nWhile Mr. Mullinax admitted that he compiled the evidence of his losses for\r\nthe lawsuit, he gathered the information because he was the only one that\r\ncould make sense of it. Mr. Mullinax denied that his efforts to assist his\r\nwife were collusive but he only wanted to help her. Respondent testified that\r\nshe was not in \"cahoots\" with her husband and that Mr. Mullinax did not\r\npurposely fail to file an action within three months in order to allow her to\r\nsue for a greater amount. The Court of Appeals noted that it was natural\r\nfor Mr. Mullinax to assist his wife in preparing for the lawsuit since he had\r\nthe necessary information and documentation. The Court of Appeals\r\nconcluded there was more than one reasonable inference that can be drawn\r\nfrom the evidence, therefore the case must be submitted to the jury. We\r\nagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNext, petitioner Brown contends the gaming statute is\r\nunconstitutional and inapplicable to the facts of this case. Brown asserts\r\nsince he is licensed under State law it \"would defy all notions of\r\nsubstantial justice and fair play\" to subject him to liability under the gaming statute.\r\nBrown further asserts he should not be subject to liability as long as he \r\n  \r\np.4\r\n\r\nMullinax v J.

Creech v. South Carolina\r\nWildlife and Marine Resources Dep't , 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571\r\n(1997)(issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to\r\nbe preserved for review). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPetitioner Petroleum Distributors contends the Court of Appeals\r\nerred in failing to hold that the causes of action occurring within three\r\nmonths of the initial complaint had not accrued when the suit was filed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-1-10 provides that anyone who loses more\r\nthan $50.00 at a sitting while gambling has three months from the date of\r\nthe loss to sue for and recover the amount lost. Section 32-1-20 provides that\r\nif the gambler does not sue to recover the losses within three months, a third\r\nparty may thereafter sue for recovery of the gambler's losses. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the initial complaint filed on November 15, 1993, respondent\r\nsought to recover her husband's losses from 1991 through 1993. Respondent\r\nfiled an amended complaint in November 1994 seeking recovery for losses\r\nfrom June 11, 1991 through November 3, 1993. Petitioner asserts at the\r\ntime of the initial complaint, respondent had no cause of action under Â§ 32-1-\r\n20 for any claim after August 15, 1993, as those causes of action remained\r\nwith the gambler under Â§ 32-1-10. Petitioner argues the defect was not cured by\r\nthe amended complaint because the amended complaint relates back\r\nto the date of the initial complaint under Rule 15(c), SCRCP. Respondent\r\nanswers that the issue of ripeness was not in issue before the trial court because\r\nneither petitioner pled a defense dealing with ripeness. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe amended complaint was sufficient as a supplemental pleading\r\npursuant to Rule 15(d), SCRCP. Rule 15(d) provides that the court may\r\npermit a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or\r\noccurrences or events which happened since the date of the pleading sought\r\nto be supplemented, whether or not the original pleading is defective in its \r\n  \r\n\r\n4We note that in Berkebile v. Outen, we found the gaming statute\r\ndid not require playing of illegal games and was applicable to loss incurred\r\nby a gambler playing legalized video poker. 311 S.C. 50, 426 S.E.2d 760\r\n(1993). \r\n  \r\np.5\r\n\r\nMullinax v.

Accordingly, the amended\r\ncomplaint sufficiently asserted the causes of action which accrued after the\r\ninitial complaint. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFinally, Petroleum Distributors asserts the VGMA repeals by\r\nimplication the gaming statutes Â§Â§ 32-1-10 and 32-1-20. Petitioner argues\r\nthe VGMA sets forth a comprehensive set of rules and regulations concerning\r\nvideo poker machines with limitations on the amount of payoffs and taxes on\r\neach machine. Repeal by implication is disfavored and is found only when\r\ntwo statutes are incapable of reconcilement. Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323\r\nS.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (1996). The Court of Appeals addressed this\r\nquestion at length in Justice v. Pantry and concluded that section 32-1-20\r\nwas not impliedly repealed by enactment of the VGMA because the statutes\r\nare not repugnant to each other and are not incapable of a reasonable\r\nreconcilement. 330 S.C. 37, 496 S.E.2d 871 (Ct. App. 1998). We agree, the\r\nVGMA did not impliedly repeal the gaming statutes. Justice v.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\nDeputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\nAssistant Attorney General G. Robert Deloach, III,\r\nall of Columbia; and Solicitor Walter L. Bailey, Jr.,\r\nof Summerville, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBURNETT, A.J.: This is an appeal from a sentence imposed\r\nby a family court judge in a juvenile criminal contempt proceeding. We\r\naffirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe appellant, Vincent J., pled guilty to two counts of \r\n  \r\np.7\r\n\r\nIn the Interest of Vincent J. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmalicious injury to personal property and was sentenced to probation with\r\na condition of alternative placement. Appellant was informed by the judge\r\nthat he could be held in contempt of court if he violated the conditions of\r\nhis probation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn December 15, 1997, a contempt hearing was held and\r\nappellant pled guilty to violating certain provisions of the previous\r\nsentencing order, including being terminated from the New Directions\r\nprogram (alternative placement). The judge ordered appellant committed\r\nto the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) for 180 days, suspended upon\r\nthe service of 178 days. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant filed a motion to reconsider the order of commitment\r\nbased on the alleged illegality of sentencing a juvenile to more than a\r\nninety day determinate sentence. In an order issued on January 6, 1998,\r\nthe judge denied this motion finding the family court has the inherent\r\npower to imprison a juvenile criminal contemnor for a period of 180 days. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn March 4, 1998, appellant sought supersedeas from this\r\nCourt. Chief Judge Howell, of the Court of Appeals, granted supersedeas\r\nand remanded the matter to the family court for reimposition of conditions\r\nof probation. On March 16, 1998, the family court sentenced appellant\r\nto an additional ninety days of DJJ placement and an additional twenty-four\r\nmonths of probation.1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDoes S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7810(B) (Supp. 1997) prevent a\r\nfamily court judge from committing a juvenile criminal\r\ncontemnor to a determinate sentence of more than ninety days? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1Although appellant has served the confinement part of his sentence,\r\nthis case is not moot because this is a situation that is capable of\r\nrepetition yet evading review. Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426,\r\n468 S.E.2d 861 (1996); In the Interest of Darlene C., 278 S.C. 664, 301\r\nS.E.2d 136 (1983). \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nIn the Interest of Vincent J. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant claims Â§ 20-7-7810(B)2prevents the family court from\r\nenforcing its orders by sentencing a juvenile contemnor to commitment to\r\nthe custody of DJJ for a determinate sentence of more than ninety days.\r\nWe disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe primary function of the Court in interpreting a statute is\r\nto ascertain the intention of the legislature. Wright v. Colleton County\r\nSchool District 301 S.C. 262, 391 S.E.2d 564 (1990). Under the\r\nplain meaning rule, it is not the Court's place to change the meaning of a clear\r\nand unambiguous statute. See Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C.\r\n434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995) (if a statute's language is plain and\r\nunambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of\r\nstatutory interpretation are not needed and the Court has no right to\r\nimpose another meaning); Gilstrap v. South Carolina Budget and Control\r\nBd., 310 S.C. 210, 423 S.E.2d 101 (1992) (in construing a statute, the\r\nCourt must give clear and unambiguous terms their plain and ordinary\r\nmeaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or\r\nexpand the statute's operation). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPrior to July 1, 1996, the family court could sentence a\r\njuvenile in the following manner: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAll commitments to the custody of the Department of Juvenile\r\nJustice for delinquency as opposed to the conviction of a\r\nspecific crime may be made only for the reasons and in the\r\nmanner prescribed . . ., with evaluations made and proceedings\r\nconducted only by the judges authorized to order commitments\r\nin this section. When a child is committed to the custody of\r\nthe department under the proceedings, commitments must be \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Appellant attempts to classify himself as a status offender because\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7810(F) (Supp. 1997) expressly restricts a family\r\ncourt's authority to sanction a status offender contemnor. A family court\r\ncannot commit this type of contemnor to more than 90 days of\r\nconfinement. Id. A status offender is a juvenile who commits an offense\r\nthat would not be a crime if committed by an adult. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n20-7-30(6) (1976). However, since appellant was previously adjudicated a\r\ndelinquent and not a status offender, Â§ 20-7-7810(F) does not apply. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nIn the Interest of Vincent J. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor an indeterminate sentence, not extending beyond the\r\ntwenty-first birthday of the child unless sooner released by the\r\ndepartment. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAct No. 83, Â§ 20, 1995 S.C. Acts 569, amending S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-\r\n2170(D) (1985) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis restriction on commitment did not apply to contempt\r\nproceedings because the provision related only to initial delinquency\r\nproceedings. Thus, the family court's inherent power to hold a juvenile in\r\ncriminal contempt and to sanction the contemnor by committing him to\r\nthe custody of DJJ for a determinate period of 180 days was not restricted\r\nby this statutory provision. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn July 1, 1996, Â§ 20-7-2170(D) was repealed and recodified as\r\n Â§ 20-7-7810(B) and amended to read as follows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAll commitments to the custody of the Department of Juvenile\r\nJustice for delinquency as opposed to the conviction of a\r\nspecific crime may be made only for the reasons and in the\r\nmanner prescribed . . ., with evaluations made and proceedings\r\nconducted only by the judges authorized to order commitments\r\nin this section. When a child is committed to the custody of\r\nthe department, commitment must be for an indeterminate\r\nsentence not extending beyond the twenty-first birthday\r\nof the child unless sooner released by the department, or for a \r\ndeterminate commitment sentence not to exceed ninety days. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7810(B) (Supp. 1997) (emphasis added). This\r\namendment deleted the reference to \"under the proceedings\" and added the\r\nninety day determinate sentence limitation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant argues because the legislature deleted the \"under the\r\nproceedings\" language, it intended for this sentencing limitation to apply\r\nto all juvenile proceedings, including contempt proceedings. Thus,\r\naccording to appellant, the amended statute limits the judge's ability to\r\ncommit a delinquent juvenile contemnor to the custody of DJJ for a \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.10\r\n\r\nIn the Interest of Vincent J \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeterminate period more than ninety days.3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe disagree. In our opinion, the deletion of the language\r\n\"under the proceedings\" does not expand the scope of this statutory\r\nprovision to include all juvenile proceedings. We find this\r\nprovision refers only to delinquency proceedings since this provision is part of a paragraph\r\nwhich deals with commitments for delinquency. In recodifying this\r\nparagraph, the legislature simply eliminated unnecessary language. It did\r\nnot alter the meaning of this paragraph. Thus, this section does not\r\nrestrict the sanctions available to a family court under its inherent\r\ncontempt power \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOur interpretation is further supported by the fact the\r\nlegislature specifically limits the available sanctions for a status offender\r\ncontemnor. S.C. Code Ann.  Â§ 20-7-7810(F) (Supp. 1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSection 20-7-7810(B) does not limit a family court's power to\r\ncommit a delinquent juvenile contemnor to the custody of DJJ for a period\r\nof time exceeding 90 days; therefore, we uphold appellant's sentence. \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and WALLER, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 Because an indeterminate sentence might result in a sentence that\r\nis more than 180 days, the family court cannot sentence a contemner to\r\nimprisonment for an indeterminate amount of time. A jury trial is\r\nrequired to sentence a contemnor to more than 180 days (6 months) of\r\nimprisonment and the family court does not conduct jury trials. See\r\nPoston v. Poston,  Op. No. 24802 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 8, 1998); S.C.\r\nCode Ann.

What are the factors to be considered and standards to be applied\r\nin determining whether a particular type of activity is a lottery as\r\nprohibited by the South Carolina Constitution? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2. Do the Type II and Type III machines constitute lotteries in\r\nviolation of the South Carolina Constitution?1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPlaintiffs, purporting to represent themselves and others similarly\r\nsituated, initiated this action for damages and injunctive relief in the State\r\ncircuit court in June 1997. Defendants own or operate video gaming devices \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 The machines at issue are all video gambling devices that are\r\nphysically present and licensed for operation in this state as Class III\r\nmachines (subtypes II and III) under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2720(A)(3).\r\nType II include the games of lotto, bingo and the traditional game of keno.\r\nType III include games such as poker and black jack as well as one\r\nvariety of keno. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.51 \r\n  \r\n\r\nJohnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., Inc \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(video poker machines) under authority of licenses issued by the South\r\nCarolina Department of Revenue. Defendants removed the action to Federal\r\nDistrict Court because the asserted claims included a cause of action under\r\nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S.C. Â§Â§\r\n1961 et seq. Subsequently, additional plaintiffs and defendants were added,\r\nand the complaint was amended to allege that video poker games are being\r\noperated in violation of Article XVII, Â§ 7 of the South Carolina Constitution,\r\nwhich prohibits lotteries. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn December 1997, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary\r\ninjunction seeking to have the court enjoin the defendants from continuing to\r\noperate their video poker games because the games are illegal lotteries under\r\nthe State Constitution and are violative of state statutes. The parties agreed that\r\nthe constitutional issue could override the statutory issues. The South\r\nCarolina Attorney General has intervened and joined in the motion for\r\ninjunctive relief. The District Court allowed the parties to engage in\r\nextensive discovery prior to a hearing on the motion for a preliminary\r\ninjunction. Based upon evidence presented at the motion hearing, that Court\r\nmade factual findings and issued an Order of Certification to the South\r\nCarolina Supreme Court pursuant to South Carolina Appellate Court Rule\r\n228. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 228(b), SCACR,2 contemplates that the South Carolina Supreme\r\nCourt will base its answers to the questions certified exclusively upon the\r\nfindings of fact by the District Court and, if necessary, the record in this\r\nmatter. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn considering Question 1, we look to the applicable provision of the\r\nState Constitution, which reads: \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 A certification order shall set forth the questions of law to be\r\nanswered, all findings of fact relevant to the questions certified, and a\r\nstatement showing fully the nature of the controversy in which the\r\nquestions arose. The Supreme Court may request the original or copies of\r\nall or of any portion of the record before the certifying court to be filed\r\nwith the Court, if, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the record or a\r\nportion thereof may be necessary in deciding to accept or in answering the\r\nquestions. Rule 228(b), SCACR. \r\n  \r\np.52\r\n\r\nJohnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., Inc \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo lottery shall ever be allowed or be advertised by newspapers,\r\nor otherwise, or its tickets be sold in this State. The game of\r\nbingo, when conducted by charitable, religious or fraternal\r\norganizations exempt from federal income taxation or when\r\nconducted at recognized annual State and county fairs, shall not\r\nbe deemed a lottery prohibited by this section. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C.

XVII, Â§ 7.3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Constitution does not prohibit games of chance or gambling per se;\r\nwith the exception that it is unlawful for public officials to engage in\r\n\"gambling or betting on games of chance.\" S.C. Const. art. XVII, Â§8. The\r\nframers of our Constitution clearly distinguished between \"lottery\" and\r\n\"gambling or betting on games of chance.\" Adhering to the constitutional\r\ndistinction, the South Carolina statutory scheme includes sections that\r\nspecifically deal with lottery, gaming, and betting. See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§Â§ 16-19-10 to 16-19-30 (lotteries); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-19-40 (prohibiting\r\ngames of chance or gambling devices at state and county fairs); and S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 16-19-60 (coin-operated pinball machines). This distinction between\r\nlottery and other forms of gaming, found within the text of the Constitution\r\nitself, supports the conclusion that its framers used the term \"lottery\" in a\r\nnarrow sense. This conclusion accords with that of the South Dakota\r\nSupreme Court in a similar case: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[B]y separately stating the terms 'game of chance' and 'lottery,'\r\nthe framers of the original [constitutional] provision intended the\r\nterm 'game of chance' to be broad in scope, including most forms\r\nof gaming, and the term 'lottery' in the narrower sense \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 Prior state constitutions included the following language similar to\r\nthe current lottery prohibition provision. \"Lotteries, and the sale of lottery\r\ntickets, for any purpose whatever, are prohibited, and the General\r\nAssembly shall prevent the same by penal laws.\" S.C. Const. art. XIV, Â§ 2\r\n(1868). \"No lottery shall ever be allowed, or be advertised by newspaper,\r\nor otherwise, or its tickets be sold in this state; and the General Assembly\r\nshall provide by law at its next session for the enforcement of this\r\nprovision.\" S.C. Const. art. XVII, Â§ 7 (1895). In 1975, the constitutional\r\nprovision prohibiting lotteries was amended and remains in effect to this\r\ndate. \r\n  \r\np.53\r\n\r\nJohnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., Inc \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontemplating the sale of tokens or tickets to large numbers of\r\npeople for the chance to share in the distribution of prizes for the\r\npurpose of raising public revenue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPoppen v. Walker, 520 N.W.2d 238, 245 (S.D. 1994). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Constitutional exemption for bingo4 is consistent with a narrow\r\nreading of the word \"lottery\" since bingo is commonly defined as a game\r\nderived from lotto, which in turn is based on lottery,5 or a form of lottery\r\noften played simultaneously by hundreds or thousands of people.6 However,\r\nthe fact that bingo is generally considered a lottery, and meets the common\r\ndefinition of lottery, does not prove that other forms of gambling are lotteries.\r\nFurther, it does not undermine the conclusion that the term lottery is\r\nnarrowly construed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Court in Rountree v. Ingle, 94 S.C. 231, 77 S.E. 931 (1913)7\r\ndistinguished lotteries from gambling by stating: \"Our statute makes not only\r\nthe promoter of a lottery, but the adventurers in it liable to indictment . . .\r\nThe purchaser of a lottery ticket in this State is therefore in a different plight\r\nfrom one who loses money in gambling . . . who may recover the amount paid\r\nout.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Court in Darlington Theatres characterized a lottery as a form of\r\ngambling which provided for the distribution of prizes by lot or chance.\r\nDarlington Theatres Inc. v. Coker, 190 S.C. 282, 2 S.E.2d 782 (1939). While\r\nevery lottery is a gaming device, not every gaming device is a lottery within\r\nthe generally recognized meaning of the word- Accordingly, not all forms of \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 The game of bingo, when conducted by charitable, religious or\r\nfraternal organizations exempt from federal income taxation or when\r\nconducted at recognized annual State and county fairs, shall not be\r\ndeemed a lottery prohibited by this section. S.C. Const. art. XVII, Â§ 7. \r\n  \r\n5 Encarta 97 Encyclopedia (Microsoft deluxe ed. 1996) \r\n  \r\n6 2 The New Encyclopedia Britannica 218 (15th ed. 1997). \r\n  \r\n7 The Court decided the question of plaintiff's right to ownership of a\r\n prize claimed by the defendant who recovered the winning lottery ticket\r\nafter it had been discarded by the plaintiff. Rountree v. Ingle, supra. \r\n  \r\np.54\r\n\r\nJohnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., Inc \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngambling are violative of our constitution. In 1818, this Court narrowly\r\nconstrued the term \"lottery\" as \"a term of art\" noting that \"otherwise it may\r\nmean any thing, as in common parlance it is applied to one half of the\r\nordinary occurrences or accidents of life.\" State v Pinchback, 9 S.C.L. 128 (2\r\nMill) (1818) The Pinchback Court emphasized the necessity of restricting\r\napplication of the term lottery to only one class of adventures or hazards. In\r\ndoing so, the Court stated that an activity \"may be an adventure or hazard\r\nwithout a lottery; every throw of the die, even for an ordinary wager, is an\r\nadventure or hazard and I am sure it never yet entered the mind of any man\r\nthat it constituted a lottery.\" State v. Pinchbeck, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLikewise, the Court in Darlington Theatres found it apparent that \"the\r\nconstitutional and legislative prohibition is directed at a special type of vice\r\nin the fields of advertising and gift enterprises -- the type that has come to\r\nbe denominated both in the law and in common parlance by the word lottery.\" \r\nDarlington Theatres, 190 S.C. at 290, 2 S.E.2d at 786. The Court held the\r\nstatutes enforcing the constitutional prohibition against lotteries were\r\n\"undoubtedly directed at a particular type of gaming or gambling which has\r\nbecome commonly known as a lottery, and not the prohibition of games of\r\nchance of all kinds.\" Id. \r\n  \r\nThe Darlington Theatres decision addresses the definition of lottery in\r\nsome detail. The word lottery has no technical, legal meaning, but must be\r\nconstrued in the popular sense. Darlington Theatres, 190 S.C. at 292, 2\r\nS.E.2d at 786. Lottery is \"a species of gaming, which may be defined as a\r\nscheme for the distribution of prizes or things of value by lot or chance among\r\npersons who have paid, or agreed to pay, a valuable consideration for the\r\nchance to obtain a prize.\" Darlington Theatres, supra. The definition of\r\nlottery involves a \"scheme for raising money by selling chances to share in a\r\ndistribution of prizes; more specifically, a scheme for the distribution of prizes\r\nby chance among persons purchasing tickets, the correspondingly numbered\r\nslips, or lots, representing prizes or blanks, being drawn from a wheel on a\r\nday previously announced in connection with the scheme of intended prizes.\"\r\n190 S.C. at 292-93, 2 S.E.2d at 787.8 \r\n  \r\n\r\n8 The dissent relies on the three element test of prize, consideration,\r\nand chance derived from our decision in Darlington Theatres. This test\r\nwas used in Darlington Theatres to determine whether a drawing of\r\nsignature cards qualified as an illegal lottery. The general character of\r\nthe form of gaming in that case, a drawing with \"tickets.\" was not in \r\n  \r\np.55\r\n\r\nJohnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., Inc \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorically, in the early 1800's, a lottery was typically a government-\r\nsponsored means of raising revenue by selling tickets for prizes awarded by\r\nlot. See Ronald J. Rychlak, Lotteries, Revenues and Social Costs: A\r\nHistorical Examination of State-Sponsored Gambling, 34 B.C.L.Rev. 11 (1992).\r\nA \"lottery\" in its narrowest sense is conurionly defined as \"a gambling game\r\n . . . in which a large number of tickets are sold and a drawing is held for\r\ncertain prizes.\"9 Since its original ratification in 1868 the constitutional\r\nprovision has specified \"tickets\" as part of the prohibited lottery activity. See\r\n1868 S.C. Const. art. XIV, Â§ 2. Use of the word \"tickets\" indicates the\r\nframers' narrow conception of a lottery as commonly understood, i.e., gambling\r\ninvolves \"tickets\" and a drawing by lot. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe emphasize that the first question before this Court pertains to\r\nwhether a particular activity is a lottery prohibited by the state constitution.\r\nThe parties focus on the broader issue of chance. However, as the district\r\njudge noted in the Order of Certification, it is unnecessary to define the\r\nmeaning of the term chance if this Court finds video gaming devices are not\r\nlotteries. We find lottery is a term of art and video gaming devices do not\r\ncome within the plain and ordinary meaning of \"lottery\" because they do not\r\ninvolve a drawing and \"tickets\" or other indicium of entitlement to a prize.10\r\nWe have made this finding based on the longstanding definitions and\r\ndistinctions enunciated in Darlington Theatres, Rountree, and Pinchback.\r\nThis Court is constrained to give the words of our Constitution their plain and\r\nordinary meaning. See Davis v. County of Greenville, 313 S.C. 459, 443\r\nS.E.2d 383 (1994)(language of constitution given its plain and ordinary\r\nmeaning). \r\n  \r\n\r\nquestion. The issue there was simply whether a lack of consideration\r\nremoved the scheme from the definition of a prohibited lottery. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n9 Random House Dictionary of the English Language Second Edition\r\nUnabridged (1987). \r\n  \r\n10 Electronic ticketing would not necessarily preclude finding a\r\n lottery where electronic registration is the functional equivalent of a\r\nlottery ticket, i.e., evidence of one's entitlement to a prize over claims by\r\ncompeting ticket-holders. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.56 \r\n  \r\n\r\nJohnson v. Collins Entertainment Co., Inc \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2 asks us to apply the legal definition of lottery to preliminary\r\nfindings of fact so that the conclusions of this Court may be considered by the\r\nDistrict Court Judge in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction.\r\nAs stated in the Order of Certification, no finding of this Court will be binding\r\nfor entry of any permanent injunction or for the award of damages by the\r\nDistrict Court. We answer the second question with the caveat that we are\r\ngiving a response only to an interlocutory question of fact. Hence, the answer\r\nof this Court to Question 2 is that Type II and III machines do not constitute\r\nlotteries in violation of the South Carolina Constitution. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDeliberations on this matter were conducted within an atmosphere\r\ncharged with the knowledge of the potentially grave and far-reaching\r\nconsequences of our decision, regardless of the manner in which we responded\r\nto the questions certified. We are bound by the parameters set out in the\r\nState Constitution, statutes, and common law which direct our decision-\r\nmaking process. We are persuaded, and legal authority directs, that the\r\nalleged deleterious effect of an activity upon society is not a proper basis upon\r\nwhich the Courts may declare unlawful any such activity. If the results of\r\nour conclusions are \"inimicable to public welfare, then it would be a matter\r\nfor legislative action, and not one for the Courts.\" Darlington Theatres, supra,\r\nat 789. The judiciary does not play a role in determining whether video poker\r\nmachines should be allowed or prohibited in our State. For this reason we\r\nmust not abuse the language of our constitution to force a solution to an issue\r\n that rightfully must be resolved by our General Assembly. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCERTIFIED QUESTIONS ANSWERED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMOORE, A.J., and Acting Associate Justice Charles W.\r\n Whetstone, Jr., concur.

Definition of Lottery \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nObtaining its definition from the Random House Dictionary,\r\nthe majority holds a lottery is \"a gambling game ... in which a large\r\nnumber of tickets are sold and a drawing is held for certain prizes.\"1d This\r\ndefinition equates a lottery with a raffle and ignores the South Carolina\r\nConstitution and this Court's long-standing legal precedent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWith the adoption of the State Constitution in 1868, lotteries\r\nwere constitutionally prohibited for the first time in South Carolina. S.C.\r\nConst. art. XIV, Â§ 2 (1868)(\"Lotteries, and the sale of lottery tickets, for\r\nany purpose whatever, are prohibited, and the General Assembly shall \r\n  \r\n\r\n1d Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1137 (2nd. ed.\r\n1987). \r\n  \r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc., et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevent the same by penal laws.\"). Similarly, the 1895 Constitution\r\nprohibited lotteries. S.C. Const. art. XVII Â§ 7 (\"No lottery shall ever be\r\nallowed, or be advertised by newspaper or otherwise, or its tickets sold in\r\nthis state; and the General Assembly shall provide by law at its next\r\nsession for the enforcement of this provision.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn 1974, the citizens of South Carolina voted to amend the\r\nanti-lottery provision of the Constitution. This amendment was ratified by\r\nthe General Assembly in 1975. The current anti-lottery provision of the\r\nSouth Carolina Constitution states as follows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNo lottery shall ever be allowed or be advertised by \r\nnewspapers, or otherwise. or its tickets be sold in this State.\r\nThe game of bingo, when conducted by charitable, religious or\r\nfraternal organizations exempt from federal income taxation or\r\nwhen conducted at recognized State and county fairs, shall not\r\nbe deemed a lottery prohibited by this section. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Const. art. XVII, Â§ 7 (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe underscored language of this provision, which has\r\nremained virtually unchanged since 1868, is unambiguous. It prohibits all \r\nlotteries. If the framers of the Constitution had intended to only prohibit\r\nticket lotteries, as asserted by the majority, the constitutional prohibition\r\nwould have expressly limited the prohibition to ticket lotteries. To the\r\ncontrary, the South Carolina Constitution has never limited a lottery to a\r\nscheme which issues tickets or \"other indicium of entitlement to a prize,\"\r\nas asserted by the majority today. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn fact, with the passage of the constitutional amendment in\r\n1974, the citizens of this State specifically recognized that the game of\r\nbingo is a lottery prohibited by article XVII, Â§ 72d By adopting the\r\namendment, the citizens of South Carolina legalized the playing of bingo\r\n in certain limited instances. Under the majority's definition, however, the \r\n  \r\n\r\n2d Army Navy Bingo, Garrison No. 2196 v. Plowden, 281 S.C. 226, 314\r\nS.E.2d 339 (1984)(bingo is a lottery); Bingo Bank. Inc. v. Strom, 268 S.C.\r\n498, 501, 234 S.E.2d 881, 883 (1977)(\"'[T]he game of bingo' under the 1975\r\namendment refers to the game previously played illegally by charitable\r\norganizations throughout the State.\"). \r\n  \r\np.59\r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc., et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaying of bingo would be legal in all circumstances since the game does\r\nnot involve the issuance of tickets. See Knight v. State ex rel.  Moore, 574\r\nSo.2d 662, 669 (Miss. 1990)('[A]ny attempt to equate a bingo card with a\r\nlottery ticket would be superficial at best and unpersuasive at worst.\").\r\nThe majority's definition is contrary to the citizens' understanding of the\r\nconstitutional provision. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFurther, the constitutional prohibition against the sale of\r\nlottery tickets does not limit and/or characterize lotteries as a form of\r\ngambling in which tickets are sold. Instead, it merely forbids the sale of\r\nlottery tickets, in addition to the operation of lotteries and the\r\nadvertisement of lotteries. Similarly, in many jurisdictions, the term\r\n\"lottery\" is not limited to \"ticket lotteries,\" even though the constitutions in\r\nthose jurisdictions, like the Constitution in this State, refer to tickets.  Ill.\r\nConst. art. IV, Â§ 27 (\"[T]he general assembly shall have no power to\r\nauthorize lotteries or gift enterprises for any purpose, and shall pass laws\r\nto prohibit the sale of lottery or gift enterprise tickets in this state.\"); Kan.\r\nConst. art. XV, Â§ 3 (\"Lotteries and the sale of lottery tickets are forever\r\nprohibited.\"); La. Const., art. XIX, Â§ 8 (\"Lotteries and the sale of lottery\r\ntickets are prohibited in this State.\"); Ohio Const. art. XV, Â§ 6 (\"Lotteries,\r\nand the sale of lottery tickets, for any purpose whatever, shall forever be\r\nprohibited in this State, except that the General Assembly may authorize\r\nan agency of the state to conduct lotteries . . . .\"); Oregon Const. art. XV, Â§\r\n17 (\"Lotteries, and the sale of lottery tickets, for any purpose whatever,\r\nare prohibited, and the legislative assembly shall prevent the same by\r\npenal laws.\"); Tenn. Const. art. XL Â§ 5 (\"The Legislature shah have no\r\npower to authorize lotteries for any purpose and shall pass laws to prevent\r\nthe sale of lottery tickets in this State.\"); W.Va. Const. art. VI, Â§ 36 (\"The\r\n legislature shall have no power to authorize lotteries or gift enterprises for\r\nany purpose, and shah pass laws to prohibit the sale of lottery or gift\r\nenterprise tickets in this State; . . . .\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFinally, the majority's definition of \"lottery\" ignores this\r\nCourt's holding in Darlington Theatres v. Coker , 190 S.C. 282, 2 S.E.2d\r\n782 (1939), where, after considering various definitions,3d the Court \r\n  \r\n\r\n3d The majority asserts the issue before the Court in Darlington\r\nTheatres was not the definition of lottery but whether the element of\r\nconsideration existed in a particular scheme. To the contrary, the\r\ndefinition of lottery was the precise issue before the Court. \r\n  \r\np.60 \r\n  \r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc., et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nultimately concluded: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nto constitute a lottery or a scheme in the nature of a lottery, it\r\nis essential that three elements be present, to wit: (1) The\r\ngiving of a prize, (2) by a method involving chance, (3) for a\r\nconsideration paid by the contestant or participant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nId. S.C. at 291, S.E.2d at 786.

The Constitution is a flexible document\r\napplicable to changing times and conditions. Knight v. Hollings, 242\r\nS.C. 1, 4, 129 S.E.2d 746, 747 (1963)(\"[A] constitutional provision ... is not to\r\nbe viewed solely in the light of conditions existing at the time of its\r\nadoption, being intended not to obstruct the progress of the state but \r\n  \r\n\r\nessential elements of a lottery are consideration, prize and chance, and,\r\nwhere they are present and chance predominates, even though skill or\r\njudgment may enter to some extent in the operation of a particular\r\nscheme or device, the scheme or device is a lottery.\"); Coca-Cola Bottling\r\nCo.  of Wisconsin v.

The Parties' Arguments \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn determining the role of chance, the defendants maintain\r\nthe \"British Rule\" or \"Pure chance doctrine\" is the established law in South\r\nCarolina. Under this doctrine, only a scheme in which the result is\r\ndetermined solely by chance is a lottery; if skill plays any part, the scheme\r\nis not a lottery. Braddock v. Family Finance Corporation, 506 P.2d 824\r\n(Idaho 1973)(a scheme is considered a lottery when a participant's\r\njudgment plays no part in the selection and award of the prize).\r\nDefendants base their argument on Powell v. Red Carpet Lounge 280 S.C.\r\n142, 311 S.E.2d 719 (1984), and the reception statute.8d \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe plaintiffs contend the Court should adopt the \"American\r\nRule\" or \"dominant factor doctrine\" in determining whether a game is one\r\nof skill or chance. Under the dominant factor doctrine, \"a scheme\r\nconstitutes a lottery where chance dominates the distribution of prizes,\r\neven though such a distribution is affected to some degree by the exercise\r\nof skill or judgment.\" Morrow v. State, 511 P.2d 127, 129 (Alaska 1973). \r\n  \r\n\r\n7d Because the parties appear to agree on the definitions of\r\nconsideration and prize, I will not define those terms. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n8d S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-1-50 (1977)(\"All, and every part, of the common\r\nlaw of England, where it is not altered by the Code or inconsistent with\r\nthe Constitution or law of this State, is hereby continued in full force and\r\neffect in the same manner as before the adoption of this section.\"). \r\n  \r\np.64\r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc., et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Analysis \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn my opinion, the British rule or pure chance doctrine is not\r\nthe established law in South Carolina. Red Carpet id., is not controlling.\r\nIn Red Carpet, the sheriff seized the defendant's coin-operated machines to\r\ndetermine the legality of their existence and possession. The Court\r\nspecified there was no allegation of illegal use of the machines. The Court\r\ndetermined the possession of the machines did not violate the constitution\r\nand, further, as there was no indication the machines were used for illegal\r\npurposes, the lottery issue was not involved. Red Carpet did not in any\r\nmanner describe the role of chance in determining whether a scheme is a\r\nlottery. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMoreover, in accordance with the reception statute, the\r\ncommon law of England is ordinarily presumed to govern if there is no\r\nSouth Carolina authority to the contrary. State ex rel. McLeod v. Sloan \r\nConstruction Co., Inc., 284 S.C. 491, 328 S.E.2d 84 (Ct.App. 1985). This\r\nstatute does not, however, preclude the Court from interpreting the\r\nConstitution and declaring the law of South Carolina. This is the first\r\noccasion in which the Court has considered the role of chance within the\r\nmeaning of the term \"lottery.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI reject the pure chance doctrine. Under the doctrine, any\r\nskill, however minimal, is sufficient to remove a scheme from the\r\ndefinition of lottery. Under the pure chance doctrine many obviously\r\nchance-based games, such as guessing contests, would not be lotteries. For\r\ninstance, a mathematician might more accurately predict the number of\r\nmarbles in a glass bowl than a non-mathematician. However, certain\r\nunknown elements, such as the thickness of the glass and number of\r\nmarbles hidden from view, would make an exact calculation impossible.\r\nUnder the pure chance doctrine, some skill would be exercised in\r\ndetermining the number of marbles and the contest would not be a lottery.\r\nSee State ex Inf. McKittrick v. Globe-Democrat Pub. Co., 110 S.W.2d 705\r\n(Mo. 1937)(en banc). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nInstead, I would hold, where the dominant factor in a\r\nparticipant's success or failure in a particular scheme is beyond his\r\ncontrol, the scheme is a lottery, even though the participant exercises\r\nsome degree of skill or judgment. If a participant's skill does not govern\r\nthe result of the game, the scheme contains the requisite chance necessary\r\nto constitute a lottery. On the other hand, if through the exercise of skill \r\n  \r\np.65\r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc., et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor judgment a participant can determine the outcome, the scheme is not a\r\nlottery.9d My opinion is supported by the majority of jurisdictions which\r\nhave considered this question.10d Only three jurisdictions adopt the pure \r\n  \r\n\r\n9d I note the language in Darlington Theatres, supra, \"by a method\r\ninvolving chance,\" suggests even the minimal involvement of chance in a\r\nscheme is sufficient to constitute a lottery. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n10d United States v.

In each case, however, significant facets of the \r\ngame are controlled by the selection of a card. number, or icon\r\nby the random number generator... In each case, . . . . the \r\nrandom selection is critical to the play of the game because it \r\ndetermines the numbers, cards, or icons which, in turn, \r\ndetermine whether the player wins or loses the game.

In the remaining instances, the last act may\r\nbe the player's decision not to risk an already strong hand by\r\nsubjecting it to an additional random act. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the process of designing the games, the manufacturers use\r\nmathematical models to determine the 'optimum play.'\r\nOptimum play models establish the rate of financial return a\r\nplayer using the best possible strategy for maximizing winning\r\npotential can expect to receive... The pay tables are adjusted \r\nby the manufacturers so that, over time, oven optimum play \r\nwould result in a return of less than 100%. In other words the \r\nmachines are designed to return, on average, less than one \r\ndollar for each dollar spent. even with players using the best \r\npossible strategies.... \r\n  \r\nOrder, pp.6-8 (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe order specifically describes the Type II games as follows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe second category of games (\"Type II\") include the games of\r\nlotto, bingo, and the traditional game of keno. The player\r\ndeposits his or her money, the player makes some decision, a\r\nrandom selection occurs, and the outcome of the game is\r\ndetermined. Although the player makes some decision in the\r\nprocess of playing these games, such as by selecting an\r\narbitrary number, the player's decision does not affect the role \r\nthat chance plays in the outcome of the game. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOrder, p.9 (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs noted in the certification order, one of the defendants'\r\nexpert mathematicians testified Type II games operate purely on chance.\r\nThe district judge stated, \"[i]t is, therefore, without dispute that Type II\r\ngames are pure games of chance.\" Order, p.12. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUnder either the pure chance doctrine or dominant factor \r\n  \r\np.69\r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc. et al \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoctrine, chance governs the outcome of a Type II video game. I would\r\nhold Type II games constitute lotteries in violation of Article XVII, Â§ 7 of\r\nthe South Carolina Constitution. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWith regard to Type III games, the certification order finds: \r\n  \r\nThe third category of games (\"Type III\") includes games such as\r\npoker and black jack as well as one variety of keno. In these games,\r\nthe player makes a variety of decisions at one or more points during\r\nplay of the game. The decisions the player makes may affect the\r\ncontinued play and the ultimate results of the game in a variety of\r\nways. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFirst, the player may make decisions as to how to continue to play.\r\nFor instance, in a poker game the player will decide which cards to\r\nkeep and which to discard. While this decision could be based on\r\nsheer caprice, it would normally be based on the player's view of the\r\nprobability of receiving certain replacement cards that would\r\nconstitute a winning hand. This decision may also be influenced by\r\nthe player's analysis of the relative value of the given hands that\r\ncould be received. In other words, a player faced with two or more\r\npossible \"good\" options may be willing to try for the less likely hand\r\nif the payout is high enough to justify the increased risk... \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn short, the Type III games are the most complex and diverse\r\n.... Still, some features are common to all machines .... In\r\nparticular, each game begins with the random selection of\r\ncards, numbers, or other icons. The player sees these and is\r\ngiven an opportunity to make one or more decisions. A second\r\nrandom selection is then made by the machine. The ultimate \r\noutcome is, therefore, influenced by, but is not entirely \r\ndetermined by the player's decisions. However. regardless of\r\nskill, knowledge, or experience, a player cannot alter the \r\nprobabilities inherent in the play of any Type I, Type II, or \r\nType III video machine games. Neither can the player modify\r\nthe function of the random number generator, or the random \r\ndelivery of cards, numbers, or icons. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFurther, in any particular play, the odds of obtaining a particular \r\ncard or combination of cards after discard are weighted against the \r\nplayer. \r\n  \r\np.70\r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc. et al \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder, pp.9-11 (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhether chance predominates over skill is not easily answered\r\nwith regard to the Type III games because the parties define \"skill\"\r\ndifferently. The plaintiffs maintain since play is completed by a random\r\nact outside the control of a player or by a player's decision to stand on the\r\nresult of a prior random act, and the odds are stacked against a player,\r\nchance predominates. In effect, the plaintiffs define \"skill\" as the ability to\r\naffect the odds of obtaining a given card and, ultimately, the outcome of\r\nthe game. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn the other hand, the defendants define \"skill\" as a player's\r\nability to maximize the numbers of credits or dollars won through\r\nknowledge of probabilities and consideration of the potential payoff. One\r\nof the defendants' experts presented a mathematical model which\r\ncompared the results of a player using optimum game strategy with a\r\nplayer acting entirely randomly. Since the most skilled player would win\r\nback 96.5% of his credits and the most unskilled player would win back\r\n31% of his credits, the expert concluded skill predominated over chance. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAnother of the defendants' experts testified, with regard to\r\nvideo blackjack, differing play strategies could produce differences in\r\nexcess of 50% in returns expected from the best and worst players. In the\r\nmodified keno game, \"Double Up Keno,\" there would be even greater\r\ndifferences in the expected returns of the best and worst players. The\r\ndistrict court noted \"[t]his testimony was based on the same form of\r\nmathematical model discussed [by the defendants' previous expert].\"\r\nOrder, p.19. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs noted in the defendants' expert's mathematical model, the\r\nprobability of obtaining a particular hand does not increase, regardless of\r\na player's level of skill. Although a skilled player (unlike an unskilled\r\nplayer) can improve his chances of winning and maximize those winnings,\r\nhis ability to affect the outcome of a game, i.e., actually obtain the\r\nwinning card, is determined by the random number generator. Similarly,\r\nif two players both exercise optimal strategy, chance would determine\r\nwhich player, if either, would obtain a given card. A player's skill, no\r\nmatter how good or poor, does not control the random \"deal\" of the cards. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn my opinion, skill should be defined in terms of the ability to\r\nobtain the desired outcome - a certain card - rather than the ability of one \r\n  \r\np.71\r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc., et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplayer to play more judiciously than another.12d As noted by the\r\ncertification order, a video poker player is unable to control the random\r\nselection of cards, in spite of his skill, knowledge, or experience. Since the\r\nplayer cannot improve the likelihood he will obtain a certain card, I\r\nconclude chance dominates over skill in the operation of the Type III video\r\ngame machines. My conclusion is supported by authority from numerous\r\nother jurisdictions13d Accordingly, the Type III video machines are lotteries \r\n  \r\n\r\n12d See State ex Inf. McKittrick v.

I agree. Nonetheless, this Court\r\n is ultimately responsible for interpreting the South Carolina Constitution.\r\nEvatte v. Cass, 217 S.C. 62, 65, 59 S.E.2d 638, 639 (1950)(\"[T]he final\r\nresponsibility of interpreting the Constitution rests upon this Court.\"). I\r\nconstrue Article XVII, Â§7 of the South Carolina Constitution as\r\nprohibiting all schemes which meet the definition of \"lottery,\" including the\r\nvideo gaming machines described in the federal district court's certification\r\norder. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.73 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nTOAL, A.J. (concurring and dissenting): Because I profoundly disagree\r\nwith the analysis and conclusions reached by the majority, I must join my\r\nbrother Justice Burnett's opinion in substance. I concur in Justice Burnett's\r\nanswer to the first certified question. He has set forth the legal standard\r\nwhich should be used to define the term lottery as it appears in South\r\nCarolina's Constitution in a manner which is faithful to our Court's\r\nprecedents and well within the mainstream of American court decisions. I\r\nalso concur with Justice Burnett's answer to the second certified question in\r\nwhich he applies his definition of lottery to the machines in question and\r\nconcludes that Type II and Type III video gaming machines do constitute\r\nlotteries under our constitution. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHowever, I write separately to express the view that the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of South Carolina is free to answer the second\r\nquestion as Justice Burnett and I do. In order to explain this view, I concur\r\nonly in that portion of the majority's opinion which concludes that since the\r\nsecond certified question asks us to decide a factual question, no such finding\r\n will be binding on the federal district court for purposes of entry of any\r\npermanent injunction or award of damages. Since our opinions regarding the\r\napplication of any of the proposed tests are advisory, it is within the federal\r\ndistrict court's prerogative to decide whether Type II and Type III machines\r\nare unconstitutional. My own advice to the federal court is that under any\r\nof the definitions of lottery put forth by this Court today, Type II and Type\r\nIII machines are clearly unconstitutional in South Carolina. Each of these\r\npoints is discussed below. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA ADVISORY NATURE OF OPINIONS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe federal district court asked this Court to answer two certified\r\nquestions. The first question asked us to provide South Carolina's legal\r\ndefinition of a lottery. The second question asked us to apply that definition\r\nto the preliminary findings of fact in this case, i.e., to decide a factual\r\nquestion. In answering the second certified question, the majority advises the\r\nfederal district court that under their definition of lottery, the video poker\r\nmachines at issue here do not constitute lotteries under the South Carolina\r\nConstitution. Justice Burnett and I disagree with them. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs noted by Chief Justice Finney and stated in the Order of\r\nCertification, \"no finding of this Court will be binding for entry of any\r\npermanent injunction or for the award of damages by the District Court.\"\r\nThis Court may accept certified questions only to answer questions of law.\r\nRule 228(a), SCACR. Thus, this Court's determination of whether Type II \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.74\r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand Type III are in fact \"lotteries\" under our Constitution does not bind the\r\nfederal district court. This determination is ultimately in the hands of the\r\nfederal district court. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nB. APPLICATION OF THE MAJORITY TEST \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUnder Justice Burnett's test, in which I join, Type II and Type III\r\nmachines are clearly unconstitutional. The majority, on the other hand,\r\nadvises that under its test, Type II and Type III machines are not\r\nunconstitutional lotteries. However, I believe that even under the test\r\nproposed by the majority, the federal district court can conclude that Type II\r\nand Type III machines constitute a lottery under our Constitution. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe majority concludes that the video gaming machines are not\r\nunconstitutional lotteries because they do not involve (1) a drawing and (2)\r\n\"tickets\" or other indicium of entitlement to a prize. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlthough the majority finds that the video gaming machines do not\r\ninvolve a \"drawing,\" the majority fails to consider that the machines at issue\r\nhere function in the same manner as most modem popular lotteries. These\r\npopular lotteries involve a random generation of numbers to determine the\r\nwinning combination. The \"drawing\" does not depend upon the number of\r\npeople playing the lottery. As such, single person play would not negate the\r\nfact that a drawing takes place. Similarly, in this case, all of the video\r\ngaming machines are microprocessor based devices with random number\r\ngenerators. A player wins if the right combination of numbers is generated\r\nby the machine. Thus, a drawing occurs by the machines' random generation\r\nof numbers, irrespective of the number of people playing. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs for the second requirement of \"tickets,\" even the majority recognizes\r\nthat the definition of \"tickets\" should take into account modern technology.\r\nThe majority states in footnote 10 of its opinion that '[e]lectronic ticketing\r\nwould not necessarily preclude finding a lottery where electronic registration\r\nis the functional equivalent of a lottery ticket . . . .\" In the instant case,\r\nalthough a player does not receive an actual ticket or token prior to playing\r\nthe game, his opportunity to win is symbolized by the activation of the\r\nmachine upon the insertion of money and the compilation of his credits or\r\nplays displayed during the game. Upon the insertion of money, the machines\r\nreveal the player's monetary credit with that game. The machines keep track\r\nof the player's initial credit and any \"free plays\" the player wins during his\r\ngame. These credits are what the player exchanges with the store owner for\r\ncash. There is no practical difference between a physical ticket evidencing \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.75\r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe right to play for a prize and an electronic representation of such a right\r\nin the form of free play credits. Furthermore, the right to receive the cash\r\nprizes from the machine owners is physically represented by the ticket the\r\nplayer receives when he cashes out a game. That prize amount is limited by\r\nstatute. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFinally, although the majority opinion does not discuss the requirement\r\nof chance, it is patently clear Type II and Type III video machines would\r\nsatisfy even a pure chance standard. As stated in the Order of Certification,\r\nall of the machines are microprocessor based devices with random number\r\ngenerators. The random selections occur independent of the control or\r\ndirection of the, player, regardless of the player's skill, knowledge, or\r\nexperience. (Ord. p. 6-7). The bottom line is that a player cannot alter the\r\nprobabilities inherent in the play of Type I, Type II, or Type III video\r\nmachine games. (Ord. p. 10). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThus, in my view, under any of the tests proposed today, Type II and\r\nType III video game machines are illegal lotteries under the South Carolina\r\nConstitution. Of course, the final application of the law to the facts of this\r\ncase rests wholly within the discretion of the federal district court. It may v\r\nery well be that the federal district court, having asked our advice on the\r\napplication of our lottery test to the facts before it, will accept the advice of\r\nthe majority. I simply express the view that these opinions give the federal\r\ndistrict court a range of choices. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nC. CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlthough no solid consensus has been reached in this case, the\r\nmembers of this Court have attempted with mutual respect and in utter good\r\nfaith to reconcile our positions on the South Carolina Constitution's anti-\r\nlottery provision and its application to video gaming machines. As part of t\r\nhe judicial branch of government, our role is limited to discerning the\r\nmeaning and application of existing law. Naturally, interpretations may vary\r\namong members of any court. My profound disagreement with my brothers\r\nin the majority is matched by my enduring respect for their sincerity and\r\nintegrity. Although many appellate courts transform passionate philosophical\r\ndisagreement into permanent rupture of the court's collegiality,1e this Court \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1e See E. Lazarus, Closed Chambers: The First Eyewitness Account of the \r\nEpic Struggles Inside the Supreme Court, Times Books, Random House, 1999.\r\nIn an act of consummate disloyalty to the court he once served, the author,\r\na former law clerk, describes bitter division within our highest court. \r\n  \r\np.76 \r\n  \r\n\r\nJohnson et al. v. Collins Entertainment Company, Inc. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill not splinter over any given opinion.2e We have each considered and\r\ncirculated many drafts of these opinions. I offer this glimpse into the\r\ndeliberations of conference in order to underscore the complexity of this\r\nmatter and gravity of our consideration. We are greatly divided on this case,\r\nbut one truth about our Constitution in which we are all united is that we\r\nhave no role to play in answering the broader policy questions of whether\r\nvideo gaming machines and other lotteries should be allowed, prohibited, or\r\nregulated in South Carolina. These policy decisions can only be made by the\r\nstatutory enactment of the General Assembly, regulatory action of the\r\nexecutive agencies so empowered, or by further Constitutional mandate of the\r\npeople of South Carolina. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2e Eminent contemporary southern historian Dr. Walter Edgar proposes\r\nas his working thesis for South Carolina: A History, University of South\r\nCarolina Press, 1998, that the hallmark of South Carolinians is our impulse\r\nto conduct ourselves so as to achieve \"the good order and harmony of the\r\n whole community.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.77\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24855","title":"State v.

Charping, 313 S.C. 147, 437 S.E.2d 88 (1993) (Charping I).\r\nCharping was again convicted of murder and sentenced to death. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCharping, along with cohorts Jeffrey Whitlock, and John Thoman,\r\nabducted Joann Pruitt, the victim in this case, and drove her to an isolated\r\narea near a pond in Lexington County, where she was raped, tortured, and\r\ndrowned. The facts are set forth more fully in Issue 1. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUpon his retrial, Charping was again convicted of murder. The jury\r\nfound the aggravating circumstances of kidnapping and torture and\r\nrecommended a sentence of death. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. Did the Court err in ruling Charping could not comment on\r\nthe State's failure to call Jeffrey Whitlock as a witness? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2. Did the Court err in refusing to permit Charping to introduce\r\nevidence of Whitlock's convictions and life sentence? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3. Did the Court err in requiring Charping to decide, prior to the\r\nsolicitor's sentencing phase closing argument, whether he would\r\npersonally address the jury? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. COMMENT ON FAILURE TO CALL WITNESS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCharping's cohort, Jeffrey Whitlock pled guilty to murder, kidnapping,\r\ncriminal sexual conduct, and criminal conspiracy for which he was sentenced\r\nto life imprisonment, thirty years, and five years. Whitlock was not called\r\nas a witness at trial either by the state or by Charping. Charping contends\r\nthe trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow him, at sentencing,\r\nto comment on the state's failure to call Whitlock as a witness. We disagree.\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, we find no abuse of discretion in the \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Charping's murder conviction was reversed under an in favorem vitae\r\nreview for the failure to obtain an on-the-record waiver of his right to make\r\nthe final argument to the jury. His remaining convictions were not subject\r\nto an in favorem review and were therefore unaffected by our reversal. \r\n  \r\np.2\r\n\r\nSTATE v. CHARPING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrial court's ruling. State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997)\r\n(trial judge vested with broad discretion in determining propriety of closing\r\nargument; rulings on such matters will not be disturbed absent showing\r\nimproper closing deprived defendant a fair trial). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Court has previously stated \"it is always proper for an attorney\r\n in argument to the jury to point out the failure of a party to call a witness.\"\r\nState v. Hammond, 270 S.C. 347, 356, 242 S.E.2d 411, 415 (1978). See also\r\nState v. Bamberg, 270 S.C. 77, 240 S.E.2d 639 (1977) (comment on failure to\r\nproduce witness permissible); State v. Cook, 283 S.C. 594, 325 S.E.2d 323\r\n(1985) (no error in allowing solicitor to comment on defendant's failure to\r\nproduce his wife); State v. Shackleford, 228 S.C. 9, 88 S.E.2d 778 (1955) (not\r\n improper for prosecutor to comment upon defendant's failure to produce\r\nwitnesses, accessible to the accused, or under his control, whose testimony\r\nwould substantiate his story).2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHowever, in Davis v. Sparks, 235 S.C. 326, 333, 111 S.E.2d 545, 549\r\n(1959), we recognized the general rule that \"a party is not to be prejudiced\r\nby his failure to call a witness who is equally available to the other party.\"\r\nCiting 20 Am.Jur. 193 Evidence, Â§ 189. See also Baker v. Port City Steel\r\nErectors, 261 S.C. 469, 200 S.E.2d 681 (1973)(unfavorable inference arising\r\nfrom failure of a party to call an available material witness may be drawn\r\nonly where under all circumstances of case the failure to produce such\r\nwitness creates suspicion of a wilful attempt to withhold competent evidence).\r\n Here, Whitlock was clearly accessible to both the state and  the defense, and\r\nthere is no reason Charping could not have called him as a witness.3 \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Generally, the situation arises, for example, when the defendant claims\r\nan alibi or insanity defense, then fails to call a witness who would either\r\nhave provided the alibi, State v. Bamberg, supra, or who had knowledge of\r\nhis mental condition. State v. Cook, supra. A similar result has occurred\r\nwhen police fail to call an arresting officer. State v. Peden 157 S.C. 459, 154\r\nS.E. 658 (1930). See also Canady v. Martschink Beer Distributors, 255 S.C.\r\n119, 177 S.E.2d 475 (1970) (generally, the rule is applied when the uncalled\r\nwitness is a relative of the party failing to call such witness, or within some\r\ndegree of control of said party). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 In fact, when the solicitor objected to Charping commenting on the\r\nstate's failure to call Whitlock as a witness, claiming Whitlock was \"just as\r\navailable to them as he is to us,\" defense counsel replied, \"Mr. Myers can\r\ncomment on my failure to call him. That's exactly right.\" There was no\r\nsuggestion at trial that Whitlock was unavailable to the defense. \r\n  \r\np.3\r\n\r\nSTATE v. CHARPING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, under these circumstances, we find the trial court acted within\r\nits discretion in limiting Charping's comment. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMoreover, an adverse inference from the unexplained failure of a party\r\nto call an available witness is generally held not warranted where the\r\nmaterial facts assumed to be within the knowledge of the absent witness\r\nhave been testified to by other qualified witnesses. State v. Watts, 249 S.C.\r\n80, 152 S.E.2d 684 (1967). Here, the material facts were testified to by John\r\nand Vanessa Thoman. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nJohn Thoman, who was with Charping and Whitlock the night of the\r\nmurder, gave detail, as follows. He testified that the victim, Joann Pruitt,\r\nhad gone with them to help them purchase a small quantity of marijuana.\r\nAfter purchasing the marijuana, they stopped at a convenience store to\r\npurchase cigarette rolling papers. While at the store, Charping told him he\r\nhad decided to kill the victim. Thoman testified Charping pulled the victim\r\nfrom the car and started beating her \"upside the head\" two or three times\r\nuntil she fell to the ground. Charping then told him and Whitlock\r\nhe intended to rape the victim and brought her into the woods.4 Charping\r\nbrought the victim out of the woods 15-20 minutes later and told her she was\r\ngoing to have sex with all three men. Charping then brought her back into\r\nthe woods and called for Whitlock and Thoman approximately 10 minutes\r\nlater, at which time Whitlock went into the woods while he, Thoman, stayed\r\nat the car. Thoman went into the woods approximately 30 minutes later\r\nwhere he saw the victim on her hands and knees naked, with Charping\r\nstanding above her punching her in the head, upper body and back, while\r\nWhitlock claimed he was going to have anal sex with her. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThoman returned to the car briefly then went back to the woods a few\r\nminutes later at which point Charping had a stick, similar to a log, 3-4 feet\r\nlong and 4-5 inches in diameter which he was holding like a baseball bat and\r\nhitting the victim \"everywhere he could.\" Whitlock then picked up a stick\r\nand joined in on the beating for 4 or 5 minutes. Charping ordered the victim\r\nto stand up and started pushing her in her back with his stick towards the\r\npond. Near the pond, Charping told her to stop and bent over and cleared\r\nan area in the pine straw. Charping made the victim get down into the\r\ncleared area and began hitting and kicking her again, using all his strength,\r\ntaking 2-3 steps back and coming up to kick her. Whitlock joined in and hit\r\nher once or twice, and then took a stick and rammed it between the victim's \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 Thoman never actually saw Charping raping the victim and the\r\nsentencing phase jury did not find the aggravating circumstance of CSC. \r\n  \r\np.4\r\n\r\nSTATE v. CHARPING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegs. Finally, Charping and Whitlock ceased beating the victim when she\r\nwas curled up like a ball with her hands over her head. Charping forced her\r\nonto her stomach and grabbed her around the neck with both hands and\r\ntried to break her neck. Charping then asked her how she wanted to die and\r\nhow she liked being raped. He commented to Whitlock and Thoman that the\r\nvictim wouldn't die and asked them for a knife, which neither had. Charping\r\nthen straddled the victim and placed a log across her neck and started\r\nforcing down on it with \"all his might,\" attempting to strangle her. When\r\nthis didn't kill her, he forced her to her feet and walked her out into the\r\npond. He placed his leg over her back and forced her head under the water,\r\nthen let her up for a second or two. He then pushed her back under the\r\nwater for 3-4 minutes until she was dead. He dragged the victim's body back\r\nto shore by the hair and covered her with pine straw. The three gathered\r\nthe victim's clothes and went to the car. Charping told Whitlock and\r\nThoman that if they told anyone about the murder, he'd kill them too. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThoman's sister, Vanessa Thoman, who was Charping's girlfriend at the\r\ntime of the murder, also testified at trial. Although she did not witness the\r\nmurder, she testified she went back to the murder scene with Charping to\r\nbury the body because she didn't believe him when he told her he'd killed\r\nsomeone. When they got to the victim's body and Vanessa attempted CPR,\r\nCharping told her \"If you bring her back, I will kill her again,\" and that if\r\nshe, Vanessa, screamed, he would kill her too. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs summarized, it is clear the material facts were testified to by John\r\nand Vanessa Thoman such that no adverse inference was warranted by the\r\nstate's failure to call Whitlock as a witness. State v. Watts, supra.\r\nAccordingly, the court committed no error in disallowing the comment. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFinally, given the testimony of the Thomans, indicating the incredible\r\nbrutality and torture inflicted upon Joann Pruitt by Charping, we find his\r\n inability to comment on the state's failure to call Whitlock could not have\r\naffected the result. Accordingly, any conceivable error was harmless beyond\r\na reasonable doubt. Accord Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157,  420 S.E.2d 834\r\n (1992)(error is harmless where, beyond a reasonable doubt, it did not\r\ncontribute to verdict obtained). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2. CO-DEFENDANT'S SENTENCE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCharping next asserts he should have been permitted to introduce\r\nevidence Whitlock received a life sentence, contending it was relevant to the\r\ncircumstances of the crime, and the aggravating circumstance of criminal \r\n  \r\np.5\r\n\r\nSTATE v. CHARPING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsexual conduct. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe sentencing jury in a capital case may not be precluded from\r\nconsidering as mitigating evidence any aspect of the defendant's character or\r\nrecord and any circumstances of the crime that may serve as a basis for a\r\nsentence less than death. State v. Bell, 305 S.C. 11, 406 S.E.2d 165 (1991),\r\ncert. denied 502 U.S. 1038 (1992). A codefendant's \"demeanor\" does not fall\r\nwithin this category of evidence. Id. We find evidence Whitlock was\r\nsentenced to life is irrelevant to establish Charping's character, and does not\r\ndemonstrate the \"circumstances of the crime.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCharping cites State v. Brewington, 267 S.C. 97, 103, 226 S.E.2d 249,\r\n251 (1976) for the proposition that \"the sentence imposed upon a codefendant\r\nfor the same offense and upon others for similar offenses are among a wide\r\nvariety of factors which may be properly considered in determining a proper\r\npunishment.\" Brewington is inapposite. Brewington merely held the trial\r\ncourt did not commit reversible error in considering, among other factors, the\r\nsentence of an accomplice; Brewington does not stand for the proposition that\r\ntrial courts are required to consider the sentences of codefendants. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFurther, Brewington is not a death penalty case. In South Carolina,\r\nthe function of conducting a proportionality review in death penalty cases is\r\nfor this Court. S.C. Code Ann.Â§ 16-3-25. Accordingly, it is not for the jury\r\nin a capital case to weigh the sentence of similarly situated defendants.\r\nAccord Brogdon v. Blackburn, 790 F.2d 1164 (5th Cir. 1986) (codefendant's\r\nlife sentence not relevant to defendant's character or offense; fact is relevant\r\nonly to the task of comparing the proportionality of Brogdon's sentence to the\r\nsentences of others similarly situated, a function assigned by statute to State\r\nSupreme Court). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFinally, a number of courts hold a co-defendant's acquittal or life\r\nsentence is not a relevant mitigating circumstance. See e.g., State v. Bond,\r\n478 S.E.2d 163 (N.C. 1996) (accomplices' punishment is not an aspect of the\r\ndefendant's character or record nor a mitigating circumstance of the\r\nparticular offense); Roche v. State, 596 N.E.2d 896 (Ind. 1992); State v. Berry,\r\n650 N.E.2d 433 (Ohio 1995); People v. Carrera, 777 P.2d 121 (Cal. 1989);\r\nJohnson v. State, 477 So. 2d 196 (Miss. 1985); Commonwealth v. Frey, 554\r\nA.2d 27 (Pa. 1989)(codefendant's life sentence not a mitigating circumstance\r\nas to defendant's role in crime). We agree with the reasoning of these courts. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial court properly excluded evidence of Whitlock's convictions and \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.6\r\n\r\nSTATE v. CHARPING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsentence.5 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3. FINAL JURY ARGUMENT \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFinally, Charping claims his waiver of the right to address the jury\r\nwas rendered involuntary by the trial court's requirement that he decide,\r\nprior to the solicitor's closing argument, whether he wished to exercise the\r\nright. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann.Â§ 16-3-28 requires \"in any criminal trial where the\r\nmaximum penalty is death or in a separate sentencing proceeding following\r\nsuch trial, the defendant and his counsel shall have the right to make the\r\nlast argument.\" We have repeatedly held there must be a knowing and\r\nvoluntary waiver of the right to final argument on-the-record.6 See State v.\r\nOrr, 304 S.C. 185, 403 S.E.2d 623 (1991); State v. Reed, 293 S.C. 515, 362\r\nS.E.2d 13 (1987). However, we have never held, nor does the statute require,\r\nthe decision whether to personally address the jury must be made after the\r\nsolicitor's closing.7 We find it is within the trial court's discretion to require\r\na decision after the presentation of evidence, but prior to the state's closing\r\nargument. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMoreover, the record is abundantly clear Charping was well aware of \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n5 We do not suggest that evidence of a codefendant's participation may\r\nnot be mitigating. However, although a codefendant's participation might\r\nbe relevant to the circumstances of the offense and therefore mitigating, the\r\nfact that codefendants received lesser sentences could no more be considered\r\nmitigating than could the fact that a codefendant received the death penalty\r\nbe aggravating. Accord State v. Gerald, 549 A.2d 792 (N.J. 1988). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n6 Charping's original murder conviction was reversed for this reason.\r\nSee Charping I. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n7 The cases cited by Charping are inapplicable. He cites Brooks v.\r\nTennessee, 406 U.S. 605 (1972) and Ferguson v. Georgia, 365 U.S. 570 (1961),\r\nboth of which involved the decision on whether to exercise the right to\r\ntestify. In Brooks, the Court invalidated a Tennessee statute which required\r\nthe defendant, if he planned to, to testify prior to any other testimony for the\r\ndefense. The Court held this required a premature decision precluding an\r\ninformed tactical decision based on all the evidence offered at trial. A\r\nsolicitor's closing argument is not evidence. Sossebee v. Leeke 293 S.C. 531,\r\n362 S.E.2d 322 (1987). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np7\r\n\r\nSTATE v. CHARPING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis right to personally address the jury and that his waiver of that right was\r\nknowing and voluntary. Although he would have preferred to make a\r\ndecision following closing arguments, there is absolutely no evidence he did\r\nnot understand his right, or that the decision was not knowing and\r\nvoluntary. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCharping's conviction for murder is affirmed.8 Pursuant to S.C. Code\r\nAnn.Â§ 16-3-25(c)(1985), we find the death sentence in this case is\r\nproportionate to that in similar cases and is neither excessive nor\r\ndisproportionate to the crime. State v.

NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLawrence Warmoth died April 25, 1993, when he was shot three\r\ntimes in the head while lying alone in his own bed. Investigators discovered\r\nno murder weapon, no eyewitnesses, and no physical evidence linking\r\nappellant to the crime. The key evidence against appellant was the\r\ntestimony of Nancy P. Smith, appellant's girlfriend at the time and the\r\nmother of appellant's young son. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMs. Smith offered the following testimony:  Appellant frequently\r\nsaid he hated Mr. Warmoth, his stepfather, and talked about killing him or\r\nhaving him killed. Appellant borrowed her car and left her apartment at\r\n10:30 p.m. to go to work April 24, 1993. Upon his return a few hours later\r\nat 3:30 a.m., appellant told her that he \"was taking care of some business,\r\nhe was finally taking care of his family.\" Appellant later told her that he\r\nexpected his mother, Sandra Needs Warmoth, to give him $100,000 in\r\nproceeds from his stepfather's life insurance policies to start a business. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNearly two weeks after the murder, appellant confessed to Ms.\r\nSmith that he had killed his stepfather. Appellant described the shooting to\r\nher in detail, saying he walked in the house, down the hall, and asked his\r\nstepfather for money to go to the store. Appellant told her that his\r\nstepfather began to sit up in bed and said \"Scott what?\" just before appellant\r\nshot him three times in the head. Appellant told her that he used \"exploding\r\nbullets,\" which police could not trace to him. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAn investigator testified he interviewed appellant at his\r\nstepfather's house shortly after police were called to the scene. Appellant\r\nstated he was with Ms. Smith the night of the murder, except from 11 p.m.\r\nto 12:30 a.m. when he went to a fast food restaurant. He did not admit any\r\ninvolvement in the murder. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State's theory of the case was that appellant killed his\r\nstepfather because he hated him and wanted a share of the life insurance\r\nproceeds. The defense's theory was that police did a sloppy investigation, and\r\nMs. Smith implicated appellant because she was angry he planned to marry\r\nanother woman. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.10\r\n\r\nSTATE v.

Did the trial judge err in admitting evidence of\r\ninsurance policies on the victim's life? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n5.

SMITH \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMs. Smith initially provided an alibi for appellant, at his urging,\r\nby telling police he was with her the night of the murder, except from 11:30\r\np m. to 12:30 a.m. Ms. Smith told police about appellant's confession to her\r\nin August 1993, four months after the murder. She admitted lying in her\r\ninitial statement. Ms. Smith changed her statement again in May 1994,\r\ngiving police a similar statement which implicated appellant, but insisting\r\nappellant had couched his entire story in \"hypothetical\" terms. The State\r\ncalled the case for trial in June 1994.1 At a pretrial hearing, Ms. Smith \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1The case did not go to trial until September 1995 because the\r\n (continued... \r\n  \r\np11\r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecanted her statements about appellant's confession to her and testified\r\nappellant was with her when his stepfather was murdered. She also\r\nproduced a diary describing that evening with appellant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMs. Smith testified against appellant as described above at the\r\nSeptember 1995 trial. On cross examination, she admitted her testimony\r\ndirectly conflicted with the testimony  she gave at the June 1994 pretrial\r\nhearing. The diary she testified about at the pretrial hearing was a fake,\r\ncreatedat appellant's suggestion, Ms. Smith testified. She no longer was\r\nscared to testify against appellant because she had remarried, Ms. Smith told\r\njurors. In short, Ms. Smith was first a potential witness for appellant, then\r\na potential witness for the State, then a potential witness for appellant, and\r\n-- finally -- an actual witness for the State at trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant contends the trial judge erred in denying his motion to\r\nprevent Ms. Smith from testifying because she was not competent under Rule\r\n601(b)(2), SCRE. Her conflicting statements to police and admissions of\r\nperjury made her incompetent because she did not understand the duty of a\r\nwitness to tell the truth. The Court should not uphold a conviction based\r\nsolely on the testimony of a \"pathological liar,\" appellant asserts. We\r\ndisagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise\r\nprovided by statute or these rules.\" Rule 601(a), SCRE. Courts presume a\r\nwitness to be competent because bias or other defects in a witness's testimony\r\n-- revealed primarily through cross examination -- affect a witness's credibility\r\nand may be weighed by the factfinder. See State v. Smith, 199 S.C. 279,\r\n282, 19 S.E.2d 224, 225 (1942) (\"the established practice [is] to allow a rather\r\nfull and thorough cross-examination of the witnesses for both the State and\r\nthe defendant in the criminal Courts by way of questions tending to test\r\nmemory, veracity or credibility\"); accord Mueller and Kirkpatrick, Modern \r\nEvidence, Â§ 6.1 (1995); 98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 458 (1957). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA witness must have personal knowledge of the matter and must\r\nswear or affirm to tell the truth.

Notes to Rule 601, SCRE. Even\r\na convicted perjurer may testify as long as he or she meets the minimum\r\nstandard. See State v. Merriman, 287 S.C. 74, 337 S.E.2d 218 (Ct. App.\r\n1985) (explaining the abolition of the prohibition against testimony by a\r\nconvicted perjurer). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA proposed witness understands the duty to tell the truth when\r\nhe states that he knows that it is right to tell the truth and wrong to lie,\r\nthat he will tell the truth if permitted to testify, and that he fears\r\npunishment if he does lie, even if that fear is motivated solely by the perjury\r\nstatute. State v. Green, 267 S.C. 599, 606, 230 S.E.2d 618, 621 (1976). As\r\nsuccinctly explained by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in order to be\r\ncompetent to testify, a witness must have the ability (1) to perceive the event\r\nwith a substantial degree of accuracy, (2) remember it, (3) communicate\r\nabout it intelligibly, and (4) be mindful of the duty to tell the truth under oath.\r\nPennsylvania v. Goldblum, 447 A.2d 234) 239 (Pa. 1982). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe party opposing the witness has the burden of proving a\r\nwitness is incompetent. Pennsylvania v. Goldblum, supra. The\r\ndetermination of a witness's competency to testify is a question for the trial\r\ncourt, and the trial court's decision will not be overturned absent an abuse\r\nof discretion. State v. Camele, 293 S.C. 302, 360 S.E.2d 307 (1987); State v. \r\nGreen, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn this case, Ms. Smith swore to tell the truth and had personal\r\nknowledge of the matter. The trial judge stated he believed, based upon Ms.\r\nSmith's in camera testimony, that she understood her duty to tell the truth.\r\nWhen questioned by the judge, Ms. Smith stated outside the jury's presence\r\nthat she understood her duty to tell the truth, and that she would face\r\nperjury charges if she lied in court. The trial judge did not abuse his \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Rule 601(b) also requires the proposed witness to be capable of\r\nexpressing himself to the judge and jury, as was required prior to the\r\nadoption of the Rules of Evidence. See Abbott v. Columbia Mills Co., 110\r\nS.C. 298, 96 S.E. 556 (1918); 97 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§49 (1957). That\r\nprovision is not at issue in this case. \r\n  \r\np.13\r\n\r\nSTATE v.

See State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 16, 482 S.E.2d 760,\r\n765 (\"inquiry as to the weight a juror would give one kind of witness over\r\nanother invades the jury's province to determine credibility\"), cert. denied,\r\n118 S.Ct. 146, 139 L.Ed.2d 92 (1997); State v.

Torrence, 305 S.C.\r\n45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). \"[T]his Court has more than once held that the\r\njury is the judge of which contradictory statement of the witness is the\r\ntruth.\" Soulios v. Mills Novelty Co., 19S S.C. 355, 364, 17 S.E.2d 869, 874\r\n(1941). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe prosecutor and appellant questioned Ms. Smith extensively\r\nabout her conflicting statements. Ms. Smith testified she lied in her initial\r\nstatement to police; she lied when she modified her August 1993 statement\r\nto say appellant had been speaking \"hypothetically\"; and her testimony at\r\ntrial directly conflicted with her testimony at the June 1994 pretrial hearing.\r\nShe told jurors she was testifying truthfully at the trial. While Ms. Smith's\r\ncredibility conceivably was in shreds, it was for the jury to decide whether\r\nto believe her testimony after the trial judge properly ruled she was\r\ncompetent to testify. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter changing her statement several times, Ms. Smith testified\r\nas an alibi witness for appellant at a pretrial hearing in June 1994. A grand\r\njury later indicted Ms. Smith on charges of obstruction of justice, accessory\r\nafter the fact of a felony, and misprision of a felony. Ms. Smith agreed to\r\nplead guilty to misprision of a felony, and the State planned to dismiss the\r\nother indictments.3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 The trial judge sentenced Ms. Smith to eighteen months in prison\r\non the charge of misprision of a felony at the end of appellant's trial.\r\nThree months later, before Ms. Smith had reported to prison, the judge\r\n(continued . . .) \r\n  \r\np.14 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in denying his motion to\r\ndismiss the indictments against him due to prosecutorial misconduct. The\r\nprosecutor committed misconduct by charging Ms. Smith with crimes after\r\nshe testified in appellant's favor at the pretrial hearing. Those charges were\r\nimproper attempts to intimidate Ms. Smith into testifying as a State's\r\nwitness, appellant contends.  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nChallenges alleging prosecutorial misconduct typically involve a\r\nprosecutor's improper efforts to collect evidence or unfair trial tactics. E.g.\r\nState v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d 114 (1997) (prosecutor in closing\r\nargument discussed statements that were not in evidence); State v. Chisolm,\r\n312 S.C. 235, 439 S.E.2d 850 (1994) (prosecutor improperly and secretly taped\r\ntelephone conversation with defendant, who had called prosecutor but had an\r\nattorney); State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991) (prosecutor\r\nallegedly used previously suppressed evidence at trial); State v. Atkins, 303\r\nS.C. 214, 399 S.E.2d 760 (1990) (prosecutor allegedly obtained confidential\r\nmedical records in violation of attorney-client privilege); State v. Pee Dee\r\nNews Co., 286 S.C. 562, 336 S.E.2d 8 (1985) (prosecutor asked improper\r\nhypothetical questions at trial); State v. Craig, 267 S.C. 262, 227 S.E.2d 306\r\n(1976) (prosecutor's conduct at trial allegedly was calculated to arouse unfair\r\nprejudice against defendant). This case is somewhat unusual because\r\nappellant challenges the use of one of the most fundamental powers of a\r\nprosecutor -- the power to bring charges against a person the prosecutor\r\nbelieves has committed a crime. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"In the ordinary case, so long as the prosecutor has probable\r\ncause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the\r\ndecision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before\r\na grand jury, generally rests entirely in his discretion.\" United States\r\nv. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 1486, 134 L.Ed.2d 687, 698 (1996)\r\n(quoting Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 364, 98 S.Ct. 663, 668, 54\r\nL.Ed.2d 604, 611 (1978)). A prosecutor's discretion is subject to constitutional\r\nconstraints. A prosecutor may not, for instance, base the decision to\r\nprosecute on unjustifiable standards such as race, religion, or other arbitrary\r\nclassifications. Id.; accord United States v. Olvis, 97 F.3d 739 (4th Cir. 1996); \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n3(.. continued)\r\nchanged the sentence to ten years in prison, suspended upon the service of\r\nninety days, with five years probation. \r\n  \r\np.15 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v.

Nor may a prosecutor lob baseless\r\nthreats or charges at a potential defense witness in an effort to prevent the\r\nwitness from testifying. See State v. Williams, 326 S.C. 130, 485 S.E.2d 99\r\n(1997) (improper intimidation of witness may violate defendant's due process\r\nright to present defense witnesses freely if the intimidation amounts to\r\nsubstantial government interference with witness's free and unhampered\r\nchoice to testify); Annot., 88 A.L.R.4th 3S8 (1991) (collecting cases on\r\nimproper intimidation). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"[T]he South Carolina Constitution4 and South Carolina case law5\r\nplace the unfettered discretion to prosecute solely in the prosecutor's hands.\r\n. . . Prosecutors may pursue a case to trial, or they may plea bargain it down\r\nto a lesser offense, or they may simply decide not to prosecute the offense in\r\nits entirety. The Judicial Branch is, not empowered to infringe on the\r\nexercise of this prosecutorial discretion; however, on occasion, it is necessary\r\nto review and interpret the results of the prosecutor's actions.\" State v. \r\nThrift, 312 S.C. 282, 291-92, 440 S.E.2d 341, 346 (1994). Furthermore, a\r\ntrial court generally has no power to dismiss a properly drawn indictment\r\nissued by a properly constituted grand jury before trial unless a statute\r\ngrants that power to the court. The prosecutor may, of course, request the\r\ndismissal of an indictment or charge. State v. Ridge, 269 S.C. 61, 236 S.E.2d\r\n401 (1977); Ex Parte State, 263 S.C. 363, 210 S.E.2d 600 (1974). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the evidence showed that Ms. Smith had concealed\r\ninformation and lied to investigators to protect appellant, facts she ultimately\r\nadmitted at trial. The prosecutor had probable cause to believe Ms. Smith\r\nhad committed one or more of the indicted crimes, and he did not commit\r\nmisconduct by pursuing the charges. The trial judge properly rejected\r\nappellant's dismissal motion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the alternative, appellant argues the trial judge should have\r\nsuppressed Ms. Smith's testimony because it obviously was not reliable. This\r\nargument is another way of asserting Ms. Smith was not competent to testify. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 24. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 State v.

NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs explained in Issue 1, the trial judge properly determined Ms. Smith was\r\ncompetent to testify and her credibility was a question for the jury. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3. NEW RULES OF EVIDENCE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The State called appellant's case for trial in June 1994. The\r\nState asked the Honorable John C. Hayes, III, in a pretrial motion to qualify\r\nMs. Smith as a court's witness so that the State could cross examine and\r\nimpeach her.6 Judge Hayes denied the State's motion after a hearing because\r\nMs. Smith was not an eyewitness to the crime. The State appealed Judge\r\nHayes' decision because, without Ms. Smith's testimony, the State likely \r\n  \r\nwould not survive a directed verdict motion at trial.7 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State asked this Court to dismiss the appeal August 9, 1995,\r\nsaying the recent adoption of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence rendered \r\n  \r\n\r\n6 Under the law then in effect, a party could not impeach the\r\nparty's own witness unless the court declared the witness to be hostile. A\r\nparty had to show actual surprise and harm, however, in order to have a\r\nwitness declared hostile. See State v. Anderson, 304 S.C. 551, 406 S.E.2d\r\n152 (1991), superseded in part by Rules of Evidence as noted in State v. \r\nByram, 326 S.C. 107, 114 n.7, 485 S.E.2d 360, 363 n.7 (1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State knew Ms. Smith intended to recant her statement, which\r\nmeant the State would be unable to show surprise at trial. The State\r\nwanted to qualify Ms. Smith as a court's witness in order to impeach her.\r\nTo do so, the State had to show (1) the prosecution is unwilling to vouch\r\nfor the veracity or integrity of the witness, (2) there is a close relationship\r\nbetween the accused and the prospective court's witness, (3) there is\r\nevidence that the proposed witness was an eyewitness to the act giving\r\nrise to the prosecution, (4) the witness gave a sworn statement concerning\r\nthe relevant facts which have been, or will probably be contradicted, and\r\n(5) the absence of the witness' testimony would likely result in a\r\nmiscarriage of justice. Riddle v. State, 314 S.C. 1, 7, 443 S.E.2d 557, 561\r\n(1994). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n7 See State v. McKnight, 287 S.C. 167, 337 S.E.2d 208 (1985) (the\r\nState may immediately appeal a pretrial order granting the suppression of\r\nevidence which significantly impairs the prosecution of a criminal case). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.17\r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe appeal moot.8 The Court dismissed the appeal August 15, 1995. The\r\nnew Rules of Evidence took effect September 3, 1995. The State again called\r\nappellant's case for trial September 26, 1995. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant asked the trial judge to prohibit Ms. Smith from\r\ntestifying. He asserted that Judge Hayes had refused to qualify Ms. Smith\r\nas a court's witness and,prohibited the State from impeaching her testimony.\r\nThose rulings were the law of the case because the State had abandoned the\r\nappeal, appellant argued. The trial judge denied appellant's motion,\r\nconcluding the new Rules of Evidence applied to appellant's trial. Under\r\nRule 607, SCRE, \"[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party,\r\nincluding the party calling the witness.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant now argues the trial judge erred in denying his motion.\r\nIf the State pursued a frivolous appeal of Judge Hayes' order simply to delay\r\nmatters until the new Rules of Evidence took effect, the Court should not\r\nsanction such conduct by awarding the State a \"windfall\" by its decision. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe find appellant's arguments unconvincing for three reasons.\r\nFirst, courts generally agree that trials occurring before the effective date of\r\nnew evidence rules are controlled by the rules or case law in effect at the\r\ntime of trial. New evidence rules usually apply to trials that occur after\r\nthose rules take effect. See State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 114 n.7, 485\r\nS.E.2d 360, 363 n.7 (1997) (applying case law in effect at time of defendant's\r\ntrial, not new Rule 607 on impeachment that took effect later); North \r\nCarolina v. McDonald, 321 S.E.2d 849, 852 n. 1 (N.C. 1984) (same); Tuer v. \r\nMcDonald, 684 A.2d 478, 482 n.2 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1996) (applying new\r\nevidence rules to case tried after new rules took effect), aff'd, 701 A.2d 1101\r\n(Md. 1997).9 Nothing in the Rules of Evidence indicates the Court intended\r\nto delay application of the rules under these circumstances. The rules took\r\neffect about three weeks before appellant stood trial, more than enough time \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n8 The State's letter is not in the record of this case, but is contained\r\nin the Court's files. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n9 Accord North Carolina v. Riddick, 340 S.E.2d 422, 424 n.1 (N.C.\r\n1986); Utah v. Smith, 726 P.2d 1232, 1236 n.4 (Utah 1986); New Jersey v. \r\nKately, 637 A.2d 214, 216 n.1 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1994); In Re \r\nWelfare of Bennett, 600 P.2d 1308, 1311 (Wash. Ct. App. 1979). \r\n  \r\np.18 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor appellant to receive notice of them. Cf. State v. Von Dohlen., 322 S.C.\r\n234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (refusing to conduct in favorem vitae review in death\r\npenalty case where defendant, whose trial began day the Court issued an\r\nopinion abolishing such reviews, had notice of that abolition), cert. denied\r\n117 S.Ct. 402, 136 L.Ed.2d 316 (1996). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSecond, Judge Hayes did not rule that the State could not\r\nimpeach Ms. Smith. He only denied the State's motion to qualify Ms. Smith\r\nas a court's witness. Although the effect of that ruling prevented the State\r\nfrom impeaching Ms. Smith under existing case law, that was not the judge's\r\nactual ruling. Consequently, there was no impeachment ruling that could\r\nbecome the law of the case. In any event, the State did not impeach Ms.\r\nSmith at trial because she freely admitted on direct examination that she\r\ninitially lied to police and offered directly conflicting testimony at the pretrial\r\nhearing. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThird, appellant offers no evidence showing the State pursued a\r\nfrivolous appeal of Judge Hayes' order to delay the trial until the new rules\r\ntook effect. Both parties filed their final briefs in November 1994, and the\r\nappeal was proceeding in the usual manner when the State asked the Court\r\nto dismiss it. In sum, the trial judge properly applied the new Rules of\r\nEvidence at appellant's trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n4 LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant asked the trial judge to exclude all testimony  about\r\ninsurance policies on his stepfather's life because appellant did not know\r\nabout the policies and did not stand to derive any benefit from them.  He\r\nalso argued that evidence of the policies would be highly prejudicial. The\r\ntrial judge initially excluded testimony about the insurance policies, but later\r\nreversed his ruling and allowed the testimony under Rule 801(d)(2), SCRE. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMs. Smith testified appellant told her that his mother, Mrs.\r\nWarmoth, \"owed a lot of people money.\"  Appellant said killing his stepfather\r\nwould allow his mother to collect $260,000 from his stepfather's life insurance\r\npolicies. He also said his mother intended to give him $100,00 of the\r\nproceeds to start a business, Ms. Smith testified. Joyce Floyd, the personnel\r\nmanager at the stepfather's employer, testified the stepfather had a $20,000\r\npolicy naming Mrs. Warmoth as the beneficiary. Carolyn Cooley, personnel\r\nmanager at Mrs. Warmoth's employer, testified Mrs. Warmoth had an \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.19\r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadditional $190,000 policy on her husband when he died. That policy also\r\nnamed Mrs. Warmoth as the beneficiary. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in admitting testimony\r\nabout the life insurance policies because there was no competent evidence\r\nshowing appellant stood to derive a benefit from the policies. The jury could\r\nhave disregarded Ms. Smith's unreliable testimony, but the objective\r\ntestimony of the personnel managers improperly bolstered Ms. Smith's\r\ntestimony and \"created the illusion of a nexus between appellant and the\r\ninsurance policies.\" We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State is not required to prove motive in a homicide prosecution.\r\nState v. Damon, 285 S.C.125, 328 S.E.2d 628 (1985), overruled \r\non other grounds, State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991); State \r\nv. Underwood, 127 S.C. 1, 120 S.E 719 (1923). Nevertheless, the State may\r\nintroduce evidence that a defendant carried an insurance policy on a victim's\r\nlife, where the policy named the defendant as the beneficiary, to establish\r\nmotive in a homicide. State v. Thomas, 159 S.C. 76, 156 S.E. 169 (1930).\r\nThe State also may introduce evidence that a defendant carried an insurance\r\npolicy on the victim's life when there is some showing that the defendant\r\nwould derive some benefit from the proceeds of the policy. State v. Hartfield,\r\n272 S.C. 407, 252 S.E.2d 139 (1979) (evidence of policy on victim's life that\r\nnamed defendant's brother as beneficiary would be admissible if defendant\r\nwould receive some benefit from the policy); State v. Vermillion, 271 S.C. 99,\r\n245 S.E.2d 128 (1978) (upholding admission of evidence that defendant had\r\na policy on life of his father, the victim, which named defendant's wife as\r\nbeneficiary). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe conclude the trial judge properly admitted Ms. Smith's\r\ntestimony that appellant told her about the insurance policies and the\r\npotential loan from his mother as admissions by a party-opponent. Rule\r\n801(d)(2), SCRE. Since Ms. Smith's testimony was admissible, the judge\r\nproperly admitted the personnel managers' testimony, which simply\r\nestablished the existence of the policies. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe evidence showed that appellant would have directly benefitted\r\nfrom the proceeds of his stepfather's life insurance through a $100,000 loan \r\n  \r\np.20 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom his mother.10 The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting\r\nevidence of the insurance policies. See State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 462\r\nS.E.2d 263 (1995) (appellate court will not reverse the trial judge's decision\r\nto admit or exclude evidence unless the trial judge abused his discretion and\r\npetitioner demonstrates prejudice); State v. McElveen, 280 S.C. 325, 313\r\nS.E.2d 298 (1984) (same). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n5. JURY INSTRUCTIONS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn instructing the jury on circumstantial evidence,. the trial judge\r\nstated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe law also requires ... that to the extent that the\r\nState relies on circumstantial evidence, the State\r\nmust prove all of the circumstances relied upon\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Circumstances relied\r\nupon by the State must be wholly and in every\r\nparticular consistent with each other. And the\r\ncircumstances must point conclusively, that is, beyond\r\na reasonable doubt, to the guilt of the accused, to the\r\nexclusion of every other logical or rational conclusion.\r\nThat is, the circumstances must be absolutely\r\ninconsistent with any other logical or rational\r\nconclusion than the guilt of the accused. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNow, ladies and gentlemen, in the consideration of\r\ncircumstantial evidence, you, the jury, must seek \r\nsome other rational or logical explanation other than \r\nthe guilt of the accused. And if such logical or \r\nrational explanation can be found upon consideration \r\nof the circumstances, you, the jury, cannot convict \r\nupon circumstantial evidence. . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n10 Appellant possibly would have benefitted in an indirect way, i.e.,\r\nthe proceeds would have been available for his mother to pay her debts\r\nand perhaps assist appellant and his siblings. We do not decide whether\r\nsuch an indirect benefit is sufficient to admit evidence of insurance\r\nproceeds as a motive under State v. Vermillion, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.21 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI further instruct you, ladies and gentlemen, the\r\nmere fact the circumstances are strongly suspicious\r\nand the guilt of the defendant is probable, it is not\r\nsufficient to sustain a conviction, because the proof\r\noffered by the State must exclude every other\r\nreasonable or rational or logical conclusion except the\r\nguilt of the defendant, and such proof must satisfy\r\nyou, the jury, of the defendant's guilt beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.11 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe judge further instructed the jury that \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[a] reasonable doubt is a doubt which makes an\r\nhonest, sincere, conscientious juror in search of the \r\ntruth in the case hesitate to act. Proof beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt must, therefore, be proof of such a\r\nconvincing character that a reasonable person would\r\nnot hesitate to rely and to act upon it in the most\r\n important of his or her own affairs. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn addition, the judge instructed jurors twenty-six other times throughout his\r\ncharge that the State had the burden of proving a defendant guilty beyond\r\na reasonable doubt. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant contends the emphasized language in the circumstantial\r\nevidence instruction shifted the burden of proof to him by telling jurors they \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n11 The judge at appellant's request substituted the phrase \"logical\r\nand rational conclusion\" for \"reasonable hypothesis,\" the phrase usually\r\nused in this charge. Appellant may not on appeal object to the use of the\r\nsubstituted phrase because he asked for that change and the judge agreed.\r\nSee State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 316 S.E.2d 395 (1984) (party may not\r\ncomplain about an error induced by the party's own conduct); State v. \r\nEpes, 209 S.C. 246, 39 S.E.2d 769 (1946) (same); Rule 20(b), SCRCrP\r\n(stating \"[a]ny objection [to jury instructions] shall state distinctly the\r\nmatter objected to and the grounds for objection. Failure to object in\r\naccordance with this rule shall constitute a waiver of objection\"). While\r\nwe do not address the validity of the \"logical or rational conclusion\"\r\nlanguage, we urge trial courts to use the approved charges described\r\nbelow. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.22\r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust seek some explanation other than his guilt. He also asserts the \"in\r\nsearch of truth\" language in the definition of reasonable doubt exacerbated\r\nthe problem and further shifted the burden of proof to him. Appellant argues\r\nthe charge is deficient under State v. Manning, 305 S.C. 413, 409 S.E.2d 372\r\n(1991), and State v. Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110, 456 S.E.2d 390 (1995). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn State v. Manning, the Court granted the defendant a new trial\r\nbased on a defective charge. The charge was defective because the trial judge\r\n(1) defined \"reasonable doubt\" as synonymous with the term \"moral\r\ncertainty,\" (2) defined a reasonable doubt as a \"doubt which honest people,\r\nsuch as you, when searching for the truth can give a real reason,\" and (3)\r\nrequired the jury to \"seek some reasonable explanation of the circumstances\"\r\nother than guilt when considering circumstantial evidence. The\r\ncircumstantial evidence instruction \"turns the State's burden of proof\r\non its head by requiring the jury find a 'reasonable explanation' of the evidence\r\ninconsistent with [a defendant's] guilt before it can find him not guilty.\" Id.,\r\n305 S.C. at 416-17, 409 S.E.2d at 374 (citing Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39,\r\n111 S.Ct. 328, 112 L.Ed.2d 339 (1990)). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTaken as a whole and considering the three defects, the charge\r\nin Manning violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nbecause a reasonable juror could have interpreted it to allow a finding of\r\nguilt based on a degree of proof below the reasonable doubt standard. The\r\nCourt urged the trial bench to limit its definition of a reasonable doubt to\r\n\"the kind of doubt that would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act.\"\r\nId., 305 S.C. at 417, 409 S.E.2d at 375. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn State v. Raffaldt, supra, the Court again found error in a\r\ncircumstantial evidence charge that required the jury to \"seek some\r\nreasonable explanation other than the guilt of the accused.\"  However, the\r\ndefendant failed to demonstrate prejudicial error because the trial judge\r\nextensively charged that the State had the burden of proving the defendant\r\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  The judge also properly defined reasonable\r\ndoubt as \"the kind of doubt which would cause a reasonable person to\r\nhesitate to act.\" Id., 318 S.C. at 115-16, 456 S.E.2d at 393. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Court since has explained that it was the combination of\r\ndefective instructions, especially the \"moral certainty\" and \"real reason\"\r\nlanguage, that prompted it to find a due process violation in Manning. See \r\nState v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 50, 476 S.E.2d 683, 687 (affirming convictions\r\nwhere trial court defined a reasonable doubt as a doubt \"for which you could \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.23\r\n\r\nSTATE v.

Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 395, 440 S.E.2d 869, 874 (1994) (affirming\r\nconvictions where trial court used \"seek\" language in circumstantial evidence\r\ncharge because reasonable doubt charge did not contain \"moral or grave\r\ncertainty\" or \"real reason,\" and concluding the charge when read as a whole\r\ndid not shift the burden to defendant); State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 131,\r\n410 S.E.2d 547, 553 (1991) (affirming convictions where trial court did not\r\nuse \"moral certainty\" language in conjunction with \"substantial\" or \"grave\"\r\ndoubt in defining reasonable doubt, although those terms also are disfavored);\r\naccord State v. Clute, 324 S.C. 584, 595, 480 S.E.2d 85, 90 (Ct. App. 1996)\r\n(affirming conviction where trial court defined a reasonable doubt as a doubt\r\nthat would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act and as \"a doubt for\r\nwhich a reason can be given\" because it did not refer to \"moral or grave\r\ncertainty\" or a \"real reason\"), cert. denied, 118 S.Ct. 442, 139 L.Ed.2d 379\r\n(1997); State v. Kirkpatrick, 320 S.C. 38, 46, 462 S.E.2d 884, 889 (Ct. App.\r\n1995) (affirming conviction where trial court defined a reasonable doubt as\r\n\"one for which you could give a reason,\" and noting trial court did not use\r\n\"moral or grave certainty\" or \"real reason\" in conjunction with erroneous\r\ncircumstantial evidence charge). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPrior to Manning, the Court tacitly approved a reasonable doubt\r\ncharge containing the language about an honest juror \"in search of the truth.\"\r\nSee Singletary v. State, 281 S.C. 444, 316 S.E.2d 369 (1984). In fact, trial\r\njudges have talked about jurors searching for the truth for more than a\r\ncentury. See State v. Cleland, 148 S.C. 86, 145 S.E. 628 (1928); State v. \r\nWay, 38 S.C. 333, 17 S.E. 39 (1893). In Manning, the Court pointed to the\r\n\"in search of the truth\" language contained in the reasonable doubt charge\r\nas contributing to its defective nature. Manning, 305 S.C. at 415, 409 S.E.2d\r\nat 374. However, appellate courts since have seemed to allow the use of the\r\n phrase -- at least when it is not combined with other offending terms outlined\r\nin Manning. See State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. at 395, 440 S.E.2d at 874; State \r\nv. Kirkpatrick, 320 S.C. at 46, 462 S.E.2d at 889. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the trial judge's circumstantial evidence charge was\r\nerroneous because it instructed jurors to seek a reasonable explanation other\r\nthan the guilt of the accused. However, we conclude it was harmless error\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt because the trial judge instructed jurors twenty-\r\nsix other times throughout his charge that the State has the burden of\r\nproving a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Raffaldt,\r\nsupra; see also State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994) (jury \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.24 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstructions should be considered as a whole, and if as a whole they are free\r\nfrom error, any isolated portions which may be misleading do not constitute\r\nreversible error); State v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 459, 272 S.E.2d 634 (1980) (a jury\r\ncharge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not require\r\nreversal). The charge also was harmless error because it did not contain the\r\nother troubling language identified in Manning and subsequent cases, the\r\nphrases \"moral certainty,\" \"grave certainty,\" or \"a doubt for which you can\r\ngive a real reason.\" See State v. Whipple, supra; State v. Hoffman, supra; \r\nState v. Johnson, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe again take this opportunity to strongly urge the trial courts\r\nto avoid using any \"seek\" language, or any of the other offending terms\r\ndescribed above, when charging jurors on either reasonable doubt or\r\ncircumstantial evidence. Such language is unnecessary and runs the risk of\r\nunconstitutionally shifting the burden of proof to a defendant. We have\r\nidentified two appropriate ways to define reasonable doubt12 and two \r\n  \r\n\r\n12 \"A reasonable doubt is the kind of doubt that would cause a\r\nreasonable person to hesitate to act.\" State v. Manning, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial court also may use the following charge or combine it with\r\nthe Manning charge: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State has the burden of proving the Defendant\r\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Some of you\r\nmay have served as jurors in civil cases where you\r\nwere told that [it] is only necessary to prove the\r\nfact is more likely true than not, such as by the\r\ngreater weight or preponderance of the evidence.\r\nIn criminal cases, the State's proof must be more\r\npowerful than that. It must be beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLadies and gentlemen, proof beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of\r\nthe Defendant's guilt. There are very few things\r\nin this world that we know with absolute certainty.\r\nAnd in criminal cases, the law does not require\r\nproof that overcomes every possible doubt.

You\r\nmust find him guilty. If on the other hand you\r\nthink there is a real possibility that he is not\r\nguilty, you must give him the benefit of the doubt\r\nand find him not guilty. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nState v. Darby, 324 S.C. 114, 477 S.E.2d 710 (1996) (endorsing definition\r\nof reasonable doubt developed by the Federal Judicial Center and cited\r\nwith approval in Justice Ginsberg's concurring opinion in Victor v. \r\nNebraska, 511 U.S. 1, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994)). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNeither charge is mandatory.

In fact, it is within a trial judge's discretion to refuse to define\r\nreasonable doubt at all. State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n13 The well established charge is that when the State relies upon\r\ncircumstantial evidence, a jury may not convict a defendant \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nunless every circumstance relied upon by the State\r\nbe proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and all of the\r\ncircumstances so proven be consistent with each\r\nother and taken together, point conclusively to the\r\nguilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other\r\nreasonable hypothesis. It is not sufficient that they\r\ncreate a probability, though a strong one, and if,\r\nassuming them to be true, they may be accounted\r\nfor upon any reasonable hypothesis which does not\r\ninclude the guilt of the accused, the proof has failed. \r\n  \r\np.26 \r\n  \r\n(continued...  ) \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v.

App. 1996). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe recently approved another charge that makes no distinction\r\nbetween direct and circumstantial evidence: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThere are two types of evidence which are generally\r\npresented during a trial -- direct evidence and\r\ncircumstantial evidence. Direct evidence is the\r\ntestimony of a person who asserts or claims to have\r\nactual knowledge of a fact, such as an eyewitness.\r\nCircumstantial evidence is proof of a chain of facts\r\nand circumstances indicating the existence of a fact.\r\nThe law makes absolutely no distinction between\r\nthe weight or value to be given to either direct or\r\ncircumstantial evidence. Nor is a greater degree of\r\ncertainty required of circumstantial evidence than\r\nof direct evidence. You should weigh all the\r\nevidence in the case. After weighing all the\r\nevidence, if you are not convinced of the guilt of the\r\ndefendant beyond a reasonable doubt, you must\r\nfind [the defendant] not guilty. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nState v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 83-84, 489 S.E.2d 462, 464 (1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n14 After appellant appealed, this Court remanded the case in June\r\n1996 at appellant's request for a hearing to consider his motion for a new\r\ntrial based upon after discovered evidence. \r\n  \r\np.27 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassing through the neighborhood late the previous evening. Appellant\r\nargued in closing that police failed to investigate thoroughly those leads and\r\nothers. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Jennings family lived about 100 yards from the victim's\r\nhouse, which could be seen from the Jennings' residence. At the new trial\r\nhearing, appellant's lawyer submitted an affidavit stating that Mrs. Jennings\r\ntold him before the trial that no one in her family knew anything about the\r\nmurder.  A private investigator hired by appellant testified she and fellow\r\ninvestigators diligently canvassed the victim's neighborhood in 1994,\r\nsearching for the boy mentioned in the police report as a potential witness\r\nto the murder. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMary Kay Needs, appellant's wife, testified she visited the\r\nJennings family in March 1996. She secretly taped a conversation in which\r\nthe young boys, nine-year-old Steven and ten-year-old Michael, purportedly\r\ndescribed hearing a gunshot and seeing a man run from the victim's house.\r\nA friend who was with Mrs. Needs offered similar testimony about the\r\nconversation with the Jennings boys. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSteven Jennings, who was six when the murder occurred, testified\r\nat the hearing he told Mrs. Needs that he saw a tall, white male with black\r\nhair and wearing black clothes outside the victim's house at about 6 p.m. on\r\nApril 25, 1993. He testified he did not know whether he heard a gunshot.\r\nMichael Jennings, who was seven when the murder. occurred, offered a\r\nsimilar description of the man. He testified he did not hear a gunshot.\r\nJames M. Jennings, the boys' father, testified he was not sure whether his\r\nboys told Mrs. Needs they heard a gunshot and saw someone running from\r\nthe victim's house that day. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial judge denied the motion for a new trial based on after\r\ndiscovered evidence. Appellant argues the judge erred because the boys'\r\ntestimony was clearly material to the issue of guilt. Appellant diligently\r\ntried to locate the boys before trial, but could not. \"With the State's entire\r\ncase revolving around an admitted perjurer who changed her story five times,\r\nit is reasonable to think [the boys'] testimony would probably have changed\r\nthe result of the trial,\" appellant contends. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTo prevail on a motion for a new trial based on after discovered\r\nevidence, a defendant must show (1) the evidence is such as will probably\r\nchange the result if a new trial is granted; (2) the evidence has been \r\n  \r\np.28 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. NEEDS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscovered since the trial; (3) the evidence could not have been discovered\r\nprior to trial by the exercise of due diligence; (4) the evidence is material;\r\nand (5) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching. State v. Prince,\r\n316 S.C. 57, 447 S.E.2d 177 (1993); State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d\r\n195 (1978). The granting of such a motion is not favored and, absent error\r\nof law or abuse of discretion an appellate court will not disturb the trial\r\njudge's denial of the motion. State v. Irvin, supra; State v. Freeman, 319\r\nS.C. 110) 459 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe conclude appellant has not met his burden. It is true the\r\nState's case against appellant was not overwhelming, especially since the\r\nState's key witness had offered so many contradictory statements. But we\r\ndo not believe the evidence appellant would present at a new trial would\r\nchange the outcome of the trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFurthermore, appellant knew about reports the police had\r\nreceived about a possible young witness, the Cadillac, and the lowrider\r\nmotorcycle before the trial. It is unclear why appellant's private\r\ninvestigators, in the exercise of due diligence, did not insist on speaking\r\ndirectly to the boys instead of just their mother before the trial. Finally,\r\ngiven the boys' lack of testimony at the post-trial hearing about a gunshot or\r\na man running from the victim's house, the evidence appellant would offer\r\nis merely cumulative. Appellant would have little or no more evidence to\r\nargue to the jury than he did in the first trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe dispose of appellant's remaining issues pursuant to Rule\r\n220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Issue 4: State v.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the beginning of trial, appellant stipulated he killed his\r\nwife, Janet, by strangling her with a t-shirt; he denied the killing was \r\n  \r\np.31\r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmurder. The homicide occurred on August 31, 1994. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe following evidence was presented. Appellant and Janet\r\nseparated in June 1994. According to different witnesses, appellant\r\nthreatened to kill his wife on several occasions after their separation.\r\nSpecifically, appellant stated, referring to his wife: \"if that bitch don't\r\ncome home, I'm going to kill her;\" \"either you are going to have sex with\r\nme or I'll kill you;\" \"he should have killed her and [her daughter] a long\r\ntime ago . . . ;\" and \"if he had her right then, he'd ring her neck.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant's neighbor saw a man at the Taylor's home after\r\nJanet returned to the marital home.1 In early August, the neighbor had a\r\nconversation with appellant. Appellant indicated he knew Janet was\r\nseeing this man and stated, \"I'm not going to let anyone sleep in my bed;\r\nI'd kill her first.\" The neighbor replied, \"I told [appellant] not to be\r\nanother O.J. Simpson.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccording to appellant's brother, on the afternoon of August\r\n31, appellant drove from Dorchester County to Orangeburg. Appellant told\r\nhis brother he thought he had killed Janet. The brother reported the\r\nclaim to the police. The Orangeburg police arrived and arrested appellant\r\nwithout incident. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOne of the arresting officers testified appellant had cut his\r\nwrist with a box cutter in an apparent suicide attempt. Appellant\r\ninquired if his wife was dead and, if so, \"then that was good; that he had\r\nwasted twenty-one years of his life.\" Two other officers testified appellant\r\nrepeatedly asked \"is the bitch dead?\" and stated \"I hope she's dead\r\nbecause she ruined [my] life.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant's sister testified Janet began a relationship with\r\nRichard Pritchard in May 1994. The sister testified, despite their\r\nseparation, appellant continued to give Janet money and, at times, the two\r\n\"acted like newlyweds.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe sister testified appellant called her on August 31 and\r\nstated he thought he had killed Janet.  The sister testified she thought\r\nappellant then stated he was \"just kidding.\" Appellant's sister stated he \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1Appellant was living elsewhere. \r\n\r\np.32 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"sounded kind of sad.\"  The sister went to Janet's home; she gave the\r\ndeputies permission to break a window to enter the home. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDorchester Deputy Sheriff Limehouse testified Sergeant Moore\r\nbroke a window pane, entered the home, and then unlocked the front door.\r\nJanet's body was found in a bedroom, under blankets, clothes, and a\r\nguitar case. Appellant stipulated he killed Janet in one part of the home\r\nand dragged her to another. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe deputy sheriff testified it appeared there had been a\r\nstruggle in the home. A lamp was knocked over. A broken necklace and\r\ntorn watchband were on the floor. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRichard Pritchard, Janet's paramour, testified on appellant's behalf.\r\nHe stated he was engaged in an affair with Janet from May to\r\nAugust 1994. Appellant was aware of the relationship in May and had no\r\nanimosity about Pritchard's relationship with Janet. Several weeks before\r\nJanet's death, appellant shook Pritchard's hand and stated he was glad\r\nJanet had met someone nice. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant testified Janet left him in May 1994. He stated\r\nJanet had told him Pritchard was a friend, but appellant suspected the\r\nrelationship was more. He testified he did not want to believe his wife\r\nhad a relationship with Pritchard; he wanted Janet back. Although they\r\nwere separated, on occasion, Janet led appellant to believe there was a\r\nchance for their relationship. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDays before the homicide, appellant helped Janet with car\r\nrepairs. On the day of the killing, appellant bought her a car battery and\r\nhelped her pack her possessions. Her home was in foreclosure. She asked\r\nappellant for money to rent an apartment. Appellant stated he thought\r\nshe was going to live with her parents. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant testified: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI had been drinking a little bit . . . I was sitting on the floor .\r\n. . [Janet] got mad with me, and I just kind of laughed at her\r\na little bit. I rubbed her on the leg. I said, 'what are you\r\ngetting' -- because Janet didn't normally get upset like that . .\r\n. But she got up and started pacing back and forth, and she \r\nstarted telling me that Rick was her lover. And she told me \r\n  \r\np.33\r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat Leonard Bogard, she had had sex with him while she was \r\nstill married to me . . . [Janet] was very angry at me . . . She \r\nsaid, 'Bill, you're never going to change; you're sorry as hell.'\r\nand she said, 'I have no intentions of going back to you.' She \r\nplainly told me that she was only using me for my money . . . \r\nAt that time, I started to get up and she kicked me in the\r\ngroin . . . She went toward the television set on the end of the\r\ncouch . . . And somehow or another she came up to me. I don't \r\nknow if she had an object in her hand. I have no idea what it \r\nwas at the time. but I ended up with her shirt, her t-shirt, \r\nfrom the back of her trying to hold her off of me, from hitting \r\nme. She kept doing this (indicating). She had something in \r\nher hand -- I don't know what it was -- and she was kicking \r\nme also. And the next thing I know she stopped doing\r\neverything, and she was down on the floor, and she was dead. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant testified he tried to resuscitate Janet. He then\r\ndragged her body to the back bedroom. He stated he did not mean to hurt\r\nJanet and denied ever threatening to kill her. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant testified he later discovered Janet had been holding\r\na box cutter. The box cutter had blood on it. Appellant took the box\r\ncutter. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant testified when Janet was coming towards him, he\r\nreached behind her, grabbed her t-shirt at the neck, and squeezed the\r\nshirt tightly. He did not know how long he held onto the shirt.\r\nAppellant's sisters testified Janet had asthma. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant explained Janet must have cut her left hand while\r\ntransferring the box cutter between her hands. Appellant denied slashing\r\nJanet's hand with the box cutter. He further denied his wife smeared\r\nblood on the front door while attempting to flee. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe pathologist testified the ' decedent died from asphyxia due\r\nto ligature strangulation. She stated \"it takes a good deal of pressure to\r\nasphyxiate somebody by means of a t-shirt [pulled across the front of the\r\nneck]... it takes a good deal of force to do that.\" The pathologist testified \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.34 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit would take a \"number of minutes\" to asphyxiate someone with a t-shirt.2\r\nShe testified there were no indications the decedent had asthma. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe decedent had several scrapes on her back, bruises on the\r\nback of her left arm, bruises on the inside of her thighs, a bruise on her\r\nscalp, and bruises on her  lower legs. The pathologist stated the bruises\r\nprobably occurred just before death. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe decedent had a two inch laceration on her left palm which\r\nthe pathologist stated could have been inflicted with a knife. The\r\npathologist described this wound as \"defensive.\" Blood was also found on\r\nthe decedent's right hand. The pathologist agreed with the defense that\r\nthe location of the blood was consistent with the decedent holding\r\nsomething in that hand. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe forensic serologist testified both the decedent and\r\nappellant had the same blood type. She was unable to determine the\r\ndecedent's blood sub-type, but determined appellant's sub-type. Human\r\nblood was found on the decedent's right hand and on scrapings from the\r\nvictim's fingernails, but no other identifiable characteristics were available.\r\nBlood on the decedent's left hand and t-shirt was consistent with the\r\ndecedent's blood but inconsistent with appellant's blood.  The blood stains\r\non appellant's shorts and shirt were consistent with his blood type (and\r\nthe decedent's). Human blood was identified on the box cutter taken from\r\nappellant, on a box from the decedent's home, and on a swab taken from\r\nthe front door of the decedent's home, but no further identifying\r\ninformation was available on these items. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant maintains the essential jury issue was whether the\r\nhomicide was murder or voluntary manslaughter.3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDid the trial judge err by refusing to allow appellant to \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 The victim was 5'7\" and weighed over 200 pounds. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3Appellant did not request a charge on self-defense.

During\r\ncross-examination, the following colloquy was exchanged: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nQ. Okay. Do you recall an incident where Janet hit\r\n[appellant] on the head with a beer bottle at your house? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA. Yes, sir. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nQ. Can you tell the jury about that? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[Solicitor]: Your honor, I object to that . . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDuring a bench conference, appellant indicated he was trying\r\nto establish Janet was the aggressor.  He proffered the following\r\ntestimony: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nQ. Could you tell us about the incident concerning the beer\r\nbottle? \r\n  \r\nA. [Appellant] and Janet got in an argument, and they was\r\n(sic) up at my house. They was (sic) both drunk. I was \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). \r\n\r\np.36\r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrunk. And Janet hit him in the head with the bottle about\r\nthree times. It never broke, but she hit him pretty hard and\r\nhe staggered back, and she went and got in the car and left\r\nhim at my house in Orangeburg. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial judge sustained the solicitor's objection. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by refusing to allow him\r\nto question his brother concerning the specifics of the incident with the\r\nbeer bottle. He contends the testimony was relevant for the purpose of\r\nestablishing the decedent was the aggressor. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn homicide cases, evidence that the accused and the decedent\r\nhad previous difficulty is admissible. The evidence is admissible to show\r\nthe animus of the parties and to aid the jury in deciding who was the\r\nprobable aggressor. The general details of the difficulty, however, are\r\ninadmissible. State v. Atchison, 268 S.C. 588, 235 S.E.2d 294 (1977);\r\nState v. Clinkscales, 231 S.C. 650, 99 S.E.2d 663 (1957); State v. Bush,\r\n211 S.C. 455, 45 S.E.2d 847 (1948); State v.

Graham, 161 S.C. 362, 159 S.E. 838 (1931). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant's brother testified the decedent hit appellant on the\r\nhead with a bottle on a prior occasion. This testimony supported\r\nappellant's contention the decedent was the aggressor at the time of her\r\ndeath. The trial judge properly admitted this testimony and properly\r\nexcluded the specifics of the incident. State v. Clinkscales, supra (evidence\r\nhusband and wife had previous difficulties was admissible, however,\r\ntestimony husband shot wife in the back with a shotgun weeks before her\r\ndeath was inadmissible). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMoreover, any error in refusing to admit the proffered\r\ntestimony was harmless. Appellant's brother had already testified the\r\ndecedent hit appellant in the head with a beer bottle. The proffered\r\ntestimony adds little favorable evidence for appellant. Gamble v. \r\nInternational Paper Corp. of S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438\r\n(1996)(where excluded testimony was merely cumulative, there was no\r\nerror); State v.

TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs noted above, appellant called Richard Pritchard, the\r\ndecedent's paramour, as a witness. On direct examination, Pritchard\r\nadmitted he had an affair with the decedent between May and August\r\n1994. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn cross-examination, Pritchard testified he first met the\r\ndecedent in March 1994. He stated the decedent and appellant separated\r\ntwo months later. At that time, Pritchard and the decedent began a\r\nsexual relationship. Pritchard testified appellant became aware of his\r\nrelationship with the decedent in May or June of 1994. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn redirect, appellant questioned Pritchard concerning the\r\nstatement he had given law enforcement after the decedent's death.\r\nAppellant showed the written statement to Pritchard and confirmed his\r\nsignature at the bottom of the statement. Appellant had Pritchard read\r\nthe following sentence from the statement: \"I met Janet Taylor on May the\r\n14th, 1994.\" Thereafter, appellant examined Pritchard as to the\r\ninconsistencies in the date he met the decedent. Pritchard explained he\r\nwas nervous when he gave his statement and had in fact met the decedent\r\non March 14, 1994. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe solicitor requested permission to publish all of Pritchard's\r\nstatement pursuant to Rule 106, SCRE. Appellant objected, arguing he\r\nhad not introduced the statement into evidence. The trial judge overruled\r\nthe objection. The solicitor published Pritchard's statement to the jury in\r\nits entirety. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant contends the following portion of the statement is\r\nprejudicial: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhen [appellant] learned of my presence in [decedent's] life, he\r\ninvestigated me, found out my address, phone number, place of\r\nemployment; I'm not sure what else. Before I met [appellant]\r\nhe called me at my house and told me that [decedent] had\r\ngone to a bar and brought a man home to spend the night. He\r\nalso told me that she was still having sex with him. I believe\r\nthis was an attempt to break us up. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant contends because he did not introduce Pritchard's \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.38 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatement as an exhibit, the trial judge erred by allowing the solicitor to\r\npublish all of Pritchard's statement. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 1065, SCRE, provides: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhen a writing, or recorded statement, or part thereof is\r\nintroduced by a party, an adverse party may require the\r\nintroduction at that time of any other part of any other writing\r\nor recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered\r\ncontemporaneously with it. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 106, SCRE, has not been interpreted by this Court. The\r\ntext of Rule 106, SCRE, is substantially similar to Rule 106 of the Federal\r\nRules of Evidence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 106, Fed. R. Evid., is based on the \"'rule of completeness'\r\nand seeks to avoid the unfairness inherent in 'the misleading impression\r\ncreated by taking matters out of context'.\" Rainey v. Beech Aircraft Corp.,\r\n784 F.2d 1523, 1529 (11th Cir. 1986), citing Fed. R. Evid. 106 advisory\r\ncommittee notes.5 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 106 [of the Federal Rules of Evidence] is a procedural\r\ndevice governing the timing of completion evidence; the Rule is\r\n'primarily designed to affect the order of proof.'  It means that\r\nthe adverse party need not wait until cross-examination or\r\nrebuttal. As such, the Rule reduces the risk that a writing or\r\nrecording will be taken out of context and that an initial\r\nmisleading impression will take hold in the mind of the jury. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS. Saltzburg, M. Martin, D. Capra, Federal Rules of Evidence Manual, pp.\r\n98-99 (1998), citing, United States v. Walker, 652 F.2d 708, 713 (7th Cir.\r\n1981); see also, M. Graham, Handbook of Federal Evidence, Â§ 106 (1996);\r\nJ. Strong, McCormick on Evidence, Â§ 56 (1992). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n5 Before the adoption of Rule 106, SCRE, the law in South Carolina\r\nhad been that \"when a part of a document or writing is introduced into\r\nevidence, the remainder may be introduced by the other party. . .\r\nHowever, the party seeking to bring out the remainder had to wait until\r\ncross-examination or the presentation of that party's case to do so.\"\r\n(internal citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.39\r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnically, Rule 106, Fed. R. Evid., applies in instances when\r\na party introduces a writing or recorded statement into evidence. Rainey \r\nv. Beech Aircraft Corp)., supra. Given the purposes behind Rule 106,\r\nfairness and completeness, it is also applied where a party's use of a\r\nwriting or recorded statement is \"tantamount to the introduction of the\r\n[document] into evidence.\" Id. at 1529; see also United States v. Rubin,\r\n609 F.2d 51 (2nd Cir. 1979)(where defense counsel quoted extensively from\r\ngovernment agents' notes, notes were admissible under doctrine of\r\ncompleteness); Nachtsheim v.

Only that portion of the\r\nremainder of a statement which explains or clarifies the previously\r\nadmitted portion should be introduced.

Kelsey , 331 S.C. 50, 71, 502 S.E.2d 63, 73-\r\n74 (1998)(\"[g]enerally, where a portion of a witness's prior inconsistent\r\nstatement has been introduced to impeach that witness, the entire\r\nstatement is admissible in rebuttal to explain the inconsistency . . .\r\nRemaining portions which are not relevant or material in the explanation\r\nof the inconsistency are not admissible. \")(internal citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant effectively placed a portion of Pritchard's statement\r\ninto evidence by having Pritchard read directly from the statement.\r\nAccordingly, in the interest of fairness and completeness, it would have\r\nbeen appropriate for the trial judge to require the introduction of any\r\nother portion of Pritchard's statement which explained or clarified when he\r\nmet the decedent, the only issue encompassed by appellant's use of\r\nPritchard's statement. However, the remainder of Pritchard's statement\r\ndid not explain or clarify when he met the decedent. Accordingly, the trial\r\njudge erred by allowing the solicitor to read the rest of Pritchard's\r\nstatement. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v.

Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d 364 (1990).     \"Whether error is\r\nharmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case. No definite\r\nrule of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality and prejudicial\r\ncharacter of the error must be determined from its relationship to the\r\nentire case. Error is harmless when it 'could not reasonably have affected\r\nthe result of the trial'.\" State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d\r\n150, 151 (1985), citing State v.

The solicitor did not allude to this portion\r\nof Pritchard's statement during his closing argument. Moreover, in light\r\nof the other evidence of malice, the effect of the statement is negligible.\r\nSee Part IV. Review of the entire record indicates admission of the\r\nstatement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant testified at trial. During his direct examination,\r\ndefense counsel made a motion, unrelated to the present issue. While\r\noutside the presence of the jury, the solicitor indicated he would mention\r\nappellant's prior criminal domestic violence conviction if appellant tried to\r\n\"soft petal\" (sic) the marital relationship. Appellant objected, stating he\r\nhad not placed his character into evidence and had limited his testimony\r\nfrom the time of the separation to the homicide. The trial judge\r\ninstructed appellant to object at the appropriate time. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant continued his direct examination. He stated \"[J]ust\r\nthings had kind of gotten rough for us the last couple of years. . .\". \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn cross-examination, the following exchange occurred: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nQ.

Yes, sir \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nQ. What kind of problems did you have back then? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA. I was arrested for domestic violence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nQ. And that involved, in December of 1986, hitting your wife\r\nover the head with a .22 rifle, didn't it? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA. No; I didn't do that. No, I did not. That was never proved\r\nin court or nothing. Me and Janet both simply went to court\r\nand I simply admitted - -   I paid the fine. I never really\r\nadmitted to nothing. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nQ. Okay. [Appellant], do you deny --- \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA. I truly --- \r\n  \r\nQ. that--wait; let me ask my question --- \r\n  \r\nThe Court: Wait a minute now. Listen to the question. Then\r\nyou can answer it. \r\n  \r\np.42\r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ. Do you deny that on January the fifth, 1987, you were\r\nfound guilty --- \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA. [Defense Counsel]: Your honor, I object at this point. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Court: Over-ruled \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nQ. Do you deny that on January the fifth, 1987, you appeared\r\nbefore Judge Miley and were found guilty of criminal domestic\r\nviolence in Berkeley County for hitting your wife over the head\r\nwith a .22 rifle? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA. No, I was -- yes; I was. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant contends the trial judge erred by allowing the\r\nsolicitor to impeach him with a prior conviction for criminal domestic\r\nviolence. He contends by allowing the State to impeach him with the\r\nformer conviction, it was impermissibly allowed to attack his character\r\nwhen he had not placed his character in issue. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nInitially, we note this issue is not preserved for appeal.\r\nAppellant's general objection to the solicitor's question is insufficient to\r\npreserve this issue for appeal. State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d\r\n118 (1997). Appellant's earlier claim that he would object if the State\r\nmentioned his prior conviction is also insufficient to preserve this issue for\r\nappeal. See State v. Hill, 331 S.C. 94, 501 S.E.2d 122 (1998)(pre-trial\r\nevidentiary ruling is not final because subject to change based on\r\ndevelopments at trial). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn any event, this issue is without merit. In a criminal case,\r\nthe State may not attack the character of the accused unless he first\r\nplaces his character in issue. State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 501 S.E.2d 716\r\n(1998). However, \"[w]here one party introduces evidence as to a particular\r\nfact or transaction, the other party is entitled to introduce evidence in\r\nexplanation or rebuttal thereof, even though [the] latter evidence would be\r\nincompetent or irrelevant had it been offered initially.\" State v. Stroman,\r\n281 S.C. 508, 513, 316 S.E.2d 395, 399 (1984). An \"accused may be cross-\r\nexamined as to- all matters which he himself has brought up on direct\r\nexamination.\" 98 C.J.S.

The cross-\r\nexamination of matters which were addressed in direct-examination is not\r\nobjectionable, even. if the answers affect a witness' credibility and\r\ncharacter. 98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 378. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn direct examination, appellant stated \"things had kind of\r\ngotten rough for us the last couple of years.\" This testimony implied\r\nappellant and his wife had a good relationship until recent years, an issue\r\nwhich was relevant to this case. We agree with appellant: this testimony\r\ndid not place appellant's character in issue.7 However, because appellant\r\n\"opened the door\" about his relationship with his wife, the solicitor was\r\nentitled to cross-examine him about the relationship, even if the responses\r\nbrought out appellant's prior criminal domestic violence conviction.

TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter his conviction, appellant moved for a new trial based on\r\nafter-discovered evidence and based on an alleged Brady violation. He\r\nclaimed the State failed to provide him with evidence that Sergeant Moore\r\nhad cut his hand while breaking a window to gain access to the decedent's\r\nhome.  Appellant argues this evidence was material in that blood on the\r\ninside of the front door could have been from the officer, rather than the\r\ndecedent. It is undisputed none of the police reports provided to appellant\r\nbefore trial indicated an officer had cut his hand. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs noted above, at trial Deputy Sheriff Limehouse testified\r\nSergeant Moore broke a window pane at the decedent's residence in order\r\n to enter the home. Sergeant Moore did not testify at trial.  Human blood\r\nwas identified on the inside of the front door. The serologist could not\r\ncharacterize or type the blood. Photographs show a large, although fairly\r\nfaint, smear of blood near the center of the door. State's Ex. 16 and 23 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn two occasions during closing argument, the solicitor\r\nsuggested the blood on the front door indicated the decedent had tried to\r\nescape appellant's attack with the box cutter by fleeing through the front\r\ndoor. Appellant, however, grabbed her t-shirt and choked her to death. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the new trial hearing, Sergeant Moore testified he cut his\r\nindex finger when he broke the window at the decedent's residence. He\r\ndescribed the laceration as \"small.\" The finger did not bleed heavily; he\r\nwas able to control the bleeding with a handkerchief. He unlocked the\r\nfront door and the other officers entered. Thereafter, Sergeant Moore put\r\na latex glove on his hand. Blood appeared in the finger of the glove. As\r\nto the amount of blood, Sergeant Moore testified \". . . if you've ever seen\r\nsomebody that (sic) blood in panty hose or hah (sic) latex glove a little by\r\n(sic) of blood looks a lot.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTo obtain a new trial based on after-discovered evidence, the\r\nparty must show that the evidence: 1) would probably change the result if\r\na new trial is had; 2) has been discovered since trial; 3) could not have\r\nbeen discovered before trial; 4) is material to the issue of guilt or\r\ninnocence; and 5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching. Clark v. State,\r\n315 S.C. 3S5, 434 S.E.2d 266 (1993); State v. Caskey, 273 S.C. 325, 256\r\nS.E.2d 737 (1979). The denial of a motion for a new trial will not be\r\nreversed absent an abuse of discretion. State v. South 310 S.C. 504 427 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.45 \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 666 (1993). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Brady v. Maryland, supra, the Court held: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[S]uppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an\r\naccused upon request violates due process where the evidence\r\nis material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the\r\ngood faith or bad faith of the prosecution. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nU.S. at 87, S.Ct. at 1196-97, L.Ed.2d at 218. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBrady only requires disclosure of evidence which is both\r\nfavorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment. United \r\nStates v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).\r\n\"Evidence is material . . . 'only if there is a reasonable probability that,\r\nhad the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the\r\nproceeding would have been different. A 'reasonable probability' is a\r\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome'.\" State v. \r\nCain, 297 S.C. 497, 503, 377 S.E.2d 556, 559 (1988), citing United States \r\nv. Bagley , supra U.S. at 682, S.Ct. at 3383, L.Ed.2d at 494. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFor Brady purposes, in determining the materiality of\r\nnondisclosed evidence, an appellate court must consider the evidence in\r\nthe context of the entire record. United States v. Agurs , 427 U.S. 97, 96\r\nS.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). However, the court should not consider\r\nthe sufficiency of the evidence. The court's function is to determine\r\nwhether the appellant's right to a fair trial has been impaired. State v. \r\nOsborne, 291 S.C. 265, 353 S.E.2d 276 (1987); State v. Goodson, 276 S.C.\r\n243, 277 S.E.2d 602 (1981). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlthough the defense could have more readily responded to the\r\nsolicitor's argument that blood on the door belonged to the fleeing victim\r\nhad it known Sergeant Moore had cut his finger, the evidence is not\r\nmaterial for Brady purposes. Because the serologist could only identify\r\nthe blood on the door as human but could not characterize the blood\r\nfurther, the solicitor still could have argued the blood came from the\r\ndecedent while attempting to escape. The fact that Sergeant Moore bled\r\nwould not have negated the State's theory of its case. Furthermore,\r\nconsidering the strength of the State's case (appellant's numerous threats\r\nto kill the decedent, the signs of struggle in the decedent's home, the\r\ndefensive wound on the decedent's palm and recent bruises on her body, \r\n  \r\np.46\r\n\r\nSTATE v. TAYLOR \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe fact that appellant hid the decedent's body in a back bedroom under\r\nblankets and clothes, the length of time it would take to asphyxiate\r\nsomeone with a t-shirt, and appellant's statements he was glad the\r\ndecedent was dead), the non-disclosure of Sergeant Moore's laceration did\r\nnot impair appellant's right to a fair trial. State v. Goodson, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSimilarly, with regard to the motion for a new trial based on\r\nafter-discovered evidence, the blood evidence was neither material nor\r\nlikely to change the result if a new trial was held. Accordingly, the trial\r\njudge did not abuse his discretion in denying appellant a new trial based\r\non after-discovered evidence. State v.

We take this opportunity to\r\nclarify the narrowness of our holding in Toyota of Florence, Inc. v. Lynch,\r\n314 S.C. 2571 442 S.E.2d 611 (1994), and reverse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent's (Dial's) husband, a sheriff's deputy, was killed when\r\nthe patrol car he was driving collided with a truck owned by petitioner\r\nNiggel Associates and driven by Niggel's employee, petitioner George.\r\nGeorge subsequently pled guilty to felony driving under the influence.\r\nDial then commenced this wrongful death action to recover for the death \r\n  \r\nof her husband.2 She alleged George was driving while intoxicated and\r\ncaused the wreck by turning left across Deputy Dial's lane of travel. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt trial, proximate cause was a contested issue. Dial argued Deputy\r\nDial's death was caused solely by George's negligence. In his defense,\r\nGeorge argued the collision was caused by the excessive speed of the\r\npatrol car without headlights (it was dusk) or flashing signals to indicate\r\nspeed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe jury returned a defense verdict. Dial made a post-trial motion\r\ncomplaining certain remarks by counsel during closing argument were so\r\ninflammatory as to merit a new trial despite the fact that no\r\ncontemporaneous objection was made. The trial judge denied the motion.\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed relying on this Court's decision\r\nin Toyota. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Court of Appeals held the following remarks by George's counsel\r\nmandated a new trial under Toyota: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 ___S.C.___ , 476 S.E.2d 700 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Dial brought the action in her capacity as personal representative of\r\nthe deceased's estate. She is apparently the sole statutory beneficiary. \r\n  \r\np.2\r\n\r\nDIAL v. NIGGEL ASSOCIATES, INC. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[George] was driving on the public highways and he was .27.\r\nThat's a D.U.I. He accepted his responsibility, and he got\r\nrailroaded. He got railroaded, ladies and gentlemen. Freddie\r\nGeorge is serving 18 years of his life because he got railroaded. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhat's going on here? I'll tell you what's going on. This man\r\nis on a set of tracks to prison because a police officer has died.\r\nBut yet, a police officer is no better or worse than anybody\r\nelse. My client has been railroaded. And he will not be\r\nrailroaded today. You will reap what you sew (sic) as they\r\nsaid \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAnd they have sewed (sic) deceit, deception, lies and\r\nmisconception. And they are the ones trying to trick you. \r\n  \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\nDid you see the videotape when they put it on that fancy t.v.\r\nthey had here? There were cop cars everywhere, cops crawling\r\nover that place. A police officer has died. \r\n  \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\nNow, if you're drunk and you're driving, you know you're\r\nguilty of D.U.I. and you've got a dead cop and there ain't no\r\nevidence that you can put your hands on that's going to help\r\nyou, what else are you going to do? You're a black man and\r\nthere's a white police officer dead in the car over there. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\na) \"Deceit and lies\" argument \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGeorge contends the statement in argument that: \"[T]hey have\r\nsewed (sic) deceit, deception, lies and misconception. They are the ones\r\ntrying to trick you. . . .\" should not have been considered by the Court of\r\nAppeals because it was not raised in Dial's post-trial motion. We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Toyota, we found reversible error despite the lack of a\r\ncontemporaneous objection where the issue of inflammatory argument was\r\nraised for the first time in post-trial motions. Toyota cites the rule that\r\n\"even in the absence of a contemporaneous objection, a new trial motion\r\nshould be granted in flagrant cases where a vicious inflammatory\r\nargument results in clear prejudice.\" 341 S.C. at 263, 442 S.E.2d at 615\r\n(citing South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Nasim 255 S.C. 406 179 S E 2d\r\n211 (1971)). \r\n  \r\np.3\r\n\r\nDIAL v. NIGGEL ASSOCIATES, INC. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToyota sets forth a narrow exception to the general rule that a party\r\nmust make a contemporaneous objection to improper argument or the\r\nobjection is waived. See Varnadore v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 289 S.C.\r\n155, 345 S.E.2d 711 (1986). Under Toyota, the issue of inflammatory\r\nargument must be raised to the trial judge by way of post-trial motion to\r\npreserve the issue for appeal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the record indicates the allegation of racial prejudice\r\nwas the only complaint Dial raised in her post-trial motion regarding\r\ncounsel's argument. This allegation does not encompass counsel's \"deceit\r\nand lies\" remark. In addressing this issue, the Court of Appeals went\r\nbeyond Toyota and improperly considered an issue not preserved by post-\r\ntrial motion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn any event, on the merits, the \"deceit and lies\" statement does not\r\nrise to the level of a Toyota argument when considered in context. This\r\nstatement was in response to accusatory remarks by Dial's counsel\r\ninsisting George's failure to testify was a deceptive tactic. For instance,\r\nDial's counsel stated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBut if they want to hide something or if they want to do it\r\nthat way, why didn't they put their man up? I'll tell you why,\r\nbut you can infer it in your own way. They didn't want you to \r\nknow the truth. They didn't want you to know why George\r\nturned the way he did. They didn't want you to see George.\r\nThey didn't want you to judge him. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhy didn't they put him on? They didn't put him on for one\r\nreason. They didn't put him on because they didn't want me\r\nor Jim to cross examine him, to learn the truth that you are \r\nhere to get today, the truth. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDial's counsel also referred to the use of a defense witness's deposition\r\ntestimony rather than having the witness testify: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDo you think that's the reason Sease didn't testify and come\r\nup here from the company? The one man from the company\r\nthey put up was Mr. Swift who doesn't know anything about\r\nit. He conveniently for his company, not for him, was off sick\r\nat that time. Don't you think if they want the truth they'd \r\nput somebody up here? \r\n  \r\np.4 \r\n  \r\n\r\nDIAL v. NIGGEL ASSOCIATES, INC. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf they wanted the truth, where is George, where is Sease,\r\nwhere is (sic) the company people? Not here. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe have held argument of counsel is not so inflammatory as to\r\nconstitute a ground for reversal where counsel responds in kind to\r\nprevious argument of opposing counsel. State v. Singleton, 284 S.C. 388,\r\n326 S.E.2d 153 (1985). In this case, counsel's \"deceit and lies\" remark was\r\nin response to opposing counsel's repeated accusation of deception. In\r\ncontext, this remark was not so inflammatory as to come within the ambit\r\nof our decision in Toyota. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn conclusion, the Court of Appeals should not have considered\r\ncounsel's \"deceit and lies\" argument in reversing the denial of Dial's post-\r\ntrial motion. We take this opportunity to reiterate that the exception in\r\nToyota excusing the failure to make a contemporaneous objection is limited\r\nto instances where the issue is raised to the trial judge by post-trial\r\nmotion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nb. Racial prejudice argument \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe remainder of counsel's argument found inflammatory by the\r\nCourt of Appeals refers to George being \"railroaded\" because he is a black man\r\nand Deputy Dial was a white police officer.  These comments taken\r\nin context refer to George's guilty plea in the related criminal case.3\r\n George contends these remarks do not compel reversal under Toyota. We\r\nagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Toyota, we considered an argument during which counsel used\r\nposters depicting characters with Oriental features involved in bribery and\r\ndocument shredding. Counsel's argument made an oblique reference to \r\n  \r\n\r\n3Dial's counsel first raised George's guilty plea in his own closing: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf speed was the cause of this death, why did\r\n[G]eorge plead guilty? \r\n  \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\nIt was the fault of Dial? Then why is George\r\npleading guilty to these charges? \r\n  \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\nGeorge was drunk. And for that he pled guilty. It\r\nwas his fault. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.5 \r\n  \r\n\r\nDIAL v. NIGGEL ASSOCIATES, INC. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\natomic bombs. One of the parties was a regional distributor of Toyota\r\nvehicles, a Japanese automotive brand. We found this argument was\r\n\"outrageous\" and counsel's conduct \"abhorrent\" for evoking such racial\r\nprejudice. 314 S.C. at 263., 442 S.E.2d at 615. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn allowing an exception to the contemporaneous objection rule,\r\nToyota relied on Nasim, supra, a land condemnation case. In that case,\r\nduring closing argument, counsel referred to the State's land appraiser as\r\na \"quizzling quivaler\" and stated: \"Do you remember the 'quizzler' back in\r\nWorld War II? The ones back in Germany and France, the ones that\r\nsided up with the enemy?\" 255 S.C. at 409, 179 S.E.2d at 212. He also\r\nreferred to the witness as a \"great highway robber\" and stated that the\r\nwitness was \"tr[ying] to steal my client's property.\" Id. at 409-10, 179\r\nS.E.2d at 212. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNasim relies on Major v. Alverson, 183 S.C. 1231 190 S.E. 449\r\n(1937), in allowing an exception to the contemporaneous objection rule.\r\nNasim specifically quotes the conclusion in Major that calling the opposing\r\nparty a \"bare-faced liar\" was not merely improper \"but amounted to an\r\nabuse of the witness. . . . In short, where counsel applies to a witness or \r\nlitigant abusive epithets, he will do so at his own peril.\" 255 S.C. at 411,\r\n179 S.E.2d at 212 (quoting Major, 183 S.C. at 125, 190 S.E. at 450\r\n(emphasis added)). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNasim also cites Edwards v. Union Buffalo Mills Co., 162 S.C. 17,\r\n159 S.E. 818 (1931), where counsel referred to the opposing party's expert\r\nwitnesses in argument as follows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI am casting no reflections on the doctors, but I think it was\r\none distinguished Chief Justice who said, that there are two\r\nclasses of liars. One., he said is the plain liars, and the other\r\nis the experts. Don't take that literally; I don't mean that, but\r\nI do mean that when you have money you can line up doctors\r\non one side and doctors on the other, as many as you want to,\r\nand they will try to out-swear each other. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n162 S.C. at 26, 159 S.E. at 821. In reversing and remanding for a new\r\ntrial, Edwards specifically noted that \"witnesses are entitled to the\r\nprotection of the Court.\" Id. at 28, 159 S.E. at 822. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nToyota and the line of cases preceding it concern abuse of a witness\r\nor litigant. Accordingly, we now clarify that our holding in Toyota excuses \r\n  \r\np.6\r\n\r\nDIAL v. NIGGEL ASSOCIATES, INC. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe failure to make a contemporaneous objection only where the challenged\r\nargument constitutes abuse of a party or witness. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCounsel's \"railroading\" and racial remarks, while objectionable,4 do\r\nnot constitute abuse of a litigant or witness in this case. Counsel's\r\nremarks were directed toward the circumstances of George's guilty plea\r\nand not the opposing party or witnesses in this civil trial. Further, in\r\nToyota we noted the element of surprise and found prejudice because\r\ncounsel could not refute such a personal attack. In this case, Dial's\r\ncounsel chose not to object but responded to the racial reference in his\r\nrebuttal argument. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe caution that our decision today in no way condones the sort of\r\nracial argument employed by counsel in this case. When there is no\r\nfactual basis for such an argument, the injection of race is clearly\r\nobjectionable. Had counsel objected, this case would be in a completely\r\ndifferent posture.  We find no reason, however, to extend the narrow\r\nexception of Toyota to cases not involving abuse of a party or witness. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nActing Associate Justices George T. Gregory, Jr. and\r\nL. Henry McKellar, concur. TOAL, A.J., and FINNEY, C.J.,\r\ndissenting in separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n4There is nothing in the record indicating these remarks were supported\r\nby the facts surrounding George's guilty plea. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.7 \r\n  \r\n\r\nTOAL, A.J.: The majority holds that Toyota of Florence, Inc. v. Lynch,\r\n314 S.C. 257, 442 S.E.2d 611 (1994) excuses the failure to make a\r\ncontemporaneous objection, only where the challenged argument constitutes\r\nabuse of a party or witness. Such a holding is not supported by our case\r\nprecedent. Accordingly, I dissent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA reading of Toyota and its predecessor cases reveals that they address\r\nprejudicial arguments by counsel generally, and not just those arguments\r\nthat concern witnesses or litigants. The cases cited by the majority support\r\nthis analysis. In Edwards. v. Union Buffalo Mills Co., 162 S.C. 17, 29, 159\r\nS.E. 818, 822 (1931), we found that \"the language complained of in the case\r\nunder review was highly prejudicial, calculated to arouse the prejudices of the\r\njurors, and did undoubtedly contribute to induce the verdict which was\r\nrendered.\" In Major v. Alverson, 183 S.C. 123~ 126, 190 S.E. 449, 451 (1937),\r\nit was held: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[W]here counsel, as in this case, uses improper and abusive\r\nlanguage in his argument to the jury, to the clear hurt and\r\nprejudice of the complaining party, we feel that it is our duty to\r\nremand the case for trial in accordance with correct and proper\r\nrules of procedure and conduct. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn fact, Major clearly distinguished between improper arguments and abuse\r\nof witnesses: \"Such a statement was not only highly improper as an\r\nargument, but amounted to an abuse of the witness and tended to greatly\r\nprejudice defendant's case in the eyes of the jury.\" Id. at 125, 190 S.E. at\r\n450 (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe majority also cites South Carolina State Highway Department v. \r\nNasim, 255 S.C. 406, 179 S.E.2d 211 (1971). The clear holding of Nasim is\r\nthat objection to improper argument is required, except in flagrant cases and\r\nwhere prejudice appears. The Nasim Court quoted Johnson v. Charleston &amp; \r\nWestern Carolina Railway Company,  234 S.C. 448, 108 S.E.2d 777 (1959) for\r\nthe following proposition: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt has been settled by many decisions of this court that, except\r\nin flagrant cases and where prejudice clearly appears, objection\r\nto improper argument of counsel should be made then and there,\r\nand comes too late if not made until after the verdict has been\r\nrendered. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNasim, 255 S.C. at 410, 179 S.E.2d at 212. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nDIAL v. NIGGEL ASSOCIATES, INC. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNasim then declared: \"We adhere to that rule. We reverse the case\r\nbefore us because the argument falls within the exception.\" This holding was\r\nagain confirmed in the case: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhile it is true that the trial judge has very broad discretion in\r\nthe conduct of trial, the rule does make exception for \"flagrant\r\ncases and where prejudice clearly appears.\" In light of the\r\nvicious inflammatory nature of the remarks made we conclude\r\nthat this case presents the exception allowed by our rule in \r\nJohnson, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNasim, 255 S.C. at 411, 179 S.E.2d at 213. Further, \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt is a general rule of law that inflammatory remarks made\r\nby counsel in argument which are calculated to appeal to the\r\npassions or prejudices of a jury should be affirmatively\r\ncondemned by the trial court. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the final analysis, whether or not the particular arguments are\r\nso prejudicial as to constitute reversible error depends upon the\r\nnature of the utterances and the circumstances under which they\r\nwere made. Here the remarks were so vicious and the likelihood\r\nof prejudice so strong that we are persuaded that the highway\r\ndepartment did not receive a fair and impartial trial which is the\r\ninherent right of every litigant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNasim, 255 S.C. at 411-12, 179 S.E.2d at 213. Nowhere is there any mention\r\nin Nasim that its rule is confined. to abuse of witnesses and litigants. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMost significantly, there is no indication in Toyota that it is restricted\r\nto arguments abusive to a party or witness. Toyota's explicit holding is as\r\nfollows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe general rule is that the lack of a contemporaneous objection\r\nto an improper argument acts as a waiver. This Court has held,\r\nhowever, that even in the absence of a contemporaneous\r\nobjection, a new trial motion should be granted in flagrant cases\r\nwhere a vicious, inflammatory argument results in clear\r\nprejudice. We can hardly conceive of a more outrageous \r\nargument than that made here. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nToyota, 314 S.C. at 263, 442 S.E.2d at 615 (citations omitted)(emphasis \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nDIAL v. NIGGEL ASSOCIATES, INC. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadded). The focus of the opinion is on the improper closing argument. To\r\nsuggest that Toyota applies only to arguments that abuse witnesses or\r\nlitigants is to add to the case a restriction it does not contain. The Court of\r\nAppeals has also recognized the clear holding of Toyota: \"We realize the\r\nSupreme Court has held, even in the absence of a contemporaneous objection,\r\na new trial should be granted in flagrant cases where a vicious, inflammatory\r\nargument results in clear prejudice.\" State v. Peay, 321 S.C. 405, 412-13, 468\r\nS.E.2d 669, 673 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Toyota rule seeks to prevent \"vicious, inflammatory\" arguments.\r\nThis rule protects witnesses and litigants; however, its principal purpose is\r\nto ensure a fair trial by discouraging attorneys from making outrageous and\r\nhighly prejudicial arguments. It is not analytically convincing to suggest that\r\nthis rule should apply only to abusive comments about witnesses and\r\nlitigants, but not to other equally inappropriate comments that do not directly\r\nconcern witnesses and litigants. For example, under the majority's rule, if\r\nduring closing argument, an attorney referred to opposing counsel (or even\r\nthe judge) as \"one who makes Adolf Hitler look like Mother Teresa,\" then\r\nToyota would be inapplicable, despite the grossly inflammatory and\r\nprejudicial nature of the comment. However, if the very same statement\r\nwere made about an expert witness in the case, then the Toyota rule would\r\nbe applicable. There is no reasoned justification for the distinction between\r\nthe two. Perhaps it is for this reason that our case law has never restricted\r\nthe Toyota rule to abusive comments about witnesses and litigants. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt is understandable that in most situations the prejudicial comments\r\nof counsel would probably concern litigants or witnesses; however, simply\r\nbecause this may be the typical situation does not mean that Toyota is\r\nconfined to such situations. Attorneys are clever enough to find other objects\r\nfor their inflammatory comments in order to improperly influence the jury.\r\nThe facts of the instant case are illustrative. Here, although counsel's\r\ncomments did not constitute abuse of a witness or litigant, they were\r\nnevertheless inflammatory and intended to prejudice the jury by \"playing the\r\nrace card.\" Counsel, in the course of his argument, deliberately painted the\r\nimage of Niggel's driver, Freddie George, being railroaded. The word\r\n\"railroaded\" was repeatedly mentioned in the course of the argument.\r\nCounsel stated George is \"on a set of tracks\" to prison because a police officer\r\nhad died. He then said: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNow, if you're drunk and you're driving, you know you're guilty\r\nof D.U.I. and you've got a dead cop and there ain't no evidence\r\n that you can put your hands on that's going to help you, what \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.10\r\n\r\nDIAL v. NIGGEL ASSOCIATES, INC. et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelse you going to do? You're a black man and there's a white\r\npolice officer dead in the car over there. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCounsel set up the \"railroaded\" argument to ultimately play on the racial\r\nfeelings of the jury. His evident purpose was to plant in the jury's mind the\r\nidea that defendant George's guilty plea to felony driving under the influence\r\nwas somehow the product of a racially discriminatory prosecution. There is\r\nabsolutely nothing in the record to support counsel's veiled charge of racism.\r\nThis sort of unjustifiable attack on the integrity of a previous, legitimate\r\ncourt proceeding, in order to gain advantage in another court proceeding,\r\nundermines the very foundation of the American jury trial system. This\r\nCourt should not countenance or reward such conduct. I find this to be\r\nentirely improper and would grant a new trial under Toyota. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., concurs. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24860","title":"In the Matter of Mark E.

Hall\r\n(Respondent) is charged with engaging in misconduct in violation of various\r\nprovisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) contained in Rule 407,\r\nSCACR, and the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE)\r\ncontained in Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUNE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Commission) began a full\r\ninvestigation into these matters in April and June 1997. Respondent initially\r\ndenied any wrongdoing, but provided incomplete information to investigators.\r\nHe did not respond after the filing of formal, charges in October 1997 and\r\nwent into default. Respondent did not appear at the subpanel hearing in\r\nJanuary 1998; nor did he appear at the hearing before this Court. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe subpanel found misconduct and recommended disbarment. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.12 \r\n  \r\n\r\nMATTER OF HALL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full panel adopted the report and recommended sanction. We agree with\r\nthe panel's findings and conclusions about Respondent's misconduct.\r\nHowever, we find Respondent's acts warrant an indefinite suspension from\r\nthe practice of law. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCHILD SUPPORT MATTER \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA family court judge ordered Respondent in October 1994 to pay\r\n$113 per week in child support to Brenda J. Kent, the mother of\r\nRespondent's minor child. The order required Respondent to pay the funds\r\nthrough family court in Richland County, which would forward the funds to\r\na child support agency in Minnesota, where Ms. Kent and the child lived.\r\nRespondent failed to make all payments, and by January 1997 was $15,480\r\nin arrears. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt an enforcement hearing, Respondent submitted an affidavit in\r\nwhich he claimed he had paid Ms. Kent $10,300 -- in cash at her request --\r\nfrom November 1994 to December 1996. He stated he went to Minnesota in\r\nlate 1996 to resolve his payment record, but was unable to meet with child\r\nsupport officials due to bad weather and closed government offices. Ms. Kent\r\ntold him that she would notify officials in Minnesota and South Carolina\r\nabout the payments he had made, Respondent stated. The judge found\r\nRespondent in contempt and sentenced him to one year, suspended upon\r\npayment of $5,000 towards the arrearage. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn an affidavit filed after the enforcement hearing, a Minnesota\r\nchild support officer stated that Respondent had paid Ms.Kent $5,154, but\r\nstill owed her $9,988 in missed payments.1 The child support office was open\r\non the day Respondent claimed he was in town to discuss the matter, and\r\nRespondent never contacted the child support office, the officer stated. Ms.\r\nKent stated in an affidavit she had not received the payments Respondent\r\npurportedly made, and never asked him to pay her in cash. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent attempted to explain his actions in a letter to\r\ndisciplinary counsel in April 1997. However, Respondent's failure to answer\r\nthe formal charges, as well as his failure to appear before the hearing panel \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 It is unclear why the South Carolina family court records show a\r\nlarger arrearage than that claimed by the Minnesota official. Regardless,\r\nRespondent was substantially behind in his payments. \r\n  \r\np13\r\n\r\nMATTER OF HALL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor this Court, constitutes an admission of the factual allegations. Rule 24, RLDE. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSMITH MATTER \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent represented Wilmarth K. Smith, who was injured in\r\nOctober 1995 when she fell in the parking lot at the Chamber of Commerce\r\nin Columbia. The parties settled the case in July 1996 for $2,775.50, paid\r\nto Ms. Smith and Respondent in two checks, one for $2,275.50 and one for\r\n$500. Respondent did not have a written retainer agreement signed by Ms.\r\nSmith; nor did he give her a written settlement statement. Respondent gave\r\nMs. Smith a check for $500, which she was unable to cash due to insufficient\r\nfunds. When she contacted Respondent about the problem, he gave her\r\nanother check for $2,500.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAn analysis of Respondent's trust account, based on records\r\nobtained by subpoena from the bank and Respondent, showed Respondent\r\ndeposited $2,000 of the first settlement check and kept the remainder in\r\ncash. He apparently deposited the second settlement check of $500. A few\r\ndays later, Respondent wrote himself a check drawn on his trust account for\r\n$2,500, labeling it \"attorney fee,\" The account was overdrawn by $300\r\nshortly after Respondent deposited Ms. Smith's settlement checks, indicating\r\nhe misappropriated Ms. Smith's funds to his own use. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent initially refused to provide Ms. Smith's entire case file\r\nand pertinent bank records when contacted by disciplinary counsel. He failed\r\nto cooperate with investigators despite repeated telephone calls and letters.\r\nHe promised to provide certain documents after an investigator visited him\r\nat his office, but failed to do so. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent attempted to explain his actions in letters to\r\ndisciplinary counsel in April and August 1997. Again, his failure to answer\r\nthe formal charges or appear constitutes an admission of the factual\r\nallegations. Rule 24, RLDE. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 The record does not reveal whether Ms. Smith was able to cash\r\nthe $2,500 check. Disciplinary authorities told the subpanel that Ms.\r\nSmith received part of her money from Respondent, at least $500 to\r\n$1,500. \r\n  \r\np.14\r\n\r\nMATTER OF HALL \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAST MISCONDUCT \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThree years ago, the Court publicly reprimanded Respondent for\r\ninappropriately handling a real estate transaction. The Court also\r\nreprimanded Respondent for depositing settlement checks into his operating\r\naccount instead of his trust account. No clients lost any funds. Matter of \r\nHall, 319 S.C. 358, 461 S.E.2d 396 (1995). The Bar suspended Respondent's\r\nlicense March 20, 1998, for failure to pay Bar dues. The Court issued an\r\norder August 7, 1998, holding Respondent in contempt, but that order has not\r\nbeen served upon Respondent because he cannot be located. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Court has the ultimate authority to discipline attorneys, and\r\nthe Commission's findings are not binding. Matter of Dobson, 310 S.C. 422,\r\n 427 S.E.2d 166 (1993). However, such findings are entitled to great weight.\r\nMatter of Lake, 269 S.C. 170, 236 S.E.2d 812 (1977). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter examining the facts, we find Respondent's misconduct has\r\nbeen proven by clear and convincing evidence. In the family court matter,\r\nRespondent committed misconduct by making false statements of material\r\nfact to the family court and the Commission, and by willfully violating the\r\nterms of a valid court order.

Those who do must understand that \"neglecting to\r\nparticipate [in a disciplinary proceeding] is entitled to substantial weight in\r\n determining the sanction.\" Matter of Sifly, 279 S.C. 113, 115, 302 S.E.2d\r\n858, 859 (1983). An attorney's failure to answer charges or appear to defend\r\nor explain alleged misconduct indicates an obvious disinterest in the practice\r\nof law. Such an attorney is likely to face the most severe sanctions because\r\na central purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect the public from\r\nunscrupulous and indifferent lawyers. See Preamble to Rule 407, SCACR;\r\nRule 1, RLDE. In more egregious cases, we have disbarred attorneys who\r\nfailed to answer formal charges or appear at hearings before the Commission\r\nor this Court. See Matter of Wofford, 330 S.C. 522, 500 S.E.2d 486 (1998)\r\n(disbarring attorney who failed to answer formal charges, appear at panel\r\nhearing or before Court; attorney in several cases failed to provide competent\r\nrepresentation, keep clients reasonably informed, and promptly deliver funds\r\nto third person; attorney also misappropriated client funds and committed\r\ncriminal acts); Matter of Meede, 327 S.C. 169, 488 S.E.2d 875 (1997)\r\n(disbarring attorney who responded initially, but failed to answer formal\r\ncharges or ask for panel hearing; attorney continued to represent client after\r\nhe was suspended for multiple counts of misconduct); Matter of Sifly, supra\r\n(disbarring attorney who failed to appear before the disciplinary panel or the\r\nCourt; attorney mishandled two cases and wrote bad checks). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe previously have imposed a sanction other than disbarment\r\nupon attorneys who engaged in misconduct similar to Respondent's.

STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrown was convicted of distribution of cocaine and distribution of\r\ncocaine within one-half mile of a school and sentenced to 30 years and 5\r\nyears, respectively. The indictment setting forth the proximity charge\r\nindicates Brown distributed cocaine within one-half mile of the grounds of\r\nBelleville Middle School. At PCR, Brown contended his trial counsel was\r\nineffective in failing to measure the distance between Belleville Middle School\r\nand the location at which he was alleged to have made the sale, 2190 Russell\r\nStreet. Brown contended he had \"clocked\" the mileage in his vehicle and the\r\ndistance was approximately 1 mile on his odometer reading. Two other\r\nwitnesses also testified at PCR that they believed Belleville School was more\r\nthan one mile from 2190 Russell Street.1 Brown's trial attorney testified at\r\nPCR that he sent his investigator to determine the proximity of the school,\r\nand the investigator reported to him that 2190 Russell Street was within one-\r\nhalf mile of the school. It was counsel's belief that proximity was not\r\nmeasured by odometer readings but was, rather, measured \"as the crow flies\"\r\nin a straight line. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe PCR court found there was \"a substantial question as to the\r\ndistance between 2190 Russell Street and the Belleview Middle School.\"\r\nAccordingly, the court concluded counsel was ineffective in failing to\r\nsubstantiate the difference between the school and the residence, and that his\r\ndeficiency had prejudiced the defense. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDid the PCR court err in finding counsel ineffective? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann.Â§ 44-53-445(A) (Supp. 1997) provides: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt is a separate criminal offense for a person to distribute, sell,\r\npurchase, manufacture, or to unlawfully possess with intent to\r\ndistribute, a controlled substance while in, on, or within a\r\none-half mile radius of the grounds of a public or private\r\nelementary, middle, or secondary school; a public playground or \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n1One of the witnesses, Brunson Rush, testified \"I think it's more than\r\none mile\" from the school to 2190 Russell Street. The other witness, Brown's\r\nfather, testified he had checked it \"in general\" by the odometer and thought\r\nthe distance was a bit over a mile, but that he had not made a thorough check. \r\n  \r\np.18\r\n\r\nBROWN v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npark; a public vocational or trade school or technical educational\r\ncenter; or a public or private college or university. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"Radius\" is defined as \"a straight line drawn from the center of a circle or\r\nsphere to any point on its periphery...\" NEW WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY\r\nAND THESAURUS, 825 (1993)(Emphasis supplied). Courts addressing the\r\nissue have uniformly held proximity is measured in a straight line, or \"as the\r\ncrow flies.\" See Jackson v. State, 582 So.2d 598 (Ala. App. 1991)(shortest\r\ndistance between two points, i.e. a \"straight line,\" refers to \"as the crow\r\nflies\"); Howard v. State, 591 So. 2d 1067 (Fla. App. 1991)(distance from school\r\nis measured, not as the car drives, but \"as the crow flies\"); Commonwealth \r\nv. Spano, 605 N.E.2d 1241 (Mass. 1993)(holding distance is measured in a\r\nstraight line); State v.  Ogar, 551 A.2d 1037 (N.J. Super. 1989)(distance\r\nmeasured \"as the crow flies\" from outermost boundaries of school grounds);\r\nState v. Vigh, 871P.2d 1030 (Utah App. 1994)(distance measured in a\r\nstraight line rather than by pedestrian travel route); State v. Wimbs, 874\r\nP.2d 193 (Wash. App. 1994). We agree with these courts that the only way\r\nto uniformly measure the distance between a school, church or other\r\nprotected location and the location where illegal drugs were sold is to do so\r\nin a straight line. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn a post-conviction proceeding, the burden is on the applicant to prove\r\nthe allegations in his application. Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d\r\n813 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1094, 106 S.Ct. 869, 88 L.Ed.2d 908 (1986).\r\nAs to allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the applicant must show\r\nhis counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\r\nand but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability the result at\r\ntrial would have been different. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104\r\nS.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d\r\n733 (1997). A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine\r\nconfidence in the outcome of the trial. Johnson v. State, supra. This Court\r\nmust affirm the findings of the PCR judge if they are supported by any\r\nevidence in the record. Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHere, Brown failed to offer any evidence at PCR as to the distance\r\nbetween Belleville School and 2190 Russell Street as measured in a straight\r\nline. As there is no evidence the distance as measured in a straight line\r\nexceeds one-half mile, the PCR court's findings are not supported by any\r\nevidence. Accordingly, the judgment below is \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.19 \r\n  \r\n\r\nBROWN v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n2The PCR court also ruled Brown was entitled to a new trial on the\r\ndistribution charge as it could not determine the impact of the proximity\r\ncharge on the distribution conviction. As Brown is not entitled to a new trial\r\non the proximity charge, he is not entitled to a new trial on the distribution\r\ncharge. The PCR court's ruling on this issue is also reversed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24862","title":"In the Matter of Ginger P.

Matson, of Covington, Texas, pro se. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPER CURIAM: In this disciplinary matter, respondent is\r\ncharged with engaging in misconduct in violation of various provisions of\r\nthe Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR (RLDE),\r\nand the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe formal charges include allegations respondent was late for\r\nclients' hearings and settlement conferences and was unprepared for these\r\nhearings; failed to properly serve opposing parties thus delaying the\r\nhearings; failed to finalize documents for clients and failed to send\r\nproposed orders to the family court judge for his approval and signature;\r\nfailed to return clients' telephone calls inquiring about the status of their\r\ncases and failed to keep appointments with her clients; lied to a client\r\nabout filing a pleading; rendered erroneous advice to a client about a legal\r\nmatter causing the client harm; and failed to comply with a discovery\r\norder resulting in prejudice to her client.  When respondent was unable to\r\nattend a hearing, respondent's paralegal sent a legal secretary to represent \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.21 \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Matson \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe client and to request a continuance from the judge. Further,\r\nrespondent closed her practice in South Carolina and moved to Texas\r\nwithout notifying her clients. Respondent failed to return files to her\r\nclients and failed to either refund clients their retainer fees or provide\r\nthem an accounting of the earned fees. Respondent repeatedly failed to\r\nrespond to letters from the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Commission)\r\ninquiring into these matters. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent did not file an answer to the formal charges.1\r\nAlthough respondent did not appear at the Commission's subpanel hearing\r\nof the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Commission) on January 8, 1998,\r\nthe subpanel allowed respondent to offer evidence in mitigation by\r\ntestifying by telephone. The subpanel found respondent had committed\r\nmisconduct and, by a vote of 3 to 1, recommended definitely suspending\r\nrespondent for 18 months, retroactive to the date of respondent's interim\r\nsuspension,2 with conditions that prior to readmittance: (1) respondent\r\nmust pay all the fees owed to her clients pursuant to any order issued by\r\na Fee Dispute Resolution Committee; (2) respondent must return all client\r\nfiles to her clients or their new attorneys; and (3) respondent must\r\ncooperate with any attorney appointed by the Supreme Court to protect\r\nher clients' interests. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent did not file exceptions to the subpanel's report.\r\nThe full panel adopted this report on June 11, 1998. Respondent failed to\r\nappear for oral argument before this Court. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBecause respondent failed to respond to the formal charges or\r\nto appear for oral argument, pursuant to Rule 24, RLDE, respondent is\r\ndeemed to have admitted the factual allegations' contained in the formal\r\ncharges. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe admitted factual allegations of the formal charges fully \r\n  \r\n\r\n1Respondent was suspended on May 15, 1997 for failure to comply\r\nwith CLE requirements. On January 7, 1998, this Court placed\r\nrespondent on interim suspension. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2 One member recommended a 12-month suspension of respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.22 \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Matson \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport the conclusion that respondent committed misconduct by violating\r\nRLDE and Rule 407, SCACR. By her various instances of misconduct,\r\nrespondent had violated Rule 7, RLDE, by violating the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct; by engaging in conduct tending to pollute the\r\nadministration of justice or bring the court or legal profession into\r\ndisrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law; by\r\nviolating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this\r\nState; and by knowingly failing, on a number of occasions, to respond to\r\nlawful demands from the Commission and the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel, including a request for a response under Rule 19, RLDE. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFurther, she has violated Rule 1.1 (failure to provide\r\ncompetent representation); Rule 1.4(a) (failure to keep clients reasonably\r\ninformed about the status of matters and comply with reasonable requests\r\nfor information); Rule 1.2(a) (failure to consult with clients as to the\r\nmeans by which the client's decisions concerning objectives of\r\nrepresentation were to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (failure to act with\r\nreasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.15\r\n(failure to deliver promptly to a client funds or documents which the client\r\nwas entitled to receive and failure to provide an accounting); Rule 1.16(a)\r\n(failure to withdraw from representation of a client if representation would\r\nresult in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 1.16(d)\r\n(failure upon termination of representation to take steps to the extent\r\nreasonably practicable to protect the client's interest); Rule 5.3 (failure to\r\nproperly supervise a non-lawyer assistant); Rule 5.5 (allowing a non-lawyer\r\nassistant to perform an activity that constituted the unauthorized practice\r\nof law); Rule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit\r\nor misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to\r\nthe administration of justice) of Rule 407, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn mitigation, these incidents of misconduct occurred during\r\nthe time that respondent was regularly traveling to Texas to care for her\r\nailing parents. Respondent's father died in July 1995 and her mother's\r\nhealth began to fail. Respondent's mother was diagnosed with cancer in\r\nDecember 1996 and died in January 1997. Because of these burdens,\r\nrespondent became distracted and failed to properly oversee her law\r\npractice. After her mother's death, respondent closed her practice in\r\nSouth Carolina and moved to Texas. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Court has the sole authority to discipline attorneys and to\r\ndecide the appropriate sanction.
