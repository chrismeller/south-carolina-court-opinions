A\r\nHearing Panel of the Commission found Respondent had committed misconduct in\r\nthe course of this representation by (1) charging excessive fees, (2) failing to\r\ncooperate during probate court proceedings and making a false statement under\r\noath, and (3) engaging in a conflict of interest. We find Respondent has committed\r\nmisconduct warranting the imposition of a one-year definite suspension and order\r\nRespondent to pay the costs of these proceedings.\r\n\r\nI.    BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      Respondent was admitted to the practice of law in South Carolina on\r\nJanuary 3, 1995. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (\"ODC\") filed Formal\r\n\nCharges against Respondent on August 14, 2009 alleging he committed\r\nmisconduct in his representation of Lillian J. McLure (\"Lillian\"). Respondent filed\r\na Response to Formal Charges on September 17, 2009 denying the pertinent\r\nallegations. The Hearing Panel conducted a two-day hearing on the charges on\r\nJune 30 and July 1, 2010.\r\nII.           PANEL REPORT\r\nA.            Findings of Fact\r\n       The Hearing Panel issued a Panel Report that was filed with the Commission\r\non December 15, 2011. The Hearing Panel made the following Findings of Fact,\r\nwhich we find are fully supported by the record. In August 2000, Respondent\r\nprepared two wills for Lillian and her husband, Francis G. McLure (\"Frank\"), in\r\nwhich each left everything to the other. Frank had always handled the couple's\r\nfinancial matters and took care of Lillian during their marriage. Lillian, who was\r\nthen in her late 70s, was described as being a very trusting person who had a\r\nlimited formal education and needed help with her financial affairs.\r\n       A few months later, in October 2000, Respondent prepared what he termed a\r\n\"sham\" will for Frank at Frank's request.1 In the new will, Frank devised $100,000\r\nto his sister-in-law, Ann McLure (\"Ann\"), and made smaller bequests to others.\r\nFrank told Respondent that he made this new will \"[t]o get [Ann] off his back\"\r\nabout an inheritance. Frank informed Respondent that all of his assets, with the\r\nexception of a vehicle, were titled in the names of himself and Lillian as joint\r\ntenants with a right of survivorship. Consequently, Ann would be unable to find\r\nsufficient assets in the estate to fund the bequests. Frank intended that all of his\r\nassets would go to Lillian. At some point, Respondent also prepared one or more\r\ndocuments giving Ann a power of attorney for both Frank and Lillian.\r\n      Frank died on January 3, 2001. Thereafter, Ann, using a power of attorney,\r\nremoved $130,000 from a joint checking account held by Lillian and her husband.\r\nThe money was taken without Lillian's knowledge or permission and was\r\ndiscovered when she reviewed her banking statements. Ann also took a vehicle,\r\nFrank's ashes, and Frank's financial notebooks.\r\n      Lillian retained Respondent to protect her late husband's estate and to\r\nrecover the funds taken by Ann. In May 2001, Respondent wrote to Lillian's\r\n                                                            \r\n1 Frank's October 2000 will was ultimately admitted to probate by the probate\r\ncourt judge, who found it was the later will and was properly executed, witnessed,\r\nand notarized.\r\n\nfamily members in New York and recommended the appointment of a conservator\r\nto protect her interests because \"[a] conservator must file accountings with the\r\nCourt, whereas someone who has her Power of Attorney can transfer and acquire\r\nany or all of her assets without being accountable to anyone.\" Respondent never\r\nobtained a conservator, although he acknowledged that he did not need the family's\r\nassistance to have one appointed. Thereafter, on June 26, 2001, Respondent had\r\nLillian execute a written Contract for Legal Services, which called for Respondent\r\n(1) to \"marshal\" the assets of Frank's estate for a 25% contingency fee, and (2) to\r\nfile a conversion action against Ann.2\r\n       Respondent also prepared the following documents signed by Lillian: (1) an\r\nIrrevocable Living Trust dated July 16, 2001, which named Respondent as the sole\r\ntrustee; (2) a Last Will and Testament, executed on July 24, 2001, designating\r\nhimself the personal representative for Lillian's estate; and (3) a General Durable\r\nPower of Attorney, executed on October 19, 2001, which appointed Respondent as\r\nLillian's attorney-in-fact. Respondent did not advise Lillian to seek outside\r\ncounsel to review these documents.\r\n\r\n       Thereafter, Respondent refused to turn over documents to George\r\nMcDowell, the attorney appointed to handle Frank's estate. McDowell had\r\nrequested the records in order to perform his duty to file an accounting of Frank's\r\nestate. The probate court requested that Respondent bring Lillian to a scheduled\r\nprobate court hearing. Around October 2001, however, Lillian moved to an\r\nassisted living facility in Catskill, New York, and Respondent failed to reveal her\r\nlocation despite repeated requests from McDowell.\r\n        In subsequent probate court hearings concerning Frank's estate, Respondent\r\nadmittedly failed to cooperate in turning over documents needed for the\r\naccounting. In addition, he falsely told the probate court judge that he did not\r\nknow where Lillian resided and repeatedly refused to reveal Lillian's whereabouts.\r\nRespondent maintained in his testimony to the Hearing Panel that he was\r\nprotecting Lillian from Ann, the probate court judge, and others, but he\r\nacknowledged there were other methods, besides making false statements under\r\noath, to protect his client. Although Respondent still insisted that he did not know\r\nwhere Lillian was the day of the hearing, because she was traveling, he conceded\r\nthat he did know where Lillian resided because he was paying for her bills at the\r\nassisted living facility.\r\n                                                            \r\n2 Respondent maintained he believed Lillian to be competent at that time. Medical\r\nevidence in the record, prepared in 2002, subsequently called into question Lillian's\r\nabilities.\r\n\n      Respondent ultimately settled a malpractice action brought against him by\r\nMcDowell on behalf of Lillian. Respondent did not admit liability, but he\r\ncontributed $35,000 towards the settlement amount of $245,000, with the\r\nremainder being paid for by his insurance carrier. McDowell also recovered the\r\nfunds taken by Ann.\r\nB.            Misconduct\r\n       Based on the foregoing, the Hearing Panel found Respondent committed\r\nmisconduct in three areas. First, Respondent charged excessive legal fees. The\r\nHearing Panel questioned the need for Respondent's charges when he could have\r\naccomplished faster results by immediately revoking Ann's power of attorney and\r\nsending the revocation to the appropriate account holders. Ultimately, Respondent\r\nmarshaled only nine assets, all of which Lillian had held in joint tenancy with her\r\nlate husband with a right of survivorship. However, pursuant to his 25%\r\ncontingency fee arrangement, Respondent charged a fee of $115,000 to marshal the\r\nassets for an estate valued at less than $500,000. Respondent also sold Lillian's\r\nmarital home to a buyer who was presented to him by one of Lillian's neighbors,\r\nyet he charged a 25% marshaling fee on the home sale pursuant to his contact for\r\nservices. He also distributed a total of $75,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the\r\nhome to two of Lillian's neighbors. One neighbor described this as an\r\n\"extraordinarily generous\" gift while simultaneously acknowledging that Lillian\r\ndid not have a good understanding of what things cost. Respondent did not change\r\nhis form of compensation to an hourly rate when he saw the true nature of the work\r\ninvolved, and the Hearing Panel noted \"Respondent did nothing more than what a\r\npersonal representative of the estate would have done for a much lesser fee.\"3\r\n      Second, Respondent failed to cooperate and made a false statement under\r\noath during the probate court proceedings. Respondent failed to turn over\r\ndocuments to the attorney appointed to handle the estate of Lillian's late husband\r\nand he untruthfully stated he did not know Lillian's whereabouts when he was\r\naware Lillian was staying at an assisted living facility in New York because he was\r\npaying her bills there.\r\n      Third, Respondent engaged in a conflict of interest. Respondent failed to\r\nadvise Lillian to seek outside counsel to review the documents Respondent created\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n3 The fee for a personal representative is statutorily limited to five percent \"of the\r\nappraised value of the personal property of the probate estate plus the sales\r\nproceeds of real property of the probate estate,\" except where \"otherwise approved\r\nby the court for extraordinary services.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-719(a) (2009).  \r\n\ngiving himself Lillian's power of attorney, making himself the sole trustee of her\r\nIrrevocable Living Trust, and naming himself as Lillian's personal representative.\r\nC.            Violation of Disciplinary Rules\r\n       The Hearing Panel found Respondent had violated the following provisions\r\nof the Rules of Professional Conduct (\"RPC\") contained in Rule 407, SCACR:\r\nRule 1.1 (competence); Rule 1.3 (diligence); Rule 1.5(a) (reasonableness of fee);\r\nRule 1.7(b)4 (conflict of interest); Rule 1.8(a) (pecuniary interest); Rule 3.2\r\n(expediting litigation); Rule 3.3(a)(1) (false statement of fact or law to a tribunal);\r\nRule 3.4(a) (unlawfully obstructing another party's access to evidence); Rule 3.4(c)\r\n(knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal); Rule 8.4(a)\r\n(violating or attempting to violate the RPC); Rule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct\r\ninvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e)\r\n(engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\n       In addition, it concluded Respondent had violated the following provisions\r\nof the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (\"RLDE\") contained in Rule\r\n413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating or attempting to violate the RPC); Rule\r\n7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to\r\nbring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or demonstrating an unfitness\r\nto practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the Oath of Office taken upon the\r\nadmission to practice law in South Carolina).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n4 Rule 1.7(b) of the RPC provided at the time of Respondent's misconduct that a\r\nlawyer shall not represent a client if the representation may be materially limited\r\nby the lawyer's own interests or responsibilities to another client, unless the lawyer\r\nreasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected and the client\r\nconsents after consultation. Rule 1.7 was amended in 2005. Respondent's\r\nrepresentation of Frank in preparing a second will adverse to Lillian's interests was\r\nalso arguably a conflict of interest and this conduct is, in essence, the source of all\r\nof the subsequent problems in this matter. However, as the Hearing Panel noted,\r\nalthough Respondent's witness (and former counsel) suggested Respondent's\r\npreparation of the second will was a conflict of interest since Respondent had\r\nprepared joint wills for the couple only a few months before, ODC did not pursue\r\nan allegation in this regard.\r\n\nD.    Aggravating & Mitigating Factors; Recommended Sanction\r\n\r\n       The Hearing Panel found the following three aggravating factors: (1) a\r\ndishonest or selfish motive (Respondent's lack of cooperation during the probate\r\ncourt proceedings was for the purpose of concealing his excessive fee and the\r\nmishandling of Lillian's funds); (2) Respondent's disciplinary history (on October\r\n19, 2001, Respondent received a Letter of Caution with a finding of minor\r\nmisconduct citing Rules 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1 of the RPC, Rule 407, SCACR);\r\nand (3) the vulnerability of the victim (the Hearing Panel found Respondent's\r\nactions \"most troubling\" since Respondent himself had initially recommended the\r\nappointment of a conservator to protect Lillian's interests, and Lillian was a very\r\ntrusting and naïve person who clearly relied on Respondent to adequately handle\r\nher financial matters, yet Respondent had her execute an unreasonable fee\r\nagreement and failed to properly manage her assets and funds).\r\n\r\n       The Hearing Panel found two mitigating factors: (1) the delay in the\r\ndisciplinary proceedings, which were pending over a period of many years; and\r\n(2) the imposition of other sanctions or penalties, i.e., the fact that Respondent had\r\nsettled a malpractice action arising out of this matter, in which he contributed\r\n$35,000 towards the settlement amount of $245,000.\r\n\r\n       The Hearing Panel recommended that Respondent be suspended from the\r\npractice of law for one year and that he be ordered to pay the costs of these\r\nproceedings. The costs reported by the Commission are $3,086.64.\r\n\r\nIV.   LAW\r\n\r\n       Neither Respondent nor ODC has filed a brief with this Court taking\r\nexception to the Panel Report and the recommended sanction of a definite\r\nsuspension of one year. See Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (\"The failure of\r\na party to file a brief taking exceptions to the report constitutes acceptance of the\r\nfindings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations.\").\r\n\r\n       The authority to discipline attorneys rests entirely with this Court. In re\r\nWhite, 391 S.C. 581, 707 S.E.2d 411 (2011); see also S.C. Const. art. V, § 4 (\"The\r\nSupreme Court shall have jurisdiction over the admission to the practice of law and\r\nthe discipline of persons admitted.\"). The Court \"has the sole authority . . . to\r\ndecide the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the record.\" In re\r\nThompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000). \"The Court is not bound\r\nby the panel's recommendation and may make its own findings of fact and\r\n\nconclusions of law.\" In re Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661 S.E.2d 102,\r\n106 (2008); see also Rule 27(e)(2), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (\"The Supreme\r\nCourt may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part the findings, conclusions\r\nand recommendations of the Commission.\").\r\n\r\n       \"A disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing\r\nevidence.\" In re Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see also\r\nRule 8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (\"Charges of misconduct or incapacity shall be\r\nestablished by clear and convincing evidence, and the burden of proof of the\r\ncharges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.\").\r\n\r\n      Pursuant to Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, the factual findings made\r\nby the Commission are deemed admitted by Respondent's failure to file a brief, and\r\nwe find they are fully supported by the record. Further, we agree with the Hearing\r\nPanel that the factual findings support a finding of misconduct. Having found\r\nODC has established Respondent's misconduct by clear and convincing evidence,\r\nthis Court need only determine the appropriate sanction. In re Hursey, 395 S.C.\r\n527, 719 S.E.2d 670 (2011).\r\n\r\n        After carefully considering the entire record in this matter, including the\r\ntranscripts and exhibits submitted to this Court, we conclude the recommendation\r\nof the Hearing Panel for a one-year definite suspension is an appropriate sanction\r\nfor Respondent's misconduct. See In re Prendergast, 390 S.C. 395, 402, 702\r\nS.E.2d 364, 367 (2010) (\"Although Rule 1.8 does not prohibit attorney-client\r\nbusiness relationships, it clearly delineates three mandatory requirements an\r\nattorney must satisfy to comply with the standards of ethical conduct.\"); In re\r\nCrummey, 388 S.C. 286, 289-91, 696 S.E.2d 589, 591 (2010) (noting the attorney\r\nadmitted that she drafted documents naming herself as personal representative and\r\ntrustee for a trust without having the client seek the advice of other counsel, and\r\nshe failed to make an accounting to the new personal representative and to the\r\nprobate court; among other rules, this Court found Respondent had violated the\r\nfollowing provisions of the RPC: Rule 3.2 (reasonable efforts to expedite\r\nlitigation); Rule 3.3 (false statement of fact to tribunal); Rule 4.1 (false statement\r\nof fact to third person when representing a client); Rule 8.4(a) (violating the RPC);\r\nRule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and\r\nmisrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of\r\njustice)); In re Jones, 359 S.C. 156, 597 S.E.2d 800 (2004) (imposing a one-year\r\nsuspension for the attorney's misconduct in misrepresenting to disciplinary\r\ncounsel, while under oath, that he was not licensed to practice law in another state,\r\nthus violating Rule 3.3, along with his misconduct in failing to perfect a criminal\r\n\ndefendant's direct appeal, to file a divorce on behalf of a client, and to cooperate in\r\ndisciplinary proceedings); cf. In re Wilmeth, 373 S.C. 631, 632-33, 647 S.E.2d 185,\r\n186 (2007) (sanctioning attorney with disbarment, pursuant to an agreement for\r\ndiscipline, for misconduct in seven matters; the Court noted the attorney had\r\n\"drafted [] wills for two individuals and named herself as an alternate and/or\r\nsubstitute personal representative in each of the wills without complying with the\r\nprovisions of Rule 1.8, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR,\" charged excessive attorney's fees\r\nand statutory personal representative's fees, and had \"misappropriated $861,367.52\r\nfrom either one or both of the estates\").\r\n\r\n       We also agree with the Hearing Panel's recommendation regarding the\r\npayment of costs. The imposition of costs and the determination of their amount\r\nare within this Court's discretion. See In re Thompson, 343 S.C. at 13, 539 S.E.2d\r\nat 402 (\"The assessment of costs is in the discretion of the Court.\"); Rule 27(e)(3),\r\nRLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (\"The Supreme Court may assess costs against the\r\nrespondent if it finds the respondent has committed misconduct. Unless otherwise\r\nordered by the Court, costs shall be paid within 30 days of the filing of the opinion\r\nor order assessing costs.\"); Rule 7(b)(6), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR5 (stating\r\nsanctions for misconduct may include ordering payment of the costs of the\r\nproceedings). The payment of costs is a crucial component of any disciplinary\r\naction, and it is within the scope of allowable sanctions frequently implemented by\r\nthis Court. In re Prendergast, 390 S.C. at 403-04, 702 S.E.2d at 368.\r\n\r\nV.            CONCLUSION\r\n       We hereby suspend Respondent from the practice of law in this state for one\r\nyear. Respondent is also ordered to reimburse the Commission for the costs\r\nincurred in these proceedings, which total $3,086.64. Within fifteen days of the\r\ndate of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court\r\nshowing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR (duties of\r\nattorney following disbarment or suspension).\r\n\r\n              DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n     TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n5   This provision was formerly Rule 7(b)(8), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27150","title":"In the Matter of George E.

Lafaye, III, of Columbia, pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\ndisbarment. He requests that disbarment be imposed retroactively to the date of his\r\ninterim suspension, April 21, 2011. In the Matter of Lafaye, 392 S.C. 312, 709\r\nS.E.2d 625 (2011). In addition, respondent agrees to pay the costs incurred by\r\nODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) in the\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of this matter within thirty (30) days of his\r\ndisbarment. Further, respondent agrees to pay restitution of $365,747.58, plus\r\ninterest, and legal fees of $4,310.90 to Commonwealth Land Title Insurance\r\nCompany and to pay restitution to the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection\r\n(Lawyers' Fund), reimbursing it for all claims paid on his behalf. Respondent\r\nagrees to pay restitution within one (1) year of his disbarment.\r\n\nThe Agreement provides that respondent shall file proof of payment of restitution\r\nwith the Commission no later than one (1) year from the date of the Court's order\r\nof disbarment and, if funds currently held in trust or operating accounts by the\r\nattorney appointed to protect the interests of respondent's clients are used to pay\r\nany of the above obligations, respondent's obligations shall be reduced by the\r\namount paid. The Agreement further provides that respondent and Commonwealth\r\nLand Title Insurance Company may negotiate repayment of a lesser amount and\r\nthat, should the title company confirm payment of a lesser amount in full\r\nsatisfaction of respondent's debt, respondent's restitution obligation shall be\r\ndeemed paid in full.\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this\r\nState retroactive to the date of his interim suspension. In addition, we impose the\r\nconditions as stated in this opinion. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as\r\nfollows.                                Facts\r\n\r\nRespondent operated a solo practice from 1994 until his interim suspension on\r\nApril 21, 2011. In 2009, the Commission received a report of an overdraft on\r\nrespondent's trust account. During the course of the ensuing investigation by\r\nODC, respondent admitted he failed to ensure deposits were credited to his trust\r\naccount prior to disbursement in violation of Rule 1.15, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nHe also admitted he was delinquent in reconciling his trust account as required by\r\nRule 417, SCACR.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the 2009 investigation, respondent retained an attorney and an\r\naccountant. Based on information and documents supplied by respondent,\r\nrespondent's counsel and accountant represented to ODC that they had assisted\r\nrespondent in becoming compliant with Rule 417, SCACR, and that respondent's\r\ntrust account reconciliations had been brought up to date. In reliance on the\r\nrepresentations made by respondent's counsel and accountant, and respondent's\r\nagreement to comply with Rule 1.15, RPC, and Rule 417, SCACR, in the future,\r\nODC agreed to the Commission concluding the matter with a confidential\r\nadmonition. The admonition was issued on July 31, 2009. At the time of the\r\nresolution of that investigation, respondent did not disclose the existence of a\r\nsecond trust account to ODC.\r\n\r\nOn December 23, 2010, respondent conducted a closing for Mr. and Mrs. A who\r\nrefinanced their home mortgage. Respondent received the funds in his second trust\r\n\naccount by wire from Mr. and Mrs. A's new lender. Respondent was to pay off\r\nMr. and Mrs. A's prior mortgage in the amount of $196,291.13 on January 3, 2011.\r\nRespondent did not pay off the loan as agreed because he did not have sufficient\r\nfunds in the second trust account.\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 2011, respondent signed a false affidavit stating that he made the\r\npayoff and that he was in possession of a canceled check payable to the lender.\r\nRespondent submitted the false affidavit to the title company.\r\n\r\nRespondent made two small payments on the prior loan between January and April\r\n2011. In April, Mr. and Mrs. A discovered that their prior mortgage was not paid\r\noff when they received a statement showing that someone had been making\r\nperiodic payments. Mr. and Mrs. A contacted the representative of the new lender\r\nwho, in turn, contacted the title company.\r\n\r\nCounsel for the title company confronted respondent on April 6, 2011, to\r\ndetermine the status of the mortgage. Respondent wired the funds to pay off the\r\nprior mortgage the same day. In order to pay off Mr. and Mrs. A's prior mortgage,\r\nrespondent used funds received in connection with an unrelated closing for his\r\nclients, Mr. and Mrs. B.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2011, respondent had closed a loan for Mr. and Mrs. B to be\r\ndisbursed on April 5. On April 5, 2011, respondent received $407,001.00 by wire\r\nto his second trust account to fund Mr. and Mrs. B's closing. Respondent did not\r\npay off Mr. and Mrs. B's prior mortgage as agreed. Instead, respondent used a\r\nportion of Mr. and Mrs. B's loan proceeds to pay off Mr. and Mrs. A's prior\r\nmortgage. On April 14, 2011, respondent used approximately $40,000 of Mr. and\r\nMrs. B's loan proceeds to make a payment to their prior mortgage holder.\r\n\r\nOn April 21, 2011, the date of respondent's interim suspension, he had\r\napproximately $65,000 in the second trust account and more than $23,000 in\r\noutstanding checks. On April 27, 2011, the title insurance company paid\r\n$365,747.58 to satisfy Mr. and Mrs. B's prior mortgage.\r\n\r\nFrom 1994 until his interim suspension in April 2011, respondent misappropriated\r\nfunds from his client trust accounts. Respondent used the funds to pay tax bills,\r\npersonal attorneys' fees, settle a malpractice claim, and for various other personal\r\nand business purposes. For many years, respondent paid his personal mortgage\r\nthrough monthly automatic debits from the second trust account in the amount of\r\n\n$1,184.00 per month. In 2009, respondent paid his personal tax debt in the amount\r\nof $11,224.50 from the second trust account.\r\n\r\nOver time, respondent made attempts to restore misappropriated funds by making\r\ndeposits into the second trust account from a personal investment account created\r\nwith a family inheritance and personal loans. He also attempted to cover the\r\nshortages that resulted from his misappropriation by leaving earned fees in the trust\r\naccount. As a result of his ongoing misuse of trust funds, respondent's efforts to\r\nrestore the account were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nRespondent now admits that the representations he made to ODC in 2009 were\r\nfalse. He also admits he did not prepare proper monthly reconciliations as required\r\nby Rule 417, SCACR. Finally, respondent admits he was able to keep ODC from\r\ndiscovering the misappropriation in 2009 by failing to disclose the existence of the\r\nsecond trust account.                   Law\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act\r\nwith reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.15\r\n(lawyer shall hold property of clients in lawyer’s possession in connection with\r\nrepresentation separate from lawyer’s own property; lawyer may deposit lawyer’s\r\nown funds in client trust account for the sole purpose of paying service charges on\r\nthat account; lawyer shall promptly deliver to client or third person any funds\r\nclient or third person is entitled to receive; lawyer shall not disburse funds from an\r\naccount containing funds of more than one client or third person unless funds to be\r\ndisbursed have been deposited in the account and are collected funds); Rule 4.1 (in\r\ncourse of representing client, lawyer shall not knowingly make false statement of\r\nmaterial fact to third person); Rule 8.1 (lawyer in connection with disciplinary\r\nmatter shall not fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension\r\nknown to have arisen in the matter); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for\r\nlawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty,\r\ntrustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(d) (it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty,\r\nfraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct\r\nfor lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent also admits he violated Rule 417, SCACR. Further, respondent admits\r\nhe has violated the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n\n413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate\r\nRules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding\r\nprofessional conduct of lawyers).    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from\r\nthe practice of law in this state, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.\r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs\r\nincurred by ODC and the Commission in the investigation and prosecution of this\r\nmatter. Within one (1) year of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay\r\nrestitution in the amount of $365,747.58, plus interest, and legal fees of $4,310.90\r\nto Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company. In addition, within one (1) year\r\nof the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay restitution to the Lawyers' Fund,\r\nreimbursing it for all claims paid on his behalf.\r\n\r\nRespondent shall file proof of payment of restitution to the Commission no later\r\nthan one (1) year from the date of this opinion. If funds currently held in\r\nrespondent's trust or operating accounts by the attorney appointed to protect the\r\ninterests of respondent's clients are used to pay any of the above-stated restitution\r\nobligations, respondent's obligations shall be reduced by the amount paid.\r\nRespondent and Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company may negotiate\r\nrepayment of a lesser amount. Should the title company confirm payment of a\r\nlesser amount in full satisfaction of respondent's debt, respondent's restitution\r\nobligation shall be deemed paid in full.\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\naffidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of\r\nRule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the\r\nPractice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27151","title":"In the Matter of Charles Thomas Brooks, III","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27151.pdf","description":"This is an opinion publicly reprimanding ia lawyer.","date":"2012-08-01","type":"opinion","text":"                   THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                        In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n            In the Matter of Charles Thomas Brooks, III,\r\n            Respondent.\r\n\r\n            Appellate Case No. 2012-212138\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Opinion No. 27151 \n\r\n                  Submitted July 2, 2012 – Filed August 1, 2012 \n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n            Lesley M.

In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of a public reprimand. Respondent agrees to make restitution to the\r\nSouth Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense (SCCID) for the excess\r\ncompensation he received by asking it to reduce the fees it currently owes to him\r\nby $61,826.40. Respondent agrees that, within thirty (30) days of imposition of a\r\nsanction, he will provide the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission)\r\nwith documentation from SCCID that the request has been made and will satisfy\r\nhis debt to SCCID. If the amount respondent is owed by SCCID is insufficient to\r\nsatisfy his debt, respondent agrees to submit a repayment plan for the balance\r\n\nowed to the Commission within thirty (30) days of the imposition of discipline.\r\nRespondent further agrees to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program\r\nEthics School within one (1) year of imposition of discipline and he agrees to pay\r\nthe costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and\r\nthe Commission within thirty (30) days of imposition of discipline. We accept the\r\nAgreement and issue a public reprimand with conditions as stated hereafter. The\r\nfacts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\r\n                                        Facts\r\n\r\nA substantial portion of respondent's practice has been devoted to representing\r\nindigents in post-conviction relief, Department of Social Services, and sexually\r\nviolent predator actions. Respondent also represents indigents in criminal cases\r\nand probation revocations.\r\n\r\nThe executive director of the SCCID filed a complaint against respondent alleging\r\nhe overbilled SCCID for his representation of indigents. For most of his appointed\r\nwork, respondent would submit vouchers at the conclusion of his representation on\r\neach case. Respondent's vouchers served as itemized billing records for each\r\nindividual case indicating time and dates for the work performed.\r\n\r\nDuring a time period covering approximately two (2) years and eight (8) months,\r\nrespondent's vouchers to the SCCID contained numerous errors. In fact, when\r\nrespondent's billing records for that period were later totaled by date rather than\r\nviewed as separate vouchers, the calculations revealed that respondent billed\r\nSCCID in excess of 24 hours per day for fourteen separate days.\r\n\r\nRespondent admits he substantially overbilled for his representation of indigent\r\nclients and acknowledges systemic problems with his billing practices. Chief\r\namong these problems was respondent's failure to maintain contemporaneous time\r\nrecords in his indigent cases. When it was time to submit a voucher, respondent\r\nand his staff often relied on his client's file to determine the amount of time he had\r\ndevoted to that particular client. Respondent submits this approach resulted in him\r\nsometimes incorrectly attributing work to the wrong dates and overestimating the\r\ntime devoted to a particular task. It also caused him to sometimes bill for the same\r\ntravel time more than once because the underlying cases were concluded at\r\ndifferent times and he did not keep track of whether he had already billed travel\r\ntime for a particular day. Additionally, respondent billed for items SCCID does\r\nnot consider compensable, namely work performed by paralegal staff and\r\nparticular travel time. Respondent further explains that some work was reported\r\n\nunder his name when it was actually performed by his wife, another attorney in his\r\nfirm. Despite these admitted problems, respondent contends he did not\r\nintentionally overbill SCCID and ODC does not have any evidence to the contrary.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of contemporaneous time records, an exact figure for excess billing\r\nand excess payments received cannot be established. However, after reviewing the\r\nrecords in detail with the assistance of his counsel and a forensic accountant,\r\nrespondent calculates he received $61,826.40 in excess compensation from\r\nSCCID.\r\n\r\nRespondent has continued to represent indigent clients and submit vouchers for his\r\nwork but, pursuant to his requests, SCCID has not paid him for his services since\r\nODC began its investigation. Because of the additional vouchers submitted during\r\nthe investigation, respondent represents that SCCID owes him more on approved,\r\nunpaid vouchers than he received in excess compensation.\r\n\r\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.5(a) (lawyer shall\r\nnot charge or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses)\r\nand Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that\r\nis prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of\r\nthis jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers).\r\n\r\n                                    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand. Accordingly, we\r\naccept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n\r\nRespondent shall make restitution to SCCID for the excess compensation he\r\nreceived by asking it to reduce the fees it currently owes to him by $61,826.40 and\r\nentering into a repayment plan if the amount owed to him is insufficient to satisfy\r\nhis debt to SCCID. Within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent\r\nshall provide the Commission with documentation from SCCID that his request\r\nhas been made and that it will satisfy his debt to SCCID. If the amount respondent\r\n\nis owed by SCCID is insufficient to satisfy his debt, respondent shall submit a\r\nrepayment plan for the balance owed to SCCID to the Commission within thirty\r\n(30) days of the date of this opinion.\r\n\r\nRespondent shall complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School\r\nwithin one (1) year of the date of this opinion and provide the Commission with\r\nproof of completion no later than ten (10) days after the conclusion of the program.\r\nFinally, respondent shall pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution\r\nof this matter by ODC and the Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of\r\nthis opinion.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27152","title":"In the Matter of Robert E.

In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of any sanction in Rule 7(b), RLDE. Respondent requests that any\r\nsuspension or disbarment be imposed retroactively to January 10, 2006, the date of\r\nhis interim suspension. In the Matter of Hemingway, 367 S.C. 278, 625 S.E.2d 641\r\n(2006). Respondent further agrees to enter into a restitution agreement with the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) within thirty (30) days of the\r\nimposition of discipline to reimburse those harmed as a result of his misconduct.\r\nWe accept the Agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law and order\r\nthat he enter into a restitution agreement as stated hereafter. The facts, as set forth\r\nin the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                        Facts\r\n\r\n                                      Matter I\r\n\r\nAround January 2002, respondent was retained to represent clients who had been\r\ninjured in an automobile accident. The clients received medical care from\r\nComplainant A, a chiropractic clinic. Respondent had notice of and agreed to\r\nprotect Complainant A's lien.\r\n\r\nComplainant A began contacting respondent around January 2004 to obtain\r\npayments for services rendered. Complainant A and respondent exchanged several\r\nmessages over the next several months during which respondent promised to send\r\npayment to Complainant A. Respondent did not pay the full amount of the invoice\r\nuntil on or about November 15, 2004.\r\n\r\nDuring the investigation of this matter respondent admitted he had not been\r\nperforming monthly reconciliations of his trust accounts as required by Rule 417,\r\nSCACR.                                Matter II\r\n\r\nRespondent represented a client who had been injured in an automobile accident.\r\nRespondent's client was paid insurance benefits by National Union Fire Insurance\r\nCompanies of Pittsburgh. Complainant B acted as a third party administrator of\r\nthe company's claims. Respondent was aware Complainant B was entitled to\r\nreimbursement for any benefits paid to his client if a third party was held liable for\r\nthe accident.\r\n\r\nOn two separate occasions, Complainant B notified respondent in writing that it\r\nexpected to be reimbursed $2,648.60 for benefits paid to respondent's client.\r\nRespondent disbursed all settlement monies to his client without protecting the\r\nfinancial interests of Complainant B.Matter III\r\n\r\nRespondent's mother passed away in June 2001. Respondent was appointed\r\nPersonal Representative of the Estate on July 20, 2001. Respondent admits he did\r\nnot properly disburse the Estate funds and did not ensure the Estate was closed in a\r\ntimely manner.\r\n\nComplainant C, a probate court judge, was assigned to hear the matter dealing with\r\nthe Estate of Respondent's Mother. On June 21, 2005, on a Rule to Show Cause\r\nfor dereliction of duties, Complainant C ordered respondent to file the Estate's\r\nclosing documents within thirty (30) days. On October 10, 2005, on a Summons to\r\nShow Cause for dereliction of duties, Complainant C held respondent in contempt\r\nof court, imposed a fine of $250.00, and ordered respondent to fulfill all of his\r\nduties as Personal Representative of the Estate and to file any and all documents\r\nnecessary to close the Estate within thirty (30) days. On February 13, 2006, on a\r\ndemand for a hearing on the closing of the Estate, Complainant C ordered\r\nrespondent to provide the Court and the heirs with written verification of the date\r\nof death balances of the decedent's accounts, to provide the Court with written\r\nverification by cancelled check or release/satisfaction of the payment and amount\r\nof payment of the creditor claims, to recover from appropriate third parties certain\r\nexpenses paid by the Estate on behalf of the third parties, and to file an amended\r\nInventory and Appraisement and amended Final Accounting of the Estate.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 2006, respondent had not complied with the Court's June 21, 2005,\r\nOctober 10, 2005, and February 13, 2006, orders and, therefore, Complainant C\r\nissued a Summons to Show Cause for respondent's dereliction of duties. At the\r\nhearing on July 31, 2006, respondent's attorney offered respondent's resignation as\r\nfiduciary based upon medical reasons and requested an additional thirty (30) days\r\nin which to obtain and provide the Court and the heirs with the items ordered\r\nduring the February 13, 2006, hearing.\r\n\r\nOn August 2, 2006, Complainant C found respondent to be in contempt of court\r\nfor failing to timely conclude the Estate and failure to comply with the Court's\r\nprevious orders. The Court gave respondent ten (10) days to file the previously\r\nordered documents. In addition, Complainant C removed respondent as Personal\r\nRepresentative of the Estate for cause. The Court appointed two of respondent's\r\nsiblings as Co-Personal Representatives.\r\n\r\nOn September 25, 2006, Complainant C issued a Bench Warrant for Incarceration\r\nfor respondent for his failure to provide the court-ordered documents dealing with\r\nthe Estate. The warrant required that respondent be imprisoned for thirty (30) days\r\nor until he provided the requested Estate documents. Respondent provided the\r\nCourt with all requested documents and the Estate was closed.\r\n\n                                     Matter IV\r\n\r\nComplainant D retained respondent to represent her in relation to injuries she\r\nsuffered in two automobile accidents. Respondent received $71,337.59 to settle\r\nComplainant D's cases.\r\n\r\nRespondent admits he never disbursed the monies to Complainant D and cannot\r\naccount for the monies owed to Complainant D. Respondent acknowledges that he\r\nfailed to notify Complainant D after he was placed on interim suspension. In\r\naddition, he misplaced Complainant D's file and was unable to provide the file to\r\nthe attorney appointed to protect his clients' interests.\r\n\r\nComplainant D filed a claim with the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection (the\r\nLawyers' Fund). On December 19, 2008, the Lawyers' Fund paid Complainant D\r\n$40,000.00, the maximum amount allowed. See Rule 411, SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter V\r\n\r\nOn January 10, 2006, the Court placed respondent on interim suspension. In the\r\nMatter of Hemingway, id. On or about June 22, 2006, respondent accepted\r\n$1,500.00 from Complainant E as a retainer fee for a case he wished respondent to\r\nhandle. Complainant E filed a claim with the Lawyers' Fund and was awarded\r\n$1,500.00.                               Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall\r\nprovide competent representation to client); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly\r\ndeliver to client or third person any funds or other property client or third person is\r\nentitled to receive); Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in\r\nviolation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction); Rule 8.4(d)\r\n(it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving\r\ndishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration\r\nof justice). Respondent further admits he violated Rule 417, SCACR. Respondent\r\nalso admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for\r\na lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this\r\n\njurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\nadministration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute\r\nor conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to willfully violate a valid court order issued by a\r\ncourt of this state).                Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from\r\nthe practice of law in this state, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.\r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall enter into a\r\nrestitution agreement with the Commission agreeing to reimburse those harmed by\r\nhis conduct as follows: 1) $2,648.60 to Complainant B; 2) $31,337.59 to\r\nComplainant D; and 3) $55,400.00 to the Lawyers' Fund.

The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal as interlocutory in\r\nBone v. U.S. Food Service, S.C. Ct. App. Order dated June 30, 2010. This\r\nCourt has granted the petition of the employer and its carrier for a writ of\r\ncertiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                                   I. FACTS\r\n\r\n      Cathy C. Bone filed a workers' compensation claim form (Form 50)\r\ndated August 7, 2007 alleging that she injured her back on Tuesday, June 26,\r\n2007 while employed with U.S. Food Service. Her job consisted of power\r\nwashing and cleaning the insides of truck trailers that transported food. Bone\r\nalleged that she hurt her back when she lifted two pallets inside a trailer to\r\nclean under them.\r\n\r\n        According to Bone she did not report the incident immediately because\r\nshe needed to continue working and thought she would be okay, but\r\nthereafter she developed increasing pain. On Tuesday, July 3, 2007, Bone\r\nreported the injury to one of her supervisors, Richard Thompson, shortly after\r\nshe arrived at work. The same morning she reported her injury, Bone had a\r\nflat tire on her way to work, and she called in to advise her office of this fact.\r\n\r\n      The employer, U.S. Food Service, and its carrier, Indemnity Insurance\r\nCo. of North America (collectively, \"Employer\"), denied Bone's claim,\r\ndisputing that she had injured her back on June 26 and asserting the injury\r\noccurred when her tire was changed on July 3.\r\n\r\n      At the hearing in this matter, Bone testified that she did not physically\r\nchange the tire herself. Rather, a gentleman who was in the parking lot of a\r\nnearby business where she had pulled off the road had changed the tire for\r\nher. However, Bone's supervisor, Thompson, noted Bone was crying when\r\nshe reported her injury. In addition, he recalled that she had told him that\r\n\n\"she had to change her tire on her truck,\" which he interpreted to mean that\r\nshe had personally changed the tire. Bone disagreed with this interpretation\r\nas well as with the exact wording of her statement. The supervisor did not\r\ndispute the fact that Bone had told him that her back injury occurred on June\r\n26 when she lifted the pallets at work.\r\n\r\n      The hearing commissioner found Bone had failed to meet her burden of\r\nshowing that she had sustained an injury by accident arising out of and in the\r\ncourse of her employment. An Appellate Panel of the Commission upheld\r\nthe hearing commissioner's findings and conclusions in full.\r\n\r\n       Bone appealed to the circuit court, which concluded Bone had\r\nsustained a compensable injury, and it reversed and remanded the matter to\r\nthe Commission for further proceedings consistent with this determination.\r\nIn its order, the circuit court observed the Commission had denied the claim\r\nafter \"ostensibly finding [Bone] injured her back while changing her tire on\r\nJuly 3.\" However, the circuit court found Bone gave consistent statements to\r\nEmployer and her physicians that her injury occurred on June 26, and further\r\nfound there was \"no evidence in the record, let alone substantial evidence,\r\nthat [Bone] injured her back while changing a tire on the way to work on July\r\n3, 2007.\" The circuit court rejected Employer's contention that the\r\nsupervisor's testimony and the hearing commissioner's finding regarding\r\ncredibility supported the decision below, stating credibility \"goes only to the\r\nweight afforded [Bone's] testimony and in no way establishes [that her]\r\ninjury occurred on July 3.\"\r\n\r\n      The Court of Appeals dismissed Employer's appeal of the circuit court's\r\norder on the basis it was interlocutory and did not dispose of the entirety of\r\nthe case with finality. It held a general appealability statute allowing appeals\r\nfrom interlocutory orders was not applicable in matters before the\r\nCommission. Bone v. U.S. Food Service, S.C. Ct. App. Order dated June 30,\r\n2010. In making this determination, the Court of Appeals relied primarily\r\nupon the following precedent: Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority v.\r\nSouth Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, 387 S.C.\r\n265, 692 S.E.2d 894 (2010) (holding the Administrative Procedures Act is\r\ncontrolling in agency matters and S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-330, a general\r\nappealability statute, is not applicable to agency appeals); Montjoy v. Asten-\r\n\nHill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 446 S.E.2d 618 (1994) (stating a circuit\r\ncourt order remanding a case for additional proceedings before an\r\nadministrative agency is not immediately appealable); and Good v. Hartford\r\nAccident and Indemnity Co., 201 S.C. 32, 21 S.E.2d 209 (1942) (noting an\r\norder that determines issues of law while leaving open questions of fact is not\r\na final order).             II. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      Employer contends the decision of the Court of Appeals should be\r\nreversed and the appeal reinstated because the circuit court's order was\r\nimmediately appealable. Employer asserts the decision of the Court of\r\nAppeals is based upon a misapplication of precedent. Because of lingering\r\nconfusion in this area that has arisen after the passage of the Administrative\r\nProcedures Act (APA), we shall review this precedent to provide clarification\r\nand a unified approach to appeals involving administrative agencies.\r\n\r\n      As an initial point of reference, we note our long-standing rule that the\r\nAPA governs the review of administrative agency matters and is controlling\r\nover any provisions that conflict with its terms. See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276\r\nS.C. 130, 132, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981) (holding the APA's standard of\r\nreview was controlling over conflicting provisions in the workers'\r\ncompensation act because the APA \"purports to provide uniform procedures\r\nbefore State Boards and Commissions and for judicial review after the\r\nexhaustion of administrative remedies\"). With this fundamental principle in\r\nmind, we turn now to an examination of the decisions cited by the Court of\r\nAppeals.\r\n\r\n      A. Montjoy and the Final Judgment Rule of Section 1-23-390\r\n\r\n      Montjoy v. Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 446 S.E.2d 618\r\n(1994) involved an appeal from an order of the circuit court remanding the\r\ncase to the Commission. We granted the respondent's motion to dismiss the\r\nappeal on the basis the circuit court's order was interlocutory and not directly\r\nappealable. Id. at 52, 446 S.E.2d at 618.\r\n\n      In doing so, we relied upon the final judgment rule articulated in\r\nsection 1-23-390 of the APA and observed that \"we have consistently held\r\nthat an order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional proceedings\r\nbefore an administrative agency is not directly appealable.\"1 Id. Although\r\nMontjoy involved a Commission case, its holding applies to all administrative\r\nagencies subject to the APA.\r\n\r\n      Section 1-23-390 was thereafter amended,2 but it still requires an\r\nappeal from a \"final judgment\" of the circuit court and currently provides:\r\n\"An aggrieved party may obtain a review of a final judgment of the circuit\r\ncourt or the court of appeals pursuant to this article by taking an appeal in the\r\nmanner provided by the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules as in other\r\ncivil cases.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-390 (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added).\r\nThe phrase, \"in the manner provided by the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules as in other civil cases\" simply refers to following the same procedures\r\nfor briefing schedules, preparation of records, etc., as in other civil cases and\r\nthese rules do not supersede the APA provisions.\r\n\r\n       B. \tCharlotte-Mecklenburg: APA Controls Over the General\r\n                 Appealability Statute of Section 14-3-330\r\n\r\n     Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority v. South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Health and Environmental Control, 387 S.C. 265, 692 S.E.2d\r\n894 (2010) concerned the dismissal of an appeal from an order of the\r\n\r\n1 Section 1-23-390 then provided: \"An aggrieved party may obtain a review\r\nof any final judgment of the circuit court under this article by appeal to the\r\nSupreme Court. The appeal shall be taken as in other civil cases.\" Id.\r\n(quoting S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-390 (1986)) (emphasis added).\r\n2  The 2006 amendment was necessitated by legislative changes that now\r\ndirect agency appeals to the Court of Appeals rather than to the circuit court.\r\nThe change specifically to Commission cases was effective on July 1, 2007.\r\nPee Dee Reg'l Transp. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 375 S.C. 60, 61-62, 650\r\nS.E.2d 464, 465 (2007) (stating section 42-17-60 previously directed appeals\r\nfrom the Commission to the circuit court, but they now are to the Court of\r\nAppeals for injuries occurring on or after July 1, 2007).\r\n\nAdministrative Law Court (ALC) on the basis it was not immediately\r\nappealable under the APA. We observed that \"[t]he right of appeal arises\r\nfrom and is controlled by statutory law.\" Id. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894. We\r\nnoted that S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-330(1) (1976)3 is a general appealability\r\nstatute that permits immediate appeal from an interlocutory order \"involving\r\nthe merits\"; however, where a specialized statute regarding appeals is\r\napplicable, section 14-3-330 does not govern the right to review. Id.\r\n\r\n      We observed that S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-610(A)(1) (Supp. 2009) of\r\nthe APA allows judicial review only from \"final decisions\" of the ALC. Id.\r\n\"Therefore, although § 14-3-330 permits appeals from interlocutory orders\r\nwhich involve the merits, that section is inapplicable in cases where a party\r\nseeks review of a decision of the ALC because the more specific statute, § 1-\r\n23-610, limits review to final decisions of the ALC.\" Id. We overruled two\r\ncases \"[t]o the extent . . . [that they] rely on § 14-3-330 to permit the appeal\r\nof interlocutory orders of the ALC or an administrative agency . . . .\" Id.\r\n(emphasis added).4\r\n\r\n       We considered the meaning of a \"final decision\" and stated, \"If there is\r\nsome further act which must be done by the court prior to a determination of\r\nthe rights of the parties, the order is interlocutory.\" Id. at 267, 692 S.E.2d at\r\n894. \"A judgment which determines the applicable law, but leaves open\r\n\r\n3 Section 14-3-330(1) permits review of \"[a]ny intermediate judgment, order\r\nor decree in a law case involving the merits in actions commenced in the\r\ncourt of common pleas and general sessions, brought there by original\r\nprocess or removed there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final\r\njudgments in such actions[.]\" (Emphasis added.)\r\n4 The following cases were overruled: Canteen v. McLeod Regional Center,\r\n384 S.C. 617, 682 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2009) (a workers' compensation\r\ncase) and Oakwood Landfill, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Health\r\nand Environmental Control, 381 S.C. 120, 671 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n(an ALC matter). Thus, it is clear from the example of the overruled cases\r\nand the reference to \"interlocutory orders of the ALC or an administrative\r\nagency\" that the analysis in Charlotte-Mecklenburg applies broadly to\r\nadministrative agency matters and it is not limited just to orders of the ALC.\r\n\nquestions of fact, is not a final judgment.\" Id. Rather, \"[a] final judgment\r\ndisposes of the whole subject matter of the action or terminates the particular\r\nproceeding or action, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce by execution\r\nwhat has been determined.\" Id. at 267, 692 S.E.2d at 895 (citing Good v.\r\nHartford Accident & Indem. Co., 201 S.C. 32, 21 S.E.2d 209 (1942)).\r\n\r\n       We concluded that, although the ALC decided questions of law in this\r\nmatter, it also remanded some issues, so a final determination had yet to be\r\nmade. Id. Consequently, we held the order of the ALC was interlocutory and\r\nnot a final decision that was immediately appealable. Id.\r\n\r\n            C. Application of Precedent to Employer's Appeal\r\n\r\n       Employer attempts to distinguish Montjoy and Charlotte-Mecklenburg\r\nand argues the Court of Appeals applied an \"overly broad\" interpretation of\r\nthe latter. Although Montjoy holds that a circuit court order remanding a case\r\nto an agency for further proceedings is not a final order under section 1-23-\r\n390, Employer argues the nature of the remand was not revealed in the\r\nMontjoy opinion, so Montjoy should not preclude an immediate appeal here.\r\n\r\n      Employer acknowledges that section 1-23-390 of the APA limits\r\nappellate review to final orders. However, Employer contends a final order\r\nunder section 1-23-390 is one that \"affects the merits,\" citing, among other\r\ncases, Owens v. Canal Wood Corp., 281 S.C. 491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984) and\r\nHunt v. Whitt, 279 S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621 (1983). Employer maintains the\r\ncurrent order is appealable because the circuit court decided a portion of the\r\ncase, compensability, with finality, citing Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc.,\r\n366 S.C. 379, 387, 622 S.E.2d 546, 551 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"An order involves\r\nthe merits if it finally determines some substantial matter forming the whole\r\nor part of some cause of action or defense in the case.\" (citation omitted)),\r\nimplied overruling recognized by Long v. Sealed Air Corp., 391 S.C. 483,\r\n706 S.E.2d 34 (Ct. App. 2011).\r\n\r\n      In Long v. Sealed Air Corp., the Court of Appeals, noting this Court's\r\nrecent holding in Charlotte-Mecklenburg that section 14-3-330 does not\r\napply where a specific statute of the APA controls, concluded Brown had\r\nbeen implicitly overruled to the extent that it defined a final order in terms of\r\n\nwhether it \"involved the merits\" because, even though Brown did not cite to\r\nor specifically rely upon section 14-3-330, it applied an \"involving the\r\nmerits\" analysis, which is relevant only under section 14-3-330. Long, 391\r\nS.C. at 487 & n.4, 706 S.E.2d at 36 & n.4. Employer argues Long was\r\n\"wrongly decided\" under existing precedent and should be overturned.\r\n\r\n       Today we reiterate that appeals in administrative agency matters are\r\nhandled differently than appeals in other cases. The South Carolina General\r\nAssembly enacted the APA's mechanisms for review to provide uniform\r\nprocedures after the exhaustion of administrative remedies; the APA's\r\nprovisions are controlling in these agency matters and supersede any\r\nconflicting provisions. Lark, 276 S.C. at 132, 276 S.E.2d at 305. Thus, while\r\nappeals from the circuit court in other cases are subject to the general\r\nappealability statute of section 14-3-330, which allows appeals from\r\ninterlocutory orders in certain instances (such as where the interlocutory\r\norder involves the merits), this provision and its concepts are inapplicable in\r\nmatters subject to the APA. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth., 387 S.C. at\r\n266, 692 S.E.2d at 894.\r\n\r\n      In this case, the APA contains a specific statute, section 1-23-390,\r\nwhich governs appeals from the circuit court, and this statute limits appeals to\r\nthose from \"final judgments.\" Final judgments are not defined by the\r\nterminology in section 14-3-330 to include interlocutory orders that \"involve\r\nthe merits.\" The concept of \"involving the merits\" is part of the analysis in\r\ndetermining whether an interlocutory order may be appealed under section\r\n14-3-330, so it has no bearing here.\r\n\r\n      As noted by Bone, there are many cases arising after the enactment of\r\nthe APA that have applied this standard of \"involving the merits,\" even\r\nthough they do not specifically reference section 14-3-330. In many\r\ninstances, these cases reached the correct result, but the \"involves the merits\"\r\nanalysis did not survive the enactment of the APA.5 This has left some\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Some of these cases are based on reasoning from opinions decided before\r\nthe enactment of the APA. See, e.g., Chastain v. Spartan Mills, 228 S.C. 61,\r\n65, 88 S.E.2d 836, 837 (1955) (holding the Commission's order reversing an\r\n\nlingering confusion in our case law. To clarify, post-APA decisions applying\r\nthis analysis are overruled to the extent that they either rely upon section 14-\r\n3-330 explicitly or rely upon any of its concepts in defining what constitutes\r\na \"final judgment.\"\r\n\r\n      A \"final judgment\" is defined in this context as was stated in Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg, i.e., the order must dispose of the whole subject matter of the\r\naction or terminate the action, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce what\r\nhas already been determined. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth., 387 S.C.\r\nat 267, 692 S.E.2d at 895. Although Employer argues one issue\r\n(compensability) has been decided here and, thus, the order is immediately\r\nappealable, this essentially applies an \"involves the merits\" analysis that we\r\nhave already rejected in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. See id. at 267, 692 S.E.2d\r\nat 894 (stating a judgment deciding issues of law, but leaving open questions\r\nof fact is not a final judgment). As Bone asserts, the order does not dispose\r\nof the entire action, because a ruling as to compensability, with nothing more\r\n(such as the claimant's specific benefits and medical status), is not\r\nenforceable as it stands. Further, a circuit court order remanding a matter to\r\nan agency is not a final judgment and it is not immediately appealable.\r\nMontjoy, 316 S.C. at 52, 446 S.E.2d at 618. The ruling in Montjoy did not\r\nelaborate on the purpose of the remand to the Commission because the\r\nholding was not dependent on the nature of the remand.\r\n\r\n       The procedure urged by Employer, which would postpone a remand to\r\nthe agency for a final decision and instead allow an appeal from an\r\ninterlocutory order and then a second appeal after the final agency decision,\r\nwould result in piecemeal appeals in agency cases that would adversely affect\r\njudicial economy and compromise informed appellate review. The APA's\r\nrequirement of review of a final decision, and its statutory mandate for the\r\nexhaustion of administrative remedies serves (1) to protect the administrative\r\nagency's authority and (2) to promote efficiency, and we agree with the Court\r\nof Appeals that the order of remand in the current matter is not immediately\r\nappealable. Cf. Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 89 (2006) (stating the\r\nexhaustion of administrative remedies serves to protect administrative\r\n\r\naward and remanding the case to the single hearing commissioner to take\r\nfurther testimony was not final because it did not \"affect the merits\").\r\n\nagencies and promote efficiency and \"may produce a useful record for\r\nsubsequent judicial consideration\" (citation omitted)); Elam v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nTransp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779 (2004) (noting, in another\r\ncontext, the need for \"further[ing] the goals of avoiding piecemeal appeals\r\nand fostering informed appellate review\"); Good, 201 S.C. at 42, 21 S.E.2d at\r\n213 (\"The rule in restriction of piecemeal appellate procedure, dating back to\r\nthe common law, is based upon sound reason and practical utility. If it were\r\notherwise, endless delays would be encountered—delays which are\r\nunnecessary in cases . . . which can be decided upon an appeal from [] final\r\njudgment . . . .\").\r\n\r\n      To the extent Employer argues this result is untenable because the law\r\nof the case doctrine would preclude later review of the matter of\r\ncompensability, this assertion is without merit. The law of the case doctrine\r\napplies where a party does not challenge an issue on appeal when there has\r\nbeen an opportunity to do so. Where the party is not yet able to appeal due to\r\nthe lack of a final judgment, the issue is not precluded by the law of the case\r\ndoctrine as there was no prior opportunity for appeal.6\r\n\r\n                             III. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      In agency appeals, the APA is controlling over general provisions that\r\nconflict with its terms. In this case, there is a specific statute in the APA that\r\ngoverns appeals from the circuit court in Commission cases, section 1-23-\r\n390, and it limits appeals to those from final judgments. Therefore, section\r\n14-3-330, a general appealability statute allowing interlocutory appeals in\r\ncertain instances, and its concepts are not applicable here. The definition of a\r\n\"final judgment\" used in Charlotte-Mecklenburg should be the point of\r\nreference in any analysis of that term when applying section 1-23-390.\r\nConsequently, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, which found\r\nthe current order remanding the matter to the Commission for further\r\n\r\n6  See generally Sloan Constr. Co. v. Southco Grassing, Inc., 395 S.C. 164,\r\n169, 717 S.E.2d 603, 606 (2011) (\"Under the law of the case doctrine, 'a\r\nparty is precluded from relitigating, after an appeal, matters that were either\r\nnot raised on appeal, but should have been or raised on appeal, but expressly\r\nrejected by the appellate court.'\" (citation omitted)).\r\n                                  \r\n\nproceedings, does not constitute a final judgment as required by section 1-23-\r\n390 and is not immediately appealable.\r\n\r\n     AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      TOAL, C.J. and PLEICONES, J., concur. HEARN, J., dissenting\r\nin a separate opinion in which KITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\n      JUSTICE HEARN: Respectfully, I dissent. In my opinion, this case\r\ninvolves nothing more than a straight-forward application of Section 1-23-\r\n390 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011), which permits an appeal from\r\na final decision involving the merits of a substantial issue in a case. Under\r\nthis rubric, the court of appeals erred in dismissing U.S. Food Service's\r\nappeal.    In reaching the opposite result and broadening Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg Hospital Authority v. South Carolina Department of Health &\r\nEnvironmental Control, 387 S.C. 265, 692 S.E.2d 894 (2010), beyond its\r\noriginal context, the majority overrules years of settled case law. Because\r\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg is inapposite and does not alter the analysis under\r\nsection 1-23-390, I would reverse.\r\n\r\n      To begin, I agree with the majority that the Administrative Procedures\r\nAct (APA) governs the standards of appealability in administrative cases,\r\nwhich means our general rules do not apply. As explained more thoroughly\r\nbelow, the APA provides appealablilty standards for two different stages of\r\nthese proceedings: appeal from the administrative body to the judiciary,7 and\r\nfurther appellate review within the courts. This case involves only the latter,\r\nwhich is controlled by section 1-23-390. This statute provides: \"An\r\naggrieved party may obtain a review of a final judgment of the circuit court\r\nor court of appeals pursuant to this article by taking an appeal in the manner\r\nprovided by the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules as in other civil\r\ncases.\" At the heart of this case is what the words \"final judgment\" in section\r\n1-23-390 mean.\r\n\r\n      The first time we expressly interpreted this statute was in Montjoy v.\r\nAsten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 446 S.E.2d 618 (1994). At the time\r\nthat case was decided, section 1-23-390 read: \"An aggrieved party may\r\nobtain a review of any final judgment of the circuit court under this article by\r\nappeal to the Supreme Court. The appeal shall be taken as in other civil\r\ncases.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-390 (1986). Under this standard, which is\r\nsimilar to the present version of section 1-23-290, \"we have consistently held\r\n\r\n7 Appeals from agency decisions used to be to the circuit court. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 1-23-380(1) (2005). Thus, the circuit court would sit in an appellate\r\ncapacity. The statute has since been amended, and now appeals are brought\r\ndirectly to the court of appeals. S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380(1) (Supp. 2011).\r\n\nthat an order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional proceedings\r\nbefore an administrative agency is not directly appealable.\" Montjoy, 316\r\nS.C. at 52, 446 S.E.2d at 618 (1994). However, there is more to this than\r\nmeets the eye. Because we provided no information regarding the scope of\r\nthe remand in question, it is necessary to turn to the two workers'\r\ncompensation cases relied upon to flesh out what we actually held: Hunt v.\r\nWhitt, 279 S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621 (1983), and Owens v. Canal Wood\r\nCorp., 281 S.C. 491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984).8\r\n\r\n       In Hunt, the circuit court remanded a decision of the full commission so\r\nit could take additional testimony from the employee. 279 S.C. at 343, 306\r\nS.E.2d at 622. We held: \"Because the interlocutory order of the circuit court\r\ndoes not involve the merits of the action, it is not reviewable by this Court for\r\nlack of finality.\" Id. (emphasis added). Similarly, in Owens, the circuit court\r\nremanded for the taking of additional testimony, so the order did \"not involve\r\nthe merits of the action. It [was] therefore interlocutory and not reviewable\r\nby this Court for lack of finality.\" 281 S.C. at 491-92, 316 S.E.2d at 385\r\n(emphasis added). Thus, in interpreting the scope of the final judgment rule\r\nunder section 1-23-390, Montjoy implicitly reaffirmed the principle that a\r\nfinal order involving the merits of an action is immediately appealable.\r\n\r\n       In the years since Montjoy, the court of appeals has had many\r\nopportunities to evaluate appealability under section 1-23-390. In particular,\r\nthe court of appeals examined this issue at length in Brown v. Greenwood\r\nMills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 622 S.E.2d 546 (Ct. App. 2005). There, Brown, a\r\nworker in a cotton mill, developed breathing problems after years of service.\r\nId. at 383, 622 S.E.2d at 549. Although he also smoked cigarettes for forty-\r\nfive years, he claimed the respiratory troubles he developed were from his\r\nwork in the mill. Id. at 382, 622 S.E.2d at 548. Despite the evidence to the\r\ncontrary, the single commissioner concluded Brown's \"respiratory disease\r\narose out of and in the course of his employment; said disease was due to\r\nhazards of the employment which are excess of hazards normally incident to\r\nnormal employees.\" Id. at 384, 622 S.E.2d at 550. The full commission\r\n\r\n8 Section 1-23-390 was passed into law in 1977. See 1977 Act No. 176, Art.\r\nII, § 9. Accordingly, even though they do not cite this statute, Hunt and\r\nOwens were governed by it.\r\n\naffirmed. Id. at 385, 622 S.E.2d at 550. The circuit court, however, held\r\nBrown's smoking was a contributing cause of his illness, and therefore the\r\nmill was entitled to a reduction in the compensation it owed. Id. at 386, 622\r\nS.E.2d at 550. Accordingly, the circuit court remanded for a determination of\r\nthe extent of this reduction. Id.\r\n\r\n      Brown appealed, and the mill argued the order remanding to the\r\ncommission was not immediately appealable. Id. at 386, 622 S.E.2d at 550-\r\n51. The court of appeals, citing section 1-23-390, Montjoy, Owens, and\r\nHunt, held that \"in determining whether the court's order constitutes a final\r\njudgment, we must inquire whether the order finally decides an issue on the\r\nmerits.\" Id. at 387, 622 S.E.2d at 551. As the court went on to note, \"'An\r\norder involves the merits if it finally determines some substantial matter\r\nforming the whole or part of some cause of action or defense in the case.'\" Id.\r\n(quoting Green v. City of Columbia, 311 S.C. 78, 80, 427 S.E.2d 685, 687\r\n(Ct. App. 1993)). Because the circuit court finally determined that Brown's\r\nsmoking contributed to his injuries, it was a final judgment under section 1-\r\n23-390 and therefore was appealable. Id. at 388, 622 S.E.2d at 551. The fact\r\nthe circuit court had also remanded the proceedings was of no moment\r\nbecause \"the panel would have no choice but to allocate some part of Brown's\r\ndisability to the non-compensable cause.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals reached the same result in Mungo v. Rental\r\nUniform Service of Florence, Inc., 383 S.C. 270, 678 S.E.2d 825 (Ct. App.\r\n2009). In that case, the claimant, Mungo, alleged a change in condition that\r\nwould entitle her to more benefits than she originally was awarded for her\r\ninjuries. See id. at 276, 678 S.E.2d at 828. The single commissioner denied\r\nher request because the report which she used to show a change in condition\r\nwas completed prior to the original hearing. Id. The full commission\r\naffirmed, and Mungo appealed to the circuit court. Id. The court reversed,\r\nholding the report could be considered and Mungo had demonstrated a\r\nchange in condition. Id. at 276-77, 678 S.E.2d at 828. Accordingly, the court\r\nremanded for the commission \"to determine the precise benefits owed to\r\n[Mungo] for her change in condition and for her psychological condition.\" Id.\r\nat 277, 678 S.E.2d at 828-29.\r\n\n      The employer sought review before the court of appeals, and the\r\nthreshold question was whether the circuit court's order was appealable. Id. at\r\n277, 678 S.E.2d at 829. Relying in part on Brown, the court found that it\r\nwas:  The circuit court's order mandates an award for change of\r\n      condition . . . . This ruling is a decision on the merits because it\r\n      decides with finality whether [Mungo] proved these changes in\r\n      her condition. Although the circuit court remanded the issue of\r\n      the precise damages to be awarded to [Mungo], the single\r\n      commissioner would have no choice but to award some damages\r\n      to [her]. Accordingly, the circuit court's order constitutes a final\r\n      decision and is appealable.\r\n\r\nId. at 278, 678 S.E.2d at 829.\r\n\r\n      The court of appeals also has used this same framework to determine\r\nwhen an order of the circuit court is not appealable. For example, in Foggie\r\nv. General Electric Corp., 376 S.C. 384, 656 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 2008), the\r\ncircuit court held the full commission's finding of permanent total disability\r\nrested, at least in part, on evidence which should have been excluded. Id. at\r\n387, 656 S.E.2d at 397. The court also found the commission did not make\r\nany findings regarding a potential credit to the employer for previous\r\npsychological injuries the employee sustained. Id. at 387-88, 656 S.E.2d at\r\n397. Consequently, the court remanded with instructions for the commission\r\nto review the record without the excluded evidence and determine whether\r\nthe employee was still permanently and totally disabled, and to make findings\r\nregarding the employer's entitlement to the credit. Id.\r\n\r\n      The employee appealed, and the court of appeals held the circuit court\r\nhad not made a final determination of whether the employee was totally and\r\npermanently disabled or whether the employer could receive any credit. Id. at\r\n389, 656 S.E.2d at 398. Accordingly, the circuit court's order was not\r\nimmediately appealable. Id.; see also McCrea v. City of Georgetown, 384\r\nS.C. 328, 333, 681 S.E.2d 918, 921 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"The circuit court's\r\norder was not a final judgment and did not involve the merits of the case.\r\nThe circuit court remanded the case to the Commission so that additional\r\n\nevidence could be entered into the record without determining whether\r\nClaimant was disabled or whether Employer was entitled to stop payments.\r\nAs such, this appeal is interlocutory.\").\r\n\r\n      Thus, the test heretofore consistently applied in this State to determine\r\nwhether an appellate decision is eligible for further review under section 1-\r\n23-390 is whether the order finally determines an issue affecting a substantial\r\nright on the merits. It does not appear the majority believes these cases were\r\nwrongly decided based on the law as it existed at the time. Instead, the\r\nmajority holds that Charlotte-Mecklenburg rejected the concept of an\r\n\"involving the merits\" analysis under the APA and therefore implicitly\r\noverruled this line of cases. In my opinion, however, Charlotte-Mecklenburg\r\ndid no such thing and has no impact on this case.\r\n\r\n       In Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the Administrative Law Court (ALC)\r\npartially granted summary judgment and remanded for the Department of\r\nHealth and Environmental Control to decide whether any party was entitled\r\nto a certificate of need.9 387 S.C. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894. One of the\r\nparties appealed the ALC's order, and we dismissed the appeal as\r\ninterlocutory. Id. The controlling statute in Charlotte-Mecklenburg was not\r\nsection 1-23-390. Instead, it was Section 1-23-610 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (Supp. 2011), which provides \"for judicial review of a final decision of\r\nan administrative law judge.\"10 (emphasis added). We defined a final\r\ndecision in this context as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n9 In order to obtain permission to construct certain healthcare facilities, the\r\nfacility may need to demonstrate the need for it. See S.C. Code Ann. § 44-7-\r\n110, et seq. (2002 & Supp. 2011).\r\n10  The statute governing appeals from the Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission is Section 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011), a\r\nsister statute of section 1-23-610, which similarly provides that \"[a] party\r\nwho has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency\r\nand who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to\r\njudicial review.\" I agree with the majority that Charlotte-Mecklenburg's\r\ninterpretation of section 1-23-610 applies equally to section 1-23-380.\r\n\n      If there is some further act which must be done by the court prior\r\n      to a determination of the rights of the parties, the order is\r\n      interlocutory. A judgment which determines the applicable law,\r\n      but leaves open questions of fact, is not a final judgment. A final\r\n      judgment disposes of the whole subject matter of the action or\r\n      terminates the particular proceeding or action, leaving nothing to\r\n      be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.\r\n\r\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg, 387 S.C. at 267, 692 S.E.2d at 894-95 (internal\r\ncitations omitted). Because the ALC's order did not finally determine\r\nwhether any party was entitled to a certificate of need, the order under review\r\nwas not a final decision and thus not immediately appealable.11 Id. at 267,\r\n692 S.E.2d at 895.\r\n\r\n       The majority therefore is correct that Charlotte-Mecklenburg rejected\r\nan \"involving the merits\" analysis with respect to administrative and agency\r\ndecisions. See id. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894 (\"[A]lthough § 14-3-330 permits\r\nappeals from interlocutory orders which involve the merits, that section is\r\ninapplicable in cases where a party seeks review of a decision of the ALC\r\nbecause the more specific statute, § 1-23-610, limits review to final decisions\r\nof the ALC.\"). Charlotte-Mecklenburg therefore examined a different statute\r\nand a different stage in the appellate process for administrative cases. Rather\r\nthan determining whether an order of the circuit court sitting in an appellate\r\ncapacity or the court of appeals is ripe for further review under the applicable\r\nstatute—section 1-23-390—Charlotte-Mecklenburg only concerned whether\r\nthe administrative order itself is final and therefore appealable to the judicial\r\n\r\n11In reaching this result, we overruled two cases \"to the extent [they] rely on\r\n[Section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code (1976)] to permit the appeal of\r\ninterlocutory orders of the ALC or an administrative agency.\" Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg, 387 S.C. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894. The cases were Canteen v.\r\nMcLeod Regional Medical Center, 384 S.C. 617, 682 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App.\r\n2009) and Oakwood Landfill, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Health &\r\nEnvironmental Control, 381 S.C. 120, 671 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2009). Both\r\nof these cases concerned the initial appeal of an administrative order, not\r\nfurther appellate review of an order of the circuit court. See Canteen, 384\r\nS.C. at 624, 682 S.E.2d at 507; Oakwood, 381 S.C. at 132, 671 S.E.2d at 653.\r\n\nbranch in the first instance. Put in the context of this case, Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg governs the appealability of the full commission's decision, not\r\nthe circuit court's order reviewing it in an appellate capacity. Because the full\r\ncommission found Bone's claim was not compensable, it rendered a final\r\njudgment and the circuit court could entertain the appeal under Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg. At this point, appealability ceased to be governed by\r\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg and is now controlled by section 1-23-390, and\r\nnothing in our opinion suggests we intended to abrogate the existing\r\nframework under it.\r\n\r\n      Once this distinction is acknowledged, the majority's concerns that an\r\n\"involving the merits\" analysis \"would result in piecemeal appeals in agency\r\ncases that would adversely affect judicial economy and compromise informed\r\njudicial review\" disappear. In fact, the interests of judicial economy actually\r\ndemand a rejection of the majority's view. If accepted, the majority's position\r\ncould leave cases trapped in a cycle of remands for years so long as some\r\nother non-ministerial determination needs to be made. This case is a prime\r\nexample. The full commission made a final decision that Bone's claim was\r\nnot compensable, a decision from which Bone was entitled to appeal.12 The\r\ncircuit court—acting as an appellate court—disagreed. Rather than permit an\r\nappeal to the court of appeals to review that decision, which potentially could\r\nfind her injuries are not compensable and end the matter, the majority would\r\nrequire the case go back to the commission. At this point, there will be new\r\nhearings conducted at great expense to both parties. Moreover, because\r\ncompensability has been established without the opportunity for further\r\nappellate review by the court of appeals, U.S. Food Service will be required\r\nto pay benefits to Bone as the case works its way back up the appellate chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12 Accordingly, the majority incorrectly states an \"involving the merits\r\nanalysis\" would postpone a final decision from the agency. In fact, the\r\nrequirement that the agency finally decide the case before a party can seek\r\njudicial review was firmly established by Charlotte-Mecklenburg.\r\n\n       Once the full commission renders a decision on what benefits are owed\r\nto Bone, the parties will return again to the court of appeals.13 In doing so,\r\nU.S. Food Service runs the risk that the court of appeals will again remand\r\nthe case, at which point it will have to start the process all over again. Only\r\nafter that court issues its \"final\" order—assuming it finds nothing else\r\nwarranting a remand—can U.S. Food Service finally argue to this Court that\r\nthe full commission correctly held Bone's claim was not compensable back in\r\nJune 2008. I fail to see how the possibility of such a result is tenable under\r\nthe guise of judicial economy. Tellingly, the majority is unable to account\r\nfor how appeals in non-agency cases which do not impose the heightened\r\nfinality requirement have the same grim results it fears my view would lead\r\nto.    Additionally, the definition of final judgment under section 1-23-390\r\nhas no impact on \"informed appellate review.\" Here again, the majority\r\nmisapprehends the stage of proceedings in which we find ourselves. It\r\ncannot be forgotten that in these cases the circuit court sits in an appellate\r\ncapacity, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg demands that the appealed order be a\r\nfinal one. Thus, by the time an administrative case arrives in the circuit court\r\nor the court of appeals, all the fact finding to support that final decision has\r\ntaken place and there is not an opportunity to introduce more evidence. The\r\nrecord therefore is closed, and our platform for review is set. Requiring that\r\nthe circuit court issue a final decision as defined in Charlotte-Mecklenburg as\r\na prerequisite to filing an appeal in the court of appeals (or the court of\r\nappeals do so before a party can petition for a writ of certiorari from this\r\nCourt) does nothing to inform appellate review.\r\n\r\n         The majority also believes the \"involving the merits\" rule is contrary\r\nto the requirement that one must exhaust his administrative remedies, but this\r\ntoo ignores the procedural posture of these cases. Exhausting one's\r\nadministrative remedies is a threshold requirement to obtaining review in the\r\ncourts. Thus, prior to appealing to the circuit court or the court of appeals,\r\nthe appellant must have already exhausted his administrative remedies and\r\nobtained a final decision from the agency. This is the effect of sections 1-23-\r\n\r\n13 Due to the changes to section 1-23-380, the case would now proceed\r\ndirectly to the court of appeals.\r\n\n380 and 1-23-610 and Charlotte-Mecklenburg. Section 1-23-390, on the\r\nother hand, governs only when an aggrieved party can proceed to the next\r\nlevel of appellate review within the judiciary; it simply has no bearing on the\r\nfinality of the agency's decision or exhaustion of remedies.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, I believe the recent court of appeals' decision in\r\nLong v. Sealed Air Corp., 391 S.C. 483, 706 S.E.2d 34 (Ct. App. 2011)—on\r\nwhich the majority relies to hold cases such as Brown are no longer good law\r\ndue to Charlotte-Mecklenburg—is incorrect. The facts of Long are strikingly\r\nsimilar to the ones presented here. Long was another workers' compensation\r\ncase, and the single commissioner found Long, the employee, failed to report\r\nhis injury within the required time frame. Id. at 484, 706 S.E.2d at 34. The\r\nfull commission affirmed. Id. Thus, the full commission made a final\r\ndecision that Long's claim was barred. The circuit court, however, held Long\r\nhad complied with the notice requirement and remanded for further\r\nproceedings. Id. at 484, 706 S.E.2d at 35.\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals first held that under section 1-23-390 and Montjoy\r\nthe circuit court's order was not appealable because \"the commission must\r\nconduct additional proceedings before a final judgment is reached.\" Id. at\r\n485, 706 S.E.2d at 35. Next, the court addressed the impact of Charlotte-\r\nMecklenburg on the analysis and found that it was \"at least an implicit\r\nrejection of Brown.\"14 Id. at 487, 706 S.E.2d at 36. As the court explained,\r\n\"In light of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, we can find no basis on which to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14  The court's logic was that because Charlotte-Mecklenburg expressly\r\noverruled Canteen, and Canteen relied on Brown, Charlotte-Mecklenburg\r\nimplicitly overruled Brown as well. Long, 391 S.C. at 487, 706 S.E.2d at 36.\r\nAs explained above in footnote 11, however, Canteen dealt with the\r\nappealability of the full commission's order, not the circuit court's. Thus, the\r\nfact it was overruled by Charlotte-Mecklenburg has no bearing on whether\r\nBrown was wrongly decided. The Canteen court even acknowledged Brown\r\nwas not on point because of this distinction. 384 S.C. at 621 n.3, 682 S.E.2d\r\nat 506 n.3.\r\n\ndistinguish any decisions, including Brown, which rely on section 14-3-33015\r\nin finding a decision of the commission appealable. Accordingly, we believe\r\nthe supreme court has effectively overruled Brown, and we will no longer\r\napply it.\" Thus, because the circuit court ordered a remand, there was no\r\nfinal decision and the order was not immediately appealable. Id.\r\n\r\n      Judge Geathers authored a dissenting opinion in Long, in which he\r\nthoroughly and cogently examined the precedents from both this Court and\r\nthe court of appeals and concluded,\r\n\r\n      [T]he circuit court's decision that [Long] gave timely notice of\r\n      her accidental injury to [Sealed Air] is the type of judgment that\r\n      is an ultimate decision on the merits because it finally determines\r\n      some substantial matter forming a defense available to Sealed\r\n      Air. This is a final decision on the merits, and the remand\r\n      language in the order has no effect on the finality of that decision.\r\n\r\nId. at 492-93, 706 S.E.2d at 39 (Geathers, J., dissenting). As Judge Geathers\r\nalso notes in his dissent, we denied certiorari in both Brown and Mungo.\r\nLong, 391 S.C. at 491, 706 S.E.2d at 38. He even was quick to point out that\r\nwe denied certiorari in Mungo—which relied on Brown—on the same day we\r\ndecided Charlotte-Mecklenburg. Id.\r\n\r\n       In my opinion, the majority in Long committed the same error the\r\nmajority commits today by over-reading Charlotte-Mecklenburg. As\r\nexplained above, Charlotte-Mecklenburg interprets another statute invoked at\r\na different stage in the proceedings, and it evinces no intent to overrule any of\r\n\r\n15Brown did not actually rely on section 14-3-330, a point which the court of\r\nappeals conceded in a footnote. Long, 391 S.C. at 487 n.4, 706 S.E.2d at 36\r\nn.4. However, the court clarified that, in its view, \"the Brown court's holding\r\nthat the appealed order is a 'final judgment' under section 1-23-390 is based\r\non a finding that the order 'involves the merits,' a concept that is relevant only\r\nunder section 14-3-330.\" Id. This is not correct. Brown's holding rested on\r\nMontjoy, Hunt, and Owens, all workers' compensation cases arising after the\r\nenactment of the APA and therefore controlled by section 1-23-390. Thus,\r\n\"involving the merits\" does not belong exclusively to section 14-3-330.\r\n\nthe cases implicating section 1-23-390. I therefore believe Brown remains\r\ngood law. Moreover, I believe the other cases from the court of appeals\r\ndiscussed above all correctly hold that appeals from final judgments\r\ninvolving the merits are countenanced under section 1-23-390. This rule\r\ndoes not result from a misguided application of section 14-4-330 to\r\nadministrative appeals, but instead from a faithful adherence to our prior\r\nprecedents in Montjoy, Hunt, and Owens. The court of appeals in Long\r\nconsequently also erred in holding Montjoy itself would not permit the\r\nemployer's appeal.\r\n\r\n       In sum, by finding Charlotte-Mecklenburg applies here, the majority\r\nhas conflated the requirements to initially appeal an administrative order with\r\nthe requirements for further appellate review beyond the circuit court or the\r\ncourt of appeals. Turning to the proper application of section 1-23-390 to\r\nthis case, the circuit court's order undoubtedly was a final decision involving\r\nthe merits of a substantial issue in the case—the compensability of the claim.\r\nAlthough the single commissioner and the full commission found Bone's\r\nclaim to not be compensable, the circuit court disagreed. It therefore\r\nremanded for a determination of the benefits owed to Bone. Thus, the\r\nquestion of compensability—one of U.S. Food Service's main defenses—was\r\ndecided with finality as there was nothing more the commission could do\r\nregarding that issue.

The crux of its suit was that Morin breached the\r\nconfidentiality and invention assignment agreements he signed when he\r\nstarted working for Milliken. A jury found for Milliken, and the court of\r\nappeals affirmed. Milliken & Co. v. Morin, 386 S.C. 1, 11-12, 685 S.E.2d\r\n828, 834-35 (Ct. App. 2009). We granted certiorari to review the narrow\r\nissue of whether these agreements are overbroad as a matter of law. We hold\r\nthey are not and affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n              FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      Morin began working for Milliken as a research physicist in 1995 in its\r\nSpartanburg, South Carolina facility. As a condition of his employment,\r\nMorin had to sign an \"Associate Agreement\" which contained provisions\r\nregarding confidentiality and the assignment of certain inventions. The\r\nconfidentiality agreement reads as follows:\r\n\r\n      CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION means all competitively\r\n      sensitive information of importance to and kept in confidence by\r\n      Milliken, which becomes known to me through my employment\r\n      with Milliken and which does not fall within the definition of\r\n      Trade Secret above.1 Such Confidential Information may be\r\n1In his brief, Morin also challenges the breadth of the trade secret definition.\r\nHowever, he did not contend it was overbroad before the court of appeals,\r\nmuch less even cite that provision to it. Therefore, he cannot now maintain\r\nhis overbreadth challenge encompasses the definition of trade secret. See\r\n\n     valuable to Milliken because of what it costs to obtain, because of\r\n     the advantages Milliken enjoys from its exclusive use, or because\r\n     its dissemination may harm Milliken's competitive position.\r\n\r\n     ....\r\n\r\n  B. EXCEPT as required in my duties to Milliken, I will never, either\r\n     during my employment by Milliken or thereafter, use or disclose,\r\n     modify or adapt any . . . Confidential Information as defined in\r\n     paragraph 3 hereinabove until three (3) years after the\r\n     termination of my employment except as authorized in the\r\n     performance of my duties for Milliken.\r\n\r\nMorin's duty to assign his inventions to Milliken is somewhat longer:\r\n\r\n  4. INVENTIONS means discoveries, improvements and ideas\r\n     (whether or not shown or described in writing or reduced to\r\n     practice), mask works (topography or semiconductor chips) and\r\n     works of authorship, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or\r\n     registerable, (1) which relate directly to the business of Milliken,\r\n     or (2) which relate to Milliken's actual or demonstrably\r\n     anticipated research or development, or (3) which result from any\r\n     work performed by me for Milliken, or (4) for which any\r\n     equipment, supplies, facility or Trade Secret or Confidential\r\n     Information of Milliken is used, or (5) which is developed on any\r\n     Milliken time.\r\n\r\n     ....\r\n\r\n  A. With respect to Inventions made, authored and conceived by me,\r\n     either solely or jointly with others, (1) during my employment,\r\n     whether or not during normal working hours or whether or not at\r\n\r\n\r\nCamp v. Springs Mortg. Corp., 310 S.C. 514, 516, 426 S.E.2d 304, 305\r\n(1993) (declining to address issue not addressed by the court of appeals).\r\n\n     Milliken's premises; or (2) within one year after termination of\r\n     my employment,2 I will:\r\n\r\n       a. Keep accurate, complete and timely records of such\r\n          Inventions, which records shall be Milliken property and\r\n          retained on Milliken's premises.\r\n       b. Promptly and fully disclose and describe such Inventions in\r\n          writing to Milliken.\r\n       c. Assign (and I do hereby assign) to Milliken all of my rights\r\n          to such Inventions, and to applications for letters patent,\r\n          copyright registrations and/or mask work registrations in all\r\n          countries and to letters patent, copyright registrations\r\n          and/or mask work registrations granted upon such\r\n          Inventions in all countries.\r\n       d. Acknowledge and deliver promptly to Milliken (without\r\n          charge to Milliken but at the expense of Milliken) such\r\n          written instruments and to do such other acts as may be\r\n          necessary in the opinion of Milliken to preserve property\r\n          rights against forfeiture, abandonment or loss and to obtain,\r\n          defend and maintain letters patent, copyright registrations\r\n          and/or mask work registrations and to vest the entire right\r\n          and title thereto in Milliken.\r\n\r\n     NOTICE: This is to notify you that paragraph A of this Milliken\r\n     \"Associate Agreement\" you are being asked to sign as a condition\r\n     of your employment does not apply to an Invention for which no\r\n     equipment, supplies, facility or proprietary information of\r\n     Milliken was used and which was developed entirely on your\r\n     own time, and (1) which does not relate (a) directly to the\r\n     business of Milliken or (b) to Milliken's actual or demonstrably\r\n     anticipated research or development, or (2) which does not result\r\n     from any work performed by you for Milliken.\r\n\r\n2 Invention assignment agreements which extend beyond the term of\r\nemployment are called \"trailer\" and \"holdover\" clauses.\r\n\n       Over the next nine years with Milliken, Morin was promoted twice,\r\nfirst to Senior Research Physicist and then to Team Leader for the Advanced\r\nYarns Team. During the time Morin was in charge of the Advanced Yarns\r\nTeam, one of Milliken's goals was to investigate the use of additives and\r\nequipment modifications to create a new type of fiber. To seek out potential\r\nuses for such a product, Milliken sent Morin to a trade show in Anaheim,\r\nCalifornia, in the Fall of 2003. Shortly thereafter, he began drafting a\r\nbusiness plan for his own company, Innegrity, which would manufacture this\r\nnew fiber. He then resigned from Milliken on May 19, 2004, and filed a\r\npatent for the fiber, which he labeled Innegra, the following November.\r\n\r\n      Milliken first caught wind of Morin's plans after he invited his former\r\ncolleagues to attend a presentation he was giving at a gathering of venture\r\ncapitalists in Greenville, South Carolina. After noting the similarities\r\nbetween Innegrity's business plan and certain projects being conducted at\r\nMilliken, Milliken raised concerns that Morin had violated the Associate\r\nAgreement. This suit soon followed.\r\n\r\n       Milliken brought several claims against Morin, but only its claims for\r\nbreach of the confidentiality agreement, breach of invention assignment\r\nprovisions, breach of the duty of loyalty, and violation of the South Carolina\r\nTrade Secrets Act were submitted to the jury. The jury found for Milliken on\r\nits breach of the confidentiality and invention assignment agreement claims,\r\nbut it found for Morin on the remaining causes of action. In the end, the jury\r\nawarded Milliken $25,324 in damages.3 Morin appealed, arguing that these\r\nagreements are overbroad and therefore unenforceable, but the court of\r\nappeals disagreed and affirmed. Milliken, 386 S.C. at 11-12, 685 S.E.2d at\r\n834-35. We granted certiorari.\r\n\r\n3 Pursuant to the invention assignment clause, Milliken requested that the\r\ncircuit court assign the Innegra patent to it from Innegrity. Because Innegrity\r\nwas no longer a party to the proceedings when the case was tried, the court\r\ndenied Milliken's request. The court of appeals affirmed, Milliken, 386 S.C.\r\nat 8-9, 685 S.E.2d at 832-33, and Milliken did not seek certiorari on this\r\nissue.\r\n\n                           STANDARD OF REVIEW \n\r\n\r\n      An action for breach of contract is an action at law. Sterling Dev. Co. v.\r\nCollins, 309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1992). On appeal from an\r\naction at law tried by a jury, we sit merely to correct errors of law. Erickson\r\nv. Jones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 464, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663-64\r\n(2006). \"Whether a contract is against public policy or is otherwise illegal or\r\nunenforceable is generally a question of law for the court.\" 17B C.J.S.\r\nContracts § 1030. We review questions of law de novo. Town of\r\nSummerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41\r\n(2008).                         LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.      APPLICABLE STANDARD\r\n      We must first resolve a question left unanswered by the court of\r\nappeals, which is under what rubric we are to evaluate the enforceability of\r\nthese agreements. Morin argues that we should analyze them as non-compete\r\nagreements and thus strictly construe them in favor of the employee. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n       \"According to the early common law of England, an agreement in\r\nrestraint of a man's right to exercise his trade or calling was void as against\r\npublic policy.\" Standard Register Co. v. Kerrigan, 238 S.C. 54, 59, 119\r\nS.E.2d 533, 536 (1961). The rationale behind this categorical rule was that at\r\nthe time a man had to be apprenticed in his trade and was bound by law to\r\nexercise it. Id. at 59-60, 119 S.E.2d at 536. \"Hence, to enforce such an\r\nagreement was to deny such person the right to earn his living and to require\r\nhim to violate an express provision of the law.\" Id. at 60, 119 S.E.2d at 536.\r\nAs the law and realities of employment have progressed, however, there has\r\nbeen \"'some amelioration of the ancient disfavor.'\" Id. (quoting Welcome\r\nWagon, Inc. v. Morris, 224 F.2d 693, 698 (4th Cir. 1955)).\r\n\r\n        \"Modern courts have usually, in passing on these contracts,\r\n        employed three criteria: (1) Is the restraint, from the standpoint of\r\n\n      the employer, reasonable in the sense that it is no greater than is\r\n      necessary to protect the employer in some legitimate business\r\n      interest? (2) From the standpoint of the employee, is the restraint\r\n      reasonable in the sense that it is not unduly harsh and oppressive\r\n      in curtailing his legitimate efforts to earn a livelihood? (3) Is the\r\n      restraint reasonable from the standpoint of a sound public\r\n      policy?\"\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Welcome Wagon, 224 F.2d at 698). We reaffirmed and\r\nexpounded upon these principles in Rental Uniform Service of Florence, Inc.\r\nv. Dudley, 278 S.C. 674, 301 S.E.2d 142 (1983). In doing so, we reiterated\r\nthat \"[r]estrictive covenants not to compete are generally disfavored and will\r\nbe strictly construed against the employer\" and added that they must also be\r\nreasonably limited \"with respect to time and place.\" Id. at 675, 301 S.E.2d at\r\n143. This is the framework Morin would have us apply here.\r\n\r\n       The agreements under review, however, are not in restraint of trade.\r\nSee Louis Altman & Malla Pollack, Callmann on Unfair Competition,\r\nTrademarks and Monopolies § 14:6 (4th ed. 2009) (\"An employee's express\r\ncommitment not to disclose his employer's confidential information, whether\r\nor not it comprises trade secrets, 'unlike the covenant not to compete cannot\r\nbe challenged as an unreasonable restraint of trade.'\" (quoting Lear Siegler,\r\nInc. v. Ark-Ell Springs, Inc., 569 F.2d 286, 289 (5th Cir. 1978))); id. § 14:17\r\n(\"If the employee agrees that all inventions and improvements in the\r\nemployer's field, patentable and unpatentable, which are developed by the\r\nemployee during his employment shall be the employer's property, such a\r\ncontract is not invalid or unenforceable as an unreasonable restraint. The\r\ncontract may even expressly impose such a duty for a period of time after\r\ntermination of the employment . . . .\").\r\n\r\n      Holdover clauses do not fit this mold because they do \"not limit the\r\nemployee's post-employment activities except with respect to the affected\r\ninventions and improvements.\" NovelAire Techs., L.L.C. v. Harrison, 50 So.\r\n3d 913, 919 (La. Ct. App. 2010) (quotations omitted). Furthermore, they \"are\r\nsimply a recognition of the fact of business life that employees sometimes\r\n\ncarry with them to new employers inventions or ideas so related to work done\r\nfor a former employer that in equity and good conscience the fruits of that\r\nwork should belong to the former employer.\" Dorr-Oliver, Inc. v. United\r\nStates, 432 F.2d 447, 452 (Cl. Ct. 1970). Thus, they do not operate in\r\nrestraint of the employee's trade but merely vest ownership of an invention\r\nwith the entity which ought to have it. Similarly, \"noncompete agreements\r\nare viewed as restraints of trade which limit an employee's freedom of\r\nmovement among employment opportunities, while nondisclosure\r\nagreements seek to restrict disclosure of information, not employment\r\nopportunities.\" Revere Transducers, Inc. v. Deere & Co., 595 N.W.2d 751,\r\n761 (Iowa 1999); see also Hayes-Albion v. Kuberski, 364 N.W.2d 609, 614\r\n(Mich. 1984) (holding Michigan's non-compete statute \"has no application\r\nwhere the plaintiff is not seeking to prevent the former employee from\r\nengaging in a similar business, but to prevent him from using the secret\r\nknowledge of his former employer\").\r\n\r\n      Because these agreements are not in restraint of trade, we hold there is\r\nno \"ancient disfavor\" and thus they are not to be strictly construed in favor of\r\nthe employee. See Carolina Chemical Equip. Co. v. Muckenfuss, 322 S.C.\r\n289, 302, 471 S.E.2d 721, 728 (Ct. App. 1996) (Cureton, J., dissenting) (\"'In\r\nthis area, courts impose no presumptions against employers and do not\r\nsubject the employee's promise or covenant not to disclose to a rigid test or\r\nanalysis.'\" (quoting Timothy D. Scranton & Cherie Lynne Wilson,\r\nPostemployment Covenants Not to Compete in South Carolina: Wizards and\r\nDragons in the Kingdom, 42 S.C. L. Rev. 657, 682 (1991))). Accordingly,\r\nthe scope of the restriction is determined using ordinary principles of contract\r\nlaw.4 See Revere Transducers, 595 N.W.2d at 761 (\"Nondisclosure-\r\n4 If upon review they are so broad as to effectively become non-compete\r\nagreements, then they are subject to the higher burden. See Almers v. S.C.\r\nNat'l Bank of Charleston, 265 S.C. 48, 59, 217 S.E.2d 135, 140 (1975)\r\n(holding a pension forfeiture clause invoked when an employee went to work\r\nfor a competitor had the same effect as a non-compete agreement because\r\n\"[w]hen pruned to their quintessence, they tend to accomplish the same\r\nresults and should be treated accordingly\"); Carolina Chemical Equip. Co.,\r\n322 S.C. at 293-94, 471 S.E.2d at 723 (majority opinion) (\"Despite its\r\n\nconfidentiality agreements enjoy more favorable treatment in the law than do\r\nnoncompete agreements.\"); NovelAire, 50 So. 3d at 918 (\"NovelAire\r\ncontends that the Agreement is a standard contract to provide for the\r\nownership, as between an employer and an employee, of discoveries the\r\nemployee made while working for the employer, and to keep those\r\ndiscoveries as confidential. NovelAire contends that neither of these\r\ncontractual requirements constitute non-compete contracts. We agree.\").\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, these agreements are still restrictive covenants and public\r\npolicy demands their scope be subject to judicial review for reasonableness.\r\nWhen evaluating these provisions, courts should look to the more general\r\nstandard enunciated in Standard Register, namely whether the restriction is\r\nreasonable in that it is no greater than necessary to protect the employer's\r\nlegitimate interests, and it is not unduly harsh in that it curtails the employee's\r\nability to earn a living.5 238 S.C. at 60, 119 S.E.2d at 536; see also Revere\r\n\r\n\r\ndesignation as a 'Covenant Not to Divulge Trade Secrets,' this section would\r\nsubstantially restrict Muckenfuss's competitive employment activities.\r\nBecause it basically has the effect of a covenant not to compete, we must\r\nsubject it to the same scrutiny as a covenant not to compete.\"). The clauses\r\nin question here are not this broad and therefore do not implicate these cases.\r\nSee discussion, infra, Part II.\r\n5  Geographic scope has no relevance for invention assignment or\r\nconfidentiality provisions. Revere Transducers, 595 N.W.2d at 761; Peter\r\nCaldwell, Employment Agreements for the Inventing Worker: A Proposal for\r\nReforming Trailer Clause Enforceability Guidelines, 13 J. Intell. Prop. L.\r\n279, 296 (2006). However, a holdover clause must be reasonably limited in\r\ntime. Altman & Pollack, supra, § 14:17. On the other hand, the absence of a\r\ntime limitation in a confidentiality clause will not automatically render it\r\ninvalid. Revere Transducers, 595 N.W.2d at 761; see also Carolina Chemical\r\nEquip. Co., 322 S.C. at 301, 471 S.E.2d at 727 (Cureton, J., dissenting)\r\n(\"Agreements not to divulge confidential information, unlike noncompetition\r\nagreements, may be valid and enforceable under certain circumstances even\r\nthough they are unlimited as to time and place.\"). In any event, employers\r\nare afforded greater leeway with the temporal scope of these clauses than\r\n\nTransducers, 595 N.W.2d at 761-62 (noting that reasonableness elements of\r\nnon-compete clause analysis still remain for confidentiality agreements and\r\n\"[t]he determining factor of whether assignment-of-rights-agreements are\r\nenforceable seems to be one of reasonableness\"); Ingersoll-Rand Co. v.\r\nCiavatta, 524 A.2d 866, 869 (N.J. 1987) (holding an invention assignment\r\nclause must \"be reviewed as to its reasonableness, with an awareness of the\r\npractical realities of the business and employment world\"); Caldwell, supra,\r\nat 292, 299 (stating the \"subject matter is the only truly relevant factor\" for\r\nholdover clauses, and it must be balanced by \"'weigh[ing] the competing\r\ninterest of employer and employee and [] giv[ing] full consideration to the\r\npublic interest.'\" (quoting Universal Winding Co. v. Clarke, 108 F. Supp. 329,\r\n332 (D. Conn. 1952))).\r\n\r\n   II.   ENFORCEABILITY OF AGREEMENTS\r\n      With this framework in mind, we turn next to the enforceability of the\r\nholdover and confidentiality agreements Morin signed. In our opinion, both\r\nof them are facially valid.\r\n\r\n         A. Holdover Clause\r\n      As has been eloquently stated, \"A naked assignment or agreement to\r\nassign, in gross, a man's future labors as an author or inventor[—]in other\r\nwords, a mortgage on a man's brain, to bind all its future products[—]does\r\nnot address itself favorably to our consideration.\" Aspinwall Mfg. Co. v. Gill,\r\n32 F. 697, 700 (C.C.D.N.J. 1887). However, where the agreement does not\r\n\"implicate all of a researcher's future inventions 'in gross'\" but rather applies\r\nto inventions derived from his work for the employer, it is enforceable. St.\r\nJohn's Univ., N.Y. v. Bolton, 757 F. Supp. 2d 144, 162 (E.D.N.Y. 2010).\r\nMorin himself even agrees that Milliken has no right to his \"inventive ideas\r\nunless those ideas relate directly to his work for Milliken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith non-compete agreements. Reverse Transducers, 595 N.W.2d at 761;\r\nCaldwell, supra, at 297.\r\n\n      An employer therefore has a legitimate interest in protecting inventions\r\nthat are the fruits of its employees' efforts while working for the company.\r\nIndeed, such provisions \"are simply a recognition of the fact of business life\r\nthat employees sometimes carry with them to new employers inventions or\r\nideas so related to work done for a former employer that in equity and good\r\nconscience the fruits of that work should belong to the former employer.\"\r\nDorr-Oliver, 432 F.2d at 452. Thus, we must first examine the scope of the\r\ninvention assignment clause and determine whether it falls within these\r\nparameters.\r\n\r\n      The invention assignment agreement Morin signed is embodied in a\r\ncomplex set of paragraphs which by no means are an exercise in clarity.\r\nAfter sorting through the morass, however, the impact of the agreement is\r\nmuch narrower than it may appear initially. The agreement first applies to all\r\ninventions, a term which is defined quite broadly. It covers:\r\n\r\n     discoveries, improvements and ideas (whether or not shown or\r\n     described in writing or reduced to practice), mask works\r\n     (topography or semiconductor chips) and works of authorship,\r\n     whether or not patentable, copyrightable or registerable,\r\n        (1) which relate directly to the business of Milliken, or\r\n        (2) which relate to Milliken's actual or demonstrably\r\n                     \t\r\n            anticipated research or development, or\r\n        (3) which result from any work performed by me for Milliken,\r\n            or\r\n        (4) for which any equipment, supplies, facility or Trade Secret\r\n            or Confidential Information of Milliken is used, or\r\n        (5) which is developed on any Milliken time.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, any discovery, etc, which meets any of the five criteria\r\ncontained in the agreement is an invention and is to be assigned.\r\n\r\n      However, the agreement also contains a rather broad exception to this\r\ninclusive definition. It excepts an invention, as defined above,\r\n\n      for which no equipment, supplies, facility or proprietary\r\n      information of Milliken was used and\r\n      which was developed entirely on your own time, and\r\n         (1) which does not relate\r\n               (a) directly to the business of Milliken or\r\n               (b) to Milliken's actual or demonstrably anticipated\r\n                   research or development, or\r\n         (2) which does not result from any work performed by you for\r\n             Milliken.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Morin's contention is that the invention assignment clause is overbroad\r\nbecause it grants Milliken rights to one of Morin's inventions \"irrespective of\r\nwhether his invention is legitimately an extension of research he did for\r\nMilliken.\"6 This argument is based on a misreading of the agreement. Under\r\ngeneral principles of contract law, we find first as a matter of law that this\r\nagreement is unambiguous. See Miles v. Miles, 393 S.C. 111, 117, 711 S.E.2d\r\n880, 883 (2011) (\"[W]hether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.\").\r\nWe must therefore apply the contract's plain language. Alexander's Land Co.\r\nv. M & M & K Corp., 390 S.C. 582, 598, 703 S.E.2d 207, 215 (2010). Under\r\nthe terms of the agreement, if the invention either7 does not relate to\r\nMilliken's work or was not the result of work performed by the employee for\r\nMilliken, then it is not covered. Conversely, for the exception to not apply—\r\nand thus require assignment of the invention—it must both relate to\r\nMilliken's business/research and result from the employee's work at Milliken.\r\n\r\n6 Morin directs his arguments towards the interplay between subparts (1) and\r\n(2) of the exception, not the rest of it. Because we do not believe requiring\r\nthe assignment of inventions that were developed using the employer's\r\nequipment, supplies, and proprietary information, or which were developed\r\non the employer's time, renders the agreement overbroad as a matter of law,\r\nwe similarly confine our discussion.\r\n7 We reject Morin's argument that Milliken really meant to use the word\r\n\"and\" instead of \"or\" in the exception.\r\n\nThus, so long as the invention does not relate to work performed by the\r\nemployee, it is not to be assigned.\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, the agreement is not broader than necessary to protect\r\nMilliken's legitimate business interests. Moreover, the one-year holdover\r\nprovision is eminently reasonable. See Rental Uniform Serv., 278 S.C. at 676,\r\n301 S.E.2d at 143 (finding a three-year restraint is not \"obnoxious\" even in\r\nthe context of a non-compete agreement). It also is not unduly harsh or\r\noppressive because Morin still is entitled to any invention that does not result\r\nfrom his work at Milliken; thus, he is still of great value to future employees.\r\nWe therefore hold that Milliken's invention assignment and holdover clause\r\nis not so broad as to be unenforceable as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n         B. Confidentiality Clause\r\n      It is widely recognized that an employer may \"restrain a former\r\nemployee from disclosing and using confidential information which was\r\ndeveloped as a result of the employer's initiative and investment and which\r\nthe employee learned as a result of the employment relationship.\" GTI Corp.\r\nv. Calhoon, 309 F. Supp. 762, 768 (S.D. Ohio 1969); see also Roberson v.\r\nC.P. Allen Const. Co., 50 So. 3d 471, 475 (Ala. Civ. App. 2010) (\"[A]n\r\nemployer has a protectable interest sufficient to justify enforcement of a\r\nnoncompete agreement if an employee was in a position to gain confidential\r\ninformation, access to secret lists, or to develop a close relationship with\r\nclients. A protectable interest can also arise from the employer's investment\r\nin its employee, in terms of time, resources and responsibility.\" (quotations\r\nand alterations omitted)); ACAS Acquisitions (Precitech) Inc. v. Hobert, 923\r\nA.2d 1076, 1084-85 (N.H. 2007) (\"Legitimate interests of an employer that\r\nmay be protected from competition include: the employer's trade secrets that\r\nhave been communicated to the employee during the course of employment;\r\nconfidential information other than trade secrets communicated by the\r\nemployer to the employee, such as information regarding a unique business\r\nmethod; an employee's special influence over the employer's customers,\r\nobtained during the course of employment; contacts developed during the\r\nemployment; and the employer's development of goodwill and a positive\r\nimage.\"); Shepherd v. Pittsburgh Glass Works, LLC, 25 A.3d 1233, 1244 (Pa.\r\n\n2011) (\"The kinds of business interests that are considered legitimate and\r\nprotectable under a restrictive covenant include trade secrets and confidential\r\ninformation . . . .\"). As above, we must therefore first delineate the\r\nboundaries of Milliken's confidentiality agreement and determine whether it\r\nfalls within this scope.\r\n\r\n      The heart of Morin's claim is that the confidentiality provision is so\r\nbroad that it prevents him from using his own general skills, knowledge, and\r\ninventive ability as opposed to just restricting the dissemination of Milliken's\r\npropriety information.8 The definition of confidential information in\r\nMilliken's Associate Agreement contains five elements, all of which must be\r\nmet in order for the information in question to be deemed confidential:\r\n\r\n     (1) competitively sensitive information\r\n     (2) of importance to and\r\n     (3) kept in confidence by Milliken,\r\n     (4) which \t ecomes known to the employee through his\r\n                  b\r\n         employment with Milliken, and\r\n     (5) which is not a trade secret.\r\n\r\nIt does not take much elaboration to see that rather than covering general\r\nskills and knowledge, it encompasses only important information not\r\ngenerally known to the public which becomes known to the employee\r\nthrough his employment with Milliken. Thus, the court of appeals did not err\r\nin holding that \"[t]he three-year provision did not prohibit Morin from\r\ndisclosing or using any and all information he learned working at Milliken, or\r\nusing the general knowledge and skills he learned while working there.\"\r\nMilliken, 386 S.C. at 11-12, 685 S.E.2d at 834.\r\n\r\n      Milliken accordingly has a legitimate business interest it can protect\r\nthrough the use of the confidentiality agreement, and the agreement does not\r\nsweep any broader than this on its face. Although not necessarily required,\r\n8 Although Morin's brief lodges a multi-faceted attack against the\r\nconfidentiality clause, the sole issue on which we granted certiorari is\r\nwhether it is facially enforceable as a matter of law.\r\n\nthe agreement is also reasonably limited to only three years. See Rental\r\nUniform Serv., 278 S.C. at 676, 301 S.E.2d at 143. Furthermore, it is not\r\nunduly harsh and oppressive as Morin is perfectly able to use his general\r\nskills and knowledge in a new line of employment. While Morin may be\r\nrestricted from using certain information he learned at Milliken for his own\r\npersonal advantage, these agreements are designed to strike an appropriate\r\nbalance between protecting an employer's valuable interest in its proprietary\r\ninformation and permitting an employee to find gainful employment in his\r\nchosen field. See GTI Corp., 309 F. Supp. at 768; Serv. Ctrs. of Chicago, Inc.\r\nv. Minogue, 535 N.E.2d 1132, 1135 (Ill. App. Ct. 1989). In our opinion,\r\nMilliken's agreement, on its face, strikes a valid balance and therefore is\r\nenforceable.                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      We therefore hold confidentiality and invention assignment clauses are\r\nnot in restraint of trade and should not be strictly construed in favor of the\r\nemployee. Under a more general reasonableness standard of enforceability,\r\nMilliken's agreements here are reasonably tailored and therefore enforceable\r\nas a matter of law. We accordingly affirm the court of appeals, modifying its\r\nopinion only to the extent that we adopt the standard enunciated above.\r\n\r\n     TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27155","title":"Weston v.

Weston v. Kim's Dollar Store, 385 S.C. 520, 684\r\nS.E.2d 769 (Ct. App. 2009). Petitioner Monica Weston purchased a pair of\r\nprescription decorative, colored contact lenses without a prescription from\r\nRespondent Kim's Dollar Store, an unauthorized seller. The lenses were\r\nmanufactured by Respondent CIBA Vision (CIBA). Petitioner developed an eye\r\ninfection which led to the loss of vision in her left eye. Thereafter, Petitioner\r\nbrought an action against Kim's Dollar Store and CIBA alleging six causes of\r\naction. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of CIBA as to\r\nthree of the six causes of action based on federal preemption, and the court of\r\nappeals affirmed.\r\n\r\nOn certiorari, Petitioner concedes the lenses she purchased are Class III medical\r\ndevices but argues her claims are not preempted because CIBA failed to show the\r\nlenses were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the\r\npre-market approval (PMA) process. Having carefully canvassed the voluminous\r\nrecord, we find these lenses were FDA approved through the PMA process.\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the court of appeals to the extent partial summary\r\njudgment was granted on claims that would impose common-law requirements\r\n\"different from, or in addition to\" applicable FDA requirements. As to the\r\nremaining causes of action, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.                                 I.\r\n\r\n                           PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe underlying facts are set forth in the court of appeals' well-reasoned opinion.\r\nFor ease of reference, we reiterate only that the contact lenses Petitioner purchased\r\nwere FreshLook Colors brand lenses with ultraviolet (UV) protection, to be sold by\r\nprescription only, and approved for extended wear. The lenses were non-\r\ncorrective, or \"plano\" lenses.\r\n\nPetitioner filed suit against Kim's Dollar Store and CIBA alleging six causes of\r\naction and seeking damages for her injuries.1 Essentially, Petitioner claimed CIBA\r\nknew its plano lenses were frequently sold without a prescription and by\r\nunauthorized sellers, yet CIBA failed to take steps to ensure customers received\r\nlenses by prescription only and with appropriate warnings and instructions. CIBA\r\nmoved for summary judgment on the basis that Petitioner's claims were preempted\r\nby federal law. Following a hearing, the trial court granted partial summary\r\njudgment in favor of CIBA as to Petitioner's claims based on \"warning, labeling,\r\ndesign, marketing, misbranding, or similar claims.\"\r\n\r\nThe court of appeals affirmed the partial grant of summary judgment, finding\r\nCIBA demonstrated that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether\r\nFreshLook Colors plano lenses underwent the PMA process and were subject to\r\ndevice-specific FDA requirements. As to Petitioner's state common-law claims,\r\nthe court of appeals found \"[a]ny state requirements imposed by a jury verdict in\r\nfavor of the causes of action at issue would be in addition to or in contradiction of\r\nfederal requirements, and therefore . . . were properly dismissed by the circuit\r\ncourt.\" Weston, 385 S.C. at 537, 684 S.E.2d at 778.\r\n\r\nBefore now, Petitioner has vigorously claimed that the contact lenses she\r\npurchased should be considered a cosmetic, not a medical device, and substantial\r\nportions of the trial court's order and the court of appeals' opinion were devoted to\r\nthat issue. However, Petitioner now concedes the plano lenses she purchased are\r\nClass III medical devices. Thus, the sole issue before this Court is Petitioner's\r\nclaim that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether FreshLook Colors\r\nUV plano lenses were subject to FDA approval through the PMA process.\r\n\r\n1 The six causes of action in Petitioner's amended complaint are as follows: (1)\r\nnegligence per se for violating state and federal statutory requirements regarding\r\nthe manufacture, promotion, and sale of FreshLook Colors lenses; (2) negligence\r\nin the manufacture, sale, promotion, and distribution of FreshLook Colors lenses;\r\n(3) breach of implied warranty of merchantability and fitness because the lenses\r\nwere not safely labeled; (4) strict liability for placing defectively labeled products\r\ninto the stream of commerce; (5) sale of a defective product for inadequate\r\nwarnings; and (6) a claim under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act,\r\nbased on CIBA's willful and knowing failure to comply with state and federal\r\nstatutes regarding the sale and distribution of FreshLook Colors lenses.\r\n\n                                          II.\r\n\r\n                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nA trial court may grant summary judgment \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers\r\nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\r\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. \"Summary\r\njudgment should be granted only where it is perfectly clear that no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact exists and inquiry into facts is not desirable to clarify application of\r\nthe law.\" Wortman v. Spartanburg, 310 S.C. 1, 4, 425 S.E.2d 18, 20 (1992). \"An\r\nappellate court applies the same standard used by the trial court under Rule 56(c)\r\nwhen reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment.\" Epstein v. Coastal\r\nTimber Co., 393 S.C. 276, 281, 711 S.E.2d 912, 915 (2011). \"In determining\r\nwhether summary judgment is proper, the court must construe all ambiguities,\r\nconclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence against the moving party.\"\r\nByers v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 310 S.C. 5, 7, 425 S.E.2d 23, 24 (1992).\r\n\r\n                                          III.\r\n\r\n                                     ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe applicable law regarding federal regulation of contact lenses is set forth in the\r\ncourt of appeal's well-researched and reasoned opinion. Here, we reiterate only\r\nthat Congress included an express preemption provision in the Medical Device\r\nAmendments of 1976 (MDA),2 which provides:\r\n\r\n        [N]o State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue\r\n        with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement—\r\n          (1) which is different from, or in addition to, any\r\n          requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and\r\n          (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to\r\n          any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the\r\n          device under this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n2   See generally Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 301-399d.\r\n\n21 U.S.C. § 360k(a) (emphasis added). The United States Supreme Court made\r\nclear in its recent decision in National Meat Ass'n v. Harris, that express\r\npreemption provisions should be construed broadly, with an eye towards a federal\r\nagency's extensive authority and responsibility of ensuring the safety and\r\neffectiveness of consumer products.3 132 S.Ct. 965 (2012). Although Harris\r\nexamined a different federal regulatory scheme, we believe that opinion is\r\ninstructive as to the broad manner in which express preemption provisions should\r\nbe construed, particularly where, as here, the federal regulatory scheme at issue\r\ndoes not contain a saving clause.\r\n\r\n3 Harris involved the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), which imposes\r\nrequirements upon slaughterhouses' handling of certain animals. At issue was the\r\nefficacy of a California statute governing the treatment of certain animals in\r\nslaughterhouses, including those regulated under FMIA. The FMIA includes an\r\nexpress preemption provision stating:\r\n\r\n      Requirements within the scope of [FMIA] with respect to premises,\r\n      facilities and operations of any establishment at which inspection is\r\n      provided under [FMIA] which are in addition to, or different than\r\n      those made under [FMIA] may not be imposed by any State.\r\n\r\n21 U.S.C. § 678 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe FMIA also includes a saving clause, which states that the Act \"shall not\r\npreclude any State . . . from making requirement[s] or taking other action,\r\nconsistent with this [Act], with respect to any other matters regulated under this\r\n[Act].\" Harris, 132 S.Ct. at 969, n.3 (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 678).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the saving clause, the United States Supreme Court construed the\r\nFMIA's express preemption provision to find that it \"sweeps widely—and in so\r\ndoing, blocks the applications of [the California statute] challenged here. The\r\nclause prevents a State from imposing any additional or different—even if non-\r\nconflicting—requirements that fall within the scope of the [FMIA] and concern a\r\nslaughterhouse's facilities or operations.\" Id. at 970. The Supreme Court stated,\r\n\"California's [statute] endeavors to regulate the same thing, at the same time, in the\r\nsame place—except by imposing different requirements [than the FMIA].\" Id. at\r\n975. Accordingly, the Supreme Court concluded the California statute was\r\npreempted. Id.\r\n\nAs to federal requirements, pre-market approval imposes device-specific\r\nrequirements as contemplated by the MDA. Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U.S.\r\n312, 322 (2008). \"Absent other indication, reference to a State's 'requirements'\r\nincludes its common-law duties.\" Id. at 324. However, \"State requirements are\r\npre-empted under the MDA only to the extent that they are 'different from, or in\r\naddition to' the requirements imposed by federal law.\" Id. at 330. \"Thus, § 360k\r\ndoes not prevent a State from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on\r\na violation of FDA regulations; the state duties in such a case 'parallel,' rather than\r\nadd to, federal requirements.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThus, the first step in the preemption inquiry is to determine whether the federal\r\ngovernment has established requirements applicable to the device through the\r\nPMA process. Id. at 321. If so, the next step is to determine whether the state\r\ncommon-law claims parallel the federal requirements (then, the state claim is not\r\npreempted) or whether the state common-law claims are \"different from, or in\r\naddition to\" the federal requirements (then, state claim is preempted). Petitioner\r\nnow argues the contact lenses at issue here—plano lenses with UV protection—\r\nwere never subject to PMA or supplemental PMA.\r\n\r\nThe key question in the present case is whether the lenses Petitioner purchased\r\nwere subject to device-specific federal requirements imposed by virtue of the PMA\r\nprocess.4 Like the court of appeals, we find there is no genuine issue or dispute\r\nthat the lenses Petitioner purchased are subject to device-specific federal\r\nrequirements by virtue of the PMA process.\r\n\r\nThere is no dispute that the lenses Petitioner purchased were UV lenses. In 1996,\r\nCIBA received a letter from the FDA approving PMA supplement number 39,\r\nwhich \"requested approval for incorporating an ultra-violet absorber\" into\r\n\r\n4 CIBA asserts there exists a mechanism whereby the FDA's position on whether a\r\ndevice is covered by a PMA may be sought. At the trial court level and on appeal,\r\nCIBA has requested that each court seek the FDA's position on whether it granted\r\nPMA with respect to the lenses in question. However, Petitioner has consistently\r\nobjected to such an inquiry being made. We have not researched the availability of\r\nthis option because we find further steps to ascertain the FDA's position are\r\nunnecessary. We find the record is manifestly clear that the lenses Petitioner\r\npurchased received PMA.\r\n\nFreshLook Colors UV lenses. Additionally, the FDA approved a supplemental\r\nPMA in 1999 that provided in part that FreshLook lenses \"with UV-absorbing\r\nmonomer help protect against the transmission of harmful UV radiation to the\r\ncornea and into the eye.\" Thus, because of the presence of the UV-absorbing\r\ncomponent, we find that these lenses were subject to device-specific FDA\r\nrequirements. The record establishes as a matter of law that these lenses are\r\ncovered by PMAs. The first prong of the Riegel standard has been met and,\r\ntherefore, express preemption is triggered.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the section 360k inquiry—whether Petitioner's state claims are\r\ndifferent from or in addition to the device's specific federal requirements. As noted\r\nabove, only state requirements that are \"different from, or in addition to\" the\r\nrequirements imposed by the PMA process are preempted. State common law\r\nclaims premised on a violation of FDA requirements that \"parallel,\" rather than add\r\nto, federal requirements are not preempted. Riegel, 552 U.S. at 330. Here,\r\nPetitioner claims CIBA knew or should have known that its lenses were being\r\nmarketed and sold unlawfully.5\r\n\r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment as to Petitioner's \"claims that are\r\ndependent on warning, labeling, design, marketing, misbranding, or similar claims.\r\nSpecifically, Count II, Count V, and Count VI of the Complaint are hereby\r\ndismissed.\" At oral argument, CIBA's counsel conceded that Petitioner's claim\r\nregarding negligence in the manufacture of FreshLook Colors lenses survives\r\nsummary judgment. Accordingly, to the extent partial summary judgment was\r\ngranted in that regard, we vacate the trial court's order.\r\n\r\nFurther, we hold that, to the extent Petitioner seeks to challenge the sufficiency of\r\nthe FDA-approved requirements imposed in the PMA process, the partial grant of\r\nsummary judgment was entirely proper. Any claim that imposes requirements\r\ndifferent from or additional to those set forth in the PMA is expressly preempted.\r\nHowever, any claim that parallels applicable federal requirements may proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5Essentially, Petitioner claims CIBA knew its plano lenses were frequently sold\r\nwithout a prescription and by unauthorized sellers, yet CIBA failed to take steps to\r\nensure customers received the lenses through prescriptions only and with\r\nappropriate warnings and instructions.\r\n\n                                        IV.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of specificity in Petitioner's complaint and the trial court's order\r\ngranting summary judgment, we regret we cannot be more specific in delineating\r\nwhich claims survive the partial grant of summary judgment. Therefore, for the\r\nforegoing reasons and in accordance with section 360k, we affirm the partial grant\r\nof summary judgment to the extent it was granted on claims that would impose\r\ncommon-law requirements \"different from, or in addition to\" applicable FDA\r\nrequirements. As to the remaining causes of action, we remand for further\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27156","title":"Alltel v.

Alltel Commc'ns, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nRevenue, Op. No. 2010-UP-232 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 7, 2010). This case\r\npresents the legal question of whether the Alltel Entities (collectively Petitioners),\r\nwhich are cellular service providers, are included in the definition of \"telephone\r\ncompany\" for the purpose of increased license fees in S.C. Code Ann. section 12-\r\n20-100 (2000). Pursuant to cross motions for summary judgment, the\r\nAdministrative Law Court (ALC) granted summary judgment in favor of\r\nPetitioners, finding that they were not telephone companies for purposes of section\r\n12-20-100. Alternatively, the ALC found that if the statute were ambiguous,\r\nPetitioners would prevail under the rule that an ambiguity in a taxing statute must\r\nbe construed in favor of the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nAlthough the court of appeals recognized that the application of section 12-20-100\r\nto Petitioners is not \"absolutely clear,\" it reversed the grant of summary judgment\r\nand remanded the matter to the ALC for additional fact finding. We reverse the\r\ncourt of appeals and reinstate the ALC's grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\n\nPetitioners. The term \"telephone company\" is not a defined term and its\r\napplication to Petitioners is doubtful, as the court of appeals conceded. The\r\npresence of an ambiguity in a tax assessment statute requires that a court resolve\r\nthat doubt in favor of the taxpayer. Accordingly, we resolve the case in line with\r\nthe ALC's alternative holding.          I.\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is proper where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\r\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also ALC Rule\r\n68 (stating the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure may be applied in\r\nproceedings before the ALC to resolve questions not addressed by the ALC rules).\r\nThe question of statutory interpretation is one of law for the court to decide.\r\nCFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty. Assessor, 395 S.C. 67, 73, 716 S.E.2d 877, 881\r\n(2011). A reviewing court may reverse the decision of the ALC where it is in\r\nviolation of a statutory provision or it is affected by an error of law. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 1-23-610(B)(a), (d) (Supp. 2011).  II.\r\n\r\nPetitioners are engaged in the business of providing wireless communication\r\nservices, or \"cell phone\" services, via radio waves within South Carolina.\r\nPetitioners timely filed corporate income tax returns with the Department of\r\nRevenue (DOR) with the required license fee reports for the years ending\r\nDecember 31, 1999 through December 31, 2003. Petitioners calculated their\r\nannual corporate license fee for the years at issue in accordance with the license fee\r\ngenerally applicable to corporations. See S.C. Code Ann. § 12-20-50 (requiring\r\nevery corporation, except those that qualify as utilities and electric cooperatives, to\r\npay a general annual license fee as determined by the records of the corporation).\r\nIn 2004, DOR conducted an audit and assessed a total deficiency of $4,709,671\r\nagainst Petitioners, consisting of underpaid corporate license fees, understatement\r\npenalties, and interest. The basis for the deficiency was DOR's determination that\r\nPetitioners had erroneously used section 12-20-50 to calculate their license fees.\r\nDOR asserted each Petitioner was a \"telephone company\" and therefore required to\r\npay heightened license fees imposed on utilities and electric cooperatives in\r\naccordance with section 12-20-100. Specifically, section 12-20-100(A) provides:\r\n\nIn the place of the license fee imposed by Section 12-20-50, every express\r\ncompany, street railway company, navigation company, waterworks\r\ncompany, power company, electric cooperative, light company, gas\r\ncompany, telegraph company, and telephone company shall file an annual\r\nreport with the department and pay a [heightened] license fee . . . . 1\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-20-100(A) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nEach Petitioner filed a protest of the proposed deficiency pursuant to S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Section 12-60-450 (2000). DOR subsequently issued its determination\r\ndenying all protests. Thereafter, Petitioners filed requests for a contested case\r\nhearing with the ALC, seeking to challenge DOR's deficiency assessment.\r\nBecause the challenge presented a single question of statutory construction, the\r\ncases were consolidated, and the matter was submitted to the ALC on stipulations\r\nand cross motions for summary judgment. In relevant part, the parties stipulated\r\nthat:    (44) Petitioners are each a \"radio common carrier\" because each is a\r\n         corporation \"owning or operating in this State equipment or facilities\r\n         for the transmission of intelligence by modulated radio frequency\r\n         signal, for compensation to the public\";\r\n\r\n         (50) \"Telephones and telephone companies transmit intelligence over\r\n         a vast network of wires located in public rights of way and in\r\n         easements over private property\";\r\n\r\n1   The heightened license fees are as follows:\r\n\r\n         (1) one dollar for each thousand dollars, or fraction of a thousand\r\n         dollars, of fair market value of property owned and used within this\r\n         State in the conduct of business as determined by the department for\r\n         property tax purposes for the preceding taxable year; and\r\n\r\n         (2)(a) three dollars for each thousand dollars, or fraction of a thousand\r\n         dollars, of gross receipts derived from services rendered from\r\n         regulated business within this State during the preceding taxable year\r\n         ....\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-20-100(A).\r\n\n      (51) Petitioners \"do not have facilities located in public rights of\r\n      way\"; and\r\n\r\n      (52) Petitioners provide \"wireless voice and data communications\r\n      services [using] radio communication towers or facilities owned or\r\n      leased by [Petitioners] or licensed to [Petitioners].\"\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe ALC granted Petitioners' motion for summary judgment. The ALC found\r\nPetitioners were not required to pay the heightened license fees imposed by section\r\n12-20-100 because they were not \"telephone compan[ies]\" under the plain\r\nlanguage of the statute and the parties agreed upon the definition of \"telephone\r\ncompany\" found in Stipulation 50. Additionally, the ALC noted that while\r\nlandline telephone companies have been given the power of eminent domain and\r\nthe authority to install wires and facilities in public rights-of-way, wireless service\r\nproviders have not been given these same privileges.\r\n\r\nThe ALC alternatively ruled that even if the term \"telephone company\" were\r\nambiguous, Petitioners must prevail. Here, the ALC referenced the settled\r\nprinciple that any substantial doubt in the application of a tax statute must be\r\nresolved in favor of the taxpayer. See Cooper River Bridge, Inc. v. S.C. Tax\r\nComm'n, 182 S.C. 72, 76, 188 S.E. 508, 509-510 (1936) (\"[W]here the language\r\nrelied upon to bring a particular person within a tax law is ambiguous or is\r\nreasonably susceptible of an interpretation that will exclude such person, then the\r\nperson will be excluded, any substantial doubt being resolved in his favor.\").\r\n\r\nAs noted, in an unpublished opinion, the court of appeals reversed and remanded\r\nthe ALC's order, holding summary judgment was improper because the application\r\nof section 12-20-100 to Petitioners was not \"absolutely clear as a matter of law.\"\r\nThe court found the ALC erroneously relied on Stipulation 50's definition of the\r\nterm \"telephone company\" in its determination that Petitioners were not a\r\ntelephone company under the plain language of the statute. The court correctly\r\nnoted that determining the meaning of section 12-20-100 was an issue of law to be\r\ndecided by the court, rather than the parties, and that courts are not bound by\r\nparties' stipulations of law. See Greenville Cnty. Fair Ass'n v. Christenberry, 198\r\nS.C. 338, 17 S.E.2d 857 (1941); cf. Media Gen.Commc'ns , Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n\nRevenue, 388 S.C. 138, 151-52, 694 S.E.2d 525, 531-32 (2010) (accepting and\r\nrelying on parties factual stipulations regarding the taxable income formulas at\r\nissue).\r\n\r\nThe court of appeals, however, did not attempt to define the term \"telephone\r\ncompany.\" Instead, it remanded the case for additional development of the facts,\r\nfinding more information was needed regarding the nature of Petitioners' services\r\nin order to determine whether they were \"telephone compan[ies]\" for purposes of\r\nsection 12-20-100.2                    III.\r\n\r\nThe parties agree that Petitioners use radio waves, not landlines, to transmit\r\ncommunications. According to Petitioners, the plain meaning of the term\r\n\"telephone company,\" in conjunction with the stipulations entered into by the\r\nparties, demonstrates that \"telephone company\" means a company that employs\r\nlandlines and wires to transmit telephonic communications. Thus, Petitioners\r\nargue they are not subject to the heightened license fee of section 12-20-100 under\r\nthe plain meaning rule.3 \"The usual rules of statutory construction apply to the\r\n\r\n2 In our opinion, a remand to the ALC for further factual development would be\r\nfutile in light of the 63 joint stipulations filed by the parties, including the\r\nstipulations regarding Petitioners' business and the technologies Petitioners use to\r\nprovide wireless communication services. In this case, the summary judgment\r\ninquiry was purely one of law. See CFRE, LLC, 395 S.C. at 73, 716 S.E.2d at 881\r\n(noting questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law for the court to\r\ndecide). Moreover, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, thereby\r\nindicating the parties' belief that further development of the facts was unnecessary.\r\nSee Harrison W. Corp. v. Gulf Oil Co., 662 F.2d 690, 692 (10th Cir. 1981)\r\n(\"[C]ross motions for summary judgments do authorize the court to assume that\r\nthere is no evidence which needs to be considered other than that which has been\r\nfiled by the parties.\").\r\n3 Petitioners' position, adopted by the ALC, has ostensible merit. The predecessor\r\nto section 12-20-100 was enacted in 1904, yet more than a century later the term\r\n\"telephone company\" remains undefined by the legislature. As this Court has\r\nexplained, \"The tax imposed by [section 12-20-100's predecessor], therein called a\r\n'license fee,' is manifestly an excise tax, laid under the benefit theory of taxation\r\nupon the public service corporations named for the privilege of exercising their\r\ncorporate franchises and carrying on their business within the state.\" Columbia\r\n\ninterpretation of tax statutes.\" Multi-Cinema, Ltd. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 292 S.C.\r\n411, 413, 357 S.E.2d 6, 7 (1987). \"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to\r\nascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.\" Media Gen., 388 S.C. at 147,\r\n694 S.E.2d at 529 (quoting Charleston Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. State Budget & Control\r\nBd., 313 S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993)) (internal quotations omitted). \"Under\r\nthe plain meaning rule, it is not the province of the court to change the meaning of\r\na clear and unambiguous statute.\" S.C.

Serv.\r\nComm'n, 388 S.C. 486, 491, 697 S.E.2d 587, 590 (2010). \"Where the statute's\r\nlanguage is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear, definite meaning, the rules of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRy., Gas, & Elec. Co. v. Carter, 127 S.C. 473, 121 S.E. 377 (1924). With regard to\r\ntelephone companies, the earliest laws were \"designed to accommodate the original\r\ntechnology, which required the use of land rights-of-way to place telephone poles\r\nand run telephone lines.\" William J. Quirk & Fred A. Walters, A Constitutional\r\nand Statutory History of the Telephone Business in South Carolina, 51 S.C. L.\r\nRev. 290, 293 (2000). States granted franchises over public and private lands to\r\nconstruct and operate telephone businesses and \"local governments could not\r\nexclude a telephone company, but they could enforce normal police power\r\nregulation over the industry.\" Id. We note that telephone companies have\r\nhistorically been regulated by a state agency, now the Public Service Commission,\r\nand have been given the power of eminent domain. See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 58-9-\r\n2020 to -2030 (2011); see also Quirk, supra, at 377 (\"The special taxes, at times,\r\nwere justified as a return for the special rights and privileges the state and localities\r\nhad granted, such as the power of eminent domain and the right to use the public\r\nrights-of-way.\"). Petitioners have none of the trappings of a public utility that\r\nfurther the purpose of the heightened license fee. Petitioners are involved in the\r\ncellular services market, which is a highly competitive arena rather than a\r\nmonopoly. Moreover, Petitioners, unlike a landline telephone company, do not\r\nhave the power of eminent domain nor do they make use of public property or\r\nrights-of-way; rather, Petitioners own or lease private property to transmit their\r\nwireless intelligence. Thus, while it is arguable that the heightened license fee\r\ndoes not translate to wireless communication service companies that are not\r\ngranted special privileges by the State, the absence of a statutory definition for\r\n\"telephone company\" leaves the matter in doubt.\r\n\nstatutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another\r\nmeaning.\" Id. Like the court of appeals, we do not construe section 12-20-100 to\r\nhave the plain meaning attributed to it by the ALC.\r\n\r\nPetitioners next seize on the ALC's alternative finding that the term \"telephone\r\ncompany\" is ambiguous. Petitioners point to the court of appeals'\r\nacknowledgement that application of section 12-20-100 to Petitioners was not\r\n\"absolutely clear as a matter of law.\" In this regard, Petitioners contend the court\r\nof appeals erred in failing to construe any ambiguity in the tax statute against\r\nDOR. It necessarily follows, according to Petitioners, that such ambiguity must be\r\nconstrued in the taxpayers' favor. We agree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, a court must apply the rules of statutory interpretation to resolve the\r\nambiguity and discover the intent of the legislature. Kennedy v. S.C. Ret. Sys., 345\r\nS.C. 339, 348, 549 S.E.2d 243, 247 (2001). However, \"[i]n the enforcement of tax\r\nstatutes, the taxpayer should receive the benefit in cases of doubt.\" S.C. Nat'l Bank\r\nv. S.C.

Tax Comm'n, 182 S.C. 72, 188 S.E. 508 (1936)).\r\n\"[W]here the language relied upon to bring a particular person within a tax law is\r\nambiguous or is reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that will exclude such\r\nperson, then the person will be excluded, any substantial doubt being resolved in\r\nhis favor.\" Cooper River Bridge, Inc, 182 S.C. at 76, 188 S.E. at 509-510; see also\r\nSCANA Corp. v.

The existence of an ambiguity in section 12-20-100 raises\r\nsubstantial doubt regarding the section's application to Petitioners.

(RFT)\r\nbrought this action against respondents Tinsley & Adams, L.L.P. and attorney\r\nWelborn D. Adams (collectively, Law Firm) based on their legal representation of\r\nRFT during the closing of its purchase of two real estate investment properties in\r\nGreenwood County. RFT alleged claims for (1) professional negligence (legal\r\nmalpractice), (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) violation of the South Carolina\r\nUnfair Trade Practices Act1 (UTPA), and (4) aiding and abetting a securities\r\n\r\n1   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 39-5-10 to -560 (1985 & Supp. 2011).\r\n\nviolation in contravention of the South Carolina Uniform Securities Act of 2005\r\n(SCUSA).2 The trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of Law Firm on\r\nRFT's causes of action regarding the UTPA and SCUSA, and it merged RFT's\r\nbreach of fiduciary claim with its legal malpractice claim. The jury returned a\r\nverdict in favor of Law Firm on RFT's remaining claim for legal malpractice. RFT\r\nappealed, and this Court certified the case from the Court of Appeals for its review\r\npursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. We affirm.\r\n\r\nI.       FACTS\r\n\r\n      RFT is a limited liability company, with David Roatch (Roatch) as its\r\nmanaging member. This action arises out of RFT's purchase of two parcels of\r\nproperty in a residential community near Lake Greenwood known as Planters Row\r\nat Palmetto Crossing.\r\n\r\n      Planters Row was developed by Lake Greenwood Developers, L.L.C.\r\n(Developer), which was managed by William Gilbert (Gilbert). The subdivision\r\nhad 65 lots, and in order to generate sales activity, Developer initially offered\r\n\"discounts\" of from five to ten percent of the purchase price to some buyers, as\r\nwell as buy-back options in which it agreed to repurchase the lots. The repurchase\r\noption was to be exercised within a specified timeframe at a set price that exceeded\r\nthe purchase price.\r\n\r\n       On September 25, 2007, RFT entered into agreements to purchase lots 28\r\nand 31 in Planters Row from Developer, for a total purchase price of $570,000\r\n($290,000 for lot 28 and $280,000 for lot 31). At the time of the sales agreements\r\nwith RFT, Developer did not own lots 28 and 31. Developer had previously sold\r\nlot 28 to Christopher and Susan Grimshaw and had sold lot 31 to Douglas\r\nRobertson.\r\n\r\n      In conjunction with these sales to the Grimshaws and Robertson, Developer\r\nhad executed contemporaneous agreements to buy back the lots within a specified\r\ntime period, and the Grimshaws and Robertson had notified Developer that they\r\nwished to exercise their options to sell their properties back to Developer.\r\nDeveloper, however, advised the buyers shortly before the scheduled closings that\r\n\r\n\r\n2    S.C. Code Ann. §§ 35-1-101 to -703 (1987 & Supp. 2011).\r\n\nit did not have the funds to repurchase the properties, and it negotiated an\r\nextension of time.\r\n\r\n       Meanwhile, on October 30, 2007, RFT and Developer signed a buy-back\r\nagreement regarding lots 28 and 31 in conjunction with RFT's purchase of the two\r\nlots. RFT had retained Joe Maddox, a Spartanburg attorney, to review the\r\nagreements concerning the purchase of the lots and the buy-back. Maddox\r\nnegotiated directly with Gilbert and, at the suggestion of Maddox, RFT\r\nadditionally obtained a second mortgage on the 21 unsold lots in the subdivision in\r\norder to secure payment in the event RFT exercised its rights under the buy-back\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n       Law Firm handled the majority of the real estate closings for Developer, and\r\nthe closings were usually the responsibility of attorney Welborn D. Adams\r\n(Adams). Adams was the closing attorney for the transaction with RFT. Adams\r\ncoordinated the scheduling of the closings in order to accomplish the repurchases\r\nof the two lots from the prior owners and the sale to RFT. RFT's contract for legal\r\nservices with Law Firm stated Law Firm was being retained solely to perform the\r\nministerial acts associated with the closing:\r\n\r\n      The undersigned acknowledge that they have not retained the law firm\r\n      to negotiate the terms of their contract nor are they relying on the law\r\n      firm to provide substantive advice about how or whether to proceed\r\n      with this transaction. Rather, the undersigned acknowledge that the\r\n      law firm has been retained to close the transaction, prepare a deed of\r\n      conveyance and perform the ministerial act[s] associated with real\r\n      estate closings.\r\n\r\n     The closing with RFT took place on October 30, 2007.3 Thereafter,\r\nDeveloper allegedly did not have sufficient capital to complete the amenities in the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n3  At the closing, Adams provided Roatch a letter dated October 30, 2007 advising\r\nthat he had examined the real estate records of Greenwood County for a period of\r\n40 years with reference to lots 28 and 31 and that he was \"of the opinion that RFT\r\n. . . will acquire a good and marketable title in fee simple,\" subject to (1) proper\r\nexecution of a deed from Douglas W. Robertson vesting fee simple title in lot 31 to\r\n\n        RFT filed a complaint against Law Firm on October 20, 2008, in which RFT\r\nasserted claims for legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of\r\nthe UTPA and SCUSA. At trial, RFT's claims centered on its allegations that it\r\nwas unaware of the status of the lots, that Law Firm engaged in deceptive acts\r\nregarding the true owners of the property, and that it suffered damages because its\r\ninvestment properties had a markedly lower value than anticipated.4 Specifically,\r\nRFT alleged it was unaware Developer did not own the two lots when it contracted\r\nto sell them to RFT. Further, RFT claimed it did not know that the lot owners, the\r\nGrimshaws and Robinson, exercised their rights under buy-back agreements, and\r\nthat Developer was financially unable to perform. RFT maintained Law Firm\r\nassisted Developer in selling the two lots to RFT as a \"flip transaction,\" in which\r\nthe money Developer received from RFT from the sale of the lots would be used to\r\nsimultaneously close the repurchase from the Grimshaws and Robinson and enable\r\nDeveloper to deed the two lots to RFT.5 RFT asserts none of these facts regarding\r\nthe simultaneous closing, the \"flip transaction,\" or the uses of RFT's funds were\r\ndisclosed to RFT.\r\n\r\n       At the close of all the evidence, the trial court \"merged\" RFT's breach of\r\nfiduciary duty claim into its claim for legal malpractice and granted Law Firm's\r\nmotions for a directed verdict on RFT's UTPA and SCUSA claims. Thus, only the\r\n\r\nDeveloper, (2) proper execution of a deed from Christopher W. and Susan M.\r\nGrimshaw vesting title in lot 28 to Developer, (3) proper execution of a deed from\r\nDeveloper vesting title to the property to RFT, and (4) the payment of county taxes\r\ndue on lots 28 and 31. According to Roatch, he did not read this letter at the\r\nclosing as he was given only the documents that required his signature at that time.\r\n4 RFT obtained appraisals of the lots in May 2010, in which it was indicated that\r\nlot 28 then had an estimated value of $55,500 and lot 31 had an estimated value of\r\n$54,000. Roatch testified that at the time of trial, he was of the opinion the lots\r\nwere only worth around $25,000 each, as lots of comparable size in the\r\ndevelopment had sold for that amount at foreclosure.\r\n5 See In re Barbare, 360 S.C. 560, 602 S.E.2d 382 (2004) (describing flip\r\ntransactions and finding the closing attorney acted improperly in furnishing\r\ninaccurate information on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements, which misled lenders\r\nregarding the underlying financial transaction, and that the buyer, seller, and others\r\nmust have accurate records).\r\n\nclaim of legal malpractice went to the jury, which returned a verdict in favor of\r\nLaw Firm. The trial court denied RFT's post-trial motions.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, RFT contends the trial court erred in (1) failing to grant its\r\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or a new trial on the\r\nissue whether Law Firm engaged in malpractice by representing both RFT and the\r\nseller at the closing since there was an unwaivable conflict of interest; (2) failing to\r\ngrant its motion for JNOV or a new trial on the issue whether Law Firm engaged in\r\nmalpractice by failing to disclose materials facts, submitting false and misleading\r\ndocuments, and/or arranging the closing as an unlawful \"flip transaction\"; (3)\r\nfailing to charge the jury on breach of fiduciary duty and merging this cause of\r\naction with its first cause of action for legal malpractice; (4) directing a verdict in\r\nfavor of Law Firm on RFT's UTPA claim; and (5) directing a verdict in favor of\r\nLaw Firm on RFT's claim for aiding and abetting a SCUSA violation.\r\n\r\nII.   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.    Legal Malpractice Claim\r\n\r\n        RFT first contends the trial court erred in denying its motion for a JNOV on\r\nits claim of legal malpractice because Law Firm committed malpractice as a matter\r\nof law. Alternatively, RFT argues the trial court erred in denying its request for a\r\nnew trial on this claim.\r\n\r\n      RFT asserts Law Firm committed legal malpractice, as a matter of law, in\r\ntwo ways. First, by representing both RFT and Developer at the closing, Law Firm\r\ncommitted legal malpractice because there was an unwaivable conflict of interest.\r\nSecond, Law Firm committed legal malpractice by failing to disclose material\r\ninformation to RFT, providing false and misleading documents to RFT, and\r\nclosing a deceptive \"flip transaction.\"\r\n\r\n      A plaintiff in a legal malpractice action must establish four elements: (1) the\r\nexistence of an attorney-client relationship, (2) a breach of duty by the attorney,\r\n(3) damage to the client, and (4) proximate causation of the client's damages by the\r\nbreach. Rydde v. Morris, 381 S.C. 643, 646, 675 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2009); Smith v.\r\nHaynsworth, Marion, McKay & Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 435 n.2, 472 S.E.2d 612,\r\n613 n.2 (1996).\r\n\n       A party making a motion for a directed verdict must state the specific\r\ngrounds relied upon therefor, and the trial court may grant the motion when the\r\ncase presents only issues of law. Rule 50(a), SCRCP. If the motion is denied, the\r\nparty may thereafter move for a JNOV in order to have the verdict and judgment\r\nset aside and a judgment entered in accordance with the party's directed verdict\r\nmotion. Rule 50(b), SCRCP. A motion for a new trial may be joined with the\r\nJNOV motion or prayed for in the alternative. Id.\r\n\r\n       \"When a party fails to renew a motion for a directed verdict at the close of\r\nall evidence, he waives his right to move for JNOV.\" Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1,\r\n20, 640 S.E.2d 486, 496 (Ct. App. 2006). Moreover, only the grounds raised in the\r\ndirected verdict motion may properly be reasserted in a JNOV motion. In re\r\nMcCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001); Gov't Emps. Ins. Co. v. Mackey,\r\n260 S.C. 306, 195 S.E.2d 830 (1973). A motion for a JNOV is merely a renewal of\r\nthe directed verdict motion. Wright, 372 S.C. at 20, 640 S.E.2d at 496.\r\n\r\n      When reviewing the trial court's ruling on a motion for a directed verdict or\r\na JNOV, this Court must apply the same standard as the trial court by viewing the\r\nevidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party. Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772\r\n(2004). The trial court must deny a motion for a directed verdict or JNOV if the\r\nevidence yields more than one reasonable inference or its inference is in doubt.\r\nStrange v. S.C. Dep't of Highways & Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 445 S.E.2d 439\r\n(1994). Moreover, \"[a] motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable\r\njury could have reached the challenged verdict.\" Gastineau v. Murphy, 331 S.C.\r\n565, 568, 503 S.E.2d 712, 713 (1998). An appellate court will reverse the trial\r\ncourt's ruling only if no evidence supports the ruling below. Welch v. Epstein, 342\r\nS.C. 279, 536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000). In deciding such motions, neither the\r\ntrial court nor the appellate court has the authority to decide credibility issues or to\r\nresolve conflicts in the testimony or the evidence. Id. at 300, 536 S.E.2d at 419.\r\n\r\n       We find RFT's argument that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\r\non its claim for legal malpractice to be without merit. As noted above, a motion\r\nfor JNOV must be based on the same grounds as those raised in a motion for a\r\ndirected verdict motion made at the close of all the evidence.\r\n\n       In reviewing the record, as an initial matter we agree with Law Firm that\r\nRFT did not move for a directed verdict on the legal malpractice claim based on\r\nthe second ground it now urges on appeal, i.e., that this was an improper flip\r\ntransaction and Law Firm gave misleading information while failing to make\r\nrequired disclosures. Thus, this argument is not properly before the Court. See\r\nRoland v. Palmetto Hills, 308 S.C. 283, 286 & 287 n.2, 417 S.E.2d 626, 628 & n.2\r\n(Ct. App. 1992) (stating \"[a] motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is a\r\nrenewal of the directed verdict motion and cannot raise grounds beyond those\r\nraised in the directed verdict\" motion, and additionally noting that the burden was\r\non the appellant to furnish a sufficient record on appeal to allow review).\r\n\r\n       As to RFT's first ground concerning whether there was an unwaivable\r\nconflict as a matter of law, RFT and Law Firm initially agreed this issue concerned\r\na question of law, but then later during the parties' discussion Law Firm stated it\r\nhad found authority now indicating that the matter presented a question of fact, and\r\nRFT did not contest this authority. In its order denying RFT's post-trial motion for\r\na JNOV, the trial court specifically found that the parties had agreed at trial that the\r\nlegal malpractice claim involved questions of fact that required submission of the\r\nclaim to a jury. There is nothing in the excerpt of this discussion in the record that\r\nis inconsistent with the trial court's finding. Thus, RFT may not now complain that\r\nit was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. See generally Shearer v.\r\nDeShon, 240 S.C. 472, 484, 126 S.E.2d 514, 520 (1962) (\"Ordinarily, one cannot\r\ncomplain of an error which his own conduct has induced.\"). Moreover, the\r\nexistence of an unwaivable conflict would not establish all of the remaining\r\nelements of the legal malpractice claim as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n       To the extent RFT further argues on appeal that the trial court erred in\r\ndenying its post-trial motion for a new trial on its legal malpractice claim, RFT has\r\nshown no error. RFT re-asserts the same grounds in its new trial request as for the\r\nJNOV and also asserts the trial court should have granted a new trial pursuant to\r\nthe thirteenth juror doctrine.6\r\n\r\n       The trial court denied RFT's request for a new trial on the legal malpractice\r\naction without specifying its grounds. See Miller v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., 95\r\nS.C. 471, 79 S.E. 645 (1913) (stating where an order denying a new trial motion\r\n\r\n6  RFT does not argue the other grounds it raised in its post-trial motion for a new\r\ntrial. Therefore, they are not before this Court.\r\n\ndoes not specify the grounds for the decision, it will be affirmed on appeal if the\r\nrecord presents any grounds upon which the motion could have been properly\r\nrefused).\r\n\r\n       In denying the JNOV on this claim, however, the trial court noted, inter alia,\r\nthat the parties had agreed there were questions of fact regarding the legal\r\nmalpractice claim and that the jury had properly considered the issue and reached a\r\nunanimous verdict. Since the trial court found there were questions of fact as to\r\nthis claim and that RFT had not challenged this point, RFT has shown no error in\r\nthe trial court's failure to grant its new trial motion based on the grounds asserted in\r\nits request for a JNOV and its allegation that the evidence does not support the\r\nverdict. See McEntire v. Mooregard Exterminating Servs., Inc., 353 S.C. 629, 632,\r\n578 S.E.2d 746, 747 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating a directed verdict motion is a\r\nprerequisite to a motion for JNOV or a new trial motion on the ground the\r\nevidence does not support the verdict).\r\n\r\n       As for RFT's new trial motion made pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine,\r\nthe thirteenth juror doctrine is a vehicle by which the trial court may take its own\r\nview of the evidence and grant a new trial if it disagrees with the jury's verdict.\r\nFolkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 387 S.E.2d 265 (1990). This is also called granting\r\na new trial upon the facts, and the judge is not required to give the reasons for its\r\nruling. Id. at 254, 387 S.E.2d at 267. The effect is the same as if the jury had\r\nfailed to reach a verdict. Id. A trial court's order granting or denying a new trial\r\nupon the facts will not be disturbed unless the decision is wholly unsupported by\r\nthe evidence or the conclusion reached is controlled by an error of law. Id. at 254-\r\n55, 387 S.E.2d at 267.\r\n\r\n       \"The granting of a new trial upon the facts is not the equivalent of granting a\r\ndirected verdict.\" McEntire, 353 S.C. at 632, 578 S.E.2d at 748. The question of\r\nwhether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict, a question of law, is\r\ndistinguishable from the question of whether a fair preponderance of the evidence\r\nsupports a verdict, which is a matter involving the exercise of discretion. Id. at\r\n632-33, 578 S.E.2d at 748. Stated another way, a party's evidence might make a\r\ncase one for the jury, but the evidence might be so outweighed by the\r\ncountervailing evidence that, in the exercise of its discretion, a trial court could\r\nchoose to set aside the verdict under the thirteenth juror doctrine. Id. at 633, 578\r\nS.E.2d at 748 (citing Russell v. Pilger, 37 A.2d 403, 414 (Vt. 1944)).\r\n\n        We hold RFT has shown no abuse of discretion. The scope of representation\r\noffered by Law Firm was strictly limited in the retainer agreement Law Firm had\r\nwith RFT, and RFT's own real estate agent had knowledge of the October 30th title\r\nletter outlining the status of the properties. Thus, a jury could have properly found\r\nthere was no deceitful action by Law Firm.\r\n\r\n        One of the most significant areas of conflict was the competing experts\r\noffered by RFT and Law Firm as to whether Law Firm had met the requisite\r\nstandard of care in the legal malpractice claim. Although RFT introduced the\r\ntestimony of its expert in support of its claim that Law Firm had breached the\r\nrequisite standard of care in handling the closing, Law Firm countered with its own\r\nexpert, an attorney who had practiced as both a closing attorney and a trial attorney\r\nlitigating real estate matters for over thirty years. Law Firm's expert testified that,\r\nin his experience, most residential property closings were handled by only one\r\nlawyer. The expert also examined the retainer agreement that was executed by the\r\nparties in this case and stated it was his professional opinion that the standard of\r\ncare for a real estate attorney had been met and that the document signed by RFT\r\nlimited the scope of Law Firm's representation and its obligation to RFT (to deliver\r\nmarketable title). Consequently, we hold RFT has failed to establish the trial court\r\nabused its discretion in denying its new trial motion.\r\n\r\nB.    Remaining Claims\r\n\r\n       Having upheld the jury's determination that RFT failed to establish its claim\r\nof legal malpractice, we find RFT's remaining claims are precluded as a matter of\r\nlaw under the circumstances present here.\r\n\r\n      (1) Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\n\r\n      RFT contends the trial court erred in \"merging\" its second cause of action\r\nfor breach of fiduciary duty with its first cause of action for legal malpractice.\r\nRFT asserts the trial court erroneously determined the breach of fiduciary claim\r\nwas redundant.\r\n\r\n       \"A confidential or fiduciary relationship exists when one imposes a special\r\nconfidence in another, so that the latter, in equity and good conscience is bound to\r\nact in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one imposing the\r\nconfidence.\" Davis v. Greenwood Sch. Dist. 50, 365 S.C. 629, 635, 620 S.E.2d 65,\r\n\n68 (2005). To establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, the plaintiff must\r\nprove (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty, (2) a breach of that duty owed to the\r\nplaintiff by the defendant, and (3) damages proximately resulting from the\r\nwrongful conduct of the defendant. See generally Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241,\r\n599 S.E.2d 467 (Ct. App. 2004) (discussing the elements comprising a breach of\r\nfiduciary duty claim). \"Our courts have long recognized that an attorney-client\r\nrelationship is, by its very nature, a fiduciary relationship.\" Spence v. Wingate, 395\r\nS.C. 148, 158, 716 S.E.2d 920, 926 (2011).\r\n\r\n       A claim for breach of fiduciary duty, as a general matter, is distinguishable\r\nfrom a claim for legal malpractice because it can arise in contexts other than one\r\ninvolving an attorney-client relationship. See, e.g., In re Estate of Cumbee, 333\r\nS.C. 664, 511 S.E.2d 390 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding a fiduciary relationship existed\r\nwhere a son held his mother's power of attorney and managed all of her finances).\r\nIn the current matter, however, RFT's claim for breach of fiduciary duty arose out\r\nof the duty inherent in the attorney-client relationship and it arose out of the same\r\nfactual allegations. Thus, RFT's claim for legal malpractice necessarily\r\nencompassed a breach of the fiduciary duty an attorney has to his or her client.\r\nRFT specifically acknowledged at trial that it could not provide any circumstances\r\ndifferentiating the two claims.\r\n\r\n       Although RFT now argues a breach of fiduciary claim could be\r\ndistinguishable from legal malpractice, RFT does not set forth any specific facts\r\nthat demonstrate its breach of fiduciary duty claim is distinguishable because it\r\narises out of a duty other than one created by the attorney-client relationship or\r\nbecause it is based on different material facts.7 Consequently, we hold the breach\r\n\r\n\r\n7 RFT argues for the first time on appeal that one difference between its two\r\nclaims was that malpractice normally requires expert testimony on the attorney's\r\nstandard of care and breach, while the breach of fiduciary duty claim requires no\r\nexpert testimony, so the jury could have not believed RFT's experts and still found\r\nfor it on a breach of fiduciary duty claim. It additionally argues evidence of a\r\nviolation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, such as was allegedly present here,\r\ncould support a verdict for legal malpractice, but not necessarily constitute\r\nevidence of a breach of fiduciary duty. These arguments were not made at the time\r\nof the trial court's ruling and are not properly reviewable here. See Wilder Corp. v.\r\nWilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue\r\n\nof fiduciary duty claim is duplicative. Moreover, it is clear RFT could not have\r\nprevailed on its breach of fiduciary duty claim since the jury rejected RFT's factual\r\nallegations when it returned a verdict in favor of Law Firm on the allegation of\r\nlegal malpractice. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court's ruling in this\r\nregard. See Aller v. Law Office of Carole C. Schriefer, 140 P.3d 23 (Colo. App.\r\n2005) (stating when a legal malpractice claim and a breach of fiduciary duty claim\r\narise from the same material facts, the breach of fiduciary duty claim should be\r\ndismissed as duplicative); Oehlerich v. Llewellyn, 647 S.E.2d 399 (Ga. Ct. App.\r\n2007) (holding the plaintiff's claim for legal malpractice was based on the fiduciary\r\nattorney-client relationship and the breach of fiduciary duty claim was, therefore,\r\nduplicative since it was based on allegations that the attorney failed to fully\r\ninvestigate the claims and failed to properly advise the plaintiff, all of which called\r\ninto question the degree of professional skill exercised by the attorney); cf. Se.\r\nHous. Found. v. Smith, 380 S.C. 621, 647 n.18, 670 S.E.2d 680, 694 n.18 (Ct. App.\r\n2008) (noting that the dismissal of a party's legal malpractice claim would\r\nextinguish the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action in one action, but whether\r\nthe defendant breached a fiduciary duty in other capacities could be a jury\r\nquestion).\r\n\r\n      (2) UTPA\r\n\r\n      RFT next argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict to Law\r\nFirm on its UTPA claim on the basis the UTPA does not apply to the legal\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n       The UTPA declares \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or\r\ndeceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commence are . . .\r\nunlawful.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-20(a) (1985). \"To recover in an action under\r\nthe UTPA, the plaintiff must show: (1) the defendant engaged in an unfair or\r\ndeceptive act in the conduct of trade or commerce; (2) the unfair or deceptive act\r\naffected [the] public interest; and (3) the plaintiff suffered monetary or property\r\nloss as a result of the defendant's unfair or deceptive act(s).\" Wright v. Craft, 372\r\nS.C. 1, 23, 640 S.E.2d 486, 498 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled\r\nupon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\").\r\n\n      The UTPA exempts certain practices and transactions from coverage; the\r\nburden of proving an exemption is upon the party claiming the exemption. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 39-5-40 (1985 & Supp. 2011). The trial court found the exemption\r\nfor matters subject to regulatory authority was applicable here. This exemption\r\nprovides the UTPA does not apply to \"[a]ctions or transactions permitted under\r\nlaws administered by any regulatory body or officer acting under statutory\r\nauthority of this State or the United States or actions or transactions permitted by\r\nany other South Carolina State law.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-40(a) (1985).\r\n\r\n       This Court has \"interpreted this exemption to exclude from the UTPA those\r\nactions or transactions which are allowed or authorized by a regulatory agency or\r\nother statutes.\" Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 218, 479 S.E.2d 35, 44 (1996)\r\n(citing Ward v. Dick Dyer & Assocs., 304 S.C. 152, 403 S.E.2d 310 (1991)). In\r\nWard, the Court observed the purpose of the exemption is to avoid subjecting a\r\nbusiness to a lawsuit for doing something required by law or allowed by a statute\r\nor a regulation; it is intended to avoid a conflict between laws, not to exclude\r\ncoverage for every act that is authorized or regulated by another statute or agency,\r\nas virtually every activity is regulated to some degree. Ward, 304 S.C. at 156, 403\r\nS.E.2d at 312 (citing Skinner v. Steele, 730 S.W.2d 335, 337 (Tenn. Ct. App.\r\n1987)).We find the trial court erred in relying upon the regulated industries\r\nexception. See S.C.

Springs Mortgage\r\nCorp., 307 S.C. 283, 285, 414 S.E.2d 784, 786 (Ct. App. 1991) (\"There is no\r\nquestion but what legal services come within the definition of this [UTPA]\r\nstatute.\"), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 310 S.C. 514, 426 S.E.2d 304 (1993) (finding\r\nUTPA claim failed on the basis no unfair act was alleged); see also Pepper v.\r\nRouth Crabtree, APC, 219 P.3d 1017, 1024-25 (Alaska 2009) (holding the legal\r\nprofession is not exempt from UTPA coverage simply because a state supreme\r\ncourt has the authority to discipline attorneys for misconduct as the Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure and the Rules of Professional Conduct are not the type of ongoing,\r\ncareful regulation required to trigger an exemption; the court concluded \"that the\r\nattorney disciplinary system and consumer protection laws can coexist as long as\r\n\nthe legislature does not purport to take away this court's exclusive power to admit,\r\nsuspend, discipline, or disbar\" attorneys).\r\n\r\n       Despite the trial court's error in finding the UTPA is not available against the\r\nlegal profession, RFT has shown no reversible error in this regard. Because RFT\r\nalleged the same facts for its UTPA claim as in the legal malpractice claim, i.e., the\r\ndeceptive acts of Law Firm, which the jury has already rejected, RFT has not\r\nshown it could have established all of the necessary elements of this claim. Cf.\r\nHennes v. Shaw, 397 S.C. 391, 725 S.E.2d 501 (Ct. App. 2012) (holding even if\r\nthe circuit court erred in directing a verdict on the plaintiff's UTPA claim based on\r\nthe regulated industries exemption in the UTPA, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate\r\nsufficient evidence on all of the elements of the claim, in particular, the plaintiff\r\nfailed to demonstrate the defendant's actions adversely affected the public interest;\r\nthus, the circuit court's grant of a directed verdict on this claim was affirmed).\r\n\r\n      (3) SCUSA\r\n\r\n       RFT's challenge to the trial court's grant of a directed verdict on its claim for\r\naiding and abetting a securities violation similarly fails. In its complaint, RFT\r\nalleged its purchase of two investment lots with accompanying buy-back\r\nagreements constituted a \"security\" for purposes of the South Carolina Uniform\r\nSecurities Act of 2005. RFT further alleged Law Firm was civilly liable for\r\ndamages under S.C. Code Ann. § 35-1-509 (Supp. 2011) for not disclosing that the\r\ntwo lots were subject to pre-existing buy-back agreements with prior owners and\r\nthat Developer did not actually own the two lots at the time it arranged for the sale\r\nto RFT. RFT also alleged Law Firm did not exercise the reasonable due care owed\r\nto RFT as an investor because it allowed Developer's untruths about the financial\r\nstability of Planters Row, as expressed by William Gilbert, to go undiscovered.\r\n\r\n       The trial court granted Law Firm's motion for a directed verdict on its claim\r\nfor aiding and abetting a SCUSA violation on the basis the transaction did not\r\ninvolve a security. See S.C. Code Ann. § 35-1-102(29) (Supp. 2011) (The South\r\nCarolina Uniform Securities Act of 2005 defines a \"security\" to mean, inter alia,\r\n\"any . . . evidence of indebtedness; certificate of interest or participation in a profit-\r\nsharing agreement; . . . investment contract; . . . or, in general, an interest or\r\ninstrument commonly known as a 'security' . . . .\").\r\n\n       Even assuming, without deciding, that the transaction qualified as a security,\r\nthe securities claim was based on the same factual allegations that were ultimately\r\nrejected by the jury when it returned a verdict in favor of Law Firm on the legal\r\nmalpractice claim. In addition, RFT absolved Law Firm of any potential liability\r\nresulting from an allegation of aiding and abetting a securities violation when RFT\r\nsigned the retainer agreement with Law Firm that expressly limited the scope of its\r\nrepresentation. In that agreement, RFT acknowledged that it was retaining Law\r\nFirm to close the transaction, prepare a deed of conveyance, and perform\r\nministerial acts associated with the closing. RFT further acknowledged that it had\r\nnot retained Law Firm to negotiate the contract and that it was not relying on Law\r\nFirm to provide substantive advice about the transaction. Consequently, there\r\ncould be no liability, so we find no error in the granting of a directed verdict on\r\nthis claim.\r\n\r\nIII.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Charlie\r\n            Tex Davis, Jr., Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel,\r\n            both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n            John P. Freeman, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent\r\n(Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of a public reprimand or definite suspension not to exceed thirty\r\n(30) days. Respondent further agrees to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\nProgram Ethics School within twelve (12) months of the imposition of a sanction.\r\nWe accept the Agreement and issue a public reprimand. In addition, respondent\r\nshall complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School within twelve\r\n(12) months of the date of this opinion. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement,\r\nare as follows.\r\n\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\n                                      Matter I\r\n\r\nIn 2004, respondent was retained to handle a refinance closing for Complainant A\r\nand his business partner. Subsequent to the closing, respondent received a\r\ntelephone call from the lender requesting Complainant A sign an assignment of\r\nrents form and record it with the mortgage.\r\n\r\nRespondent represents he contacted Complainant A on at least two occasions to\r\nsign the document requested by the lender. Complainant A failed to respond to\r\nrespondent and the document was not signed.\r\n\r\nRespondent's closing file was placed in \"the post-closing cabinet\" at respondent's\r\noffice, as though the mortgage had been recorded. In fact, the mortgage had not\r\nbeen recorded.\r\n\r\nApproximately ten (10) months later, after receiving a call from Complainant A\r\nabout a potential problem with the closing, respondent discovered the mortgage\r\nhad never been recorded. Respondent renewed his attempts to have Complainant\r\nA sign the assignment of rents form, but his attempts were of no avail. Eventually,\r\nrespondent recorded the mortgage without the assignment form.\r\n\r\nComplainant A maintained that respondent owed him damages for the delay in the\r\nrecording of the mortgage. Respondent reported the matter to his malpractice\r\ncarrier.\r\n\r\nRespondent admits he failed to respond to ODC in a timely manner about this\r\nmatter.                              Matter II\r\n\r\nComplainant B hired respondent to represent her in a civil action. At some point,\r\nComplainant B terminated the attorney/client relationship and requested\r\nrespondent provide a copy of her client file.\r\n\r\nOn September 9, 2005, Complainant B's daughter picked up the client file on her\r\nmother's behalf. The daughter indicated that certain documents seemed to be\r\n\nmissing from the file. The daughter believed that respondent would communicate\r\nwith her about the allegedly missing documents.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months went by without any further response from respondent\r\nor his staff. Complainant B elicited the assistance of the Client Assistance\r\nProgram with the South Carolina Bar in an attempt to mediate the situation with\r\nrespondent.\r\n\r\nRespondent acknowledges that he failed to punctually communicate with his client.\r\nHe also admits he failed to respond in a timely manner to ODC about this matter.\r\n\r\n                                    Matter III\r\n\r\nRespondent handled a real estate closing for Complainant C in 2000 and, again, in\r\n2001, when Complainant C refinanced his mortgage. In January 2006,\r\nComplainant C attempted to again refinance his mortgage. Complainant C\r\nengaged the services of another attorney. During this process, the other attorney\r\ndiscovered a problem with the title requiring the deed(s) from 2000 and 2001 to be\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nAt the end of January 2006, Complainant C contacted respondent's office. He\r\nspoke with respondent's paralegal who indicated respondent would correct the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nRespondent acknowledges he was not as diligent as he should have been in\r\ncorrecting this matter. Further, respondent acknowledges he failed to respond to\r\nODC about this matter in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n                                    Matter IV\r\n\r\nRespondent represented the plaintiff in a civil action. However, respondent\r\nbelieved that his representation was limited to writing and filing a single\r\nmemorandum on plaintiff's behalf with the circuit court.\r\n\r\nRespondent's client filed a Notice of Appeal with the South Carolina Court of\r\nAppeals. By letter dated July 22, 2005, the Clerk of the South Carolina Court of\r\nAppeals notified respondent that, according to the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules, the trial attorney is deemed to be the attorney of record on appeal until he\r\nhas been relieved by the Court and, if respondent was choosing not to represent his\r\nclient, then he must petition the Court to be relieved as required by Court Rules.\r\n\nThe Clerk requested the status of respondent's representation within ten (10) days.\r\nRespondent failed to respond to the request.\r\n\r\nBy letter dated August 15, 2005, the Clerk informed respondent that since the\r\nCourt had not received any response from respondent to the July 22 letter, the\r\nCourt would continue to list respondent as counsel for the plaintiff. The Clerk\r\ninformed respondent that he was to notify the Court when he had received the\r\ntranscript and timelines would be set accordingly.\r\n\r\nBy letter dated November 8, 2005, the Clerk informed respondent that, according\r\nto its information, the time for the transcript to be delivered had expired and that\r\nno extension had been requested. The Clerk informed respondent that the Court\r\nwished to be advised of the status of the transcript within ten (10) days or the\r\nappeal might be dismissed. Respondent failed to respond to this request.\r\n\r\nBy letter dated April 21, 2006, the Clerk informed respondent that the Court had\r\nnot received the information it had requested in the November 8, 2005, letter.\r\nOnce again, the Clerk reiterated that it was necessary for respondent to notify the\r\nCourt of the status of the transcript within ten (10) days. The Clerk notified\r\nrespondent that failure to comply with the Court's instruction would result in\r\nfurther action by the Court. Respondent failed to respond to this letter.\r\n\r\nBy letter dated June 23, 2006, the Clerk reminded respondent that he was still\r\nlisted as counsel for the plaintiff. The Clerk informed respondent that the Court\r\nhad not received a response from him regarding its previous letters. The Clerk\r\nadvised respondent that he was to provide a response to the letter within ten (10)\r\ndays. Respondent failed to respond to this letter.\r\n\r\nRespondent represents that, based on a previous telephone conversation with the\r\nClerk's office, he mistakenly believed the plaintiff's appeal had been dismissed.\r\nRespondent regrets and apologizes for the misunderstanding and his failure to\r\nrespond to the Clerk's letters. Respondent represents he filed a Motion to be\r\nRelieved as Counsel for the plaintiff and the motion was granted.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter V\r\n\r\nComplainant D retained respondent in 2003 to represent her in two separate actions\r\ninvolving her homeowner's association. Respondent acknowledges that he was not\r\ndiligent in representing Complainant D. In addition, respondent acknowledges that\r\nhe failed to communicate with Complainant D in a timely manner regarding\r\n\nrequests for information and/or updates about her cases. Respondent apologizes\r\nfor his conduct.                       Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act\r\ndiligently in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably\r\ninformed about the status of matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests\r\nfor information); Rule 1.16(c) (lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring\r\nnotice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a representation); Rule 8.1\r\n(lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to demand for information from\r\ndisciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to\r\nengage in conduct prejudicial to administration of justice). Respondent also admits\r\nhe has violated the following Rule for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate\r\nRules of Professional Conduct).     Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand. Accordingly, we\r\naccept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nRespondent shall complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School\r\nwithin twelve (12) months of the date of this order and provide certification of\r\ncompletion of the program to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct within ten (10)\r\ndays of the conclusion of the program.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27159","title":"Doe v.

Wilson, Assistant Attorney\r\n             General Jared Quante Libet, and J.

Petitioner, who was adjudicated as a juvenile for sex crimes,\r\nseeks removal of his name from the sex offender registry. We grant relief in part,\r\nholding that a juvenile \"adjudication\" is the equivalent of a \"conviction\" under S.C.\r\nCode Ann. section 24-21-940 (2007), for purposes of entitlement to seek a pardon\r\nfrom the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services\r\n(PPP). We dismiss without prejudice the balance of Petitioner's complaint.\r\n\nPetitioner was adjudicated delinquent by the family court in 2003 of criminal\r\nsexual conduct (CSC) with a minor in the second degree and two counts of lewd\r\nact upon a child under sixteen. As a result, Petitioner was required to register as a\r\nsex offender. See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-430(A), (C)(2), (C)(11) (Supp. 2011)\r\n(requiring a person adjudicated delinquent for the offenses of second-degree CSC\r\nand lewd act upon a child under sixteen to register on the sex offender registry).\r\n\r\nPetitioner seeks removal of his name from the sex offender registry, which, under\r\nSouth Carolina's statutory scheme, requires that one receive a pardon.1 It is\r\nstipulated by the State that Petitioner's request for a pardon was declined without\r\nconsideration because PPP construed section 24-21-940 as not permitting his\r\nrequest because his juvenile adjudication did not constitute a conviction. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 24-21-940(A) (\"'Pardon' means that an individual is fully pardoned\r\nfrom all the legal consequences of his crime and of his conviction . . . .\") (emphasis\r\nadded)). The State's position in this regard is manifestly without merit, for there is\r\nno evidence that the legislature intended section 24-21-940(A) to allow only adult\r\noffenders the ability to ask for a pardon.2 For purposes of section 24-21-940(A), a\r\nconviction includes a family court adjudication. Thus, Petitioner is entitled to have\r\nhis request for pardon considered by PPP. Because it would be premature to\r\nconsider the balance of Petitioner's complaint, it is dismissed without prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 We note that section 23-3-430(F)(2) contemplates an offender's removal from the\r\nsex offender registry by way of a pardon only if the pardon is based on a finding of\r\nnot guilty specifically stated in the pardon.\r\n2 Petitioner correctly asserts that the State's construction of section 24-21-940(A),\r\nif accepted, would render the statute, in conjunction with section 23-3-430,\r\nunconstitutional as an equal protection violation—that is, those convicted as an\r\nadult may seek a pardon whereas those adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile may\r\nnot. We acknowledge that the legislature has recognized the distinction between a\r\njuvenile adjudication and an adult conviction in certain statutes unrelated to pardon\r\neligibility. This distinction, consistent with longstanding policy concerning\r\njuveniles, has been implemented purposefully to shield juveniles from certain\r\nconsequences that apply to those with an adult conviction. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n63-19-1410 (Supp. 2011) (\"No adjudication by the [family] court of the status of a\r\nchild is a conviction, nor does the adjudication operate to impose civil disabilities\r\nordinarily resulting from conviction . . . .\"). Today's holding does not disrupt that\r\ndistinction in any context aside from this specific one we address here.\r\n\nDECLARATORY RELIEF GRANTED IN PART. \n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27160","title":"Mims v.

The circuit court dismissed the complaint\r\nbased on issues related to timeliness of service and the application of S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 15-3-20(B) (2005). Mims appeals. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n                                 I. FACTS\r\n\r\n      Edward, an adult, has severe mental and physical disabilities. On May\r\n29, 2007, Mims, as guardian ad litem for Edward, filed a summons and\r\ncomplaint with the Richland County Court of Common Pleas against eight\r\ndefendants.1 Mims asserted various claims arising from the mistreatment,\r\nincluding a sexual assault, which Edward allegedly endured while under the\r\ncare and supervision of the Babcock Center and the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Disabilities and Special Needs (DDSN).\r\n\r\n      It is undisputed that this complaint was never served. However, an\r\nattorney from Collins & Lacy wrote to Mims's counsel on July 5, 2007 and\r\nstated the firm was the general counsel for the Babcock Center, that they had\r\nreceived a copy of the summons and complaint filed with the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas, and that they \"will be defending [the] Babcock Center, Dr.\r\nJohnson, Ms. Bradford, Mr. Stoxen, and Ms. Slater in this action.\" Counsel\r\nstated the letter was to memorialize a phone conversation with Mims's\r\nattorney on June 29, 2007, in which it was confirmed there had been no\r\nservice of the pleading to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The eight named defendants were the Babcock Center, Inc., Judy Johnson,\r\nTonya Bradford, Craig Stoxen, Sue Slater, Stanley Butkus, Susan Bowling,\r\nand the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.\r\n\n     On May 7, 2008, almost one year later, Mims filed a summons and an\r\n\"Amended Complaint\" against five defendants: the Babcock Center, Inc.,\r\nJudy Johnson, DDSN, Kathi Lacy, and Stanley Butkus (Defendants). The\r\nnew complaint retained three of the eight original defendants (Babcock\r\nCenter, Johnson, and Butkus) while adding two new ones (DDSN and Lacy).\r\n\r\n      Mims re-alleged in the amended complaint that Edward had been\r\nphysically injured and mistreated while under the care of Defendants, and she\r\nasserted claims for the violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, and 1988;\r\nnegligent supervision; violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and\r\nthe Rehabilitation Act; and unjust enrichment. Defendants were all served a\r\nfew days later, on May 12, 2008.\r\n\r\n       Defendants filed two separate motions to dismiss the amended\r\ncomplaint on or about June 9, 2008. One motion was filed by the Babcock\r\nCenter and Johnson; the other was filed by DDSN, Lacy, and Butkus. A\r\nhearing was held on the motions on March 30, 2009, at which time the trial\r\ncourt indicated from the bench that the motions were denied. Defendants\r\nDDSN, Lacy, and Butkus filed an answer dated April 10, 2009 in response to\r\nthe amended complaint. Defendants Babcock Center and Johnson thereafter\r\nfiled their answer dated April 17, 2009.\r\n\r\n       By order filed June 4, 2009, the trial court formally denied Defendants'\r\nmotions to dismiss Mims's amended complaint. Upon Defendants' motions\r\nto alter or amend, the trial court held another hearing on September 4, 2009\r\nand thereafter granted Defendants' motions to dismiss, without prejudice, by\r\norder filed November 23, 2009. The trial court's primary finding was that\r\nMims had failed to serve her summons and complaint within 120 days of\r\nfiling as required by section 15-3-20(B) of the South Carolina Code.\r\n\r\n       In the order granting a dismissal, the trial court explained that it had\r\ninitially denied Defendants' motions to dismiss based on judicial economy, as\r\nMims could simply re-file her complaint. The trial court stated Mims had\r\nfiled her original complaint in May 2007, but did not serve it, and the\r\namended complaint was filed under the same file number, 07-CP-40-3365\r\nalmost a year later, in May 2008. The trial court concluded neither the\r\noriginal complaint nor the amended complaint was served within 120 days of\r\n\nthe filing of the action denominated 07-CP-40-3365 in May 2007; therefore,\r\nthe civil action was not commenced within 120 days in accordance with S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 15-3-20(B).\r\n\r\n      The trial court stated, \"As a result of the Plaintiff's failure to\r\naccomplish service within 120 days and commence the civil action, there was\r\nno suit in existence in which an Amended Complaint could be filed.\r\nTherefore, the filing and service of the Plaintiff's Summons and Amended\r\nComplaint in May 2008 bearing case action number 07-CP-40-3365\r\nconstituted a legal nullity.\"\r\n\r\n      The trial court additionally found dismissal of the case was warranted\r\nfor \"insufficien[c]y of process under Rule 12(b)(4) and insufficiency of\r\nservice of process under Rule 12(b)(5)\" of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure because service of the original complaint was never attempted and\r\nservice of the amended complaint was \"ineffective.\" The trial court further\r\nfound that, \"[a]s an additional result\" of Mims's failure to accomplish service\r\nwithin 120 days and to properly commence a civil action, \"subject matter and\r\npersonal jurisdiction have not properly attached, and as such this case is also\r\nbeing dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(2).\" Finally, the trial\r\ncourt found the failure to prosecute the case additionally justified dismissal of\r\nthe action under Rule 41(b), SCRCP. Mims's motion to alter or amend was\r\ndenied. Mims appeals.       II. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       On appeal, Mims asserts (1) the South Carolina General Assembly\r\nintended S.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-20 to extend the time for service of a\r\ncomplaint by 120 days after the end of the statute of limitations, as provided\r\nby Rule 3(a), SCRCP, and it does not impose additional, more restrictive\r\nrequirements for service within 120 days of filing, a process which would\r\neffectively shorten the statute of limitations; (2) equitable or statutory tolling\r\nfor persons with disabilities prevents dismissal of the complaint; (3) the\r\ncircuit court erred in relying upon Rule 41(b), SCRCP, regarding dismissal\r\nfor failure to prosecute; and (4) Rule 15(a), SCRCP allows a party to amend\r\nhis or her pleadings any time before a responsive pleading is filed without\r\nleave of court, and it does not require a plaintiff to serve the original\r\n\ncomplaint in cases where the amended complaint was filed and served before\r\nan answer to the original complaint was ever served.\r\n\r\n       In contrast, Defendants argue that, reading Rule 3(a), SCRCP and\r\nsection 15-3-20 together, to properly commence a civil action, actual service\r\nmust be accomplished in all cases within one hundred twenty days of filing\r\nthe summons and complaint. They contend that, because Mims did not serve\r\nher original or her amended summons and complaint within 120 days of\r\nfiling the original summons and complaint in May 2007, the amended\r\ncomplaint was a nullity under section 15-3-20. Therefore, the trial court\r\nproperly dismissed the action pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), (2), (4), and (5) and\r\nthe failure to prosecute under Rule 41(b).\r\n\r\n       Section 15-3-20 of the South Carolina Code governs the\r\ncommencement of actions. In 2002, the General Assembly amended the\r\nstatute to its current form, and it now provides:\r\n\r\n            (A) Civil actions may only be commenced within the\r\n      periods prescribed in this title after the cause of action has\r\n      accrued, except when, in special cases, a different limitation is\r\n      prescribed by statute.\r\n\r\n           (B) A civil action is commenced when the summons and\r\n      complaint are filed with the clerk of court if actual service is\r\n      accomplished within one hundred twenty days after filing.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-20 (2005).\r\n\r\n     In 2004, in direct response to the legislative change in section 15-3-\r\n20(B), this Court amended Rule 3(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure to read as follows:\r\n\r\n            (a) Commencement of civil action. A civil action is\r\n      commenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the\r\n      clerk of court if:\r\n\n             (1) the summons and complaint are served within the\r\n      statute of limitations in any manner prescribed by law; or\r\n\r\n            (2) if not served within the statute of limitations, actual\r\n      service must be accomplished not later than one hundred twenty\r\n      days after filing.2\r\n\r\n     As stated in the official notes to the rule, this Court amended Rule 3,\r\nSCRCP in 2004 \"to reflect the legislative intent expressed in § 15-3-20 as\r\namended by 2002 S.C. Act No. 281, § 1.\" Note to 2004 Amendment, Rule 3,\r\nSCRCP. The 2004 amendment to Rule 3 \"rewrote subsection (a), deleted\r\nsubsection (b) [\"Tolling of Statute of Limitations\"], and renumbered\r\nsubsection (c) [\"Filing of In Forma Pauperis\"] as subsection (b).\" Id.\r\n\r\n       In the current appeal, the trial court read section 15-3-20(B) to require\r\nactual service to be made within 120 days of filing in all cases. However,\r\nunder this interpretation, an action filed and served within the statute of\r\nlimitations could be deemed untimely and subject to dismissal. In amending\r\nRule 3(a), SCRCP, this Court recognized that the legislative intent in\r\namending section 15-3-20(B) in 2002 was to provide a safety net for cases\r\nwhere filing of the summons and complaint occurs near the end of the statute\r\nof limitations and service is made after the limitations period has run. The\r\nstatute and the rule, read together, provide that (1) an action is commenced\r\nupon filing the summons and complaint, if service is made within the statute\r\nof limitations, and (2) if filing but not service is accomplished within the\r\nstatute of limitations, then service must be made within 120 days of filing.\r\n\r\n       We note this differs from both (1) the trial court's and Defendants'\r\ninterpretation (that service must be made in all cases within 120 days of\r\nfiling) and (2) Mims's position (that service must be made within 120 days\r\nafter the expiration of the statute of limitations). The legislative intent must\r\nprevail, and in amending Rule 3(a), SCRCP, this Court has interpreted and\r\napplied the statute in a manner that furthers that legislative intent.\r\n\r\n2 Rule 3 was again amended in 2011, but the change did not affect subsection\r\n(a). See Note to 2011 Amendment, Rule 3, SCRCP (noting the addition of\r\nRule 3(b)(2), which allows the waiver of filing fees in certain instances).\r\n\n       In amending Rule 3(a), SCRCP, this Court clearly stated the 120-day\r\nperiod begins running from the filing of the complaint, not after the end of the\r\nstatute of limitations period as argued by Mims. The 120-day period only has\r\nrelevance if service is accomplished outside of the statute of limitations.\r\nWhen service occurs outside of the statute of limitations it must occur within\r\n120 days of filing the complaint.\r\n\r\n       Applying these provisions to the case before us, we conclude the trial\r\ncourt erred in finding Mims's amended complaint should be dismissed for\r\nfailure to serve it within 120 days of filing the original complaint. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 15-3-20(B); Rule 3(a), SCRCP. Moreover, we agree with Mims\r\nthat, contrary to Defendants' assertion, Rule 15(a), SCRCP does allow the\r\nfiling and service of an amended complaint without leave of court, even if the\r\noriginal complaint has not been served, because a party may amend her\r\npleadings once without leave of court before a responsive pleading is served,\r\nand no responsive pleading had been served by Defendants prior to Mims's\r\nservice of the amended complaint. See Rule 15(a), SCRCP (\"A party may\r\namend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before or within 30\r\ndays after a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which\r\nno responsive pleading is required and the action has not been placed upon\r\nthe trial roster, he may so amend it at any time within 30 days after it is\r\nserved.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       To the extent the trial court further found the alleged absence of proper\r\nservice resulted in a lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction and a\r\nfailure to prosecute, we reverse these findings as they are premised on the\r\nperceived error regarding service. Moreover, we note the failure of proper\r\nservice does not impact the court's subject matter jurisdiction, in any event.\r\nCf. Skinner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 380 S.C. 91, 93, 668 S.E.2d 795,\r\n796 (2008) (observing subject matter jurisdiction is defined as \"the power to\r\nhear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in\r\nquestion belong\" and holding the circuit court erred in ruling it lacked subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction where the alleged error concerned the failure to properly\r\nserve a notice of appeal on the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission (quoting Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442\r\nS.E.2d 598, 600 (1994))).\r\n\n                              III. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we reverse the trial court's dismissal of Mims's\r\ncomplaint and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.3\r\n\r\n      REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n      TOAL, C.J., and HEARN, J., concur. KITTREDGE, J., concurring\r\nin a separate opinion. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 This Court need not reach Mims's remaining argument that the pleadings\r\nwere not subject to dismissal based on Edward's disability. The trial court\r\nstated in its final order that a ruling on the applicable statute of limitations \"is\r\npremature\"; therefore, no ruling was made in this regard that is subject to this\r\nCourt's review.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I join Justice Beatty's excellent majority opinion\r\nsave the Rule 15, SCRCP, analysis. I agree with Justice Pleicones' view of\r\nRule 15's inapplicability to this case, which does not affect the disposition of\r\nthis appeal. I further note this procedural morass stems from Appellant's\r\ndesire to avoid the payment of a filing fee when she filed the \"Amended\r\nComplaint\" under the 2007 civil action number. Under the circumstances, I\r\ndo not view the 2008 complaint as a nullity. Because that complaint was\r\nfiled and served within the statute of limitations, dismissal is not warranted. I\r\nwould merely require the payment of a filing fee and a new civil action\r\nnumber.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent and would affirm the\r\nappealed order finding that because appellant failed to actually serve the\r\ncomplaint within 120 days of filing, the 2007 action ended, and thus no\r\naction was commenced to which the 2008 amended complaint could attach.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-20 (2005).\r\nSection 15-3-20(B) provides \"A civil action is commenced when the\r\nSummons and Complaint are filed with the clerk of court if actual service is\r\naccomplished within one hundred twenty days after filing.\" Appellant's\r\ncomplaint was filed on May 29, 2007, and never served. Under the plain\r\nlanguage of § 15-3-20(B), the action identified as 07-CP-40-3365 was never\r\ncommenced.\r\nAs explained below, nothing in Rule 3, SCRCP, can affect this conclusion\r\nregarding the May 2007 complaint. Rule 3(a) provides that \"A civil action is\r\ncommenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of\r\ncourt if: (1) the summons and complaint are served within the statute of\r\nlimitations in any manner prescribed by law.\" The May 2007 complaint has\r\nnever been served, and accordingly, even pursuant to Rule 3(a), SCRCP, the\r\naction identified as 07-CP-40-3365 has never been commenced. Moreover,\r\nappellant's service in May 2008 of a document denominated \"Amended\r\nComplaint\" in action 07-CP-40-3365 was a nullity. Rule 15, SCRCP,\r\ngoverns amended pleadings. Rule 15(a) permits a party to \"amend his\r\npleading once as a matter of course at any time before or within 30 days after\r\na responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no\r\nresponsive pleading is required and the action has not been placed on the trial\r\nroster, he may so amend it at any time within 30 days after it is served.\" The\r\nplain language of Rule 15(a) allows an amendment only of a pleading which\r\nhas been served. See also Rule 15(c), \"Relation Back of Amendments.\"\r\nNothing in our Rules or statutes recognizes an amended pleading where no\r\nother pleading has been served. This is especially so when the pleading\r\nrelates to an action which has not even been commenced.\r\nThe majority suggests that we should read § 15-3-20(B) and Rule 3(a),\r\nSCRCP, together, and conclude that (1) an action is commenced upon filing\r\nof the summons and complaint, if service is accomplished within the statute\r\nof limitations, but (2) that if filing but not service is done within the statue,\r\n\nthen actual service must be made within 120 days of filing. I agree with the\r\nsecond statement, but find the first statement ignores the plain language of §\r\n15-3-20(B).\r\nSection 15-3-20(B) establishes the date of commencement as the date of\r\nfiling with the clerk if actual service occurs within 120 days after filing.\r\nSince § 15-3-20(A) provides that an action must be commenced within the\r\nstatute of limitations, read together, subsections (A) and (B) compel the same\r\nresult as Rule 3(a)(2) when the complaint is filed near the end of the\r\nlimitations period: so long as an action is filed within the statute of\r\nlimitations, and actual service is accomplished within 120 days after filing,\r\nthe action is deemed to have been commenced within the statute of\r\nlimitations.\r\nWhere, as here, the action is sought to be commenced more than 120 days\r\nbefore the expiration of the statute of limitations, there is an irreconcilable\r\nconflict between Rule 3(a) and § 15-3-20. Rule 3(a) permits a complaint\r\nfiled more than 120 days before expiration of the statute of limitations to be\r\nserved at any time before the statute expires. Where, for example, there is a\r\nthree-year statute, Rule 3(a) would find the action commenced where the\r\ncomplaint was filed on January 1, Year One but not served until December\r\n31, Year Three. On the other hand, § 15-3-20(B) requires that a complaint\r\nfiled January 1, Year One be actually served by May 1 (April 30 in a leap\r\nyear), Year One, that is, within 120 days of filing, in order for the action to be\r\nproperly commenced. Where the question is one of practice and procedure in\r\nthe courts, a court rule is subordinate to the statutory law. Stokes v. Denmark\r\nEmerg. Med. Serv., 315 S.C. 263, 433 S.E.2d 850 (1993), citing S.C. Const.\r\nart. V, § 4. Where the mandate of § 15-3-20(B), requiring actual service\r\nwithin 120 days of filing, is not met, the action cannot be saved by\r\napplication of Rule 3(a)(1). Stokes, supra.\r\nI respectfully dissent, and would affirm the appealed order dismissing this\r\nsuit without prejudice.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27139","title":"Dutch Fork Development v.

Lipscomb (\"Appellant\"), the\r\nmanager of SEL Properties, LLC (\"SEL\") appeals a jury verdict against him\r\nfor tortious interference with a contract entered into by SEL with Dutch Fork\r\nDevelopment Group, II, LLC and Dutch Fork Realty, LLC (collectively\r\n\"Respondents\"). Appellant contends that he, as the manager of the limited\r\nliability company, cannot be held individually liable in tort for a contract that\r\nwas breached by SEL. Alternatively, Appellant challenges the jury's award\r\nof $3,000,000 in actual damages to Respondents on the grounds: (1) the trial\r\njudge erred in charging the jury that lost customers and lost goodwill were\r\nelements of damages as there was no evidence of such damages; and (2) the\r\naward was improper and should have been reduced as the actual damages for\r\nthe tort claim were \"coextensive\" with or subsumed in the jury's award of\r\nactual damages to Respondents for the breach of contract claim against SEL.\r\nAfter we issued our original opinion finding that Appellant was entitled to a\r\ndirected verdict as to the claim of tortious interference with a contract and, in\r\nturn, reversing the jury's award of damages, Respondents petitioned for\r\nrehearing. We deny the petition for rehearing, withdraw our original opinion,\r\nand substitute it with this opinion that revises the conclusion section of the\r\noriginal opinion.     I.    Factual/Procedural History\r\n\r\n      As a result of discussions with Donald and William Melton, members\r\nof Dutch Fork Development Group, II, LLC (\"DFDG\") and Dutch Fork\r\nRealty, LLC (\"DFR\"), SEL purchased a 122.28-acre piece of property in\r\nRichland County for $800,000 on August 8, 2000. The property, which was\r\nto be known as Rolling Creek Estates, was the subject of two contracts\r\nentered into between SEL and Respondents for the development of\r\nresidential subdivisions.\r\n\n      The parties entered into the first contract on November 14, 2000, which\r\ninvolved the development of the Courtyards at Rolling Creek (\"Courtyards\")\r\nin Phases I, II, and III. The second contract, which was entered into on\r\nOctober 17, 2002 and contained substantially the same terms as the first\r\ncontract, involved the development and marketing of a 14.9-acre parcel that\r\nwas to be known as Rolling Creek Phase 4 (\"Rolling Creek\").\r\n\r\n      Pursuant to the first contract, the parties agreed to develop the\r\nCourtyards in three phases over the five-year term of the contract. SEL was\r\nresponsible for: securing financing for the purchase of the property; securing\r\nengineering studies, surveying, and landscaping; and the costs related to the\r\ninfrastructure. SEL also had \"final approval of all costs pertaining to the\r\ndevelopment of the property.\"\r\n\r\n        In terms of Respondents, DFDG was responsible for the development\r\nof the property. In consideration of adequate performance, SEL was to pay\r\nDFDG: (1) a development fee of $54,000 for each phase of the development,\r\nwhich was contingent upon the sale of 60% of the lots developed in the phase\r\nand the \"letting\" of the contract of the next phase; and (2) 25% of the net\r\nprofits received from the sale of the lots sold in each of the three phases.\r\n\r\n      DFR was granted the \"exclusive right to sell\" for \"a period of five (5)\r\nyears provided that DFR [sold and closed] no less than twenty (20%) percent\r\nof the lots available for sale per year in each Phase of the development.\"\r\nAdditionally, DFR was granted the \"exclusive right to sell new homes\r\nconstructed in the development at a sales commission not to exceed seven (7)\r\npercent\" for a period of \"twelve (12) months after construction is commenced\r\non the home.\" DFR was also entitled to a real estate commission of 10%\r\nupon the closing of the sale of developed lots to non-builders; however, DFR\r\nwould not receive a commission for any lot sales to builders.\r\n\r\n     On November 19, 2001, SEL obtained a loan from the National Bank\r\nof South Carolina (\"NBSC\") in the amount of $2,001,375 to provide for the\r\ndevelopment of Phase I of the Courtyards. Shortly thereafter, SEL was\r\n\nreimbursed $800,000 from the loan proceeds for the original land acquisition.\r\nAppellant, however, personally guaranteed that the development loan would\r\nbe repaid and that expenses would be covered.\r\n\r\n       According to Respondents, the sale of lots was delayed for nearly a\r\nyear due to SEL's failure to obtain a bonded plat until August 22, 2002,\r\nwhich, in turn, prevented DFR from initiating sales until the infrastructure\r\nwas completed. After the infrastructure was installed, it was discovered that\r\nthe roads were subject to isolated pavement failures. Because the repairs\r\nwere not made expeditiously, a decision Respondents attributed to SEL's\r\nfailure to fund, the road sustained significant deterioration that resulted in\r\ncostly reconstruction and delays in sales.\r\n\r\n       In addition to these structural delays, Respondents discovered that\r\nAppellant, without the knowledge of DFDG, contacted the project engineer\r\nto redesign the development plans for Phases II and III. SEL's failure to\r\npromptly pay the engineering firm delayed the final approval of the\r\nredesigned plans until March 1, 2007 and, in turn, DFR's sale of the lots in\r\nthis portion of the Courtyards.\r\n       These delays were compounded by financial problems as Phase I\r\nincurred expenses that exceeded the original budget and proceeds from the\r\ndevelopment loan. Due to the resultant cash flow problem, SEL incurred\r\noverdraft charges and work delays stemming from the failure to promptly pay\r\nthe engineering firm and contractors.\r\n      Respondents' dissatisfaction with SEL's handling of the project was\r\nexacerbated by the discovery that lots were being sold at a price below fair\r\nmarket value to K&L Contracting, LLC (\"K&L\"), a home construction\r\ncompany that was managed in part by Appellant. According to Respondents,\r\nthese sales from SEL to K&L circumvented its \"exclusive right to sell\" and\r\nprevented them from receiving commissions on homes that were sold by\r\nK&L.  By letter dated May 28, 2004, SEL terminated the development\r\ncontract. In the letter, SEL referenced the \"numerous road problems and\r\n\nbudget problems throughout the development.\" As the primary basis for\r\ntermination, SEL cited \"[t]he failure of DFDG and DFR to sell at least twenty\r\n(20%) percent of the available lots in any one year period.\" Respondents\r\nchallenged the termination, asserting the requisite number of lots had been\r\nsold.Following the termination, SEL continued to sell and close lots.\r\nUltimately, SEL entered into a contract on September 15, 2006 with Essex\r\nHomes, SE, Inc. (\"Essex Homes\") in the amount of $7,633,000 for the\r\ndevelopment of Phases II and III.\r\n      In February 2005, Respondents filed an action against SEL and\r\nAppellant. As to SEL, Respondents alleged causes of action for breach of\r\ncontract and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.\r\nRespondents further alleged against Appellant, in his individual capacity,\r\ncauses of action for conversion and tortious interference with a contract.\r\n      At trial, Appellant admitted that Respondents were owed money as a\r\nresult of SEL's breach of the two contracts.1 Appellant, however, disputed\r\nthat Respondents were entitled to $3,030,6672 in total damages,3 which was\r\n1 Appellant acknowledged that Respondents had in fact complied with the\r\nsales requirement of the contract and were only three lots short of reaching\r\nthe 60% mark to proceed to the next phase. He, however, claimed that at the\r\ntime the termination letter was written he mistakenly believed Respondents\r\nwere required to sell two lots per month.\r\n2 This amount represents: $162,000 (Development Fees) + $1,121,950\r\n(Profit Split) + $1,746,717 (Real Estate Commissions) = $3,030,667\r\n3 In his closing argument, defense counsel claimed the damages should total\r\n$242,717. According to counsel, this amount represented Phase I and Phase\r\nIV damages plus the development fee for Phase IV. This amount was based\r\non the testimony of SEL's expert witness, Marty Ouzts, who limited his\r\ncalculation of damages to those that were incurred prior to the intended\r\nexpiration of the contract in November 2005.\r\n\nthe amount claimed by Respondents' expert witness, Lynn Richards.\r\nAppellant also maintained that his decisions and actions regarding the project\r\nwere not made for his personal benefit but, rather, on behalf of SEL.\r\n      Prior to the submission of the case to the jury, the judge directed a\r\nverdict in favor of Appellant as to Respondents' cause of action for\r\nconversion.     Additionally, the judge directed a verdict in favor of\r\nRespondents as to SEL's breach of the contract in failing to pay Respondents\r\nthe Phase I development fees in the amount of $54,000. In the charge, the\r\njudge noted this ruling and instructed the jury on the remaining breach of\r\ncontract claims against SEL and recoverable damages. The judge also\r\ninstructed the jury regarding the separate claim of tortious interference with a\r\ncontract against Appellant and the recoverable damages.\r\n      Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Respondents against\r\nSEL in the amount of $299,1444 in actual damages for the breach of contract\r\ncause of action and $1,000,000 in punitive damages for the breach of contract\r\naccompanied by fraudulent act claim. The jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\nRespondents against Appellant in the amount of $3,000,000 in actual\r\ndamages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages for the tortious interference\r\nwith a contract cause of action.\r\n      Following the denial of post-trial motions, SEL and Appellant appealed\r\nthe jury's verdicts to the Court of Appeals. Two months later, SEL settled the\r\nclaims for breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied by a\r\nfraudulent act by paying $1.5 million to Respondents. As a result of the\r\nsettlement, SEL dismissed its appeal. This Court certified Appellant's appeal\r\nfrom the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n4   In addition to the general verdict form, the jury was given special\r\ninterrogatories with respect to the actual damages for the breach of contract\r\nclaim. The question posed was as follows: \"For the Breach of Contract\r\ncause of action, does the amount of actual damages include an award for\r\nPhase 2 and/or Phase 3?\", to which the jury answered \"Yes.\" The jury noted\r\nthat it attributed $54,000 of the total actual damage award to Phase 2.\r\n\n                                II.   Discussion\r\n\r\n                                        A.\r\n      Although Appellant identifies three issues and raises multiple theories,\r\nhis primary contentions are that: (1) he, as the manager of SEL, cannot be\r\nheld individually liable for the claim of tortious interference with the\r\ncontract; and (2) even if he is liable, the award of actual damages was\r\nimproper. Essentially, Appellant claims Respondents' only form of recovery\r\nwas for a breach of contract claim, a claim that has now been satisfied\r\nthrough a settlement agreement. For reasons that will be discussed, we agree\r\nwith Appellant.                        B.\r\n      Appellant contends that as a matter of law he, as the manager of an\r\nLLC, may not be held individually liable for a claim of tortious interference\r\nwith a contract. Citing section 33-44-303(a) of the South Carolina Code,5\r\nAppellant asserts that he is statutorily protected against \"this type of\r\nindividual liability.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5   Section 33-44-303(a) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the debts,\r\n       obligations, and liabilities of a limited liability company, whether\r\n       arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, are solely the debts,\r\n       obligations, and liabilities of the company. A member or manager\r\n       is not personally liable for a debt, obligation, or liability of the\r\n       company solely by reason of being or acting as a member or\r\n       manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-303(a) (2006).\r\n\n       Alternatively, Appellant avers that even if he can be found individually\r\nliable in tort, he was immune from liability as he acted on behalf of SEL and,\r\nthus, was a party to the contract that was breached by SEL. Citing the\r\ngeneral rule that one cannot be held liable for tortious interference with a\r\ncontract to which he is a party, Appellant argues the trial judge erred in\r\ndenying his motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the\r\nverdict (\"JNOV\") as to the claim of tortious interference with a contract.\r\n       Recently, a majority of this Court rejected Appellant's contention that a\r\nmanager of an LLC may not be held individually liable for torts of the LLC.\r\n16 Jade Street, LLC v. R. Design Constr. Co., LLC, 728 S.E.2d 448 (2012),\r\nrehearing granted, (May 4, 2012). Jade Street, however, is not dispositive as\r\nthe instant case involves a separate question of whether Respondents could\r\nsustain a claim of tortious interference with a contract. In answering this\r\nquestion, we must examine the general rule that a claim for tortious\r\ninterference with a contract cannot be made against one who is a party to the\r\ncontract at issue. Specifically, we must decide whether Appellant was a party\r\nto the contract that was admittedly breached by SEL. In analyzing this\r\nquestion, it is necessary to identify the elements of the tort and the privileges\r\nafforded a corporate agent whose corporation is a party to the contract.\r\n       \"The elements of a cause of action for tortious interference with\r\ncontract are: (1) existence of a valid contract; (2) the wrongdoer's knowledge\r\nthereof; (3) his intentional procurement of its breach; (4) the absence of\r\njustification; and (5) resulting damages.\" Camp v. Springs Mortgage Corp.,\r\n310 S.C. 514, 517, 426 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1993). \"[A]n action for tortious\r\ninterference protects the property rights of the parties to a contract against\r\nunlawful interference by third parties.\" Threlkeld v. Christoph, 280 S.C. 225,\r\n227, 312 S.E.2d 14, 15 (Ct. App. 1984). \"Therefore, it does not protect a\r\nparty to a contract from actions of the other party.\" Id.\r\n     \"It is generally recognized that when a contract is breached by a\r\ncorporation as the result of the inducement of an officer or agent of the\r\ncorporation acting on behalf of the corporation and within the scope of his\r\nemployment, the inducement is privileged and is not actionable.\" Bradburn\r\nv. Colonial Stores, Inc., 273 S.C. 186, 188, 255 S.E.2d 453, 455 (1979).\r\n\nThus, \"[t]he actions of a principal's agent are afforded a qualified privilege\r\nfrom liability for tortious interference with the principal's contract.\" CGB\r\nOccupational Therapy, Inc. v. RHA Health Servs., Inc., 357 F.3d 375, 385\r\n(3d Cir. 2004). See generally Thomas G. Fischer, Annotation, Liability of\r\nCorporate Director, Officer, or Employee for Tortious Interference with\r\nCorporation's Contract with Another, 72 A.L.R. 4th 492, §§ 3-8 (1989 &\r\nSupp. 2012) (analyzing state cases involving the question of whether a\r\ndirector, officer, or employee could be held personally liable for tortious\r\ninterference with a corporate contract where individual was considered a\r\nparty to the contract, acted to serve the corporate interests, or acted on behalf\r\nof personal interests).\r\n      \"The reason for this privilege is that holding an agent liable would be\r\nlike holding the principal itself liable for the tort of interfering with its own\r\ncontract, instead of holding the principal liable for breach of contract.\" CGB\r\nOccupational Therapy, Inc., 357 F.3d at 385. \"The agent's privilege is\r\nqualified, however, because it applies only when the agent is acting within\r\nthe scope of its authority.\" Id. \"Conversely, an agent may be liable for\r\ntortious interference, just as if the agent were an outside third party, if the\r\nallegedly interfering acts were conducted outside the scope of the agent's\r\nauthority.\" Id.; Kia v. Imaging Scis. Int'l, Inc., 735 F. Supp. 2d 256, 268\r\n(E.D. Pa. 2010) (\"[A] corporate officer can be liable for tortious interference\r\nonly if he was acting in a personal capacity or outside the scope of his\r\nauthority.\" (citations omitted)); see 3A William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher\r\nCyclopedia of the Law of Corporations, Chapter 11, XXVIII, § 1117 (West\r\n2012) (\"[A] director is not personally liable for the corporation's contractual\r\nbreaches unless he or she assumed personal liability, acted in bad faith, or\r\ncommitted a tort in connection with the performance of the contract.\").\r\n\"Scope of authority\" is defined as \"[t]he range of reasonable power that an\r\nagent has been delegated or might foreseeably be delegated in carrying out\r\nthe principal's business.\" Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009).\r\n      Therefore, as a matter of law, a manager of a limited liability company\r\ncan wrongfully interfere with his company's contracts and be held\r\nindividually liable for his acts. In light of this holding, the question becomes\r\nwhether Appellant could be held liable under the facts of the instant case.\r\n\n      As a threshold matter, we find Respondents' failure to include SEL's\r\noperating agreement as part of the record constitutes a significant impediment\r\nto establishing a claim of tortious interference with a contract as we are\r\nunable to discern the precise parameters of Appellant's authority.6 Without\r\nan identifiable scope of authority, we are left to speculate whether Appellant's\r\nactions exceeded his authority as the managing agent of SEL.7 Furthermore,\r\nwe find that each of the actions relied upon by Respondents to support their\r\nclaim can only be attributed to SEL and not to Appellant personally.\r\n       In support of their claim, Respondents primarily relied upon the sale of\r\nlots to K&L, the redesign of the development plans for Phases II and III, the\r\ntermination of the contract, and the sale of the project to Essex Homes.\r\nRespondents maintain there was no legitimate business justification for these\r\n\r\n6   The operating agreement governs:\r\n\r\n    (1) relations among the members as members and between the members\r\n       and the limited liability company;\r\n    (2) the rights and duties of a person in the capacity of manager;\r\n    (3) the activities of the company and the conduct of those activities; and\r\n    (4) the means and conditions for amending the operating agreement.\r\n\r\n51 Am. Jur. 2d Limited Liability Companies § 4 (2011) (emphasis added);\r\nsee S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-103(a) (2006) (providing that under the Uniform\r\nLimited Liability Company Act of 1996, members of an LLC may enter into\r\nan operating agreement, \"to regulate the affairs of the company and the\r\nconduct of its business, and to govern relations among the members,\r\nmanagers, and company\").\r\n7  We disagree with Respondents' contention that the contract established the\r\nlimitations on Appellant's authority. The contract established the rights and\r\nduties of SEL and Respondents with respect to the development project and\r\nnot the authority of Appellant with respect to SEL. See 17A Am. Jur. 2d\r\nContracts § 1 (2004) (\"[A] 'contract' has been defined as a private, voluntary,\r\nallocation by which two or more parties distribute specific entitlements and\r\nobligations.\").\r\n\nactions and, thus, did not serve the corporate interests of SEL. In turn,\r\nRespondents contend the only logical inference is that Appellant acted in his\r\npersonal capacity as his actions would not have been authorized by SEL.\r\n      With respect to each of these actions, the documentation in the record\r\nestablishes that SEL was the entity that sold the lots, signed off on change\r\norders for the development plans, terminated the contract, and entered into\r\nthe contract with Essex Homes. Although Appellant was the principal actor\r\nin these transactions, there is no evidence to refute that he acted within his\r\nauthority as the manager of SEL.\r\n      Even if Appellant, as a member of K&L, received financial benefit\r\nfrom the sale of the lots to K&L, the sales were nevertheless done on behalf\r\nof SEL. Notably, Respondents relied on these lot sales to establish that they\r\nhad in fact satisfied the sales requirement prior to SEL's breach of the\r\ncontract. Furthermore, the sale of Phases II and III to Essex Homes was\r\nentered into by SEL after it terminated the contract with Respondents. Even\r\nthough Appellant engaged in negotiations during the term of the contract,\r\nthese actions were also done on behalf of SEL and only provide evidence to\r\nsupport the breach of contract claim. The jury recognized this fact as it\r\ncompensated Respondents for their losses in Phases II and III by awarding\r\ndamages for the breach of contract cause of action.\r\n       Finally, by personally guaranteeing the development loan, Appellant\r\nbecame personally liable for the repayment of that particular financial\r\nobligation. The personal guarantee did not, however, render him personally\r\nliable in tort. See Hester Enters., Inc. v. Narvais, 402 S.E.2d 333, 335 (Ga.\r\nCt. App. 1991) (\"[A] corporate officer who does personally guarantee an\r\nobligation may be personally liable for the performance of that particular\r\nobligation, but such a personal guarantee does not render him personally\r\nliable on any and all corporate obligations.\").\r\n      We conclude Respondents failed to identify how Appellant exceeded\r\nhis authority as the managing agent of SEL. Because Appellant's actions can\r\nonly be attributable to SEL, there is an absence of evidence to establish a\r\nseparate claim that Appellant was individually liable in tort. Accordingly, we\r\nhold the trial judge erred in denying Appellant's motions for a directed\r\n\nverdict and JNOV on the cause of action for tortious interference with a\r\ncontract. See Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing & Regulation, 336\r\nS.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999) (recognizing that an appellate\r\ncourt will reverse the trial judge's ruling with respect to the denial of motions\r\nfor a directed verdict or JNOV only when there is no evidence to support the\r\nruling or when the ruling is controlled by an error of law).\r\n       In view of our holding, we need not address Appellant's remaining\r\nissues regarding the award of damages. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\nGeorgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999) (providing that an\r\nappellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of a prior\r\nissue is dispositive).                III.\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we hold the trial judge erred in denying\r\nAppellant's motions for a directed verdict and JNOV as there is no evidence\r\nto support the cause of action for tortious interference with a contract.\r\nSpecifically, we find Respondents' failure to include SEL's operating\r\nagreement as part of the record precludes us from being able to discern the\r\nprecise parameters of Appellant's authority. Furthermore, Respondents failed\r\nto identify how Appellant exceeded his authority as the managing agent of\r\nSEL. Thus, because Appellant's actions can only be attributable to SEL,\r\nthere is an absence of evidence to establish a separate claim that Appellant\r\nwas individually liable for the cause of action for tortious interference with a\r\ncontract. Accordingly, we reverse the award of damages on this cause of\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n      REVERSED.\r\n    TOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James\r\nA.

Andrew Ballard worked for years\r\ncrafting a plan for a marina through Warpath Development, Inc., the business\r\nhe had incorporated for this very purpose. He eventually sought the\r\ninvestment and involvement of Tim Roberson, Rick Thoennes, Rick\r\nThoennes, III (collectively, individual Appellants) to help realize this idea.\r\nWhen the marina did not develop the way the individual Appellants had\r\nhoped, they began to exclude Ballard from involvement with Warpath,\r\nleading Ballard to file suit against the individual Appellants and Warpath\r\n(collectively, Appellants). The circuit court found Appellants had acted\r\noppressively to Ballard as a minority shareholder and ordered the purchase of\r\nBallard's stock at fair market value. The court also ordered the individual\r\nAppellants to place 60,000 shares of Warpath stock in escrow. On appeal,\r\nAppellants argue that the facts do not support the court's holdings. We\r\naffirm.       FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      Ballard incorporated Warpath for the development of a marina on Lake\r\nKeowee in Pickens County, South Carolina. After several years of working\r\nwith Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, which owned the lakefront property,\r\nWarpath entered into a lease with Duke to use the property as indicated on\r\nthe Conceptual Plan Ballard had negotiated with Duke.\r\n\r\n       Subsequently, Ballard began talks with the individual Appellants about\r\ntheir possible involvement with Warpath, and eventually the four men\r\nentered into a Stock Purchase Agreement. At that time, the corporation had\r\nissued only 40,000 shares of stock, all of which were owned by Ballard,\r\nalthough the Articles of Incorporation authorized the issuance of 100,000\r\ntotal shares. Under the Agreement, the individual Appellants paid Ballard\r\n$1,000,000 \"in exchange for 20,000 shares of Ballard's 40,000 and [received]\r\nfrom the corporation [60,000] additional shares so that Ballard [would] hold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     19 \n\r\n\n20% of the stock and the other 80% [would] be held by Roberson, Thoennes\r\nand Thoennes III when all shares are finally issued.1\"\r\n\r\n      The Agreement also detailed the duties of each of the parties: Ballard\r\nwas to enter into a separate agreement with Warpath outlining his duties, to\r\ninclude securing certain permits, leases, and services; Thoennes and\r\nThoennes, III were to enter into an agreement defining their duties regarding\r\ndevelopment work, assistance with proformas and obtaining permanent\r\nfinancing, and executing loan documents; and Roberson was to provide the\r\nnecessary capital to obtain long term financing. The Agreement also\r\nacknowledged Ballard had already obtained a lease from Duke and approvals\r\nfrom Duke and Pickens County, but it stated final permits were still pending.\r\n\r\n       Incorporated into the lease with Duke was the Plan for the marina. The\r\nPlan included general numbers for certain details, including a projected\r\nnumber of 100-200 boat slips. The individual Appellants had reviewed the\r\nPlan and the proposed numbers prior to signing the agreement and knew that\r\nit guaranteed no more than 100 slips. A few months after the parties entered\r\ninto the Agreement, they met with Duke and discovered that boat slips were\r\navailable only on a portion of the anticipated area, which meant the architect\r\ncould only squeeze in 102 slips, not the maximum of 200.\r\n\r\n      Upset over this decrease in the projected income due to significantly\r\nfewer slips than they had hoped for, the individual Appellants collaborated in\r\ndrafting an e-mail to convince Ballard to return some or all the money that he\r\nhad been paid, or to return his 20,000 shares to the corporation and cease\r\ninvolvement with the development. They eventually sent Ballard an e-mail\r\nasking that he return the $1,000,000 they had paid him in full or at least\r\nreturn a portion of it if he wanted to move forward. Ballard declined both of\r\nthose options, and he subsequently was removed as a director at the first\r\nshareholders' meeting a few months later. At that same meeting, however, all\r\nthree of the other shareholders were elected to the board and appointed as\r\nofficers. Immediately thereafter, the individual Appellants—with the dissent\r\n1The 60,000 shares of stock from Warpath were issued directly to Roberson,\r\nThoennes, and Thoennes, III immediately after the Agreement was signed.\r\n                                     20 \n\r\n\nof Ballard—approved the issuance of an additional 900,000 shares \"for the\r\npurpose of raising capital, paying expenses and offering employee\r\nincentives.\" This issuance would be in direct conflict with the Articles of\r\nIncorporation, which only authorized 100,000 shares and the Agreement,\r\nwhich stated Ballard would ultimately own 20% of the corporation. No\r\nmotion was made to amend the Articles.\r\n\r\n      Realizing this increase in shares would dilute his holdings to 2%,\r\nBallard initiated this lawsuit, alleging a violation of the Agreement and\r\nseeking an injunction preventing the issuance of the additional stock. In\r\nresponse, Appellants counterclaimed for fraud, breach of contract, breach of\r\ncontract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and promissory estoppel. After\r\ndiscovery, Ballard amended his complaint to include shareholder derivative\r\nclaims that the individual Appellants had breached the Agreement with\r\nrespect to duties owed to Warpath and allegations of oppression of the\r\nminority shareholder.      Appellants then amended their answer and\r\ncounterclaimed for fraud, breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied\r\nby a fraudulent act, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of South\r\nCarolina Code Section 35-1-501 (Supp. 2011) in connection with the sale of\r\nsecurities.2\r\n\r\n     A jury trial commenced, but the jury was discharged when Appellants\r\ndismissed their counterclaims with prejudice. Thus, only Ballard's equitable\r\nclaims remained. The circuit court3 found sufficient evidence of oppression\r\nand ordered Appellants to purchase Ballard's stock at fair market value.\r\nAdditionally, the court ordered that the individual Appellants place 60,000 of\r\n\r\n2 Within a few weeks of filing their amended answer and counterclaims, a\r\nshareholders meeting was held at which Ballard was elected a director at the\r\nmotion of the individual Appellants, but no meeting of directors has been\r\ncalled since. While there apparently have been some discussions with\r\nBallard regarding the permits, he has not received any updates from the\r\ndirectors about efforts to finance the company.\r\n3 Since 2007, Judge Miller has been designated by the Chief Justice as one of\r\nthree business court judges in this State.\r\n                                     21 \n\r\n\ntheir shares in escrow pursuant to Section 33-6-210(e) of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2006). This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       \"A shareholders derivative action, as well as an action for stockholder\r\noppression, is one in equity.\" Straight v.

We disagree.\r\n\r\n      Section 33-14-300(2)(ii) of the South Carolina Code (2006) allows the\r\ncircuit court to dissolve a corporation if a shareholder has established that\r\n\"the directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting, or\r\n\r\n                                            22 \n\r\n\nwill act in a manner that is illegal, fraudulent, oppressive, or unfairly\r\nprejudicial either to the corporation or to any shareholder (whether in his\r\ncapacity as a shareholder, director, or officer of the corporation).\" In an\r\naction to dissolve a corporation on the grounds stated in section 33-14-300, a\r\ncourt may instead order the corporation or other shareholders to purchase the\r\nshares of any shareholder at fair market value. S.C. Code. Ann. § 33-14-\r\n310(d)(4) (2006).\r\n\r\n      In Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Systems & Services, Inc., 343 S.C. 587, 541\r\nS.E.2d 257 (2001), we established how a court should determine whether\r\nmajority shareholders have acted oppressively within the meaning of section\r\n33-14-300. Kiriakides involved Atlas Food Systems and Services, Inc., a\r\nfamily owned close corporation, where the oldest brother, Alex, was the\r\nmajority shareholder owning 57.68% of the shares. Id. at 591, 541 S.E.2d at\r\n260. His siblings John and Louise, the plaintiffs in the case, owned 37.7%\r\nand 3% of the corporation, respectively. Id. John and Louise brought a\r\nlawsuit against Alex and the corporation seeking, among other things,\r\njudicial dissolution for oppression. Id. at 593, 541 S.E.2d at 261. In\r\nestablishing the proper considerations for finding oppression, we observed\r\nthat \"the terms 'oppressive' and 'unfairly prejudicial' are elastic terms whose\r\nmeaning varies with the circumstances presented in a particular case.\" Id. at\r\n602, 541 S.E.2d at 266. We also noted this was a fact-sensitive review and\r\nshould therefore be determined through a \"case-by-case analysis,\r\nsupplemented by various factors which may be indicative of oppressive\r\nbehavior.\" Id. at 603, 541 S.E.2d at 266. Although we declined to set out\r\nspecific factors in Kiriakides, we observed several commonly considered\r\nones including: \"eliminating minority shareholders from directorate and\r\nexcluding them from employment[,] . . . failure to enforce contracts for the\r\nbenefit of the corporation[, and] withholding information from minority\r\nshareholders.\" Id. at 605 n.28, 541 S.E.2d at 267 n.28.\r\n\r\n       Examining the facts of the case, we found it \"present[ed] a classic\r\nsituation of minority 'freeze out'\" and noted several factors including Alex\r\npaying Louise less than was owed to her based on her ownership; Alex's\r\nconduct in transferring 21% of a wholly owned subsidiary to his children\r\n\r\n                                      23 \n\r\n\ninstead of to a partnership which included John and Louise; Alex and his\r\nfamily receiving substantial benefits from ownership of the company through\r\nemployment while Louise and John had no such expectations of benefit;\r\nAtlas having no intention of declaring dividends in the near future; Atlas's\r\nextremely low buyout options for John and Louise, offering them $4,000,000\r\nin 1998 when John had been told by an accountant in 1995 that his interest\r\nalone was worth $10,000,000; and there being no market otherwise for John\r\nand Louise's stock. Id. at 605-06, 541 S.E.2d at 268.\r\n\r\n      We acknowledge that the facts before us are not as egregious as those\r\nin Kiriakides, which included actual fraud by Alex upon the minority.\r\nHowever, illegal or fraudulent conduct is not required under section 33-14-\r\n300(2)(ii), and we agree with the circuit court that the evidence in the record\r\nshows oppression by the majority in this instance. The concern and focus in\r\nshareholder oppression cases is that the minority \"faces a trapped investment\r\nand an indefinite exclusion [from] participation in business returns.\" Id. at\r\n604, 541 S.E.2d at 267 (quoting Douglas K. Moll, Shareholder Oppression in\r\nClose Corporations: The Unanswered Question of Perspective, 53 Vand. L.\r\nRev. 749, 790-91 (2000)). Ballard here, like John and Louise in Kiriakides,\r\nsimilarly faces prospects of exclusion from the business, a slim chance of\r\nseeing a return any time soon, and no market in which to otherwise unload\r\nhis investment.\r\n\r\n      In particular, e-mail communications between the other shareholders\r\nclearly indicate their desire to oust Ballard. The individual Appellants\r\nwanted to convince Ballard to return his 20% interest in Warpath in the hopes\r\nthat \"he [would] take his [$1,000,000] and run [] after a little threatening,\r\nposturing and whining.\" Furthermore, when discussing what options to give\r\nBallard, Thoennes, III posited, \"Don't we want to get him out of the deal?\"\r\nAlthough at trial the individual Appellants sought to downplay the\r\nimplications of these electronic exchanges, this enunciation of their intent to\r\nforce out Ballard simply contextualizes their subsequent actions.\r\n\r\n      Ballard, who had conceptualized this project and had been the sole\r\nshareholder as well as a director and officer of Warpath, was not elected to\r\n\r\n                                      24 \n\r\n\nthe board although the three individual Appellants were elected and\r\nsubsequently appointed themselves officers. Furthermore, the individual\r\nAppellants then passed a corporate resolution authorizing 900,000 new shares\r\nof stock in violation of both the Agreement and the Articles of Incorporation.\r\nIssuance of this additional stock would result in the dilution of Ballard's\r\nownership interest in violation of the Agreement—from 20% to 2%.\r\nAlthough the individual appellants deride the implication of this increase by\r\nnoting that this dilution would affect all the shareholders with equal force,\r\nthis contention ignores the larger problems with the resolution. Issuance of\r\nthis additional stock is in direct conflict with the Articles, which have never\r\nbeen amended4 to allow such an increase, and is contrary to the agreed upon\r\nallocations of the Agreement. Additionally, this issuance would allow\r\nRoberson to avoid his contractual obligation to provide the needed capital\r\nunder the Agreement because the first reason listed for this issuance was \"for\r\nthe purpose of raising additional capital.\"\r\n\r\n      This increase also permitted the corporation to use the extra stock for\r\n\"employee incentives,\" granting the majority more control over the allocation\r\nof benefits flowing from the corporation. There seems to be no plan to hire\r\nBallard as an employee, and at trial Roberson stated his clear intention to hire\r\nvarious members of his family to assist in the enterprise.5 Thus, Roberson\r\nwould allow his own family to profit from his ownership—through both\r\n4 Although James Fayssoux, who served as the attorney for the corporation,\r\nstated in his deposition that amending the Articles was implicit at the\r\nmeeting, he admitted no resolution had been passed authorizing the filing of\r\nthe paperwork necessary to amend the Articles.\r\n5 Although Appellants sought to dismiss this consideration as hypothetical,\r\nRoberson stated at trial that after spending time at the lake with his niece and\r\nher family, he decided her husband was \"the guy [he] want[s] running this\r\nthing\" and \"asked them if they would consider the job as on-site managers.\"\r\nHe further testified making that decision \"attracted . . . [his] whole family\r\nbasically\" including his eighty-nine year old mother, his older sister, and his\r\nyounger sister, who moved to the area \"to be a part of what's happening.\" It\r\nthus appears Roberson's decision to hire his family was more than \"gross\r\nspeculation,\" as claimed in Appellants' brief.\r\n                                      25 \n\r\n\nsalary and, under the new resolution, stock incentives—while not affording\r\nBallard similar benefits. This result is especially significant because returns\r\non investment in close corporations often accrue incident to employment with\r\nthe corporation as opposed to through dividends. See Moll, supra, at 758\r\n(noting that \"the close corporation investor typically looks to salary rather\r\nthan dividends for a share of the business returns because the earnings of a\r\nclose corporation often are distributed in major part in salaries, bonuses and\r\nretirement benefits\" (internal quotation omitted)). By increasing the amount\r\nof shares, the majority would be allowed further means through which to\r\ndictate and control the allocation of returns in favor of their own interests,\r\nand to the exclusion of Ballard's.\r\n\r\n       Moreover, Ballard has not been allowed to meaningfully participate in\r\nthe development for lack of communication. Appellants admit they have not\r\ndirectly kept him updated on the progress of the permits although Ballard has\r\nattempted to stay informed on the status of the permits by maintaining\r\ncontact with Duke, the engineers, and the Department of Health and\r\nEnvironmental Control. While Appellants contend they elected him as a\r\ndirector in an attempt to include him again, Thoennes admitted at trial that\r\nthey have not had a directors' meeting since Ballard's election nor have they\r\nsent him any updates on financing.\r\n\r\n      We find the record evinces a clear intent by Appellants to \"freeze-out\"\r\nBallard and exclude him from involvement with Warpath and from the\r\nbenefits of ownership.6 Although we acknowledge some harm alleged is\r\narguably prospective, the statute envisions future harm, providing that a court\r\ncan find oppression where the majority \"will act\" in a manner oppressive to\r\nthe minority. Moreover, Ballard should not be prejudiced because he has\r\nsought to proactively protect his legal rights and did not wait for the complete\r\nevisceration of his involvement once he understood the Appellants meant to\r\n\r\n6 In the dissent's view of the facts, no one action by Appellants is so\r\negregious as to warrant a finding of oppression. We, however, agree with the\r\ncircuit court judge, that the evidence as a whole clearly demonstrates\r\noppression by the majority.           26 \n\r\n\nforce him out of the corporation.7 We therefore affirm the circuit court's\r\nfinding of oppression and its requirement that Appellants purchase Ballard's\r\nstock at fair market value.\r\n\r\n      II.   ESCROW OF STOCK\r\n\r\n     The individual Appellants also argue the circuit court erred in requiring\r\nthem to place 60,000 shares of Warpath stock in escrow pursuant to section\r\n33-6-210(e). We disagree.\r\n\r\n      Section 33-6-210(e) requires that \"the corporation must place in escrow\r\nshares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or for a promissory\r\nnote.\" Although the individual Appellants argue that Ballard should have\r\nrequested the shares be placed in escrow at the time the agreement was\r\nentered into, the language of the statute is a clear mandate to the corporation\r\nto escrow stock when shares have been issued in anticipation of future\r\nservices. See Edwards v. State Law Enforcement Div., 395 S.C. 571, ___,\r\n720 S.E.2d 462, 464 (2011) (\"When a statute's terms are clear and\r\nunambiguous on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a\r\ncourt must apply the statute according to its literal meaning.\"). However, the\r\nindividual Appellants aver that the $1,000,000 which they paid Ballard\r\npursuant to the Agreement was in exchange for not only the 20,000 shares\r\nowned by Ballard, but also for the remaining 60,000 shares issued by the\r\ncorporation. We agree with the circuit court that the weight of the evidence\r\nand the Agreement itself are directly contrary to this assertion.\r\n\r\n     The agreement states that Roberson, Thoennes, and Thoennes, III\r\nwould pay Ballard \"the sum of $1,000,000 in exchange for 20,000 shares of\r\n7 The dissent would have us require a showing of \"imminent harm\" to obtain\r\nrelief under section 33-14-300(2)(ii) for future oppression. While we agree\r\nwith the dissent that our analysis must be undertaken with caution, we see no\r\nneed to impose a further requirement of \"imminent harm\" on minority\r\nshareholders seeking to protect their rights. Appellants have not asked us to\r\nengraft this requirement onto section 33-14-300(2)(ii), and the statute itself\r\ncontains no such prerequisite.        27 \n\r\n\nBallard's 40,000 and [would] receive from the corporation additional shares.\"\r\n\"Where the contract's language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone\r\ndetermines the contract's force and effect.\" McGill v. Moore, 381 S.C. 179,\r\n185, 672 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2009). Looking simply at the language of the\r\nagreement, it states the money tendered is \"in exchange for the 20,000\r\nshares\" and the shares from the corporation are separate. Furthermore, the\r\n$1,000,000 was paid to Ballard directly and not the corporation. Although\r\nthe individual Appellants argue that it would make sense to pay Ballard\r\nmoney owed to the corporation because he was the sole shareholder at the\r\ntime, this entirely ignores the corporate form and the fact that the yet\r\nunissued 60,000 shares came directly from the corporation, not Ballard.\r\nBecause the individual Appellants issued the check to Ballard, the\r\ncorporation did not receive any money in exchange for the stock.\r\nFurthermore, the Agreement itself illustrates the \"future services or benefits\"\r\nthat each party would perform by requiring the execution of separate\r\nagreements defining the respective duties of the parties.\r\n\r\n      Read as a whole, the language of the Agreement therefore indicates that\r\nthe money exchanged was for the 20,000 shares previously held by Ballard\r\nand the remaining 60,000 shares were exchanged in anticipation of the\r\nservices listed.     Additionally, because we give great deference to the\r\ncredibility determinations of the circuit court, we find it compelling that\r\ndespite conflicting testimony,8 the court determined that the money had been\r\npaid solely for the 20,000 shares directly from Ballard and the corporation\r\nhad not otherwise been compensated for its issuance of the remaining 60,000\r\nshares. We therefore find no error in the circuit court's finding that the\r\nindividual Appellants must place 60,000 shares in escrow in accordance with\r\nsection 33-6-210(e).\r\n\r\n8 This inconsistency existed not just between Appellants and Respondent, but\r\neven between the individual Appellants. At trial, when Thoennes was asked\r\n\"[Y]ou [and your son] didn’t buy those forty thousand shares when you paid\r\nAndy Ballard a million dollars. You've still got to earn them, right?\" he\r\nresponded simply, \"Sure.\" However, his son testified, \"In my opinion we\r\nwere giving him a million dollars for eighty percent of the corporation.\"\r\n                                      28 \n\r\n\n                              CONCLUSION \n\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's order directing\r\nAppellants to purchase Ballard's stock for fair market value and requiring the\r\nindividual Appellants to place 60,000 shares of stock in escrow.\r\n\r\n      BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     29 \n\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent. In my view, no oppressive\r\nconduct toward a minority shareholder has occurred in this case, and the\r\npossibility of future oppression is too remote to justify an equitable remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 33-14-300(2)(ii) (2006), dissolution of a\r\ncorporation is appropriate when a court determines that “the directors or\r\nthose in control of the corporation have acted, are acting, or will act in a\r\nmanner that is illegal, fraudulent, oppressive, or unfairly prejudicial . . . to\r\nany shareholder.” In applying this statute, courts must exercise caution in\r\nfinding conduct to be oppressive. Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Systems &\r\nServices, Inc., 343 S.C. 587, 597-98, 541 S.E.2d 257, 263 (2001) (quoting\r\nofficial comment that “[t]he court should be cautious in the application of\r\nthese grounds so as to limit them to genuine abuse . . . .”). Although the\r\nstatute permits dissolution when those in control will act in an oppressive\r\nmanner, such a finding must be made as cautiously as a finding of past\r\noppression. Thus, I would limit the application of the statute to instances in\r\nwhich the probability of future abuse is a near certainty. That is, a showing\r\nof imminent harm must be made. In my view, the evidence in this case fails\r\nto establish that oppression has occurred or is imminent.\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree with the majority that a court-mandated buyout may be appropriate\r\nwhen a minority shareholder “faces a trapped investment and an indefinite\r\nexclusion [from] participation in business returns.” Kiriakides at 604, 541\r\nS.E.2d at 267 (citation omitted; emphasis added). In my view, however, the\r\nevidence does not demonstrate that Ballard has been or is in imminent danger\r\nof being excluded from returns, despite his exclusion from management.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngaging in a power struggle for control of a corporation is permissible if\r\nacceptable tactics are employed in the struggle. Id. at 598, 541 S.E.2d at 263.\r\nBy the same token, transferring management of a venture from one\r\nshareholder to another is not oppressive if based on a valid business reason.\r\nSee also Cooke v. Fresh Exp. Foods Corp., Inc., 169 Or. App. 101, 110, 7\r\nP.3d 717, 722 (Or. App. 2000) (“Courts give significant deference to the\r\n                                       30 \n\r\n\nmajority’s judgment in the business decisions that it makes, at least if the\r\ndecisions appear to be genuine business decisions.”). In this case, although\r\nAppellants were disgruntled with Ballard and removed him as manager of the\r\nproject, it is undisputed that the project remains in the developmental stage.\r\nThe likelihood is small that any investor will see a return on investment in the\r\nnear future. Ballard does not argue that Appellants are seeking to liquidate\r\nthe corporation’s assets or transfer them to other entities. Thus, I do not\r\nunderstand how the majority finds evidence of oppression in the fact that\r\nBallard is unlikely to see a return on his investment in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority also finds that the stock authorization was intended as a means\r\nfor Roberson to avoid his contractual obligation to provide long-term\r\nfinancing. I do not agree that Roberson’s obligation to obtain long-term\r\nfinancing was a commitment to provide all capital needed by the corporation,\r\nand it is axiomatic that a corporation may authorize and issue stock for the\r\npurpose of raising additional capital. Moreover, in my view the Agreement\r\nin this case did not prohibit such action but rather established what the initial\r\nstock distribution would be among the various investors.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also do not find significant the board’s failure to amend the articles of\r\nincorporation when it authorized the additional shares. This action did not\r\nviolate the articles, which specified the number of issued shares rather than\r\nthe number of authorized shares. Moreover, in my view the absence of a\r\nspecific amendment to the articles of incorporation is no more than a\r\ntechnicality when the same votes that authorized the shares would also have\r\namended the articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority reasons that Appellants’ intent was to gain greater control over\r\nallocation of returns on the parties’ joint investment. However, as the\r\nmajority shareholders, Appellants already had full control of the corporation\r\nand its distribution of profits and benefits. Thus, the question is not whether\r\nthe majority shareholders were seeking control but whether they would have\r\nabused or did abuse that control. See Kiriakides, supra.\r\n                                       31 \n\r\n\nI also do not find it significant that the majority shareholders failed to\r\ncommunicate information to Ballard since, by the time it could be fairly said\r\nthey should have communicated financial information to him, Ballard had\r\nfiled suit against them. Nor would I imply that a minority shareholder is\r\nentitled to be apprised of every detail of a firm’s operations, even in a closely\r\nheld corporation. In my view, Ballard has not shown that he was deprived of\r\ninformation he needed to protect his interests as a shareholder. See Masinter\r\nv. WEBCO Co., 164 W.Va. 241, 256-57, 262 S.E.2d 433, 443 (W. Va. 1980)\r\n(“The fact that [the minority shareholder] received diminished financial\r\ninformation after his removal as a director and officer may reflect nothing\r\nmore than the practical recognition that an officer-director needs more\r\nfinancial information, in order to intelligently exercise his responsibilities,\r\nthan does a shareholder. On the other hand, upon a fuller factual\r\ndevelopment, the withholding of information may be linked to the ‘freeze-\r\nout’ in that it may have denied him relevant information.”).\r\n\r\n\r\nLikewise, I do not find evidence of oppression in the fact that one of the\r\nAppellants planned to employ several family members at the marina. Not\r\nonly would the planned marina require the services of several employees, but\r\nBallard does not contend that he wished to be employed or have his own\r\nfamily members employed in the operation. Thus, there is no reason to\r\nconclude that Appellants intended to deprive Ballard of a benefit he expected.\r\nOn the contrary, the evidence in the record indicates that Ballard intended to\r\nparticipate only in the development of the project and subsequent returns on\r\ninvestment. Thus, any plans by Appellants to employ family members would\r\nbe entirely appropriate in the absence of excessive compensation to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sum, although evidence in this case may point to the possibility of\r\noppressive intent by Appellants, it is far from conclusive in establishing that\r\nsuch an eventuality would have become a reality. In my view, this evidence\r\nfalls well short of the standard articulated in Kiriakides. Thus, I respectfully\r\ndissent.                               32 \n\r\n\nTOAL, C.J., concurs. \n   33\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27162","title":"In the Matter of Lawrence J.

David\r\n            DuRant & Assoc., of Surfside Beach, pro se.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of an admonition or public reprimand. In addition, respondent\r\nagrees to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and the\r\nNotary Public Law course offered by the South Carolina Bar within twelve (12)\r\nmonths of the imposition of a sanction.

The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\nRespondent represents Client in a domestic action. Respondent instructed Client to\r\nobtain written statements from anyone who could potentially serve as a witness in\r\nher case and to bring the statements to him for review. Client gave respondent four\r\nhandwritten statements from potential witnesses. Respondent's office typed the\r\nstatements in affidavit form and gave them back to Client with instructions to have\r\nthe affidavits signed and notarized.\r\n\r\nClient returned the signed affidavits to respondent; however, the statements were\r\nnot notarized. Respondent instructed Client to contact each of the witnesses by\r\ntelephone. Respondent maintains that the individuals to whom he spoke on the\r\ntelephone confirmed that each of them had signed the affidavits in question.\r\nDespite the affiants not signing the documents in his presence, respondent\r\nnotarized the four statements and presented the affidavits to the court at the\r\ntemporary hearing. One of the alleged affiants presented a subsequent affidavit to\r\nthe court stating that she had never submitted an affidavit on Client's behalf.\r\nRespondent represents that, based on his telephone conversations, he believed that\r\nthe individuals he spoke with had executed the affidavits.\r\n\r\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 3.3(a)(1) (lawyer\r\nshall not knowingly make false statement of fact to tribunal); Rule 3.4(b) (lawyer\r\nshall not falsify evidence); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to\r\nviolate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\r\nmisrepresentation). Respondent also admits he has violated the following Rules\r\nfor Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to violates Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\n\r\n                                    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand.

In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of an admonition or public reprimand. Respondent further agrees:\r\n1) to pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by\r\nODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) within thirty (30)\r\ndays of the imposition of a sanction; 2) to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\nProgram Ethics School within one (1) year of the imposition of a sanction; and 3)\r\nto retain and work with a law office management advisor for two (2) years\r\nfollowing the imposition of a sanction. We accept the Agreement and issue a\r\npublic reprimand. In addition, we impose the conditions of discipline agreed to by\r\nthe parties. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\n                                      Matter I\r\n\r\nClient A hired respondent to represent him on appeal from his criminal conviction.\r\nRespondent failed to timely file the record on appeal and the appeal was dismissed.\r\nRespondent moved for reconsideration of the dismissal, but failed to respond in\r\nwriting to two letters from the court and his motion was dismissed. Respondent\r\nfailed to inform Client A of the dismissal of the appeal and his failure to have the\r\nappeal reinstated.\r\n\r\nClient A discovered his appeal had been dismissed when he wrote to the appellate\r\ncourt. An attorney with the Office of Appellate Defense later had Client A's appeal\r\nreinstated and Client A prevailed on appeal.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter II\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Client B in a probate court appeal. The appeal was\r\ndismissed when respondent failed to appear for a roster meeting. Respondent\r\nmaintains he was unaware of the roster meeting until the clerk's office called on the\r\nmorning of the meeting; however, several weeks earlier the clerk's office had sent a\r\nmemorandum advising that the roster had been posted online.\r\n\r\nRespondent moved for reconsideration, but submitted the motion to the wrong\r\njudge. Respondent was advised he had ten (10) days to submit the motion to the\r\njudge who had dismissed the appeal. Respondent failed to timely submit the\r\nmotion to the correct judge, but the judge learned of the motion and issued an order\r\ndenying the motion for reconsideration. When respondent notified Client B that\r\nthe motion for reconsideration had been denied, she terminated the representation.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter III\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Client C, the wife, in a domestic action which did not\r\nresult in a divorce. Several years after he was initially hired, respondent met with\r\nClient C and her husband about a change of custody. Respondent was advised the\r\nparties had agreed to divorce and for the husband to have custody of the couple's\r\nminor children. Respondent prepared the proposed agreement as Client C's\r\nattorney.\r\n\nAfter the parties executed the agreement, Client C advised respondent that she did\r\nnot want to proceed with the agreement. Respondent refused the husband's\r\ndemands that he file the agreement, but did write a letter on the husband's behalf\r\nadvising the school that the husband had joint custody of the couple's son and\r\nshould be notified if anyone tried to remove the child from school. Respondent did\r\nnot have Client C's permission to write the letter and admits his conduct violated\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct.   Matter IV\r\n\r\nRespondent represented the widow in an estate in which the widow and the\r\ndecedent's child were the only heirs. The probate court removed the widow as\r\npersonal representative, replacing her with the decedent's child. Both heirs agreed\r\nfor respondent to serve as the special administrator.\r\n\r\nAs the special administrator, respondent failed to diligently pursue the closing of\r\nthe estate. The probate court repeatedly wrote respondent in an effort to get him to\r\ntake the steps necessary to close the estate. On one occasion, the court noted\r\nrespondent had failed to respond to an earlier inquiry and, on another occasion, the\r\ncourt threatened to issue a rule to show cause. Eventually, the probate court\r\nadministratively closed the estate with leave to restore.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter V\r\n\r\nRespondent represented Client D at trial on criminal charges. Client D was\r\nconvicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Thereafter, Client D wrote\r\nrespondent twice requesting a complete copy of his file and information about his\r\nappeal. Respondent did not respond to Client D's first two letters.\r\n\r\nMore than a year after the second letter, Client D wrote respondent, again\r\ndemanding his file. In response, respondent wrote Client D indicating the file was\r\ntoo voluminous to mail to the prison and stating he had explained this several times\r\nto Client D's family. Eventually, respondent had the file delivered to the prison.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter VI\r\n\r\nThis matter arises from respondent's representation of a father in a child custody\r\naction. The complaint was filed by the child's mother who appeared pro se\r\nthroughout the litigation.\r\n\nRespondent prepared the proposed order; he failed to submit a copy of the\r\nproposed order to the mother. Further, respondent submitted the proposed final\r\norder to the judge in an untimely manner and accidently failed to include a\r\nrestraining order as well as some details regarding visitation. The order was signed\r\nand filed before respondent realized the omissions in the order.\r\n\r\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall\r\nprovide competent representation to client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with\r\nreasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall\r\nkeep client reasonably informed about the status of matter; lawyer shall promptly\r\ncomply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.7 (lawyer shall not\r\nrepresent client if the representation involves concurrent conflict of interest); Rule\r\n1.16(d) (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall take steps to the extent\r\nreasonably practicable to protect client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice\r\nto client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, and surrendering papers\r\nand property to which client is entitled); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to administration of\r\njustice).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\n\r\n                                     Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand. Accordingly, we\r\naccept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nRespondent shall: 1) pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of\r\nthis matter by ODC and the Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of this\r\nopinion and 2) complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School\r\nwithin one (1) year of the date of this opinion. Respondent shall provide the\r\nCommission with proof of his completion of the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\nProgram Ethics School within ten (10) days of the conclusion of the program.\r\n\r\nFurther, respondent shall retain a law office management advisor approved by the\r\nCommission who shall work with respondent for a period of two (2) years from the\r\ndate of this opinion. The advisor shall conduct a thorough review of respondent's\r\n\nlaw office management practices. Within ninety (90) days of the date of this\r\nopinion, the advisor shall submit a report to the Commission which contains an\r\nanalysis of and recommendations concerning respondent's law office management\r\npractices. For the remainder of the two (2) year period, respondent shall meet with\r\nthe advisor on at least a quarterly basis and the advisor shall submit quarterly\r\nreports concerning the status of respondent's law office management practices to\r\nthe Commission. Respondent shall be responsible for payment of the advisor and\r\nfor timely submission of the advisor's reports. Respondent's failure to comply with\r\nany of the conditions of discipline set forth in this opinion or with the advisor's\r\nrecommendations shall constitute grounds for discipline.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27164","title":"In the Matter of William Ashley Boyd","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27164.pdf","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court disbarred a lawyer.","date":"2012-08-29","type":"opinion","text":"                   THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                        In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n            In the Matter of William Ashley Boyd, Respondent\r\n\r\n            Appellate Case No. 2012-212362\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Opinion No. 27164 \n\r\n                 Submitted July 17, 2012 – Filed August 29, 2012 \n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  DISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n            Lesley M.

The facts, as set forth in the\r\nAgreement, are as follows.             Facts\r\n\r\n                                      Matter I\r\n\r\nComplainant A, the Executive Director for a development corporation, retained\r\nrespondent on June 9, 2010, to foreclose three properties on behalf of the\r\ncorporation. Respondent was to be paid $1,500.00, plus court costs, for each\r\nforeclosure action. Respondent mailed out certified letters to each debtor advising\r\nthey had fifteen days to become current with their monthly payments to the\r\ndevelopment corporation. Two of the debtors paid their arrearages; one debtor, a\r\nfuneral home, did not pay the arrearage.\r\n\r\nRespondent agreed to pursue the foreclosure action against the funeral home and\r\nwas paid $1,650.00 for that representation. At times during the representation,\r\nrespondent assured Complainant A that the foreclosure was proceeding.\r\nRespondent also told Complainant A that he was waiting on a hearing date when,\r\nin fact, he had not filed anything with the court.\r\n\r\nOn August 9, 2010, the Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for\r\nsix months. In the Matter of Boyd, 388 S.C. 516, 697 S.E.2d 603 (2010).\r\nRespondent did not notify Complainant A of his suspension. Instead, respondent\r\noffered advice to Complainant A regarding the foreclosure action while he was\r\nsuspended from the practice of law.\r\n\r\nWhen Complainant A learned respondent had not filed the foreclosure action, he\r\nrequested a refund of the fees paid to respondent. Initially, respondent refused to\r\nrefund the money, stating the fee was non-refundable. In February 2011,\r\nrespondent refunded the money to Complainant A in order to avoid a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter II\r\n\r\nAs noted above, on August 9, 2010, the Court suspended respondent from the\r\npractice of law for six months. Id. He was reinstated to the practice of law on\r\nJune 14, 2011. In the Matter of Boyd, 393 S.C. 159, 711 S.E.2d 898 (2011).\r\n\nPrior to his suspension, respondent worked for a law firm. At the time, a law\r\nstudent named Richard Thomas Roe1 worked at the same firm.\r\n\r\nIn May 2011, Claimant A had a pending matter before the Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission. Michael Petit, Esquire, represented the insurance carrier on Claimant\r\nA's claim.\r\n\r\nOn May 25, 2011, after Richard Thomas Roe was sworn-in as a member of the\r\nSouth Carolina Bar and while respondent was suspended from the practice of law,\r\nrespondent sent a letter to Mr. Petit on behalf of Claimant A under the assumed\r\nname of Tom Roe. The May 25, 2011, letter was on the letterhead of a fictitious\r\nlaw firm that respondent called \"Roe Law, LLC.\" The address on the letterhead\r\nwas respondent's home address. The telephone number on the letterhead was\r\nrespondent's cell phone number. Respondent's May 25, 2011, letter included a\r\nNotice of Appearance on Behalf of Claimant A with the Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission signed by respondent using the assumed name Tom Roe.\r\n\r\nBelieving that respondent was an attorney named Tom Roe, Mr. Petit prepared a\r\nsettlement agreement and forwarded it to respondent at the address on the\r\nletterhead. On May 28, 2011, respondent signed the settlement agreement on\r\nbehalf of Claimant A using the assumed name Tom Roe. The settlement\r\nagreement was filed by Mr. Petit who was unaware at the time that Tom Roe was a\r\nname fabricated by respondent.\r\n\r\nOn June 9, 2011, respondent sent a copy of the Notice of Appearance on Behalf of\r\nClaimant A, signed by respondent using the assumed name Tom Roe, to the\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission by email using the email address which\r\nincluded the phrase \"tomroelaw@.\" The same day, the Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission issued a notice of settlement hearing to be held on June 14, 2011.\r\n\r\nOn June 10, 2011, respondent telephoned the South Carolina Bar from his cell\r\nphone and left a message identifying himself as Tom Roe and requesting an\r\naddress change for bar member Tom Roe. A member of the staff at the Bar\r\nreturned the call and left a voice mail message with instructions about how to\r\nchange the address.\r\n\r\nOn June 13, 2011, respondent faxed a document entitled \"Termination of\r\nAttorney/Client Relationship\" to Mr. Petit under the assumed name Tom Roe. On\r\n\r\n1   Richard Thomas Roe is a pseudonym.\r\n\nJune 14, 2011, the settlement hearing was held by Workers' Compensation\r\nCommissioner Derrick Williams. Claimant A did not appear and no one appeared\r\non his behalf.\r\n\r\nOn June 15, 2011, at approximately 9:00 a.m., respondent called the South\r\nCarolina Bar a second time, falsely represented himself as Tom Roe, and requested\r\nthat the address on file for that attorney be changed. The address respondent\r\nrequested that the Bar use was his home address. At approximately 10:00 a.m. on\r\nJune 15, 2011, Commissioner Williams held a conference call in which he called\r\nthe number in the file for \"Tom Roe.\" Mr. Petit also participated in the conference\r\ncall. Respondent answered the call and falsely identified himself as Tom Roe.\r\nDuring the conference call, respondent falsely stated that he was a graduate of\r\nClemson University and the Charleston School of Law. He gave Commissioner\r\nWilliams the bar number for Richard Thomas Roe.\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 2011, respondent appeared at a rescheduled hearing before\r\nCommissioner Williams, falsely identified himself as Tom Roe, and gave a false\r\nbar number to the commissioner. At that hearing, respondent requested to be\r\nrelieved from representation of Claimant A. Commissioner Williams instructed\r\nrespondent to submit a written motion and proposed order. On June 24, 2011,\r\nrespondent submitted a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Claimant A to the\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission. Respondent signed the name \"Tom Roe\" to\r\nthe motion.                         Matter III\r\n\r\nOn May 20, 2011, and May 31, 2011, while he was suspended from the practice of\r\nlaw, respondent accepted two installment payments of $750.00 from a potential\r\nclient for representation in a criminal matter. At the time respondent accepted the\r\npayment, he did not tell his client that his license to practice law was suspended.\r\nRespondent represents he did not appear in court or draft any legal documents for\r\nthe client while he was suspended.\r\n\r\nRespondent refunded most of the payment to the client immediately after being\r\nplaced on interim suspension on July 14, 2011. In the Matter of Boyd, supra.\r\nRespondent still owes the client $40.00.\r\n\n                                     Matter IV\r\n\r\nMary Doe owned property in Beaufort County. The property was sold by the\r\nBeaufort County Tax Collector's Office. Complainant B subsequently purchased\r\nthe property for $60,000.00 and recorded a quitclaim deed.\r\n\r\nComplainant B retained respondent to bring a quiet title action for the property.\r\nRespondent was paid $750.00 for the representation.\r\n\r\nComplainant B repeatedly asked respondent for updates on his case and received\r\nassurances from respondent that the quiet title case had been commenced and\r\nwould be completed soon. At the time respondent made the representations, no\r\naction had been filed.\r\n\r\nIn May 2011, while suspended from the practice of law, respondent traveled to\r\nFlorence and delivered Complainant B a copy of an \"Order Clearing Title.\" The\r\norder purported to be an order from a Special Referee who respondent represented\r\nto be William Boyce. Respondent prepared the \"Order Clearing Title\" and forged\r\nthe name of an alleged special referee.\r\n\r\nComplainant B retrieved the following documents from the file of the Beaufort\r\nCounty Clerk of Court: 1) Complaint dated July 5, 2011, and filed July 28, 2011;\r\n2) Acceptance of Service dated July 26, 2011, and filed July 29, 2011; and 3)\r\nAnswer by Mary Doe dated July 28, 2011, and filed July 29, 2011. The documents\r\nwere filed by respondent while on interim suspension.\r\n\r\nMary Doe died in 2002. Respondent forged the Acceptance of Service and\r\nAnswer and filed the forged documents with the Beaufort County Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter V\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained to represent a client in a criminal matter. Respondent\r\nquoted the client a fee of $2,000.00. On August 9, 2010, the Court suspended\r\nrespondent from the practice of law for six months. In the Matter of Boyd, supra.\r\nRespondent failed to refund the unearned fees to the client.\r\n\n                                          Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act\r\nwith reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer\r\nshall reasonably consult with client about the means by which the client's\r\nobjectives are to be accomplished and keep client reasonably informed about the\r\nstatus of matter); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation, lawyer shall take\r\nsteps to extent reasonably practicable to protect client's interests, such as refunding\r\nany advance payment of fee that has not been earned); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make\r\nreasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client);\r\nRule 3.3 (lawyer shall not knowingly make false statement of fact to tribunal);\r\nRule 3.4 (lawyer shall not falsify evidence); Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing\r\nclient, lawyer shall not knowingly make false statement of material fact to third\r\nperson); Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the\r\nregulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for lawyer to commit criminal act that reflects adversely\r\non the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects);\r\nRule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct\r\ninvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\r\nadministration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall constitute\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule\r\n7(a)(3) (it shall constitute ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully violate a\r\nvalid order of the Supreme Court); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall constitute ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of\r\njustice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct\r\ndemonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall constitute\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to violate the oath of office taken to practice law\r\nin this state and contained in Rule 402(k), SCACR).\r\n\r\n                                      Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from\r\nthe practice of law in this state, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension,\r\n\nJuly 14, 2011.

Elliott,\r\nand Assistant Attorney General Joshua Richard\r\nUnderwood, all of Office of the Attorney General, of\r\nColumbia, and, Solicitor William Walter Wilkins, III,\r\nof Greenville, all for Respondent.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Anthony Gracely (Appellant) appeals his\r\nconviction for conspiracy to traffic four hundred grams or more of\r\nmethamphetamine in violation of section 44-53-375 of the South Carolina\r\nCode. Appellant argues that the circuit court improperly limited his cross-\r\nexamination of the State's witnesses, thereby violating his rights under the\r\nConfrontation Clause of the United States Constitution. Appellant also\r\nargues that the State did not present sufficient evidence to support his\r\nconviction. We reverse.\r\n\r\n                    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n      In 2008 the State Grand Jury (SGJ) began an investigation, titled\r\n\"Vanilla Ice,\" after a resident of Pickens County approached law enforcement\r\nand provided information regarding the sale of methamphetamine within the\r\ncommunity. On June 10, 2009, the SGJ returned an Indictment alleging fifty-\r\ntwo separate crimes against various individuals. Count Two of the\r\nIndictment alleged that Appellant conspired to sell \"more than four hundred\r\ngrams of methamphetamine.\"1 At trial, the State relied on a \"historical\" case,\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Counts 1, 2, and 3 of the Indictment contained allegations of conspiracy to\r\ntraffic methamphetamine in violation of section 44-53-375(C) of the South\r\nCarolina Code from 2007 to 2009.\r\n\r\n     At the time of trial, Section 44-53-375(C)(5) of the South Carolina\r\nCode provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      A person who knowingly sells, manufacturers, delivers,\r\n      purchases, or brings into this State . . . ten grams or more of\r\n      methamphetamine or cocaine base . . . is guilty of a felony which\r\n      is known as 'trafficking in methamphetamine or cocaine base'\r\n      and, upon conviction, must be punished as follows if the quantity\r\n      involved is:\r\n\nin which the central evidence presented was in the form of testimony from\r\nseven individuals also named in the Indictment. The State offered the\r\ntestimony of Frank Posey, Brian Stegall, Kimberly Taylor, Joel Hall, Stacey\r\nAnderson, Ernest Craft, and Lance Halloway. The defense sought to show\r\nthe potential bias of each witness by presenting to the jury information\r\nregarding the significantly lighter sentences these witnesses received in\r\nexchange for their testimony.\r\n\r\n       Counts One and Two of the Indictment alleged that Frank Posey\r\nconspired to traffic four hundred grams or more of methamphetamine.\r\nDefense counsel asked Posey whether trafficking four hundred grams or\r\nmore of methamphetamine carried a minimum of twenty-five years' and up to\r\nthirty years' imprisonment. Posey replied \"true.\" The State objected, and the\r\ncourt instructed defense counsel that the State's witnesses could be\r\nquestioned about the maximum punishment, but not the mandatory minimum\r\npunishment, for those charges they had in common with Appellant. Posey\r\nadmitted under cross-examination that the State allowed him to plead guilty\r\nto a first offense of trafficking ten to twenty-eight grams of\r\nmethamphetamine in exchange for his cooperation. The state recommended\r\na sentence of five years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n       Count One of the Indictment alleged that Bryan Stegall conspired to\r\ntraffic four hundred grams of methamphetamine. Count Forty-four of the\r\nIndictment alleged that Stegall distributed methamphetamine on March 19,\r\n2008.2 Stegall testified that Appellant would \"front\"3 him methamphetamine\r\n\r\n     (5) four hundred grams or more, a term of imprisonment of not\r\n     less than twenty-five years nor more than thirty years with a\r\n     mandatory minimum of term of imprisonment of twenty-five\r\n     years, no part of which may be suspended nor probation granted,\r\n     and a fine of two hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-375(C)(5) (Supp. 2005 & Supp. 2010) (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n2 The Indictment alleged that several of the witness distributed\r\nmethamphetamine. Unless otherwise indicated the Indictment alleged that\r\nthe witnesses violated section 44-53-375(B) of the South Carolina Code.\r\n\nfor his own use, and to sell on Appellant's behalf. Stegall testified that he\r\nwould also bring other individuals to Appellant to buy methamphetamine,\r\nand in return Appellant would give Stegall a proportionate amount of drugs.\r\nStegall testified that, in exchange for his cooperation, the State allowed him\r\nto plead guilty to a first offense of trafficking ten grams, but less than twenty-\r\neight grams, of methamphetamine. This charge carried a sentence of no less\r\nthan three years but a maximum of ten years' imprisonment. Additionally,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      That section provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      A person who . . . distributes . . . methamphetamine or cocaine\r\n      base, in violation of the provisions of Section 44-53-370, is guilty\r\n      of a felony . . . . Possession of one or more grams of\r\n      methamphetamine or cocaine base is prima facie evidence of a\r\n      violation of this subsection.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 44-53-375(B) (Supp. 2005). In 2009, at the time of the\r\nIndictment, the statue provided that a first offense must be punished by a\r\nterm of imprisonment of not more than fifteen years or fined not more than\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars, or both. Id. Upon conviction of a second\r\noffense the statute directed the court to sentence the offender to \"not less than\r\nfive years nor more than thirty years.\" Id. The court could also fine the\r\noffender fifty thousand dollars in lieu of imprisonment, or impose both\r\npenalties. Id. For a third or subsequent offense, the statute provided that the\r\noffender \"be imprisoned not less than fifteen years nor more than thirty years,\r\nor fined not more than fifty thousand dollars, or both.\" Id. In 2010, the\r\nGeneral Assembly modified the statute and reduced the mandatory minimum\r\nsentence for a third offense to ten years. Id. § 44-53-375(B) (Supp. 2010).\r\n3 \"Fronting\" provides a convenient basis for the government to establish a\r\nconspiracy between those engaged in the drug trade. The party providing the\r\ndrugs will give the receiving party the product essentially on credit. The\r\nreceiving party will then pay for the drugs following re-distribution, thereby\r\ncreating a fund with which to pay for the drugs. See, e.g., United States v.\r\nFerguson, 35 F.3d 327, 331–32 (7th Cir. 1994); State v. Hammitt, 341 S.C.\r\n638, 645, 535 S.E.2d 459, 463 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\nthe State allowed Stegall to plead guilty to a first offense of distribution of\r\nmethamphetamine, despite previous convictions for possession and\r\npossession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Stegall testified that\r\nhe originally faced up to thirty years' imprisonment for trafficking more than\r\nfour hundred grams of methamphetamine and that he could have been\r\ncharged in Count Two, with Appellant, and faced up to another thirty years'\r\nimprisonment. Defense counsel also elicited testimony from Stegall that he\r\nwould have faced another thirty years' imprisonment because the current\r\ncharges would have constituted his third offense for distribution of\r\nmethamphetamine. Instead, the State recommended that Stegall receive a\r\nfifteen year sentence for these charges in exchange for his testimony.\r\n\r\n       Following Stegall's testimony, defense counsel requested the trial court\r\nreconsider the cross-examination limitations. According to the defense, it\r\nwas critical to present to the jury the possible credibility issues with a witness\r\nthat they knew would go to jail \"for twenty-five years at eighty-five percent.\"\r\nThe State argued that revealing the mandatory minimum sentence would\r\nprejudice the prosecution because the jury would understand that \"they're\r\ngoing to be putting a man in jail for twenty-five years.\" The court agreed\r\nwith the State:\r\n\r\n      Well, I believe that . . . with your skills that you'll be able to cross\r\n      examine these witnesses sufficiently, showing the amount of time\r\n      they could get. I believe to bring up a minimum sentence, even\r\n      though your intent is to impeach this witness, the ripple effect is\r\n      that it's going to, I think, prejudice the State because of what the\r\n      jury is going to now have in their mind, that if we convict this\r\n      person, it's going to be a twenty-five year [sentence].\r\n\r\n      The court also ruled that defense counsel could question the State's\r\nwitnesses regarding the mandatory minimum sentences they avoided for\r\nthose crimes in which the Appellant was not also charged.\r\n\r\n       Count Three of the Indictment alleged that Kimberly Taylor conspired\r\nto traffic four hundred or more grams of methamphetamine. Counts Twenty-\r\ntwo and Twenty-three of the Indictment alleged that Taylor knowingly\r\ndistributed methamphetamine on May 19 and June 2, 2008. Taylor testified\r\n\nthat she purchased methamphetamine from Lance Holloway, and that\r\nAppellant provided Holloway drugs for re-distribution and sale. She\r\ndescribed a drug transaction in which Appellant provided two ounces of\r\nmethamphetamine to Holloway and in turn Taylor purchased one of those\r\nounces to use and resell. Taylor also testified that Holloway and Gracely\r\nsold Taylor's ex-boyfriend an ounce of methamphetamine for $1,600. In\r\nexchange for her cooperation, Taylor pled guilty to a second offense of\r\ntrafficking twenty-eight to one hundred grams of methamphetamine and\r\nreceived a twenty year sentence. Taylor admitted to three prior convictions\r\nfor drugs including cocaine and marijuana. Taylor admitted under cross-\r\nexamination that she did not identify Appellant until after accepting a plea\r\ndeal. Defense counsel also pointed out that Taylor faced a minimum of thirty\r\nyears' and a maximum of ninety years' imprisonment before accepting a plea\r\ndeal for a twenty year sentence in exchange for cooperating with the State.\r\n\r\n      Counts Two and Three of the Indictment alleged that Joel Hall\r\nconspired to traffic four hundred or more grams of methamphetamine.\r\nCounts Twenty-five, Twenty-six, and Twenty-seven of the Indictment\r\nalleged that Hall distributed methamphetamine on April 1, 22, and 30, 2008.\r\nHall testified that on one occasion he purchased half an ounce of\r\nmethamphetamine from Appellant. In exchange for his cooperation, the State\r\nallowed Hall to plead guilty to a first offense of trafficking ten to twenty-\r\neight grams of methamphetamine and a first offense of distribution of\r\nmethamphetamine, and gave Hall a favorable sentencing recommendation of\r\nten years' imprisonment. Hall had previously been convicted of possession of\r\nmarijuana and obtaining controlled substances through fraud. Defense\r\ncounsel pointed out that Hall faced a minimum of fifteen years'\r\nimprisonment, and a possibility of over one hundred years' imprisonment if\r\nconvicted of the original charges.\r\n\r\n       Count Two of the Indictment alleged that Stacey Anderson conspired to\r\ntraffic four hundred or more grams of methamphetamine. Counts Nine and\r\nTen of the Indictment alleged that Anderson distributed methamphetamine on\r\nFebruary 10 and May 7, 2008. Anderson testified that he regularly sold\r\nmethamphetamine for $1,450 per ounce, and that Appellant owed him $7,300\r\nfor methamphetamine. In exchange for his testimony, Anderson pled guilty\r\nto trafficking twenty-eight to one hundred grams of methamphetamine and a\r\n\nfirst offense of distribution of methamphetamine. Anderson received this\r\ndeal despite his prior convictions for possession with intent to distribute.\r\nAnderson testified that in exchange for his cooperation he would receive a\r\nfifteen year prison sentence to run concurrently with federal gun charges.\r\n\r\n       Count Two of the Indictment alleged that Ernest Craft conspired to\r\ntraffic four hundred or more grams of methamphetamine. Count Twenty-one\r\nof the Indictment alleged that Craft distributed methamphetamine on June 5,\r\n2008. Craft testified that he observed methamphetamine in Appellant's\r\npossession, and witnessed Appellant sell methamphetamine. Craft also\r\ntestified that Anderson supplied Appellant with methamphetamine. Because\r\nhe cooperated with the State's prosecution of Appellant, Craft pled guilty to\r\ntrafficking a lesser amount of methamphetamine, twenty-eight to one\r\nhundred grams. Craft also pled guilty to a first offense of distribution of\r\nmethamphetamine despite numerous prior convictions for possession of\r\nmethamphetamine. Defense counsel pointed out that Craft faced sixty years'\r\nimprisonment before the State offered him a fifteen year sentence in\r\nexchange for his cooperation.\r\n\r\n       Counts Two and Three of the Indictment alleged that Lance Holloway\r\nconspired to traffic four hundred grams of methamphetamine. Count Twenty\r\nof the Indictment alleged that Holloway distributed methamphetamine on\r\nAugust 1, 2008. Holloway testified that between June 2007 and February\r\n2008 he and Appellant sold methamphetamine together at a rate of one and a\r\nhalf to two ounces per week. Holloway faced thirty years' imprisonment for\r\neach trafficking count, and an additional fifteen to thirty years' imprisonment\r\nfor distribution. Thus, Holloway could have been sentenced to between\r\nseventy five years' to ninety years' imprisonment. However, like Craft,\r\nHolloway pled guilty to trafficking a lower amount of methamphetamine.\r\nAdditionally, the State allowed Holloway to plead guilty to a first offense of\r\ndistribution of methamphetamine, despite prior convictions for drug offenses\r\nincluding possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Holloway received a\r\ntwelve year sentence for his cooperation.\r\n\r\n      Following the conclusion of the State's case, defense counsel moved for\r\na directed verdict. The court denied the motion, and the jury found Appellant\r\nguilty of conspiracy to traffic four hundred or more grams of\r\n\nmethamphetamine. The court sentenced Appellant to twenty-eight years'\r\nimprisonment. Appellant appealed, and this Court certified the case pursuant\r\nto Rule 204(b), SCACR.     ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n   I.\t    Whether the trial court improperly limited the scope of defense\r\n          counsel's cross-examination of the State's witnesses.\r\n\r\n   II.\t   Whether the trial court erred in denying Appellant's motion for a\r\n          directed verdict.\r\n\r\n                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n      This Court will not disturb a trial court's ruling concerning the scope of\r\ncross-examination of a witness to test his or her credibility, or to show\r\npossible bias or self-interest in testifying, absent a manifest abuse of\r\ndiscretion. State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114, 124–25, 525 S.E.2d 519, 524\r\n(2000) (citing State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 551, 446 S.E.2d 411, 413–14\r\n(1994)). When reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict, this\r\nCourt employs the same standard as the trial court by viewing the evidence\r\nand all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\nparty. Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, 336 S.C.\r\n373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999). The trial court will only be reversed\r\nwhen there is no evidence to support the ruling below. See Creech v. S.C.\r\nWildlife & Marine Res. Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997).\r\n\r\n                              LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.\t    Whether the trial court improperly limited the scope of defense\r\n          counsel's cross-examination of the State's witnesses.\r\n\r\n     Appellant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defense\r\ncounsel to cross-examine the State's witnesses regarding the mandatory\r\nminimum sentences they avoided by testifying against Appellant. We agree.\r\n\n   A. Cross Examination\r\n\r\n       The Confrontation Clause provides \"in all criminal prosecutions, the\r\naccused shall enjoy the right to . . . be confronted with the witnesses against\r\nhim.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI. The Confrontation Clause guarantees a\r\ndefendant the opportunity to cross-examine a witness concerning bias. State\r\nv. Clark, 315 S.C. 478, 481, 445 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1994) (citing State v.\r\nBrown, 303 S.C. 169, 171, 399 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1991)). A defendant\r\ndemonstrates a Confrontation Clause violation when he is prohibited from\r\n\"engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a\r\nprototypical form of bias . . . from which jurors . . . could draw inferences\r\nrelating to the reliability of the witness.\" State v. Stokes, 381 S.C. 390, 401–\r\n02, 673 S.E.2d 434, 439 (2009) (citing Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S.\r\n673, 680 (1986)) (alteration in original).\r\n\r\n       In State v. Brown, 303 S.C. 169, 399 S.E.2d 593 (1991), one of the\r\nState's chief witnesses, Yolanda Bethel, testified that at the request of a man\r\nnamed \"Henry,\" she agreed to transport a quantity of cocaine from Miami,\r\nFlorida to Charleston, South Carolina. Id. at 170, 399 S.E.2d at 594. Upon\r\nher arrival, police apprehended Bethel and discovered a large quantity of\r\ncocaine in her suitcase. Id. at 170–71, 399 S.E.2d at 594. Bethel agreed to\r\ncooperate with law enforcement by contacting the defendant and\r\naccompanying the agents to deliver the suitcase to him. Id. at 171, 399\r\nS.E.2d at 594.\r\n\r\n        Bethel testified that in return for her cooperation, she was allowed to\r\nplead guilty to one conspiracy charge for which she would receive a\r\nmaximum sentence of seven and one-half years' imprisonment. Id. On cross-\r\nexamination, Bethel admitted that she was originally charged with trafficking\r\nin cocaine, but that the charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement. Id.\r\nDefense counsel attempted to elicit from Bethel the punishment for\r\ntrafficking in cocaine, but the trial judge sustained the prosecutor's objection\r\nto the line of questioning. Id. The defendant appealed and argued that the\r\ntrial judge abused its discretion in limiting the cross-examination. Id.\r\n\n     This Court held that this limitation unfairly prejudiced the\r\ndefendant:\r\n\r\n      The sentence for trafficking in cocaine in the amount in question\r\n      here is a mandatory one of at least twenty-five years without\r\n      parole . . . . The fact Bethel was permitted to avoid a mandatory\r\n      prison term of more than three times the duration she would face\r\n      on her plea to conspiracy is critical evidence of potential bias that\r\n      [defendant] should have been permitted to present to the jury.\r\n      Moreover, Bethel's testimony was a crucial part of the State's\r\n      case since she provided the only evidence of [defendant]'s\r\n      knowing involvement in the drug transaction. We reject the\r\n      State's argument that inquiry into the punishment was properly\r\n      excluded because it would have allowed the jury to learn of\r\n      [defendant]'s own potential sentence if convicted. We conclude\r\n      appellant's right to meaningful cross-examination outweighs the\r\n      State's interest here.\r\n\r\nId. at 171–72, 399 S.E.2d at 594.\r\n\r\n       The facts of the instant case are similar. Each of the State's witnesses\r\nfaced a mandatory minimum sentence significantly longer than the sentence\r\nthey received in exchange for their cooperation. The trial court allowed\r\ndefense counsel to cross-examine the witnesses regarding possible bias, but\r\nimproperly prevented questioning which would have examined the extent of\r\nthat bias and the witnesses' possible motivations for testifying against\r\nAppellant.\r\n\r\n      In order to secure a conviction in the instant case, the State made\r\ncertain \"deals\" with cooperating witnesses. The State allowed Posey to plead\r\nguilty to a lesser trafficking charge which carries a mandatory minimum of\r\nthree years' imprisonment. This plea deal did not merely allow Posey to\r\navoid the possibility that upon conviction he might be sentenced to the\r\nmaximum thirty years' imprisonment. Instead, Posey avoided the possibility\r\nthat upon conviction he would be sentenced to no less than twenty-five years'\r\nimprisonment. Stegall avoided the same twenty-five year mandatory\r\nminimum sentence, and received a fifteen year sentence, for both trafficking\r\n\nand distributing methamphetamine, in exchange for his cooperation. The\r\njury heard testimony that Hall avoided the maximum thirty year sentence\r\nassociated with the two trafficking counts alleged in the Indictment.\r\nHowever, due to the trial court's limitation, the jury did not hear that Hall\r\nactually received ten years' imprisonment instead of the mandatory minimum.\r\nDefense counsel could not present to the jury that both Anderson and Taylor\r\navoided the mandatory minimum twenty-five years' imprisonment by\r\npleading guilty to lesser offenses. Craft received a ten year sentence and\r\nHolloway received a twelve year sentence in exchange for their testimony.\r\nHowever, although defense counsel presented to the jury that both witnesses\r\navoided the maximum sentence for their respective charges, counsel could\r\nnot show that they actually faced a twenty-five year mandatory minimum.\r\nThe sentences received by many of these witnesses are not only far lower\r\nthan the maximum sentence, within a judge's discretion, but are far lower\r\nthan the mandatory minimum, in which a judge has no discretion. The trial\r\ncourt's instruction improperly prevented Appellant from demonstrating the\r\npossible bias rising from these plea deals through an examination reaching\r\nthe requisite degree of granularity.\r\n\r\n      To the extent our directive in Brown was unclear, the instant case\r\nprovides an opportunity to clarify. The fact that a cooperating witness\r\navoided a mandatory minimum sentence is critical information that a\r\ndefendant must be allowed to present to the jury.4\r\n\r\n\r\n4 It is important to note that when defense counsel asked Posey whether\r\ntrafficking four hundred grams or more of methamphetamine carried a\r\nminimum of twenty-five years' and up to thirty years' imprisonment he\r\nanswered \"true.\" It is of no moment that at some point during the\r\nproceedings one of the witnesses confirmed the existence of a mandatory\r\nminimum sentence. The fact remains that Appellant was unable to fully\r\ndevelop this information through the cross-examination of Posey, and was\r\nexpressly forbidden from doing so with regard to the State's remaining\r\nwitnesses. Moreover, the trial court limited Appellant's cross-examination\r\nbased on reasoning this Court has explicitly declined to adopt. See Brown,\r\n303 S.C. at 171–72, 399 S.E.2d at 594 (\"We reject the State's argument that\r\ninquiry into the punishment was properly excluded because it would have\r\n\n   B. Harmless Error\r\n\r\n      A violation of the Confrontation Clause is not per se reversible but is\r\nsubject to a harmless error analysis. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 680 (1986).\r\n\r\n      Whether such an error is harmless in a particular case depends\r\n      upon a host of factors . . . . The factors include the importance of\r\n      the witness's testimony in the prosecution's case, whether the\r\n      testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence\r\n      corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on\r\n      material points, the extent of cross examination otherwise\r\n      permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution's\r\n      case.\r\n\r\nId. at 684 (emphasis added). See State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385, 444\r\nS.E.2d 525, 527 (1994) (\"The list of factors as set out in Van Arsdall is not\r\nexhaustive.\"). Given the State's heavy reliance on circumstantial evidence,\r\nand the abysmal credibility of the State's witnesses, the error in this case was\r\nnot harmless.\r\n\r\n      In State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002), this Court\r\napplied the Van Arsdall factors. In that case, Jamie and Jimmie Mizell (the\r\ndefendants) were convicted of second degree burglary and grand larceny. Id.\r\nat 329, 563 S.E.2d at 316. The State's key witness, Donald Steele, testified\r\nthat he accompanied the defendants to the site of the crime and explained\r\nhow defendants entered the home, and what was taken. Id. at 330, 563\r\nS.E.2d at 317. On cross-examination, Steele admitted that the State charged\r\nhim with the same crimes as the defendants, but the trial court excluded\r\nevidence of the possible sentence he faced. Id. Steele admitted that if he had\r\nnot cooperated with the State he would have faced \"a long sentence.\" Id.\r\nHowever, Steele would have actually faced a maximum of life in prison had\r\nhe been convicted of the charges he originally faced. Id. at 334–35, 563\r\nS.E.2d at 319.\r\n\r\nallowed the jury to learn of [defendant]'s own potential sentence if\r\nconvicted.\").\r\n\n      This Court noted that the State presented testimony from the victim and\r\nthe police that supported Steele's testimony. As a result, much of the\r\ndisputed testimony was cumulative or corroborated by other witnesses. Id. at\r\n334, 563 S.E.2d at 319. The State did not present any physical evidence\r\ntying the defendants to the scene of the crime. Id. Therefore, Steele's\r\neyewitness testimony was the only evidence linking the defendants to the\r\ncrime, but the trial court allowed only a limited examination of Steele's\r\npossible bias. Id. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319. However, if the jury found\r\nSteele unbelievable, there would be no other evidence before them tying the\r\ndefendant's to the scene of the crime. Thus, the trial court's error was not\r\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 335, 563 S.E.2d at 320.\r\n\r\n      In the instant case, the State presented cumulative testimony regarding\r\nAppellant's involvement in trafficking four hundred or more grams of\r\nmethamphetamine. However, the testimony presented only corroborated\r\nother testimony, and the State chose not to present any physical evidence\r\ntying Appellant to the activities charged. This strategic decision enhanced\r\nthe importance of that testimony, and the necessity that Appellant be\r\npermitted to demonstrate any bias on the part of the State's witnesses. The\r\nstrength of the State's case relied on credibility determinations uniformly\r\napplicable to the witnesses presented. Thus, if the jury found the mandatory\r\nminimum issue affected one witness's credibility, that determination could\r\nhave likely affected the believability as to all of the State's witnesses facing\r\nthe same mandatory minimum sentence. Moreover, there was no other\r\nevidence to link Appellant to the indicted offense.\r\n\r\n      Finally, the background of the witnesses in this case should have\r\ncautioned the trial court against limiting Appellant's cross examination. As\r\nwe observed in State v. Davis, 371 S.C. 170, 638 S.E.2d 57 (2006):\r\n\r\n      Moreover, there are significant credibility problems with the fact\r\n      witnesses . . . . All were involved with crack cocaine on the night\r\n      in question and did not initially give informative statements to the\r\n      authorities. Often, cooperation with police on this investigation\r\n      came only after several witnesses had been jailed on other\r\n      charges and were facing prison time themselves.\r\n\nId. at 182, 638 S.E.2d at 63–64. Analogously, all of the witnesses in\r\nthe present case had significant involvement with illegal drugs and\r\nother criminal activities, and cooperated following arrest and the\r\npossibility of long prison terms. In a case built on circumstantial\r\nevidence, including testimony from witnesses with such suspect\r\ncredibility, a ruling preventing a full picture of the possible bias of\r\nthose witnesses cannot be harmless. Based on the Record before this\r\nCourt, it is impossible to conclude that the trial court's error did not\r\ncontribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Clark, 315\r\nS.C. 478, 484, 445 S.E.2d 633, 636 (1994) (\"The reviewing court must\r\nreview the entire record to determine what effect the error had on the\r\nverdict.\") (Toal, J. dissenting). Thus, reversal is required.5\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

On appeal, he contests only the denial of\r\nhis motion to set aside. We affirm.\r\n\n                                   FACTS\r\n\r\n       Warren is a state bail bondsman, and respondent is also in the bond\r\nbusiness. Warren agreed to be responsible if a mutual client forfeited a\r\nsurety bond issued by respondent. In October 2006, respondent obtained a\r\n$5,120.00 judgment against Warren after the client forfeited. In August\r\n2007, the clerk issued a Judgment Execution, and on September 19, 2007, the\r\nsheriff issued an Execution Account Statement. In this statement, he reported\r\nreceiving a $1,000 payment from Warren, from which he deducted his $52.50\r\nfee, leaving $947.50 to be applied against the debt. After deducting the\r\n$947.50 and adding the interest accrued as of September 19, 2007, Warren's\r\njudgment debt stood at $4,705.15.\r\n\r\n       In January 2008, respondent brought an action to foreclose its judgment\r\nlien. Warren did not answer, and on May 6, 2008, the clerk granted\r\nrespondent's motions, ordering entry of the default against Warren, and\r\nreferring the matter to the Master-in-Equity. On June 8, 2008, the Master\r\nissued an order foreclosing respondent's judgment lien and ordering a judicial\r\nsale of real property owned by Warren on July 7, 2008. On the sales day,\r\nWarren went to the sheriff's office and tendered the amount due ($5,343.82)\r\nunder the original judgment, not the amount then due in light of the\r\naccumulated interest and other fees ($7,693.31).1 On July 18, the Master\r\nissued a deed to respondent, who bought all of Warren's properties, which\r\nwere sold at the sale as a single lot for $2,500. This left a deficiency of\r\n$5,193.31.2\r\n\r\n     In October 2008, Warren filed a motion to set aside the default order\r\nunder Rule 55(c) and/or Rule 60(b), and to set aside the foreclosure deed.\r\n\r\n     The Master denied all relief requested by Warren. He also denied\r\nWarren's request to reconsider his decision, and this appeal follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Warren has been refunded the $5,343.82.\r\n2   No deficiency judgment was requested.\r\n\n                                    ISSUES\r\n\r\n            1. \tDid the Master err in refusing to set aside the judgment\r\n                sale because the selling price was grossly inadequate?\r\n\r\n            2. \tDid the Master err in refusing to set aside the sale\r\n                because he sold the properties as a single lot?\r\n\r\n                                  ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n    1. Inadequate sales price\r\n\r\n       Warren argues that the Master erred in refusing to set aside the judicial\r\nsale because the bid at the sale was grossly inadequate. The Master denied\r\nthis request, finding the price was not so grossly inadequate as to require the\r\nsale be set aside. Warren contends this was error. We disagree.\r\n\r\n      The Master found that the tax assessment records submitted by Warren3\r\nreflecting a combined value of $263,121 for the 13 tracts were sufficient to\r\nestablish that sum as the value of the properties sold. He concluded that\r\ncomparing the selling price of only $2,500 to the $263,121 assessed value of\r\nthe property established that on its face the sales price would shock the\r\nconscience because of its gross inadequacy. See Poole v. Jefferson Stand.\r\nLife Ins. Co., 174 S.C. 150, 177 S.E. 24 (1934). The Master went on to find\r\nthat Warren also presented evidence that some of the properties are subject to\r\nmortgage liens totaling more than $88,000 and that all the lots are subject to a\r\nfederal tax lien in excess of $12,000. The Master also found that all thirteen\r\nproperties were pledged as collateral to secure bonds issued by Warren in the\r\ncourse of his bail bondsman business.4 Finally, citing In re Barr, 170 B.R.\r\n772 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1994) (a case applying Poole), he held that ad valorem\r\ntaxes could be considered as affecting value, although he did not do so in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n3 The actual records were not submitted until the post-trial motion but\r\nWarren's affidavit attached to his original motion asserted this valuation.\r\n4 There is no evidence in the record indicating what this amount is.\r\n\n       Since the properties sold remained encumbered by the mortgages\r\n($88,000) and the tax liens ($12,000), the Master added $100,000 to the sales\r\nprice for a total of $102,500.5 The Master concluded that the newly\r\ncalculated sales price of $102,500 represented about 39% of the assessed\r\nvalue of the properties, a figure which did not justify setting aside the sale.\r\n\r\n      Warren argues on appeal that the Master erred in not judging\r\ninadequacy by directly comparing the sales price to the properties' value,\r\nwithout considering mortgages or liens. He cites Investor Savings Bank v.\r\nPhelps, 303 S.C. 15, 397 S.E.2d 780 (Ct. App. 1990), and Wells Fargo Bank,\r\nN.A. v. Turner, 378 S.C. 147, 662 S.E.2d 424 (2008), for the proposition that\r\na property's value should not be discounted by a mortgage. Under the\r\ncircumstances of this case, we disagree.\r\n\r\n       In Phelps, the mortgagee bid $500 at the foreclosure sale of its\r\nmortgage. On the thirtieth day after the sale, a stranger to the mortgage\r\nentered an upset bid of $510. See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-39-720 (2005). The\r\nmortgagee then moved to set aside the stranger's bid as grossly inadequate,\r\nthe Master agreed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Phelps court held\r\nthat the mortgage amount was competent evidence of the property's value,\r\ncompared it to the upset bid price of $510, and concluded that a bid of\r\napproximately 1.5% of the property's value was unconscionable. See also\r\nWells Fargo, supra (mortgage value is evidence of property's value).\r\n\r\n       In both Phelps and Wells Fargo the judicial sale was to foreclose a\r\nmortgage rather than a sale in execution of a judgment. The effect of a\r\nmortgage foreclosure sale is to remove the mortgage encumbrance from the\r\nproperty, and therefore the amount of the mortgage is a fair gauge of the\r\nproperty’s value in the hands of the buyer. In a judgment execution sale such\r\nas this, however, the buyer takes the property subject to the mortgage as well\r\nas other liens. E.g., Norman v. Norman, 26 S.C. 41, 11 S.E. 1096 (1886).\r\nThe Master properly considered the amount of the mortgages and tax liens in\r\ndetermining the true value of the properties to the buyer at an execution sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n5The propriety of this method of calculating value is not challenged on\r\nappeal.\r\n\n      Warren has not met his burden of showing an abuse of discretion in the\r\nMaster's finding that respondent's bid is not so grossly inadequate as to shock\r\nthe conscience. E.g., Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 544 S.E.2d 620\r\n(2001) (appellant in equity matter has burden of persuading appellate court of\r\nreversible error). This is especially so since the Master's calculations did not\r\naccount for the properties' taxes due6 or for the fact the properties were all\r\npledged as collateral for Warren’s bail bonds. Warren failed to demonstrate\r\ngross inadequacy in the sales price as the record is devoid of evidence of the\r\ntrue value of the properties. Pinckney, supra.\r\n\r\n     2. Master's error\r\n\r\n      Warren contends that even if we agree the sales price is not grossly\r\ninadequate, the Master erred in not setting aside the sale based on his\r\ndecision to sell the thirteen properties as a single lot rather than individually.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n       Warren concedes, as he must, that the Master had the authority to sell\r\nthe properties as a single lot. The order referring the matter to the Master\r\nauthorized him to \"sell the properties (i) in bulk or (ii) in parcels, or (iii) in\r\nlots in such a sequence as he shall determine until such time as the net\r\nproceeds realized from such sale(s) shall equal the gross amount due\r\n[respondent], including accrued interest, expense of sale, and commissions.\"\r\nThe Master found he did not abuse his discretion since a bulk sale was\r\nspecifically permitted and since respondent, who attended the sale, requested\r\nthat he sell the properties in bulk. We agree.\r\n\r\n        At oral argument, Warren contended the Master should have conducted\r\na title search, discovered what liens attached to which parcel, determined the\r\n\"true value\" of each property, and then devised an order of sale that would\r\nsatisfy the debt. We know of no authority which either requires or permits\r\nthe Master to do this research and calculation. The individual conducting the\r\njudicial sale is not acting in a judicial capacity but rather \"in a ministerial\r\ncapacity as the arm of the court to carry out its orders . . . .\" Ex parte Keller,\r\n185 S.C. 283, 194 S.E. 15 (1937). While the Master was authorized to sell\r\n\r\n6   Warren's evidence showed delinquent taxes of $6,372.33 for 2007.\r\n\nonly so many of the lots as were necessary to satisfy the debt, it was not his\r\nobligation to research and calculate the value of each individual property.\r\nCompare Rule 71(a), SCRCP (“Any party who has appeared in the\r\n[foreclosure] action may present proof that the debt may be satisfied by\r\nselling property in parcels, rather than selling the whole to satisfy the\r\nclaims.”)\r\n\r\n       We can find no abuse of discretion in the Master's decision to sell the\r\nproperties as a lot. Warren had defaulted, and at the time the sale was held\r\nthe Master had before him no evidence of the value of any single tract, much\r\nless their collective value. Even at this juncture, the true value of the\r\nproperties even after deducting mortgages and tax liens is unclear, as it\r\nappears they remain encumbered as collateral for Warren's bonds and that\r\nthey are subject to tax delinquencies. Warren has not met his burden of\r\ndemonstrating reversible error. Pinckney, supra.\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      The Master's order is\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in result only.\r\nBEATTY, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which HEARN, J.,\r\nconcurs.\r\n\n       JUSTICE BEATTY: I dissent. I would find that the Master-in-\r\nEquity abused his discretion and reverse his decision not to set aside the\r\njudgment sale. The Master's decision to sell thirteen separate parcels as a\r\nsingle lot was based on an error of law. The Master sold these thirteen\r\nseparate parcels in one lot because he erroneously believed that he had no\r\nchoice but to grant the request of the judgment creditor to sell the properties\r\nas one lot. This decision clearly ignores the tenets of Rule 71(b) and the\r\norder of reference. Both Rule 71(b) and the order of reference authorize the\r\nsale of the property or parts thereof as required to satisfy the claims [Rule\r\n71(b)], or until such time as the net proceeds realized from the sale(s) shall\r\nequal the gross amount due plaintiff [order of reference]. Certainly, the sale\r\nof thirteen separate parcels valued in excess of $260,000 as a single lot was\r\nnot required to satisfy a $7,693 judgment.\r\n\r\n      The Master's machinations with the value of each lot and the sale price\r\nare unpersuasive. Rule 71(b) and the order of reference grant the Master\r\ndiscretion in how to proceed with the sale but, at the same time, limit the\r\namount of the judgment debtor's property that can be sold. To sell more than\r\nis required to do equity violates the rule, the order of reference, and principles\r\nof equity.\r\n\r\n        Moreover, there is no evidence in this record that indicates the Master\r\nexercised his discretion. In fact, the only evidence is that the Master\r\nmistakenly believed he had no discretion. The failure to exercise discretion is\r\nan abuse of discretion. See Balloon Plantation, Inc. v. Head Balloons, Inc.,\r\n303 S.C. 152, 155, 399 S.E. 2d 439, 441 (1990) (\"It is an equal abuse of\r\ndiscretion to refuse to exercise discretionary authority when it is warranted as\r\nit is to exercise the discretion improperly.\" (quoting State v.

Stilwell, Post-Conviction Relief Judge\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Opinion No. 27167 \n\r\n   Submitted August 22, 2012 – Filed August 29, 2012 \n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AFFIRMED \n\r\n\r\n\r\nChief Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of South\r\nCarolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of\r\nAppellate Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\nGeneral John McIntosh, Senior Assistant Deputy\r\nAttorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant\r\nAttorney General Karen Christine Ratigan, all of\r\nColumbia, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari to review the denial of his\r\napplication for post-conviction relief (PCR). We grant the petition, dispense with\r\nfurther briefing, and affirm the order of the PCR judge as modified.\r\n\r\nPetitioner pled guilty to second degree burglary. He was sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for fifteen years, suspended on service of one year and three years of\r\nprobation. No direct appeal was taken. At a subsequent probation revocation\r\nhearing, the revocation judge revoked eight years of petitioner's probationary\r\nsentence. No appeal was taken from the probation revocation.\r\n\r\nOn PCR, petitioner alleged he was denied his right to appeal the probation\r\nrevocation. The PCR judge found there were no appealable issues to raise on\r\nappeal from the probation revocation hearing and dismissed petitioner's allegation\r\nthat he was denied his right to a direct appeal.\r\n\r\nProbation revocation counsel is not required to inform a probationer of the right to\r\nan appeal absent extraordinary circumstances. Turner v. State, 384 S.C. 451, 682\r\nS.E.2d 792 (2009). However, when a criminal defendant requests an appeal, but\r\ncounsel fails to file an appeal, counsel is deemed deficient. In such a case, the\r\ndefendant is entitled to a belated appeal without showing the appeal would likely\r\nhave had merit. Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470 (2000); Rodriquez v. United\r\nStates, 395 U.S. 327 (1969). Accordingly, the PCR judge erred in finding\r\npetitioner was required to show there were appealable issues in order to support his\r\nallegation that he was denied his right to an appeal from the probation revocation.\r\n\r\nWe note that there were no objections made at the probation revocation hearing.\r\nAccordingly, no issues are preserved for appellate review. State v. Bickham, 381\r\nS.C. 143, 672 S.E.2d 105 (2009) (arguments not raised below are not preserved for\r\nappellate review). We hold that the error by the PCR judge was harmless as an\r\nappeal from the probation revocation would be to no avail because the circuit court\r\nhad subject matter jurisdiction to revoke petitioner’s probation and no issue was\r\npreserved for appellate review.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
