STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn January 4, 1994, a Sumter County grand jury indicted petitioner\r\nRaymond Weinhauer, Jr., for numerous criminal offenses including first and\r\nsecond degree burglary. On January 28, 1994, petitioner pleaded guilty to\r\nseveral counts in the indictment including two counts of second degree burglary. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCount six of the indictment, as presented to the grand jury, stated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBurglary -- First Degree -- That one RAYMOND WARREN\r\nWEINHAUER, JR. did in Sumter County on or about October 26,\r\n1992, wilfully and unlawfully enter the dwelling of Scott Stone\r\nwithout consent and with intent to commit a crime therein, and the\r\ndefendant entered or remained therein in the nighttime. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCount eight of the indictment stated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBurglary -- Second Degree -- That one CHARLES ANTHONY\r\nOWENS and one RAYMOND WARREN WEINHAUER, JR. did in\r\nSumter County between November 13 and November 16, 1992,\r\nwilfully and unlawfully enter the dwelling of James S. Cofer at\r\nHuntington Place Apartments without consent and with intent to\r\ncommit a crime therein. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the guilty plea proceeding, the solicitor orally amended the indictment,\r\nstating: \"On the indictment on count six, it says burglary first degree. My\r\ninvestigation of the facts determined that that is not in fact a burglary first\r\ndegree. It is a burglary second degree. It is a house in the daytime and he is\r\npleading to a nonviolent on that. Count eight does not say it is a nighttime\r\nburglary but it is, and he is pleading guilty to a nighttime burglary on that as\r\na violent crime.\" Petitioner's attorney made no objection. Petitioner did not\r\nappeal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn July 18, 1994, petitioner filed an application for PCR. Following an\r\nevidentiary hearing, the PCR court dismissed petitioner's application. In\r\nFebruary 1997, petitioner sought from this Court a writ of certiorari to consider\r\nthe following issue: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhether the trial judge lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict\r\nand sentence petitioner for second degree burglary, violent, where \r\n  \r\np.2\r\n\r\nWEINHAUER v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe indictment failed to state an aggravating circumstance under\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(B)(Supp. 1997)?1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPetitioner argues that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\r\nconvict and sentence him for second degree burglary, violent, where the\r\nelements of such offense were not included in count eight of the indictment to\r\nthe grand jury. We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe offense of second degree burglary is codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n16-11-312 (Supp. 1998), which provides two definitions of the offense,\r\nsubsections (A) and (B). Subsection (A) defines second degree burglary as\r\nentering a dwelling2 without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(A). Under subsection (B), a person is also guilty of\r\nsecond degree burglary if he enters a building3 without consent and with intent\r\nto commit a crime therein, and where the burglary involves one of several\r\nenumerated aggravating circumstances, one of which is \"nighttime\" burglary.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(B). \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Although this issue was not raised to the PCR court, we may consider\r\nit on appeal since matters of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any\r\ntime. Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998); Hope v. State, 328\r\nS.C. 78, 492 S.E.2d 76 (1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2 \"'Dwelling' means its definition found in Â§ 16-11-10 and also means the\r\nliving quarters of a building which is used or normally used for sleeping, living,\r\nor lodging by a person.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-310(2) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-310(l) (Supp. 1998) defines \"Building\" in the\r\nfollowing manner: \r\n  \r\n\"Building\" means any structure, vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft:\r\n(a) Where any person lodges or lives; or\r\n(b) Where people assemble for purposes of business, government,\r\neducation, religion, entertainment, public transportation, or public\r\nuse or where goods are stored. Where a building consists of two or\r\nmore units separately occupied or secured, each unit is deemed\r\nboth a separate building in itself and a part of the main building. \r\n  \r\np.3\r\n\r\nWEINHAUER v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond degree burglary, as defined in subsection (B), is specifically listed\r\nas a violent offense under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 (Supp. 1998). Conversely,\r\nsecond degree burglary under subsection (A) is classified as a nonviolent\r\noffense. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-70 (Supp. 1998). Petitioner argues that\r\nwhen the solicitor orally amended count eight of the indictment, she changed\r\nthe nature of the offense by including the aggravating circumstance of\r\n\"nighttime\" burglary. This, in turn, changed the classification of the offense\r\nfrom the nonviolent form of second degree burglary to the violent form, i.e.,\r\nsecond degree burglary as defined under subsection (B). Petitioner further\r\nnotes that by changing the offense from nonviolent to violent, he will have to\r\nserve one-third of his sentence before being eligible for parole, as opposed to\r\none-fourth of the sentence under the nonviolent form.4 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100 (1985), \"If (a) there be any defect\r\nin form in any indictments or (b) on the trial of any case there shall appear to\r\nbe any variance between the allegations of the indictment and the evidence\r\noffered in proof thereof, the court before which the trial shall be had may amend\r\nthe indictment (according to the proof, if the amendment be because of a\r\nvariance) if such amendment does not change the nature of the offense charged.\"\r\n(emphasis added). Thus, the question presented on this appeal is whether the\r\namendment changed the nature of the offense charged. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn State v. Sowell, 85 S.C. 278, 67 S.E. 216 (1910), the defendant was\r\nindicted under section 145 of the South Carolina Criminal Code of 1902, which\r\nprovided: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nEvery person who shall break and enter, or who shall break with\r\nintent to enter, in the daytime, any dwelling house or other house, \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(C) provides that burglary under either\r\nsubsection (A) or (B) is punishable by imprisonment for not more than fifteen\r\nyears, provided that no person convicted of second degree burglary will be\r\neligible for parole until service of one-third of the sentence. However, under\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-610 (1989), for convictions of nonviolent crimes, an\r\ninmate is eligible for parole after serving one-fourth of the sentence. In Hair v. \r\nState, 305 S.C. 77, 406 S.E.2d 332 (1991), we held that since the Omnibus\r\nCrime Bill was enacted after section 16-11-312, subsection (C) of 16-11-312 had\r\nimplicitly been repealed. Thus, a person guilty of the nonviolent form of second\r\ndegree burglary would have to only serve one-fourth of his sentence to be\r\neligible for parole, as opposed to the one-third for the violent form. \r\n  \r\np.4\r\n\r\nWEINHAUER v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor who shall break and enter, or who shall break with intent to\r\nenter in the nighttime, any house, the breaking and entering of\r\nwhich would not constitute a burglary, with intent to commit a\r\nfelony or other crime of a lesser grade, shall be guilty of a felony,\r\nand punishable at the discretion of the court by imprisonment in\r\nthe county jail or penitentiary for a term not exceeding one year. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(emphasis added). In Sowell, the indictment stated that the offense had been\r\ncommitted in the \"daytime.\" At trial, the indictment was amended to state that\r\nthe offense was committed in the \"nighttime.\" This Court noted that section\r\n145 created two distinct and different offenses even though both belonged to the\r\nsame class of felonies and were punishable in the same way.5 The Court held\r\nthat the amendment was improper because it changed the nature of the offense\r\nas originally charged in the indictment. Sowell, supra; see also State v. Sweat,\r\n221 S.C. 270, 70 S.E.2d 234 (1952). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, count eight of the indictment properly set out the\r\nelements for second degree burglary under section 16-11-312(A) (\"person enters\r\na dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein.\"). The\r\nsolicitor amended count eight to state that the offense was committed at\r\n\"nighttime.\" According to the solicitor, petitioner pleaded guilty to second\r\ndegree burglary, violent, as defined under section 16-11-312(B) (\"person enters\r\na building without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein, and . . .\r\n(3) the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe hold that by amending the indictment, the solicitor changed the\r\nnature of the offense charged because the circumstance of \"nighttime\" burglary\r\nwas material to charging Defendant with second degree burglary under\r\nsubsection (B). See Sowell, supra; 41 Am. Jur. 2d Indictments and Informations\r\nÂ§ 184 at 792 (1995)(\"An indictment is not invalid merely for omitting or\r\nincorrectly stating the time or date of the alleged offense, if this information is \r\n  \r\n\r\n5 In State v. Bouknight, 55 S.C. 353, 33 S.E. 451 (1899), this Court held\r\nthat this section of the criminal code created the following two distinct and\r\ndifferent offenses: (1) It is made a felony to break and enter, or to break with\r\nintent to enter, in the daytime, any house, whether it be a dwelling house or a\r\nhouse of any other character, with intent to commit a felony, or other crime of\r\nlesser grade; and (2) it is likewise made a felony to break and enter, or break\r\nwith intent to enter, in the nighttime, any house, except a dwelling house, or\r\nhouse within the curtilage of the dwelling house. \r\n  \r\np.5\r\n\r\nWEINHAUER v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneither material to the charged conduct nor necessary for the preparation of a\r\ndefense.\"). Thus, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to accept petitioner's\r\nguilty plea of second degree burglary under count eight, as amended. See \r\nMurdock v. State, 308 S.C. 143) 417 S.E.2d 543 (1992)(the circuit court lacks\r\njurisdiction to accept a guilty plea based upon a defective indictment). This\r\nwould hold true regardless whether the amendment changed the penalty. See \r\nSowell, supra (holding that the indictment could not be amended to replace\r\n\"daytime\" with \"nighttime\" even though the two offenses were punishable in the\r\nsame way); cf Clair v. State, 324 S.C. 144,478 S.E.2d 54 (1996)(holding that an\r\namendment that increases the penalty changes the nature of the offense). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we REVERSE the decision of the PCR court. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.

We affirm in part,\r\nreverse in part, and remand. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn 1980, James M. Futch, III, (\"Owner\") began a nursery business near\r\nthe small town of Hollywood, South Carolina.1 As a result of his efforts, Owner\r\ncreated the Swinton Creek Nursery (\"Swinton Creek\"). Swinton Creek was\r\nmainly a wholesale operation that sold azaleas to such stores as Wal-Mart and\r\nK-Mart \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn an effort to expand the nursery, Owner borrowed $30,000 from the\r\nSouth Atlantic Production Credit Association in November 1989. In April of\r\n1991, South Atlantic Production Credit merged with several other credit\r\nassociations to become the Edisto Farm Credit (\"EFC\"). From April 1991\r\nforward, Owner's loan was handled by EFC. Owner obtained his initial loan\r\nfrom EFC's Summerville branch, which was managed by Jerry Bishop. As a\r\nborrower, Owner also became a stockholder of EFC.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn July of 1989, Owner became delinquent on his note with EFC. Bishop\r\nrequested that Owner pay the interest on the loan.3 Owner subsequently went\r\nto see Bishop at his office in Summerville to discuss the default. EFC\r\nultimately agreed to renew the $30,000 principal on Owner's note to be due May\r\n1, 1991. However, in May, Owner again went into default. Owner agreed to\r\nmake a payment of $8,000 and work on a plan to liquidate the assets of the\r\nnursery to pay off his debt to EFC. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn late May of 1991, Owner encountered Durwood Collins, Sr., in a\r\nconvenience store on Edisto Island. Collins owned the pavilion at Edisto Beach \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Owner's mother was also a partner in the nursery and helped with\r\noperating the business. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2 Owner's rights as a member of EFC included voting for the board of\r\ndirectors, sharing in the profits and earnings of the association, and applying\r\nfor loans. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 Owner eventually complied, paying $2,404.10 for interest that had\r\naccrued through February 27, 1990. \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand had known Owner since they were children. Owner told Collins that he\r\nwas thinking of liquidating or down-sizing some of Swinton Creek. Collins told\r\nOwner that his son, Durwood Collins, Jr., (\"Buyer\") was graduating from college\r\nand was interested in the nursery business. Collins asked Owner if he was\r\ninterested in selling all of Swinton Creek. Owner said no, but he would sell\r\nsome of Swinton Creek's assets and equipment to Buyer. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDuring the summer of 1991, Buyer began working for Owner at Swinton\r\nCreek to learn the nursery business.4 Buyer also began negotiations with\r\nOwner concerning the sale of Swinton Creek's assets. Owner and Buyer agreed\r\non a price of $97,500.5 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn August of 1991, Buyer went with his father to EFC's Walterboro office\r\nseeking a loan for the acquisition of Swinton Creek's assets and equipment. E.\r\nLawton Huggins was the senior loan officer at the Walterboro branch and\r\nhandled Buyer's loan application for EFC. As part of the application process,\r\nBuyer provided Huggins with his financial statement, tax returns, and a\r\nprojected income statement of his proposed nursery. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn early September of 1991, Huggins received an appraisal of Swinton\r\nCreek's equipment and nursery stock from William West, an EFC appraiser.\r\nHuggins subsequently visited Swinton Creek to look at the equipment and\r\nnursery stock and to re-check the serial numbers on West's appraisal. Huggins\r\ntestified he had a \"side bar conversation\" with Owner while visiting Swinton\r\nCreek. Huggins stated that Owner inquired as to the time table for closing and\r\nindicated that time was of the essence because he had other pressing financial\r\nobligations, including a past due loan. Owner conceded Huggins visited\r\nSwinton Creek, but denied having the \"side bar conversation\" with him at the\r\nnursery. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn September 10, 1991, Huggins wrote a letter to Buyer concerning\r\nBuyer's loan application. The fourth paragraph of the letter stated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI would like to address . . . the weaknesses present due to your\r\nlimited financial strength and questionable repayment capacity.\r\nYour limited asset base does not provide a tangible secondary \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 Buyer now operates Milton Creek Nursery on Edisto Island. \r\n\r\n5 This price included a truck which Owner agreed to sell for $12,500. \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsource of repayment should the nursery fail to generate earnings as\r\nprojected. In other words, you have no assets which may be\r\nconverted in order to satisfy the obligation to my organization.\r\nThis is extremely important since the projected income for the \r\nnursery is not supported by a successful earnings trend. In fact, the \r\noperation you are purchasing has been under financial duress. \r\nYour forecast for generating adequate earnings may materialize,\r\nhowever, there is adequate risk for concern on my part. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHuggins testified that, in the letter, the \"earning trend\" comment was in\r\nreference to Buyer's projected income for the nursery. Huggins claimed he had\r\nno knowledge of Swinton Creek's earning trend and was only referring to\r\nBuyer's trend. However, Huggins admitted the \"financial duress\" comment was\r\nin reference to Swinton Creek. Huggins testified his comment was based solely\r\non his observations during his visit at Swinton Creek and his conversation with\r\nOwner. Huggins further testified the letter was sent first class mail to Buyer\r\nand was not copied to anyone else. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter receiving the letter, Buyer went to see Owner and explained that he\r\nwould be unable to purchase the assets of the nursery for the amount they had\r\noriginally agreed on. Buyer showed Owner the letter from Huggins and told\r\nOwner that he did not believe he would be able to come up with the money.\r\nBuyer eventually obtained a loan from EFC's Summerville branch6 and\r\npurchased the Swinton Creek assets for $77,500 -- $20,000 less than originally\r\nagreed on.7 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOwner sued EFC, Huggins, and Bishop, alleging libel, slander, invasion\r\nof privacy, interference with contract, interference with prospective economic\r\nadvantage, intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of implied\r\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, and civil conspiracy. Before trial, the\r\ntrial court granted EFC's motion for summary judgment on the intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress claim. The other claims were preserved for trial. \r\n  \r\n\r\n6 Buyer's loan application was transferred from EFC's Walterboro branch\r\nto the Summerville branch where it was handled by Lynn Danzler. The loan\r\napplication was approved after Buyer's father co-signed the loan. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n7 The closing date for the purchase was October 17, 199 1. Owner testified\r\nhe felt pressure to close the deal because he needed to buy insurance before\r\nNovember. \r\n  \r\np.10\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of plaintiff s case, the trial court directed a verdict for EFC on\r\nthe theories of civil conspiracy, slander, and breach of implied covenant of good\r\nfaith and fair dealing. In addition, the trial court, finding no evidence of\r\ntortious action by Bishop, dismissed Bishop as a defendant in the case. At the\r\nclose of all the evidence, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of the\r\nremaining defendants on the libel claim. Thus, only the claims of invasion of\r\nprivacy, interference with contract, and interference with prospective economic\r\nadvantage went to the jury. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe jury returned a verdict for defendants EFC and Huggins as to the\r\nclaims of interference with contract and interference with prospective economic\r\nadvantage, and for defendant Huggins on the claim of invasion of privacy, but\r\nfound that EFC was liable to Owner for invasion of privacy in the amount of\r\n$55,000. Both Owner and EFC appealed. EFC argued the trial court erred by\r\nnot granting its directed verdict motion on the invasion of privacy claim.\r\nOwner, on the other hand, argued the trial court should not have granted\r\ndirected verdicts on his claims for libel, civil conspiracy, and breach of implied\r\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Court of Appeals ruled in favor of\r\nEFC on all arguments; the court reversed the trial court's failure to direct a\r\nverdict on the invasion of privacy claim and affirmed the directed verdicts on\r\nthe other claims. Swinton Creek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 326 S.C.\r\n426, 483 S.E.2d 789. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe granted Owner's petition for a writ of certiorari to consider the\r\nfollowing issues: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(1) Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the trial court's denial\r\nof EFC's motion for directed verdict on the invasion of privacy claim? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(2) Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial court's grant of\r\nEFC's motion for directed verdict on the libel claim? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(3) Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial court's grant of\r\nEFC's motion for directed verdict on the breach of implied covenant\r\nof good faith and fair dealing claim? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, a court must view the evidence \r\n  \r\np.11\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\nparty. Quesinberry v.

When\r\nthe evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving\r\nparty is proper. Id.

INVASION OF PRIVACY \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOwner argues that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial\r\ncourt's denial of EFC's directed verdict motion on his invasion of privacy claim.\r\nWe disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe origins of the tort of invasion of privacy are found in the famous law\r\nreview article written in 1890 by Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis. See\r\nWarren &amp; Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193 (1890).8 In their\r\narticle, Warren and Brandeis advocated an extension of common law privacy\r\nrights to protect individuals from what they saw as the advancing threat of a\r\ngossip-consumed, technological society. See Jonathan P. Graham, Note,\r\nPrivacy, Computers, and the Commercial Dissemination of Personal \r\nInformation, 65 Tex. L. Rev. 1395, 1405 (1987)(\"Warren and Brandeis found the\r\nlegal basis for the right to privacy by coupling common-law doctrines with the\r\nnotion that technological advances and social changes had made it necessary\r\nto recognize the new right.\"). Warren and Brandeis warned of new mechanical\r\ndevices which \"threaten[ed] to make good the prediction that 'what is whispered\r\nin the closet shall be proclaimed from the house-tops.'\" Warren &amp; Brandeis, 4\r\nHarv. L. Rev. at 195. They therefore called for securing to the individual the\r\nright \"to be let alone.\"9 Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Holloman v. Life Insurance Co. of Virginia, 192 S.C. 454, 7 S.E.2d 169 \r\n  \r\n\r\n8 For a critical discussion of the Warren-Brandeis formulation see Diane\r\nL. Zimmerman, Requiem For A Heavyweight: A Farewell to Warren and \r\nBrandeis's Privacy Tort, 68 Cornell L. Rev. 291 (1983). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n9 In 1960, Dean Prosser expanded upon the Warren-Brandeis discourse\r\nby classifying invasion of privacy into four distinct causes of action. See\r\nProsser, Privacy, 48 Cal. L. Rev. 383 (1960). Prosser's classifications were\r\nincorporated into and elaborated upon in the Restatement. \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1940), this Court for the-first time recognized the tort of invasion of privacy,\r\nstating, \"the right to privacy is correctly defined ... as the right to be let alone;\r\nthe right of a person to be free from unwarranted publicity.\" Holloman, 192\r\nS.C. at 458, 7 S.E.2d at 171 (citation omitted). Later, in Meetze v. Associated \r\nPress, 230 S.C. 330, 95 S.E.2d 606 (1957), this Court specified three distinct\r\ncauses of action for invasion of privacy: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[1] The unwarranted appropriation or exploitation of one's\r\npersonality, [21 the publicizing of one's private affairs with which\r\nthe public has no legitimate concern, or [31 the wrongful intrusion\r\ninto one's private activities, in such manner as to outrage or cause\r\nmental suffering, shame, or humiliation to a person of ordinary\r\nsensibilities. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMeetze, 230 S.C. at 335, 95 S.E.2d at 608 (quoting 41 Am. Jur. Privacy Â§ 2); see \r\nTodd v. South Carolina-Farm Bureau Mut. Ins., 276 S.C. 284) 278 S.E.2d 607\r\n(1981). The Court in Meetze further noted that truth is not a defense to an\r\naction for invasion of privacy. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOwner concedes his claim falls under the second cause of action specified\r\nin Meetze. The elements of this tort include (1) publicizing, (2) absent any\r\nwaiver or privilege, (3) private matters in which the public has no legitimate\r\nconcern, (4) so as to bring shame or humiliation to a person of ordinary\r\nsensibilities. See Meetze, supra; Tureen v. Equifax, Inc., 571 F.2d 411 (8th Cir.\r\n1978). The Court of Appeals concluded the trial court should have granted\r\nEFC's directed verdict motion because Owner's private affairs had not been\r\n\"publicized.\" Swinton Creek, 326 S.C. at 435, 483 S.E.2d at 795. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWith regard to Owner's right of privacy claim, the two issues raised by\r\nthis appeal are: (a) whether the publicity element of this cause of action can be\r\nsatisfied by mere publication; and (b) whether publicity must be shown if there\r\nis also a breach of confidential relationship. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. Publicity \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThough never directly addressed by this Court, our Court of Appeals has\r\nconsistently held that publicity, as opposed to mere publication, is what is\r\nrequired to give rise to a cause of action for this branch of invasion of privacy;\r\ncommunication to a single individual or to a small group of people will not give \r\n  \r\np.13\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v.

App. 1989); Rycroft v. Gaddy, 281\r\nS.C. 119, 314 S.E.2d 39 (Ct. App. 1984).11 By defining \"publicity\" in this\r\nmanner, our Court of Appeals is in line with the majority of other jurisdictions.\"12 \r\n  \r\n\r\n10 One commentator has suggested that this requirement ensures that\r\npublic communications comply with minimum standards of civility, while\r\nliberating private communications from the threat of legal enforcement of such\r\nrestraints. Robert C. Post, The Social Foundations of Privacy: Community and \r\nSelf In The Common Law Tort, 77 Cal. L. Rev. 957 (1989). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n11 In Rycroft, supra, the Court of Appeals borrowed this interpretation\r\ndirectly from the federal district court decision in Harrison v. Humble Oil, 264\r\nF. Supp. 89 (D.S.C. 1967). In Harrison, the plaintiff alleged that defendant's\r\ncommunication to plaintiffs employer regarding a debt owed to defendant\r\nconstituted an invasion of privacy. The court, in finding no invasion of privacy,\r\nstated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt is an invasion of his rights to publish in a newspaper that the\r\nplaintiff does not pay his debts, or to post a notice to that effect in\r\na window on the public street, or to cry it aloud in the highway, but \r\nnot to communicate the fact to the plaintiffs employer or to any \r\nother individual, or even a small group . . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHarrison, 264 F. Supp. at 92 (emphasis added)(quoting Prosser, Law of Torts, \r\nRight of Privacy Â§ 112 at 835 (3d ed. 1963)). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n12 E.g., Tureen v. Equifax, Inc., 571 F.2d 411, 418 (8th Cir. 1978)(\"Except\r\nin cases of physical intrusion, it has been held that the tort must be founded\r\nupon publicity, in the sense of communication to the public in general or to a\r\nlarge number of persons, as distinguished from one individual or a few.\"); \r\nSatterfield v. Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., Inc., 617 F. Supp. 1359, 1370\r\n(D.S.C. 1985)(\"The disclosure of private facts must be a public disclosure, and\r\nnot a private one; there must be, in other words, publicity.\"); Beard v. Akzona, \r\nInc., 517 F. Supp. 128, 133 (E.D. Tenn. 1981)( \"'Publicity' . . . means that the\r\nmatter is made public, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many\r\npersons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become\r\none of public knowledge.\"); Werner v. Kliewer, 710 P.2d 1250, 1256 (Kan. \r\n  \r\np.14\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Robert C. Post, The Social Foundations of Privacy: Community and Self In \r\nThe Common Law Tort, 77 Cal. L. Rev. 957 (1989). Many of these courts have\r\nborrowed directly from the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which contains the\r\nfollowing discussion of \"publicity:\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe form of invasion of the right of privacy covered in this Section\r\ndepends upon publicity given to the private life of the individual.\r\n\"Publicity,\" as it is used in this Section, differs from \"publication,\"\r\nas that term is used in sec. 577 in connection with liability for\r\ndefamation. \"Publication,\" in that sense, is a word of art, which\r\nincludes any communication by the defendant to a third person.\r\n\"Publicity,\" on the other hand, means that the matter is made\r\npublic, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many\r\npersons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain\r\nto become one of public knowledge. The difference is not one of the\r\nmeans of communication, which may be oral, written or by any\r\nother means. It is one of a communication that reaches, or is sure\r\nto reach, the public. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThus it is not an invasion of the right of privacy, within the\r\nrule stated in this Section, to communicate a fact concerning the\r\nplaintiffs private life to a single person or even to a small group of\r\npersons. On the other hand, any publication in a newspaper or a\r\nmagazine, even of small circulation, or in a handbill distributed to\r\na large number of persons, or any broadcast over the radio, or\r\nstatement made in an address to a large audience, is sufficient to\r\ngive publicity within the meaning of the term as it is used in this\r\nSection. The distinction, in other words, is one between private and\r\npublic communication. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts, Â§ 652D cmt. a, at 383 (1977). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, the trial court, in denying EFC's motion for a directed\r\nverdict, stated: \"The plaintiff testified that various people had confronted him\r\nabout it, and again, obviously, there is a -- I grant you, there is a strong\r\nquestion as to how it got out to anybody . . . but there is enough there, I think,\r\nthat it would be a jury issue.\" At trial, William Geraty testified that the word\r\non the street was that Owner was having problems with a bank. Owner also \r\n  \r\n\r\n1985)(\"it is not an invasion of the right of privacy . . . to communicate a [private\r\nfact] to a single person or even to a small group of persons.\"). \r\n  \r\np.15\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntestified that numerous people had questioned him about the letter. As an\r\nexample, Owner stated that Nat Sanders, Bishop's cousin, asked him about it\r\nonce. Sanders did not testify at trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn their article, The Right to Privacy, Warren and Brandeis were\r\nprimarily concerned with new mechanical devices that would catapult once\r\nprivate gossip into the public domain. See Warren &amp; Brandeis, 4 Harv. L. Rev.\r\nat 196 (\"When personal gossip attains the dignity of print, and crowds the space\r\navailable for matters of real interest to the community, what wonder that the\r\nignorant and thoughtless mistake its relative importance.\"). They clearly did\r\nnot advocate abolishing entirely personal correspondences, whether written or\r\noral. As originally conceived by Warren and Brandeis, public disclosure of\r\nprivate facts requires disclosure akin to publications in mass-media. In the\r\ninstant case, there is no-evidence that EFC published the contents of the letter\r\nto anyone other than Buyer. The letter was sent only to Buyer in an attempt\r\nto address his loan application. We find no evidence to support a claim for\r\npublic disclosure of private facts. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOwner nevertheless argues that EFC should be liable for \"sparking the\r\nflame\" of publicity. In other words, even if EFC published the statement to only\r\none person, if the information eventually became public, EFC should be held\r\naccountable. However, such an approach would effectively eviscerate the\r\nrequirement that the defendant be the one to have publicized the private\r\ninformation. If this approach were adopted, almost any form of gossip would be\r\nactionable, regardless of the discretion taken in its initial communication. We\r\ntherefore affirm the Court of Appeals on this issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2. Confidential Relationship \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Rycroft v. Gaddy, 281 S.C. 119, 314 S.E.2d 39 (Ct. App. 1984), the\r\nCourt of Appeals held, \"Communication to a single individual or to a small\r\ngroup of people, absent a breach of contract, trust or other confidential\r\nrelationship, will not give rise to liability.\" Rycroft, 281 S.C. at 124, 314 S.E.2d\r\nat 43 (emphasis added)., Based on this language, Owner argues that a plaintiff\r\nneed not prove publicity in an invasion of privacy claim if there is a breach of\r\ncontract, trust, or other confidential relationship. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRecently, in McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 494 S.E.2d 431 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1997), our Court of Appeals held: \"'A confidential relationship is breached\r\nif unauthorized disclosure is made to only one person not a party to the \r\n  \r\np.16\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfidence, but the right of privacy does not cover such a case.'\" McCormick, 328\r\nS.C. at 641,494 S.E.2d at 438 (emphasis added) (quoting Alan B. Vickery, Note,\r\nBreach of Confidence: An Emerging Tort, 82 Colum. L. Rev. 1426, 1442 (1982)).\r\nUnder this view, breach of contract or confidentiality does not give rise to an\r\nexception to the \"publicity\" requirement for the tort of invasion of privacy. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, the Court of Appeals observed that the language in\r\nRycroft, supra, derived from the federal district court case of Harrison v. \r\nHumble Oil, 264 F. Supp. 89 (D.S.C. 1967). Harrison, in turn, quoted from\r\nProsser's third edition of the Law of Torts. See Prosser, Law of Torts, Right of \r\nPrivacy Â§ 112 at 835 (3d ed. 1963). The court emphasized that Harrison and\r\nProsser described \"breach of contract, trust or other confidential relationship\"\r\nas an \"independent basis\" of relief. In other words, though the facts of a case\r\nmay give rise to a breach of contract or confidentiality claim, that does not\r\nexcuse the requirement that the private information be \"publicized\" in order to\r\nmaintain an invasion of privacy claim. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals' interpretation on this point. In their\r\narticle, Warren and Brandeis characterized the relationship between breach of\r\ncontract or confidentiality and invasion of privacy in the following manner: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis process of implying a term in a contract, or of implying a trust\r\n(particularly where the contract is written, and where there is no\r\nestablished usage or custom), is nothing more nor less than a\r\njudicial declaration that public morality, private justice, and\r\ngeneral convenience demand the recognition of such a rule, and\r\nthat the publication under similar circumstances would be\r\nconsidered an intolerable abuse. . . . But the court can hardly stop\r\nthere. The narrower doctrine may have satisfied the demands of\r\nsociety at a time when the abuse to be guarded against could rarely\r\nhave arisen without violating a contract or a special confidence; but\r\nnow that modern devices afford abundant opportunities for the\r\npreparation of such wrongs without any participation by the\r\ninjured party, the protection granted by law must be placed upon\r\na broader foundation [of invasion of privacy]. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWarren &amp; Brandeis, 4 Harv. L. Rev. at 210-11. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlthough related in policy, breach of confidentiality and invasion of\r\nprivacy are not so closely connected in law that the presence of the former \r\n  \r\np.17\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobviates proof of \"publicity\" in the latter.13 Warren and Brandeis envisaged a\r\nprivacy right that would occupy ground not already covered by contract and\r\nconfidentiality theories. In this sense, if a plaintiff has a claim for breach of\r\ncontract or confidentiality, there is no justification for reviving an otherwise\r\ninvalid invasion of privacy claim.14 We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals on\r\nthis issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nB. DEFAMATION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOwner argues the trial court erred in granting EFC's motion for a directed\r\nverdict concerning his defamation claim. We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt trial, EFC moved for a directed verdict on Owner's defamation claim,\r\narguing it was protected by a qualified privilege. The trial court granted the\r\nmotion. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe tort of defamation allows a plaintiff to recover for injury to his or her\r\nreputation as the result of the defendant's communications to others of a false\r\nmessage about the plaintiff. Holtzscheiter v. Thompson Newspapers, Inc., 332\r\nS.C. 502, 506 S.E.2d 497 (1998). Defamatory communications take two forms: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n13 See Joseph Glenn White, Note, Physician's Liability for Breach of \r\nConfidentiality: Beyond The Limitations of The Privacy Tort, 49 S.C. L. Rev.\r\n1271 (1998)(distinguishing between breach of confidentiality and invasion of\r\nprivacy and ' arguing the former is better equipped to protect patients from the\r\ndisclosure of personal facts by their doctors). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n14 Additionally, breach of confidentiality and invasion of privacy are torts\r\nthat encompass different doctrinal limitations. See Vickery, 82 Colum. L. Rev.\r\nat 1440 (\"Privacy's doctrinal limits are . . . unnecessary in breach-of-confidence\r\nsituations, and should not bar recovery to plaintiffs deserving of a remedy.\").\r\nFor instance, \"[d]isclosure in breach of confidence or other duty may cover\r\ngreater ground than a pure privacy case, since the duty of confidence . . . may\r\ninclude facts that are not 'private' in the ordinary sense and the disclosure may\r\nnot be 'public.'\" Prosser &amp; Keeton, Law of Torts, Right of Privacy Â§ 117, at 121,\r\nn.6.5 (Supp. 1988). Moreover, unlike breach of confidentiality, the privacy\r\nstandard focuses on the content of the publication, rather than its source. See \r\nMcCormick, 328 S.C. 627, 494 S.E.2d 431. Thus, it is irrelevant in a breach of\r\nconfidentiality claim whether the disclosure of the information would bring\r\nshame to a person of ordinary sensibilities. \r\n  \r\np.18\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlibel and slander. Slander is a spoken defamation while libel is a written\r\ndefamation or one accomplished by actions or conduct. Id. If a communication\r\nis libelous, then the law presumes the defendant acted with common law malice. \r\nId. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn a defamation action, the defendant may assert the affirmative defense\r\nof conditional or qualified privilege. Under this defense, one who publishes\r\ndefamatory matter concerning, another is not liable for the publication if (1) the\r\nmatter is published upon an occasion that makes it conditionally privileged, and\r\n(2) the privilege is not abused. Restatement (Second) of Torts, Â§ 593 (1977); see \r\nBell v. Bank of Abbeville, 208 S.C. 490) 38 S.E.2d 641 (1946). In Bell, this Court\r\nheld: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn determining whether or not the communication was qualifiedly\r\nprivileged, regard must be had to the occasion and to the\r\nrelationship of the parties. When one has an interest in the subject\r\nmatter of a communication, and the person (or persons) to whom it\r\nis made has a corresponding interest, every communication\r\nhonestly made, in order to protect such common interest, is\r\nprivileged by reason of the occasion. The statement, however, must\r\nbe such as the occasion warrants, and must be made in good faith\r\nto protect the interests of the one who makes it and the persons to\r\nwhom it is addressed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBell, 208 S.C. at 493-94, 38 S.E.2d at 643. Where the occasion gives rise to a\r\nqualified privilege, there is a prima facie presumption to rebut the inference of\r\nmalice, and the burden is on the plaintiff to show actual malice or that the scope\r\nof the privilege has been exceeded. Fulton v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 220\r\nS.C. 287, 67 S.E.2d 425 (1951); 53 C.J.S. Libel and Slander Â§ 79 (1987). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTo prove actual malice, the plaintiff must show that the defendant was\r\nactivated by ill will in what he did, with the design to causelessly and wantonly\r\ninjure the plaintiff; or that the statements were published with such\r\nrecklessness as to show a conscious disregard for plaintiffs rights. \r\nHoltzscheiter, supra. In addition, \"the person making [the defamatory\r\nstatement] must be careful to go no further than his interests or his duties\r\nrequire.... And the fact that a duty, a common interest, or a confidential\r\nrelation existed to a limited degree, is not a defense, even though the publisher\r\nacted in good faith.\" Fulton, 220 S.C. at 297,67 S.E.2d at 429; accord Woodward \r\nv. South Carolina Farm Bureau Ins. Co., 277 S.C. 29, 282 S.E.2d 599 (1981). \r\n  \r\np.19\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, the question whether an occasion gives rise to a qualified or\r\nconditional privilege is one of law for the court. 50 Am. Jur. 2d Libel and \r\nSlander Â§ 276 (1995). However, the question whether the privilege has been\r\nabused is one for the jury. Id. Factual inquiries, such as whether the\r\ndefendants acted in good faith in making the statement, whether the scope of\r\nthe statement was properly limited in its scope, and whether the statement was\r\nsent only to the proper parties, are generally left in the hands of the jury to\r\ndetermine whether the privilege was abused. Id.; see also Restatement (Second)\r\nof Torts Â§Â§ 599-610. In Fulton, this Court held that it was a question for the\r\njury to determine if the publication went beyond what the occasion required and\r\nwas unnecessarily defamatory. Fulton, 220 S.C. at 297, 67 S.E.2d at 429; cf\r\nWoodward, 277 S.C. at 32-33, 282 S.E.2d at 601 (\"While abuse of privilege is\r\nordinarily an issue for the jury. . . . in the absence of a controversy as to the\r\nfacts . . . it is for the court to say in a given instance whether or not the privilege\r\nhas been abused or exceeded.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, the defamatory communication took the form of libel.\r\nThus, malice was presumed, and it was defendant's burden to establish that a\r\nprivilege existed in order to rebut this presumption. When Huggins was asked\r\nwhy he made the \"financial duress\" comment, he stated: \"I felt like it was part\r\nof my responsibility to an inexperienced applicant, who obviously could not see\r\nthe risk associated with enterprise in which he was beginning.\" In granting the\r\ndirected verdict as to conditional privilege, the trial court made the following\r\nconclusions: first, there was no evidence that Huggins wrote the letter in bad\r\nfaith; second, EFC was trying to protect its own interest in the letter; third, the\r\nletter was written for the limited purpose of assisting Buyer with obtaining a\r\nloan; and fourth, the comments were made on the proper occasion and in the\r\nproper manner. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's determination\r\nthat, as a matter of law, the occasion gave rise to a conditional privilege and the\r\nprivilege was not abused. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAssuming the occasion did give rise to a conditional privilege, we believe\r\na question existed for the jury as to whether the privilege was exceeded or\r\nabused. First, the scope of the privilege extended only as far as EFC's interests\r\nand duties required. See Fulton, supra. It is questionable whether a specific\r\ncomment about Swinton Creek's financial status was required to protect any\r\ninterest or duty covered by the privilege. EFC contends it wrote the letter for\r\nthe sole purpose of guiding Buyer into a successful loan application. Yet, Buyer\r\nwas only seeking to buy some of Owner's assets, not the entire Swinton Creek\r\noperation. Moreover, if EFC wanted to convey to Buyer the difficulties of \r\n  \r\np.20\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v. EDISTO FARM CREDIT et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrunning a nursery in a small town, it could have simply made a general\r\nstatement without specifically referring to Owner. Thus, even if EFC acted in\r\ngood faith to assist Buyer, the jury might conclude that the \"financial duress\"\r\ncomment was unnecessarily defamatory under these circumstances. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAdditionally, there was evidence suggesting EFC acted in reckless\r\ndisregard of Owner's rights so as to constitute actual malice. See Holtzscheiter, \r\nsupra. Huggins testified that the financial duress comment was based solely\r\non his observations of Swinton Creek and his \"side bar conversation\" with\r\nOwner. However, Owner denied having any conversation with Huggins at the\r\nnursery. Further, even if a conversation did take place, EFC had a banking\r\nrelationship with Owner at the time Huggins visited Swinton Creek. These are\r\nall factors relevant in determining whether there was actual malice. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe conclude the directed verdict should not have been granted and\r\nreverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nC. IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOwner argues the trial court erred in granting EFC's motion for directed\r\nverdict regarding the claim of breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair\r\ndealing. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's determination that Owner\r\ncould not proceed on his implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim\r\nbecause he was in default on the contract. See Parks v. Lyons, 219 S.C. 40, 48,\r\n64 S.E.2d 123, 126 (1951)(\"one who seeks to recover damages for breach of a\r\ncontract, to which he was a party, must show that the contract has been\r\nperformed on his part, or at least that he was, at the appropriate time, able,\r\n ready, and willing to perform it.\"). It is uncontested that in May of 1991, Owner\r\nwent into default on his note with EFC. We conclude the Court of Appeals is\r\ncorrect on this point. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOwner nevertheless argues that he still has a claim under his contractual\r\nrelationship with the bank as a stockholder. This argument is without merit\r\nbecause Owner's status as a stockholder is based upon his relationship with\r\nEFC as a borrower. And as a borrower, Owner clearly failed to fulfill his\r\nobligations under the contract. We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals on this\r\nissue. \r\n  \r\np.21\r\n\r\nSWINTON CREEK NURSERY, et al v.

We find the Acts in question\r\nwere unconstitutional when passed as special legislation because they were in\r\ndirect conflict with the general law previously established in the state. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHorry County has two law enforcement agencies: the Horry County Sheriff\r\nand the Horry County Police Department. The Horry County Sheriff (\"the\r\nSheriff') instituted a declaratory judgment action against Horry County, the\r\nofficials of Horry County Council, the Horry County Administrator, and the\r\ndirector of the Horry County Detention Center (\"the County\"). In that action,\r\nthe Sheriff requested custody and control of the Horry County Detention Center\r\n(\"the jail\"). By order dated August 26, 1997, the trial court denied the Sheriff's\r\nrequest for custody of the jail. The Sheriff appealed. \r\n  \r\nThe issues before this Court on appeal are:1 \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 The County also challenges the Sheriffs standing. We find no merit to\r\nthis contention. To have standing, one must be a real party in interest. Glaze \r\nv. Grooms, 324 S.C. 249, 478 S.E.2d 841 (1996). A \"real party in interest\" is one \r\n  \r\np.24\r\n\r\nHENRY v. HORRY COUNTY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Were the Acts granting the County custody of the jail in 1959\r\nconstitutional? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2. If the Acts were constitutional, did the enactment of Home Rule\r\nvoid the Acts as special legislation passed in conflict with the\r\ngeneral law? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3. Did the lower court err in holding that in order to prevail in this\r\naction, the Sheriff had to prove that either the entire local act 21\r\nStatutes at Large 1959 or the Horry County Ordinance 5-81 was\r\ninvalid? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSince the 1800s, the Sheriff has been a constitutional officer in South\r\nCarolina. See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 24. By statute, for over 95 years, the general\r\nlaw regarding custody of South Carolina county jails has been: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe sheriff shall have custody of the jail in his county and, if he\r\nappoint a jailer to keep it, the sheriff shall be liable for such jailer\r\nand the sheriff or jailer shall receive and safely keep in prison any\r\nperson delivered or committed to either of them, according to law. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 24-5-10 (1976) (emphasis added). In 1959, the General\r\nAssembly passed Act 21, a statute creating the Horry County Police\r\nCommission. Act 21 was codified as S.C. Code of Laws Â§Â§ 53-551 through 53-566\r\n(1962). Sections 53-553 and 53-554 (\"the Acts\") devolved upon the Commission\r\nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the Horry County jail. See 21 Statutes at Large \r\n  \r\n\r\nwho has a real, material, or substantial interest in the subject matter of the\r\naction, as opposed to one who has a nominal or technical interest in the action.\r\nAnchor Point, Inc. v. Shoals Sewer Co., 308 S.C. 4222 418 S.E.2d 546 (1992). The\r\nSheriff in this matter has a personal stake in the issue before the Court because\r\nhe has several statutory duties with regard to the prisoners of Horry County.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann.Â§Â§ 23-17-20 through -80 (1976). Furthermore, the Sheriff has\r\nan economic interest in the fees connected with the housing of prisoners. \r\n  \r\np.25\r\n\r\nHENRY v. HORRY COUNTY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1959; 1962 S.C. Code of Laws, Section 53-551, et seq.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn March 18, 1976, Horry County adopted the council-administrator form\r\nof local government. On April 16, 1981, the Horry County Council passed\r\nOrdinance No. 5-81, which, inter alia, abolished the Horry County Police\r\nCommission and devolved its functions upon the Horry County Council and/or\r\nthe Horry County Administrator. See Graham v. Creel, 289 S.C. 165,345 S.E.2d\r\n717(1986). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSince 1905, the South Carolina Constitution has contained a restriction\r\non the General Assembly enacting \"special\" laws that affect one county as\r\nopposed to \"general\" laws for the entire state.3 Prior to March 1973, an\r\nexception to the restriction existed under S.C. Const. art. VII, Â§ 11 for the\r\nstructure of county governments. However, this exception to the general\r\nprohibition on special legislation had always been limited by the rule that such\r\nspecial legislation, even where permitted, could not conflict with the general law\r\nof the state. See Hurst v. Sumter County, 189 S.C. 376, 1 S.E.2d 238 (1939);\r\nCraig v. Pickens, 189 S.C. 1641 200 S.E. 825 (1939). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn February 17, 1959, the General Assembly passed the Acts taking\r\ncustody of the jail away from the Sheriff. At that time, the constitutional\r\nprohibition against special legislation in S.C. Const. art. III, Â§ 34(9), did not\r\napply to every legislative act of the General Assembly concerning the structure\r\nof county government. \"[T]he General Assembly may provide such system of\r\ntownship government as it shall think proper in any and all the Counties, and\r\nmay make special provisions for municipal government and for the protection of\r\nchartered rights and powers of municipalities . . .\". S.C. Const. art. VII , Â§ 11.4 \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Section 53-553. Powers of commission generally.--The commission\r\nshall have exclusive jurisdiction of the jail  . . . . (1959 (510 18). \r\n  \r\nSection 53-554. Employment of jailer and other personal.--The\r\ncommission shall employ the jailer, assistant jailer, secretary and all other\r\npersonnel necessary for the carrying out of the provisions of this article and for\r\nthe orderly process of law enforcement and the upkeep and maintenance of the\r\ncounty jail. (1959 (510 18). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 This provision reads: \"In all other cases, where a general law can be made\r\napplicable, no special law shall be enacted . . .\", S.C. Const. art. III, Â§ 34(9). \r\n  \r\n4 This constitutional provision was effectively repealed in 1973 by S.C\r\nConst. art. VIII, Â§ 7 (\" . . . No laws for a specific county shall be enacted and no \r\n  \r\np.26\r\n\r\nHENRY v. HORRY COUNTY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn interpreting this grant of power prior to Home Rule, this Court said: \"Article\r\n7, Sec. 11, has been repeatedly construed by this Court to give the General\r\nAssembly complete control over the government and other internal affairs of the\r\nCounties of the State.\" Bynum v. Barron, 227 S.C. 339, 88 S.E.2d 67 (1955)\r\n(citing Reese v. Hinnant, 187 S.C. 474, 198 S.E. 403 (1938)). Prior to the\r\nenactment of Home Rule, this Court held \"the prohibition against special\r\nlegislation does not apply in the case of special legislation  . . . dealing with local\r\ncounty government.\" Morris v. Scott, 258 S.C. 435, 441, 189 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1972)\r\n(citing Gaud v. Walker, 214 S.C. 451, 53 S.E.2d 316 (1949)). Under S.C. Const.\r\nart. VII Â§ 11, there is no question that in 1959 the General Assembly could pass\r\nspecial laws for the structure of county government. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHowever, in 1935, the people of South Carolina added a significant\r\namendment to S.C. Const. art. III, Â§ 34 that revealed the nature of the art. VII,\r\nÂ§ 11 exception. Prior to that amendment, the section read: \"The General\r\nAssembly of this State shall not enact local or special laws concerning any of the\r\nfollowing subjects or for any of the following purposes, to wit: . . . (9) In all other\r\ncases, where a general law can be made applicable, no special law shall be\r\nenacted.\" Subsection (9) was amended in 1935 to include the phrase: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nProvided, That the General Assembly may enact local or special\r\nlaws fixing the amount and manner of compensation to be paid to\r\nthe County Officers of the several counties of the State, and may\r\nprovide that the fees collected by any such officer, or officers, shall\r\nbe paid into the treasury of the respective counties. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPrior to this amendment, the general law gave the duty to collect delinquent\r\ntaxes to the sheriffs of the counties. Under the general law, the, General\r\nAssembly could not permissibly pass special legislation to take away such fees\r\nfrom the Sheriff. Such action would have been unconstitutional as recognized\r\nby Hurst v. Sumter County, 189 S.C. 376, 1 S.E.2d 238 (1939). In Craig v. \r\nPickens, 189 S.C. 164) 200 S.E. 825 (1939), the Court upheld a statute that took\r\naway the sheriffs power to collect the delinquent taxes under the general law\r\nand gave this power to a delinquent tax collector. This special law was allowed\r\nby the specific provisions of the 1935 amendment to art. III. Furthermore, the\r\ncase noted that \"there is no statewide statute in South Carolina governing the\r\nsalary of a sheriff.\" Craig v. Pickens County, 189 S.C. 164, 167, 200 S.E. 825, 826 \r\n  \r\n\r\ncounty shall, be exempted from the general laws or laws applicable to the\r\nselected alternative form of government.\"). \r\n  \r\np.27\r\n\r\nHENRY v. HORRY COUNTY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1939). This amendment and subsequent case law is significant because it\r\nreveals the General Assembly did not believe that it had the power to enact a\r\nspecial law taking the fees and taxes away from the county officers in contrast\r\nto the general law without a specific constitutional amendment providing such\r\npower. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThere is no dispute that the General Assembly could enact special laws\r\npursuant to art. VII, Â§ 11 to construct and arrange county governments. As\r\nrecognized by the cases following the 1935 amendment to art. III, Â§ 34, this\r\npower was limited in its scope so as to not conflict with the general law of the\r\nstate. The Sheriff contends that in 1959 the General Assembly violated the\r\nConstitution because there was a general law giving custody of the county jail\r\nto the sheriff of each county at the time the legislature passed the special\r\nlegislation giving the Horry County jail to the Horry County Police Commission.\r\nWe agree with the Sheriff that the Acts taking the custody of the Horry County\r\njail away from the Sheriff were unconstitutional when passed as special\r\nlegislation because they were in direct conflict with the general law. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Acts in this case are special legislation passed in conflict with the\r\ngeneral law of the state. A general law is one that applies to the entire State.\r\nTown of Hilton Head Island v. Morris, 324 S.C. 30, 484 S.E.2d 104, 107 (1997).\r\nJustice Gregory recognized in his Roton v. Sparks concurrence that the general\r\nlaw in South Carolina is S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-5-10 (1976) that gives custody\r\nof the jail to the county sheriff. Roton v. Sparks, 270 S.C. 637, 640, 244 S.E.2d 214,\r\n216 (1978) (J. Gregory, concurring) (\"the general law of this State . . . provides:\r\nThe sheriff shall have custody of the jail in his county.\").5 The general law, both\r\ncurrently and in 1959 when the General Assembly passed the Acts, has been\r\nthat the sheriff of each county has the right to possession of the county jail. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Graham v. Creel, 289 S.C. 165, 345 S.E.2d 717 (1986), this Court upheld\r\nthe validity of Section 53-551 of 21 Statutes at Large 1959 that created the\r\nHorry County Police Commission as permissible special legislation passed prior\r\nto Home Rule. The Police Commission's validity was upheld against the\r\nargument that the passage of the constitutional amendment authorizing Home\r\nRule repealed such special legislation. The General Assembly passed the Acts \r\n  \r\n\r\n5 Both the County and the trial judge correctly note that Roton v. Sparks,\r\n270 S.C. 637~ 244 S.E.2d 214 (1978), is not dispositive of the issue before this\r\nCourt. Roton dealt with a county ordinance and not an act by the General Assembly. \r\n  \r\np.28\r\n\r\nHENRY v. HORRY COUNTY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the current case as part of the same legislation ruled upon in Graham. The court held: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSince Â§ 53-551 S.C. Code Ann. (1962) was not in conflict with the \r\ngeneral law, it remained in full force and effect until the Horry\r\nCounty Council enacted Ordinance 5-81 on April 16,1981. On that\r\ndate, the functions of the Horry County Police Commission devolved\r\nupon the Horry County Council and/or the Horry County\r\nAdministrator. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGraham v. Creel, 289 S.C. 165, 168-69, 345 S.E.2d 717, 719 (emphasis added).\r\nThis Court found in Graham that the creation of the Horry County Police\r\nCommission in 1959 was within the power of the General Assembly under S.C.\r\nConst. art. VII Â§ 11. The Graham holding, however, did not address the Acts\r\nbefore the Court in this case and, by its own language, limited that decision to\r\nthe issue of the validity of Â§ 53-551 of 21 Statutes at Large 1959. See Graham, \r\nsupra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Acts in question granting the custody of the jail to the County were\r\nunconstitutional when passed because they were special legislation in direct\r\nconflict with general law already established in the state by statute. The\r\nGraham decision found that it was permissible to set up the Horry County Police\r\nCommission. That opinion recognized that a police commission was not in direct\r\nconflict with a general law of the state. Graham did not address the transfer of\r\nthe custody of the jail to the County. The direct conflict between the general\r\nstatute granting custody of the jail to the Sheriff and the special legislation\r\ngranting the jail to the County requires a finding that the special legislation was\r\nunconstitutional under S.C. Const. art. 111, Â§ 34(9). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe are aware that the Sheriff has not had custody of the Horry County jail\r\nsince the Acts were passed in 1959. Mindful of the profound ramifications our\r\ndecision may have on the public safety, we delay the effectiveness of this opinion\r\nuntil July 1, 1999, so that the General Assembly will have an opportunity to\r\nexamine this case and other laws similarly situated to the Acts. This delay\r\nallows the legislature time to make any necessary adjustments in light of this\r\ndecision. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSince the Acts granting custody of the jail to the County were\r\nunconstitutional special legislation when passed in 1959, we REVERSE the \r\n  \r\np.29\r\n\r\nHENRY v. HORRY COUNTY, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder of the trial judge and grant the Sheriff s request for relief. Recognizing\r\nthat this ruling will impact a settled system of jail management in Horry County\r\nthat has existed for 40 years, we deem it appropriate to structure our ruling in\r\nsuch a way as to allow our General Assembly, the County government, and the\r\ncitizens of Horry County some time to deal with the impact of our decision. It\r\nis therefore ordered that this decision shall become effective on July 1, 1999.6 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n6 Having found the Acts were unconstitutional when passed in 1959 as\r\nspecial legislation in direct conflict with the general law of the state, the other\r\nissues in this case need not be addressed. \r\n  \r\n\r\np.30 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24912","title":"Keaton, et al. v.

Petitioners claim the Court of Appeals wrongly found\r\nan objection to a jury charge was not preserved for appellate review. We agree.\r\nPetitioners further argue that they are entitled to a new trial because the jury\r\ncharge was erroneous. We disagree and find that no new trial is necessary. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nVerona Keaton, the mother and guardian ad litem for her son Tony\r\nFoster, Jr., (\"Patient\"), sued the Greenville Hospital System, Greenville\r\nMemorial Hospital, the emergency room physician Dr. Donald Gregg, Greenville\r\nEmergency Medicine, and Carolina Emergency Medicine (\"the Defendants\"). \r\n  \r\np.32\r\n\r\nKEATON, et al. v. GREENVILLE HOSPITAL SYSTEM, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatient's suit claimed the Defendants negligently caused him permanent brain\r\ndamage by failing to diagnose and treat his hydrocephalic condition in a timely\r\nmanner. Both parents of Patient instituted claims against the Defendants\r\nbased on the same incident. The trial court dismissed the parents' claims\r\nagainst the hospital because the South Carolina Tort Claims Act's two year\r\nstatute of limitations had passed.1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn January 7, 1992, Verona Keaton brought her son to the Greenville\r\nMemorial Hospital emergency room. Patient had been experiencing vomiting,\r\ndizziness, and diarrhea. They entered the hospital at 2:45 p.m. and by 2:51\r\np.m. Patient was in an emergency room bed. Dr. Gregg saw Patient at 3:00 p.m.\r\nand performed a neurological examination. At this time Dr. Gregg took\r\nPatient's history, performed a physical examination, and ordered certain tests\r\nincluding a CT Scan. A CT scan is the only test that reveals the presence of\r\nhydrocephalus. In this initial examination Dr. Gregg determined Patient was\r\nnot suffering from any neurological defect. Dr. Gregg diagnosed him as\r\nprobably dehydrated and instructed that Patient receive intravenous fluids. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDuring the next hour, Patient's condition did not improve. At 3:50 p.m.,\r\nDr. Gregg determined that Patient was suffering from an altered mental state\r\nand requested support. After completing more tests, at 4:49 p.m. Patient was\r\ntaken to the CT scan. The CT scan immediately revealed Patient's\r\nhydrocephalus and the doctor requested a neurological consultation. At 5:10\r\np.m., Patient's pulse stopped. A doctor began mouth to mouth resuscitation and\r\nintubated Patient so that oxygen could flow. At 5:22 p.m. a neurosurgeon\r\narrived and, based on the CT Scan results, inserted a needle into Patient's head\r\nto relieve the cranial pressure. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHydrocephalus is a condition in which the ventricles in the brain become\r\nblocked. The blockage prevents the spinal fluid from adequately circulating\r\n through the brain and returning to the bloodstream. This blockage results in\r\nswelling and pressure within the cranium. Patient claims the doctors could\r\nhave reduced the pressure caused by the water on his brain if they had given\r\nhim oxygen and the drug Mannitol. Patient also believes that he should have\r\nreceived 100% oxygen before going to the CT Scan. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFollowing this episode, Patient suffered severe neurological damage. \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 The remaining claims of both parents and Patient will be referred to as\r\nthose of Patient. \r\n  \r\np.33\r\n\r\nKEATON, et al. v. GREENVILLE HOSPITAL SYSTEM, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a tracheostomy and a gastrostomy, Patient has remained in a vegetative\r\nstate. He has remained in a chronic care facility since February 2, 1993. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPatient sued the Defendants, alleging negligence. Prior to the jury being\r\ncharged, the Defendants submitted a request for a jury charge stating the\r\nactions of the medical providers were to be judged in light of the circumstances\r\nthen and there existing, and not in hindsight. Patient made no objection to this\r\nrequest to charge prior to the initial charging of the jury. However, the trial\r\njudge inadvertently omitted this hindsight charge when charging the jury. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Defendants promptly objected to the trial court's omission. The trial\r\ncourt responded to the omission by stating: \"How I missed that is beyond me.\r\nNo, I have to charge that, I agree.\" Patient then objected to the charge being\r\ngiven at all to the jury.' Patient claimed that the hindsight charge was not\r\nproper in a medical malpractice case. Patient stated his objection as: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nYour Honor, my problem with the hindsight charge is that\r\nbasically any records review by a medical expert is a review\r\ntechnically in hindsight which would, in effect, obviate the need for\r\nhaving any medical malpractice law whatsoever because if the\r\npatient in a situation with giving medical records to another expert\r\nwitness to review them, there's no way for that medical physician\r\nto be on the scene in the operating room, or in the emergency room,\r\nat the exact time that it happened unless they could go back in time\r\nsomething like on Star Trek. So, therefore, the hindsight argument,\r\nis really a red herring, which really undercuts a patient's right to\r\nreceive adequate justice in a medical malpractice case. And I would\r\nargue, your honor, that it would be a violation of due process\r\nbecause what it does, in effect, is that it -- it's a violation of equal\r\nprotection and due process in a sense because no other people in\r\nterms of automobiles, and things of that nature, have to have a\r\ncharge that hindsight in terms of someone driving down the\r\nhighway, if they hadn't run a stop sign wouldn't have caused a\r\nwreck. And a medical negligence case is simply the same thing as\r\nan automobile accident to that extent. The doctor ran a medical red\r\nlight. And other people giving opinions with regard to whether or\r\nnot he violated the standard of care, which was generally\r\nrecognized by physicians who are similarly situated practicing on\r\na national level. \r\n  \r\np.34\r\n\r\nKEATON, et al. v. GREENVILLE HOSPITAL SYSTEM, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe judge disagreed with Patient and called the jury back in to be recharged.\r\nThe recharging went as follows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes in covering the\r\ncharges I may omit something, and sometimes I don't. But just\r\nbecause I give you another charge, this does not have any more\r\nmeaning than anything else I told you, okay. It just goes along\r\nwith everything else that I have charged you. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNow I have told you that in considering a medical malpractice\r\ncase, you and I don't know what the standards are, and you have\r\nto determine the facts and circumstances that existed on the date\r\nand time in question when this child was brought into the\r\nemergency room. And in evaluating, determining what the\r\nstandard of care is', you have to have expert testimony as to what\r\nthe doctor, the hospital, the residents, and the nurses should or\r\nshould not have done based on those circumstances. In giving their\r\nopinions, the experts must review the records at the time of the\r\nincident. In considering whether a physician, a resident, or nurse\r\nhas exercised reasonable judgment in a given case, you must\r\nconsider such judgment in relation to the facts as they existed at\r\nthe time the judgment was made, and not in light of what hindsight\r\n may reveal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter the recharging of the jury, the judge specifically asked if there were any\r\nfurther objections. Counsel for Patient replied, \"None, your honor.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn November 21, 1995, the jury returned a complete defense verdict\r\nexonerating Dr. Gregg and the rest of the Defendants. The trial judge heard\r\npost-trial motions on December 7, 1995. Although none of Patient's written\r\npost-trial motions challenged the hindsight charge, Patient raised this issue in\r\nthe post-trial hearing. The trial judge ruled from the bench denying all of\r\nPlaintiff s motions, including the one concerning the hindsight charge. Patient\r\nthen filed a Notice of Appeal from the jury verdict. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn an unpublished decision, the Court of Appeals stated: \"Plaintiffs also\r\nargue the trial court erred in instructing the jury that a physician may not be\r\njudged in light of what hindsight may reveal. Insofar as the plaintiffs failed to \r\nobject to the language of the charge after it was given, this issue is not\r\npreserved for appellate review. State v. Johnson, 315 S.C. 485, 445 S.E.2d 637\r\n(1994).\" Keaton v. Greenville Hospital System, Opinion No. 97-UP-379 (Ct. App. \r\n  \r\np.35\r\n\r\nKEATON, et al. v. GREENVILLE HOSPITAL SYSTEM, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 23, 1997, revised August 28, 1997) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Court granted Patient's petition for a writ of certiorari to consider\r\nthe following issues: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(1) Was the objection to the jury charge preserved? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(2) If the objection was preserved, was the hindsight charge\r\nerroneous? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. PRESERVATION OF THE OBJECTION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPatient argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding his objection to the\r\njury charge unpreserved. We agree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA clear understanding of the events that occurred during the jury\r\ncharging process is important to the resolution of this case. Prior to the initial\r\njury charge reading to the jury, Patient did not object to the hindsight jury\r\ncharge. The court then instructed the jury, accidentally omitting the hindsight\r\ncharge. The judge sent the jury out of the courtroom but instructed them not\r\nto deliberate the case. The Defendants objected to the trial court's omission of\r\nthe hindsight charge. The trial court agreed with the Defendants that the\r\nhindsight charge should have been read. Patient then objected to the jury\r\ncharge for the first time. Patient gave an explanation of his objection to the\r\ncharge. The trial court overruled the objection and brought the jury back into\r\nthe courtroom and read the omitted charge. The jury then left to deliberate the\r\ncase and Patient did not renew his objection. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPatient's on the record explanation of his objection to the hindsight jury\r\ncharge along with the trial judge's ruling on that issue is sufficient to preserve\r\nthe objection for appeal. The objection is preserved despite Patient not\r\nobjecting to the charge after it was read to the jury. Our recent decision of State \r\nv. Johnson, Op. No. 24851 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Nov. 9, 1988) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.\r\nNo. 35 at 23, n. 1), observed that the majority and dissenting opinions in State \r\nv. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1985), were \"being read to hold that\r\nwhere a party's jury charge objections or requests are denied on-the-record after\r\na pre-charge conference, the party must renew those objections or requests\r\nsubsequent to the courts instructions to the jury. The majority opinion in \r\n  \r\np.36\r\n\r\nKEATON, et al. v. GREENVILLE HOSPITAL SYSTEM, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhipple, however, did not establish such a rule.\" Id. Johnson clarified the\r\nconfusion in Whipple by stating, \"where a party requests a jury charge and,\r\nafter opportunity for discussion, the trial judge declines the charge, it is\r\nunnecessary, to preserve the point on appeal, to renew the request at [the]\r\nconclusion of the court's instructions.\" Id. The authority relied on by the Court\r\nof Appeals does not stand for the proposition that Patient had to object after the\r\njury charge was read to preserve the objection for review on appeal.2 Like the\r\npetitioner in Johnson, Patient objected on the record and the trial judge\r\nspecifically ruled on the objection. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOne distinction between Johnson and the instant case is that Johnson\r\nwas a criminal matter and the current case involves a civil dispute. However,\r\nRule 20(b), SCRimP, is the criminal procedure equivalent to Rule 51, SCRCP\r\nat issue in the current case. The Reporter's Notes state: \"[Rule 20, SCRimP] .\r\n. . As taken from Rule 51, SCRCP . . .\" Reporter's Notes, Rule 20, SCRimP. The\r\ntwo rules are similar and encompass similar policy goals.3 As in Johnson, there\r\nwas an opportunity for discussion on the record and the trial judge specifically\r\nruled on the jury charge. Patient's objection satisfied Rule 51's purpose of \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 The Court of Appeals decision erroneously cites State v. Johnson, 315\r\nS.C. 485, 445 S.E.2d 637 (1994) for the proposition: \"Insofar as the plaintiffs\r\nfailed to object to the language of the charge after it was given, this issue is not\r\npreserved for appellate review.\" That case does not stand for this proposition;\r\n it simply holds that the complete failure to object to a jury charge prevents\r\nreview on appeal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 The operative language of Rule 20, SCRimP states: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"[T]he parties shall be given the opportunity to object to the giving or failure to\r\ngive an instruction before the jury retires, but out of the hearing of the jury.\r\nAny objection shall state distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for\r\nobjection. Failure to object in accordance with this rule shall constitute a\r\nwaiver of objection.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 51, SCRCP's operative language reads: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction\r\nunless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating\r\ndistinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds for his objection.\r\nOpportunity shall be given to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury.\" \r\n  \r\np.37\r\n\r\nKEATON, et al. v. GREENVILLE HOSPITAL SYSTEM, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensuring that the parties have given the trial judge a chance to resolve disputed\r\nissues relating to jury instructions. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nH. PROPRIETY OF THE HINDSIGHT CHARGE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPatient argues the hindsight jury charge as given constitutes error\r\nwarranting a new trial. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nEven though Patient preserved his argument for appeal, we believe a\r\nremand is unnecessary because the judge adequately charged the jury in\r\nrespect to the law of medical malpractice in South Carolina. A jury charge is\r\ncorrect if \"[w]hen the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition\r\nand adequately covers the law.\" State v. Johnson, 315 S.C. 485, 487, 445 S.E.2d\r\n637, 638 n.1 (1994) (citing State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 440 S.E.2d 869\r\n(1994)); see also State v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 459, 272 S.E.2d 634 (1980) (holding\r\nthat a jury charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not\r\nrequire reversal). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn King v. Williams, 276 S.C. 478, 279 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1981), this Court\r\nput forth the standard of care for a medical practitioner. This Court held: \"The\r\ndegree of care which must be observed is, of course, that of an average,\r\ncompetent practitioner acting in the same or similar circumstances.\" King, at\r\n482) 279 S.E.2d at 620 (emphasis added). Since the King decision, our Court of\r\nAppeals has defined medical malpractice as \"the failure of a physician to\r\nexercise that degree of care and skill which is ordinarily employed by the\r\nprofession generally, under similar conditions and in like surrounding \r\ncircumstances,\" Jernigan v. King, 312 S.C. 331, 333, 440 S.E.2d 379, 381 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1993) (emphasis added). The standard for recovery has been summarized,\r\n\"To recover for medical malpractice, a plaintiff must show failure by a physician\r\nto exercise that degree of care and skill which is ordinarily employed by the\r\nprofession under similar conditions and in like circumstances,\" Bonaparte v. \r\nFloyd, 291 S.C. 427,354 S.E.2d 40, 45 (Ct. App. 1987) (citing Welch v. Whitaker,\r\n282 S.C. 251, 317 S.E.2d 758 (Ct. App. 1984) (emphasis added). In addressing\r\nthe issue of hindsight in medical actions, the Court of Appeals has stated: \"The\r\nphysician's chief concern when treating a patient should be the patient's best\r\ninterests and not what a lay jury, untrained in medicine and employing perfect\r\nhindsight, might later conclude he or she should have disclosed.\" Hook v. \r\nRothstein, 281 S.C. 541, 553, 316 S.E.2d 690, 697-98 (Ct. App. 1984) (emphasis\r\nadded). \r\n  \r\np.38\r\n\r\nKEATON, et al. v. GREENVILLE HOSPITAL SYSTEM, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though the jury charge in the present case was not a word for word\r\nquotation of previous case law, we believe that the charge adequately covered\r\nthe law of South Carolina medical malpractice. \"The substance of the law is\r\nwhat must be instructed to the jury, not any particular verbiage.\" State v. \r\nSmith, 315 S.C. 547,554,446 S.E.2d 411) 415 (1994). The contested part of the\r\nhindsight jury charge states: \"In considering whether a physician, a resident,\r\nor nurse has exercised reasonable judgment in a given case, you must consider\r\nsuch judgment in relation to the facts as they existed at the time the judgment\r\nwas made, and not in light of what hindsight may reveal.\" Patient opposed the\r\nhindsight charge at trial by saying, \"my problem with the hindsight charge is\r\nthat basically any records review by a medical expert is a review technically in\r\nhindsight.\" Since his experts gained their knowledge from records reviews,\r\nPatient was concerned that the charge gave the impression that in order to\r\ntestify as an expert, the doctor had to be in the emergency room. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe believe that Patient's argument is not supported by a reasonable\r\ninterpretation of this jury charge. A common theme in the area of medical\r\nmalpractice is that the jury must look at the doctor's actions \"under similar\r\nconditions and in like circumstances.\" The hindsight jury charge in this case\r\nmerely elucidated the meanings of \"similar circumstances\" and \"like conditions.\"\r\nThe jury charge did not restrict record reviews as Patient claims. The trial\r\njudge even instructed the jurors that: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[Y]ou and I don't know what the standards are, and you have to\r\ndetermine the facts and circumstances that existed on the date and\r\n time in question when this child was brought into the emergency\r\nroom. And in evaluating, determining what the standard of care is,\r\nyou have to have expert testimony as to what the doctor, the\r\nhospital, the residents, and the nurses should or should not have\r\ndone based on those circumstances. In giving their opinions, the \r\nexperts must review the records at the time of the incident.\r\n(Emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"In reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the court's jury charge\r\nas a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial. If, as a whole,\r\nthe charges are reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be\r\nmisleading do not constitute reversible error.\" Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319\r\nS.C. 531, 462 S.E.2d 321, 330 (Ct. App. 1995) (citing Manning v. Dial, 271 S.C.\r\n79) 245 S.E.2d 120 (1978); Dickard v. Merritt, 256 S.C. 458, 182 S.E.2d 886\r\n(1971); State v. Barksdale, 3 11 S.C. 210, 428 S.E.2d 498 (Ct. App. 1993)). When \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.39\r\n\r\nKEATON, et al. v. GREENVILLE HOSPITAL SYSTEM, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviewing the challenged portion of the jury charge \"as a whole\" with the rest of\r\nthe judge's instruction, we believe the trial court adequately charged South\r\nCarolina law. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nEven if this Court assumed the hindsight charge was confusing, any effect\r\nthat resulted from this charge does not warrant reversal. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[Al confusing charge alone is insufficient to warrant reversal. State \r\nv. Jefferies, 316 S.C. 131 446 S.E.2d 427 (1994). Jury instructions\r\nmust be considered as a whole, and if, as a whole, they are\r\nreasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be\r\nmisleading do not constitute reversible error. State v. Barksdale,\r\n311 S.C. 210) 428 S.E.2d 498 (Ct. App. 1993). When reviewing a\r\ntrial judge's instruction for error, this court must consider the\r\ninstructions in their entirety. State v. Andrews, 324 S.C. 516) 479\r\nS.E.2d 808 (Ct. App. 1996). In order to find the error harmless, we\r\nmust determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the error\r\ncomplained of did not contribute to the verdict. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nState v.

Enterprises, Inc.. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBURNETT, A.J.: We granted a writ of certiorari to review\r\nthe decision of the Court of Appeals in B.L.G. Enterprises, Inc. v. First \r\nFinancial Ins. Co., 328 S.C. 374, 491 S.E.2d 695 (Ct App. 1997). We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nB.L.G. Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a The Alley Bar (BLG), instituted\r\nthis declaratory judgment action against Respondent First Financial\r\nInsurance Company (First Financial) to determine whether First Financial\r\nowed it a duty to defend and indemnify BLG in the underlying tort action\r\nbrought by Connie K. Smith and Larry James (Conservators) as co-\r\nconservators of Tina D. James. Conservators' underlying complaint alleged\r\nemployees of BLG negligently served Beverly Ann Wetterman alcoholic\r\nbeverages while she was visibly intoxicated and allowed her to leave the\r\nbar and drive a motor vehicle. It is alleged Ms. Wetterman ran a red\r\nlight and collided with the car being driven by Ms. James, causing Ms.\r\nJames severe physical and mental injuries. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the time of the accident, BLG maintained insurance with\r\nFirst Financial. First Financial argued, however, the insurance policy\r\nspecifically excluded coverage for dram shop liability. Conservators argued\r\n1) an endorsement to the original policy provided dram shop liability\r\ncoverage or 2) the endorsement created an ambiguity in the policy's\r\ncoverage and, therefore, the policy is deemed to provide dram shop liability\r\ncoverage. The master-in-equity ruled in favor of BLG and Conservators.\r\nFinding the endorsement did not apply to the dram shop liability exclusion\r\nand, hence, did not conflict with the policy, the Court of Appeals reversed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.2\r\n\r\nB.L.G. ENTERPRISES v. FIRST FINANCIAL INS. CO., ET AL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. The Court granted Conservators' petition for a writ of certiorari.1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by holding First Financial had no\r\nduty to defend and indemnify BLG in the underlying suit? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the time of the underlying accident, BLG had insurance\r\nwith First Financial. 'The insurance policy consisted of two coverages:\r\n\"Owners', Landlords', and Tenants' Liability Insurance\" and \"Completed\r\nOperations and Products Liability Insurance.\"2 Both coverages describe\r\nBLG's premise - operations as \"taverns\" and products as \"tavern.\" In\r\nrelevant part, the \"Completed Operations and Products Liability\r\nInsurance\" provides: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCOVERAGE A - BODILY INJURY LIABILITY\r\nCOVERAGE B - PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY \r\n  \r\nThe company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums\r\nwhich the insured shall become legally obligated to pay\r\nas damages because of \r\n  \r\nA. bodily injury or\r\nB. property damage \r\n  \r\nto which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence,\r\nif the bodily injury or property damage is included within\r\nthe completed operations or the products hazard, and the\r\ncompany shall have the right and duty to defend any suit\r\nagainst the insured seeking damages on account of such\r\nbodily injury or property damage, . . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nExclusions \r\n  \r\n\r\n1BLG did not participate at the Court of Appeals or in the present\r\npetition for a writ of certiorari. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2Completed operations coverage was excluded. \r\n  \r\np.3\r\n\r\nB.L.G. ENTERPRISES v. FIRST FINANCIAL INS. CO., ET AL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis insurance does not apply: \r\n  \r\n(b) to bodily injury or property damage for which\r\nthe insured may be held liable\r\n(1) as a person or organization engaged in the\r\nbusiness of manufacturing, distributing,\r\nselling or serving alcoholic beverages, or\r\n(2) if not so engaged, as an owner or lessor of\r\npremises used for such purposes, if such\r\nliability is imposed\r\n(1) by; or because of the violation of, any\r\nstatute; ordinance or regulation pertaining to\r\nthe sale, gift, distribution or use of any\r\nalcoholic beverage, or\r\n(ii) by reason of the selling, serving or giving\r\nof any alcoholic beverage to a minor or to a\r\nperson under the influence of alcohol or which\r\ncauses or contributes to the intoxication of\r\nany person:\r\nbut part (ii) of this exclusion does not apply\r\nwith respect to liability of the insured as an\r\nowner or lessor described in (2) above;3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(underline added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOriginally, the insurance policy defined \"products hazard\" as\r\nfollows: \r\n  \r\n\"Products hazard\" includes bodily injury and property\r\ndamage arising out of the named insured's products or\r\nreliance upon a representation or warranty made at any\r\ntime with respect thereto, but only if the bodily injury or\r\nproperty damage occurs away from the premises owned \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 The \"Owners', Landlords' and Tenants' Liability Insurance\" provides\r\ncoverage for: \"an occurrence and arising out of the ownership,\r\nmaintenance or use of the insured premises and all operations necessary\r\nor incidental thereto . . . .\" Exclusion h of the \"Owners', Landlords' and\r\nTenants' Liability Insurance\" is identical to Exclusion b in the \"Completed\r\nOperations and Products Liability\" policy. \r\n  \r\np.4\r\n\r\nB.L.G. ENTERPRISES v. FIRST FINANCIAL INS. CO., ET AL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby or rented to the named insured and after physical\r\npossession of such products has been relinquished to\r\nothers; \r\n  \r\n(underline added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAn endorsement to the policy provides: \r\n  \r\nPRODUCTS HAZARD REDEFINED \r\n  \r\nThis endorsement modifies such insurance as is afforded\r\nby the policy relating to the following: \r\n  \r\nCOMPREHENSIVE GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE\r\nCOMPLETED OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS LIABILITY INSURANCE \r\n  \r\nIt is agreed that with respect to bodily injury or property\r\ndamage arising out of the named insured's products\r\nmanufactured, sold, handled or distributed \r\n  \r\n(1) on, from or in connection with the use of any\r\npremises described in this endorsement, or \r\n  \r\n(2) in connection with the conduct of any operation\r\ndescribed in this endorsement, when conducted by or on\r\nbehalf of the named insured, the definition of \"products\r\nhazard\" is amended to read as follows: \r\n  \r\n\"products hazard\" includes bodily injury and property\r\ndamage arising out of (a) the named insured's products\r\nor (b) reliance upon a representation or warranty made\r\nwith respect thereto; but only if the bodily injury or\r\nproperty damage occurs after physical possession of such\r\nproducts has been relinquished to others; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nConservators maintain the dram shop exclusion should not be\r\nenforced because it effectively bars all liability coverage for injury due to\r\nthe sale of alcohol which, as a tavern, is the very coverage BLG sought to\r\nacquire. They further assert, because BLG is a tavern, the language of \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.5\r\n\r\nB.L.G. ENTERPRISES v. FIRST FINANCIAL INS. CO., ET AL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe policy and dram shop exclusion is ambiguous and, therefore, should be\r\nconstrued in favor of coverage. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt is well settled that an insurer's duty to defend is based on\r\nthe allegations of the underlying complaint. Federated Mut. Ins. Co. v.\r\nPiedmont Petroleum Corp., 314 S.C. 393, 444 S.E.2d 532 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nA liability insurer must defend any suit alleging bodily injury or property\r\ndamage seeking damages payable under the terms of the policy. Sloan\r\nConstr. Co. v. Central Nat'l Ins. Co. of Omaha, 269 S.C. 183, 236 S.E.2d\r\n818 (1977); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tate, 313 S.C. 444, 438 S.E.2d 266\r\n(Ct. App. 1993). However, an insurer has no duty to defend an insured\r\nwhere the damage was caused for a reason unambiguously excluded under\r\nthe policy. Federated-Mut. Ins. Co. v. Piedmont Petroleum Corp., supra;\r\nFalkosky v. Allstate Ins. Co., 311 S.C. 369, 429 S.E.2d 194 (Ct. App. 1993),\r\naffd as modified, 312 S.C. 210, 439 S.E.2d 836 (1993). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nInsurance policies are subject to the general rules of contract\r\nconstruction. Diamond State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Industries, Inc., 318\r\nS.C. 231, 456 S.E.2d 912 (1995); Sloan Constr. Co. v. Central Nat'l Ins..\r\nCo., supra. This Court must give policy language its plain, ordinary, and\r\npopular meaning. Fritz-Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick v. Goforth, 312 S.C. 315,\r\n440 S.E.2d 367 (1994). When a contract is unambiguous, clear, and\r\nexplicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used.\r\nC.A.N. Enterprises, Inc. v. S.C. Health &amp; Human Services Finance\r\nComm'n, 296 S.C. 373, 373 S.E.2d 584 (1988). The court's duty is \"limited\r\nto the interpretation of the contract made by the parties themselves\r\n'regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or failure [of\r\nthe parties] to guard their interests carefully.'\" 296 S.C. at 378, 373\r\nS.E.2d at 587, citin Gilstrap v. Culpepper , 283 S.C. 83, 86, 320 S.E.2d\r\n445, 447 (1984). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlthough exclusions in an insurance policy are construed\r\nagainst the insurer, Boggs v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., 272 S.C. 460, 252\r\nS.E.2d 565 (1979), insurers have the right to limit their liability and to\r\nimpose conditions on their obligations provided they are not in\r\ncontravention of public policy or a statutory prohibition. Burns v. State\r\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins, Co., 297 S.C. 520, 377 S.E.2d 569 (1989); Rhame v.\r\nNat'l Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 238 S.C. 539, 121 S.E.2d 94 (1961). \"Policies\r\nproviding products liability coverage may contain exclusions, tailored to\r\nthe business of the particular insured, designed to limit the insurer's risk\r\nexposure from hazards peculiar to that business.\" Couch on Insurance 3d, \r\n  \r\np.6\r\n\r\nB.L.G. ENTERPRISES v. FIRST FINANCIAL INS. CO., ET AL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 130:14 (1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe policy issued to BLG, a tavern, is not illusory. The\r\nOwners', Landlords', and, Tenants' portion of the policy initially provides\r\nliability coverage for an occurrence arising out of use of BLG's premises.\r\nExclusion h, however, specifically precludes coverage for bodily injury \"by\r\nreason of the selling, serving or giving of any alcoholic beverage.\"\r\n(underline added). Other coverage, however, remains intact. For instance,\r\nthe policy provides liability coverage for a patron who slips and falls at the\r\ntavern. The policy even provides coverage to an intoxicated patron who\r\nslips and falls at the 'tavern, so long as the slip and fall was not the result\r\nof the service of alcohol. See Excelsior Ins. Co. v. Pomona Park Bar &amp;\r\nPackage Store, 369 So.2d 938 (Fla. 1979). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSimilarly, the Completed Operations and Products Hazard\r\nportion of the policy initially provides coverage for products liability,\r\nincluding the distribution of a \"defective\" alcoholic beverage. Exclusion b,\r\nhowever, specifically precludes coverage for bodily injury \"by reason of the\r\nselling, serving or giving of any alcoholic beverage.\" (underline added).\r\nThe policy provides products liability coverage for injury as a result of the\r\nservice of contaminated food or non-alcoholic beverages. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe dram shop exclusion in BLG's policy with First Financial\r\nis almost identical to other liquor liability exclusions in insurance policies\r\ncovering establishments which distribute alcoholic beverages. These\r\nexclusions have been uniformly found unambiguous and upheld in\r\nnumerous jurisdictions. See Williams v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., 854\r\nF.2d 106 (5 th Cir. 1988); Hartford Ins. Co. of Southeast v. Franklin , 424\r\nS.E.2d 803 (Ga. Ct. App. 1992); Morrison on Behalf of Morrison v. Miller,\r\n452 So. 2d 390 (La. Ct. App. 1984); Mitcheson v. Izdepski, 585 N.E.2d 743\r\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1992); Sheffield Ins. Co. v. Lighthouse Properties, Inc., 763\r\nP.2d 669 (Mont. 1988); New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Hillwinds Inn, Inc., 373\r\nA.2d 354 (N.H. 1977); U.S. Fidelity and Guar. v.

Piedmont Petroleum Corp., supra, the\r\nCourt of Appeals considered whether an insurance company which issued \r\n  \r\np.7\r\n\r\nB.L.G. ENTERPRISES v. FIRST FINANCIAL INS. CO., ET AL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncite no cases to the contrary and we have found no authority to the\r\ncontrary.5 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFirst Financial chose to exclude from coverage bodily injury\r\nand property damage by reason of the distribution of alcoholic beverages\r\nby BLG. The language in the policy clearly and unambiguously reflects\r\nthis exclusion. Accordingly, the exclusion should be enforced. C.A.N.\r\nEnterprises, Inc. v. S.C. Health &amp; Human Services Finance Comm'n, supra\r\n(when an insurance policy is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be\r\nconstrued according to the terms the parties have used). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlternatively, Conservators maintain the endorsement provides\r\ncoverage for bodily injury and property damage arising out of the use of\r\nBLG's product, alcoholic beverages, and therefore conflicts with the dram\r\nshop exclusion in the original insurance policy. According to Conservators,\r\nthis conflict must be construed against First Financial. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhen construing an insurance policy containing an\r\nendorsement, the policy and the endorsement are to be read\r\ntogether. The policy remains in full force and effect to the\r\nextent its terms are modified by the words of the endorsement.\r\nIf a provision of the policy conflicts with a provision of the\r\nendorsement, the latter controls. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nliability coverage with a liquor liability exclusion to a gas\r\nstation/convenience store was required to defend and indemnify the\r\nbusiness against a plaintiff who was injured after a minor purchased\r\nalcohol from the business. The legitimacy of the exclusion was not at\r\nissue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n5 The policy in this case is distinguishable from an insurance policy\r\nissued to a tavern which contained an \"absolute liquor exclusion\"\r\nprecluding coverage for bodily injury or damage \"arising out of or in\r\nconnection with the manufacturing, selling, distributing, serving or\r\nfurnishing of any alcoholic beverages.\" An absolute liquor exclusion in a\r\npolicy covering a tavern is illusory. Monticello Ins. Co. v. Mike's\r\nSpeedway Lounge, Inc., 949 F. Supp. 649 (S.D. Ind. 1996). \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nB.L.G. ENTERPRISES v. FIRST FINANCIAL INS. CO., ET AL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLong v. Adams, 280 S.C. 401, 405-6, 312 S.E.2d 262, 265 (Ct. App. 1984).6 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"[Ulnder well-established principles [the endorsement]\r\nsupersedes any inconsistent provision contained in the general terms of\r\nthe policy and in case of conflict, the endorsement controls.\" McIntosh v.\r\nWhieldo , 205 S.C. 119, 127, 30 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1944); see Couch on\r\nInsurance 3d, Â§ 21:22 (\"[W]hile an endorsement is not to be construed\r\nmore broadly than the fair import of its terms considered in connection\r\nwith the whole of the policy, . . . when ... endorsement modifies,\r\nqualifies, or restricts the terms of the original policy, the ... endorsement\r\ncontrols.\"); 13A J. Appleman Insurance Law and Practice Â§ 7537\r\n(1976)(policy and endorsement should be construed together unless they\r\nare so much in conflict that they cannot be reconciled; in such case, the\r\nendorsement controls). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn this argument, Conservators do not contend the dram shop\r\nexclusion does not apply under the original terms of the policy. Instead,\r\nthey assert the endorsement, by using the language \"arising out of the\r\nnamed insured's products,\" provides liability coverage for personal injury\r\nor property damage arising out of the service of alcoholic beverages and\r\nthereby eliminates the dram shop exclusion in the original policy. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe only difference between the original policy and the\r\nendorsement is that in the former, the definition of products hazard\r\nrequired the bodily injury or property damage to occur away from the\r\npremises. Under the definition in the endorsement, there is no such\r\nrequirement. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThere is no conflict between the original policy and the\r\nendorsement. Read in its entirety,7 the endorsement does not provide\r\nliability coverage where the distribution of alcoholic beverages results in\r\nbodily injury or property damage. It does not modify, limit, or in any way\r\naffect the dram shop exclusion in the original policy. It simply redefines\r\n\"products hazard.\" Accordingly, there is no ambiguity between the dram\r\nshop exclusion and the endorsement, and no reason for the endorsement to\r\nsupersede the policy. See State Auto. Ins. Ass'n v. Young Men's \r\n  \r\n\r\n6See Couch on Insurance 3d, Â§ 21:21. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7We note the endorsement is entitled \"Products Hazard Redefined.\" \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nB.L.G. ENTERPRISES v.

McGuire, all\r\nof Columbia, for Petitioner/Respondent.\r\nWALLER, A.J.: Respondent-Petitioner Harold Gibson (Gibson)\r\npleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to twenty-one\r\nyears in prison. He did not appeal the conviction or sentence. \r\n  \r\np.11\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGibson filed a post-conviction relief (PCR) application dated March\r\n2, 1995. A circuit judge granted Gibson a new trial based on a Brady1 violation,\r\nbut rejected Gibson's argument the prosecutor had committed misconduct.\r\nPetitioner-Respondent (the State) and Gibson contend the judge erred. We\r\naffirm in part and reverse in part. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nThe State accused Gibson of murdering a long-time friend, Bobby M.\r\nGriffin (victim), in a late-night shooting at Gibson's bar in 1989. From the\r\nbeginning, Gibson claimed the shooting was an accident. He and other witnesses\r\ntold police he fired a nine-mm automatic handgun into the wall of his bar to\r\nsubdue the victim, who had been drinking, and convince everyone to leave.\r\nGibson told police everyone left, then the victim went back inside the bar to\r\nconfront Gibson again. Gibson suspected the victim was armed. Gibson, holding\r\nthe handgun only by the butt and not the trigger, slapped the victim on the\r\nforehead with the gun. The gun fired; a bullet struck the victim in the forehead\r\nand killed him. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe key evidence consisted of the testimony of two alleged\r\neyewitnesses, Robert Peterson and Anna Lanier Ross. Peterson told police he\r\nfollowed the victim and Gibson back into the bar after Gibson had ordered\r\neveryone to leave. Peterson corroborated Gibson's version of events, particularly\r\nthe statements that the gun went off after Gibson struck Griffin with it.  Ross,\r\nwho was the victim's girlfriend, told police she went to a window and looked\r\ninside after the victim went back into the bar. She claimed she \"saw [Gibson]\r\npoint the pistol at [the victim] and shoot him.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFour other witnesses told police that Ross either was sitting in her\r\ncar or standing next to it when the fatal shot was fired. She ran inside only after\r\nthe shot was fired to find the victim dying on the floor, according to the\r\nwitnesses. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGibson filed a discovery motion pursuant to Brady and Rule 5,\r\nSCRCrimP. Gibson pleaded guilty after a jury had been selected, which resulted\r\nin the prosecutor describing the statements of Peterson and Ross to the judge. \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). \r\n\r\n p.12\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor said Peterson told police the gun discharged after Gibson struck\r\nthe victim with it. the prosecutor said that \"another witness, [Ross], was\r\noutside and indicates that she saw a different version with the defendant having\r\npointed the gun at the victim's head.\" The prosecutor did not reveal any changes\r\nRoss had made in her story or any misgivings about the veracity of her potential\r\ntestimony. Petitioner pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter after answering\r\nthe usual questions regarding his constitutional rights.\r\nIn February 1992, the victim's family sued an insurance company\r\nin an effort to collect under an accidental death provision of the victim's life\r\ninsurance policy. Gibson learned for the first time through the testimony of\r\ninvestigating officers that they and the prosecutor had visited the crime scene\r\nwith Ross. Gibson also learned the officers did not believe Ross's statement that\r\nshe saw the shooting through the window because her view would have been\r\nblocked by curtains and a Donkey Kong video game. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRoss testified in the civil trial that she opened the door of the bar to\r\nsee Gibson point the gun at the victim and shoot him. Three witnesses told the\r\njury the same thing they had told police during the investigation, i.e., that Ross\r\nwas either in or beside her car when the shooting occurred and could not have\r\nseen what happened inside the bar. In addition, it was raining and sleeting that\r\nnight, and the door of the bar was equipped with a device that automatically\r\nclosed it. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGibson testified in the civil trial that he repeatedly tried to calm the\r\nvictim, who had been his friend and a fellow logging truck driver for twenty\r\nyears, and make him leave the bar peacefully. When the victim came back\r\ninside the bar, Gibson believed he was armed because the victim kept his hand\r\ndown by his side. Gibson grabbed his handgun by the butt and hit the victim on\r\nthe left side of his head, hoping to \"knock some sense into him.\" He was shocked\r\nwhen the gun discharged because he had not pulled the trigger. Gibson held the\r\nvictim in his arms until he died a few minutes later. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, petitioner's trial attorney testified he visited\r\nthe crime scene with Gibson. The attorney was fully prepared to impeach Ross\r\nin an effort to discredit her claim that she had witnessed the shooting through\r\nthe window. He recognized, however, that determining how the shooting\r\noccurred was a factual issue for the jury. The attorney testified he knew police\r\nand prosecutors did not believe Ross's statements were credible, but did not \r\n  \r\np.13\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecall receiving any information that the prosecutor had taken Ross to the scene\r\nto discuss her statements. In his estimation, the investigating officers and the\r\nprosecutor simply confirmed his belief that Ross was not credible. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial attorney's co-counsel testified he visited the scene with the\r\nattorney and Gibson to collect evidence to discredit Ross's claims. At the time\r\nof Gibson's guilty plea, the co-counsel did not know police and the prosecutor did\r\nnot believe Ross's claims; nor did he know they had taken Ross to the scene to\r\nconfront her. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe prosecutor testified that, after confronting Ross at the scene,\r\nthere \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\ncame a time when I was convinced that she could not\r\nsee what she said she saw from where she said she saw\r\nit. She said she was standing at a window looking in\r\nthe bar. And we looked at some pictures and there was\r\na Donkey [Kong] machine in front of that window when\r\nthe pictures were taken of the scene that night and we\r\ndetermined that she could not have seen through that\r\nwindow. And I confronted her with that and she never\r\ndenied seeing what she said she saw in the bar. She\r\nthen began to hedge on where she was standing. She\r\nsaid, well, maybe I wasn't there, maybe I was at the\r\ndoor or something to that effect. She still said she saw\r\nwhat she saw and she never wavered on that. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe prosecutor testified he told Gibson's attorney that Ross could not\r\nhave seen what she claimed. The prosecutor did not recall whether he also told\r\nGibson's attorney that he had reached his conclusion after confronting Ross\r\nat the scene and hearing her change her story. When pressed further, the\r\nprosecutor testified he could not recall exactly when Ross changed her story. He\r\ndid not document the changes to Ross's previous statement in writing. If the\r\ncase went to trial, the prosecutor intended to offer Ross's testimony, then place\r\nan investigator from his office on the stand to testify that a person could not see\r\ninside the bar through that window. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Two investigating officers testified, as they had at the civil insurance\r\ntrial, that they did not believe Ross could have seen the shooting through the \r\n  \r\np.14\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwindow. They corroborated the prosecutor's testimony about confronting Ross\r\nat the scene and her continued insistence that she saw the shooting. However,\r\nthe officers did not recall Ross ever changing her statement to say she must have\r\nseen the shooting through the door. Neither officer told Gibson's attorney\r\nverbally or in any written report given to the attorney that they had taken Ross\r\nto the scene. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGibson testified he struck the victim with the gun and it fired\r\naccidentally. He believed the prosecutor planned to use Ross's testimony at trial.\r\nHe knew Ross was lying, but had no way of proving it. His attorney said he\r\nthought he could prove Ross was lying, but no one ever told him that Ross had\r\nchanged her statement to say she must have se en the shooting through the door\r\nafter the prosecutor and police confronted her at the scene. Nor did anyone ever\r\ntell Gibson that the prosecutor and police were convinced she was lying, Gibson\r\ntestified. If he had known those facts, he would have stood trial instead of\r\npleading guilty, Gibson testified.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe PCR judge, after considering oral arguments as well as\r\nmemoranda from both parties, ruled the State had violated Brady by failing to\r\nfully disclose all material exculpatory or impeachment evidence regarding Ross's\r\nstatements. The prosecutor should have disclosed the visit to the scene with\r\nRoss and the material change in her testimony. The judge ruled that \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n [t]his information was material regardless of defense\r\n counsel's independent knowledge of the physical\r\n parameters of the crime scene. Defense counsel could \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 In other testimony at the PCR hearing, Gibson's wife and sister testified\r\nthat Gibson's attorney told them that Ross's testimony would be \"very\r\ndamaging.\" The attorney also told them that Peterson, the other eyewitness,\r\nwould not be credible because he had suffered a stroke and short term memory\r\nloss. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTwo pathologists, including the one who performed the autopsy, testified\r\nthey found nothing that would conflict with Gibson's version of events. Gibson's\r\nhandgun did not have safeguards used on newer models to prevent such\r\naccidental firings, although Gibson was unable to find an expert who could\r\ndefinitively testify the gun accidentally fired as he said it did. \r\n  \r\np.15\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave challenged [Ross's] veracity merely on the basis of\r\nthe measurements he had taken himself. However, the\r\nwithheld information provided an infinitely stronger\r\nbasis for challenging the prosecution's key witness and\r\nfor exculpating the defendant . . . . Only in its full form\r\ndid the information constitute evidence with\r\nexculpatory or impeachment value. By contrast, the\r\ninformation actually provided, that the prosecution\r\nbelieved [Ross] could not have seen through the\r\nwindow, was inadmissible into evidence and thus,\r\ninherently - lacking in exculpatory or impeachment\r\nvalue. . . . [T]here is a grave difference between\r\nthinking you can impeach a witness and knowing that\r\nthe State has established that the witness's sworn\r\nstatements are untrue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe PCR judge set aside Gibson's guilty plea and granted him a new trial based\r\non the Brady violation. The judge also ruled the prosecutor had not committed\r\nmisconduct. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.  Does probative evidence support the PCR judge's\r\n ruling that Gibson is entitled to a new trial on\r\n the basis of a Brady violation? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2.  Does probative evidence support the PCR judge's\r\n ruling that the prosecutor did not commit\r\n misconduct? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. BRADY VIOLATION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State contends the PCR judge erred in granting Gibson a new\r\ntrial on the basis of a Brady violation. The State asserts that Gibson's attorney\r\nbelieved he could effectively impeach Ross and had told Gibson so. \"Based on the\r\ntestimony at the PCR hearing, it is clear that the outcome of the proceedings\r\nwould not have changed; [Gibson] would not have proceeded to trial even if the\r\nsolicitor specifically informed defense counsel that the State's witness had been\r\ntaken to the crime scene,\" the State argues. Gibson pleaded guilty because he \r\n  \r\np.16\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknew he would receive no less than a voluntary manslaughter conviction if he\r\nstood trial, the State contends. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA defendant who pleads guilty usually may not later raise\r\nindependent claims of constitutional violations. See Rivers v. Strickland, 264\r\nS.C. 121, 124, 213 S.E.2d 97, 98 (1975) (stating \"[t]he general rule is that\r\na plea of guilty, voluntarily and understandingly made, constitutes a waiver of\r\nnonjurisdictional defects and defenses, including claims of violation of\r\nconstitutional rights prior to the plea\"). However, \"a defendant's decision\r\nwhether or not to plead guilty is often heavily influenced by his appraisal of the\r\nprosecution's case.\" Sanchez v. United States, 50 F.3d 1448, 1453 (9th Cir.\r\n1995); accord Gusting v. State, 325 S.C. 123, 127-28, 480 S.E.2d 444, 446 (1997)\r\n( \"waivers of constitutional rights not only must be voluntary but must be\r\nknowing, intelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant\r\ncircumstances and likely consequences\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhen a defendant lacks knowledge of material evidence in the\r\nprosecution's possession, the waiver of constitutional rights cannot be deemed\r\nknowing and voluntary. Sanchez, 50 F.3d at 1453; accord White v. United\r\nStates, 858 F.2d 416, 420-22 (8th Cir. 1988) (adopting same principle); Miller v.\r\nAngliker, 848 F.2d 1312,1319-20 (2d Cir. 1988) (adopting same principle); Royal\r\nv. Netherland, 4 F. Supp.2d 540, 566 (E.D. Va. 1998) (stating same principle);\r\nNew York v. Burney, 642 N.Y.S.2d 990, 992 (N.Y. Sup. 1996) (collecting cases\r\nand noting the federal trend permitting defendants to pursue such claims even\r\nthough Brady and its progeny do not address the withholding of Brady material\r\nprior to the entry of a guilty plea). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"The government's obligation to make such disclosures [of Brady\r\nmaterial] is pertinent not only to an accused's preparation for trial but also to his\r\ndetermination of whether or not to plead guilty. The defendant is entitled to\r\nmake that decision with full awareness of favorable material evidence known to\r\nthe government.\" United States v. Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir.1998).\r\nAccordingly, Gibson may challenge the voluntary nature of his guilty plea in a\r\nPCR action by asserting an alleged Brad violation. E.g., Carter v. State, 329\r\nS.C. 355) 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998) (illustrating an applicant may challenge the\r\nvoluntary nature of a guilty plea in a PCR action). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n A Brady claim is based upon the requirement of due process. Such\r\na claim is complete if the accused can demonstrate (1) the evidence was \r\n  \r\np.17\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfavorable to the accused, (2) it was in the possession of or known to the\r\nprosecution,3 (3) it was suppressed by the prosecution, and (4) it was material\r\nto guilt or punishment. Kyles v.Whitle , 514 U.S. 419, _, 115 S.Ct. 1555,\r\n1565-69,131L.Ed.2d 490, 505-10 (1995); Brady, 373 U.S.at 87, 83 S.Ct.at1196,\r\n10 L.Ed.2d at 218; State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 241, 471 S.E.2d 689, 693\r\n(1996). This rule applies to impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory\r\nevidence. United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87\r\nL.Ed.2d 481, 490 (1985); State v. Von Dohlen, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGibson's case falls into the third of three distinct categories of Brady\r\nviolations identified by the Supreme Court in United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S.\r\n971 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). Those categories are (1) cases that\r\ninclude nondisclosed evidence of perjured testimony about which the prosecutor\r\nknew or should have known, (2) cases in which the defendant specifically\r\nrequested the nondisclosed evidence, and (3) cases in which the defendant made\r\nno request or only a general request for Brady material. Id. at 103-107, 96 S.Ct.\r\nat 2397-99, 49 L.Ed.2d at 349-52. Gibson's pre-trial Brady motion requested\r\n[a]ll information of whatever form . . . which tends to exculpate the defendant\r\neither through the potential impeachment of any State witness and all\r\ninformation of whatever form . . . which may lead to evidence which tends to\r\nexculpate the defendant . . . or impeaching the credibility of any potential\r\nState's witness. . . .\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn \"specific request\" and \"general- or no-request\" situations,\r\n\"favorable evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its\r\nsuppression by the government, if there is a reasonably probability that, had the\r\nevidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 Brady and its progeny place the burden upon the prosecutor to know all\r\nthe relevant facts of a case in order to decide what information to disclose as\r\nexculpatory or impeachment evidence. Kyles v. Whitle 514 U.S. 419, _, 115\r\nS.Ct. 15552 1567-68, 131 L.Ed.2d 490, 508 (1995) (prosecutor can establish\r\nprocedures and regulations to carry the State's burden of disclosure and to\r\nensure communication of all relevant information on each case to every lawyer\r\nwho deals with it); accord State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. at 240, 471 S.E.2d at\r\n693 (information known to investigative agencies may be imputable to\r\nprosecutor, but prosecutor has no duty to go on fishing expedition to find\r\nexculpatory or impeachment evidence). \r\n  \r\np.18\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen different . . . . A reasonable probability of a different result is accordingly\r\nshown when the Government's evidentiary suppression undermines confidence\r\n in the outcome of the trial.\" Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. at _, 115 S.Ct. at 1565\r\n 662 131 L.Ed.2d at 505-06 (internal quotes omitted); accord State v. Von Dohlen,\r\n322 S.C. at 241, 471 S.E.2d at 693.4 The court must consider the suppressed\r\nevidence collectively, not on an item-by-item basis. Kyles v. Whitle , 514 U.S.\r\nat 115 S.Ct. at 1567, 131 L.Ed.2d at 507. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe standard for deciding the materiality of a Brady violation in the\r\ncontext of a guilty plea is a novel issue in South Carolina. We adopt the\r\nstandard applied by other courts, which essentially is the same standard that is\r\napplied in the context of a. trial: A Brady violation is material when there is a\r\nreasonable probability that, but for the government's failure to disclose Brady\r\nevidence, the defendant would have refused to plead guilty and gone to trial.\r\nSee Sanchez v. United States, 50 F.3d at 1454; Banks v. United States, 920 F. Supp.\r\n688, 692 (E.D. Va. 1996) (noting that Second, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuit\r\nCourts of Appeal have adopted such a view).5 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe overriding theme of the Brady cases is the emphasis the\r\nSupreme Court has placed on the prosecutor's responsibility for fair play. In\r\nclose cases, \"the prudent prosecutor will resolve doubtful questions in favor of\r\ndisclosure. This is as it should be. Such disclosures will serve to justify trust in \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 A defendant who alleges a Brady violation in the first category, the\r\nprosecutor's use of perjured testimony, must clear a lower hurdle in proving\r\nmateriality. In such situations, \"a conviction obtained by the knowing use of\r\nperjured testimony is fundamentally unfair, and must be set aside if there is any\r\nreasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the outcome\r\nof the jury.\" United States v. Bagle, 473 U.S. at 678, 105 S.Ct. at 3381-82, 87\r\nL.Ed.2d at 492. That category is not at issue in Gibson's case. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n5 The Sanchez standard also is similar to the ordinary PCR standard for\r\ndetermining whether a guilty plea should be set aside due to the ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel. E.g., Alexander v. State, 303 S.C. 539, 402 S.E.2d 484\r\n(1991) (where there has been a guilty plea, the applicant must prove counsel's\r\nrepresentation fell below the standard of reasonableness and, but for counsel's\r\nunprofessional errors, there is a reasonable probability he would not have\r\npleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial) (citing Hill v. Lockhart,\r\n474 U.S. 52~ 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985)). \r\n  \r\np.19\r\n\r\nGIBSON v.

And it will tend to preserve the criminal trial, as distinct from the\r\nprosecutor's private deliberations, as the chosen forum for ascertaining the truth\r\nabout criminal accusations.\" Kyles v.

State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989)\r\n(appellate court must affirm PCR judge's findings when they are supported by\r\nany evidence of probative value). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe record reveals that the prosecutor told Gibson's attorney that\r\nRoss could not have seen what she claimed, i.e., that Gibson pointed the gun at\r\nthe victim and fired. The investigating officers told Gibson's attorney they had\r\nreached the same conclusion. Gibson knew his attorney believed he could\r\nimpeach Ross's testimony. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNeither the prosecutor nor the detectives, however, disclosed to\r\nGibson that Ross had changed her statement to say that, even if she had not\r\nseen the shooting from the window, she must have seen it through the door. Nor\r\ndid they reveal the on-the-scene confrontation that prompted Ross to change her\r\nprevious statement. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn applying the Brady analysis, first, the withheld evidence was\r\nfavorable to Gibson because it was additional proof of Ross's alleged lies.\r\nSecond, the evidence was in the possession of and known to the prosecutor.\r\nThird, the prosecutor suppressed the evidence by failing to reveal it. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFinally, as to the prong upon which Brady violations often rise or\r\nfall, we agree with the PCR judge's ruling that the withheld evidence was\r\nmaterial. It is reasonably probable that, had the prosecutor revealed the\r\nsuppressed information, Gibson would have chosen to stand trial instead of\r\npleading guilty. Instead of merely hoping he could impeach Ross as a liar,\r\nGibson would have known about Ross's inconsistent statements and the\r\nrevealing on-the-scene confrontation. He likely could have challenged the\r\nprosecutor's effort to put her on the stand as the impermissible solicitation of \r\n  \r\np.20\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperjured testimony. Compare Banks v. United States, 920 F. Supp. at 691-93\r\n(finding it was reasonably probable that defendant would have stood trial if he\r\nhad known the government's key witness had enjoyed conjugal visits with his\r\nwife and girlfriend in government offices) with United States v. Avellino, 136\r\nF.3d at 254-59 (finding it was not reasonably probable that defendant would\r\nhave stood trial if prosecutors had given him additional undisclosed evidence\r\nabout informant's narcotics trafficking, where prosecutors already had turned\r\nover extensive information about informant's atrocious criminal record that\r\nincluded nine murders, narcotics offenses, extortion, hijacking, and burglary). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe also agree with the PCR judge's ruling that the information\r\nactually provided, the prosecutor's conclusion that Ross could not have seen\r\nwhat she claimed, was of little help to Gibson. That conclusion inherently lacked\r\nexculpatory or impeachment value because it was not admissible at trial. The\r\nBrady analysis focuses upon facts known to the State, not the prosecutor's\r\nconclusions. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGibson contends the PCR judge erred in ruling that, although the\r\nprosecutor committed a Brady violation, he did not commit misconduct. The\r\nprosecutor described Ross's potential testimony, which he knew to be a lie, to the\r\njudge at the guilty plea without revealing his reservations about Ross's veracity,\r\nhis visit to the scene with her, or inconsistencies in her statements, Gibson\r\nasserts. Any use of Ross's testimony at trial would have constituted a use of\r\nperjured testimony in violation of ethical rules, Gibson argues. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs explained above, the prosecutor committed a Brady violation by\r\nnot disclosing certain evidence to Gibson. A Brady violation is one type of\r\nprosecutorial misconduct. It is misconduct of a different type than, for instance,\r\nan attempt to introduce inadmissible evidence, tamper with the jury, or some\r\nother inappropriate action. E.g., United States v. Alderdyce, 787 F.2d 1365,\r\n1370 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct giving rise\r\nto a Brady violation); Buffington v. Copeland, 687 F. Supp. 1089, 1095-96 (W.D.\r\nTex. 1988) (distinguishing Brady violations from other types of prosecutorial\r\nmisconduct in which, for example, a prosecutor tries to inject prejudice into a\r\ntrial by introducing inadmissible evidence or making inappropriate opening\r\nstatements or closing arguments). \r\n  \r\np.21\r\n\r\nGIBSON v. STATE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not matter whether the prosecutor's misconduct in failing to\r\nreveal Brady evidence is due to negligence or an intentional act because a court\r\nmay find a Brady violation irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the\r\nprosecutor. \"Brady is based on a sense of fairness, and a belief that society gains\r\nwhen a defendant is accorded a fair trial. The focus is not on the misconduct of\r\nthe Prosecutor, but on the fairness of the procedure.\" New York v. Jackson, 593\r\nN.Y. S. 2 d 410, 417 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1992). As the Supreme Court explained in\r\nBrady, \"[t]he principle . . . is not punishment of society for misdeeds of a\r\nprosecutor but avoidance of an unfair trial to the accused. Society wins not only\r\nwhen the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair[.]\" Brady, 373\r\nU.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1197, 10 L.Ed.2d at 218. \"If the suppression of evidence\r\nresults in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not\r\nthe character of the prosecutor.\" United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. at 110, 96\r\nS.Ct. at 2401, 49 L.Ed.2d at 353. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe PCR judge's ruling in this, case is inconsistent because the\r\nprosecutor committed misconduct by violating Brady. Accordingly, we reverse\r\nthe judge's ruling on this issue.6 We note that when a Brady violation is found,\r\nit is unnecessary for the judge to make an additional ruling on prosecutorial\r\nmisconduct unless the prosecutor engaged in other types of misconduct not\r\nrelated to the Brady violation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe affirm the PCR judge's decision to set aside Gibson's guilty plea\r\nand grant him a new trial based on the Brady violation. We reverse the PCR\r\njudge's erroneous ruling on the issue of prosecutorial misconduct. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, MOORE, and BURNETT, ii., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n6 Our use of the term \"misconduct\" in the context of a Brady violation is\r\nnot necessarily synonymous with misconduct as defined in various ethical rules\r\nthat govern lawyers. See the Rules of Professional Conduct contained in Rule\r\n407, SCACR. The focus of the Brady analysis is upon the fairness of the\r\nprocedure followed in a particular case.

National Health Care\r\nCenter of Sumter, Op. No. 97-UP-343 (S.C. Ct. App. refiled Sept. 11,\r\n1997). This Court granted National Health Care Center of Sumter's\r\n(National Health) petition to review the Court of Appeals' opinion.  We\r\naffirm as modified. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent, a registered nurse, worked at National Health.\r\nOn December 18, 1994, respondent was dispensing medications to the\r\nresidents of National Health. As she pushed the medication cart from a\r\ntile floor to a carpeted floor, the wheels unexpectedly jammed causing pain\r\nin respondent's lower back and right leg. Respondent finished working\r\nher shift; however, the next morning she was unable to get out of bed.\r\nRespondent made an appointment to see Dr. Davis. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nX-rays of respondent's back and legs were taken on December\r\n20, 1994. These films were essentially normal; however, they did reveal\r\nrespondent's L5-SI disc was severely deteriorated and there was a milder\r\nnarrowing and spur formation at L3-L4. Because the pain persisted,\r\nrespondent was referred to Dr. Gee, an orthopaedist. By February 8,\r\n1995, X-ray films showed the intervertebral space at L3-L4 was essentially\r\nobliterated by what Dr. Gee diagnosed as discitis, a disc space infection\r\ncaused by E. coli bacteria. Respondent was hospitalized for approximately\r\none month.. On March 13, 1995, Dr. Edwards, an orthopaedist,\r\nhospitalized respondent again and referred her to HealthSouth\r\nRehabilitation Center for physical therapy and antibiotic treatment. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe single commissioner found in favor of respondent and\r\nawarded her temporary total weekly benefits. The commissioner found the\r\njamming of the medicine cart wheels aggravated respondent's pre-existing\r\ncondition of a degenerated disc at L5-S1. Further, the commissioner found\r\nthe discitis at L&amp;IA, caused by either a stab wound or a urinary tract\r\ninfection, was aggravated by the injury of December 18, 1994. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNational Health appealed arguing respondent failed to prove\r\nher case by the preponderance of the evidence. The full Commission, the\r\ncircuit court, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the single commissioner's\r\ndecision. \r\n  \r\np.24\r\n\r\nTILLER v. NATIONAL HEALTH CARE CENTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDid the Court of Appeals fail to apply the correct standard of\r\nproof regarding the sufficiency of medical evidence in this\r\nmedically complex workers' compensation case? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNational Health argues in this medically complex case1\r\nrespondent failed to provide expert medical testimony about causation\r\nrequired by Smith v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 296, 465 S.E.2d 9 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1995), and thus did not carry her burden of proof. Specifically,\r\nNational Health argues respondent failed to establish with expert medical\r\ntestimony, stated at least to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that\r\nthe discitis was present prior to her accident on December 18, 1994.2 We \r\n  \r\n\r\n1Respondent does not deny this case is medically complex. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Both parties agree the accident did not actually cause the discitis.\r\nInstead, respondent claims the accident aggravated or accelerated the\r\ndiscitis. See Arnold v. Benjamin Booth Co., 257 S.C. 337, 185 S.E.2d~ 830\r\n(1971) (where a previously existing condition or disease is aggravated by\r\ninjury or accident arising out of or in the course of employment and \"his\r\nresults in disability, there is a compensable injury); Mullinax v. Winn-\r\nDixie Stores, Inc., 318 S.C. 431, 458 S.E.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe parties agree there are two possible sources of the E.coli\r\ninfection which caused respondent's discitis. One source could be a\r\nurinary tract infection (UTI) which was diagnosed in February 1995 or\r\nthe infection could have originated from an incident in August 1994 when\r\na nursing home resident stabbed respondent with his fork. E. coli is\r\nnormally found in the digestive tract, and the resident's fork could have\r\nbeen contaminated with digestive juices. National Health argues the\r\nsource of the infection determines whether the discitis existed at the time\r\nof the accident. According to National Health, the discitis could only be\r\npresent prior to the accident if the fork stabbing incident was the source\r\nof the infection. We disagree. The single commissioner found either the\r\nfork stabbing incident or a UTI caused the discitis which was present on\r\nDecember 18, 1994. Thus, regardless of the source of the infection, if the \r\n  \r\np.25\r\n\r\nTILLER v. NATIONAL HEALTH CARE CENTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Court must affirm the findings of fact made by the\r\nCommission if they are supported by substantial evidence. Lark v. Bi-Lo.\r\nInc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981). Substantial evidence is not a\r\nmere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a\r\nwhole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency\r\nreached. Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 317 S.C. 306, 454 S.E.2d\r\n320 (1995). Where there is a conflict in the evidence, either by different\r\nwitnesses or in the testimony of the same witness, the findings of fact of\r\nthe Commission are conclusive. Glover v. Columbia Hospital of Richland\r\nCounty, 236 S.C. 410, 114 S.E.2d 565 (1960). Indeed, the possibility of\r\ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent\r\nan administrative agency's findings from being supported by substantial\r\nevidence. Moore v. City of Easley , 322 S.C. 455, 472 S.E.2d 626 (1996).\r\nAn appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of an agency\r\nas to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact unless the agency's\r\nfindings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and\r\nsubstantial evidence on the record. Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320\r\nS.C. 515, 466 S.E.2d 357 (1996). Workers' compensation awards must not\r\nbe based on surmise, conjecture or speculation. Kennedy v. Williamsburg\r\nCounty, 242 S.C. 477, 131 S.E.2d 512 (1963). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Smith, the Court of Appeals held \"if the claimant is\r\nattempting to establish causation of a medically complex condition,\r\nhowever, expert testimony is required.\"3 Id. at 298, 465 S.E.2d at 97.\r\nRelying on Dr. Gee's February 1995 notes and Dr. Edwards' June 1995\r\nletter, the Court of Appeals found respondent carried her burden of\r\npresenting expert medical testimony as to causation and affirmed the \r\n  \r\n\r\ninfection was present in the disc space on December 18, 1994, the\r\nsubsequent disability is compensable. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 While the claimant in Smith did file a petition for writ of certiorari\r\nwith the Court, the claimant did not challenge the Court of Appeals'\r\nstatement that expert testimony was required to establish causation. The\r\nonly question raised in the petition was whether the Court of Appeals\r\nerred in holding no expert testimony causally related petitioner's worsened\r\npsychological condition to her neck injury. This Court denied the petition\r\nfor a writ of certiorari on July 24, 1996. \r\n  \r\np. 26\r\n\r\nTILLER v. NATIONAL HEALTH CARE CENTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircuit court's order. Tiller, supra. Further, the Court of Appeals\r\nconcluded the doctors' testimony, combined with other evidence, provided\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the award. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe rule stated in Smith has some merit. In fact, this Court\r\nsuggested a similar rule in dicta. See Lorick v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 245\r\nS.C. 513, 141 S.E.2d 662 (1965) (stating medical causation should be\r\nestablished with expert testimony in all but simple cases); Dennis v.\r\nWilliams Furniture Corp., 243 S.C. 53, 132 S.E.2d 1 (1963). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHowever, our case law does not support application of this rule\r\nin workers' compensation cases. See Lorick, supra (the Court found\r\nneither the expert testimony nor the lay testimony provided evidentiary\r\nsupport of a causal connection); Dennis, supra (viewing the evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to claimant, there was no competent evidence to\r\nsupport an award). Instead, the Commission is given discretion to weigh\r\nand consider all the evidence, both lay and expert, when deciding whether\r\ncausation has been established. See Ballenger v. Southern Worsted Corp.,\r\n209 S.C. 463, 40 S.E.2d 681 (1946) (despite doctor's testimony that there\r\nwas not a connection with the accident that caused almost boiling dye to\r\nfly in claimant's face and eyes and his subsequent eye problems, lay\r\ntestimony of claimant's good vision before the accident was sufficient to\r\nsupport an award); Poston v. Southeastern Construction Co., 208 S.C. 35,\r\n36 S.E.2d 858 (1946) (lay testimony that claimant's eyes became runny\r\nand inflamed after some construction material blew into them and that\r\nclaimant lost vision in eyes subsequent to the accident was sufficient to\r\nsupport an award, even though doctor testified vision loss was not related\r\nto job injuries). Thus, while medical testimony is entitled to great respect,\r\nthe fact finder may disregard it if there is other competent evidence in the\r\nrecord. Ballenger, supra. Indeed, \"medical testimony should not be held\r\nconclusive irrespective of other evidence. Ballenger, 209 at 467, 40 S~ E.2d\r\nat 682-83. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nExpert medical testimony is designed to aid the Commission in\r\ncoming to the correct conclusion; therefore, the Commission determine the\r\nweight and credit to be given to the expert testimony. Poston, supra; \r\nHines v. Pacific Mills, 214 S.C. 125, 51 S.E.2d 383 (1949). Once admitted,\r\nexpert testimony is to be considered just like any other testimony. Smith\r\nv. Southern Builders, 202 S.C. 88, 24 S.E.2d 109 (1943). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\np.27\r\n\r\nTILLER v. NATIONAL HEALTH CARE CENTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a medical expert is unwilling to state with certainty a\r\nconnection between an accident and an injury, the \"expression of a\r\ncautious opinion\" may support an award if there are facts outside the\r\nmedical testimony that also support an award. Grice v. Dickerson,\r\n241 S.C. 225, 127 S.E.2d 722 (1962) (where medical testimony definite\r\nrecognized the possibility of a causal connection between the accident and\r\nthe rheumatoid arthritis but no medical testimony stated a connection!' to a\r\nreasonable degree of medical certainty, the Commission had to weigh the\r\nfacts in light of the medical possibilities and draw inferences consistent\r\nwith the medical testimony in the record); Brewer v. Charleston\r\nShipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co., 212 S.C. 43, 46 S.E.2d 173 (1948) (doctor's\r\ntestimony indicating a connection between claimant's accident and his\r\nsubsequent fungal infection, though not stated to a reasonable degree of\r\nmedical certainty, was sufficient to support an award when combined with\r\nlay testimony about claimant's health before and after the accident,\r\ndespite the testimony of another doctor that stated there was no\r\nconnection). Thus, if medical expert testimony is not solely relied upon to\r\nestablish causation, the fact finder must look to the facts and\r\ncircumstances of the case. Grice, supra. Proof that a claimant sustained\r\nan injury-may be established by circumstantial and direct evidence where\r\ncircumstances lead an unprejudiced mind to reasonably infer the injury\r\nwas caused by the accident. Grice, supra; Hewitt v. Cheraw Cotton Mills,\r\n217 S.C. 90, 59 S.E.2d 712 (1950). However, such evidence need not reach\r\nsuch a degree of certainty as to exclude every reasonable or possible\r\nconclusion other than that reached by the Commission. Grice, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUnlike the Court of Appeals, we decline to apply the standard\r\nset out in Smith. Instead, in deciding whether substantial evidence\r\nsupports a finding of causation, we consider both the lay and expert\r\nevidence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDr. Edwards testified b deposition that although he could\r\nstate with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that respondent had\r\ndiscitis at L3-LA by February 10, 1995, he could not state with a\r\nreasonable degree of medical certainty that respondent had discitis at L3-\r\nLA on December 18, 1994, the date of the accident. Dr. Edwards noted\r\nthe majority of E. coli infections in the body stem from urinary tract\r\ninfections. When tests revealed respondent had a UTI in February 1905,\r\nDr. Edwards presumed the UTI was the cause of the discitis. However,\r\nDr. Edwards agreed it was possible the E. coli could have gone from the \r\n  \r\np.28\r\n\r\nTILLER v. NATIONAL HEALTH CARE CENTER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfork stab wound to the disc and then to the urinary tract.4 Dr. Edwards\r\nstated it was his opinion that most probably \"something else\" was going on\r\nin respondent's spine at the time of the accident. Noting respondent had\r\nno history of UTIs until February 1995, he said that given the chronology\r\nof events, it made sense that there was some relationship between the\r\nstab wound and discitis. However,, Dr. Edwards was unable to \"state with\r\na reasonable degree of medical certainty about that [relationship].\" Dr.\r\nEdwards testified \"I think basically by the time the diagnosis was made in\r\nFebruary, I think that [the discitis] had been there for some indeterminate\r\nperiod of time and [there is] no way to know how I long it had been there,\r\nor really, no way to know what exactly caused it.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn a letter addressed to respondent's attorney, Dr. Edwards\r\nstated if discitis was present at UJA on December 18, 1994, then in his\r\nopinion, based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the accident\r\naggravated the condition in her back. In addition, assuming there was no\r\nevidence of a UTI, Dr. Edwards stated to a reasonable degree of medical\r\ncertainty the stab wound caused the discitis. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn February 1995, Dr. Gee stated \"hematogenous spread from\r\nstab wound caused the disc space infection. Studies may confirm or\r\ncontradict.\" In a letter dated May 30, 1995, contradicting his earlier\r\nconclusion, Dr. Gee stated he believed it was more likely the UTI rather\r\nthan the fork-stabbing incident was the cause of the discitis.

We reverse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant lived in Mullins, South Carolina with his wife and\r\nthree children. Appellant's father-in-law, Billy Turbeville, moved in with \r\n  \r\np.31\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappellant's family after Mr. Turbeville and his wife divorced in 1989. Mr.\r\nTurbeville had suffered a stroke in 1987 and could no longer live alone.\r\nMr. Turbeville lived in an apartment which had been added to the King's\r\nhome, and he paid the second mortgage the Kings had obtained to build\r\nthe apartment. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt approximately 5:20 a.m. on the morning of March 1 1995,\r\nappellant woke his wife when he discovered Mr. Turbeville's apartment\r\nwas on fire. Because the apartment's door was locked, appellant broke a\r\nwindow in the door and reached through to open the door. Appellant and\r\nhis wife ran into the apartment several times searching for Mr. Turbeville.\r\nThe apartment was filled with smoke and they were unable to locate him.\r\nOfficer Jimmy Collins testified, when he arrived, appellant was up let and\r\nsaid his father-in-law might be inside, but the smoke was too thick. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOnce the fire department extinguished the fire and the smoke\r\nwas blown from the apartment, the body of Mr. Turbeville was found on\r\nthe floor beside his bed. Mr. Turbeville had been burned and beaton on\r\nthe head with a blunt object such as a hammer.1 He had nine lacerations\r\nto the scalp. A pool of blood was discovered just inside the apartment\r\ndoor, more than nine feet from the body. Another pool of blood was\r\ndiscovered under Mr. Turbeville's head. The authorities seized the\r\ntrousers appellant was wearing when he entered Mr. Turbeville's\r\napartment. Examination of the trousers revealed spatters of blood on the\r\nleg and crotch. DNA analysis revealed the blood to be Mr. Turbeville's. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGasoline-soaked newspapers and paper towels were found in\r\nthe apartment. A gasoline-soaked newspaper was found in the recycling\r\nbin inside the Florida room of the King home. The Florida room is located\r\nat the back of the house facing Mr. Turbeville's apartment. Authorities,\r\nseized a gas can found in the garage and another found in the back of\r\nappellant's truck. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant's ex-wife, Gina Turbeville-King,2 testified her father\r\nusually went to the Huddle House restaurant at approximately 3:30 a.m.\r\nA witness testified Mr. Turbeville was at the Huddle House on the \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 The weapon was never found. \r\n\r\n2 Mrs. King divorced appellant in 1996. \r\n  \r\np.32\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmorning of March 10, 1995, and left the restaurant at approximately 4:45\r\na.m. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMr. Turbeville received two checks each month totaling\r\n$2200.00. After paying his bills totaling $400.00, Mr. Turbeville kept the\r\nremaining cash in his wallet. A witness from the Huddle House testified\r\nMr. Turbeville carried money in his front pants' pocket. No wallet or cash\r\nwas found on Mr. Turbeville's body. Mrs. King testified her father's VCR\r\nwas missing after the fire. Authorities never found the missing VCR or\r\nmoney. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMrs. King testified, on the evening before the murder, he\r\nreturned to her home at approximately 9:00 p.m. As she arrived home,\r\nshe was surprised to see appellant pulling into the driveway because he\r\nwas suppose to be home with the children. Later that evening, Mrs. King\r\ndiscovered approximately $70.00 was missing from her purse.  When she\r\nconfronted appellant, he first denied and then admitted taking the money.\r\nAppellant left the house around 1:00 a.m. telling his ex-wife he was going\r\nto get some money to repay her. Appellant returned home at\r\napproximately 2:00 a.m. and got into bed with his ex-wife. He again got\r\nout of bed a short while later and returned to bed around 3:00 a.m. Mrs.\r\nKing next remembered appellant yelling to her about the fire.  Mrs. King\r\ntestified appellant had told her she was to agree that she heard someone\r\ncome into their yard that night and argue with her father.3 According to\r\nMrs. King, appellant had threatened to take the children if she did not\r\nagree with his story. Mrs. King testified she had not heard anything. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFrank Robinson, an acquaintance of appellant, testified\r\nappellant had come to his home at \"around 11:00 p.m. or 12:00 a.m.\" the\r\nnight of the murder to ask Robinson if someone had paid in advance for\r\nwork appellant was to do for this person. Robinson told appellant he had\r\nnot yet received the advanced payment. A few hours later, around 3:00\r\na.m., appellant returned to Robinson's home asking to borrow $7.00 for\r\ngasoline. Robinson told him to return later in the morning. When\r\nappellant came back between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m., he told Robinson his\r\nfather-in-law \"got burned last night.\" \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 Her father's stroke severely affected his ability to speak. \r\n\r\np.33\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Did the trial judge err in refusing to grant a new trial after\r\na television news reporter entered the courtroom midway\r\nthrough the jury charge and filmed the judge, parties, and\r\njury? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII Did the trial judge err in allowing appellant's ex-wife to\r\ntestify regarding appellant's need for money prior to the\r\nmurder because this testimony served no purpose other than to\r\nimpugn appellant's character and its prejudicial effect\r\noutweighed any probative value? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. \r\n  \r\nImmediately before beginning closing arguments, the trial\r\njudge ordered the bailiff not to allow anyone \"to leave or reenter [the\r\ncourtroom] once the arguments begin or [during] the charge of the law.\"\r\nIn the middle of the judge's charge to the jury, a television news reporter\r\nentered the courtroom. With the use of a video camera, the reporter\r\nfilmed the proceedings until the end of the jury charge. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant did not object to this situation prior to the jury's\r\nverdict. Instead, appellant raised this issue three days later in his post\r\ntrial motion for a new trial. During the post trial motions' hearing,\r\ndefense counsel admitted he discussed the situation with appellant and\r\nappellant's father prior to the verdict and \"a conscious decision [was] made\r\nnot to make a motion for a mistrial.\" Only after the jury returned with\r\nan unfavorable verdict did defense counsel attempt to raise this issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn denying the new trial motion, the trial judge found\r\nappellant had waived this claim because his objection was not timely.\r\nFurther, the trial judge found the reporter's activities were in accordance\r\nwith Rule 605, SCACR, and did not distract or disrupt the proceedings. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe conclude appellant waived review of this issue by failing to\r\nobject prior to the jury's verdict. Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE; State v. Hicks,\r\n330 S.C. 207) 499 S.E.2d 209 (1998) (to preserve an issue for appellate\r\nreview, the objection must be timely made, which usually requires it be \r\n  \r\np.34\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade at the earliest possible opportunity); see also State v. Kelly, 331 S.C.\r\n132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998) (a new trial motion may not be used to raise an\r\nevidentiary issue for the first time); McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Syst., 321 S.C.\r\n340, 468 S.E.2d 633 (1996) (an issue may not be raised for the first time\r\nin a motion for a new trial); State v. Penlan , 275 S.C. 537, 538, 273\r\nS.E.2d 765, 767 (1981) (finding appellant waived the issue where he did\r\nnot make a motion for a mistrial until after the verdict). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefense counsel, after consultation with appellant, made a\r\nstrategic trial decision not to object. Appellant and defense counsel\r\nweighed their options and, rather than moving for a mistrial, decided to\r\ntake the chance appellant would be acquitted. Under these facts,\r\nappellant has no basis on which to assert error. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant's ex-wife, Gina Turbeville-King, testified for the\r\nState. She testified she and appellant first separated in October 1994.\r\nThey reconciled in January 1995 and separated again shortly after the\r\nmurder. The State, in an attempt to elicit testimony of appellant's recent\r\ndrug use, asked Mrs. King if \"[a]ny changes in [appellant had taken] place\r\nthen that lead [sic] to that separation?\" Defense counsel objected on the\r\nbasis of relevance. After an in camera hearing, the trial judge sustained\r\nthe objection and ruled the State could not introduce evidence of\r\nappellant's drug addiction. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State then requested permission to elicit testimony to\r\nshow appellant had a pattern of taking money from his ex-wife and\r\nstaying out late to prove motive and/or to establish the context of the\r\ncrimes under the res gestae theory. The prosecution indicated it would\r\nnot discuss appellant's drug use. Defense counsel objected claiming these\r\nwere inadmissible prior bad acts. The court overruled the objection\r\nexplaining the evidence was relevant to establish appellant's need for\r\nmoney and the prejudicial effect of this evidence did not outweigh its\r\nprobative value.4 \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 The trial judge assured defense counsel that his objection would run\r\nthroughout Mrs. King's testimony and it would be unnecessary to continue\r\nto object. \r\n  \r\np.35\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the jury, the State asked Mrs. King whether an\r\nchanges in appellant's conduct led to the separation. Mrs. King responded\r\nappellant had been staying out late and he would leave several times\r\nduring the night. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State then asked Mrs. King about appellant's need for\r\nmoney. She testified appellant had admitted taking items from their\r\nhome, pawning them, then redeeming them and returning them to the\r\nhome. Mrs. King also testified appellant stole cash from her purse, forged\r\nchecks on her bank account, stole cash from her bank account by using\r\nher ATM card, and stopped paying his share of the bills. These incidents\r\noccurred prior to their separation in October 1994 and began to occur\r\nagain after they reconciled in January 1995. Mrs. King testified their\r\nfinancial situation had not changed during this time. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMrs. King then testified appellant stole $70 from her purse on\r\nthe evening before the murder. According to Mrs. King, when she\r\nconfronted appellant he first denied, then admitted, taking the money.\r\nMrs. King testified appellant promised to repay her. After this\r\nconfrontation, appellant left the house at approximately 1:00 a.m. He\r\nreturned around 2:00 a.m. Later, he got up from bed and returned around\r\n3:00 a.m. Mrs. King testified she was not aware of appellant leaving the\r\nbed again until he woke her yelling there was a fire. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in admitting Mr . King's\r\ntestimony regarding his prior bad acts of stealing because this testimony\r\nonly served to establish his criminal propensity to commit the charged\r\ncrimes and he is a bad person. The State argues this testimony as\r\nadmissible to establish motive and/or to provide the context of the':crimes. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn a criminal case, the State cannot attack the character of the\r\ndefendant unless the defendant himself first places his character in issue.\r\nRule 404(a), SCRE; Mitchell v. State, 298 S.C. 186, 379 S.E.2d 12 (1989).\r\nFurther, evidence of prior bad acts is inadmissible to show criminal\r\npropensity or to demonstrate the accused is a bad person. Mitchell v.\r\nState, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina law precludes evidence of a defendant' prior\r\ncrimes or other bad acts to prove the defendant's guilt for the crime\r\ncharged except to establish (1) motive, (2) intent, (3) the absence of\r\nmistake or accident, (4) a common scheme or plan, or (5) the identity of \r\n  \r\np.36\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe perpetrator. Rule 404(b), SCRE; State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114,;! 470\r\nS.E.2d 366 (1996); State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923). The\r\nevidence of the prior bad acts must be clear and convincing to be\r\nadmissible. State v. Adams, supra. The record must support a logical\r\nrelevance between the prior bad act and the crime for which the defendant\r\nis accused. State v. Adams, supra; State v. Smith, 309 S.C. 442, 424\r\nS.E.2d 496 (1992); State v. Gilchrist, 329 S.C. 621, 496 S.E.2d 424 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1998). Further, even though the evidence is clear and convincing\r\nand falls within a Lyle exception, it must be excluded if its probative\r\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the\r\ndefendant. Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Adams, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe res gestae theory recognizes evidence of other bad acts\r\nmay be an integral part of the crime with which the defendant is charged,\r\nor may be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in\r\nwhich the crime occurred. State v. Adams, supra. This evidence f other\r\ncrimes is admissible: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nwhen such evidence \"furnishes part of the context of the\r\ncrime\" or is necessary to a \"full presentation\" of the case,\r\nor is so intimately connected with and explanatory of the\r\ncrime charged against the defendant and is so much a\r\npart of the setting of the case and its \"environment\" that\r\nits proof is appropriate in order \"to complete the story of\r\nthe crime on trial by proving its immediate context or\r\nthe 'res gestae\"' or the \"uncharged offense is 'so linked\r\ntogether in point of time and circumstances with the\r\ncrime charged that one cannot be fully shown without\r\nproving the other . [and is thus] part of the res gestae\r\nof the crime charged.\" And where evidence is admissible\r\nto provide this \"full presentation\" of the offense, \"[t]here\r\nis no reason to fragmentize the event under inquiry\" by\r\nsuppressing parts of the \"res gestae.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nState v. Adams, 322 S.C. at 122, 470 S.E.2d at 370-71 (quoting United\r\nStates v. Masters, 622 F.2d 83~ 86 (4th Cir. 1980) (citations omitted)). The\r\nevidence of prior bad acts is inadmissible as part of the res gestae, \"where\r\nthe record does not support any relationship between the crime and [prior\r\nbad acts].\" State v. Hough, 325 S.C. S8, 480 S.E.2d 77 (1997). Under this\r\ntheory, it is important that the temporal proximity of the prior bad act be\r\nclosely related to the charged crime. State v. Hough, supra. Even if the \r\n  \r\np.37\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevidence is relevant under this theory, prior to admission the trial judge\r\nshould determine whether its probative value clearly outweighs any unfair\r\nprejudice. Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Bolden, 303 S.C. 41, 398 S.E.2d 494 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFor purposes of this discussion we have divided the evidence\r\npresented by the State into two categories: (1) the evidence of his\r\nnumerous prior thefts from his ex-wife beginning in 1994 (remote thefts)\r\nand (2) the evidence of the theft on the night before the murder\r\n(immediate theft). The remote thefts were not admissible under any\r\ntheory. This evidence shows appellant's bad character and his propensity\r\nto commit crimes. These are inadmissible purposes. The temporal\r\nconnection between t&amp;se petty thefts and the charged crimes is too\r\nattenuated for admissibility under the res gestae theory or under Lyle.5\r\nThus, the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the remote thefts. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn our opinion, the admission of this evidence is not harmless\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.6 State v. Bolden, supra. Whether the\r\nimproper introduction of this evidence is harmless requires the Court to\r\ndetermine whether appellant's \"guilt is conclusively proven by competent\r\nevidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached.\" State\r\nv. Parker, 315 S.C. at 234, 433 S.E.2d at 833; see also State v. Reeves,\r\n301 S.C. 191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990) (finding an error is harmless\r\nif it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial),; State v.\r\nDavis, 309 S.C. 326, 422 S.E.2d 133 (1992) (even if evidence, was wrongly \r\n  \r\n\r\n5 While the remote thefts may have been minimally relevant to show\r\nmotive under Lyle, the prejudicial effect of this evidence far outweighed\r\nthis slight probative value. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n6 The State suggests any error in the admission of this evidence is\r\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt because Mrs. King's testimony was\r\ncumulative to Robinson's testimony about appellant's need for money. We\r\ndisagree. Robinson's testimony only established appellant had asked to\r\nborrow money from Robinson in the past and on the night of the murder.\r\nThere was no suggestion that appellant had attempted to steal money.\r\nMrs. King's testimony established appellant stole money from her and\r\npawned household items for money. Her testimony was much more\r\ndamaging to appellant. Thus, her testimony was not cumulative to\r\nRobinson's testimony. \r\n  \r\np.38\r\n\r\nSTATE v. KING \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadmitted, its admission may constitute harmless error if the evidence did\r\nnot affect the outcome of the trial). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHere, all the evidence was circumstantial. While this\r\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to appellant's guilt, especially the blood\r\nevidence, the evidence was not overwhelming. The admission of the\r\nremote thefts was too prejudicial to be held harmless. The admission of\r\nthis testimony allowed the State to insinuate to the jury that appellant\r\nhad a drug problem. The Solicitor's questions eliminated many legitimate\r\nreasons why appellant would need money. In the State's closing\r\nargument, the Solicitor's use of words such as \"craving\" and \"insatiable\"\r\nimplied to the jury that appellant's reason for needing money was bad and\r\nwas probably related to an illegal activity -- drug use. Appellant's drug\r\nuse was properly found inadmissible by the trial judge because of its\r\nprejudicial effect. However, by way of the back door, the State was able to\r\nintroduce appellant's drug problem to the jury. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis improper evidence suggested to the jury that appellant\r\nwas guilty of committing the charged crimes because of his criminal\r\npropensity to commit crimes and his bad character. The State\r\ncontinuously stressed this improper testimony in its closing argument.\r\nTherefore, it is impossible under these circumstances to conclude the\r\nimproper evidence did not impact the jury's verdict. This improper\r\ntestimony permeated the trial and the jury likely used this evidence to\r\ninfer that since appellant had previously stolen from his ex-wife, he\r\nprobably committed these crimes against his father-in-law also.

Condon and Senior\r\nAssistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., both\r\nof Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nKeith Andrew Rice of Aiken, pro se. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney grievance matter, Keith Andrew\r\nRice (Respondent) is charged with engaging in misconduct in violation of\r\nvarious provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) contained ill Rule\r\n407, SCACR, and the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (F LDE)\r\ncontained in Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) began\r\ninvestigating this matter in March 1997. Respondent, an Aiken attorney, did\r\nnot reply to two letters the Commission sent him in April 1997; nor did he reply\r\nto the notice of full investigation sent to him in January 1998. Respondent did\r\nnot respond to the notice of formal charges, which was personally served upon\r\nhim in April 1998 by an agent of the State Law Enforcement Division (SLED),\r\nand went into default. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent did not appear at the subpanel hearing on July 30, \r\n  \r\np.41\r\n\r\nMATTER OF RICE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1998. The subpanel, concerned about Respondent's failure to respond to the\r\nCommission's inquiries, delayed consideration of the matter and directed the\r\nCommission to serve a subpoena to appear upon Respondent. A SLED agent\r\npersonally served the subpoena to appear upon Respondent. He did not appear\r\nat the rescheduled hearing on August 13, 1998. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Court sent Respondent a notice of the hearing in this matter\r\nby certified mail to his last known address, but the return receipt was signed\r\nby a person other than Respondent. Respondent did not appear at the hearing\r\nbefore this Court. Respondent is on inactive status with the Bar. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTHE BUSH MATTER \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent was appointed as conservator for Deborah Bush\r\n(Mother) in June 1995. Respondent filed an inventory and appraisement in\r\nAugust 1995. The probate court wrote Respondent in July and August 1996,\r\nasking him to file the annual accounting. Respondent filed an accounting on\r\nSeptember 17, 1996, showing about $24,000 received in Mother's accounts,\r\n$20,000 disbursed, and a fee of $1,074 paid to Respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDuring the following months, Ms. Bush's daughter, Natashia Bush\r\n(Daughter), was unable to contact Respondent in person or by telephone. In a\r\nletter to disciplinary counsel, Daughter stated she had been granted physical\r\nguardianship of Mother. She stated that Respondent \"apparently stopped his\r\nlaw practice without giving me any type of notification or any way to keep in\r\ncontact with him.\" She accused Respondent of giving Mother a blank check in\r\nDecember 1997 without her approval. She stated Mother's bills had not been\r\npaid and she had \"no idea\" what transactions had occurred in Mother's\r\naccounts. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe probate court issued an order in April 1997 appointing\r\nDaughter as temporary successor conservator. Respondent did not make a final\r\naccounting, but did deliver Mother's bank records to Daughter when she was\r\nappointed as conservator. The Commission's investigation uncovered no\r\nevidence Respondent had embezzled any funds or mishandled Mother's\r\naccounts, other than allowing her to write two checks to herself \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Commission received unconfirmed reports that Respondent has\r\nmedical problems. Other than that report, the record sheds no light on why \r\n  \r\np.41\r\n\r\nMATTER OF RICE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to respond to the Commission's inquiries or whether he ever\r\nintends to practice law again. The subpanel recommended Respondent receive\r\na definite suspension of nine months, and the full panel adopted that\r\nrecommendation in October 1998. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing\r\nevidence. Matter of Yarborough, 327 S.C. 161, 488 S.E.2d 871 (1997). While\r\nthe. Court is not bound by the findings of the subpanel and full panel, their\r\nfindings are entitled to- great weight, particularly when the inferences to be\r\ndrawn from the testimony depend on the credibility of witnesses. Id. The Court\r\nmay make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and is not bound by\r\nthe panel's recommendation. Burns v. Clayton, 237 S.C. 316, 117 S.E.2d 300\r\n(1960). The Court must administer the sanction it deems appropriate after a\r\nthorough review of the record. Matter of Kirven, 267 S.C. 669, 230 S.E.2d 899\r\n(1976). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter examining the facts, we find Respondent's misconduct has\r\nbeen proven by clear and convincing evidence. Respondent's failure to answer\r\nthe formal charges or appear before the hearing panel constitutes an admission\r\nof the factual allegations. Rule 24, RLDE. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the Bush matter, Respondent committed misconduct by failing\r\nto act with reasonable diligence and promptness in filing the annual accounting\r\nwhen due, and in failing to file the final accounting. Rule 1.3, RPC.\r\nRespondent also committed misconduct by failing to respond to the\r\nCommission's inquiries and requests for information. See Matter of Thompson,\r\n310 S.C. 461) 427 S.E.2d 644 (1993) (members of the Bar are required to\r\ncooperate fully with disciplinary authorities); Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514,\r\n290 S.E.2d 240 (1982) (failure to comply with investigation is itself a\r\ndisciplinable offense); Rule 7(a)(3), RLDE. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe appropriate sanction for neglect of several client matters\r\ngenerally is a public reprimand, provided the clients are not greatly prejudiced.\r\nMatter of Moore, 329 S.C. 294,494 S.E.2d 804 (1997); Matter of Alexander, 301\r\nS.C. 212, 391 S.E.2d 254 (1990); accord Matter of Celsor, 330 S.C 497, 499\r\nS.E.2d 809 (1998) (attorney's misconduct in violating various attorney\r\ndisciplinary rules while handling probate matter and related wrongful death \r\n  \r\np.42\r\n\r\nMATTER OF RICE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naction warranted public reprimand where attorney falsely notarized signatures\r\nof client and compounded dishonesty by submitting documents to court); Matter\r\nof Tullis, 330 S.C. 502, 499 S.E.2d 811 (1998) (attorney's misconduct in failing\r\nto competently represent client, failing to timely provide information at out case\r\nto client or to client's employers, who had paid attorney to represent client,\r\nfailing to promptly deliver funds paid on client's behalf to state of Florida to\r\nresolve matter of client's probation violation, and failing to reply promptly to\r\ninquiries by the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, warranted public reprimand);\r\nMatter of Golden, 329 S.C. 335, 496 S.E.2d 619 (1998) (making gratuitously\r\ninsulting, threatening, and demeaning comments during two depositions\r\nwarranted public reprimand); Matter of Johnson, 329 S.C. 363, 495 S.',-' .2d 777\r\n(1998) (public reprimand of attorney was warranted by his misconduct in failing\r\nto fulfill contractual obligation to materially assist former client's new counsel\r\nin pursuing criminal appeal, in misleading disciplinary authorities to believe\r\nthat he had spent thirty hours on such criminal appeal, in accepting divorce\r\ncase he was not capable of handling, in not providing proper attention to divorce\r\nmatter, in terminating his representation of client without her knowledge or\r\nconsent and in failing to obey two child support orders); Matter of White, 328\r\nS.C. 88,492 S.E.2d 82 (1997) (public reprimand was warranted against attorney\r\nfor improperly retaining file after termination based on assertion of retaining\r\nlien without notifying client of amount owed, ex parte communication with\r\ncourt in another matter, and commingling of personal funds with client trust\r\nfunds by paying personal expenses from escrow account). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent's failure to appear in the investigation and at the\r\nhearing before this Court, however, leads us to accept the panel's\r\nrecommendation of a definite suspension of nine months. As we recently noted, \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n[a]n attorney usually does not abandon a license to\r\npractice law without a fight. Those who do must\r\nunderstand that neglecting to participate [in a\r\ndisciplinary proceeding] is entitled to substantial\r\nweight in determining the sanction. An attorney's\r\nfailure to answer charges or appear to defend or\r\nexplain alleged misconduct indicates an obvious\r\ndisinterest in the practice of law. Such an attorney is\r\nlikely to face the most severe sanctions because a\r\ncentral purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect\r\nthe public from unscrupulous or indifferent lawyers. \r\n  \r\np.43\r\n\r\nMATTER OF RICE \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatter of Hall, Op.

Griffin (\"Victim\").\r\nDefendant appeals his conviction. \r\n  \r\np.1\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn March 1, 1995, Victim's cousin, John Griffin, discovered Victim\r\nstabbed to death in Victim's house in Newberry, South Carolina. John Griffin\r\ntestified that he found Victim lying nude on the floor in the bedroom. Victim's\r\nthroat had been cut and his face slashed. Victim had been cut, stabbed, and\r\nslashed over 70 times. Griffin immediately called the police. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nShortly after arriving at the scene, Newberry police developed Defendant\r\nas a suspect in the murder. Police visited Defendant at his mother's house and\r\nthen escorted him to the police station. Officer Max Pickelsimer testified that\r\nDefendant's right hand was heavily bandaged. Defendant eventually removed\r\nthe bandage, and police photographed cuts on his hand. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter being advised of his Miranda rights, Officer Pickelsimer asked\r\nDefendant if he wanted to make a statement. Defendant stated that he did. In\r\na signed, written statement, Defendant denied any involvement in Victim's\r\ndeath. Defendant stated that on the night in question he was at his girlfriend's\r\nhouse until about 10:00 p.m. He then went to the store and stopped at his\r\naunt's house to get out of the rain. He went back to his girlfriend's house at\r\nabout 1:30 a.m. Afterwards, he returned home and went to bed. Defendant\r\nclaimed he cut his hand while picking up a knife at his girlfriend's house. He\r\nagain cut his hand on a knife the next morning while reaching for a cigarette\r\nlighter by the side of his bed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter giving this initial statement, Defendant's mother told police that\r\nDefendant wanted to give another statement. Officer Charles Counts testified\r\nhe tape-recorded Defendant's second statement. Defendant stated that after he\r\nleft his girlfriend's house, he went to Victim's house to get a beer. Defendant\r\nclaimed that while standing on Victim's porch, Victim came out and held a\r\nsharp object to Defendant's throat, forcing Defendant inside the house. Once\r\ninside, the two began to fight, resulting in Victim being cut. Defendant claimed\r\nVictim was still alive when he left the house. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn March 3, 1995, police interviewed Defendant for a third time. This\r\ninterview was arranged to allow Newberry's Chief of Police, Louis J. Swindler,\r\nto question Defendant because Chief Swindler had been out of town during the\r\ninitial part of the investigation. During the interview, Defendant gave another\r\nversion of events. Defendant stated he went to Victim's house to get out of the\r\nrain and while standing on Victim's porch, Victim came out and held a knife to \r\n  \r\np.2\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefendant's throat, forcing Defendant inside the house. Defendant claimed that\r\nonce inside the house, Victim forced Defendant to have sex with him. After the\r\nsexual act was over, the two began to fight, and Defendant grabbed the knife,\r\ncutting himself on the hand in the process. Defendant then stabbed Victim two\r\nor three times. Upon leaving the house, Defendant grabbed Victim's \"Louis\r\nRich\" I.D. card and some personal papers and then returned to his girlfriend's\r\nhouse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn December 7, 1995, a jury convicted Defendant of murder, possessing\r\na knife during the commission of a violent crime, and larceny. Defendant was\r\nsentenced to life imprisonment for the murder charge, five years consecutive for\r\nthe weapons charge, and thirty days concurrent for larceny. Defendant appeals,\r\nraising the following issues: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(1) Did the trial court err in failing to grant Defendant a new trial\r\nbased on prejudicial comments by the trial judge throughout the\r\ntrial? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(2) Did the trial court err in excluding exculpatory evidence pursuant\r\nto State v. Doctor1? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(3) Did the trial court err in failing to grant a mistrial based on outside\r\ninfluence on a juror? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(4) Did the trial court err in failing to grant a directed verdict on the\r\ncharge of murder? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(5) Were the solicitor's closing arguments sufficiently prejudicial to\r\nwarrant a new trial? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA. COMMENTS BY TRIAL COURT \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendant argues that his conviction should be reversed because the trial\r\njudge made prejudicial comments toward defense counsel which influenced the\r\nverdict reached by the jury. Defendant further contends that prejudicial\r\ncomments made to defense counsel outside the presence of the jury had the \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 306 S.C. 527, 413 S.E.2d 36 (1992). \r\n\r\np.3\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffect of prohibiting defense counsel from presenting an adequate defense. We\r\ndisagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendant cites to approximately twenty instances in the record where\r\nhe contends the trial judge made prejudicial comments toward defense counsel.\r\nDefendant does not contend that any of the rulings constituted legal error by\r\nthe trial judge. Rather, he argues the cumulative effect of the comments\r\nprejudiced the verdict because they tended to impugn the credibility of defense\r\ncounsel by insinuating lack of legal skill. We have examined each of the\r\ninstances about which appellant complains. Each involves a situation in which\r\nthe trial judge and defense counsel are interacting with regard to evidentiary\r\nor testimonial rulings. On each complained of instance, the trial judge has\r\neither ruled against counsel, asked counsel to avoid repetitive questions, asked\r\ncounsel for clarification, or declined a request by defense counsel. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt is well settled that a trial judge must act with absolute impartiality in\r\nthe performance of judicial duties. State v. Pace, 316 S.C. 71, 447 S.E.2d 186\r\n(1994); Canon 3 of Rule 501, SCACR. In Pace, this Court granted a new trial\r\nwhere the trial court commented on defense counsel's age and gender. The\r\nCourt found that the remarks of the trial court tended to impugn the credibility\r\nof trial counsel and to diminish her in the eyes of the jury. Further, in State v.\r\nSimmons, 267 S.C. 479, 229 S.E.2d 597 (1976), this Court found reversible error\r\nwhere the trial judge threatened defense counsel with a jail sentence,\r\nimmediately after which counsel proceeded no further with the arguments. The\r\nCourt concluded that the remarks tended to impugn the credibility of defense\r\ncounsel. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn other instances, this Court has found the trial court's comments to\r\ndefense counsel to be harmless. See, e.g., State v. DeBerry, 250 S.C. 314, 157\r\nS.E.2d 637 (1967)(holding that trial judge's admonition to defense counsel to be\r\nbrief and stop wasting court's time was not abuse of discretion nor prejudicial\r\nto the rights of defendant). Moreover, there is generally no prejudice when the\r\ntrial court's hostile comments are made outside the jury's presence. See Graves\r\nv. State, 309 S.C. 307, 422 S.E.2d 125 (1992). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, the trial judge's comments and rulings were routine.\r\nNone of the exchanges involved any improper, personal comment about defense\r\ncounsel, nor did the comments tend to impugn counsel's credibility or diminish\r\nhim in the eyes of the jury. Many of the comments were innocuous or merely\r\nexplanatory of the trial court's ruling and were therefore permissible. See State \r\n  \r\np.4 \r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nv. Mishoe, 198 S.C. 215,17 S.E.2d 142(1941)(holding that remarks made by the\r\njudge in the course of a trial need not be confined in such narrow limits as to\r\nprevent him from stating his reasons for his rulings). Some of the comments\r\nwere made outside the presence of the jury, and therefore, could not affect the\r\nverdict. See Graves, supra. Further, the contention that these comments\r\nnonetheless inhibited defense counsel is not supported by the record. In sum,\r\nthese were instances in which the trial judge made routine rulings against\r\ndefense counsel over the course of a four-day murder trial. There was no\r\nresulting prejudice to Defendant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe therefore affirm the trial court on this issue. See State v. Bridges, 278\r\nS.C. 447, 298 S.E.2d 212 (1982)(holding that, in general, the conduct of a\r\ncriminal trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the presiding judge, and\r\nthe appellate court will not interfere unless it clearly appears that rights of the\r\ncomplaining party were abused or prejudiced in some way). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nB. EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendant argues that the trial court erred in characterizing evidence as\r\nexculpatory and excluding it pursuant to State v. Doctor, 306 S.C. 527, 413\r\nS.E.2d 36 (1992). At trial, Defendant proffered the testimony of Solomon\r\nNelson who testified that while in a restaurant, he overheard Shirley Gilmore\r\ntell Peter Wayne Marshall that Gilmore, Dottie Suber, and Defendant's\r\ngirlfriend had murdered Victim. Marshall admitted having a conversation with\r\nGilmore about the murder but denied that Gilmore told him she killed Victim.\r\nMarshall testified that Gilmore simply told him that Defendant was not alone\r\nin killing Victim. Finally, Gilmore proffered testimony, denying she told\r\nMarshall that she killed Victim. Gilmore claimed she only told Marshall that\r\nshe believed Defendant had not committed the crime. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter the testimony was proffered, defense counsel stated that he\r\nintended to first call Gilmore and then impeach her with Nelson's testimony.\r\nThe solicitor objected on the basis of hearsay. The trial court sustained the\r\nobjection pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, and State v. Doctor. The trial court\r\nfurther stated: \"You see why you can't do that? You can't call a witness to come\r\nup and to deny that she ever made that statement she was involved in a murder\r\nof somebody and then bring somebody else to say that -- it doesn't work that\r\nway.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Doctor, this Court held that out-of-court statements against penal \r\n  \r\np.5\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest made by an unavailable declarant are admissible at trial. However, if\r\noffered to exculpate the accused in a criminal trial, they are admissible only if\r\ncorroborating evidence clearly indicates the trustworthiness of the statements.\r\nRule 804(b)(3), SCRE, codified this exception to the hearsay rule. Rule 804(b)(3)\r\nprovides: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(b) Hearsay Exceptions. The following are not excluded by the\r\nhearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness: . . . (3)\r\nStatement Against Interest. A statement which was at the time of\r\nits making so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or\r\nproprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil\r\nor criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant\r\nagainst another, that a reasonable person in the declarant's\r\nposition would not have made the statement unless believing it to\r\nbe true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal\r\nliability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible\r\nunless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the\r\ntrustworthiness of the statement. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 804(b)(3), SCRE. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUnder Rule 804, Defendant could not have called Nelson to testify\r\nconcerning Gilmore's statements, since Gilmore was available to testify.\r\nHowever, it is clear from the trial transcript that the Defendant intended to\r\nfirst call Gilmore and then impeach her denial with Nelson's testimony. In\r\nother words, Defendant argues that if Gilmore testified consistent with her\r\nproffered testimony, Nelson's testimony would have been admissible as a prior\r\ninconsistent statement.2 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendant admits that the sole purpose for calling Gilmore was to\r\nimpeach her with Nelson's testimony, thereby supplying substantive evidence\r\nof her guilt in committing the crime. However, this Court has imposed strict \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 Rule 801(d)(1)(A), SCRE, provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) Statements Which Are Not Hearsay. A statement is not\r\nhearsay if - (1) Prior Statement by Witness. The declarant testifies\r\nat the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination\r\nconcerning the statement, and the statement is (A) inconsistent\r\nwith the declarant's testimony . . . . \r\n  \r\np.6\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlimits on the admissibility of third-party guilt. In State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98,\r\n16 S.E.2d 532 (1941), this Court held: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe evidence offered by accused as to the commission of the crime\r\nby another person must be limited to such facts as are inconsistent\r\nwith his own guilt, and to such facts as raise a reasonable inference\r\nor presumption as to his own innocence; evidence which can have\r\n(no) other effect than to cast a bare suspicion upon another, or to\r\nraise a conjectural inference as to the commission of the crime by\r\nanother, is not admissible. . . . But before such testimony can be\r\nreceived, there must be such proof of connection with it, such a train\r\nof facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such other\r\nperson as the guilty party. Remote acts, disconnected and outside\r\nthe crime itself, cannot be separately proved for such a purpose. An\r\norderly and unbiased judicial inquiry as to the guilt or innocence of\r\na defendant on trial does not contemplate that such defendant be\r\npermitted, by way of defense, to indulge in conjectural inferences\r\nthat some other person might have committed the offense for which\r\nhe is on trial, or by fanciful analogy to say to the jury that someone\r\nother than he is more probably guilty. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGregory, 98 S.C. at 104-05, 16 S.E.2d at 534-35 (citation omitted)(emphasis\r\nadded); accord State v. Parker, 294 S.C. 465, 366 S.E.2d 10 (1988); State v.\r\nCaulder, 287 S.C. 507, 339 S.E.2d 876 (Ct. App. 1986). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, Gilmore admitted having a conversation with\r\nMarshall concerning Defendant's case, but denied admitting to the crime. Aside\r\nfrom Nelson's assertions, there was no credible evidence linking Gilmore to\r\nVictim's murder. Gilmore testified in camera that she had never been to\r\nVictim's house. Thus, there was no evidence that tended clearly to point out\r\nthat Gilmore was guilty of the crime. Nelson's testimony would therefore be\r\nprohibited under Gregory, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nYet, even if testimony is inadmissible as substantive evidence of third\r\nparty guilt, it may still be admissible for impeachment purposes. See State v.\r\nFossick, - S.C. _, 508 S.E.2d 32 (1998). However, Gilmore was not relevant\r\nto the instant case except to provide testimony of her own culpability.3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 In State v. Fossick, a State's witness testified concerning the\r\ncircum stances surrounding the murder. On cross-examination, defense counsel \r\n  \r\np.7\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefendant, expecting Gilmore to deny making the statement if she testified,\r\nthen wanted to supply extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. In\r\nother words, Defendant wanted to call an otherwise irrelevant witness so that\r\ntestimony of that witness's guilt could come in under the guise of a prior\r\ninconsistent statement. Such use of a prior inconsistent statement serves only\r\nto prove third-party guilt, and therefore, cannot be justified on the ground of\r\nimpeachment alone. Since the testimony would be improper as substantive\r\nevidence of third-party guilt, the trial court properly excluded the evidence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nC. OUTSIDE INFLUENCE ON JUROR \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendant argues. that the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial\r\nbased on outside influence on a juror. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt trial, the solicitor informed the trial court that a juror had been seen\r\nwaving to Corey Edwards, a spectator in the audience. Edwards was also\r\noverheard stating that Defendant's girlfriend should be on trial. Further,\r\nEdwards was seen talking to the juror during a break in the trial. Defense\r\ncounsel moved for a mistrial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial judge called Edwards to the stand and questioned him about the\r\nincident outside the presence of the jury. Edwards stated that the juror was\r\nmarried to his cousin. He admitted having a conversation with the juror, but\r\ndenied talking to the juror about Defendant's case. He further stated that he\r\nhad told the assistant solicitor, not Defendant, that Defendant's girlfriend\r\nshould be on trial. The assistant solicitor confirmed Defendant's version on this\r\npoint. The trial court also permitted defense counsel to extensively question\r\nEdwards about the incident. Additionally, the trial judge asked the jurors to\r\nwrite him a note if anyone had attempted to discuss the case with them. There\r\nwas no response from the jury. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn a criminal prosecution, the conduct of the jurors should be free from all \r\n  \r\n\r\nasked the witness if he had previously told his girlfriend that he was the one\r\nwho killed the victim. The witness denied making the statement. Defense\r\ncounsel then sought to -admit extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent\r\nstatement made by the witness. This Court held that even if the evidence was\r\ninadmissible as evidence of third-party guilt, it was admissible for impeachment\r\npurposes. However, unlike the instant case, the witness in Fossick testified for\r\nthe State concerning circumstances surrounding the crime. \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextraneous or improper influences. State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99\r\n(1998). Unless the misconduct affects the jury's impartiality, it is not such\r\nmisconduct as will affect the verdict. Id. The granting or refusing of a motion\r\nfor a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling\r\nwill not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion amounting to an\r\nerror of law occurs. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Defendant does not contend that the trial court should have\r\ngranted a mistrial. Rather, he argues the trial court should have done\r\nsomething more to investigate the alleged misconduct. Initially, it is hard to\r\nconceive of anything more the trial court could have done to investigate the\r\nincident. Moreover, defense counsel never requested that the trial court do\r\nanything else. Nevertheless, there simply was no showing of any outside\r\ninfluence on the jury which resulted in prejudice. We therefore affirm the trial\r\ncourt on this issue. See Kelly, supra (holding that a juror's possession of a\r\nreligious pamphlet on the death penalty did not warrant reversal). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nD. DIRECTED VERDICT ON THE MURDER CHARGE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed\r\nverdict on the murder charge since the evidence raised only a mere suspicion\r\nof guilt. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence\r\nmust be viewed in the light most favorable to the State, and if there is any\r\ndirect evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending\r\nto prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that the case was\r\nproperly submitted to the jury. State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63\r\n(1998). In ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court is concerned\r\nwith the existence of evidence, not its weight. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, there was substantial circumstantial evidence of\r\nDefendant's guilt. There was testimony that Defendant told police that he had\r\na fight with Victim on the night of the murder and slashed Victim two or three\r\ntimes with a knife. There was evidence that Defendant cut his hands on a knife\r\nas a result of stabbing Victim. Further, there was expert testimony that\r\nDefendant's blood matched blood found on Victim's body. We therefore find the\r\ntrial court correctly denied Defendant's motion for a directed verdict on the\r\nmurder charge. \r\n  \r\np.9\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE. CLOSING ARGUMENTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendant argues his conviction should be reversed based upon (1) the\r\nsolicitor's inflammatory comments during closing arguments, and (2) the\r\nsolicitor's comments on Defendant's silence. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. Inflammatory Comments \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendant contends the cumulative effect of the following comments\r\nprejudiced the defense: First, in commenting on Defendant's initial statement\r\ngiven to police, the solicitor stated: \"Does that look like you cut your right hand\r\nreaching for a cigarette lighter? Does that look like you cut your hand slipping\r\ndown across a blade from stabbing someone?\" The solicitor later stated: \"And\r\nthen his mother comes to an officer to get Captain Counts to talk to her son\r\nagain. He told a little more.\" Defendant contends the implication was that he\r\nconspired with his mother in giving a second voluntary statement to the police.\r\nSecond, the solicitor stated: \"[Defendant] cut his hand, and he is standing over\r\nthat victim.\" Finally, the Solicitor argued: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAnd look at those wounds. Remember the testimony from Dr.\r\nSexton. Back and forth. From right to left. To left to right. They\r\nwent in both directions. What does that indicate to you, ladies and\r\ngentlemen? It indicates a sawing motion, and the mutilation to the\r\nface. What is more malicious, ladies and gentlemen, than to stab\r\na man and to saw a man's neck and to cut his face 71 times and\r\nthen stand over him and watch him die? That is murder. That is\r\nmurder in this state and any state. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA solicitor's closing argument must be carefully tailored so it does not\r\nappeal to the personal biases of the jurors. State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 278\r\nS.E.2d 335 (1981). The argument may not be calculated to arouse the jurors'\r\npassions or prejudices and its content should stay within the record and its\r\nreasonable inferences. Id.; see State v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d 114\r\n(1997). However, a solicitor has a right to state his version of the testimony and\r\nto comment on the weight to be given such testimony. State v. Caldwell, 300\r\nS.C. 494, 388 S.E.2d 816 (1990). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, the solicitor's comments were based upon evidence in\r\nthe record and reasonable inferences therefrom. The solicitor's statement that\r\nDefendant stood over Victim after stabbing him is supported by evidence that \r\n  \r\np.10\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome of the blood found on Victim's body matched Defendant's blood, and\r\nOfficer Counts testimony that he found \"uniform drops of blood that were\r\nconsistent when falling at a 90 degree angle straight to the abdomen area of the\r\nvictim in three specific areas.\" Further, the evidence revealed Victim's face and\r\nneck had been brutally slashed and cut over 70 times. We therefore affirm the\r\ntrial court on this issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2. Comments on Silence \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDefendant contends the following comments by the solicitor improperly\r\nreferred to Defendant's silence: \"There's no testimony in this record of any other\r\nknife being used;\" \"We don't know what clothes he was wearing. There were\r\nonly two people in there, ladies and gentlemen, the defendant and Chuck\r\nGriffin.\" After the first comment, defense counsel objected, and the trial judge\r\ngave the following curative instruction: \"To the extent that [the solicitor's]\r\ncomments may have implied to you that the defendant has any burden of\r\ncoming forward with any evidence, you must disregard those comments,\r\nbecause he has no such burden.\" Defense counsel raised no contemporaneous\r\nobjection to the solicitor's second comment.4 See State v. Robinson, 238 S.C.\r\n140, 119 S.E.2d 671 (1961)(issue is not preserved for review where there is no\r\ncontemporaneous objection to solicitor's comments). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt is impermissible for the prosecution to comment, directly or indirectly,\r\nupon the defendant's failure to testify at trial. Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182,\r\n480 S.E.2d 733 (1997)(citing Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229,\r\n14 L. Ed.2d 106 (1965)); Robinson, supra. However, improper comments on a\r\ndefendant's failure to testify do not automatically require reversal if they are\r\nnot prejudicial to the defendant. Johnson, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the instant case, it is questionable whether the solicitor's comments\r\neither directly or indirectly referred to Defendant's failure to testify or present\r\na defense at trial. However, even if a negative inference could have been made\r\nby the jury, the trial judge immediately gave a curative instruction following\r\ndefense counsel's objection. Further, the trial court charged the jury, after\r\nclosing arguments, that Defendant did not have the burden of proving his \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 Defense counsel had a standing objection to references made by the\r\nsolicitor to things not in the record. Defense counsel renewed this objection at\r\nthe end of the solicitor's arguments. However, this objection did not relate to\r\ncomments on Defendant's silence. \r\n  \r\np.11\r\n\r\nSTATE V.  COOPER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninnocence, and the jury could not consider Defendant's failure to testify in its\r\ndeliberations. We find that any prejudice to Defendant was cured by the trial\r\ncourt's instructions to the jury. See Johnson, supra (holding that even\r\nassuming arguendo the comment was improper, the trial court's instruction to\r\nthe jury that it could not consider Johnson's failure to testify in any way and\r\ncould not use it against him was sufficient to cure any potential error); State v.\r\nPlath, 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E.2d 619 (1984)(holding that solicitor's comment that\r\ndefendants were not testifying was cured by solicitor's apology and judge's\r\ncharge). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBased upon the foregoing, we AFFIRM the trial court on all issues. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., M00RE, WALLER, and BURNETT, concur. \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24919","title":"Darby v. the Furman Co.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=24919","description":"","date":"1999-03-15","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n  Shearouse Adv.

The Furman Co., No. 97-\r\nUP-241 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 4, 1997). The case involves a breach of\r\nfiduciary duty claim against a real estate broker. The Court of Appeals \r\n  \r\np.13\r\n\r\nDARBY V.  THE FURMAN CO. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremanded for further factual findings. We reverse. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPetitioner Gwendolyn N. Darby (\"Darby\") owned a large tract of land in\r\nGreenville County. In 1987, Darby contacted respondent Furman Company,\r\nInc. (\"Furman\") and spoke with its agent, Bill Fogleman (\"Fogleman\"). Darby\r\nexpressed interest in selling 53 acres of her Greenville County property and\r\nsigned an \"Exclusive Right to Sell\" contract on May 5, 1987. In that contract,\r\nDarby agreed to pay a $500 per acre real estate commission. . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFogleman produced Yarborough Real Estate Development Company\r\n(\"Yarborough\") as a potential purchaser. Yarborough planned to develop the\r\nproperty into a new housing subdivision. Darby signed a Contract of Purchase\r\nand Sale with Yarborough on May 15, 1987. Under the terms of that contract,\r\na purchase money note add mortgage provided most of the purchase price. The\r\ncontract required Darby to subordinate her security interest to the buyer's\r\nanticipated development financing. Their agreement placed no cap on the\r\namount to which Darby's interest could be subordinated. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter Darby signed the purchase contract in May, agent Fogleman and his\r\nwifejoined purchaser Yarborough and another real estate developer in forming\r\nSquires Creek Partnership (\"Squires Creek\"). Yarborough then transferred its\r\ninterest in the real estate sales contract to Squires Creek. Squires Creek closed\r\nthe sale of the -property with Darby in December of that year. The trial\r\nproduced conflicting testimony as to the extent Fogleman revealed to Darby his\r\npartnership interest with Squires Creek. Fogleman claims that he fully\r\ndisclosed his interests to Darby. Darby maintains that she was unaware of the\r\nnature and extent of Fogleman's involvement with the purchaser. Fogleman\r\ndid testify that he never put into writing any disclosure to Darby. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSquires Creek obtained more than $1.2 million in development financing\r\nfor the project. The development project failed and the construction lender\r\nforeclosed on the property. Not only did Darby lose her land, but the foreclosure\r\naction eliminated her purchase money note and mortgage. Darby obtained a\r\njudgment against Squires Creek for the value then owing on its promissory note\r\nplus interest ($315,056.45). The Foglemans, who paid $30,000, are the only\r\nones to have made a payment on this award. Darby has also sued and reached\r\na confidential settlement with the attorney who advised her on the contract. \r\n  \r\np.14\r\n\r\nDARBY V.  THE FURMAN CO. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present case, Darby sued Furman on a theory of vicarious liability\r\nfor Fogleman's breach of fiduciary duty and fraud. She sought the total amount\r\nto satisfy her earlier judgment along with the return of $26,500 in commission\r\nfees she paid to Furman, The trial court judge heard the case without a jury\r\nand found that Darby's breach of fiduciary duty claim was the equivalent of a\r\nclaim for constructive fraud. The judge found that Darby failed to prove the\r\nreliance element of her cause of action and then dismissed her claim with\r\nprejudice. Darby alleged on appeal that the trial court: (1) abused its discretion\r\nin denying her motion to transfer the case to the jury roster; (2) erred in\r\ngranting Furman a directed verdict on the fraud claim; (3) erred in finding for\r\nFurman on her breach of fiduciary duty claim; and (4) ruled improperly on her\r\ndamages. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court on all the issues except the\r\nreturn of the real estate commission and remanded that issue to the trial court\r\nfor further findings. Darby then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari\r\nthat was granted on the following issue: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAre real estate brokers allowed to retain a sales commission when\r\nthey become the purchaser of the property? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDarby argues that Furman must disgorge the real estate sales\r\ncommission because Fogleman failed to satisfy his fiduciary obligations when\r\nhe became the purchaser of the property. We agree. Real estate agents occupy\r\na fiduciary relationship with their clients and are, under a legal obligation as\r\nwell as a high moral duty to give loyal service to the principal. Hamby v. St.\r\nPaul Mercury Indemn. Co., 217 F.2d 78, 80 (4th Cir. 1954). The duty of an agent\r\nto make full disclosure to his principal of all material facts relevant to the\r\nagency is fundamental to the fiduciary relationship of principal and agent. Bost\r\nv. Bankers Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 242 S.C. 274, 283, 130 S.E.2d 907, 911-12\r\n(1963); see also Designer Showrooms, Inc. v. Kelley, 304 S.C. 478,405 S.E.2d 417\r\n(Ct. App. 1991)(\"A broker owes a duty to its principal to keep it fully and\r\nproperly informed of all material facts.\").1 \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Commentators have even referred to the broker's duty of disclosure as\r\n\"Perhaps the most important fiduciary duty the broker owes to the principal.\r\n. .\" Paula C. Murray, The Real Estate Broker and the Buyer: Negligence and the\r\nDuty to Investigate, 32 Vill. L. Rev. 939, 944 (1987). \r\n  \r\np.15\r\n\r\nDARBY V.  THE FURMAN CO. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, a person cannot be both the seller's agent and the\r\npurchaser of the property without an inherent conflict. Pollitzer v. Long, 295\r\nS.C. 28, 30, 367 S.E.2d 18, 20 (1988); see also Designer Showrooms, Inc. v.\r\nKelley, 304 S.C. 478,405 S.E.2d 417 (Ct. App. 1991)(\"There is a repugnancy of\r\none serving as both broker for a principal and purchaser for that same\r\nprincipal.\"). By becoming a member of the entity with an outstanding offer to\r\npurchase the property of his principal, Fogleman abandoned his position as an\r\nagent to sell and became a purchaser of the property. In order to complete the\r\ntransaction and keep any commission for the sale, Fogleman's fiduciary duty\r\nrequired him to inform Darby of these material facts and obtain her express\r\npermission to continue. See 12 Am. Jur. 2d Brokers Â§ 120 (1997) (\"Generally,\r\na broker can neither purchase from, nor sell to, his or her principal, unless the\r\nlater expressly consents or acquiesces to the transactions with full knowledge\r\nof all the facts and circumstances.\").2 Even though Darby could not maintain\r\na case for breach of fiduciary duty against Furman with regard to the overall\r\nsale of the property, that does not mean Fogleman satisfied all his fiduciary\r\nduties and earned the commission. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhen selling to himself, a real estate broker fails to satisfy his fiduciary\r\nduty to disclose all material facts to the principal if the broker fails to secure an\r\nagreement from the seller acknowledging both his change in position along with\r\nthe seller's right to refuse the commission's payment. See 12 Am. Jur. 2d\r\nBrokers Â§ 120 (1997); cf Designer Showrooms, Inc. v. Kelley, 304 S.C. 478) 405\r\nS.E.2d 417 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding that a broker was not entitled to the sales\r\ncommission where he secretly sold the property to himself because he breached\r\na fiduciary duty and had ceased to act as the seller's agent). This disclosure\r\nrequirement is intended to satisfy the strict fiduciary requirements placed on\r\nan agent when the agent becomes the purchaser of the principal's property. See\r\nAm Jur. 2d Brokers Â§ 118 (1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhen selling to himself, a broker must meet the extremely high\r\nstandards of his fiduciary obligation as well as carry the burden of proof to show \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 For real estate brokers, this duty is codified at S.C. Code of Regulations\r\nR. 105-20 that requires: \"No broker or salesman shall either directly or\r\nindirectly buy for himself or for a corporation or any other business in which he\r\nholds an interest or for a close relative, property listed with him or property for\r\nwhich he has been approached by the seller or prospective buyer to act as\r\nbroker, without first making his true position clearly known to all parties\r\ninvolved.\" (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\np.16\r\n\r\nDARBY V.  THE FURMAN CO. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfull disclosure of his position to the principal. In a situation where the agent is\r\non both sides of a transaction, the broker can only meet these responsibilities\r\nby obtaining an agreement of at least the same formality as the initial\r\nagreement creating the agency relationship. Cf S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-57-137(M)\r\n(Supp. 1998)(\"A [real estate broker] may act as a disclosed dual agent only with\r\nthe prior informed and written consent of all parties.\").3 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn the present case Darby and Furman had a written agency agreement.\r\nThus, in order to claim the commission, Fogleman and Furman would have to\r\nproduce a written agreement signed by Darby acknowledging Fogleman as a\r\nmember of Squires Creek and recognizing Darby's right to chose not to pay the\r\ncommission. Oral explanations by Fogleman fully disclosing his position in\r\nSquires Creek would be insufficient to secure the commission. Fogleman\r\nadmits he did not make any disclosure or obtain a waiver in writing. Darby is\r\ntherefore entitled to recover the commission. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the Court of Appeals is \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ-, concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 While not in effect at the time this dispute arose, this section governs\r\nreal estate brokers acting as a \"dual agent\" in transactions. Here, Fogleman\r\nhad an even greater conflict than mere dual agency, he became part of the\r\npurchaser of the property. \r\n  \r\np.17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24920","title":"Gynecology Clinic, Inc., etc. v.

Coe, of Law Office of Suzanne E. Coe, of\r\nGreenville, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPER CURIAM: This is an appeal from an order finding \r\n  \r\np.18\r\n\r\nGYNECOLOGY CLINIC, INC., etc. v. CLOER, et al. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappellants engaged in a civil conspiracy, and enjoining their picketing\r\nactivities directed towards respondent, an abortion services provider. We\r\naffirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellants first assert that, because their actions are protected\r\nby the First Amendment, they cannot be the basis for a civil conspiracy.\r\nUnder South Carolina law, \"lawful acts may become actionable as a civil\r\nconspiracy when the object is to ruin or damage the business of another.\"'\r\nLaMotte v. Punch Line of Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. 66, 370 S.E.2d 711\r\n(1988). The record is replete with evidence that appellants' goal is to\r\ndiscourage women from patronizing respondent's business with the goal of\r\nmaking abortion unavailable. Assuming appellants' acts were lawful, that\r\nfact does not prevent the finding of a civil conspiracy. LaMotte v. Punch\r\nLine of Columbia, Inc., supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellants next contend that respondent did not prove a\r\nconspiracy because respondent did not show special damages. An action for\r\ncivil conspiracy is an action at law, and the trial judge's findings will be\r\nupheld on appeal unless they are without evidentiary support. Future\r\nGroup II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 478 S.E.2d 45 (1996). In a conspiracy\r\naction, what is required is proof of the fact of damages, not certainty of\r\namount. Charles v. Texas Co., 199 S.C. 156, 18 S.E.2d 719 (1942). \"The\r\nelements which go to make up such damages must depend on the nature of\r\nthe act and the injury.\" Id. Appellants' own literature, which claims to have\r\ndamaged respondent by causing a dramatic drop in the number of abortions\r\nperformed at the clinic, is itself evidence of damages. We affirm the trial\r\njudge's damages findings. Future Group II v. Nationsbank, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFinally, appellants raise numerous evidentiary challenges to the\r\nfindings of the trial judge which form the basis for the injunctive relief\r\ngranted respondent. We find no evidentiary or constitutional error in the\r\ninjunction issued here. Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New\r\nYork, 519 U.S. 357, 117 S.Ct. 855, 137 L.Ed. 1 (1997); Madsen v.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\nDeputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and\r\nAssistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland,\r\nall of Columbia; and Solicitor W. Townes Jones IV, of\r\nGreenwood, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMOORE, A.J.: Appellant was convicted of murder and\r\nsentenced to life. We affirm. \r\n  \r\np.1\r\n\r\nSTATE v. PEREZ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFour days after their marriage, appellant murdered his wife,\r\nBrenda Connelly. Brenda's 11-year-old son testified he saw appellant stab\r\nhis mother. Brenda was stabbed five times and the wounds were so severe\r\nthat she was almost decapitated. Appellant contended at trial that Brenda\r\nhad threatened to kill herself and he was merely attempting to get a knife\r\naway from her when she fell on it.1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDid the trial court err in denying appellant an interpreter to\r\ntranslate his criminal trial thereby violating appellant's Sixth\r\nAmendment rights to confront witnesses and be present at his trial? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, appellant contends the trial judge erred by denying\r\nappellant an interpreter. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant made a pre-trial motion requesting that the interpreter at\r\nhis trial be allowed to translate everything said in the courtroom. The trial\r\ncourt stated he would allow the interpreter to translate the questions for\r\nappellant and, if appellant testified, both the questions and answers.\r\nAppellant then asked for pauses in the trial at certain crucial points to allow\r\nthe interpreter time to explain the proceeding to appellant. The trial judge\r\nstated, \"Well, I assume the interpreter is - has been in the business long\r\nenough that she can sit there and interpret for him everything that's going\r\non. If it gets to be a problem, if you will let me know, then we'll cross that\r\nbridge when we come to it.\" Nothing further was said. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant never objected to the trial court's ruling as to the pauses in\r\nthe trial and he never informed the trial judge of any problems. Accordingly,\r\nthese arguments are procedurally barred. State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Although this was the majority of appellant's testimony, there was\r\nalso testimony and it was argued that Brenda was cheating on appellant and\r\nhe committed the murder in an act of jealousy. Ultimately, only murder and\r\nvoluntary manslaughter were submitted to the jury - not accident or self\r\ndefense. \r\n  \r\np.2\r\n\r\nSTATE v. PEREZ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n401 S.E.2d 168 (1991)(issue not raised to and ruled on by the trial court is\r\nnot preserved for appeal). See also State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189) 498\r\nS.E.2d 642 (1998)(whether trial judge erred in not granting recess is\r\nprocedurally barred because, while counsel indicated he might need recess,\r\ncounsel never actually requested one). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant also contends the trial judge erred in failing to administer\r\nan oath to the interpreter.2 Appellant never objected to the failure of the\r\ntrial judge to administer the oath to the interpreter.3 See, e.g. State v. Rosa,\r\n47 Ohio App.3d 172, 547 N.E.2d 1232 (1988)(defendant waived trial court's\r\nfailure to administer oath to interpreter by failing to object); People v. Avila,\r\n797 P.2d 804 (Colo. 1990)(defendant waived error of trial court's failure to\r\nadminister oath to interpreter when he failed to object); State v. Puente\r\nGomez, 121 Idaho 702, 827 p.2d 715 (1992)(failure to object precludes\r\nreversal for failure of trial court to administer oath to interpreter).\r\nAccordingly, these arguments are procedurally barred and appellant's\r\nconviction and sentence are \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 The interpreter was sworn prior to petitioner's testimony, but\r\npetitioner alleges the interpreter should have been sworn at the beginning of\r\nthe trial. An interpreter is considered a witness in the sense that the\r\naccuracy of her translation is a question of fact for the jury which may be\r\ndisputed by counsel. State v. Puente-Gomez, 121 Idaho 702, 827 P.2d 715\r\n(1992). While the administration of the oath to a witness is fundamental to\r\ngive the witness's testimony binding force, in the absence of a timely\r\nobjection, unsworn testimony does not constitute a nullity. Further, \"[n]o\r\nconstitutional provision is violated when unsworn testimony is received.\" 81\r\nAm. Jur.2d Witnesses Â§ 712 (1976). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 The General Assembly recently enacted two statutes which address\r\ninterpreters and their qualifications in trials when a party or witness does\r\nnot speak English well enough to testify. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-1-50 and 15\r\n27-155 (Supp. 1998). These statutes became effective after petitioner's trial\r\nand thus are inapplicable in this case. \r\n  \r\np.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24922","title":"Renaissance Enterprises, Inc. v.

Babb, of Little River, pro se. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRichard M. Lovelace, Jr., of Lovelace &amp; Rogers, P.A.,\r\nof Conway, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n MOORE, A.J.: Petitioner Malcolm Babb is the president and\r\n director of Renaissance Enterprises, Inc., a Sub-Chapter \"S\" Corporation.\r\n The only two shareholders are Babb and his wife. Renaissance currently has\r\n a matter pending before the Court of Appeals and Babb is representing\r\n Renaissance. The Court of Appeals informed Babb that an attorney must be \r\n  \r\np.4\r\n\r\nRENAISSANCE ENTERPRISES, INC., et al. v. SUMMIT TELESERVICES, INC. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhired to represent Renaissance. Babb petitioned this Court in its original\r\njurisdiction seeking a ruling on whether non-lawyers can represent a\r\ncorporation in circuit or appellate courts. The Court of Appeals has held the\r\nmatter in abeyance pending the resolution of this issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhether a non-lawyer can represent a\r\ncorporation in circuit and appellate courts? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n In State v. Wells, 191 S.C. 468, 5 S.E.2d 181 (1939), the Court held a\r\n lay person could not represent a corporation. However, in In re\r\n Unauthorized Practice of Law, 309 S.C. 3041 422 S.E.2d 123 (1992), we\r\n modified Wells \"to allow a business to be represented by a non-lawyer\r\n officer, agent or employee, including attorneys licensed in other jurisdictions\r\n and those possessing Limited Certificates of Admission pursuant to Rule\r\n 405, SCACR, in civil magistrate's court proceedings.\"1 We have never ruled\r\n on the issue whether a non-lawyer can represent a corporation in circuit or\r\n appellate courts. We now hold a non-lawyer cannot represent a corporation\r\n in circuit or appellate courts. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Babb relies upon S.C. Code Â§ 40-5-320(A)(1)(Supp. 1998) which\r\n provides: \"(A) It is unlawful for a corporation or voluntary association to: (1)\r\n practice or appear as an attorney at law for a person other than itself in a\r\n court in this State or before a judicial body. . .\" (emphasis added). In In re\r\n Unauthorized Practice of Law, we did not address the language in this\r\n statute.2 \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Recently, we stated that non-attorneys may not represent the State in\r\nguilty pleas and plea negotiations in cases transferred from general sessions\r\nto municipal or magistrate's court pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Âº 22-3-545\r\n(Supp. 1997). In re Lexington County Transfer Court, Op. No. 24890 (S.C.\r\nSup. Ct. filed January 25, 1999). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n2 Babb contends that this Court's opinion in Fanning v. Fritz's Pontiac\r\nCadillac-Buick, Inc., 322 S.C. 399, 472 S.E.2d 242 (1996), provides support\r\nfor the proposition that a layperson can represent a corporation in an\r\nappellate court. We disagree. In Fanning, one of the respondents did appear \r\n  \r\np.5\r\n\r\nRENAISSANCE ENTERPRISES, INC., et al. v. SUMMIT TELESERVICES, INC. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The adjudicative power of the Court carries with it the inherent power\r\n to control the order of its business to safeguard the rights of litigants.\r\n Williams v. Bordon's Inc., 274 S.C. 275, 262 S.E.2d 881 (1980)(statute which\r\n attempted to exercise ultimate authority over inherent power of Court\r\n violated separation of powers doctrine). As pointed out in In re Unauthorized\r\n Practice of Law, supra, \"[t]he Constitution commits to this Court the duty to\r\n regulate the practice of law in South Carolina.\" 309 S.C. at 305, 422 S.E.2d\r\n at 124.3 Any interpretation which would expand our decisions regarding the\r\n practice of law would violate the separation of powers provision which is set\r\n forth in article 5, section 1 of our State Constitution. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The goal of the prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law is\r\n to protect the public from incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible\r\n representation. The majority of other jurisdictions have held a corporation\r\n must be represented by an attorney in all courts. See e.g. Nicollet\r\n Restoration, Inc., supra. See generally Jay M. Zitter, Annotation, Propriety\r\n and Effect of Corporation's Appearance Pro Se Through Agent Who Is Not\r\n Attorney 8 A.L.R.5th 653 (1992). Some jurisdictions, however, allow a\r\n corporation to represent itself through a director or an officer only in small\r\n claims court or a court which is not a court of record (i.e. equivalent to our\r\n magistrate's court). Jadair Inc. v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 209 Wis.2d\r\n 1872 562 N.W.2d 401 (1997); Feldman v. Mazzei, 631 N.Y.S.2d 241\r\n (1995)(any authorized employee may appear for a corporation in small\r\n claims court); Turkey Point Property Owners' Ass'n, Inc. v. Anderson, 106 \r\n  \r\n\r\nHowever, this was never an issue brought up in the case on appeal. The sole\r\nreference in the opinion which Babb relies upon is when Fritz Waider is\r\nlisted as pro se counsel in the listing of the attorneys in the caption. This is\r\nnot precedent for the issue in this case. \r\n  \r\n3 In Nocollet Restoration, Inc. v. Turnham, 486 N.W.2d 753 (Minn.\r\n1992), the Minnesota Supreme Court addressed an issue almost identical to\r\n the one in this case. A Minnesota statute stated that no corporation shall\r\n maintain, conduct, or defend, \"except in its own behalf when a party litigant.\r\n . . . 11 an action in any court. (emphasis added). The Minnesota Supreme\r\n Court cited the separation of powers doctrine and noted that the court was\r\n vested with exclusive power to make rules governing the practice of law. It\r\n concluded that the legislative enactment which purported to authorize\r\n certain classes to practice law was not controlling upon the judiciary. \r\n  \r\np.6\r\n\r\nRENAISSANCE ENTERPRISES, INC., et al. v. SUMMIT TELESERVICES, \r\n\r\nMd.App. 710, 666 A.2d 904 (1995)(officer or designated employee may appear\r\non behalf of corporation in small claims actions); In re Estate of Lydia Nagel,\r\n950 P.2d 693 (Colo. Ct. App. 1997)(generally corporation may appear in court\r\nof record only through attorney); Eckles v. Atlanta Tech. Group, 267 Ga. 801,\r\n485 S.E.2d 22 (1997)(non-lawyer may represent corporation only in a court\r\nthat is not court of record). We agree with these jurisdictions and decline to\r\nextend Wells to allow a non-lawyer to represent a corporation in circuit or\r\nappellate courts. Thus, a corporation may appear pro se only in magistrate's\r\ncourt. Accordingly, we remand to the Court of Appeals for further\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nREMANDED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFINNEY, C.J., TOAL, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\np.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24923","title":"Lester v.

South Carolina Workers' Compensation \r\n  \r\np.8\r\n\r\nLESTER v. S. C. WORKERS' COMPENSATION COMM. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommission, 328 S.C. 535, 493 S.E.2d 103 (Ct. App. 1997). We affirm in\r\npart and reverse in part. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Petitioner Ric Lester d/b/a Fair Play Video (Lester) opened a\r\n video casino in November 1992. He had no payroll in 1992. In January\r\n 1993, Lester began hiring a series of temporary and \"rollover\" employees.\r\n In May 1993, an employee was shot during a robbery of the video casino.\r\n In May 1994, Lester acquired workers' compensation insurance coverage\r\n for his employees. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Lester was directed to appear before Respondent South\r\n Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission) to show\r\n cause why he should not be found in violation of the South Carolina\r\n Workers' Compensation Act (the Act)1 for failure to maintain workers'\r\n compensation insurance coverage for his employees from February 1993\r\n until May 26, 1994. Lester argued, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1\r\n 360(2)(1985), he was exempt from the requirements of the Act because his\r\n payroll was less than $3,000 during 1992. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The single commissioner concluded Lester was not exempt\r\n under Â§ 42-1-360(2). The Appellate Panel, circuit court, and Court of\r\n Appeals affirmed. Lester, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by construing the minimum\r\npayroll exemption provision of Â§ 42-1-360(2) as requiring an\r\nemployer 1) to have a positive payroll during the previous\r\ncalendar year and 2) to expect a similarly low payroll during\r\nthe current calendar year? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSection 42-1-360(2) provides as follows: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis Title shall not apply to: \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-10 to Â§ 42-19-50 (1985 and Supp. 1997). \r\n\r\np.9\r\n\r\nLESTER v. S. C. WORKERS' COMPENSATION COMM. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) Any person who has regularly employed in service less than\r\nfour employees in the same business within the State or who\r\nhad a total annual payroll during the previous calendar year of\r\nless than three thousand dollars regardless of the number of\r\npersons employed during that period. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The Court of Appeals interpreted the minimum payroll\r\n provision of Â§ 42-1-360(2) as exempting employers who have an annual\r\n payroll of less than $3,000 (but at least some payroll) and who expect to\r\n have a similarly low payroll during the current year. Since Lester did not\r\n meet the requirements of the minimum payroll exemption because he had\r\n no payroll during 1992, the Court of Appeals concluded he was not exempt\r\n from providing his employees with workers' compensation in 1993. Lester,\r\n supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Lester agrees the Court of Appeals correctly held the purpose\r\n of the minimum payroll provision is \"to avoid administrative inconvenience\r\n to very small employers.\"2 Given this purpose, Lester asserts it is unlikely\r\n the General Assembly intended to exempt small employers, but not to\r\n exempt even smaller employers who have no payroll. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The cardinal rule of statutory construction is for the Court to\r\n ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. Mid-State Auto\r\n Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 476 S.E.2d 690 (1996).\r\n If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and\r\n definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory\r\n interpretation and the Court has no right to look for or impose another\r\n meaning. Miller v. Doe, 312 S.C. 444, 441 S.E.2d 319 (1994).  Where a\r\n statute is ambiguous, however, the Court must construe the terms of the\r\n statute. Workers' compensation statutes are to be construed in favor of\r\n coverage; any exception to workers' compensation coverage must be\r\n narrowly construed. Peay v. U.S. Silica Co., 313 S.C. 91, 437 S.E.2d 64\r\n (1993). Any reasonable doubts as to construction of the Act should be\r\n resolved in favor of coverage. Maulding v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 See 4 A. Larson, Workers' Compensation Law, Â§ 52.00\r\n (1991)(purpose of minimum number of employees exemption is to avoid\r\n administrative inconvenience to very small employers). \r\n  \r\np.10\r\n\r\nLESTER v. S. C. WORKERS' COMPENSATION COMM. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The minimum payroll exemption provision of Â§ 42-1-360(2) is\r\n ambiguous. It is unclear whether employers who have no payroll in the\r\n previous calendar year meet the terms of the minimum payroll exemption. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Since we must resolve any reasonable doubt as to construction\r\n of the Act in favor of workers' compensation coverage, id., we conclude\r\n employers who have no payroll in the previous calendar year do not meet\r\n the terms of the minimum payroll exemption provision of Â§ 42-1-360(2).\r\n Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly held Lester, who had no payroll\r\n in 1992., was not exempt from the Act in 1993. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n We disagree, however, with the Court of Appeals' conclusion\r\n that, in order to be exempt under the minimum payroll provision, the\r\n employer must also reasonably expect a similarly low payroll during the\r\n current calendar year. While the requirement is logical, no language in Â§\r\n 42-1-360(2) places such a requirement on the employer claiming exemption\r\n from the Act.3 It was error for the Court of Appeals to add this\r\n forecasting requirement to the statute. Estate of Guide v. Spooner, 318\r\n S.C. 335, 457 S.E.2d 623 (Ct. App. 1995)(if legislature had intended\r\n certain result in the statute it would have said so). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED IN PART\r\n AND REVERSED IN PART. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n FINNEY, C.J., TOAL and WALLER, JJ., concur. MOORE,\r\n A.J., dissenting in separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 The Court of Appeals adopted the language found in Kansas Stat.\r\n Ann. Â§ 44-505(a)(2)(1998)(\"[T]he workers compensation act shall apply to\r\n all employments . . . except . . . (2) any employment . . . wherein the\r\n employer had a total gross annual payroll for the preceding calendar year\r\n of not more than $20,000 for all employees and wherein the employer\r\n reasonably estimates that such employer will not have a total gross annual\r\n payroll for the current calendar year of more than $20,000 for all\r\n employees\".). \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\nMOORE, A.J.: I respectfully dissent. In my opinion, the minimum\r\n payroll exemption provision of S.C. Code Â§ 42-1-360(2) is not ambiguous. It\r\n is the majority opinion which creates an ambiguity where none exists. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear\r\n and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing any rules of\r\n statutory interpretation and the Court has no right to look for or impose\r\n another meaning. Paschal v. State of South Carolina Election Comm'n, 317\r\n S.C. 4342 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995). We need not \"divine\" intent when statutory\r\n language is clear and unambiguous, but instead need simply apply the\r\n statute's literal language. Gaster v. Evatt, 326 S.C. 33, 483 S.E.2d 197, 198\r\n (1997). Where the terms of the statute are clear, the Court must apply those\r\n terms according to their literal meaning. This Court cannot construe a\r\n statute without regard to its plain and ordinary meaning, and may not resort\r\n to subtle or forced construction in an attempt to limit or expand a statute's\r\n scope. Paschal, supra. Furthermore, it would be improvident to judicially\r\n engraft extra requirements to legislation which is clear on its face. Berkebile\r\n v. Outen, 311 S.C. 502 426 S.E.2d 760 (1993). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n An employer without a payroll should not be prevented from claiming\r\n this exemption simply because he has no payroll rather than any amount\r\n less than $3,000. Pursuant to the majority's opinion, a payroll of $1.00 the\r\n previous year would allow an employer to claim the exemption. Reading into\r\n the statute a requirement that there must have been some payroll the\r\n previous year is simply a forced construction of the statute and judicially\r\n engrafts extra requirements to this statute which is clear on its face.\r\n Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. \r\n  \r\np.12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24924","title":"State v.

LANGLEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTwenty-eight Moultrie Street was the address of a crack house\r\nin Charleston. Eva Desaussure and her boyfriend, Irvin James, lived in\r\nthe house and they allowed a group of local drug dealers (the Charleston\r\nboys) to base its drug operations in the house in exchange for drugs and\r\nmoney. Members of this group included Simon Blye, Dee, Devron and\r\nEric.1 \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSometime prior to February 1995, Eva and Irvin allowed a\r\ngroup of drug dealers from New York (the New York boys) to also use the\r\nhouse for its drug operations. Members of this group included Supreme,\r\nDerrick and appellant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn early February 1995, the Charleston boys entered the house\r\nat 28 Moultrie Street and an argument developed between Devron and one\r\nof the New York boys, Derrick. Devron threatened Derrick with a sawed\r\noff shotgun and then robbed him. When Eva attempted to intervene,\r\nDevron also threatened her. Devron then knocked Derrick into a window,\r\nshattering it. Derrick fled the house through an upstairs window and the\r\nCharleston boys left. Supreme and appellant were not at the house when\r\nthis incident occurred. However, Eva testified they were extremely upset\r\nwhen they learned of the incident. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe next day, Simon, Dee and Tyrone Moore, a friend of the\r\nCharleston boys, returned to 28 Moultrie Street. Eva testified heated\r\nwords were exchanged between Supreme, who was standing in the\r\ndoorway with his gun, and Simon, Dee, and Tyrone. Eva again intervened\r\nand asked Simon, Dee and Tyrone to leave. They left. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLater that evening, Phillip \"Bunny\" Gibbs (the victim), a friend\r\nof the Charleston boys, purchased drugs from 28 Moultrie Street. He\r\nstayed at the house for about an hour. The New York boys were not at\r\nthe house during that time. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nJust before midnight, the victim returned to 28 Moultrie \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 First names are used throughout this opinion because the record\r\ncontains only first names of most of the individuals involved in this\r\nincident. \r\n  \r\np.14\r\n\r\nSTATE v. LANGLEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStreet. However, because of the tense situation, Eva and Irvin had\r\nordered the doorman not to allow anyone entrance.2 Therefore, the\r\ndoorman would not let the victim enter the house. According to the\r\ntestimony of the doorman, when the victim turned to leave, appellant and\r\nDerrick demanded to be let out of the house. Shortly after appellant and\r\nDerrick left the house, both Eva and the doorman testified they heard\r\ngunshots. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSimon testified he, Devron, Dee and Eric were driving by at\r\nthat time and saw appellant, Derrick and the victim walking down the\r\nstreet. Simon testified either Derrick or appellant shot the victim, and he\r\nsaw Derrick and appellant \"take off running.\" The victim was shot one\r\ntime in the face at close range. Simon admitted the Charleston boys had\r\nguns in the car. The Charleston boys attempted to chase appellant and\r\nDerrick; however, because they did not want to be caught in the area, they\r\nleft. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nEva testified appellant and Derrick ran back to the house and\r\ncalled to Supreme to \"come on\" and the three left the house. Eva testified\r\nshe had not seen appellant since that night. Eva further testified that a\r\nshort time after the New York boys left, gunshots were fired upon the\r\nhouse from an automobile. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTyrone Moore testified the Charleston boys came to his house\r\nshortly after the shooting and Simon told him appellant had shot the\r\nvictim. The police found appellant's cellular telephone at the scene of the\r\nmurder. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDid the trial judge err in allowing the victim's\r\nsister to testify and in admitting a photograph of\r\nthe victim? \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 All the doors had locks on the inside and outside and required a\r\nkey for ingress and egress. Usually, a doorman was responsible for letting\r\npeople in and out of the house. \r\n  \r\np.15\r\n\r\nSTATE v. LANGLEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in allowing the victim's\r\nsister to testify and in admitting a photograph of the victim. Appellant\r\ncontends this evidence was not relevant, and even if relevant, its probative\r\nvalue was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPhyllis Jones, the victim's sister, testified for the State. Over\r\ndefense counsel's objection, Ms. Jones testified about the victim's family\r\nand how the victim acquired his nickname, \"Bunny.\" Ms. Jones testified\r\nthe victim had attended Burke High School where he played the drums in\r\nthe band. Ms. Jones then identified a photograph of the victim. This\r\nphotograph was admitted into evidence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA trial judge is accorded broad discretion in ruling on the\r\nadmissibility of the testimony. State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326, 422 S.E.2d\r\n133 (1992) (holding the admissibility of evidence with little probative value\r\nwas harmless where it did not affect the outcome of the trial), cert. denied,\r\n508 U.S. 915, 113 S.Ct., 2355, 124 L.Ed.2d 263 (1993). All relevant\r\nevidence is admissible. Rule 402, SCRE. Evidence is relevant if it has a\r\ndirect bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable\r\nthe matter in controversy. Rule 401, SCRE; State v. Alexander., 303 S.C.\r\n377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991). Although evidence is relevant, it may be\r\nexcluded if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its\r\nprobative value. Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Alexander, supra. Further, a\r\nphotograph should be excluded if it is calculated to arouse the sympathy\r\nor prejudice of the jury or is irrelevant or unnecessary to substantiate\r\nfacts. State v. Livingston, 327 S.C. 17, 488 S.E.2d 313 (1997). Even if the\r\nevidence was not relevant and thus wrongly admitted by the trial judge,\r\nits admission may constitute harmless error if the irrelevant evidence did\r\nnot affect the outcome of the trial. State v. Davis, supra; State v.\r\nJohnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 993,\r\n112 S.Ct. 1691, 118 L.Ed.2d 404 (1992). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe find Ms. Jones' testimony and the victim's photograph were\r\nnot relevant to proving the guilt of appellant.3 Because the evidence of \r\n  \r\n\r\n3 The State cannot offer evidence of the victim's good character unless\r\nthe defendant first attacks the victim's character. Rule 404(a), SCRE.\r\nThe State claims this testimony and the photograph were relevant to \r\n  \r\np.16\r\n\r\nSTATE v. LANGLEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappellant's guilt was not overwhelming, we cannot find this irrelevant\r\nevidence did not affect the outcome of the trial under a harmless error\r\nanalysis. Compare State v. Livingston, supra (evidence of appellant's guilt\r\nwas not overwhelming so as to find harmless the error in admitting an\r\nirrelevant photograph of victim) with State v. Davis, supra (evidence of\r\nappellant's guilt was overwhelming; therefore, the admission of mother's\r\nirrelevant testimony about the victim was harmless). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA jury could have found appellant guilty of victim's murder\r\nunder several theories presented by the State. First, appellant would be\r\nguilty of murder if he actually shot victim. Second, under the \"hand of\r\none, the hand of all theory,\" appellant would be guilty of murder if he\r\naided Derrick. Under this theory, one who joins with another to\r\naccomplish an illegal purpose is liable criminally for everything done by\r\nhis confederate incidental to the execution of the common design and\r\npurpose. To admit evidence under this theory, the existence of the\r\ncommon design and the participation of the accused against whom the\r\nevidence is offered should first be shown. State v. Woomer, 276 S.C. 258,\r\n277 S.E.2d 696 (1981). Third, appellant would be guilty of murder\r\nif the jury found he was an accomplice. Under accomplice liability theory,\r\nita person must personally commit the crime or be present at the scene of\r\nthe crime and intentionally, or through a common design, aid, abet, or\r\nassist in the commission of that crime through some overt act.\" State v.\r\nAusti , 299 S.C. 456, 459, 385 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1989); see also State v.\r\nLeonard, 292 S.C. 133, 355 S.E.2d 270 (1987) (to be liable as an aider or\r\nabetter, the participant must be chargeable with knowledge of the\r\nprincipal's criminal conduct; mere presence at the scene is not sufficient to\r\nestablish guilt as an aider or abetter). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe State used the following evidence to establish appellant's\r\nguilt: appellant and Derrick left the house together; appellant's cellular \r\n  \r\n\r\nestablish the identity of the victim. However, the victim's identity was not\r\nat issue in this case. Therefore, this evidence was not admissible for this\r\npurpose. Instead, the only possible purpose of this testimony and\r\nintroduction of the photograph was to distance the victim from the drug\r\ndealing that was occurring at 28 Moultrie Street and to neutralize\r\ntestimony by the State's witnesses regarding his drug use. However,\r\nbecause appellant did not attack the victim's character, this evidence\r\nshould not have been admitted. \r\n  \r\np.17\r\n\r\nSTATE v. LANGLEY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntelephone was found at the crime scene; Simon testified either appellant or\r\nDerrick shot the victim; and Tyrone testified that immediately after the\r\nincident, Simon told him appellant shot the victim.

Freeman, of Columbia, for respondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter,\r\nrespondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement under\r\nRule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE) contained\r\nin Rule 413, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and\r\nconsents to a public reprimand, participation in the South Carolina Bar's\r\nLaw Office Management Assistance Program (LOMAP), and completion of\r\nspecial conditions for some of the matters discussed below. We accept the\r\nagreement. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nArlene Johnson Matter \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nArlene Johnson, a widow, retained respondent to title Mrs.\r\nJohnson's home in her name and paid respondent a flat fee of $500 to\r\naccomplish that task. While representing Mrs. Johnson, respondent filed a \r\n  \r\np.19\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF PERKINS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsummons and petition in the Richland County Probate Court and\r\nrepresented Mrs. Johnson at a hearing to establish the heirs at law of Mrs.\r\nJohnson's husband. Prior to the hearing, Mrs. Johnson gave her husband's\r\ndeath certificate and the birth certificates for each of her three children to\r\nrespondent. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter the probate court issued an order naming Mr. Johnson's\r\nheirs at law, respondent took no further steps to title the home in Mrs.\r\nJohnson's name. Mrs. Johnson mailed respondent at least two certified\r\nletters, but respondent failed to retrieve or respond to these letters. In at\r\nleast one of her letters, Mrs. Johnson asked respondent to return the death\r\ncertificate and the birth certificates. Respondent did not return those\r\ndocuments. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMrs. Johnson then wrote a letter of complaint to the Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel mailed a copy of\r\nMrs. Johnson's letter to respondent and requested a reply within fifteen -\r\ndays. Respondent failed to reply to this letter, to a second letter from the\r\nDisciplinary Counsel, and to a Notice of Full Investigation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCarolyn A. Medlin Matter \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCarolyn Medlin, hired respondent to represent her in a zoning\r\nmatter and agreed to pay a $200 legal fee and $100 for costs, $55 of which\r\nwere spent for a filing fee. Approximately two years after hiring respondent,\r\nMs. Medlin sent a letter of complaint to the Commission of Lawyer Conduct.\r\nThe Commission mailed two letters of inquiry in connection with this matter\r\nto respondent but received no response. Respondent indicates that, at the\r\ntime in question, she had difficulty with the postal service forwarding her\r\nmail. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTeresa Smith Matter \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTeresa Smith hired respondent to settle the estate of Ms. Smith's\r\nfather. Through respondent's efforts, Ms. Smith was appointed as personal\r\nrepresentative of the estate; however, respondent failed to determine, within\r\na two-year period, how to partition a tract of land so the estate could sell its\r\ninterest in that land. \r\n  \r\np.20\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF PERKINS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCynthia G. Bair Matter \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent performed legal services for Cynthia G. Bair in\r\nconnection with a Family Court matter. Ms. Bair subsequently hired\r\nFrederick I. Hall, III, as her attorney and asked respondent to transfer her\r\nfile to Mr. Hall. Despite repeated efforts on the part of Ms. Bair and Mr.\r\nHall, respondent did not turn over Ms. Bair's file. In addition, respondent\r\nfailed to respond to two letters and a Notice of Full Investigation from the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct. Respondent has since delivered Ms. Bair's\r\nfile to the Office of the Attorney General, who released the file to Mr. Hall. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nJohn A. Hutchinson Matter \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter his wife's death in 1993, John A. Hutchinson opened an\r\nestate file with the Richland County Probate Court; however, in November,\r\n1996, he retained respondent to handle the estate file. Mr. Hutchinson\r\nprovided respondent with documents she had requested and then attempted\r\nto call respondent so the estate file could be closed. Mr. Hutchinson was not\r\nable to contact her. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn September or October 1997, respondent told Mr. Hutchinson\r\nthat she had filed the necessary documents with the Probate Court. Mr.\r\nHutchinson then arranged to meet respondent at the Probate Court;\r\nhowever, on the morning of their meeting, respondent told Mr. Hutchinson\r\nshe had an emergency and canceled the meeting. Mr. Hutchinson went to\r\nthe Probate Court and learned that respondent had not requested the estate\r\nbe closed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn mitigation, respondent submits that while she was handling\r\nall of the above discussed matters, she was suffering from depression, which\r\nstarted during the final trimester of her first pregnancy, and was the main\r\ncare giver for her newborn child. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nConclusion \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBy her conduct in these matters, respondent failed to provide\r\ncompetent representation, failed to act with reasonable diligence and\r\npromptness in representing clients, failed to abide by a client's decision\r\nregarding scope of representation, failed to keep her clients reasonably\r\ninformed about the status of their matters, failed to comply promptly with \r\n  \r\np.21\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF PERKINS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasonable requests for information, and failed to account for or return\r\nproperty. Rules 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.15, Rule 407, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFurthermore, respondent violated provisions of Rule 7(a), RLDE,\r\nby violating a Rule of Professional Conduct, failing to respond to a lawful\r\ndemand from a disciplinary authority, engaging in conduct tending to pollute\r\nthe administration of justice or bring the Courts or legal profession into\r\ndisrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law, and\r\nviolating her oath of office as an attorney. Rule 7(a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(5), and\r\n(a)(6), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, respondent is hereby publically reprimanded.\r\nRespondent is also ordered, within six months of this opinion, to participate\r\nin LOMAP and to complete the following special conditions relating to some\r\nof the specific matters discussed above: (1) the Johnson matter - return the\r\ndeath certificate and birth certificates or, if the original documents are not\r\navailable, certified copies thereof and refund $150 in attorney fees to Mrs.\r\nJohnson; (2) the Medlin matter- refund $200 in attorney fees and $45 in\r\ncosts to Ms. Medlin; and (3) the Hutchinson matter - return Mr. Hutchinson's\r\nclient file to the Office of the Attorney General and refund $200 in attorney\r\nfees to Mr. Hutchinson. Finally, respondent is directed to provide the\r\nDisciplinary Counsel with proof that she participated in LOMAP and\r\ncompleted the special conditions within the time frame established by this\r\nopinion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nC.J. \r\n  \r\nA.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J. \r\n  \r\np.22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24926","title":"In the Matter of Graab","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=24926","description":"","date":"1999-03-22","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n  Shearouse Adv.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents\r\nto either a definite suspension for a period between eighteen (18) and\r\ntwenty-four (24) months or an indefinite suspension. We accept the\r\nagreement for an indefinite suspension. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAmstetten Corpration Matter \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent represented Amstetten Corporation, Inc. in a real estate\r\nmortgage refinance matter in 1996. The mortgage was refinanced by First\r\nPalmetto Savings Bank (First Palmetto). The closing took place in\r\nrespondent's office on June 20, 1996. As a result of the transaction,\r\nrespondent was instructed to set up a trust account, file the mortgage\r\ndocuments, and pay the Richland County taxes for the year 1995. \r\n  \r\np.23\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GRAAB \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent received $150,000.00 from First Palmetto and\r\nallegedly, this amount was deposited into respondent's trust account with\r\nWachovia Bank on June 21, 1996. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent produced financial records which did not include\r\nbank statements and checks for the year 1996. Respondent stated he\r\nmisplaced those financial records. Respondent ordered monthly statements\r\nfor 1996 from his bank, which reflected a deposit of $150,000.00 on June 21,\r\n1996. However, an examination of respondent's trust account records failed\r\nto produce a deposit ticket for the $150,000.00 transaction, or an entry in\r\nrespondent's Safeguard system. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent's client files on this transaction were examined and\r\nthe materials did not reflect a ledger card, disbursement sheet, or closing\r\nstatement to support bank receipt of these funds. Respondent claims hie is\r\nunable to locate or provide any of the disbursement documents. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent, pursuant to the closing instructions, also was to pay\r\nthe Richland County taxes for tax year 1995, in the amount of $3,107.79.\r\nRespondent admits failing to pay the 1995 taxes, but states the failure was\r\ndue to an administrative oversight by his secretary. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPursuant to county procedures, the Richland County Treasurer's\r\nOffice auctioned off the property of Amstetten Corporation in December\r\n1996, for failure of the property owners to pay the 1995 tax bill. The\r\nproperty was subject to redemption by the owners, upon payment of 1995\r\ntaxes, interest, penalties, and the current taxes due for 1996. Respondent\r\nand Amstetten Corporation were notified of the sale by letter from the\r\nRichland County Treasurer on October 22, 1997. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Treasurer's letter also indicated the First Palmetto\r\nmortgage was not indexed under the number which it was supposed to be\r\nindexed. Subsequently, the Treasurer gained knowledge that First Palmetto\r\nhad an existing mortgage on the property. First Palmetto was notified of the\r\nsale and the requisite actions necessary to redeem the property, prior to the\r\nactual sale. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent, as a result of the June 20, 1996 closing, was\r\nsupposed to file the First Palmetto mortgage reflecting the $150,000.00\r\nrefinancing transaction. Respondent admits he did not file the mortgage in a \r\n  \r\np.24\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GRAAB \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntimely fashion. Further, an examination of respondent's client file regarding\r\nthis matter failed to produce any document reflecting that the new mortgage\r\nwas filed by respondent after the June 20, 1996 closing and prior to July 24,\r\n1997. Respondent's 1996 financial records were also examined and they\r\nfailed to yield a receipt or a copy of the check written to the county RMC\r\noffice to pay for the filing of the mortgage. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent failed to respond to a representative of First\r\nPalmetto's repeated telephone calls about this matter. Respondent also\r\nfailed to communicate with First Palmetto's counsel. Respondent stated he\r\nfelt it more appropriate to go through his title insurance company's lawyer\r\nand let that lawyer deal directly with counsel for the lender. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent eventually filed the mortgage on July 24, 1997;\r\nhowever, the mortgage was rejected by the RMC office for failing to have the\r\nrequisite signatures. The mortgage was refiled on October 31, 1997. The\r\ncheck written from respondent's trust fund account payable to RMC, while\r\ndated June 20, 1996, was not negotiated until July 1997, corresponding to\r\nthe filing date. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent admits between June 20, 1996 and October 14, 1997,\r\nthat $2,977.99 of the client's $3,107.79, being held in trust to pay the 1995\r\ncounty taxes, was misappropriated and converted to purposes other than for\r\nwhich it was intended. Further, respondent admits he deposited and\r\ncommingled personal funds into the trust account to make up for the\r\nshortage of client funds. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn a letter to Disciplinary Counsel regarding this matter,\r\nrespondent made several false statements. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOther Trust Account Violations \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent misappropriated funds for his own use by repaying\r\npersonal loans, and paying for personal and family expenses. Respondent\r\nalso commingled personal funds with client funds. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nJeffcoat/Gore Matter \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent represented client Ronald McCombs relative to a\r\npersonal litigation matter during 1996 and 1997. A deposition of Jacquelyn \r\n  \r\np.25\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GRAAB \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcCombs was taken on March 8, 1996. Respondent ordered a copy of the\r\ndeposition from court reporter, Annette Gore. Respondent admits ordering\r\nand receiving the deposition, as well as receiving the invoice of $629.20.\r\nRespondent admits he did not pay Gore when the invoice arrived. He states\r\nthe payment of the bill was the responsibility of his client and that the bill\r\nwas not paid in a timely manner because he could not collect payment from\r\nhis client. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAfter retaining a lawyer who corresponded with respondent,\r\nrespondent made partial payment to Gore. When respondent failed to\r\ncompletely pay, Gore retained another lawyer, Samuel L. Jeffcoat. Jeffcoat\r\nfiled a non-jury complaint in magistrate's court on or after March 17, 1997.\r\nRespondent filed an answer asserting he did not contract with the court\r\nreporter and the contract- was between his client and Gore. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA hearing was held, although respondent failed to appear due to\r\na conflict in court schedules. Judgment was entered against respondent in\r\nthe amount of the balance of the debt plus $100.00. Respondent has\r\nappealed this judgment, and part of the defense is respondent's reliance on\r\nan Ethics Advisory Opinion, which states the client is responsible for\r\ndeposition costs in specific circumstances. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nKimberly Engelke Matter \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nKimberly Engelke submitted a letter of complaint to the Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel on August 5, 1997. Engelke is respondent's client in a\r\ndivorce action. The letter stated respondent has failed to communicate with\r\nher, has misinformed her as to whether certain documents were being filed,\r\nand has not followed through on actions respondent stated he would perform\r\nin the furtherance of her case. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn a final divorce hearing, dated August 13, 1997, Engelke stated\r\non the record that she was satisfied with the advice and counsel her attorney\r\nhad given her. Respondent, in a letter to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel,\r\nstated he had written to the court reporter of that hearing and requested a\r\ncopy of the transcript to verify Engelke's statement. However, respondent\r\nreceived the transcript and failed to submit the transcript to the Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel for review immediately upon receipt. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA notice of full investigation was submitted to respondent which \r\n  \r\np.26\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GRAAB \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincluded allegations that respondent had failed to provide proof of the\r\nclient's posture to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Respondent submitted\r\na response which stated he had received the hearing transcript and that the\r\ntranscript supports his position. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent was interviewed by an investigator, during which\r\nrespondent provided a copy of the transcript, and stated his failure to\r\nprovide the transcript to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel was an oversight\r\ndue to matters in his professional and personal life. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDisciplinary Counsel (complainant) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA fee dispute arose between respondent and a client, John F.\r\nFlannery. As a result, a fee dispute application was filed with the Fee\r\nDispute Board on September 3, 1996. A hearing before the Board was held\r\nand the Board recommended the matter be resolved by respondent\r\nreimbursing Flannery $500.00. Flannery notified the Board on March 21\r\nand April 27, 1998 that respondent had failed to pay the amount of $500.00.\r\nA letter of information was submitted to Disciplinary Counsel who wrote to\r\nrespondent requesting a reply within fifteen days. The letter was hand\r\ndelivered to respondent during his interview with an investigator. There\r\nwas a misunderstanding between respondent and the investigator as to\r\nwhen respondent's written response was due. Respondent has since\r\nprovided a written response. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nConclusion \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRespondent has violated numerous provisions of the Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct contained in Rule 407, SCACR. Respondent converted\r\nclient funds for his own purposes and failed to keep complete records of his\r\ntrust account funds. Rule 1.15. He failed to provide competent\r\nrepresentation. Rule 1.1. He failed to act with reasonable diligence and\r\npromptness. Rule 1.3. He failed to keep his client reasonably informed\r\nabout the status of the case and respond to requests. Rule 1.4. Respondent\r\nbrought or defended a proceeding, or asserted or controverted an issue which\r\nwas frivolous. Rule 3.1. He knowingly made false statements of a material\r\nfact to a tribunal. Rule 3.3. Respondent failed to make truthful statements\r\nto others. Rule 4.1. He failed to have respect for the rights of others. Rule\r\n4.4. He knowingly made false statements to the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel, failed to disclose facts to that office, and failed to respond to a \r\n  \r\np.27\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF GRAAB \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlawful demand for information from that office. Rule 8.1(a) &amp; (b).

Within\r\nfifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with\r\nthe Clerk of this Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule\r\n413, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nC.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J.\r\nA.J. \r\n  \r\np.28\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"24927","title":"State v.

HAIGLER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant murdered John Bovain (victim) in January 1997 by\r\nshooting him twice in the head with a handgun. The shooting occurred while\r\nappellant, then seventeen years old, was a passenger in a car the victim was\r\ndriving. The car crashed into a building, injuring appellant.

He took detectives to the location where he\r\nhad hidden the pistol in a pile of yard debris while walking home. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant is a black man. The jurors seated in his case included\r\nthree white men, five white women, one black man, and three black women.\r\nThe two alternate jurors, who did not participate in deliberations, were black\r\nmen. The prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges against four black\r\nwomen and one white man. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant raised a Batson1 challenge to the prosecutor's decision to\r\nstrike the black women as prospective jurors. The prosecutor stated he struck\r\nthe first black woman because she was very young and had gone to school with\r\nappellant. He struck the second black woman because she had a shoplifting\r\nconviction. He struck the fourth black woman because she was unemployed,\r\nwhich meant she had an insufficient stake in the community. The trial judge\r\nruled all those were race-neutral reasons for the strikes. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe prosecutor stated he struck the third black woman, Tammy\r\nBerry, for two reasons. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOne reason is that she had prior jury service on a\r\ncriminal sexual conduct and came back with a not\r\nguilty verdict. That wasn't the main reason. The main\r\nreason was that Larry Smith2 who is a key witness \r\n  \r\n\r\n1 Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). \r\n\r\n2 The prosecutor apparently meant to say \"Larry Williams.\" Orangeburg\r\n(continued . . .) \r\n  \r\np.30\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HAIGLER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere knows this person, says she is a good person but\r\nshe is very high strung, a critical type person,\r\nopionated (sic) and he didn't feel like she could\r\ndeliberate well with the other jurors, would be a\r\npolarizing individual. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAppellant argued the first reason given by the prosecutor was\r\npretextual because the prosecutor had accepted Gerald Smith, a white man,\r\nwho also had returned a not guilty verdict in a criminal case.3 Smith had sat\r\non a criminal jury eighteen to twenty years earlier, and he thought he\r\nremembered that the verdict in the domestic shooting case was not guilty.\r\nBerry had sat on a criminal jury five years earlier, and definitely remembered\r\nthat the verdict in the rape case was not guilty. Appellant argued the second\r\nreason given by the prosecutor was pretextual because Berry did not stand up\r\nduring voir dire to say she knew Larry Williams when venire members were\r\nasked whether they knew law enforcement officers involved in the case. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial judge denied the Batson motion, ruling both the\r\nprosecutor's reasons were racially neutral and not, pretextual. Appellant\r\ncontends the judge erred. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\nDid the trial judge err in not finding a Batson\r\nviolation? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\nUnited States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venireperson on the basis\r\nof race. State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207,499 S.E.2d 209 (citing Batson v. Kentucky, \r\n  \r\n\r\n2 (. . . continued)\r\nSheriff s Capt. Larry Williams led the investigation and testified at appellant's\r\ntrial. The prosecutor referred to him as \"Mr. Williams\" at another point during\r\nthe Batson hearing. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n3 Smith did not serve on the jury because appellant struck him. \r\n  \r\np.31\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HAIGLER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupra), cert. denied, _ U.S. _, 119 S.Ct. 552 (1998); Payton v. Kearse, 329\r\nS.C. 51) 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998). The purposes of Batson and its progeny4 are to\r\nprotect the defendant's right to a fair trial by a jury of the defendant's peers.,\r\nprotect each venireperson's right not to be excluded from jury service for\r\ndiscriminatory reasons, and preserve public confidence in the fairness of our\r\nsystem of justice by seeking to eradicate discrimination in the jury selection\r\nprocess. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 404-10, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1367-70, 113\r\nL.Ed.2d 411,420-24 (199 1); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. at 85-87, 106 S.Ct. at\r\n1716-182 90 L.Ed.2d at 79-81. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA Batson hearing is conducted in the following manner. First, the\r\ntrial judge must hold a Batson hearing when members of a cognizable racial\r\ngroup or gender are struck and the opposing party requests a hearing. Second,\r\nthe proponent of the strike must present a race- or gender-neutral explanation.\r\nAt this second step, the proponent of the strike no longer is required to offer a\r\nreason that is race or gender-neutral and clear, reasonably specific, and\r\nlegitimate. The reason must only be race- or gender-neutral. Third, the\r\nopponent of the strike must show that the race- or gender-neutral explanation\r\ngiven was mere pretext. State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114,124,470 S.E.2d 366, 372\r\n(1996) (adopting the Batson procedure set forth in Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S.\r\n765, 115 S.Ct- 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995)). The burden of persuading the\r\ncourt that a Batson violation has occurred remains at all times on the opponent\r\nof the strike. Id. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"Pretext generally will be established by showing that similarly\r\nsituated members of another race were seated on the jury. Under some \r\n  \r\n\r\n4 The Batson principles are broadly applied today. A party may not\r\nexclude potential jurors on the basis of gender as well as race. J.E.B. v.\r\nAlabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 114 S.Ct. 14192 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994). A\r\ncriminal defendant may object to race-based peremptory challenges on equal\r\nprotection grounds regardless of whether the defendant and potential juror\r\nshare the same race. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d\r\n411 (1991). A prosecutor may challenge a defendant's use of peremptory\r\nchallenges as an equal protection violation. Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42,\r\n112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992). The prohibitions on the discriminatory\r\nuse of peremptory challenges apply in criminal and civil cases. Edmonson v.\r\nLeesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991). \r\n  \r\np.32\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HAIGLER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the race-neutral explanation given by the proponent may be so\r\nfundamentally implausible that the judge may determine, at the third step of\r\nthe analysis, that the explanation was mere pretext even without a showing of\r\ndisparate treatment.\" Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. at 55, 495 S.E.2d at 207;\r\naccord State v. Adams, supra; State v. Casey, 325 S.C. 447, 481 S.E.2d 169 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1997). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn deciding whether the opponent of a strike has carried the burden\r\nof persuasion, a court must undertake a sensitive inquiry into the\r\ncircumstantial and direct evidence of intent. A strike must be examined in light\r\nof the circumstances under which it is exercised, including an examination of\r\nthe explanations offered for other strikes. State v. Oglesby, 298 S.C. 279, 37.9\r\nS.E.2d 891 (1989). Whether a party's proffered reason for exercising a\r\nperemptory strike is discriminatory must be determined by examining the\r\ntotality of the facts and circumstances in the record. Riddle v. State, 314 S.C.\r\n12 443 S.E.2d 557 (1994). The composition of the jury panel is a factor that may\r\nbe considered when determining whether a party engaged in purposeful\r\ndiscrimination. State v. Dyar, 317 S.C. 77, 452 S.E.2d 603 (1994); State v.\r\nJohnson, 302 S.C. 243, 395 S.E.2d 167 (1990). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe trial court's findings regarding purposeful discrimination are\r\naccorded great deference and will be set aside on appeal only if clearly\r\nerroneous. State v. Ford, Op. No. 24899 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February 8, 1999)\r\n(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 3 1); State v. Dyar, supra (citing Hernandez v. New\r\nYork, 500 U.S. 352, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991)). When the record\r\ndoes not support a party's stated reason for a strike, this Court will overturn the\r\ntrial court's findings that are based on that reason. State v. Ford, supra; State\r\nv. Patterson, 307 S.C. 180, 414 S.E.2d 155 (1992). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe hold that appellant has not carried his burden of persuasion in\r\nproving the prosecutor engaged in purposeful discrimination during the jury\r\nselection process. The case upon which he primarily relies, State v. Oglesby,\r\nsupra, is inapposite. In that case, the prosecutor struck three black women,\r\nresulting in an all-white jury. The prosecutor adamantly insisted he struck the\r\nblack prospective jurors because they were patients of a doctor who was a\r\ndefense witness. The Court found the reason pretextual because the prosecutor\r\nseated a white woman who also was a patient of the same doctor. \r\n  \r\np.33\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HAIGLER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case, the prosecutor's primary reason for striking Berry was\r\nbecause the lead detective in appellant's case knew her to be a high-strung,\r\ncritical person who would be a polarizing force on the jury. That was a race\r\nneutral reason for the strike. Cf. State v. Richburg, 304 S.C. 162, 403 S.E.2d\r\n315 (1991) (officer's apparent knowledge that venireperson had anti-law\r\nenforcement bias may be race-neutral reason for strike); State v. Smith, 321\r\nS.C. 471) 469 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. App. 1996) (trooper's personal contact with\r\nvenirepersons and belief they may hold anti-law enforcement bias may be race\r\nneutral reason for strike). Berry's failure to reveal during voir dire that she was\r\nacquainted with the lead detective is irrelevant to the Batson analysis, which\r\nfocuses upon a party's knowledge of a potential juror and reason for exercising\r\na peremptory challenge. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe prosecutor's second, less important reason for striking Berry\r\nwas that she had served on a criminal jury that had returned a not guilty\r\nverdict. If we deemed that reason to be pretextual because the prosecutor\r\nseated Smith, a white man who also had served on a criminal jury that returned\r\na not guilty verdict, then we would find a Batson violation under Payton v.\r\nKearse, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Payton v. Kearse, we rejected the dual motivation analysis,\r\ninstead adopting a \"tainted\" approach in which a fundamentally implausible or\r\npretextual reason for a strike taints any other legitimate reason for the strike.\r\n\"Once a discriminatory reason has been uncovered. -- either inherent or\r\npretextual -- this reason taints the entire jury selection procedure. By adopting\r\ndual motivation, this Court would be approving a party's consideration of\r\ndiscriminatory factors so long as sufficient nondiscriminatory factors were also\r\npart of the decision to strike a juror and the discriminatory factor was not the\r\nsubstantial or motivating factor. However, any consideration of discriminatory\r\nfactors in this decision is in direct contravention of the purpose of Batson which\r\nis to ensure peremptory strikes are executed in a nondiscriminatory manner.\"\r\nId., 329 S.C. at 59, 495 S.E.2d at 210. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHowever, we do not believe the prosecutor's second reason was\r\nfundamentally implausible or pretextual. First, Berry and Smith were not\r\nsimilarly situated in that Berry had served on a criminal jury five years earlier\r\nand definitely remembered the verdict, while Smith had served on a criminal\r\njury some twenty years earlier and was unsure of the verdict. Second, and more \r\n  \r\np.34\r\n\r\nSTATE v. HAIGLER \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportantly, the circumstances of the jury selection process indicate the\r\nprosecutor did not strike potential jurors for racially motivated reasons. While\r\nthe prosecutor struck four black prospective jurors, he seated four black people\r\non the regular jury and two black alternate jurors. See State v. Dyar, supra\r\n(composition of jury panel is one factor to consider in Batson analysis); State v.\r\nGuess, 318 S.C. 269, 457 S.E.2d 6 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding no purposeful\r\ndiscrimination, in part because jury included six members of the minority\r\nallegedly offended); State v. Watts, 320 S.C. 377,465 S.E.2d 359 (Ct. App. 1995)\r\n(finding no purposeful discrimination, in part because jury was composed of\r\neight white people and four black people, and prosecutor had struck two white\r\npeople). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSimilarly, the record contains no indication the prosecutor's stated\r\nreasons for striking the other three black women -- that one was too young and\r\nknew appellant, one had a criminal conviction, and one was unemployed -- were\r\nmotivated by purposeful discrimination. See State v. Ford, supra (lack of\r\nemployment or place or type of employment may be race-neutral reason for\r\nstrike); State v. Johnson, 302 S.C. 243, 395 S.E.2d 167 (1990) (potential juror's\r\nknowledge of and association with defendant may be race-neutral reason for\r\nstrike); State v. Dyar, supra (past prosecution of potential juror by particular\r\nsolicitor's office may be race-neutral reason for strike); State v. Green, 306 S.C.\r\n941 409 S.E.2d 785 (1991) (unemployment may be race-neutral reason for a\r\nstrike); State v. Martinez, 294 S.C. 72, 362 S.E.2d 641 (1987) (unemployment\r\nand possible criminal records may be race-neutral reasons for a strike). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe conclude the trial judge correctly ruled that appellant failed to\r\nprove a Batson violation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe dispose of appellant's three remaining issues pursuant to Rule\r\n220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Issue 2: State v.
