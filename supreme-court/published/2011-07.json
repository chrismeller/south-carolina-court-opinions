Â We\r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis Court has unfortunately\r\n  become familiar with the Town of Atlantic Beach's municipal elections, and the\r\n  disputes that inevitably accompany them.[1]Â \r\n  Before framing the procedural particulars of this dispute, an initial\r\n  explanation of the municipal government structure of Atlantic Beach is\r\n  instructive.Â  Similarly, an analysis of the issues presented is incomplete\r\n  without providing the background of events leading up to the election.\r\nThe Town of Atlantic Beach\r\n  employs a council-manager form of government, provided for in title 5, chapter\r\n  13 of the South Carolina Code. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-13-10-100 (2004).Â  Under\r\n  this form of government, the governing body is the municipal council, which is\r\n  comprised of a mayor, and four, six, or eight councilmembers. [2]Â  Id. Â§ 5-13-20(a).Â  This governing body is responsible for appointing\r\n  three electors as members of the municipal election commission.Â  Id. Â§\r\n  5-15-90.Â  The municipal election commission, in turn, has the power to\r\n  &quot;supervise and conduct all municipal . . . elections,&quot; id. Â§\r\n  5-15-100, and in the case of contested election results, the power to\r\n  &quot;conduct a hearing on the contest, decide the issues raised,&quot; and\r\n  when a decision is made to invalidate an election, to order a new election.Â  Id. Â§ 5-15-130.Â  Therefore, while the mayor and town council have the power to\r\n  appoint the election commissioners, the election commissioners have wide\r\n  discretion to determine the outcome of contested mayoral and town council\r\n  elections.Â  Additionally, the town council is charged with the duty of\r\n  employing a town manager and fixing his salary.Â  Id. Â§Â§ 5-13-30(1) &amp;\r\n  -50.Â  At the time of the town council election, Alice Graham (Commissioner\r\n  Graham), Linda Booker (Commissioner Booker), and Nicole Kenion (Commissioner\r\n  Kenion) sat on the MEC.Â  Commissioner Booker's husband, William Booker (Town\r\n  Manager), was the town manager.Â  Intervenors Josephine Isom and Charlene Taylor\r\n  were incumbent town councilmembers. \r\nAt some point in 2009, Price,\r\n  the head minister of the Atlantic Beach CME church, and Cole, former Atlantic\r\n  Beach town manager, decided to run as candidates in the upcoming town council\r\n  election.Â  Prior to their attempts to establish residency in Atlantic Beach,\r\n  Price lived in North Myrtle Beach and Cole lived in Florida.Â  On August 15,\r\n  2009, Price signed a lease agreement with Cole to move into an apartment\r\n  building in Atlantic Beach, owned in part by Cole.Â  This property had been\r\n  designated for demolition in March 2008.Â  The property managers subsequently\r\n  determined that it was more cost- effective to renovate the building, and Cole\r\n  wrote to Mr. Booker informing him of that decision.Â  Price's husband, a\r\n  contractor, began working to renovate the building in August 2009, with plans\r\n  to move in to the building on September 1.Â  On September 14, 2009, town council,\r\n  whose members included candidates in the upcoming town council election, Isom\r\n  and Taylor, passed an ordinance to have this property condemned.Â  On August 29,\r\n  2009, Town Manager wrote to Santee Cooper and requested that they turn off the\r\n  electricity in the building Cole and Price were renovating.Â  \r\nWith the plans to move\r\n  into the apartment building thwarted, Cole and Price moved in with Atlantic\r\n  Beach resident and former mayor, Retha Pierce.Â  In September 2009, Price\r\n  changed the address on her driver's license to Pierce's address and obtained a\r\n  voter registration card for the Atlantic Beach precinct using this address.Â  On\r\n  September 16, 2009, Commissioner Graham received a letter from Pierce's\r\n  landlord, Mr. Connie McCullough, stating he did not have a rental agreement\r\n  with Price and that Pierce's lease agreement prohibited her from allowing\r\n  anyone to live with her at his property.Â  In fact, Pierce's lease specifically\r\n  allowed up to two additional tenants.Â  Appellants allege that Commissioners\r\n  Graham and Booker and Town Manager sent Mr. McCullough the letter stating Price\r\n  was not permitted to live at his property, and Mr. McCullough signed the letter\r\n  upon their request without checking the lease.Â  Mr. McCullough subsequently\r\n  sent a letter to Commissioner Graham disavowing that letter and corroborating\r\n  the claim that Commissioner Graham sent him the letter with a request for him\r\n  to sign.Â Â Â  \r\nPrice timely filed a\r\n  Statement of Candidacy for Office of Councilmember with the Town of Atlantic\r\n  Beach on September 4, 2009.Â  On September 25, 2009,[3] Commissioner Graham informed Price by letter that she would not appear on the\r\n  election ballot because of her failure to submit a Statement of Economic\r\n  Interest Form to the State Ethics Commission, and for her failure to meet the\r\n  residency requirements for candidacy.[4]Â \r\n  Thereafter, Appellants Cole and Price campaigned for these seats as write-in\r\n  candidates. \r\nOn November 3, 2009, the Town\r\n  of Atlantic Beach held an election for the two positions on town council.Â \r\n  After the polls closed, there were 39 contested ballots.Â  The MEC held a\r\n  challenged ballot hearing on November 5, 2009, at 10:00 a.m., after which, 28\r\n  of the challenged ballots were accepted.Â  These accepted ballots included those\r\n  of Price and Cole.Â  At this hearing, the MEC announced the following vote\r\n  count: Windy Price (64), Carolyn Cole (52), Charlene Taylor (43), Josephine\r\n  Isom (35), and Paul Curry (5); thus, declaring Carolyn Cole and Windy Price as\r\n  the duly elected councilmembers for Atlantic Beach.Â  The MEC certified these\r\n  results after the close of the hearing.Â  The deadline for protesting the\r\n  results of this election, according to section 5-15-130 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code,[5] occurred at 7:00 p.m. on that same day, November 5, 2009.Â  Candidates Isom,\r\n  Taylor, and Curry submitted letters protesting the MEC's certification of the\r\n  election on the afternoon of November 5th.[6]Â  \r\nThe MEC conducted a protest\r\n  hearing on November 7th at 10:00 a.m. and adjourned that meeting, with a motion\r\n  to continue, at 10:03 a.m., before Appellants arrived.Â  The stated reason for\r\n  the continuance was to &quot;allow legal counsel to be present&quot; at the hearing.\r\nThe MEC conducted and then\r\n  continued the protest hearing on November 11th, and again on November 20th.Â  At\r\n  these hearings, the MEC heard testimony concerning the allegations raised in\r\n  Taylor, Isom, and Curry's letters of protest.Â  In pertinent part, these\r\n  candidates contested the election of Appellants on the grounds that Appellants\r\n  failed to meet the residency requirements to run as candidates, they violated\r\n  absentee voting laws, and voting irregularities merited overturning the\r\n  election.Â  \r\nAt the close of the November\r\n  20th hearing, Commissioners Graham and Booker voted to grant Isom and Taylor's\r\n  petitions for a new election, with Commissioner Kenion voting to deny.Â  On\r\n  November 30, 2009, Commissioner Kenion filed a dissent explaining the reasons\r\n  for her vote.Â  On that same day, Appellants appealed the MEC's decision to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  The MEC did not issue a written order until January 29, 2010.[7]Â \r\n  That order summarily found Appellants did not meet the residency requirements\r\n  of running for public office in Atlantic Beach, and that voting irregularities\r\n  and questionable absentee ballots rendered the results of the election\r\n  doubtful.Â  Thus, the MEC de-certified the election results and ordered a new\r\n  election.Â  The circuit court judge heard the appeal on May 19, 2010, and issued\r\n  a Form 4 order that same day affirming the decision of the MEC.Â  The circuit\r\n  court later granted Isom and Taylor's motions to intervene. Â This case is\r\n  before this Court on direct appeal from the circuit court, pursuant to Rule\r\n  203(d)(1)(A)(iv), SCACR. \r\nISSUES\r\nI. Whether the MEC's failure to comply\r\n  with the provisions of section 5-15-130 of the South Carolina Code requires this\r\n  Court to vacate its decision to de-certify and order a new election.\r\nII. Whether sufficient evidence exists\r\n  in the record to uphold the decision of the MEC.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Whether Commissioner Booker should\r\n  have recused herself from any deliberations concerning the election of town\r\n  council members.\r\nIV. Whether Intervenors failed to\r\n  strictly comply with the requirements of section 5-15-130 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code when protesting the election.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In municipal election cases, this\r\n  Court reviews the judgment of the circuit court upholding or overturning the\r\n  decision of a municipal election commission only to correct errors of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  George v. Mun. Election Comm'n of the City of Charleston,\r\n  335 S.C. 182, 186, 516 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1999).Â  This review only extends to\r\n  findings of fact when those findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  Id. (citations omitted).Â  &quot;The Court will employ every reasonable presumption\r\n  to sustain a contested election, and will not set aside an election due to mere\r\n  irregularities or illegalities unless the result is changed or rendered\r\n  doubtful.&quot; Â Id. (citations omitted).\r\nANALYSIS\r\n I.&nbsp;Failure to Comply with\r\n  Section 5-15-130 of the South Carolina Code\r\nAppellants argue this Court should vacate the MEC's\r\n  decision to de-certify and order a new election because the MEC failed to\r\n  comply with the requirements of section 5-15-130 of the South Carolina Code,\r\n  the statute that delineates the procedure for contesting results of a municipal\r\n  election.Â  We believe Respondent's complete disregard of the provisions of\r\n  section 5-15-130 was perpetuated by a conscious decision to ignore the will of\r\n  the voters, and this delay ultimately undermined the legislative purpose behind\r\n  requiring the expeditious handling of election disputes.Â  Therefore, we agree\r\n  with Appellants and vacate the decision of the MEC.Â  Accordingly, the MEC's initial\r\n  certification of the town council election, declaring Appellants Cole and Price\r\n  as winners, shall be restored. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Section 5-15-130 provides:\r\n\r\n  Within forty-eight hours after the filing of [a candidates'\r\n    protest] notice, the Municipal Election Commission shall, after due notice to\r\n    the parties concerned, conduct a hearing on the contest, decide the issues\r\n    raised, file its report together with all recorded testimony and exhibits with\r\n    the clerk of court of the county in which the municipality is situated, notify\r\n    the parties concerned of the decisions made, and when the decision invalidates\r\n    the election the council shall order a new election as to the parties\r\n    concerned.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-130 (1976).Â  \r\nThe MEC conducted a protest hearing within forty-eight\r\n  hours of the candidates filing protests, but that hearing lasted just three\r\n  minutes and was continued to proceed on November 11, 2009.Â  In fact, the MEC\r\n  adjourned the November 7th protest hearing before the arrival of Appellants.[8]Â \r\n  The MEC held a protest hearing on November 11, 2009, and concluded the hearing\r\n  on November 20, 2009.Â  It did not file a report of the hearing until January\r\n  29, 2010â€”more than two months after the protest hearing adjourned.Â  The MEC did\r\n  not produce a transcript of the proceedings until March 21, 2010.Â  Price's husband\r\n  (Mr. Price), by sworn affidavit, informed the circuit court that on November\r\n  27, 2009, he contacted the court reporter who transcribed the hearings in an\r\n  effort to procure the transcript.Â  She informed him that the MEC's attorney\r\n  told her not to give Mr. Price the transcript and that it would cost him $3,400\r\n  to procure it.Â  She also told him she did not plan to file a copy with the town\r\n  clerk once she completed the transcript and if he wanted a copy, he needed to\r\n  contact Commissioner Graham.Â  Without an official order from the MEC, and\r\n  without the transcript of the hearings, on November 30, 2009, Appellants\r\n  appealed the oral decision of the MEC. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-140\r\n  (1976) (a party aggrieved by the decision of the municipal election commission\r\n  has ten days after notice of the decision to appeal it to the circuit court).Â  The\r\n  MEC contends there was nearly twenty hours of testimony and it was impossible\r\n  to produce transcription within forty-eight hours.Â  Under normal circumstances,\r\n  we understand it would be unreasonable to expect the completion of such a\r\n  transcript within two days.Â  However, we find totally unworthy of belief the\r\n  MEC's excuse for the delay because as of January 7, 2010, nearly seven weeks\r\n  after the hearing adjourned, the MEC had yet to order the transcript.Â  Because\r\n  the circuit court had nothing on which to base its review, the circuit court\r\n  judge continued the hearing, upon the MEC's request, to May 17, 2010.Â  The\r\n  circuit court did not file its final order until September 28, 2010.Â  As a\r\n  result of the MEC's delay tactics, Intervenors Isom and Taylor have remained in\r\n  their town council seats as incumbents for nearly two additional years, pending\r\n  the disposition of the election dispute. \r\nThis Court recognizes that perfect compliance with an\r\n  election statute is, in many cases, unlikely. Therefore, we hesitate to vacate\r\n  a decision of a municipal election commission based on minor violations of\r\n  technical requirements.Â  In George\r\n    v. Municipal Election Commission of the City of Charleston, this Court set\r\n  forth guiding principles for determining whether the provisions of an election\r\n  statute are mandatory, or merely directory.Â  335 S.C. 182, 186, 516 S.E.2d 206,\r\n  208 (1999).Â  Generally, courts consider the provisions of election laws\r\n  mandatory when the statute expressly declares that a particular act is\r\n  essential to the validity of an election, or when a party seeks enforcement of\r\n  the law in a direct proceeding before the election takes place.Â  Id.Â  In\r\n  the interest of avoiding the disenfranchisement of voters after an election has\r\n  taken place, a statute that uses seemingly mandatory terms such as\r\n  &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;must,&quot; will be considered directory if the\r\n  party seeking enforcement alleges no fraud or if that party fails to prove\r\n  fraud. Â Id.Â  \r\n\r\n  Courts justly consider the main purpose of\r\n    such law, namely, the obtaining of a fair election and an honest return, as\r\n    paramount in importance to the minor requirements which prescribe the formal\r\n    steps to reach that end, and, in order not to defeat the general design, are\r\n    frequently led to ignore such innocent irregularities of election officers as\r\n    are free of fraud, and have not interfered with a full and fair expression of\r\n    the voter's choice. \r\n\r\nId. (quoting State ex rel. Parler v. Jennings, 79 S.C. 414,\r\n  419, 60 S.E. 967, 968-69 (1908)).Â  However, courts may deem statutory\r\n  provisions mandatory after an election when &quot;the provisions substantially\r\n  affect the free and intelligent casting of a vote, the determination of the\r\n  results, an essential element of the election, or the fundamental integrity of\r\n  the election.&quot;Â  Id. at 187, 516 S.E.2d at 208 (citing Zbinden v.\r\n    Bond County Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. No. 2, 2 Ill.2d 232, 117 N.E.2d 765, 767\r\n  (1954)).Â  \r\nSection 5-15-130 requires the municipal election commission\r\n  to take a number of actions within forty-eight hours of the candidates filing\r\n  protestsâ€”conduct a hearing, decide the issues, file a report that includes the\r\n  transcribed testimony and exhibits with the county clerk, notify the parties of\r\n  the decision, and order a new election, if necessary.Â  We believe the main\r\n  purpose of this law is to expeditiously finalize protested municipal elections\r\n  in the interest of realizing the voters' will and seamlessly transitioning\r\n  governmental offices. Therefore, insubstantial deviations from these provisions\r\n  would not ordinarily require this Court to nullify a protest hearing decision.Â \r\n  However, in this case, the MEC's startling disregard of the statute in no way merits\r\n  lenient application of the statute by this Court. Â The MEC's delay in ordering\r\n  the transcript and filing the final order was not just by a few hours, or even\r\n  days, but by several months.Â  During this time, the parties protesting the\r\n  electionâ€”Isom and Taylorâ€”remained in their town council positions.Â  We believe the delay was a direct attempt\r\n  by the MEC to interfere with the full and fair expression of the voters'\r\n  choice.Â  &quot;The Court . . . will not sanction practices which circumvent the\r\n  plain purposes of the law and open the door to fraud.&quot; Â May v. Wilson,\r\n  199 S.C. 354, 360, 19 S.E.2d 467, 470 (1942).Â  Therefore, we vacate the MEC's\r\n  decision to de-certify and order a new election, and conclude that the original\r\n  certification of the election, declaring Appellants Cole and Price as the winners,\r\n  should be restored.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn light of our holding in this case, we find it\r\n  unnecessary to address the additional issues argued by Appellants.Â  See\r\n    Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999).Â  However, if this Court were to reach these arguments,\r\n  this opinion would include facts no less astonishing than those thus far\r\n  relayed. We accompany this decision with strong admonishment of the MEC and\r\n  other involved parties, who worked diligently to obstruct the town council\r\n  election process.Â  The attempts by members of the MEC and the town manager to\r\n  prevent Cole and Price from establishing residency were deplorable.Â  The manner\r\n  in which the MEC conducted the protest hearings causes us great concern and makes\r\n  us question whether future election protests can be properly conducted in\r\n  Atlantic Beach without direct monitoring by the State Election Commission.Â  Nearly\r\n  every Atlantic Beach municipal election held in recent history has found its\r\n  way to this Court.Â  We have grown weary of the shenanigans engaged in by all\r\n  parties involved in the election process at Atlantic Beach, and will not\r\n  hesitate to issue sanctions if the election laws of this State continue to be\r\n  blatantly disregarded. Â For the forgoing reasons, we vacate the MEC's decision\r\n  to de-certify the election, and order the original certification of Appellants\r\n  Cole and Price as winners to be restored.Â  Accordingly, Cole and Price should\r\n  immediately begin serving in their capacities as town councilmembers upon\r\n  issuance of the remittitur in this case.Â  The ruling of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Armstrong v. Atlantic Beach Mun. Election\r\n  Comm'n, 380 S.C. 47, 668 S.E.2d 400 (2008) (finding the circuit court erred\r\n  by ordering the reopening of the filing period for candidacy for mayor because\r\n  that decision was based on facts not considered by the election commission when\r\n  it ordered a new election for the parties concerned); see also Taylor v.\r\n    Town of Atlantic Beach Election Comm'n, 363 S.C. 8, 609 S.E.2d 500 (2005)\r\n  (finding the Municipal Election Commission was not required to state findings\r\n  of fact and conclusions of law when rendering decisions, and holding that a\r\n  limited number of ballot secrecy violations did not give rise to a\r\n  constitutional violation sufficient to set aside the mayoral and town council\r\n  elections).\r\n[2] The Atlantic Beach Town Council is comprised of four\r\n  at-large council seats.\r\n[3] Commissioner Graham misdated the letter as October\r\n  25, 2009.\r\n[4] On September 25th, Price filed a Statement of\r\n  Economic Interest with the State Ethics Commission.Â  The Statement of Economic\r\n  Interest form states that the penalty for late filing is a fine of $100 per\r\n  day, rather than disqualification.Â  On October 1, 2009, Price filed a complaint\r\n  in circuit court against Commissioners Graham and Booker, Gary Baum of the\r\n  South Carolina Election Commission, and Atlantic Beach town clerk, Cheryl\r\n  Pereira, requesting the court to issue a temporary restraining order preventing\r\n  Defendants from removing her name from the November 3, 2009 town council\r\n  election ballot.Â  The circuit court dismissed the case on October 26, 2009 for\r\n  improper service and improper parties, but the court did not file the order\r\n  until January 20, 2010, well after the election. \r\n[5] &quot;Within forty-eight hours after the closing of\r\n  the polls, any candidate may contest the result of the election as reported by\r\n  the managers by filing a written notice of such contest together with a concise\r\n  statement of the grounds therefor with the Municipal Election Commission . . .\r\n  .&quot;\r\n[6] Appellants allege Isom and Taylor failed to\r\n  submit their protest letters before the 7:00 p.m. deadline.Â  Because we decide\r\n  this case on other grounds, we do not reach this issue.\r\n[7] Section 5-15-140 provides that a party aggrieved by a\r\n  decision of the municipal election commission has ten days after notice of the\r\n  decision to appeal it to circuit court. Id.

Thompson, of Thompson &amp; Henry, P.A., of\r\n          Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  Albert Epstein (&quot;Epstein&quot;) brought this\r\n  action for damages against Coastal Timber Co., Inc. (&quot;Coastal&quot;),\r\n  alleging Coastal cut and removed&nbsp;standing timber that was subject to mortgages\r\n  he held on the property.Â  The circuit court found Epstein failed to properly\r\n  secure an interest in the timber under South Carolina's Uniform Commercial Code\r\n  (&quot;UCC&quot;).&nbsp; Epstein appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\n In\r\n  March 2004, Epstein purchased real property in Horry County from TMAC Investors\r\n  IX, L.L.C. for $130,000.00.Â  The deed was recorded on April 19, 2004.Â  The\r\n  area, known as the old Conway Mill site, included just under 120 acres of land\r\n  and a building of 294,080 square feet.Â Â Â  \r\n In\r\n  May 2006, Epstein sold the property to Ascott Valley Development, L.L.C. for a\r\n  purchase price of $3.3 million.Â  Ascott was formed by Wynn Housel and Howard B.\r\n  Schwartz, who intended to develop the property for a residential neighborhood.Â \r\n  Their plans were to divide the acreage into two sections according to use:Â  (1)\r\n  the building and the 45 acres on which it stood would be used to manufacture\r\n  homes, and (2)&nbsp;the homes would be placed on the remaining wooded portion\r\n  of the property that measured a little over 70 acres.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  part of the sales arrangement, Epstein provided 100% owner financing.Â  Ascott\r\n  executed two mortgages and two notes in favor of Epstein, using the property as\r\n  collateral.Â  The deed and mortgages were signed on May 25, 2006 and filed on\r\n  June 1, 2006.Â  According to Epstein, he took two mortgages to better secure\r\n  Ascott's obligationsâ€”a $2.0 million note secured with a mortgage on the 45\r\n  acres, and a $1.3 million note secured by a mortgage on the remaining 70-plus\r\n  acres.Â  The sum of the two mortgages on the property thus equaled the $3.3\r\n  million purchase price.\r\nOn\r\n  June 6, 2006, Ascott executed a &quot;Timber Title&quot; conveying to Coastal\r\n  for $115,000.00 all merchantable pine timber and all merchantable hardwood of\r\n  14 inches &quot;across stump or larger&quot; located on the property.Â  The\r\n  document called for the timber to be removed within twelve months.Â  Coastal,\r\n  the purchaser, recorded the Timber Title documenting the sale on June 12, 2006\r\n  in the Office of the Horry County Register of Deeds.Â  Coastal thereafter cut\r\n  and removed the timber and paid Ascott the full proceeds.Â  \r\nAscott\r\n  subsequently defaulted on its obligations to Epstein, who brought foreclosure\r\n  proceedings.Â  During this process, Epstein learned of the removal of the\r\n  timber.Â  \r\n On\r\n  April 22, 2009, while the foreclosure against Ascott was still pending,[1] Epstein filed\r\n  the current action against Coastal, alleging the timber was cut without his\r\n  knowledge or permission and that he had received no portion of the proceeds.Â \r\n  Epstein asserted his recorded mortgages constituted notice to all parties that\r\n  he had a lien upon timber on the property, and that his lien was &quot;superior\r\n  in priority&quot; to the Timber Title and had not been released or waived. Â Epstein\r\n  sought damages for the actual value of the timber removed and the diminution of\r\n  the property's fair market value caused by the removal of timber.Â  He also\r\n  sought clean-up costs, treble damages, post-judgment interest, and\r\n  &quot;further relief as may be just and proper.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nCoastal answered and denied liability, asserting\r\n  Ascott was the owner of the property, that it had paid Ascott for the full\r\n  value of the timber cut, and there was no agreement between Coastal and Ascott\r\n  that would permit it to withhold the sales proceeds from Ascott.Â  Coastal also\r\n  stated Epstein had &quot;assumed the risk that timber on the subject property\r\n  would be cut and sold when he failed to properly secure the timber as\r\n  collateral, either through the form of his mortgage or through the use of a\r\n  security agreement and financing statement.&quot;Â  \r\nCoastal thereafter moved for summary judgment,\r\n  asserting South Carolina's UCC now provides that a contract for the sale of\r\n  standing timber is a sale of goods, not realty, and that Epstein's two\r\n  mortgages do not cover the timber because they do not meet UCC requirements for\r\n  creating a security interest.Â  Specifically, the mortgages do not provide a\r\n  description of the collateral as being standing timber or timber to be cut. \r\nEpstein moved for partial summary judgment, arguing\r\n  the timber was encumbered by his mortgages because the timber was not expressly\r\n  excluded.Â  Epstein argued, &quot;It is black letter law that standing timber is\r\n  a part of real property until it is severed.&quot; \r\nThe circuit court granted Coastal's motion for summary\r\n  judgment and denied Epstein's motion.Â  The circuit court found the UCC was\r\n  controlling and that Epstein's mortgages did not meet the requirements to\r\n  maintain a security interest in the timber under the UCC.Â  Epstein made a Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP motion, which was denied.Â  \r\nEpstein appealed to the Court of Appeals.Â  This Court\r\n  issued an order certifying the case for its review pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\n  SCACR.Â  \r\nII.Â  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  trial court may grant a party's motion for summary judgment &quot;if the\r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.&quot;Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\nIn\r\n  determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the trial court must view\r\n  the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the\r\n  light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer\r\n    Senior Servs. &amp; Rehab. Ctr., 386 S.C. 108, 687 S.E.2d 29 (2009).Â  An\r\n  appellate court applies the same standard used by the trial court under Rule\r\n  56(c) when reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment.Â  Id.\r\nIII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Epstein argues the circuit court erred in\r\n  granting summary judgment to Coastal after finding his mortgages did not\r\n  constitute a lien on the standing timber cut by Coastal.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  South Carolina, standing timber has historically been defined as &quot;a part\r\n  of the realty, as much so as the soil itself.&quot;Â  First Carolinas Joint\r\n    Stock Land Bank of Columbia v. N.Y. Title &amp; Mortgage Co., 172 S.C. 446,\r\n  450, 174 S.E. 406, 408 (1934) (citation omitted); see also D.W.\r\n    Alderman &amp; Sons Co. v. Kirven, 209 S.C. 446, 455, 40 S.E.2d 791, 794\r\n  (1946) (&quot;We have held . . . that trees growing upon lands are a part of\r\n  the realty, and continue to be realty until severed from the soil.&quot;).Â \r\n  &quot;The conveyance of timber land without reservation or exception of timber\r\n  carries the timber.&quot;Â  First Carolinas, 172 S.C. at 450, 174 S.E. at\r\n  408 (citation omitted).Â  \r\nThe mortgagor of land is the owner in fee and has\r\n  title to the land so mortgaged, but the mortgagee has a lien upon the land to\r\n  secure his debt.Â  Simms v. Kearse, 42 S.C. 43, 20 S.E. 19 (1894); see\r\n    also S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;29-3-10 (2007) (stating &quot;the mortgagor\r\n  shall be deemed the owner of the land and the mortgagee as owner of the money\r\n  lent or due&quot;).Â  A mortgage on real property includes the standing timber\r\n  unless it has been excepted from the mortgage.Â  See First Carolinas,\r\n  172 S.C. at 450, 174 S.E. at 407-08 (&quot;Growing timber constitutes a portion\r\n  of the realty embraced by a mortgage on the land unless expressly or impliedly\r\n  excepted.&quot; (citation omitted)); see also 59 C.J.S. Mortgages Â§&nbsp;236 (2009) (&quot;As a general rule, crops, timber, and nursery stock\r\n  growing on mortgaged land are covered by the mortgage unless expressly or\r\n  impliedly excepted therefrom.&quot;).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court, while recognizing these general principles, found the South\r\n  Carolina cases classifying timber as realty predated the 1988 amendment to section\r\n  36-2-107 in the UCC, particularly subsection&nbsp;&nbsp;(2), which the court\r\n  found &quot;transformed timber from realty to goods.&quot;Â  Section 36-2-107\r\n  provides in full as follows:\r\n\r\n  Â§ 36-2-107.Â  Goods to be severed from\r\n    realty; recording.\r\n   (1) A contract for the sale of minerals or\r\n      the like (including oil and gas) or a structure or its materials to be removed\r\n      from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter if they are\r\n      to be severed by the seller, but until severance, a purported present sale, which\r\n      is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land, is effective only as a\r\n      contract to sell.\r\n   (2) A contract for the sale apart from\r\n      the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of\r\n      severance without material harm thereto but not described in subsection (1) or of\r\n        timber to be cut is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter\r\n      whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even\r\n        though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties\r\n        can by identification effect a present sale before severance.\r\n  (3) The provisions of this section are subject to any\r\n      third-party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the\r\n      contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an\r\n      interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the\r\n      buyer's rights under the contract for sale.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-107 (2003) (emphasis added).Â  The South Carolina Reporter's Comments\r\n  following section 36-2-107 explain the purpose for the 1988 revision of the statute\r\n  was to facilitate the financing of timber transactions and to provide a method\r\n  for noticing the sale in the real estate records:\r\n\r\n  Several timber-growing states changed the 1962 Text to\r\n    make timber to be cut under a contract of severance qualify as goods,\r\n    regardless of the question who is to sever them.Â  The section is revised to\r\n    adopt this change.Â  Financing of the transaction is facilitated if the\r\n    timber is treated as goods instead of real estate.Â  A similar change is made in\r\n    the definition of &quot;goods&quot; in Section 9-105 of the 1988 UCC\r\n    Amendments.Â  To protect persons dealing with timberlands, filing on timber\r\n      to be cut is required . . . to be made in real estate records in a manner\r\n      comparable to fixture filing.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Reporter's Comments to section 36-2-107, Note to 1988 Amendment (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court concluded &quot;the 1988 amendment to South Carolina's Uniform\r\n  Commercial Code converted standing timber from real property to personal\r\n  property and requires that it be treated as a sale of goods and secured as\r\n  such.&quot;Â  The circuit court stated additional support for this conclusion is\r\n  found in the definition of &quot;goods&quot; in section 36-9-102.Â  This section\r\n  provides in relevant part:Â  &quot;The term [goods] includes . . . standing\r\n  timber that is to be cut and removed under a conveyance or contract for sale .\r\n  . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-102(a)(44) (2003). \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court further observed that to be valid and enforceable, section\r\n  36-9-203 of the UCC requires a security interest in timber to be cut under a\r\n  contract of sale to be evidenced by a security agreement that is authenticated\r\n  and contains a description of the collateral.Â  See id. Â§ 36-9-203(b)(1),\r\n  (2) &amp; (3)(A) (stating a security interest is enforceable only if (1)&nbsp;&quot;value\r\n  has been given,&quot; (2) &quot;the debtor has rights in the collateral or the\r\n  power to transfer rights in the collateral to a secured party,&quot; and (3)\r\n  &quot;the debtor has authenticated a security agreement that provides a\r\n  description of the collateral and, if the security interest covers timber to\r\n    be cut, a description of the land concerned&quot; (emphasis added)).\r\nIn addition, the circuit court noted that section\r\n  36-9-502 of the UCC &quot;provides two methods by which a security interest in\r\n  timber can be perfected[;] one is by filing a financing statement that\r\n  specifies that the collateral covered is timber and the other is by filing [] a\r\n  Mortgage that meets the requirements of [a] financing statement and specifies\r\n  the goods that it covers.&quot;Â  See id. Â§ 36-9-502 (setting\r\n  forth UCC requirements for financing statements covering goods).Â  \r\nThe circuit court found none of the documents\r\n  submitted to the court included a financing statement, and Epstein's mortgages\r\n  contained no language specifically identifying the timber.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  mortgages on the property did not secure Epstein's interest in the timber since\r\n  they did not meet the UCC requirements.Â  The circuit court stated although\r\n  Epstein did present case law identifying timber as realty, all of the cases\r\n  predated the 1988 amendment to the UCC.Â  For these reasons, the circuit court\r\n  granted Coastal's motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nEpstein filed a Rule 59 motion, asserting the circuit\r\n  court had misinterpreted the UCC provisions.Â  Epstein argued the provisions\r\n  cited by the circuit court identifying timber as &quot;goods&quot; all refer to\r\n  standing timber to be cut under a contract of sale and that the UCC did not\r\n  convert all standing timber into &quot;goods.&quot;Â  Since standing timber\r\n  remains real estate, it is subject to being encumbered by a mortgage.Â  He\r\n  maintained the Reporter's Comments to section 36-2-107 state the main purpose\r\n  of the 1988 amendment is to facilitate the financing of timber to be cut under\r\n  a contract of sale.Â  Epstein's Rule 59 motion was denied.Â  On appeal, Epstein\r\n  asks this Court to reverse the order granting summary judgment to Coastal on\r\n  the basis his mortgage on the real property included the timber.\r\n&quot;The cardinal rule of statutory construction is\r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.&quot;Â  Media Gen. Commc'ns, Inc. v.\r\n    S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 388 S.C. 138, 147-48, 694 S.E.2d 525, 529&nbsp;(2010)\r\n  (quoting Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd.,\r\n  313 S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993)).Â  &quot;The determination of legislative\r\n  intent is a matter of law.&quot;Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  Where a\r\n  statute's language is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite\r\n  meaning, the court has no right to impose another meaning.Â  Id. at 148,\r\n  694 S.E.2d at 530.\r\nStatutes in derogation of the common law are strictly\r\n  construed.Â  Standard v.

Co., 267 S.C. 517, 229 S.E.2d 849 (1976).Â  &quot;Where no\r\n  conflict with common law exists, however, this Court will not substitute its\r\n  view of public policy for that of the legislature.&quot;Â  Standard, 278\r\n  S.C. at 340, 295 S.E.2d at 788.\r\nStatutory language must be read in a sense that harmonizes with\r\n  its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.Â  Cox v. BellSouth\r\n    Telecomms., 356 S.C. 468, 589 S.E.2d 766 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Words in a\r\n  statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to\r\n  subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statute's application.Â  Id.\r\nThe parties point to no South Carolina case examining\r\n  the relationship between these UCC statutory provisions and existing real\r\n  estate law.Â  However, we conclude the UCC can be read in harmony with the\r\n  common law so as to give full effect to each.\r\nWe find the UCC provisions recited by the circuit\r\n  court[2] pertain specifically to timber to be cut under a contract of sale.Â  The\r\n  purpose of the UCC amendment was, as noted above, to facilitate the financing\r\n  of a transaction to purchase timber by treating timber to be cut under a\r\n  contract of sale as a sale of goods, even though the timber is still attached\r\n  to the land, and to provide a method for a purchaser to document a security\r\n  interest in such timber under contract.Â  The UCC requires a party to include a specific\r\n  description of the collateral and the real property in this instance in order\r\n  to identify the timber under contract and provide adequate notice to other\r\n  parties of the declared interest.Â  \r\nWe agree with Epstein that section 36-2-107(2) did not\r\n  convert all standing timber to goods and thereby divest him of his interest in\r\n  the timber.Â  This section and the related UCC provisions do not cancel the\r\n  effect of a mortgage or lien on timber that is already recorded in the real\r\n  estate records.Â  Rather, any security interest later recorded on timber to be\r\n  cut under a contract of sale would be junior to any existing interests.Â  To\r\n  hold otherwise would allow a mortgagor to unilaterally void an existing lien\r\n  imposed by a mortgage on the real property, which includes the timber, simply\r\n  by thereafter executing a contract to sell the timber.\r\nSupport for this interpretation is found in section\r\n  36-2-107 of the UCC itself, which states in subsection (3):Â  &quot;The\r\n  provisions of this section [36-2-107] are subject to any third-party rights\r\n  provided by the law relating to realty records . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  36-2-107(3).Â  Thus, on its face, the UCC expressly recognizes the need to\r\n  harmonize with existing real estate records, such as interests in the property\r\n  that have already been recorded.Â  \r\nEpstein's mortgage was sufficient under the common law\r\n  to secure a lien on the property, including the timber, and he was not required\r\n  to satisfy the UCC requirements as found by the circuit court.Â  Those\r\n  requirements were relevant only to those seeking to secure their interest in\r\n  the timber to be cut under a contract of sale, and such interests would be\r\n  subject to Epstein's previously-recorded interest.\r\nIn a similar case, Feliciana Bank &amp; Trust v.\r\n  Manuel &amp; Sessions, L.L.C., 943 So. 2d 736 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), the\r\n  plaintiff, a bank, brought an action for damages after standing timber was sold\r\n  and removed from land on which it held a deed of trust.[3]Â  Id. at 737.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals of Mississippi reversed the grant of summary judgment to the\r\n  defendant and found the plaintiff's deed of trust was sufficient to provide a\r\n  security interest in the timber.Â  Id. at 739.Â  The court rejected the\r\n  defendant's argument that no perfected security interest existed because the\r\n  plaintiff did not make a filing in accordance with the UCC, which now recognizes\r\n  contracts for the sale of timber to be cut as a sale of goods.Â  Id. at\r\n  738-39.\r\nIn evaluating the effect of the UCC changes in timber\r\n  to be cut relative to the common law pertaining to real property, the court\r\n  &quot;conclude[d] that the proper analysis is not one of cancellation but of\r\n  priority.&quot;Â  Id. at 740.Â  The court held the bank had a security\r\n  interest in the timber and the rights of any subsequent purchasers of the\r\n  timber were subordinate to the bank's interest.Â  Id.Â  The court noted\r\n  that &quot;[t]he bank's failure to perfect its interests under the UCC was\r\n  irrelevant to its right to remain secure.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching this result, the court explained that the changes in the UCC did not\r\n  displace the common law regarding securing interests in timber:\r\n\r\n  The trial court in essence concluded that the\r\n    Mississippi commercial code displaced the common law on the securing of\r\n    interests on timber.Â  Under that\r\n    view, either a deed of trust no longer applies to timber at all, or the\r\n    security is lost as soon as a conveyance or contract for sale of timber\r\n    occurs.Â  The legislature has certainly defined standing timber as personal\r\n    property upon the execution of a contract for its cutting.Â  Someone involved in\r\n    that cutting may make a UCC filing to secure the interest that has been\r\n    obtained.Â  Prior to such a contract, though, the UCC does not cause timber\r\n      to be classified as &quot;goods.&quot;Â  Absent any statutory forcing of a\r\n    change in the common law, the timber prior to a contract for its cutting would\r\n    remain real property.Â  The UCC does not purport to cancel the reach of a\r\n    pre-existing deed of trust which at least would secure timber that is not\r\n    subject to a contract for harvesting.Â  Consequently, the most the UCC would\r\n    have done is cancel the lien of a deed of trust as soon as a contract for a\r\n    timber sale occurs.Â  If cancellation is the result of the Code, there would be\r\n    no lasting security over timber created by a deed of trust.\r\n  We conclude that the proper analysis is\r\n    not one of cancellation but of priority.Â  Historically, a deed of trust\r\n    granted a security interest in all property that was part of the realty.Â  Under\r\n    the UCC, though, if a typical deed of trust is executed after a contract for\r\n    the cutting of the timber has been executed but before the actual harvesting of\r\n    the trees, the deed of trust will either not apply to the timber at all because\r\n    the timber is now personalty, or else the deed of trust will be subordinate to\r\n    a prior UCC filing.Â  Conversely, if the deed of trust predates any contract\r\n      to cut the timber, the security interest vests in timber and cannot be divested\r\n      simply by a contract for sale.Â  Again, the matter is one of priority. . .\r\n    .Â  [T]he previously quoted section on sales relating to timber recognizes the\r\n    continuing effect of real property rules when it states that timber sales under\r\n    the UCC &quot;are subject to any third party rights provided by law relating to\r\n    realty records . . . .&quot;Â  Miss.Code Ann. Â§ 75-2-107(3). \r\n\r\nId. at 739-40 (emphasis added).\r\nWe find the reasoning in the Feliciana Bank case is sound.Â  Based on the foregoing, we hold the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding Epstein was divested of his security interest in the timber based on the\r\n  UCC.Â  The UCC changes did not effect a wholesale cancellation of existing real\r\n  estate law in South Carolina and did not convert all standing timber to\r\n  &quot;goods.&quot;Â  At the time Epstein's mortgages were executed and recorded,\r\n  they secured his interest in the real property, including the standing timber,\r\n  and this interest vested before there ever was a contract to cut the timber.Â \r\n  Thus, Epstein's mortgages secured a lien on the property as well as the timber\r\n  and any subsequent interests are subordinate.Â  This result is not in conflict\r\n  with, but in harmony with, the UCC provisions.Â  \r\nIV.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the circuit court erred in finding Epstein's\r\n  mortgages were insufficient to secure a lien on the timber for the subject\r\n  property and that he was required to meet the UCC requirements.Â  The UCC\r\n  requirements pertain to securing an interest in timber to be cut under a\r\n  contract of sale, and these interests are subject to liens already noticed in\r\n  the real estate records.Â  Consequently, we reverse the circuit court's order\r\n  granting summary judgment to Coastal and remand the matter for further\r\n  proceedings.[4]Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  The foreclosure action against Ascott was eventually resolved by Epstein\r\n  obtaining a deficiency judgment against Ascott for $305,000.00.Â  Coastal\r\n  alludes to the possibility of a double recovery, but there is nothing in the\r\n  record to establish whether Epstein actually recovered on the judgment;\r\n  further, any allegation in this regard is best considered by a trial court in\r\n  the first instance.\r\n[2]Â \r\n  Sections 36-2-107(2) (recording contracts for the sale of goods to be severed\r\n  from realty, including contracts for the sale of timber to be cut), 36-9-102(a)(44)\r\n  (defining &quot;goods&quot; to include timber to be cut under a contract of\r\n  sale), 36-9-203 (security interests in timber to be cut and as-extracted\r\n  collateral), 36-9-502 (financing statements for timber to be cut and\r\n  as-extracted collateral).Â  \r\n[3] &quot;A deed of trust is a security interest in property, similar to a\r\n  mortgage.&quot;Â  Manios v.

Ozmint, 367 S.C. 547, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 878 (2006) (Nance II).Â  \r\nMr. Fraley survived Respondent's attack in 1993 and\r\n  testified at the first trial but is now deceased.Â  Respondent argues that,\r\n  because in Nance II this Court found he received ineffective assistance\r\n  of counsel due to defense counsel's failure to subject the State's case to\r\n  meaningful adversarial testing, he lacked the opportunity to cross-examine Mr.\r\n  Fraley as required by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the\r\n  United States Constitution.Â  Therefore, Respondent argues, the State may not\r\n  read Mr. Fraley's testimony into the record as an unavailable witness under\r\n  Rule 804, SCRE, because it would violate his constitutional right to confront\r\n  witnesses against him.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n The\r\n  following are the facts as developed during Respondent's first trial.Â  One very\r\n  early November morning in 1993, Respondent knocked on the Fraleys' door,\r\n  rousing the elderly Mr. Fraley and Violet Fraley, his wife of forty-three\r\n  years, from bed.Â  When Mr. Fraley answered the door, Respondent called Mr. Fraley\r\n  by name, told him he had car trouble, and asked to use the Fraleys' telephone.Â \r\n  Mr. Fraley, unaware that Respondent had cut the phone lines before knocking,\r\n  told Respondent he could use the phone in his detached workshop.Â  As Mr. Fraley\r\n  began opening the door to hand Respondent a flashlight to light his way to the\r\n  workshop, Respondent yanked the door open and repeatedly stabbed Mr. Fraley\r\n  with a screwdriver as the two men struggled through the house and into the\r\n  kitchen.Â  \r\nAfter Mrs. Fraley, who had come out of her bedroom\r\n  during the scuffle, gave Respondent her purse and car keys, he repeatedly raped\r\n  her on the kitchen floor as Mr. Fraley slumped in a nearby chair, conscious and\r\n  bleeding.Â  Respondent then stabbed Mrs. Fraley in the chest, killing her, and stabbed\r\n  Mr. Fraley one final time before violating Mrs. Fraley again.Â  Respondent\r\n  finally stole the Fraleys' car and left.\r\nMiraculously,\r\n  Mr. Fraley was able to drag himself to another vehicle, drive to a neighbor's\r\n  house, and contact the authorities.Â  Police officers arrested Respondent later\r\n  that morning, driving the stolen car[1] and covered in Mrs. Fraley's blood.Â  Mr. Fraley testified at trial, and defense\r\n  counsel did not cross-examine him.Â  In addition to Mr. Fraley's testimony, the\r\n  State presented physical evidence linking Respondent to the crimes.[2]Â \r\n  The jury found Respondent guilty of murder, first degree criminal sexual\r\n  conduct, first degree burglary, assault and battery with intent to kill, and\r\n  armed robbery.Â  He was sentenced to death on the murder charge, and received an\r\n  assortment of sentences for the other charges.Â  \r\nThis Court affirmed his convictions and sentences on\r\n  direct appeal.Â  State v. Nance, 320 S.C. 501, 466 S.E.2d 349 (1996).Â \r\n  Respondent filed an application for PCR, which was granted by this Court in Nance\r\n    v. Frederick, 358 S.C. 480, 596 S.E.2d 62 (2004) (Nance I), presuming\r\n  prejudice under United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984) because\r\n  defense counsel failed to challenge the prosecution's case.Â  The United States\r\n  Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated Nance I, and remanded for\r\n  consideration in light of Florida v. Nixon, 540 U.S. 1217 (2004), which\r\n  explained the Cronic presumption is rare and reserved for cases in which\r\n  counsel fails to meaningfully oppose the prosecution's case.Â  This Court again\r\n  granted Respondent's PCR request, holding &quot;there was a total breakdown in\r\n  the adversarial process during both the guilt phase and the penalty phase of\r\n  [Respondent's] trial.&quot;Â  Nance II, 367 S.C. at 555, 626 S.E.2d at\r\n  882.Â  This Court awarded Respondent a new trial, and the current appeal stems from\r\n  this new trial.Â  Mr. Fraley is now deceased, and the State intended to read his\r\n  sworn testimony from the first trial into the record during the current trial.Â \r\n  Respondent moved to suppress the testimony, arguing the introduction of the\r\n  prior testimony would violate his rights under the Confrontation Clause because\r\n  Respondent lacked the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Fraley during the first\r\n  trial.Â  The trial court granted Respondent's motion, and this appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n In\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006). Â Â This same\r\n  standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the\r\n  admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  State v. Wilson,\r\n  345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  Â \r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the trial court erred in finding a violation of the Confrontation\r\n  Clause would occur if Mr. Fraley's prior testimony were introduced in the\r\n  current trial.Â  We agree.\r\n Rule\r\n  804 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence states that an unavailable\r\n  declarant's former testimony may be admitted at a later trial if the party\r\n  against whom the testimony is offered had the &quot;opportunity and similar\r\n  motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect\r\n  examination.&quot;Â  Rule 804(b)(1), SCRE.Â  This is the rule under which the\r\n  State wishes to introduce Mr. Fraley's prior testimony.Â  As we understand the\r\n  Record and the briefs, Mr. Fraley's unavailability is not in issue, nor is\r\n  Respondent's motive in developing the testimony.Â  The sole issue is whether\r\n  Respondent had the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Fraley at the prior trial.\r\nThe\r\n  accused's opportunity to cross-examine a witness against him is protected by\r\n  the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States\r\n  Constitution.Â  As we explained in State v. Stokes, confrontation\r\n  &quot;(1) insures the witness will give his statement under oath . . . ; (2)\r\n  forces the witness to submit to cross-examination . . . ; and (3) permits the\r\n  jury that is to decide the defendant's fate to observe the demeanor of the\r\n  witness in making his statement . . . .&quot; 381 S.C. 390, 401, 673 S.E.2d\r\n  434, 439 (2009) (quoting California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149\r\n  (1970)).Â  The Confrontation Clause &quot;guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in\r\n  whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.&quot;Â  Id. at 401-02, 673 S.E.2d at 439 (quoting United States v. Owens, 484\r\n  U.S. 554, 559, 108 S. Ct. 838 (1988)) (emphasis in original).Â  Therefore, if a\r\n  defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine a witness, there is no violation\r\n  of the Confrontation Clause.\r\nRespondent\r\n  argues that he was not provided with an opportunity for cross-examination of\r\n  Mr. Fraley at the first trial because of his trial counsel's ineffectiveness.Â \r\n  At the first trial, trial counsel's strategy was to not challenge guilt, but\r\n  rather to establish Respondent's mental illness. Â In Nance II, this\r\n  Court found Respondent did not receive effective assistance of counsel, and\r\n  that he should be awarded a new trial.Â  In so holding, this Court found there\r\n  was &quot;a total breakdown in the adversarial process during both the guilt\r\n  phase and the penalty phase&quot; of the trial, noting eight specific reasons\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective in acting as an adversary to the State. 367 S.C.\r\n  at 555, 626 S.E.2d at 882.Â  First, we found Respondent was disadvantaged\r\n  because lead counsel was ill and taking medication, and co-counsel had only\r\n  been practicing law for 18 months.Â  Second, trial counsel wanted Respondent to\r\n  appear in the courtroom unmedicated, but failed to inform the jail personnel.Â \r\n  As a result of that failing, Respondent continued taking his prescribed Haldol\r\n  throughout the trial.Â  Third, during his opening argument, co-counsel told the\r\n  jury that neither he nor lead counsel chose to represent Respondent, but had\r\n  been appointed.Â  Fourth, defense counsel failed to present adequately the\r\n  evidence necessary to establish a guilty but mentally ill defense.Â  Counsel did\r\n  not qualify their own expert, and elicited testimony concerning Respondent's\r\n  mental irregularities only after the expert had testified.Â  Fifth, counsel\r\n  presented no adaptability evidence at sentencing.Â  Instead, the only evidence\r\n  presented concerning Respondent's confinement was that he threw urine at a\r\n  corrections officer.Â  Sixth, counsel presented no mitigating social history at\r\n  trial, though extensive evidence would have been available upon investigation.Â \r\n  Seventh, the paltry mitigation presentation failed to provide any insight into\r\n  Respondent's mental health.Â  Finally, in closing argument, defense counsel\r\n  called Respondent &quot;a sick man who did sick things.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  555-57, 626 S.E.2d at 882-83.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court judge in the current trial suppressed Mr. Fraley's testimony from\r\n  the first trial, stating &quot;[n]o more glaring deficiency exists than with\r\n  Mr. Fraley's testimony&quot; because &quot;the only eye witness&quot; was not\r\n  cross- examined.Â  The circuit court judge repeatedly focused on the lack of\r\n  adversarial confrontation of Mr. Fraley.Â  We find the circuit court judge\r\n  placed unnecessary emphasis on the lack of cross-examination and failed to\r\n  consider the valid overall trial strategy of not contesting guilt.\r\n In Florida v. Nixon, a PCR appeal, the United States Supreme Court\r\n  explained that defense counsel's decision not to test the prosecution's case is\r\n  not always presumed ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  543 U.S. 175 (2004). Â The\r\n  circumstances in this case are similar to those in Nixon.Â  The criminal\r\n  defendant in Nixon was charged with the kidnapping and gruesome murder\r\n  of a stranger he approached for help in mall parking lot.Â  Id. at\r\n  179-80. Â At trial, defense counsel conceded the defendant's guilt and did not\r\n  present a guilt phase defense, knowing the prosecution would submit\r\n  overwhelming evidence of guilt of a very violent and shocking crime.Â  Id. at 180-81.Â  Instead, defense counsel focused on presenting mitigating evidence\r\n  during the penalty phase to establish the defendant's mental infirmities in a\r\n  bid to save the defendant from the death penalty.Â  The defendant was convicted\r\n  of murder and, despite defense counsel's efforts, received the death penalty.Â  Id. at 184.Â  On PCR, the defendant argued his counsel was ineffective for conceding\r\n  guilt without his express consent.Â  The Supreme Court recognized that although\r\n  under Cronic, prejudice is presumed when counsel does not subject the\r\n  prosecution's case to a &quot;meaningful adversarial testing,&quot; defense\r\n  counsel may validly choose to focus on the sentencing phase of a capital case\r\n  and not contest guilt:\r\n\r\n  . . . [Defense counsel's] concession of Nixon's guilt\r\n    does not rank as a &quot;failure to function in any meaningful sense as the\r\n    Government's adversary.&quot;Â  Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine\r\n    (sic) trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential\r\n    sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding's two-phase structure vitally\r\n    affect counsel's strategic calculus.Â  Attorneys representing capital defendants\r\n    face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the\r\n    defendant's guilt is often clear.Â  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the\r\n    death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the\r\n    evidence is overwhelming and the crime is heinous.Â  In such cases, &quot;avoiding\r\n    execution may be the best and only realistic result possible.&quot;\r\n  Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to\r\n    focus on the trial's penalty phase, at which time counsel's mission is to\r\n    persuade the trier that his client's life should be spared.\r\n\r\nNixon, 543 at 190-91 (citations omitted).\r\nHere, Respondent argues he was deprived of his Sixth\r\n  Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel during the first trial, and\r\n  that introducing Mr. Fraley's testimony from the first trial into the second\r\n  will perpetuate the constitutional infirmities.Â  At the PCR hearing, defense\r\n  counsel explained the decision not to cross-examine Mr. Fraley was based upon\r\n  the overall trial strategy to concede guilt and attempt to establish\r\n  Respondent's mental illness at the time of the crimes.Â  Defense counsel\r\n  testified that in light of the decision to focus on mitigation, nothing could\r\n  be gained from antagonizing a sympathetic witness who had just given graphic\r\n  and highly emotional testimony.Â  We find the behavior Respondent complains of\r\n  falls under Nixon as a valid, articulated strategic decision to focus on\r\n  saving Respondent from a death penalty rather than futilely contesting guilt in\r\n  the face of the prosecution's overwhelming evidence.Â  Defense counsel's\r\n  decision not to cross-examine Mr. Fraley was reasonable and did not amount to\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  See Watson v. State, 370 S.C. 68,\r\n  72, 634 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2006) (&quot;[W]here counsel articulates a valid\r\n  reason for employing a certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.&quot;); Stokes v. State, 308 S.C.\r\n  546, 548, 419 S.E.2d 778, 779 (1992).Â  As previously explained in Nance II,\r\n  we found eight specific grounds on which to base our finding of ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel.Â  None of those grounds concerned defense counsel's\r\n  decision not to cross-examine Mr. Fraley.Â  Defense counsel's ineffectiveness\r\n  was not in choosing not to cross-examine Mr. Fraley, or otherwise test the\r\n  prosecution's case during the guilt phase, but rather was in failing to\r\n  adequately present a mitigation case during sentencing.Â  The decision to allow\r\n  Mr. Fraley to leave the witness stand without cross-examination was a reasonable\r\n  strategy often employed in capital cases.Â  That defense counsel was\r\n  unsuccessful at mitigating during the penalty phase does not negate the\r\n  reasonableness of the approach to the guilt phase of the trial.\r\nDuring\r\n  the first trial, Mr. Fraley was sworn, on the witness stand, and Respondent had\r\n  the opportunity to cross-examine him as required by the Sixth Amendment.Â \r\n  Therefore, we find defense counsel's strategic decision not to cross-examine\r\n  Mr. Fraley was reasonable in light of Florida v. Nixon and did not give\r\n  rise to a Confrontation Clause violation.Â  See Stokes, 381 S.C. at 402,\r\n  673 S.E.2d at 440.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the above reasons, we find the circuit court erred in suppressing Mr. Fraley's\r\n  testimony.Â  As allowing the State to introduce Mr. Fraley's prior sworn\r\n  testimony injects no constitutional infirmity into the trial, the circuit court\r\n  is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES,\r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Our scope of review is\r\n  limited to determining whether the trial court's decision to suppress the prior\r\n  testimony was an abuse of discretion, that is, to determine whether that ruling\r\n  was without evidentiary support or controlled by an error of law.Â  State v.\r\n    Wright, 391 S.C. 436, 706 S.E.2d 324 (2011).Â  Finding no abuse here, I\r\n  would affirm.\r\n In Nance v.\r\n  Ozmint, 367 S.C. 547, 626 S.E.2d 878 (2006) (Nance), we granted\r\n  respondent post-conviction relief (PCR), citing United States v. Cronic,\r\n  466 U.S. 648 (1984) and Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175 (2004), stating:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    light of the recent holding in Nixon, we believe the present case\r\n    represents one of the rare cases where counsel &quot;entirely fails to subject\r\n    the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing.&quot;Â  Moreover,\r\n    counsel did not act as an adversary to the prosecution's case, but instead\r\n    helped to bolster the case against his client.\r\n  NanceÂ \r\n    at 553, 626 S.E.2d at 881(emphasis in original).\r\n\r\nWe continued, finding that\r\n  the trial, &quot;in its entirety,&quot; demonstrated &quot;a total breakdown in\r\n  the adversarial process during both the guilt phase and the penalty phase&quot;\r\n  such that Nance was presumed to have suffered prejudice requiring a new trial.Â  Id. at 555, 626 S.E.2d at 882.Â  We emphasized &quot;the desultory manner\r\n  in which defense counsel tried this case,&quot; id. and reiterated that\r\n  counsel &quot;failed to 'functionâ€¦as the government's adversary,'&quot; acting\r\n  instead &quot;to reinforce the case against his client&quot; while\r\n  &quot;abandon[ing] his role as defense counsel.&quot;Â  Id. at 557-558,\r\n  626 S.E.2d at 883.\r\nThe majority finds\r\n  error in the trial court's focus on the lack of cross-examination of Mr. Fraley\r\n  in determining whether that testimony should be barred, choosing to rely\r\n  instead on counsel's &quot;valid overall trial strategy of not contesting\r\n  [Nance's] guilt.&quot;Â  In my opinion, while this could be a valid strategy in\r\n  isolation, this Court as well as the circuit court is bound by our finding in Nance that counsel's performance during the guilt phase of the trial &quot;further\r\n  bolster[ed] the prosecutionâ€™s case against [Nance] rather than providing him\r\n  with a defense.&quot;Â  Nance, 367 S.C. at 558, 626 S.E.2d at 883.Â  The\r\n  majority exceeds the scope of review when it supplies a trial strategy\r\n  to lawyers who had none.\r\nIn my opinion, the majority also errs when it reverses\r\n  the circuit court's suppression decision that respondent was denied &quot;an\r\n  opportunity for effective cross-examinationâ€¦.&quot;Â  State v. Stokes,\r\n  381 S.C. 390, 401-2, 673 S.E.2d 434, 439 (2009) citing United States\r\n    v. Owens, 484 U.S. 554 (1988) (emphasis supplied), by reading this\r\n  Confrontation Clause jurisprudence merely to require &quot;an opportunity for\r\n  cross-examination.&quot;Â  As the majority rightly points out, the Confrontation\r\n  Clause does not guarantee â€œcross-examination that is effective in whatever way,\r\n  and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.â€ Id.Â  Nonetheless, the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s finding that admitting Mr. Fraleyâ€™s trial testimony would\r\n  violate respondentâ€™s Confrontation Clause rights because he had an inadequate\r\n  opportunity to cross-examine the witness at that proceeding is supported by the\r\n  evidence.Â  The circuit court found that respondent effectively had no\r\n  representation at his first trial, a finding amply supported by our opinion in Nance which held not only that respondentâ€™s â€œcounsel failed to provide an adversarial\r\n  challenge to the prosecutionâ€ but that they actively aided the Stateâ€™s case\r\n  against him. Nance, at 557-558, 326 S.E.2d at 883.\r\n I would find no\r\n  abuse of discretion in the suppression of Mr. Fraley's trial testimony, State\r\n    v. Wright, supra, and would therefore affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Two other men were in the car with Respondent.Â  One man fled and was not\r\n  apprehended, but the other man was arrested.Â  He testified that he did not know\r\n  Respondent and that Respondent had picked him and the other man up on the side\r\n  of the road.Â  Nance II, 367 S.C. at 549, 626 S.E.2d at 879.\r\n[2] In addition to a bevy of other evidence, the State presented evidence\r\n  Respondent was covered in Mr. and Mrs. Fraley's blood and his semen was found\r\n  on Mrs. Fraley.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26999","title":"In the Matter of Clyde Louis Pennington","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26999","description":"","date":"2011-07-11","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Clyde Louis Pennington, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26999\r\nHeard May 5, 2011 - Filed July 11, 2011\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Clyde Louis Pennington, pro se, of Laurens.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney discipline matter, Respondent Clyde Louis Pennington has been accused of misconduct including, among other things,\r\nfailure to remit funds owed to third parties, failure to refund unearned fees, failure to protect client interests upon suspension from the practice of law, and\r\nfailure to respond to inquiries by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.&nbsp; At the time these formal charges were filed, Respondent was subject to a two-year\r\nsuspension for other misconduct.&nbsp; Respondent appeared pro se before a panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (&quot;the Panel&quot;), and a\r\nmajority of the Panel recommended Respondent be disbarred.&nbsp; Respondent has not opposed this recommendation.&nbsp; We concur in the Panel's recommendation,\r\nand therefore, Respondent is disbarred.\r\nI.\r\nIn October 2008, Respondent was suspended from the practice of law for two years as a result of misconduct violating Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1, 1.2,\r\n1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8(h), 1.15, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 8.1, and 8.4.&nbsp; See In re Pennington, 380 S.C. 49, 668 S.E.2d 402 (2008).&nbsp; The Office of\r\nDisciplinary Counsel has now received six additional complaints alleging misconduct on the part of Respondent.&nbsp; These six complaints, summarized below, are\r\nthe subject of the current proceeding.\r\nA.\r\nMisconduct in the handling of client funds\r\nIn Matters I and II, Respondent accepted fees for the purpose of representing clients in criminal matters, did no work on the matters prior to his\r\nsuspension, and failed to refund the unearned attorney's fees.\r\nIn Matter III, a client facing fraudulent check charges entrusted Respondent with funds to pay the checks at issue.&nbsp; Respondent failed to make the\r\npayments, and the client went to jail.\r\nIn Matter IV, Respondent obtained a personal injury settlement on behalf of his client in 2003, but he failed to pay the client's medical providers and\r\ninsurers out of the settlement funds.&nbsp; The funds owed to third parties totaled over $17,000.&nbsp; At the time of his suspension in 2008, the funds in\r\nRespondent's trust account were insufficient to cover the amount due.&nbsp; Respondent had not maintained the trust account records required by Rule 417, SCACR.\r\nB.\r\nFailure to protect client interests upon suspension\r\nIn Matter II, Respondent did not notify his client of his suspension from the practice of law.&nbsp; In Matter V, Respondent likewise failed to notify his\r\nclient of his suspension, even though Respondent had agreed to file an appeal on his client's behalf and had not yet done so at the time he was suspended.&nbsp;\r\nRespondent did not instruct his client regarding the steps necessary to protect his client's interests.\r\nC.\r\nActing as a surety\r\nIn Matter VI, Respondent posted bond for a client in violation of Rule 604, SCACR, which provides: &quot;An attorney or other officer of any court of this\r\nState shall not: (1) Be . . . a surety upon any recognizance or undertaking in any court of this State . . . .&quot;\r\nD.\r\nFailure to respond\r\nRespondent failed to respond to the Notices of Full Investigation regarding Matters I, II, and V.&nbsp; He also failed to appear at the investigatory\r\ninterview regarding those matters.&nbsp; See Rule 19, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (permitting Disciplinary Counsel to &quot;issue subpoenas . . . conduct\r\ninterviews and examine evidence to determine whether grounds exist to believe the allegations of complaints&quot;).\r\nRespondent did not respond to the Notice of Formal Charges.&nbsp; However, he did appear at the hearing before the Panel and present evidence in mitigation.\r\nII.\r\nThe Panel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (competence), Rule 1.2 (scope of representation),\r\nRule 1.3 (diligence), Rule 1.4 (communication), Rule 1.15 (safekeeping property), Rule 1.16 (declining or terminating representation), Rule 8.1 (bar admission\r\nand disciplinary matters), and Rule 8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nThe Panel considered three aggravating factors: Respondent's disciplinary history, his pattern of misconduct, and his &quot;indifference to the disciplinary\r\nprocess.&quot;&nbsp; In mitigation, the Panel considered Respondent's testimony regarding &quot;personal and family issues&quot; and his acknowledgement of\r\nwrongdoing.&nbsp; The Panel did not consider Respondent's testimony that the funds missing from his trust account were not taken for his individual use.\r\n&nbsp;Respondent failed to present records in support of such testimony, and therefore, the Panel applied a &quot;presumption that [Respondent] failed to\r\nsafekeep his clients' money.&quot;\r\nIn light of these findings, three members of the Panel recommended Respondent be disbarred, while two members recommended he be suspended for a definite\r\nperiod of three years.&nbsp; In addition, the Panel recommended Respondent be ordered to pay costs and restitution and, prior to seeking reinstatement, complete\r\nthe Legal Ethics and Practice Program and Trust Account School.\r\nRespondent took no exception to the Panel report.\r\nIII.\r\nThis Court &quot;may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the Commission.&quot;&nbsp; Rule\r\n27(e)(2), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp; An attorney's failure to answer the formal charges against him is an admission of the factual allegations set forth in\r\nthose charges.&nbsp; Rule 24(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nIV.\r\nWe find Respondent has committed misconduct in the respects identified by the Panel.&nbsp; Thus, we find Respondent violated the following Rules of\r\nProfessional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (competence), Rule 1.2 (scope of representation), Rule 1.3 (diligence), Rule 1.4 (communication), Rule 1.15\r\n(safekeeping property), Rule 1.16 (declining or terminating representation), Rule 8.1(b) (knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a\r\ndisciplinary authority), and Rule 8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nFurther, we concur in the Panel's findings that Respondent's prior disciplinary history, pattern of misconduct, and disregard for the disciplinary process\r\nare aggravating factors.&nbsp; Respondent was suspended in October 2008 for misconduct violating Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7,\r\n1.8(h), 1.15, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 8.1, and 8.4.&nbsp; In addition, Respondent's disciplinary history includes an October 2000 letter of caution citing Rule 8.1 and a\r\nDecember 2001 confidential admonition citing Rules 8.1 and 8.4(e).[1]&nbsp; Respondent's testimony in mitigation does\r\nnot excuse his persistent pattern of failures to exercise appropriate diligence, safekeep his clients' property, and cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel.\r\nWe find that disbarment is an appropriate sanction in this case.&nbsp; See, e.g., In re Dicks-Woolridge, 371 S.C. 42, 637 S.E.2d 565 (2006)\r\n(disbarring an attorney who failed to repay unearned fees, failed to timely remit funds owed to third parties, converted trust funds to her own use and failed\r\nto maintain proper trust account records, failed to protect her client's interests upon suspension, and failed to cooperate with ODC's investigation).&nbsp; As\r\nwe have recognized, &quot;[t]he primary purpose of disbarment . . . is the removal of an unfit person from the profession for the protection of the courts and\r\nthe public, not punishment of the offending attorney.&quot;&nbsp; In re Burr, 267 S.C. 419, 423, 228 S.E.2d 678, 680 (1976).&nbsp; The current\r\nallegations, which Respondent has admitted, include misconduct that has resulted in significant harm to his clients.&nbsp; Moreover, Respondent's disciplinary\r\nhistory shows a pattern of misconduct and a persistent failure to cooperate with Disciplinary Counsel's investigations.&nbsp; And finally, Respondent appeared\r\nbefore this Court and did not oppose the Panel's recommendations.\r\nV.\r\nRespondent has engaged in a pattern of misconduct warranting disbarment, and he has not raised any exceptions to that sanction.&nbsp; We hereby disbar\r\nRespondent.&nbsp; Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, Respondent shall surrender his certificate of admission to practice law and shall file an\r\naffidavit with the Clerk of Court showing he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nPursuant to the Panel's recommendations, Respondent is ordered to pay restitution to the clients and/or third parties in Matters I through IV.&nbsp; He shall\r\nreceive credit against these payments for any funds paid to the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection out of his trust account at the time of his 2008\r\nsuspension.&nbsp; Respondent is further ordered to pay the costs of the Panel proceedings.&nbsp; Finally, Respondent must complete the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\nProgram and Trust Account School prior to petitioning for reinstatement to the Bar.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Respondent also received a May 2009 confidential admonition citing Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1,\r\n1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.8(h), 3.3, 8.1, and 8.4, but this sanction post-dated the conduct at issue in this proceeding.&nbsp; In addition to the disciplinary history\r\ncited above, Respondent was suspended for failure to pay annual license fees and assessments in 1999 and for failure to comply with continuing legal education\r\nrequirements in 2002 and 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27000","title":"In the Matter of Irby Ezell Walker, Jr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=27000","description":"","date":"2011-07-11","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\np.heading    { text-align: center }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Irby Ezell Walker, Jr.,&nbsp;Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 27000\r\nSubmitted June 14, 2011 - Filed July 11, 2011\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Sabrina C. Todd, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        George Hunter McMaster, of Tompkins and McMaster, LLP, of Columbia, for respondent.&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for\r\nDiscipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp; In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to disbarment pursuant to\r\nRule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp; He requests the disbarment be imposed retroactively to the date of his interim suspension, September 18, 2009.&nbsp; In\r\nthe Matter of Walker, 384 S.C. 536, 683 S.E.2d 476 (2009).&nbsp; In addition, respondent agrees not to seek reinstatement until he has fully completed his\r\ncriminal sentence, fully paid restitution to the parties affected by the misappropriation of funds from his trust accounts, fully reimbursed the Lawyers' Fund\r\nfor Client Protection, and satisfied all judgments against him arising from the practice of law.&nbsp; Respondent further agrees to reimburse ODC and the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) for costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter once he has completed the active term of\r\nhis prison sentence.&nbsp;\r\nWe accept the Agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state with the conditions set forth in the Agreement.&nbsp; The disbarment\r\nshall be retroactive to the date of respondent's interim suspension.&nbsp; The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.&nbsp;\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent represented a client in a dispute with a carpenter.&nbsp; Respondent failed to competently perform some tasks on the client's behalf, failed to\r\ndiligently work on her case, and failed to adequately communicate with the client.&nbsp; In addition, respondent submitted his initial response only after\r\nreceiving ODC's reminder letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).&nbsp;\r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent conducted a real estate closing.&nbsp; The funds to be disbursed included a loan payoff of $105,600.&nbsp; Respondent failed to submit a timely\r\npayoff.&nbsp; For more than six (6) months, respondent was unaware of this problem because he was not properly reconciling his real estate trust accounts or\r\nadequately supervising his staff.&nbsp; The payoff was ultimately made, but additional interest of $5,483.57 accrued during the delay.&nbsp; Respondent admitted\r\nhe was responsible for the delay and agreed to reimburse the seller for the additional interest, but failed to so.&nbsp; Respondent later self-reported to ODC\r\nthat Jessamine Johnson, his sole real estate paralegal and the member of his staff who managed his real estate trust accounts, had been stealing money from his\r\ntrust accounts.\r\nRespondent admits he did not maintain accurate and complete trust account records as required by Rule 417, SCACR.&nbsp; Accordingly, the full extent of Ms.\r\nJohnson's misappropriation is unknown.&nbsp; However, from May 2006 through December 2008, Ms. Johnson made approximately $145,550 in payments on her American\r\nExpress account by wiring funds from one of respondent's real estate trust accounts to the company.&nbsp; Further, from September 2008 through February 2009,\r\nshe wired approximately $11,600 from another real estate trust account to her husband's business, Crescent Development, LLC.&nbsp; Ms. Johnson also issued\r\nchecks to herself, her husband, and her husband's business totaling $36,350.67 from respondent's real estate trust accounts.&nbsp;\r\nBecause the slowdown in the real estate market resulted in small balances in respondent's real estate trust accounts, Ms. Johnson eventually began to\r\nmisappropriate funds to conceal her prior thefts.&nbsp; In addition to the payoff discussed in Matter I, Ms. Johnson failed to submit payoffs in four other\r\nclosings totaling approximately $250,000.&nbsp; In April 2009, she wired $100,000 from respondent's litigation trust account to one of his real estate trust\r\naccounts, and then wrote two checks totaling $40,100 from that real estate trust account to the other real estate trust account.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough it appears Ms. Johnson also altered bank statements to hide her activities, respondent's failure to adequately maintain his trust account and\r\nproperly supervise his staff led to a significant delay in the discovery of Ms. Johnson's theft, and thus prolonged the period of time she had access to client\r\nfunds.&nbsp; Respondent reported Ms. Johnson and her husband, who allegedly assisted in the theft, to law enforcement.&nbsp; Although the exact figure is not\r\navailable, Ms. Johnson and her family have paid some restitution.\r\nMatter III\r\nIn August 2010, respondent pled guilty to solicitation of a felony.&nbsp; Specifically, respondent admitted attempting to hire a &quot;hit man&quot; to\r\nmurder another member of the South Carolina Bar.&nbsp; Respondent paid the &quot;hit man&quot; in part with a post-dated check because he did not have\r\nsufficient funds in his account to pay the check's face value.&nbsp; Respondent was sentenced to ten (10) years imprisonment, suspended upon service of three\r\n(3) years imprisonment and five years of probation.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nMatter IV\r\nComplainant, the attorney respondent attempted to have murdered, represented the wife in a domestic matter.&nbsp; Respondent represented the husband.&nbsp;\r\nAfter being relieved from the case, respondent went with the husband to the wife's home and convinced her to fire Complainant and reach an agreement with the\r\nhusband.&nbsp; Respondent told the wife not to tell anyone about the visit.&nbsp; Respondent prepared a quit claim deed for the husband to sign as part of the\r\nsettlement he was proposing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent agreed to represent a client in a personal injury case on a contingency fee basis.&nbsp; Respondent never filed suit and did not adequately\r\ncommunicate his decision with the client.&nbsp; The statute of limitations expired and, almost three years after accepting the case, respondent wrote\r\n&quot;Close - We did not pursue&quot; on the client's file.&nbsp;\r\nMatter VI\r\nA client hired respondent to represent him in a personal injury case arising from an automobile accident.&nbsp; Respondent did not work diligently on the\r\ncase.&nbsp; When the client came to respondent in need of money, respondent guaranteed an $8,000 bank loan for the client.&nbsp; Respondent promised the client\r\nhe would quickly settle the case and pay off the loan, but failed to do so.&nbsp; The note was renewed multiple times and respondent paid interest on the loan\r\non at least one occasion.&nbsp;\r\nMatter VII\r\nIn August 2009, respondent accepted a $4,000 retainer from a husband and wife to represent them in a foreclosure matter.&nbsp; Respondent had not earned his\r\nfee upon receipt of the retainer and did not deposit the retainer into his trust account.&nbsp; Instead, respondent endorsed the check and gave it to a third\r\nperson who endorsed and negotiated the check.&nbsp;\r\nMatter VIII\r\nOn or about December 5, 2008, respondent accepted a $2,000 retainer to pursue a divorce on behalf of a seriously ill man who believed his wife was poisoning\r\nhim.&nbsp; The client wanted the action filed immediately and for respondent to seek an expedited hearing as well as an expedited divorce on the ground of\r\nhabitual drunkenness.&nbsp; The client died on December 13, 2008, before respondent had filed a domestic action or otherwise performed work on his case.&nbsp;\r\nRespondent did not refund any portion of the retainer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:&nbsp; Rule 1.1\r\n(lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (lawyer shall abide by client's decisions concerning objectives of representation and\r\nconsult with client as to means by which they are pursued); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule\r\n1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.5(a)\r\n(lawyer shall not make agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses); Rule 1.8(e) (lawyer shall not provide\r\nfinancial assistance to client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation); Rule 1.8(i) (lawyer shall not acquire proprietary interest in cause of\r\naction or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for client); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safeguard client funds); Rule 1.15(c) (lawyer shall deposit\r\ninto client trust account unearned legal fees and expenses that have been paid in advance, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses\r\nincurred); Rule 4.2 (lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in\r\nthe matter unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or court order); Rule 5.3 (lawyer who possesses managerial\r\nauthority in law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that non-lawyer employee's conduct is\r\ncompatible with the professional obligations of lawyer; lawyer having direct supervisory authority over non-lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that\r\nnon-lawyer's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of lawyer); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for\r\ninformation from disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (it\r\nis professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other\r\nrespects); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal act involving moral turpitude); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).&nbsp; In addition, respondent admits he violated the\r\nrecordkeeping provisions of Rule 417, SCACR.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent further admits his misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it\r\nshall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to knowingly\r\nfail to respond to a lawful demand for response from disciplinary authority), Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct\r\ntending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice\r\nlaw), and Rule 7(a)(6)&nbsp; (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate the oath of office taken to practice law in this state and contained in\r\nRule 402(k), SCACR). &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent retroactively to September 18, 2009, the date of his interim suspension.&nbsp;\r\nRespondent shall not file a petition for reinstatement until he has fully completed his criminal sentence, fully paid restitution to the parties affected by the\r\nmisappropriation of funds from his trust accounts, fully reimbursed the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection, and satisfied all judgments against him arising\r\nfrom the practice of law.&nbsp; Once he has completed the active term of his prison sentence, respondent shall make arrangements to fully reimburse ODC and the\r\nCommission for costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has\r\ncomplied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.&nbsp;\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ.&nbsp;

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Susan B. Hackett,&nbsp; Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary\r\n        Counsel.\r\n        Gwendolyn Long Robinson, of Mount Pleasant, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule\r\n21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to the imposition of an admonition, public reprimand, or definite suspension not to\r\nexceed nine (9) months.&nbsp; In addition, respondent agrees to pay the costs incurred by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) in the\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of this matter.&nbsp; We accept the Agreement, issue a public reprimand, and order respondent to pay the costs in this matter\r\nwithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion.&nbsp; The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent represented the plaintiff in an action brought in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina; Complainant represented the\r\ndefendants in the suit.&nbsp; The suit alleged a violation of the plaintiff's civil rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent interviewed Witnesses A and B and prepared affidavits for the witnesses based upon her interviews.&nbsp; Respondent faxed the affidavits to the\r\nwitnesses and requested they call her if they had any problems with the affidavits.&nbsp; Respondent did not receive a call from either witness.&nbsp;\r\nOn June 18, 2010, respondent filed the two affidavits with the court in support of her Motion in Opposition to Complainant's Motion for Summary\r\nJudgment.&nbsp; One of the affidavits purported to contain the sworn testimony of Witness A.&nbsp; The affidavit was not signed by Witness A.&nbsp; Instead,\r\nrespondent affixed the following to the signature line:&nbsp; &quot;/s/ Witness A.&quot;&nbsp; Respondent then typed her name as the notary public for the\r\ndocument with a date of June17, 2010.&nbsp;\r\nThe other affidavit purported to contain the sworn testimony of Witness B.&nbsp; The affidavit was not signed by Witness B.&nbsp; Instead, respondent affixed\r\nthe following to the signature line:&nbsp; &quot;/s/ Witness B.&quot;&nbsp; Respondent then typed her name as the notary public for the document with a date of\r\nJune 17, 2010.&nbsp;\r\nNeither Witness A nor Witness B personally appeared before respondent on June 17, 2010, and neither signed the affidavits on June 17, 2010.&nbsp; When\r\nrespondent affixed her name as the notary, she indicated the affiant personally appeared before her and attested to the veracity of the contents of the\r\ndocument.&nbsp; This was not true.\r\nOn June 24, 2010, respondent met with Witness A and Witness B.&nbsp; One of them confronted respondent regarding the affidavits.&nbsp; Both insisted\r\nrespondent make amendments to the contents of their affidavits.&nbsp; Respondent made the amendments.&nbsp; Both then signed the affidavits and respondent filed\r\nthe amended affidavits.&nbsp; Respondent admits the requested changes weakened her client's position.&nbsp;\r\nOn June 25, 2010, Complainant obtained affidavits from Witness A and Witness B indicating they did not sign the affidavits purported to be signed by them on\r\nJune 17, 2010.&nbsp; Complainant filed a motion with the court asking the court to disregard the documents.&nbsp; The court did not issue a decision\r\nComplainant's motion because the case settled.&nbsp;\r\nThe use of &quot;s/&quot; followed by a name indicates that the document is a copy, the original contains an original signature, and the copy has been\r\nconformed to match the original by use of the symbol.&nbsp; Thus, when respondent typed &quot;/s/&quot; followed by the names of Witness A and Witness B on the\r\naffidavits, she represented to the court that these individuals had signed original affidavits and she was merely conforming the copies to the signed\r\noriginals.&nbsp; Respondent admits this was a misrepresentation to the court as signed originals did not exist on June 17, 2010, or June 18, 2010, when the\r\naffidavits were filed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe United States District Court for the District of South Carolina has established Policies and Procedures for e-filing.&nbsp; Section 10.5 of the ECF\r\nPolicies and Procedures manual provides that &quot;documents containing the signature of persons other than Filing Users are to be filed electronically\r\nas a scanned image.&quot;&nbsp; Additionally, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina has published an Attorney's Manual.&nbsp;\r\nSection 7 of the Manual explains that &quot;[s]ome documents which bear the signatures of persons other than the particular Filing User who filed the\r\ndocument (including other Filing Users) must be electronically filed as scanned images (e.g., affidavits).&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the federal court's\r\nPolicies and Procedures required respondent to file scanned images of the originally signed affidavits, not copies with conformed signatures.&nbsp;\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by her misconduct, she has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, particularly Rule 3.3 (lawyer\r\nshall not knowingly make false statement of fact to tribunal or fail to correct false statement of material fact previously made to the tribunal by lawyer);\r\nRule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional\r\nmisconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4 (e) (it is professional misconduct for\r\nlawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to administration of justice).&nbsp; Respondent acknowledges that her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline\r\nunder the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules\r\nof Professional Conduct).&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.&nbsp; Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly\r\nreprimand respondent for her misconduct.&nbsp; Respondent shall pay the costs associated with the investigation and prosecution of this matter within thirty\r\n(30) days of the date of this opinion.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.&nbsp;

Pikaart was an employee of A &amp; A Taxi, Inc. at the time he was injured in two automobile accidents and that he\r\nwas entitled to certain workers' compensation benefits.&nbsp; Appellants contend Pikaart was an independent contractor, not an employee; therefore, the South\r\nCarolina Workers' Compensation Commission has no jurisdiction in this matter.&nbsp; They further argue the circuit court improperly made findings of fact that\r\ndid not bear on the limited issue of jurisdiction that was before it.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nI.&nbsp; FACTS\r\nA &amp; A Taxi, Inc. is a taxi company located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.&nbsp; It was formed by Romeo A. Liriani, the company's owner and\r\npresident.&nbsp;\r\nPikaart had over twenty years of experience in the taxi business at the time this action arose.&nbsp; Pikaart was involved in two unrelated automobile\r\naccidents in Horry County on October 23, 2004 and January 2, 2005 while performing errands for A&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;A Taxi.[1]&nbsp;\r\nIn April of 2005, Liriani and Pikaart parted ways.&nbsp; According to Pikaart, he was terminated after he advised Liriani that he would need surgery as a result\r\nof his injuries.\r\nPikaart sought workers' compensation coverage for alleged injuries he sustained to his neck, back, arms, hands, and fingers.&nbsp; A &amp; A Taxi denied\r\nresponsibility for Pikaart's claims on the basis Pikaart was an independent contractor, not an employee.&nbsp; A &amp; A Taxi did not carry workers'\r\ncompensation coverage, so the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Uninsured Employers' Fund was made a party to the action.&nbsp;\r\nA hearing was held before a commissioner of the Workers' Compensation Commission.&nbsp; Pikaart testified that he had been employed by Liriani as\r\nA&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;A Taxi's office manager at the time of his accidents.&nbsp; He outlined his duties, which included the following:&nbsp; making a schedule for\r\nall of the taxis; implementing a $10 dispatch fee all drivers were required to pay A &amp; A Taxi for dispatch services, which saved the company some overhead\r\ncosts; processing the trip vouchers that were submitted for every taxi; implementing a rotation system for high-paying fares and a method for selling accounts\r\nreceivable to provide immediate cash flow; hiring and firing drivers for Liriani; finding independent cabs to take calls whenever A &amp; A Taxi was fully\r\nbooked; overseeing vehicle maintenance for the taxis; filling in as a dispatcher and a driver whenever needed; and communicating with insurance companies, City\r\nHall, and others on behalf of A &amp; A Taxi.&nbsp;\r\nIn contrast, Liriani testified Pikaart was &quot;never&quot; the manager of A &amp; A Taxi. &nbsp;Liriani stated Pikaart leased five cabs and three\r\ncertificates (or medallions) from him, and that Pikaart leased two medallions from other individuals and operated all five of those cabs as his own\r\nbusiness.&nbsp; He stated Pikaart never performed any duties for him; rather, he just controlled the five cabs he leased.&nbsp;\r\nThe commissioner found Pikaart was not an employee of A &amp; A Taxi, but was instead operating his own taxi business.&nbsp; The commissioner concluded the\r\nCommission did not have jurisdiction over this case because no employer-employee relationship existed.&nbsp; An Appellate Panel of the Commission upheld the\r\ncommissioner's order.&nbsp;\r\nUpon review, the circuit court, noting it could take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence on jurisdictional matters, determined Pikaart was the\r\nmanager of A &amp; A Taxi and therefore an employee.&nbsp; The circuit court stated Pikaart &quot;ran the entire [A &amp; A Taxi] operation and was present\r\nevery day&quot; and that his &quot;managerial duties [were] extensive.&quot;&nbsp; The circuit court noted &quot;it is clear [Pikaart's] overall task was to\r\nincrease revenue for the company,&quot; and &quot;[h]is injuries occurred when furthering the business of [A &amp; A Taxi].&quot;&nbsp; Citing Nelson v.\r\nYellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 564 S.E.2d 110 (2002), the circuit court found A &amp; A Taxi exercised extensive control over Pikaart as well as the other\r\nworkers.&nbsp; The circuit court additionally found Pikaart was entitled to certain workers' compensation benefits.&nbsp;\r\nAppellants appealed.&nbsp; Pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, we certified this case from the Court of Appeals.\r\nII.&nbsp; STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of workers' compensation decisions.&nbsp; Pierre v. Seaside Farms,\r\nInc.,&nbsp;386 S.C. 534, 689 S.E.2d 615 (2010); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).&nbsp; Under the APA, this Court can reverse\r\nor modify the decision of the Commission where the substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law\r\nor is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence considering the record as a whole.&nbsp; Pierre, 386 S.C. at 540,\r\n689 S.E.2d at &nbsp;618; Transp. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Second Injury Fund, 389 S.C. 422, 427, 699 S.E.2d 687, 689-90 (2010) (citing S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§&nbsp;1-23-380(5)(d), (e) (Supp. 2009)).\r\nAn award under workers' compensation law is not authorized unless an employer-employee relationship existed at the time of the injury for which a claim is\r\nmade.&nbsp; Crim v. Decorator's Supply, 291 S.C. 193, 352 S.E.2d 520 (Ct. App. 1987); McLeod v. Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., 280 S.C. 466, 313\r\nS.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 1984); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-130 (Supp. 2010) (defining &quot;employee&quot; under workers' compensation law to include\r\n&quot;every person engaged in an employment under any appointment, contract of hire, or apprenticeship, expressed or implied, oral or written . . .\r\n.&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nThe question whether a claimant is an employee or an independent contractor is a jurisdictional issue.&nbsp; Wilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State\r\nTransp. Co., 382 S.C. 295, 676 S.E.2d 700 (2009); Vines v. Champion Bldg. Prods., 315 S.C. 13, 431 S.E.2d 585 (1993). &nbsp;Where the disputed issue\r\nconcerns jurisdiction, this Court may take its own view of the preponderance of the facts upon which jurisdiction is dependent.&nbsp; Wilson v. Georgetown\r\nCounty, 316 S.C. 92, 447 S.E.2d 841 (1994); Spivey v. D.G. Constr. Co., 321 S.C. 19, 467 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1996).&nbsp;\r\nIt is South Carolina's policy to resolve jurisdictional questions in favor of inclusion of employees within workers' compensation coverage rather than\r\nexclusion.&nbsp; Shuler v. Tri-County Elec. Co-op, 385 S.C. 470, 684 S.E.2d 765 (2009); Hill v. Eagle Motor Lines, 373 S.C. 422, 645 S.E.2d 424\r\n(2007); Pilgrim v. Eaton, 391 S.C. 38, 703 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\nAlthough we may take our own view of the preponderance of the evidence on matters affecting jurisdiction, this broader scope of review does not require this\r\nCourt to ignore the findings of the Commission, which was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.&nbsp; Paschal v. Price, Op.\r\nNo. 26958 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Apr. 4, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 12 at 44); Shealy v. Aiken County,&nbsp;341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000).\r\nIII.&nbsp; LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Appellants contend the circuit court erred in (1) finding Pikaart was an employee of A &amp; A Taxi, rather than an independent contractor, and\r\n(2) making findings of fact numbered one through nine because they do not relate to the limited issue of jurisdiction that was before the court.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employee Versus Independent Contractor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder South Carolina law, the primary consideration in determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists is whether the purported employer has the\r\nright to control the employee in the performance of the work and the manner in which it is done.&nbsp; Kilgore Group, Inc. v. South Carolina Employment Sec.\r\nComm'n,&nbsp;313 S.C. 65, 437 S.E.2d 48 (1993).&nbsp; &quot;The test is not the actual control exercised, but whether there exists the right and authority\r\nto control and direct the particular work or undertaking.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 68, 437 S.E.2d at 49.[2]\r\nThe four principal factors indicating the right of control are (1) direct evidence of the right to, or exercise of, control; (2) the method of payment; (3)\r\nthe furnishing of equipment; and (4) the right to fire.&nbsp; South Carolina Workers' Comp. Comm'n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546, 459\r\nS.E.2d 302 (1995); Chavis v. Watkins, 256 S.C. 30, 180 S.E.2d 648 (1971).\r\nIn Wilkinson, this Court announced a return to our jurisprudence that evaluates the four factors with equal force in both directions to provide an\r\neven-handed and balanced approach.&nbsp; Wilkinson, 382 S.C. at 300, 676 S.E.2d at 702.&nbsp; This overruled the analytical framework previously set\r\nforth in Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 534 S.E.2d 700 (2000) on the basis it unduly weighted the factors in a manner that favored a finding of\r\nemployment by providing the existence of any single factor was virtually proof of an employment relationship, while contrary evidence as to any one factor was\r\nonly mildly persuasive evidence of contractorship.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nIn the current matter, the circuit court found the case of Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 564 S.E.2d 110 (2002) to be controlling.&nbsp; In Nelson,\r\nwe considered the jurisdictional question whether a taxi driver, who had been murdered while driving his cab, was an employee or an independent contractor of\r\nYellow Cab.&nbsp; We noted there was a split of authority as to the status of a taxi driver who leases a taxi under a per diem payment agreement and keeps his\r\nfares and tips as compensation, but observed that the majority of cases hold that under such circumstances the taxi driver is an employee by virtue of the cab\r\ncompany's exercise of control.&nbsp; Id. at 595, 564 S.E.2d at 113.\r\nWilkinson expressly overruled Nelson to the extent it applied the Dawkins test, but this does not alter the fundamental principle\r\nestablished in Nelson regarding the taxi driver's employment status.&nbsp; Although the Nelson Court recited the Dawkins test, as a\r\npractical matter, it did not rely upon the presence of only one factor as being determinative of an employment relationship.&nbsp; Rather, it considered in\r\ndetail all four factors and found by a preponderance of the evidence that these factors, on balance, were indicative of an employment relationship.&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the result in Nelson would be the same under the approach announced in Wilkinson.&nbsp;\r\nSimilarly, in the current appeal, the circuit court recited the Dawkins test in passing,[3] but it did not\r\nrely upon the presence of only one factor.&nbsp; Instead, the court evaluated all four factors before finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an\r\nemployment relationship existed between Pikaart and A &amp; A Taxi.\r\nPikaart maintains that &quot;[i]t is clear when considering the Nelson factors, even when using the approach approved in [Wilkinson], that [he]\r\nwas an employee of [A &amp; A Taxi] and the decision of the Circuit Court should be affirmed.&quot;&nbsp; We agree.\r\nAppellants note in their brief that a number of former drivers testified that Pikaart was the general manager of A &amp; A Taxi and also testified about the\r\ndegree of control A &amp; A Taxi exerted over them.&nbsp; Appellants concede:&nbsp; &quot;If one of those drivers had been injured, it is clear that under the Nelson\r\ncase, they would have been considered employees.&quot;&nbsp; Nevertheless, Appellants argue &quot;those drivers' positions at A &amp; A Taxi, Inc. differed from\r\nthat of the Claimant, Robert Pikaart.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nAppellants deny that Pikaart was ever A &amp; A Taxi's manager, but argue that, even if he was the manager, &quot;he was not injured in that role.&nbsp; He\r\nwas allegedly injured while driving a cab.&quot;&nbsp; The fact that Pikaart was employed as the company's manager (which included duties such as driving a taxi\r\nand performing dispatching services when needed), as opposed to being employed solely as a taxi driver, does not negate his status as an employee, and\r\nAppellants have pointed to no specific evidence to support its assertion that being a manager somehow invalidated his employment status.\r\nAppellants further contend Pikaart was merely leasing five cabs from Liriani and operated those cabs for his own independent business.&nbsp; As in Nelson,\r\nthe fact that Pikaart leased his cabs from A &amp; A Taxi and split the fares with A &amp; A Taxi to receive compensation is typical for the industry and is not\r\ndeterminative that he ran his own taxi company within Liriani's taxi company.&nbsp; As noted in Nelson, the majority of jurisdictions considering the\r\nquestion have held that such an arrangement constitutes an employment, not an independent contractor, arrangement.&nbsp; It is clear from the record, and\r\nAppellants conceded as much at oral argument, that Pikaart did perform tasks for the benefit of, and on behalf of, A &amp; A Taxi, not strictly for\r\nhimself.&nbsp; Further, Pikaart took nothing with him when he parted ways with A &amp; A Taxi, and there is no evidence he operated his own independent\r\nbusiness.\r\nAppellants next assert that Pikaart has started his own cab company, Red Top Cabs, since parting ways with A &amp; A Taxi.&nbsp; However, Pikaart's\r\nactivities after leaving A &amp; A Taxi are not relevant to Pikaart's employment status at the time of the accidents at issue here.\r\nAppellants also state Pikaart has been in the taxi business for over twenty years and during that time he never purchased workers' compensation insurance for\r\nhis drivers, but he now wants compensation for himself.&nbsp; This point likewise is not relevant to the jurisdictional question of whether Pikaart was an\r\nemployee or an independent contractor with A &amp; A Taxi at the time of his accidents.&nbsp; Appellants contend this information goes to credibility.&nbsp; But\r\nby the same token, Liriani admittedly has never provided workers' compensation coverage to anyone working for him, either, so he is in the same position as\r\nPikaart in this regard.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough Appellants did not individually address the four factors, we now examine some of the pertinent evidence as it relates to the four individual factors\r\nin evaluating the right of control.\r\n(1)&nbsp; Direct Evidence of the Right to Control\r\nThe circuit court noted the workers at A &amp; A Taxi needed advance permission to be taken off of the work schedule, they were not allowed to give out their\r\nown phone numbers for business, and all calls were required to go through the dispatcher.&nbsp;\r\nPikaart, in particular, testified that Liriani required all calls to go through the dispatcher, and he was not allowed to give out his own cell phone number,\r\nname, or business card.&nbsp; Liriani controlled the advertising and provided business cards for the workers to use.&nbsp; Further, workers were expected to\r\nrespond to the dispatcher when called and to make trips as directed.&nbsp; Pikaart said that he would call the dispatcher if he were out of the cab for any\r\nreason, such as to get something to eat or use the restroom.&nbsp;\r\nPikaart primarily performed managerial tasks for Liriani and A &amp; A Taxi, but he also filled in as a dispatcher and he drove cabs when needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn fact, both of the accidents he is seeking compensation for occurred while he was driving vehicles owned by A &amp; A Taxi and running errands on behalf of\r\nthe company.&nbsp; Although Pikaart had some discretion as manager and, in fact, came up with several business concepts for the company, such as the $10\r\ndispatch fee, it is clear from the record that these were all in furtherance of A&nbsp;&amp; A Taxi's business, and Pikaart did not implement any substantial\r\nchanges without Liriani's consent.&nbsp; We find this factor weighs in favor of an employment relationship.\r\n(2)&nbsp; Furnishing of Equipment\r\nThe circuit court found A &amp; A Taxi furnished the cabs, provided maintenance, and also procured insurance and permits for all cars. &nbsp;It also\r\nadvertised the company's services and provided business cards and dispatching services, as well as a common paint scheme with the &quot;A &amp; A Taxi&quot;\r\nname on all of the cabs.&nbsp; The circuit court noted A &amp; A Taxi also provided a phone number, customers, vouchers, and rules to abide by, and drivers were\r\nnot allowed to give out personal business cards or contact numbers.&nbsp;\r\nThese findings are all supported by the record, as the former workers with A &amp; A Taxi testified that the company provided most of the necessary equipment\r\nand services.&nbsp; As to Pikaart in particular, he testified that he did not own the dispatch service and equipment, phone numbers, cabs, or anything else\r\nwhile he was working for A&nbsp;&amp; A Taxi, and he took nothing with him when he left.&nbsp; He further testified that Liriani purchased the city business\r\nlicense.&nbsp; We find this factor weighs heavily in favor of finding an employment relationship.\r\n(3)&nbsp; Method of Payment\r\nThe circuit court found the drivers in this case were allowed to keep fifty percent of their fares, which was similar to the situation in Nelson.&nbsp;\r\nThe circuit court noted Pikaart received payment much the same as the employee in Nelson, except that he derived his income from five cabs, rather than\r\nfrom one, and he paid a weekly rate to the employer instead of a daily rate.&nbsp; The circuit court specifically found that Pikaart was not operating his own\r\nbusiness within the A &amp; A Taxi business.&nbsp;\r\nPikaart testified that he was never given a W-2 form or a Form 1099 when he worked at A &amp; A Taxi.&nbsp; However, he said he listed A &amp; A Taxi as his\r\nemployer on his tax returns.&nbsp; Further, Pikaart testified that he &quot;derived all of [his] living from A&amp;A Taxi.&quot;&nbsp; Liriani confirmed that he\r\nnever provided Pikaart with either a W-2 form or a Form 1099.&nbsp;\r\nThe parties operated primarily on a cash basis, and it appears this was intended to avoid reporting requirements on both sides.&nbsp; Due to the lack of\r\nrecords in this regard, the evidence does not preponderate in favor of either party and we consider this a neutral factor.\r\n(4)&nbsp; Right to Fire\r\nAs noted by the circuit court, several of the witnesses testified that those working at A &amp; A Taxi could be fired for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; For\r\nexample, Charles Michael Clark, a former driver and dispatcher for A &amp; A Taxi, testified that he had been terminated by Liriani.&nbsp; Clark stated workers\r\ncould be terminated for a variety of reasons, including failing to pick up a customer or not showing up, drinking on the job, having too many wrecks, making a\r\nfalse application, carrying a weapon, stealing, or cheating on trip sheets, etc.&nbsp;\r\nPikaart testified that he was fired after he told Liriani that he would need surgery as a result of his accidents.&nbsp; Pikaart stated Liriani would\r\nsometimes fire people, but would on occasion direct him or a dispatcher to do the firing.&nbsp;\r\nUpon questioning, Liriani adamantly denied that he could terminate any of the workers at A &amp; A Taxi.&nbsp; He was asked if he could terminate them\r\nunder various extreme scenarios, such as if they didn't show up for work ten days in a row, or if they had ten wrecks in a row, and he said &quot;absolutely\r\nnot.&quot;&nbsp; Liriani even stated that if one of the drivers &quot;blows up the Myrtle Beach Convention Center&quot; (his example), he still could not fire\r\nthem, but would &quot;report them to the police department.&quot;&nbsp; This testimony reflects adversely upon Liriani's credibility.&nbsp; We find this factor\r\nalso weighs heavily in favor of finding an employment relationship existed.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the circuit court correctly considered the jurisdictional facts and found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Pikaart\r\nwas the general manager of A &amp; A Taxi and thus, its employee.&nbsp; Accordingly, the circuit court's determination in this regard is affirmed.&nbsp;\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional Findings of Fact\r\nAppellants next contend that, even if this Court agrees with the circuit court's determination that Pikaart was an employee, the circuit court committed\r\n&quot;obvious error&quot; by making additional findings of fact regarding the benefits to which Pikaart is entitled.&nbsp; Appellants state these findings\r\nencompassed such matters as the compensability of Pikaart's claims, his average weekly wage, the dates for which he was to receive benefits, and his entitlement\r\nto additional medical care.\r\nAppellants state the Commission never reached the issue of benefits because it found it had no jurisdiction.&nbsp; Appellants assert these findings go beyond\r\nthe limited jurisdictional issue presented on appeal, i.e., whether an employer-employee relationship existed, and the circuit court lacks the authority to make\r\nits own findings of fact on issues not related to jurisdiction.&nbsp; Instead, such issues should have been remanded to the Commission.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough the circuit court committed error for the reasons stated by Appellants, there is no indication in the record that Appellants ever presented this\r\nargument to the circuit court to allow it the opportunity to amend its ruling.&nbsp; Thus, any error was not preserved and it is not properly before this Court.\r\nA matter may not be presented for the first time on appeal; rather, it must have been both raised to and ruled upon by the court below.&nbsp; Wilder Corp.\r\nv. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731 (1998).\r\nAlthough Rule 59(e), SCRCP motions are not applicable in matters before the Commission itself,[4] such\r\nmotions are applicable when the circuit court sits in an appellate capacity, and they are required to preserve an issue for review by the Court of Appeals or\r\nthis Court.&nbsp; See Shealy, 341 S.C. at 460, 535 S.E.2d at 444 (holding, in a workers' compensation case, that the alleged error was not\r\npreserved for appellate review where the circuit court did not rule on the issue and no Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion was made); Leviner v. Sonoco Prods. Co.,\r\n339 S.C. 492, 530 S.E.2d 127 (2000) (observing neither party filed a timely motion under Rule 59(e), SCRCP seeking clarification of the circuit court's order in\r\nan appeal from the Commission); see also Hill v. South Carolina Dep't. of Health &amp; Envt'l Control, 389 S.C. 1, 698 S.E.2d 612&nbsp;(2010)\r\n(stating Rule 59(e), SCRCP motions are necessary to preserve issues not ruled upon for review when the circuit court sits in an appellate capacity (citing City\r\nof Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 646 S.E.2d 879 (2007)).&nbsp;\r\nIV.&nbsp; CONCLUSION\r\nBecause the issue on appeal concerns jurisdiction, i.e., whether an employer-employee relationship existed, this Court may take its own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; We hold the facts in this case preponderate in favor of a finding that Pikaart was the general manager of A&nbsp;&amp; A\r\nTaxi and, thus, was an employee subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.&nbsp; To the extent Appellants contend the circuit court erred in making\r\nadditional findings of fact that were not related to jurisdiction, we hold this issue is not properly before this Court on appeal as it was not preserved.&nbsp;\r\nConsequently, we affirm the circuit court's order in full.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The first accident occurred when Pikaart used a taxi to pick up a driver who had no transportation to\r\nwork.&nbsp; The taxi was struck from behind while waiting at a red light.&nbsp; The second accident occurred after Pikaart had driven to a repair shop to check\r\non the status of a mechanical problem with another taxi.&nbsp; Before leaving the shop, Pikaart called a dispatcher to inquire whether they needed any\r\nassistance, and he was directed to pick up a paying passenger in Socastee.&nbsp; Pikaart was on his way to pick up the fare when a driver in another car ran a\r\nstop sign, and the two collided.&nbsp; A &amp; A Taxi owned the taxis involved in both accidents.\r\n[2]&nbsp; In Kilgore, we observed that &quot;[u]nder the South Carolina Employment Security Law, employment\r\nis defined to include 'any service performed by any individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee\r\nrelationship, has the status of an employee . . . .'&quot;&nbsp; Kilgore, 313 S.C. at 68, 437 S.E.2d at 49 (quoting S.C.

Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia, and Solicitor Christina Theos Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:&nbsp; In State v. Reid, 383 S.C. 285, 679 S.E.2d 194 (Ct. App. 2009), the court of appeals affirmed Petitioner Jamey Allen\r\nReid's convictions for attempted second-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor and criminal solicitation of a minor.&nbsp; We granted a writ of\r\ncertiorari to review the court of appeals' analysis and disposition of Petitioner's conviction and sentence for attempted second-degree CSC with a minor.&nbsp;\r\nThe single issue before us is whether the court of appeals erred in upholding the trial court's denial of Petitioner's directed verdict motion.&nbsp; We\r\naffirm.&nbsp;\r\nI.\r\nThe underlying facts are detailed in the court of appeals' excellent opinion.&nbsp; In essence, Petitioner entered an Internet chat room (under the screen\r\nname &quot;Fine_Ass_Seminoles_Fan&quot;) believing he was chatting with a fourteen-year-old female.&nbsp; The supposed minor was, in fact, Westminster Police\r\nOfficer Mark Patterson.&nbsp; Officer Patterson used the screen name &quot;Skatergurl.&quot;&nbsp; Petitioner quickly turned the conversation to one of a sexual\r\nnature, as he desired a sexual encounter with Skatergurl.&nbsp; Skatergurl asked, &quot;You don't care I am 14?&quot; to which Petitioner responded,\r\n&quot;No.&quot;&nbsp; Petitioner suggested a meeting place and time, specifically the parking lot of the Westminster Middle School between 2:00 and 2:15\r\na.m.&nbsp; Skatergurl agreed.&nbsp; Petitioner's stated intention was to take Skatergurl to his apartment.&nbsp;\r\nOfficer Patterson and a fellow officer traveled to the Westminster Middle School parking lot.&nbsp; At approximately 2:30 a.m., Petitioner arrived in the\r\nparking lot, driving his vehicle. The officers stopped Petitioner and arrested him.\r\nPetitioner was indicted and tried for attempted second-degree CSC with a minor and criminal solicitation of a minor.&nbsp; At the close of the State's case,\r\nPetitioner moved for a directed verdict in connection with the attempted CSC charge, arguing that the State had failed to present evidence of an overt act as\r\nrequired by the attempted CSC charge.&nbsp; Because the trial court held there was sufficient evidence presented to create a jury question, the directed verdict\r\nmotion was denied.&nbsp; The jury convicted Petitioner on both charges, and he was sentenced.&nbsp; Petitioner appealed the attempted CSC conviction, which was\r\naffirmed by the court of appeals in a scholarly opinion.\r\nII.\r\nWe granted a writ of certiorari to determine whether Petitioner's traveling to a predetermined location constituted sufficient evidence of an overt act,\r\nwhich is an essential element in establishing an &quot;attempt&quot; to commit the underlying crime.&nbsp; Petitioner contends the evidence, as a matter of law,\r\nwas insufficient on the question of specific intent and further rose only to the level of &quot;mere preparation,&quot; entitling him to a directed verdict of\r\nacquittal on the attempted CSC charge.&nbsp; Under the facts of this case, we agree with the court of appeals that because a jury question was presented, the\r\ndirected verdict motion was properly denied.[1]\r\nTurning to the substance of Petitioner's argument, South Carolina law provides that &quot;[a] person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the\r\nsecond degree if . . . the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age or less but who is at least eleven years of\r\nage.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(B)(1) (Supp. 2010).&nbsp; A person guilty of attempt is punishable as if he had committed the underlying\r\noffense.&nbsp; State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 396 n.3, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285 n.3 (2000).&nbsp; To prove attempt, the State must prove that the defendant\r\nhad the specific intent to commit the underlying offense, along with some overt act, beyond mere preparation, in furtherance of the intent.&nbsp; State\r\nv. Nesbitt, 346 S.C. 226, 231, 550 S.E.2d 864, 866 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nA.\r\nIn the context of an attempt crime, specific intent means the defendant intended to complete the acts comprising the underlying offense.&nbsp; Sutton,\r\n340 S.C. at 397, 532 S.E.2d at 285 (&quot;In the context of an attempt crime, specific intent means that the defendant consciously intended the completion of\r\nacts comprising the choate offense.&quot;).&nbsp; The evidence here presented a jury question on the element of specific intent.&nbsp; As detailed by the court\r\nof appeals, Petitioner clearly indicated his desire to have a sexual encounter with Skatergurl, whom he believed to be fourteen years old.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBeyond the evidence of specific intent, we find that Petitioner's actions also presented a jury question as to whether he committed an overt act in\r\nfurtherance of the underlying crime.&nbsp; To prove attempt, the State must prove that the defendant committed an overt act, beyond mere preparation, in\r\nfurtherance of the intent to commit the crime.&nbsp; Nesbitt, 346 S.C. at 231, 550 S.E.2d at 866 (citing State v. Evans, 216 S.C. 328, 57 S.E.2d\r\n756 (1950); State v. Quick, 199 S.C. 256, 19 S.E.2d 101 (1942)); see also State v. Rallo, 304 S.C. 258, 269, 403 S.E.2d 653, 659 (1991) (Toal,\r\nJ., dissenting) (&quot;In order to constitute an attempt to commit a crime, it is essential that, coupled with the intent to commit the offense, there be some\r\novert act, beyond mere preparation, in furtherance of the intent . . . .&quot;).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  In Quick, this Court stated,\r\n  No definite rule as to what constitutes an overt act can safely be laid down in cases of this kind. Each case must depend largely upon its particular facts\r\n  and the inferences which the jury may reasonably draw therefrom, subject to general principles applied as nearly as can be, with a view to working substantial\r\n  justice.\r\n  It is well settled that the &quot;act&quot; is to be liberally construed, and in numerous cases it is said to be sufficient that the act go far enough\r\n  toward accomplishment of the crime to amount to the commencement of its consummation. While the efficiency of a particular act depends on the facts of the\r\n  particular case, the act must always amount to more than mere preparation, and move directly toward the commission of the crime. In any event, it would seem,\r\n  the act need not be the last proximate step leading to the consummation of the offense.\r\n\r\n199 S.C. at 259, 19 S.E.2d at 102.[2]&nbsp; The Court further stated, &quot;The preparation consists of\r\ndevising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of the crime; the attempt or overt act is the direct movement toward the commission,\r\nafter the preparations are made.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 260, 19 S.E.2d at 103.[3]&nbsp;\r\nWe agree with the court of appeals that the Quick framework remains viable in the emerging area of Internet sex crimes.&nbsp; While we have not\r\npreviously had occasion to address the mere preparation-overt act distinction in the context of an alleged attempted sex crime stemming from use of the\r\nInternet, the court of appeals canvassed the law from other jurisdictions.&nbsp; The majority of jurisdictions that have confronted this issue have concluded\r\nthat an agreement to meet a fictitious minor at a designated place and time, coupled with traveling to that location, may constitute evidence of an overt act.[4]&nbsp; We agree with the majority approach and hold that an agreement to meet a fictitious minor at a designated\r\nplace and time, coupled with traveling to that location, may constitute evidence of an overt act, beyond mere preparation, in furtherance of the crime.&nbsp; We\r\ndo not, however, create a categorical rule.\r\nGiven Petitioner's express desire for a sexual encounter with a fourteen-year-old minor, coupled with his designation of a vacant parking lot in the middle\r\nof the night as the clandestine meeting placeâ€”and his travel to that placeâ€”we concur with the court of appeals that a jury question was presented on whether\r\nPetitioner had the specific intent to commit CSC with a minor and whether his conduct constituted an overt act.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The court of appeals' opinion correctly sets forth the proper standard of review when considering a\r\nchallenge to a trial court's denial of a directed verdict motion.&nbsp; Reid, 383 S.C. at 292, 679 S.E.2d at 197.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Quick did not involve an attempt crime, but its analysis of the mere preparation-overt act\r\ndistinction has been applied in the attempt context.&nbsp; See Nesbitt, 346 S.C. at 231, 550 S.E.2d at 866-67.\r\n[3]&nbsp; In Nesbitt, the court of appeals considered the overt act requirement in the armed robbery\r\ncontext and adopted this language from Quick.&nbsp; The court of appeals held that approaching a convenience store masked and armed constituted an overt\r\nact for purposes of attempt.&nbsp; Nesbitt, 346 S.C. at 235, 550 S.E.2d at 868.&nbsp;\r\n[4]&nbsp; These jurisdictions employ various testsâ€”primarily the substantial step testâ€”to determine whether\r\nthe defendant has moved beyond mere preparation.&nbsp; See United States v. Farner, 251 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2001) (defendant took substantial step\r\ntoward committing crime by arranging and traveling to meet fictitious minor); Kirwan v. State, 96 S.W.3d 724 (Ark. 2003) (defendant's arranging to meet\r\nfictitious minor for sexual relations and traveling constituted substantial step); People v. Reed, 61 Cal. Rptr. 2d 658 (Cal. Ct.

App. 2003) (arranging a meeting place and time for the\r\npurpose of sexual activity with a purported minor and arriving with condoms sufficient for overt act); People v. Patterson, 734 N.E.2d 462, 470 (Ill.\r\nApp. Ct. 2000) (arranging to travel for sexual relations with decoy minor, combined with actual traveling to agreed-upon place constituted substantial step;\r\n&quot;defendant had taken every possible step he could have taken in order to commit the offense&quot;); State v. Peterman, 118 P.3d 1267, 1273 (Kan.\r\n2005) (&quot;[Defendant's] act of driving . . . to pick up a child for the purpose of sexual intercourse constituted an overt act beyond mere\r\npreparations.&nbsp; [Defendant] went as far as he could toward completing his criminal intentions prior to discovering that the child victim was\r\nfictional.&quot;); State v. Risinger, 194 P.3d 52 (Kan. Ct. App. 2008) (engaging in online conversations with fictitious child victim, arranging a\r\nmeeting, driving to agreed-upon location, and knocking on door sufficient for overt act); Commonwealth v.

App. Ct. 2006)\r\n(finding sufficient evidence of overt act where defendant agreed to pay undercover officer $200 to permit him to engage in sexual relations with five-year-old\r\nchild, made arrangements to meet undercover officer, and traveled to meeting place); State v. Tarbay, 810 N.E.2d 979 (Ohio Ct. App. 2004) (defendant's\r\narranging to meet fifteen-year-old to engage in sexual relations and traveling to meeting place constitutes a substantial step); Cook v.

Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\n        Diedreich P. von Lehe, III, of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  The Town of Mount Pleasant (&quot;Town&quot;)\r\n  appeals the circuit court's order reversing and dismissing Treva Roberts's\r\n  municipal court conviction for driving under the influence (&quot;DUI&quot;)[1] on the ground the arresting officer's vehicle was not equipped with a video\r\n  camera pursuant to section 56-5-2953 of the South Carolina Code.[2] Â The Town contends the circuit court erred in:Â  (1) ruling on the appeal as it\r\n  was divested of appellate jurisdiction given Roberts failed to obtain a bond or\r\n  pay her court-ordered fine prior to initiating her appeal; and (2)\r\n  &quot;narrowly construing&quot; section 56-5-2953 to require the reversal of\r\n  Roberts's DUI conviction and dismissal of the charge.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn November 11, 2007, at approximately 1:00 a.m.,\r\n  Officer Bruce Burbage of the Town of Mount Pleasant's Police Department\r\n  conducted a traffic stop of Roberts after observing her driving erratically.Â  As\r\n  a result of his initial observations, Officer Burbage conducted three field\r\n  sobriety tests, on which he noted Roberts &quot;performed pretty poorly.&quot; Â Â Â Â \r\nSubsequently, Officer Burbage arrested Roberts for DUI\r\n  and transported her to the Mount Pleasant Police Department where Roberts was\r\n  offered, but refused, a breathalyzer test.Â  There was no recording of the\r\n  initial traffic stop, field sobriety tests, or the arrest as neither Officer\r\n  Burbage's vehicle nor the backup officer's was equipped with a video camera.[3]\r\nIn response to Roberts's discovery motions,[4] which included a request for production of the incident site videotape, the\r\n  Town's prosecutor forwarded an &quot;Affidavit for Failure to Produce\r\n  Videotape&quot; executed by Officer Burbage on October 16, 2009.Â  The\r\n  affidavit, a form generated by the Town, included a &quot;checked&quot; box\r\n  that stated:\r\n\r\n  At the time of the Defendant's arrest the vehicle I\r\n    was operating had not been equipped with a videotaping device and therefore\r\n    pursuant to Section 18 of Senate Bill 174 of 1998,[5] the videotaping requirement regarding vehicles is not applicable.\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  October 30, 2009, a municipal court judge conducted a jury trial on Roberts's\r\n  DUI charge.Â  Prior to trial, Roberts moved to dismiss the charge based on\r\n  Officer Burbage's failure to videotape the entire arrest pursuant to section\r\n  56-5-2953.Â  Roberts asserted that section 56-5-2953 conferred upon her a\r\n  statutory right to have the roadside arrest videotaped.Â  Because Officer\r\n  Burbage failed to comply with the statutorily-mandated procedure, Roberts\r\n  claimed this violation warranted the dismissal of her DUI charge.Â  The motion\r\n  to dismiss was denied.\r\nThe Town relied on subsection (G) of the statute for\r\n  the proposition that the videotaping requirement took effect only &quot;once\r\n  the law enforcement vehicle is equipped with a videotaping device.&quot;[6]Â \r\n  Because Officer Burbage's vehicle was not equipped with a video camera, the\r\n  Town argued that the videotaping provisions of section 56-5-2953 were\r\n  inapplicable and, thus, the failure to videotape Roberts's arrest did not\r\n  warrant the dismissal of the DUI charge.[7]Â  \r\n In\r\n  support of her motion, Roberts called several law enforcement officers from\r\n  Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester counties in an attempt to establish that\r\n  the Town had fewer video cameras than other municipalities despite the Town's\r\n  significantly higher number of DUI arrests.[8]Â \r\n  Given these statistics, Roberts argued that the Town had willfully avoided\r\n  complying with the 1998 statute as it had not requested from the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Public Safety (DPS) additional video cameras in response to the\r\n  increasing number of DUI arrests.Â  Roberts also offered evidence that the Town\r\n  was financially able to purchase additional video cameras, but had chosen not\r\n  to do so.[9]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Town countered Roberts's arguments by claiming that DPS was solely responsible\r\n  for providing the video cameras and, thus, the Town did not have a duty to request\r\n  or purchase additional cameras in order to comply with the statute.[10] \r\nAt\r\n  the conclusion of the pre-trial hearing, the municipal court judge denied\r\n  Roberts's motion to dismiss based on a &quot;strict interpretation&quot; of\r\n  section 56-5-2953.Â  In his written return, the judge concluded that &quot;there\r\n  is no requirement that the Town of Mount Pleasant obtain any video cameras and\r\n  that the statute only provides what the Town must do once they get the video\r\n  cameras on board.&quot;Â  Further, the judge ruled that &quot;Section\r\n  56-5-2953(G) indicated that the other provisions of [the statute] take effect .\r\n  . . once the vehicle is equipped with a [videotaping] device.&quot;Â  \r\n Roberts\r\n  was convicted and appealed her conviction to the circuit court, arguing the\r\n  municipal court judge erred in denying her motion to dismiss the charge based\r\n  upon the Town's failure to comply with the &quot;mandatory&quot; videotaping\r\n  provisions of section 56-5-2953.Â  \r\nThe Town moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of\r\n  jurisdiction based on Roberts's failure to obtain a bond or pay the\r\n  court-ordered fine prior to initiating the appeal.Â  The Town contended the\r\n  circuit court was without jurisdiction to rule on the appeal given Roberts did\r\n  not comply with the procedural requirements of section 14-25-95 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code,[11] which governs appeals from municipal court to circuit court. \r\nThe circuit court judge issued a written order in\r\n  which it reversed Roberts's DUI conviction and dismissed the charge.Â  The judge\r\n  initially determined that it had &quot;subject matter jurisdiction&quot; to\r\n  hear the appeal.Â  In so ruling, the judge found jurisdiction was vested in the\r\n  circuit court when Roberts timely filed and served her notice of appeal as\r\n  required by section 14-25-95.Â  The judge further concluded that Roberts's\r\n  &quot;non-entry into a bond and non-payment of the fine assessed [did] not\r\n  deprive [the court] of the subject matter jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Additionally,\r\n  the judge held that all issues with respect to the non-entry into a bond or\r\n  non-payment of the fine were moot as Roberts had appeared at the hearing and\r\n  paid her fine the day of the hearing.Â  \r\nAs to the merits of Roberts's appeal, the judge specifically\r\n  found that the videotaping requirements of section 56-5-2953 were mandatory\r\n  based on this Court's decision in City of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374\r\n  S.C. 12, 646 S.E.2d 879 (2007).[12]Â \r\n  Interpreting subsection (G) of the statute, the judge concluded that this\r\n  provision was &quot;merely to provide a reasonable grace period for law\r\n  enforcement agencies to equip their vehicles with video recording\r\n  devices.&quot;Â  The judge explained that to construe subsection (G) as proposed\r\n  by the Town would permit law enforcement agencies to &quot;successfully\r\n  circumvent [the statute's videotaping requirements] ad infinitum&quot;\r\n  by not requesting video cameras from DPS.Â  \r\nThe judge also ruled that the Town's failure to\r\n  produce a videotape of Roberts's conduct at the incident site was not\r\n  &quot;excused&quot; as none of the enumerated exceptions in subsection (B) of\r\n  section 56-5-2953[13] were satisfied.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The\r\n  judge concluded that the Town's failure to comply with the videotaping\r\n  requirements a decade after the enactment of section 56-5-2953 was\r\n  &quot;unreasonable&quot; and constituted a violation of the statute that\r\n  warranted the reversal of Roberts's conviction and the dismissal of the DUI\r\n  charge.Â  \r\nThe Town appealed the circuit court's order to the\r\n  Court of Appeals.Â  This Court certified the case from the Court of Appeals\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard of Review\r\n&quot;In criminal appeals from a municipal\r\n  court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo review; rather, it reviews\r\n  the case for preserved errors raised to it by an appropriate exception.&quot;Â  City\r\n    of Cayce v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 391 S.C. 395, 399, 706 S.E.2d 6, 8 (2011); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-105 (Supp. 2010) (&quot;There\r\n      shall be no trial de novo on any appeal from a municipal court.&quot;). &quot;Therefore, our scope of review is limited to\r\n  correcting the circuit court's order for errors of law.&quot;Â  Suchenski,\r\n  374 S.C. at 15, 646 S.E.2d at 880.\r\nB.Â  Appellate Jurisdiction\r\nAs a threshold matter, we must address the Town's\r\n  jurisdictional challenge as any defect in the circuit court's appellate\r\n  jurisdiction would necessarily affect this Court's jurisdiction to rule on the\r\n  Town's appeal.Â  \r\nThe Town asserts the circuit court judge erred in\r\n  characterizing its jurisdictional challenge as one that implicated subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction rather than appellate jurisdiction.Â  The Town avers the\r\n  circuit court judge did not have appellate jurisdiction to rule on Roberts's\r\n  appeal given Roberts failed to either pay the court-ordered fine or obtain a\r\n  bond prior to initiating her appeal to the circuit court.Â  Under the Town's\r\n  interpretation of section 14-25-95, the circuit court could only be vested with\r\n  appellate jurisdiction if one of the above-listed prerequisites was satisfied.\r\nBecause our analysis of this issue and the\r\n  Town's second issue is dependent upon our evaluation of the applicable\r\n  statutes, we begin with an overview of this state's well-established rules of\r\n  statutory construction.\r\n1.\r\n&quot;The primary\r\n  rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of\r\n  the legislature.&quot; Â Bryant v. State, 384 S.C. 525, 529, 683 S.E.2d\r\n  280, 282 (2009).Â  When a statute is penal in nature, it must be strictly\r\n  construed against the State and in favor of the defendant.Â  State v.\r\n    Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991). Â However, &quot;[a]ll\r\n  rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative\r\n  intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used,\r\n  and that language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the\r\n  statute.&quot;Â  State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339, 351, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575\r\n  (2010) (citation omitted).\r\nIn ascertaining legislative intent, &quot;a\r\n  court should not focus on any single section or provision but should consider\r\n  the language of the statute as a whole.&quot; Â Mid-State Auto Auction of\r\n    Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  Where\r\n  the statute's language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear, definite\r\n  meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has\r\n  no right to impose another meaning.Â  Gay v. Ariail, 381 S.C. 341, 345,\r\n  673 S.E.2d 418, 420 (2009).\r\nIf the\r\n  statute is ambiguous, however, courts must construe the terms of the statute.Â  Lester\r\n    v. S.C. Workers' Comp. Comm'n, 334 S.C. 557, 561, 514 S.E.2d 751, 752\r\n  (1999).Â  &quot;A statute as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and\r\n  fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of\r\n  lawmakers.&quot; Â Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 370\r\n  S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606-07 (2006).Â  In interpreting a statute, the\r\n  language of the statute must be read in a sense that harmonizes with its\r\n  subject matter and accords with its general purpose.Â  Hitachi Data Sys.\r\n    Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).\r\n&quot;Any ambiguity in a statute should be\r\n  resolved in favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial operation of the law.&quot;Â  Bennett v. Sullivan's Island Bd. of Adjustment, 313 S.C. 455, 458, 438\r\n  S.E.2d 273, 274 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Courts will reject a\r\n  statutory interpretation that would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it\r\n  could not have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain\r\n  legislative intention.Â  Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 368,\r\n  529 S.E.2d 280, 283 (2000).\r\n2.\r\nAs an initial matter, we agree with the Town's\r\n  argument that the circuit court judge erred in classifying the jurisdictional\r\n  challenge as one of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See Great Games,\r\n    Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 339 S.C. 79, 83 n.5, 529 S.E.2d 6, 8 n.5\r\n  (2000) (&quot;The failure of a party to comply with the procedural requirements\r\n  for perfecting an appeal may deprive the court of 'appellate' jurisdiction over\r\n  the case, but it does not affect the court's subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.&quot;); see also State v. Brown, 358 S.C. 382, 596\r\n  S.E.2d 39 (2004) (recognizing that failure to timely appeal a conviction from\r\n  magistrate court does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction).\r\nClearly, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  to hear and determine Roberts's appeal from her municipal court conviction as\r\n  the Legislature has specifically authorized it to do so.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 14-5-340 (1977) (&quot;Circuit judges may hear appeals from magistrates'\r\n  courts and municipal courts to the court of general sessions and the court of\r\n  common pleas, upon notice as required by law being given for the hearing of\r\n  such appeals.&quot;); S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11 (&quot;The Circuit Court shall\r\n  be a general trial court with original jurisdiction in civil and criminal\r\n  cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction shall be given to\r\n  inferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as provided by law.&quot;).\r\nAs for the circuit court's appellate jurisdiction, we\r\n  find that Roberts properly met the prerequisites of section 14-25-95.Â  Pursuant\r\n  to this Code section, Roberts was required to file her notice of appeal with\r\n  the municipal court &quot;within ten days after sentence is passed or judgment\r\n  rendered, or the appeal is considered waived.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 14-25-95.Â Â \r\n  There is no dispute that Roberts timely filed her appeal with the municipal\r\n  court.Â  Having met this procedural prerequisite, the circuit court was vested\r\n  with appellate jurisdiction to determine Roberts's appeal.Â  Cf. Town\r\n    of Hilton Head Island v. Goodwin, 370 S.C. 221, 224, 634 S.E.2d 59, 61 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (&quot;A party who fails to timely appeal or take any other timely\r\n  action necessary to correct an error is procedurally barred from contesting the\r\n  validity of the conviction.&quot;).\r\nUnlike the Town, we do not believe the circuit court\r\n  was divested of appellate jurisdiction because Roberts failed to obtain a bond\r\n  or pay her court-ordered fine prior to filing her notice of appeal with the\r\n  municipal court.Â  These two provisions of section 14-25-95 do not implicate\r\n  jurisdiction as there is no temporal restriction in that sentence of the\r\n  statute. Â Instead, these provisions serve the purpose of insuring that an\r\n  appellant will appear for the hearing before the circuit court.Â  If an\r\n  appellant fails to comply with these provisions, the municipality may issue a\r\n  bench warrant to address any delinquency on the part of the appellant.\r\nFinally, we note that Roberts appeared at the hearing\r\n  and paid her fine; therefore, any related issue is moot.Â  See Linda\r\n    Mc Company, Inc. v. Shore, 390 S.C. 543, 557, 703 S.E.2d 499, 506 (2010) (&quot;A case becomes moot when judgment, if\r\n  rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon the existing controversy.\r\n  This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for the reviewing\r\n  Court to grant effectual relief.&quot; (citations omitted)).\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reversal of DUI conviction/Dismissal\r\n  of DUI charge \r\nHaving found that the circuit court was vested with\r\n  appellate jurisdiction, we must next decide whether the Town's violation of the\r\n  videotaping provisions of section 56-5-2953 warranted the reversal of Roberts's\r\n  DUI conviction and the dismissal of the charge.\r\nAlthough this is the specific question presented, we\r\n  believe there is a more fundamental question to consider in analyzing section\r\n  56-5-2953:Â  if the Legislature imposes a statutory obligation on the State to\r\n  create evidence and provides a sanction for inexcusable noncompliance, does the\r\n  State's failure to do so necessarily warrant a per se dismissal\r\n  of the accused's case?\r\nUp until this point, our\r\n  appellate courts have affirmatively answered this question when a law\r\n  enforcement agency inexcusably failed to videotape a DUI arrest with an existing video camera.Â  In the instant case, the Town failed to create a videotape of\r\n  Roberts's DUI arrest because the patrol vehicle had never been equipped with a video camera.\r\nThe Town argues the circuit court judge erred in\r\n  construing section 56-5-2953 to require the dismissal of Roberts's DUI charge\r\n  on the basis that the arresting officer's vehicle was not equipped with a video\r\n  camera. \r\nApplying the rules of statutory construction, the Town\r\n  maintains that in promulgating section 56-5-2953 the Legislature clearly\r\n  provided for instances where an incident site videotape would not be available\r\n  as demonstrated by certain statutory exceptions.[14]Â \r\n  Furthermore, because the Legislature mandated in subsection (D) that DPS would\r\n  supply the video cameras, the Town claims that it was not obligated to purchase\r\n  or request additional videotape equipment; thus, its failure to equip Officer\r\n  Burbage's vehicle with a camera rendered the mandatory provisions of section\r\n  56-5-2953 inapplicable pursuant to subsection (G).\r\nThe key case in the analysis of this issue is City\r\n  of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 646 S.E.2d 879 (2007).Â  In Suchenski,\r\n  the defendant was convicted in municipal court for driving with an unlawful\r\n  alcohol concentration (DUAC).Â  Id. at 14, 646 S.E.2d at 879.Â  On appeal,\r\n  the circuit court reversed the conviction based on the City of Rock Hill's\r\n  failure to videotape the defendant's entire arrest as the arresting officer's\r\n  camera &quot;ran out of tape.&quot;Â  Id. Â The circuit court did\r\n  not address whether the arresting officer's failure to comply with section\r\n  56-5-2953 was excused pursuant to an exception in subsection (B) of the\r\n  statute.Â  Id. at 14, 646 S.E.2d at 880.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This\r\n  Court affirmed the circuit court's decision.Â  In so ruling, we found that any\r\n  argument concerning the exceptions for noncompliance in section 56-5-2953(B)\r\n  was not preserved as the circuit court had not ruled on this issue and the City\r\n  of Rock Hill had not sought a post-judgment ruling regarding this issue.Â  Id. at 16, 646 S.E.2d at 880.Â  We also rejected the City of Rock Hill's contention\r\n  that a violation of the videotaping statute should not result in dismissal of a\r\n  charge if there was no showing of prejudice to the defendant.Â  Id. at\r\n  16, 646 S.E.2d at 881.Â  We found the plain language of the statute provided\r\n  that the &quot;failure to produce videotapes would be a ground for dismissal if\r\n  no exceptions apply.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nAlthough the decision in Suchenski indisputably\r\n  established that the videotaping provisions of section 56-5-2953 are mandatory\r\n  and not optional, we did not address whether the failure to comply with the\r\n  statute could be excusable if the law enforcement vehicle was never equipped\r\n  with a camera.Â  Specifically, we were not required to assess the import of subsection\r\n  (G) with respect to the statutory exceptions of subsection (B).\r\nSubsection (B) of section 56-5-2953 outlines several\r\n  statutory exceptions that excuse noncompliance with the mandatory videotaping\r\n  requirements. Noncompliance is excusable:Â  (1) if the arresting officer submits\r\n  a sworn affidavit certifying the video equipment was inoperable despite efforts\r\n  to maintain it; (2) if the arresting officer submits a sworn affidavit that it\r\n  was impossible to produce the videotape because the defendant either (a) needed\r\n  emergency medical treatment or (b) exigent circumstances existed; (3) in\r\n  circumstances including, but not limited to, road blocks, traffic accidents,\r\n  and citizens' arrests; or (4) for any other valid reason for the failure to\r\n  produce the videotape based upon the totality of the circumstances.\r\nOur appellate courts have strictly construed section\r\n  56-5-2953 and found that a law enforcement agency's failure to comply with\r\n  these provisions is fatal to the prosecution of a DUI case.Â  See Suchenski;\r\n  374 S.C. at 17, 646 S.E.2d at 881 (holding that &quot;dismissal of the DUAC\r\n  charge is an appropriate remedy provided by section 56-5-2953 where a violation\r\n  of subsection (A) is not mitigated by subsection (B) exceptions&quot;); Murphy\r\n    v. State, Op. No. 4816 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Apr. 6, 2011) (Shearouse Adv.\r\n  Sh. No. 13 at 49) (recognizing the State's noncompliance with section 56-5-2953,\r\n  which is not mitigated by a statutory exception, warranted dismissal; holding\r\n  that video complied with section 56-5-2953(A) even though it did not capture a\r\n  continuous full view of the accused at the incident site (citing Suchenski)).\r\nAlthough our appellate courts have acknowledged these\r\n  statutory &quot;escape valves,&quot; they have so far considered their\r\n  application only where a law enforcement agency failed to create a video\r\n  recording of the DUI arrest because the video camera malfunctioned.Â  Our courts,\r\n  however, have not analyzed whether these exceptions apply where the law\r\n  enforcement vehicle has never been equipped with a video camera as in the\r\n  instant case.\r\nTaking into consideration the purpose of section\r\n  56-5-2953, which is to create direct evidence of a DUI arrest, we find the\r\n  Town's protracted failure to equip its patrol vehicles with video cameras,\r\n  despite its &quot;priority&quot; ranking, defeats the intent of the Legislature\r\n  and violates the statutorily-created obligation to videotape DUI arrests.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we do not believe that the Town should be able to continually evade\r\n  its duty by relying on subsection (G) of section 56-5-2953.Â  Thus, we hold that\r\n  the Town's failure to equip its patrol vehicles does not negate the application\r\n  of the statutory exceptions in subsection (B).\r\nUnder the specific facts of this case, we find the\r\n  Town failed to satisfy any of the above-outlined statutory exceptions.Â \r\n  Significantly, the Town conceded in municipal court and before the circuit\r\n  court that the initial three exceptions did not apply and could not justify its\r\n  failure to videotape Roberts's DUI arrest.Â  \r\nThus, the only feasible exception is that there was a\r\n  &quot;valid reason&quot; for the Town's failure to comply with the mandatory\r\n  videotaping requirements.Â  Although the Town did not explicitly reference this\r\n  provision, it argued that Officer Burbage's patrol vehicle was not equipped\r\n  with a video camera because DPS had not supplied the Town with a sufficient\r\n  number of cameras and the Town was not obligated to expend funds to purchase\r\n  the cameras.Â  \r\nAs we interpret the circuit court judge's order, we do\r\n  not discern a ruling that the Town was obligated to purchase the cameras with\r\n  its own funds.Â  Instead, the circuit court judge imposed an obligation on the\r\n  Town to request additional video cameras given the Town's &quot;high\r\n  ranking&quot; for DUI arrests as compared to other municipalities. \r\nConsequently, the question becomes whether the Town's\r\n  failure to request additional video cameras constituted a &quot;valid reason\r\n  for the failure to produce the videotape based upon the totality of the\r\n  circumstances.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 56-5-2953(B).Â  We find the Town's explanation\r\n  is disingenuous given its significantly higher number of DUI arrests as\r\n  compared to smaller municipalities.[15]Â \r\n  Moreover, the Town's interpretation of subsection (G) is nonsensical as the\r\n  requirements of section 56-5-2953 could be circumvented in perpetuity if a law\r\n  enforcement agency purposefully does not request additional video cameras. \r\nAdmittedly, the Legislature was silent with respect to\r\n  a time requirement for when vehicles must be equipped with video cameras. Â However,\r\n  applying the rules of statutory construction, we find the Town's interpretation\r\n  would defeat the legislative intent of section 56-5-2953 and the overall DUI\r\n  reform enacted in 1998. \r\nFinding that neither subsection (G) nor the statutory\r\n  exceptions in subsection (B) excuse the Town's noncompliance with section\r\n  56-5-2953, the question becomes whether the failure to videotape a DUI arrest\r\n  warrants a per se dismissal of the DUI case or whether, as the\r\n  Town contends, the accused must establish that he or she was prejudiced.\r\nAs evidenced by this Court's decision in Suchenski,\r\n  the Legislature clearly intended for a per se dismissal in the\r\n  event a law enforcement agency violates the mandatory provisions of section\r\n  56-5-2953.Â  Notably, the Legislature specifically provided for the dismissal of\r\n  a DUI charge unless the law enforcement agency can justify its failure to\r\n  produce a videotape of a DUI arrest.Â  Id. Â§ 56-5-2953(B) (&quot;Failure\r\n  by the arresting officer to produce the videotapes required by this section is\r\n  not alone a ground for dismissal of any charge made pursuant to Section 56-5-2930\r\n  . . . if [certain exceptions are met].&quot;).Â  The term &quot;dismissal&quot;\r\n  is significant as it explicitly designates a sanction for an agency's failure\r\n  to adhere to the requirements of section 56-5-2953.Â  \r\nFurthermore, it is instructive that the Legislature\r\n  has not mandated videotaping in any other criminal context.Â  Despite the\r\n  potential significance of videotaping oral confessions, the Legislature has not\r\n  required the State to do so.Â  By requiring a law enforcement agency to videotape\r\n  a DUI arrest, the Legislature clearly intended strict compliance with the\r\n  provisions of section 56-5-2953 and, in turn, promulgated a severe sanction for\r\n  noncompliance.\r\nThus, we hold that dismissal is the appropriate\r\n  sanction in the instant case as this was clearly intended by the Legislature\r\n  and previously decided by this Court in Suchenski.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Our\r\n  decision should in no way be construed as eradicating subsection (G) of section\r\n  56-5-2953.Â  Instead, we emphasize that subsection (G) is still viable and must\r\n  be read in conjunction with subsection (B) as these exceptions, under the\r\n  appropriate factual circumstances, could operate to excuse a law enforcement\r\n  agency's noncompliance due to the failure to equip a patrol vehicle with a\r\n  video camera. Â For example, we can conceive of a scenario where a law\r\n  enforcement agency establishes a &quot;valid reason&quot; for failing to create\r\n  a video of the incident site by offering documentation that, despite concerted\r\n  efforts to request video cameras, it has not been supplied with the cameras from\r\n  DPS.\r\nIII. Conclusion\r\nIn conclusion, the circuit\r\n  court judge erred in classifying the Town's jurisdictional challenge as one\r\n  involving subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Because Roberts timely served her\r\n  notice of appeal on the municipal court, she met the procedural requirements of\r\n  section 14-25-95; thus, her failure to obtain a bond or pay the court-ordered\r\n  fine did not divest the circuit court of appellate jurisdiction.\r\nAs to the merits, we find the\r\n  Town's prolonged failure to equip its patrol vehicles with video cameras defeats\r\n  the intent of the Legislature; therefore, the Town should not be able to avoid\r\n  its statutorily-created obligation to produce a videotape by repeatedly relying\r\n  on subsection (G) of section 56-5-2953.Â  Because the Town failed to establish\r\n  any statutory exception to excuse its noncompliance, we hold the circuit court judge\r\n  correctly reversed Roberts's DUI conviction and dismissed the charge.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm as modified the decision of the circuit court judge.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  S.C.

Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953 (2006). Â This section was amended effective\r\n  February 10, 2009.Â  Act No. 201, 2008 S.C. Acts 1682-85.Â  Accordingly, we have\r\n  cited to the 2006 Code as the amended statute is not applicable to the instant\r\n  case.\r\n[3] Â At the time of Roberts's arrest, the &quot;best case\r\n  scenario&quot; was that only two of the Town's twelve police department\r\n  vehicles on patrol that night were camera-equipped.Â  According to the annual\r\n  inventory records of the South Carolina Department of Public Safety, the Town in\r\n  2007 had a total of seven in-car camera systems, of which one was acquired in\r\n  2001 and the remaining six in 2002. \r\n[4]Â  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); Rule 5,\r\n  SCRCrimP.\r\n[5]Â  Section 18 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  The provisions in Section 56-5-2953(A), (B), and (C)\r\n    take effect for each law enforcement vehicle used for traffic enforcement as\r\n    soon as the law enforcement vehicle used for traffic enforcement is equipped\r\n    with a videotaping device.\r\n\r\nAct No. 434, 1998 S.C. Acts 3236.\r\n[6]Â Â  Subsection (G)Â  provides\r\n  in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  The provisions contained in Section 56-5-2953(A), (B), and (C) take effect for each law\r\n    enforcement vehicle used for traffic enforcement once the law enforcement\r\n    vehicle is equipped with a videotaping device. \r\n\r\nId. Â§ 56-5-2953(G).\r\n[7]Â  As will be discussed, this argument would be valid\r\n  but for the Town's obvious intentional efforts to avoid complying with section\r\n  56-5-2953.\r\n[8] Â According to records produced by the South Carolina\r\n  Law Enforcement Division (SLED), the Town made 2,796 DUI arrests between 1998\r\n  and 2008.Â  Based on these arrest records, the Town ranked first out of all\r\n  municipalities for total DUI arrests.Â  The Department of Public Safety used\r\n  these statistics to determine the priority for issuing additional video\r\n  cameras; thus, law enforcement agencies with the &quot;highest ranking&quot;\r\n  for DUI arrests received priority in terms of the issuance of additional video\r\n  cameras.\r\nÂ Â  Â Despite these statistics, several nearby municipalities with fewer\r\n  DUI arrests had received more video cameras from DPS than the Town, for\r\n  example:Â  (1) the City of Folly Beach made 162 DUI arrests and received 6\r\n  cameras; (2) the Town of Moncks Corner made 198 DUI arrests and received 13\r\n  cameras; and (3) the City of the Isle of Palms made 339 DUI arrests and\r\n  received 13 cameras.\r\n[9]Â  Roberts offered evidence that the Town had recently\r\n  expended:Â  (1) $65,145 for the replacement of a &quot;Town of Mt.\r\n  Pleasant&quot; sign at the Long Point Road Exit of I-526 East; (2) $100,000 for\r\n  a marketing firm's development of a new Town slogan and logo; (3) $1,328,064.70\r\n  for the renovation of the &quot;Farmer's Market&quot; on Coleman Boulevard; and\r\n  (4) $6,000,000 for a parcel of property known as the &quot;O.K. Tire\r\n  Store,&quot; which was intended to be developed into a park.\r\n[10]Â Â  In support of its claim, the Town referenced\r\n  subsection (D) of section 56-5-2953, which states in\r\n  relevant part:\r\n\r\n  The Department of Public Safety is\r\n    responsible for purchasing, maintaining, and supplying all videotaping\r\n    equipment for use in all law enforcement vehicles used for traffic\r\n    enforcement.Â  The Department of Public Safety also is responsible for\r\n    monitoring all law enforcement vehicles used for traffic enforcement to ensure\r\n    proper maintenance of videotaping equipment.\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 56-5-2953(D).\r\n[11]Â Â  Section 14-25-95 provides:\r\n\r\n  Any party shall have the right to appeal\r\n    from the sentence or judgment of the municipal court to the Court of Common\r\n    Pleas of the county in which the trial is held. Â Notice of intention to appeal,\r\n    setting forth the grounds for appeal, must be given in writing and served on\r\n    the municipal judge or the clerk of the municipal court within ten days after\r\n    sentence is passed or judgment rendered, or the appeal is considered waived. Â The\r\n    party appealing shall enter into a bond, payable to the municipality, to appear\r\n    and defend the appeal at the next term of the Court of Common Pleas or shall\r\n    pay the fine assessed.\r\n\r\nS.C.

U.S. Army Corps of\r\n  Engineers, 121 S.Ct. 675 (2001).Â  As we explained in Spectre, LLC v.\r\n  S.C. Dep't of Health and Enviro. Cntrl., 386 S.C. 357, 688 S.E.2d 844\r\n  (2010), Solid Waste holds that the Corps may not regulate isolated\r\n  wetlands, but has no impact on DHEC's ability, as a state agency, to do so.Â \r\n  While Spectre decided DHEC's continuing authority under the coastal\r\n  management program developed pursuant to the statutory mandate found in the\r\n  Coastal Zone Management Act, this Act specifically defines the waters subject\r\n  to its regulation by DHEC to include isolated wetlands.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 48-1-10(2) (2008).\r\nWe find\r\n  the circuit court erred in holding DHEC lacked jurisdiction over the isolated\r\n  wetlands located on respondent's Pawleys Island lot.\r\nII.&nbsp; Compliance\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court also held that respondent &quot;complied with all of its legal\r\n  obligations prior to filling the isolated wetlands&quot; located on its lot.Â \r\n  The League argues, and we agree, that respondent was required to obtain a DHEC\r\n  permit under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-1-90(a) (2008) before it could lawfully fill\r\n  the wetlands by discharging &quot;orange sand&quot; into these wetlands.Â  See Â§ 48-1-10(6) (definition of fill substances requiring a DHEC permit includes\r\n  sand).\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We\r\n  reverse the circuit court's order finding that respondent complied with all\r\n  legal requirements for filling the wetlands as it is uncontroverted that it did\r\n  so without obtaining a permit from DHEC as required by the Act.\r\nIII.&nbsp;  Private Cause of\r\n  Action\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court dismissed the League's complaint, finding that there is no\r\n  private right of action under the Act, and thus the League lacked standing.Â  We\r\n  reverse.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  determining whether a statute creates a private cause of action, the main\r\n  factor is legislative intent[.]&quot;Â  Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 396,\r\n  645 S.E.2d 245, 248 (2007).Â  Legislative intent to grant or withhold a private\r\n  right of action for a violation of the statute is determined primarily from the\r\n  language of the statute.Â  Id.\r\nThe Act\r\n  provides that &quot;causes of action resulting from the violation of the\r\n  prohibitions contained in this chapter inure toâ€¦any person or persons damaged\r\n  as the result of any such violation.&quot;Â  Â§ 48-1-250.Â  The word\r\n  &quot;inure&quot; is defined, in part, as &quot;to become legally\r\n  effective&quot; and &quot;accrue.&quot;Â  Merriam-Webster's Third New Int'l\r\n  Dictionary 1188 (2002).Â  The League alleges that its members have been harmed\r\n  by respondent's unlawful filling of the wetlands in that the filling has\r\n  destroyed bird and wildlife habitats, impacting the members' ability to enjoy\r\n  their recreational and aesthetic interests, and that they have therefore been\r\n  damaged within the meaning of the Act.Â  We agree that the League had alleged\r\n  damages sufficient to allow it to maintain this suit pursuant to Â§ 48-1-250.[2]\r\n The\r\n  circuit court found there was no private cause of action based upon S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 48-1-220: &quot;Prosecutions for the violation of a final determination\r\n  or order shall be instituted only by [DHEC] or as otherwise provided for in\r\n  this chapter.&quot;Â  Here, there is neither a final determination nor an order.Â \r\n  Moreover, this suit cannot be characterized as a &quot;prosecution.&quot; Section\r\n  48-1-220 is irrelevant.\r\nWe find\r\n  the Act provides for a private cause of action in Â§ 48-1-250,[3] and reverse the\r\n  circuit court's order finding no such suit can be maintained by the League\r\n  under the Act.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n The\r\n  circuit court's order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur.Â  HEARN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\r\n  part, in a separate opinion, in which KITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE HEARN: I\r\n  agree with the majority that the circuit court erred in finding DHEC was\r\n  without authority to regulate these wetlands and that Smith did not violate the\r\n  South Carolina Pollution Control Act.Â  However, I believe the circuit court\r\n  correctly held that no private right of action was created under the Act and that\r\n  the League lacked standing to bring this lawsuit.Â  Therefore, I respectfully\r\n  concur in part and dissent in part.\r\nI.&nbsp; Private Right Of Action\r\nIn finding that a private right of action exists under\r\n  the Act, the majority ignores the controlling provision, section 48-1-90(b), as\r\n  well as scholarly interpretations of the Act, instead choosing to rely\r\n  exclusively on section 48-1-250.Â  That section is general in nature and merely\r\n  states that &quot;[c]auses of action resulting from the violation of the\r\n  prohibitions contained in this chapter inure to and are for the benefit of any\r\n  person or persons damaged as the result of any such violation.&quot;Â  In my\r\n  view, this general statement stops short of creating a private right of action\r\n  and actually presupposes that a valid cause of action is created elsewhere in\r\n  the Act.Â  However, the section under which the League brings this action\r\n  expressly limits who may bring such an action to State entities as opposed to\r\n  creating a private cause of action.Â  \r\nThe League alleges that Smith violated section\r\n  48-1-90(a) of the Act by dumping fill materials into the wetlands without first\r\n  obtaining a DHEC permit.Â Â  Subsection (b) of that provision unequivocally\r\n  states that actions for violations of subsection (a) &quot;shall be brought\r\n  by the State in its own name or in the name of the Department.&quot;\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  It further provides: &quot;the amount of any judgment for\r\n  damages recovered by the State, less cost, shall be remitted to the agency,\r\n  commission, department or political subdivision of the State that has\r\n  jurisdiction over . . . the wildlife or plant life damaged or destroyed.&quot; Id.Â \r\n  Lastly, subsection (b) states: &quot;[t]he civil remedy herein provided shall\r\n  not be exclusive, and any agency, commission, department or political\r\n  subdivision of the State with appropriate authority may undertake in its own\r\n  name an action to recover such damages as it may deem advisable independent of\r\n  this subsection.&quot;Â  Thus, contrary to the view of the majority, the plain\r\n  language of section 48-1-90(b) does not permit any entity other than the State\r\n  or its agencies, commissions, departments, or political subdivisions to bring\r\n  the cause of action asserted by the League here.Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, at least one environmental scholar has\r\n  stated that no private cause of action is created under the Act. See Randy\r\n  Lowell, Private Actions and Marine and Water Resources: Protection, Recovery\r\n  and Remediation, 8 S.C. Envtl. L.J. 143, 196 n.369 (2000) (&quot;[I]n South\r\n  Carolina, the Pollution Control Act was originally enacted in 1950 and is\r\n  extremely broad in scope. . . . However, there, is no private right of\r\n  action, leaving enforcement strictly to the state. . . . [C]itizens and\r\n  environmental groups must rely on keeping a constant vigil on developments in\r\n  their communities and become parties in the permit process to protect their\r\n  rights in administrative hearings.&quot;) (emphasis added).\r\nThe majority's sole reliance on section 48-1-250\r\n  ignores the section of the Act on which the League brought this action, a\r\n  section which includes a specific provision on the precise issue at hand:\r\n  whether or not a private right of action is created.Â  Moreover, the majority's misplaced\r\n  reliance on section 48-1-250 improperly accords controlling weight to a general\r\n  statute where there is a narrow, more specific statute that permits only State\r\n  entities to pursue the very remedy sought by the League in this case. See\r\n  Spectre, LLC v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Evnt'l Control, 386 S.C. 357,\r\n  372, 688 S.E.2d 844, 852 (2010) (&quot;Where\r\n  there is one statute addressing an issue in general terms and another statute\r\n  dealing with the identical issue in a more specific and definite manner, the\r\n  more specific statute will be considered an exception to, or a qualifier of,\r\n  the general statute and given such effect.&quot;).Â  It is therefore of no moment that section 48-1-90(b)\r\n  &quot;does not purport to limit a private party's right to seek remedies other\r\n  than damages&quot;; because subsection (b) specifically limits the enforcement\r\n  of the provisions of subsection (a) to certain actions by the State, I would\r\n  not presume that the public has an unfettered right to enforce this subsection\r\n  in all other instances. See Whitworth v. Fast Fare Mkts., 289 S.C. 418,\r\n  420, 338 S.E.2d 155, 156 (1985) (&quot;[T]he general rule is that a statute\r\n  which does not purport to establish a civil liability, but merely makes a\r\n  provision to secure the safety or welfare of the public as an entity is not\r\n  subject to a construction establishing a civil liability.&quot; (quoting 73 Am.\r\n  Jur. 2d Statutes Â§ 432 (1974)).Â  Accordingly, consistent with the\r\n  specific language in section 48-1-90(b), which I believe controls, as well as\r\n  scholarly interpretations of the Act, I would hold that no private right of\r\n  action exists for the claim raised by the League.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing\r\nAs an initial matter, the majority posits that the\r\n  issue of the League's standing to bring this action is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  While the majority is absolutely correct that standing was not argued\r\n  in the parties' briefs to this Court, the majority incorrectly states that it\r\n  was not raised to or ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  The circuit court's\r\n  order first specifically found that the Act does not create a private cause of\r\n  action.Â  The court then went on to find that notwithstanding this conclusion,\r\n  the League does not have standing to enforce the provisions of the Act.Â  While\r\n  I am cognizantÂ  that the circuit court, in a later part of its order, appeared\r\n  to conflate the issue of standing and the existence of a private right of\r\n  action,[4] this in no way diminishes its previous specific finding that the League lacks\r\n  standing even if the Act creates a private cause of action.Â  Because, as the\r\n  majority aptly recognizes, the League did not challenge this portion of the\r\n  order on appeal, the only preservation principle implicated is that the\r\n  League's lack of standing is the law of the case. See Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 160-61, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970)\r\n  (holding that an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).Â \r\n  Therefore, I would hold that the Leagueâ€™s lack of standing to bring this action\r\n  is the law of the case.\r\n Moreover,\r\n  even if this issue is properly before us and I were to agree with the majority\r\n  that the Act created a private right of action, I would affirm the circuit\r\n  court's holding on the merits that the League lacks standing.Â  The three-part\r\n  test to determine whether an individual or an entity has standing to bring a\r\n  lawsuit is as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  First, the plaintiff must have suffered an &quot;injury\r\n    in fact&quot;â€”an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete\r\n    and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not &quot;conjectural&quot; or &quot;hypothetical[.&quot;]\r\n    Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct\r\n    complained ofâ€”the injury has to be &quot;fairly . . . trace[able] to the\r\n    challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the\r\n    independent action of some third party not before the court.Â  Third, it must be\r\n    &quot;likely,&quot; as opposed to merely &quot;speculative,&quot; that the\r\n    injury will be &quot;redressed by a favorable decision.&quot;\r\n\r\nSea\r\n  Pines Ass'n for the Prot. of Wildlife, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Natural Res., 345 S.C. 594, 601, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2001)\r\n  (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-61 (1992)).Â \r\n  The linchpin of this analysis is that the plaintiff must have a personal stake\r\n  in the litigation, meaning he is the real party in interest. Id. at 600,\r\n  550 S.E.2d at 291.Â  In other words, the party seeking relief must have a real,\r\n  material, or substantial interest in the litigation, not a merely nominal or\r\n  technical one. Id.Â  &quot;Moreover, the injury must be of a personal\r\n  nature to the party bringing the action, not merely of a general nature which\r\n  is common to all members of the public.&quot; Joytime Distribs. &amp;\r\n  Amusement Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 639-40, 528 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1999).Â \r\n  The party asserting standing bears the burden of proving all of its elements. Sea\r\n  Pines, 345 S.C. at 601, 550 S.E.2d at 291.Â  However, this burden is &quot;substantially\r\n  more difficult&quot; where the party bringing the claim was not the object of\r\n  the action &quot;but rather seeks to challenge government action or inaction\r\n  because of the alleged illegality.&quot; Beaufort Realty Co. v. Beaufort\r\n  County, 346 S.C. 298, 301, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nI\r\n  would hold the League is unable to proceed against Smith in its own name.Â \r\n  Section 48-1-250 states any &quot;person or persons damaged&quot; by the\r\n  alleged violation of the Act may institute a suit.Â  The Act defines a &quot;person&quot;\r\n  as &quot;any individual, public or private corporation, political subdivision,\r\n  government agency, municipality, industry, copartnership, association, firm,\r\n  trust, estate, or any other legal entity whatsoever.&quot; Id. Â§\r\n  48-1-10(1).Â  The League is a validly registered non-profit organization under\r\n  the laws of South Carolina, and therefore it is a person under the Act.Â \r\n  However, the League only alleges that its members have suffered an injury and\r\n  not that it as an entity has been damaged.Â  Thus, the League has no right that\r\n  it can enforce in its own name and does not have individual standing.\r\n However, a party may bring an action either\r\n  in its own name as set forth above or, if certain criteria are met, in a\r\n  representative capacity.Â  &quot;When an organization is involved, the\r\n  organization has standing on behalf of its members if one or more of its\r\n  members will suffer an individual injury by virtue of the contested act.&quot; Sea\r\n  Pines, 345 S.C. at 600-01, 550 S.E.2d at 291 (citing Sierra Club v. Morton,\r\n  405 U.S. 727 (1972)).Â  To supplement the analysis for individual standing we\r\n  adopted from Lujan, the courts of this state have adopted another\r\n  three-part test from the United States Supreme Court regarding the standing of\r\n  an organization to bring a claim on behalf of its members: (1) its members\r\n  would have standing to sue individually; (2) the interests at stake are germane\r\n  to the organization's own interests and purpose; and (3) neither the claim\r\n  asserted nor the relief sought requires the involvement of individual members. Beaufort\r\n  Realty, 346 S.C. at 301, 551 S.E.2d at 589 (citing Hunt v. Wash. State\r\n  Apple Adver. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)).\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    doctrine of associational standing recognizes that the primary reason people\r\n    join an organization is often to create an effective vehicle for vindicating\r\n    interests that they share with others.Â  &quot;The only practical judicial\r\n    policy when people pool their capital, their interests, or their activities\r\n    under a name and form that will identify collective interests, often is to\r\n    permit the association or corporation in a single case to vindicate the\r\n    interests of all.&quot;\r\n\r\nInt'l\r\n  Union, United Auto, Aerospace, &amp; Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 290 (1986) (quoting Joint\r\n  Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 187 (1951) (Jackson,\r\n  J., concurring)).Â  As Brock made clear, the policy behind permitting\r\n  associational standing is to allow a group with shared resources to pursue a\r\n  common, collective interest.Â  Accordingly, our analysis must center on whether\r\n  the organization seeks to enforce the rights of the group as a whole and not just\r\n  the right of an individual.\r\n Turning to the facts before us, I would find\r\n  the League satisfies the first two prongs of the Hunt test.Â  &quot;South\r\n  Carolina case law has specifically recognized an injury to one's aesthetic and\r\n  recreational interests in enjoying and observing wildlife is a judicially\r\n  cognizable injury in fact.&quot; Sea Pines, 345 S.C. at 601-02, 550\r\n  S.E.2d at 291-92.Â  With that in mind, I would have little trouble concluding\r\n  that individual members of the League can claim they suffered an injury in fact\r\n  as a result of Smith's actions that can likely be redressed under the Act.Â \r\n  Additionally, this interest is germane to the League's goal of furthering &quot;the\r\n  promotion of good government and the protection and conservation of natural\r\n  resources, sound planning and zoning practices and protection of the quality of\r\n  life within Georgetown County.&quot;\r\nHowever, the League fails to satisfy the\r\n  third prong of the Hunt test under my interpretation of it in light of\r\n  the purposes underlying associational standing.Â  In my view, in order to\r\n  satisfy this prong, the organization must show that the right it seeks to\r\n  vindicate is common to the membership and the interest of the harmed members in\r\n  the proceedings derives from their membership. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975) (&quot;[T]he association may assert the rights\r\n  of its members, at least so long as the challenged infractions adversely affect\r\n  its members' associational ties.&quot;); Creek Pointe Homeowners' Ass'n v.\r\n  Happ, 552 S.E.2d 220, 227 (N.C. Ct. App. 2002) (opining in dicta that the\r\n  plaintiff homeowner's association would have standing because its members'\r\n  claim of right vested through their membership in the association).Â  Although\r\n  the League has generally averred to the harm its &quot;members&quot; have\r\n  suffered and will continue to suffer as a result of Smith's actions, the\r\n  evidence adduced before the circuit court focused on just one of the League's\r\n  members, Sue Myers, and two of her neighbors who are not members of the\r\n  League.Â  There is no evidence in the record before us that anyone other than\r\n  the surrounding property owners were impacted by Smith's actions in filling in\r\n  the pond.Â  \r\nTherefore, the evidence presented by the\r\n  League demonstrated that Smith's actions affected only one member of the\r\n  League.Â  While harm to one member may be sufficient on different facts, even\r\n  assuming that the League could bring a cause of action under section 48-1-250,\r\n  that cause of action inures, by the statute's own terms, only to those damaged\r\n  as a result of a violation of the Act.Â  Although every member of the League\r\n  does enjoy the same right to enjoy wildlife, injury to one member's right does\r\n  not extend to the rest of the League.Â  With harm occurring to only one member\r\n  of the League and a cause of action thereby inuring only to that one member,\r\n  the right the League is pursuing under the Act is not a common one.Â  Further,\r\n  the harm suffered by Myers does not flow from her membership in the League, but\r\n  rather from her status as an individual, independent landowner.Â  While I\r\n  appreciate the League's interest in ensuring that the residents of Georgetown\r\n  County comply with this State's environmental laws, I would require more than a\r\n  laudable goal to establish standing.Â  Accordingly, I would hold that even if a\r\n  private right of action exists for violation of the Act, the League failed to\r\n  meet its burden of establishing standing to pursue this lawsuit.\r\nÂ  KITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-1-10 et seq. (2008 and Supp. 2010).\r\n[2] The dissent addresses the League's individual and associational standing to\r\n  maintain this suit.Â  This issue was neither raised nor ruled upon below, nor do\r\n  the parties mention it in their briefs.Â  There is no standing issue before the\r\n  Court other than that encompassed in the ruling that the Act does not create a\r\n  private cause of action.Â  Cf., South Carolina Dep't of Transp. v.\r\n  Horry County, 391 S.C. 76, 705 S.E.2d 21 (2011) (issues must be raised and\r\n  ruled upon to be preserved for appellate review).\r\n[3] The dissent would find there is no private cause of action under the Act based\r\n  upon Â§ 48-1-90(b). Â Leaving aside for the moment the fact that the circuit\r\n  court order rests exclusively and erroneously on Â§ 48-1-220, it is the true\r\n  that Â§ 90(b) grants the State a cause of action for violations of Â§\r\n  48-1-90(a).Â  That cause of action, however, is for damages for harm to &quot;fish,\r\n  shellfish, aquatic animals, wildlife or plant life.&quot;Â  Section 90(b) allows\r\n  other governmental agencies to bring actions for damages caused by a\r\n  violation of Â§ 90(a), but does not purport to limit a private party's right to\r\n  seek remedies other than damages, such as the declaratory and injunctive relief\r\n  sought by the League here.Â  Therefore, the right to maintain this private cause\r\n  of action is found in Â§ 48-1-250, and is not limited by anything in Â§ 48-1-220,\r\n  as was held by the circuit court, or in Â§ 48-1-90(b), as is posited by the\r\n  dissent.\r\n[4] These two concepts are quite different.Â  To have standing, an individual must\r\n  generally have a personal stake in the litigation or qualify as a real party in\r\n  interest.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 530, 511 S.E.2d 69,\r\n  75 (1999).Â  By contrast, the determination of whether a party has a private\r\n  right of action under a particular statute is merely a matter of legislative\r\n  intent.Â  See Overcash v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co, 364 S.C. 569, 576, 614\r\n  S.E.2d 619, 622 (2005) (&quot;The main factor in determining whether a statute\r\n  creates a private cause of action is legislative intent.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of David Ransom Lawson","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2011-07-05-01","description":"The Office of Disciplinary Counsel has filed a petition asking this Court to place respondent on interim suspension pursuant to Rule 17(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and seeking the appointment of an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.","date":"2011-07-11","type":"order","text":"\r\n  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody         { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif }\r\ntd           { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of David Ransom Lawson, Respondent.\r\n    \r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe Office of  Disciplinary Counsel has filed a petition asking this Court to place respondent  on interim suspension pursuant to Rule 17(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and  seeking the appointment of an attorney to protect respondent&rsquo;s clients&rsquo;  interests pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  IT IS ORDERED that  respondent&rsquo;s license to practice law in this state is suspended until further  order of the Court.\r\n  \r\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that  Philip A.

M.R.C.L., 390 S.C. 329, 701 S.E.2d 757 (Ct. App. 2010).Â  We\r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) initiated termination of\r\n  parental rights (TPR) proceedings against M.R.C.L. (mother) and R.L. (father).Â \r\n  Child was removed from mother and father's home in May 2007 due to allegations\r\n  of physical neglect, after both parents tested positive for crack cocaine.Â \r\n  Child, who was one year old at the time, was placed in a pre-adoptive foster\r\n  home with two of her siblings.[1]Â \r\n  Mother and father have a history with DSS dating back to 1991, and their drug\r\n  abuse is a recurring issue.\r\n After a\r\n  merits hearing, the family court ordered\r\n  mother and father to complete a treatment plan, including a drug and alcohol\r\n  assessment and a parental assessment, and to maintain safe and appropriate\r\n  housing.Â  Mother and father did not complete the treatment plan.\r\nMother\r\n  was offered job counseling services through South Carolina Vocational\r\n  Rehabilitation (SCVR), including diagnosis and treatment, GED prep classes, and\r\n  job readiness training. Â Although mother attended a few days of classes, she\r\n  did not successfully complete the program.Â  Mother claimed she had\r\n  transportation issues, despite having been offered transportation to the job\r\n  training center and the GED center.\r\n The family court also ordered mother and\r\n  father to pay child support.Â  Father paid some child support, using disability\r\n  benefits, but mother paid none.Â  Father and mother both considered mother to be\r\n  a &quot;housewife,&quot; and both testified father provided for the family\r\n  financially.Â  Father testified his income consisted of disability benefits of\r\n  approximately $689 per month and occasional income he earned by performing odd\r\n  jobs and lawn care.Â  Because mother did not earn any income, father paid all of\r\n  the bills, and the family purchased groceries using mother's food stamps.\r\nAt the time child was removed from the home, mother and father\r\n  owned five dogs.Â  At the time of the TPR hearing, mother and father owned ten\r\n  dogs, which mother estimated cost fifty dollars per month to feed.Â  Mother and father also purchased cell\r\n  phones for approximately two hundred dollars.Â  Over the course of the time\r\n  child was in foster care, these expenditures totaled over one thousand dollars.\r\nMother last worked in 2004 when she held three jobs in different\r\n  fast food establishments.Â  Mother suffered from diabetes during her pregnancy\r\n  with child and later developed a degenerative disc disease in her shoulders and\r\n  lower back.Â  According to mother, the disease left her unable to lift heavy\r\n  objects as required by many jobs in the fast food industry.Â  At the time of the\r\n  TPR hearing mother claimed to have unsuccessfully applied for approximately\r\n  thirty jobs.Â  On cross-examination, mother admitted this testimony differed\r\n  from testimony she had given one month earlier in a different TPR action.Â \r\n  Mother testified she applied for jobs not only in the fast food industry, but\r\n  also different types of jobs &quot;to try and better [herself].&quot;Â  Mother\r\n  claimed to have applied for a job answering phones but believed she was not\r\n  offered the position because of her lack of computer skills.\r\nAfter child was first placed in foster care, mother provided\r\n  medications and lotion for child's eczema.Â  Mother also testified she provided\r\n  child with food, drinks, toys, diapers, and wipes.Â  The DSS case manager\r\n  acknowledged mother provided the lotion when child was first placed into foster\r\n  care, but testified mother provided child only snacks, drinks, and toys during her\r\n  last two or three visits.\r\nThe GAL testified that, in her opinion, it was in child's best\r\n  interest to terminate mother and father's parental rights and allow the foster\r\n  parents to adopt child.Â  The GAL stated child was reluctant to spend time with\r\n  mother and father and that they had to &quot;bribe&quot; child with snacks and\r\n  toys.Â  The GAL also testified child had bonded with her foster parents and\r\n  called her foster mother &quot;mommy.&quot;Â  The GAL stated her biggest concern\r\n  with returning child to mother and father was that they had failed to\r\n  rehabilitate themselves from their drug use.\r\n The\r\n  family court terminated mother and father's parental rights, generally finding\r\n  (1) mother and father willfully failed to visit the child; (2) mother and\r\n  father willfully failed to support the child; and (3) TPR was in the best\r\n  interest of the child.\r\nMother appealed the grant of TPR, and the Court of Appeals\r\n  reversed, holding DSS failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  mother willfully failed to support or visit the child.Â  Because the Court of\r\n  Appeals found DSS failed to prove any statutory ground for TPR, it did not\r\n  reach the issue whether TPR was in the best interest of the child.Â  We granted both\r\n  DSS and the GAL's petitions for a writ of certiorari.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing the family court's order\r\n  terminating mother's parental rights?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGrounds for termination of parental rights must be proven by clear\r\n  and convincing evidence.Â  Doe v. Roe, 386 S.C. 624, 630, 690 S.E.2d 573,\r\n  577 (2010).Â  Upon review, this Court may make its own conclusion from the\r\n  record as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination.Â  Id. Â This Court, however, is not required to ignore the fact that the family court,\r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDSS\r\n  argues the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the family court's TPR order.Â  We agree.\r\n The\r\n  family court may order TPR upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds,\r\n  and that termination is in the best interest of the child:\r\n\r\n . . . .\r\n(3) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a\r\n  period of six months, and during that time the parent has willfully failed to\r\n  visit the child.Â  The court may attach little or no weight to incidental\r\n  visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from\r\n  visiting by the party having custody or by court order.Â  The distance of the child's\r\n  placement from the parent's home must be taken into consideration when\r\n  determining the ability to visit.\r\n(4) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a\r\n  period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to\r\n  support the child.Â  Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make\r\n  a material contribution to the child's care.Â  A material contribution consists\r\n  of either financial contributions according to the parent's means or\r\n  contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of\r\n  the child according to the parent's means.Â  The court may consider all relevant\r\n  circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has willfully failed to\r\n  support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the\r\n  ability of the parent to provide support.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010).[2]\r\n\r\nWhether a parent's failure to visit or support a child is\r\n  &quot;willful&quot; within the meaning of the statute is a question of intent\r\n  to be determined from all the facts and circumstances in each case, and the\r\n  trial judge is given wide discretion in making this determination.Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838\r\n  (1992).Â  &quot;While the trial judge is given wide discretion in making this\r\n  determination, the element of willfulness must be established by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C.\r\n  129, 137, 538 S.E.2d 285, 289 (2000).Â  &quot;Conduct of a parent which evinces\r\n  a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be characterized as\r\n  'willful' because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the\r\n  child to receive support and consortium from the parent.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 630, 627 S.E.2d 718, 721 (2006).\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Willful Failure\r\n  to Visit\r\nDSS does not challenge the Court of Appeals' holding that DSS did\r\n  not prove by clear and convincing evidence that mother willfully failed to\r\n  visit child.Â  In finding DSS failed to show mother willfully failed to visit\r\n  the child, the Court of Appeals noted there was no evidence of how many visits\r\n  were scheduled, how many visits mother missed, how long the visits lasted, what\r\n  activities took place during the visits, how much time elapsed between each\r\n  visit, or whether mother was invited to participate in the GAL's visits.Â  The\r\n  court further noted the record contained no evidence of the distance between\r\n  the foster home and mother's home, which the TPR statute requires to be a\r\n  consideration in determining the parent's ability to visit.\r\nThe GAL's sole argument regarding visitation is that the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in considering whether mother was invited to participate in the\r\n  GAL's visits.Â  The GAL does not otherwise challenge the Court of Appeals'\r\n  holding that DSS failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that mother\r\n  willfully failed to visit child.Â  \r\nDisregarding the Court of Appeals' consideration whether mother\r\n  was invited to participate in the GAL's visits, its holding was based on\r\n  numerous other reasons why DSS did not show mother willfully failed to visit\r\n  child.Â  Because these rulings have not been challenged, they are the law of the\r\n  case.Â  See Ulmer v. Ulmer, 369 S.C. 486, 632 S.E.2d 858 (2006)\r\n  (as a general rule, an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the\r\n  case).Â  We therefore decline to address whether the Court of Appeals erred in\r\n  holding DSS did not meet its burden of proving mother willfully failed to visit\r\n  child.Â  The only issues before this Court are whether mother willfully failed\r\n  to support child and, if so, whether TPR was in the child's best interest.\r\n\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Willful Failure\r\n  to Support\r\nDSS argues the Court of Appeals erred in holding DSS failed to\r\n  show by clear and convincing evidence that mother willfully failed to support\r\n  the child.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found that, considering mother's\r\n  &quot;extremely limited means,&quot; her efforts did not appear to evince a\r\n  settled purpose to forego parental duties.Â  The Court of Appeals also noted\r\n  mother failed to take advantage of the vocational rehabilitation services\r\n  offered by SCVR, but found the programs would not have guaranteed her income,\r\n  even had she completed them.\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the family court's\r\n  finding that mother willfully failed to support the child.Â  Specifically, considering\r\n  all the facts and circumstances of this case, DSS showed by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence that mother willfully failed to support child.Â  The TPR\r\n  statute requires the parent make a material contribution, either financial or\r\n  consisting of other necessities &quot;according to the parent's means.&quot;Â \r\n  Although mother had no independent source of income, occasionally providing\r\n  child with food, drinks, medicine, diapers, wipes, and toys would not be\r\n  considered a material contribution.Â  \r\nThe most significant issue for our consideration, therefore, is\r\n  whether mother's failure to support child was willful.Â  We find the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in holding DSS failed to show by clear and convincing evidence\r\n  that mother willfully failed to support child.Â  Specifically, we disagree with\r\n  the Court of Appeals' holding that mother's failure to support child was not\r\n  willful because her actions did not evince a settled purpose to forego parental\r\n  duties.Â  Seegars, supra.Â  We disagree with the Court of Appeals'\r\n  conclusion that mother's failure to complete the SCVR program does not serve as\r\n  evidence that her failure to support child was willful.Â  The Court of Appeals\r\n  correctly notes mother's completion of the program would not have guaranteed\r\n  mother an income, but would have only served to make her a more desirable\r\n  candidate for employment.Â  However, mother's failure to increase her chances of\r\n  finding employment by taking advantage of the SCVR program or undertaking an\r\n  effort to earn her GED manifests her indifference to child and her intention to\r\n  forego parental responsibilities.Â  Over the course of fifteen months mother had\r\n  to complete the program, she only attended a few classes. Â Mother's only excuse\r\n  for not completing the program was that she had transportation issues, but she\r\n  could have been provided with transportation.\r\nFurther, there is evidence mother had the means to provide child\r\n  with some financial support, but chose to spend that money on other items.Â \r\n  Namely, mother continued to pay an estimated fifty dollars per month to care\r\n  for her dogs during the seventeen-month span child was in foster care. Â This\r\n  monthly expense constituted a large sum of money mother could have instead\r\n  provided child.Â  \r\nIn sum, we believe mother's failure to pay court-ordered child\r\n  support or give a reasonable excuse for her failure to pay manifests a\r\n  conscious indifference to the rights of child to receive support.Â  Seegars, supra.\r\n\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Interest\r\n  of the Child\r\nDSS argues TPR is in child's best interest.Â  We agree.\r\nThe GAL testified that, in her opinion, it was in child's best\r\n  interest to terminate mother and father's parental rights.Â  Further, mother has\r\n  an extensive seventeen year history with DSS stemming from her recurring drug\r\n  abuse.Â  Judging from mother's past history with drug and alcohol abuse, her\r\n  apparent indifference to obtaining gainful employment, and her lack of bond\r\n  with child, we find the family court properly found TPR was in child's best\r\n  interest.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n The Court\r\n  of Appeals erred in holding DSS failed to show by clear and convincing evidence\r\n  that mother willfully failed to support child.Â  We further hold the family\r\n  court properly found TPR was in child's best interest.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Mother and father have a total of seven children.Â  Excluding the child that is\r\n  the subject of this action, TPR has been granted as to five of the other\r\n  children, and one child has been emancipated.\r\n[2] Formerly S.C.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Ericka M. Williams, Assistant Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nGilbert\r\n  S. Bagnell, pro se, of Columbia. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: In this attorney discipline matter, Respondent Gilbert\r\n    S. Bagnell has been accused of misconduct, including failure to work on a\r\n    client's case, failure to communicate with a client, failure to properly\r\n    terminate representation by protecting a client's interests, and failure to\r\n    cooperate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC).Â  We concur in the\r\n    Panel's recommendation, and therefore, disbar Respondent.\r\nI.\r\nRespondent\r\n  Gilbert S. Bagnell was admitted to the Bar in 1991.Â  In 2006, Client hired Respondent\r\n  to work on a matter against a financial institution over a disputed debt.[1]Â  At the time,\r\n  Respondent told Client that he had hired an additional firm to assist Respondent\r\n  in the matter.[2]Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, Respondent became very difficult to contact.Â  Client called\r\n  Respondent multiple times, sent multiple certified letters, used intermediaries\r\n  to attempt to contact Respondent, and tracked Respondent down to speak to him\r\n  personally.Â  Whenever Client was able to get in touch with Respondent, Respondent\r\n  was always dismissive.Â  Respondent failed to do any work on the case or file an\r\n  action.Â  Respondent further failed to return Client's files, as requested.Â  \r\nClient\r\n  filed a complaint with ODC in 2009.Â  ODC informed Respondent of the allegations\r\n  of misconduct and the initiation of a full investigation by way of multiple letters.Â \r\n  Respondent failed to respond to these allegations or to a subpoena for\r\n  documents.Â  In early 2010, ODC filed formal chargesâ€”again, Respondent failed to\r\n  acknowledge or answer.Â  As a result, an order of default was issued.Â  In July\r\n  2010, ODC notified Respondent of a hearing on the formal charges.[3]\r\nThe\r\n  matter came before a hearing panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Panel) in\r\n  August 2010, and Respondent did not appear.Â  At the hearing, Client testified\r\n  that he suffered about $28,800 in damages as a result of Respondent's actions.Â \r\n  He testified that he believed the statute of limitations had run on his cause\r\n  of action.\r\nThe\r\n  Panel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct\r\n  under Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.2 (scope of representation); Rule 1.3 (diligence);\r\n  Rule 1.4 (communication); Rule 1.16 (declining or terminating representation); Rule\r\n  8.1(b) (cooperating with disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (misconduct); Rule\r\n  8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  The Panel also\r\n  found Respondent committed misconduct under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement under Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violated Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (willfully failed to comply with subpoena issued under\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct and failed to respond to a lawful demand from\r\n  disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaged in conduct tending to pollute\r\n  the administration of justice, tending to bring the courts and the legal\r\n  profession into disrepute, and demonstrating unfitness to practice law).Â  The Panel\r\n  ultimately recommended Respondent be disbarred and ordered to pay the cost of\r\n  the disciplinary proceeding. \r\nII.\r\nThis\r\n  Court &quot;may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part the findings,\r\n  conclusions and recommendations of the Commission.&quot;Â  Rule 27(e)(2), RLDE,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  attorney's failure to answer formal charges is an admission of the factual\r\n  allegations set forth in those charges.Â  Rule 24(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Similarly,\r\n  an attorney's failure to appear before the Panel when ordered to do so is an\r\n  admission of the factual allegations that were the subject of the hearing.Â  Rule\r\n  24(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nIII.\r\nWe\r\n  find Respondent has committed misconduct in the respects identified by the Panel.Â \r\n  Thus, we find Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\r\n  407, SCACR: Rule 1.2 (scope of\r\n  representation); Rule 1.3 (diligence); Rule 1.4 (communication); Rule 1.16\r\n  (declining or terminating representation); Rule 8.1(b) (cooperating with\r\n  disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (misconduct); Rule 8.4(e) (conduct\r\n  prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  We further find Respondent Â violated\r\n  the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule\r\n  7(a)(1) (violated Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (willfully\r\n  failed to comply with subpoena issued under Rules of Professional Conduct and\r\n  failed to respond to a lawful demand from disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5)\r\n  (engaged in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice, tending\r\n  to bring the courts and the legal profession into disrepute, and demonstrating\r\n  unfitness to practice law).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find disbarment is warranted in Respondent's case.Â  As the Court has stated on\r\n  numerous occasions, an attorney who &quot;fail[s] to answer charges or appear\r\n  to defend or explain alleged misconduct indicates an obvious disinterest in the\r\n  practice of law.&quot;Â  In re Hall, 333 S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266,\r\n  268 (1998).Â  Attorneys who engage in such conduct face severe sanctions\r\n  &quot;because a central purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect the\r\n  public from unscrupulous and indifferent lawyers.&quot;Â  Id.; see In re Murph, 350 S.C. 1, 4-5, 564 S.E.2d 673, 675 (2002) (an attorney's\r\n  bad acts, combined with his failure to respond, warranted disbarment); see also In re Sifly, 279 S.C. 113, 115, 302 S.E.2d 858, 859\r\n  (1983) (disbarring an attorney who failed to timely file an appeal on behalf of\r\n  a client, failed to adequately represent a client in a trust fund matter\r\n  resulting in significant monetary losses by the client, drew checks on his\r\n  personal account that were not sufficiently funded, had a civil default\r\n  judgment entered against him, and failed to cooperate with disciplinary\r\n  authorities or appear to contest the charges against him).Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  abandoned the practice of law, prejudicing Client and the administration of\r\n  justice.Â  Respondent is clearly not fit to practice law.Â  We disbar\r\n  Respondent.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, Respondent shall\r\n  surrender his certificate of admission to practice law and shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing he has complied with Rule 30,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Further, Respondent is ordered to pay the costs of the Panel\r\n  proceedings within 60 days, in the amount of $910.55. \r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Client hired Respondent to pursue a suit\r\n  against the financial institution for allegedly wrongly damaging Client's\r\n  credit rating, which led to substantial economic loss.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; In fact, the law firm contacted by\r\n  Respondent had declined to assist in the matter. Respondent never notified\r\n  Client of that fact.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Respondent abandoned the practice of law\r\n  and ignored all ODC inquiries.Â  It appears that Respondent moved and informed\r\n  neither ODC nor the South Carolina Bar of a new mailing address.Â  As a result,\r\n  it may be that Respondent did not receive actual notice of the panel hearing. Â ODC\r\n  sent notice to Respondent's last known address.Â  Respondent was well aware of\r\n  the grievance proceedings and so acknowledged in a letter he provided the Court\r\n  shortly before oral argument.Â  In the letter, Respondent consented to the\r\n  sanction of disbarment and waived any objections to service.Â  Although notified\r\n  of oral argument, Respondent failed to appear.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27009","title":"In the Matter of James Gerald Longtin","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=27009","description":"In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed formal charges based on allegations of misconduct against Respondent arising from six separate complaints.

Butler, of Walterboro, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney\r\n  disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed formal\r\n  charges on allegations of misconduct against James Gerald Longtin (Respondent)\r\n  stemming from six separate complaints.Â  Following a hearing, the Hearing Panel\r\n  of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Panel) recommended Respondent be suspended\r\n  from the practice of law for a period of six months, along with certain other\r\n  requirements.Â  ODC took exception to the Panel Report on several grounds.Â  We\r\n  agree with the exceptions taken by ODC, and order Respondent's suspension from\r\n  the practice of law for a period of nine months from the date of this\r\n  opinion.Â  Further, we adopt all other sanctions recommended by the Panel with\r\n  the additional requirement that Respondent appear before the Committee on\r\n  Character and Fitness prior to reinstatement. \r\nI.Â  Factual/ Procedural History\r\nMatter A\r\nRespondent\r\n  was the attorney of record for approximately five cases before the Honorable J.\r\n  Michael Baxley in the circuit court.Â  On October 31, 2005, Respondent arrived\r\n  late to a roster meeting, where he informed the court that the five cases were\r\n  all default cases.Â  Therefore, the court advised Respondent to provide default\r\n  motions and proposed orders for each case within ten days of the roster\r\n  meeting.Â  Respondent did not provide the requested motions and orders within\r\n  that timeframe, nor thirty days after the original deadline when the court\r\n  reminded Respondent to file the motions and proposed orders.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  court dismissed each case with prejudice for lack of prosecution. \r\nIn\r\n  November 2005, the Honorable Doyet A. Early III issued an Order and Rule to\r\n  Show Cause for Respondent to appear and show cause why several cases should not\r\n  be dismissed for failure to prosecute.Â  At the hearing on November 30, 2005,\r\n  Respondent was unable to provide the court with a satisfactory reason for\r\n  failing to file the necessary motions and orders to conclude the cases.Â \r\n  Therefore, the court ordered Respondent to provide a full report on all of the\r\n  cases within one week of the hearing.Â  Respondent did not comply with the\r\n  court's directive until January 6, 2006.Â  Â \r\nMatter B\r\nAn out-of-state\r\n  client retained Respondent to handle various collection matters.Â  By letter\r\n  dated October 28, 2005, the client requested Respondent return all case files\r\n  and provide a detailed status report of the work he performed.Â  Respondent did\r\n  not reply, and the client mailed a follow-up letter in December 2005.Â  By\r\n  letter dated January 10, 2006, Respondent confirmed he was in the process of\r\n  closing all of the files; however, he did not communicate with the client\r\n  regarding the status of the cases.Â  Despite several telephone calls and another\r\n  follow-up letter, as of May 1, 2006, when the client filed a grievance with ODC,\r\n  Respondent had not yet provided the requested information.Â  \r\nODC notified\r\n  Respondent by letter dated May 11, 2006, that the client filed a complaint.Â  Respondent\r\n  replied in a letter dated May 26, 2006, that his failure to provide the\r\n  requested information was the result of a &quot;misinterpretation.&quot;Â  By\r\n  letter dated February 15, 2007, ODC provided Respondent with a copy of another\r\n  letter from the client, dated October 26, 2006, indicating Respondent had still\r\n  not provided the requested information, so ODC requested a written response within\r\n  fifteen days, stating why Respondent still failed to provide the requested\r\n  information.Â  Respondent did not respond or otherwise communicate with ODC in\r\n  response to the letter.Â  Therefore, on March 28, 2007, ODC sent a letter\r\n  pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240\r\n  (1982), again requesting a written response.Â  Respondent failed to reply or\r\n  otherwise communicate with ODC.Â  Consequently, the Commission authorized a full\r\n  investigation into the matter on June 15, 2007, and served Respondent with a\r\n  Notice of Full Investigation.Â  Respondent failed to provide a written response\r\n  to the Notice of Full Investigation.Â  \r\nMatter C\r\nOn\r\n  March 4, 2003, the United States District Court for the District of South\r\n  Carolina suspended Respondent from the practice of law, as a consequence of Respondent's\r\n  previous suspension by this Court on October 28, 2002.[1]Â \r\n  In 2004, after Respondent applied to file a complaint in the district court on\r\n  behalf of a client during his suspension, Chief Judge Joseph F. Anderson Jr.\r\n  ordered Respondent to begin the process of reinstatement immediately.Â  However,\r\n  Respondent failed to commence this process, and continued to practice law in\r\n  the district court and to accept fees from parties seeking relief in the United\r\n  States Bankruptcy Court, where he represented debtors in ongoing cases.Â  While\r\n  suspended, Respondent filed thirty-six new cases in federal court.\r\nAt a\r\n  Rule to Show Cause Hearing in 2006, the district court admonished Respondent\r\n  and suspended him from practicing in the district court for at least one year\r\n  following his readmission and placed certain other conditions upon Respondent\r\n  for gaining readmission.[2]Â \r\n  However, Respondent subsequently assisted a litigant in filing a motion in the\r\n  district court while suspended. \r\n\r\nMatter D\r\nIn\r\n  October 2004, Respondent retained the complainant law firm to conduct research\r\n  and draft an appellate brief in a criminal appeal and paid an initial retainer\r\n  of $1,500.00.Â  The law firm completed this work in December 2004 and notified\r\n  Respondent he owed a balance of $803.16, after which the law firm sent numerous\r\n  letters to Respondent attempting to collect the fee.[3] Â The law firm made several offers for Respondent to pay half of the amount due\r\n  in a lump sum or to make smaller monthly installments.Â  Respondent did not avail\r\n  himself of either option and insisted on paying the full amount due, never\r\n  contesting the balance.Â  After the law firm filed the grievance in October 2007, and nearly\r\n  three years after Respondent received the law firm's services, Respondent\r\n  finally paid the balance.Â  The law firm subsequently abandoned its grievance. \r\n\r\n\r\nMatter E\r\nIn\r\n  June 2005, the complainant client retained Respondent to prepare and record a\r\n  deed, paying Respondent $160.00 in attorney's fees and recording costs. Respondent\r\n  reluctantly provided the client with the necessary paperwork to execute the\r\n  deed at home.Â  Within several days, the client returned a signed deed to\r\n  Respondent's secretary for recording.Â  Respondent did not record the deed.Â \r\n  After several attempts to contact Respondent, the client reached Respondent on\r\n  the telephone, and he informed her that she had incorrectly executed the deed.Â \r\n  The client returned to Respondent's office the next day to execute a proper deed.[4]Â \r\n  After executing the second deed, Respondent told the client he would record the\r\n  deed.Â  For several months, Respondent did not record the deed as promised and\r\n  the client attempted to contact Respondent.Â  Respondent never replied.Â \r\n  Ultimately, the client hired another lawyer to record the deed.\r\nIn\r\n  December 2005, the client filed a complaint in magistrate's court to recoup\r\n  attorney's fees and filing fees from Respondent.Â Â  Respondent did not answer.[5]Â \r\n  On January 26, 2006, the magistrate court entered a judgment against\r\n  Respondent.Â  The client contacted the South Carolina Bar's Client Assistance\r\n  Program (CAP) for assistance.Â  CAP attempted to contact Respondent, but he did\r\n  not respond.Â  Therefore, CAP contacted ODC in April 2008.Â  By letter to\r\n  Respondent dated April 8, 2008, ODC requested a written explanation within\r\n  fifteen days.Â  Respondent failed to respond or otherwise communicate with ODC.Â \r\n  On May 5, 2008, ODC sent Respondent a Treacy letter again requesting a\r\n  written response.Â  Respondent finally replied on May 6, 2008.Â  To date,\r\n  Respondent retains the $10.00 recording fee in his trust account.\r\nMatter F\r\nIn\r\n  August 2007, the defendant in another collections matter forwarded a check to\r\n  Respondent to satisfy a debt owed to his client.Â  Respondent told the defendant\r\n  he would file a Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice with the clerk of court,\r\n  even though the case had already been dismissed.Â  However, Respondent never\r\n  filed a Stipulation of Dismissal, even after repeatedly telling the defendant\r\n  he would do so.Â  Respondent's delay in filing the dismissal prevented the\r\n  defendant from resolving the matter until July 2008.Â  \r\nMitigation\r\nDr.\r\n  Charlotte Murrow Taylor, who holds a Ph.D. in counseling, testified before the Panel\r\n  on Respondent's behalf.Â  Dr. Taylor has performed extensive testing on\r\n  Respondent and currently treats him.Â  She opined that Respondent suffers from\r\n  Asperger's disorder, adult variety,[6] Attention Deficit Disorder, and anxiety disorder.Â  According to Dr. Taylor,\r\n  stress from receiving a Treacy letter, from a court demanding\r\n  information, or from an angry client would likely trigger Respondent's avoidant\r\n  tendencies, causing him to close himself off from subsequent communications.Â  Dr.\r\n  Taylor testified Asperger's patients are treatable through cognitive behavioral\r\n  intervention therapy, comprising rote practice of behavioral and social skills.Â \r\n  With the aid of medication, Dr. Taylor testified, patients have been known to\r\n  make great progress under this form of therapy.Â  She testified Respondent is currently\r\n  taking medication, has been cooperative in his counseling, has reacted\r\n  positively to treatment, and has made considerable progress since she began\r\n  treating him.\r\nPanel's Recommendation\r\nThe\r\n  Panel found Respondent committed misconduct with respect to Matters A, B, and\r\n  C.Â  However, the Panel found Respondent did not commit misconduct as to Matters\r\n  D and F, and as to Matter E, the Panel made a partial finding of misconduct.\r\nTherefore, the Panel found Respondent violated the\r\n  following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (Diligence);\r\n  Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 3.2 (Expediting Litigation); Rule 5.5\r\n  (Unauthorized Practice of Law); Rule 8.1(b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary\r\n  Matters); and Rule 8.4(a) (Violation of RPC).Â  Additionally, the Panel found\r\n  that Respondent violated Rules 7(a)(1), 7(a)(5), and 7(a)(7) of the Rules for\r\n  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nBased on these findings, the Panel recommends this\r\n  Court: (1) suspend Respondent from the practice of law for a definite period of\r\n  six months and appoint an attorney to protect clients' interests; (2) order\r\n  Respondent to pay the cost of the disciplinary proceedings; (3) require\r\n  Respondent to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and\r\n  Trust Account School as a condition of discipline; (4) require Respondent to\r\n  continue to follow the recommendations of his treating physicians, including\r\n  counseling and medication, and to file quarterly treatment compliance and\r\n  progress reports with the Commission for a period of two years following his\r\n  return to the practice of law; (5) require Respondent to meet regularly with a\r\n  Mentor approved by ODC for a period of two years following his return to the\r\n  practice of law and to file quarterly reports by the Mentor during that time\r\n  period; and (6) require Respondent to return the $10.00 recording fee which he\r\n  continues to hold in his trust account to the complainant client.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Panel considered as aggravating circumstances\r\n  Respondent's prior disciplinary offense and his obstruction of disciplinary\r\n  proceedings by intentionally failing to comply with the directives of ODC.Â  The\r\n  Panel concluded Respondent's diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome did not excuse\r\n  Respondent's omissions, but did operate to mitigate the severity of any\r\n  sanctions imposed.\r\nII. Discussion\r\nThe\r\n  sole authority to discipline attorneys and decide appropriate sanctions after a\r\n  thorough review of the record rests with this Court.Â  In re Thompson,\r\n  343 S.C. 1, 10-11, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  In such matters, this Court may\r\n  draw its own conclusions and make its own findings of fact. Â Id.; Rule\r\n  27(e)(2), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (We &quot;may accept, reject or modify in whole\r\n  or in part the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the\r\n  [Panel].&quot;).Â  Nevertheless, the findings and conclusions of the Panel are\r\n  entitled much respect and consideration.Â  Id.Â  Moreover, &quot;[a] disciplinary violation must be proven by clear\r\n  and convincing evidence.&quot; Â In re Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216,\r\n  638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see also Rule 8,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;Charges\r\n  of misconduct or incapacity shall be established by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence, and the burden of proof of the charges shall be on the disciplinary\r\n  counsel.&quot;).\r\nMatters A, B, C, and F\r\n We agree with the\r\n  Panel that Respondent committed misconduct under the facts of Matters A, B, and\r\n  C, but not under the facts of Matter F.Â  Neither party takes exception to these\r\n  findings.Â  Accordingly, &quot;the parties are deemed\r\n  to have accepted the Panel's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\r\n  recommendations&quot; as to these matters.Â  In Re Prendergast, 390 S.C. 395, 396 n.2, 702 S.E.2d\r\n  364, 365 n.2 (2010) (citing Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, which states, &quot;The\r\n  failure of a party to file a brief taking exceptions to the report constitutes\r\n  acceptance of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and\r\n  recommendations.&quot;). Â \r\nTherefore we agree with the Panel that Respondent committed misconduct\r\n  as to Matter A by failing to prosecute\r\n  cases adequately on behalf of his clients and to follow orders of the court; as\r\n  to Matter B by willfully failing to respond to his client and the ODC; and as\r\n  to Matter C by continuing to practice law in the federal court while\r\n  suspended.Â  We further agree with the Panel as to Matter F that Respondent's\r\n  conduct did not evidence any intent to mislead or take advantage of the\r\n  complainant, nor did his conduct cause her any harm, so Respondent did not\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct in that Matter.Â  \r\nMatter D\r\nThe\r\n  Panel did not find Respondent committed misconduct as to Matter D, and ODC\r\n  takes exception to this finding.Â  We agree with ODC that the Panel erred in\r\n  finding Respondent did not commit misconduct after failing to pay the case-related\r\n  expenses to the complainant law firm.\r\nThe\r\n  Panel &quot;was satisfied that Respondent was simply unable to financially pay\r\n  the [law] firm and did not willfully ignore the bill or refuse to pay\r\n  it.&quot;Â  In addition, the Panel was inclined to dismiss the allegations\r\n  against Respondent because the complainant law firm instituted the disciplinary\r\n  action solely to collect the debt and abandoned its grievance immediately after\r\n  Respondent paid.Â  However, the Panel was split regarding whether the Rules\r\n  allow for a finding of misconduct where an attorney fails to pay another\r\n  attorney case-related expenses.Â  Therefore, the Panel found ODC had not met its\r\n  burden of proof that Respondent committed misconduct by failing to pay the law\r\n  firm the case-related expenses until after the grievance was filed.\r\nRule 8.4(a) of the Rules of Professional Conduct\r\n  provides &quot;[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate or\r\n  attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or\r\n  induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another.&quot;Â  Moreover,\r\n  Rule 7(a)(5) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement states &quot;[i]t\r\n  shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to\r\n  pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession\r\n  into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law.&quot;Â \r\n  The Court has relied on these provisions in past disciplinary proceedings to\r\n  find misconduct where a lawyer has failed to pay case-related expenses to a\r\n  third-party.Â  See In re Johnson, 385 S.C. 501, 685 S.E.2d 610\r\n  (2009) (disciplining an attorney for failing to pay an expert witness); In\r\n    re Okpalaeke, 374 S.C. 186, 648 S.E.2d 593 (2007) (disciplining an attorney\r\n  for failing to pay a copy bill to a court reporter); In re Fulton, 343\r\n  S.C. 506, 541 S.E.2d 531 (2001) (disciplining an attorney for failing to pay a\r\n  physician's court appearance fee).\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  the appellate work performed by the complainant law firm was a case-related\r\n  expense, and Respondent's failure to timely pay the balance amounts to\r\n  misconduct under the Rules.Â  In our view, Respondent did not provide\r\n  satisfactory reasons for not timely paying the law firm. Â Respondent maintains,\r\n  and the Panel concluded, that he was not aware he would owe additional fees\r\n  when he retained the firm to handle the appellate work and did not have\r\n  adequate funds to pay the law firm the remainder of the fee charged.Â  However, this\r\n  does not excuse Respondent's failure to pay the law firm a relatively nominal\r\n  sum for nearly three years, especially after the law firm made several offers\r\n  and attempts to negotiate a payment plan.Â  Therefore, we believe such failure\r\n  warrants a finding of misconduct under the Rules.[7]\r\nMatter E\r\nAs to\r\n  Matter E, the Panel found Respondent committed misconduct by failing to timely\r\n  respond to inquiries from ODC.Â  However, because it found Respondent to be the\r\n  more credible witness concerning the factual dispute over whether the client\r\n  returned to Respondent's office to execute the second deed, the Panel found ODC\r\n  failed to meet its burden of proving Respondent committed misconduct.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, the Panel recommended we require Respondent to return the $10.00\r\n  recording fee Respondent continues to hold in his trust account.Â  The ODC\r\n  objected to the portion of the Panel's finding concerning the credibility\r\n  determination.Â  We agree with ODC that the Panel erred in not finding\r\n  misconduct under the facts of Matter E because Respondent failed to perform the\r\n  task for which he was retained. \r\nThe\r\n  Court remains the ultimate fact-finder in disciplinary matters.Â  See Johnson,\r\n  385 S.C. at 504, 685 S.E.2d at 611 (&quot;We may 'accept, reject, or modify in\r\n  whole or in part the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the [Panel].'&quot;)\r\n  (quoting Rule 27(e), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR)).Â  Regardless of the factual\r\n  dispute surrounding the circumstances, it is undisputed that the complainant\r\n  client hired Respondent to record a deed, and Respondent never completed this\r\n  task.Â  This fact is evidenced by Respondent's retention of the recording fee in\r\n  his trust account and the complainant's testimony she was forced through\r\n  Respondent's inaction to hire another attorney to record the deed and\r\n  eventually sue Respondent for a refund of these costs and fees.Â  Regardless of\r\n  whose version of events we believe concerning the preparation of the deed\r\n  documents for recording, Respondent undoubtedly failed to perform the task for\r\n  which he was retained. Therefore, we find Respondent committed misconduct with\r\n  respect to Matter E.\r\nCharacter and Fitness\r\nFinally,\r\n  we agree with ODC that Respondent should be required to appear before the\r\n  Committee on Character and Fitness if he chooses to seek reinstatement. \r\nThe\r\n  Panel concluded that Dr. Taylor's testimony &quot;raise[d] serious questions\r\n  about Respondent's capacity to practice law unless he continues to make\r\n  substantial progress in his treatment&quot; for Asperger's Syndrome and\r\n  suggested Respondent receive &quot;close treatment and observation if [he]\r\n  seeks to return to the active practice of law,&quot; but did not recommend\r\n  screening by the Committee on Character and Fitness prior to reinstatement.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  an initial observation, the instant case presents several egregious acts of\r\n  misconduct.Â  We are very concerned about Respondent's failure to heed\r\n  directives from state and federal judges, and to communicate with his clients\r\n  and ODC.Â  While we find Respondent's actions reprehensible, we are also\r\n  sympathetic to Respondent's recent diagnosis.Â  However, we must weigh this\r\n  sympathy against our duty to protect the public from lawyers who may lack the\r\n  present ability to adequately represent their clients in the courts of this\r\n  State.Â  Dr. Taylor testified Asperger's patients have the ability to learn to\r\n  control the kinds of behaviors that led to these proceedings.Â  It is our hope\r\n  that Respondent will continue to thrive in his treatment plan.Â  However, as an\r\n  added protection to the public, we find it prudent to require Respondent to\r\n  appear before the Committee on Character and Fitness if he chooses to petition\r\n  for reinstatement.Â  The Committee on Character and Fitness is in the best\r\n  position to ensure Respondent's continued compliance with his treatment plan\r\n  and will make an informed recommendation concerning Respondent's ability to\r\n  practice law.[8]\r\nConclusion\r\n Based on the\r\n  foregoing reasons, we find Respondent violated the following Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.4\r\n  (Communication); Rule 3.2 (Expediting Litigation); Rule 5.5 (Unauthorized\r\n  Practice of Law); Rule 8.1(b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters); and\r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (Violation of RPC).Â  Additionally, we find Respondent violated Rules\r\n  7(a)(1), 7(a)(5), and 7(a)(7) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We adopt the Panel's conclusion that Respondent's diagnosis\r\n  does not preclude findings of misconduct in this case, but does serve to\r\n  mitigate the sanctions imposed below.\r\nTherefore,\r\n  we conclude Respondent's misconduct warrants suspension from the practice of\r\n  law for a period of nine months from the date of this opinion, and during the\r\n  suspension, we direct the appointment of an attorney to protect clients'\r\n  interests.Â  Prior to filing any petition for reinstatement, we order Respondent:\r\n  (1) to pay the cost of these disciplinary proceedings;Â  (2) to complete the\r\n  Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and Trust Account School as a\r\n  condition of discipline; (3) to continue to follow the recommendations of his\r\n  treating physicians, including counseling and medication; and (4) to return to\r\n  the complainant client the $10.00 recording fee which Respondent continues to\r\n  hold in his trust account.Â  Further, any petition for reinstatement shall be\r\n  referred to the Committee on Character and Fitness.Â  If reinstated, Respondent\r\n  shall (1) file quarterly treatment compliance and progress reports with the\r\n  Commission for a period of two years following his return to the practice of\r\n  law; and (2) meet regularly with a Mentor approved by ODC for a period of two\r\n  years following his return to the practice of law, and file quarterly reports\r\n  by the Mentor during that time period.Â  \r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.Â Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Court previously suspended Respondent for thirty days for failing to\r\n  communicate and respond to numerous requests for information concerning the\r\n  status of a client's case; failing to adequately communicate with another\r\n  client, appear in court on that client's behalf, or timely return phone calls;\r\n  and failing to cooperate with ODC.Â  In the Matter of James G. Longtin,\r\n  352 S.C. 21, 22, 572 S.E.2d 282, 282 (2002).\r\n[2] Respondent remains suspended from practicing law in the district court.\r\n[3] All in all, it appears the law firm sent twelve letters between February 28,\r\n  2005, and August 28, 2007, and the parties had numerous telephone conversations\r\n  during this timeframe concerning the bill. \r\n[4] At the hearing, Respondent testified he did not remember executing a second\r\n  deed.\r\n[5] At the hearing, Respondent testified he was never served with the complaint.Â \r\n  However, when he became aware of the judgment in 2008, Respondent did not\r\n  attempt to have it vacated.\r\n[6] Dr. Taylor testified Asperger's disorder is a genetic developmental syndrome,\r\n  which impairs behavioral development but not intellectual development.Â  She\r\n  stated Asperger's patients are generally highly intellectual, but adult\r\n  Asperger's patients commonly have problems interacting with people and\r\n  functioning under stress.Â  She testified stress tends to exacerbate the common\r\n  symptoms of withdrawal, avoidant behavior, and confusion. \r\n[7] We note that the law firm abandoned its grievance after Respondent paid the\r\n  invoice, and remind the bar that the disciplinary process should not be used as\r\n  a mechanism to collect debts.Â  \r\n[8] Of course, we recognize that because we have decided to impose a nine month\r\n  suspension, instead of the six month suspension recommended by the Panel, the\r\n  Rules require that any petition for reinstatement be transferred to the Committee\r\n  on Character and Fitness, unless this Court provides other instructions.Â  Rule\r\n  33(d), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.

Regulating\r\n  Fla. Bar 3-7.9(b).\r\n1.&nbsp; Respondent is acting freely\r\n  and voluntarily in this matter.\r\n2.&nbsp; The disciplinary measures to\r\n  be imposed upon Respondent are as follows:\r\n\r\n A.&nbsp; One-year\r\n  suspension from the practice of law; and,\r\nB.&nbsp; Payment of costs, as set\r\n  forth more fully herein.\r\n\r\n3.&nbsp; This plea is based on the\r\n  following factual scenarios:\r\nCOUNT I\r\n[TFB Case No. 2009-30,683(10B)]\r\nA.&nbsp; In February 2004,\r\n  Janie Bell Burch died intestate.Â  One daughter, Rochelle Brown survived her.Â \r\n  Ms. Brown had seven adult daughters: one of whom was Johnnie Mae Glover.\r\nB.&nbsp; After Ms. Burchâ€™s\r\n  death, a claim for nursing home neglect settled for $93,000.Â  After payment of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to the personal injury attorney and costs there was $55,861 net\r\n  to the estate.Â  However, the $93,000 was a part of the gross estate for\r\n  purposes of calculation of probate attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nC.&nbsp; In addition, the\r\n  probate estate consisted of a homesteaded house valued at $45,000 and furniture\r\n  and furnishings valued at $5,000.\r\nD.&nbsp; Ms. Glover,\r\n  decedentâ€™s granddaughter, was appointed Personal Representative (hereinafter\r\n  referred to as â€œPRâ€).Â  The PR signed an attorneyâ€™s fee agreement with Respondent.\r\nE.&nbsp; The settlement\r\n  funds were collected and deposited into Respondentâ€™s IOTA trust account.\r\nF.&nbsp; On June 30, 2004, Respondent\r\n  was paid $3,000 in legal fees and $550 for costs.\r\nG.&nbsp; On July 14, 2004, Respondent\r\n  was paid another $3,800 in attorneyâ€™s fees from trust.Â  Respondent provided Ms.\r\n  Glover with supplemental invoices, dated July 15, 2004, reflecting fee charges\r\n  for extraordinary services.\r\nH.&nbsp; On October 19,\r\n  2004, the claims period ended.Â  Seven claims totaling $51,006.23 were received.\r\nI.&nbsp; Over the next 19\r\n  months, Respondent was paid an additional $25,710 in attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nJ.&nbsp; On or about the\r\n  date of each additional payment, Respondent obtained Ms. Gloverâ€™s consent for\r\n  the payment and signature upon a new fee contract reflecting extraordinary work\r\n  performed for that additional fee.\r\nK.&nbsp; By June 2006, Respondent\r\n  compromised the Medicaid claim to $7,020.76.Â  Six other claims remained\r\n  unpaid.Â  Respondent was paid $32,510 in attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nL.&nbsp; In December 2006, Ms.\r\n  Brown hired attorney Matthew D. Ellrod.Â  Mr. Ellrod disputed Respondentâ€™s legal\r\n  fee on behalf of Ms. Brown.\r\nM.&nbsp; To settle the disputed\r\n  legal fee, Respondent arranged for the estate to be reimbursed $30,000 by his\r\n  insurance carrier.\r\nCOUNT II\r\n[TFB Case No. 2010-30,006(10B)]\r\nN.&nbsp; In June 2009, Respondent\r\n  self-reported his conduct in violation of the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar,\r\n  arising during his representation of Lorraine Smith, niece of Aurelia Abelene\r\n  McKinney, relative to Ms. Kinneyâ€™s estate.\r\nO.&nbsp; In or about 1991, Ms.\r\n  McKinney and her husband obtained estate-planning documents.Â  Ms. McKinneyâ€™s\r\n  husband died in 1992.\r\nP.&nbsp; On December 4, 1995, Ms.\r\n  McKinney consulted with Respondent to have him review her estate planning.Â \r\n  Among other documents, Ms. McKinney provided Respondent with 2 revocable living\r\n  trust documents.Â  One revocable living trust appeared to be executed validly on\r\n  its face.Â  Respondent was advised that the notary and at least one witness were\r\n  not present when Ms. McKinney and her husband signed the document.Â  The second\r\n  revocable living trust was facially not validly executed.\r\nQ.&nbsp; Between 1995 and 2006, Respondent\r\n  provided estate-planning services to Ms. McKinney.Â  According to Respondent, Ms.\r\n  McKinney did not want her son, Gerald Lee McKinney, to know about her estate\r\n  planning.Â  In 1995, she disinherited her son in favor of her niece, Lorraine\r\n  Smith.\r\nR.&nbsp; In 1995, Respondent prepared\r\n  a new trust and pour over will for Ms. McKinney.\r\nS.&nbsp; Following Ms. McKinneyâ€™s\r\n  death in 2006, seven annuities were paid over to Ms. Smith.\r\nT.&nbsp; In December 2006, Ms. Smith\r\n  gave Ms. McKinneyâ€™s son $60,000.Â  Ms. Smith was under no obligation to do so.\r\nU.&nbsp; Ms. McKinneyâ€™s 1995 will was\r\n  filed in or about August 2006.\r\nV.&nbsp; In April 2008, Michael D.\r\n  Minton, an attorney with Dean Mead, inquired about the status of the McKinney\r\n  Estate planning on behalf of Ms. McKinneyâ€™s son.Â  Respondent provided a copy of\r\n  Ms. McKinneyâ€™s 1995 trust and will.\r\nW.&nbsp; On July 17, 2008, a demand for\r\n  a copy of the 1991 trust document was received from Joel C. Zwemer, another\r\n  attorney with Dean Mead, on behalf of the son.\r\nX.&nbsp; Respondent met with Ms. Smith\r\n  and advised her that she could:Â  1) provide both trust documents; 2) provide\r\n  nothing; 3) provide the trust document that appeared properly executed; or, 4) provide\r\n  the trust document that did not appear to be executed properly.\r\nY.&nbsp; On July 28, 2008, Respondent and\r\n  Ms. Smith elected to give the facially insufficient trust document to Mr.\r\n  Zwemer.Â  At that time, Respondent did not disclose the existence of the trust\r\n  document that appeared facially sufficient.\r\nZ.&nbsp; When Respondent and Ms.\r\n  Smith learned of the potential lawsuit by the son against the estate, Ms. Smith\r\n  hired Attorney Daniel Allison Carlton from Sarasota to represent her in any\r\n  litigation.\r\nAA.&nbsp; Neither Respondent nor Ms.\r\n  Smith advised Mr. Carlton of the second, apparently sufficient trust agreement\r\n  until June 2009.Â  Respondent continued to maintain his legal conclusion that\r\n  the second, apparently sufficient trust agreement was not a valid trust in that\r\n  it was not executed with the formal requirements of the law.\r\nBB.&nbsp; In August 2008, an estate was\r\n  opened, naming Ms. Smith as Personal Representative.\r\nCC.&nbsp; On or about November 4, 2008, Respondent\r\n  met with Mr. Carlton, Ms. Smith and attorneys with Dean Mead.Â  At that meeting,\r\n  Respondent learned that Mr. Zwemer had filed an Amended Complaint on November 4,\r\n  2008.\r\nDD.&nbsp; Thereafter, Mr. Carlton filed a\r\n  motion to dismiss, arguing, in part, that the plaintiffs failed to state a\r\n  cause of action.\r\nEE.&nbsp; In the estate matter, the\r\n  plaintiffs brought a petition to remove Ms. Smith as Personal Representative\r\n  and to remove Respondent as attorney for the estate.\r\nFF.&nbsp; The hearing on Mr. Carltonâ€™s\r\n  motion to dismiss was held on June 1, 2009. In part, Mr. Carlton argued that\r\n  the copy of the 1991 trust document appended to the complaint was invalid.\r\nGG.&nbsp; On June 1 or 2, 2009, Respondent\r\n  revealed the second trust document to Mr. Carlton for the first time.Â  Respondent\r\n  revealed the second trust document, as he did not want to perpetuate a fraud\r\n  through Mr. Carltonâ€™s arguments that were based without his knowledge of the\r\n  second trust.\r\nHH.&nbsp; Upon learning of the second trust,\r\n  Mr. Carlton advised the judge and opposing counsel of the existence of the\r\n  second trust.\r\nII.&nbsp; Respondent through his\r\n  counsel immediately notified The Florida Bar of his conduct and voluntarily\r\n  provided a sworn statement to Bar Counsel as to his conduct.\r\n4.&nbsp; The Respondent\r\n  admits that by reason of the foregoing he has violated the following Rules\r\n  Regulating The Florida Bar:Â  4-1.5(a) A lawyer shall not enter into an\r\n  agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal, prohibited, or clearly excessive\r\n  fee; 4-3.4(a) A lawyer shall not unlawfully obstruct another party's access to\r\n  evidence or otherwise unlawfully alter, destroy, or conceal a document or other\r\n  material that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is relevant to a\r\n  pending or a reasonably foreseeable proceeding; nor counsel or assist another\r\n  person to do any such act; and, 4-4.1(a) In the course of representing a client\r\n  a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to\r\n  a third person.\r\n5.&nbsp; Factors and considerations of\r\n  mitigation relevant to the discipline include the following:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.&nbsp; Respondent has no\r\n  prior disciplinary history [9.32(a)].\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  B.&nbsp; Respondent has\r\n  suffered from personal and family health-related problems. [9.32(c)].\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  C.&nbsp; Restitution made\r\n  in Count I. [9.32(d)].\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  D.&nbsp; Respondent\r\n  self-reported the conduct detailed in Count II, and he has been cooperative\r\n  throughout this disciplinary proceeding [9.32(e)].\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  E.&nbsp; Respondent\r\n  provided affidavits from members of his religious community attesting to his\r\n  good character [9.32(g)].\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  F.&nbsp; Respondentâ€™s\r\n  stress related issues, arising from personal and family health-related\r\n  problems, have impaired his judgment and decision-making, for which he has\r\n  sought and received treatment [9.32(h)].\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  G.&nbsp; Respondent has\r\n  expressed remorse for his misconduct [9.32(l)].\r\n6.&nbsp; Factors and considerations\r\n  of aggravation relevant to the discipline include the following:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.&nbsp; Multiple offenses\r\n  [9.22(d)].\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  B.&nbsp; Substantial\r\n  experience in the practice of law [9.22(i)].\r\n7.&nbsp; If this Conditional Guilty\r\n  Plea is not finally approved by the referee and the Supreme Court of Florida,\r\n  then it shall be of no effect and may not be used against Respondent in any\r\n  way.\r\n8.&nbsp; If this plea is accepted,\r\n  then the Respondent agrees to pay all costs associated with this case pursuant to\r\n  R. Regulating Fla. Bar 3-7.6(q) for $1,980.60.Â  These costs are due\r\n  within 30 days of the Court order.Â  Respondent agrees that if the costs are not\r\n  paid within 30 days of this Court's order becoming final, the Respondent shall\r\n  pay interest on any unpaid costs at the statutory rate.Â  Further, Respondent\r\n  acknowledges that if, unless otherwise deferred by the Board of Governors of\r\n  The Florida Bar, the cost judgment is not satisfied within 30 days of the\r\n  judgment becoming final, Respondent shall be deemed delinquent and ineligible\r\n  to practice law, pursuant to R. Regulating Fla. Bar 1-3.6.\r\n9.&nbsp; The Respondent further\r\n  acknowledges his obligation to pay the costs of this proceeding and that\r\n  payment is evidence of strict compliance with the conditions of any disciplinary\r\n  order or agreement, and is also evidence of good faith and fiscal\r\n  responsibility.Â  Respondent understands that failure to pay the costs of this\r\n  proceeding will reflect adversely on any reinstatement proceedings or any other\r\n  bar disciplinary matter in which the Respondent is involved.\r\n10.&nbsp; This Conditional Guilty Plea\r\n  for Consent Judgment fully complies with all requirements of the Rules\r\n  Regulating The Florida Bar.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Dated this Â Â 2ndÂ  &nbsp;day of Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â JulyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ,\r\n          2010.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        s/\r\n                        Mark Felker DahleÂ Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n         MARK\r\n                FELKER DAHLE\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        Respondent\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n         Attorney\r\n                No. 716405\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                  Dated this Â Â 2ndÂ  &nbsp;day of Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â JulyÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ,\r\n                    2010.\r\n                  \r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  \r\n                   s/\r\n                        David R.

Emory Smith, Jr., of Office of the Attorney General;\r\n  Bradley S. Wright, Charles F. Reid, Michael R. Hitchcock, and Kenneth M.\r\n  Moffitt, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:Â  Charleston County School District\r\n  (School District) appeals from the circuit court's order granting a Rule\r\n  12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss its complaint alleging the\r\n  unconstitutionality of Act. No. 189 of 2005 (Act 189), as well as its decision\r\n  to dismiss the Governor as a party to this action.[1]Â  Although we affirm the circuit court's\r\n  dismissal of the Governor, we find School District's complaint sufficiently\r\n  states a cause of action that Act 189 is unconstitutional.Â Â  We therefore\r\n  affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nSouth Carolina adopted a charter school law in 1996,\r\n  called the South Carolina Charter Schools Act (Charter Schools Act). Â The\r\n  General Assembly amended the Charter Schools Act once in 2002 and again in\r\n  2006.Â  In the Charter Schools Act, the General Assembly provided rules\r\n  governing all aspects of the organization, approval, and operation of charter schools\r\n  in South Carolina, as well as the obligations of each sponsoring school\r\n  district. \r\n In\r\n  2005, the General Assembly passed Act 189, which provided, in part, as follows: \r\n\r\n Section 5A. (A) The Charleston County School\r\n  District may not deny a charter school, charter school teacher, or charter\r\n  school student anything that is otherwise available to a public school, public\r\n  school teacher, or public school student including, but not limited to, the\r\n  provisions in subsection (B). \r\n (B)(1)&nbsp; The local school district of\r\n  a charter school in Charleston County may not charge rent to a charter school\r\n  that was covered from an existing public school.[2]\r\n\r\nBy its terms, Act 189 only applied to charter schools\r\n  in Charleston County, but it did not purport to amend the Charter Schools Act. \r\nSchool District filed a\r\n  complaint against Speaker of the House Robert Harrell, President of the Senate\r\n  Andre Bauer, Governor Mark Sanford, and the State of South Carolina\r\n  (collectively, Respondents), seeking a declaratory judgment that Act 189 was\r\n  unconstitutional.[3] Â The complaint alleged that Act\r\n  189 was special legislation in violation of Article III, Â§ 34 and Article XIII,\r\n  Â§ 7 of the South Carolina Constitution because the subject of charter schools\r\n  was already comprehensively addressed by the Charter Schools Act and Act 189\r\n  only applied to Charleston County's charter schools without any reasonable\r\n  basis for doing so.\r\nRespondents filed a joint\r\n  motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. Â The circuit court granted\r\n  Respondents' motion, finding that Act 189 was constitutional, Act 189 had not\r\n  been overruled by the 2006 amendments to the Charter Schools Act, and that the\r\n  Governor should be dismissed because he had no authority given to him under Act\r\n  189. This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n School\r\n  District raises five issues in this appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.&nbsp;\r\n       Did\r\n  the circuit court err in failing to find Act 189 unconstitutional as a special\r\n  law in conflict with the state-wide Charter Schools Act?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n       Did\r\n  the circuit court err in finding Act 189 constitutional as a special provision\r\n  in a general law?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      3.\r\n       Did\r\n  the circuit court err in granting a motion to dismiss based on matters outside\r\n  the pleadings?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      4.&nbsp;\r\n       Did\r\n  the circuit court err in failing to find Act 189 superseded by the 2006 amendments\r\n  of the Charter Schools Act?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      5.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the circuit court err in dismissing the\r\n    Governor as a defendant?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule\r\n  12(b)(6), SCRCP, the circuit court must base its ruling solely upon the\r\n  allegations set forth on the face of the complaint. Doe v. Greenville County\r\n    Sch. Dist., 375 S.C. 63, 66-67, 651 S.E.2d 305, 307 (2007). Â The motion may\r\n  not be sustained if the facts alleged in the complaint and the inferences drawn\r\n  therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to relief under any theory. Id. Â &quot;[P]leadings\r\n  in a case should be construed liberally and the Court must presume all well\r\n  pled facts to be true so that substantial justice is done between the parties.&quot;Â  Overcash v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 364 S.C. 569, 572, 614 S.E.2d 619,\r\n  620 (2005) (citing Stroud v. Riddle, 260 S.C. 99, 102, 194 S.E.2d 235,\r\n  237 (1973)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSchool District argues the circuit court erred by\r\n  considering matters outside the pleadings in the motion to dismiss, in finding that\r\n  a logical basis exists for deeming Act 189 a special provision in a general law,\r\n  and in dismissing the Governor as a party. Â Respondents assert the circuit\r\n  court properly considered certain factors regarding Charleston County's unique\r\n  topography and geography because they were established by case law and statute;\r\n  that Act 189 falls within the General Assembly's broad discretion to pass\r\n  legislation impacting an individual school district; and, that because School\r\n  District cannot link the Governor's authority to Act 189, he was properly\r\n  dismissed as a party.Â  We find School District's complaint stated a viable\r\n  cause of action raising the unconstitutionality of Act 189 as special\r\n  legislation where a general law can be made applicable.Â  We further find that\r\n  the circuit court erred in considering matters outside the pleadings but\r\n  correctly dismissed the Governor as a party.\r\nArticle XI, Section 3 of the South Carolina Constitution\r\n  gives the General Assembly the right to &quot;provide for the maintenance and\r\n  support of a system of free public schools open to all children in the State\r\n  and shall establish, organize and support such other public institutions of\r\n  learning, as may be desirable.&quot; Â This section imbues\r\n  the General Assembly with more discretion with respect to legislation impacting\r\n  a school district than it enjoys in other areas. See McElveen v. Stokes,\r\n  240 S.C. 1, 10, 124 S.E.2d 592, 596 (1962) (&quot;[T]he scope of the\r\n  legislative power is much broader in dealing with school matters than is the\r\n  scope in dealing with various other subjects.&quot;). Â However,\r\n  this right is not without certain limitations.Â  Article III, Section 34 of the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution states, in pertinent part: &quot;In all other\r\n  cases, where a general law can be made applicable, no special law shall be\r\n  enacted.&quot;Â  &quot;[L]egislation regarding education is not exempt from the\r\n  requirements of Art. III, Â§ 34 (IX).&quot; Â See Horry County v. Horry County\r\n    Higher Educ. Comm'n, 306 S.C. 416, 419, 412 S.E.2d 421, 423 (1991)\r\n  (citations omitted).Â Â  \r\nWe outlined the framework to determine whether special\r\n  legislation exists in Kizer v. Clark, 360 S.C. 86, 600 S.E.2d 529 (2004). Â &quot;A law is general when it applies uniformly to all persons or things\r\n  within a proper class, and special when it applies to only one or more\r\n  individuals or things belonging to that same class.&quot; Â Id. at 92,\r\n  600 S.E.2d at 532. Â If the legislation does not apply uniformly, the inquiry then\r\n  becomes whether the legislation creates an unlawful classification. Â Id. at\r\n  93, 600 S.E.2d at 532. However, the mere fact that a law creates a\r\n  classification does not render it unlawful. Id.Â  Instead, the\r\n  constitutional prohibition against special legislation operates similarly to\r\n  our equal protection guarantee in that it prohibits unreasonable and arbitrary\r\n  classifications. Id. at 93, 600 S.E.2d at 533.Â  &quot;A classification\r\n  is arbitrary, and therefore unconstitutional, if there is no reasonable\r\n  hypothesis to support it.&quot; Id. Â Accordingly, special legislation is\r\n  not unconstitutional where there is &quot;a substantial distinction having\r\n  reference to the subject matter of the proposed legislation, between the\r\n  objects or places embraced in such legislation and the objects and places\r\n  excluded.&quot; Horry County, 306 S.C. at 419, 412 S.E.2d at 423.Â  Thus,\r\n  where a special law will best meet the exigencies of a particular situation, it\r\n  is not unconstitutional. Med. Soc. of S.C. v. Med. Univ. of S.C., 334\r\n  S.C. 270, 279, 513 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1999). Â &quot;In other words, the General\r\n  Assembly must have a logical basis and sound reason for resorting to special\r\n  legislation.&quot; Â Horry County, 306 S.C. at 419, 412 S.E.2d at 423\r\n  (citation omitted).\r\nAs an initial matter, we hold the circuit court improperly\r\n  considered matters outside the pleadings in deciding Respondents' motion to\r\n  dismiss. Â In support of its decision to grant the motion to dismiss, the\r\n  circuit court cited to a South Carolina federal district court case which found\r\n  Charleston County has a unique geography with nearly one hundred miles of coastline\r\n  that is divided by rivers and linked by bridges. See United States v.\r\n    Charleston County Sch. Dist., 738 F. Supp. 1513, 1521 (D.S.C. 1990), affirmed\r\n      in part and vacated in part on other grounds, 960 F.2d 1227 (4th Cir. 1992).Â \r\n  It is a well-settled principle that in resolving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\r\n  dismiss, the court is limited to a consideration of the allegations contained\r\n  within the four corners of the complaint. See Doe v. Marion, 373\r\n  S.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d 245, 247 (2007). Â In using the federal district court\r\n  case to supply facts from outside the complaint, the circuit court impermissibly\r\n  went beyond the proper parameters of a motion to dismiss.[4]Â \r\n  Therefore, we hold the circuit court erred when it included matters outside the\r\n  complaint in deciding this motion to dismiss.Â  \r\nConfining our analysis to the allegations contained in\r\n  the complaint, and taking them to be true, as we must, we believe School\r\n  District has stated a sufficient cause of action challenging the\r\n  constitutionality of Act 189 to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.Â  School\r\n  District alleges the Charter Schools Act is a general law that applies\r\n  uniformly to every county in South Carolina.Â  Furthermore, it alleges Act 189\r\n  improperly singles out only Charleston County as the recipient of special rules\r\n  for areas covered by the Charter Schools Act without a rational basis for doing\r\n  so. Â For example, School District's complaint points to Sections 59-40-140 and\r\n  59-40-170 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) as examples of where the\r\n  Charter Schools Act already has laws concerning what Act 189 appears to cover.[5]Â \r\n  In general, School District avers the Charter Schools Act places no obligation\r\n  on a sponsoring district to provide services to a charter school, but Act 189\r\n  obligates a school district to do so.Â  According to School District, these provisions\r\n  illustrate the special treatment Act 189 affords to Charleston County, and\r\n  School District's complaint alleges there is no reason for this difference.Â  Therefore,\r\n  School District has stated a sufficient prima facie case that Act 189 is\r\n  unconstitutional special legislation. Â However, we express no opinion regarding\r\n  the ultimate constitutionality of Act 189.\r\nRespondents direct our attention to a 2007 Attorney\r\n  General's opinion which found Act 189 to be constitutional.Â Â  The opinion\r\n  found:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Act No. 189, when considered with the\r\n  express goals of the Charter School Act of 1996, as amended, is to benefit the\r\n  entire county of Charleston.Â  Inasmuch as the South Carolina Charter School Act\r\n  designates charter schools as part of the public school system, there is little\r\n  doubt that the enactment of Act No. 189 sought to provide for the maintenance\r\n  and support of the public schools of Charleston County, consistent with Act XI,\r\n  Â§ 3. \r\n\r\nOp.\r\n  S.C. Atty. Gen., Op. No. 07-139 (Oct.\r\n  19, 2007).Â  Attorney General opinions, while persuasive, are not binding upon\r\n  this Court.Â  Moreover, at this procedural juncture, we are only concerned with\r\n  whether School District's complaint states a viable cause of action sufficient\r\n  to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. \r\n Finally,\r\n  we affirm the dismissal of the Governor as a party to this action. Â Nothing in School\r\n  District's complaint demonstrates a nexus between Governor or his authority and\r\n  Act 189.Â  Instead, School District only alleges that the Governor's ample\r\n  executive powers render him an appropriate defendant in any suit where the\r\n  constitutionality of a statute is challenged.Â  This is an insufficient reason\r\n  to name the Governor as a party defendant.Â  While School District cites to\r\n  cases where the Governor was a proper party, those cases dealt with the specific\r\n  powers and responsibilities of the Governor.Â  That plainly is not the case\r\n  here.Â  Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's ruling that the Governor should\r\n  be dismissed from this action. \r\nBecause we find the circuit court erred in granting\r\n  the motion to dismiss, we decline to address School District's remaining issues.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613,\r\n  518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We\r\n  reverse the circuit court's order granting Respondents' motion to dismiss, and\r\n  remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.Â  In so doing, we\r\n  reiterate that we express no opinion as to the validity or proper\r\n  interpretation of any of the statutes cited herein.Â  Instead, we merely hold\r\n  that School District's allegations state a prima facie case that Act 189 is\r\n  unconstitutional.Â  However, we affirm the circuit court's ruling regarding the\r\n  dismissal of the Governor as a party to this action. \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Respectfully, I dissent.Â  Although I agree with the majority that the\r\n  circuit court judge improperly considered facts outside the pleadings, I would\r\n  nevertheless affirm the circuit court's dismissal of this case because, in my\r\n  assessment, the allegations in the complaint do not entitle Appellant to relief\r\n  under any legal theory.Â  \r\n The\r\n  majority found Appellant stated a prima facie case that Act 189 is\r\n  unconstitutional because the act improperly singles out the Charleston County\r\n  School District without a rational basis for doing so.Â  In my opinion, unless\r\n  there is a conflict between the special and the general law, the question of\r\n  whether there is a logical basis for invoking a special law need not be\r\n  reached.Â  \r\n The\r\n  South Carolina Constitution prohibits the enactment of special or local laws\r\n  &quot;where a general law can be made applicable,&quot; S.C. Const. Art. III, Â§\r\n  34(IX), but permits the General Assembly to enact &quot;special provisions in\r\n  general laws.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 34(X).Â  This Court is deferential to the\r\n  General Assembly when determining the constitutionality of a local law and will\r\n  not declare that law unconstitutional &quot;unless its repugnance to the\r\n  Constitution is clear beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; Med. Soc'y of S.C. v.\r\n    Med. Univ. of S.C., 334 S.C. 270, 279, 513 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1999), or\r\n  &quot;there has been a clear and palpable abuse of legislative\r\n  discretion.&quot;Â  Sirrine v. State, 132 S.C. 241, 248, 128 S.E. 172,\r\n  174 (1925), overruled on other grounds, McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243,\r\n  329 S.E.2d 741 (1985).Â  As the majority rightly points out, this Court affords\r\n  the General Assembly even greater deference when evaluating local laws\r\n  involving school matters.Â  See McElveen v. Stokes, 240 S.C. 1, 10, 124\r\n  S.E.2d 592, 596 (1962).Â  When local legislation involves public education, the\r\n  constitutional restriction on the enactment of local laws must be viewed in\r\n  light of the General Assembly's Article XI duty to &quot;provide for the\r\n  maintenance and support of a system of free public schools open to all children\r\n  in the State . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Const. art. XI, section 3; McElveen,\r\n  240 S.C. at 10, 124 S.E.2d at 596.Â  Accordingly, this Court has traditionally\r\n  sustained local laws relating to the state's public education system, Bradley\r\n    v. Cherokee Sch. Dist., 322 S.C. 181, 470 S.E.2d 570 (1996); Smythe v.\r\n      Stroman, 251 S.C. 277, 289, 162 S.E.2d 168, 173 (1968); Moseley v. Welch,\r\n  209 S.C. 19, 33, 39 S.E.2d 133, 140 (1946); Walker v. Bennett, 125 S.C.\r\n  389, 118 S.E. 779 (1923), unless the Court finds the special law to be in\r\n  direct conflict with the general law such that the two cannot operate\r\n  simultaneously, Smythe v. Stroman, 251 S.C. 277, 289, 162 S.E.2d 168,\r\n  173 (1968); Kearse v. Lancaster, 172 S.C. 59, 61, 172 S.E. 767, 768\r\n  (1934), or if the Court finds, through a rational basis analysis, that a\r\n  general law could be made applicable, Horry County v. Horry County Higher\r\n    Educ. Com'n, 306 S.C. 416, 418, 412 S.E.2d 421, 423 (1991). \r\n Based\r\n  on the allegations contained in the School District's complaint, I see no legal\r\n  theory under which the School District could prevail.Â  In my opinion, rather\r\n  than conflicting with the Charter Schools Act, Act 189 merely operates within\r\n  its framework.Â  In its complaint, the School District alleges that Section 5(A)\r\n  of Act 189 conflicts with section 59-40-140(D)[6] of the South Carolina Code.Â  Section 5(A) of Act 189 reads:\r\n\r\nThe Charleston County School District may not deny a\r\n  charter school, charter school teacher, or charter school student anything that\r\n  is otherwise available to a public school, public school teacher, or public\r\n  school student including, but not limited to, the provisions in subsection (B).\r\n\r\nSection\r\n  59-40-140(E) states that services provided by the local school district,\r\n  &quot;including, but not limited to, food services, custodial services,\r\n  maintenance, curriculum, media services, libraries, and warehousing are subject\r\n  to negotiation between a charter school and the sponsor or local school district.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-140(E) (Supp. 2010).Â  On its face, I do not believe that\r\n  subsection 5(A) of Act 189 conflicts with section 59-40-140(E).Â  The general\r\n  law requires that the school district open all of its services to\r\n  negotiation with a charter school, while Act 189 states simply that the School\r\n  District may not deny anything otherwise available to a public school.Â \r\n  To me, these provisions work in conjunction.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  The School District additionally alleges that subsection (B)(1) of Act 189\r\n  conflicts with sections 59-40-140(J) and 59-40-170 of the South Carolina Code.Â \r\n  Subsection (B)(1) of Act 189 reads: &quot;The local school district of a\r\n  charter school in Charleston County may not charge rent to a charter school\r\n  that was converted from an existing public school.&quot;Â  Section 59-40-140(J)\r\n  states that &quot;[c]harter schools may acquire by gift, devise, purchase,\r\n  lease, sublease, installment purchase agreement, land contract, option, or by\r\n  any other means, and hold and own in its own name buildings or other property\r\n  for school purposes and interests in it which are necessary or convenient to\r\n  fulfill its purposes.&quot;Â  \r\n I\r\n  read subsection (B)(1) of Act 189 to mean that the School District may not\r\n  charge rent to charter schools housed in the School District's facilities by\r\n  virtue of the fact they were formerly public schools.Â  This provision is\r\n  unrelated to section 59-40-140(J), which provides a listing of methods by which\r\n  a charter school may acquire property.Â  The two provisions can operate\r\n  simultaneously, as a Charleston county charter school may remain in their\r\n  buildings rent-free under the local law, but may also acquire property for use\r\n  under any of the enumerated means of section 59-40-140(J).Â Â Â  \r\n I\r\n  also disagree with the School District's claim that subsection (B)(1) of Act\r\n  189 conflicts with section 59-40-170 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Rather, I\r\n  believe subsection (B)(1) rests neatly within its prescription.Â  Section\r\n  59-40-170 requires the Department of Education to provide charter schools, upon\r\n  request, a list of vacant and unused portions of buildings owned by school\r\n  districts, and if a school district decides to sell or lease one of these\r\n  buildings, a charter school &quot;must be given the first refusal to purchase\r\n  or lease the building under the same or better terms and conditions as\r\n  it would be offered to the public.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§59-40-170 (Supp.\r\n  2010) (emphasis supplied).Â  First, this provision refers to a charter school's\r\n  acquisition of new property, and I believe subsection 5(A) of Act 189 allows a\r\n  charter school that was converted to a public school to remain in the facility\r\n  rent-free.Â  But even if subsection 5(A) is not interpreted as narrowly, and it\r\n  requires the School District to provide additional facilities to converted\r\n  charter schools, the general law provides two options to school districtsâ€”they\r\n  may either give first right of refusal under (1) the same terms, or (2) better\r\n  terms.Â  Subsection 5(A) of Act 189 simply requires the School District supply\r\n  its facilities to converted charter schools under better terms than the general\r\n  public.Â  Again, on its face, I do not see that Act 189 conflicts with any\r\n  provision of the general law.Â  Therefore, I would affirm the circuit court's\r\n  dismissal of this case because I do not believe the School District's claim can\r\n  prevail under any legal theory.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] By order dated July 19, 2011, the current Governor\r\n  and current President of the Senate were substituted as parties for the former\r\n  Governor and former President of the Senate. \r\n[2] Other subsections of subsection (B) included\r\n  provisions regarding Charleston County charter school's application for grants,\r\n  charter school teacher's nominations for Teacher of the Year, and charter\r\n  school student's qualifications for Laura Brown Fund Grant.Â  These subsections\r\n  are not pertinent to this appeal.Â Â  \r\n[3]Â  Initially, School District's complaint only listed\r\n  Harrell, Bauer, and Sanford as defendants.Â  These Respondents filed a motion to\r\n  dismiss in lieu of an answer.Â  After a hearing on this motion, the circuit\r\n  court ordered that School District add the State as a defendant. Â School\r\n  District filed an amended complaint a few weeks later, adding the State as a\r\n  party as well as a claim that Act 189 is inconsistent with the 2006 amendments\r\n  to the Charter Schools Act.\r\n[4] We recognize that a motion to dismiss may be\r\n  converted into a motion for summary judgment when the court considers matters\r\n  outside the pleadings.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Karen Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAppellate Defender Elizabeth A. Franklin-Best, of South\r\n  Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  This Court granted the State's petition for a writ\r\n  of certiorari to review the circuit court's order granting post-conviction\r\n  relief (PCR) to Kelle Holden as to her guilty plea.Â  The State contends the\r\n  circuit court judge erred in finding plea counsel ineffective for failing to adequately\r\n  (1) discuss the charges with Holden, and (2) explain to Holden that she was\r\n  pleading guilty without a sentence recommendation from the State.Â  We reverse.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nIn 2005, Holden was arrested and indicted for numerous\r\n  charges stemming from her participation, along with several other co-defendants,\r\n  in a series of car break-ins that occurred in Greenville County over a\r\n  six-month period.Â  Following her arrest, Holden cooperated with law enforcement\r\n  and gave a statement regarding her involvement.Â  \r\nOn July 17, 2006, Holden pled guilty to the following\r\n  charges:Â  (1) one count of possession of methamphetamine; (2) three counts of\r\n  grand larceny; (3) three counts of possessing or receiving stolen goods; (4)\r\n  two counts of breaking and entering a motor vehicle; and (5) one count of\r\n  attempted breaking and entering a motor vehicle.[1]Â  \r\nThe plea judge sentenced Holden to the following\r\n  concurrent terms of imprisonment:Â  three years for possession of\r\n  methamphetamine; ten years, suspended during probation, for count one of possessing\r\n  or receiving stolen goods; five years for attempted breaking and entering a\r\n  motor vehicle; five years for each count of grand larceny; and five years for\r\n  each count of breaking and entering a motor vehicle.Â  Additionally, the plea\r\n  judge sentenced Holden to seven years for count two of possessing or receiving\r\n  stolen goods; and ten years, suspended on time served and five years'\r\n  probation, for count three of possessing or receiving stolen goods.Â  These sentences\r\n  were to run consecutive to the three-year sentence for possession of\r\n  methamphetamine.Â  Ultimately, Holden received an active sentence of ten years'\r\n  imprisonment.\r\nHolden appealed her guilty plea and sentences to the\r\n  Court of Appeals.Â  She, however, voluntarily chose to withdraw her appeal.Â \r\n  After the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, Holden filed a timely\r\n  application for PCR in which she alleged that ineffective assistance of plea\r\n  counsel rendered her guilty plea involuntary.Â  \r\nDuring the PCR hearing, Holden's plea counsel\r\n  testified that Holden had sixty-four charges pending against her when he was\r\n  retained as counsel.Â  He further stated that he met with Holden &quot;two or\r\n  three times&quot; prior to the guilty plea proceeding.Â  Although counsel did\r\n  not bring Holden's file to the hearing, he recalled that he &quot;went over the\r\n  incidents and the charges,&quot; discussed the impact of the State's evidence,\r\n  and discussed the possibility of a plea with Holden during their meetings.Â  \r\nIn terms of the plea, counsel testified he received a\r\n  letter from the solicitor's office four days prior to Holden's guilty plea,\r\n  wherein the State offered to drop fifty-six charges in exchange for Holden's\r\n  plea, but declined to offer a sentence recommendation.Â  The letter also stated\r\n  that the offer would remain open for four months.Â  Counsel further testified he\r\n  informed Holden that &quot;she might get three, four, [or] five years,&quot;\r\n  but maintained he could not guarantee such a sentence as &quot;[t]he judge\r\n  could give her more time.&quot; Counsel testified that he attempted to procure\r\n  a sentence recommendation from the solicitor's office, but was unsuccessful.Â  According\r\n  to counsel, he explained to Holden that there was no sentence recommendation\r\n  from the State and that she could potentially receive the maximum sentence on\r\n  each of the indicted charges.Â  Counsel claimed Holden never informed him that\r\n  she wanted to go to trial.Â  \r\nHolden testified she met with plea counsel on two occasions\r\n  prior to the guilty plea proceeding.Â  Although Holden acknowledged that counsel\r\n  discussed the facts of the cases with her, she characterized the length of the\r\n  discussions as &quot;[v]ery little.&quot;Â  According to Holden, plea counsel\r\n  never reviewed discovery with her and did not discuss the elements of the\r\n  pending charges. Â As to sentencing, Holden claimed counsel told her &quot;about\r\n  [the State] dropping the charges&quot; in consideration of her decision to\r\n  plead guilty and that she &quot;would probably get probation, but no more than\r\n  three years.&quot;[2] \r\nWhen asked about the plea proceeding, Holden\r\n  acknowledged the judge had questioned her regarding her decision to plead\r\n  guilty and had discussed the maximum sentences for each of the charges.Â  Holden\r\n  also recalled the solicitor's statement that there was no sentence\r\n  recommendation.Â  At the conclusion of her cross-examination testimony, Holden\r\n  admitted she would not have filed the PCR application had she received less\r\n  than a three-year sentence. \r\nBy written order, the PCR judge granted Holden's\r\n  requested relief.Â  In prefacing his decision, the PCR judge specifically found that\r\n  plea counsel's testimony was &quot;not credible&quot; and noted that counsel\r\n  &quot;failed to bring his criminal defense file to the evidentiary hearing,\r\n  even though his subpoena instructed him to do so.&quot;Â  \r\nAs to plea counsel's representation, the PCR judge\r\n  found that counsel failed to adequately discuss with Holden the State's\r\n  evidence and the elements of the charges.Â  The judge reasoned that counsel did\r\n  not have enough time to thoroughly discuss the State's plea offer and its\r\n  ramifications as the plea offer, which was to dismiss fifty-six charges, was\r\n  tendered on the Thursday before the Monday plea proceeding.Â  \r\nThe judge further concluded that plea counsel\r\n  &quot;misadvised [Holden] about the sentence she would receive if she accepted\r\n  the State's plea offer and entered a guilty plea.&quot;Â  In reaching this\r\n  conclusion, the judge referenced testimony from the hearing where &quot;plea\r\n  counsel assured [Holden that] she would receive a sentence of less than three\r\n  (3) years and probation if she pled guilty.&quot;Â  The judge found that\r\n  &quot;[t]his was clearly not the case, as the State's \r\n\r\noffer\r\n  was for [Holden] to plead guilty without a sentence recommendation.&quot;Â  The\r\n  judge further found that plea counsel's error was not cured by the solicitor's\r\n  statement at the guilty plea proceeding regarding the lack of a sentence\r\n  recommendation.Â  Â Â \r\nFinally, the judge ruled Holden had established that\r\n  plea counsel did not provide effective assistance.Â  As a result, the judge vacated\r\n  Holden's convictions and remanded for a new trial.Â  \r\nThis Court granted the State's petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the decision of the PCR judge.\r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.\r\nIn challenging the PCR judge's\r\n  order, the State contends the PCR judge erred in finding plea counsel\r\n  ineffective for failing to adequately discuss with Holden the State's evidence\r\n  and the elements of the charges.Â  Additionally, the State asserts the PCR judge\r\n  erred in finding plea counsel ineffective for failing to adequately explain to\r\n  Holden that she was pleading guilty without a sentence recommendation from the\r\n  State. \r\nIn support of these\r\n  assertions, the State claims there is evidence that plea counsel sufficiently\r\n  reviewed with Holden the charges and the lack of a sentence recommendation.Â \r\n  Even assuming that plea counsel was deficient, the State maintains that Holden\r\n  was not prejudiced as the plea judge read each of the indictments, which\r\n  contained the elements of each crime charged, and the solicitor presented a\r\n  factual recitation that formed the basis for the charges.Â  Moreover, the State relies\r\n  on the guilty plea transcript, which indicates that Holden was fully advised of\r\n  the maximum sentences she was facing and that she was pleading guilty without a\r\n  sentence recommendation.\r\nEssentially, the State claims\r\n  the plea colloquy cured any alleged deficiency in plea counsel's representation\r\n  in advising Holden of the nature of the charges, the maximum sentences she was\r\n  facing, and the lack of a sentence recommendation on the part of the State.[3]\r\nB.\r\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States\r\n  Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to effective assistance of\r\n  counsel.Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI; Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668\r\n  (1984); Lomax v. State, 379 S.C. 93, 665 S.E.2d 164 (2008).Â  &quot;There\r\n  is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised\r\n  reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions in the\r\n  case.&quot;Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596\r\n  (2007).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has created a two-pronged test to\r\n  establish ineffective assistance of counsel by which a PCR applicant must show (1) counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) the\r\n    deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at\r\n    687; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  The two-part\r\n  test adopted in Strickland also &quot;applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.&quot;\r\n  Â Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58 (1985). Â &quot;Plea counsel is\r\n  ineffective within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment only when the applicant\r\n  satisfies both requirements.&quot; Â Stalk v. State, 383 S.C. 559, 561,\r\n  681 S.E.2d 592, 593 (2009).\r\n&quot;A defendant who enters a plea on the\r\n  advice of counsel may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of a\r\n  plea by showing that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard\r\n  of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\r\n  counsel's errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty, but would have\r\n  insisted on going to trial.&quot;Â  Rolen v. State, 384 S.C. 409, 413,\r\n  683 S.E.2d 471, 474 (2009). Â Â \r\n&quot;To find a guilty plea is voluntarily\r\n  and knowingly entered into, the record must establish the defendant had a full\r\n  understanding of the consequences of his plea and the charges against\r\n  him.&quot;Â  Roddy v. State, 339 S.C. 29, 33, 528 S.E.2d 418, 421 (2000).Â \r\n  &quot;A defendant's knowing and voluntary waiver of the constitutional rights\r\n  which accompany a guilty plea 'may be accomplished by colloquy between the\r\n  Court and the defendant, between the Court and defendant's counsel, or both.'&quot;Â  Pittman v. State, 337 S.C. 597, 599, 524 S.E.2d 623, 625 (1999) (quoting State v. Ray, 310 S.C. 431, 437, 427 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1993)).Â  &quot;The\r\n  longstanding test for determining the validity of a guilty plea is 'whether the\r\n  plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative\r\n  courses of action open to the defendant.'&quot;Â  Hill, 474 U.S. at 56\r\n  (quoting North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 31 (1970)).\r\n&quot;In determining guilty\r\n  plea issues, it is proper to consider the guilty plea transcript as well as\r\n  evidence at the PCR hearing.&quot;Â  Suber v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558,\r\n  640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007). Â &quot;Specifically, the voluntariness of a guilty\r\n  plea is not determined by an examination of a specific inquiry made by the\r\n  sentencing judge alone, but is determined from\r\n  both the record made at the time of the entry of the guilty plea, and also from\r\n  the record of the PCR hearing.&quot;Â  Roddy, 339 S.C. at 33, 528 S.E.2d at\r\n  420.\r\n&quot;This Court gives great deference to\r\n  the post-conviction relief (PCR) court's findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814\r\n  (2005).Â  In reviewing the PCR judge's decision, an appellate\r\n  court is concerned only with whether any evidence of probative value exists to\r\n  support that decision.Â  Smith v. State, 369 S.C. 135, 138, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  260, 261 (2006).Â  This Court will uphold the findings of the PCR judge &quot;if\r\n  there is any evidence of probative value sufficient to support them.&quot;Â  Dempsey,\r\n  363 S.C. at 368, 610 S.E.2d at 814.Â  &quot;If no probative evidence exists to\r\n  support the findings, the Court will reverse.&quot;Â  Id. at 368-69, 610\r\n  S.E.2d at 814.\r\nC.\r\nInitially, we acknowledge the\r\n  PCR judge's finding that plea counsel's testimony was not credible.[4] Â We, however, conclude that plea counsel's lack of credibility is not\r\n  determinative of whether counsel was ineffective. Â Even if plea counsel's\r\n  testimony was not credible, Holden's testimony refutes the PCR judge's\r\n  conclusion that Holden received ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  Moreover,\r\n  any deficiency on the part of plea counsel was cured by the plea colloquy.\r\nDuring the PCR hearing, Holden\r\n  testified plea counsel informed her that the State would dismiss certain\r\n  charges in consideration of her decision to plead guilty.Â  She also\r\n  acknowledged that she discussed the facts of the cases with plea counsel prior\r\n  to the plea proceeding.Â  Although Holden believed she would receive no more\r\n  than a three-year sentence, she admitted that plea counsel never discussed or\r\n  presented a sentence recommendation from the State.Â  Significantly, Holden\r\n  never testified that she would not have pled guilty if plea counsel had\r\n  properly explained the charges, the elements of the offenses, or reviewed the\r\n  State's evidence with her.\r\nAdditionally, a review of the\r\n  plea proceeding reveals that Holden was clearly aware of the elements of the\r\n  charged offenses, the State's evidence as to the charges, and the potential\r\n  sentences.\r\nThroughout the proceeding, the\r\n  plea judge thoroughly questioned Holden about her decision to plead guilty. Â Initially,\r\n  the judge read through each of the indictments that outlined the charged\r\n  offenses.Â  After the solicitor presented a factual recitation and stated that\r\n  there was no sentencing recommendation, Holden acknowledged that she wished to\r\n  plead guilty.Â  The judge then instructed Holden regarding the maximum sentences\r\n  that she could receive for each offense.Â  Following these instructions, Holden\r\n  stated she understood the nature of the charges and the possible sentences.Â \r\n  The judge then specifically identified each of the constitutional rights that\r\n  Holden would be waiving by pleading guilty.Â  Holden acknowledged the\r\n  consequences of pleading guilty and admitted she was guilty of the charged\r\n  offenses.Â  Holden also denied that she had been promised anything to get her to\r\n  plead guilty.Â  Based on the comprehensive questioning and Holden's answers, the\r\n  plea judge accepted Holden's plea and determined that it was knowing and\r\n  voluntary.Â  \r\nIn view of this evidence, we\r\n  conclude that any alleged deficiency in plea counsel's representation was cured\r\n  by the plea colloquy.Â  See Bennett v. State, 371 S.C. 198, 205\r\n  n.6, 638 S.E.2d 673, 676 n.6 (2006) (reversing grant of PCR and stating that\r\n  &quot;even where counsel offers misinformation, this deficiency can be cured\r\n  where the trial court properly informs the defendant about the sentencing\r\n  range&quot;); Burnett v. State, 352 S.C. 589, 576 S.E.2d 144 (2003)\r\n  (reversing grant of PCR and holding that even if plea counsel erroneously\r\n  informed defendant that his sentence would only be three years, the information\r\n  conveyed at the plea hearing cured any misconception caused by counsel's\r\n  alleged inaccurate advice); Moorehead v. State, 329 S.C. 329, 333, 496 S.E.2d 415, 417 (1998) (reversing\r\n  grant of PCR on the ground that there was no evidence to support the PCR\r\n  judge's finding that applicant received ineffective assistance of counsel due\r\n  to erroneous sentencing advice where &quot;any misconception was cured at the\r\n  plea hearing&quot;); Wolfe v. State, 326 S.C. 158, 165, 485 S.E.2d 367,\r\n  370 (1997) (reversing grant of PCR and recognizing that in considering an\r\n  allegation on PCR that a guilty\r\n  plea was based on inaccurate advice of counsel, the transcript of the guilty\r\n  plea hearing will be considered to determine\r\n  whether any possible error by counsel was cured by the information conveyed at\r\n  the plea hearing).\r\nFurthermore, on\r\n  each of the sentencing sheets there is a &quot;checked&quot; box indicating\r\n  that the plea was &quot;Without Negotiations or Recommendation.&quot;Â  By\r\n  signing each of these forms, Holden manifested her desire to plead guilty and\r\n  acknowledged the lack of a sentence recommendation.Â  See James v.\r\n    State, 377 S.C. 81, 85, 659 S.E.2d 148, 150 (2008) (reversing grant of PCR\r\n  as to applicant's guilty plea where plea sheet and applicant's conduct at plea\r\n  hearing expressed applicant's desire to plead guilty).\r\n Finally, we find that PCR was not\r\n  warranted as Holden's primary complaint regarding plea counsel's representation\r\n  was that she did not receive a sentence of less than three years.Â  As evidenced\r\n  by the above-outlined testimony, it is clear that Holden hoped and expected to\r\n  get a lesser sentence.Â  However, &quot;[w]ishful thinking regarding sentencing\r\n  does not equal a misapprehension concerning the possible range of sentences,\r\n  especially where one acknowledges on the record that one knows the range of\r\n  sentences and that no promises have been made.&quot;Â  Wolfe, 326 S.C. at\r\n  165, 485 S.E.2d at 371. \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we find there is no probative evidence to support the PCR judge's\r\n  finding that Holden received ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to\r\n  her guilty plea.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nIn conclusion, we reverse the decision of the PCR\r\n  judge and reinstate Holden's guilty plea as the record does not support the\r\n  PCR's judge's finding that Holden received ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  \r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. HEARN, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The State nol prossed fifty-six other charges\r\n  in consideration of Holden's decision to plead guilty.\r\n[2] Holden's mother, who testified at the PCR hearing,\r\n  offered similar testimony wherein she stated plea counsel told her that Holden\r\n  would receive twenty-four months of probation and be required to pay\r\n  restitution. \r\n[3]Â  The State also contends that any prejudice Holden\r\n  may have suffered as a result of counsel's alleged errors was negated by the\r\n  overwhelming evidence of Holden's guilt.Â  As will be discussed, we find it unnecessary\r\n  to address this argument as the State's primary arguments are meritorious.\r\n[4]Â  See Solomon v. State, 313 S.C. 526,\r\n  529, 443 S.E.2d 540, 542 (1994) (recognizing that appellate courts give great\r\n  deference to a PCR court's finding when matters of credibility are involved).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27013","title":"Carolina Chloride v.

Â We affirm\r\n  in part and reverse in part.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nIn November 1996, Carolina\r\n  Chloride purchased 7.67 acres of land from IBM for $85,000.00.Â  The land was\r\n  located on Killian Road in Richland County, near some railroad tracks.Â  Carolina\r\n  Chloride intended to use the property for storing and distributing calcium\r\n  chloride, a chemical used to control dust and ice on roads, as well as to treat\r\n  drinking water.Â  This use required M&#8209;2 zoning, which designated a Heavy\r\n  Industrial District.Â  Robert Morgan was the sole owner of Carolina Chloride.Â  \r\nPrior to the purchase,\r\n  Carolina Chloride's realtor, Ervin Ott, contacted the County to inquire about\r\n  the zoning classification of the IBM property.Â  The realtor could not recall\r\n  who he had spoken to, but stated the person informed him the IBM property was\r\n  zoned M-2.Â  There is no indication that either Morgan or Ott personally checked\r\n  the County's Official Zoning Map or the ordinances establishing the zoning\r\n  districts.\r\n Shortly after Carolina Chloride purchased the property,\r\n  Morgan, its president, requested a building permit from the County.Â  A question\r\n  arose about the property's zoning, so Morgan visited Terry Brown, who was then\r\n  the County's Zoning Administrator.Â  Brown told Morgan he would check into it\r\n  and get back to him.\r\nIn a letter to Morgan dated\r\n  December 5, 1996, Brown stated that it was his &quot;opinion&quot; that the\r\n  property &quot;should properly be zoned M-2, Heavy Industrial.&quot;Â  Brown\r\n  added, &quot;The tax map was in error and has been amended to\r\n  reflect the proper zoning of M-2, Heavy Industrial.&quot;Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  There\r\n  is no indication in the record, however, that Brown ever produced an Official\r\n  Zoning Map or ordinance showing the property was zoned M-2 by County Council.\r\n Over the next several years, Carolina Chloride added\r\n  improvements of more than $400,000.00 to the property, including a\r\n  mini-warehouse business.Â  As part of this process, Carolina Chloride requested\r\n  and received the necessary County approval.Â  The employees indicated on the\r\n  various permits and other documents that the property was zoned M-2.Â  \r\n In 2002, Morgan began negotiating with Allen Watson, his\r\n  son, Luke Watson, and Luke's wife, Johnette, for the sale of the property and\r\n  the businesses for $1.1 million.Â  Questions arose about an easement and\r\n  possibly splitting the lot as the Watsons were contemplating selling off the\r\n  chemical business and expanding the mini-warehouse business. During the\r\n  negotiations, Morgan and the Watsons contacted the County about whether the Watsons'\r\n  planned expansion of the mini-warehouse business would be in conformance with\r\n  the property's legal zoning designation.Â  \r\nOn February 13, 2003, John\r\n  Hicks, whose County letterhead identified him as the Development Services\r\n  Manager, wrote to Morgan at Carolina Chloride and advised him that the Carolina\r\n  Chloride property was actually zoned RU (Rural District), not M-2, and that the\r\n  existing facilities were non-conforming uses that could legally continue, but\r\n  could not be expanded.Â  Hicks enclosed a copy of the portion of the Official\r\n  Zoning Map showing the RU designation on Carolina Chloride's parcel. Â However,\r\n  Hicks encouraged Morgan to file an application for County Council to rezone the\r\n  property:\r\n\r\nYou may apply to amend the existing zoning map to M-2 or some\r\n  other suitable zoning district.Â  Zoning map amendments require action by the\r\n  Planning Commission and adoption of an ordinance by the County Council.Â  The\r\n  process requires about three months to complete.\r\n\r\nCarolina Chloride did not\r\n  immediately petition for County Council to rezone the property.Â  Instead,\r\n  Morgan submitted Brown's 1996 letter stating it was his opinion the property\r\n  was zoned M-2 to County officials and asked them to take corrective action, but\r\n  they declined to do so.Â  Morgan continued his existing operations on the\r\n  property during this time without interference from the County.\r\nSome six months later, on\r\n  August 1, 2003, Carolina Chloride submitted an &quot;Official Zoning Map\r\n  Amendment Application&quot; seeking rezoning of the property to M-2.Â  On\r\n  October 21, 2003, County Council gave a third reading to an ordinance\r\n  officially rezoning the Carolina Chloride property from RU to M&#8209;2, and it\r\n  was attested to by the Clerk of Council on November 4, 2003.Â  \r\nMeanwhile, the Watsons\r\n  decided not to purchase the Carolina Chloride property and businesses,\r\n  reportedly due to the zoning issue.Â  However, no written contract had ever been\r\n  executed by the parties, and Morgan acknowledged that there were several\r\n  contingencies to their arrangement.Â  For example, Allen Watson wanted Morgan to\r\n  work for him for a year and exercise due diligence in the handling of some\r\n  financial records.Â  Additionally, there was an issue regarding how to handle\r\n  the income from a cell phone tower on the property that went directly to Morgan\r\n  rather than to Carolina Chloride.Â  \r\n In 2005, Carolina Chloride filed an amended complaint\r\n  against Richland County asserting numerous civil claims, including, among\r\n  others, constructive fraud, deprivation of substantive due process, governmental\r\n  and promissory estoppel, gross negligence, inverse condemnation, negligence, and\r\n  negligent misrepresentation.Â  Carolina Chloride essentially alleged the County\r\n  had incorrectly advised it of the legal zoning classification of its property\r\n  and that it had lost a potential sale due to the zoning issue.Â  \r\nAfter Carolina Chloride\r\n  presented its case-in-chief, the trial judge directed a verdict for the County\r\n  on all of Carolina Chloride's claims.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed and\r\n  remanded as to the claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation, but\r\n  upheld the directed verdict as to the remaining claims Carolina Chloride presented\r\n  on appeal.Â  The County and Carolina Chloride both appeal. \r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; THE COUNTY'S APPEAL\r\nThe County argues the Court of Appeals\r\n  erred in reversing the directed verdict in its favor on Carolina Chloride's\r\n  claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation.\r\n(1)Â  Negligence and\r\n  Negligent Misrepresentation \r\nAs an initial matter, the\r\n  County argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding there was a factual\r\n  question regarding the zoning designation of the property that precluded a\r\n  judgment in its favor as a matter of law.Â  The County asserts zoning\r\n  designations are legal, not factual, issues.Â  \r\nThe County further argues\r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the grant of a directed verdict on the\r\n  claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation because those claims are\r\n  premised on a misstatement of law upon which Carolina Chloride had no\r\n  justifiable right to rely.\r\nIn contrast, Carolina\r\n  Chloride contends its negligence claim is based not only on the County's\r\n  statements regarding the property's zoning designation, but also on the\r\n  County's failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and interpreting\r\n  the Official Zoning Map and associated records.Â  Carolina Chloride asserts the\r\n  County committed negligence by virtue of the failure of Brown in 1996 or Hicks\r\n  in 2003 to advise Carolina Chloride of the correct legal zoning classification\r\n  of its property.\r\n&quot;When upon a trial the\r\n  case presents only questions of law the judge may direct a verdict.&quot;Â  Rule\r\n  50(a), SCRCP.Â  The trial judge must deny a motion for a directed verdict when\r\n  the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Steinke\r\n    v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373,\r\n  520 S.E.2d 142&nbsp;(1999).\r\n&quot;When reviewing a\r\n  ruling on a motion for directed verdict, we must view the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.&quot;Â  Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 426, 611 S.E.2d\r\n  488, 491&nbsp;(2005).Â  This is the same standard applied by the trial judge.Â  All\r\n    Saints Parish Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church in Diocese of S.C.,\r\n  385 S.C. 428, 685 S.E.2d 163 (2009).Â  \r\nNeither the trial judge nor\r\n  the appellate court has the authority to decide credibility issues or to\r\n  resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342\r\n  S.C. 279, 536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  This Court will reverse the trial\r\n  judge's ruling only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or it is\r\n  controlled by an error of law.Â  Gadson ex rel. Gadson v. ECO Servs. of S.C.,\r\n    Inc.,&nbsp;374 S.C. 171, 648 S.E.2d 585&nbsp;(2007).\r\nTo recover on a claim for negligence, a\r\n  plaintiff &quot;must show (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the\r\n  plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3)\r\n  damage proximately resulting from the breach.&quot;Â  Tanner v. Florence\r\n    County Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 561, 521 S.E.2d 153, 158&nbsp;(1999)\r\n  (quoting Andrews v. Piedmont Air Lines, 297 S.C. 367, 369, 377 S.E.2d\r\n  127, 128 (1989)).Â  &quot;The absence of any one of these elements renders the cause of action insufficient.&quot;Â  Andrews,\r\n  297 S.C. at 369, 377 S.E.2d at 128-29.\r\n&quot;To establish liability for\r\n  negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff must show '(1) the defendant made a\r\n  false representation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a pecuniary\r\n  interest in making the representation; (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to\r\n  see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the\r\n  defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care; (5) the plaintiff\r\n  justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a\r\n  pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance upon the representation.'&quot;Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 407, 581\r\n  S.E.2d 161, 166&nbsp;(2003) (quoting AMA Mgmt. Corp. v. Strasburger, 309\r\n  S.C. 213, 222, 420 S.E.2d 868, 874 (Ct. App. 1992)). \r\n&quot;The duty of care is not a duty to\r\n  take every possible care, still less is it a duty to be right; it is the\r\n  familiar duty to exercise that care a reasonable man would take in the\r\n  circumstances.&quot;Â  AMA Mgmt. Corp., 309 S.C. at 223, 420 S.E.2d at\r\n  874.Â  &quot;[T]he\r\n  plaintiff as part of his case must show that his reliance on the\r\n  misrepresentation was reasonable.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;There is no\r\n  liability for casual statements, representations as to matters of law,\r\n  or matters which plaintiff could ascertain on his own in the exercise of\r\n  due diligence.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis added).\r\n The trial judge directed a verdict on the claims for\r\n  negligence and negligent misrepresentation on several grounds, including, as to\r\n  negligent misrepresentation, that Carolina Chloride could have, through\r\n  reasonable diligence, acquired knowledge of the proper zoning designation from\r\n  the public records, and that both claims were barred by the South Carolina Tort\r\n  Claims Act.\r\nThe Court of Appeals ruled a\r\n  question of fact existed as to the proper zoning designation of the property\r\n  and that Carolina Chloride did not have the ability to determine the true\r\n  zoning designation from the public records.Â  Carolina Chloride, 382 S.C.\r\n  at 652, 677 S.E.2d at 901.Â  It also found the claims were not barred by the\r\n  Tort Claims Act.Â  Id. at 648-51, 677 S.E.2d at 899-901.Â  \r\n On appeal to this Court, the County argues the zoning\r\n  designation of property is a legislative decision that is established by\r\n  ordinance, and it is a matter of law, not fact, citing this Court's recent\r\n  opinion in Quail Hill, L.L.C. v. County of Richland, 387 S.C. 223, 692\r\n  S.E.2d 499 (2010).Â  The County asserts the applicable legal zoning classification\r\n  is not subject to the discretion of government officials, and it cannot be\r\n  changed except through legislative action by County Council as prescribed by\r\n  law.Â  Thus, the legal zoning classification of any particular parcel of property\r\n  may be ascertained only by referring to the ordinance establishing the zoning\r\n  as well as by referring to the Official Zoning Map of Richland County.\r\nThe County contends there is\r\n  no indication in the record that the Official Zoning Map ever showed the subject\r\n  property to be zoned M-2 prior to County Council's enactment of the 2003\r\n  ordinance changing the zoning from RU to M-2.Â  Further, the record does not\r\n  support a finding that John Hicks made a mistake in his February 13, 2003\r\n  letter about the zoning.Â  Rather, he accurately reported that the Official\r\n  Zoning Map characterized the property as RU, and he provided a copy of the map\r\n  to Carolina Chloride.Â  Moreover, contrary to Carolina Chloride's assertion,\r\n  Hicks's statement was not an &quot;overruling&quot; of the M-2 classification\r\n  mentioned by Brown.Â  Rather, Brown was mistaken when he reported that he\r\n  believed the property to be M&#8209;2.\r\nIn Quail Hill, the\r\n  plaintiff alleged it had relied on the mistaken representations of the County, prior\r\n  to purchasing its property, that the property was zoned RU (Rural District), a\r\n  classification that would allow it to develop manufactured housing on the\r\n  property.Â  Quail Hill, 387 S.C. at 227, 692 S.E.2d at 501.Â  The\r\n  information was conveyed by Richland County Subdivision Coordinator Carl\r\n  Gosline based on his review of the County's records, including tax records.Â  Id.Â \r\n  However, after Quail Hill began development, the County's Zoning Administrator\r\n  consulted the Official Zoning Map in response to complaints from neighboring\r\n  landowners and determined the property was actually zoned RS-1, a residential\r\n  classification that prohibits manufactured homes.Â  Id. at 228, 692\r\n  S.E.2d at 502.Â  County Council thereafter denied Quail Hill's request to rezone\r\n  the property from RS-1 to RU.Â  Id. at 229, 692 S.E.2d at 502.Â  Quail\r\n  Hill did not appeal from the County's decision, but instead brought a civil\r\n  action alleging, among other claims, negligence and negligent\r\n  misrepresentation.Â  Id.\r\nThis Court found Quail\r\n  Hill's claims for negligence/negligent misrepresentation (which were treated as\r\n  one claim) based on the incorrect zoning information failed as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  Id. at 240-41, 692 S.E.2d at 508-09.Â  We ruled Quail Hill could\r\n  not justifiably rely on the representations of County staff as to the proper\r\n  zoning designation because the plaintiff could have reviewed the Official\r\n  Zoning Map to ascertain the correct zoning classification of the property.Â  Id. at 241, 692 S.E.2d at 509.Â  Further, we held that misrepresentations as to\r\n  matters of law are not actionable and that the zoning classification of\r\n  property is a matter of law, not fact.Â  Id.; see also id. at 238, 692 S.E.2d at 507 (recognizing that the zoning classification of\r\n  property is a matter of law).\r\nSimilarly, in the current\r\n  appeal, there was a mistake made in advising the property owner of the\r\n  property's legal zoning classification.Â  Brown incorrectly advised Carolina\r\n  Chloride, after its purchase, that the property was zoned M-2 based on his\r\n  review of the &quot;tax map.&quot;Â  Brown did not state that he had ever\r\n  reviewed the Official Zoning Map, however, and the only documents in the record\r\n  indicate that the Official Zoning Map has consistently listed this property as being\r\n  zoned RU, not M-2.Â  The County states part of the confusion might have arisen because\r\n  when IBM owned the 7.67 acres it sold to Carolina Chloride, it was part of a\r\n  larger parcel designated as Tax Map Number 17-400-04-02.Â  However, after the\r\n  7.67 acres were purchased by Carolina Chloride, the smaller parcel was assigned\r\n  a different identification, Tax Map Number 17-400-08-04.Â  It is unclear exactly\r\n  what precipitated the mistake in this case.Â  The zoning classifications of the\r\n  neighboring parcels in the area varied, however, so it could not be assumed\r\n  that all of the property in the area held the same classification.\r\nThe fact that the error was\r\n  made by Brown, the Zoning Administrator, rather than another County official,\r\n  does not negate the fundamental principle recognized in Quail Hill that\r\n  no action will generally lie for a misrepresentation as to a matter of law.Â  Quail\r\n    Hill, 387 S.C. at 241, 692 S.E.2d at 509.Â  All individuals are presumed to\r\n  know the law, including the nature and extent of a government official's\r\n  authority, and they are charged with the knowledge that an ordinance may be\r\n  changed only through compliance with proper procedures.Â  Meyer v. Santema,\r\n  559 N.W.2d 251 (S.D. 1997).Â  In Meyer, the court observed that the &quot;City's\r\n  misrepresentations concerned interpretation and implementation of a zoning\r\n    ordinance, which is a matter of lawâ€”misrepresentations of law are not\r\n  actionable.&quot;Â  Id. at 255 (emphasis added).\r\nAlthough Brown opined that\r\n  the property was M-2, he stated he was referring to a tax map, not the Official\r\n  Zoning Map, and only the Official Zoning Map and the County ordinances contain\r\n  the controlling property zoning classifications.Â  See Richland County,\r\n  S.C., Code Â§ 26-33 (2003) (&quot;[T]he official copy of the zoning map\r\n  maintained in the office of the zoning administrator plus official records of\r\n  the clerk of court regarding actions of the county council to amend district\r\n  boundaries shall constitute the only official description of the location of\r\n  zoning district boundaries, and persons having recourse to this ordinance for\r\n  any purpose are hereby so notified.&quot;).Â  \r\nFurther, although Brown\r\n  stated the &quot;tax map&quot; had been &quot;amended&quot; to reflect M-2\r\n  zoning, only County Council can enact legislation to change a parcel's legal\r\n  zoning classification in compliance with the procedures outlined in the\r\n  Richland County Code, and such amendments are thereafter officially recorded\r\n  and reflected on the Official Zoning Map.Â  Brown, as the Zoning Administrator,\r\n  did not have the authority to &quot;amend&quot; the Official Zoning Map or an\r\n  ordinance.Â  Rather, only County Council can perform this legislative act. Â See id. Â§ 26-401 (&quot;Requests for amendments shall be submitted in\r\n  writing to the zoning administrator whose duty it shall be to present such\r\n  amendment requests to the planning commission for review and to the county\r\n  council for determination.&quot;).Â  In this case, Brown was not authorized to\r\n  amend the property's zoning classification and since no Official Zoning Map\r\n  ever indicated the property was zoned anything but RU, Carolina Chloride could\r\n  not rely upon Brown's representation as to this matter of law.\r\nIn Northernaire\r\n  Productions, Inc. v. Crow Wing County, 244 N.W.2d 279 (Minn. 1976), the\r\n  Supreme Court of Minnesota held county officials are not liable in tort for negligently\r\n  misrepresenting the legal requirements of their zoning ordinance to members of\r\n  the public who rely on that misrepresentation.Â  The plaintiffs, promoters of a\r\n  rock concert, sued for damages after they were erroneously advised of the\r\n  zoning requirements for the area where they had planned to stage a concert.Â  Id. at 280.Â  The court stated &quot;the alleged misrepresentation by the county\r\n  officials in the case at bar concerned interpretation of the zoning ordinance,\r\n  a matter of law.&quot;Â  Id. at 281. Â The court stated the general rule\r\n  is &quot;misrepresentation of law is not actionable.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe court noted its holding\r\n  was partly &quot;based on considerations of public policy.&quot; Id. at\r\n  282. There was no dispute that the alleged misrepresentations were made in a\r\n  good-faith effort to respond to the plaintiffs' inquiries, and were concededly made\r\n  without malice or an intent to deceive.Â  Id.Â  The court observed:Â \r\n  &quot;To subject county officials to the prospect of liability for innocent\r\n  misrepresentation would discourage their participation in local government or\r\n  inhibit them from discharging responsibilities inherent in their offices.Â  Their\r\n  reluctance to express opinions would frustrate dialogue which is indispensable\r\n  to the ongoing operation of government.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe agree with this\r\n  reasoning.Â  To hold otherwise would impose an impossible burden on the County (and\r\n  taxpayers) to act, in effect, as an insurer of all information given by County\r\n  employees under all circumstances.Â  Due to the sheer volume of inquiries\r\n  processed by the County, it would be unreasonable to impose a requirement of\r\n  100% fail-proof accuracy under the threat of tort liability on matters of law.[2]\r\nAlthough it is certainly unfortunate\r\n  that a mistake occurred in this case, Carolina Chloride had no legal right to\r\n  rely solely upon the representations of County personnel and should have\r\n  consulted the official record to determine the legal zoning classification of\r\n  its property.Â  Carolina Chloride's owner and its broker are both experienced in\r\n  business matters, but it appears that neither Morgan nor his broker personally\r\n  inspected the County's official records prior to making a sizable investment in\r\n  developing the property.Â  Despite Carolina Chloride's contention that it is a\r\n  distinguishable allegation, we find its assertion that the County failed to\r\n  properly maintain its zoning records merely restates the same essential\r\n  accusation regarding the erroneous information it was given regarding the property's\r\n  legal zoning classification.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial judge's grant of a\r\n  directed verdict to the County was proper and we reverse the determination of\r\n  the Court of Appeals as to these two claims.Â  \r\nWe take this opportunity,\r\n  however, to encourage the County to make every reasonable effort to reduce the\r\n  chances of such errors occurring in the future.Â  For example, routinely\r\n  informing inquiring property owners that the legal status of the property may\r\n  be definitively ascertained only through a check of the public records and implementing\r\n  a system of having more than one employee check the zoning status would all\r\n  serve to heighten the public's awareness that zoning is a legal matter than\r\n  cannot be altered by the representations of County employees.Â  Although for\r\n  public policy reasons the County is not held liable for every innocent error or\r\n  mistake made by its employees, the County should make every reasonable effort\r\n  to minimize the chances of such mistakes occurring, which will benefit both the\r\n  public and the County.\r\n (2)Â  Additional Grounds for Directed\r\n  Verdict\r\nThe County\r\n  further argues a directed verdict is appropriate on the claims for negligence\r\n  and negligent misrepresentation based on Carolina Chloride's alleged failure to\r\n  exhaust its administrative remedies and the application of immunity under the\r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  Because we have found these claims fail as a\r\n  matter of law for the reasons stated above, we need not reach the County's\r\n  remaining arguments.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  CAROLINA CHLORIDE'S APPEAL\r\nThe Court has also granted a\r\n  cross-petition for a writ of certiorari filed by Carolina Chloride, which\r\n  raises two issues. \r\n(1)Â Â Â Â  Inverse Condemnation\r\n  ClaimÂ  \r\n Carolina Chloride first argues the Court of Appeals\r\n  erred in upholding the trial judge's directed verdict for the County on its inverse\r\n  condemnation claim.Â  Carolina Chloride argues Hicks's 2003 letter constitutes\r\n  &quot;affirmative conduct&quot; that was not a simple mistake, but &quot;a\r\n  ruling by the County that reversed the existing M-2 zoning designation,&quot;\r\n  causing it harm.\r\n Inverse condemnation is a cause of action by a property\r\n  owner against a governmental entity to recover the value of property that has\r\n  been effectively &quot;taken&quot; by the governmental entity, although not\r\n  through the process of eminent domain.Â  Kiriakides v. Sch. Dist. of\r\n    Greenville County, 382 S.C. 8, 675 S.E.2d 439 (2009).Â  &quot;An inverse condemnation may result from the government's physical\r\n  appropriation of private property, or it may result from government-imposed\r\n  limitations on the use of private property.&quot;Â  Byrd v. City of\r\n    Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 656, 620 S.E.2d 76, 79 (2005).\r\nThe second\r\n  method, regulatory inverse condemnation,\r\n  requires proof of two elements:Â  (1) affirmative conduct, and (2) a taking.Â  Id. at 657, 620 S.E.2d at 80.Â  When the claim stems from an allegation of\r\na temporary denial of less than all\r\n  economically viable use of the property, the central inquiry is whether the\r\n  delay ever became unreasonable.Â  Id. at 660, 620 S.E.2d at 81.\r\n  &quot;Until regulatory delay becomes unreasonable, there is no taking&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nTwo circumstances are important:Â  (1) the economic\r\n  impact on the claimant, especially the extent to which the governmental entity\r\n  has interfered with the claimant's investment-backed expectations, and (2) the\r\n  character of the governmental action.Â  Id.  at 659, 620 S.E.2d at 80.\r\n&quot;To prevail in such an action, a\r\n  plaintiff must prove 'an affirmative, aggressive, and positive act' by the\r\n  government entity that caused the alleged damage to the plaintiff's property.&quot;Â  WRB Ltd. P'ship v. County of Lexington, Â 369 S.C. 30, 32, 630 S.E.2d\r\n  479, 481&nbsp;(2006) (citations omitted).\r\nÂ &quot;A landowner has the\r\n  burden of proving damages for the taking of the landowner's property, whether\r\n  through condemnation proceedings or by inverse condemnation.&quot;Â  Kiriakides, 382 S.C. at 14, 675\r\n  S.E.2d at 442.Â &quot;Not\r\n  all damages that are suffered by a private property owner at the hands of the\r\n  governmental agency are compensable.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The property\r\n  itself must suffer some diminution in substance, or it must be rendered\r\n  intrinsically less valuable.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n&quot;[I]n an inverse condemnation\r\n  case, the trial judge will determine whether a claim has been established; the\r\n  issue of compensation may then be submitted to a jury at either party's\r\n  request.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Cobb v. South Carolina Dep't of Transp.,\r\n  365 S.C. 360, 365, 618 S.E.2d 299, 301 (2005)).\r\n In the current appeal, the trial judge noted that\r\n  Carolina Chloride did not appeal from Hicks's decision, and he did not believe\r\n  there could be a claim for a temporary regulatory taking where the event\r\n  complained of was never appealed.Â  The trial judge further stated that he\r\n  believed the case of Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 620\r\n  S.E.2d 76 (2005) was controlling and that there had been no regulatory taking.\r\n Upon review, the Court of Appeals found the trial judge\r\n  properly granted a directed verdict for the County on the inverse condemnation\r\n  claim.Â  Carolina Chloride, 382 S.C. at 654, 677 S.E.2d at 903.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals found the only time frame in which an alleged taking could\r\n  have occurred would have been between February 13, 2003, the date of the County's\r\n  letter, and November 4, 2003, when the County amended the property's zoning to\r\n  M-2, because at all other times Carolina Chloride used the property in\r\n  compliance with M-2 zoning and without any governmental interference.Â  Id. at 654, 677 S.E.2d at 902.\r\n The Court of Appeals further observed that &quot;[t]he\r\n  sole evidence Carolina Chloride presents of governmental action constituting an\r\n  affirmative act is Hicks' alleged mistaken assessment of the zoning ordinances\r\n  applicable to Carolina Chloride's property.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appeals determined a mistaken assessment of the zoning ordinances applicable to\r\n  Carolina Chloride's property was not an &quot;affirmative, aggressive, positive\r\n  act&quot; that damaged Carolina Chloride's property.Â  Id. (citing WRB\r\n    Ltd. P'ship v. County of Lexington, 369 S.C. 30, 630 S.E.2d 479 (2006)).\r\n We agree the trial judge's grant of a directed verdict on\r\n  the inverse condemnation should be affirmed for several reasons.\r\nIf the trial judge is deemed\r\n  to have alternatively ruled Carolina Chloride failed to exhaust its\r\n  administrative remedies, this ruling, right or wrong, would require affirmance\r\n  as Carolina Chloride did not timely dispute this alternative ground.Â  See,\r\n    e.g. Richland County v. Palmetto Cablevision, 261 S.C. 222, 199\r\n  S.E.2d 168 (1973) (stating an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, becomes the\r\n  law of the case).\r\nAs to the finding that there\r\n  was no regulatory taking, this is amply supported by the record.Â  There is no\r\n  evidence that Hicks erred in advising Carolina Chloride in 2003 that its\r\n  property was zoned RU.Â  There is no Official Zoning Map or any ordinance in the\r\n  record indicating that the property was ever legally zoned anything other than\r\n  RU prior to County Council officially rezoning the property to M-2 in late 2003.Â \r\n  Further, the County's notification in 2003 that the property was zoned RU, and\r\n  the County's requirement that Carolina Chloride follow authorized procedures in\r\n  having the property rezoned is a proper exercise of its governmental authority.Â \r\n  To the extent any other mistakes were made by County personnel, such mistakes\r\n  do not constitute &quot;an affirmative, positive, aggressive act&quot; such as\r\n  would support the finding of a taking.Â  Cf. Collins v. City\r\n    of Greenville, 233 S.C. 506,\r\n  105 S.E.2d 704 (1958) (finding no positive act where the city, in attempting to\r\n  unclog a sewer line, made a mistake that caused an overflow and inadvertently damaged\r\n  the plaintiff's property).\r\nWe agree with the Court of\r\n  Appeals that Carolina Chloride used its property as if it were zoned M-2 at all\r\n  times.Â  Carolina Chloride itself delayed for six months in applying for a\r\n  zoning change after Hicks advised it to do so.Â  Once Carolina Chloride\r\n  submitted its application, it was quickly processed and approved in three\r\n  months as Hicks had estimated in his February 2003 letter.Â  During this time,\r\n  all of Carolina Chloride's existing operations were allowed to continue as if\r\n  it had an M-2 designation without interference.Â  \r\nNormal delays in obtaining\r\n  building permits, changes in zoning ordinances, variances, and the like have\r\n  long been considered permissible exercises of police power and a person\r\n  &quot;is not entitled to compensation merely because he had to obtain a zoning change\r\n  to develop his property.&quot;Â  Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650,\r\n  660, 620 S.E.2d 76, 81&nbsp;(2005).\r\nIn Byrd, this Court held an\r\n  eleven-month delay in acting on a property owner's petition to rezone a portion\r\n  of his property did not effect a taking as the delay did not affect the\r\n  property owner's ability to continue using the land and did not cause a\r\n  disproportionate economic impact upon the owner even though he alleged he had wanted\r\n  to sell a portion of the property.Â  This Court stated continuation of the existing\r\n  use of the property is the property owner's &quot;primary expectation&quot;\r\n  when considering an owner's investment-backed expectations for the property.Â  Id. at 662, 620 S.E.2d at 82 (citing Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. City of N.Y.,\r\n  438 U.S. 104 (1978)).Â  We find Byrd is controlling here and that the\r\n  trial judge and the Court of Appeals properly concluded Carolina Chloride's\r\n  claim for inverse condemnation fails as a matter of law.\r\n(2)&nbsp; Exclusion of\r\n  Deposition\r\n Carolina Chloride next argues the Court of Appeals erred\r\n  in upholding the exclusion of Terry Brown's deposition.\r\n At trial, Carolina Chloride wished to introduce the\r\n  deposition it had taken of Brown, who was formerly the County's Zoning\r\n  Administrator.Â  At the time of his deposition, however, Brown had left this\r\n  position and become a member of the Board of Adjustment.[3]Â  The trial judge excluded the\r\n  deposition based on the County's objection pursuant to Rule 32(a)(2), SCRCP,\r\n  which provides in relevant part that the deposition &quot;of anyone who at the\r\n  time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent&quot;\r\n  of a governmental agency, corporation, partnership, or association that is a\r\n  party may be used for any purpose by an adverse party.Â  The County maintained\r\n  the deposition was not admissible because Brown did not fall within the scope\r\n  of the rule.\r\n The trial judge rejected Carolina Chloride's only\r\n  argument that Brown met the requirements of Rule 32(a)(2) because he was\r\n  currently a member of the Board of Adjustment.Â  The judge's ruling applied only\r\n  to Brown's deposition testimony and did not prevent Brown from being called as\r\n  a witness at trial.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n The Court of Appeals found no abuse of discretion,\r\n  stating Carolina Chloride &quot;did not lay any foundation as to why Brown's\r\n  role on the Board qualifies under Rule 32(a)(2).&quot;Â  Carolina Chloride,\r\n  382 S.C. at 644, 677 S.E.2d at 897.Â  The court observed Carolina Chloride could\r\n  have attempted to demonstrate that Brown qualified as an unavailable witness\r\n  under Rule 32(a)(3), SCRCP or, if Brown was available, he should have been\r\n  called as a witness at trial.Â  Id.Â  The court did not reach Carolina\r\n  Chloride's additional argument referencing Rule 801(d)(2), SCRE because it was\r\n  not raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge and, therefore, was not\r\n  preserved since an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  Id. at 645 n.4, 677 S.E.2d at 897 n.4 (citing Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330\r\n  S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998)).\r\n Carolina Chloride now asserts the Court of Appeals erred\r\n  in excluding the deposition because the County asked Carolina Chloride not to\r\n  contact or have ex parte discussions with Brown, so it honored\r\n  this request and took his deposition instead.Â  Carolina Chloride contends the\r\n  County treated Brown as its employee by making this request, citing Rule 3.4(f)(1)\r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR (observing a lawyer\r\n  should not request a person other than a client to refrain from voluntarily\r\n  giving relevant information unless the person is a relative, employee, or other\r\n  agent of a client); therefore, Brown should be considered the County's employee\r\n  for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Rule 32(a)(2), SCRCP.Â  \r\nAlthough we are deeply\r\n  troubled by the County's seemingly inconsistent positions regarding this witness,\r\n  Carolina Chloride's argument was not raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  judge so as to preserve it for review.Â  Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76,\r\n  497 S.E.2d at 733.Â  We note, however, that Carolina Chloride did proffer Brown's\r\n  deposition for the record and it has failed to demonstrate any prejudice in its\r\n  exclusion, in any event.Â  See generally Fields v. J.\r\n    Haynes Waters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545, 557, 658 S.E.2d 80, 86\r\n  (2008) (&quot;[T]o warrant reversal based on the\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence, the appealing party must show both the error of the ruling and prejudice.&quot;).\r\nIII.Â  CONCLUSION\r\nAs to the County's appeal, we reverse the Court of\r\n  Appeals and hold the trial judge properly granted a directed verdict to the\r\n  County on the claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation.Â  As to\r\n  Carolina Chloride's appeal, we affirm the Court of Appeals, which upheld the\r\n  exclusion of Brown's deposition and the grant of a directed verdict to the County\r\n  on the claim for inverse condemnation.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because Carolina Chloride is the\r\n  initiating party for this lawsuit, we have returned the captioning to its\r\n  designation as it appeared in the trial court. \r\n[2] We offer no opinion on the\r\n  County's potential liability for misrepresentations not involving a statement\r\n  of law.Â  \r\n[3]Â  See Richland County, S.C.,\r\n  Code Â§ 26-602 (2003) (stating the Board of Adjustment decides\r\n  appeals from any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the\r\n  Zoning Administrator in enforcing the Zoning Ordinance); see also id.

Brandt produced a fraudulent\r\n  document in a civil proceeding, a circuit court held Brandt in civil and\r\n  criminal contempt.Â  In turn, the court dismissed Brandt's legal malpractice\r\n  action with prejudice and ordered him to serve six months in jail and pay the defendants'\r\n  attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $883,621.93.\r\nSubsequently, based on the\r\n  fraudulent document, the State indicted Brandt for forgery in an amount greater\r\n  than $5,000.[1]Â \r\n  After a jury found Brandt guilty of the indicted offense, the trial judge\r\n  sentenced Brandt to ten years' imprisonment, suspended upon the service of four\r\n  years, followed by five years' probation and payment of restitution in the\r\n  amount of $883, 621.93.Â  Brandt appeals his forgery conviction and sentence.Â \r\n  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nA.&nbsp; Legal Malpractice Action\r\nIn 1998, Brandt sued Elizabeth\r\n  K. Gooding and her law firm Gooding &amp; Gooding, P.A. (collectively\r\n  &quot;Gooding&quot;) for legal malpractice based on Gooding's representation of\r\n  him in a real estate transaction. Â During the course of discovery, Brandt presented\r\n  to his attorney a document (the &quot;Edisto Farm letter&quot;), which appeared\r\n  to have been sent by Ronald L. Summers, the Senior Vice President of Edisto\r\n  Farm Credit (the lender in the transaction) to Brandt on September 18, 1995.Â \r\n  Brandt also provided the letter to his malpractice expert. Â The letter was then\r\n  introduced in the expert's deposition and used by him to opine that Gooding had\r\n  committed malpractice.Â  \r\nThe document, if authentic,\r\n  would have imputed knowledge to Gooding of a conflict of interest related to\r\n  the representation of Brandt in the real estate transaction.Â  Gooding, however,\r\n  claimed the document was fraudulent.Â  As a result, Gooding requested a hearing\r\n  to determine whether the document was authentic.Â  Additionally, Gooding requested\r\n  the court hold Brandt in contempt and award costs if such authenticity could\r\n  not be established.Â  Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein delayed a contempt\r\n  hearing until it could be determined whether the document was authentic. [2]Â  \r\nIn subsequent motions before Circuit\r\n  Court Judge Paul M. Burch, Gooding moved for summary judgment, dismissal of the\r\n  legal malpractice action, and contempt.Â  At the hearing on these motions,[3] Gooding presented an expert in document examination and authenticity who opined\r\n  that the letter was fraudulent.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the\r\n  hearing, Judge Burch found Brandt in contempt for committing fraud on the\r\n  court.Â  As a result, he dismissed Brandt's Complaint as a sanction and granted\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Gooding.Â  Judge Burch also held Brandt in criminal\r\n  contempt for perpetrating a fraud upon the court and sentenced him to six months'\r\n  imprisonment.Â  \r\nApproximately one month later,\r\n  Judge Burch held a hearing regarding additional sanctions against Brandt.Â  By\r\n  order dated January 9, 2002, Judge Burch memorialized his earlier oral ruling\r\n  regarding contempt and the concomitant sanctions.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this Court affirmed\r\n  Judge Burch's grant of summary judgment to Gooding and his findings of civil\r\n  and criminal contempt.Â  Brandt v. Gooding, 368 S.C. 618, 629, 630 S.E.2d\r\n  259, 264 (2006).\r\nFollowing the issuance of this\r\n  Court's opinion, Judge Burch held a hearing to establish the amount of\r\n  attorneys' fees and costs that should be awarded under the prior contempt order\r\n  of January 9, 2002.Â  On August 13, 2007, he entered an order that required\r\n  Brandt to pay $255,353.44 to Gooding &amp; Gooding, P.A. and $628,268.49 to Elizabeth\r\n  K. Gooding.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this Court reversed\r\n  Judge Burch's award to Gooding on the ground there was no competent evidence to\r\n  support the finding that Gooding incurred any attorneys' fees and costs.Â  Brandt\r\n    v. Gooding, Op. No. 2010-MO-010 (Sup. Ct. filed Apr. 12, 2010).Â  As to\r\n  Gooding &amp; Gooding's award, this Court modified the award holding that the\r\n  law firm was only entitled to &quot;those fees and costs incurred by Respondent\r\n  law firm from the date Brandt introduced the fraudulent letter (April 4, 2001)\r\n  to the date the trial court denied Brandt's motion for reconsideration (May 16,\r\n  2002) [and] were directly related to Brandt's introduction of the letter.&quot;\r\n  Â Brandt, slip op. at 2. Â As a result, we modified the circuit court's\r\n  order so as to award $80,547.89, plus applicable interest accrued to Gooding\r\n  &amp; Gooding.Â  Id.\r\nB.&nbsp; Forgery Conviction\r\nDuring the pendency of the\r\n  above-outlined proceedings, a Charleston County grand jury indicted Brandt for\r\n  forgery in an amount greater than $5,000 based on the September 18, 1995 Edisto\r\n  Farm letter.\r\nIn the course of Brandt's jury\r\n  trial, which was conducted by Circuit Court Judge Roger M. Young, the State presented\r\n  testimony regarding the underlying real estate transaction, the legal\r\n  malpractice action, and the authenticity of the Edisto Farm letter. \r\nIn terms of the real estate\r\n  transaction, Gooding testified she performed the closing for an Aiken real estate\r\n  transaction involving Brandt and the Lombard Corporation, whose partners\r\n  included Don Houck and Johnny Godley.Â  The actual closing took place on\r\n  December 14, 1995.Â  According to Gooding, she learned of Brandt's involvement only\r\n  a few weeks before the closing.Â  Gooding acknowledged that Brandt had filed a\r\n  legal malpractice claim against her primarily on the ground that Gooding had\r\n  failed to properly protect his interest in the land deal.Â  Gooding disputed\r\n  Brandt's claim on the basis that she had not been aware that Brandt was a party\r\n  to the transaction until shortly before the December 1995 closing date.Â  When\r\n  presented with the September 18, 1995 Edisto Farm letter,[4] Gooding claimed she had not been hired by Brandt by the date of the letter, nor\r\n  was it her job to secure financing from Edisto Farm Credit.Â  Had the letter\r\n  been true, Gooding testified that &quot;[i]t would have established my\r\n  connection with Mr. Brandt in this matter and this transaction almost three\r\n  months before I had any knowledge of him being involved.&quot;Â  She further\r\n  testified the letter contradicted the sworn testimony she had given in a deposition\r\n  regarding the legal malpractice case.\r\nLawrence Richter, Jr., Brandt's\r\n  attorney who filed the legal malpractice action, testified Brandt came to him\r\n  alleging that Gooding had &quot;purported to represent all three (Brandt,\r\n  Godley, and Houck) but did not represent them equally.Â  She did not protect [his]\r\n  rights in the same way that the other two members' rights were protected.&quot; \r\nBecause one of the key issues\r\n  in dispute concerned Gooding's knowledge of when Brandt became involved in the\r\n  land transaction, Richter deposed Gooding, Brandt, and Summers.Â  Richter also\r\n  retained Professor John Freeman as an expert witness to support Brandt's claim\r\n  of Gooding's malpractice.Â  \r\nRichter testified that on\r\n  December 27, 2000, he and his law partner met with Brandt and Freeman regarding\r\n  the case.Â  During the meeting, Brandt produced a faxed copy of a letter he\r\n  claimed to have just discovered in his home.Â  The letter was dated September\r\n  18, 1995, was on Edisto Farm Credit letterhead, and was purportedly signed by\r\n  Summers.Â  Subsequently, the letter was introduced into the case for the first\r\n  time during Freeman's deposition in April 2001.Â  When Gooding's counsel questioned\r\n  the authenticity of the letter, Richter believed it was necessary to retain a\r\n  professional examiner to authenticate the document.Â  Brandt, however, directed\r\n  Richter not to have the document examined.\r\nRichter acknowledged the\r\n  letter significantly impacted the case against Gooding in that the date of the\r\n  letter &quot;together with the statements in the letter, would have supported\r\n  Mr. Brandt's version of the facts that Ms. Gooding knew very early on of his\r\n  involvement in the real estate transaction in issue, and it would have been a\r\n  statement to that effect by somebody else other than Mr. Brandt.&quot;Â \r\n  Assuming the letter to be accurate and true, Richter believed it would have\r\n  substantially increased the value of Brandt's case, &quot;far more than\r\n  $5,000.&quot;Â  \r\nIn April 2001, Marvin Dawson,\r\n  a private document examiner, analyzed the letter produced by Brandt and\r\n  concluded the signature on the letter was not genuine.Â  Dawson further\r\n  determined that the letter was not produced on the computer or typewriter used\r\n  by the secretary at Edisto Farm Credit, was not sent from the fax machine at\r\n  Edisto Farm Credit, did not have a watermark like other Edisto Farm Credit\r\n  paper, and had microscopic security dots, which represented technology that\r\n  post-dated the letter. \r\nAfter Dawson's review, the\r\n  letter was sent to the United States Secret Service for further analysis. Â Susan\r\n  Fortunato, a document analyst for the Secret Service, analyzed the Edisto Farm\r\n  letter.Â  During her examination of the letter, Fortunato discovered a serial\r\n  number in a pattern of yellow dots. Â Based on these dots, Fortunato determined\r\n  that the letter had been produced on December 10, 2000 around 3:00 p.m. using a\r\n  Xerox machine with the serial #043391 located at a Kinko's copy shop in\r\n  Augusta, Georgia.Â  Fortunato also learned that the copy machine was not\r\n  installed in the Kinko's shop until January 6, 2000. Â Because the pattern of\r\n  yellow dots did not exist until 2000, Fortunato definitively testified that the\r\n  document &quot;didn't exist until the year 2000.&quot; \r\nIn addition to the testimony\r\n  of the document examiners, the State presented the testimony of Summers and\r\n  Dell Murdaugh, the administrative loan assistant who prepared the documents for\r\n  the real estate loan.Â  \r\nMurdaugh testified that\r\n  between 1995 and 2000 she typed all the correspondence for Summers and assisted\r\n  in preparing loan documents. Â Â Although it was customary to retain copies of\r\n  all correspondence, Murdaugh testified there was not a copy of the September\r\n  18, 1995 letter in her file. Â Murdaugh also believed the letter was false in\r\n  that it was missing the typist's initials, was not formatted like the standard\r\n  documents, and had different spacing and wording than normally used.Â \r\n  Additionally, Murdaugh testified she had reviewed the Edisto Farm Credit\r\n  telephone records and determined there were no calls made to Brandt on the date\r\n  of the faxed letter.\r\nSummers also testified the\r\n  letter was a forgery as he did not dictate, write, or sign the letter.Â  He\r\n  further noted there was no copy of the letter in his files.Â  In terms of the\r\n  text of the letter, Summers stated the letter conflicted with his understanding\r\n  of the transaction and the terminology was inconsistent with the typical manner\r\n  in which loans were handled by Edisto Farm Credit. \r\n The\r\n  State presented Professor Freeman as its final witness.Â  Freeman recounted the\r\n  December 27, 2000 meeting where he was apprised of the Edisto Farm letter.Â \r\n  Freeman believed the letter was &quot;very, very significant&quot; and\r\n  strengthened Brandt's credibility given the date of the letter and the fact\r\n  that it was purportedly written by a third party.Â  He further testified the\r\n  document &quot;harkens back to September,&quot; was &quot;consistent with the\r\n  Brandt story,&quot; and was the &quot;very opposite of what Beth Gooding has said\r\n  under oath.&quot;Â  In terms of the effect of the letter, Freeman opined that it\r\n  &quot;took the probability of winning (the lawsuit), way up,&quot; and\r\n  substantially increased Brandt's potential for recovery more than $5,000. \r\nAt the close of the State's\r\n  case, Brandt moved for a directed verdict and renewed his pre-trial motions,\r\n  which included a motion to dismiss on Double Jeopardy grounds.Â  Judge Young\r\n  denied all of Brandt's motions.Â  \r\nAfter Brandt's counsel\r\n  indicated that the defense would not present any evidence, Judge Young held a\r\n  charge conference.Â  During the conference, Brandt's counsel requested a number\r\n  of jury instructions, including an instruction on &quot;legal efficacy&quot;\r\n  related to the evidentiary value of the Edisto Farm letter. Â Judge Young denied\r\n  the request to charge because he was &quot;not aware that [the instruction]\r\n  would be a correct [statement of] South Carolina law.&quot;Â  In response,\r\n  Brandt's counsel claimed that &quot;South Carolina laws have not addressed this\r\n  issue.&quot;\r\nUltimately, the jury convicted\r\n  Brandt of forgery in an amount greater than $5,000.Â  Following the verdict, Judge\r\n  Young delayed the imposition of the sentence to allow for the preparation of a\r\n  pre-sentence report and to allow time for any restitution issues to be\r\n  addressed. \r\nBrandt filed post-trial\r\n  motions, which included a motion for a new trial on the ground the Edisto Farm\r\n  letter lacked &quot;legal efficacy&quot; and there was insufficient evidence\r\n  presented as to the value of the letter.Â  Judge Young denied each of Brandt's\r\n  post-trial motions.\r\nOn September 11, 2009, Judge\r\n  Young held a sentencing hearing.Â  During the hearing, the parties indicated\r\n  that no restitution agreement had been reached. Â At the conclusion of the\r\n  hearing, Judge Young ordered restitution in the amount of $883,621.93. Â He then\r\n  sentenced Brandt to ten years' imprisonment, suspended upon the service of four\r\n  years, followed by five years' probation and payment of restitution.Â  \r\nFollowing the denial of his\r\n  motion for reconsideration, Brandt appealed his conviction and sentence to the\r\n  Court of Appeals.Â  This Court certified this appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\n  SCACR.\r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.&nbsp; Double Jeopardy\r\nBrandt contends the trial judge erred in failing to\r\n  dismiss the forgery indictment and in failing to grant his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict on the ground that Double Jeopardy barred the forgery\r\n  prosecution.Â  Because Brandt had previously been convicted of criminal contempt\r\n  based on the Edisto Farm letter, he claims the Double Jeopardy Clause of the\r\n  United States and South Carolina Constitutions prohibited the successive\r\n  forgery prosecution for the same offense.[5]Â \r\n  In support of his position, Brandt primarily relies on the United States\r\n  Supreme Court case of United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688 (1993), a\r\n  case in which the Supreme Court held that Double Jeopardy protection applies to\r\n  non-summary criminal contempt prosecutions as it does in other criminal\r\n  prosecutions.[6]Â  \r\n Brandt\r\n  raised his Double Jeopardy claim in his pre-trial motions and his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict.Â  In denying Brandt's motion, the trial judge stated:\r\n\r\nBut there are two parts to double jeopardy.Â  There is\r\n  the same conduct, which I find, [its] the same conduct, but under the statute\r\n  for forgery, there is no requirement that the forged document be introduced\r\n  into a legal proceeding. Â So as I see it, the moment that [Brandt] produced\r\n  that, theoretically, to his lawyers, he procured the use of it, and that, in\r\n  and of itself right there, would support a forgery conviction, even though it\r\n  perhaps never got used in the legal proceeding. Â So in my mind, at least, that\r\n  is what - - it doesn't meet the second element of double jeopardy, and that is\r\n  the same elements, the Blockburger test, if you will.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial judge that the Double Jeopardy\r\n  Clause did not bar the State's prosecution of Brandt for forgery.Â  Although our\r\n  reasons will be more fully discussed, we hold the trial judge's decision is\r\n  correct because:Â  (1) the facial similarities of Dixon to Brandt's case do\r\n  not render Dixon dispositive; (2) our appellate courts, in post-Dixon decisions, have repeatedly employed the &quot;same elements test&quot; in\r\n  analyzing purported Double Jeopardy violations; and (3) the elements for the\r\n  offenses of criminal contempt and forgery are decidedly different and, thus,\r\n  constitute separate and distinct offenses.Â  \r\n The\r\n  Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions\r\n  operate to protect citizens from being twice placed in jeopardy of life or\r\n  liberty for the same offense.Â  The United States Constitution, which is\r\n  applicable to South Carolina via the Fourteenth Amendment provides:Â \r\n  &quot;[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in\r\n  jeopardy of life or limb . . . .&quot;Â  U.S. Const. amend. V.Â  Similarly, the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution states:Â  &quot;No person shall be subject for the\r\n  same offense to be twice put in jeopardy for life or liberty . . . .&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12. \r\n In\r\n  interpreting the Double Jeopardy clause, this Court has stated that &quot;[t]he\r\n  Double Jeopardy Clause protects against a second prosecution for the same\r\n  offense after acquittal or conviction, and protects against multiple\r\n  punishments for the same offense.&quot; Â Stevenson v. State, 335 S.C.\r\n  193, 198, 516 S.E.2d 434, 436 (1999).Â  &quot;A defendant may be severally\r\n  indicted and punished for separate offenses without being placed in double\r\n  jeopardy where a single act consists of two 'distinct' offenses.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Moyd, 321 S.C. 256, 258, 468 S.E.2d 7, 9 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n &quot;The\r\n  United States Supreme Court and the South Carolina Supreme Court have\r\n  determined that in the context of criminal penalties, the Blockburger v.\r\n    United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) 'same\r\n  elements' test is the sole test of double jeopardy in successive prosecutions\r\n  and multiple punishment cases.&quot;Â  State v.

Â§ 16-13-10(A)(2) (2003).Â  In interpreting this code section, our\r\n  appellate courts have found that &quot;[t]he three important factors requisite\r\n  to constitute forgery by uttering or publishing a forged instrument are:Â  (1)\r\n  it must be uttered or published as true or genuine, (2) it must be known by the\r\n  party uttering or publishing it that it is false, forged, or counterfeited, and\r\n  (3) there must be intent to prejudice, damage, or defraud another\r\n  person.&quot;Â  State v.

Kennerly, 337 S.C. 617, 620, 524 S.E.2d\r\n  837, 838 (1999).Â  A person may be found guilty of direct contempt if the\r\n  conduct interferes with judicial proceedings, exhibits disrespect for the\r\n  court, or hampers the parties or witnesses.Â  State v. Havelka, 285 S.C.\r\n  388, 389, 330 S.E.2d 288 (1985).Â  Direct contempt that occurs in the court's\r\n  presence may be immediately adjudged and sanctioned summarily.Â  Int'l Union,\r\n    United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 827, 114 S.

State\r\n    v. Pace, 337 S.C. 407, 417, 523 S.E.2d 466, 471 (Ct.

Zitter, Annotation, Contempt\r\n    Finding as Precluding Substantive Criminal Charges Relating to the Same\r\n    Transaction, 26 A.L.R.4th 950, 952 (1983 &amp; Supp. 2010) (discussing\r\n  state and federal cases where courts have ruled that double jeopardy safeguards\r\n  were not involved where a defendant found in contempt is later prosecuted under\r\n  penal statutes for the same actions; recognizing in those cases that &quot;the\r\n  purpose of contempt citations is to maintain the dignity of and respect for the\r\n  court and court proceedings, while the purpose of criminal charges is to punish\r\n  violators of society's norms&quot;). \r\nB.&nbsp; Directed Verdict Motion\r\nBrandt asserts the trial judge erred in denying his\r\n  motion for a directed verdict where the State failed to produce evidence to\r\n  establish that:Â  (1) the forged letter had &quot;legal efficacy&quot;; (2)\r\n  Brandt knew the letter was forged and presented it with intent to defraud; and (3)\r\n  the value of the forged letter was $5,000 or more. \r\n&quot;If there is any direct evidence or any\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused, the Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.&quot;\r\n  Â State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292-93, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  When\r\n  reviewing a denial of a directed\r\n  verdict, an appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in\r\n  the light most favorable to the State.Â  Id. at 292, 625 S.E.2d at 648. Â The\r\n  trial court should grant a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a\r\n  suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620,\r\n  625-26, 677 S.E.2d 603, 605-06 (2009).Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State\r\n  fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. Ladner, 373\r\n  S.C. 103, 120, 644 S.E.2d 684, 693 (2007). \r\nAs will be discussed, we find the trial\r\n  judge correctly denied Brandt's motion for a directed verdict.Â  Viewing the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there was sufficient\r\n  evidence to submit the offense of forgery to the jury.\r\n(1). &quot;Legal Efficacy&quot;\r\nAs to this ground, Brandt contends the\r\n  Edisto Farm letter lacks legal efficacy because it could not have served as the\r\n  foundation for the legal liability of Elizabeth Gooding or her law firm.Â  In\r\n  support of his argument, Brandt cites the Court of Appeals' decision in State\r\n    v. Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. 388, 649 S.E.2d 41 (Ct. App. 2007), aff'd,\r\n  387 S.C. 310, 692 S.E.2d 895 (2010).Â  Specifically, Brandt directs the Court's\r\n  attention to the following language:\r\n\r\nTo constitute forgery, it is essential\r\n  that the falsely made or altered instrument possess some apparent legal\r\n    efficacy; otherwise it would have no tendency to defraud.Â  As long as a\r\n  forged instrument is the apparent foundation of legal liability, the instrument\r\n  need not be complete in all its particulars to amount to forgery.\r\n\r\nId. at 402,\r\n  649 S.E.2d at 48 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). \r\n Additionally, Brandt avers the letter did not have legal\r\n  efficacy to support the forgery conviction as its sole value was to provide\r\n  evidence in the civil lawsuit.Â  Because Brandt believes he had a viable claim\r\n  for legal malpractice &quot;irrespective&quot; of the letter, he asserts the\r\n  letter had no legal efficacy.Â  Brandt explains that Gooding's conduct, and not\r\n  the letter, served as the basis for instituting his legal malpractice claim.\r\nIn support of these contentions, Brandt\r\n  relies on three out-of-state cases[7] and the following provision from Corpus Juris Secundum:\r\n\r\nThe element of forgery requiring that the\r\n  defendant has falsely made or altered an instrument purporting to have\r\n  &quot;legal efficacy&quot; does not include instances where the sole legal\r\n  value of the instrument is its potential use as evidence.\r\n\r\n37 C.J.S. Forgery Â§ 6 (Supp. 2010).\r\n We find Brandt's arguments fail for several reasons.Â  Initially,\r\n  Brandt employs an overly-narrow interpretation of the legal efficacy element.Â \r\n  Because this case involves a letter, as opposed to a traditionally-forged\r\n  negotiable document such as a check, Brandt attempts to negate the forgery\r\n  conviction on the ground a forged letter could not directly and definitively establish\r\n  Gooding's duty to Brandt.Â  \r\nOur appellate courts' decisions, including Lee-Grigg, have taken a broad approach as to what type of document can\r\n  constitute the basis of a forgery conviction and the requisite effect the\r\n  document must have on the alleged forgery victim.\r\nIn terms of the types of documents\r\n  involved in forgery, our appellate courts have not limited a conviction solely to\r\n  negotiable instruments nor have the courts precluded a conviction where the\r\n  forged document served as an evidentiary basis in a civil trial.Â  See, e.g., State v. Floyd, 36 S.C.L. (5 Strob.) 58 (1850) (considering conviction\r\n  involving a forged receipt that was used in the defense of the underlying civil\r\n  suit; stating &quot;[m]any statutes have been passed . . . to enlarge the range\r\n  of the common law as to the description of instruments that should be protected\r\n  against the cunning perpetrators of this offence&quot; to forge); State v.\r\n    Murray, 72 S.C. 508, 52 S.E. 189 (1905) (affirming forgery conviction involving\r\n  a lease that defendant had offered into evidence in a civil case for specific\r\n  performance of the contract); State v. Zimmerman, 79 S.C. 289, 60 S.E.\r\n  680 (1908) (affirming forgery conviction involving a false entry made in a\r\n  public record with intent to deceive and defraud).\r\nFurthermore, the requisite prejudicial\r\n  effect of a document in a forgery proceeding has been broadly construed by our\r\n  appellate courts.Â  See Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. at 402, 649 S.E.2d at\r\n  48 (discussing legal efficacy of a forged instrument and stating, &quot;Any\r\n  writing that may defraud or prejudice another, or that, if genuine, would have\r\n  legal effect or operate as the foundation of another man's liability may be the\r\n  subject of forgery. Â It is sufficient if the forged instrument, believed to be\r\n  genuine, might have operated to the prejudice of another.&quot;); State v. Webster, 88 S.C. 56, 58, 70 S.E. 422, 423 (1911) (&quot;The purpose of\r\n  the statute against forgeries is to protect society against fabrication,\r\n  falsification, and the uttering, publishing, and passing of forged instruments,\r\n  which, if genuine, would establish or defeat some claim, impose some duty, or\r\n  create some liability, or work some prejudice in law to another, in his right\r\n  of person or property.&quot; (citations omitted)); see also State v. Bullock,\r\n  54 S.C. 300, 311-12, 32 S.E. 424, 428-29 (1899) (&quot;It is not necessary to\r\n  state how the instrument could have been used for the purpose of fraud. Â It is\r\n  enough if it appears from the character of the instrument, together\r\n  with the provisions of the statute, that it might have been so used in\r\n  connection with other facts, real or simulated, either then existing, or with\r\n  which it was to be afterwards connected.&quot; (citation omitted)).[8] \r\nApplying our appellate courts' broad\r\n  interpretation of forgery, we conclude the State presented sufficient evidence\r\n  of this element to withstand Brandt's motion for a directed verdict as to the\r\n  legal efficacy of the Edisto Farm letter. \r\nGooding testified the letter, if found to\r\n  be true, would have established her connection with Brandt almost three months\r\n  before she had knowledge of him being involved in the land transaction.Â \r\n  Equally important, Gooding testified the letter would have contradicted her sworn\r\n  deposition testimony.Â  Gooding also stated that &quot;everyone has pointed to\r\n  that letter from the very beginning as some evidence of [her]\r\n  culpability.&quot; \r\nIn addition to Gooding, other witnesses\r\n  testified regarding the significance of the letter.Â  Richter, Brandt's attorney\r\n  who initiated the legal malpractice claim, confirmed Gooding's assessment that\r\n  the letter would have significantly impacted the legal malpractice lawsuit.Â  In\r\n  his testimony, Professor Freeman emphasized that the letter was &quot;very,\r\n  very significant,&quot; affected Gooding's credibility as a witness and, in\r\n  turn, strengthened Brandt's case against Gooding.Â  Summers, who adamantly\r\n  denied his signature on the letter, also confirmed the significance of the\r\n  letter in that it directly contradicted his deposition testimony and would have\r\n  established Brandt's version of what transpired regarding the land\r\n  transaction.Â  \r\nClearly, this testimony established that\r\n  the forged letter had legal efficacy in that it had the potential of\r\n  prejudicing or damaging Gooding in the civil lawsuit as well as subjecting her\r\n  to perjury charges and potential ethical violations.Â  \r\n(2). Intent to Defraud\r\nBrandt claims the trial judge erred in\r\n  denying his motion for a directed verdict given the State failed to present\r\n  evidence that Brandt knew the Edisto Farm letter was forged and that he\r\n  presented it to Richter and Freeman with the intent to defraud Gooding.\r\nBrandt, however, disregards the\r\n  significant fact that the knowledge and intent to defraud elements of the\r\n  offense of forgery may be proven by circumstantial evidence.Â  See Lee-Grigg,\r\n  374 S.C. at 403-04, 649 S.E.2d at 49 (stating &quot;[b]ecause intent is seldom\r\n  susceptible to proof by direct evidence, the circumstances surrounding the\r\n  making or uttering of the forged instrument are relevant for establishing the\r\n  requisite intent&quot;; recognizing that &quot;a person is said to act\r\n  knowingly if he is aware the result is practically certain to follow from his\r\n  conduct, whatever his desire may be as to that result&quot; (citations\r\n  omitted)); Murray, 72 S.C. at 515, 52 S.E. at 191 (affirming conviction\r\n  for forging and uttering a false lease and stating &quot;[t]he intent is only\r\n  matter of circumstance, which naturally follows and springs out of the\r\n  facts&quot;).\r\nA review of the record reveals the State\r\n  presented sufficient evidence to establish Brandt's knowledge that the letter\r\n  was forged and his intent to use the letter to defraud.Â  Through the testimony\r\n  of Dawson and Fortunato, the State conclusively established that the letter was\r\n  a forgery.Â  Given that Brandt possessed the document and presented it to his\r\n  attorney, there is evidence that Brandt had knowledge that the document was\r\n  forged.Â  Cf. State v. Orr, 225 S.C. 369, 374, 82 S.E.2d 523, 526\r\n  (1954) (&quot;It is insisted on the part of appellant that there is no evidence\r\n  tending to prove that he made, or caused to be made, the check here charged to\r\n  be forged. Â This would be true but for the rule that one found in the\r\n  possession of a forged instrument of which he purports to be the beneficiary,\r\n  and applying it to his own use, must, in the absence of explanation\r\n  satisfactory to the jury, be presumed to have forged it or to have been privy\r\n  to its forgery.&quot; (citation omitted)).Â  \r\nFurthermore, the circumstances surrounding\r\n  Brandt's presentation of the letter to his attorney and expert witness are\r\n  clearly susceptible to the inference that Brandt intended to use the document\r\n  to defraud.Â  Although extensive discovery had been conducted following the\r\n  filing of the 1998 legal malpractice lawsuit, Brandt discovered the document\r\n  and produced it to his attorney and expert witness in 2000, which was shortly\r\n  before the key deposition of Freeman.Â  Viewing this evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the State, there is evidence of Brandt's knowledge that the\r\n  document was a forgery and his intent to defraud.Â  See Murray, 72\r\n  S.C. at 514, 52 S.E. at 190-91 (finding that where there was an &quot;abundance\r\n  of testimony to the effect that said writing was forged&quot; . . . &quot;[i]t\r\n  is at least a reasonable inference from these facts, that the defendant knew\r\n  the writing was forged&quot;).\r\n(3). Value of the Letter\r\nBrandt contends the trial judge erred in\r\n  denying his motion for a directed verdict as the State failed to present\r\n  evidence that the value of the forged letter was $5,000 or more.\r\nIn explaining his denial of Brandt's\r\n  motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge stated, &quot;I think there is\r\n  value in the case in excess of $5,000 under the testimony of Mr. Richter and\r\n  Professor Freeman.&quot;Â  We find the judge erred in considering the value of\r\n  the fraudulent document in the context of a directed verdict motion.Â  As will be\r\n  discussed, the determination of the value of a forged document is not an\r\n  element of the offense of forgery.Â  Instead, it should only be a consideration\r\n  for sentencing purposes after a person has been convicted of forgery.\r\nSection 16-13-10, the code section that\r\n  outlines the offense of forgery, consists of two subsections.Â  As previously\r\n  discussed, subsection A outlines the elements of forgery.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-10(A)(2) (2003) (&quot;It is\r\n  unlawful for a person to utter or publish as true any false, forged, or\r\n  counterfeited writing or instrument of writing.&quot;).Â  In conjunction, subsection B outlines the penalties that\r\n  must be imposed on one who is convicted of forgery.Â  Specifically, this\r\n  subsection provides in relevant part:\r\nA person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of\r\n  a:\r\n\r\n(1)&nbsp; felony and, upon\r\n  conviction, must be fined in the discretion of the court or imprisoned not\r\n  more than ten years, or both, if the amount of the forgery is five thousand\r\n    dollars or more.\r\n. . .\r\nIf the forgery does not involve a dollar\r\n  amount, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be\r\n  fined in the discretion of the court or imprisoned not more than three years,\r\n  or both.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-10(B)(1) (2003) (emphasis added).[9]Â  \r\nOn its face, the Edisto Farm letter does\r\n  not involve a dollar amount. Moreover, the evidence presented by the State\r\n  regarding any amount was purely speculative as the testimony indicated the\r\n  letter would have increased the value of Brandt's claim against Gooding\r\n  &quot;substantially&quot; more than $5,000 and increased Brandt's\r\n  &quot;probability of winning&quot; the lawsuit that would have resulted in\r\n  damages in excess of $5,000.Â  We find this evidence is insufficient to\r\n  establish a dollar amount.Â  In the absence of a dollar amount, we hold that\r\n  Brandt could have been found guilty only of a misdemeanor and sentenced to\r\n  imprisonment for a period of three years or less, ordered to pay a fine, or\r\n  both.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the State\r\n  presented sufficient evidence to support the trial judge's decision to submit\r\n  the charge of forgery to the jury.Â  However, because there was insufficient\r\n  evidence to establish a dollar amount of the Edisto Farm letter, we reverse\r\n  Brandt's felony sentence. Accordingly, we remand for the circuit court to\r\n  sentence Brandt for a misdemeanor forgery conviction.Â  See State v.\r\n    Brown, 360 S.C. 581, 597-98, 602 S.E.2d 392, 401 (2004) (holding that when\r\n  a conviction is reversed due to insufficient evidence, an appellate court may\r\n  remand a case for sentencing on a lesser-included offense after the court\r\n  considers the following six factors:Â  (1) the evidence adduced at trial fails\r\n  to support one or more elements of the crime of which appellant was convicted;\r\n  (2) the jury was explicitly instructed it could find the defendant guilty of\r\n  the lesser-included offense and was properly instructed on the elements of that\r\n  offense; (3) the record on appeal contains sufficient evidence supporting each\r\n  element of the lesser-included offense; (4) the State seeks a sentencing remand\r\n  on appeal; (5) the defendant will not be unduly or unfairly prejudiced; and (6)\r\n  the Court is convinced justice will be served by such a result after carefully\r\n  considering the record as well as the interests and concerns of both the\r\n  defendant and the victim of the crime).\r\nC.&nbsp; &quot;Legal Efficacy&quot; Request\r\n  to Charge\r\nBrandt claims the trial judge erred in denying the\r\n  following request to charge:Â  &quot;A document whose sole value is its\r\n  potential use in a civil lawsuit does not have sufficient 'legal efficacy' to\r\n  support a forgery charge.&quot;Â  \r\n&quot;In reviewing jury charges for error,\r\n  we must consider the court's jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence\r\n  and issues presented at trial.&quot;Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312,\r\n  318, 577 S.E.2d 460, 463 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  &quot;A jury charge is correct if,\r\n  when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and\r\n  adequately covers the law.&quot;Â  Id. at 318, 577 S.E.2d at 464. Â A jury\r\n  charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not require\r\n  reversal.Â  State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996).\r\n&quot;[T]he\r\n  trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South\r\n  Carolina.&quot;Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462,\r\n  472 (2004).Â  &quot;The law to be charged must be determined from the evidence\r\n  presented at trial.&quot;Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555\r\n  S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001). Â &quot;The substance of the law is what must be charged\r\n  to the jury, not any particular verbiage.&quot;Â  Adkins, 353 S.C. at\r\n  318-19, 577 S.E.2d at 464.\r\n&quot;A request to charge a correct\r\n  statement of the law on an issue raised by the indictment and the evidence\r\n  presented at trial should not be refused.&quot; Â State v. Austin, 299\r\n  S.C 456, 458, 385 S.E.2d 830, 831 (1989). Â &quot;However, if Â Â the trial judge\r\n  refuses to give a specific charge, there is no error if the charge actually\r\n  given sufficiently covers the substance of the request.&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;'It is error for the trial court to\r\n  refuse to give a requested instruction which states a sound principle of law\r\n  when that principle applies to the case at hand, and the principle is not\r\n  otherwise included in the charge.'&quot; Â State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 195, 624 S.E.2d 443, 445\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005) (quoting Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 390, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000)). Â &quot;If there\r\n  is any evidence to support a charge, the trial court should grant the request.&quot;Â  Williams, 367 S.C. at 195, 624 S.E.2d at 445.\r\n&quot;To warrant reversal, a trial judge's\r\n  refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial\r\n  to the defendant.&quot;Â  State v. Mattison, 388 S.C. 469, 479, 697\r\n  S.E.2d 578, 583 (2010). Â A trial judge's failure to give requested jury\r\n  instructions is not prejudicial error where the instructions given afford the\r\n  proper test for determining the issues.Â  Id. at 479, 697 S.E.2d at\r\n  583-84. Â &quot;An appellate court will not reverse the trial judge's decision\r\n  regarding a jury charge absent an abuse of discretion.&quot; Â Id. at\r\n  479, 697 S.E.2d at 584.\r\nBrandt's argument is merely a continuation\r\n  of his argument regarding the denial of his motion for a directed verdict on\r\n  the ground the letter lacked &quot;legal efficacy.&quot; Â As previously\r\n  discussed, we disagree with Brandt's overly-narrow construction of this term.Â  To\r\n  establish the legal efficacy of a forged document, the State was only required\r\n  to show that the letter had the potential to prejudice or damage the intended\r\n  victim.Â  Furthermore, our appellate courts, as previously cited, have upheld\r\n  forgery convictions where the forged document was used as evidence in a civil\r\n  trial.\r\nViewing the judge's charge as a whole, we\r\n  find it sufficiently covered this element.Â  First, the judge properly\r\n  instructed the jury on the elements of forgery by using the statutory language\r\n  of section 16-13-10.Â  Secondly, the judge explained each of the elements\r\n  individually.Â  Finally, the judge charged the &quot;legal efficacy&quot;\r\n  element as follows:\r\n\r\nTo constitute forgery, it is [essential] that a falsely made or\r\n  altered instrument [possess] some apparent legal [efficacy]; otherwise, it\r\n  would have no tendency to defraud.Â  As long as a forged instrument is the\r\n  apparent foundation of legal liability, the instrument need not be complete\r\n  [in] all its particulars to amount to forgery, and any writing that may defraud\r\n  or prejudice another, or that, if genuine, would have legal effect and operate\r\n  as the foundation of another man's liability may be the subject of forgery.Â  It\r\n  is sufficient if the forged documents, believed to be genuine, might have\r\n  operated to the prejudice of another.\r\n\r\nThe judge's charge accurately reflects\r\n  this state's current law regarding the offense of forgery.Â  In fact, the text\r\n  of the charge tracks the language in Lee-Grigg, the case primarily\r\n  relied upon by Brandt.Â  Lee-Grigg, 374 S.C. at 402, 649 S.E.2d at 48.Â  Thus,\r\n  the judge's denial of Brandt's request to charge does not warrant reversal as\r\n  the charge as a whole afforded the jury the proper test for determining the\r\n  issues presented at trial.\r\nD.&nbsp; New Trial\r\nBrandt contends the trial judge erred in\r\n  refusing to grant his motion for a new trial where the evidence failed to\r\n  establish the Edisto Farm letter had legal efficacy and was valued at $5,000 or\r\n  more.Â  In support of this contention, Brandt reiterates his arguments regarding\r\n  the trial judge's denial of his motion for a directed verdict.\r\nAs previously discussed, the State\r\n  presented sufficient evidence that the forged letter possessed legal efficacy\r\n  as there was testimony establishing the prejudicial and damaging effect of the\r\n  letter to Gooding.Â  Furthermore, the value of the Edisto Farm letter did not\r\n  affect Brandt's conviction.Â  Thus, any lack of evidence as to its value would\r\n  not have warranted the grant of a new trial to Brandt.Â  Instead, as we\r\n  previously ruled, the value of the forged document was only relevant for\r\n  sentencing purposes.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial judge did not abuse his\r\n  discretion in denying Brandt's motion for a new trial.Â  See State v.\r\n    Johnson, 376 S.C. 8, 11, 654 S.E.2d 835, 836 (2007) (recognizing that a\r\n  trial judge has the discretion to grant or deny a motion for a new trial, and\r\n  his decision will not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion).Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nWe find the State presented\r\n  sufficient evidence to support a forgery conviction.Â  Because the forged\r\n  document did not involve a dollar amount and the State did not present evidence\r\n  of a definitive dollar amount, we hold the trial judge erred in sentencing\r\n  Brandt for a felony conviction.Â  Accordingly, we remand to the circuit court\r\n  for sentencing on the misdemeanor.[10]\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-10(A)(2) (2003).Â Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  At this hearing, Judge Goodstein granted Brandt's\r\n  counsel's motion to be relieved and gave Brandt sixty days to retain new\r\n  counsel. \r\n[3]Â  Brandt was accompanied by an attorney who informed\r\n  the court that he had agreed to represent Brandt for the limited purpose of\r\n  obtaining access to the disputed letter for testing by Brandt's expert.Â  He\r\n  further explained that he had a conflict and could no longer represent Brandt.Â \r\n  After addressing the limited issue and making the letter a court exhibit, the\r\n  judge dismissed the attorney from the proceedings.Â  Brandt claimed he could not\r\n  find anyone else to represent him and, thus, proceeded without counsel for the\r\n  remainder of the proceedings.\r\n[4]Â  The body of the letter indicated that Gooding had\r\n  been hired by Brandt, confirmed that she was aware of Brandt's involvement in\r\n  the land deal, and that she was responsible for securing financing from Edisto\r\n  Farm Credit on behalf of Brandt.\r\n[5]Â  Following this Court's decision affirming Brandt's\r\n  conviction for criminal contempt, Brandt filed a petition for writ of habeas\r\n  corpus in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.Â \r\n  Ultimately, the federal district court ruled in favor of Brandt on the grounds\r\n  that Brandt was denied his constitutional rights to notice, counsel, and an\r\n  opportunity to be heard on the charge of criminal contempt.Â  Brandt v.\r\n    Ozmint, 664 F. Supp. 2d 626 (D.S.C. 2009).Â  On appeal, the Fourth Circuit\r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's order.Â  Brandt v. Ozmint,\r\n  Nos. 09-7907 &amp; 09-7909, 2011 WL 567469 (4th Cir. Feb. 18, 2011).Â  Because\r\n  the federal proceedings effectively vacate the prior conviction, Brandt can no\r\n  longer assert that his forgery prosecution was barred by Double Jeopardy.Â \r\n  However, in the event the Fourth Circuit's decision is reversed, we have\r\n  addressed the merits of Brandt's arguments.\r\n[6]Â  In Dixon, the Supreme Court considered two\r\n  cases in which the defendants, Dixon and Foster, had been tried for criminal\r\n  contempt for violating court orders that prohibited them from engaging in\r\n  conduct that was the subject of later criminal prosecutions.Â  Dixon, 509\r\n  U.S. at 691-92.Â  In analyzing these cases, the Court overruled Grady v.\r\n    Corbin, 495 U.S. 508 (1990), a decision that added the &quot;same\r\n  conduct&quot; test to the Blockburger analysis.Â  Id. at 704.Â \r\n  Although the Court reinstated Blockburger as the exclusive means of\r\n  determining whether two charges are the same for Double Jeopardy purposes,\r\n  there was no majority opinion as to the appropriate method of application.Â \r\n  Essentially, two opposing factions emerged from the opinion.Â  Chief Justice\r\n  Rehnquist adhered to a strict application of the Blockburger &quot;same\r\n  elements test.&quot;Â  Id. at 713-14.Â  In contrast, Justice Scalia\r\n  compared the elements of the offenses based on a &quot;lesser-included\r\n  offense&quot; analysis, finding that the substantive criminal offense was\r\n  &quot;a species of lesser-included offense&quot; of the judicial order that had\r\n  been violated and formed the basis of the criminal contempt conviction.Â  Id. at 700-03. \r\n[7]Â  See State v. Cearley, 92 P.3d 1284\r\n  (N.M. Ct. App. 2004) (concluding photocopies of altered non-carbon records of\r\n  checks, tendered by defendant in civil action, were not instruments purporting\r\n  to have legal efficacy); State v. Scott, 185 P.3d 1081 (N.M. Ct. App.\r\n  2008) (reversing forgery conviction based on fraudulent doctor's note used as\r\n  an excuse for missing a scheduled court hearing; finding the fraudulent\r\n  document did not have legal efficacy given it merely had potential evidentiary\r\n  value); Gooch v. State, 31 So. 2d 776 (Ala. 1947) (concluding a\r\n  &quot;Sunday-dated&quot; check, without extrinsic facts showing its legal\r\n  efficacy, could not support a forgery conviction).\r\n We find the cases cited by Brandt are distinguishable from the\r\n  instant case.Â  First, the New Mexico forgery statute specifically includes the\r\n  term &quot;legal efficacy.&quot;Â  N.M. Stat. Ann. Â§ 30-16-10 (Supp. 2010).Â \r\n  Secondly, based on our research, the New Mexico cases and the Alabama case\r\n  reflect a minority view as it does not appear that other jurisdictions have\r\n  taken such a limited approach in analyzing the offense of forgery.Â \r\n  Furthermore, as will be discussed, these cases are inconsistent with our\r\n  state's jurisprudence regarding forgery.\r\n[8]Â  Additional support for this position may be found in\r\n  the decisions of other jurisdictions.Â  See People v. Cunefare,\r\n  102 P.3d 302, 308-09 (Colo. 2004) (holding that statute prohibiting forgery\r\n  encompasses not only forgery of instruments affecting pecuniary interests, but\r\n  also forgery of instruments having other legal effects); People v.\r\n    Muzzarelli, 770 N.E.2d 1232, 1235 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002) (affirming forgery\r\n  conviction and finding that forged letter submitted by defendant to sentencing\r\n  court asking for leniency had legal effect as it was capable of affecting the\r\n  rights or obligations of another; stating &quot;[t]hough property or monetary\r\n  loss may be the most common forgeries, they are not exclusive&quot;); see\r\n    also R.P. Davis, Annotation, Invalid Instrument as Subject of Forgery,\r\n  174 A.L.R. 1300, 1304 (1948 &amp; Supp. 2010) (discussing cases of the general\r\n  broad type as to what instruments are the subject of forgery; stating that a\r\n  generally-accepted definition of forgery is that &quot;the offense consists of\r\n  the false making or material alteration, with intent to defraud, of any writing\r\n  which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy or the\r\n  foundation of a legal liability&quot; (emphasis added)).\r\n[9]Â  Recently, this code section was amended to change\r\n  the penalties for forgery.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-10 (Supp. 2010).Â  Notably,\r\n  if a person is convicted of a forgery in an amount less than $10,000, he is\r\n  subject to five years' imprisonment, payment of a fine, or both.\r\n[10]Â  We need not address Brandt's argument regarding the\r\n  trial judge's failure to conduct a &quot;full and fair&quot; restitution\r\n  hearing or his claim that the amount of restitution was excessive given the\r\n  parties informed this Court that they have reached a settlement as to\r\n  restitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27015","title":"State v.

Johnson, all of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Abel Jacobs (Appellant) appeals the circuit court's\r\n  decision that a sentence for burglary in the first degree cannot be suspended\r\n  under the language of South Carolina Code section 24-21-410.Â  We affirm.\r\nProcedural Background\r\n In\r\n  January 2010, Appellant pled guilty to a variety of criminal charges, including\r\n  a charge for first degree burglary.Â  At the plea hearing, defense counsel asked\r\n  the circuit judge to suspend the minimum fifteen year sentence for first degree\r\n  burglary in lieu of placing Appellant under probation.Â  Defense counsel opined\r\n  that state courts have routinely suspended sentences for first degree burglary,\r\n  and the State has never appealed those sentences.Â  The circuit judge deferred\r\n  sentencing Appellant for the first degree burglary conviction at the plea\r\n  hearing, and requested the parties submit memoranda in support of their\r\n  positions regarding the suspension issue.Â  The circuit judge subsequently\r\n  issued an order finding that a sentence for the conviction of first degree\r\n  burglary is not suspendable under section 24-21-410 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code.Â  At the sentencing hearing, the circuit judge sentenced Appellant to\r\n  fifteen years imprisonment for first degree burglary, along with Â concurrent\r\n  sentences for remaining charges, crediting Appellant for time served prior to\r\n  his guilty plea.Â  \r\nIssue\r\nWhether a sentence for the conviction of first degree\r\n  burglary can be suspended under section 24-21-410 of the South Carolina Code.\r\nStandard of Review\r\n&quot;In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to\r\n  review errors of law only.&quot;Â  State v. Wilson, 386 S.C. 503, 509,\r\n  690 S.E.2d 62, 65 (2010).Â  &quot;A sentence will not be overturned absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion when the ruling is based on an error of law . . . .&quot;Â  In\r\n    re M.B.H, 387 S.C. 323, 326, 692 S.E.2d 541, 541 (2010).Â  \r\nAnalysis\r\n Appellant\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in concluding that a sentence for a conviction\r\n  for first degree burglary is not suspendable under section 24-21-410 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code.Â  We disagree.\r\n &quot;The\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate\r\n  legislative intent.&quot;Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d\r\n  578, 581 (2000).Â  As such, a court must abide by the plain meaning of the words\r\n  of a statute.Â  Id.Â  When interpreting the plain meaning of a statute,\r\n  courts should not resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand\r\n  the statute's operation.Â  Grazia v. S.C. State Plastering, LLC, 390 S.C.\r\n  562, 569, 703 S.E.2d 197, 200 (2010).Â  &quot;Where the statute's language is\r\n  plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of\r\n  statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose\r\n  another meaning.&quot;Â  Hodges, 341 S.C. at 85, 533 S.E.2d at 581.Â \r\n  &quot;'What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best\r\n  evidence of the legislative intent or will.Â  Therefore, the courts are bound to\r\n  give effect to the expressed intent of the legislature.'&quot; Id. (quoting Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction Â§46.03 at 94 (5th\r\n  ed. 1992)).Â  Although it is a well-settled principle of statutory construction\r\n  that penal statutes should be strictly construed against the state and in favor\r\n  of the defendant, State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660,\r\n  662 (1991), courts must nevertheless interpret a penal statute that is clear\r\n  and unambiguous according to its literal meaning.Â  State v. Mills, 360\r\n  S.C. 621, 624, 602 S.E.2d 750, 752 (2004).\r\n A\r\n  circuit court's authority to suspend a sentence and impose probation derives\r\n  solely from section 24-21-410, which states:\r\n\r\nAfter conviction or plea for any offense, except a\r\n  crime punishable by death or life imprisonment, the judge of a court of\r\n  record with criminal jurisdiction at the time of the sentence may suspend the\r\n  imposition or the execution of a sentence and place the defendant on probation\r\n  or may impose a fine and also place the defendant on probation.Â  Probation is a\r\n  form of clemency.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 (Supp. 2010) (emphasis added).Â  The South Carolina Code\r\n  defines the crime of first degree burglary as follows: &quot;Burglary in the\r\n  first degree is a felony punishable by life imprisonment. . . . The\r\n  court, in its discretion, may sentence the defendant to a term of not less than\r\n  fifteen years.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(B) (2003) (emphasis added).Â \r\n  Therefore, the sentence for this offense ranges from a maximum of life\r\n  imprisonment to a minimum of fifteen years imprisonment.Â  Id.\r\n We\r\n  find the sentence for a conviction of first degree burglary falls squarely within\r\n  the exception provided in section 24-21-410 because first degree burglary is a\r\n  felony &quot;punishable by life imprisonment.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-11-311(B) (2003).Â  In drafting section 24-21-410, the legislature made clear\r\n  its intention to give judges the discretion to suspend criminal sentences in\r\n  favor of probation, unless the seriousness of a crime warrants the severe\r\n  penalties of death or life imprisonment.Â  In those cases, the legislature chose\r\n  to restrict a court's authority to suspend sentences below the\r\n  statutorily-mandated sentencing range.Â  \r\n Appellant\r\n  relies on this Court's holding in State v. Thomas for the proposition\r\n  that a sentence for the conviction of first degree burglary is suspendable\r\n  because the burglary statute does not expressly prohibit suspension.Â  372 S.C.\r\n  466, 642 S.E.2d 724 (2007).Â  In Thomas, the statute at issue required\r\n  that a person convicted of distributing cocaine within proximity of a school be\r\n  &quot;'fined not less than ten thousand dollars and imprisoned not less than\r\n  ten nor more than fifteen years.'&quot;Â  Id. at 468, 642 S.E.2d at 725 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445(B)(2) (2002)).Â  This Court found that numerous\r\n  penal statutes include explicit language that prohibits suspension of the\r\n  prescribed prison sentence, and that the omission of such a prohibition in the\r\n  statute at issue indicated the legislature's intent to not limit a court's\r\n  authority to suspend sentences for that crime.Â  Id. at 469, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  at 725.Â  The holding in Thomas has no bearing on this case.Â  The\r\n  sentence imposed for the criminal conviction in Thomas was not\r\n  punishable by death or life imprisonment, and therefore, did not fall within\r\n  the exception of section 24-21-410.Â  Applying the plain and ordinary meaning of\r\n  section 24-21-410 understandably led this Court to find that a crime not\r\n  punishable by death or life imprisonment may be suspended, unless the statute\r\n  expressly prohibits suspension.Â  \r\n Appellant\r\n  further contends that the language excepting crimes &quot;punishable by death\r\n  or life imprisonment&quot; implies that a crime carrying such a sentence may,\r\n  nevertheless, be suspended if the statute includes other sentencing options.Â \r\n  Therefore, Appellant argues, because section 16-11-311(B) imposes a sentence\r\n  ranging from fifteen years to life imprisonment, it does not fall within the\r\n  exception contained in section 24-21-410.Â  We believe this is a forced\r\n  construction of the statute.Â  If the legislature intended to restrict a court's\r\n  authority to suspend sentences for crimes that are only punishable by\r\n  death or life imprisonment, it would have used the language &quot;punished by death or life imprisonment&quot; or &quot;only punishable by death or\r\n  life imprisonment.&quot;Â  As the language of section 24-21-410 is unambiguous,\r\n  we are confined to interpret its plain meaning.Â  The plain language of the\r\n  statute gives no indication the legislature intended to limit the exception in\r\n  the manner urged by Appellant.Â  If the legislature intends to give the courts\r\n  the discretionary authority to suspend sentences for crimes that include a\r\n  range of punishment in addition to death or life imprisonment, it is up to the\r\n  legislature to memorialize that intention in the words of a statute.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that section 24-21-410 of the South Carolina\r\n  code does not give courts the authority to suspend sentences for crimes\r\n  punishable by death or life imprisonment, and this includes crimes that include\r\n  lesser sentences than death or life imprisonment.Â  Therefore, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's order finding that a sentence for a conviction of first degree\r\n  burglary may not be suspended according to section 24-21-410 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.
