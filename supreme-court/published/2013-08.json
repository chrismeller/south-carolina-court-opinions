In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of an admonition or public reprimand. In addition, respondent\r\nagrees to pay the costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter\r\nby ODC and the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Commission) within thirty (30)\r\ndays of imposition of discipline and to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice\r\nProgram Ethics School within nine (9) months of the imposition of discipline.\r\nWe accept the Agreement and issue a public reprimand. Within thirty (30) days of\r\nthe date of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs incurred in the investigation\r\nand prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission. Within nine (9)\r\nmonths of the date of this opinion, respondent shall complete the Legal Ethics and\r\nPractice Program Ethics School. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as\r\nfollows.\r\n\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\n                                      Matter I\r\n\r\nComplainant A is a member of a homeowners association in the Stonington\r\nsubdivision in Blythewood, South Carolina. The homeowners association hired\r\nrespondent in September 2009 to file a lawsuit against the developer. According to\r\nthe homeowners association, the developer was not properly managing the\r\ndevelopment property and there was fear that a new developer would build\r\nsubstandard homes in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nRespondent obtained a temporary restraining order and a temporary injunction\r\npreventing the substandard homes. Respondent reached an agreement with the\r\nnew developer and dismissed it from the lawsuit. The original lawsuit progressed\r\nbut several of the homeowners dropped out, leaving only five homeowners by June\r\n29, 2010. At that time, the homeowners were aware that the developer did not\r\nhave any money left and there was a large judgment against the developer.\r\nRespondent stated there was not much that could be done with the lawsuit once the\r\ndeveloper ran out of money.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the representation, respondent met with his clients several\r\ntimes. Over time, his contact declined. There was little or no communication from\r\nrespondent between July 2010 and March 2011.\r\n\r\nThe last billing supplied by respondent shows a credit to the homeowners in the\r\namount of $714.87. Complainant A asked respondent about an additional $700,\r\nbut did not receive a response.\r\n\r\nRespondent was administratively suspended from the practice of law for failure to\r\ncomply with continuing legal education requirements on April 1, 2010; he was\r\nreinstated on April 28, 2010. Respondent's billing statement for the Stonington\r\nsubdivision includes billing fees for the following dates: April 14, 2010, April 15,\r\n2010, April 16, 2010, April 20, 2010, and April 22, 2010. On each of these dates,\r\nrespondent was suspended from the practice of law.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter II\r\n\r\nIn June 2009 respondent was hired to represent homeowners of the Greens\r\nsubdivision in a dispute with the developer. In June 2010, respondent met with the\r\nhomeowners to give an update and to request additional money. The developer\r\n\nwas unwilling or unable to meet the demands of the homeowners and respondent\r\ndrafted a summons and complaint. A meeting was held to discuss the pros and\r\ncons of filing the lawsuit. The possibility of a new developer taking over the\r\nGreens development arose but did not come to fruition. Respondent admits that he\r\nwaited quite a while to determine if this possibility would work out but it did not.\r\nThe representative from the homeowners association asked for an update from\r\nrespondent in October 2010 but did not receive a response until after the\r\nrepresentative requested assistance from the South Carolina Bar in December\r\n2010. Respondent then contacted the representative on one occasion, but\r\nsubsequently failed to return several calls from one of his other clients.\r\n\r\nRespondent was administratively suspended from the practice of law for failure to\r\ncomply with continuing legal education requirements on April 2, 2009; he was\r\nreinstated on April 22, 2009. Although it appears respondent was not retained until\r\nJune 2009, respondent's billing statement for the Green's Homeowner's Group\r\nshows billing for April 15, 2009, and April 16 through June 2009, during times he\r\nwas suspended from the practice of law.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter III\r\n\r\nIn 2009, respondent was hired by homeowners of the Courtyards of Arsenal Hill\r\nbecause the developer failed to complete the subdivision. The homeowners\r\nrepeatedly asked respondent for an accounting of his work, for updates, and for\r\ndocumentation, but received little or no response to calls or emails. After the\r\ndevelopment company filed for bankruptcy, respondent attempted to get the\r\ncommon area deeded to the association and to get the road deeded to the county so\r\nthat it could be paved. The association members were unhappy because they\r\nbelieved respondent was neither proceeding in their best interest nor keeping them\r\ninformed of his efforts. In particular, the homeowners did not want the common\r\narea deeded to the association and felt respondent pursued this option without their\r\napproval. Although requested, respondent did not provide the association with a\r\ndetailed accounting of how its money was spent.\r\n\r\n                                       Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act\r\nwith reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client ); Rule 1.4 (lawyer\r\nshall reasonably consult with client about the means by which client's objectives\r\nare to be accomplished; lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about the\r\n\nstatus of the matter; and lawyer shall promptly comply with reasonable requests for\r\ninformation); and Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in\r\nviolation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it\r\nshall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute\r\nthe administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\ndisrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\n\r\n                                    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand.1 Accordingly, we\r\naccept the Agreement and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nWithin thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay the costs\r\nincurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the\r\nCommission. Within nine (9) months of the date of this opinion, respondent shall\r\ncomplete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School and shall provide\r\ncertification of completion to the Commission no later than ten (10) days after the\r\nconclusion of the program.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Respondent has received two previous public reprimands, one of which involved\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nthe neglect of legal matters.

(Progressive), an\r\nautomobile insurer, brought this contribution action against Floating Caps, Inc.,\r\nd/b/a Silver Dollar Cafe (Silver Dollar), a Charleston bar, pursuant to South\r\nCarolina's Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (UCATA) after\r\nProgressive settled a tort action involving a Silver Dollar patron. The circuit court\r\nfound the contribution claim was not preserved and granted summary judgment to\r\n\nthe Silver Dollar. This Court certified the case for review in accordance with Rule\r\n204(b), SCACR. We affirm.            I. FACTS\r\n       Robert M. Witherspoon, IV (Witherspoon) brought separate tort actions in\r\nfederal court against Ryan McGuire (a minor under the age of 21) and McGuire's\r\nparents for injuries he sustained in the early morning hours of November 17, 2003,\r\nwhen McGuire drove into Witherspoon as he stood on King Street outside the\r\nSilver Dollar. Witherspoon asserted a negligence claim against McGuire and a\r\nnegligent entrustment action against McGuire's parents, who were the owners of\r\nthe vehicle McGuire was driving. The actions were consolidated. Witherspoon\r\ndid not bring an action against the Silver Dollar.1\r\n\r\n       The McGuires had automobile insurance coverage with Progressive, which\r\nagreed to defend and indemnify them pursuant to the terms of the insurance policy.\r\nOn April 7, 2007, Witherspoon settled his tort claims against the McGuires for a\r\ntotal of $200,000. Witherspoon intended thereafter to pursue underinsured\r\nmotorist (UIM) coverage.\r\n\r\n        In settling the tort action, the parties entered into a \"Covenant Not to\r\nExecute\" (First Covenant) dated April 20, 2007, approximately five months after\r\nthe statute of limitations had run on Witherspoon's claims in the tort action.\r\nWitherspoon was designated the \"Covenantor,\" while the McGuires, Progressive,\r\nand The Cincinnati Insurance Companies (which provided an umbrella policy for\r\nthe McGuires) were the declared \"Covenantees.\" The First Covenant provided\r\nthat, in consideration of a total sum of $200,000, of which $180,000 was paid by\r\nProgressive and $20,000 was paid by The Cincinnati Insurance Companies, the\r\nparties agreed that, in the event Witherspoon was unable to resolve his claim for\r\nany UIM coverage or liability coverage that might be applicable, Witherspoon\r\n\"shall have the right to bring suit against the Covenantees, Kevin McGuire, Betty\r\nMcGuire and Ryan McGuire, and prosecute same to final judgment.\" The parties\r\nfurther agreed that, \"[n]otwithstanding any judgment that may be rendered in said\r\nsuit, it is the express intent of the parties that the Covenantees, their respective\r\nheirs and assigns, shall never at any time, be liable to the Covenantor . . . beyond\r\nthe consideration expressed herein . . . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1 In an affidavit, Witherspoon's attorney, Johnny F. Driggers, stated he was aware\r\nof potential tort claims against the Silver Dollar, but he made a \"tactical decision\"\r\nnot to pursue them so as \"not to diffuse any liability against Ryan McGuire[.]\"\r\n\n      The First Covenant further provided that it was not a release of any other\r\npersons or entities:\r\n\r\n            3. Covenantor and Covenantees expressly reserve all rights of\r\n      action, claims, demands or other legal remedies against all firms\r\n      and persons except as modified by the terms of this Covenant. This\r\n      Covenant is not a release, nor shall it be construed as a release of\r\n      any party, person, firm or corporation.\r\n\r\n             4. Covenantor will fully and forever prevent and bar the \n\r\n      collection of any additional payments of any kind, nature or \n\r\n      description against the Covenantees . . . with the exception of \n\r\n      underinsured motorist coverage. \n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\n\r\n      Thereafter, on May 8, 2007, Witherspoon's tort action was dismissed by the\r\nfederal district court in Charleston. By that time, Witherspoon's UIM claim\r\nreportedly had been resolved.\r\n\r\n        Upon realizing the First Covenant did not mention the Silver Dollar or\r\nextinguish its potential liability, Witherspoon, the McGuires, and Progressive\r\nentered into another \"Covenant Not to Execute\" (Second Covenant) on July 31,\r\n2007. The Second Covenant included an acknowledgement by Witherspoon that\r\nhe had a cause of action against the Silver Dollar and that the Covenantees were\r\n\"desirous of pursuing a claim for contribution against [t]he Silver Dollar\" pursuant\r\nto UCATA. Missing from the Second Covenant, however, was an explicit\r\nstatement that the Second Covenant served either to release or to discharge any\r\nliability of the Silver Dollar in the underlying tort matter. To the contrary, it\r\nreiterated, \"This Covenant is not a release, nor shall it be construed as a release of\r\nany party, person, firm or corporation.\" (Emphasis added.)\r\n\r\n       In September 2007, Progressive filed this contribution action against the\r\nSilver Dollar. Progressive alleged the Silver Dollar was jointly liable because it\r\nserved the underage McGuire alcohol on November 17, 2003, both during regular\r\nbusiness hours and after the bar had closed, and that McGuire had become\r\nintoxicated prior to the accident. Progressive stated it had settled the case on\r\nbehalf of all potentially liable parties, including the Silver Dollar, and that\r\nWitherspoon had released the McGuires and the Silver Dollar, but the Silver Dollar\r\ndid not pay its pro-rata share of the settlement.\r\n\n        The Silver Dollar answered and moved for summary judgment on the\r\nground the First Covenant failed to expressly discharge the liability of the Silver\r\nDollar as required by UCATA in order to seek contribution. Progressive opposed\r\nsummary judgment and attached an affidavit of Witherspoon's attorney stating the\r\nparties intended the settlement to extinguish any potential claim by Witherspoon\r\nagainst the Silver Dollar and asserting the Second Covenant \"contains an express\r\nrecital protecting Progressive's claim against [the] Silver Dollar,\" which was\r\n\"evidence of the parties' intent.\" In a supporting memo, Progressive maintained\r\nthe failure to include language in the First Covenant discharging the Silver Dollar's\r\nliability \"was the result of a mere scrivener's error,\" and it asked that the court\r\n\"either allow the extrinsic evidence of intent or reform the written instrument to\r\ncomport with the intent of the parties.\"\r\n\r\n       The circuit court granted the Silver Dollar's motion for summary judgment,\r\nfinding Progressive had failed to properly preserve its right to contribution from\r\nthe Silver Dollar. The circuit court noted the First Covenant expressly stated that it\r\ndid not extinguish the liability of any other persons or entities, thus Progressive\r\nhad settled on behalf of only its insureds and did not pay any common liability that\r\nmight exist with the Silver Dollar in order to be entitled to pursue a contribution\r\nclaim against the Silver Dollar. In addition, the circuit court rejected Progressive's\r\narguments that the Second Covenant it executed to correct this deficiency after the\r\ndismissal of the tort action should relate back so as to preserve its contribution\r\nclaim, and the court denied the request for reformation of the First Covenant.\r\n\r\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n        Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides a motion\r\nfor summary judgment shall be granted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\r\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" In determining whether any triable\r\nissues of fact exist, the trial court must view the evidence and all reasonable\r\ninferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party\r\nopposing summary judgment. Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534\r\nS.E.2d 688 (2000). \"An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment\r\nunder the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.\"\r\nId. at 379, 534 S.E.2d at 692.\r\n\n                               III. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n       On appeal, Progressive contends (1) the circuit court erred in ruling it could\r\nnot consider extrinsic evidence of the parties' alleged intent to extinguish the Silver\r\nDollar's liability in the settlement and obtain contribution; (2) there is, in fact,\r\nextrinsic evidence in the record of the parties' true intent, so reformation of the\r\ncovenant is warranted based on mutual mistake; and (3) the covenants themselves\r\nprovide evidence of the parties' intent to extinguish the liability of the Silver\r\nDollar.In contrast, the Silver Dollar asserts the circuit court properly granted its\r\nmotion for summary judgment. It maintains the language of the First Covenant\r\nwas clear and unambiguous, so a court may not look beyond the four corners of the\r\ndocument in assessing the parties' intent. Because the agreement did not release\r\nthe Silver Dollar or any other parties from liability, the Silver Dollar argues\r\nProgressive is not entitled to contribution as it did not pay any sums on behalf of\r\nothers. Further, Progressive's preparation of the Second Covenant in an attempt to\r\ncorrect the deficiencies in the first came after the tort action had already been\r\ndismissed, so Progressive failed to preserve its contribution rights under UCATA\r\nas a matter of law.\r\n\r\n       UCATA was enacted by the General Assembly in 1988.2 See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. §§ 15-38-10 to -70 (2005 & Supp. 2012). Section 15-38-50(1) of UCATA\r\nprovides that a release or a covenant (not to execute or not to sue) involving one\r\ntortfeasor \"does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the\r\ninjury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 15-\r\n38-50(1) (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n2 UCATA codified the state's common law, which had abandoned the strict rule\r\nthat the release of one tortfeasor automatically released all tortfeasors. See Mickle\r\nv. Blackmon, 252 S.C. 202, 224, 166 S.E.2d 173, 182 (1969) (discussing the harsh\r\neffects of \"the ancient common-law rule that, regardless of the intention of the\r\nparties, the release of one joint tort-feasor releases all\"); see also Bartholomew v.\r\nMcCartha, 255 S.C. 489, 492, 179 S.E.2d 912, 914 (1971) (judicially adopting the\r\ntwo-part rule that the release one of tortfeasor does not release all unless it was the\r\nparties' intent and the plaintiff has, in fact, received full compensation amounting\r\nto a satisfaction); Bowers v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 360 S.C. 149, 155, 600 S.E.2d\r\n543, 546 (Ct. App. 2004) (observing \"UCATA mirrors the rule in Bartholomew\").\r\n\n       In denying Progressive's request for contribution, the circuit court noted at\r\nthe outset that a tortfeasor who enters into a settlement with a claimant is not\r\nentitled to recover contribution from another tortfeasor whose liability for the\r\ninjury is not extinguished by the settlement. See id. § 15-38-20(D).\r\n\r\n      Moreover, section 15-38-40(D) provides that, where there has been no\r\njudgment entered against the tortfeasor seeking contribution, his right of\r\ncontribution is barred unless he has either:\r\n\r\n      (1) discharged by payment the common liability within the statute of\r\n      limitations period applicable to [the] claimant's right of action\r\n      against him and has commenced his action for contribution within one\r\n      year after payment, or (2) agreed while [an] action is pending\r\n      against him to discharge the common liability and has within one\r\n      year after the agreement paid the liability and commenced his action\r\n      for contribution.\r\n\r\nId. § 15-38-40(D) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       The circuit court reasoned that, since Progressive entered into the First\r\nCovenant on April 20, 2007, approximately five months after the statute of\r\nlimitations had run on the underlying tort claim by Witherspoon, section 15-38-\r\n40(D)(1) did not apply to allow this contribution claim as no payment was made\r\ndischarging the common liability within the applicable statute of limitations.\r\nTherefore, Progressive could maintain a contribution action against the Silver\r\nDollar only if it has met the requirements of section 15-38-40(D)(2) and section\r\n15-38-50(1).\r\n\r\n       We agree with the circuit court's determination that (D)(1) is not applicable\r\nhere because it is undisputed that no payment was made prior to the expiration of\r\nthe statute of limitations on the tort claim.\r\n\r\n       In contrast, (D)(2) provides an exception allowing contribution if the\r\ntortfeasor seeking contribution has agreed, while the action is pending against him,\r\nto discharge the common liability and has within one year after the agreement paid\r\nthe liability and commenced his contribution action. The circuit court found the\r\nFirst Covenant did not mention the Silver Dollar or expressly state an intention of\r\n\nthe parties thereto to extinguish or discharge the liability of the Silver Dollar.3\r\nTherefore, as a matter of law, the First Covenant did not extinguish the alleged\r\nliability of the Silver Dollar in the tort claim brought by Witherspoon, and no claim\r\nfor contribution was preserved by the First Covenant under (D)(2).\r\n\r\n      The circuit court next turned its consideration to the effect of the Second\r\nCovenant. The court observed that the underlying tort action was dismissed by\r\nconsent order on May 8, 2007 and, thereafter, on July 31, 2007, Progressive and\r\nWitherspoon executed the Second Covenant. The court stated that, at the hearing,\r\nProgressive had advised the court that the Second Covenant was executed to\r\ncorrect a mutual mistake in the First Covenant and had argued the Second\r\nCovenant should relate back to the date of the signing of the First Covenant.\r\n\r\n       The circuit court stated, however, that it was \"not persuaded by this\r\nargument\" and, further, that \"the requirements of [section] 15-38-40(D)(2)\" were\r\nnot met by the Second Covenant. The court noted the underlying tort case was\r\ndismissed on May 8, 2007, so Progressive's execution of the Second Covenant on\r\nJuly 31, 2007 was not made while the action was still pending as required by\r\n(D)(2) and, thus, could not preserve any right to contribution from the Silver\r\nDollar. The court found \"as a matter of law that any right to contribution\r\n[Progressive] may have had against [the Silver Dollar] was forever barred once\r\n[the underlying tort action] was dismissed on May 8, 2007.\" Having determined\r\nthere were no questions of fact, the court granted the Silver Dollar's motion for\r\nsummary judgment.\r\n\r\n       Upon receiving Progressive's motion to alter or amend the judgment, the\r\ncircuit court issued an order denying the motion, but stating the motion was,\r\nnevertheless, appropriate as its prior order \"did not specifically address\r\nProgressive's argument that [because] the second covenant corrected a mutual\r\nmistake in the first, it 'relates back' to the first covenant such that the covenant was\r\nexecuted in a timely fashion according to the requirements of the statute.\"\r\n\r\n        The circuit court recited the law on the reformation of contracts on the basis\r\nof mutual mistake, and the court agreed \"that the evidence demonstrates at least a\r\nquestion of fact regarding whether both parties to the agreement mistakenly failed\r\nto include a discharge of Silver Dollar's liability.\" However, the court disagreed\r\nwith Progressive's assertion that the Second Covenant should be treated as a\r\n\r\n3 The circuit court indicated it is undisputed that Progressive instituted its\r\ncontribution claim and made payment within one year of the agreement.\r\n\nreformed version of the original and should relate back to the date of the First\r\nCovenant. The court found the Second Covenant did not satisfy the statutory\r\nrequirements for preserving a contribution claim because, \"[o]nce the underlying\r\n[tort] case was dismissed on May 8, 2007, Progressive's subsequent execution of\r\nthe July 31, 2007 covenant could not preserve any right to contribution against the\r\n[Silver Dollar.]\" Progressive argues the circuit court erred in failing to consider\r\nextrinsic evidence of its intent and in failing to reform the parties' agreement.\r\n\r\n       Covenants not to execute are treated as contracts and, as such, they are\r\ngoverned by general contract law. Cf. Bowers v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 360 S.C.\r\n149, 600 S.E.2d 543 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating a release is a contract, to which the\r\ngeneral principles of contract law apply). \"The law in this state regarding the\r\nconstruction and interpretation of contracts is well settled.\" Erie Ins.

Rabon, 266 S.C. 68, 73, 221 S.E.2d\r\n767, 769 (1976).\r\n\r\n       On the other hand, a contract is ambiguous when its terms are capable of\r\nhaving more than one meaning when viewed by a reasonably intelligent person\r\nwho has examined the entire agreement. Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328\r\nS.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997). When a written contract is\r\nambiguous, parol and extrinsic evidence may be admitted regarding the parties'\r\nintent. See id. at 592, 493 S.E.2d at 878-89 (\"Once the court decides that the\r\nlanguage is ambiguous, evidence may be admitted to show the intent of the\r\n\nparties.\"); see also C.A.N. Enters., Inc., 296 S.C. at 378 n.3, 373 S.E.2d at 587 n.3\r\n(noting extrinsic evidence may be considered if a contract is found to be\r\nambiguous (citing Williams v. Teran, Inc., 266 S.C. 55, 221 S.E.2d 526 (1976)).\r\n\r\n       We agree with the Silver Dollar that the language of the First Covenant was\r\nclear and unambiguous, and Progressive does not dispute that it, standing alone,\r\ndid not preserve its contribution claim. Further, we find the Second Covenant did\r\nnot cure any deficiency, as it too failed to expressly provide that the liability of the\r\nSilver Dollar (or any other person or entity) was being extinguished. Rather,\r\nalthough the Second Covenant recited the fact that the parties were aware of a\r\npotential claim against the Silver Dollar and that Progressive desired to pursue a\r\nclaim for contribution, it again contained the recitation that the document was not a\r\nrelease of any other person or entity. In addition, the Second Covenant was\r\nexecuted after the underlying tort action had already been dismissed, so for the\r\nreasons fully discussed by the circuit court, it did not fall within the parameters of\r\nthe contribution statutes, particularly section 15-38-40(D)(2).\r\n\r\n       Thus, only if reformation is allowed can Progressive prevail on its\r\ncontribution claim. Cf. C.A.N. Enters., Inc., 296 S.C. at 378, 373 S.E.2d at 587\r\n(stating \"[w]e are without authority to alter a contract [using rules of]\r\nconstruction\"). Progressive contends the Second Covenant was prepared to correct\r\nthe deficiency in the First Covenant and as such it should relate back to the date of\r\nexecution of the First Covenant, which occurred when the underlying tort action\r\nwas still pending. It further contends the circuit court erred in failing to consider\r\nextrinsic evidence of the parties' intent.\r\n\r\n       Although both parties contest on appeal whether or not the circuit court\r\ncould look beyond the four corners of the parties' agreement, the circuit court did\r\nagree with Progressive that there was evidence of mutual mistake, so the court\r\narguably did consider extrinsic evidence to some extent. However, the court\r\nseemed to confine its examination to the contents of the Second Covenant. The\r\ncircuit court found the Second Covenant was inadequate under the UCATA\r\nprovisions because it was executed after the underlying tort action had already\r\nbeen dismissed, and concluded it did not relate back to preserve any contribution\r\nrights Progressive might have had.\r\n\r\n      Assuming there was evidence of mutual mistake regarding the First\r\nCovenant, however, any reformation would be effective as of the date of its\r\nexecution, which was while the underlying tort action was still pending.\r\nMoreover, any deficiencies in the Second Covenant are not necessarily\r\n\ndeterminative because the parties could have sought reformation even in the\r\nabsence of executing a new document, but the court did not appear to rely upon\r\nother extrinsic evidence offered by Progressive regarding the parties' intent, such\r\nas the affidavit of Witherspoon's counsel. Thus, the exact nature of the court's\r\nruling regarding the admissibility of extrinsic evidence is unclear. For the reasons\r\nthat follow, however, we agree with the circuit court's ultimate conclusion to grant\r\nsummary judgment to the Silver Dollar.\r\n\r\n       As to the use of extrinsic evidence, the Silver Dollar primarily relies upon\r\nBowers v. South Carolina Department of Transportation, 360 S.C. 149, 600 S.E.2d\r\n543 (Ct. App. 2004) to support its argument that extrinsic evidence was not\r\nadmissible to vary the terms of the First Covenant. In Bowers, the Court of\r\nAppeals considered a dispute over the meaning of two releases that were executed\r\nfollowing a traffic accident in light of the trial court's ruling that their release of the\r\ntortfeasor \"and all other persons, firms, or corporations liable . . . from any and all\r\nclaims [or] damages\" as a \"full and final . . . settlement . . . precluding forever any\r\nfurther . . . claims\" barred a later suit for damages against SCDOT. Id. at 152, 600\r\nS.E.2d at 544. The Court of Appeals stated a release is a contract, and in\r\nconstruing its terms, a court must first look to the language of the contract to\r\ndetermine the intentions of the parties. Id. at 153, 600 S.E.2d at 545. The court\r\nheld that, \"[s]ince the [r]elease unambiguously sets forth the contracting parties'\r\nintent, we are bound by that clearly expressed intent without resort to extrinsic\r\nevidence.\" Id. at 153, 600 S.E.2d at 545. The court stated, \"Extrinsic evidence\r\ngiving the contract a different meaning from that indicated by its plain terms is\r\ninadmissible.\" Id. at 153-54, 600 S.E.2d at 545. The court concluded that \"the\r\ncircuit court applied the proper summary judgment standard and correctly\r\ndetermined Appellants' unmistakable intent from the terms of the [r]elease without\r\nresort to affidavits and deposition excerpts.\" Id. at 154, 600 S.E.2d at 545.\r\n\r\n       We find Bowers and the similar line of cases proscribing reliance on\r\nextrinsic evidence where a contract is clear and unambiguous are distinguishable\r\nfrom the instant appeal because they were contract construction cases where the\r\nconcept of reformation was not at issue. Here, Progressive admits that the First\r\nCovenant did not contain an extinguishment of the Silver Dollar's liability, so there\r\nis no dispute as to its construction or interpretation. Rather, Progressive argues the\r\nagreement should be reformed because the parties made a mutual mistake in failing\r\nto include language discharging the potential liability of the Silver Dollar so\r\nProgressive could seek contribution. Progressive argues extrinsic evidence is\r\nadmissible to show this intent. Specifically, it contends the affidavit of\r\nWitherspoon's attorney attests to this intent and further, that the existence of the\r\n\nSecond Covenant itself is evidence that the parties recognized and wanted to\r\ncorrect a mutual mistake made in the First Covenant.\r\n\r\n      Although the clear and unambiguous language of the contract is controlling\r\nin contract construction cases, our jurisprudence has recognized that different\r\nconsiderations apply where a party seeks reformation of a contract. In such\r\ncircumstances, the rules of construction, such as the ban on extrinsic evidence, do\r\nnot apply.\r\n\r\n       \"A contract may be clear and unambiguous as far as it goes and yet may not\r\nexpress the agreement of the parties, by reason of mutual mistake.\" S. Realty &\r\nConstr. Co. v. Bryan, 290 S.C. 302, 309, 350 S.E.2d 194, 198 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n(quoting 66 Am. Jur. 2d Reformation of Instruments § 6 (1973)). \"[A]mbiguity or\r\nuncertainty has nothing to do with the reformation of a written instrument, but\r\nrather reformation is adjudged because the instrument, by reason of mistake or\r\nfraud, does not embody the true agreement of the parties.\" Id. The court\r\nexplained, \"Both the parol evidence rule and the doctrine of merger are rules\r\ngoverning the construction of written documents.\" Id. at 308, 350 S.E.2d at 197\r\n(emphasis added). However, where the parties conceded that the document in\r\nquestion did not contain certain desired language, they did not seek its\r\nconstruction, but rather, reformation to accord with their true intent. Id.\r\n\r\n        The essential question becomes the parties' intent, and \"[p]arol evidence is\r\nadmissible to show mistake.\" Id. at 309, 350 S.E.2d at 198. The court recognized\r\nthat \"[i]t would be virtually impossible to prove mutual mistake as a ground for\r\nreformation without parol evidence.\" Id.; see 27 Richard A. Lord, Williston on\r\nContracts § 70:52 (4th ed. 2003) (stating the parol evidence rule \"is inapplicable in\r\na suit for reformation on the basis of mutual mistake\" and noting one jurisdiction\r\nhad remarked that \"[i]t is practically a universal rule that in suits to reform written\r\ninstruments . . . parol evidence is admissible to establish the fact of fraud or of a\r\nmistake\" (citation omitted)). Consequently, we confirm here the general principle\r\nthat extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove mutual mistake in cases seeking\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\n       As an initial matter, however, we question whether the issue of reformation\r\nwas properly before the circuit court. Reformation was not pled in this action for\r\ncontribution and the issue was presented only in the context of Progressive's\r\nrebuttal to the Silver Dollar's motion for summary judgment. Moreover, the\r\nparties' settlement agreement was submitted to, and presumably approved by, the\r\nfederal district court, and it is unclear whether Progressive ever formally sought\r\n\nreformation in that forum. See Shipyard Prop. Owners' Ass'n v. Mangiaracina,\r\n307 S.C. 299, 307, 414 S.E.2d 795, 801 (Ct. App. 1992) (observing Shipyard\r\nconceded at oral argument that it did not request cancellation or reformation of the\r\ncovenants and restrictions in its pleadings); see also Theophelis v. Lansing Gen.\r\nHosp., 424 N.W.2d 478, 486 (Mich. 1988) (\"Courts are required to proceed with\r\nutmost caution in exercising jurisdiction to reform written instruments.\"; the court\r\nnoted the plaintiffs' request for reformation was made for the first time on appeal).\r\nIn any event, we find Progressive has failed to demonstrate that the principle of\r\nreformation should be applied in this matter.\r\n\r\n       \"A contract may be reformed on the ground of mistake when the mistake is\r\nmutual and consists [of] the omission or insertion of some material element\r\naffecting the subject matter or the terms and stipulations of the contract,\r\ninconsistent with those of the parol agreement which necessarily preceded it.\"\r\nCrosby v. Protective Life Ins. Co., 293 S.C. 203, 206, 359 S.E.2d 298, 300 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1987). \"A mistake is mutual where both parties intended a certain thing and\r\nby mistake in the drafting did not obtain what was intended.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       \"Before equity will reform a contract, the existence of a mutual mistake\r\nmust be shown by clear and convincing evidence.\" Id.; see also Hann v.

See Leonard v. Wash. Emps., Inc., 461 P.2d 538,\r\n543 (Wash. 1970) (stating a party seeking reformation must prove by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that \"innocent third parties will not be unfairly affected by\r\nreformation of the writing\"); Cal. Cas. Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\r\n913 P.2d 505, 510 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1996) (\"Whether the reformation can affect third\r\nparties depends upon whether they had notice of the mistake or of facts which\r\nshould put them on inquiry notice. Generally, reformation cannot negatively\r\nimpact the interest of an innocent third party who has acquired an intervening right\r\nor rightfully relied on the unreformed instrument to its detriment.\" (internal citation\r\nomitted)); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 155 (1981) (\"Where a\r\n\nwriting that evidences or embodies an agreement in whole or in part fails to\r\nexpress the agreement because of a mistake of both parties as to the contents or\r\neffect of the writing, the court may at the request of a party reform the writing to\r\nexpress the agreement, except to the extent that rights of third parties such as good\r\nfaith purchasers for value will be unfairly affected.\"). The principle articulated in\r\nthe Restatement applies in contexts beyond good faith purchasers for value, such as\r\nwhen a third party relies upon a property interest acquired under the original\r\ncontract language. Lunceford v. Houghtlin, 170 S.W.3d 453, 464 n.4 (Mo. Ct.\r\nApp. 2005).\r\n\r\n        In Lunceford, the appellants executed a release with their insurer after\r\nhaving a motorcycle accident, then brought suit against the respondents, the\r\ntortfeasors who allegedly precipitated the accident. Id. at 457. Respondents\r\nasserted the release barred the action because it purported to release all parties and\r\nclaims. Id. Appellants presented a \"corrected release\" and sought reformation on\r\nthe basis of mutual mistake, arguing the settling parties did not intend to release the\r\nliability of all other persons. Id. The appellate court noted that reformation is a\r\nform of equitable relief, and it might not be available in situations where it would\r\nunfairly affect the rights of third parties, citing the Restatement. Id. at 464 n.4.\r\nThe court stated, however, that in this circumstance, \"it is difficult to see how [the\r\nrespondents] would be unfairly affected by reformation of the release\" because\r\nthey were not parties to the prior release, did not contribute funds to the settlement\r\nor otherwise compensate the appellants for their injuries, and there was \"no\r\nshowing that respondents relied to their detriment upon the original release.\" Id.\r\nThe court commented that the effect of the language in the original release would\r\nbe to grant the respondents a windfall, by absolving them of their potential liability\r\nas tortfeasors without any action or contribution on their part. Id.\r\n\r\n        In Lunceford, however, it appears the appellants promptly instituted an\r\naction against the non-settling tortfeasors within the statute of limitations, so the\r\nliability of the tortfeasors had not yet been extinguished at the time the settlement\r\nwas executed. In contrast, no action was ever brought against the Silver Dollar,\r\nand its liability to Witherspoon was presumably extinguished by the running of the\r\nstatute of limitations (barring any application of tolling, estoppel, etc.) prior to the\r\nparties' settlement. Thus, the settlement did not operate to extinguish the Silver\r\nDollar's liability, as it was already extinguished by the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\n      In G & P Trucking v. Parks Auto Sales Service & Salvage, Inc., 357 S.C. 82,\r\n591 S.E.2d 42 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, 365 S.C.\r\n23, 615 S.E.2d 454 (S.C. 2005), the Court of Appeals held that the running of the\r\n\nstatute of limitations on a tort action does not extinguish a tortfeasor's liability so\r\nas to entitle a settling tortfeasor to contribution because the extinguishment of the\r\nliability \"must have resulted directly from the settlement itself,\" not from the prior\r\nrunning of the statute of limitations. Id. at 88, 591 S.E.2d at 45 (emphasis added).\r\nThe court based its holding on the \"plain language\" of section 15-38-20(D), which\r\nprovided that \"[a] tortfeasor who enters into a settlement with a claimant is not\r\nentitled to recover contribution from another tortfeasor whose liability for the\r\ninjury . . . is not extinguished by the settlement . . . .\" Id. at 87-88, 591 S.E.2d at\r\n44-45 (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 15-38-20(D) (Supp. 2002)).\r\n\r\n       The court stated it had \"found nothing in section 15-38-20, or, for that\r\nmatter, any other part of [UCATA], that would suggest that the running of the\r\nstatute of limitations on an action arising from the underlying tort would\r\n'extinguish' a joint tortfeasor's liability so as to entitle a settling tortfeasor to\r\ncontribution.\" Id. at 88, 591 S.E.2d at 45; see also Vermeer Carolina's, Inc. v.\r\nWood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 68-69, 518 S.E.2d 301, 309-10 (Ct. App.\r\n1999) (reasoning \"there was no 'common liability' that could have been discharged\r\nby the settlement agreement\" because there was no liability that existed to be\r\ndischarged). The court in G & P noted that the situation where a statute of\r\nlimitations has run on a joint tortfeasor \"is a rare occasion,\" and stated, \"We do not\r\nchoose to torture the language of [the extinguishment requirement] to permit the\r\nseeking of contribution here even though it might seem fair to do so.\" G & P\r\nTrucking, 357 S.C. at 88 n.8, 591 S.E.2d at 45 n.8 (alteration in original) (quoting\r\nPearson Bros. Co. v. Allen, 476 N.E.2d 73, 75 (Ill. App. Ct. 1985)).\r\n\r\n        While G & P was a statutory construction case, we agree with its concepts\r\nand find Progressive should not be allowed to use the equitable remedy of\r\nreformation to resurrect its contribution rights against the Silver Dollar where the\r\nlatter's liability was already extinguished by the time of the parties' settlement of\r\nWitherspoon's tort action. Since Progressive did not execute the settlement and\r\npay any common liability of the Silver Dollar prior to the running of the statute of\r\nlimitations as provided by section 15-38-40(D)(1), the only avenue available for\r\nProgressive to seek contribution was if an agreement extinguishing the Silver\r\nDollar's liability was made while the tort action was still pending under section 15-\r\n38-40(D)(2). In this case, neither the First Covenant nor the Second Covenant\r\nextinguished the Silver Dollar's liability while the tort action was pending as any\r\npossible liability of the Silver Dollar was already terminated by the running of the\r\nstatute of limitations.\r\n\n       At this point, where the Silver Dollar arguably has no liability as a matter of\r\nlaw, reformation would subject the Silver Dollar to contribution well after its\r\nexposure to liability had ended under UCATA. It would, in effect, allow\r\nProgressive to belatedly make the Silver Dollar a new, additional party to the terms\r\nof the settlement agreement in order to alter the application of the rules governing\r\ncontribution. Cf. Independence Nat'l Bank v. Buncombe Prof'l Park, L.L.C., 402\r\nS.C. 514, ___, 741 S.E.2d 572, 575-76 (Ct. App. 2013) (finding the master erred in\r\nreforming a mortgage to alter the parties' priority rights where reformation was\r\nmade to correct an error in failing to have a party sign a subrogation agreement; the\r\nindividual was not a party to the mortgage and reformation does not permit a court\r\nto write a new, additional party into the mortgage to correct the error); id. at ___,\r\n741 S.E.2d at 576 (\"A court of equity may not add or substitute other parties for\r\nthose appearing on the face of a contract where the effect may be to make a new\r\ncontract.\" (quoting 66 Am. Jur. 2d Reformation of Instruments § 51 (2011))). The\r\nright to contribution and the equitable remedy of reformation are not unlimited. In\r\nthese circumstances, as a matter of law, Progressive has not shown it is entitled to\r\ncontribution or reformation.   IV. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the UCATA provisions governing\r\nthe right of contribution preclude Progressive's contribution action and that\r\nProgressive has not established that it is entitled to reformation. Consequently, we\r\nfind no error in the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to the Silver Dollar.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n     TOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justices James E.

Cook, all of Columbia, for Amicus\r\nCuriae, State of South Carolina.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: This is an appeal from an order according full faith and\r\ncredit to a North Carolina money judgment notwithstanding that the causes of\r\naction upon which the judgment was based have been abolished in South Carolina.\r\nWe affirm.\r\n\r\nSue Taylor Colson Widenhouse (respondent) sued Tammy Batson Colson\r\n(appellant) in North Carolina state court for alienation of affections and criminal\r\nconversation. Judgment was entered for respondent in the sum of $266,000 plus\r\ninterest and costs. Respondent filed notice of foreign judgment with the Greenville\r\nCounty clerk of court. Appellant moved for relief, arguing that respondent's\r\njudgment is not entitled to full faith and credit because the causes of action of\r\nalienation of affections and criminal conversation are contrary to South Carolina\r\npublic policy. Respondent moved to enforce the foreign judgment. The circuit\r\ncourt denied appellant's motion and granted respondent's motion. This appeal\r\nfollowed.                              ISSUE\r\nMust South Carolina afford full faith and credit to a North Carolina money\r\njudgment on a civil action for alienation of affections and criminal conversation?\r\n\r\n                                   DISCUSSION\r\nAppellant contends the circuit court erred when it granted respondent's motion to\r\nenforce the foreign judgment and denied appellant's motion for relief because the\r\nunderlying causes of action violate South Carolina public policy. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina's Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA)\r\nprovides the mechanism for the filing and enforcement or satisfaction of foreign\r\njudgments in South Carolina. S.C. Code Ann. §§ 15-35-900 to -960 (2005 and\r\nSupp. 2012). The UEFJA generally permits the filing and enforcement of\r\njudgments, decrees, and orders of the courts of the United States or of other states1\r\nto the extent mandated by the United States Constitution. See § 15-35-910(1).\r\nHowever, section 15-35-960 provides that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Excluded from the UEFJA are judgments subject to the Uniform Interstate\r\nFamily Support Act and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement\r\nAct, each of which provides special procedures for foreign orders related to its\r\nsubject matter. See §§ 15-35-910, 63-15-300 et seq., and 63-17-2900 et seq.\r\n\n      The provisions of this article do not apply to foreign judgments based\r\n      on claims which are contrary to the public policies of this State.\r\n\r\n“The primary source of the declaration of the public policy of the state is the\r\nGeneral Assembly; the courts assume this prerogative only in the absence of\r\nlegislative declaration.” Citizens’ Bank v. Heyward, 135 S.C. 190, 133 S.E. 709,\r\n713 (1925). The General Assembly abolished the tort of criminal conversation in\r\n1988. S.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-150 (2005), 1988 Act No. 391, § 1. Shortly\r\nthereafter, this Court also determined \"that the public policy of this State is\r\nconsistent with the modern course of the law moving away from 'heart balm'\r\ncauses of action\" and abolished the cause of action for alienation of affections.\r\nRusso v. Sutton, 310 S.C. 200, 204, 422 S.E.2d 750, 753 (1992). The Court\r\nexplained that\r\n\r\n      [c]auses of action for criminal conversation and alienation of\r\n      affections present opportunities for blackmail. They are often brought\r\n      for mercenary or vindictive reasons. The remedies of alienation of\r\n      affections and criminal conversation foster bitterness, promote\r\n      vexatious lawsuits, put marriages on the marketplace, and use\r\n      marriages as a means of character assassination.\r\n\r\nId. at 203-204, 422 S.E.2d at 753. Thus, the causes of action of criminal\r\nconversation and alienation of affections are contrary to South Carolina public\r\npolicy, as appellant contends.\r\n\r\nThe language of § 15-35-960 denying enforcement to \"foreign judgments based on\r\nclaims which are contrary to the public policies of this State\" clearly applies to the\r\njudgment at issue here, since it is based on claims that have been found contrary to\r\nthe public policy of this State. However, respondent argues that application of §\r\n15-35-960 to prevent enforcement of respondent's judgment in this case would\r\nviolate the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe full faith and credit clause provides that\r\n\r\n      Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts,\r\n      Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the\r\n      Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such\r\n      Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.\r\n\nU.S. Const. art. IV, § 1.\r\nAlthough some exceptions to the full faith and credit clause exist, none is relevant\r\nin this case.2 When a civil action has been reduced to a money judgment, the\r\njudgment is entitled to full faith and credit even if the cause of action upon which it\r\nis based is contrary to the forum state's public policy.\r\n\r\nIn Faunterleroy v. Lum, 210 U.S. 230 (1908), a Mississippi court denied full faith\r\nand credit to a Missouri judgment entered on a cause of action for enforcement of a\r\ncontract that was illegal in Mississippi. The United States Supreme Court held that\r\nthe Missouri judgment was entitled to full faith and credit in Mississippi and could\r\nbe attacked in Mississippi only on grounds recognized by Missouri. Id. at 236\r\n(\"[T]he judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect\r\nin every other court in the United States which it had in the state where it was\r\npronounced, and . . . whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state,\r\nand none others, could be pleaded in any other court in the United States.\" (quoting\r\nHampton v. McConnel, 16 U.S. 234 (1818)). This rule was reaffirmed in\r\nMilwaukee County v. M.E. White Co., where the Court reiterated that the policy of\r\nthe forum state cannot nullify the command of the full faith and credit clause:\r\n\r\n      In numerous cases this court has held that credit must be given to the\r\n      judgment of another state, although the forum would not be required\r\n      to entertain the suit on which the judgment was founded; that\r\n      considerations of policy of the forum which would defeat a suit upon\r\n      the original cause of action are not involved in a suit upon the\r\n      judgment and are insufficient to defeat it. Full faith and credit is\r\n      required to be given to the judgment of another state, although the\r\n      original suit on which it was based arose in the state of the forum and\r\n      was barred there by the Statute of Limitations when the judgment was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 For example, a judgment rendered without subject matter or personal jurisdiction\r\nor otherwise lacking due process, or produced through fraud or collusion, is not\r\nentitled to full faith and credit. See Morris v. Jones, 329 U.S. 545, 550-51 (1947);\r\nOld Wayne Mut. Life Ass'n v. McDonough, 204 U.S. 8, 15 (1907). Nor is a state\r\nrequired to defer to another state's judgment regarding \"the disposition or\r\ndevolution of realty\" in the forum state, Williams v. State of North Carolina, 317\r\nU.S. 287, 294 n.5 (1942), or to apply the law of another state in an action in its\r\nown courts, Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U.S. 430, 436-37 (1943).\r\n\n      rendered and where the original suit was upon a gambling contract\r\n      invalid by the law of the forum where it was made.\r\n\r\n296 U.S. 268, 277 (1935) (citations omitted). Likewise, the Supreme Court\r\nhas explicitly stated that no public policy exception to the full faith and\r\ncredit clause exists where a civil dispute has been reduced to a money\r\njudgment:\r\n\r\n      We are aware of no [public policy] exception in the case of a money\r\n      judgment rendered in a civil suit. Nor are we aware of any\r\n      considerations of local policy or law which could rightly be deemed to\r\n      impair the force and effect which the full faith and credit clause . . .\r\n      require[s] to be given to such a judgment outside the state of its\r\n      rendition.\r\n\r\nMagnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U.S. 430, 438 (1943). Other cases are in\r\naccord. See, e.g., Morris v. Jones, 329 U.S. 545, 551 (1947) (\"[A] judgment\r\nobtained in a sister State is, with exceptions not relevant here, entitled to full faith\r\nand credit in another State, though the underlying claim would not be enforced in\r\nthe State of the forum.\" (citation omitted)); Roche v. McDonald, 275 U.S. 449, 452\r\n(1928) (\"[T]he judgment, if valid where rendered, must be enforced in such other\r\nState although repugnant to its own statutes.\"); Estin v. Estin, 334 U.S. 541, 546\r\n(1948) (the full faith and credit clause \"order[s] submission by one State even to\r\nhostile policies reflected in the judgment of another State . . . . [T]he requirements\r\nof full faith and credit, so far as judgments are concerned, are exacting, if not\r\ninexorable . . . .\"). Thus, we conclude that under the full faith and credit clause a\r\nmoney judgment obtained in another state must be accorded full faith and credit\r\nregardless of the underlying cause of action.\r\n\r\nAppellant has cited no cases, either state or federal, holding that full faith and\r\ncredit is not due another state's money judgment on a civil action.\r\n\r\nWe conclude § 15-35-960 cannot be applied to deny full faith and credit to the\r\nNorth Carolina money judgment at issue here.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\nBecause respondent's civil action was reduced to a money judgment in North\r\nCarolina, the judgment is entitled to full faith and credit in South Carolina.\r\nTherefore, we\r\n\nAFFIRM.\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.

The liability coverage of the\r\n\ndriver, John Ludwig, was exhausted in settlement of the wrongful death action, and\r\nwe are now asked to consider the impact of the collateral source rule on\r\nunderinsured motorist property damage coverage where the homeowners' policy\r\nhas already paid for the property damage. We hold the collateral source rule does\r\nnot apply and there is no underinsured motorist property damage coverage\r\navailable, and accordingly, reverse.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       After leaving a wedding reception, Ludwig drove a Maserati owned by his\r\ncompany, System Development Integration, Inc. (SDI), at speeds of 85 to 96 miles\r\nper hour down a road with a 35 miles per hour speed limit. His car left the road,\r\nwent up an embankment and became airborne, crashed into the rear of the\r\nBardsleys' residence approximately ten feet above the ground, and struck Frederic,\r\nresulting in his immediate death. The vehicle continued through the home, crashed\r\nthrough the front of the house, and came to rest in the front yard. Auto Owners\r\nInsurance Company and Hartford Casualty Insurance Company insured Ludwig\r\nand SDI for $3 million in liability coverage.1\r\n\r\n       The Bardsleys had $457,318.47 in homeowner's insurance coverage through\r\nState Farm. That policy provides: \"If a loss covered by this policy is also covered\r\nby other insurance, we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the\r\nproportion of the loss that the applicable limit under this policy bears to the total\r\namount of insurance covering the loss.\"\r\n\r\n      Additionally, the Bardsleys had automobile insurance through Government\r\nEmployees Insurance Company (GEICO), which provided $300,000 in\r\nunderinsured motorist (UIM) bodily injury coverage and $100,000 in UIM\r\nproperty damage coverage. The policy provides: \"With respect to property\r\ndamage, this insurance shall be excess over other valid and collectible insurance\r\napplicable to the damaged property.\"\r\n\r\n      On behalf of her husband's estate, Francina settled a wrongful death claim\r\nwith Auto Owners and Hartford. They agreed to pay the policy limits of $3\r\nmillion, and she agreed to sign a covenant not to execute against Ludwig, SDI,\r\nAuto Owners, and Hartford, and to resolve State Farm's subrogation claim out of\r\nthe settlement proceeds. The probate court approved the settlement in an order\r\n\r\n1Auto Owners provided $1 million in automobile liability coverage, and Hartford\r\nprovided $2 million in umbrella liability coverage.\r\n\nstating the $3 million dollar payment \"is to be allocated 100% to the wrongful\r\ndeath claim as the parties stipulate there is no valid survival claim.\"\r\n\r\n       State Farm paid $127,813.49 to repair the Bardsleys' home, but claimed it\r\nwas entitled to reimbursement for those expenses from the $3 million settlement\r\npursuant to its subrogation right. GEICO paid out the full $300,000 in UIM bodily\r\ninjury coverage in exchange for a covenant not to execute as to any bodily injury\r\nclaim. However, GEICO refused to pay any amount under the UIM property\r\ndamage coverage.\r\n\r\n       Francina filed the instant declaratory judgment action against GEICO and\r\nState Farm, alleging GEICO was obligated to pay her the $100,000 in UIM\r\nproperty damage coverage. She also alleged State Farm wrongfully claimed it was\r\nentitled to subrogation from the $3 million settlement because those funds were\r\nallocated solely to the wrongful death claim.\r\n\r\n       Francina later reached a settlement with State Farm whereby she paid\r\n$94,424.75 from the $3 million settlement and signed a covenant not to execute,\r\nand State Farm agreed its subrogation claim was satisfied. The covenant not to\r\nexecute stated: \"as a direct and proximate result of the Ludwig Incident, Plaintiff\r\nsustained $88,230.47 for damages to the Residence, $23,684.44 for damages to\r\ncontents, and an additional $22,959.99 for loss of use and living expenses.\"\r\n\r\n      As to the remaining claim against GEICO, Francina and GEICO filed cross-\r\nmotions for summary judgment. Francina asserted GEICO was obligated to pay\r\nher because the home sustained $127,813.49 in property damage and those claims\r\nwere not paid out of the available insurance because State Farm was reimbursed\r\nfrom the settlement. She also argued the \"other insurance\" provision in the GEICO\r\npolicy was void because it was contrary to the collateral source rule and public\r\npolicy. GEICO argued the State Farm coverage had not been exhausted and thus,\r\npursuant to the \"other insurance\" provision, GEICO's policy was excess to the\r\nState Farm coverage and there was no UIM property damage coverage available\r\nunder the GEICO policy.\r\n\r\n       The circuit court granted summary judgment for Francina and ordered\r\nGEICO to pay Francina $100,000 for UIM property damage coverage. The court\r\nfirst found the \"other insurance\" provision was ambiguous. However, it did not\r\nstate how the provision was ambiguous or provide any reasoning. The summary\r\njudgment order simply states: \"GEICO's policy . . . when read as a whole, is\r\nambiguous and contains conflicting terms.\" The court also held the \"other\r\n\ninsurance\" provision violated the collateral source rule. Specifically, it found the\r\nState Farm policy was a collateral source which GEICO could not use to decrease\r\nits obligations and found there would be no double recovery because the wrongful\r\ndeath claim was settled for Auto Owners' and Hartford's policy limits despite being\r\nworth more. Finally, the court did not explicitly rule on the public policy\r\nargument, finding only that \"GEICO's UIM rider may also contravene public\r\npolicy since any exclusions inconsistent with the UIM statute are void.\" (emphasis\r\nadded). GEICO appealed, and this Court certified the appeal for review pursuant\r\nto Rule 204(b), SCACR.        ISSUES PRESENTED\r\nI. \t    Did the circuit court err in finding the GEICO policy ambiguous?\r\n\r\nII. \t Did the circuit court err in finding the \"other insurance\" provision\r\n      violates public policy?\r\n\r\nIII.\t   Did the circuit court err in holding the collateral source rule renders the\r\n        \"other insurance\" provision invalid?\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.      \t MBIGUITY\r\n        A\r\n\r\n       GEICO argues the circuit court erred in holding the \"other insurance\"\r\nprovision ambiguous because the court failed to set forth more than one way it\r\ncould be reasonably understood. Francina counters that a court does not have to\r\nset out alternative meanings of a provision in order to find it ambiguous and the\r\nambiguity here is clear on the face of the provision and from the record. We hold\r\nthe circuit court erred in finding the provision ambiguous.\r\n\r\n      Stated simply, \"[a] contract is ambiguous when it is capable of more than\r\none meaning or when its meaning is unclear.\" Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78,\r\n94, 594 S.E.2d 485, 494 (Ct. App. 2004). \"An ambiguous contract is one capable\r\nof being understood in more senses than one, an agreement obscure in meaning,\r\nthrough indefiniteness of expression, or having a double meaning.\" Bruce v.\r\nBlalock, 241 S.C. 155, 160, 127 S.E.2d 439, 441 (1962). Accordingly, when a\r\ncourt makes a finding of ambiguity, it must set forth either how a provision is\r\ncapable of more than one meaning or is obscure in meaning. A simple finding of\r\nambiguity, absent any reasoning, is insufficient. Without more, an appellate court\r\n\nis unable to review the validity of a circuit court's conclusion that a provision is\r\nambiguous.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, Francina asserts the provision is ambiguous \"on its face,\"\r\nbecause the policy does not define \"other valid and collectible insurance,\" and due\r\nto a conflicting provision. We find the provision is not ambiguous on its face as\r\nthere is nothing inherently unclear or confusing about the term \"other valid and\r\ncollectible insurance.\" It plainly means other insurance which is in effect and from\r\nwhich coverage is available. Setting aside the issue of State Farm's subrogation\r\nclaim, Francina collected from State Farm, and thus, it cannot be disputed that the\r\nState Farm policy was other valid and collectible insurance.\r\n\r\n       The provision also is not ambiguous merely because its terms are undefined\r\nin the policy. It is a well-settled principle of contract interpretation that absent a\r\ncontractual definition to the contrary, contract language is given its ordinary and\r\nplain meaning. See, e.g., Dean v. Am. Fire & Cas. Co., 249 S.C. 39, 41, 152\r\nS.E.2d 247, 248 (1967) (\"When the language of an insurance contract is free from\r\nambiguity, the words used must be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary\r\nand popular sense . . . .\"). If policy language was rendered ambiguous simply\r\nbecause it was not defined, insurance policies would need to contain definitions for\r\nevery word in order to avoid ambiguity, a requirement which would be absurd. To\r\nsay that any word that is not defined is ambiguous is to ignore the utility of human\r\nlanguage. We use words because they have commonly accepted meanings, and it\r\nis only when they are subject to more than one meaning as used in a particular\r\npolicy that they may become ambiguous.\r\n\r\n        Finally, the provision is not rendered ambiguous by a conflicting provision.\r\nThe policy contains an additional UIM provision which states \"[t]here is no\r\ncoverage for property damage if the insured has been compensated by insurance or\r\notherwise,\" and Francina asserts that provision conflicts with the \"other insurance\"\r\nprovision and renders it ambiguous. One interpretation of that provision would be\r\nthat it bars any UIM property damage coverage under the policy where the insured\r\nreceives any compensation from another source, even if that compensation did not\r\ncover all of the insured's damages. Under that interpretation, it would conflict with\r\nthe \"other insurance\" provision which states an insured has UIM property damage\r\ncoverage to the extent her damages exceed the coverage available from other\r\ninsurance. \"[C]onflicting terms in an insurance policy must be construed liberally\r\nin favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.\" Diamond State Ins. Co. v.\r\nHomestead Indus., Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 236, 456 S.E.2d 912, 915 (1995). Thus, to\r\nthe extent the two provisions conflict, in order to interpret the policy in favor of the\r\n\ninsured, we would construe the policy in line with the \"other insurance\" provision,\r\nthe provision more favorable to the insured. Therefore, the \"other insurance\"\r\nprovision would remain in force, and the purportedly conflicting provision has no\r\neffect on the validity of the \"other insurance\" provision. Accordingly, we conclude\r\nthe circuit court erred in finding the \"other insurance\" provision ambiguous.\r\n\r\nII.   PUBLIC POLICY\r\n       GEICO also argues the circuit court erred in holding the \"other insurance\"\r\nprovision violates public policy and therefore is invalid. The circuit court did not\r\nrule the provision contravened public policy, stating only that the provision \"may\r\nalso contravene public policy;\" therefore, there is no ruling to appeal from.\r\nHowever, Francina argues this issue is an additional sustaining ground and asserts\r\nthe \"other insurance\" provision is void as a matter of public policy because\r\ncontrary to the legislative intent of the UIM statute, Section 38-77-160 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2002). We therefore consider the issue, but find the \"other\r\ninsurance\" provision does not violate public policy.\r\n\r\n       Section 38-77-160 requires that an insurer \"offer . . . underinsured motorist\r\ncoverage . . . .\" An \"underinsured motor vehicle\" is statutorily defined as \"a motor\r\nvehicle as to which there is bodily injury insurance liability . . . at the time of the\r\naccident in an amount of at least that specified in Section 38-77-140 and the\r\namount of the insurance . . . is less than the amount of the insureds' damages.\"\r\nS.C. Code § 38-77-30(15) (2002). Thus, UIM property damage coverage is not\r\nstatutorily mandated, and the \"other insurance\" provision does not conflict with the\r\npublic policy expressed in section 38-77-160.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, the provision does not deprive the insured of any coverage for\r\nwhich she bargained, nor would it violate a State policy of providing coverage\r\nwhen an injured party's property damages exceed the liability limits of the at-fault\r\nmotorist, assuming such policy existed. The \"other insurance\" provision does\r\nnothing more than make the GEICO UIM coverage secondary to other insurance\r\nthat covers the loss. It does not leave an insured without coverage. If an insured\r\ndoes not have any other insurance covering the property damage, the provision\r\nwould have no effect and the GEICO UIM benefits would pay for the damages. If\r\nan insured has other insurance but it does not satisfy the entire loss, the GEICO\r\nUIM coverage would pay for all of the damages beyond those satisfied by the other\r\ninsurance and up to the limit of the UIM coverage.\r\n\n       Francina also argues the provision violates public policy in that it would\r\neliminate UIM coverage for property damage to a home caused by a vehicle\r\nbecause in South Carolina homeowner's insurance policies are \"stated value\"\r\npolicies that insure the entire value of a home. This is immaterial to whether the\r\nprovision violates public policy. So long as any damage to a home would be\r\ncovered by some insurance, there is no harm in UIM property damage coverage\r\nnot applying. Accordingly, we find the \"other insurance\" provision does not\r\nviolate public policy.\r\n\r\nIII.   COLLATERAL SOURCE RULE\r\n       Finally, GEICO argues the circuit court erred in holding the collateral source\r\nrule renders the \"other insurance\" provision invalid. Francina contends the State\r\nFarm policy was a collateral source and thus, the collateral source rule bars GEICO\r\nfrom using the State Farm coverage to avoid making payments under its UIM\r\ncoverage. We hold the collateral source rule does not affect the \"other insurance\"\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\n      The collateral source rule provides that compensation which an injured party\r\nreceives from a source wholly independent of a wrongdoer will not reduce the\r\ndamages for which the wrongdoer is liable. Citizens & S. Nat'l Bank of S.C. v.\r\nGregory, 320 S.C. 90, 92, 463 S.E.2d 317, 318 (1995). The rule exists because\r\n\r\n       reducing recovery by the amount of the benefits received by the\r\n       plaintiff would grant a windfall to the defendant by allowing a credit\r\n       for the reasonable value of those benefits. Such credit would result in\r\n       the benefits being effectively directed to the tortfeasor and from the\r\n       intended party—the injured plaintiff. If there is a windfall, it is\r\n       considered more just that the injured person profit rather than grant\r\n       the wrongdoer relief from full responsibility for the wrongdoing.\r\n\r\n22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages § 392 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n       As an initial matter, it is indisputable that the State Farm coverage was a\r\ncollateral source in regards to Ludwig. Ludwig was clearly the tortfeasor, and\r\nthus, the collateral source rule applies to him, and he could not reduce his liability\r\nby the amount of the State Farm coverage. However, the State Farm coverage is\r\nonly collateral with respect to GEICO if the collateral source rule applies to\r\nGEICO.\r\n\n       GEICO asserts the collateral source rule only applies to wrongdoers, it is not\r\na wrongdoer, and therefore, the rule cannot render its \"other insurance\" provision\r\ninvalid. Francina counters that the collateral source rule applies to any party\r\nseeking to reduce obligations to a victim as a result of contributions made by\r\nothers to the victim. In other words, she asserts the only requirement for the\r\napplication of the collateral source rule is that the source is wholly independent of\r\nthe wrongdoer.\r\n\r\n       We find this contention plainly contrary to our jurisprudence, which makes\r\nclear that the collateral source rule only applies to a \"wrongdoer\"/\"tortfeasor.\" See\r\nGregory, 320 S.C. at 92, 463 S.E.2d at 318 (\"The collateral source rule provides\r\nthat compensation received by an injured party from a source wholly independent\r\nof the wrongdoer will not reduce the amount of damages owed by the wrongdoer.\"\r\n(emphasis added)); Estate of Rattenni v. Grainger, 298 S.C. 276, 277, 379 S.E.2d\r\n890, 890 (1989) (\"South Carolina has long followed the collateral source rule that\r\ncompensation received by an injured party from a source wholly independent of\r\nthe wrongdoer should not be deducted from the amount of damages owed by the\r\nwrongdoer to the injured party.\" (emphasis added)); New Found. Baptist Church v.\r\nDavis, 257 S.C. 443, 446, 186 S.E.2d 247, 249 (1972) (\"[T]he 'collateral source\r\nrule' is that which holds that total or partial compensation for injury which an\r\ninjured party receives from a collateral source, wholly independent of the\r\nwrongdoer, does not operate to lessen the damages recoverable from the\r\nwrongdoer.\" (emphasis added)); Young v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, 197, 165 S.E.2d\r\n797, 806 (1969) (\"Under the 'collateral source rule' a tort feasor has no right to any\r\nmitigation of damages because of payments or compensation received by the\r\ninjured person from an independent source.\" (emphasis added)). Therefore,\r\ncontrary to Francina's assertions, the collateral source rule does not automatically\r\napply to GEICO, but will only apply to GEICO if it is a \"wrongdoer.\"\r\n\r\n       We believe our existing case law establishes that GEICO, as a UIM insurer,\r\nis not a wrongdoer. We have held that UIM benefits are a collateral source, and\r\nthus, because a source must be wholly independent of the wrongdoer to be a\r\ncollateral source, UIM insurance is wholly independent of the wrongdoer.\r\nRattenni, 298 S.C. at 278, 379 S.E.2d at 890. Because UIM coverage is a source\r\nwholly independent of the wrongdoer, a fortiori, a UIM insurer is not a wrongdoer\r\nand the collateral source rule does not apply.\r\n\r\n      Furthermore, a source is wholly independent of the wrongdoer when the\r\nwrongdoer has not contributed to it and when payments to the injured party were\r\nnot made on behalf of the wrongdoer. Gregory, 320 S.C. at 92, 463 S.E.2d at 318;\r\n\nMount v. Sea Pines Co., 337 S.C. 355, 357, 523 S.E.2d 464, 465 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLudwig did not contribute to the GEICO policy, and any payments made from it\r\nwould not be made on his behalf.\r\n\r\n        Moreover, we find applying the collateral source rule against GEICO as a\r\nUIM insurer is inappropriate because extending the collateral source rule to cover\r\nGEICO as a UIM insurer would not serve the policy behind the rule. As discussed,\r\nthe purpose of the collateral source rule is to give the injured party the benefit of\r\nany windfall rather than allowing the tortfeasor to profit by his wrongful acts.\r\nHere, GEICO as a UIM insurer has not acted wrongly or tortiously towards\r\nFrancina and would not experience a windfall by not having to pay the UIM\r\nproperty damage benefits. Whether GEICO does or does not have to pay UIM\r\nbenefits does not affect Ludwig. Francina signed a covenant not to execute and\r\nsettled with Ludwig. Thus, Ludwig was completely released from liability and any\r\npayment of UIM benefits GEICO may make cannot affect his now extinguished\r\nliability. Furthermore, even if Francina had not settled and Ludwig was subject to\r\nadditional liability to her, because Ludwig is the tortfeasor to whom the collateral\r\nsource rule applies and UIM coverage is a collateral source, Ludwig's liability\r\nwould not be affected by any UIM payment. See Rattenni, 298 S.C. at 278, 379\r\nS.E.2d at 890 (holding that the collateral source rule bars a tortfeasor from\r\nreducing his liability by the amount of any UIM payments made to a plaintiff).\r\nTherefore, the purpose of the collateral source rule would not be served by\r\napplying it in this situation. Instead, this is merely a contractual issue, and GEICO\r\nshould be treated according to the terms of the contract.\r\n\r\n        Applying the collateral source rule to UIM insurers would also upset settled\r\njurisprudence and create the distorted result of permitting tortfeasors to reduce\r\ntheir liability by the amount of any UIM payments made to a victim. To find that\r\nGEICO is a wrongdoer against whom the collateral source rule applies would\r\npresumably also mean reversal of Rattenni and the rule that UIM benefits are a\r\ncollateral source. This is because by finding that GEICO is a wrongdoer, we\r\nwould be holding that UIM benefits are not wholly independent of the wrongdoer,\r\nand thus, they could no longer be a collateral source. Because UIM coverage\r\nwould no longer be a collateral source, the collateral source rule would no longer\r\nbar a tortfeasor from reducing his liability by the amount of the UIM payments.\r\nThe collateral source rule's purpose of ensuring that any windfall goes to the victim\r\nrather than the tortfeasor would thus be circumvented.\r\n\r\n     Finally, the fact that Francina settled State Farm's subrogation claim is\r\nimmaterial to whether the collateral source rule applies. Francina stipulated that\r\n\nState Farm covered all of her property damage, but to satisfy State Farm's\r\nsubrogation claim she used the proceeds of her settlement with Auto Owners and\r\nHartford to reimburse it for part of those payments. Her settlement of the\r\nsubrogation claim does not mean she did not receive coverage and payment for her\r\nproperty damages. She chose to settle the subrogation claim, when she could have\r\npursued her declaratory judgment action against State Farm. She also could have\r\nrefused to settle with Auto Owners and Hartford if they would not abandon the\r\ncondition that she use the settlement proceeds to satisfy State Farm's subrogation\r\nclaim.Therefore, we conclude the collateral source rule does not apply to GEICO\r\nand does not render the \"other insurance\" provision void. Having found the\r\nprovision valid, we now apply it and find it resolves this dispute. As this Court has\r\nrecognized:\r\n\r\n      One method insurance companies use to indicate whether they intend\r\n      to provide primary, secondary, or other coverage is to include in their\r\n      policies \"other insurance\" clauses that attempt to apportion liability\r\n      among multiple insurers. An \"excess\" clause, the most common kind\r\n      of \"other insurance\" clause, provides that a policy will cover only\r\n      amounts exceeding the policy limits of other insurance covering the\r\n      same risk to the same property.\r\n\r\nS.C. Ins. Co. v. Fid. & Guar. Ins. Underwriters Inc., 327 S.C. 207, 215, 489 S.E.2d\r\n200, 204 (1997). Thus, by providing that \"this insurance shall be excess over other\r\nvalid and collectible insurance applicable to the damaged property,\" the GEICO\r\npolicy's \"other insurance\" provision is an \"excess\" clause.\r\n\r\n       The State Farm policy provides: \"If a loss covered by this policy is also\r\ncovered by other insurance, we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the\r\nproportion of the loss that the applicable limit under this policy bears to the total\r\namount of insurance covering the loss.\" This is a \"'pro rata' clause, which provides\r\nthat the insurer will pay its share of the loss in the proportion its policy limits\r\nrelates to the aggregate liability coverage available.\" Id. at 211, 489 S.E.2d at 202.\r\n\r\n      When two policies insure the same risk and one policy contains a pro rata\r\nclause while the other contains an excess clause, the policy with the pro rata clause\r\nprovides primary coverage and the policy with the excess clause provides excess\r\ncoverage. See, e.g., Am. Interinsurance Exch. v. Commercial Union Assurance\r\nCo., 605 F.2d 731, 736 (4th Cir. 1979) (holding that a policy with an excess clause\r\n\nwas excess to a policy with a pro rata clause); 46 C.J.S. Insurance § 1543 (\"Where\r\ntwo insurance policies afford coverage on a particular loss, and one contains a\r\nprorated clause as to the other insurance, while the other policy contains an excess\r\nclause, the policy containing the excess clause does not provide any coverage until\r\nthe other policy is exhausted.\"). Therefore, GEICO's UIM property damage\r\ncoverage is excess to the State Farm coverage, and because the State Farm policy\r\nlimits were not exhausted, GEICO is not obligated to make any UIM property\r\ndamage benefits payments to Francina.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n     For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and order the entry of summary\r\njudgment for GEICO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur.

Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462\r\n(1997). According to Appellant, this charge is no longer valid in light of this\r\nCourt's decisions in State v. Bostick, 392 S.C. 134, 708 S.E.2d 774 (2011) and\r\nState v. Odems, 395 S.C. 582, 720 S.E.2d 48 (2011). We affirm Appellant's\r\nconviction.       FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n      On May 10, 2010, the Charleston County Grand Jury indicted Appellant for\r\nattempted CSC-First in violation of section 16-3-652 of the South Carolina Code\r\nand \"strong-arm\" robbery (SAR) in violation of section 16-11-325 of the South\r\nCarolina Code.1 S.C. Code Ann. §§ 16-3-652, 16-11-325 (2003). Appellant\r\nproceeded to trial on June 8, 2011.\r\n\r\n        At trial, Jarvia O'Neal testified that in the early morning of February 4, 2010,\r\nat approximately 1:45 a.m., O'Neal went to the Lovey Dovey, \"a social club where\r\nyou can eat crabs,\" with two friends, Andrea Bell and Virgil Washington. O'Neal\r\ntestified that at some point during her visit Appellant approached her and made\r\nunwanted sexual advances. Appellant appeared heavily intoxicated. O'Neal\r\nrebuffed Appellant's advances, and then made her way to the restroom. As O'Neal\r\nentered the restroom, Appellant forced his way inside with her. According to\r\nO'Neal, Appellant proceeded to choke her, and attempted to sexually assault her.\r\nAppellant also punched O'Neal several times. O'Neal fought back in an attempt to\r\nfend off Appellant's attack. O'Neal then kicked Appellant between his legs, and\r\nwas only then able to remove herself from the situation. During the attack,\r\nAppellant removed O'Neal's driver's license and twenty dollars from her purse.\r\nAppellant exited the restroom shortly after O'Neal kicked him, and O'Neal\r\ndeparted the restroom after Appellant. O'Neal testified that she did not notify\r\npolice or go to the hospital immediately following the attack because she was\r\nafraid. Later, on the afternoon of February 4, O'Neal visited the hospital to receive\r\n\r\n1 \"The common law offense of robbery is a felony. Upon conviction, a person\r\nmust be imprisoned not more than fifteen years.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 16-11-325\r\n(2003); see also State v. Brown, 274 S.C. 48, 49, 260 S.E.2d 719, 720 (2003)\r\n(holding that common-law robbery is essentially the commission of larceny with\r\nforce).\r\n\ntreatment for her injuries. O'Neal provided the police with a statement during her\r\nhospital visit.\r\n\r\n       O'Neal then contacted Aaron Green, the Lovey Dovey's manager. Green\r\ninformed O'Neal that while he did not personally know Appellant, he knew\r\nAppellant used the nickname \"Blackout,\" and owned a blue Thunderbird. O'Neal\r\nsupplied police with this information. O'Neal noticed a blue Thunderbird near her\r\nhome on several occasions following the attack, and on at least one of those\r\noccasions, O'Neal recognized Appellant as the vehicle's driver. O'Neal notified\r\npolice on each occasion. Police contacted O'Neal and asked her to choose\r\nAppellant's photograph out of a group of six photographs. O'Neal chose\r\nAppellant.2\r\n\r\n       Andrea Bell testified that O'Neal excused herself to the restroom at some\r\npoint during their visit to the Lovey Dovey. Bell stated that a short time later she\r\nobserved a \"young\" man, wearing a white t-shirt, walking away from the\r\nbathroom, and \"pulling up his pants.\"3 Bell then overheard someone inquire\r\nwhether \"something going [sic] on in the bathroom,\" prompting Bell to walk over\r\nto the restroom. Bell described O'Neal's demeanor, stating, \"All I see was she was\r\nupset, and her face was swollen. Like I think it was her eye and her lip that were\r\nswollen.\" Bell testified that she could not identify Appellant as the man she\r\nobserved coming out of the bathroom that night. Bell assisted O'Neal with her\r\ninjuries, but did not discuss anything that might have happened between O'Neal\r\nand Appellant.\r\n\r\n       Virgil Washington testified that he knew O'Neal, but did not consider her a\r\nfriend. Washington testified that on the night of the attack he merely provided\r\ntransportation for O'Neal at the request of his friend, Aaron Green. According to\r\nWashington, he noticed a commotion near the restroom, and when O'Neal exited\r\nthe restroom she \"was highly upset.\" Washington also observed blood on O'Neal's\r\nface. O'Neal mentioned to Washington that Appellant hit her. Washington\r\n\r\n2 Omar Faison, a North Charleston police officer at the time of the incident,\r\ntestified that he presented O'Neal with pictures of six individuals with the same\r\nheight, weight, and physical features, and that O'Neal identified Appellant without\r\nhesitation.\r\n3At trial, Bell could not identify Appellant as the \"young\" man she observed that\r\nnight.\r\n\ntestified that in addition to the blood on O'Neal's face, he later observed at least\r\ntwo cuts to her face.\r\n\r\n       Aaron Green testified that he observed Appellant and O'Neal conversing on\r\nthe night of the incident. Later, Green observed Appellant and O'Neal exit from\r\nthe same bathroom, and Appellant stated that he was looking for his cell phone.\r\nGreen testified that O'Neal told him she and Appellant had a \"confrontation,\" but\r\nthat she did not want Green to notify police. Green stated he observed O'Neal's\r\nhair was \"wild\" and O'Neal had a bruise and some bleeding on her face. In the\r\ndays following the incident, O'Neal disclosed to Green that Appellant attempted to\r\nsexually assault her, and Green provided O'Neal with a description of Appellant's\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n       Alex Gray, a patrolman with the North Charleston Police Department\r\nresponded to Roper Hospital where O'Neal sought treatment following the attack.\r\nGray testified that O'Neal had a black eye, a laceration across the bridge of her\r\nnose and the left side of her face, cuts on the inside of her mouth, and a knot on the\r\nright side of her head. Gray testified that O'Neal provided him with a description\r\nof the incident, as well as Appellant's nickname and physical description.4 At the\r\nconclusion of the State's case, Appellant's trial counsel moved for a directed\r\nverdict, stating, \"I would move for a directed verdict pursuant to I believe it's\r\ncriminal Rule 19.\" The trial court denied Appellant's motion. Following\r\nAppellant's decision not to testify, the trial court discussed jury instructions with\r\nthe parties. Appellant's trial counsel raised an objection touching on the trial\r\ncourt's proposed circumstantial evidence charge, stating:\r\n\r\n      I have an objection to—I know it's not routine, but the now standard\r\n      direct and circumstantial evidence charge, particularly the portion that\r\n      says . . . the law makes absolutely no distinction between the weight\r\n      or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence. I think\r\n\r\n4 The State also presented the testimony of Marquise O'Neal and Rhonda Deveaux,\r\nO'Neal's family members. These witnesses testified that they observed a vehicle\r\nmatching the description of Appellant's in the immediate vicinity of O'Neal's\r\nresidence. Additionally, Craig McAlheney, an officer with the North Charleston\r\nPolice Department testified that he responded to a telephone call from O'Neal.\r\nO'Neal explained to McAlheney that Appellant's vehicle drove in front of her\r\nhouse, and she provided McAlheney with a physical description of the driver, and\r\nwhat O'Neal believed to be the vehicle's license tag number.\r\n\n         that after our Supreme Court opinion in Bostick that came out, I want\r\n         to say, earlier this year where the Supreme Court said that the trial\r\n         court should have directed a verdict because the case was entirely\r\n         circumstantial, they appealed to four different pieces of circumstantial\r\n         evidence . . . that line of cases, Shropp5 and Arnold [361 S.C. 386, 605\r\n         S.E.2d 529 (2004)] and now Bostick, they are now dealing with this\r\n         jury charge, so I guess what I'm asking is to argue against precedent to\r\n         say that the standard charge, I think this is from Ripon6 that says that\r\n         the direct and circumstantial evidence are equally—\r\n\r\n       The trial court interrupted the argument, stating, \"I'm not familiar with the\r\nexact case you're referring to, but I usually on—there is a difference when it comes\r\nto directed verdict between direct and circumstantial evidence.\" The trial court\r\nthen acknowledged that circumstantial evidence had to be \"substantial,\" and that he\r\nwas not sure that \"they,\" presumably this Court, \"had changed that rule.\"\r\nAppellant's trial counsel responded:\r\n\r\n         In case they want to, I have to give them the opportunity to do it, and I\r\n         think the proposition—the law makes absolutely no distinction\r\n         between the weight or value to be given to either direct or\r\n         circumstantial evidence is no longer valid.\r\n\r\n       The trial court denied the motion, and then delivered the following\r\ninstruction regarding direct and circumstantial evidence:\r\n\r\n         There are two types of evidence generally presented in a trial. There\r\n         is direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. Direct evidence is\r\n         testimony of a person who claims to have actual knowledge of a fact,\r\n         such as an eyewitness, and this is evidence which immediately\r\n         establishes the main fact to be proved. Circumstantial evidence is\r\n         proof of a chain of facts and circumstances which indicate the\r\n         existence of a fact, and this is evidence which immediately establishes\r\n         collateral facts from which a main fact may be inferred.\r\n         Circumstantial evidence is based on inference and not on personal\r\n         knowledge or observation. The law makes absolutely no distinction\r\n\r\n5Appellant's trial counsel appears to have been referring to State v. Schrock, 283\r\nS.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 (1984).\r\n6   Appellant's trial counsel appears to have been referring to Grippon.\r\n\n        between the weight or value to be given either direct or circumstantial\r\n        evidence, nor is a greater degree of certainty required of\r\n        circumstantial evidence than direct evidence. You should weigh all\r\n        the evidence in this case, and, after weighing the testimony, if you are\r\n        not convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, you\r\n        must find the defendant not guilty.\r\n\r\n       The jury found Appellant guilty of attempted CSC-First but not guilty of\r\nSAR. The trial court sentenced Appellant to ten years' imprisonment. On June 15,\r\n2011, Appellant's trial counsel filed a notice of appeal. This Court certified the\r\ncase for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n\r\n        Did the trial court err in providing a circumstantial evidence jury\r\n        instruction consistent with this Court's holding in Grippon?\r\n\r\n                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n        In reviewing jury charges for error, this Court considers the trial court's jury\r\ncharge as a whole and in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial. State v.\r\nBrandt, 393 S.C. 526, 549, 713 S.E.2d 591, 604 (2011). A jury charge is correct if,\r\nwhen read as a whole, the charge adequately covers the law. Id. \"A jury charge\r\nthat is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.\" Id.\r\n(citing State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 16, 479 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1996)).\r\n\r\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that this Court's decisions in State v. Bostick, 392 S.C. 134,\r\n708 S.E.2d 774 (2011), and State v. Odems, 395 S.C. 582, 720 S.E.2d 48 (2011),\r\ninvalidated the circumstantial evidence jury charge this Court articulated and\r\napproved in State v. Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 (1997), and State v.\r\nCherry, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2005). We disagree.\r\n\r\n   I.      Appellant's Claim\r\n\r\n      This Court's decisions in Bostick and Odems centered on whether the State\r\npresented substantial circumstantial evidence, so as to survive a directed verdict\r\nmotion, that the defendant committed the crime charged.\r\n\n       In Bostick, the fire department arrived at the victim's house on a Sunday\r\nafternoon after her house caught fire. 392 S.C. at 136, 708 S.E.2d at 775.\r\nFirefighters discovered the victim's body in the house. Id. Although the victim\r\nhad been struck in the head with a blunt force object, she ultimately expired as a\r\nresult of carbon monoxide poisoning from the fire. Id. Two days later,\r\ninvestigators discovered the following items in a burn pile at a neighboring house\r\nbelonging to Bostick's mother: two sets of car keys, toe nail clippers, pens, burned\r\npaper, a metal clasped ring of a purse, and a watch. Id. at 137, 708 S.E.2d at 775.\r\nAll of these items belonged to the victim. Id. Investigators later determined that\r\nthe person responsible for the fire at the victim's house used a heavy petroleum\r\nproduct, such as kerosene or diesel fuel. Id. Bostick's mother stated that she did\r\nnot use either of these products in the burn pile. Id. Investigators interviewed\r\nBostick, and asked for his clothing and shoes. Id. Blood was found on Bostick's\r\njeans, but a DNA analysis proved inconclusive. Id., 708 S.E.2d at 775–76 (\"[T]he\r\nagent who reviewed the DNA analysis findings . . . testified that while ninety-nine\r\npercent of the population could be excluded as contributing to the sample, she was\r\nunable to determine whether the blood sample actually came from [the victim].\").\r\nHowever, a chemical analysis of Bostick's shoes revealed a fresh gasoline pattern.\r\nId., 708 S.E.2d at 776. Bostick moved for a directed verdict at the close of the\r\nState's case, which the trial court denied. Id.\r\n\r\n       Bostick argued on appeal that the evidence submitted did not constitute\r\nsubstantial circumstantial evidence necessary to submit the case to the jury. Id. at\r\n138–39, 708 S.E.2d at 776. This Court agreed, and found that the State's evidence\r\nraised only a suspicion of Bostick's guilt. Id. at 141, 708 S.E.2d at 778.\r\n\r\n       In Odems, this Court addressed the same substantial circumstantial evidence\r\nissue. In that case, the defendant appealed his convictions for first degree burglary,\r\ngrand larceny, criminal conspiracy, and malicious injury. Odems, 395 S.C. at 585,\r\n720 S.E.2d at 50. At trial, the State relied solely on three pieces of circumstantial\r\nevidence: (1) the fact that less than ninety minutes after the burglary, police located\r\nthe defendant in the get-away vehicle with the burglars and the stolen goods; (2)\r\nthe defendant fled from law enforcement; and (3) the defendant asked an\r\nuninvolved person to lie to authorities on his behalf. Id. at 588, 720 S.E.2d at 51.\r\nThis Court found that even when viewed in the light most favorable to the State,\r\nthe circumstantial evidence did not reasonably tend to prove the defendant's guilt.\r\nId. The Court illustrated this point through an analogy to what is commonly\r\nreferred to as the \"traditional\" circumstantial evidence jury charge:\r\n\n      The traditional circumstantial evidence definition illustrates the\r\n      deficiency in the State's evidence against [the defendant]. This\r\n      definition provided that if the State relies on circumstantial evidence\r\n      to prove its case, the jury may not convict the defendant unless:\r\n\r\n             Every circumstance relied upon by the State be proven\r\n             beyond a reasonable doubt; and . . . all of the\r\n             circumstances proven be consistent with each other and\r\n             taken together, point conclusively to the guilt of the\r\n             accused to the exclusion of every other reasonable\r\n             hypothesis. Despite the Court's abandonment of the use\r\n             of this particular definition as a jury charge in State v.\r\n             Cherry, the definition illustrates the lack of evidence\r\n             against [the defendant]. The State's key circumstantial\r\n             evidence: (1) [The defendant's] location in the getaway\r\n             car a relatively short time after the robbery; (2) [The\r\n             defendant's] flight from law enforcement; and (3) [The\r\n             defendant's] attempt to enlist the assistance of an\r\n             uninvolved individual, do not point to his guilt for the\r\n             crimes charged to the exclusion of every other reasonable\r\n             hypothesis—namely, the notion that he did in fact join\r\n             [the defendants] at a gas station following the crime.\r\n\r\nId. at 590–91, 720 S.E.2d at 52–53 (citing State v. Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620, 626 n.\r\n2, 677 S.E.2d 603, 606 n. 2 (2009); State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 274–76, 379\r\nS.E.2d 888, 889 (1989), abrogated by Cherry, 361 S.C. at 595–606, 606 S.E.2d at\r\n478–82).\r\n\r\n       Both Bostick and Odems analyzed the standard relied on by the trial court in\r\nassessing circumstantial evidence, and not the standard relied on by jurors as is the\r\nissue sub judice. See, e.g., State v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 328, 89 S.E.2d 924,\r\n926 (\"It must be remembered, too, that there is one test by which circumstantial\r\nevidence is to be measured by the jury in its deliberations, and quite another by\r\nwhich it is to be measured by the trial judge in . . . consideration of the accused's\r\nmotion for a directed verdict.\"). Additionally, neither Bostick or Odems addresses\r\nthe Grippon charge's validity. See Bostick, 392 S.C. at 142, 708 S.E.2d at 778\r\n(\"The evidence presented by the State raised, at most, a mere suspicion that\r\nBostick committed this crime. Under settled principles, the trial court should grant\r\na directed verdict motion when the evidence presented merely raises a suspicion of\r\nguilt.\" (citation omitted)). In point of fact, the Odems opinion notes explicitly that\r\n\nthis Court abandoned the traditional circumstantial evidence charge, and that the\r\nCourt referred to the charge merely as an illustration of the \"deficiency in the\r\nState's evidence\" against the defendant in that case. See Odems, 395 S.C. at 592,\r\n720 S.E.2d at 53 (\"The State asks this Court to uphold [the defendant's]\r\nconvictions based on evidence which does not satisfy the standard adopted by this\r\nCourt regarding the proof necessary in a circumstantial evidence case.\" (citing\r\nBostick, supra, identifying fundamental opinions analyzing the circumstantial\r\nevidence standard)).7\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, the trial court did not err in providing a circumstantial\r\nevidence charge consistent with Grippon.8\r\n\r\n7 See also Hernandez, 382 S.C. at 625 n.2, 677 S.E.2d at 605–06 n.2 (\"Although in\r\nState v. Cherry . . . the Court abandoned [the traditional circumstantial evidence]\r\ncharge and held that it may confuse a jury by leading it to believe that the standard\r\nfor measuring circumstantial evidence is different from that for measuring direct\r\nevidence, it nonetheless illustrates the lack of evidence against Petitioners.\"\r\n(emphasis added)).\r\n8 Additionally, erroneous jury instructions are subject to a harmless error analysis.\r\nState v. Belcher, 385 S.C. 597, 611, 685 S.E.2d 802, 809 (2009). Jury instructions\r\nshould be considered as a whole, and if as a whole, they are free from error, any\r\nisolated portions which may be misleading do not constitute reversible error. State\r\nv. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 27, 538 S.E.2d 248, 251 (2000). A trial court's decision\r\nregarding jury charges will not be reversed where the charges, as a whole, properly\r\ncharged the law to be applied. State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 263, 565 S.E.2d\r\n298, 304 (2002).\r\n\r\n      In the instant case, the trial court clearly instructed the jury regarding the\r\nreasonable doubt burden of proof, explaining:\r\n\r\n      Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly\r\n      convinced of the defendant's guilt. There are very few things in this\r\n      world that we know with absolute certainty, and in criminal cases, the\r\n      law does not require proof that overcomes every possible doubt. If,\r\n      based on your consideration of the evidence you are firmly convinced\r\n      that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged, then you must find\r\n      the defendant guilty. If, on the other hand, you think there is a real\r\n      possibility that the defendant is not guilty, then you must give the\r\n      defendant the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty . . . . You\r\n\n   II.      The Circumstantial Evidence Charge\r\n\r\n      The objection raised by Appellant's trial counsel provides this Court with an\r\nopportunity to revisit our past discussions regarding the circumstantial evidence\r\ncharge, and articulate for the benefit of the bench and bar a circumstantial evidence\r\ncharge reflecting the proper balance between the State's burden and the jury's\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n       This Court's circumstantial evidence jurisprudence centers primarily on the\r\ndistinctions between direct and circumstantial evidence. Beginning with State v.\r\nLittlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d 924 (1955), this Court recognized that the\r\njury's evaluation of circumstantial evidence requires a particular and discrete\r\ninstruction. In Littlejohn, the Court explained,\r\n\r\n         [I]t is necessary that every circumstance relied upon by the state be\r\n         proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and that all of the circumstances\r\n         so proven be consistent with each other and, taken together, point\r\n         conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion of every other\r\n         reasonable hypothesis. It is not sufficient that they create a\r\n         probability, though a strong one; and if, assuming them to be true,\r\n         they may be accounted for upon any reasonable hypothesis which\r\n         does not include the guilt of the accused, the proof has failed.\r\n\r\nId. (citing State v. Kimbrell, 191 S.C. 238, 242, 4 S.E.2d 121, 122 (1939)); see\r\nEdwards, 298 S.C. at 275, 379 S.E.2d at 889 (clarifying the proper standard trial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         should weigh all the evidence in this case, and, after weighing the\r\n         testimony, if you are not convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a\r\n         reasonable doubt, you must find the defendant not guilty . . . . The\r\n         burden of proof remains on the state to prove guilt beyond a\r\n         reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nThe trial court's jury instruction, as a whole, properly conveyed the applicable law.\r\nState v. Rye, 375 S.C. 119, 123, 651 S.E.2d 321, 323 (2007); Aleksey, 343 S.C. at\r\n27, 538 S.E.2d at 251. Thus, any conceivable error was harmless beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.\r\n\ncourts should utilize in ruling on directed verdict motions in circumstantial\r\nevidence cases),9 abrogated by Cherry, 361 S.C. at 601–02, 606 S.E.2d at 482.\r\n\r\n       However, in Grippon, the majority of the Court determined that once a trial\r\ncourt provides a proper reasonable doubt instruction, the jury need not be\r\ninstructed regarding whether the circumstantial evidence proved the defendant's\r\nguilt to the exclusion of every reasonable hypothesis other than guilt. Grippon,\r\n327 S.C. at 83–84, 489 S.E.2d at 464 (relying on Holland v. United States, 348\r\nU.S. 121, 140 (1954); United States v. Russell, 971 F.2d 1098, 1108–09 (4th Cir.\r\n1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1066 (1993)).10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9Edwards v. South Carolina, 493 U.S. 895 (1989) (denying petition for writ of\r\ncertiorari to this Court).\r\n10Several courts have followed the Supreme Court's reasoning and found a distinct\r\ncircumstantial evidence charge unnecessary. See, e.g., Russell, 971 F.2d at 1109\r\n(\"It is well settled that as long as a proper reasonable doubt instruction is given, a\r\njury need not be instructed that circumstantial evidence must be so strong as to\r\nexclude every reasonable hypothesis other than guilt.\"); Hebron v. Maryland, 627\r\nA.2d 1029, 1031–37 (Md. 1993) (holding that the proposition that a conviction\r\nbased solely on circumstantial evidence cannot stand unless the circumstances are\r\ninconsistent with any reasonably hypothesis of innocence is a matter of the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence, rather than jury instruction); North Carolina v.\r\nAdcock, 310 S.E.2d 587, 607 (N.C. 1983) (\"We hold that an instruction on\r\ncircumstantial evidence to the effect that a conviction may not be based upon it\r\nunless the circumstances point to guilt and exclude to moral certainty every\r\nreasonable hypothesis except that of guilt is unnecessary when a correct instruction\r\non reasonable doubt is given.\"); but see Mainor v. Georgia, 387 S.E.2d 882, 884\r\nn.2 (Ga. 1990) (holding the trial court did not err in providing a circumstantial\r\nevidence jury charge providing that circumstantial evidence must be \"entirely\r\nconsistent with the defendant's guilt\"); Brown v. Virginia, 381 S.E.2d 225, 229–30\r\n(Va. 1989) (explaining that the circumstances contemplated by the traditional\r\ncircumstantial evidence charge are those proved and consistent with each other and\r\nthe defendant's guilt); West Virginia v. Bratcher, 206 S.E.2d 408, 410 (W. Va.\r\n1974) (holding the trial court erred in refusing to provide a circumstantial evidence\r\ncharge and citing with approval precedent relying on the traditional circumstantial\r\nevidence charge).\r\n\n       Thus, the Court recommended that following a proper reasonable doubt\r\ninstruction, the trial court instruct the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n      There are two types of evidence which are generally presented during\r\n      a trial—direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. Direct evidence\r\n      is the testimony of a person who asserts or claims to have actual\r\n      knowledge of a fact, such as an eyewitness. Circumstantial evidence\r\n      is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances indicating the existence\r\n      of a fact. The law makes absolutely no distinction between the weight\r\n      or value to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence. Nor is\r\n      a greater degree of certainty required of circumstantial evidence than\r\n      of direct evidence. You should weigh all the evidence in the case.\r\n      After weighing all the evidence, if you are not convinced of the guilt\r\n      of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find [the\r\n      defendant] not guilty.\r\n\r\nId. at 83–84, 489 S.E.2d at 464 (citing 1 E. Devitt & C. Blackmar, Federal Jury\r\nPractice and Instructions § 12.04 (4th ed. 1992)).\r\n\r\n       Following Grippon, South Carolina trial courts utilized both the traditional\r\ncircumstantial evidence charge and the Grippon charge.11 However, in Cherry,\r\nthis Court held that the traditional circumstantial evidence charge served to confuse\r\njuries by leading them to erroneously believe that the standard for measuring\r\ncircumstantial evidence is different than that for measuring direct evidence.\r\nCherry, 361 S.C. at 601, 606 S.E.2d at 482. Thus, the Court held the Grippon\r\nlanguage as \"the sole and exclusive charge to be given in circumstantial evidence\r\ncases in this state, along with a proper reasonable doubt instruction.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, Appellant's trial counsel objected to the trial court's\r\nproposed use of the Grippon charge, specifically, that portion of the charge\r\ninstructing that \"the law makes absolutely no distinction between the weight or\r\nvalue to be given either direct or circumstantial evidence.\" According to trial\r\ncounsel, that proposition was \"no longer valid.\"\r\n\r\n11 Following Grippon, several of the Court's opinions appeared to retain the\r\ntraditional circumstantial evidence charge as an alternative to the Grippon charge.\r\nSee State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 388, 548 S.E.2d 210, 212 (2001) (upholding\r\nhybrid of traditional and Grippon charges); State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 156 n.13,\r\n508 S.E.2d 857, 868 n.13 (1998) (noting there are two appropriate ways to charge\r\ncircumstantial evidence).\r\n\n      But, as observed in Grippon, the question is not whether circumstantial\r\nevidence carries the same probative weight as direct evidence, it clearly does.\r\nInstead, the pertinent inquiry is the proper means for evaluating circumstantial\r\nevidence and how the trial court may best instruct a jury as to its analytical\r\nresponsibility. Grippon, 327 S.C. at 88, 489 S.E.2d at 466–67 (Toal, J.\r\nconcurring). While direct and circumstantial evidence carry the same value, a jury\r\ncannot accurately analyze these two types of evidence using identical approaches.\r\n\r\n       Unlike direct evidence, evaluation of circumstantial evidence requires jurors\r\nto find that the proponent of the evidence has connected collateral facts in order to\r\nprove the proposition propounded—a process not required when evaluating direct\r\nevidence. Cherry, 361 S.C. at 603, 606 S.E.2d at 483 (Toal, C.J. dissenting); cf.\r\n31A C.J.S. Evidence § 5 (2008) (\"Direct evidence is evidence that proves the fact\r\nin dispute without inference or presumption.\"). Analysis of circumstantial\r\nevidence is plainly a more intellectual process. Grippon, 327 S.C. at 87–88, 489\r\nS.E.2d at 466 (citing Irene Rosenberg & Yale Rosenberg, \"Perhaps What Ye Say Is\r\nBased Only On Conjecture\"—Circumstantial Evidence, Then and Now, 31 Hous.\r\nL. Rev., 1371, 1412–13 (1995)). We have previously observed that this process\r\nrequires two steps: \"After concluding that a particular fact is true, the individual\r\njuror is called upon to ask: First, can I infer guilt from that fact? Second, if so, is\r\nthere any reasonable explanation other than guilt?\" Id. at 87–88, 489 S.E.2d at\r\n466. However, requiring a jury to inquire as to whether there is any other\r\nreasonable explanation other than the defendant's guilt comes perilously close to\r\nshifting the burden of proof from the State to the defendant. See, e.g., State v.\r\nAleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 26, 538 S.E.2d 248, 251 (2000) (\"Jury instructions on\r\nreasonable doubt which charge the jury to \"seek the truth\" are disfavored because\r\nthey '[run] the risk of unconstitutionally shifting the burden of proof to a\r\ndefendant.'\"). Therefore, the circumstantial evidence instruction is best\r\ncharacterized as a construct requiring the State to prove its case beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt, while at the same time providing a framework for a \"rational\"\r\nand \"cumulative\" assessment for guiding the jury's consideration of circumstantial\r\nevidence. See Grippon, 327 S.C. at 87–88, 489 S.E.2d at 466 (citing Rosenberg,\r\n31 Hous. L. Rev. at 1412–13).12\r\n\r\n\r\n12For example, in Cherry, the State relied on the following evidence to prove that\r\nthe defendant's guilt for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine:\r\n(1) the defendant's presence in a vehicle located in a high crime area known for\r\ndrugs; and (2) police recovered eight rocks of crack cocaine and $322.00,\r\nconsisting primarily of $20 bills. Cherry, 361 S.C. at 604, 606 S.E.2d at 483. The\r\n\n       Trial courts should not be constrained from providing a jury charge\r\nencompassing the determinations critical for analyzing circumstantial evidence as\r\nit appears in some cases. Additionally, defendants should not be restricted from\r\nrequesting a jury charge that reflects the requisite connection of collateral facts\r\nnecessary for a conviction. Thus, we hold that trial courts should provide the\r\nfollowing language as a circumstantial evidence charge, in addition to a proper\r\nreasonable doubt instruction, when so requested by a defendant:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndissent noted that although it is inferable that the defendant intended to distribute\r\ncrack cocaine, it is equally inferable that he did not:\r\n\r\n      Possessing drugs in a high crime area \"known for drugs\" does not\r\n      automatically make one a drug dealer. It is also reasonable that $322\r\n      in cash would be comprised of mostly [$20] bills. Moreover, it is\r\n      reasonable to conclude that because [the defendant] did not have the\r\n      requisite amount of crack cocaine on him to give rise to a permissive\r\n      inference of distribution, he did not intend to distribute crack cocaine.\r\n      Finally, that there were no drug paraphernalia in the car may or may\r\n      not establish that [the defendant] was carrying the crack for his\r\n      personal use.\r\n\r\nId. (Toal, C.J., dissenting). Thus, the dissent argued, the lack of direct evidence\r\nnecessitated a more detailed framework for the jury's assessment:\r\n\r\n      In sum, there is no direct evidence that [the defendant] intended to\r\n      distribute crack cocaine. Therefore, even if each circumstance were\r\n      proven beyond a reasonable doubt, jurors must still ask themselves,\r\n      under the Edwards charge, whether there is any other reasonable\r\n      conclusion other than guilt. Without this instruction, the jury does not\r\n      know that this critical step in the reasoning process exists. In fact, the\r\n      jury is without an analytical framework in which to evaluate the\r\n      evidence. That the circumstances could lead a juror to make\r\n      reasonable inferences either way highlights the importance of\r\n      retaining the Edwards charge.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\n      There are two types of evidence which are generally presented during a\r\n      trial—direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. Direct evidence directly\r\n      proves the existence of a fact and does not require deduction. Circumstantial\r\n      evidence is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances indicating the\r\n      existence of a fact.\r\n\r\n      Crimes may be proven by circumstantial evidence. The law makes no\r\n      distinction between the weight or value to be given to either direct or\r\n      circumstantial evidence, however, to the extent the State relies on\r\n      circumstantial evidence, all of the circumstances must be consistent\r\n      with each other, and when taken together, point conclusively to the\r\n      guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. If these\r\n      circumstances merely portray the defendant's behavior as suspicious,\r\n      the proof has failed.\r\n\r\n      The State has the burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a\r\n      reasonable doubt. This burden rests with the State regardless of\r\n      whether the State relies on direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or\r\n      some combination of the two.\r\n\r\nCf. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. at 328, 89 S.E.2d at 926 (explaining the traditional\r\ncircumstantial evidence charge); Grippon, 327 S.C. at 83–84, 489 S.E.2d at 463–\r\n64 (finding a circumstantial evidence jury instruction including \"reasonable\r\nhypothesis\" language unnecessary); Cherry, 361 S.C. at 600–02, 606 S.E.2d at\r\n481–82 (holding the Grippon charge as the exclusive charge for circumstantial\r\nevidence cases). This holding does not prevent the trial court from issuing the\r\ncircumstantial evidence charge provided in Grippon and Cherry. However, trial\r\ncourts may not exclusively rely on that charge over a defendant's objection.\r\n\r\n       Our Grippon and Cherry decisions commendably sought to remove\r\nconfusion from the jury's consideration regarding the weight and value afforded to\r\ncircumstantial evidence. However, at times, a separate framework is necessary to\r\nthe jury's analysis of circumstantial evidence. Thus, we modify Grippon and\r\nCherry to allow the additional language provided above if requested by a\r\ndefendant.\r\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Appellant's conviction is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, J. and BEATTY, J., concur.

State v. Provet, 391 S.C.\r\n494, 706 S.E.2d 513 (Ct. App. 2011). On certiorari, petitioner argues the Court of\r\nAppeals erred when it affirmed the trial court's determination that reasonable\r\nsuspicion existed to justify extension of a traffic stop and that petitioner voluntarily\r\nconsented to the search of his vehicle. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                                       FACTS\r\nCorporal John Owens (Officer) is a 14-year veteran of the South Carolina Highway\r\nPatrol and 4-year veteran and supervisor of the upstate Aggressive Criminal\r\nEnforcement unit that targets drug trafficking and other serious crimes utilizing\r\nhighway transportation. One evening in May 2002, while patrolling Interstate 85\r\nin Greenville County, he stopped petitioner's vehicle for following another vehicle\r\ntoo closely and driving with a burned out tag light. He approached and asked\r\npetitioner for his driver's license and vehicle registration.\r\n\r\nOfficer testified that as petitioner produced those items, he observed that\r\npetitioner's hands were shaking excessively and his breathing was accelerated.\r\nUpon viewing the vehicle's registration, Officer discovered that the vehicle was\r\nregistered to a third party. He asked petitioner to step out of and to the rear of the\r\nvehicle. Officer performed a pat-down search which did not yield any weapons.\r\n\r\nAs Officer prepared a warning citation, he asked petitioner where he was coming\r\nfrom, and petitioner answered that he had been visiting his girlfriend at a nearby\r\nHoliday Inn. However, Officer had observed petitioner's vehicle approach and\r\npass the exit at which the only Holiday Inn in Greenville was located. Officer\r\nasked petitioner at what exit the Holiday Inn was located, and petitioner could not\r\nsay. Officer asked whether petitioner had gone to another location after leaving\r\nthe Holiday Inn, and petitioner denied having done so. In response to Officer's\r\nquestions, petitioner explained that the vehicle belonged to a different girlfriend\r\nthan the one he had been visiting in Greenville; that he had recently graduated\r\nfrom a technical college and did not yet have a job; and that he had been in\r\nGreenville for two days but without bringing luggage. Officer also testified that he\r\nobserved petitioner use delay tactics. Officer called for a canine drug detection\r\nunit. He then called dispatch to check on the status of petitioner's driver's license\r\nand the vehicle's registration.\r\n\nOfficer then approached petitioner's vehicle to check the vehicle identification\r\nnumber. While doing so, he observed several air fresheners and fast food bags, a\r\ncell phone, and some receipts, as well as a bag on the rear seat. The canine unit\r\narrived before Officer received the dispatcher's return call regarding the status of\r\npetitioner's license and registration. When the dispatcher reported no problems\r\nwith either of these items, Officer returned petitioner's license and registration and\r\nissued him a traffic warning citation.\r\n\r\nOfficer then asked for permission to search the vehicle, and petitioner assented.\r\nThe officer handling the drug detection canine began preparing for the search. As\r\nhe did so, petitioner fled the scene on foot but was apprehended. The drug\r\ndetection canine alerted on the fast food bag, in which officers discovered a\r\nsubstance that field tested positive for and was later confirmed to be cocaine.\r\n\r\nPetitioner moved to suppress the cocaine because it was obtained as a result of an\r\nillegal search. The trial court denied the motion. It found that the purpose of the\r\ntraffic stop was complete when Officer asked for permission to search the vehicle,\r\nso that two detentions existed for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. It found the\r\nsecond detention justified by Officer's reasonable suspicion that petitioner was\r\ninvolved in criminal activity and found that petitioner voluntarily consented to the\r\nsearch of the vehicle. The jury returned a guilty verdict on charges of drug\r\ntrafficking and resisting arrest, and the trial court sentenced petitioner to twenty-\r\nfive years' imprisonment. The Court of Appeals affirmed. This Court granted\r\ncertiorari. We now affirm the Court of Appeals, and clarify that off-topic\r\nquestioning by a law enforcement officer during the course of a traffic stop does\r\nnot constitute a separate seizure for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, so long as\r\nthe off-topic questioning does not measurably extend the duration of the stop.\r\n\r\n                                       ISSUES\r\n\r\n   1. Did the Court of Appeals err when it affirmed the trial court's finding the\r\n      officer had reasonable suspicion to seize petitioner after the conclusion of a\r\n      lawful traffic stop?\r\n   2. Did the Court of Appeals err when it affirmed the trial court's finding that\r\n      petitioner voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle?\r\n\n                                     ANALYSIS \n\r\n\r\nI. Lawfulness of seizure\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends the Court of Appeals erred when it affirmed the trial court's\r\nfinding that the traffic stop was not unreasonably prolonged and that Officer had\r\nreasonable suspicion to further detain petitioner. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina appellate courts review Fourth Amendment determinations under a\r\nclear error standard. See State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 64-66, 528 S.E.2d 661,\r\n664-66 (2000). We affirm if there is any evidence to support the trial court's\r\nruling. Id. at 66, 528 S.E.2d at 666.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable\r\nsearches and seizures. A police officer may \"stop and briefly detain a person for\r\ninvestigative purposes\" if he \"has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable\r\nfacts that criminal activity 'may be afoot' . . . .\" United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S.\r\n1, 7 (1989). The test whether reasonable suspicion exists is an objective\r\nassessment of the circumstances; the officer's subjective motivations are irrelevant.\r\nSee Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33, 38 (1996) (\"[T]he fact that an officer does not\r\nhave the state of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons which provide the\r\nlegal justification for the officer's action does not invalidate the action taken as\r\nlong as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action. Subjective\r\nintentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.\"\r\n(quoting Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996) (internal brackets,\r\nellipsis, and quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\nViolation of motor vehicle codes provides an officer reasonable suspicion to\r\ninitiate a traffic stop. See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 109 (1977). A\r\ntraffic stop supported by reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation remains valid\r\nuntil the purpose of the traffic stop has been completed. Arizona v. Johnson, 555\r\nU.S. 323, 333 (2009). The officer may not extend the duration of a traffic stop in\r\norder to question the motorist on unrelated matters unless he possesses reasonable\r\nsuspicion that warrants an additional seizure of the motorist. See United States v.\r\nSullivan, 138 F.3d 126, 131 (4th Cir. 1998). The officer cannot avoid this rule by\r\nemploying dilatory tactics. See United States v. Jones, 234 F.2d 234 (5th Cir.\r\n2000) (driver's Fourth Amendment rights violated when, after dispatcher reported\r\nno problems and officer had completed warning citation except for obtaining the\r\ndriver's signature, officer deliberately delayed completing the stop for several more\r\nminutes until canine search unit arrived).\r\n\nNotwithstanding that an officer may not lawfully extend the duration of a traffic\r\nstop in order to engage in off-topic questioning, this rule does not limit the scope\r\nof the officer's questions to the motorist during the traffic stop. As the United\r\nStates Supreme Court has recently emphasized, \"[a]n officer's inquiries into\r\nmatters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop, this Court has made plain,\r\ndo not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as\r\nthose inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.\" Johnson, 555\r\nU.S. at 333; see also Muehler v. Mena, 544 U.S. 93, 101 (2005) (\"As the Court of\r\nAppeals did not hold that the detention was prolonged by the questioning, there\r\nwas no additional seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Hence,\r\nthe officers did not need reasonable suspicion to ask Mena [while detained as an\r\noccupant of a house being searched pursuant to a warrant] for her name, date and\r\nplace of birth, or immigration status.\"); United States v. Everett, 601 F.3d 484,\r\n490-91 (6th Cir. 2010) (explaining that in Muehler v. Mena the Supreme Court\r\nresolved in the negative a circuit split on the question whether asking a motorist\r\nquestions unrelated to the circumstances justifying the traffic stop violated the\r\nFourth Amendment).\r\n\r\nThe officer's observations while conducting the traffic stop may create reasonable\r\nsuspicion to justify further search or seizure. See Mimms, 434 U.S. at 111-12\r\n(finding \"little question the officer was justified\" in conducting pat-down search\r\nafter officer asked motorist to exit vehicle and then observed bulge in motorists'\r\njacket).\r\n\r\n   a. Length of initial seizure\r\n\r\nThe trial court held that the initial seizure concluded when Officer issued petitioner\r\nthe warning citation and returned his license and registration. It held that the initial\r\nstop was concluded in a reasonable length of time. The Court of Appeals affirmed,\r\nreasoning that Officer's off-topic questions \"did not unreasonably extend the traffic\r\nstop.\" We agree with the trial court and the Court of Appeals that ten minutes was\r\na reasonable length of time for the initial traffic stop and that Officer's off-topic\r\nquestions did not measurably extend the duration of the stop. See Johnson, supra.\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues that because Officer had already indicated he intended to\r\nissue a warning ticket before he began the off-topic questioning, the\r\nquestions exceeded the scope of the traffic stop and so the seizure became\r\nunlawful, citing State v. Rivera, 384 S.C. 356, 682 S.E.2d 307 (Ct. App.\r\n2009). In its opinion below, the Court of Appeals distinguished Rivera on\r\nits facts, pointing out that in Rivera the trunk was filled with luggage and\r\n\nthere was no evidence of multiple air fresheners in the vehicle. It also noted\r\nthat the Rivera court reviewed the trial court's suppression of the evidence\r\nunder the deferential standard of review. We agree that Rivera is\r\ndistinguishable from the present case on both bases.\r\nWe also note, however, that Rivera contains some statements that are\r\nmisleading given the present state of Fourth Amendment law. The Rivera\r\ncourt reasoned that\r\n      [The officer's] initial questioning, including where Respondents were\r\n      coming from, how long they had been there, where they were going,\r\n      and the purpose of their trip, was reasonable in that the questions\r\n      tangentially related to the purpose of the traffic stop. Once [the\r\n      officer] informed [the driver] he would receive a warning citation,\r\n      however, the purpose of the stop ended and [the officer's] continued\r\n      questioning concerning the transport of drugs on the interstate\r\n      exceeded the scope of the stop. This amounted to a second and illegal\r\n      detention unless [the officer] entertained a reasonable suspicion of\r\n      illegal activity sufficient to warrant that detention.\r\n\r\nId. at 362, 682 S.E.2d at 310 (internal footnote omitted). This passage suggests\r\nthat police questioning must have some relationship to the purpose of the stop in\r\norder to withstand Fourth Amendment scrutiny. To the extent it does, it is\r\nincorrect. See Johnson, supra; Mena, supra. In addition, the Rivera court\r\nidentified the officer's statement that he would issue a warning citation to the driver\r\nas the point in time at which the purpose of the stop ended without citing dilatory\r\ntactics by the officer. To the extent Rivera suggests that shifting the conversation\r\nto another topic marks the end of the lawful seizure even though the citation has\r\nnot been issued, regardless whether such off-topic conversation measurably\r\nextends the duration of the initial seizure, it is also incorrect. See Jones, supra.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rules implied by Rivera may have been reasonable extrapolations\r\nfrom earlier Fourth Amendment precedents,1 they have now been clearly rejected\r\n\r\n1 See, for example, Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500 (1983) (\"The predicate\r\npermitting seizures on suspicion short of probable cause is that law enforcement\r\ninterests warrant a limited intrusion on the personal security of the suspect. The\r\nscope of the intrusion permitted will vary to some extent with the particular facts\r\nand circumstances of each case. This much, however, is clear: an investigative\r\ndetention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the\r\n\nby the United States Supreme Court. To the extent other South Carolina cases\r\ncontain similar language, we note that language has likewise been superseded.\r\n\r\nWe also note that the proper inquiry is not whether an officer \"unreasonably\"\r\nextended the duration of the traffic stop with his off-topic questions but whether he\r\n\"measurably\" extended it. See Johnson, supra. This is a temporal inquiry, not a\r\nreasonableness inquiry.\r\n\r\n   b. Reasonable suspicion\r\n\r\nPetitioner also argues that the Court of Appeals erred when it affirmed the trial\r\ncourt's finding that Officer had reasonable suspicion to detain petitioner in order to\r\nrequest to search his vehicle after the purpose of the traffic stop had been\r\ncompleted. We disagree.\r\n\r\nOfficer testified to petitioner's extreme nervousness evidenced by shaking hands\r\nand accelerated breathing. He testified that, based on his experience with other\r\nmotorists, petitioner's nervousness was excessive as compared with people pulled\r\nover who are not involved in criminal activities other than traffic-related\r\ninfractions. He saw that petitioner's vehicle was registered to a third party, and\r\npetitioner's claims regarding his stay at the Greenville Holiday Inn and subsequent\r\nmovements appeared to contradict Officer's direct observations. Petitioner also\r\nclaimed to be unemployed yet appeared able to afford to stay at a hotel and buy\r\nlarge quantities of gas to drive a large vehicle. Officer also observed numerous air\r\nfresheners in the vehicle, which indicated to him a possibility that petitioner was\r\nseeking to mask odors from a police officer or canine drug detection unit. He also\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose of the stop. Similarly, the investigative methods employed should be the\r\nleast intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officer's suspicion\r\nin a short period of time.\" (emphasis added)). The United States Supreme Court\r\ndirectly addressed the import of Royer's reference to least intrusive means a few\r\nyears later, in United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 11 (1989), explaining,\r\n      That statement . . . was directed at the length of the investigative stop,\r\n      not at whether the police had a less intrusive means to verify their\r\n      suspicions . . . . The reasonableness of the officer's decision to stop a\r\n      suspect does not turn on the availability of less intrusive investigatory\r\n      techniques. Such a rule would unduly hamper the police's ability to\r\n      make swift, on-the-spot decisions . . . and it would require courts to\r\n      indulge in unrealistic second-guessing.\r\n\nbelieved that the numerous fast food bags, receipts, and cell phone he observed in\r\nthe vehicle were consistent with the tight schedule maintained by drug traffickers.\r\nAlthough on his second trip to the vehicle he observed a bag on the rear seat that\r\ncould have been a luggage bag, petitioner had claimed he did not have luggage\r\nwith him despite having stayed in Greenville for two days. Officer also testified he\r\nobserved petitioner use delay tactics. Based on Officer's experience with drug\r\ntrafficking interdiction, he suspected petitioner was involved in drug trafficking\r\nactivity. We agree with the trial court and the Court of Appeals that Officer had a\r\nreasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity was afoot,\r\njustifying a second seizure. Moreover, because the record contains evidence that\r\nsupports the trial court's finding, under our deferential standard of review we must\r\naffirm its finding.\r\n\r\nPetitioner points out several factors that he contends were indicative of innocent\r\ntravel: the address petitioner gave for his girlfriend was confirmed as a valid\r\naddress; petitioner had no arrest record; and no negative information about the\r\nvehicle or petitioner was reported by the dispatcher. While we agree these facts\r\ncould be found to weigh against Officer's reasonable suspicion, that determination\r\nwas for the trial court, and we must affirm when any evidence in the record\r\nsupports its finding. Brockman, supra.\r\n\r\nPetitioner also argues that the Court of Appeals improperly distinguished State v.\r\nTindall, 388 S.C. 518, 698 S.E.2d 203 (2010). We agree with the Court of\r\nAppeals' analysis in the opinion below that the totality of the circumstances in this\r\ncase provides more objective, articulable facts to justify Officer's suspicion than\r\nwere present in Tindall.\r\n\r\nPetitioner further argues the entire process was tainted by Officer's mental\r\ndetermination at an early point in the traffic stop not to let petitioner go, citing\r\nUnited States v. Foster, 634 F.3d 243, 249 (4th Cir. 2011). Foster is inapposite,\r\nbecause in that case the court concluded that objective grounds for reasonable\r\nsuspicion did not exist. Only after determining that the objective test was not met\r\ndid the Foster court proceed to a discussion of the government's abusive practices,\r\nrebuking its \"attempt[] to spin these largely mundane acts into a web of deception\"\r\nand its \"post hoc rationalizations to validate those seizures that happen to turn up\r\ncontraband\" as well as the officer's state of mind. Id. at 249. The Foster court's\r\ncomment that \"although the reasonable suspicion standard is an objective test, [the\r\nofficer's] initial comments to [the arrestee], 'Knowing you, you are up to\r\nsomething,' clearly belie his stated reasons for initiating the stop[,]\" id., was not\r\nnecessary to its decision and did not announce a new rule.\r\n\nIn any case, the proposition that the officer's subjective determinations could taint\r\nan objectively valid seizure has been expressly rejected by the United States\r\nSupreme Court. Robinette, supra.\r\n\r\nII. Consent to search\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred when it affirmed the trial court's\r\nfinding that petitioner voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nWe apply a deferential standard of review to the trial court's findings on issues of\r\nfact regarding the voluntariness of consent. State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 584-\r\n85, 575 S.E.2d 852 (2003).\r\n\r\nA warrantless search is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\r\nwhen voluntary consent is given for the search. Palacio v. State, 333 S.C. 506,\r\n514, 511 S.E.2d 62, 66 (1999). The existence of voluntary consent is determined\r\nfrom the totality of the circumstances. Id. When the defendant disputes the\r\nvoluntariness of his consent, the burden is on the State to prove the consent was\r\nvoluntary. Id. \"A consent to search procured during an unlawful stop is invalid\r\nunless such consent is both voluntary and not an exploitation of the unlawful stop.\"\r\nState v. Robinson, 306 S.C. 399, 402, 412 S.E.2d 411, 414 (1991) (emphasis in\r\noriginal).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the trial court determined that petitioner's consent was voluntary\r\nbecause Officer had returned his driver's license and vehicle registration and had\r\nissued the warning citation. It also found no show of force constrained petitioner,\r\nsince only two officers were present, the drug detection canine was confined in the\r\nunmarked police vehicle, no guns were pointed, and no threatening tone was used.\r\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude the record supports the\r\ntrial court's finding that petitioner voluntarily consented to the search.\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals failed to recognize that the facts of State v.\r\nPichardo, 367 S.C. 84, 623 S.E.2d 840 (Ct. App. 2005), are analogous to those of\r\nthis case and that Pichardo mandates a different result. We disagree. In Pichardo,\r\nthe officer completed the purpose of the traffic stop, returning the driver's and\r\npassenger's paperwork, telling them to have a good day, and turning away, before\r\nturning around again and asking to speak with them further. 367 S.C. at 92-93,\r\n623 S.E.2d at 845. The officer then explained that the interstate was being used for\r\ntrafficking of contraband and weapons and asked for consent to search the vehicle.\r\nId. at 93, 623 S.E.2d at 845. The trial court suppressed the evidence obtained\r\n\nduring the search, finding that the officer's questioning of the two men constituted\r\na seizure rather than a consensual encounter and no reasonable suspicion existed to\r\nwarrant it. Id. at 103-104, 623 S.E.2d at 850-51.\r\n\r\nPichardo is inapposite because it deals with consent obtained during an unlawful\r\nrather than a lawful seizure. Thus, in Pichardo the State was required to make a\r\nhigher showing: that the consent was both voluntary and not an exploitation of the\r\nunlawful seizure. Robinson, supra. In this case, the trial court found Officer had\r\nreasonable suspicion for an additional seizure, and a higher showing is not\r\nrequired. Moreover, in Pichardo the trial court found the consent not voluntary,\r\nwhile the trial court in this case found the consent to be voluntary. The deferential\r\nstandard of review therefore favors affirmance of opposing results.\r\n\r\nPetitioner's reliance on State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 571 S.E.2d 703 (Ct. App.\r\n2002), is misplaced for the same reasons. In that case the trial court found that the\r\nofficer lacked probable cause for an additional seizure and that the subsequent\r\nconsent was not voluntary. Thus, a higher showing was required in that case and\r\nthe standard of review favored rather than disfavored the result desired by the\r\ndefendant.                        CONCLUSION\r\nThe Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the trial court's findings that the traffic\r\nstop was not unlawfully extended, that Officer had reasonable suspicion for an\r\nadditional seizure, and that petitioner's consent to search the vehicle was voluntary.\r\nHowever, we clarify that off-topic questioning does not constitute a separate\r\nseizure for Fourth Amendment purposes so long as it does not measurably extend\r\nthe duration of a lawful traffic stop.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Lacour, III, of Clawson & Staubes, LLC, of\r\n            Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: This case arises from a construction dispute. The\r\ncontract between the general contractor and subcontractor provided for arbitration\r\npursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. When a complaint was filed, Appellant\r\nSean Barnes, the general contractor, and Appellant Wando E., the property owner,\r\nsought to enforce the construction contract's arbitration clause. The trial court\r\n\nrefused to compel arbitration on the basis that the contract did not sufficiently\r\nimpact interstate commerce. We find the trial court erred in finding the parties'\r\ntransaction had an insufficient nexus to interstate commerce and reverse.\r\n\r\n                                           I.\r\nAppellant Wando E., LLC, owns property along the Wando River in Berkeley\r\nCounty, South Carolina. Wando E. retained Appellant Sean Barnes to serve as the\r\ngeneral contractor for the construction of a marina. Barnes, in turn, hired\r\nRespondent Cape Romain as a subcontractor for the project. Barnes and Cape\r\nRomain entered into a standard form contract (the Contract) promulgated by the\r\nAmerican Institute of Architects.\r\n\r\nSection 5.1 of the Contract requires an affirmative election among various methods\r\nof dispute resolution. Parties must select arbitration, litigation in court, or \"other.\"\r\nBarnes and Cape Romain checked the box beside arbitration, selecting it as the\r\nbinding method of dispute resolution for any subsequent claim. Specifically,\r\narticle 21 of the Contract provides that all \"[c]laims, disputes and other matters in\r\nquestion arising out of or relating to this Contract\" shall be subject to arbitration.\r\nFurther, section 19.2 of the Contract expressly provides that if arbitration is\r\nselected as the method of dispute resolution, the Federal Arbitration Act1 (FAA)\r\nshall govern the arbitration process.\r\n\r\nSeveral months into construction, the project engineer refused to certify further\r\npayments, raising concerns about certain angled pilings and misaligned dock\r\nsections.2 Cape Romain insisted it had properly constructed the docks and\r\ncontended that any defects were the result of improperly manufactured\r\nprefabricated dock sections. Cape Romain demanded payment of $158,413.14 and\r\nfiled a mechanics' lien against the real property to secure that amount. Thereafter,\r\nCape Romain filed suit against Barnes and Wando E., seeking foreclosure of its\r\nmechanics' lien against Wando E. and alleging a breach of contract claim against\r\nBarnes.3\r\n\r\n\r\n1   9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (2012).\r\n2Pursuant to article 15 of the Contract, Cape Romain was not entitled to be paid\r\nuntil the project engineer certified the work was completed properly.\r\n3   Cape Romain also alleged a quantum meruit claim in the alternative against both\r\n\nAppellants moved to dismiss and compel arbitration, arguing that because all of the\r\nclaims relate to Cape Romain's performance under the Contract, the claims should\r\nbe arbitrated. Cape Romain opposed dismissal and arbitration, arguing Wando E.\r\nwas not a party to the Contract and, thus, may not compel arbitration and that the\r\narbitration clause is not enforceable under the FAA because the transaction did not\r\nimpact interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nThe trial court refused to dismiss the lawsuit or compel arbitration of any claim,\r\nfinding performance of the Contract did not involve a sufficient impact on\r\ninterstate commerce to \"justify or trigger\" application of the FAA. Further, the\r\ntrial court found Wando E. could not enforce the arbitration agreement absent a\r\nshowing of some special relationship to a contracting party. Appellants appealed,\r\nand the case was certified to this Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefendants.\r\n4 We summarily reject Cape Romain's contention that this matter is not\r\nimmediately appealable. An order denying arbitration is immediately appealable.\r\nTowles v. United HealthCare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 34-35, 524 S.E.2d 839, 842 (Ct.\r\nAp. 1999) (noting section 16 of the FAA explicitly provides for an appeal from an\r\norder denying a motion to compel arbitration and holding that \"'an order that favors\r\nlitigation over arbitration—whether it refuses to stay the litigation in deference to\r\narbitration; [or] refuses to compel arbitration . . . is immediately appealable, even\r\nif interlocutory.'\" (quoting Stedor Enters., Ltd. v. Armtex, Inc., 947 F.2d 727, 730\r\n(4th Cir. 1991))). Regardless of how the motion was styled or captioned,\r\nAppellants requested only that arbitration be compelled. Focusing, as we must, on\r\nsubstance rather than nomenclature, because Appellants sought only the precise\r\nrelief afforded under the FAA, we find the trial court's refusal to compel arbitration\r\nis immediately appealable. See Rota-McLarty v. Santander Consumer USA, Inc.,\r\n700 F.3d 690, 698 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing Wheeling Hosp., Inc. v. Health Plan of\r\nthe Upper Ohio Valley, Inc., 683 F.3d 577, 586 (4th Cir. 2012)) (noting that \"the\r\nproper inquiry focuses on substance rather than nomenclature\" and instructing\r\ncourts to \"look to whether a motion evidences a clear intention to seek enforcement\r\nof an arbitration clause rather than [to] whether it adhered to a specific form or\r\nexplicitly referenced §§ 3 or 4 [of the FAA]\"); see also S.C. Code § 15-48-\r\n200(a)(1) (providing for an appeal from an order denying an application to compel\r\narbitration).\r\n\n                                          II. \n\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in finding the arbitration provisions of the\r\nContract cannot be enforced because the parties' transaction did not involve\r\ninterstate commerce. We agree.\r\n\r\nWe find arbitration pursuant to the FAA is proper because the underlying marina\r\nconstruction transaction falls within the purview of Congress's commerce power.\r\n\"Generally, any arbitration agreement affecting interstate commerce . . . is subject\r\nto the FAA.\" Landers v. Federal Deposit Ins. Co., 402 S.C. 100, 108, 739 S.E.2d\r\n209, 213 (2013) (citing Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105 (2001)).\r\nThe United States Supreme Court \"has previously described the [FAA]'s reach\r\nexpansively as coinciding with that of the Commerce Clause.\" Allied-Bruce\r\nTerminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 274 (1995) (citing Perry v. Thomas, 482\r\nU.S. 483, 490 (1987)). Thus, in determining whether the FAA applies to a\r\nparticular arbitration agreement, a court considers whether the contract concerns a\r\ntransaction involving interstate commerce. Episcopal Housing Corp. v. Fed. Ins.\r\nCo., 269 S.C. 631, 637, 239 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1977).\r\n\r\nUnder the reach of the Commerce Clause, \"Congress has authority to regulate (1)\r\n'the use of the channels of interstate commerce,' (2) 'the instrumentalities of\r\ninterstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce . . .' and (3) 'those\r\nactivities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.'\" United States v.\r\nGould, 568 F.3d 459, 470 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v. Morrison, 529\r\nU.S. 598, 609 (2000)). \"Channels of commerce are 'the interstate transportation\r\nroutes through which persons and goods move.'\" United States v. Ballinger, 395\r\nF.3d 1218, 1225 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Morrison, 529 U.S. at 613 n.5) (noting\r\nchannels of interstate commerce include highways, railroads, navigable waterways,\r\nairspace, telecommunications networks and even national securities markets).\r\n\"Instrumentalities of interstate commerce, by contrast, are the people and things\r\nthemselves moving in commerce . . . .\" Id. at 1226 (identifying automobiles,\r\nairplanes, boats, shipments of goods, pagers, telephones and mobile phones as\r\ninstrumentalities of interstate commerce).\r\n\r\nHere, despite noting the following facts, the trial court concluded the parties'\r\ntransaction did not involve interstate commerce: (1) that certain raw materials\r\nused in constructing the marina originated in Ohio; (2) that Cape Romain\r\ntransported the raw materials on its equipment and barges through the navigable\r\nwaterways of the Charleston Harbor and up the Wando River to the project site;\r\nand (3) that the marina was constructed in navigable waterways under a permit\r\n\nissued by the Army Corps of Engineers. In analyzing the interstate commerce\r\nquestion solely as whether the Contract on its face reflected a \"substantial relation\r\nto interstate commerce\" and in finding the FAA was not triggered, the trial court\r\nrelied upon Timms v. Greene5 and Matthews v. Fluor Corporation.6 This was\r\nerror, for the proper analysis involves consideration of all three broad categories of\r\nactivity within the purview of Congress's commerce power—use of the channels of\r\ninterstate commerce; regulation of persons, things or instrumentalities in interstate\r\ncommerce; and regulation of activities having a substantial relation to interstate\r\ncommerce. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 558-59 (1995). While the\r\ntransaction's effect on interstate commerce was by no means insubstantial, the\r\nparties' transaction plainly falls within the purview of Congress's commerce power\r\nas it extensively involves both the channels and the instrumentalities of interstate\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nWe initially observe that the materials used in constructing the dock were\r\ninstrumentalities of interstate commerce, as they were manufactured or fabricated\r\nin Ohio and transported to South Carolina to be used in constructing the marina. In\r\naddition, Cape Romain consulted with an out-of-state engineering and survey\r\ncompany in connection with the installation of the dock sections. This Court has\r\npreviously held that incorporating out-of-state materials and consulting with out-\r\n\r\n5 310 S.C. 469, 427 S.E.2d 642 (1993). We overrule Timms to the extent it\r\ndetermined the FAA did not apply because the contract on its face failed to\r\ndemonstrate that the parties contemplated an interstate transaction. See Muñoz v.\r\nGreen Tree Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 538-39, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363-64 (2001)\r\n(holding that although parties may not have contemplated an interstate transaction\r\nat the time of contract formation, if their contractual relationship in fact involves\r\ninterstate commerce, then the FAA nonetheless applies); see also Allied-Bruce,\r\n513 U.S. at 277-78 (rejecting the argument that the FAA applies only where the\r\nparties contemplated an interstate transaction and finding the FAA applies where\r\nan agreement that contains an arbitration provision, on the whole, evidences a\r\ntransaction that in fact affected interstate commerce); Zabinski v. Bright Acres\r\nAssocs., 346 S.C. 580, 591, 553 S.E.2d 110, 115 (2001) (\"The [United States]\r\nSupreme Court utilizes a 'commerce in fact' test to determine if the transaction\r\ninvolves interstate commerce for the FAA to apply.\").\r\n6312 S.C. 404, 440 S.E.2d 880 (1994), overruled by Muñoz, 343 S.C. at 539 n.3,\r\n542 S.E.2d at 363 n.3.\r\n\nof-state professionals in connection with a construction project are indicators of\r\ninterstate commerce. See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 594-95, 553 S.E.2d at 117-18\r\n(utilization of out-of-state materials, contractors and investors implicates interstate\r\ncommerce); Episcopal Housing, 269 S.C. at 640, 239 S.E.3d at 652 (use of labor,\r\nsupplies, and materials from out-of-state sources indicates interstate commerce);\r\nBlanton v. Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 540, 570 S.E.2d 565, 568 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n(finding consultation with out-of-state technicians is an indicator of interstate\r\ncommerce).\r\n\r\nRegarding channels of interstate commerce, as noted, the construction site is\r\nlocated on the Wando River—i.e., within a channel of interstate commerce—as\r\nevidenced by the need for the Army Corps of Engineers to issue a federal permit\r\nbefore construction could begin.7 Moreover, in performing its duties under the\r\nContract, Cape Romain used barges to transport materials and equipment through\r\nvarious navigable waterways and as construction platforms adjacent to the marina\r\nsite. Thus, the location of the construction site, the transportation of out-of-state\r\nmaterials through the channels of interstate commerce, and the use of barges and\r\nother instrumentalities of interstate commerce all support application of the FAA in\r\nthis instance. See United States v. Rands, 389 U.S. 121, 122-23 (1967) (\"The\r\npower to regulate commerce comprehends the control for that purpose, and to the\r\nextent necessary, of all the navigable waters of the United States.\"); Ballinger, 395\r\nF.3d at 1226 (noting that shipments of goods and boats themselves are\r\ninstrumentalities of interstate commerce); United States v. Deaton, 332 F.3d 698,\r\n706 (4th Cir. 2003) (\"The power over navigable waters is an aspect of the authority\r\nto regulate the channels of interstate commerce.\").\r\n\r\nEven if we were to view this case only through the third category of the federal\r\ncommerce power—regulation of activities having a substantial relation to interstate\r\ncommerce—the record demonstrates that the activities implicated in this marine\r\nconstruction project bear on interstate commerce in a way sufficiently substantial\r\nto invoke the FAA. See Citizens Bank v. Alafabco, Inc., 539 U.S. 52, 56-57 (2003)\r\n(quoting Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S.\r\n219, 236 (1948)) (\"Congress' Commerce Clause power 'may be exercised in\r\n7 The permit references federal regulations regarding the Department of the Army's\r\nregulatory authority over navigable waters and states the purpose of the project is\r\nto construct a marina to provide docking space for boats (instrumentalities of\r\ninterstate commerce) and access to navigable waters (channels of interstate\r\ncommerce).\r\n\nindividual cases without showing any specific effect upon interstate commerce' if\r\nin the aggregate the economic activity in question would represent ' a general\r\npractice . . . subject to federal control.' Only that general practice need bear on\r\ninterstate commerce in a substantial way.\"). Particularly when the commercial\r\naspects of this transaction are considered in the aggregate pursuant to Citizens\r\nBank v. Alafabco, it is clear the trial court erred in finding the FAA did not apply.\r\n\r\nBecause the transaction did involve interstate commerce, we turn to the question of\r\nwhether arbitration should be compelled under the Contract.\r\n\r\n\"Arbitration is contractual by nature . . . .\" Thomson-CSF, S.A. v. Am. Arbitration\r\nAss'n, 64 F.3d 773, 776 (2d Cir. 1995); see also Towles, 338 S.C.at 37, 524 S.E.2d\r\nat 843-44 (\"Arbitration is available only when the parties involved contractually\r\nagree to arbitrate.\"). \"'There is a strong presumption in favor of the validity of\r\narbitration agreements because of the strong policy favoring arbitration.'\" Bradley\r\nv. Brentwood Homes, Inc., 398 S.C. 447, 455, 730 S.E.2d 312, 316 (2012) (quoting\r\nTowles, 338 S.C. at 37, 524 S.E.2d at 844). \"This policy [favoring arbitration], as\r\ncontained within the Act, 'requires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to\r\narbitrate.'\" KPMG, LLP v. Cocchi, 132 S.Ct. 23, 25 (2011) (quoting Dean Witter\r\nReynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 217 (1985)); see also Zabinski, 346 S.C. at\r\n592, 553 S.E.2d at 116 (\"'The FAA simply requires courts to enforce privately\r\nnegotiated agreements to arbitrate, like other contracts, in accordance with their\r\nterms.'\" (quoting Volt Info. Scis., Inc. v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ.,\r\n489 U.S. 468, 478 (1989))). \"[C]ourts must 'rigorously enforce' arbitration\r\nagreements according to their terms, including terms that 'specify with whom the\r\nparties choose to arbitrate their disputes,' and 'the rules under which that arbitration\r\nwill be conducted.'\" Am. Exp. Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., No. 12-133, slip op., at 3\r\n(U.S. filed June 20, 2013) (internal citations omitted). Thus, the FAA \"does not\r\nconfer a right to compel arbitration of any dispute at any time; it confers only the\r\nright to obtain an order directing that 'arbitration proceed in the manner provided\r\nfor in the parties' agreement.'\" Volt Info. Scis., 489 U.S. at 474-75 (quoting 9\r\nU.S.C. § 4).\r\n\r\nSection 19.2 of the Contract expressly invokes the FAA and such contractual\r\nprovisions should be enforced in accordance with their unambiguous terms. See\r\nDean Witter, 470 U.S. at 221 (noting that the \"preeminent concern\" in construing\r\narbitration agreements is to protect the contractual rights of the parties, which\r\nrequires courts to enforce \"rigorously\" those terms upon which private parties have\r\n\nagreed); Muñoz, 343 S.C. at 538, 542 S.E.2d at 363-64 (holding an agreement that\r\nprovides it shall be governed by the FAA is enforceable in accordance with its\r\nterms). We hold it was error to refuse to compel arbitration.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note Cape Romain has never challenged the arbitrability of the\r\nmechanics' lien claim—only the applicability of the FAA. Moreover, the issues\r\ninvolved in Cape Romain's mechanics' lien claim against Wando E. are completely\r\ndependent on the breach of contract dispute between Cape Romain and Barnes.\r\nSee Sea Pines Co. v. Kiawah Island Co., 268 S.C. 153, 159, 232 S.E.2d 501, 503\r\n(1977) (observing that where no debt is owed under a construction contract, no\r\nmechanics' lien is proper); Glidden Coatings & Resins v. Suitt Const. Co., 290 S.C.\r\n240, 244, 349 S.E.2d 89, 91 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding the predicate for recovery\r\nunder a mechanics' lien suit is the existence of an unpaid debt); Blackwell v.\r\nBlackwell, 289 S.C. 470, 472-73, 346 S.E.2d 731, 732-33 (Ct. App. 1986) (noting\r\nthat a lien is valid only to the extent the underlying obligation it secures is valid);\r\nShelley Const. Co., Inc. v. Sea Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 24, 26, 336 S.E.2d\r\n488, 489 (Ct. App. 1985) (a mechanics' lien is given to secure payment of the debt\r\ndue for labor performed or materials furnished during construction). Thus, we are\r\nable to determine \"with positive assurance\" that the mechanics' lien claim arises\r\ndirectly from the Contract and, therefore, is encompassed by the arbitration\r\nagreement. See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118 (\"[U]nless the court\r\ncan say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible to an\r\ninterpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should be ordered.\"); Towles, 338\r\nS.C. at 41, 524 S.E.2d at 846 (\"Therefore, any doubts concerning the scope of\r\narbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration . . . .\"). Accordingly, we\r\nhold the mechanics' lien claim must be arbitrated.8\r\n\r\n8 Our finding is not precluded by section 21.2 of the Contract, which addresses\r\nmechanics' lien claims and allows a party to \"proceed in accordance with\r\napplicable law to comply with the lien notice or filing deadlines.\" See S.C. Code §\r\n29-5-90 (lien must be filed within 90 days of ceasing to furnish labor or materials);\r\nS.C. Code § 29-5-120 (suit to enforce the lien must be commenced within six\r\nmonths after ceasing to furnish labor or materials or the lien is dissolved).\r\nReading section 21.2 in conjunction with the Contract as a whole (particularly the\r\nbalance of article 21), we find section 21.2 does not alter the agreement to arbitrate\r\nall \"[c]laims disputes and other matters in question arising out of or relating to this\r\nContract\"; rather, section 21.2 merely creates a narrow exception permitting a party\r\nto preserve a mechanics' lien through timely filings. Indeed, nothing in the\r\nContract excludes the mechanics' lien claim from the scope of the arbitration\r\n\nAs a final matter, the trial court found Wando E. could not compel arbitration\r\nbecause it was not a party or signatory to the Contract between Cape Romain and\r\nBarnes. While Wando E., as a non-contracting party, may lack standing to compel\r\narbitration, Barnes certainly has standing to do so. Appellants are correct that, in\r\nany event, Wando E. could join arbitration, once compelled pursuant to Barnes'\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe Contract provides:\r\n\r\n      § 21.6 Any party to an arbitration may include by joinder persons or\r\n      entities substantially involved in a common question of law or fact\r\n      whose presence is required if complete relief is to be accorded in\r\n      arbitration provided that the party sought to be joined consents in\r\n      writing to such joinder. . . . .\r\n\r\n      § 21.7 The foregoing agreement to arbitrate and other agreements to\r\n      arbitrate with an additional person or entity duly consented to by\r\n      parties to the Agreement shall be specifically enforceable under\r\n      applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nApplying state-law principles of contract interpretation, we find as a matter of law\r\nthat Wando E. is an entity who is \"substantially involved in a common question of\r\nlaw or fact whose presence is required if complete relief is to be accorded in\r\narbitration.\" Therefore, under the unambiguous terms of the Contract between\r\nBarnes and Cape Romain, Wando E. may properly be joined as a party to the\r\narbitration proceedings. See Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Carl Brazell Builders, Inc.,\r\n356 S.C. 156, 162, 588 S.E.2d 112, 115 (2003) (\"When a contract is unambiguous,\r\nclear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have\r\nused.\"); B.L.G. Enters. v. First Fin. Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 529, 535, 514 S.E.2d 327,\r\n330 (1999) (noting \"[t]he court's duty is 'limited to the interpretation of the contract\r\nmade by the parties themselves'\" (quoting C.A.N. Enters. v. S.C. Health & Human\r\nServs. Fin. Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373, 378, 373 S.E.2d 584, 587 (1988))).\r\n\r\n\r\nclause. To find otherwise would be to construe the Contract to defeat its very\r\npurpose: the resolution of all related disputes in one, agreed-upon forum—\r\narbitration. See Zabinski, 346 S.C. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118 (\"[T]he range of\r\nissues that can be arbitrated is restricted by the terms of the agreement.\").\r\n\n                                         III.\r\n\r\nWe therefore conclude the trial court erred in denying the motion to compel\r\narbitration. Because arbitration will proceed, the trial court proceedings shall be\r\nstayed pending the outcome of arbitration. See Adkins v. Labor Ready, Inc., 303\r\nF.3d 496, 500 (4th Cir. 2002) (\"This stay-of-litigation provision is mandatory. A\r\ndistrict court therefore has no choice but to grant a motion to compel arbitration\r\nwhere a valid arbitration agreement exists and the issues in a case fall within its\r\npurview.\").\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.

The certified\r\nquestions herein require us to delve into the gray areas of common law,\r\nenvironmental torts. Specifically, we consider the measure of damages for trespass\r\nand nuisance claims, the requirement that a physical, tangible invasion occur for a\r\ntrespass to arise, the existence of a negligence claim based on odors, and the\r\nrequirement of expert testimony to establish the standard of care of a landfill\r\noperator.            FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n        The plaintiffs, six individuals residing near a landfill operated by defendant\r\nLee County Landfill SC, LLC (the Landfill) in Bishopville, South Carolina,\r\ninitiated this action seeking to recover for substantial interference with the use and\r\nenjoyment of their property caused by odors emanating from the landfill. The\r\nplaintiffs asserted nuisance, trespass, and negligence claims based on the odors.\r\n\nBoth before and during trial, the plaintiffs abandoned all claims for loss of use,\r\ndiminution in property value, and personal injury, leaving only annoyance,\r\ndiscomfort, inconvenience, interference with enjoyment of their property, loss of\r\nenjoyment of life, and interference with mental tranquility as their damages claims.\r\n\r\n       Following a trial, the jury awarded the plaintiffs actual or compensatory\r\ndamages totaling $532,500 on their negligence, trespass, and nuisance claims, with\r\nthree plaintiffs receiving $77,500 and three receiving $100,000. The jury also\r\nawarded each plaintiff $300,000 in punitive damages. The Landfill filed motions\r\nfor judgment as a matter of law or alternatively for a new trial. After determining\r\nthat South Carolina precedent was not clear on state law issues raised in the post-\r\ntrial motions, the District Court certified five questions to this Court.\r\n\r\n                            CERTIFIED QUESTIONS\r\n      The five questions, as certified to this Court by the United States District\r\nCourt for the District of South Carolina, read:\r\n\r\n   1. Under South Carolina law, when a plaintiff seeks recovery for a temporary\r\n      trespass or nuisance (asserting claims for annoyance, discomfort,\r\n      inconvenience, interference with their enjoyment of their property, loss of\r\n      enjoyment of life, and interference with mental tranquility and abandoning\r\n      all claims for loss of use, diminution in value, and personal injury), are the\r\n      damages limited to the lost rental value of the property?\r\n\r\n   2. Does South Carolina law recognize a cause of action for trespass solely from\r\n      invisible odors rather than a physical invasion such as dust or water?\r\n\r\n   3. Is the maximum amount of compensatory damages a plaintiff can receive in\r\n      any trespass or nuisance action (temporary or permanent) the full market\r\n      value of the plaintiffs' property where no claim for restoration or cleanup\r\n      costs has been alleged?\r\n\r\n   4. When a plaintiff contends that offensive odors have migrated from a\r\n      neighbor's property onto the plaintiff's property, may the plaintiff maintain\r\n      an independent cause of action for negligence or is the plaintiff limited to\r\n      remedies under trespass and nuisance?\r\n\r\n   5. If an independent cause of action for negligence exists under South Carolina\r\n      law when a plaintiff contends that offensive odors have migrated from a\r\n\n      neighbor's property onto the plaintiff's property, does the standard of care for\r\n      a landfill operator and breach thereof need to be established through expert\r\n      testimony?                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    TEMPORARY TRESPASS AND NUISANCE DAMAGES\r\n       The first question asks whether the lost rental value of property is the\r\nmaximum amount of damages recoverable for a temporary trespass or nuisance.1\r\nWhile the Landfill argues that the temporary trespass and nuisance damages are\r\nlimited to the lost rental value of the property, the plaintiffs argue that in addition\r\nto this measure of damages, they can also recover separate damages for annoyance,\r\ndiscomfort, and inconvenience. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue they can recover\r\nfor \"damages to the person incurred through the loss of enjoyment of the property.\"\r\nWe answer this question in the affirmative, holding the damages recoverable for a\r\ntemporary trespass or nuisance are limited to lost rental value.\r\n\r\n      From their earliest inception through the present day, the actions of trespass\r\nand nuisance have been limited to one's interest in property, rather than providing\r\nany protection to one's person. Trespass, as that term is used here,2 arose from the\r\nmedieval assize of novel disseisin3 which was created for the protection of a\r\nlandowner's interest in the exclusive possession of land. George E. Woodbine, The\r\nOrigins of the Action of Trespass, 33 Yale L.J. 799, 807 (1924); see also Theodore\r\nF.T. Plucknett, A Concise History of the Common Law 369–70 (5th ed. 1956).\r\n\r\n1 The general concept of nuisance covers both public and private nuisances. Here,\r\nplaintiffs asserted only a private nuisance claim, and herein, the term \"nuisance\" is\r\nused solely to connote a private nuisance.\r\n2 While trespass may mean any \"unlawful act committed against the person or\r\nproperty of another,\" and in that sense is the mother of all common law tort\r\nliability, we use it here in the form in which it is now generally used to mean an\r\naction to recover for an unlawful entry by another onto one's real property. Black's\r\nLaw Dictionary 1541 (8th ed. 1999); see also Charles O. Gregory, Trespass to\r\nNegligence to Absolute Liability, 37 Va. L. Rev. 359, 361 (1951) (explaining\r\ntrespass's role as the ancestor of modern torts). With the development of tort law\r\nover the intervening centuries, those other forms of trespass have become their\r\nown distinct causes of action with their own names.\r\n3  \"Disseisin\" is \"[t]he act of wrongfully depriving someone of the freehold\r\npossession of property.\" Black's Law Dictionary 506 (8th ed. 1999).\r\n\nGlanville, the great medieval legal scholar who was the first to comment upon the\r\nassize of novel disseisin, wrote that it existed to aid a person when another\r\n\"unjustly and without a Judgment, has disseised another of his Freehold.\" R.\r\nGlanville, The Treatise on the Laws and Customs of the Realm of England, bk.\r\nXIII, ch. XXXII (John Beames trans. 1900). Thus, Glanville recognized the assize\r\nas limited to protection of one's property interests.\r\n\r\n       Developing from the assize of novel disseisin came the assize of nuisance,\r\nmodern nuisance's medieval ancestor. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821D\r\n(1979); Bradford W. Wyche, A Guide to the Common Law of Nuisance in South\r\nCarolina, 45 S.C. L. Rev. 337, 340 (1994). The new writ also protected a\r\nlandowner from interference with his rights in land and \"closely resembled the\r\nmodern cause of action for private nuisance, providing redress for interference\r\nwith the use and enjoyment of plaintiff's land resulting from acts committed on the\r\ndefendant's land.\" Jeff L. Lewin, Boomer and the American Law of Nuisance, 54\r\nAlb. L. Rev. 189, 193 (1990); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821D\r\n(stating that the assize of nuisance provided redress where there was an \"indirect\r\ndamage to the land or an interference with its use and enjoyment\").\r\n\r\n       Blackstone, writing centuries later, described a trespass as a \"species . . . of\r\nreal injuries, or wrongs that affect a man's lands, tenements, or hereditaments.\" 3\r\nWilliam Blackstone, Commentaries *209. He went on to describe a trespass as \"an\r\nentry on another man's ground without a lawful authority, and doing some damage,\r\nhowever inconsiderable, to his real property,\" and explained that the trespass cause\r\nof action protects a property owner's right to exclusive possession of his land. Id.\r\nBlackstone also wrote that a nuisance was a \"real injur[y] to a man's lands and\r\ntenements,\" describing a private nuisance as \"anything done to the hurt or\r\nannoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another.\" Id. at *216.\r\nThus, Blackstone recognized trespass and nuisance as actions protecting and\r\nlimited to one's property rights.\r\n\r\n       Arising from that common law heritage, under South Carolina law trespass\r\nand nuisance are limited to the protection of property interests. A trespass is any\r\ninterference with \"one's right to the exclusive, peaceable possession of his\r\nproperty.\" Ravan v. Greenville Cnty., 315 S.C. 447, 463, 434 S.E.2d 296, 306 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1993). A nuisance, trespass's counterpart, provides a remedy for invasions of\r\na property owner's right to the use and enjoyment of his property. Clark v.\r\nGreenville Cnty., 313 S.C. 205, 209, 437 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1993) (\"Nuisance law is\r\nbased on the premise that '[e]very citizen holds his property subject to the implied\r\nobligation that he will use it in such a way as not to prevent others from enjoying\r\n\nthe use of their property.'\" (quoting Peden v. Furman Univ., 155 S.C. 1, 16, 151\r\nS.E.2 907, 912 (1930))).\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, the Restatement (Second) of Torts bolsters this conclusion by\r\nrecognizing that those causes of action are limited to one's property rights, stating\r\nthat \"[a] trespass is an invasion of the interest in the exclusive possession of land,\r\nas by entry upon it. A nuisance is an interference with the interest in the private\r\nuse and enjoyment of the land . . . .\" Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821D\r\n(1979). It goes on to provide:\r\n\r\n      \"Interest in use and enjoyment\" also comprehends the pleasure,\r\n      comfort and enjoyment that a person normally derives from the\r\n      occupancy of land. Freedom from discomfort and annoyance while\r\n      using lands is often as important to a person as freedom from physical\r\n      interruption with his use or freedom from detrimental change in the\r\n      physical condition of the land itself. This interest in freedom from\r\n      annoyance and discomfort in the use of land is to be distinguished\r\n      from the interest in freedom from emotional distress. The latter is\r\n      purely an interest of personality and receives limited legal protection,\r\n      whereas the former is essentially an interest in the usability of land . . .\r\n\r\nId.    To the extent South Carolina's trespass and nuisance case law discusses\r\nannoyance, discomfort, interference with the enjoyment of property, loss of\r\nenjoyment of life, or interference with mental tranquility, those cases speak in\r\nterms of injury to one's property interest in the use and enjoyment of property. For\r\nexample, in Woods v. Rock Hill Fertilizer Co., 102 S.C. 442, 86 S.E. 817 (1915),\r\nthe plaintiff brought a nuisance action against a fertilizer plant near her home based\r\non odors, dust, and small particles emanating from the plant. The Court held that\r\nallegations the plaintiff's mother and sister lived with her and suffered annoyance\r\nand discomfort due to the plant were relevant only because they tended to show\r\n\"the nature and extent of the plaintiff's damages, since she has the right to have\r\nthem live with her and enjoy the comforts of her home.\" Id. at 449, 86 S.E. at 819.\r\nThus, the Court found the annoyance and discomfort allegations were relevant\r\nbecause they went to the harm to the plaintiff's property interest in the use and\r\nenjoyment of her property.\r\n\r\n     In Davis v. Palmetto Quarries Co., 212 S.C. 496, 48 S.E.2d 329 (1948),\r\nwork at a nearby quarry vibrated the plaintiff's home, threw dust and dirt onto her\r\n\nproperty, and subjected the home's inhabitants to loud noises. Id. at 330, 48 S.E.2d\r\nat 498. The plaintiff brought a nuisance action against the quarry, and the quarry\r\nlater appealed the trial court's denial of the motion to strike from the complaint\r\nallegations that the plaintiff and her family's comfort and health had been impaired\r\nby work at the quarry. Id. at 449, 48 S.E. at 330–31. The Court found no error and\r\nheld that while the allegations concerning the plaintiff's family members would not\r\nalone support a verdict, the allegations were \"proper for a full statement of the\r\nalleged damages to the plaintiff as the owner of her home.\" Id. at 499–500, 48\r\nS.E.2d at 331 (emphasis added). Again, the Court found the allegations relevant\r\nonly because they were tied to the plaintiff's property interest in the use and\r\nenjoyment of the property.\r\n\r\n       In Lever v. Wilder Mobile Homes, Inc., 283 S.C. 452, 322 S.E.2d 692 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1984), the plaintiff brought a nuisance action alleging the defendant's sewage\r\nlagoon emitted offensive odors and leaked sewage into the plaintiff's fish pond,\r\npolluting the pond and killing his fish. The defendant appealed the denial of its\r\nmotions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Id. at 454,\r\n322 S.E.2d at 693. The court of appeals found evidence establishing a nuisance in\r\nthe form of testimony that the plaintiff could no longer host family picnics or\r\nchurch groups on the property and could no longer garden there. Id. at 454, 322\r\nS.E.2d at 694. That evidence was not considered because of the harm the plaintiff\r\nsuffered personally, but because it represented a loss of use and enjoyment of the\r\nproperty, as shown by the court relating the alleged harm back to the ability to use\r\nand enjoy the property.\r\n\r\n      Thus, from their inception through to today, trespass and nuisance have been\r\nactions limited to the protection of one's property interests. They have never\r\nserved to protect against harms to one's person.4 To permit plaintiffs to recover for\r\nannoyance and discomfort to their person as a component of trespass or nuisance\r\ndamages, as opposed to as related to their property interests, would be to unhinge\r\ntrespass and nuisance from the traditional property locus and transform them into\r\npersonal injury causes of action. Not only would it represent a drastic expansion of\r\ntrespass and nuisance beyond the realm of property, it would also represent a\r\nfundamental change in our tort law jurisprudence which does not permit recovery\r\nfor sheer annoyance and discomfort. See Dooley v. Richland Mem'l Hosp., 283\r\n4 Rather, over time the common law developed numerous causes of action—for\r\nexample, battery and negligence—to permit a plaintiff to recover for harm to his\r\nperson. Of course, a trespass or nuisance plaintiff also has those causes of action\r\navailable to him to recover for harm to his person in addition to harm to his land.\r\n\nS.C. 372, 322 S.E.2d 669 (1984) (declining to recognize a negligent infliction of\r\nemotional distress cause of action and holding that damages for emotional distress\r\nare generally not recoverable in a negligence action absent some physical\r\nmanifestation). In short, allowing recovery for personal annoyance and discomfort\r\nunder the guise of trespass and nuisance would be the stealth recognition of an\r\nentirely new tort.\r\n\r\n       The damages recoverable for trespass and nuisance being strictly limited to\r\ndamages to one's property interests, the only proper measure of them is the value of\r\nthe property. A well-known principle of property law is that property consists of a\r\nbundle of rights. The value of a piece of property is the value of all of the rights\r\none obtains through ownership of the property. Thus, included in the value of\r\nproperty are the rights of exclusive possession and use and enjoyment protected by\r\nthe trespass and nuisance causes of action respectively. To the extent those\r\ninterests are harmed by a temporary trespass or nuisance, the harm would be\r\nreflected in the lost rental value of the property. See S. Ry. Co. v. Routh, 170 S.W.\r\n520, 521 (Ky. Ct. App. 1914) (holding that in measuring the damages for a\r\nnuisance, \"the diminution in the value of the use of the property necessarily\r\nincludes annoyance and discomfort, which directly affect the value of the use. It is\r\nnot, therefore, proper to permit a recovery both for the diminution in the value of\r\nthe use and for annoyance and discomfort, which necessarily enter into and\r\nconstitute a part of the diminution of such value. To do so is to allow a double\r\nrecovery.\").\r\n\r\n       In other words, lost rental value includes the annoyance and discomfort\r\nexperienced as the result of a temporary trespass or nuisance. The lost rental value\r\nof the property is the difference between the rental value absent the trespass or\r\nnuisance and the rental value with the trespass or nuisance. The rental value with\r\nthe trespass or nuisance present would be less, in part, because a hypothetical\r\nrenter would have to suffer the annoyance and discomfort of the nuisance or\r\ntrespass. Thus, the lost rental value measures the monetary value of the harm to\r\nthe property interest. Furthermore, because lost rental value includes damages\r\ncaused by annoyance or discomfort, to permit a plaintiff to recover both the lost\r\nrental value plus an additional sum for annoyance and discomfort would be to\r\npermit a double recovery.\r\n\r\n       We have already recognized the lost rental value of property as the measure\r\nof and limit on damages for a temporary harm to property in our decision in Gray\r\nv. Southern Facilities, Inc., 256 S.C. 558, 183 S.E.2d 438 (1971). There, the\r\nplaintiff asserted a negligence claim against the defendant for pumping gasoline\r\n\ninto a creek behind the plaintiff's home which later ignited, setting the creek\r\nablaze. Id. at 561, 183 S.E.2d at 439. At trial, the defendant was granted an\r\ninvoluntary nonsuit on the ground the plaintiff had not sustained any actual or\r\nphysical damages. Id. at 561–62, 183 S.E.2d at 439. Reviewing the grant of\r\ninvoluntary nonsuit, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n             The general rule is that in case of an injury of a permanent\r\n      nature to real property, by the pollution of a stream, the proper\r\n      measure of damages is the diminution of the market value by reason\r\n      of that injury, or in other words, the difference between the value of\r\n      the land before the injury and its value after the injury. Where the\r\n      pollution of a stream results in a temporary or nonpermanent injury to\r\n      real property, the injured landowner can recover the depreciation in\r\n      the rental or usable value of the property caused by the pollution.\r\n\r\nId. at 569, 183 S.E.2d at 443. Thus, while not explicitly using the terms trespass or\r\nnuisance, the Court held that lost rental value is the proper measure of damages for\r\na temporary harm to real property, which would include a temporary trespass or\r\nnuisance. See also Ravan, 315 S.C. at 465, 434 S.E.2d at 307 (\"The measure of\r\ndamages for permanent injury to real property by pollution, whether by nuisance,\r\ntrespass, negligence, or inverse condemnation is the diminution in the market value\r\nof the property.\" (citing Gray, 256 S.C. at 569, 183 S.E.2d at 443)).\r\n\r\n      Contrary to the plaintiffs' assertions, the case of Threatt v. Brewer Mining\r\nCo., 49 S.C. 95, 26 S.E. 970 (1897), does not establish otherwise. There, a farmer\r\nsued a neighboring mining operation for damage to the farmer's lands and odors\r\nfrom mining waste deposited into a waterway and from there onto the farmer's\r\nland. In the Threatt opinion, this Court wrote:\r\n\r\n      [T]his plaintiff is entitled to have the defendant to pay him damages\r\n      for thus ruining, for the time, at any rate, his fertile bottoms. In the\r\n      measure of the damages to the plaintiff for the injuries to his thirty-\r\n      five acres of bottom lands, the jury should be limited, in ascertaining\r\n      his damages, to the difference in the value of the lands from 8th May,\r\n      1890, to the date plaintiff brought his suit. But in the assessment of\r\n      his damages from having a tainted—bad smelling—deposit thrown\r\n      upon his bottom lands and in his ditches, they (the jury) are not\r\n      limited to the actual injury in the market value of those lands from 8th\r\n      May, 1890, to the date, in May, 1893, when the suit was brought; but\r\n      they may find a reasonable, just compensation by way of damages to\r\n\n      the plaintiff for this matter. This deposit has a threefold injury—first,\r\n      it destroys the fertility of the lands; second, by filling up the ditches, it\r\n      causes water to stand upon other parts of the land; and, third, the\r\n      deposits exhale noxious odors. For the first and second injuries, the\r\n      verdict must be limited to the depreciation in the market value caused\r\n      by the deposits from 8th May, 1890, to May, 1893. As to the third,\r\n      the jury must estimate in dollars and cents what the bad odors from\r\n      these deposits, between the same dates, may have damaged the\r\n      plaintiff, if any such damage has occurred.\r\n\r\nThreatt, 49 S.C. 95, 134, 26 S.E. 970, 983. We do not find that language to be\r\ncontrolling or even persuasive as to the issue before this Court. First, it states only\r\nthat the jury may award damages in the amount the odors \"damaged the plaintiff,\"\r\nbut does not specify whether that means injury to the plaintiff's property interests\r\nor injury to the plaintiff's person. In other words, there is no clear holding that a\r\nparty may recover for personal injury through a trespass or nuisance action. To the\r\ncontrary, the opinion states that \"[w]hat the plaintiff in the case at bar really seeks\r\nis to prevent the defenda[n]t, through its milling operations, from invading his\r\nright to property,\" and then goes on to describe each of the alleged damages,\r\nincluding the odors as an \"element in this invasion of his right of property.\" Id. at\r\n128, 26 S.E. at 981 (emphasis added). Furthermore, to the extent Threatt could be\r\nread as holding that trespass and nuisance damages extend to personal injury and\r\nbeyond lost rental value, we believe Threatt was wrongly decided and directly\r\ncontradicts our more recent decision in Gray.\r\n\r\n      We now explicitly extend the holding in Gray to cover trespass and nuisance\r\nclaims for the reasons previously stated. Accordingly, we answer the certified\r\nquestion in the affirmative, holding that the lost rental value of property is the sole\r\nmeasure of temporary trespass and nuisance damages.\r\n\r\nII.   TRESPASS FROM INVISIBLE ODORS\r\n       The second certified question asks whether South Carolina law recognizes a\r\ncause of action for trespass solely from invisible odors, rather than from a physical\r\ninvasion such as dust or water. The plaintiffs argue South Carolina has abandoned\r\nthe traditional rule that a trespass requires an invasion of property by a physical,\r\ntangible thing, and thus, the Court should recognize odors as constituting a\r\ntrespass. The Landfill argues for the traditional rule, asserting that odors, due to\r\ntheir intangibility, cannot constitute a trespass, but rather, only may give rise to a\r\nnuisance cause of action. We hold that South Carolina adheres to the traditional\r\n\nrule requiring an invasion by a physical, tangible thing for a trespass to exist, and\r\naccordingly, hold that odors cannot give rise to a trespass claim.\r\n\r\n       We first note the relevant distinctions between the trespass and nuisance\r\ncauses of action which presumably give rise to the plaintiffs' arguments that\r\nintangible intrusions should be sufficient to constitute a trespass. First, recovery\r\nunder a nuisance claim requires proof of actual and substantial injury, whereas\r\ntrespass entitles a plaintiff to nominal damages even in the absence of any actual\r\ninjury. See Green Tree Servicing, LLC v. Williams, 377 S.C. 179, 184, 659 S.E.2d\r\n193, 195–96 (Ct. App. 2008). Also, in order to rise to the level of an actionable\r\nnuisance, the interference or inconvenience must be unreasonable. Winget v.\r\nWinn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 242 S.C. 152, 159, 130 S.E.2d 363, 367 (1963). The\r\nunreasonableness requirement reflects the unavoidable reality that persons must\r\nsuffer some inconvenience and annoyance from their neighbors for modern life to\r\ncarry on. Id. For trespass, there is no requirement of unreasonableness. Rather,\r\nany trespass, however small and insignificant, gives rise to an actionable claim.\r\nGreen Tree, 377 S.C. at 184, 659 S.E.2d at 195–96.\r\n\r\n       This Court has yet to consider the tangible versus intangible distinction for\r\ntrespass actions, but the plaintiffs assert the court of appeals held in Ravan that\r\nSouth Carolina no longer requires that an item be tangible in order to give rise to a\r\ntrespass action. We find the Ravan decision contains no holding in relation to\r\ntrespass by intangible things. There, the court of appeals affirmed a trial court's\r\ngrant of a directed verdict for defendants on a trespass cause of action. Ravan, 315\r\nS.C. at 465, 434 S.E.2d at 307. The court found there was no evidence the\r\ndefendants' entry onto the plaintiffs' property was unauthorized, and thus, the trial\r\ncourt correctly granted a directed verdict on the claim. Id. at 464, 434 S.E.2d at\r\n306. The opinion noted, anecdotally, \"there is a trend in environmental law to\r\nrecognize that the infiltration of contaminants onto a plaintiff's property constitutes\r\nas much an invasion of his possessory interest as the cutting of a tree on his\r\nproperty.\" Id. at 463, 434 S.E.2d at 306. Not only was that statement mere dicta in\r\nrelation to the court's holding, the court merely noted the \"trend\" without claiming\r\nto adopt it. See id.\r\n\r\n        The traditional common law rule, the dimensional test, provides that a\r\ntrespass only exists where the invasion of land occurs through a physical, tangible\r\nobject. See Adams v. Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co., 602 N.W.2d 215, 219 (Mich. Ct.\r\nApp. 1999). Under that rule, intangible matter or energy, such as smoke, noise,\r\nlight, and vibration, are insufficient to constitute a trespass. Id.; Larry D. Scheafer,\r\nAnnotation, Recovery in Trespass for Injury to Land Caused by Airborne\r\n\nPollutants, 2 A.L.R. 4th 1054 (discussing the traditional rule). More specifically,\r\nunder that rule, courts have held that odors do not give rise to a trespass cause of\r\naction because they are intangible. See, e.g., Brockman v. Barton Brands, Ltd., No.\r\n3:06-CV-332-H, 2009 WL 4252914, at *5 (W.D. Ky. Nov. 25, 2009) (\"The odors .\r\n. . which are visibly undetectable and transient, are not sufficient to state a claim\r\nfor trespass, because a trespass only occurs when an object or thing enters a\r\nperson's property and interferes with his or her possession or control.\"); Ryan v.\r\nCity of Emmetsburg, 4 N.W.2d 435, 438–39 (Iowa 1942) (holding that the odors\r\nfrom a sewage treatment plant would not give rise to a trespass action); Wendinger\r\nv. Frost Farms, Inc., 662 N.W.2d 546, 554 (Minn. Ct. App. 2003) (\"Because odors\r\ndo not interfere with the exclusive possession of land, an allegation that a\r\nconfined-animal feeding operation emits invasive odors does not state a claim for\r\ntrespass.\").\r\n\r\n       In reaction to modern science's understanding of microscopic and atomic\r\nparticles, a divergent line of decisions have discarded the dimensional test and\r\npermitted recovery for trespass without regard to whether the intrusion was by a\r\ntangible object, but rather by considering the nature of the interest harmed.\r\nScheafer, supra (citing cases). The first seminal case in this line of decisions was\r\nMartin v. Reynolds Metals Co., 342 P.2d 790 (Or. 1959). There, the plaintiffs\r\nbrought a trespass action against an aluminum smelter for fluoride gases and\r\nmicroscopic particulates they alleged the smelter emitted, which traveled through\r\nthe air and settled on the plaintiffs' property. Id. at 791. The trial court entered a\r\ndirected verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendant appealed the trial court's ruling\r\nthat the plaintiffs stated a trespass cause of action. Id. Dispensing with the\r\ndimensional test, the Oregon Supreme Court held the intrusion of fluoride was a\r\ntrespass despite its intangible nature. Id. at 797. The court reasoned that while the\r\nfluoride particles were individually minute and invisible, each particle that entered\r\nthe plaintiffs' property was a physical intrusion, and but for their size, would\r\nundoubtedly give rise to a trespass action. Id. at 792. The court also noted cases\r\nfinding intrusions by very small objects constituted a trespass, citing cases in\r\nwhich shot from a gun, particles of molten lead, spray from a cooling tower, and\r\nsoot were held to be a trespass. Id. at 793. Additionally, the court cited cases in\r\nwhich vibrations of the soil and concussion of the air created a trespass. Id. The\r\ncourt then concluded that drawing a line between tangible and intangible intrusions\r\nhad become arbitrary in light of modern science, writing:\r\n\r\n      It is quite possible that in an earlier day when science had not yet\r\n      peered into the molecular and atomic world of small particles, the\r\n      courts could not fit an invasion through unseen physical\r\n\n      instrumentalities into the requirement that a trespass can result only\r\n      from a direct invasion. But in this atomic age even the uneducated\r\n      know the great and awful force contained in the atom and what it can\r\n      do to a man's property if it is released. In fact, the now famous\r\n      equation E=mc² has taught us that mass and energy are equivalents\r\n      and that our concept of 'things' must be reframed.\r\n\r\nId. In light of those considerations, the court held the determination of whether an\r\ninvasion of the right to exclusive possession occurred, and thus whether a trespass\r\noccurred, is best determined by consideration of the energy and force of the thing\r\nintruding upon a plaintiff's land. Id. at 794.\r\n\r\n       Tellingly, the Martin court then found it necessary to immediately backpedal\r\nin order to constrain the expansion of trespass liability created by discarding the\r\ndimensional test. The court recognized that trespass imposes strict liability upon a\r\ntrespasser regardless of whether the trespass caused any damages, and thus, the\r\ncourt's new test created the potential for manufacturers to be held liable for even\r\nthe smallest intrusions. Id. at 796. The court also recognized that not all intrusions\r\nupon one's property are so great as to interfere with the right to exclusive\r\npossession. Id. at 794–95. Accordingly, the court imposed a substantiality test to\r\ndistinguish trespassory intrusions from non-trespassory intrusions, holding that an\r\nin order to constitute a trespass, an intrusion must be of sufficiently substantial\r\nforce and energy as to interfere with the right to exclusive possession. Id. The\r\ncourt also held that consideration of the plaintiff's use of his property is relevant to\r\nwhether a trespass exists, with some uses of one's property being ones \"the law\r\ndoes not wish to protect . . . from an invasion,\" and thus incapable of giving rise to\r\na trespass cause of action. Id. at 794. Summarizing this new conception of\r\ntrespass, the court wrote that it is \"composed of components which include the\r\ncharacter (including the magnitude) of the defendant's conduct in causing an\r\nintrusion and the character (including the magnitude) of the harm visited on the\r\nplaintiff in interfering with his interest in the exclusive possession of the\r\npremises.\" Id. at 795–96. However, as the court acknowledged, these\r\nmodifications caused the trespass and nuisance causes of action to \"coalesce.\" Id.\r\nat 795.The next seminal decision in the divergent line was Borland v. Sanders Lead\r\nCo., Inc., 369 So. 2d 523 (Ala. 1979), where the plaintiffs sued a lead smelter for\r\nlead and sulfoxide emissions they alleged settled on and damaged their property.\r\nId. at 525–26. After a discussion of Martin, the court noted that in adopting the\r\nMartin holding it \"might appear, at first blush, . . . that every property owner in this\r\n\nState would have a cause of action against any neighboring industry which emitted\r\nparticulate matter into the atmosphere, or even a passing motorist, whose exhaust\r\nemissions come to rest upon another's property.\" Id. at 529. However, the court\r\nfound that Martin's substantiality requirement obviates that concern. Id. Adopting\r\nthe Martin rejection of the dimensional test, the court set forth a two-tiered concept\r\nof trespass. Where a trespass is \"direct,\" as formerly required for a trespass to exist\r\nand including physical, tangible intrusions, there is no substantiality requirement\r\nand nominal damages may be awarded. Id. However, where the intrusion is\r\nindirect, including where the intrusion is intangible, the intrusion constitutes a\r\ntrespass only if the plaintiff can show: \"1) an invasion affecting an interest in the\r\nexclusive possession of his property; 2) an intentional doing of the act which\r\nresults in the invasion; 3) reasonable foreseeability that the act done could result in\r\nan invasion of plaintiff's possessory interest; and 4) substantial damages to the\r\nRes.\" Id.5\r\n\r\n       However, we find persuasive the Michigan Court of Appeals' rejection of\r\nthis divergent line of decisions in Adams v. Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co. There, the\r\ncourt adhered to the dimensional test, holding that intangible invasions are\r\nproperly characterized as giving rise to nuisance or negligence actions and cannot\r\ngive rise to a trespass action. Adams, 602 N.W.2d at 222. The court first noted\r\nthat courts rejecting the dimensional test have been troubled by the principle that\r\nnominal damages are available for trespass, and in order to avoid \"subjecting\r\nmanufacturing plants to potential liability to every landowner on whose parcel\r\nsome incidental residue of industrial activity might come to rest, these courts have\r\ngrafted onto the law of trespass a requirement of actual and substantial damages.\"\r\nId. at 221. But in adopting the substantiality requirement, those courts transmute\r\nthe trespass cause of action into the nuisance cause of action. Id. The court went\r\non to explain that \"[w]here the possessor of land is menaced by noise, vibrations,\r\nor ambient dust, smoke, soot, or fumes, the possessory interest implicated is that of\r\n\r\n5 While rendered irrelevant by our holding herein, it is worth noting the Borland\r\ncourt explicitly stated that even after dispensing with the dimensional test and\r\nadopting the Martin rule, \"[t]he classic cases of the barking dog, the neighboring\r\nbawdy house, noise, smoke, fumes, or obnoxious odors generally invoke the\r\ndoctrine of the law of nuisance,\" rather than trespass, because \"[t]hese intrusions\r\ndo not typically result in any actionable damages to the Res; the injury caused by\r\nsuch acts usually results in a diminution of the use value of the property causally\r\nrelated to the harmful conduct made the basis of the claim.\" Id. at 530 (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n\nuse and enjoyment, not exclusion, and the vehicle through which a plaintiff\r\nnormally should seek a remedy is the doctrine of nuisance.\" Id. at 222. Finally,\r\nthe court found that the substantiality requirement inherent in the divergent view\r\nendangers the sanctity of the right to exclusive possession, explaining: \"The law\r\nshould not require a property owner to justify exercising the right to exclude. To\r\ncountenance the erosion of presumed damages in cases of trespass is to endanger\r\nthe right of exclusion itself.\" Id. at 221. Accordingly, the court concluded it would\r\nretain the dimensional test because it safeguards \"genuine claims of trespass and\r\nkeep[s] the line between the torts of trespass and nuisance from fading into a\r\nwavering and uncertain ambiguity.\" Id. at 223 (internal quotation omitted).\r\n\r\n       We acknowledge that the dimensional test is an imperfect rule. It does not\r\ncomport with modern science's understanding of matter and the relationship\r\nbetween matter and energy. However, we question whether any rule can perfectly\r\ndistinguish between those things that intrude upon the right to exclusive possession\r\nof land and those that do not. The right to exclusive possession is an artificial\r\nconstruct incapable of precise definition or measurement and thus, defies the\r\ncreation of a perfect rule to measure intrusions upon it.\r\n\r\n       Imperfections also plague the divergent line of decisions rejecting the\r\ndimensional test and their new form of trespass. The initial imperfection and that\r\nfrom which the others arise is that trespass is a strict liability theory under which a\r\nplaintiff may collect nominal damages for any intrusion regardless of whether it\r\ncaused harm. The dimensional test traditionally stood as a bulwark excluding from\r\ntrespass those intrusions not substantial enough to affect the right to exclusive\r\npossession. Without the dimensional test, even the most ephemeral intrusion—the\r\nexhaust from a passing car, the sound waves from neighbors talking, or even a\r\nsneeze that carry onto one's land—would constitute a trespass and an entitlement to\r\nat least nominal damages. In order to avoid that absurd result and the arresting\r\neffect it would have on modern life, those courts rejecting the dimensional test are\r\ncompelled to adopt a substantiality requirement to distinguish between those\r\nintrusions substantial enough to constitute a trespass and those too insubstantial to\r\ndo so.Lacking a perfect measure of when one's right to exclusive possession has\r\nbeen infringed and comparing the merits and demerits of the dimensional test and\r\nthe divergent view with its substantiality requirement, we conclude the\r\ndimensional test is superior to the divergent view. First, adoption of the\r\nsubstantiality requirement would seriously undermine the protection afforded the\r\nimportant right of exclusive possession, whereas the dimensional test maintains the\r\n\nstrict liability protection afforded that right. Property is commonly conceptualized\r\nas a bundle of rights, and among the rights some are particularly fundamental and\r\nas such receive greater protection than others. For example, because human\r\nsociety cannot function without persons experiencing some reduction in the use\r\nand enjoyment of their property due to others' use of nearby property, nuisance law\r\nonly protects landowners against substantial harm from others using their property\r\nunreasonably. However, the right of exclusive possession is fundamental.\r\nWithout it, other rights in the bundle would be rendered nearly worthless. For\r\nexample, one's ability to use and enjoy property would be severely curtailed by\r\nothers being permitted to come onto the property freely and do as they please.\r\nAccordingly, the common law has traditionally accorded absolute protection to the\r\nright of exclusive possession through trespass's provision of liability and damages\r\nfor any trespass, no matter how insignificant. The divergent view's imposition of a\r\nsubstantiality requirement as an element of trespass removes the former strict\r\nprotection of the right of exclusive possession and transforms trespass into\r\nnuisance. We believe the distinction between trespass and nuisance is important\r\ndue to the extra protection needed for the right of exclusive possession. The\r\ndimensional test, while not perfect, provides a workable rule that roughly tracks\r\nthe line between those things that interfere with the right to exclusive possession,\r\nand thus, are a trespass, and those that merely interfere with the right to use and\r\nenjoyment, and thus, are a nuisance.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, the dimensional test possesses the virtues of clarity, ease of\r\nimplementation, and ability to serve as a guide for future conduct. The\r\nsubstantiality requirement is a fact-specific, case-by-case rule, whereas the\r\ndimensional test, as applied to different intrusions over time, yields a stable rule as\r\nto what rises to the level of a trespass. Thus, the dimensionality test gives\r\nmembers of the public some idea of what constitutes a trespass and enables them to\r\nconform their conduct to the standard. The substantiality test would leave them\r\nuncertain as to whether they would be liable in trespass for certain actions. The\r\nrule would thus result in inefficient behavior because persons would forego some\r\nlegally permissible and socially and economically beneficial activities due to\r\nuncertainty as to whether the activities would constitute a trespass under the\r\nsubstantiality test. See Issac Ehrlich & Richard A. Posner, An Economic Analysis\r\nof Legal Rulemaking, 3 J. Legal Stud. 257, 262–64 (1974) (discussing the social\r\ncosts and economic inefficiencies imposed by imprecise legal standards).\r\n\r\n      Finally, as previously discussed, the divergent view would transform\r\ntrespass into nuisance. Nuisance already exists to remedy substantial harms to\r\n\nproperty, and thus, the divergent view leaves property owners with less, rather than\r\nmore, protection of their property rights.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, we answer this question in the negative. South Carolina\r\ndoes not recognize a trespass cause of action for invisible odors. Rather, South\r\nCarolina hews to the traditional dimensional test and only recognizes intrusions by\r\nphysical, tangible things as capable of constituting a trespass.\r\n\r\nIII. \t MAXIMUM RECOVERABLE DAMAGES FOR TRESPASS OR\r\n       NUISANCE\r\n       The third certified question asks whether the damages for any trespass or\r\nnuisance action, temporary or permanent, are limited to the full market value of the\r\nplaintiff's property where no claim for restoration or cleanup costs were alleged.\r\nThis question is related to the first question dealing with whether damages for\r\ntemporary trespass and nuisance are limited to lost rental value, and the reasoning\r\nemployed there applies with equal force here. Thus, for the reasons stated in\r\nregards to question one and having already held that the damages for temporary\r\ntrespass or nuisance are limited to lost rental value, we hold that the damages for\r\npermanent trespass or nuisance in South Carolina are limited to the full market\r\nvalue of the property.\r\n\r\nIV. \t NEGLIGENCE CAUSE OF ACTION FOR OFFENSIVE ODORS\r\n       The fourth question asks whether a negligence cause of action may arise\r\nfrom a plaintiff's contact with offensive odors created by a defendant. We hold\r\nthat while it may be possible for a plaintiff to recover in negligence for offensive\r\nodors, we stress that such a claim would have to satisfy the elements of negligence\r\nlike any other claim, and the mere offensive smell of odors would not be enough.\r\n\r\n      To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must establish duty, breach,\r\ncausation, and damages. Sherrill v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 260 S.C. 494,\r\n499, 197 S.E.2d 283, 285 (1973). Generally, under South Carolina law, the\r\ndamages element requires a plaintiff to establish physical injury or property\r\ndamage. Damages for emotional or mental suffering are typically not recoverable,\r\nunless there is some physical manifestation of the emotional distress. See Dooley,\r\n283 S.C. 372, 322 S.E.2d 669 (declining to recognize a negligent infliction of\r\nemotional distress cause of action and holding that damages for emotional distress\r\nare generally not recoverable in a negligence action absent some physical\r\nmanifestation). Thus, the mere annoyance, inconvenience, or discomfort a plaintiff\r\nmay suffer from offensive odors is not sufficient to establish a negligence claim.\r\n\nAccordingly, we answer this question in the affirmative, but hold that a negligence\r\nclaim based on offensive odors is subject to the same standard elements as any\r\nother negligence claim, including the limited damages upon which a negligence\r\nclaim may be premised.\r\n\r\nV.    STANDARD OF CARE\r\n       Finally, the fifth question asks, assuming a plaintiff can make out a\r\nnegligence cause of action based on offensive odors that have migrated from a\r\nneighbor's landfill onto the plaintiff's property, must the standard of care for a\r\nlandfill operator and breach thereof be established through expert testimony. The\r\ndetermination of whether expert testimony is required is a fact-specific inquiry that\r\ncan only be made on a case-by-case basis, and due to the posture of this case and\r\nthe limited record before this Court, we can do no more than state the guidelines to\r\nbe applied in particular cases.\r\n\r\n       The general rule in South Carolina is that where a subject is beyond the\r\ncommon knowledge of the jury, expert testimony is required. See Green v.\r\nLilliewood, 272 S.C. 186, 192–93, 249 S.E.2d 910, 913 (1978). Conversely, where\r\na lay person can comprehend and determine an issue without the assistance of an\r\nexpert, expert testimony is not required. See O'Leary-Payne v. R.R. Hilton Head,\r\nII, Inc., 371 S.C. 340, 349, 638 S.E.2d 96, 101 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"[E]xpert\r\ntestimony is not necessary to prove negligence or causation so long as lay persons\r\npossess the knowledge and skill to determine the matter at issue.\" (quoting F.\r\nPatrick Hubbard & Robert L. Felix, The Law of South Carolina Torts 167 (2d ed.\r\n1997))). Deciding what is within the knowledge of a lay jury and what requires\r\nexpert testimony depends on the particular facts of the case, including the\r\ncomplexity and technical nature of the evidence to be presented and the trial\r\njudge's understanding of a lay person's knowledge. See Sharpe v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nMental Health, 292 S.C. 11, 14, 354 S.E.2d 778, 780 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"The\r\napplication of the common knowledge exception to the requirement of expert\r\ntestimony in proving negligence depends on the particular facts of a case.\").\r\nUltimately, due to the fact-specific nature of the determination, it is a question that\r\nmust be left within the discretion of the trial judge.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n      For the reasons stated, we answer the certified questions as follows. As to\r\nquestion one, we hold the damages recoverable for a temporary trespass or\r\nnuisance claim are limited to the lost rental value of the property. As to question\r\n\ntwo, we hold a trespass exists only when an intrusion is made by a physical,\r\ntangible thing. As to question three, we hold the damages recoverable for a\r\npermanent trespass or nuisance claim are limited to the full market value of the\r\nproperty. As to question four, while we recognize that a negligence claim based on\r\noffensive odors is possible, we stress that such a claim would have to satisfy all the\r\nelements of negligence like any other negligence claim. Finally, as to question\r\nfive, we are unable to make a definitive determination as to whether establishing\r\nthe standard of care of a landfill operator in regards to offensive odors requires\r\nexpert testimony, but offer the guidelines for making such a determination and\r\nentrust that determination to the discretion of the trial judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27300","title":"Crouch Construction v.

Code § 15-48-130(a)(2) (2005). We reverse.\r\n\n                                         I.\r\n\r\nThis dispute arises from the construction of a commercial building in West\r\nColumbia, South Carolina. Before the undeveloped property was purchased,\r\nRespondent Bryan Causey hired GS2 Engineering and Environmental Consulting,\r\nInc. (GS2) to perform an engineering analysis of the soils on the property to\r\ndetermine whether the land was suitable for construction. Following inspections\r\nand testing, GS2's engineering report indicated that the soils within a certain\r\nproximity of the surface were unsuitable and had to be removed and replaced with\r\nsuitable soils.1 Causey formed Causey Consulting, LLC (Causey Consulting) of\r\nwhich he is the sole member, and thereafter Causey Consulting purchased the\r\nproperty for the purpose of constructing the commercial building. Appellant\r\nCrouch Construction Company was retained as the general contractor. Based on\r\nGS2's initial report, the construction contract allowed $25,000 for \"site work\" to be\r\nconducted, which represented only a small part of the total contract amount of\r\n$616,538.\r\n\r\nThe parties' dispute began over the amount of unsuitable soils excavated from the\r\nbuilding site. During construction, it became apparent that more unsuitable soil\r\nneeded to be removed than was initially anticipated, and the removal of additional\r\nsoil increased the cost of the project. The construction project was substantially\r\ncompleted by December 2008 and was occupied by Respondent Celebrations of\r\nColumbia, LLC, of which Causey is also a member.\r\n\r\nWhen Appellant did not receive final payment for the work, it filed a mechanic's\r\nlien and a suit to foreclose the lien in March 2009, claiming a balance due under\r\nthe construction contract in the amount of $114,158. Respondents denied any debt\r\nto Appellant and raised various counterclaims seeking $296,018 in damages for\r\nincomplete and faulty construction work.2\r\n\r\nIn March 2010, the circuit court ordered arbitration pursuant to an arbitration\r\nclause in the construction contract. The parties agreed for attorney James Bruner\r\nof Bruner Powell Wall & Mullins, LLC, of Columbia, to serve as the arbitrator,\r\n\r\n1GS2's engineering report also included recommendations as to the optimum\r\nmoisture content and the density to which the replacement fill material should be\r\ncompacted.\r\n2Essentially, Respondents claimed the building's foundation was settling.\r\nRespondents sought to recover the $211,996 spent installing stabilization piers.\r\n\nand arbitration was conducted November 2-4, 2010. The arbitrator determined\r\nAppellant was owed $68,160 under the contract, plus interest, attorney's fees and\r\ncosts.3 Although two engineers from GS2—George Sembos and Chad Bruorton—\r\ntestified as Appellant's fact and expert witnesses during the arbitration hearings,\r\nGS2 was not a party to the arbitration proceedings.\r\n\r\nOn February 3, 2011, Respondents filed their first motion to vacate the award,\r\nseeking to have it set aside based on several unfavorable evidentiary rulings and\r\ngeneral allegations that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law. A hearing\r\nwas conducted on February 14, 2011. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit\r\ncourt instructed the parties that it would deny Respondents' motion to vacate and\r\ninstructed Appellant's counsel to prepare an order confirming the arbitration award.\r\nHowever, before an order was entered, Respondents learned \"by happenstance\"\r\nthat an engineer employed by GS2, Jayson Floyd, was the brother of one of the\r\narbitrator's law partners, Joey Floyd. As a result, on March 20, 2011, Respondents\r\nfiled a supplemental motion to vacate the arbitration award, reiterating their\r\nprevious arguments and raising several new claims, including that the arbitrator's\r\nfailure to disclose his law partner's familial relationship with an employee of GS2\r\namounted to \"evident partiality,\" requiring the award to be set aside.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court granted the motion to vacate the arbitration award, finding the\r\narbitrator had a duty to discover and disclose his law partner's familial relationship\r\nwith a GS2 employee and that the arbitrator's failure to do so was tantamount to\r\nevident partiality. In finding vacatur was warranted, the circuit court held the\r\nrelevant legal standard for analyzing claims of evident partiality under section 15-\r\n48-130 is not the language of the statute itself, but rather, is the standard set forth\r\nin the South Carolina Code of Ethics for Arbitrators, which requires disclosure of\r\nany relationship that \"might reasonably create an appearance of partiality or bias.\"4\r\nThe circuit court concluded that the undisclosed relationship was \"clearly the type\r\n\r\n\r\n3 In calculating the amount of the award, the arbitrator specifically found that\r\nAppellant's subcontractors had over-excavated approximately 1700 cubic yards of\r\nsoil and that the outstanding contract balance must be reduced to remove charges\r\nfor that unnecessary work. In addition, the arbitrator made several other reductions\r\nand adjustments reducing the amount sought by Appellant. However, Respondents\r\nwere not awarded any offset based on the arbitrator's determination that the\r\nfoundation was not settling.\r\n4   Code of Ethics for Arbitrators Canon II A(2), App. A, SCADRR.\r\n\nof relationship\" that created an appearance of partiality and, therefore, the award\r\nshould be set aside. As an alternative holding, the circuit court found that, even if\r\nthe \"appearance of bias\" standard was not applicable and the appropriate legal\r\nstandard was that of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in ANR Coal Co. v.\r\nCogentrix of North Carolina,5 Respondents met their burden of proving evident\r\npartiality. In so finding, the circuit court noted the existence of the undisclosed\r\nrelationship and several unfavorable evidentiary rulings and vacated the arbitration\r\naward, concluding that, on the whole, the arbitrator's conduct demonstrated evident\r\npartiality in favor of Appellants.\r\n\r\nFollowing the circuit court's denial of Appellant's motion to alter or amend, this\r\nappeal followed. The matter was certified to this Court pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\nSCACR.                                   II.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court's adoption of a legal standard for evaluating claims of evident\r\npartiality under section 15-48-130 is a question of law which we review de novo.\r\nSee Town of Summerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d\r\n40, 41 (2008) (\"Determining the proper interpretation of a statute is a question of\r\nlaw, and this Court reviews questions of law de novo.\"); Catawba Indian Tribe of\r\nS.C. v.

Thus, we seek to discourage \"the losing party to every\r\narbitration\" from \"conduct[ing] a background investigation of each of the\r\narbitrators in an effort to uncover evidence\" to have the arbitration award set aside.\r\nMerit Ins. Co., 714 F.2d at 683.          III.\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court applied an incorrect legal standard and erred in\r\nsetting aside the arbitration award based on a finding that the arbitrator breached an\r\nethical duty to discover and disclose that his law partner's brother was employed at\r\nGS2 at the time of the arbitration proceedings. We agree.\r\n\r\n The South Carolina Code of Ethics for Arbitrators requires arbitrators to disclose\r\nthe existence of interests or relationships that are likely to affect their impartiality\r\nor suggest that they are biased against one party or favorable to another. Code of\r\nEthics for Arbitrators Canon II, App. A, SCADRR. However, an arbitrator is not\r\nrequired to provide the parties with \"his complete and unexpurgated business\r\nbiography\" or \"disclose interest[s] or relationships that are merely 'trivial.'\" Id. at\r\nn.2. Before arbitration, the arbitrator initially ran a conflicts check through his law\r\nfirm's database for each of the parties. That conflict check revealed no material\r\ninterest or relationship, and thus, no disclosure was made. Subsequently, a few\r\nweeks before arbitration, the parties submitted witness lists, which the arbitrator\r\nreviewed to ensure he personally had no interest or relationship which would need\r\nto be disclosed.6 Once again, no material interest was discovered, and no\r\ndisclosure was made. Although GS2's engineering recommendations related to the\r\ncrux of the parties' construction dispute, there is no indication in the record of any\r\ndirect social, professional or financial connection between the arbitrator and Jayson\r\nFloyd or any other GS2 employee at any time.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court improperly conflated a purported breach of the South Carolina\r\nCode of Ethics for Arbitrators with a factual showing that justifies setting aside an\r\narbitration award. While an arbitrator's failure to disclose a material conflict of\r\ninterest may constitute an ethical violation, the issue of whether such nondisclosure\r\nis unethical is separate and distinct from the issue of whether an arbitration award\r\nmust be vacated due to evident partiality. To have an award set aside, it is not\r\nenough merely to aver that an arbitrator violated the Code of Ethics without any\r\n\r\n6The same seven GS2 employees were named on both Appellant's and\r\nRespondents' potential witness lists.\r\n\nshowing that the complained-of violation \"created a substantial danger of an unjust\r\nresult.\" Merit Ins. Co., 714 F.2d at 682-83. See ANR Coal, 173 F.3d at 499\r\n(finding that an arbitrator's failure to disclose in violation of the arbitration rules\r\ndoes not, in and of itself, constitute an independent basis for vacatur); Merit Ins.\r\nCo., 714 F.2d at 680 (\"[E]ven if the [arbitrator's] failure to disclose was a material\r\nviolation of the ethical standards applicable to arbitration proceedings, it does not\r\nfollow that the arbitration award may be nullified judicially. Although we have\r\ngreat respect for the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Code of Ethics for\r\nArbitrators, they are not the proper starting point for an inquiry into an award's\r\nvalidity . . . .\"). Thus, mindful of the limited scope of judicial review of arbitration\r\nawards, we must discern the proper legal standard for evaluating claims of evident\r\npartiality.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the circumstances in which the arbitration award may be set aside are\r\ncontrolled by the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration Act7 (SCUAA), which\r\nprovides four8 grounds for vacatur. 9 At issue here is the provision allowing an\r\n7   S.C. Code §§ 15-48-10 to -240 (2005).\r\n8Although it is not pertinent to our analysis, we acknowledge that an arbitration\r\naward also may be vacated based upon the non-statutory ground of manifest\r\ndisregard of the law. See C-Sculptures, 403 S.C.at 56, 742 S.E.2d at 360 (\"[A]n\r\narbitrator's manifest disregard of the law, as a basis for vacating an arbitration\r\naward occurs when the arbitrator knew of a governing legal principle yet refused to\r\napply it.\").\r\n9 Appellant now argues the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) are\r\ncontrolling because the underlying construction contract involved interstate\r\ncommerce. However, Respondents' motion to vacate and the circuit court's order\r\nvacating the arbitration award both rely upon the \"evident partiality\" standard in\r\nsection 15-48-130(a)(2) of the South Carolina Code—not the FAA—and Appellant\r\nfailed to raise this issue below. Accordingly, it is not preserved for appellate\r\nreview. See Herron v. Century BMW, 395 S.C. 461, 465, 719 S.E.2d 640, 642\r\n(2011) (\"It is 'axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.'\"\r\n(quoting Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998))).\r\nMoreover, the presence of interstate commerce does not affect the applicability of\r\nstate law here. See Joseph v. Advest, Inc., 906 A.2d 1205, 1209-11 (Pa. Super. Ct.\r\n2006) (finding state law applies even in the presence of interstate commerce so\r\nlong as the particular provision of state law \"does not conflict with the FAA's\r\npurpose of expeditious resolution of legal matters through arbitration\"). Thus, our\r\n\narbitration award to be set aside where there was \"evident partiality by an arbitrator\r\nappointed as a neutral . . . prejudicing the rights of any party.\" S.C. Code § 15-48-\r\n130(a)(2). We have no South Carolina precedent construing this standard.\r\nAlthough there are some differences between the language of the SCUAA and the\r\nFederal Arbitration Act (FAA),10 both provide for an arbitration award to be\r\nvacated upon a showing of \"evident partiality.\" See 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(2) (an\r\narbitration award may be vacated upon the application of any party \"where there\r\nwas evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators\"). Given the absence of state-\r\nlaw precedent interpreting section 15-48-130(a)(2), we find it is appropriate in this\r\ninstance to look to federal interpretations of the FAA's \"evident partiality\" standard\r\nfor guidance in interpreting the South Carolina statute.\r\n\r\nThe plain language of section 15-48-130(a)(2) requires a party to show partiality\r\nthat is \"evident\"—namely, that which is \"direct, definite, and capable of\r\ndemonstration.\" Andersons, Inc. v. Horton Farms, Inc., 166 F.3d 308, 329 (6th\r\nCir. 1998) (construing the FAA's analogous \"evident partiality\" provision). \"The\r\nword 'evident' suggests that the statute requires more than a vague appearance of\r\nbias.\" Freeman v. Pittsburgh Glass Works, LLC, 709 F.3d 240, 253 (3d Cir. 2013).\r\n\"[T]he arbitrator's bias must be sufficiently obvious that a reasonable person would\r\neasily recognize it.\" Id. Therefore, to come within the statute's \"strong language\"\r\nrequiring a showing of \"evident partiality,\" the undisclosed facts must be\r\n\"powerfully suggestive of bias.\" Merit Ins. Co., 714 F.2d at 681.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the \"strong language\" of section 15-48-130(a)(2) requiring\r\narbitral bias to be \"evident,\" the circuit court found the proper legal standard for\r\nevaluating claims of evident partiality was whether the undisclosed facts might\r\n\"create an appearance of partiality or bias.\" 11 This was error, for the analysis must\r\n\r\nreview concerns only the application of section 15-48-130 of the South Carolina\r\nCode.\r\n10   9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (2012).\r\n11In so finding, the circuit court relied heavily upon Schmitz v. Zilveti, 20 F.3d\r\n1043 (9th Cir. 1994). Schmitz represents a departure from prior cases decided by\r\nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. See, e.g., Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n\r\nLocal Union No. 420 v. Kinney Air Conditioning Co., 756 F.2d 742, 746 (9th Cir.\r\n1985) (\"The party alleging evident partiality must establish specific facts which\r\nindicate improper motives on the part of the [arbitrator]. The appearance of\r\nimpropriety, standing alone, is insufficient.\"). As noted by the Fifth Circuit Court\r\n\nbegin with the language of the section 15-48-130(a)(2), and particularly the\r\nrequirement that an arbitrator's partiality be \"evident.\" See State v. Whitesides, 397\r\nS.C. 313, 317, 725 S.E.2d 487, 489 (2012) (citing Mid–State Auto Auction of\r\nLexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996)) (noting\r\n\"[t]he words of [a] statute must be given their ordinary meaning \"); Grimsley v.\r\nS.C. Law Enforcement Div., 396 S.C. 276, 281, 721 S.E.2d 423, 426 (2012) (\"[A]\r\ncourt must abide by the plain meaning of the words of a statute.\"). Plainly, the\r\nword \"evident\" requires a party to show something \"more than a vague appearance\r\nof bias.\" Freeman, 709 F.3d at 253 (distinguishing the legal standard embodied in\r\nthe phrase \"evident partiality\" from the federal judicial standard requiring recusal\r\n\"if a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned\" (internal quotations\r\nomitted)). Thus, the language of section 15-48-130(a)(2) requires us to reject the\r\nappearance-of-bias standard applied by the circuit court. Further, although various\r\ncourts may articulate slightly different formulations, our research reveals that a\r\nclear majority of courts reject the appearance-of-bias standard.12\r\n\r\n\r\nof Appeals, as to the \"appearance of bias\" legal standard, \"Schmitz is an outlier.\"\r\nPositive Software Solutions, Inc. v. New Century Mortg. Corp., 476 F.3d 278, 283\r\n(5th Cir. 2007) (finding Schmitz constitutes an unwarranted extension of the\r\nlanguage of Commonwealth Coatings and noting that, \"[i]ronically, Schmitz's 'mere\r\nappearance' standard would make it easier for a losing party to challenge an\r\narbitration award for nondisclosure than for actual bias\"). Respondents urge this\r\nCourt to follow the circuit court in relying upon Schmitz and adopting a standard\r\nthat allows an evident partiality finding on the mere \"appearance of bias\" and \"an\r\nimpression of possible bias.\" For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we reject\r\nSchmitz and the appearance-of-bias standard urged by Respondents and adopted by\r\nthe circuit court.\r\n12 See, e.g., Freeman, 709 F.3d at 253 (\"An arbitrator is evidently partial only if a\r\nreasonable person would have to conclude that she was partial to one side.

In nondisclosure situations, \"[t]he\r\nquestion is whether the facts that were not disclosed suggest a material conflict of\r\ninterest.\" Scandinavian, 668 F.3d at 77.\r\n\r\n\"[F]or a relationship to be material, and therefore require disclosure, it must be\r\nsuch that a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator who failed\r\nto disclose it was partial to one side.\" Id. at 76 (internal citations and quotations\r\nomitted). In doing so, courts \"must focus on the question of how strongly that\r\n[undisclosed] relationship tends to indicate the possibility of bias in favor of or\r\nagainst one party, and not on how closely that relationship appears to relate to the\r\nfacts of the arbitration.\" Id. at 75. \"[E]ven if a particular relationship might be\r\nthought to be relevant to the arbitration at issue, that relationship will nevertheless\r\nnot constitute a material conflict of interest if it does not itself tend to show that the\r\narbitrator might be predisposed in favor of one (or more) of the parties.\" Id. at 75-\r\n76 (internal citation and quotations omitted).\r\n\nWe now examine the ANR Coal factors alongside the findings of the circuit court,\r\nbeginning with the factors concerning the nature and extent of the relationship and\r\nthe directness of the undisclosed relationship to the arbitration proceedings. In\r\nfinding Respondents proved evident partiality, the circuit court acknowledged that\r\nGS2 was not a party to the arbitration. However, because the underlying dispute\r\nwas centered around GS2's performance as a subcontractor and representatives of\r\nGS2 served as Appellant's expert witnesses during arbitration, the circuit court\r\nconcluded that \"the arbitrator had a personal interest in avoiding an award that\r\nimpugned the professional integrity of the company managed by his law partner's\r\nbrother.\" This finding is wholly unsupported by any objective fact in the record.\r\n\r\nThe facts here do not give rise to any objective finding of partiality. It is\r\nuncontroverted the arbitrator was unaware of the undisclosed relationship until\r\nseveral months after the arbitration award was made. In any event, the mere\r\nexistence of this relationship alone does not establish bias and cannot, without\r\nmore, demonstrate evident partiality, notwithstanding the fact that it may appear to\r\nrelate to the facts of the arbitration. See Scandinavian, 668 F.3d at 75 (noting the\r\nanalysis does not turn on whether the undisclosed relationship \"appears to relate to\r\nthe facts of the arbitration\"); ANR Coal, 173 F.3d at 500-01 (\"[M]ere nondisclosure\r\ndoes not in itself justify vacatur.\"). Although it would have been preferable for the\r\narbitrator to have discovered and disclosed the relationship, under these facts,\r\nvacatur was not required. Regarding the connection of the relationship to the\r\narbitration, as previously noted, GS2 was not a party to the arbitration proceedings\r\nand the arbitrator has no direct relationship with Jayson Floyd, the GS2 employee.\r\nThe undisclosed relationship is tenuous and remote, and we find the failure to\r\ndisclose it is not \"inconsistent with impartiality.\" Scandinavian, 668 F.3d at 72.\r\n\r\nFurther, the challenge in ANR Coal involved the arbitrator's relationship to a party\r\nto the arbitration—not merely to an entity that is a third-party defendant in the\r\nunderlying litigation and employs several factual and expert witnesses who\r\ntestified during the proceedings. While an arbitrator's undisclosed relationship\r\nwith a non-party witness may, in an appropriate case, serve as the basis for a\r\nfinding of evident partiality, the probability of bias must be objectively\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to \"the proximity in time between the relationship and the arbitration\r\nproceeding,\" there is evidence in the record that Jayson Floyd was employed by\r\nGS2 before and during the time of the arbitration proceedings. However, Jayson\r\nFloyd was not employed by GS2 during the time GS2 performed work on the\r\nconstruction project. Indeed, the project was substantially complete by December\r\n\n2008, and Jayson Floyd was not hired by GS2 until August 2009. Moreover, we\r\nreiterate the uncontroverted fact that based on the record before us the arbitrator\r\nwas unaware of the relationship at the time the award was rendered. Thus, it\r\nwould be unreasonable for this Court to assume that the arbitrator reached his\r\ndecision as a result of some sort of predisposition in favor of GS2; we therefore\r\ndecline to do so. See Overseas Private Inv. Corp. v. Anaconda Co., 418 F. Supp.\r\n107, 112 (D.D.C. 1976) (\"When the existence of a potentially prejudicial\r\nrelationship is not known to an arbitrator, there is no possible way in which the\r\nrelationship can affect his decision.\").\r\n\r\nRespondents have not met their burden of showing specific facts, directly or\r\ncircumstantially, which demonstrate the arbitrator acted in a partial or biased\r\nmanner. See ANR Coal, 173 F.3d at 501 (citing U.S. Wrestling Fed'n v. Wrestling\r\nDiv. of AAU, Inc., 605 F.2d 313 (7th Cir. 1979)) (holding an arbitrator's connection\r\nwith a non-party did not constitute evident partiality even though the non-party had\r\na relationship with a party to the arbitration); Cook Indus., Inc. v. C Itoh & Co.,\r\n449 F.2d 106 (2nd Cir. 1971) (upholding arbitration award even though one\r\narbitrator was an employee of a company who had a major supply contract with a\r\nparty to the arbitration). Just as the Fourth Circuit observed in ANR Coal, \"it is\r\ndifficult to understand how the facts of this case demonstrate any 'personal interest'\r\non [the arbitrator]'s part.\" ANR Coal, 173 F.3d at 502.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court misapprehended the burden of proof by seemingly requiring\r\nAppellant to disprove evident partiality, yet the circuit court's erroneous burden of\r\nproof allocation is one that naturally flows from an \"appearance of bias\" and \"an\r\nimpression of possible bias\" standard. The burden of proof lies with the party\r\nseeking to have the arbitration award set aside. Here, instead of establishing\r\nspecific facts indicating the arbitrator's bias or improper motives, Respondents\r\nsimply showed that the arbitrator failed to disclose that one of his law partners has\r\na brother who is employed by GS2.13 From this remote and attenuated\r\nrelationship, Respondents embarked on a campaign of nefarious speculation.\r\n\r\nEvident partiality, as a statutory ground to vacate an arbitration award, requires a\r\nstrong and objective showing of probable arbitrator bias. No case we have\r\n\r\n13 We do appreciate that proof of bias will rarely be obvious and straightforward.\r\nThe proof may often be circumstantial, with reliance on reasonable inferences. But\r\na mere appearance of bias is not enough. A circuit court, of course, has the\r\ndiscretion to grant discovery where warranted. In this case, Respondents did not\r\nseek to conduct discovery.\r\n\ndiscovered in research or briefs has vacated an arbitration award for nondisclosure\r\nof such an obscure, tenuous relationship as the one here. See ANR Coal, 173 F.3d\r\nat 502 (finding the arbitrator's failure to disclose attenuated connections between\r\nhis law firm and a party did not constitute evident partiality and did not permit\r\nnullification of the arbitration award, even if it violated AAA's arbitration rules);\r\nAl-Harbi v. Citibank, N.A., 85 F.3d 680, 682 (D.C. Cir 1996) (finding no evident\r\npartiality demonstrated by fact that the arbitrator's former law firm had represented\r\nthe prevailing party in matters unrelated to the arbitration); Peabody v. Rotan\r\nMosle, Inc., 677 F. Supp. 1135, 1139 (M.D. Fla. 1987) (where the brother of the\r\narbitrator's law partner was once the personal attorney of a witness to the\r\narbitration proceeding, the arbitration award was not vacated as the claimed basis\r\nwas \"remote, uncertain and speculative claim of bias, not enough to establish\r\nevident partiality\"); Sofia Shipping Co., Ltd. v. Amoco Transp. Co., 628 F. Supp.\r\n116, 122 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (finding that the arbitrator's failure to disclose his\r\nrelationship with an employee and witness for the plaintiff, without specific proof\r\nof bias, did not show evident partiality and stating \"[t]he fact that there is an\r\noverlap in the relations of the individuals involved does not in itself provide\r\ngrounds for vacating an award\"); Dowd v. First Omaha Sec. Corp., 495 N.W.2d\r\n36, 42 (Neb. 1993) (rejecting evident partiality claim where the arbitrator had a\r\nlawsuit pending against employer of party's expert witness and noting district\r\ncourt's factual finding that arbitrator had no duty to disclose the lawsuit and\r\narbitrator's \"interest, if any was de minimis\"). Therefore, we conclude the circuit\r\ncourt's decision to set aside the arbitration award under these circumstances\r\nconstitutes reversible error.\r\n\r\nHowever, in so holding, we caution that:\r\n\r\n      We do not in any way wish to demean the importance of timely and\r\n      full disclosure by arbitrators. Disclosure not only enhances the actual\r\n      and apparent fairness of the arbitral process, but it helps to ensure that\r\n      that process will be final, rather than extended by proceedings like this\r\n      one. We again reiterate Justice White's observation that it is far better\r\n      for a potential conflict of interest \"to be disclosed at the outset\" than\r\n      for it to \"come to light after the arbitration, when a suspicious or\r\n      disgruntled party can seize on it as a pretext for invalidating the\r\n      award.\"\r\n\r\nScandinavian, 668 F.3d at 78 (quoting Commonwealth Coatings, 393 U.S. at 151\r\n(White, J., concurring)).\r\n\nAn arbitrator's duty to disclose all material information is an important one, critical\r\nto ensure the fundamental fairness of the arbitral proceedings. However, given the\r\nstrong showing required to set aside an award and the weighty policy goals in\r\nfavor of arbitration, the facts of this case simply do not justify vacatur under\r\nsection 15-48-130(a)(2).                 IV.\r\nThe evidence compels only one conclusion—the arbitrator was not evidently\r\npartial towards GS2 or either party. While the evident partiality standard certainly\r\nhas efficacy, it should not be invoked where, as here, the showing of partiality is\r\nnothing more than mere speculation. We reverse and remand to the circuit court\r\nfor confirmation of the arbitration award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, J., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and D.

Holmes, of Gibbs & Holmes, of Charleston, for\r\n              Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office\r\nof Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent\r\n(Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of a definite suspension of nine months to three years, with\r\nconditions. Respondent requests that the suspension be imposed retroactively to\r\nJanuary 25, 2012, the date he was placed on interim suspension.1 We accept the\r\nAgreement and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for nine\r\nmonths, subject to certain conditions. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are\r\nas follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1In re Holmes, 396 S.C. 597, 723 S.E.2d 809 (2012)(respondent placed on interim suspension\r\nafter being arrested and charged with possession with intent to distribute heroin).\r\n\n                                             Facts\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was arrested on December 27, 2011, and was charged with possession\r\nwith intent to distribute heroin. Although the criminal charge was conditionally\r\ndismissed, respondent admits he was in possession of 1.4 grams of heroin and was\r\nan active user of illegal drugs at the time of his arrest.2\r\n\r\nBy way of affidavit, respondent states he recognizes he has suffered from addiction\r\nfor a long time and that complete abstinence from alcohol and illegal drugs is the\r\nkey to his success. Respondent has undergone detoxification and completed\r\nresidential treatment programs as well as an intensive outpatient treatment\r\nprogram. The medical director of one of these programs has submitted an affidavit\r\nlending his support to respondent and respondent's return to the practice of law.\r\nRespondent states he regularly attends and actively participates in Alcoholics\r\nAnonymous (AA), and his AA sponsor, by way of affidavit, has also stated he\r\nsupports respondent and respondent's return to the practice of law. In addition,\r\nrespondent states he abstains from alcohol and drug use and has submitted to\r\nfrequent drug tests over the last year and a half, the results of which have all been\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nRespondent states he recognizes the seriousness of his offense and the gravity of\r\nhis current situation and realizes, in hindsight, that this experience, though\r\ndifficult, has been positive, as it has allowed him to address his addiction and to\r\nassist others who are suffering from addictive illnesses. However, respondent\r\nemphasizes his addictive illness is no excuse for his misconduct, for which he\r\naccepts full responsibility. Respondent also accepts responsibility for the fact that\r\nhis misconduct has harmed the public perception of the legal profession.\r\nRespondent has submitted the affidavits of a number of established members of the\r\nSouth Carolina Bar who state they support respondent and his return to the legal\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2In his affidavit, respondent states he was actively addicted to opiate painkillers, primarily\r\noxycodone, and had begun using heroin during the month prior to his arrest when he could not\r\nobtain oxycodone. Appellant explains he has a long history of addictive illness, and this was a\r\nculmination of years of alcohol and drug use.\r\n\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 8.4(b)(it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that reflects\r\nadversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other\r\nrespects) and Rule 8.4(c)(it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a\r\ncriminal act involving moral turpitude). Respondent also admits he has violated\r\nthe following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding\r\nprofessional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5)(it shall be a ground for\r\ndiscipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of\r\njustice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct\r\ndemonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\n\r\n                                    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe hereby accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend\r\nrespondent from the practice of law in this state for nine months, retroactive to\r\nJanuary 25, 2012, the date of his interim suspension. In addition, respondent shall\r\n1) enter into and fully comply with a contract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers\r\n(LHL), beginning with the date of this opinion, and upon reinstatement, renew the\r\ncontract for three years; 2) fully comply with appropriate treatment for his\r\naddiction for three years from the date of reinstatement; 3) for three years from the\r\ndate of reinstatement, submit three reports to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct\r\n(CLC) each quarter, including an affidavit of compliance with the terms of his\r\nLHL contract and with the recommendations of his treatment provider, a statement\r\nfrom his LHL monitor regarding respondent's compliance with the LHL contract,\r\nand a report of respondent's diagnosis, treatment compliance, and prognosis from\r\nrespondent's treatment provider; 4) after the three year period, have his progress\r\nand compliance reviewed by an investigative panel of the CLC to determine\r\nwhether the LHL contract and reporting requirements should be renewed, and if so,\r\nfor how long; and 5) upon reinstatement, limit his practice to working for a law\r\nfirm or other organization for at least one year and if at the conclusion of that year\r\nhe desires to become a solo practitioner, he will be permitted to do so only upon\r\nthe approval of an investigative panel of the CLC. Within fifteen days of the date\r\nof this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\nthat he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27302","title":"State v.

We dismiss the appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n1   S.C. Code §§ 16-11-410 to -450 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\n                                      FACTS\n\r\nOn October 27, 2005, Tavares World, an acquaintance of Appellant's, asked\r\nAppellant to help him get money the victim owed to him. According to Appellant,\r\nhe refused until World pointed a gun at him2 and threatened to kill him if he did\r\nnot accompany World to the victim's apartment. Thereafter, Appellant agreed, and\r\nWorld gave him the .380 caliber handgun.\r\n\r\nThe victim was not at home when Appellant and World first arrived at the victim's\r\napartment,3 so the pair waited in World's vehicle in the parking lot for fifteen to\r\ntwenty minutes before seeing the victim returned home. After the victim returned,\r\nAppellant and World remained in the vehicle for an additional ten to fifteen\r\nminutes before again approaching the victim's apartment.\r\n\r\nWhen Appellant and World subsequently arrived at the victim's apartment door,\r\nWorld beat on and kicked the door to the victim's apartment until it opened. World\r\nentered the victim's apartment yelling \"where my money at?,\" while Appellant\r\ninitially remained outside. During the ensuing fight between World and the victim,\r\nAppellant entered the victim's apartment and attempted to intervene. When\r\nAppellant's attempts to diffuse the situation were unsuccessful, Appellant exited\r\nthe victim's apartment but remained nearby, directly outside the apartment's door.\r\nThereafter, Appellant saw World running from the victim's apartment with the\r\nvictim chasing him. Although Appellant had not seen World or the victim draw a\r\ngun during the altercation, Appellant subsequently drew the .380 caliber handgun\r\nWorld had given him and shot the victim three times. The victim fell to the ground\r\nand died. World and Appellant then fled the apartment and were not apprehended\r\nuntil 2012.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 According to Appellant, World was armed with two guns—a nine millimeter and\r\na .380 caliber handgun.\r\n3 According to Appellant, upon initially arriving at the victim's apartment complex,\r\nAppellant and World got out of the car and \"walked by the [victim]'s house . . .\r\nlooking all through the windows.\"\r\n4 Appellant was arrested in April 2012 after a fingerprint found on a lamp inside\r\nthe victim's apartment matched Appellant's. Despite Appellant's contention that he\r\nagreed to accompany World only as a result of duress, at no time in the intervening\r\nseven years did Appellant contact law enforcement regarding the incident.\r\n\nAppellant was indicted for murder, first degree burglary, attempted armed robbery,\r\nand criminal conspiracy. At the beginning of trial, Appellant moved for a hearing\r\nto determine whether he was immune from prosecution under the Act. Despite\r\nAppellant's contention that he was not afforded a hearing, the able trial judge held\r\na full hearing, at which Appellant testified, and determined the Act did not apply to\r\nthis case as a matter of law. Specifically, the trial judge found the intent of the Act\r\n\"is not to protect intruders and [afford] any immunity or protection to intruders or\r\nthose who might enter the dwelling of another to commit a criminal act.\"\r\nAccordingly, the trial judge denied Appellant's request for immunity.\r\n\r\n                                APPEALABILITY\r\nAppellant asserts the order of the trial judge denying his request for immunity\r\nunder the Act is immediately appealable. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe right to appeal a criminal conviction is conferred by section 14-3-330 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code. In order to exercise the right to appeal, a defendant must\r\ncome within the terms of the statute. State v. Miller, 289 S.C. 426, 427, 346 S.E.2d\r\n705, 706 (1986). An order denying a request for immunity under the Act does not\r\nfall within any category of orders which are immediately appealable under section\r\n14-3-330.\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 14-3-330, an immediate appeal may be taken in a law case\r\nfrom: (1) Any intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case\r\n      involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of common\r\n      pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or\r\n      removed there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final\r\n      judgments in such actions; provided, that if no appeal be taken until\r\n      final judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from such final\r\n      judgment review any intermediate order or decree necessarily\r\n      affecting the judgment not before appealed from;\r\n\r\n      (2) An order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such\r\n      order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from\r\n      which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action, (b) grants\r\n      or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or\r\n      any pleading in any action;\r\n\n      (3) A final order affecting a substantial right made in any special\r\n      proceeding or upon a summary application in any action after\r\n      judgment; and\r\n\r\n      (4) An interlocutory order or decree in a court of common pleas\r\n      granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing an injunction or granting,\r\n      continuing, modifying, or refusing the appointment of a receiver.\r\n\r\nThis Court concluded in State v. Duncan, 392 S.C. 404, 709 S.E.2d 662 (2011),\r\nthat an order granting a motion to dismiss on the ground that the defendant is\r\nimmune under the Act is immediately appealable. Although we indicated in\r\nDuncan that an immediate appeal is allowed because the order is in the nature of\r\nan injunction, we now clarify that an order granting a request for immunity under\r\nthe Act is immediately appealable because it is a final order in the case.5 However,\r\nan order denying a request for immunity is not a final order in the case.\r\n\r\nAn order involving the merits \"must finally determine some substantial matter\r\nforming the whole or a part of some cause of action or defense.\" Mid-State\r\nDistrib., Inc. v. Century Imp., Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 334, 426 S.E.2d 777, 780 (1993).\r\nAn order denying an immunity request is not an order involving the merits in that it\r\ndoes not finally determine a substantial cause of action or defense. Accordingly, it\r\nis not immediately appealable under section 14-3-330(1).\r\n\r\nFurther, an order denying a motion to dismiss under the Act is not an interlocutory\r\norder or decree in a court of common pleas granting, continuing, modifying, or\r\nrefusing an injunction or granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing the\r\nappointment of a receiver under section 14-3-330(4).\r\n\r\nThis Court has held that, generally, a criminal defendant may not appeal until\r\nsentence is imposed. See In re Lorenzo B., 307 S.C. 439, 439, 415 S.E.2d 795\r\n(1992) (an order adjudicating a juvenile delinquent is not appealable until\r\nimposition of final judgment at the dispositional hearing); Parsons v. State, 289\r\n\r\n5 We note that an injunction is an equitable remedy available only when there is no\r\nadequate remedy at law. See Strategic Res. Co. v. BCS Life Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 540,\r\n545, 627 S.E.2d 687, 689 (2006) (noting an appeal is an adequate remedy at law,\r\nwhich precludes injunctive relief). Further, a criminal action is one at law and one\r\nwhich can be appealed following conviction and sentencing. See State v. Thrift,\r\n312 S.C. 282, 292, 440 S.E.2d 341, 347 (1994) (noting a criminal action is one at\r\nlaw); State v. Miller, 289 S.C. 426, 346 S.E.2d 705 (1986) (noting that a criminal\r\ndefendant may appeal after a sentence has been imposed).\r\n\nS.C. 542, 542, 347 S.E.2d 504, 504 (1986) (denial of bail pending trial is not\r\nimmediately appealable); Miller, 289 S.C. at 427, 346 S.E.2d at 706 (denial of a\r\nclaim of double jeopardy is not immediately appealable); State v. Washington, 285\r\nS.C. 457, 458, 330 S.E.2d 289, 289 (1985) (a conviction at a trial in absentia prior\r\nto imposition of sentence is not immediately appealable); State v. Dingle, 279 S.C.\r\n278, 282, 306 S.E.2d 223, 225 (1983), abrogated on other grounds, Horton v.\r\nCalifornia, 496 U.S. 128 (1990) (an order committing the defendant to the\r\nDepartment of Mental Health is not immediately appealable); State v. Hubbard,\r\n277 S.C. 568, 569, 290 S.E.2d 817, 817 (1982) (the denial of a motion to suppress\r\nevidence is not immediately appealable ); State v. Lockhart, 275 S.C. 160, 161, 267\r\nS.E.2d 720, 720 (1980) (an order transferring jurisdiction over a juvenile from\r\nfamily court to general sessions court is not immediately appealable); State v.\r\nParker, 267 S.C. 317, 323, 227 S.E.2d 677, 679 (1976) (the denial of a motion to\r\nquash an indictment is not immediately appealable).\r\n\r\nAs stated in State v. Hughes:\r\n\r\n      It is a bad practice, and generally condemned, to hear appeals by\r\n      piecemeal, especially in criminal cases; for it is destructive of the\r\n      prompt administration of justice, which is so essential to the peace of\r\n      society. To allow appeals to be heard from such preliminary rulings\r\n      would enable a party charged with the most serious crime always to\r\n      secure a continuance, when otherwise not entitled to it, by simply\r\n      moving to quash the indictment, and, when his motion is overruled,\r\n      give notice of appeal from such ruling, and thereby stop the trial . . . .\r\n\r\n56 S.C. 540, 35 S.E. 214, 215 (1900).\r\n\r\nThe denial of a request for immunity under the Act is analogous to the denial of a\r\nmotion to dismiss a criminal case on the ground of double jeopardy, which is not\r\nimmediately appealable. Miller, 289 S.C. at 427, 346 S.E.2d at 706. Absent an\r\nunambiguous expression of legislative intent, we see no reason to alter settled law\r\nconcerning appealability, which additionally would have the illogical effect of\r\nelevating a statutory immunity claim over one constitutionally based.\r\n\r\nAppellant cites State v. Marin, Op. No. 5156 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 3, 2013), for\r\nhis argument that he cannot preserve the issue for review unless he immediately\r\nappeals the ruling of the trial judge in this matter. However, Marin does not\r\nrequire an immediate appeal from the denial of a request for immunity. That\r\ndecision refers only to the fact that the determination is made prior to trial. The\r\nMarin decision does not purport to create a right to an immediate appeal when the\r\n\ncircuit court determines a defendant is not entitled to immunity. Instead, any error\r\nin the denial of a request for immunity from prosecution may be raised on appeal\r\nafter conviction and sentencing based on the plain language of section 14-3-330(1).\r\n\r\nThe concurring opinion claims the General Assembly clearly manifested its intent\r\nin the Act to dictate an immediate appeal from the denial of a motion for\r\nimmunity, transforming the Act's purpose in finding an unmistakable expression of\r\nlegislative intent to mandate an immediate appeal from the denial of an accused's\r\nmotion pursuant to the Act. In doing so, the concurrence suggests that the\r\nprefatory language of the Act allows this Court to interpret section 14-3-330 to\r\ncreate a nonexistent right to immediate appeal based on a denial of immunity under\r\nthe Act. We have no quarrel with the concurring opinion's reading of the purpose\r\nof the Act. However, we do part company with the concurrence in its\r\nextrapolation of a legislatively mandated immediate appeal from the denial of an\r\nimmunity motion under the Act. The suggestion that such legislative intent is clear\r\nfrom the statutory language borders on frivolity. Indeed, there are many matters on\r\nwhich the Act is silent, which this Court sought to answer in State v. Duncan, 392\r\nS.C. 404, 709 S.E.2d 662 (2011). As noted in Duncan, \"the Act does not explicitly\r\nprovide a procedure for determining immunity.\" If the concurring opinion's\r\nclairvoyance is correct, we invite the General Assembly to amend the Act to reflect\r\nits intent to allow an immediate appeal in clear terms.\r\n\r\nFurther, the concurring opinion's reliance on section 14-3-330(4), which allows an\r\nimmediate appeal from an order granting or denying an injunction, is misplaced as\r\nthat section only applies \"in the court of common pleas.\" Although the General\r\nAssembly specifically references the court of general sessions in section 14-3-\r\n330(1), it did not provide for immediate appeals in cases similar in nature to an\r\ninjunction in general sessions court. We cannot see how the legislative intent set\r\nforth in section 16-11-410 justifies the concurring opinion's extrapolation of the\r\nclear and unambiguous language in section 14-3-330(4), referring only to \"a court\r\nof common pleas,\" to also include a court of general sessions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the language in State v. Duncan addressing appealability was dicta\r\nand regrettable. We, therefore, clarify State v. Duncan, and hold the denial of a\r\nrequest for immunity under the Act is not immediately appealable. 6\r\n\r\n\r\n6 In light of the concurring opinion's reference to extraordinary writs, we caution\r\nthe Bench and the Bar that such writs are aptly named, as they are intended only\r\nfor the most extraordinary and exceptional situations. See In re Breast Implant\r\nProd. Liab. Litig., 331 S.C. at 543, 503 S.E.2d at 447 (\"Although we will not\r\n\n                                 RETROACTIVITY\r\nAlthough Appellant was not arrested until April 2012, and his trial did not\r\ncommence until July 8, 2013, the crimes with which he was charged were\r\ncommitted on October 27, 2005. The effective date of the Act is June 9, 2006.\r\nAppellant contends that the Act should be applied retroactively since his trial\r\nbegan after the effective date of the Act.\r\n\r\nThe retrospective application of a statute is not favored, and statutes are presumed\r\nto be prospective in effect. State v. Dickey, 380 S.C. 384, 404, 669 S.E.2d 917,\r\n928 (Ct. App. 2008), rev'd on other grounds, 394 S.C. 491, 716 S.E.2d 97 (2011).\r\nLegislative intent is paramount in determining whether a statute will have\r\nprospective or retroactive application. Jenkins v. Meares, 302 S.C. 142, 146, 394\r\nS.E.2d 317, 319 (1990). A statute is not to be applied retroactively unless that\r\nresult is so clearly compelled as to leave no room for doubt. Am. Nat. Fire Ins. Co.\r\nv. Smith Grading & Paving, 317 S.C. 445, 448, 454 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995).\r\n\r\nAs stated by the Court of Appeals in State v. Bolin, 381 S.C. 557, 673 S.E.2d 885\r\n(Ct. App. 2009), there is no evidence of legislative intent that the Act be applied\r\nretroactively. Instead, the savings clause of the Act specifically indicates the\r\nGeneral Assembly's intent that the Act be applied prospectively. Section 4 of the\r\nAct provides:\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerally accept matters on a writ of certiorari that can be entertained in the trial\r\ncourt or on appeal, a writ of certiorari may be issued when exceptional\r\ncircumstances exist.\"). We stress that denial of immunity under the Act will not\r\nmeet this high threshold absent a showing of truly extraordinary circumstances,\r\nand we seek to discourage unsuccessful defendants from seeking such writs.\r\n\r\nWe further note that, in South Carolina, a writ of prohibition is not an appropriate\r\nremedy for criminal defendants denied immunity under the Act. This is so because\r\n\"it has been settled in this state from an early period that . . . if the inferior court or\r\ntribunal has jurisdiction of the person and subject-matter of the controversy, the\r\nwrit [of prohibition] will not lie to correct errors and irregularities in procedure, or\r\nto prevent an erroneous decision . . . .\" New South Life Ins. Co. v. Lindsay, 258\r\nS.C. 198, 199-200, 187 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1972) (quoting Ex Parte Jones, 160 S.C.\r\n63, 158 S.E. 134, 137 (1931)). \"There is no dispute that the circuit court qualifies\r\nas a court of general criminal jurisdiction under the South Carolina Constitution.\"\r\nState v. Odom, 382 S.C. 144, 150, 676 S.E.2d 124, 127 (2009) (citing S.C. Const.\r\nart. V, § 11).\r\n\n      The repeal or amendment by this act of any law, whether temporary or\r\n      permanent or civil or criminal, does not affect pending actions, rights,\r\n      duties, or liabilities founded thereon, or alter, discharge, release or\r\n      extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under the\r\n      repealed or amended law, unless the repealed or amended provision\r\n      shall so expressly provide. After the effective date of this act, all laws\r\n      repealed or amended by this act must be taken and treated as\r\n      remaining in full force and effect for the purpose of sustaining any\r\n      pending or vested right, civil action, special proceeding, criminal\r\n      prosecution, or appeal existing as of the effective date of this act, and\r\n      for the enforcement of rights, duties, penalties, forfeitures, and\r\n      liabilities as they stood under the repealed or amended laws.\r\n\r\nAct No. 379, § 4, 2006 S.C. Acts 2913.\r\n\r\nThis identical savings clause was the basis for this Court's decisions in State v.\r\nDawson, 402 S.C. 160, 740 S.E.2d 501 (2013), and State v. Brown, 402 S.C. 119,\r\n740 S.E.2d 493 (2013). In both Dawson and Brown, we held the General\r\nAssembly did not intend for amended versions of statutes defining crimes and the\r\npenalties to be applied retroactively; rather, the law in effect at the time the crimes\r\nwere committed controlled. Similarly, by stating that the Act is to have no effect\r\non pending actions, criminal prosecutions, rights, duties, or liabilities, and that all\r\nlaws repealed or amended by the Act must be treated as remaining in full force and\r\neffect, the General Assembly clearly specified the Act is to be applied\r\nprospectively.\r\n\r\nBecause the savings clause indicates the General Assembly did not intend for the\r\nAct to affect the rights and liabilities in effect prior to its enactment, Appellant\r\ncannot claim the benefit of the extension of the law.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\nBecause the General Assembly did not intend for the Act to apply to a shooting\r\nthat occurred prior to the Act's effective date and because the denial of a\r\ndefendant's request for immunity under the Act is an interlocutory order not subject\r\nto immediate appeal, this appeal is dismissed and the matter is remanded for trial.\r\n\r\nDISMISSED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, and HEARN, JJ., concur.                         PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in the decision to dismiss this appeal\r\nbecause the Act does not apply retroactively and thus appellant is not entitled\r\nto invoke its protections. E.g. State v. Dawson, 402 S.C. 160, 740 S.E.2d\r\n501(2013). I would hold, however, that a pretrial order denying immunity\r\nunder the Act is immediately appealable under S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-330\r\n(4) (Supp. 2012) because it is in the nature of an injunction.7\r\nThe General Assembly, as is its prerogative, has codified and modified what\r\nwas at common law a defense, and instructed that a person who establishes\r\nthat defense may not be criminally prosecuted. The legislature has\r\nunequivocally expressed its intent that persons who are rightfully within the\r\nAct's terms are immune from prosecution. Section 16-11-420 of the Act is\r\ntitled \"Intent and Findings of General Assembly,\" and provides in part:\r\n            The General Assembly finds that it is proper for law-\r\n            abiding citizens to protect themselves, their families, and\r\n            others from intruders and attackers without fear of\r\n            prosecution or civil action for acting in defense of\r\n            themselves and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n            § 16-11-420(B) (Supp. 2012) (emphasis supplied).\r\nLest there be any doubt of the legislature's intent, § 16-11-450 of the Act is\r\ntitled in part \"Immunity from criminal prosecution . . . .\" and provides in\r\nrelevant part \"A person who uses deadly force as permitted by the provisions\r\nof this article or another applicable provision of law is justified in using\r\ndeadly force and is immune from criminal prosecution . . . . \" § 16-11-\r\n450(A) (Supp. 2012) (emphasis supplied). In my view, we can honor the\r\nGeneral Assembly's clear mandate only if we can review any pre-trial denial\r\nof criminal immunity for reversible error, for to require a defendant wrongly\r\ndenied immunity to endure a criminal prosecution is to violate the statutory\r\ninjunction.\r\n\r\n\r\n7The Court of General Session has subject matter jurisdiction to issue injunctions\r\nwhere necessary to protect its proceedings. Ex parte: The State-Record Co., Inc.,\r\n332 S.C. 346, 504 S.E.2d 592 (1998).\r\n\nI readily acknowledge that an order denying a criminal defendant pre-trial\r\nimmunity does not fit neatly within our general appealability jurisprudence.\r\nIn order to effectuate the General Assembly's explicit instruction, I would\r\nread the term \"common pleas\" in § 14-3-330(4), allowing immediate appeals\r\nfrom injunctions, as \"trial court\" in order to permit this interlocutory appeal\r\nfrom the Court of General Sessions.8 This broad reading of the statute is not\r\nunique, however, as the appellate courts regularly apply § 14-3-330, which\r\nby its title only governs law cases, to equity matters arising from the family\r\ncourts. E.g. Terry v. Terry, 400 S.C. 453, 734 S.E.2d 646 (2012); Smith v.\r\nSmith, 359 S.C. 393, 597 S.E.2d 188 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIt is the legislature's prerogative to dictate appealability, and the intent that a\r\nperson within the Act's terms be immune from criminal prosecution is clear\r\nand unequivocal. I therefore respectfully dissent from the decision holding\r\nthat a criminal defendant denied immunity must nonetheless submit to\r\nprosecution and, if convicted, then seek review of the order denying him the\r\nvery protection afforded him under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 In light of the majority's decision that a pretrial order denying a criminal\r\ndefendant immunity under the Act is not immediately appealable, an individual in\r\nthat position may now seek relief by filing a common law petition for writ of\r\ncertiorari in this Court's original jurisdiction. E.g. City of Columbia v. S.C. Pub.\r\nServ. Comm'n, 242 S.C. 528, 131 S.E.2d 705 (1963). Depending on the\r\nindividual's circumstances, it is possible that she may invoke other extraordinary\r\nwrits to prevent her wrongful criminal prosecution.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27303","title":"State v.

Based on those events, Child's father, Billy\r\nWayne Cope, was convicted of murder, two counts of first degree criminal sexual\r\nconduct (CSC), criminal conspiracy, and unlawful conduct towards a child.1 The\r\ncourt of appeals affirmed Cope's convictions in State v. Cope, 385 S.C. 274, 684\r\nS.E.2d 177 (Ct. App. 2009). We granted certiorari to review the court of appeals'\r\nopinion and now affirm.\r\n\r\n                FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       The facts surrounding the sexual assault and murder of Child are graphic and\r\nprofoundly disturbing. Shortly after 6:00 a.m. on the morning of November 29,\r\n2001, Cope called 911 and reported finding Child dead in her bed, apparently from\r\nbeing choked by a piece of her blanket which was wrapped around her neck.\r\nWhen asked if she was breathing or if he had attempted CPR, Cope twice replied\r\nthat she was \"cold as a cucumber.\"\r\n\r\n       The response team arrived and Cope informed them his daughter was dead.\r\nWhen the medical technician asked how long she had been that way, he responded\r\n\"four hours.\"2 Cope also informed him that Child had a history of rolling in her\r\nsleep and she choked herself on her blanket.\r\n\r\n      Police examined the windows and doors and found no signs of forced entry.\r\nThe house itself was in \"extreme disarray,\" with clothes and boxes everywhere and\r\nroaches and cat feces throughout the house. Additionally, several responders noted\r\nthat Cope acted strangely and was on his computer when they arrived while his\r\ntwo other daughters were huddled on the couch.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Cope's co-defendant, James Sanders, was also convicted of murder, first degree \n\r\ncriminal sexual conduct, and criminal conspiracy and was sentenced to life \n\r\nimprisonment plus thirty years. His convictions were affirmed on appeal. State v.\n\r\nSanders, 388 S.C. 292, 696 S.E.2d 592 (Ct. App. 2009). He is not a party to this \n\r\nappeal.\n\r\n2 Cope contends he said, and meant, \"for hours,\" not \"four hours.\" \n\r\n\n       Cope was interviewed several times that day. In his first interview, Cope\r\ntold police that Child's Youngest Sister went to bed around 9:30 p.m., but he\r\nallowed Child and her Middle Sister to stay up later so Child could help Middle\r\nSister with math homework, and they went to bed around 12:30 a.m. Cope said he\r\nwoke up around 6:00 a.m. and called Child's name several times, but she did not\r\nanswer. He went to her room and found her lying on her back with a strip of her\r\nblanket wrapped around her neck. Youngest Sister and Middle Sister, who slept in\r\na separate bedroom, came to the doorway, and he told them to go to the living\r\nroom; then he called 911. Cope stated no one except the family had been in the\r\nhome that day and he did not hear any noises that night because he sleeps with a\r\nCPAP machine for his sleep apnea as well as several fans. He agreed to\r\naccompany the police to the hospital so a rape kit could be performed and\r\nmentioned that his skin might be under Child's fingernails because she had\r\nscratched his back the night before.\r\n\r\n      When he was again interviewed around noon that day, he told police Child\r\nwent to bed at 1:00 a.m. Cope also stated that when Child failed to answer him\r\nthat morning, he initially thought \"the rapture\" had occurred and she had been\r\ntaken to heaven. He said he had to kick Child's bedroom door open because it was\r\njammed against her closet door. Cope again informed the police he thought her\r\ndeath was an accident because he did not hear any noise in the night.\r\n\r\n       Dr. James Maynard, the State's forensic pathologist who performed an\r\nautopsy on Child, placed her time of death between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. He\r\nnoted her clothing appeared as if it had been placed upon her by another person,\r\nwith her bra unhooked and her pants not pulled up all the way. He noted she had\r\ninjuries to her head consistent with being struck repeatedly, and she had been\r\nmanually strangled. He further noted that the absence of ligature marks indicated\r\nshe had not been strangled by the blanket. Although Dr. Maynard found Child on\r\nher back, he stated it appeared she was turned several times after her death. He\r\nnoted she had injuries consistent with a 300-plus-pound man kneeling on top of\r\nher.3 Dr. Maynard further found Child had been brutally sexually assaulted, both\r\nvaginally and anally. He observed the severity of the injuries indicated they could\r\nnot have been inflicted by an erect penis, but must have been from a hard object,\r\n\r\n3   At the time of Child's death, Cope weighed approximately 385 pounds.\r\n\nsuch as a dildo or broom handle. Additionally, he noted Child had a bite mark on\r\none of her breasts. It also appeared she had been cleaned up after the assault.\r\n\r\n      Dr. Maynard observed that her hymen was absent, as were any remnants to\r\nindicate it had been torn during this incident. He stated she had vaginal irritation\r\nconsistent with past penetration. He further noted evidence of past anal\r\npenetration.\r\n\r\n       The police brought Cope back in for another interview that evening\r\nfollowing receipt of the autopsy results. Cope was apprised of some of the facts,\r\nincluding that Child had been sexually assaulted. This interview lasted over four\r\nhours and was recorded. This time, Cope stated he had gotten up at 3:00 a.m. to\r\nuse the bathroom and did not check on Child because her door was closed, but\r\nchecked on his other two daughters. Cope repeatedly denied any involvement in\r\nChild's death and requested that a polygraph test be performed. After the\r\ninterview, he was arrested and charged with murder as well as three counts of\r\nunlawful neglect for the deplorable condition of his home. Police arranged for him\r\nto take a polygraph test the following morning.\r\n\r\n      He met with the polygraph examiner, Michael Baker, around 10:00 a.m. the\r\nnext morning. During the exam, Baker asked: \"did you choke [Child]\"; \"did you\r\nchoke [Child] causing her to die\"; and \"were you in the room when [Child] died\"?\r\nCope answered each question in the negative. Baker scored the exam and\r\ndetermined Cope had not answered truthfully. According to Baker, Cope did not\r\nact surprised when he was informed he had failed the exam. Cope asked if he\r\ncould have done it in his sleep, and Baker responded that he did not think that was\r\npossible. Cope then stated he \"must have done it.\"\r\n\r\n       Cope then proceeded to confess to Baker. He stated he woke up around 3:00\r\na.m. and went to use the bathroom, after which \"he still had an erection,\" so he\r\nwalked into Child's room and began masturbating. Child woke up and said,\r\n\"Gross, daddy.\" Cope, enraged by her comment, jumped on top of her and began\r\nswinging his fists, hitting her in the head with his hands and a video game that was\r\nin the bed with her. He then began choking her with both hands and the blanket.\r\nHe stated that he used a broom to penetrate her both anally and vaginally.\r\nAlthough he acknowledged there was a dildo in the house, he stated he had not\r\nused it on Child. Cope then said he deleted some temporary files off his computer,\r\nthrew the dildo out the back door, and went to sleep. He could not remember what\r\nhe did with the broom. Cope signed a written statement memorialized by Baker,\r\n\nindicating at the end that \"these are the images that come into my mind.\" Cope\r\nshook hands with Baker after the interview, and Baker noted he seemed relieved to\r\nget the information off his chest.\r\n\r\n      Two days later, on December 2, Cope, who was in the county jail, requested\r\nto speak to the detectives again. He was transported to the sheriff's department the\r\nnext morning and gave the following handwritten statement:\r\n\r\n      I was asleep in my bed. I had a bad dream about an old girlfriend who\r\n      had an abortion. The thought of her makes me cringe. In my dream\r\n      she was telling me that I had an abortion with your child and I told her\r\n      no. I became so enraged that I got out of bed. All I could hear was\r\n      that laughing sound. I do not know what came over me, but I snapped\r\n      and I jumped on the bed and straddled [Child]. I hit her in the head\r\n      and started choking her. I did not know it was my own daughter until\r\n      after I had shoved the broom stick in her privates. I fell back jarring\r\n      me to my senses and I realized it was my daughter. I became so\r\n      confused that I tried to rid the house of all the stuff that would make\r\n      me look guilty. I grabbed the broom and I pulled it from her vagina. I\r\n      pulled her panties and pants up. I did not know it was my own\r\n      daughter until I fell backwards. The next morning at 6:03 when my\r\n      alarm and phone rang out I was hoping it was a very bad dream.\r\n\r\n       Cope was asked if he would be willing to return to his home, walk the police\r\nthrough, and explain what happened. Police stated he was very willing to do so\r\nand he only had to be asked once. The visit to Cope's residence was videotaped.\r\nThe video depicted the same version of the facts Cope had written in his second\r\nconfession to the police and included not just Cope's description of the events, but\r\nalso his reenactment. Cope also indicated in the video he had wrapped the blanket\r\naround her neck to make it seem like an accident. He was asked if his semen\r\nwould be found anywhere on the scene, and he said it would not.\r\n\r\n      Later that afternoon, Cope was again interrogated and was presented with\r\nsome of the facts police had discovered from Child's autopsy report, including the\r\npresence of semen. Cope admitted to having masturbated into a cloth and\r\ninformed the police where they could find it. The interrogation resulted in Cope\r\nsigning the following statement, memorialized by one of the detectives:\r\n\r\n      I woke up about three a.m. I went to the bathroom and I went into\r\n\n[Child's] room. I had a hard on. I jacked off in the floor and used a\r\nblue towel to clean it up. I started going into [Child's] room about the\r\nend of October through the first part of November playing with her\r\nand rubbing her and fingering her while she was asleep. [Child] was\r\nasleep on her stomach. I think the dildo inside her is what woke her\r\nup. When she woke up I jumped on top of her to keep her from\r\nturning and looking at me, then I heard her say, \"Daddy, help me.\" I\r\nstarted strangling her with my hands. [Child] was pulling at my hands\r\nand I let go and started hitting her in the head and I went back to\r\nstrangling her and she went limp. I got up, I saw the green string on\r\nthe blanket and I was thinking to myself this would look like she\r\nstrangled herself. I took the green strip and I wrapped it around her\r\nneck. I went straight with the wrap from off the floor and I wrapped it\r\naround her throat. I pulled both ends tight. I pulled both ends so it\r\nwould be good and tight. Her hands were already at her neck so I left\r\nthem. I jumped up off the bed and went and put the dildo up. I wiped\r\nit off first with the blue towel and then put it under the bed in the floor\r\nin the bedroom. Normally I put it between the mattress at the head of\r\nthe bed but it had fallen so I put it at the head of the bed on the floor\r\nwhere it was. Then I fixed the doors of [Child's] bedroom so that they\r\nwould lock. I pulled the closet and the door together, that's how I\r\nlocked it. I did this so the kids would not wake up and see her before\r\nmorning. I got back into my bed, I put my mask on, and went to\r\nsleep. And I woke up at 6:02 according to the clock in my bedroom.\r\nI sat up and called [Child] twice since now I knew that she was not\r\ngoing to answer. It was like a dream. I thought it was a dream. I did\r\nnot hear from [Child] those two times I called her, sir or yes, sir. I\r\nthought, I thought the rapture had just taken place because I had just\r\nfinished reading the Left Behind series about one month ago. I had\r\nhoped the rapture had taken place. I was praying it had. I got up and\r\nlooked in on [Youngest Sister] and [Middle Sister] and they were still\r\nasleep. I went to [Child's] door and I forgot I had set the doors so I\r\npushed on the doors and they would not open. I kicked the door open\r\nand saw [Child] laying there purple. I walked over to her and I tried\r\nto wake her and she was cold. I screamed and unwrapped the cord\r\nthat I put on her neck. [Youngest Sister] and [Middle Sister] walked\r\ninto the room and [Youngest Sister] started screaming. [Middle\r\nSister] said Daddy is she dead and I said yes go get on the couch and\r\npray as hard as you can and remember one thing she is with Jesus. I\r\n\n      ran to the telephone which is exactly in front of the computer and I\r\n      called 911. I said my daughter is dead and she is cold as a cucumber.\r\n      Reality had not set in. . . . . Not until today 12/03/01 have I realized\r\n      what I have done. Up until talking with you and the other [officer] I\r\n      blocked stuff out. I am telling the truth this time. Everything I said\r\n      before now is not true. When I put my fingers inside [Child] I pulled\r\n      her panties, pants and panties down and used my two fingers. I could\r\n      have jammed my hand down inside her. I remember I had watered\r\n      down jelly on my fingers. Around the first of October was when I\r\n      first started messing with [Child] at night while she was asleep and I\r\n      would go into her bedroom and finger her and use a dildo on her. I\r\n      did this many times.\r\n\r\n      The investigation against Cope proceeded; however, by the end of\r\nDecember, the police were aware that the DNA evidence obtained from Child's\r\nbody was not Cope's. At some point, the State determined the semen on Child's\r\npants and the saliva from the bite mark on her breast belonged to James Sanders.\r\nSanders was eventually also indicted in connection with Child's rape and murder\r\non January 22, 2004, and the State then charged both Cope and Sanders with\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\n      The case proceeded to a joint trial, the State's theory of the case being that\r\nCope \"served up his daughter for his and [] Sanders' own perverse pleasures and\r\ntook her life. They did it together. There is no other reasonable explanation.\"\r\n\r\n      In addition to presenting the confessions and autopsy report, the State called\r\nCope's other children to testify. Youngest Sister testified she heard someone\r\nscream and gasp for air in the middle of the night, but she thought it was a dream\r\nand went back to sleep. Middle Sister testified she and Child worked on her math\r\nhomework until around 1:00 a.m., when they went to bed. She claimed that, before\r\ngoing to bed, she and Child went around the house, turned off all the lights, and\r\nlocked the front door, including the chain latch.\r\n\r\n      The State also called Amy Simmons to testify. Simmons was a friend of the\r\nfamily who began exchanging letters with Cope while he was incarcerated. During\r\nthe course of these exchanges, Simmons testified she received a letter in May of\r\n2004 in which Cope wrote:\r\n\n      God told me to tell you that I killed [Child]. I have secretly\r\n      questioned God and I caught myself praising the Lord over the\r\n      ending. I got my feelings hurt when I talked to my attorneys the story\r\n      was not going to end on a happy note. [Child] is in the Lord [sic]\r\n      Streets. Standing over her I saw her scream. My girl was returned to\r\n      the spot where she belong [sic] and my enemies follow me scoffing. I\r\n      don't know which way that I should turn. I didn't realize what I did\r\n      until after Pastor Powell told me that she was dead. I just want to\r\n      know if God was trying to share with me before it happened. Please\r\n      forgive me. God is going to remove it soon. I wish that he had\r\n      creeped [sic] into my head and killed me instead.\r\n\r\n      How is [sic] Brian and Jaime? I don't know whether they remember\r\n      me or not. I hope you don't mind the drawing on the envelopes. I\r\n      hope that you are not mad or angry. I just thought you should know.\r\n      Please don't stop writing. I have to get on with my life I need to tell\r\n      you that a certain police woman as always came out victorious. May\r\n      God bless you with comfort today.\r\n\r\nThe State also called a handwriting expert to testify as to the authenticity of the\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n       In his defense, Cope presented expert testimony that the letters were\r\nforgeries as well as evidence that the paper the letters had been written on were not\r\navailable to inmates at the prison. Simmons was also impeached with evidence she\r\nhad criminal forgery charges pending against her and that she had consented to\r\ndiscipline by a nursing board for forging documents. Cope additionally called Dr.\r\nCharles Honts to testify as an expert in psychology, particularly in the polygraph.\r\nDr. Honts stated he disagreed with Baker's scoring of Cope's polygraph and opined\r\nhis scoring of the examination indicated Cope had been truthful.\r\n\r\n       Cope also presented expert testimony from Dr. Saul Kassin regarding false\r\nconfessions. Dr. Kassin discussed different indicia of innocence, such as waiving\r\nthe right to a lawyer, consenting to a physical exam, and volunteering to take a\r\npolygraph. He noted that false confessions appear remarkably like real\r\nconfessions, often including details and motive. Dr. Kassin testified that Cope had\r\nlikely lost all hope after having been interrogated for hours and repeatedly\r\nprofessing his innocence; once he learned he failed the polygraph test, it would\r\nhave shaken him. Dr. Kassin stated that when presented with false evidence\r\n\nindicating their guilt, people sometimes begin to doubt themselves and construct\r\nnew memories based on a belief in their own guilt. He mentioned there were cases\r\nwhere alleged murder victims turned up alive, cases where another perpetrator was\r\nfound who knew all the details of the crime, and cases where DNA evidence was\r\ndiscovered exonerating people who had confessed to committing those crimes.\r\n\r\n        Additionally, Cope called forensic pathologist Clay Nichols to testify. Dr.\r\nNichols opined the sexual injuries sustained by Child could have been inflicted\r\nwith an erect penis and that a 400-pound man thrusting a broom into Child's body\r\nwould have resulted in much more catastrophic injuries. Dr. Nichols further noted\r\nthat it was unlikely the dildo found on the scene had been used because it was less\r\nthan six inches long and Child's injuries indicated she had been penetrated by an\r\nobject between six to eight inches. In discussing Child's strangulation, he noted\r\nthat although it was unlikely the blanket had been used, he thought only one hand\r\nhad been used and that she was attacked from the front. He further opined that he\r\nfound no evidence to indicate chronic sexual abuse. Dr. Nichols also stated he did\r\nnot think her injuries were consistent with a 400-pound man jumping on her back.\r\n\r\n      Cope also presented the expert testimony of a locksmith that the front door\r\ncould have been opened with a credit card without leaving any marks. The\r\nlocksmith explained this was because the locking mechanism was a spring latch\r\nand not a dead latch.\r\n\r\n       Finally, Cope testified in his own defense. He stated that on the evening of\r\nChild's death, Youngest Sister had gone to bed at 9:30 p.m. and he had let Child\r\nand Middle Sister stay up until 1:00 a.m. working on Middle Sister's long division\r\nhomework. He said he awoke around 3:00 a.m. to go to the bathroom and then\r\ntried to play a game on the computer. When he woke the next morning and Child\r\ndid not answer when he called to her, he thought the rapture had taken her.\r\n\r\n       He stated that when he found her, she was not unclothed, just uncovered. He\r\nfurther testified they never put on the chain lock because his wife would sometimes\r\ncome home from work while everyone was asleep and she would not be able to get\r\nin the house. He also testified there was a flashlight found in Child's room that he\r\nhad never seen before.\r\n\r\n      Cope testified that during his police interview, the detectives continually\r\ninsinuated he knew more about the crime. He eventually began to insist on taking\r\na polygraph because he had taken two or three previously for work and he trusted\r\n\nthem. He then testified that once he was told he had failed the polygraph, he began\r\nto doubt himself. He stated he asked if he could have done it and not known about\r\nit because he had no memory, but he had been informed that the pathologist\r\nconcluded the rape was not done by a human penis, so he started putting images in\r\nhis head. He then described the images that came to him.\r\n\r\n       Cope further testified that once he was in jail, he realized he had falsely\r\nconfessed and the police would never believe him, so he tried to invent a second\r\nstory hoping they would just think he was crazy. He then concocted the confession\r\nwhere he purported to kill Child while dreaming about his ex-girlfriend. During\r\nhis subsequent interview, the detectives continued to point out the inconsistencies\r\nin his statements and threatened him with the death penalty if he did not finally tell\r\nthem the truth. Cope testified that by then, he did not care what happened\r\nanymore; he would have said anything and he willingly signed any statements he\r\nwas given. Cope also discussed the incriminating letters to Amy Simmons and\r\ndenied having ever written them.\r\n\r\n       The jury convicted Cope of murder, two counts of first degree CSC, criminal\r\nconspiracy to commit CSC, and unlawful conduct towards a child. He was\r\nsubsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, thirty years' imprisonment\r\nfor one of the CSC charges, to be served consecutively, and thirty years'\r\nimprisonment for the other count of CSC, ten years for unlawful neglect, and five\r\nyears for conspiracy, to be served concurrently.\r\n\r\n                              ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n  I.\t   Did the court of appeals err in upholding the trial court's refusal to admit\r\n        evidence of Sanders' other crimes and failure to sever the trials?\r\n\r\n II.\t   Did the court of appeals err in affirming the trial court's exclusion of\r\n        testimony offered to show Sanders had bragged to fellow inmates about\r\n        how he was going to get away with the murder and rape of \"a little girl in\r\n        Rock Hill\"?\r\n\r\nIII.\t   Did the court of appeals err in affirming the trial court's refusal to allow\r\n        Cope's false-confessions expert to specifically discuss factually similar\r\n        cases?\r\n\r\nIV.\t    Did the court of appeals err in affirming the trial court's denial of Cope's\r\n        motion for a directed verdict on the charge of criminal conspiracy?\r\n\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n  I.   EVIDENCE OF OTHER CRIMES\r\n\r\n      Cope argues the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial court's refusal to\r\nallow admission of evidence of Sanders' other crimes. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       In criminal cases, the appellate court sits solely to review errors of law.\r\nState v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006). \"The trial judge has\r\nconsiderable latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence and his decision\r\nshould not be disturbed absent prejudicial abuse of discretion.\" State v. Clasby,\r\n385 S.C. 148, 154, 682 S.E.2d 892, 895 (2009). An abuse of discretion occurs\r\nwhen the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law. State v. Washington, 379\r\nS.C. 120, 124, 665 S.E.2d 602, 604 (2008).\r\n\r\n       Cope's defense relied in part on the theory that Sanders acted alone. In\r\nsupport of this contention, Cope sought to establish Sanders was capable of\r\nentering the home without signs of forced entry by introducing evidence that\r\nSanders had committed similar crimes in Cope's neighborhood around the time of\r\nChild's assault. Prior to trial, Cope proffered the testimony of four other victims,\r\nwhich is summarized below.\r\n\r\n      First Incident: The victim testified that on December 12, 2001, at\r\napproximately 11:00 p.m., Sanders knocked on her door and asked to use her\r\nphone because he had car trouble. When she went to the door, Sanders pushed the\r\ndoor in and attacked her. Sanders carried her to the bedroom and laid her on the\r\nbed. He kissed her on the mouth and breasts and raped her. Sanders then asked\r\nher for money and the victim gave him twenty dollars from her pocketbook. The\r\nvictim was sixty years old.\r\n\r\n       Second Incident: The victim testified that on December 16, 2001, she had\r\nfallen asleep on the couch and woke up around 1:00 a.m. with Sanders standing\r\nover her. She screamed and Sanders put his hand over her mouth and trapped her\r\nunder a rocking chair. At the time, she was living in a second story apartment with\r\nher husband and three daughters, but her husband was out. She continued\r\nscreaming and her dog began to bark so one of her daughters ran in to see what\r\nwas wrong and Sanders then fled, jumping off her balcony. He had apparently\r\nentered through her unlocked patio door.\r\n\r\n       Third Incident: The victim testified she returned to her apartment, near\r\n\nCope's home, around 7:30 or 8:00 p.m. on December 19, 2001, and she\r\nimmediately went to the bathroom. After exiting the bathroom, the victim noticed\r\nher front door was cracked, and she walked towards the door to close it. A man,\r\nwho she later identified as Sanders in a photographic lineup, came through the\r\ndoor. The victim began fighting Sanders, and he tried to put a plastic bag over her\r\nhead, which she was able to claw through and remove. Sanders then tried to wrap\r\na rug around her head, and he turned her over on her stomach, pulled up her shirt,\r\nand attempted to unbuckle her belt. The victim grabbed a pen from her back\r\npocket and stabbed Sanders with it several times in his leg. Sanders shoved her\r\ninto a bedroom and fled. The victim stated she was twenty years old when the\r\nattack occurred. She testified he did not choke her. She also identified Sanders as\r\nthe perpetrator in court.\r\n\r\n       Fourth Incident: The victim testified she was renting a room in a house\r\nwithin a few blocks of Cope's home. Her bedroom connected to a bathroom that\r\nalso had a door that went into the kitchen. She testified she was watching a movie\r\nin her bed around midnight on January 12, 2002, when she heard a knock at her\r\nbathroom door. The victim asked who was there, and no one answered. She heard\r\nanother knock, again asked who was there, got out of bed, and walked toward the\r\nbathroom door, assuming it was one of her roommates. When she got to the door,\r\nSanders pushed it open, hitting the victim's head with the door. The two began\r\nfighting and moved to the kitchen, where Sanders pushed her to the ground and\r\nkicked and stomped on her back. Sanders put her in a choke hold and pulled her\r\noff the ground. She tried to punch Sanders, and he let her go briefly and threw her\r\nto the ground, kicking her again. While the victim was on the ground, Sanders\r\nwent back into the bedroom and grabbed her purse. She then grabbed a baking pan\r\nand hit Sanders in the head with it. The contents of her purse spilled out and the\r\nvictim grabbed her Mace; however, Sanders pushed her back down to the ground,\r\nand she sprayed most of the Mace on herself. The victim then grabbed a\r\nscrewdriver off the floor and began stabbing at Sanders, piercing his left shoulder\r\nand causing him to flee. She further testified there were no signs of forced entry,\r\nand neither she nor the police were able to determine how Sanders gained access to\r\nher house. The victim was nineteen when the attack occurred. She had identified\r\nSanders from a photograph and also identified him in court.\r\n\r\n      Although the trial court found Cope had presented clear and convincing\r\nevidence that Sanders committed these other crimes, it declined to allow in the\r\ntestimony, holding the other crimes were not sufficiently similar to be admitted\r\nunder Rule 404(b), SCRE. The court of appeals affirmed, noting that although\r\n\nother jurisdictions have adopted a lesser standard of similarity in evaluating this\r\ntype of reverse 404(b) evidence—where evidence of other crimes has been offered\r\nin exculpation by the defendant—here the crimes were too dissimilar to pass even\r\na lesser threshold.\r\n\r\n      A. Rule 404(b) Analysis\r\n\r\n       Cope argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit evidence of Sanders'\r\nother crimes under Rule 404(b). We disagree.\r\n\r\n       \"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the\r\ncharacter of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" Rule\r\n404(b), SCRE; see State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 415–16, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923)\r\n(noting the rule \"universally recognized and firmly established in all English-\r\nspeaking countries, that evidence of other distinct crimes committed by the\r\naccused may not be adduced merely to raise an inference or to corroborate the\r\nprosecution's theory of the defendant's guilt of the particular crime charged\").\r\n\"However, such evidence may be admissible to show motive, identity, the\r\nexistence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or\r\nintent.\" Rule 404(b). As a threshold matter, the trial court must determine whether\r\nthe proffered evidence is relevant as required under Rule 401, SCRE. Clasby, 385\r\nS.C at 154, 682 S.E.2d at 895. If the trial court finds the evidence is relevant, it\r\nmust then determine whether the bad act evidence fits within an exception in Rule\r\n404(b). Id.\r\n\r\n       Where there is a close degree of similarity between the crime charged and\r\nthe prior bad act, the prior bad act is admissible to demonstrate a common scheme\r\nor plan. Id. at 155, 682 S.E.2d at 896. \"When determining whether evidence is\r\nadmissible as common scheme or plan, the trial court must analyze the similarities\r\nand dissimilarities between the crime charged and the bad act evidence to\r\ndetermine whether there is a close degree of similarity.\" Id. The evidence is\r\nadmissible if the similarities outweigh the dissimilarities. Id. \"If the defendant\r\nwas not convicted of the prior crime, evidence of the prior bad act must be clear\r\nand convincing.\" State v. Gaines, 380 S.C. 23, 29, 667 S.E.2d 728, 731 (2008).\r\nEven if prior bad act evidence is clear and convincing and falls within an\r\nexception, it must be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\r\nthe danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. Clasby, 385 S.C. at 155, 682\r\nS.E.2d at 896.\r\n\n       We find no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of this evidence. Although\r\nthere are some similarities between the crime charged and the other acts, there are\r\nalso many distinctions. Those crimes all occurred subsequent to Child's murder\r\nand none of them involved children. Only one of those victims was raped and that\r\nrape did not include anal penetration, the use of a foreign object, nor was the\r\nvictim cleaned up afterward. Additionally, none of the attacks involved manual\r\nstrangulation or resulted in the victim's death. Furthermore, although those crimes\r\narguably demonstrate that Sanders could enter a house without signs of forced\r\nentry, his method varied wildly, ranging from a ruse to entering through an\r\nunlocked door. Given these differences, we cannot conclude the trial judge abused\r\nhis discretion in finding the evidence was inadmissible under a Rule 404(b)/Lyle\r\nanalysis.4\r\n\r\n       Alternatively, Cope argues the trial court should have analyzed the evidence\r\nunder a more permissive standard because the testimony was not being offered by\r\nthe State. He cites to several jurisdictions that have adopted a less stringent\r\nstandard for admission of \"other crimes\" evidence when it is offered by a\r\ndefendant in exculpation. While his assertion has some appeal, Cope failed to\r\npresent this argument before the trial judge, and the issue is thus unpreserved. \"It\r\nis axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\" Herron v.\r\nCentury BMW, 395 S.C. 461, 465, 719 S.E.2d 640, 642 (2012). Prohibiting an\r\nappellant from raising an issue for the first time on appeal ensures that the trial\r\ncourt is able \"to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and\r\narguments.\" Id. We therefore find it would be inappropriate to find error on an\r\nissue never properly raised below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 The dissent criticizes our analysis of the similarities as ineffectual given the\r\nevidence that Sanders committed the other crimes as well as the charged crimes.\r\nWe disagree that identity alone precludes consideration of the other particulars of\r\nthe crimes. If the purpose of the evidence is to show that Sanders acted pursuant to\r\na common scheme, we fail to see how we can decline to look at the commonality\r\nof the entire crimes when determining admissibility. We cannot look only to the\r\nfact that Sanders committed all the subsequent assaults alone simply because that\r\nis the detail Cope wants the jury to draw inferences from. The jury would be\r\npresented with all the specifics of these crimes and we therefore cannot ignore the\r\ndifferences that militate against a conclusion Sanders employed any common\r\nscheme.\r\n\n      B. Due Process\r\n\r\n        Relying on the United States Supreme Court's decision in Holmes v. South\r\nCarolina, 547 U.S. 319 (2006), Cope also argues that by excluding this evidence,\r\nhe was denied his constitutional right to present a defense.5 There, Holmes sought\r\nto introduce evidence that another man, White, had actually perpetrated the crimes\r\nfor which he was charged. Id. at 323. He proffered several witnesses who testified\r\nWhite had been in the neighborhood where the crime occurred on the morning it\r\nwas committed. Id. He also presented testimony of witnesses who claimed White\r\nhad admitted committing the crimes. Id. The trial court refused to admit the\r\nevidence, noting the substantial incriminating evidence presented by the State and\r\nconcluding that Holmes \"could not overcome the forensic evidence against him to\r\nraise a reasonable inference of his own innocence.\" Id. at 324 (internal quotations\r\nomitted). On appeal, this Court affirmed the trial court in State v. Holmes, 361\r\nS.C. 333, 605 S.E.2d 19 (2004), and the United States Supreme Court reversed.\r\nSpecifically, the Supreme Court held the trial court violated Holmes' right to a\r\n\"meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\" by excluding evidence of\r\nthird-party guilt on the grounds that the State had introduced forensic evidence\r\nthat, if believed, strongly supports a guilty verdict. Holmes v. South Carolina, 547\r\nU.S. at 330–31 (internal quotation omitted).\r\n\r\n       The facts here are distinguishable from Holmes. It was not the strength of\r\nthe State's case that led to exclusion of evidence of Sanders' other crimes. Instead,\r\nit was because the other crimes were not sufficiently similar to the crime charged\r\nso as to be admissible. Holmes plainly acknowledges that excluding evidence\r\nbecause its probative value is outweighed by unfair prejudice, confusion of the\r\nissues, or potential to mislead the jury is not violative of the Constitution. Id. at\r\n326. Because we find the exclusion of this testimony was appropriate for those\r\nexact reasons, we hold Cope's federal due process rights were not violated. We\r\naccordingly affirm the court of appeals' affirmance of the trial court's exclusion of\r\nthis testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5Holmes was issued after Cope's trial, but three years prior to the court of appeals'\r\nopinion.\r\n\n      C. Severance\r\n\r\n      Cope then argues the evidence of other crimes would have been admissible\r\nas evidence of third-party guilt in a separate trial and the court of appeals erred in\r\nupholding the denial of his motion for a severance. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       In South Carolina, criminal defendants who are jointly tried for murder are\r\nnot entitled to separate trials as a matter of right. State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 73,\r\n502 S.E.2d 63, 75 (1998). Motions for a severance are addressed to the discretion\r\nof the trial court. Id. at 74, 502 S.E.2d at 75. A severance should be granted only\r\nwhen there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right\r\nof a co-defendant or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about a co-\r\ndefendant's guilt. State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 282, 523 S.E.2d 173, 176 (1999)\r\n(citing Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534 (1993)). Furthermore, \"[a]n appellate\r\ncourt should not reverse a conviction achieved at a joint trial in the absence of a\r\nreasonable probability that the defendant would have obtained a more favorable\r\nresult at a separate trial.\" State v. Stuckey, 347 S.C. 484, 497, 556 S.E.2d 403, 409\r\n(Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\n       After the trial court refused the admission of testimony regarding Sanders'\r\nother crimes, Cope moved to sever the trials, arguing severance would prevent any\r\nprejudice against Sanders. The trial court declined, clarifying that prejudice was\r\nnot the basis for its ruling and further stating the evidence would not have been\r\nadmitted even if Cope was tried alone because the crimes were so dissimilar. The\r\ncourt of appeals, noting evidence of Sanders' guilt would not be inconsistent with\r\nCope's guilt, affirmed the trial court. It thus concluded that evidence of Sanders'\r\nother crimes would be inadmissible in a separate trial as evidence of third-party\r\nguilt because it did not raise an inference of Cope's innocence.\r\n\r\n       The admissibility of evidence of third-party guilt is governed by State v.\r\nGregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941). In Gregory, we held evidence of\r\nthird-party guilt that only tends to raise a conjectural inference that the third party,\r\nrather than the defendant, committed the crime should be excluded. 198 S.C. at\r\n105, 16 S.E.2d at 534. Furthermore, to be admissible, evidence of third-party guilt\r\nmust be \"limited to such facts as are inconsistent with [the defendant's] own guilt,\r\nand to such facts as raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to his own\r\ninnocence.\" Id at 104, 16 S.E.2d at 534 (internal quotations omitted). Pursuant to\r\nthis standard, we find the proffered testimony in this case would only produce\r\nspeculation as to whether Sanders acted alone in Child's rape and murder and\r\n\nwould therefore have been excluded in a separate trial. Evidence of Sanders' guilt\r\nis not inconsistent with Cope's guilt, nor does it raise a \"reasonable inference\"—\r\nand certainly not a presumption—of Cope's innocence. We therefore affirm the\r\ncourt of appeals in finding that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a\r\nseverance to allow Cope to admit this evidence.\r\n\r\nII.   TESTIMONY OF JAMES HILL\r\n\r\n       Cope contends the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial court's\r\nexclusion of testimony from an inmate, James Hill, who allegedly heard Sanders\r\ntelling other inmates how he raped and killed \"a little girl in Rock Hill.\" We find\r\nno reversible error.\r\n\r\n       During a proffer, Hill testified he was jailed with Sanders in a segregation\r\nunit in late 2002, when he overheard Sanders talking with another inmate. Sanders\r\njoked about how police were not doing their jobs, and he bragged that it was easy\r\nto \"delude them.\" According to Hill, Sanders \"made the comment that he was\r\ngoing to get away with what he did to that little girl in Rock Hill.\" Hill testified\r\nSanders indicated he had committed oral and anal sodomy on the child, and\r\nSanders claimed he had smothered her. Hill stated Sanders was explicit about the\r\nliberties he took with the child and Sanders claimed he entered and exited though a\r\nwindow before proceeding to another house. Hill testified he met Cope in another\r\npart of the jail a few months later, and he realized Sanders' statement was\r\nimportant when he overheard Cope talking about his case with another inmate.\r\n\r\n       In objecting to the admission of the testimony, Sanders argued that it was\r\n\"not relevant to this case because there [have] been no identifying characteristics,\"\r\nnoting that there are many criminal allegations against him, so nothing makes this\r\nrelevant. The trial court sustained the objection, stating \"there has been no\r\ntestimony as to time, place, other circumstances.\" The court of appeals affirmed,\r\nconcluding the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the testimony was\r\nirrelevant.\r\n\r\n       Cope contends the court of appeals erred in concluding Hill's testimony was\r\nirrelevant. Additionally, he argues it was admissible as an out-of-court statement\r\nby an unavailable declarant and the exclusion amounted to a violation of his\r\n\nconstitutional rights. Although we agree the testimony passes the threshold of\r\nrelevance under Rule 401, we nevertheless find it inadmissible as hearsay which\r\nwould not fall within the proposed exception.6\r\n\r\n        Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, provides as exception to the hearsay rule for the\r\nadmissibility of out-of-court statements against penal interest made by an\r\nunavailable declarant. \"However, if offered to exculpate the accused in a criminal\r\ntrial, they are admissible only if corroborating evidence clearly indicates the\r\ntrustworthiness of the statements.\" State v. Kinloch, 338 S.C. 385, 388, 526 S.E.2d\r\n705, 706 (2000). \"The rule does not require that the information within the\r\nstatement be clearly corroborated, it means only that there be corroborating\r\ncircumstances which clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement itself,\r\ni.e., that the statement was actually made.\" Id. at 389, 526 S.E.2d at 707.\r\nHowever, we have noted that \"[i]n many instances, it is not possible to separate\r\nthese two considerations in analyzing the matter of corroboration.\" State v.\r\nMcDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 324, 540 S.E.2d 464, 466 (2000). \"Whether a statement\r\nhas been sufficiently corroborated is a question left to the discretion of the trial\r\njudge after considering the totality of the circumstances under which a declaration\r\nagainst penal interest was made.\" State v. Wannamaker, 346 S.C. 495, 501, 552\r\nS.E.2d 284, 287 (2001) (internal quotations omitted).\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, to fall within this hearsay exception, the statement must be\r\nclearly corroborated so as to establish that the statement was made. We find here\r\nthat it was not. As the trial court noted, there was no testimony on \"time, place,\r\n[or] other circumstances\" to verify this statement was ever made by Sanders. Hill\r\nis unsure to whom Sanders allegedly made the statements, which frustrates any\r\nability to confirm Sanders actually said this to anyone. Furthermore, the statement\r\n\r\n6 We therefore agree with the dissent that the testimony was relevant under Rule\r\n401. However, we disagree with the dissent's conclusion that Sanders' challenge to\r\nthe admissibility of Hill's testimony went to the weight of the evidence and not to\r\nadmissibility. Certainly, the factual discrepancies would go to the weight of the\r\nevidence, but prior to examining the veracity of the statement, the court must\r\naddress whether the proponent has put forth sufficient evidence to demonstrate the\r\nstatement was actually made so as to be admissible. See Kinloch, 338 S.C. at 389,\r\n526 S.E.2d at 707 (\"The corroboration requirement is a preliminary determination\r\nas to the statement's admissibility, not an ultimate determination about the\r\nstatement's truth.\").\r\n\ndoes not detail specifics of the crimes, and even gets some salient facts wrong.\r\nThere was no evidence oral sex was performed on Child and she was not\r\nsmothered. Moreover, there is absolutely no mention of Cope, a detail doubtful to\r\nbe omitted whether Sanders conspired with him, or was only aware he had been\r\narrested for Sanders' crimes. We accordingly find that although Hill's testimony\r\nmay have been relevant, it was nevertheless inadmissible as hearsay because it was\r\nnot clearly corroborated so as to indicate its trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nIII.   EXCLUSION OF SPECIFICS FOR FALSE-CONFESSION EXPERT\r\n\r\n      Cope also alleges the trial court erred in refusing to allow Dr. Saul Kassin—\r\nCope's false-confession expert—to testify about specific cases involving false\r\nconfessions.\r\n\r\n       \"Generally, the admission of expert testimony is a matter within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial court.\" State v. Whaley, 305 S.C. 138, 143, 406 S.E.2d 369,\r\n372 (1991). Thus, we will not reverse the trial court's decision to admit or exclude\r\nexpert testimony absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion. State v. White, 382 S.C.\r\n265, 269, 676 S.E.2d 684, 686 (2009). \"A trial court's ruling on the admissibility\r\nof an expert's testimony constitutes an abuse of discretion where the ruling is\r\nmanifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair.\" State v. Grubbs, 353 S.C. 374, 379,\r\n577 S.E.2d 493, 496 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n\r\n       Cope called Dr. Kassin and sought to qualify him as an expert in social\r\npsychology for the purpose of testifying on the phenomenon of false confessions.\r\nThe State conducted a voir dire of Dr. Kassin and thereafter objected to his\r\nqualification, and Cope proffered his testimony outside the presence of the jury.\r\nThe State objected to Dr. Kassin referencing with specificity any cases where\r\nsomebody confessed and was later exonerated. Cope asserted the case of State v.\r\nMyers, 359 S.C. 40, 596 S.E.2d 488 (2004), stands for the proposition that other\r\ncases of false confession are admissible if they have a \"factual nexus\" to the case\r\nbefore the court. However, when asked by the court whether Dr. Kassin would be\r\ntestifying about any particular case, Cope responded that it was \"certainly not [his]\r\nplan . . . to call any reference to any specific other case\" but that Dr. Kassin would\r\n\"talk about generally the science that is recognized.\" The court then stated it\r\nwould allow him to testify but noted \"the witness cannot testify about particular\r\ncases unless they are on all fours with this particular case, and you've told me that,\r\npretty much indicated that you don't know of any.\" Cope responded that he had\r\nnot and did not intend to ask him about those, but noted there may be cases where\r\n\ncertain factors would match the circumstances in Cope's case. The court stated its\r\nconcern that this would result in a \"parade of horribles\" before the jury that would\r\nbe prejudicial and would not serve its function of assisting the jury in its\r\ndetermination of the facts. However, the trial court nevertheless qualified Dr.\r\nKassin as an expert in social psychology with a focus on interrogation and\r\ninterviews.\r\n\r\n       Dr. Kassin proceeded to testify before the jury, and began describing types\r\nof false confessions, including \"coerced compliant\" false confessions, where an\r\ninnocent person might confess in the hope of terminating a bad situation, avoiding\r\nsome threatened or implied harm, or obtaining leniency or some reward. In\r\nattempting to explain how this could occur, Dr. Kassin mentioned the Central Park\r\njogger case.7 The State immediately objected and the court sustained the objection\r\nbased on its previous ruling. The jury was removed and Cope then argued specific\r\nexamples of other false confessions should be admissible because the field of study\r\nwas relatively recent and is highly dependent on case studies to properly describe\r\nthe factors used to show whether a confession is false. The trial court disagreed,\r\nnoting that it found the prejudice outweighed any probative value, but allowed Dr.\r\nKassin to make another proffer for the record.\r\n\r\n      In his proffered testimony, Dr. Kassin specifically discussed two cases. One\r\ninvolved Peter Reilly, who found his mother dead and confessed to killing her after\r\nbeing informed he had failed a polygraph test. He was eventually released from\r\nprison after exculpatory evidence was found.\r\n\r\n       The second case involved Gary Gauger, who found his parents slaughtered\r\nat home and was extensively interrogated. The police then informed him he failed\r\nhis polygraph test and he confessed, in some detail, to committing the murders.\r\nLater, he was exonerated when a member of a motorcycle gang was caught on tape\r\nbragging about the crime. The State objected to specific mention of these cases,\r\nand the court held Dr. Kassin should omit discussion of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 The Central Park jogger case involved the brutal rape and assault of a young\r\nwoman when she was jogging through New York City's Central Park. Five\r\njuveniles were arrested and later confessed as well as implicated one another. The\r\nconvictions were later vacated in People v. Wise, 752 N.Y.S.2d 837, 850 (Sup. Ct.\r\n2002), when another man confessed to perpetrating the crime alone and DNA\r\nevidence corroborated his confession.\r\n\n       The court of appeals affirmed, noting that \"the trial court in this case\r\nconscientiously considered the proffered anecdotal evidence before excluding this\r\ntestimony.\" Cope, 385 S.C. at 289, 684 S.E.2d at 185. The court found Dr. Kassin\r\nhad been allowed to present exhaustive testimony on the theories underlying the\r\nstudy of coerced internalized false confessions, explain the techniques used by\r\ninterrogators that can lead to false confessions, and inform the jury that there were\r\n\"innumerable actual cases\" of coerced internalized false confessions. Id. at 290,\r\n684 S.E.2d at 185.\r\n\r\n       Cope contends the trial court should have allowed Dr. Kassin to discuss the\r\nspecifics of these two cases because they were \"nearly identical in many critical\r\nrespects\" to Cope's case. Specifically, Cope notes that the cases involved the same\r\ntype of \"coerced internalized\" false confessions that were part of the theory of his\r\ndefense; Gauger and Reilly were similarly grief-stricken and vulnerable after\r\nlosing a close relative; both men were also presented with powerful evidence of\r\ntheir guilt; they confessed after being informed they failed a polygraph test; and all\r\nthree eventually recanted their confessions. He also seeks to distinguish the Myers\r\ncase, which the court of appeals relied upon in its analysis.\r\n\r\n        In affirming the trial court, the court of appeals relied on Myers, which also\r\ninvolved false confession testimony by Dr. Kassin. There, this Court held the trial\r\njudge did not err in excluding specific testimony about false confessions in cases\r\nfrom Connecticut and Indiana. Myers, 359 S.C. at 50, 596 S.E.2d at 493. The\r\nCourt noted Dr. Kassin was actually allowed to testify about specific instances of\r\nfalse confessions, including cases where people had confessed in shaken baby\r\ncases, and the deaths were later proved to have been caused by some problem other\r\nthan abuse. Id. at 494, 596 S.E.2d at 51. He also discussed cases where\r\ndefendants confessed to murder, but the victims later turned up alive. Id. The\r\nCourt further noted that \"Dr. Kassin did testify about specific cases, he just did not\r\nuse names or say in which state the crime happened.\" Id. Although the Court\r\nacknowledged the Connecticut case was similar to Myers' case, it found the trial\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding information about it, noting Dr.\r\nKassin was able to testify at length about false confessions and touch briefly on the\r\nConnecticut case. Id. Moreover, the Court found that even assuming error by the\r\ntrial court, Myers could not show prejudice in light of Dr. Kassin's other testimony.\r\nId.   Cope argues that Myers is distinguishable because the Gauger and Reilly\r\nconvictions were not merely similar, but were nearly identical in many critical\r\n\nrespects. He further argues that Dr. Kassin was not permitted to testify about the\r\nGauger or Reilly cases at all, and therefore the court of appeals erred in affirming\r\nthe exclusion of the testimony and in failing to recognize the crucial differences\r\nbetween Cope's case and Myers.\r\n\r\n       Although Cope argues this issue in terms of the similarity of the cases, the\r\ntrial court's ruling was based primarily on a Rule 403 analysis, noting twice that it\r\nfound the prejudice outweighed the probative value and expressing some concern\r\nabout sensationalism. Therefore, even assuming testimony about the Reilly and\r\nGauger cases should have come in because of their similarities, the specifics of\r\nthose cases were properly excluded as more prejudicial than probative. Presenting\r\nthe jury with explicit details of historical cases of people who were imprisoned\r\nbased on false confessions would distract the jury's attention from the facts of this\r\ncase and potentially confuse the issues. Moreover, Myers does not stand for the\r\nproposition that testimony regarding substantially similar cases should be allowed\r\nin; instead, the Court simply found Myers could not show he was prejudiced by the\r\nexclusion of the explicit discussion of similar cases.\r\n\r\n       Similarly, although Cope argues his defense was crippled by the exclusion\r\nof these specifics, we find no prejudice. The extensive and thorough testimony\r\noffered by Dr. Kassin informed the jury of the nature of coerced internalized false\r\nconfessions and the factors that often accompany such false confessions—such as\r\nfatigue, stress, recent trauma, and aggressive police methodology. Furthermore, he\r\nnoted that this does in fact occur and indicated generally that there were a number\r\nof cases where people gave detailed confessions which later turned out to be\r\ncompletely false. Although Cope contends the exclusion of these examples\r\nhindered his ability to overcome the jury's likely predilection to doubt false\r\nconfessions happen, his expert was permitted to testify fully that there are a large\r\nnumber of cases where false confessions occurred. We therefore affirm the court\r\nof appeals in holding the trial court did not err in excluding the case specifics from\r\nDr. Kassin's testimony.\r\n\r\nIV.   DIRECTED VERDICT ON CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\n       Lastly, Cope argues the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for a\r\ndirected verdict on the conspiracy charge because the evidence presented by the\r\nState allowed only for speculation as to Cope's guilt. We disagree.\r\n\nIn reviewing a motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the\r\nexistence of evidence, not with its weight. State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 633 591\r\nS.E.2d 600, 605 (2004). In an appeal from the denial of a directed verdict motion,\r\nthe appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.\r\nId. (citing State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999)). \"If\r\nthere is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably\r\ntending to prove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the case was properly\r\nsubmitted to the jury.\" Id. \"Unless there is a total failure of competent evidence as\r\nto the charges alleged, refusal by the trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal is\r\nnot error.\" State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 389, 605 S.E.2d 529, 531 (2004).\r\n\r\n       Criminal conspiracy is defined as a combination between two or more\r\npersons for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or a lawful object by\r\nunlawful means. S.C. Code Ann. § 16-17-410 (2003). The gravamen of\r\nconspiracy is an agreement or combination. State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 134, 437\r\nS.E.2d 75, 80 (1993). \"To establish the existence of a conspiracy, proof of an\r\nexpress agreement is not necessary, and direct evidence is not essential, but the\r\nconspiracy may be sufficiently shown by circumstantial evidence and the conduct\r\nof the parties.\" State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001).\r\nThe Court must exercise caution in its analysis, however, to ensure the proof is not\r\nobtained \"by piling inference upon inference.\" Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d\r\nat 81. After the State rested, Cope moved for a directed verdict on the conspiracy\r\ncharge. He argued there was no evidence in the record indicating any conspiracy\r\nexisted between himself and Sanders, and specifically, no evidence of a meeting of\r\nthe minds or any agreement between the two men. Cope noted a conspiracy charge\r\ncannot be supported by suspicion or conjecture, and the fact there was no evidence\r\nof forced entry, combined with the fact Sanders' DNA was found on Child, did not\r\nrise to the level of proof of a conspiracy. The trial judge found all the evidence\r\nindicated that Cope had been home all night and Sanders was there at some point.\r\nHe further noted there was evidence the chain on the front door was latched and\r\nthat the windows had not been disturbed. He then held there was \"some direct and\r\nsubstantial circumstantial evidence\" that Sanders and Cope conspired, and\r\ntherefore denied the motion.\r\n\r\n      The court of appeals affirmed. It acknowledged the State's case was entirely\r\ncircumstantial, but stated:\r\n\n      Nevertheless, in the present case, the DNA evidence on Child's body,\r\n      along with Cope's admissions about his interactions with Child shortly\r\n      before she died, place Cope and Sanders together at the time of the\r\n      assault on Child and her resulting death. Likewise, the testimony\r\n      regarding lack of forced entry and the cluttered condition of the home\r\n      constitute evidence that Sanders, who had no known connection with\r\n      Cope's family, received assistance to navigate his way to Child's\r\n      bedroom. Finally, Cope's staging of the crime scene after Child died\r\n      is evidence that a cover-up had begun before Cope called the police to\r\n      his home on the pretext that Child had accidentally strangled herself,\r\n      notwithstanding compelling forensic evidence that Sanders was\r\n      present and actively participating during the same time period in\r\n      which her death was determined to have occurred. Although each of\r\n      these factors alone may have supported only a mere suspicion of a\r\n      conspiracy between Cope and Sanders, it is our view that when\r\n      considered together, they yield the requisite level of proof of \"acts,\r\n      declarations, or specific conduct\" by the alleged conspirators to\r\n      withstand a directed verdict motion on this charge. See State v.\r\n      Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620, 625, 677 S.E.2d 603, 605 (2009) (reversing\r\n      a conviction for trafficking and noting \"the State failed to present any\r\n      evidence such as acts, declarations, or specific conduct to support [an]\r\n      inference\" that the petitioners had knowledge that drugs were being\r\n      transported).\r\n\r\nCope, 385 S.C. at 295–96, 684 S.E.2d at 188.\r\n\r\n      Cope argues the court of appeals erred because the evidence presented by\r\nthe State of Cope's confessions and suspicious behavior may tend to support the\r\nconclusion that Cope was guilty of criminal sexual conduct, but not that he had\r\nconspired with Sanders. Cope further points out that to find a conspiracy, the jury\r\nmust conclude there was an agreement to commit the crime and commission of the\r\nunderlying crime is insufficient.\r\n\r\n        We acknowledge there is no direct evidence that the two men agreed to\r\ncommit this crime or that they even knew each other. However, conspiracy can be\r\nproven by circumstantial evidence and the conduct of the parties. Although Cope\r\ncriticizes the State's conspiracy charge as unsubstantiated and a desperate attempt\r\nto reconcile Cope's confessions with the presence of Sanders' DNA, we fail to find\r\nthe argument so completely implausible given the State's evidence. There were no\r\n\nsigns of forced entry on any of the windows and evidence was presented that the\r\nchain on the door had been latched. The house was in such disarray it would have\r\nbeen almost impossible for Sanders to navigate the house in the dark without\r\nsomeone guiding him. Cope confessed to sexually assaulting his daughter on three\r\nseparate occasions. Furthermore, the bite mark which contained Sanders' saliva\r\nwas determined to have been inflicted contemporaneously with her other injuries.\r\nThere was also evidence Child had been cleaned up and dressed after the sexual\r\nassault and murder, which Sanders would have been unlikely to do if he risked\r\nbeing caught by someone in the home at any moment. Although the evidence of\r\nthe existence of an agreement between Sanders and Cope may not be\r\noverwhelming, it need not be to survive a directed verdict motion. Viewing the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find the evidence would allow\r\na jury to conclude the men conspired to commit these crimes. Competent evidence\r\nwas admitted which tended to show both men were present with Child around the\r\ntime of her death and each played some role in the acts that were perpetrated upon\r\nher. We find sufficient circumstantial evidence to survive a directed verdict and\r\nallow a jury to determine whether an agreement to perpetrate the sexual assault\r\nexisted between Cope and Sanders. Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals'\r\naffirmance of the trial court's denial of a directed verdict.8\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      We find no reversible error by the trial court and we therefore affirm Cope's\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\n      TOAL, C.J., and BEATTY, J., concur. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in\r\npart and dissenting in part in which PLIECONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 We note that even if we reversed the conspiracy conviction, because Cope is\r\nserving that five-year sentence concurrently with his sentence of life plus thirty\r\nyears' imprisonment, his time incarcerated would not change. Furthermore, while\r\nCope argues that reversal on this ground would necessitate a new trial on all\r\ngrounds, his confessions alone would be sufficient to support the CSC and murder\r\nconvictions.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I fully recognize that, as the majority states, the \"facts\r\nsurrounding the sexual assault and murder of Child are graphic and profoundly\r\ndisturbing.\" Notwithstanding my agreement with the majority's characterization of\r\nthe horrific nature of this tragic crime, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in\r\npart. I join the majority in affirming the court of appeals with respect to the\r\nconspiracy charge. However, I dissent with respect to two trial court evidentiary\r\nerrors, which in my judgment require reversal of the court of appeals and remand\r\nfor a new trial.                           I.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours of November 29, 2001, James Sanders, a serial rapist,\r\nentered the home of Petitioner Billy Wayne Cope and brutally raped and murdered\r\nCope's twelve-year-old daughter. Sanders' identity was not known at the time, as\r\nthe analysis of DNA9 crime scene evidence, specifically saliva from a bite mark on\r\nChild's breast and semen on Child's pants, was not completed for approximately\r\none month.\r\n\r\nInitially, and understandably, law enforcement focused on Cope as the sole\r\nsuspect. Law enforcement assumed the saliva and semen from the crime scene\r\nbelonged to Cope. Most certainly, Cope's bizarre behavior plausibly supported\r\nwhat turned out to be a false assumption. Although Cope at first denied any\r\ninvolvement with Child's sexual assault and murder, his behavior was reasonably\r\nviewed as suspicious by investigators. Moreover, investigators were unable to find\r\nevidence of forced entry into the home. Cope also agreed to take a polygraph\r\nexamination, which he apparently passed. The examiner, however, informed Cope\r\nthat he had failed, whereupon Cope's strange series of confessions began. Cope\r\neven agreed to return to his home so police could videotape his confession while\r\nhe purported to reenact the crime.\r\n\r\nCope, for example, stated he \"strangl[ed] her with my hands\" and believed Child\r\nhad been \"raptured,\" because he \"had just finished reading the Left Behind series\r\n. . . .\" Another confession attributed the attack to \"a bad dream about an old\r\ngirlfriend who had an abortion.\" According to Cope:\r\n\r\n      In my dream she was telling me that I had an abortion with your child\r\n      and I told her no. I became so enraged that I got out of bed. All I\r\n\r\n9 Deoxyribonucleic acid, more commonly known as DNA, is the double-helix\r\nstructure in cell nuclei that carries the genetic information of living organisms.\r\nBlack's Law Dictionary 550 (9th ed. 2009).\r\n\n      could hear was that laughing sound. I do not know what came over\r\n      me, but I snapped and I jumped on the bed and straddled [Child]. I hit\r\n      her in the head and started choking her. I did not know it was my own\r\n      daughter until after I had shoved the broom stick in her privates. I fell\r\n      back jarring me to my senses and I realized it was my daughter.\r\n\r\nConfident the DNA evidence from the saliva and the semen would point to Cope,\r\npolice charged Cope with the sexual assault and murder. In short, the police 'had\r\ntheir man.' This preliminary view of Cope as the sole perpetrator was, to be sure,\r\nunderstandable under the circumstances, and it is not my intent to criticize law\r\nenforcement for its concentrated focus on Cope. Sometime later, however, the\r\npolice became aware the DNA evidence obtained from Child was Sanders', not\r\nCope's. This DNA analysis confirming Sanders' guilt unhinged the investigators'\r\nreasonable theory that Cope was the sole perpetrator of the horrific crime.\r\n\r\nSanders was then charged in connection with the rape and murder. The State\r\nmoved forward with the charges against Cope as well, and both men were charged\r\nwith conspiracy. The State's theory was that \"they did it together\" with Cope\r\n\"serv[ing] up his daughter for his and [] Sanders' own perverse pleasures.\" Cope\r\nand Sanders were tried jointly, and both were convicted and sentenced to life\r\nimprisonment.10\r\n\r\nOn direct appeal, the court of appeals initially held the trial court erred in denying\r\nCope's directed verdict motion concerning conspiracy. In its first opinion, the\r\ncourt of appeals found:\r\n\r\n      We agree with Cope that the absence of actual proof of an agreement\r\n      and of some connection between him and Sanders warranted a\r\n      directed verdict on the conspiracy charge. Here, there was no direct\r\n      evidence of any association between Cope and Sanders. The State's\r\n      evidence of a conspiracy was entirely circumstantial, consisting of (1)\r\n      forensic evidence that the bite mark where Sanders' DNA was found\r\n      was inflicted within the same two-hour time frame as the injuries that\r\n\r\n10Cope was convicted of murder, two counts of first degree criminal sexual\r\nconduct (CSC), criminal conspiracy to commit CSC, and unlawful conduct\r\ntowards a child. Sanders was convicted of murder, first degree CSC, and criminal\r\nconspiracy. The joint trial allowed the State to take, in large part, a bystander role\r\nin terms of the critical evidentiary issues, as Sanders carried the State's water in\r\nobjecting to much of Cope's evidence.\r\n\n      Cope confessed to inflicting, (2) Sister's testimony that she and Child\r\n      locked the doors before they went to bed and testimony that there was\r\n      no evidence of forced entry, and (3) the fact that the house was full of\r\n      debris and passage inside, particularly at night, would have been\r\n      difficult. These factors, whether considered individually or\r\n      collectively, raise at most a suspicion that Cope and Sanders intended\r\n      to act together for their shared mutual benefit. Any inference that\r\n      they made an agreement to accomplish a shared, single criminal\r\n      objective would be speculative at best. Therefore, because the State\r\n      failed to prove the element of agreement for the crime of conspiracy,\r\n      the trial court should have granted a directed verdict as to that charge.\r\n\r\nIn a substituted opinion, the court of appeals reversed course and found sufficient\r\nevidence of a conspiracy to submit the charge to the jury. The court of appeals\r\nalso rejected Cope's remaining assignments of error.\r\n\r\n                                          II.\r\nAlthough a close question is presented, I join the majority in upholding the denial\r\nof the directed verdict motion related to the conspiracy charge. I would, however,\r\nreverse Cope's convictions on two evidentiary grounds, not reach the additional\r\nchallenges, and remand for a new trial.    A.\r\nI believe it was unfairly prejudicial to Cope, and thus reversible error, to exclude\r\nunder Rule 404(b), SCRE, evidence of Sanders' multiple assaults against women,\r\nwhich were committed in the vicinity of Cope's home shortly after the murder of\r\nChild. On four occasions between December 12, 2001, and January 12, 2002,\r\nSanders gained entry into residences and either raped or attempted to sexually\r\nassault victims ranging in age from nineteen years old to sixty years old. I find the\r\nexclusion of this evidence was an abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the admission or exclusion of evidence is committed to the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial court. State v. Clasby, 385 S.C. 148, 154, 682 S.E.2d 892,\r\n895 (2009). However, \"the determination of whether the facts surrounding [a\r\nsexual] assault sufficiently evidence a common scheme or plan is a question of\r\nlaw.\" State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 326-27, 580 S.E.2d 186, 190 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIn examining the issue, a trial court must exercise its evidentiary discretion in the\r\ncontext of the situation presented, not in a formulaic manner. Similarly, on appeal,\r\na reviewing court must also consider the evidentiary ruling in context. Here, the\r\n\ncontext that must be considered is a criminal defendant's attempt to present\r\nevidence that a co-defendant committed these offenses alone, which was entirely\r\nconsistent with the co-defendant's practice of committing similar offenses alone.\r\nRespectfully, it strikes me that the academic considerations of the majority ignore\r\nthe reality of the unique facts presented. See United States v. Rodriguez, 215 F.3d\r\n110, 120-21 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting the similarity of the prior bad act is a factor\r\ntending to support admissibility but cautioning that there is no per se rule to\r\ndetermine admissibility; rather admissibility is determined by evaluating the\r\nparticular facts and legal issues in each case).\r\n\r\nMore to the point, a myopic approach to matters such as the similarities or lack of\r\nsimilarities between the charged crime and the other crimes serves little purpose in\r\nthis case. Any suggested dissimilarities are of no moment, for it is not seriously\r\nchallenged that Sanders raped and murdered Child and, by clear and convincing\r\nevidence, committed the four other crimes. Because it is beyond serious dispute\r\nthat Sanders committed all of the offenses, I see no reason to determine whether\r\nthe similarities provide a suitable nexus between the other crimes and the charged\r\noffense. The relevance of this evidence is unmistakable—Sanders, as a serial\r\nrapist, always acted alone.11\r\n\r\nEven assuming such comparative analysis were required under the circumstances\r\npresented, I would find reversible error in any event, for I disagree that there are\r\nmeaningful dissimilarities between the crime charged and the other crimes. I am\r\nunpersuaded by the suggestion that Sanders' other sexual attacks were not\r\nsufficiently similar to the rape and murder of the twelve-year-old child. I do not\r\nunderstand why it is so remarkable for a rapist who assaults women ranging from\r\nage nineteen to sixty to also assault a twelve-year-old female child. The notion\r\nthat these acts are \"dissimilar\" is especially troubling here, where it is clearly\r\nestablished Sanders committed all the assaults, including the rape and murder of\r\nChild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11With great respect, it appears the majority has permitted the State's \"theory\" of\r\nthe case to dictate the admissibility or inadmissibility of a defendant's alleged\r\nexculpatory evidence. In my view, by considering only the State's theory in the\r\n404(b) analysis, the majority has essentially all but assured Cope, or any other\r\ndefendant, would be unable to present evidence in his defense when prosecutors\r\ncast wide theories of guilt and conspiracy.\r\n\nAnd finally, the Court notes the comparative lack of brutality in the other sexual\r\nattacks. I disagree, for any differences in the level of brutality were not for lack of\r\ntrying. Sanders forcibly raped a victim on December 12. On December 16,\r\nSanders physically overpowered another victim, but the victim's screams, a dog\r\nbarking, and a daughter appearing to see what was wrong led to Sanders fleeing the\r\nscene. On December 19, Sanders attempted to overpower a victim by putting a\r\nplastic bag over the victim's head and wrapping the victim in a rug; the victim\r\nresisted mightily, ultimately grabbing a pen and stabbing Sanders in the leg,\r\ncausing him to flee. Several weeks later on January 12, Sanders entered another\r\nvictim's residence, shoved the front door against the victim's head and then pushed\r\nthe victim down, stomping her; the victim resisted and Sanders responded by\r\nputting her in a chokehold, from which the victim broke free, only to be thrown\r\ndown and kicked again; the victim used mace and grabbed a screwdriver from the\r\nfloor and stabbed Sanders in his left shoulder, causing him to flee. I would not\r\ndiminish the brutality of these crimes.\r\n\r\nI find there is a striking similarity between the facts of this case and the proffered\r\nevidence of Sanders' other sexual assaults. All five incidents occurred within a six-\r\nweek period, and each of the four other incidents occurred within five miles of\r\nCope's home. Moreover, in all five cases, Sanders was a stranger to the victim, yet\r\nthere were no signs of forced entry to any victim's home. In light of the testimony\r\nthat the assailant is acquainted with the victim in the vast majority of sexual assault\r\ncases,12 the presence of these two common features is significant. In my view, the\r\nother four incidents present a compelling pattern in terms of time, geography and\r\ncommonality of features—a pattern which is entirely consistent with the facts of\r\nthis case and material to Cope's theory that Sanders acted alone. See Butler v.\r\nGamma Nu Chapter of Sigma Chi, 314 S.C. 477, 480, 445 S.E.2d 468, 470 (1994)\r\n(noting that evidence is material if the proffered fact is logically or rationally\r\nconnected to a disputed fact).\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances presented, I would find the exclusion of the evidence of\r\nSanders' other crimes was reversible error, particularly in light of the importance of\r\nthe proffered evidence to Cope's theory of the case. See State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C.\r\n\r\n12 During the hearing, Gregg McCrary testified as an expert in crime scene\r\nanalysis. McCrary testified that rape accounts for only 0.8% of all crimes\r\ncommitted and less than 20% of rapes are stranger-based rapes where the assailant\r\nis unknown to the victim. McCrary testified that, because stranger-based rapes are\r\n\"very rare,\" it would be \"very, very unusual\" to have \"more than one offender\r\ncommitting similar type crimes in a similar area at a similar time.\"\r\n\n326, 334, 563 S.E.2d 315, 319 (2002) (finding an error is harmless only where \"the\r\nreviewing court can conclude the error did not contribute to the verdict beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt\"). I would additionally find the exclusion of Sanders' other\r\ncrimes violated Cope's due process guarantee of \"a meaningful opportunity to\r\npresent a complete defense.\" Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319, 324 (2006).\r\n\r\n                                           B.\r\nI would further hold that the court of appeals erred by affirming the trial court's\r\nexclusion of the testimony of James Hill, a fellow inmate of Sanders. Hill\r\npurportedly heard Sanders telling another inmate of his rape and murder of \"a little\r\ngirl in Rock Hill.\" During a proffer, Hill testified he was incarcerated with Sanders\r\nin late 2002, when he overheard Sanders talking with another inmate. Sanders\r\njoked about how the police were not doing their jobs, and he bragged that it was\r\neasy to \"delude them.\" According to Hill, Sanders \"made the comment that he was\r\ngoing to get away with what he did to that little girl in Rock Hill.\" Hill testified\r\nthat Sanders indicated he had committed oral and anal sodomy on Child, and\r\nSanders claimed he had smothered her. Hill stated Sanders specifically said he\r\n\"fucked her. He fucked her good[,]\" and Sanders claimed he entered and exited the\r\nresidence though a window.\r\n\r\nIn objecting to the admission of the testimony, Sanders successfully argued that it\r\nwas \"not relevant to this case because there has been no identifying\r\ncharacteristics,\" noting that there are many allegations against him. Procedurally, I\r\nnote that the State did not object to Hill's testimony. Beyond that, Sanders'\r\nobjection to Hill's testimony was limited to relevance. The majority agrees with\r\nme that the trial court's ruling on the relevancy objection was error, for Hill's\r\ntestimony manifestly meets the threshold of relevancy under Rule 401, SCRE.\r\nClearly, the testimony has some \"tendency to make the existence of any fact that is\r\nof consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\nthan it would be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, SCRE.\r\nUndaunted, and apparently relying on the rule that allows affirmance on any\r\nground appearing in the record, the majority finds an alternative basis to exclude\r\nHill's testimony. The majority states that \"we nevertheless find it inadmissible as\r\nhearsay which would not fall within the proposed exception[,]\" specifically Rule\r\n804(b)(3), SCRE. I strongly disagree, and I would not strain to such lengths to\r\nsustain the exclusion of this evidence. There is no plausible deniability as to\r\nSanders' guilt, as he left a bite mark on Child's breast and his semen was found on\r\nChild's pants. See State v. Kinloch, 338 S.C. 385, 389, 526 S.E.2d 705, 707 (2000)\r\n(\"The rule does not require that the information within the statement be clearly\r\n\ncorroborated, it means only that there be corroborating circumstances which\r\nclearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement itself, i.e., that the statement\r\nwas actually made.\"). The supposed lack of specificity in Hill's testimony is\r\nunavailing, for there is no evidence of another young girl in Rock Hill who was\r\nraped and murdered during the same time frame.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the majority finds it significant that \"there is absolutely no mention of\r\nCope\" in Hill's proffered testimony.13 It seems to me, however, that the absence of\r\nany reference to Cope in Sanders' alleged jailhouse confession serves to enhance,\r\nrather than diminish, the statement's relevance and corresponding prejudice to\r\nCope by its exclusion. This is especially evident where Cope expressly sought to\r\nrefute the claim of a conspiracy with Sanders. Sanders' objection to Hill's\r\ntestimony was in essence a challenge to the weight of the evidence, not its\r\nadmissibility. I would find the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of Hill.\r\n\r\nFinally, I observe that this is the kind of typical jailhouse confession evidence that\r\nis routinely allowed in evidence, with two glaring differences. First, it is almost\r\nalways the State seeking admission of such evidence. Second, the testifying\r\ninmate expects to gain from his assistance to the prosecution. Here, Hill agreed to\r\ntestify in a situation that he well understood was contrary to the prosecution and\r\nthus contrary to his best interest.         III.\r\n\r\nIn concurring in part and dissenting in part, I would reverse Cope's convictions and\r\nremand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13Again, I believe it improper for the State's theory of a case alone to control the\r\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a co-defendant's exculpatory evidence.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27304","title":"Poch v.

As a result of a tragic, work-related accident,\r\nPoch was killed and Key was injured. Poch's estate and Key received workers'\r\ncompensation benefits through Job Place.\r\n\n       Subsequently, Key and his wife and the estate of Poch (\"Petitioners\") filed\r\nsuit against Bayshore SC and its parent company, Bayshore Concrete Products\r\nCorporation (\"Bayshore Corp.\").1 The circuit court granted Respondents' motion\r\nto dismiss the actions on the ground that workers' compensation was Petitioners'\r\nexclusive remedy and, therefore, Respondents were immune from liability in a tort\r\naction. The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's order. Poch v. Bayshore\r\nConcrete Products/South Carolina, Inc., 386 S.C. 13, 686 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App.\r\n2009). This Court granted a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of\r\nAppeals. Although we agree with the result reached by the Court of Appeals, we\r\nfind the court incorrectly analyzed Petitioners' arguments. Accordingly, we affirm\r\nas modified.              I. Factual/Procedural History\r\n\r\n      Bayshore Corp. is a Virginia corporation that is in the business of\r\nmanufacturing pre-cast concrete products for use in construction projects. On\r\nApril 21, 2000, the Board of Directors for Bayshore Corp. held a meeting to\r\ndiscuss a bid it secured to supply pre-cast concrete forms for use in the Carolina\r\nBays Parkway project (the \"project\") in Horry County, South Carolina. On that\r\nsame day, Bayshore Corp. formed Bayshore SC as its wholly owned subsidiary for\r\nthe purpose of acting as a remote casting yard to fulfill the bid locally for the\r\nproject. Bayshore Corp. then executed a lease for the South Carolina factory site\r\nand purchased casting equipment from the previous tenant, Traylor Brothers, to be\r\nused by Bayshore SC. Bayshore SC paid the rent for the leased property and used\r\nthe equipment to produce the concrete forms. As a term of the lease, Bayshore SC\r\nwas required to return the worksite to its original condition.\r\n\r\n       As the project reached its final stages, Bayshore SC began the cleanup of the\r\nworksite by dismantling the equipment and casting beds that were used to create\r\nthe pre-stressed concrete forms. Because many of the Bayshore SC payroll\r\nemployees left to seek other employment as the project drew to a close, Bayshore\r\nSC sought to hire temporary laborers to assist in the site cleanup and equipment\r\ndismantling. Bayshore SC contracted with Job Place to hire workers to help with\r\nthe project, including Poch and Key.\r\n\r\n      On June 6, 2002, Poch and Key were directed by Larry Lenart, Bayshore\r\nSC's supervisor, to enter a trench dug by Lenart in order to dig around buried steel\r\ngirders to extract the concrete abutments. When the trench collapsed, Key was\r\n\r\n1 Tidewater Skanska Group, Inc., and Tidewater Skanska, Inc., related entities that\r\nperformed engineering and construction services, were dismissed as defendants.\r\n\ninjured and Poch was killed. After the accident, Poch's estate and Key received\r\nworkers' compensation benefits through Job Place.\r\n\r\n       Subsequently, Petitioners sued Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC in tort. In\r\ntheir Answer, Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC claimed Poch and Key were\r\nstatutory employees of both the parent and the subsidiary. Based on this claim,\r\nBayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC moved for summary judgment or, alternatively,\r\nfor a dismissal due to the lack of subject matter jurisdiction because workers'\r\ncompensation was the exclusive remedy for Poch and Key.\r\n\r\n       After a hearing, during which the parties submitted affidavits2 and\r\ndeposition testimony, the circuit court ruled that Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC\r\nwere immune from civil suit as Petitioners' claims fell within the exclusive\r\njurisdiction of the Workers' Compensation Act (the \"Act\"). In so ruling, the court\r\nfound: (1) Poch and Key were leased employees who performed the work of\r\nBayshore SC and, in turn, that of Bayshore Corp. at the time of the accident; (2)\r\nboth corporations were entitled to immunity pursuant to the workers' compensation\r\nexclusivity provision because Bayshore SC, the special employer of Poch and Key,\r\nwas performing the work of Bayshore Corp.; (3) Bayshore SC and Bayshore Corp.\r\nwere statutory employers of Poch and Key because the employees were performing\r\nthe work of both corporations; (4) both Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC were\r\nentitled to workers' compensation exclusivity under the contractor/subcontractor\r\nanalysis; and (5) both corporations were entitled to tort immunity as they secured\r\nworkers' compensation coverage for Poch and Key.\r\n\r\n       Following the denial of their motions for reconsideration, Petitioners\r\nappealed the circuit court's order to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals\r\naffirmed the decision of the circuit court. Poch v. Bayshore Concrete\r\nProducts/South Carolina, Inc., 386 S.C. 13, 686 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App. 2009). In\r\nfinding that Petitioners' exclusive remedy was workers' compensation benefits, the\r\ncourt ruled: (1) Bayshore SC was Poch's and Key's statutory employer;3 (2)\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The court denied Petitioners' motions to exclude the affidavits of (1) S.

Id. at 23-32, 686\r\nS.E.2d at 694-99.\r\n\r\n      This Court granted a writ of certiorari to consider whether the Court of\r\nAppeals erred in holding that: (1) Bayshore Corp. was entitled to tort immunity as\r\nan upstream, statutory employer of Poch and Key; and (2) Bayshore Corp. and\r\nBayshore SC complied with the statutory requirements of securing workers'\r\ncompensation coverage for Poch and Key. We denied the petition as to Petitioners'\r\nchallenge regarding the admission of the affidavits.\r\n\r\n                                   II. Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Jurisdictional Implications of Exclusive-Remedy Doctrine\r\n\r\n       \"The Workers' Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy against an\r\nemployer for an employee's work-related accident or injury.\" Edens v. Bellini, 359\r\nS.C. 433, 441, 597 S.E.2d 863, 867 (Ct. App. 2004). \"The exclusivity provision\r\nof the Act precludes an employee from maintaining a tort action against an\r\nemployer where the employee sustains a work-related injury.\" Id. at 441-42, 597\r\nS.E.2d 867. This exclusivity provision states:\r\n\r\n             The rights and remedies granted by this Title to an employee\r\n      when he and his employer have accepted the provisions of this Title,\r\n      respectively, to pay and accept compensation on account of personal\r\n      injury or death by accident, shall exclude all other rights and remedies\r\n\r\n4 See Cason v. Duke Energy Corp., 348 S.C. 544, 547 n.2, 560 S.E.2d 891, 893 n.2\r\n(2002) (\"The only exceptions to the exclusivity provisions are: (1) where the\r\ninjury results from the act of a subcontractor who is not the injured person's direct\r\nemployer; (2) where the injury is not accidental but rather results from the\r\nintentional act of the employer or its alter ego; (3) where the tort is slander and the\r\ninjury is to reputation; or (4) where the Act specifically excludes certain\r\noccupations\" (citations omitted)). Recently, this Court adopted the \"dual persona\"\r\ndoctrine as a narrow exception to the exclusivity provision. Mendenall v.\r\nAnderson Hardwood Floors, L.L.C., 401 S.C. 558, 738 S.E.2d 251 (2013). Our\r\ndecision in Mendenall, however, does not affect the disposition of the instant case\r\nas the facts do not warrant an application of the \"dual persona\" doctrine.\r\n\n        of such employee, his personal representative, parents, dependents or\r\n        next of kin as against his employer, at common law or otherwise, on\r\n        account of such injury, loss of service or death.\r\n\r\n               Provided, however, this limitation of actions shall not apply to\r\n        injuries resulting from acts of a subcontractor of the employer or his\r\n        employees or bar actions by an employee of one subcontractor against\r\n        another subcontractor or his employees when both subcontractors are\r\n        hired by a common employer.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-540 (1985). \"The exclusivity provision of the Act applies\r\nboth to 'direct' employees and to those termed 'statutory employees' under § 42-1-\r\n400.\"5 Edens, 359 S.C. at 445, 597 S.E.2d at 869.\r\n\r\n       \"South Carolina courts have repeatedly held that determination of the\r\nemployer-employee relationship for workers' compensation purposes is\r\njurisdictional. Consequently, this Court has the power and duty to review the\r\nentire record and decide the jurisdictional facts in accord with the preponderance\r\nof the evidence.\" Glass v. Dow Chem. Co., 325 S.C. 198, 201-02, 482 S.E.2d 49,\r\n51 (1997). \"Any doubts as to a worker's status should be resolved in favor of\r\nincluding him or her under the Worker's Compensation Act.\" Posey v.

App. 2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5   Section 42-1-400 provides:\r\n\r\n               When any person, in this section and §§ 42-1-420 and 42-1-430\r\n        referred to as \"owner,\" undertakes to perform or execute any work\r\n        which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with\r\n        any other person (in this section and §§ 42-1-420 to 42-1-450 referred\r\n        to as \"subcontractor\") for the execution or performance by or under\r\n        such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by\r\n        such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any workman\r\n        employed in the work any compensation under this Title which he\r\n        would have been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately\r\n        employed by him.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-400 (1985).\r\n\nB.    Status of Bayshore SC\r\n\r\n      Petitioners assert the Court of Appeals erred in determining that Bayshore\r\n     6\r\nCorp. was entitled to workers' compensation exclusivity as a statutory employer of\r\nPoch and Key. In support of this assertion, Petitioners claim that Bayshore Corp.\r\nwas a \"co-subcontractor\" with Bayshore SC. Citing section 42-1-540 of the South\r\nCarolina Code, Petitioners contend this status negates workers' compensation\r\nexclusivity as it does \"not apply to injuries resulting from acts of a subcontractor of\r\nthe employer or his employees.\" Petitioners explain that \"Poch, Key, and Lenart\r\nwere co-subcontractors hired by a common employer on the Carolina Bays\r\nParkway project.\" In turn, \"Lenart's employer, Bayshore Corp. (VA) is not entitled\r\nto immunity\" from tort liability.\r\n\r\n       \"In determining whether an employee is engaged in activity that is 'part of\r\n[the owner's] trade, business, or occupation' as required under section 42-1-400,\r\nthis Court has applied three tests.\" Olmstead v. Shakespeare, 354 S.C. 421, 424,\r\n581 S.E.2d 483, 485 (2003). \"The activity is considered 'part of [the owner's]\r\ntrade, business, or occupation' for purposes of the statute if it (1) is an important\r\npart of the owner's business or trade; (2) is a necessary, essential, and integral part\r\nof the owner's business; or (3) has previously been performed by the owner's\r\nemployees.\" Id. \"If the activity at issue meets even one of these three criteria, the\r\ninjured employee qualifies as the statutory employee of 'the owner.' \" Id.\r\n\r\n       We find Bayshore SC qualifies as a statutory employer under one, if not all\r\nthree, of these tests. First, the work being performed by Poch and Key was an\r\nimportant part of Bayshore SC's business activities as Colonna, the president of\r\nboth Bayshore SC and Bayshore Corp., testified the collapsed trench was dug in\r\norder to dismantle a concrete casting bed by removing concrete abutments from\r\nsteel piles driven into the ground. He confirmed that dismantling casting beds was\r\nperformed regularly by Bayshore employees as Bayshore \"couldn't be in the\r\nbusiness of precast concrete for long if [it] didn't have the capacity to change []\r\nform size and be able to meet customer needs.\"\r\n\r\n       Second, Colonna testified that dismantling casting beds was a necessary and\r\nintegral part of Bayshore's business, which was routinely completed by regular,\r\n\r\n\r\n6Based on our review of Petitioners' briefs, it appears they concede that Bayshore\r\nSC was a statutory employer as they primarily challenge Bayshore Corp.'s status.\r\nHowever, for the purposes of analytical progression, we have analyzed Bayshore\r\nSC's status.\r\n\npayroll employees at every Bayshore facility. He also noted that the concrete bed\r\nbeing dismantled by Poch and Key had been constructed by regular Bayshore SC\r\nemployees. Furthermore, Lenart stated that he dug the trench around the\r\nabutments and then instructed Poch and Key to enter the trench and dig around the\r\npile caps and steel beams so that Bayshore SC welders could cut the steel beams.\r\n\r\n        As to the third test, there is evidence that the dismantling of the concrete\r\nforms and the worksite cleanup had previously been performed by Bayshore SC\r\nemployees for several months prior to leasing Poch and Key. Colonna and Lenart\r\ntestified that Bayshore SC leased Poch and Key to assist the remaining regular\r\nBayshore SC employees in restoring the site to its original condition. Lenart, the\r\nBayshore SC supervisor who dug the trench, testified that both leased and regular\r\nemployees all worked together to disassemble the facilities, dig trenches, separate\r\nsteel, burn wood, load equipment, and dispose of trash.\r\n\r\n      Because Bayshore SC qualified as Poch's and Key's statutory employer, it\r\nwas immune from liability in tort under the Act's exclusivity provision.\r\n\r\nC.    Extension of Tort Immunity to Bayshore Corp. as Parent of Subsidiary\r\n\r\n       Even if Bayshore SC qualified as a statutory employer, Petitioners contend\r\nthe Court of Appeals erred in extending tort immunity to Bayshore Corp. based on\r\na contractor/subcontractor analysis. Petitioners assert the appropriate analysis is\r\ngoverned by Brown v. Moorhead Oil Co., 239 S.C. 604, 124 S.E.2d 47 (1962) and\r\nMonroe v. Monsanto Co., 531 F. Supp. 426 (D.S.C. 1982), as these cases assess the\r\nidentity between a parent corporation and its subsidiary for workers' compensation\r\nand tort immunity purposes.\r\n\r\n       Applying this legal standard, Petitioners assert Bayshore Corp. cannot claim\r\nimmunity based on its relationship to its subsidiary because Bayshore SC was a\r\nseparate and distinct corporate entity at the time of the accident. In support of this\r\nclaim, Petitioners characterize the parent-subsidiary relationship as follows: (1)\r\nBayshore SC, rather than Bayshore Corp., was the \"owner\" of the project; (2)\r\nBayshore Corp. set up Bayshore SC as a \"separate entity to independently perform\r\nwork in South Carolina\"; (3) Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC were \"formally\r\nrecorded as being separate corporate entities at the time of the accident\"; (4) the\r\nBoard of Directors of both companies were not \"identical\"; (5) the Bayshore\r\n\"entities kept separate corporate minutes\"; (6) the corporations were headquartered\r\nand transacted business in separate locations; (7) the corporations hired and paid\r\ntheir own employees separately; (8) the corporations \"strictly maintained separate\r\nbooks, account records, and bank accounts\"; and (9) the corporations maintained\r\n\nseparate federal tax identification numbers and were required to file separate tax\r\nreports.\r\n\r\n      1. Alter Ego Theory\r\n\r\n       We agree with Petitioners that the Court of Appeals applied an incorrect\r\nlegal standard; however, as will be discussed, we conclude the Court of Appeals\r\nreached the correct result despite this error.\r\n\r\n     In assessing whether the employees could maintain a tort action against\r\nBayshore Corp., we consider the following general rule:\r\n\r\n             A parent corporation is generally not immune from an action in\r\n      tort by an injured employee of its subsidiary by virtue of the\r\n      employee's entitlement to workers' compensation. Where an\r\n      employee of a subsidiary is injured while working on property owned\r\n      by the parent corporation and receives workers' compensation benefits\r\n      from the subsidiary, the employee may maintain an action in tort\r\n      against the parent corporation even though parent and subsidiary are\r\n      covered by same policy of workers' compensation insurance.\r\n\r\n             However, a parent corporation's immunity has been recognized\r\n      in some instances on the theory that the parent is or may be found to\r\n      be the alter ego of the employer-subsidiary corporation.\r\n\r\n82 Am. Jur. 2d Workers' Compensation § 90 (2003) (footnotes omitted); see\r\nAnnotation, Workers' Compensation Immunity as Extending to One Owning\r\nControlling Interest in Employer Corporation, 30 A.L.R.4th 948, § 2 (1984 &\r\nSupp. 2013) (discussing alter ego theory by which a parent corporation may seek\r\ntort immunity via its interest in the employer-corporation; noting that immunity\r\ndoes not extend where: (1) parent and subsidiary are separate and distinct entities;\r\nor (2) there is evidence of fraud, abuse of corporate privilege, or an attempt to\r\ncircumvent the law to avoid liability).\r\n\r\n       Initially, we note that Bayshore Corp., in seeking immunity, did not rely\r\nsolely on the parent-subsidiary designation. Instead, Bayshore Corp. presented\r\nevidence through affidavits and deposition testimony to establish that the two\r\ncorporations could be viewed as only one economic entity.\r\n\r\n      In examining the relationship between the two corporations, we recognize\r\nthe correct approach is the one found in Monroe v. Monsanto Company, 531 F.\r\n\nSupp. 426 (D.S.C. 1982).7 See John D. DeDoncker, Note, Adopting an Economic\r\nReality Test When Determining Parent Corporations' Status for Workers'\r\nCompensation Purposes, 12 J. Corp. L. 569, 577 (1987) (analyzing different\r\ntheories to assess parent-subsidiary relationship for workers' compensation\r\npurposes; discussing Monroe and stating, \"[t]he alter ego theory functions on the\r\npremise that when two corporations operate essentially as one, they should be\r\nconsidered as one for workers' compensation purposes\").\r\n\r\n       In Monroe, the plaintiff sustained injuries while employed at the Fovil\r\nManufacturing Company. Monroe, 531 F. Supp. at 427. The plaintiff lost his arm\r\nin a machine called the Gamble Cutter, which was designed, built, and placed in\r\nthe Fovil plant by the Hale Manufacturing Company and the Monsanto Company.\r\nId. After receiving workers' compensation benefits from Fovil, the plaintiff filed\r\nsuit against Monsanto and Hale. Id. at 428. Monsanto owned all outstanding\r\ncapital stock of Fovil and Hale. Id. at 431. The defendants moved for summary\r\njudgment on the ground the action was barred by the exclusivity provision of the\r\nWorkers' Compensation Act. Id. at 427. The basis for the motion was their claim\r\nthat both Fovil and Hale were wholly owned corporate subsidiaries of Monsanto\r\nand that all three corporations were in essence a single entity. Id. The plaintiff\r\nonly opposed the motion as to Hale. Id. Ultimately, the United States District\r\nCourt of South Carolina denied the motion, finding Hale was a separate and\r\ndistinct corporate entity from that of the plaintiff's employer, Fovil. As a result, the\r\ncourt found that Hale could not escape tort liability. Id. at 434-35.\r\n\r\n       In reaching this conclusion, the court analyzed South Carolina law8 and\r\ngleaned eight factors that courts should consider in determining whether two\r\nrelated businesses are separate and distinct corporations for workers' compensation\r\npurposes. Id. at 432-34. These factors may be assessed by answering the\r\nfollowing questions:\r\n\r\n7 Although the Court of Appeals referenced Monroe, it declined to apply it as the\r\ncourt believed the contractor/subcontractor analysis was more appropriate. Poch,\r\n386 S.C. at 27 n.3, 686 S.E.2d at 697 n.3 (\"Though we believe Monroe is\r\npersuasive, we do not believe it is controlling, and we rely upon other case law\r\nfrom South Carolina.\").\r\n8 Specifically, the court considered the following cases: (1) Gordon v. Hollywood-\r\nBeaufort Package Corp., 213 S.C. 438, 49 S.E.2d 718 (1948); (2) Brown v.\r\nMoorhead Oil Co., 239 S.C. 604,124 S.E.2d 47 (1962); and (3) Strickland v.\r\nTextron, Inc., 433 F. Supp. 326 (D.S.C. 1977).\r\n\n      (1)\t   Did the two businesses maintain separate corporate identities?\r\n\r\n      (2)\t   Did the two businesses maintain separate Boards of Directors?\r\n\r\n      (3)\t   Did the two businesses transact business from different       \n\r\n             locations under different managers? \n\r\n\r\n      (4)\t   Did the two businesses hire and pay their own employees?\r\n\r\n      (5)\t   Did the two corporations hold themselves out to their \n\r\n             employees as two separate identities? \n\r\n\r\n      (6)\t   Did the two corporations engage in different business \n\r\n             activities? \n\r\n\r\n      (7)\t   Did the two corporations maintain separate books, bank \n\r\n             accounts, and payroll records? \n\r\n\r\n      (8)\t   Did the two corporations file separate tax returns?\r\n\r\nId. at 434. Although the court enumerated these eight factors, it emphasized that\r\nthese factors were not the only relevant factors and that none of the factors alone\r\nprovided immunity. Id.\r\n\r\n      2. Application of Monroe Factors\r\n      Keeping in mind that no one factor is controlling, the weight of the evidence\r\nsupports a finding that Bayshore SC was the alter ego of Bayshore Corp.\r\n\r\n       First, the two businesses did not clearly maintain separate identities as\r\nColonna, the president of both corporations, testified that \"Bayshore\" was used\r\n\"interchangeably\" in signing documents, including the lease agreement for the\r\nproject and the Job Place contract. Furthermore, documents such as letterhead,\r\nemployment applications, benefits packages, and safety manuals used at the South\r\nCarolina site displayed a standard Bayshore Corp. designation. In terms of\r\nworkers' compensation coverage, Colonna testified that one policy covered all\r\ncorporations but that separate, self-insured reserve funds were set up for each\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\n       Second, with the exception of two people, the corporations shared the same\r\nofficers and directors. In fact, Bayshore SC's Board of Directors was comprised\r\n\nentirely of members of the Bayshore Corp.'s Board of Directors. All officers\r\nreceived their salaries from Bayshore Corp. Notably, the same legal counsel,\r\nsafety director, and engineers were used for both corporations and paid by\r\nBayshore Corp.\r\n\r\n       As to the third factor, Bayshore Corp. was headquartered in Virginia\r\nwhereas Bayshore SC operated exclusively in South Carolina. However, Bayshore\r\nCorp. entered into the lease agreement in South Carolina, purchased the equipment\r\nto be used on the jobsite, and periodically sent several Bayshore Corp. employees\r\nto oversee the completion of the project. Significantly, all of the billing invoices\r\nand normal correspondence for Bayshore SC were sent to Bayshore Corp. in Cape\r\nCharles, Virginia. Bayshore Corp. also retained all of Bayshore SC's corporate and\r\npersonnel files.\r\n\r\n       In terms of the fourth factor, Colonna testified that the hiring and firing of\r\nsalaried employees at the South Carolina site was done by a Bayshore Corp.\r\nemployee. He further testified that salaried employees, who worked on the South\r\nCarolina site, received a paycheck from Bayshore Corp. and were provided 401(k)\r\nplans and healthcare coverage through Bayshore Corp. These salaried employees\r\nincluded: (1) Lenart, the production supervisor; (2) Brandon Rowe, the plant\r\nmanager; and (3) Randy Maccoon, the quality control supervisor. Hourly\r\nemployees were paid through Bayshore SC. Bayshore SC also hired the temporary\r\nworkers, including Poch and Key, to assist on the site. Toward the conclusion of\r\nthe project, the invoices for these workers were paid through the accounts payable\r\ndepartment at Bayshore Corp.\r\n\r\n       Regarding the fifth factor, the two corporations did not hold themselves out\r\nto their employees as separate entities as Bayshore SC employees were provided\r\nwith employment documents that were standard for Bayshore Corp.\r\n\r\n       As to the sixth factor, both corporations engaged in the same business\r\nactivity of providing concrete forms for construction sites. Both corporations also\r\nused the same process and equipment in performing this work.\r\n\r\n      In terms of the seventh factor, the two corporations maintained separate\r\nbooks, accounting records, and bank accounts for purposes of financial\r\naccountability. However, Bayshore SC contributed to Bayshore Corp.'s gross\r\nrevenues. More importantly, Bayshore Corp. was entirely responsible for the\r\nfinancial operation of Bayshore SC.\r\n\n       Finally, as to the eighth factor, the two corporations maintained separate tax\r\nidentification numbers and filed separate tax returns. Admittedly, the separate tax\r\nreturn filings militate against the Respondents; however, this one factor, though\r\nweighty, is not dispositive in the workers' compensation context. Considering the\r\npreponderance of the evidence, we conclude that Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC\r\noperated as one economic entity.\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we find the circuit court and the Court of Appeals\r\ncorrectly determined that Bayshore Corp. was immune from the employees' tort\r\nactions as the two corporations could be viewed as only one economic entity.9 See\r\n1 William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations §\r\n43.80 (Supp. 2012) (\"A holding company and its wholly owned subsidiary will be\r\nconsidered a single employer for workers' compensation purposes if the two\r\ncorporations are so integrated and commingled that neither can be realistically\r\nviewed as a separate economic entity.\").10\r\n\r\nD. \t   Bayshore Corp.'s Status with Respect to Procurement of Workers'\r\n       Compensation Insurance\r\n       If Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC were immune from tort liability due to\r\ntheir employment/corporate status, Petitioners claim the Court of Appeals erred in\r\nfinding the corporations could benefit from this immunity as they failed to offer\r\nproof of or secure workers' compensation coverage for Poch and Key in violation\r\nof the provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9  In applying the eight-factor Monroe test, the dissent reaches the opposite\r\nconclusion. The dissent's position, which is contrary to our view, the decision of\r\nthe Court of Appeals, and the circuit court's holding, is based on no specific\r\nevidence. Rather, the dissent offers a cursory review of the few factors that favor\r\nits position. Although the Monroe test is not mathematically precise and no single\r\nfactor is determinative, we believe the dissent may have overlooked the\r\npreponderance of the evidence to reach a desired result.\r\n10  In view of this conclusion, we reject Petitioners' \"co-subcontractor\" contention\r\nas neither corporation comes within the definition of a \"subcontractor.\" See\r\nBlack's Law Dictionary 1437 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \"subcontractor\" as \"One who\r\nis awarded a portion of an existing contract by a contractor, esp. a general\r\ncontractor\").\r\n\n      Citing section 42-5-4011 of the South Carolina Code and this Court's\r\ndecision in Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 523 S.E.2d 766\r\n(1999), Petitioners assert that \"each entity who seeks to take advantage of Workers'\r\nCompensation immunity must demonstrate that it secured Workers' Compensation\r\nbenefits for the statutory employee, even if the statutory employee's immediate\r\nemployer has already secured those benefits.\"\r\n\r\n       Petitioners further assert that \"neither Bayshore Corp. (VA) nor Bayshore\r\nSC secured compensation directly or indirectly for Poch and Key, nor did they\r\nmeet the requirements of section 42-1-415(B)\" of the South Carolina Code,12\r\nwhich provides a method by which a corporation can demonstrate that their\r\nstatutory employees are covered by workers' compensation insurance at the time of\r\nhiring even though the corporation is not directly liable as a statutory employer.\r\n\r\n11   Section 42-5-40 provides:\r\n\r\n                Any employer required to secure the payment of compensation\r\n        under this Title who refuses or neglects to secure such compensation .\r\n        . . shall be liable during continuance of such refusal or neglect to an\r\n        employee either for compensation under this Title or at law in an\r\n        action instituted by the employee or his personal representative\r\n        against such employer to recover damages for personal injury or death\r\n        by accident and in any such action such employer shall not be\r\n        permitted to defend upon any of the grounds mentioned in Section 42-\r\n        1-510.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-5-40 (1985). This code section was amended effective July\r\n1, 2007. However, because the work-related accident occurred on June 6, 2002,\r\nwe cite to the earlier version of the statute.\r\n12   Section 42-1-415 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n        To qualify for reimbursement under this section, the higher tier\r\n        subcontractor, contractor, or project owner must collect\r\n        documentation of insurance as provided in subsection (A) on a\r\n        standard form acceptable to the commission. The documentation\r\n        must be collected at the time the contractor or subcontractor is\r\n        engaged to perform work and must be turned over to the commission\r\n        at the time a claim is filed by the injured employee.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-415(B) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\n        Essentially, Petitioners challenge the following findings of the Court of\r\nAppeals: (1) section 42-5-40 concerns only the ability of an upstream employer to\r\nshift the burden of workers' compensation coverage onto the state Uninsured\r\nEmployer's Fund and cannot be applied to prevent an employer from benefitting\r\nfrom the exclusivity provision; and (2) section 42-1-415(B) applies only to\r\nsituations when a person seeks to qualify for reimbursement from the Uninsured\r\nEmployer's Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Insurance Requirements as Interpreted in Harrell\r\n\r\n        We find the Court of Appeals' interpretation of section 42-5-40 is erroneous\r\nas it is in direct conflict with this Court's decision in Harrell. In that case, Harrell,\r\nan employee of Folk Land Management, Inc., filed a negligence action against\r\nPineland Plantation, Ltd., the partnership that owned and operated a plantation\r\nmaintained as a vacation resort where Harrell sustained an injury for which he\r\nreceived workers' compensation benefits from Folk. Harrell, 337 S.C. at 317-19,\r\n523 S.E.2d at 768-69. After settling his workers' compensation claim against\r\nFolk, Harrell brought a tort action against Pineland for negligence. Id. at 319, 523\r\nS.E.2d at 769. The circuit court dismissed Harrell's complaint on the ground his\r\nexclusive remedy was under the Workers' Compensation Act. Id.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court's order, finding\r\nHarrell could sue Pineland in an action at law. Id. This Court granted a writ of\r\ncertiorari to consider whether Pineland was Harrell's statutory employer under the\r\nAct and whether Pineland was immune from tort pursuant to the Act's exclusive\r\nremedy provision even though it did not purchase its own workers' compensation\r\ncoverage or otherwise qualify as self-insured under the Act. Id. at 320, 523 S.E.2d\r\nat 769. Having found Pineland was Harrell's statutory employer, we analyzed\r\nwhether Pineland could claim immunity under the Act even though it did not\r\nprovide any form of workers' compensation insurance. Id. at 325, 523 S.E.2d at\r\n772. Because Pineland failed to secure the payment of compensation as prescribed\r\nby sections 42-5-10 and -20 of the Act, we held that Pineland could not avail itself\r\nof tort immunity under the Act's exclusive remedy provision. Id. at 331, 523\r\nS.E.2d at 775. In reaching this conclusion, we explained that \"an employer who\r\nfails to secure the payment of compensation as prescribed in section 42-5-20 loses\r\nits immunity under the Act's exclusive remedy provision\" and becomes liable\r\n\neither under the Act or in an action at law pursuant to section 42-5-40. Id. at 327,\r\n523 S.E.2d at 773 (emphasis added).\r\n       In Glover v. United States, 337 S.C. 307, 523 S.E.2d 763 (1999), we\r\nreaffirmed our decision in Harrell, explaining that:\r\n\r\n              Under the Act, the basic duty of any employer, whether it be the\r\n      direct employer or statutory employer, is the obligation to secure the\r\n      payment of compensation as prescribed by section 42-5-20.\r\n      Compliance with this obligation is the quid pro quo exacted from the\r\n      employer in exchange for immunity. Thus, a statutory employer who\r\n      fails to secure the payment of compensation as prescribed by section\r\n      42-5-20 may not claim immunity under the Act.\r\n\r\nId. at 310-11, 523 S.E.2d at 764.\r\n\r\n      1. Procurement of Insurance\r\n       Based on Harrell and its progeny, Petitioners are correct that Bayshore\r\nCorp. and Bayshore SC could have lost their tort immunity had they failed to\r\nprocure workers' compensation coverage for Poch and Key at the time of hiring.\r\nHowever, we hold the corporations preserved their immunity as there is evidence\r\nto support the circuit court's finding that \"both retained worker's compensation\r\ninsurance that would have covered [Petitioners] had Job Place/Personnel Resources\r\nfailed to secure coverage.\"\r\n\r\n       Although a lack of coverage was not directly contested before the circuit\r\ncourt, the Respondents nevertheless offered the affidavit of Richard Stadler, the\r\nconstruction underwriter for St. Paul/Travelers Insurance Company. Stadler\r\nattested that Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC had workers' compensation\r\ncoverage at the time of the accident as there was an \"insurance policy [that]\r\ncover[ed] Bayshore Concrete Products Corporation and of South Carolina Inc.\"13\r\n\r\n13  The dissent refuses to accept this affidavit as evidence of proof of workers'\r\ncompensation insurance. The dissent, however, neither challenges the truthfulness\r\nof the affidavit nor offers supporting authority for its position. Accordingly, we\r\ndiscern no basis for which to reject the affidavit as it is by its very nature a sworn\r\nstatement intended as documentary evidence in a legal proceeding. See Marine\r\nWharf & Storage Co. v. Parsons, 49 S.C. 136, 139, 26 S.E. 956, 966 (1897) (\"An\r\n'affidavit' is defined in 1 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, p. 307, to be 'a formal written (or\r\nprinted) voluntary ex parte statement sworn (or affirmed) to before an officer\r\nauthorized to take it, to be used in legal proceedings.' \").\r\n\nAdditionally, Colonna, who is the president of both corporations, testified that\r\nworkers' compensation coverage was secured for the South Carolina site at the\r\ntime of the accident. He further noted that \"an excess or umbrella policy,\" which\r\nwas above the self-insured reserved, covered \"all the companies.\"14 Thus, without\r\nevidence to the contrary, we find the corporate entities complied with the\r\nrequirements of Harrell.\r\n\r\n       The dissenters reach a contrary result by placing form over substance as to\r\nthe issue of procurement of insurance by Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC.\r\nWithout dispute, evidence of compliance with section 42-5-20 is required of every\r\nemployer subject to the provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. Section 42-\r\n5-20, however, allows employers to provide proof of insurance or financial ability\r\nto pay through various sources, including self-insurance. Notably, the\r\nresponsibility for filing proof of compliance with section 42-5-20 falls on the\r\ninsurance carrier unless the employer is self-insured. Here, contrary to the\r\ndissenters' assumption, Bayshore's alleged umbrella insurance policy did not\r\ntransform Bayshore into a self-insured employer. Thus, because Bayshore\r\nprocured the requisite insurance policy and was not self-insured, the insurance\r\ncarrier bore the responsibility of providing proof of insurance coverage. Should\r\nBayshore be penalized for failing to do something that it was not required to do?\r\nWe think not. We must also recognize there was no allegation or evidence in the\r\nrecord to suggest that proof of compliance with section 42-5-20 was not filed.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, we emphasize that this case did not go to trial but, rather, was\r\npresented in the posture of Respondents' motion for summary judgment or\r\nalternative motion to dismiss. Undoubtedly, the parties were aware that the\r\nevidence presented at this hearing would include affidavits. The affidavit of the\r\nconstruction underwriter for St. Paul/Travelers Insurance Company specifically\r\nstated that the insurance policy covered Poch's and Key's workers' compensation\r\nclaims. This affidavit was not challenged during the motion hearing. Yet,\r\ninexplicably, the dissenters find this unchallenged affidavit from the insurance\r\ncarrier to be insufficient evidence at the summary judgment/motion to dismiss\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n      Having concluded that Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC secured workers'\r\ncompensation coverage, we find Petitioners' reliance on section 42-1-415(B) is\r\nmisplaced as that provision applies only in cases involving reimbursement from the\r\n\r\n\r\n14 Despite Colonna's use of the term \"self-insured,\" there was an insurance policy\r\nin existence that provided workers' compensation coverage.\r\n\nUninsured Employer's Fund and neither corporation in the instant case sought to\r\ntransfer liability to the Fund. See Hopper v. Terry Hunt Constr., 383 S.C. 310,\r\n315, 680 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2009) (interpreting section 42-1-415 and stating, \"Liability\r\nmay only be transferred from the higher tier contractor to the Fund after the higher\r\ntier contractor has properly documented the lower tier contractor's claim that it\r\nretains workers' compensation insurance\").\r\n\r\n                                  III. Conclusion\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we find the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the\r\ndecision of the circuit court as Bayshore SC and Bayshore Corp. proved they were\r\nentitled to immunity from tort under the Act's exclusivity provision. However, in\r\nreaching this decision, the Court of Appeals erred in its analysis as it should have\r\nutilized the alter ego theory rather than the contractor/subcontractor doctrine in\r\ndetermining whether tort immunity extended to Bayshore Corp. Furthermore, the\r\nCourt of Appeals misinterpreted this Court's decision in Harrell as a statutory\r\nemployer can lose its immunity under the Act's exclusive remedy provision if the\r\nemployer fails to secure the payment of workers' compensation as prescribed by\r\nthe Act. Because Bayshore SC and Bayshore Corp. secured such coverage, they\r\nretained their immunity. Accordingly, we affirm as modified the decision of the\r\nCourt of Appeals.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n      KITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. TOAL,\r\nC.J., and PLEICONES, J., concur in part and dissent in part in separate\r\nopinions.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:               I respectfully concur in part, and dissent in part.\r\nFirst, I agree wholeheartedly with the majority's adoption of the Monroe15 factors\r\nand its application of these factors in the instant case. In my opinion, the evidence\r\nsupports a finding that Bayshore SC was the alter ego of Bayshore Corp. and both\r\nshould be immune from liability in tort as statutory employers of Poch and Key.\r\n\r\n       As to Petitioners' next argument, that the court of appeals erred in finding\r\nthat Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC could benefit from the immunity because\r\nthey failed to offer proof of or secure workers' compensation coverage in violation\r\nof the Act and this Court's decision in Harrell,16 the majority was correct in\r\nfinding that the court of appeals misinterpreted Harrell. I agree with the majority's\r\ninterpretation that, pursuant to Harrell, a statutory employer becomes liable under\r\nsection 42-5-40 of the South Carolina Code17 for failure to secure workers'\r\ncompensation insurance for the statutory employee in accordance with the Act.\r\n\r\n       However, I join Justice Pleicones's dissenting opinion because it is my view\r\nthat Bayshore Corp. and Bayshore SC did not submit adequate proof that they\r\nsecured or filed evidence of workers' compensation coverage as required by the\r\nAct and Harrell. See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-5-20 (Supp. 1998) (\"Every employer\r\nwho accepts the provisions of this title relative to the payment of compensation\r\nshall insure and keep insured his liability thereunder in any authorized corporation,\r\nassociation, organization, or mutual insurance association formed by a group of\r\nemployers so authorized or shall furnish to the commission satisfactory proof of\r\nhis financial ability to pay directly the compensation in the amount and manner and\r\nwhen due as provided for in this title.\"); id. § 42-5-30 (Supp. 2012) (\"Every\r\nemployer accepting the compensation provisions of this title shall file with the\r\nCommission, in form prescribed by it, annually or as often as may be necessary\r\nevidence of his compliance with the provisions of § 42-5-20 and all others relating\r\nthereto.\"); Harrell, 337 S.C. at 328, 523 S.E.2d at 774 (refusing \"to adopt an\r\ninterpretation of the Act that would allow [an employer] to claim tort immunity\r\nwithout complying with the quintessential obligation imposed upon [the employer]\r\nby the Act—the duty to secure the payment of compensation.\" (emphasis in\r\noriginal) (alterations added)). With respect to Bayshore SC's coverage, the\r\n\r\n\r\n15   Monroe v. Monsanto, 531 F. Supp. 426 (D.S.C. 1982).\r\n16   Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 523 S.E.2d 766 (1999).\r\n17   See S.C. Code Ann. § 42-5-40 (1985).\r\n\ncorporations submitted an affidavit of Richard Stadler, the construction\r\nunderwriter for St. Paul/Travelers Insurance Company as proof of coverage.18 In\r\nmy view, the content of this affidavit is grossly insufficient to establish that either\r\ncorporation procured workers' compensation insurance, filed evidence of workers'\r\ncompensation insurance, or filed evidence of financial ability sufficient to qualify\r\nas self-insured. See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 42-5-10 (1985); 42-5-20; 42-5-30; 42-5-40.\r\nStadler's affidavit does not contain the requisite specificity required under the\r\nstatute, as it does not refer to the precise type of coverage or time period covered,\r\nand thus, we are unable to discern the kind and scope of coverage allegedly in\r\neffect at the time of the accident. Moreover, there is no evidence that the\r\ncorporations filed proof of insurance with the Commission. The majority further\r\nrelies on the testimony of Keith Colonna, the president of both corporations, who\r\ntestified that the corporations secured workers' compensation insurance prior to the\r\naccident, noting that \"an excess or umbrella policy\" above the self-insured reserve,\r\ncovered \"all the companies.\" I agree with Justice Pleicones that \"the only\r\ninference to be drawn from this record in light of Mr. Colonna's testimony is that\r\nboth Bayshore entities viewed themselves as self-insured, and that the underwriter\r\nwas referring to a liability umbrella policy.\" Thus, I join his dissent in part, as I,\r\ntoo, am unwilling to hold that a mere representation of coverage by an employer is\r\nsufficient to meet the statutory requirements, and I disagree with the majority's\r\nholding that the corporations retained tort immunity because they procured\r\nworkers' compensation for the employees. The majority's conclusion is simply\r\nunsupported by this record.\r\n\r\n      Therefore, I would hold that because neither Bayshore SC nor Bayshore\r\nCorp. complied with the insuring requirement of the Act, they are liable in tort to\r\nunder section 42-5-40. Accordingly, I would reverse the court of appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18   I note that Stadler's affidavit makes no mention of Bayshore Corp.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in part and dissent in part. I agree that\r\nwe should explicitly adopt the Monroe19 test here, but reach the opposite\r\nresult when I apply that test to these facts. Further, I find no evidence that\r\neither Bayshore entity purchased workers' compensation liability insurance\r\nwithin the meaning of our statutes and conclude that neither can invoke tort\r\nimmunity.\r\nIn my opinion, there is no evidence in the record that either Bayshore SC or\r\nBayshore Corp \"insure[d] and ke[pt] insured his liability\" as required by S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 42-5-20 (Supp. 2012) and therefore both are subject to a suit in\r\ntort.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-5-40 (Supp. 2012). An affidavit from an underwriter to the\r\neffect \"[t]hat the insurance policy [covering both Bayshore entities] as written\r\nwould have provided Workers' Compensation coverage\" for petitioners is\r\ninsufficient to support a finding that the policy to which he refers contains the\r\nprovisions required by S.C. Code Ann. § 42-5-70 (1984) or that imposed by § 42-\r\n5-80(A) (Supp. 2012). In fact, the only inference to be drawn from this record in\r\nlight of Mr. Colonna's testimony is that both Bayshore entities viewed themselves\r\nas self-insured, and that the underwriter was referring to a liability umbrella policy.\r\nThere is neither evidence nor any representation that the Bayshore entities met the\r\nSouth Carolina statutory requirements for self-insurers. See S. C. Code Ann. § 42-\r\n5-20; § 42-5-50 (1984); § 42-5-10 (Supp. 2012). I am unwilling to hold that an\r\nemployer's mere representation that it is self-insured is sufficient to satisfy the\r\nstatutes, nor am I willing to agree that an umbrella policy is sufficient to meet the\r\ninsuring requirements. I disagree with the majority's conclusion that there is\r\nevidence the Bayshore entities directly purchased workers' compensation liability\r\ncoverage.\r\n\r\nBased upon my view of the evidence, I conclude neither Bayshore SC nor\r\nBayshore Corp. complied with the insuring requirement of § 42-5-20, and\r\ntherefore may be liable in tort to petitioners pursuant to § 42-5-40. Harrell V.\r\nPineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 523 S.E.2d 766 (1999).\r\nI agree we should explicitly adopt the eight-factor Monroe test for\r\ndetermining the relationship between parent and subsidiary in the workers'\r\ncompensation area. In light of this decision, we should remand the case in\r\n\r\n\r\n     Monroe v. Monsanto Co., 531 F.Supp. 426 (D.S.C. 1982).\r\n19\r\n\norder to allow the parties to present any additional relevant evidence, and to\r\nallow the Commission to make a factual determination. If, however, we are\r\nto apply this new test in this appeal, then viewing these factors in light of the\r\nfacts as recited by the majority, I would conclude that Bayshore SC and\r\nBayshore Corp. are separate economic entities. The businesses maintained\r\nseparate corporate identities, had separate Boards of Directors albeit with\r\nmany common members, were located in two different locations, hired and\r\npaid at least some of their own employees, maintained separate books, bank\r\naccounts, and payroll records, and filed separate tax returns. I therefore\r\ndisagree with the majority's conclusion that Bayshore Corp. shares Bayshore\r\nSC's status as petitioner's statutory employer. As explained above, I also\r\ndisagree with the majority's finding that the Bayshore entities met the\r\ninsuring requirement found in § 42-5-20. I therefore would find both\r\nBayshore SC and Bayshore Corp. may be liable in tort to petitioners under §\r\n42-5-40. Finally, I agree with the majority that we should explicitly adopt the\r\nMonroe test, and I also agree that § 42-1-415(B) is inapplicable here.\r\nBecause I find that both Bayshore SC and Bayshore Corp. failed to meet their\r\nstatutory workers' compensation insuring obligations, I would reverse the\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeals which upheld the circuit court finding that\r\nboth Bayshore SC and Bayshore Corp. are immune from tort liability\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27305","title":"16 Jade Street v.

Although this case poses the novel question of whether the\r\nUniform Limited Liability Company Act (LLC Act) shields an LLC member from\r\npersonal liability from his own torts, we save that discussion for another day and\r\nfind Aten has committed no actionable tort. We therefore reverse the portion of\r\nthe circuit court's order which imposes personal liability upon Aten.\r\n\r\n                FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n      R. Design Construction Company, L.L.C. is engaged in the construction\r\nindustry. Aten and his wife are the only members of R. Design, and Aten holds a\r\nresidential home builder's license. R. Design selected a parcel in Beaufort, South\r\nCarolina, on which it planned to build a four-unit condominium project. When\r\nAten could not secure the necessary financing, he approached Dennis Green, who\r\nformed 16 Jade Street, LLC to develop the property. R. Design then entered into a\r\ncontract with Jade Street to construct the condominium. Aten signed the contract\r\nas a member of R. Design and not in his personal capacity.\r\n\r\n      As part of the deal, R. Design was to be paid $150,000 to serve as the\r\ngeneral contractor for the project, and it alone was in charge of choosing\r\nsubcontractors. One of the subcontractors selected by R. Design was Catterson &\r\nSons Construction, Inc. Michael Catterson, the sole shareholder of Catterson &\r\nSons, was a subcontractor with a special framing license in addition to a general\r\ncontractor's license. Catterson & Sons' scope of work was focused primarily on\r\n\nframing and aerated autoclave concrete (AAC) block1 installation.\r\n\r\n       As the general contractor, R. Design was to supervise the project. Thus,\r\nwhenever Catterson had a question about the work he was to perform or any issues\r\nthat arose, he would ask Aten. Furthermore, Catterson & Sons was to implement\r\nthe design standards specified by Aten and R. Design. Catterson himself, however,\r\ndid not actually perform any construction but served mainly as the liaison between\r\nthe foreman and his own workers.\r\n\r\n       Several months after construction began, problems arose concerning the\r\nAAC block installation and the framing. Green called Kern-Coleman, the\r\nstructural engineer, to perform an inspection. The initial inspection identified four\r\ndefects, but Green pressed on, following Aten's assurances that these problems\r\nwould be addressed. However, the problems did not abate. Following a progress\r\npayment dispute, Catterson & Sons left the job site and did not return. In the\r\nensuing months, Aten's relationship with Green deteriorated as Aten tarried in\r\nfixing the defects, and the construction eventually ground to a halt. R. Design\r\nsubsequently left the project, never replacing Catterson & Sons nor adequately\r\naddressing the defects.\r\n\r\n      The day after R. Design left the project, Kern-Coleman conducted another\r\ninspection of the property. This time, it identified thirty-four defects in addition to\r\nthe original four, which had not yet been remedied, for a total of thirty-eight.\r\nAnchor Construction was retained as the new general contractor, and its own\r\ninspection revealed sixty defects in the original construction. After Anchor began\r\nworking on the project, more defects surfaced.\r\n\r\n       Jade Street subsequently sued R. Design, Aten, Catterson & Sons, and\r\nCatterson for negligence and breach of implied warranties. Jade Street also filed a\r\nbreach of contract claim against R. Design and Aten.2 Following a bench trial, the\r\ncircuit court found in favor of Jade Street as follows: (1) against R. Design for\r\nbreach of contract, negligence, and breach of implied warranties; (2) against\r\n\r\n1 AAC blocks are preformed concrete blocks with cavities that, when stacked,\r\npermit rebar and grouting mortar to be inserted to provide structural support.\r\n2  R. Design brought cross-claims against Catterson and Catterson & Sons for\r\nequitable indemnity and breach of contract. Aten also filed a third-party complaint\r\nagainst Kintz Electric, an electrical subcontractor. Issues relating to these claims\r\nwere not raised on appeal.\r\n\nCatterson & Sons for negligence and breach of contract; and (3) against Aten\r\npersonally for negligence in failing to supervise the subcontractors. In rejecting\r\nAten's argument that the LLC Act shielded him from personal liability, the circuit\r\ncourt additionally pointed to the fact that Aten held a residential home builder\r\nlicense and was therefore more than a \"mere member\" of the LLC. It concluded\r\nthe statutes pertaining to the license create civil liability for the licensee. The court\r\nimposed no liability against Catterson himself. Ultimately, the circuit court\r\nawarded Jade Street $925,556 in damages for its claims and awarded the same\r\namount to R. Design for its breach of contract claim against Catterson & Sons.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\n      This Court affirmed the circuit court as modified in a decision published\r\nApril 4, 2012. We subsequently granted Aten's petition for rehearing on May 4,\r\n2012. We now withdraw our previous opinion and issue this opinion.\r\n\r\n                               ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n   I.\t    Did the circuit court err in finding Aten can be held personally liable for\r\n          negligent acts he committed while working for an LLC of which he was a\r\n          member?\r\n\r\n   II.\t   Did the circuit court err in not finding Catterson personally liable for the\r\n          tortious acts of Catterson & Sons?\r\n\r\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.\t    ATEN'S PERSONAL LIABILITY\r\n       Aten argues the provisions of the LLC Act, as enacted in South Carolina,\r\nshield a member of an LLC from personal liability for ordinary negligence\r\ncommitted while working in furtherance of the LLC and therefore the circuit court\r\nerred in finding him individually liable. However, prior to addressing the statute's\r\nconstruction, we turn first to the threshold question of whether Aten owed a duty of\r\ncare upon which to establish a negligence claim. The circuit court concluded the\r\nResidential Home Builders Act creates a legal duty for a residential builder license\r\nholder. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The main factor in determining whether a statute imposes a legal duty is\r\nlegislative intent. Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 396, 645 S.E.2d 245, 248 (2007).\r\nWhether the legislature intended to create a private cause of action for the violation\r\nof a statute is determined primarily by the language of the statute. Id. Generally, if\r\n\na statute does not expressly establish civil liability, a duty will not be implied\r\nabsent evidence the legislature enacted the statute for the benefit of a private party.\r\nId. at 397, 645 S.E.2d at 248.\r\n\r\n       Section 40-59-400 of the South Carolina Code (2005) codifies the\r\ndefinitions of terms used in the Residential Home Builders Act and provides the\r\nfollowing relevant definitions:\r\n\r\n      (5)\t \"Resident licensee\" means a licensed practitioner who spends a\r\n           majority of each normal workday working out of a principal or branch\r\n           office and who is in responsible charge of the office and the building\r\n           services provided from that office including, but not limited to,\r\n           responsibility for applying for permits for the firm.\r\n\r\n      (6) \"Responsible charge\" means the direction of building services by a\r\n          residential builder, residential specialty contractor, or home inspector to\r\n          the extent that successful completion of the building services is\r\n          dependent on the personal supervision, direct control, and final\r\n          decisions by the qualified registrant to the extent that the qualified\r\n          registrant assumes professional responsibility for the building services.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Based on this language, the circuit court concluded that as a\r\nresident licensee, Aten assumed professional responsibility for the project and,\r\nfurthermore, that the use of the term professional responsibility \"is broad enough to\r\ninclude civil liability.\"\r\n\r\n       We reject this construction of the statute. Nothing in the language of the\r\nstatute evinces a legislative intent to create such a legal duty, nor was this statute\r\nenacted for the benefit of a private party. The provisions in question concern the\r\nissuance of certificates of authorization for a company engaging in residential\r\nhome-building, specialty contracting, or home inspection and serve essentially to\r\ndefine terms used within a subsection the Residential Home Builders Act. Section\r\n40-59-410 of the South Carolina Code (2005) requires the company to identify a\r\nresident licensee in \"responsible charge\" of each principal or branch office. § 40-\r\n59-410(B)(1), (D), & (H). The statute therefore requires at least one person in each\r\noffice of the company to be licensed and assume professional responsibility for the\r\nproject. However, we disagree with the court's conclusion that professional\r\nresponsibility is tantamount to civil liability. The only consequences imposed by\r\nvirtue of an individual's license are to be meted out specifically by the appropriate\r\nlicensing board, not a civil court. See S.C. Code Ann. § 40-1-110(1) (2005)\r\n\n(listing the acts for which the licensing board can sanction a licensee, including\r\nwhen he \"lacks the professional or ethical competence to practice the profession\");\r\n§ 40-59-110 (2005) (stating additional grounds for which a residential contractor,\r\nspecialty contractor, or home inspector can be sanctioned). Thus, we decline to\r\nconstrue these statutes so broadly as to create a duty in tort.\r\n\r\n        Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in finding Aten personally liable\r\nbecause he owed no duty to Jade Street. We therefore find it unnecessary to reach\r\nthe novel issue of whether the LLC Act absolves an LLC member of personal\r\nliability for negligence committed while acting in furtherance of the company\r\nbusiness. Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\nS.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding the Court need not address remaining issues when\r\ndisposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n   II.    CATTERSON'S PERSONAL LIABILITY\r\n       Jade Street also appeals the circuit court's conclusion that Catterson himself\r\nis not personally liable for the actions of Catterson & Sons. We affirm pursuant to\r\nRule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: S.C. Code Ann. § 33-6-220(b)\r\n(2006) (\"[A] shareholder of a corporation is not personally liable for the acts or\r\ndebts of the corporation except that he may become personally liable by reason of\r\nhis own acts or conduct.\"); Aaron v. Mahl, 381 S.C. 585, 591, 674 S.E.2d 482, 485\r\n(2009) (\"In an action at law, tried by a judge without a jury, the findings of the trial\r\ncourt must be affirmed if there is any evidence to support them.\").\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the circuit court's holding that Aten is\r\npersonally liable and affirm the court's finding that Catterson is not personally\r\nliable for the acts of Catterson & Sons.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

Catoe, all of Columbia, and Solicitor\r\n            John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Justin B. (Appellant), a minor under seventeen years\r\nof age, challenges the active electronic monitoring (electronic monitoring)\r\nrequirements of section 23-3-540 of the South Carolina Code. Section 23-3-540\r\nrequires that individuals convicted of certain sex-related offenses, including\r\ncriminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree (CSC–First), submit to\r\nelectronic monitoring for the duration of the time the individual is required to\r\n\nremain on the sex offender registry. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-540(A)–(H) (Supp.\r\n2012). An individual found guilty of CSC–First is required to register as a sex\r\noffender bi-annually for life. Id. §§ 23-3-430, -460 (Supp. 2012). Section 23-3-\r\n540 also provides that ten years from the date electronic monitoring begins, an\r\nindividual may petition the chief administrative judge of the general sessions court\r\nfor the county in which the offender resides for an order of release from the\r\nmonitoring requirements. Id. § 23-3-540(H). However, those persons convicted of\r\nCSC–First may not petition for this review. Id. Thus, these sex offenders must\r\nsubmit to monitoring for the duration of their lives. Appellant argues that, because\r\nhe is a juvenile, this imposition constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in\r\nviolation of the federal and state constitutions. We find electronic monitoring is\r\nnot a punishment, and reject Appellant's claim. However, Appellant must be\r\ngranted periodic judicial review to determine the necessity of continued electronic\r\nmonitoring.      FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       On May 3, 2009, Appellant's adoptive mother witnessed him sexually molest\r\nhis adoptive sister and notified police. In August 2009, Appellant was indicted for\r\nCSC–First in violation of section 16-3-655(A)(1) of the South Carolina Code. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 16-3-655(A) (Supp. 2012). Pursuant to a negotiated plea deal in\r\nwhich Appellant agreed to plead guilty if allowed to do so in family court,\r\nAppellant was brought before the family court on a juvenile petition in November\r\n2009. Appellant admitted guilt and was subsequently adjudicated delinquent. The\r\nfamily court committed Appellant for an indeterminate period to the Department of\r\nJuvenile Justice, not to exceed Appellant's twenty-first birthday, and required\r\nAppellant to undergo counseling. The family court also ordered Appellant to\r\nregister as a sex offender as required by section 23-3-460 of the South Carolina\r\nCode, and to comply with section 23-3-540's electronic monitoring requirements.\r\nId. §§ 23-3-460, -540. Appellant appealed, and this Court certified the case\r\npursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                              ISSUE PRESENTED\r\n\r\n      Whether lifetime electronic monitoring pursuant to sections 23-3-400\r\n      and -540 of the South Carolina Code is unconstitutional as a violation\r\n      of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the\r\n      Eight Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,\r\n\n      Section 15 of the South Carolina Constitution when applied to a\r\n      juvenile.             STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       All statutes are presumed constitutional, and if possible, will be construed to\r\nrender them valid. Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 569, 549 S.E.2d 591, 597 (2001).\r\nA statute will not be declared unconstitutional unless its repugnance to the\r\nconstitution is clear beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Lasure, 379 S.C. 144, 147,\r\n666 S.E.2d 228, 229 (2008). The party challenging the statute's constitutionality\r\nbears the burden of proof. In re Treatment of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 135, 568\r\nS.E.2d 338, 344 (2002).           LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides\r\n\"[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and\r\nunusual punishment inflicted.\" U.S. Const. amend. VIII; see also S.C. Const. art.\r\n1, § 15 (\"Excessive bail shall not be required . . . nor shall cruel, nor corporal, nor\r\nunusual punishment be inflicted.\"). Appellant does not argue that electronic\r\nmonitoring itself is cruel and unusual, but that \"the duration of lifetime electronic\r\nmonitoring for a juvenile offender is so severe as to constitute a violation of the\r\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\" Our determination of whether\r\nthe electronic monitoring provisions of section 23-3-540 constitute cruel and\r\nunusual punishment rests primarily on whether electronic monitoring constitutes a\r\npunishment.       I.     Civil Requirement or Criminal Punishment\r\n\r\n       We hold that Section 23-3-540's electronic monitoring requirement is a civil\r\nobligation similar to other restrictions the state may lawfully place upon sex\r\noffenders. See, e.g., Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 93 (2003) (holding that the\r\nimposition of restrictive measures on sex offenders adjudged to be potentially\r\ndangerous is a legitimate non-punitive governmental objective); In re Ronnie A.,\r\n355 S.C. 407, 409, 585 S.E.2d 311, 312 (2003) (finding lifelong sex offender\r\nregistration does not implicate a liberty interest because it is non-punitive); State v.\r\nWalls, 348 S.C. 26, 30, 558 S.E.2d 524, 526 (2001) (holding sex offender\r\n\nregistration non-punitive in purpose or effect and determining that sex offender\r\nregistration did not constitute a criminal penalty).\r\n\r\n       The United States Supreme Court's analysis in Smith v. Doe is instructive on\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n       In that case, the respondents pled nolo contendere to child molestation\r\ncharges and completed rehabilitative programs for sex offenders following their\r\nrelease from prison in 1990. Smith, 538 U.S. at 91. In 1994, the Alaska State\r\nLegislature enacted the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act (the Act). Id. at 89.\r\nThe Act required all sex offenders to register with law enforcement authorities and\r\nprovide periodic verification of the information submitted at the time of\r\nregistration. Id. at 90–91. The Act applied to sex offenders convicted prior to the\r\nAct's passage. Id. The respondents challenged the Act as an ex post facto\r\nviolation. Id. The United States District Court for the District of Alaska rejected\r\nthe respondents' claim, granting summary judgment to the state. However, the\r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that although the\r\nlegislature intended the Act \"to be a non-punitive, civil regulatory scheme,\" the\r\nAct's actual effects were punitive. Id. at 91–92.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court disagreed, beginning its inquiry by determining the\r\nlegislature's objective from the Act's text and structure. Id. at 92–93 (\"Whether a\r\nstatutory scheme is civil or criminal 'is first of all a question of statutory\r\nconstruction . . . . A conclusion that the legislature intended to punish would satisfy\r\nan ex post facto challenge without further inquiry into its effects, so considerable\r\ndeference must be accorded to the intent as the legislature has stated it.\") (citations\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court observed that the Alaska State Legislature expressed the\r\nAct's objective in the statutory test itself, finding that \"sex offenders pose a high\r\nrisk of offending,\" and identifying the public's protection as the Act's \"primary\r\ngovernmental interest.\" Id. at 93. Thus, the Supreme Court held, \"[n]othing on the\r\nface of the statute suggests that the legislature sought to create anything other than\r\na civil . . . scheme designed to protect the public from harm.\" Id. (citing Kansas v.\r\nHendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 361 (1997)). Additionally, the Supreme Court noted that\r\nthe Act did not require any procedural safeguards associated with the criminal\r\nprocess and contemplated \"distinctly civil procedures.\" Id. at 96 (concluding that\r\nthe Alaska State Legislature intended to create a civil, non-punitive regime).\r\n\n       The Supreme Court next focused its inquiry on the Act's actual effects, and\r\nrelied principally on the factors noted in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S.\r\n144 (1963),1 finding:\r\n\r\n      The factors most relevant to our analysis are whether, in its necessary\r\n      operation, the regulatory scheme: has been regarded in our history and\r\n      traditions as punishment; imposes an affirmative disability or\r\n      restraint; promotes the traditional aims of punishment; has a rational\r\n      connection to a non-punitive purpose; or is excessive with respect to\r\n      this purpose.\r\n\r\nSmith, 538 U.S. at 97.\r\n\r\n      The respondents argued that the Act's provisions resembled shaming\r\npunishments of the colonial period. Id. The Supreme Court disagreed, observing\r\nthat  [p]unishments such as whipping, pillory, and branding inflicted\r\n      physical pain and staged a direct confrontation between the offender\r\n      and the public. Even punishments that lacked the corporal\r\n      component, such as public shaming, humiliation, and banishment,\r\n      involved more than the dissemination of information. They either\r\n      held the person up before his fellow citizens for face-to-face shaming\r\n      or expelled him from the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 \"The punitive nature of the sanction here is evident under the tests traditionally\r\napplied to determine whether an Act of Congress is penal or regulatory in\r\ncharacter, even though in other cases this problem has been extremely difficult and\r\nelusive of solution. Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or\r\nrestraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether\r\nit comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will\r\npromote the traditional aims of punishment—retribution and deterrence,\r\nwhether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an\r\nalternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for\r\nit, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose\r\nassigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing\r\ndirections.\" Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168–69 (emphasis added).\r\n\nId. at 98. However, the Court found that the Act's associated stigma resulted not\r\nfrom public display for ridicule, but instead from the dissemination of accurate\r\ninformation from a criminal, and generally public, record. Id. (\"Our system does\r\nnot treat dissemination of truthful information in furtherance of a legitimate\r\ngovernmental objective as punishment. On the contrary, our criminal law tradition\r\ninsists on public indictment, public trial, and public imposition of sentence.\r\nTransparency is essential to maintaining public respect for the criminal justice\r\nsystem, ensuring its integrity, and protecting the rights of the accused.\").\r\nMoreover, the Act imposed no physical restraint, and thus did not resemble\r\nimprisonment. Id. at 99–100.\r\n\r\n       The Ninth Circuit concluded that the Act contained retributive registration\r\nobligations, thus promoting a traditional aim of punishment. Id. at 102.\r\nAdditionally, the state conceded that the Act might deter future crimes. Id.\r\nHowever, the Supreme Court found neither point required a determination that the\r\nAct constituted a punishment. Id. First, a governmental program may deter crime\r\nwithout imposing punishment, and to find that the mere presence of a deterrent\r\npurpose rendered a sanction \"criminal,\" would severely undermine the state's\r\nability to engage in effective regulation. Id. Second, the Act's reporting\r\nrequirements related to the danger of recidivism—consistent with a regulatory\r\nobjective. Id.\r\n\r\n      The Supreme Court found the Act's rational connection to a non-punitive\r\npurpose the \"most significant\" factor in determining that the Act's overall effects\r\nwere non-punitive:\r\n\r\n      As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the Act has a legitimate non-\r\n      punitive purpose of \"public safety, which is advanced by alerting the\r\n      public to the risk of sex offenders in their communit[y]\" . . . . A statute\r\n      is not deemed punitive simply because it lacks a close or perfect fit\r\n      with the non-punitive aims it seeks to advance. The imprecision [the\r\n      respondents] rely upon does not suggest that the Act's non-punitive\r\n      purpose is a \"sham or mere pretext.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 102–03 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n       Finally, the Supreme Court determined that the Act was not excessive in\r\nrelation to its regulatory purpose. The Ninth Circuit's analysis of this issue found\r\nthe Act excessive because it applied to all convicted sex offenders without regard\r\n\nto future dangerousness and placed no limitation on the number of persons with\r\naccess to the information. Id. at 103. The Supreme Court viewed neither reason\r\npersuasive, finding first that the legislature made reasonable categorical judgments\r\nregarding the \"high\" rate of recidivism among convicted sex offenders, and second,\r\nthat the notification system was passive in nature as it required an individual to\r\nseek access to the information. Id. at 104–05 (\"The excessiveness inquiry of our\r\nex post facto jurisprudence is not an exercise in determining whether the\r\nlegislature has made the best choice possible to address the problem it seeks to\r\nremedy.\").\r\n\r\n        Only the \"clearest proof\" will suffice to override legislative intent and\r\ntransform a previously denominated civil remedy into a criminal penalty. Id. at 92,\r\n105–06. In Smith, the respondents failed to establish that the effects of the Act\r\nnegated the Alaska State Legislature's intent to create a civil regulatory scheme.\r\nId. at 105–06.\r\n\r\n       In Doe v. Bredesen, 507 F.3d 998 (6th Cir. 2007), the United States Court of\r\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit relied on the reasoning of Smith in its analysis of\r\nregistration and electronic monitoring statutes passed by the Tennessee General\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n       In that case, the defendant, Doe, pled guilty to attempted aggravated\r\nkidnapping and two counts of sexual battery by an authority figure. Id. at 1000.\r\nFollowing his conviction and sentence, the legislature passed the Tennessee\r\nSerious and Violent Sex Offender Monitoring Pilot Project Act (the Monitoring\r\nAct) which authorized the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole to enroll a\r\nconvicted sex offender into an electronic monitoring program. Id. Doe claimed\r\nthat the imposition of electronic monitoring constituted an ex post facto violation.\r\nId.    In enacting the law, the legislature stated its intent to utilize the latest\r\ntechnology to monitor and track serious and violent sex offenders. Id. at 1004.\r\nAdditionally, the legislature cited statistics regarding the abnormally high rates of\r\nrecidivism among sex offenders and law enforcement's ability to use electronic\r\nmonitoring to narrow ongoing investigations to only those sex offenders that could\r\nbe linked to the crime. Id. Similar to the Supreme Court's decision in Smith, the\r\nSixth Circuit found that this purpose evinced an intent to create a civil scheme\r\ndesigned to protect the public. Id. (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 93).\r\n\n       In analyzing the statute's practical effects, the Sixth Circuit relied on the\r\nfactors the Supreme Court utilized in Smith. Id. (quoting Smith, 538 U.S. at 97).\r\nAccording to the Sixth Circuit, the Monitoring Act's registration, reporting, and\r\nsurveillance components did not constitute an affirmative disability or restraint:\r\n\r\n      The [Monitoring Act] does not increase the length of incarceration for\r\n      covered sex offenders, nor . . . prevent them from changing jobs or\r\n      residences or traveling to the extent otherwise permitted by their\r\n      conditions of parole or probation. Perhaps most significantly, the\r\n      Supreme Court held recently, in sustaining the Alaska Sex Offender\r\n      Registration Act against an ex post facto challenge, that lifetime\r\n      registration and monitoring of sexual offenders is \"less harsh\" than\r\n      other sanctions that the Court has historically considered non-\r\n      punitive, such as revocation of a medical license, preclusion from\r\n      work as a banker, and preclusion from work as a union official.\r\n\r\nId. at 1005. The court also rejected the notion that the wearing of an electronic\r\nmonitoring device served as a \"catalyst for public ridicule,\" finding:\r\n\r\n      The device that Doe must wear is relatively unobtrusive, measuring\r\n      only 6 inches by 3.25 inches by 1.75 inches and weighing less than a\r\n      pound. In its size, shape, and placement (hooked to a belt), it appears\r\n      very similar to a walkie-talkie or other nondescript electronic device.\r\n      Furthermore, we have every reason to believe that the dimensions of\r\n      the system, while not presently conspicuous, will only become smaller\r\n      and less cumbersome as technology progresses. We similarly cannot\r\n      agree that the device's appearance would suggest to the casual\r\n      observer that the wearer is a criminal, let alone a sex offender . . . .\r\n      However, even assuming the public would recognize the device as a\r\n      criminal monitor, there is no evidence to suggest an observer would\r\n      understand the wearer to be a sex offender. These devices can be\r\n      utilized in a variety of contexts, such as pretrial monitoring and work\r\n      release, and are, in fact, advertised for use in such situations. Indeed,\r\n      the dissent can only point to a single incident wherein a member of\r\n      the public recognized the device as a monitor, and, even then, there\r\n      was no evidence to suggest that the observer knew the device to be\r\n      one that monitored sex offenders, as opposed to criminals generally.\r\n\nId. The Sixth Circuit further found that, analogous to the provision analyzed in\r\nSmith, the deterrent aspects of the Monitoring Act did not negate the overall\r\nremedial and regulatory nature of the statute, and that deterrence could serve both\r\ncriminal and civil goals. Id.\r\n\r\n       The court also noted the legislature's citation of government statistics\r\nregarding sex offenders' tendency to reoffend. According to the Sixth Circuit,\r\nthese statistics supported the notion that the legislature could rationally conclude\r\nthat sex offenders presented an unusually high risk of recidivism, and that stringent\r\nelectronic monitoring could both reduce that risk and protect the public without\r\nfurther \"punishing\" sex offenders. Id. at 1006. Finally, the court held that the\r\nMonitoring Act was not excessive in relation to its regulatory purpose. Id. The\r\ncourt rooted its reasoning on this point in the guiding principle that the\r\nexcessiveness inquiry is not an exercise in determining whether the legislature\r\nmade the best choice, but instead, whether the means chosen are reasonable in light\r\nof the non-punitive objective. Id. The court concluded that the chosen means, for\r\nexample, ensuring an offender does not enter a prohibited location, supported the\r\nfinding that those means were reasonable. Id. at 1007.\r\n\r\n      Thus, because of Doe's failure to demonstrate the Monitoring Act's punitive\r\nnature, his ex post facto claim necessarily collapsed. Id. at 1007–08.\r\n\r\n      The decisions in Smith and Bredesen provide an informative guide for\r\nexamining whether electronic monitoring of sex offenders constitutes punishment\r\nfor purposes of a constitutional analysis. Additionally, the United States Court of\r\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit's decision in United States v. Under Seal, 709 F.3d\r\n257 (4th Cir. 2013), offers an enlightening complement with regard to the specific\r\njuvenile context.\r\n\r\n        In Under Seal, the appellant resided with his mother, an active duty service-\r\nmember, his stepfather, and two half-sisters ages ten and six. Id. at 259. The\r\nappellant's mother reported to the United States Naval Criminal Investigation\r\nService (NCIS) that the appellant behaved in a sexually inappropriate manner with\r\nhis two half-sisters, and an investigation confirmed that the appellant sexually\r\nmolested both girls. Id. The appellant admitted to the allegations in the United\r\nStates District Court for the District of South Carolina. Id. The district court\r\nadjudicated the appellant delinquent and sentenced him to incarceration as well as\r\na period of juvenile delinquent supervision not to exceed his twenty-first birthday.\r\nId. at 259–60. The district court also included a special condition requiring the\r\n\nappellant to comply with the mandatory reporting requirements of the Sex\r\nOffender Registration and Notification Act (the SORNA).2 Id. at 260.\r\n\r\n       The SORNA's comprehensive national registration system requires that sex\r\noffenders \"register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the\r\noffender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a\r\nstudent.\" Id. at 260–61. The offender must \"appear in person, allow the\r\njurisdiction to take a current photograph, and verify the information in each\r\nregistry.\" Id. at 261. Each jurisdiction is required to make public the contents of\r\nits sex offender registry, including each registrant's name, address, photograph,\r\ncriminal history, and applicable probationary status. Id.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, the appellant contended, inter alia, that, because of his juvenile\r\nstatus, the SORNA's registration requirements violated the Eighth Amendment's\r\nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The Fourth Circuit analyzed the\r\nSORNA's possible punitive effect utilizing the \"two-part\" test the United States\r\nSupreme Court explained in Smith, supra:\r\n\r\n      If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that ends\r\n      the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a regulatory\r\n      scheme that is civil and non-punitive, we must further examine\r\n      whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect\r\n      as to negate the State's intention to deem it civil.\r\n\r\nId. at 263 (quoting Smith, 538 U.S. at 92 and relying on the seven factors discussed\r\nin Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168–69).\r\n\r\n       The Fourth Circuit concluded that the SORNA's language, legislative\r\nhistory, and place of codification all indicated Congressional intent to create a non-\r\npunitive regulatory framework to \"keep track of sex offenders.\" Id. at 264.\r\nFurther, the Fourth Circuit held that an analysis of the relevant Mendoza-Martinez\r\nfactors compelled the conclusion that the SORNA's application to the appellant did\r\nnot have a punitive effect.\r\n\r\n2 In 2006, Congress enacted the SORNA as part of the Adam Walsh Child\r\nProtection and Safety Act of 2006, 42 U.S.C. § 16901 et seq., \"to protect the public\r\nfrom sex offenders and offenders against children, and in response to the vicious\r\nattacks by violent predators,\" and establish a comprehensive national system for\r\nthe registration of those offenders.\" 42 U.S.C. § 16901.\r\n\n       According to the Fourth Circuit, the SORNA imposed no physical restraint,\r\nand does not require changes in employment or residence, but merely required that\r\nthe appellant report those changes. Id. at 265 (\"Although [the appellant] is\r\nrequired under the SORNA to appear periodically in person to verify his\r\ninformation . . . this is not an affirmative disability or restraint . . . . Appearing in\r\nperson may be more inconvenient, but requiring it is not punitive.\" (citing United\r\nStates v. W.B.H., 664 F.3d 848, 857 (11th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, W.B.H. v.\r\nUnited States, 133 S. Ct. 524 (2012)).\r\n\r\n      Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Smith that registration requirements\r\nhave not been regarded as punishment, the appellant in Under Seal argued that\r\nbecause records in juvenile criminal cases are not made public, disseminating that\r\ninformation must be punitive. Id. The Fourth Circuit rejected this argument,\r\nholding:\r\n\r\n      A court, however, may permit the inspection of records relating to a\r\n      juvenile delinquency proceeding under some circumstances. Further,\r\n      the Supreme Court has held that \"[o]ur system does not treat\r\n      dissemination of truthful information in furtherance of a legitimate\r\n      governmental objective as punishment.\"\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Smith, 538 U.S. at 98). Third, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the\r\nSORNA did not promote the traditional aims of punishment, relying wholly on the\r\nSupreme Court's conclusion in Smith that \"any number of governmental programs\r\nmight deter crime without imposing punishment.\" Id. (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at\r\n102). The court next determined that SORNA contained a rational connection to a\r\nlegitimate, non-punitive purpose—public safety—which is advanced by notifying\r\nthe public to the risk of sex offenders in their community. Id. (\"This according to\r\nthe Supreme Court, is the 'most significant' factor in determining whether a sex\r\noffender registration system is non-punitive.\").\r\n\r\n       Finally, the Fourth Circuit found that because the SORNA applied to a\r\nspecific and limited class of juvenile offenders, the regulatory scheme was not\r\nexcessive with respect to the SORNA's non-punitive purpose. Id. at 266.\r\nAccording to the National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and\r\nNotification, the SORNA does not require\r\n\n      registration for juveniles adjudicated delinquent for all sex offenses\r\n      for which an adult sex offender would be required to register, but\r\n      rather requires registration only for a defined class of older juveniles\r\n      who are adjudicated delinquent for committing particularly serious\r\n      sexually assaultive crimes.\r\n\r\nId. (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n      Thus, the Fourth Circuit held the SORNA's registration requirements, as\r\napplied to the appellant, did not violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and\r\nunusual punishment. Id. (\"'The clearest proof' is lacking, as examination of the\r\nMendoza-Martinez factors makes clear.\").\r\n\r\n      The Smith, Bredesen, and Under Seal decisions, when taken together,\r\nprovide the ideal lens through which to review the electronic monitoring scheme\r\nAppellant challenges.             II.   Appellant's Claim\r\n\r\n      A.     Legislative Intent\r\n\r\n        Section 23-3-400 of the South Carolina Code outlines the purpose of the\r\nstate's sex offender registration and electronic monitoring statutory regime. The\r\nGeneral Assembly specified that the intent of the article is to \"promote the state's\r\nfundamental right to provide for the public health, welfare, and safety of its\r\ncitizens.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-400 (2007). Section 23-3-400 provides that,\r\nstatistically, sex offenders pose a high risk of re-offending and a lack of\r\ninformation about sex offenders impairs law enforcement's ability to \"protect\r\ncommunities, conduct investigations, and apprehend offenders.\" Id. Nothing on\r\nthe face of section 23-3-400 suggests that the General Assembly sought to create\r\nanything other than a civil scheme designed to protect the public from harm, or that\r\nthe electronic monitoring requirement is incompatible with prior judicial\r\ndeterminations regarding restrictions placed on sex offenders. Cf. Smith, 538 U.S.\r\nat 93 (\"Nothing on the face of the statute suggests that the legislature sought to\r\ncreate anything other than a civil . . . scheme designed to protect the public from\r\nharm.\"); Bredesen, 507 F.3d at 1000 (citing the legislature's determination to\r\nutilize the technology to monitor violent sex offenders and narrow ongoing\r\ninvestigations to those sex offenders that could be linked to the crime evinced the\r\nlegislature's intent to create a civil scheme designed to protect the public); Under\r\n\nSeal, 709 F.3d at 264 (concluding that the statute's language, legislative history,\r\nand place of codification all indicated Congressional intent to create a non-punitive\r\nregulatory framework to \"keep track of sex offenders\").\r\n\r\n      B.     Application of the Mendoza-Martinez factors\r\n\r\n       Application of the Mendoza-Martinez factors demonstrates that in addition\r\nto the fact that the General Assembly intended section 23-3-540 as a civil scheme\r\nfor the protection of the public, the statute is also not so punitive in effect as to\r\nnegate the intention to deem it civil. See, e.g., Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346,\r\n361 (1997) (\"[W]e will reject the legislature's manifest intent only where a party\r\nchallenging the statute provides the 'clearest proof' that the 'statutory scheme is so\r\npunitive in purpose or effect as to negate [the State's] intention' to deem it 'civil.'\")\r\n(citation omitted).\r\n\r\n      Electronic monitoring is not similar to those sanctions historically regarded\r\nas punishment. As the Supreme Court observed in Smith, historical punishments\r\ninvolved more than the collection of information, or the protection of the public,\r\nand held the individual \"up before his fellow citizens for face-to-face shaming or\r\nexpelled him from the community.\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 98.\r\n\r\n       Appellant failed to provide the Court with any evidence that the electronic\r\nmonitoring device is immediately recognizable to the public, or would cause him\r\nto be identified as a sex offender to the exclusion of other reasonable and\r\nlegitimate uses for electronic devices. Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that\r\nthe lifetime registration requirement for sex offenders is non-punitive. Id. at 105–\r\n06. Electronic monitoring does not provide the same broad public dissemination of\r\na sex offender's status. Thus, it does not logically follow that this Court can deem\r\nthis prophylactic and non-invasive mechanism punitive. Cf. Bredesen, 507 F.3d at\r\n1005 (\"However, even assuming the public would recognize the device as a\r\ncriminal monitor, there is no evidence to suggest an observer would understand the\r\nwearer to be a sex offender.\").\r\n\r\n      Appellant may face adverse consequences from his inclusion in the sex\r\noffender registry or because someone may infer from an electronic monitoring\r\ndevice that he is a sex offender. However, in contrast to historical shaming\r\npunishments, any resulting stigma is not a basic component of the regulatory\r\nscheme. Smith, 538 U.S. at 99. Any unintended humiliation is a collateral\r\nconsequence of a valid regulation. Id.\r\n\n      Section 23-3-540 does not impose an affirmative disability or restraint.\r\nAppellant is not subject to any physical restraint, nor does wearing an electronic\r\nmonitor \"resemble imprisonment,\" the archetypal affirmative disability. See\r\nBredesen, 507 F.3d at 1010; see also Smith, 538 U.S. at 100. Moreover, requiring\r\nAppellant to submit to non-invasive electronic monitoring is less restrictive than\r\noccupational debarment, which is non-punitive. Smith, 538 U.S. at 100 (citing\r\nHudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 99–105 (1997) (upholding sanctions\r\nforbidding further participation in the banking industry)).\r\n\r\n      There is no evidence to demonstrate that section 23-3-540 increases the\r\nlength of incarceration for sex offenders, prevents them from changing jobs or\r\nresidences, or traveling to the extent otherwise permitted by their status as a sex\r\noffender. Bredesen, 507 F.3d at 1005. Therefore, section 23-3-540's electronic\r\nmonitoring requirement does not impose an affirmative disability or restraint.\r\n\r\n       The commonly accepted traditional aims of punishment are retribution and\r\ndeterrence. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 168. Section 23-3-540 does not\r\npromote the traditional aims of punishment to the exclusion of the provision's civil\r\ngoals. Though deterrence may serve criminal goals, the principle may also support\r\ncivil goals. Hatton v. Bonner, 356 F.3d 955, 965 (9th Cir. 2004). Section 23-3-\r\n540's electronic monitoring requirements may deter sex offenders from re-\r\noffending and thus support the civil purposes of protecting communities and aiding\r\nlaw enforcement in conducting investigations. Therefore, it is possible for\r\ndeterrence to serve both criminal and civil goals. Moreover, as the Supreme\r\nCourt noted in Smith, the mere presence of a deterrent purpose does not render a\r\nsanction \"criminal.\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 102 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n        Section 23-3-540's electronic monitoring scheme bears a clear and rational\r\nconnection to a non-punitive purpose. The General Assembly expressly stated that\r\nthe overall purpose of the registration and monitoring scheme is to \"promote the\r\nstate's fundamental right to provide for the public health, welfare, and safety of its\r\ncitizens,\" and to \"protect communities, conduct investigations, and apprehend\r\noffenders.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-400. Statistical evidence demonstrates that sex\r\noffenders pose a high risk of re-offending. Id. Thus, it is rational to conclude the\r\ncontinuous monitoring of these offenders supports the General Assembly's valid\r\npurpose of aiding law enforcement in the protection of the community. See Smith,\r\n538 U.S. at 102 (\"The question is whether the regulatory means chosen are\r\nreasonable in light of the non-punitive objective.\"). Perhaps the General Assembly\r\n\ncould have created a scheme more narrow in scope and still accomplished its non-\r\npunitive purpose. Perhaps it could not have. In any event, however, a statute is\r\nnot deemed punitive due to the absence of a \"close or perfect\" fit with its non-\r\npunitive purpose. Id. at 103.\r\n\r\n       The purpose of the registration and electronic monitoring scheme in the\r\ninstant case is clear—to provide for the safety and welfare of the State's citizens,\r\nand eliminate information deficits which hinder law enforcement in their\r\napprehension of those offenders. See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-400. These goals are\r\na legitimate exercise of the State's police power, and Appellant fails to demonstrate\r\nthat these objectives are mere pretext.\r\n\r\n      Finally, there is no basis to conclude that section 23-3-540's electronic\r\nmonitoring requirement is excessive in relation to its legitimate non-punitive\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n       In McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24 (2003), the Supreme Court recognized that\r\nsex offenders pose a serious and increasing threat. When convicted sex offenders\r\nreenter society \"they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be\r\nrearrested for a new rape or sexual assault.\" Id. at 33 (citation omitted). Moreover,\r\nsexual assaults disproportionately affect juveniles. Id. Nearly forty percent of\r\nimprisoned violent sex offenders stated that their victims were twelve years or\r\nyounger. Id.\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, a sex offender subject to section 23-3-540 is not required to\r\ncomply with the provision's requirements any longer than they are required to\r\nregister as a sex offender. Additionally, in light of our decision in State v. Dykes,\r\nOp. No. 27124 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 22, 2013) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 23 at\r\n21), Appellant is entitled to judicial review of his continued compliance with\r\nsection 23-3-540's electronic monitoring requirements. In Dykes, this Court found\r\nsection 23-3-540(H) unconstitutional to the extent that the provision imposed\r\nlifetime electronic monitoring with no opportunity for judicial review. Id. at 22.\r\nMoreover, the Court held that the appellant, and other similarly situated sex\r\noffenders, must comply with the monitoring requirement mandated by section 23-\r\n3-540(C), but are entitled to \"avail themselves of the section 23-3-540(H) judicial\r\nreview process as outlined for the balance of the offenses numerated in section 23-\r\n3-540(G).\" Id. at 29. Thus, Appellant may petition for judicial review ten years\r\nafter the commencement of electronic monitoring. This fact only compounds the\r\nreasoning supporting the view that section 23-3-540 is not excessive.\r\n\n                                  CONCLUSION \n\r\n\r\n      Application of the above factors demonstrates that section 23-3-540 is a civil\r\nremedy. Moreover, the practical effects of the remedy are non-punitive.3 In\r\nenacting section 23-3-540, the General Assembly reasonably determined that\r\nadvances in technology should be brought to bear in protecting some of society's\r\nmost vulnerable individuals from some of society's most violent criminals.4\r\n\r\n      Thus, based on the foregoing, and in light of this Court's decision in State v.\r\nDykes, supra, the family court's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Gamble (Petitioner) challenges his conviction\r\nfor heroin trafficking. We reverse.            FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n        On September 28, 2008, the Horry County Grand Jury indicted Petitioner for\r\n\"attempt to distribute heroin\" and \"trafficking in heroin,\" in violation of sections\r\n44-53-110 and -370 of the South Carolina Code, respectively.1 However, at trial,\r\nthe State elected to proceed only on the indictment charging Petitioner with\r\ntrafficking, explaining that this decision rested, at least in part, on the fact that the\r\nconfidential informant (CI) who provided critical information in the case died prior\r\nto trial.     At trial, the State moved to bar reference to the CI, arguing:\r\n\r\n              [T]he CI is immaterial to the trafficking case. The trafficking case is\r\n              basically . . . that: [Petitioner] drives up into the driveway . . . He\r\n              comes in there. They arrest him—based on the information that they\r\n              had. And the CI, as you know Your Honor, is deceased. I guess my\r\n              point is this, that: If we start to talk about the CI, then I think we're\r\n              going to also have to start to talk about the fact that he's deceased.\r\n\r\n       Defense counsel conceded that he did not anticipate mentioning the CI, but\r\nexpressed concern regarding how the State could demonstrate probable cause for\r\nthe search of Petitioner's vehicle, and his subsequent arrest. The trial court refused\r\nto bar reference to the CI in a pre-trial motion, but stated that as the trial ran its\r\ncourse, the court would not \"allow the jury to get confused\" due to the CI's\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\n       As its first witness, the State presented the police officer who arrested\r\nPetitioner. The officer testified that, while conducting an investigation into\r\npossible drug activity, he received information regarding a drug dealer called\r\n\"Fats.\" Defense counsel objected, arguing:\r\n\r\n              For this officer to take the witness stand and say that they had gained\r\n              information about a certain individual named \"Fats[,]\" that\r\n              information was gained through hearsay . . . . He got that information\r\n              from the [CI] in this case . . . . It is highly prejudicial if that person is\r\n                                                            \r\n1   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 44-53-110, -370 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\n      not going to be called as a witness—and we know that he's not—for\r\n      this witness to say that they had gained information about someone,\r\n      that's hearsay.\r\n\r\n       The State argued that the officer did not offer this information for the truth\r\nof the matter asserted, but instead to explain the officer's actions. Defense counsel\r\ncountered that the officer did offer the information for its truth: \"The truth of the\r\nmatter of why he was investigating this person, is that he had a conversation with\r\nsomeone. That's hearsay.\" The trial court held that the officer's testimony\r\nexplained why police investigated Petitioner and decided to instruct the jury \"not to\r\ntake these statements as being truthful[,] that they are only to consider them to\r\nexplain why the officer acted in the way he did.\" The trial court then issued the\r\nfollowing instruction:\r\n\r\n      The testimony that [the officer] is giving regarding what was told to\r\n      him by someone else is not being . . . given or used under the assertion\r\n      that the information was correct; or that the information was right. It\r\n      is only being offered, and can only be considered by you, to explain\r\n      why [the officer] acted in the way he did. So when he states that he\r\n      was told something by someone else, whether or not it is true or not\r\n      true is not your consideration as much as it is to determine or to\r\n      explain why [the officer] acted in the way he did. So you cannot use\r\n      it as proof of [Petitioner's] guilt to the extent that you think the truth—\r\n      or the statement is false[,] only to explain [the officer's] actions.\r\n\r\n      Following this instruction, the officer's testimony resumed:\r\n\r\n      The State: \t        Officer . . . did you all have a tactical plan you had\r\n                          developed with . . . regard to [Petitioner]?\r\n\r\n      The Officer: \t      Yes, ma'am, we did . . . . Myself, along with other\r\n                          agents were in the area . . . . Planned on . . .\r\n                          speaking with a person in regards to . . . drugs.\r\n\r\n      The State: \t        And as a result of that tactical plan, were you at\r\n                          some particular location?\r\n\r\n      The Officer: \t      Yes ma'am, we were.\r\n\r\n      The State: \t        Where were you located?\r\n\n      The Officer:        Uh—the exact address?\r\n\r\n      The State:          Yes sir.\r\n\r\n      The Officer:        72 Offshore Drive in the Murrells Inlet section of\r\n                          Horry County.\r\n      ....\r\n\r\n      The State:          And at some point, did you make contact with\r\n                          [Petitioner]?\r\n\r\n      The Officer:        Yes ma'am, that is correct.\r\n\r\n      The State:          And how did that happen?\r\n\r\n      The Officer:        We con—conducted a phone call . . . .\r\n\r\n      At this point, the State interrupted the officer, presumably to prevent him\r\nfrom running afoul of the trial court's ruling:\r\n\r\n         The State: \t     I don't want you—I don't want you to tell us what\r\n                          you did. I want you to tell me if you happened to\r\n                          come into contact with [Petitioner].\r\n\r\n      The Officer: \t      Yes ma'am, we came in . . . contact with\r\n                          [Petitioner]. He arrived at the location of 72\r\n                          Offshore Drive. At that time he was arrested on a\r\n                          separate charge. Upon . . . being placed under\r\n                          arrest he was searched . . . . Located on his person .\r\n                          . . was an amount of . . . brown powdered\r\n                          substance which subsequently field tested for . . .\r\n                          heroin . . . . Located in his vehicle, in the center\r\n                          console of the vehicle, was also . . . additional\r\n                          amount of . . . brown powdered substance that field\r\n                          tested positive for heroin.\r\n\r\n      Following this testimony, the State requested the trial court admit the seized\r\ndrugs into evidence. Defense counsel objected:\r\n\n              The foundation has not been laid . . . . We don't know about—He's\r\n              going to testify that after an arrest on a separate charge, a search . . . I\r\n              don't know if there is a basis for that arrest. I don't know what the\r\n              charge was. I don't know if there was a consent to search. I know\r\n              there wasn't a consent to search. And I don't believe that under the\r\n              Constitution as provided by the 4th Amendment2. . . the law of search\r\n              and seizure . . . they have the right to enter this into evidence at this\r\n              time.\r\n\r\n       The trial court overruled defense counsel's objection, and admitted the drugs\r\ninto evidence.\r\n\r\n       The jury found Petitioner guilty of \"trafficking in heroin,\" and defense\r\ncounsel moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and requested a new\r\ntrial. Defense counsel argued:\r\n\r\n              There is a total lack of evidence in this case for the basis of the arrest.\r\n              There's no evidence in the record that the arrest was lawful or\r\n              unlawful . . . . There is no evidence in the record—or even what\r\n              [Petitioner] was being arrested for; just that he was arrested, and that a\r\n              search subsequent to that arrest brought about these drugs. There is\r\n              no indicia of probable cause; no indication of reasonable suspicion for\r\n              the arrest. If you cannot find that there is probable cause for the\r\n              arrest—then we believe that it should be found that it did not exist.\r\n              And therefore, judgment should not be granted against my client.\r\n\r\n       The trial court denied the motion, and sentenced Petitioner to twenty-five\r\nyears' imprisonment. The court of appeals affirmed Petitioner's conviction in an\r\nunpublished opinion. State v. Gamble, Op. No. 2011-UP-095 (S.C. Ct. App. Mar.\r\n10, 2011). This Court granted Petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari.\r\n\r\n                                                               ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n    I.\t       Whether the trial court erred in admitting narcotics evidence over \n\r\n              Petitioner's objection that the State failed to provide the proper \n\r\n              foundation. \n\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n\r\n2   U.S. Const. amend.

We agree, as the State failed to demonstrate that the drugs were seized\r\nas part of a legally permissible search and seizure.3\r\n\r\n       The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizure, and\r\nrequires that evidence seized in violation of the Amendment be excluded from\r\ntrial. State v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 69, 572 S.E.2d 456, 459\r\n(2002) (citing Mapp v.

These exceptions include the following: (1) search incident to a\r\nlawful arrest; (2) hot pursuit; (3) stop and frisk; (4) automobile; (5) plain view; (6)\r\nconsent; and (7) abandonment. Id. The prosecution bears the burden of\r\nestablishing probable cause as well as the existence of circumstances constituting\r\nan exception to the general prohibition against warrantless searches and seizures.\r\n                                                            \r\n3 The State asserts that Petitioner's argument is unpreserved. We disagree. While\r\ndefense counsel could have articulated his objection more clearly, his objection\r\nadequately preserved the issue for this Court's review. See State v. Brannon, 388\r\nS.C. 498, 502, 697 S.E.2d 593, 595 (2010) (\"Error preservation rules do not require\r\na party to use the exact name of a legal doctrine in order to preserve an issue for\r\nappellate review.\").\r\n \r\n\nState v. Moore, 377 S.C. 299, 309, 659 S.E.2d 256, 261 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\n\"Probable cause is defined as a good faith belief that a person is guilty of a crime\r\nwhen this belief rests upon such grounds as would induce an ordinarily prudent and\r\ncautious person, under the circumstances, to believe likewise.\" Wortman v. City of\r\nSpartanburg, 310 S.C. 1, 4, 425 S.E.2d 18, 20 (1992).\r\n\r\n       The Record in the instant case is devoid of any evidence that police had\r\nprobable cause to seize the drug evidence presented at trial. Although the arresting\r\nofficer testified that the drugs were seized pursuant to a search incident to lawful\r\narrest, it is not clear that the police had probable cause for the arrest. Specifically,\r\nwe can only glean from the officer's testimony that he was present at a location\r\nwhere Petitioner later arrived, and upon Petitioner's arrival, he and another officer\r\nsearched Petitioner and seized drugs.\r\n\r\n       Compare the facts of the instant case with those of State v. Freiburger, 366\r\nS.C. 125, 620 S.E.2d 737 (2005). In that case, a police officer stopped the\r\ndefendant for hitchhiking. Id. at 130, 620 S.E.2d at 739. The police officer\r\nquestioned the defendant and conducted a pat-down search during which he\r\ndiscovered a .32 caliber revolver which later connected the defendant to a murder.\r\nId. The defendant moved to suppress the weapon. Id. at 131, 620 S.E.2d at 740.\r\nThe defendant argued that the search exceeded the permissible scope of a Terry4\r\nsearch, and that because he was not under arrest at the time of the search, the\r\nsearch was illegal and the gun should have been suppressed at trial. Id. at 131,\r\n133, 620 S.E.2d at 740–41. However, at trial, the police officer testified in camera\r\nthat he stopped the defendant because of recent accidents that had occurred\r\ninvolving people walking or hitchhiking on the same road, and that \"we did a\r\nsafety search before we put somebody in the car\" to \"check them to see if they\r\nhave any weapons.\" Id. at 133, 620 S.E.2d at 741. This Court held that the seizure\r\ntook place as part of a search incident to a lawful arrest. Id. The Court's decision\r\nrested primarily on one of the historical rationales for a search incident to a lawful\r\narrest: the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody. Id. at 132–\r\n33, 620 S.E.2d at 740–41 (noting that a search incident to arrest is also supported\r\nby the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial). In rejecting the defendant's\r\nclaim, the Court explained:\r\n\r\n              As noted above, one of the rationales for the exception to the warrant\r\n              requirement in the case of a search incident to arrest is the need to\r\n              disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody. Here, [the police\r\n                                                            \r\n4   Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16 (1968).\r\n\n              officer's] testimony that [the defendant] was going to be arrested for\r\n              hitchhiking and/or transported to the jail provides a sufficient basis\r\n              upon which to conduct a limited pat-down search. It would simply be\r\n              unreasonable to expect a police officer, out on a deserted road at\r\n              11:00 p.m., to transport a suspect to the jail without first conducting a\r\n              pat down search for weapons . . . . Moreover, the fact that [the\r\n              defendant] was not ultimately arrested for hitchhiking is not\r\n              dispositive. As recently stated by the United States Supreme Court,\r\n              an officer's \"subjective reason for making the arrest need not be the\r\n              criminal offense as to which the known facts provide probable cause .\r\n              . . . '[T]he fact that the officer does not have the state of mind which is\r\n              hypothecated by the reasons which provide the legal justification for\r\n              the officer's action does not invalidate the action taken as long as the\r\n              circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action.'\"\r\n\r\nId. at 133, 620 S.E.2d at 741 (finding police conducted a legitimate search incident\r\nto arrest and did not violate the Fourth Amendment) (citing Devenpeck v. Alford,\r\n543 U.S. 146, 153 (2004)).\r\n\r\n       The Record in this case does not demonstrate that probable cause supported\r\nPetitioner's arrest. The officer's testimony describes Petitioner's arrival at a certain\r\nlocation, and Petitioner's subsequent arrest, but does not explain why these events\r\ntriggered the search. Simply put, it is unknown what it was about Petitioner's\r\narrival at the location that supported a good faith belief that Petitioner was guilty of\r\na crime.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, the circumstances surrounding the search incident to arrest in\r\nthis case do not contain any of the justifications discussed in Freiburger. For\r\nexample, the officer's testimony did not allude to any need to disarm Petitioner for\r\nthe officer's safety during transport, and any need to preserve evidence only arose\r\nafter what appears to be a constitutionally infirm search and seizure. Thus, the trial\r\ncourt erred in admitting the drug evidence over Petitioner's objection that the\r\nevidence had been seized in contravention of the Fourth Amendment.5\r\n                                                            \r\n5Our judicial process is best served when defendants raise Fourth Amendment\r\nevidentiary objections through a pre-trial motion to suppress. The rules of\r\nevidence are not strictly applied at hearings on a motion to suppress. The\r\natmosphere of these proceedings can facilitate broader discussion before the trial\r\ncourt regarding the circumstances surrounding the evidence's seizure, and promote\r\nefficiency by resolving evidentiary disputes prior to a trial's commencement.\r\n\n       Contrary to the dissent's view, the trial colloquies described supra, and\r\ncertainly contained in the Record, demonstrate that nothing need be inferred\r\nregarding the State's inability to establish probable cause in this case. The dissent\r\ncites no authority for the proposition that a defendant's failure to file a motion to\r\nsuppress somehow forecloses his right to challenge the evidence at trial. See, e.g.,\r\nState v. Goodstein, 278 S.C. 125, 128, 292 S.E.2d 791, 793 (1982) (\"[W]e have no\r\nrule in this State requiring that a pretrial motion be made to suppress allegedly\r\nillegally obtained evidence.\"). The dissent confuses a defendant's \"right\"6 or\r\n\"entitlement\"7 to certain evidentiary hearings with a compulsory rule mandating\r\nthat the defendant request the evidentiary hearing or cede all other objections. This\r\nis not an accurate statement of the law. Furthermore, the dissent ignores the trial\r\ncourt's hearsay ruling, and to a larger extent the Record in this case, by somehow\r\nplacing responsibility for the State's failure to establish probable cause on the\r\ndefendant. Moreover, the dissent proposes a rule that essentially eviscerates the\r\nFourth Amendment's probable cause standard. Under the dissent's view, if a police\r\nofficer performs a search and seizure, and then testifies to finding drugs as a result\r\nof that search, there is no need for a determination as to whether probable cause\r\nsupported the search.\r\n\r\n      The security and protection of persons and property provided by the Fourth\r\nAmendment are fundamental values. Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165,\r\n175 (1969). The dissent characterizes the protection of these sacrosanct rights as\r\nsome type of reward for a defendant. This view of the Fourth Amendment is\r\nerroneous. Thus, we strongly disagree with the dissent's observation that proper\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nHowever, had Petitioner filed an unsuccessful motion to suppress, this would not\r\nhave relieved him of the burden to make a contemporaneous objection if the\r\nevidence was later admitted at trial, and likewise, his failure to utilize the motion to\r\nsuppress does not foreclose his right to challenge the evidence at trial.\r\n6 State v. Blassingame, 271 S.C. 44, 47–48, 244 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1978) (finding\r\nthe trial court erred in denying the defendant's request for a hearing outside the\r\npresence of the jury regarding the admission of evidence seized from the\r\ndefendant's home).\r\n7 State v. Patton, 322 S.C. 408, 411, 472 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1996) (\"To be entitled to\r\na suppression hearing under [Blassingame] a defendant must, by way of oral or\r\nwritten motion to the trial court, articulate specific factual and legal grounds to\r\nsupport his contention that evidence was obtained by conduct violative of his\r\nconstitutional rights.\")\r\n\nadherence to the guarantees provided by the Fourth Amendment is somehow\r\naccurately viewed as rewarding a criminal.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       Our analysis of the trial court's evidentiary error is dispositive of Petitioner's\r\ncase; thus, we need not reach his remaining issue. See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\nof Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (finding an\r\nappellate court need not address remaining issues on appeal when a decision in a\r\nprior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, the court of appeals' decision is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent. The majority holds that the\r\nrecord in this case is devoid of any evidence that the police had probable cause to\r\nseize the drug evidence presented at trial. In my view, petitioner prevented the\r\nintroduction of evidence on the issue of probable cause and should not be\r\npermitted to benefit from his deliberate avoidance of a suppression hearing on the\r\nissue. Thus, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\nThe record in this case shows that some pretrial discussions took place regarding\r\nthe effect the confidential informant's death had on the case, although the substance\r\nof those discussions does not appear in the record. It can, nonetheless, be inferred\r\nfrom the record that petitioner was contesting the introduction of the drug evidence\r\nas lacking a foundation because the State would be unable to establish probable\r\ncause for the initial arrest due to the unavailability of the confidential informant.\r\nUpon questioning, petitioner specifically declined to make a suppression motion\r\nbefore trial. During trial, he objected to the introduction of the drug evidence. At\r\nthe conclusion of the State's case, petitioner made a directed verdict motion,\r\narguing that the State had failed to present evidence of probable cause for\r\npetitioner's arrest. Although the State offered to present its evidence for probable\r\ncause in a hearing outside the presence of the jury, petitioner made no request for\r\nsuch a hearing, arguing only that the State had failed to establish probable cause.\r\nAt oral argument before this Court, petitioner argued that the judge's failure to\r\nconduct the hearing in response to the State's offer was error.\r\n\r\nI disagree. The defendant's failure to request a hearing outside the presence of the\r\njury to determine whether probable cause existed for the arrest constitutes a\r\nconcession that the evidence is competent. See State v. Rankin, 3 S.C. 438, 448\r\n(1872) (defendant's failure to object to evidence is a concession of its competency);\r\nState v. Blassingame, 271 S.C. 44, 47-48, 244 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1978) (\"Whenever\r\nevidence is introduced that was allegedly obtained by conduct violative of the\r\ndefendant's constitutional rights, the defendant is entitled to have the trial judge\r\nconduct an evidentiary hearing out of the presence of the jury at this threshold\r\npoint to establish the circumstances under which it was seized.\"); State v. Patton,\r\n322 S.C. 408, 411, 472 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1996) (to be entitled to such a hearing, the\r\ndefendant must state specific grounds on which he objects to admission of\r\n\nevidence). Petitioner repeatedly declined to avail himself of the opportunity to test\r\nthe State's evidence of probable cause in a suppression hearing.8\r\n\r\nThus, to the extent the record fails to establish probable cause for petitioner's\r\narrest, it is of petitioner's doing. State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 316 S.E.2d 395\r\n(1985)(defendant cannot complain of an error induced by his own conduct); State\r\nv. Winestock, 271 S.C. 473, 474, 248 S.E.2d 307, 307-308 (1978) (burden is on\r\nappellant to present sufficient record from which appellate court can determine\r\nwhether trial court committed error). The majority shifts the burden to the State to\r\nplace evidence of probable cause in the record contrary to well-established law that\r\nthe defendant must challenge admissibility of evidence offered by the State.\r\nLikewise, the majority's comparison of the evidence in this record with the\r\nevidence in a case in which a suppression hearing was conducted is entirely\r\ninappropriate. See State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 133, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741\r\n(2005) (discussing officer's testimony at in camera hearing). The majority rewards\r\npetitioner's default, whether intentional or unintentional, with a reversal of his\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in this case the arresting officer testified without objection that\r\npetitioner was arrested and that in searches incident thereto a brown powdered\r\nsubstance that field tested positive for heroin was discovered on petitioner's person\r\nand in his car. Because the drugs themselves were cumulative once the officer's\r\ntestimony had been admitted without objection, their admission was harmless even\r\nif improper. State v.

Sherman and Lawrence Solomon, both of \n\r\n   Solomon, Sherman & Gabay, of Philadelphia, \n\r\n   Pennsylvania, for Appellee. \n\r\n\r\n   Robert T. Vance, Jr., of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for\r\n   Appellant.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: We certified the following question from the United\r\nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit:\r\n\r\n         Does South Carolina recognize the \"putative spouse\" or \"putative\r\n         marriage\" doctrine (hereinafter, putative spouse doctrine)?\r\n\r\nWe answer the certified question, \"no.\"   I.\r\n       This action involves competing claims to the retirement benefits of the late\r\nThomas Sullivan (Thomas), former National Football League (NFL) running back\r\nfor the Philadelphia Eagles.\r\n\r\n      On March 15, 1979, Thomas married Lavona Hill (Hill) in Maryland.\r\nThomas and Hill separated in 1983, but never divorced. On March 15, 1986,\r\nThomas purported to marry Barbara Sullivan (Barbara) in South Carolina. The\r\nrecord indicates Thomas and Barbara obtained a marriage license, and that Barbara\r\nwas unaware of Thomas' prior marriage to Hill. In 1991, Thomas submitted\r\npension forms to the NFL indicating Barbara was his current spouse.\r\n\r\n      Thomas died on October 10, 2002. Thereafter, Barbara filed a claim with\r\nthe Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle NFL Player Retirement Plan (the Plan), which provides\r\nbenefits to a player's \"surviving [s]pouse\" and defines that term as \"a [p]layer's\r\nlawful spouse, as recognized under applicable state law.\" In November 2002, the\r\nPlan began paying Barbara benefits in the amount of $2,700 per month.\r\n\r\n       Four years later, Hill contacted the Plan to request benefits. Following an\r\ninvestigation, the Plan suspended payments to Barbara pending a court order\r\nidentifying Thomas's surviving spouse. After Hill failed to obtain that order, the\r\nPlan resumed payments to Barbara.\r\n\r\n       In August 2009, Hill filed this action against the Plan in Pennsylvania state\r\ncourt, claiming entitlement to Thomas's retirement benefits. The Plan promptly\r\nremoved the case to federal district court and filed an interpleader counterclaim,\r\njoining Barbara as a party to the action.\r\n\r\n      After a bench trial, the federal district court found Barbara and Thomas's\r\npurported marriage void under South Carolina's bigamy statute because Thomas\r\nand Hill never divorced. Hill v. Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle NFL Player Ret. Plan, No.\r\n\n09-4051, 2010 WL 4452523 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 4, 2010). The district court further\r\nfound South Carolina had not adopted the putative spouse doctrine, and thus, Hill\r\nwas entitled to receive Thomas's retirement benefits as his surviving spouse.\r\n\r\n       On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,\r\nBarbara argues she should receive the same rights conferred upon a legal spouse\r\nunder the putative spouse doctrine because she lived with Thomas with the good\r\nfaith belief they were married. Barbara maintains she was unaware of Thomas's\r\nprior marriage to Hill, and that Thomas's benefits should therefore be apportioned\r\nbetween her and Hill in the interests of justice. Conversely, Hill contends she is\r\nentitled to all of Thomas's retirement benefits because she and Thomas never\r\ndivorced, and South Carolina does not recognize the putative spouse doctrine.\r\n\r\n                                        II.\r\n      The putative spouse doctrine is codified in section 209 of the Uniform\r\nMarriage and Divorce Act as follows:\r\n\r\n            Any person who has cohabited with another to whom he\r\n            is not legally married in the good faith belief that he was\r\n            married to that person is a putative spouse until\r\n            knowledge of the fact that he is not legally married\r\n            terminates his status and prevents acquisition of further\r\n            rights. A putative spouse acquires the rights conferred\r\n            upon a legal spouse, including the right to maintenance\r\n            following termination of his status, whether or not the\r\n            marriage is prohibited or declared invalid. If there is a\r\n            legal spouse or other putative spouses, rights acquired by\r\n            a putative spouse do not supersede the rights of the legal\r\n            spouse or those acquired by other putative spouses, but\r\n            the court shall apportion property, maintenance, and\r\n            support rights among the claimants as appropriate in the\r\n            circumstances and in the interests of justice.\r\n\r\n(internal citations omitted); see also Christopher L. Blakesley, The Putative\r\nMarriage Doctrine, 60 TUL. L. REV. 1, 6 (1985) (discussing the putative spouse\r\ndoctrine). South Carolina has not adopted the putative spouse doctrine. See Lovett\r\nv. Lovett, 329 S.C. 426, 432, 494 S.E.2d 823, 826 (Ct. App. 1997) (mentioning the\r\nputative spouse doctrine in dicta, but declining to address the applicability of the\r\ndoctrine in South Carolina because the issue was not preserved for appellate\r\nreview).\r\n\n       We decline to adopt the putative spouse doctrine, as it is contrary to South\r\nCarolina's statutory law and marital jurisprudence. See S.C. Code Ann. § 20-1-80\r\n(Supp. 2012) (\"All marriages contracted while either of the parties has a former\r\nwife or husband living shall be void.\"); Lukich v. Lukich, 368 S.C. 47, 56, 627\r\nS.E.2d 754, 758 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"Even if Wife was acting under a good faith\r\nbelief, South Carolina will not recognize her bigamous second marriage because to\r\ndo so would violate public policy.\"); Day v. Day, 216 S.C. 334, 338, 58 S.E.2d 83,\r\n85 (1950) (\"A mere marriage ceremony between a man and a woman, where one of\r\nthem has a living wife or husband, is not a marriage at all. Such a marriage is\r\nabsolutely void, and not merely voidable.\"); Howell v. Littlefield, 211 S.C. 462,\r\n466, 46 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1947) (\"[Husband's] existing marriage in North Carolina\r\nincapacitated him . . . to contract another marriage . . . .\").\r\n\r\n                                       III.\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we decline to adopt the putative spouse doctrine\r\nin South Carolina.\r\n\r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
