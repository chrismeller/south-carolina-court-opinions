Lewis Cromer, of Cromer &amp; Mabry, of Columbia, for Respondents Carl B. \r\n  Tucker and Eleanor Tucker.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  The Court of Appeals dismissed \r\n  Pee Dee Electric Cooperativeâ€™s (â€œPee Deeâ€) appeal as interlocutory.  See \r\n  Tucker v. Honda of South Carolina Mfg., Inc., S.C. Ct. App. Order dated \r\n  January 22, 2002.  We granted a writ of certiorari and affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCarl and Eleanor Tucker (the â€œTuckersâ€) deposed a former trustee of Pee Dee \r\n  for a lawsuit against Pee Dee.  Pee Dee objected to several questions based \r\n  on attorney client privilege.  The parties adjourned the deposition pursuant \r\n  to Rule 30(d), SCRCP.   \r\nAt a subsequent hearing, the trial court noted Pee Dee raised legitimate privilege \r\n  concerns regarding communications between Pee Deeâ€™s board of trustees and legal \r\n  counsel.  To determine the exact nature of the representation and the applicability \r\n  of the privilege, the court ordered the deposition of the former trustee under \r\n  the following conditions:  1) the court would not limit the scope of questions; \r\n  2) Pee Dee could object on the record to any question; 3) the former trustee \r\n  would answer all questions; 4) the court reporter would seal the deposition \r\n  record and submit it to the trial court; and 5) the trial court would rule upon \r\n  any objections and exclude any privileged information from the trial record.  \r\n  The trial judge, to protect the confidentiality of the proceeding, limited the \r\n  attendance of the deposition to the deponent, the deponentâ€™s counsel, the counsels \r\n  of record, and the court reporter.  \r\nPee Dee appealed.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal as interlocutory.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by dismissing Pee Deeâ€™s \r\n  appeal as interlocutory? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPee Dee asserts the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing \r\n  its appeal because the trial courtâ€™s order determined a substantial matter involving \r\n  the merits of the case.  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAny intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case involving the meritsâ€ \r\n  may be appealed.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330  (1976).  The phrase â€œinvolving \r\n  the meritsâ€ means the order â€œmust finally determine some substantial matter \r\n  forming the whole or a part of some cause of action or defense.â€  Mid-State \r\n  Distributors, Inc. v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 426 S.E.2d \r\n  777 (1993).  \r\nPee Dee advances three arguments for its contention that the order involved \r\n  the merits of the case.  First, Pee Dee argues any order affecting attorney \r\n  client privilege should be found to automatically touch upon the merits of the \r\n  case.  Second, Pee Dee asserts the unique facts of the case make it necessary \r\n  for an appellate court to review the order.  Third, Pee Dee believes the order \r\n  impermissibly requires counsel to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\nIn addressing the Tuckersâ€™ first contention, we note an order compelling discovery \r\n  does not ordinarily involve the merits of the case and may not be appealed.  \r\n  See Ex parte Whetstone, 289 S.C. 580, 347 S.E.2d 881 (1986).  \r\n  Since a contempt order is final in nature, an order compelling discovery may \r\n  be appealed only after the trial court holds a party in contempt.  See \r\n  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 513 S.E.2d 358 (1999).  Thus, a party \r\n  may comply with the order and waive any right to challenge it on appeal or refuse \r\n  to comply with the order, be cited for contempt, and appeal.  See Ex \r\n  parte Whetstone, supra.\r\nPee Dee has not refused to comply with the order but appeals the mere issuance \r\n  of the order.  Pee Deeâ€™s appeal is interlocutory.\r\nSecond, Pee Dee expresses concern because the individual being deposed is a \r\n  former trustee over whom Pee Dee has no formal control and who may disclose \r\n  confidential communications without fear of reprisal.\r\nThe attorney client privilege belongs to the client and may only be waived \r\n  by him.  State v. Doster, 276 S.C. 647, 650-51, 284 S.E.2d 218, 219 (1981).  \r\n  The privilege belongs to the corporation, not a trustee of the corporation.  \r\n  See Commodity Futures Trading Commâ€™n v. Weintraub, 471 U.S. 343, \r\n  105 S. Ct. 1986, 85 L. Ed. 2d 372 (1985).  The current corporationâ€™s management \r\n  must decide whether to assert the privilege or relinquish it.  See id.  \r\n  If Pee Dee asserts the privilege, the former trustee may not ignore such assertions.  \r\n  More importantly, Pee Deeâ€™s concern is not a particularly unique situation leading \r\n  this Court to abandon its policy of denying interlocutory appeals.\r\nFinally, Pee Dee argues the trial courtâ€™s order may be appealed because it \r\n  requires counsel to violate the Rule 1.2 (a), (d) and Rule 1.4 of the Rules \r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407 SCACR.   We disagree.\r\nPee Dee believes barring the attendance of a company \r\n  representative from and prohibiting counsel from divulging the contents of the \r\n  deposition to anyone not attending the deposition requires the attorney to violate \r\n  ethical duties to keep the client informed.  The rules cited by Pee Dee, however, \r\n  are intended to aid the attorney and client in understanding the scope of representation \r\n  in terms of the objectives each party desires from the relationship.  The requirement \r\n  to keep a client informed does not supersede the lawyerâ€™s responsibility to \r\n  comply with a specific court order to maintain the confidentiality of a deposition \r\n  pending court review.  The trial courtâ€™s order does not impermissibly bar the \r\n  lawyer from consulting with his client.\r\nAlthough Pee Deeâ€™s appeal is interlocutory in nature, we believe it is to the \r\n  benefit of the Bench and the Bar that we clarify the procedure for review of \r\n  claims of attorney client privilege.  In such situations a trial judge shall \r\n  be guided by the procedure established in State v. Doster, supra.  \r\n\r\nIn Doster, this Court found a trial court should not require the disclosure \r\n  of attorney client communications to other parties without first determining \r\n  whether the communications are privileged by inquiring into all the facts and \r\n  circumstances of the communication.  Id.  Further, if necessary to determine \r\n  the application of the privilege, the trial judge may consider, in camera, \r\n  the questions sought to be asked and the responses which are contended to be \r\n  subject to the privilege.\r\nIn the event such in camera hearing is necessary, \r\n  the trial judge shall limit attendance as required to ensure protection of the \r\n  communication in the event it is found to be entitled to the protection of the \r\n  privilege. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice Edward B.

Allen Bullard, Jr., Assistant \r\n  Attorney General David A. Spencer, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, South Carolina Office of \r\n  Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We granted certiorari to determine \r\n  whether the post-conviction relief (PCR) court erred by finding the plea court \r\n  did not have subject matter jurisdiction to accept respondentâ€™s guilty plea \r\n  to second degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor.  We affirm.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the plea court have subject matter jurisdiction to accept \r\n  respondentâ€™s guilty plea to second degree CSC with a minor?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRespondent pled guilty to second degree CSC with a minor and was sentenced \r\n  to imprisonment for six years.  Respondent did not appeal.  After a hearing \r\n  on respondentâ€™s PCR application, the court found the plea court did not have \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to accept respondentâ€™s plea. [1] \r\nThe indictment alleges respondent â€œdid in Beaufort County on or about \r\n  November 11, 1998, wilfully and unlawfully engage in criminal sexual conduct \r\n  with a minor in the first degree in that [respondent] engaged in a sexual battery, \r\n  with [victim] and that the said [victim] was of the age of 11 years old.â€  The \r\n  caption of the indictment and the title in the body of the indictment state, \r\n  â€œCriminal sexual conduct with minor first degree (16-3-655).â€\r\nA circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction to convict a defendant of an \r\n  offense if there is an indictment that sufficiently states the offense, the \r\n  defendant waives presentment, or the offense is a lesser-included offense of \r\n  the crime charged in the indictment.  Brown v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 540 \r\n  S.E.2d 846 (2001).\r\n While the indictment indicated respondent was charged with first \r\n  degree CSC with a minor, the indictment was insufficient to charge him with \r\n  that crime because the victim was eleven years old, not â€œless than eleven yearsâ€ \r\n  old.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(1) (2003) (first degree CSC with \r\n  a minor requires sexual battery of victim who is less than eleven years old).  \r\n  Even if the indictment had sufficiently stated the crime of first degree CSC \r\n  with a minor, the court would not have had jurisdiction to accept a plea to \r\n  second degree CSC with a minor as if it were a lesser offense of first degree \r\n  CSC with a minor. [2]   See State v. McFadden, \r\n  342 S.C. 629, 539 S.E.2d 387 (2000) (test for determining when offense is lesser-included \r\n  of another is whether greater of two offenses includes all elements of lesser \r\n  offense).  Second degree CSC with a minor is not a lesser-included offense of \r\n  the first degree charge because it includes an age requirement element that \r\n  is different from the age requirement element in the crime of first degree CSC \r\n  with a minor. [3]   The first \r\n  degree charge requires proof the victim is â€œless than eleven years old,â€ while \r\n  the second degree charge requires proof the victim is â€œfourteen years of age \r\n  or less but . . . at least eleven years of age.â€  Â§Â§ 16-3-655(1) and (2).\r\nThe question then becomes whether the indictment otherwise sufficiently \r\n  states the offense of second degree CSC with a minor.  The indictment appears \r\n  to sufficiently allege second degree CSC with a minor because it charges that \r\n  respondent engaged in a sexual battery with a victim of eleven years of age.  \r\n  However, the body of the indictment includes the language â€œcriminal sexual conduct \r\n  with a minor in the first degree.â€  (Emphasis added).  The inclusion \r\n  of the â€œfirst degreeâ€ language is not a scrivenerâ€™s error given that the title \r\n  and caption of the indictment both indicate the indictment is for first degree \r\n  CSC with a minor.  See Tate v. State, 345 S.C. 577, 549 S.E.2d \r\n  601 (2001) (if body of indictment specifically states essential elements of \r\n  crime and is otherwise free from defect, defect in caption will not cause it \r\n  to be invalid).  Here, there is a defect in the body, title, and caption of \r\n  the indictment.\r\n Further, the indictment does not sufficiently inform the court as \r\n  to what judgment to pronounce.  See Browning v. State, 320 S.C. \r\n  366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995).  As written, respondent is subject to being sentenced \r\n  to first degree CSC with a minor, a Class A felony carrying an imprisonment \r\n  term of not more than thirty years, rather than second degree CSC with a minor, \r\n  a Class C felony carrying an imprisonment term of not more than twenty years.  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-1-20(A)(1) and (3); Â§Â§ 16-1-90(A) and (C).  \r\n  Therefore, the plea court was without subject matter jurisdiction to accept \r\n  respondentâ€™s plea to second degree CSC with a minor.\r\nGiven that second degree CSC with a minor is not a lesser-included \r\n  offense of first degree CSC with a minor and that the indictment improperly \r\n  indicated respondent was charged with first degree CSC with a minor, we affirm \r\n  the finding that the plea court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to \r\n  accept respondentâ€™s guilty plea.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] At \r\n    the hearing, the State informed the PCR court that the plea court lacked subject \r\n    matter jurisdiction to accept respondentâ€™s plea.  The State now argues it \r\n    was mistaken in its presentation of the subject matter jurisdiction issue \r\n    to the PCR court.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] The \r\n    sentencing sheet indicated respondent was pleading guilty to a lesser-included \r\n    offense.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] See \r\n    State v. Munn, 292 S.C. 497, 357 S.E.2d 461 (1987) (victimâ€™s age is \r\n    element of second degree CSC with a minor); State v. Norton, 286 S.C. \r\n    95, 332 S.E.2d 531 (1985) (age is element of first degree CSC with a minor).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25659","title":"In the Matter of William O.

Richardson, Jr. and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for The Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDesa A. Ballard, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:   Respondent and \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and agrees to accept \r\n  an admonition or a public reprimand.  We accept the agreement and issue a public \r\n  reprimand.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Commercial property matter.\r\nAccording to the facts stated in the agreement, the seller \r\n  and purchasers of certain commercial property sought respondent's assistance \r\n  in transferring title of the property from seller to purchasers.  The parties \r\n  had been referred to respondent by a person associated with respondent's brother, \r\n  a certified public accountant.  Respondent agreed to discuss the matter with \r\n  the parties if terms of purchase were agreed upon.  The parties negotiated between \r\n  themselves regarding the terms of the transaction and, after reaching agreement, \r\n  contacted respondent to complete the transaction.  Respondent was retained to \r\n  represent all parties to the transaction.  Respondent acknowledges that he did \r\n  not make proper disclosure to the parties of the risks of joint representation \r\n  and did not obtain informed waivers from the parties for joint representation.\r\nOne of the reasons for the delay in agreement regarding the terms of the transaction \r\n  was that purchasers had been unable to obtain independent financing.  The parties \r\n  had agreed that seller would finance the sale, with an assumption, via wrap-around \r\n  mortgage, by the purchasers of the existing Small Business Administration (SBA) \r\n  mortgage.  \r\nRespondent maintains he had only a short period of time in which to complete \r\n  the transaction because seller was subject to a family court order which required \r\n  her to have her former spouse released from the SBA mortgage by a certain date \r\n  or face financial consequences in family court.\r\nRespondent wrote a letter to the SBA advising of the contemplated transaction \r\n  and requesting relevant information to complete the wrap-around mortgage.  Three \r\n  days later, on the final date the transaction could be completed without violating \r\n  the family court order, the parties gathered at respondent's office to complete \r\n  the transaction.  During that meeting, respondent received a telephone call \r\n  from the SBA informing him that a wrap-around mortgage would not be permitted, \r\n  and that the sale of the property, as agreed upon by the parties, would result \r\n  in the mortgage being accelerated against seller and her husband.  Respondent \r\n  advised the parties of the position taken by the SBA and proposed restructuring \r\n  the transaction as a Lease Agreement and Option to Purchase (LAOP).  Seller \r\n  agreed with the proposal but insisted that the transaction be completed that \r\n  day.  The parties returned to respondent's office that afternoon and executed \r\n  the documents necessary to finalize the transaction.  After the closing of the \r\n  transaction, respondent completed the release of seller's husband from the SBA \r\n  loan.\r\nSome of the funds paid by purchasers at the time of the closing were paid in \r\n  cash.  Respondent properly accounted for the cash as part of the transaction; \r\n  however, respondent acknowledges that he failed to file the required reporting \r\n  forms with the Internal Revenue Service.\r\nShortly after the transaction was completed, disputes arose between seller \r\n  and purchasers regarding the transaction.  The parties resolved most of the \r\n  disputes between themselves without respondent's assistance.  Respondent initially \r\n  tried to work with the parties as an intermediary to resolve a dispute that \r\n  arose when purchasers failed to make timely payments to seller.  Respondent \r\n  acknowledges that he was prohibited from representing either party when the \r\n  disputes arose, and that he should not have become involved in the parties' \r\n  disputes in any way.  Respondent also acknowledges that he had a conflict of \r\n  interest in representing both parties in connection with the disputes that arose \r\n  and that he did not obtain informed waivers from the clients before proceeding.\r\nAs a result of the disputes between the parties, purchasers refused to make \r\n  payments directly to seller and established a practice of delivering payments \r\n  to respondent's office for transmission to seller.  Respondent allowed this \r\n  practice to continue and became a de facto escrow agent for some \r\n  payments.  Most payments delivered to respondent were checks made out to seller, \r\n  but purchasers did, on occasion, deliver cash to respondent's office for payments \r\n  to seller.  Respondent did not maintain records in sufficient detail to provide \r\n  an accounting of the payments delivered by purchasers to respondent's office \r\n  for payment to seller.  When initially asked to do so, respondent was unable \r\n  to provide an accurate accounting of funds received by him on seller's behalf.  \r\n  However, respondent was later able to reconstruct an accurate accounting of \r\n  funds received and disbursed by him.\r\nThe parties later retained separate counsel and litigation proceeded between \r\n  them.  The civil action was resolved in favor of seller. \r\n  [1]   It was discovered during this litigation that one purchaser had signed \r\n  the name of the other purchaser to certain documents related to the LAOP, although \r\n  the purchaser whose name was forged was present at the time the documents were \r\n  signed, and respondent had notarized the signature. \r\n  [2]   Respondent believed at the time he notarized the document that the \r\n  signature was authentic.  However, respondent acknowledges that he failed to \r\n  exercise due care to insure that the signature was actually that of the purchaser \r\n  whose name was signed.  \r\nFollowing the transaction, respondent paid a broker's fee to the person who \r\n  brokered the transaction between seller and purchaser.  Respondent maintains \r\n  payment of the fee was verbally authorized by seller.  Seller, however, asserted \r\n  she had not approved the payment.  Respondent's file contains no documentation \r\n  authorizing the disbursement.\r\nII.                Foreclosure matter.\r\nClient retained respondent to represent him in a foreclosure \r\n  matter.  Client had previously sold a piece of real estate to a buyer and had \r\n  agreed to finance the purchase.  The buyer died intestate.  An attorney for \r\n  the buyer's estate advised client that the estate would remain current on the \r\n  debt; however, shortly thereafter, the estate changed its position.\r\nProbate records indicated the buyer was survived by four \r\n  children, three of whom were adults.  Respondent initially attempted to execute \r\n  a deed in lieu of foreclosure; however, the adult beneficiaries would not agree \r\n  to that arrangement.  Accordingly, respondent filed a formal foreclosure action.  \r\n  Respondent retained a process server who effected personal service on three \r\n  of the four beneficiaries.  Respondent was unable to locate any information \r\n  as to the whereabouts of the minor beneficiary or the identity of any guardians \r\n  for the child and was therefore unable to effect service\r\nSeven months after respondent was retained, client wrote respondent a letter \r\n  expressing frustration over the fact that the matter remained pending.  Because \r\n  respondent had not been able to effect service on the fourth beneficiary, he \r\n  advised client that he would withdraw from representation to enable client to \r\n  retain new counsel to assist with the matter in a more timely fashion.  Respondent \r\n  refunded his entire fee and returned all original papers, as well as copies \r\n  of the work he had done to date, to client.  However, respondent did not file \r\n  a motion to be relieved as counsel.\r\nAt some point within the next six months, the secretary for the Chief Judge \r\n  for Administrative Purposes telephoned respondent regarding the status of the \r\n  foreclosure action.   The secretary advised respondent that he would either \r\n  have to try the case or dismiss it.  In response to the telephone call, respondent \r\n  prepared documentation to dismiss the action without prejudice and forwarded \r\n  it to the judge's office.  He did not discuss this course of action with client, \r\n  nor did he provide client with a copy of the documentation.  Client had retained \r\n  successor counsel but respondent had not been provided with that information.  \r\n  When client learned about the dismissal without prejudice, he contacted respondent.  \r\n  Respondent advised client of the circumstances which led to his sending the \r\n  dismissal without prejudice to the presiding judge.  Respondent offered to assist \r\n  client or successor counsel with reinstating the action or otherwise bringing \r\n  the matter to a conclusion.  Respondent did not hear back from client or anyone \r\n  on his behalf.\r\nRespondent admits he should have communicated with client regarding the dismissal \r\n  of the action without prejudice, and that he should have filed a motion to be \r\n  relieved as counsel when he ceased acting on client's behalf.\r\nLaw\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall \r\n  provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2(a) (a lawyer shall abide \r\n  by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and shall \r\n  consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule \r\n  1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing \r\n  a client); Rule 1.4(a) (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about \r\n  the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); \r\n  Rule 1.4(b) (a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary \r\n  to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation); \r\n  Rule 1.5(b) (when the lawyer has not regularly represented a client, the basis \r\n  or rate of the fee shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, \r\n  before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation); Rule \r\n  1.7(a) (except in certain circumstances, a lawyer shall not represent a client \r\n  if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client \r\n  or if the representation may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities \r\n  to another client); Rule 1.15(a) (a lawyer shall hold client funds in a separate \r\n  account and complete records of such funds shall be kept by the lawyer); Rule \r\n  1.16(a) (a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has \r\n  commenced, shall withdraw from representation of a client if the representation \r\n  will result in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or if the lawyer \r\n  is discharged); Rule 2.1 (in representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise \r\n  independent professional judgment and render candid advice); Rule 2.2(a)(1) \r\n  (a lawyer may act as intermediary between clients if the lawyer consults with \r\n  each client concerning the implications of the common representation and obtains \r\n  each client's consent to the common representation); Rule 2.2(a)(2) (a lawyer \r\n  may act as intermediary between clients if the lawyer reasonably believes the \r\n  matter can be resolved on terms compatible with the clients' best interests, \r\n  that each client will be able to make adequately informed decisions in the matter \r\n  and that there is little risk of material prejudice to the interests of any \r\n  of the clients if the contemplated resolution is unsuccessful); Rule 2.2(a)(3) \r\n  (a lawyer may act as intermediary between clients if the lawyer reasonably believes \r\n  that the common representation can be undertaken impartially and without improper \r\n  effect on other responsibilities the lawyer has to any of the clients); Rule \r\n  2.2(b) (while acting as intermediary, the lawyer shall consult with each client \r\n  concerning the decisions to be made and the considerations relevant in making \r\n  them, so that each client can make adequately informed decisions); Rule 2.2(c) \r\n  (a lawyer shall withdraw as intermediary if any of the conditions stated in \r\n  Rule 2.2(a) is no longer satisfied); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct \r\n  for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) \r\n  (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial \r\n  to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent has also violated the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground \r\n  for discipline for a lawyer to violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to \r\n  bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating \r\n  an unfitness to practice law).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public \r\n  reprimand.

Richardson, Jr., and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for The Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nA. Peter Shahid, Jr. and Coming B. Gibbs, Jr., both of Charleston, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to a dismissal, the issuance of a letter of caution \r\n  or the imposition of any of the sanctions set forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE.  We \r\n  accept the agreement and find a one year suspension from the practice of law \r\n  is the appropriate sanction.  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are \r\n  as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent was employed as an Assistant Solicitor in the \r\n  Eleventh Judicial Circuit.  On May 29, 1995, respondent was on call in connection \r\n  with his duties as an Assistant Solicitor and was summoned to the offices of \r\n  the Lexington County Sheriff's Department.  \r\nUpon his arrival at the Sheriff's Department, respondent was advised that a \r\n  suspect, Robert Joseph Quattlebaum, was being held in connection with an apparent \r\n  murder, a burglary or robbery of the victim's house, and the shooting of another \r\n  victim.  Respondent was also informed that Quattlebaum's attorney, John E. Duncan, \r\n  was with Quattlebaum at the Sheriff's Department.  \r\nSometime later, respondent was advised that Quattlebaum had consented to a \r\n  polygraph examination.  Respondent was not initially in the vicinity of the \r\n  room where the polygraph examination was to take place, but was waiting in or \r\n  near a conference room in another part of the building where respondent had, \r\n  from time to time, been consulted by Sheriff's Department personnel concerning \r\n  their investigation of Quattlebaum.  \r\nHowever, respondent was later summoned by Sheriff's Department personnel to \r\n  the polygraph examiner's office, which was close to the polygraph room itself.  \r\n  Respondent discovered Sheriff's Department personnel watching a video monitor \r\n  in the polygraph examiner's office.  He surmised that he had been summoned to \r\n  the office to observe what was being shown on the video monitor.  \r\nRespondent then realized that the video monitor was playing video and audio \r\n  portions of a conversation between Quattlebaum and Duncan in the polygraph room.  \r\n  It was readily apparent to respondent that the conversation was intended by \r\n  Quattlebaum and Duncan to be a confidential, attorney-client privileged communication.  \r\n  Respondent told the Sheriff's Department personnel present to turn off the video \r\n  monitor.  \r\nRespondent then went down the hall to the office of Lieutenant Phillips, the \r\n  senior law enforcement officer in the vicinity.  Although respondent believed \r\n  the monitor was turned off, he did not verify that such action had been taken, \r\n  nor did he ask Lieutenant Phillips to ensure that the monitor had been turned \r\n  off.  Respondent had no advance knowledge that the conversation was going to \r\n  be observed or listened to by Sheriff's Department personnel and had no reason \r\n  to believe Sheriff's Department personnel had planned in advance to monitor \r\n  the conversation.\r\nRespondent did not advise Duncan that the conversation between Duncan and Quattlebaum \r\n  had been overheard by Sheriff's Department personnel.  Quattlebaum was arrested \r\n  when he emerged from the polygraph room.  \r\nWithin a day or so, respondent notified Solicitor Donald V. Meyers, of the \r\n  events which took place at the Sheriff's Department.  Respondent did not notify \r\n  Duncan or the judge of the Court of General Sessions that the conversation between \r\n  Duncan and Quattlebaum had been overheard by Sheriff's Department personnel. \r\n\r\nDuncan withdrew as counsel soon after Quattlebaum's arrest.  Joseph M. McCulloch, \r\n  Jr. and Katherine E. Evatt were appointed to represent Quattlebaum.  On May \r\n  30, 1995, respondent and Evatt discussed Quattlebaum's case, but respondent \r\n  made no mention of the conversation between Duncan and Quattlebaum being overheard \r\n  by Sheriff's Department personnel.\r\nIn March 1996, respondent heard a rumor from Edward V. Hite, the principal \r\n  investigator on Quattlebaum's case, that a videotape of the conversation between \r\n  Duncan and Quattlebaum might exist.  Respondent immediately advised Solicitor \r\n  Myers of the rumor and discussed with the Solicitor whether that information \r\n  was subject to discovery.  Respondent maintains it was determined by respondent \r\n  and the Solicitor that the information would be disclosed to opposing counsel \r\n  during the normal course of discovery and upon proper requests.  In In re \r\n  Myers, Op. No. 25647 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 5, 2003), this Court found \r\n  respondent and the Solicitor discussed whether the tape was discoverable, and \r\n  the Solicitor stated that if there was a tape, respondent should give it to \r\n  the defense.  We are not otherwise persuaded by respondent's rendition of these \r\n  facts.  Respondent took no action at that time to substantiate the rumor nor \r\n  was opposing counsel notified of the rumor until much later.\r\nOn May 28, 1996, opposing counsel served discovery motions, pursuant to Rule \r\n  5, SCRCrimP, and Brady v. Maryland \r\n  [1] , on the State.  These motions were received and handled exclusively \r\n  by respondent on behalf of the State.  The Brady motion included a request \r\n  for &quot;all evidence or information within the possession, custody or control \r\n  of the prosecution, the existence of which is known or by the exercise of due \r\n  diligence may become known to the attorney for the prosecution . . . which could \r\n  tend to show that the Defendant was not guilty . . . or tend to mediate punishment&quot; \r\n  and specifically requested &quot;all statements . . . of  . . . the defendant \r\n  concerning the case . . ., any and all . . . photographs . . . and any and all \r\n  transcripts or tapes from any wire taps.&quot;  The Rule 5 motion included a \r\n  request for &quot;all information available to the defendant under the Rules \r\n  of Criminal Procedure,&quot; specifically citing Rules (5)(a)(1)(A), (B), (C), \r\n  and (D).  Respondent understood these motions were continuing in nature and, \r\n  as such, would be applicable to any subsequent information available to respondent.  \r\n  Respondent's response to the Brady and Rule 5 motions made no mention \r\n  of the conversation between Duncan and Quattlebaum and made no mention of the \r\n  rumored existence of a videotape of that conversation.  \r\nOn June 30, 1997, counsel for Quattlebaum served an additional discovery motion \r\n  on the Solicitor's Office.  By this time, it was contemplated by the parties \r\n  that Quattlebaum's case would be heard during the November 10, 1997 term of \r\n  General Sessions Court in Lexington County.  The new discovery motion specifically \r\n  requested &quot;[c]opies of all videotape or audiotape of any interviews with \r\n  the defendant.&quot;  After receiving the motion, respondent immediately contacted \r\n  the Sheriff's Department for any additional information subject to discovery, \r\n  including any and all videotapes of interviews with Quattlebaum.  Edward Hite \r\n  confirmed that a videotape, containing both audio and video recordings, existed \r\n  of the conversation between Duncan and Quattlebaum.\r\nOn August 1, 1997, respondent wrote Evatt a letter stating &quot;copies of \r\n  all . . . video tapes made in connection with this case will be provided at \r\n  cost to you by Friday, August 8, 1997, at noon.&quot;  On August 7, 1997, respondent \r\n  met with Evatt and advised her that the conversation between Duncan and Quattlebaum \r\n  had been overheard, that respondent was present and knew of this occurrence \r\n  on the occasion that it happened, that a videotape was reported to have been \r\n  made of that conversation, and if a videotape of that conversation existed it \r\n  would be made available to her.  This was the first time respondent advised \r\n  Evatt, or any other counsel for Quattlebaum, that the conversation between Duncan \r\n  and Quattlebaum had been overheard or that a videotape of the conversation existed \r\n  or was rumored to exist.  Respondent maintained he had not seen the videotape \r\n  until it was delivered by an investigator for the Sheriff's Department, on August \r\n  7, 1997, after respondent had spoken with Evatt.  A copy of the videotape was \r\n  provided to Evatt the following day.\r\nRespondent either knew or should have known of the existence of the videotape \r\n  as early as March 1996.  Respondent acknowledges that the existence of the tape \r\n  could have, in all likelihood, been easily confirmed in March 1996 had he vigorously \r\n  pursued the rumor of the existence of the videotape and demanded that the Sheriff's \r\n  Department address the rumor and report back immediately as to whether the rumored \r\n  videotape existed.\r\nRespondent acknowledges that he now knows that Rule 5(a)(1)(A), SCRCrimP, provides \r\n  for disclosure of &quot;. . . any relevant . . . recorded statement made by \r\n  the defendant within the possession, custody or control of the prosecution, \r\n  the existence of which is known or by the exercise of due diligence may become \r\n  known to the attorney for the prosecution.&quot;  Respondent also recognizes, \r\n  but did not previously, that this provision of Rule 5 applies to any recorded \r\n  statements of a defendant, not just to those made to law enforcement.  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that he knew that Rule 5(a)(1)(C), SCRCrimP, requires \r\n  disclosure of &quot;photographs.&quot;  He also recognizes, but did not previously, \r\n  that videotapes are included in the definition of &quot;photographs&quot; found \r\n  in Rule 1001(2), SCRE.  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that, in retrospect, he may have, under Rule 5, been \r\n  obligated in March 1996 and thereafter to advise counsel for Quattlebaum of \r\n  the rumored existence of the videotape.  He acknowledges he was further obligated \r\n  to have aggressively sought to have determined whether the rumored existence \r\n  of the videotape was correct and, if so, to have promptly notified counsel for \r\n  Quattlebaum and to have promptly provided them with a copy of the tape.  \r\nRespondent acknowledges that, in retrospect, as an officer of the court, he \r\n  had an obligation to take affirmative action to ensure the monitoring of the \r\n  conversation immediately ceased and a further obligation to notify both counsel \r\n  for Quattlebaum and the Court of General Sessions of the occurrence, even prior \r\n  to discovery motions being filed and more so after the initial discovery motions \r\n  had been served.  Finally, respondent acknowledges that he should have withdrawn \r\n  from participation in the Quattlebaum case on the basis set forth in State \r\n  v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000).\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 3.4(c)(a lawyer shall not knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules \r\n  of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid \r\n  obligation exists); Rule 3.4(d)(a lawyer shall not, in pretrial procedure, fail \r\n  to make a reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper discovery \r\n  request by an opposing party); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for \r\n  a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it \r\n  is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial \r\n  to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent also admits that he has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice \r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or to engage in \r\n  conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law). \r\nConclusion\r\nIn our opinion, respondent's misconduct warrants a one year \r\n  suspension from the practice of law.  Respondent shall receive credit for the \r\n  time he was on interim suspension from May 2, 2000 until August 3, 2000, and \r\n  from September 20, 2000 until November 22, 2000.  Within fifteen days of the \r\n  date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court \r\n  showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Rule 403, SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-05-30-01","description":"This order amends Rule 403, SCACR, to reduce the number of trial experiences required when an applicant has served as a law clerk for a Federal Bankruptcy Judge in South Carolina.","date":"2003-06-02","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRE:Â  Rule 403, SCACR\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPursuant to \r\n  Article V, Â§ 4, of the South Carolina Constitution, the following amendments \r\n  are made to Rule 403, SCACR:\r\n(1)&nbsp;Sections (i) and (j) are renumbered as (j) and (k).\r\n  (2)&nbsp;The following is added:\r\n\r\n(i)Â Federal Bankruptcy Law Clerks.Â  A person \r\n  employed full time for nine (9) months as a law clerk for a Federal Bankruptcy \r\n  Judge in South Carolina may be certified as having completed the requirements \r\n  of this rule by participating in or observing two (2) civil trials which meet \r\n  the requirements of (c)(1) above, three (3) criminal trials which meet the requirements \r\n  of (c)(2) above, and two (2) family court trials which meet the requirements \r\n  of (c)(4) above.Â  A part-time law clerk may be certified in a similar manner \r\n  if the law clerk has been employed as a law clerk for at least 1350 hours.

SLED \r\n  arson agent Terry Alexander (â€œAlexanderâ€) arrived to investigate the cause of \r\n  the fire and spoke with Evans two separate times that afternoon.  A very upset \r\n  Evans was willing to talk with Alexander but refused to provide a written statement.  \r\n  Alexander returned to the house where Evans was staying ten days later to get \r\n  a formal written statement from her.  Evans was not at the home, so Alexander \r\n  left a message asking her to come to the Pageland, South Carolina police station. \r\n  [2]     \r\nEvans arrived at the police station later that \r\n  day with some of her relatives, and Alexander and SLED Lieutenant Doug Ross \r\n  (â€œRossâ€) took her into a back office to take her statement.  The SLED agents \r\n  never read Evans her Miranda rights.  \r\nDuring the interview, Evans gave several reasons \r\n  as to how the fire may have started: a faulty electrical outlet, dogs under \r\n  the trailer disrupting the electrical wiring, a heating stove that was left \r\n  on, and the fact that her 21 year-old sister was teaching her son how to light \r\n  a fire.  Ross repeatedly told Evans that he did not believe any of her explanations.  \r\n  Evans remained emotionally unstable during the interview.  She sobbed frequently \r\n  and continuously asked the agents â€œto get her some help.â€  Finally, the agents \r\n  determined that the interview was bearing fruit, and they stepped out of the \r\n  room.  \r\nThe agents met Agent Jennifer Edwards (â€œEdwardsâ€) \r\n  of the SLED Child Fatality Division outside the room, and they requested that \r\n  she attempt to talk with Evans who was shaking, sobbing, and very nervous.  Edwards \r\n  tried to sympathize with Evans by discussing religion, saying that her children \r\n  must be in heaven.  They also discussed Evansâ€™ dead mother and â€œfemale problemsâ€ \r\n  that Evans had experienced with the birth of her three children.  Evans kept \r\n  on asking for help, and Edwards told her she would get her some help.  \r\nThe two women were in the room together for around \r\n  45 minutes to an hour.  Evans went to the bathroom two times during this period, \r\n  and Edwards accompanied her and waited outside the bathroom door.  \r\nEventually, Evans told Edwards, â€œI dropped a lit \r\n  piece of paper on the floor.  I walked next door and waited until somebody saw \r\n  the fire.â€     Edwards immediately called Ross and then Alexander into the room, \r\n  and Evans repeated the statement three times.  Alexander wrote down the statement \r\n  on a â€œvoluntary statementâ€ form, which already contained Evansâ€™ original written \r\n  statement taken earlier in the interview.  Evans signed and initialed the document.  \r\n  She testified that she believed that in signing the document that she would \r\n  get some help.  Shortly after making the statement, the agents arrested Evans.  \r\n  The interview had lasted for three hours.  \r\nEvansâ€™ cousin Inez Robinson, who accompanied Evans \r\n  to the police station, attempted to go back and see Evans three times, but the \r\n  officers refused her access to the back room.  \r\nThe trial judge granted Evansâ€™ motion to suppress \r\n  the inculpatory statement that Evans gave to the SLED agents, finding that the \r\n  agents had placed Evans in the functional equivalent of a custodial interrogation \r\n  and should have read Evans her Miranda rights.  \r\nInitially, the Court of Appeals upheld the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s determination, finding that Evans was not free to leave the custody \r\n  of the SLED agents.  State v. Evans, 341 S.C. 219, 534 S.E.2d 10 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000).  On rehearing, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the action \r\n  so that the trial judge could make a more definite ruling as to whether Evans \r\n  was in custody.  State v. Evans, 343 S.C. 685, 541 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001).  \r\nThis Court granted a Petition for Certiorari to \r\n  review the Court of Appealsâ€™ reversal of the trial judgeâ€™s grant of the motion \r\n  to suppress an inculpatory statement.  Evans raises the following issue for \r\n  review:\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing the trial \r\n  court and remanding the issue of whether Evans was in police custody when she \r\n  gave an inculpatory statement?   \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nAppellate review of whether a person is \r\n  in custody is confined to a determination of whether the ruling by the trial \r\n  judge is supported by the record.  State v. Easler, 322 S.C. 333, 342, \r\n  471 S.E.2d 745, 751 (Ct. App. 1996) affâ€™d as modified, 327 S.C. 121, \r\n  489 S.E.2d 617 (1997).    \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nEvans asserts that the \r\n  Court of Appeals erred in reversing and remanding the trial judgeâ€™s finding \r\n  that she was in custody when she made her inculpatory statement and that her \r\n  statement should be suppressed because the agents failed to Mirandize \r\n  her.  We agree. \r\nThe purpose of the Miranda \r\n  warnings is to apprise the defendant of her constitutional privilege to not \r\n  incriminate herself while in the custody of law enforcement.  Miranda, \r\n  384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612.  Law enforcement must state the Miranda \r\n  warnings â€œafter a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of \r\n  his freedom of action in any way.â€  Id.  To determine whether a suspect \r\n  is in custody, the trial court must examine the totality of the circumstances, \r\n  which include factors such as the place, purpose, and length of interrogation, \r\n  as well as whether the suspect was free to leave the place of questioning.  \r\n  Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984); \r\n  United States v. Helmel, 769 F.2d 1306, 1320 (8th Cir. 1985); \r\n  Robert Kaupp v. Texas, ___ S.Ct. ___, 2003 WL 2010974 (May 5, 2003).  \r\n  The custodial determination is an objective analysis based on whether a reasonable \r\n  person would have concluded that he was in police custody.  Bradley v. State, \r\n  316 S.C. 255, 257, 449 S.E.2d 492, 493-494 (1994); State v. Sprouse, \r\n  325 S.C. 275, 282, 478 S.E.2d 871, 875 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\nIn his oral order, the \r\n  trial judge used the correct objective standard in analyzing whether Evans was \r\n  in custody.  In addition, he stated, â€œ[y]ou also have to take into account that \r\n  she was at the time in her mid-20s, mildly retarded, no evidence of any record \r\n  so, therefore, no real evidence of exposure.â€  The Court of Appeals reversed \r\n  and remanded the trial judgeâ€™s determination because it found that the judge \r\n  might have tainted the objective custody analysis with this subjective comment.  \r\n  State v. Evans, 343 S.C. at 692, 541 S.E.2d at 855.  \r\nWe believe that the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  order provides abundant justification for his determination that Evans was in \r\n  police custody.  First, he found Evans was not free to leave.  When Evans \r\n  went to the restroom, Agent Edwards accompanied her at all times and waited \r\n  outside the restroom.  Also, the officers would not permit Evansâ€™ cousin to \r\n  go back to the interview room.  Second, the place where the agents interviewed \r\n  Evans also concerned the judge in that it was in a back office in the police \r\n  station.  Third, the judge noted that the interview was lengthy, as it \r\n  lasted three hours.  Finally, the judge was most concerned with the agentâ€™s \r\n  purpose.  He said:\r\n\r\nWhat really turns it for me was \r\n  that when â€¦ That her story was challenged and once that was challenged, that \r\n  changes from just a routine inquiry to name, rank and serial number.  They (Alexander \r\n  and Ross), in fact, put it to her that they did not believe her.  As soon as \r\n  that occurred, then the switch over to the female officer (Edwards) occurred.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold that the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s order, in toto, reflects that he objectively examined the totality \r\n  of the circumstances and concluded that the agents placed Evans in a custodial \r\n  interrogation setting, which warranted a recitation of her Miranda rights.  \r\n  Accordingly, the trial judge was justified in granting Evansâ€™ motion to suppress \r\n  her inculpatory statement.  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe REVERSE the \r\n  Court of Appeals and find that the trial judge did not err in granting Evansâ€™ \r\n  motion to suppress an inculpatory statement.  We believe that after considering \r\n  the totality of the circumstances, the judge did not abuse his discretion in \r\n  concluding that Evans was in police custody when she made the inculpatory statement.     \r\n\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Miranda v.

Bi-Lo, Inc., 341 \r\n  S.C. 611, 535 S.E.2d 445 (Ct. App. 2000).  We reverse.           \r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner Sherry Brown (Employee) sustained a compensable \r\n  injury while working for Respondent Bi-Lo, Inc., (Employer).  After Employeeâ€™s \r\n  surgery, Employer agreed to continue to provide medical treatment.  Several \r\n  years later, a question arose whether medical treatment sought by Employee for \r\n  subsequent falls was related to the work injury and, thus, whether Employer \r\n  was required to pay for the medical treatment.  Employee filed a Form 50 requesting \r\n  a hearing to obtain medical treatment.  \r\nEmployer hired a rehabilitation nurse to contact Employeeâ€™s \r\n  treating physicians regarding the nature of her condition and cause of her falls.  \r\n  Employeeâ€™s attorney wrote a letter to the nurse warning her not to discuss Employeeâ€™s \r\n  condition with Employeeâ€™s treating physicians and threatening legal action if \r\n  she did not comply.  Employeeâ€™s attorney wrote similar letters to Employeeâ€™s \r\n  treating physicians, advising them not to engage in ex parte communications \r\n  with Employer or Employerâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation carrier.  \r\nEmployer complained to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission \r\n  (Commission).  The Commission ordered Employeeâ€™s attorney to â€œcease and desist \r\n  from obstructing contact, including contact involving ex parte communications, \r\n  meetings, correspondence, and/or answering questions in written and oral form, \r\n  between the treating physician and the defendantâ€™s representatives.â€  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by affirming the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  order requiring Employeeâ€™s counsel to cease and desist from seeking to limit \r\n  contact between Employerâ€™s representatives and Employeeâ€™s health care providers?  \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act (the Act) [1]  requires physicians provide employers and/or \r\n  their representatives with pertinent information regarding the treatment of \r\n  a compensation claimant. [2]   \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-95 (Supp. 2002) specifically provides:  \r\n\r\nAll existing information compiled by a health care facility, as defined \r\n  in Section 44-7-130, or a health care provider licensed pursuant to Title 40 \r\n  pertaining directly to a workersâ€™ compensation claim must be provided to the \r\n  insurance carrier, the employer, the employee, their attorneys or the South \r\n  Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, within fourteen days after receipt \r\n  of written request.  A health care facility and a health care provider \r\n  may charge a fee for the search and duplication of a medical record, \r\n  . . .The facility or provider may charge a patient or the patientâ€™s representative \r\n  no more than the actual cost of reproducing an X-ray. . . If a treatment \r\n  facility or physician fails to send the requested information within forty-five \r\n  days after receipt of the request, the person or entity making the request \r\n  may apply to the commission for an appropriate penalty payable to the commission, \r\n  not to exceed two hundred dollars.  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added); see 25A S.C. Ann. Reg. 67-1301(A)(Supp. 2002) (â€œ[a] \r\n  medical practitioner or treatment facility shall furnish upon request all medical \r\n  information relevant to the employeeâ€™s complaint of injury to the claimant, \r\n  the employer, the employerâ€™s representative, or the Commissionâ€¦.â€). \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain \r\n  and give effect to the intent of the legislature.  Charleston County Sch. \r\n  Dist. v. State Budget and Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993).  \r\n  If a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning â€œthe \r\n  rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right \r\n  to impose another meaning.â€  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  578, 581 (2000).                    \r\nSection 42-15-95 contemplates the disclosure of existing \r\n  written records and documentary materials.  The statute refers to the exchange \r\n  of â€œexisting information,â€ â€œmedical record[s],â€ and â€œX-ray[s]â€ after receipt \r\n  of a written request.  Moreover, it provides a penalty if the facility or physician \r\n  fails to â€œsendâ€ information as requested.  This language indicates the General \r\n  Assemblyâ€™s clear intent to require health care providers and facilities to forward \r\n  existing written records and documents.  The statute does not authorize other \r\n  â€œex parteâ€ [3]  methods \r\n  of communication between an insurance carrier, employer, or their representatives \r\n  and the claimantâ€™s health care provider.  Of course, insurance carriers and \r\n  employers may obtain additional information through approved methods of discovery.  \r\n  See Â§ 42-3-160 (providing for taking of depositions in workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  actions).  Likewise, employer representatives may speak with the claimantâ€™s \r\n  health care provider provided they obtain the claimantâ€™s permission. \r\n  [4]                   \r\nWe recognize the Court generally gives \r\n  deference to an administrative agencyâ€™s interpretation of an applicable statute \r\n  or its own regulation.  Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. \r\n  Control, 348 S.C. 507, 560 S.E.2d 410 (2002).  Nevertheless, where, as here, \r\n  the plain language of the statute is contrary to the agencyâ€™s interpretation, \r\n  the Court will reject the agencyâ€™s interpretation.  Id.; Richland \r\n  County School Dist. Two v. South Carolina Dept. of Educ., 335 S.C. 491, \r\n  517 S.E.2d 444 (Ct. App.1999).  \r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that permitting \r\n  employers and their representatives to speak and/or communicate directly with \r\n  physicians may, in some instances, promote â€œswift and sure compensation,â€ which \r\n  is one goal of the Act. [5]   Nevertheless, workersâ€™ compensation is a creature \r\n  of statute.  As such, we are bound to strictly construe the terms of the statute \r\n  and to rely on the General Assembly to amend the statute where necessary.  See \r\n  Wigfall v. Tideland Utilities, Inc., Op. No. 25628 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed \r\n  April 14, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at pg.10) (because Act provides compensatory \r\n  system in derogation of common law rights, Court must strictly construe the \r\n  statute and leave it to the General Assembly to amend and define any ambiguities).\r\nFor these reasons, we reverse the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2002) (court \r\n  may reverse decision if substantial rights of appellant have been prejudiced \r\n  because agency conclusions are affected by error of law).  \r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; I respectfully disagree with \r\n  the majorityâ€™s conclusion and would affirm the Court of Appeals.  \r\nWorkersâ€™ compensation laws were enacted so that the \r\n  â€œemployee receives the right to swift and sure compensation; the employer receives \r\n  immunity from tort actions by the employee.  This quid pro quo approach to workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation has worked to the advantage of society as well as the employee \r\n  and employer.â€  Parker v. Williams and Madjanik, Inc., 275 S.C. 65, 70, \r\n  267 S.E.2d 524, 526 (1980). The purpose of workersâ€™ compensation is to settle \r\n  claims quickly and efficiently.  Id.  One of the ways the legislature \r\n  sought to insure this result was by enacting statutes that require the exchange \r\n  of medical information so that claims can be evaluated and settled in a timely \r\n  manner.  \r\nBoth the employerâ€™s representatives and the claimantâ€™s \r\n  representatives must comply with the statutes and regulation compelling disclosure \r\n  of relevant medical information.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-95 (1976) provides:\r\n\r\nAll existing information compiled by a health \r\n  care facility, as defined in Section 44-7-130, or a health care provider licensed \r\n  pursuant to Title 40 pertaining directly to a workersâ€™ compensation claim \r\n  must be provided to the insurance carrier, the employer, the employee, their \r\n  attorneys or the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, within fourteen \r\n  days after receipt of written requestâ€¦. \r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. Â§ 67-1301(A) (Supp. 2001) provides \r\n  â€œ[a] medical practitioner or treatment facility shall furnish upon request \r\n  all medical information relevant to the employeeâ€™s complaint of injury to \r\n  the claimant, the employer, the employerâ€™s representative, or the Commissionâ€¦.â€  \r\n  (emphasis supplied).  The claimantâ€™s health care providers and treatment facilities \r\n  are thus compelled by the statute, and by the regulation, to disclose information \r\n  relevant to the claimantâ€™s injury to all parties and their representatives.  \r\n\r\nThe question before us is whether the Commission properly \r\n  interpreted its regulation to allow Employer and its representatives to contact \r\n  the health care providers â€œex parteâ€ \r\n  [6]   whether face to face, through written correspondence, or through oral \r\n  communications. The decision of an agency interpreting its own regulation is \r\n  given great deference. Goodman v. City of Columbia, 318 S.C. 488, 458 \r\n  S.E.2d 531 (1995).  I would find that such an interpretation of the regulation \r\n  [7]  was not an abuse of discretion. [8]   \r\nBoth the statute and the regulation compel the claimantâ€™s \r\n  health care provider to furnish the employerâ€™s representatives medical information \r\n  pertaining to the workerâ€™s claim. \r\n  [9]   The providers are limited to furnishing information that is relevant \r\n  to the patientâ€™s claim.  So long as the information is relevant to the claim, \r\n  the provider is not limited as to the manner of its communication.  While â€œexisting \r\n  informationâ€ will most often take the form of written records nothing precludes \r\n  the provider from communicating verbally or in writing with anyone authorized \r\n  to receive such information.  I would hold that neither the claimant nor his \r\n  attorney is permitted, in the workersâ€™ compensation setting, to limit the communication \r\n  between the employerâ€™s representatives and the claimantâ€™s medical provider as \r\n  to matters relevant to the claim.  \r\nPetitioner expresses concern that the doctor \r\n  may exceed the scope of relevant medical information when responding to such \r\n  an inquiry.  Physicians must be guided by their code of medical ethics.  [10]    In my opinion, since the responses are \r\n  compelled by law, the physician who respects the line between information relevant \r\n  to the claim, and that which is irrelevant, would not be exposed to liability \r\n  for improper disclosure.  [11]   \r\nI respectfully disagree with the majority \r\n  and would find that the Commission did not err in ordering Petitionerâ€™s attorney \r\n  to cease and desist from seeking to limit contact between the Employerâ€™s representatives \r\n  and Petitionerâ€™s health care provider.  Therefore, I would affirm the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-10 et. seq. (1985).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    The Act specifies that facts communicated to or otherwise learned by a physician \r\n    during the course of treatment are not privileged.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-80.  \r\n           \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    We use the term â€œex parte communicationâ€ because that was the term \r\n    used by the Commission.  However, the exchange of information sought here \r\n    by Employer is not an â€œex parte communication.â€  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary \r\n    597 (7th ed. 1999) (ex parte communication is defined as \r\n    â€œprohibited communication between counsel and the court when opposing counsel \r\n    is not present.â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Our \r\n    analysis is supported by similar decisions in North Carolina holding that \r\n    policy considerations of patient privacy, physician-patient confidences, and \r\n    the adequacy of formal discovery methods render ex parte communications \r\n    between an employeeâ€™s treating physician and employer representatives improper.  \r\n    Burchette v.

Williams and Madjanik, Inc., 275 S.C. 65, 70, \r\n    267 S.E.2d 524, 526 (1980).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]   I agree with the majority that the phrase â€œex \r\n    parte communicationâ€ is not the appropriate term.  The exchange of information \r\n    sought by Employer is not an â€œex parte communication.â€ An ex parte \r\n    communication is defined as  â€œprohibited communication between counsel and \r\n    the court when opposing counsel is not present.â€  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary \r\n    597 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999).  The phrase â€œex \r\n    parte communicationâ€ implies that the communication was with the court.  \r\n    Here, the communication was between the employerâ€™s representative and a witness.  \r\n    Further, the phrase implies the communication was done without notice to the \r\n    other party.  In this case, the claimant was on notice that the Employerâ€™s \r\n    representatives could communicate with the physician because she initiated \r\n    the workersâ€™ compensation claim.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  There is no challenge to the regulation as exceeding \r\n    the agencyâ€™s authority.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  I agree with the majority that decisions of North \r\n    Carolina courts construing that stateâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation statutes are \r\n    entitled to great weight.  Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, \r\n    564 S.E.2d 110 (2002).  However, I respectfully disagree that North Carolinaâ€™s \r\n    precedent is entitled to great weight in the case at bar.  North Carolina \r\n    recognizes a physician-patient privilege, Crist v. Moffatt, 389 S.E.2d \r\n    41 (N.C. 1990), while South Carolina does not.  McCormick v. England, \r\n    328 S.C. 627, 494 S.E.2d 431 (Ct. App. 1997).  North Carolinaâ€™s Supreme Court \r\n    first held that ex parte communications were inappropriate in a medical \r\n    malpractice case in Crist v. Moffatt, supra.   The North Carolina \r\n    Court of Appeals then held that ex parte communications, therefore, \r\n    were also banned in workersâ€™ compensation cases, but stated were they â€œwriting \r\n    on a clean slateâ€ the defendantâ€™s arguments for ex parte communications \r\n    â€œwould carry great forceâ€¦we nonetheless are bound by Crist.â€  Salaam \r\n    v.

Chandler, Jr., of Pawleys Island, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  We granted certiorari to consider \r\n  a decision of the Court of Appeals holding that the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Health and Environmental Control, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management \r\n  (OCRM) was prohibited by the Beachfront Management Act [1]  (BMA) from issuing permits allowing existing groins [2]  to be repaired or new groins \r\n  to be constructed.  South Carolina Coastal Conserv. League v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 345 S.C. 525, 548 S.E.2d 887 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOCRM issued a permit to petitioner Port Royal Plantation allowing petitioner \r\n  to construct four new groins and to refurbish 17 existing groins.  Respondents \r\n  filed a request for a contested case hearing, seeking to overturn the permit.  \r\n  The administrative law judge (ALJ) granted petitionersâ€™ [3]  motion for summary judgment, and respondents appealed to the \r\n  Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel, which affirmed the ALJâ€™s decision.  \r\n  On appeal, the circuit court upheld the issuance of the permit.\r\nRespondents then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed.  \r\n  South Carolina Coastal Conserv. League v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health \r\n  and Envtl. Control, supra.  The Court of Appeals held that the BMA \r\n  prohibited the OCRM from issuing a permit for the construction of new groins \r\n  or the reconstruction of existing groins.  Id.  This certiorari followed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the legislature \r\n  intended to prohibit permits for the rehabilitation or construction of groins?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWe begin our analysis by \r\n  outlining the points upon which the parties and the Court of Appeals agree.  \r\n  There is no question that groins are not â€œerosion control structures or devicesâ€ \r\n  as defined by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-270(1) (Supp. 2002).  Accordingly, all \r\n  agree that the specific prohibition on the construction of new erosion control \r\n  devices in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-290(2)(a) and the restrictions on repairs \r\n  to such devices in Â§ 48-39-290(2)(b) do not apply to groins.\r\nFurther, there is no dispute that the policy of this State, expressed in the \r\n  BMA, is to â€œprotect, preserve, restore, and enhance the Stateâ€™s beach/dune system,â€ \r\n  and to use beach renourishment where appropriate. S.C. Code Ann.  Â§ 48-39-260 \r\n  (Supp. 2002).  The BMA authorized OCRM to â€œdevelop and institute a comprehensive \r\n  beach erosion control policy,â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-120(B) (Supp. 2002).  \r\n  Further, the BMA granted OCRM the discretion to determine whether to permit \r\n  or deny alterations or utilization within the â€˜critical areas.â€™  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 48-39-210 (Supp. 2002).  Groins, by definition, must be located in â€˜critical \r\n  areasâ€™ [4]  on the â€˜active beach.â€™ [5]   \r\nPursuant to this grant of \r\n  authority, OCRM adopted regulations.  One regulation specifically authorizes \r\n  the use of groins where necessary â€œto enhance the design life of an ongoing \r\n  renourishment effort â€¦ .â€  23A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 30-13(N) (Supp. 2002).  The \r\n  permit at issue in this case was issued pursuant to Reg. 30-13(N) and the BMA.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found the permit issue controlled \r\n  exclusively by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-290.  Section (A) of this statute generally \r\n  prohibits new construction in the area seaward of the baseline (which includes \r\n  the area where groins are located, the â€˜active beachâ€™), subject to several exceptions.  \r\n  Groins are not among these exceptions.  Therefore, the Court of Appeals held \r\n  that OCRM lacked authority to issue groin permits. \r\nFurther, the Court of Appeals concluded that, because groins are not mentioned \r\n  at all in the version of the BMA in effect at the time this permitting decision \r\n  took place,  [6]  and because \r\n  they must, of necessity, be constructed on the â€˜active beach,â€™  â€˜special permitsâ€™ \r\n  to construct groins could not be issued pursuant to Â§ 48-39-290(D)(1). [7]   The Court of Appeals held that \r\n  its construction of Â§ 48-39-290, absolutely barring any construction or repair \r\n  of groins, â€œfully comports with the purpose and policy of the [BMA].â€  We disagree.\r\nUnlike the Court of Appeals, we do not find that the question of groin permits \r\n  can be answered by examining Â§ 48-39-290 in isolation.  As we read Â§ 48-39-290(A), \r\n  it generally prohibits construction of recreational structures, just as Â§ 48-39-290(B) \r\n  generally prohibits construction of habitable structures.  Further, to find \r\n  groin permits are prohibited by Â§ 48-39-290(D)(1) undermines the OCRMâ€™s statutory \r\n  mandate to administer a â€œcomprehensive beach erosion control policy,â€ Â§ 48-39-120(A), \r\n  and frustrates the legislatureâ€™s instruction that the State should â€œencourage \r\n  the use of erosion-inhibiting techniques which do not adversely impact the long-term \r\n  well-being of the beach/dune systemâ€ and â€œpromote carefully planned renourishment \r\n  as a means of beach preservation and restoration where economically feasible,â€ \r\n  Â§ 48-39-260(4) and (5), since groins are defined in the regulations as erosion-retardation \r\n  devices.  See fn. 2, supra; see e.g., Great Games, Inc. \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Rev., 339 S.C. 79, 529 S.E.2d 6 (2000) (statutes \r\n  which are part of the same legislative scheme should be read together to ascertain \r\n  legislative intent).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the BMA authorized OCRM to issue groin permits in furtherance \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s policy of encouraging certain types of erosion-inhibiting techniques \r\n  and promoting beach renourishment where appropriate.  Our conclusion that the \r\n  General Assembly did not intend to ban groins is reinforced by its enactment, \r\n  after the adoption of the BMA, of â€œThe Beach Restoration and Improvement Trust \r\n  Act,â€ [8]  creating a beach renourishment \r\n  program to be implemented by OCRM.  This Act specifically authorizes groin construction \r\n  and maintenance. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-40-20(3).  See e.g., Denene, \r\n  Inc. v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. 208, 574 S.E.2d 196 (2002) (â€œCourt \r\n  must presume the legislature did not intend a futile act, but rather intended \r\n  its statutes to accomplish somethingâ€).\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals is \r\nREVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-39-10 et seq. (Supp. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  A groin is defined as â€œa structure designed to \r\n    retard erosion of a beach by trapping littoral drift.  Groins are usually \r\n    perpendicular to the shore and extend from the shoreline into the water far \r\n    enough to accomplish their purpose.  Groins are narrow and vary in length \r\n    from less than one hundred feet to several hundred feetâ€¦.â€  23A S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Reg. 30-1(24) (Supp. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Petitioners are OCRM, Port Royal Plantation, and \r\n    the Town of Hilton Head Island.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The â€˜critical areaâ€™ includes beaches.  S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 48-39-10(J)(3) (Supp. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  The term â€˜active beachâ€™ is defined as â€œthat area \r\n    seaward of the escarpment or the first line of stable natural vegetation, \r\n    whichever first occurs, measured from the ocean.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-270(13) \r\n    (Supp. 2002).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  In March 2002, Â§ 48-39-290(A) was amended to explicitly \r\n    authorize the issuance of permits to construct and/or reconstruct groins.  \r\n    See 2002 S.C. Act No. 198.  We agree with petitioners that this amendment \r\n    does not moot this suit, since the effect of our decision today reversing \r\n    the Court of Appeals is to reinstate their permit and all other groin permits \r\n    issued under the pre-March 2002 version of the BMA.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  This subsection provides:\r\n  \r\n  (D)  Special permits:\r\n    \r\n  (1) If an applicant requests a permit to build or rebuild \r\n    a structure other than an erosion control structure or device seaward of the \r\n    baseline that is not allowed otherwise pursuant to Sections 48-39-250 through \r\n    48-39-360, the department may issue a special permit to the applicant authorizing \r\n    the construction or reconstruction if the structure is not constructed or \r\n    reconstructed on a primary oceanfront sand dune or on the active beach and, \r\n    if the beach erodes to the extent the permitted structure becomes situated \r\n    on the active beach, the permittee agrees to remove the structure from the \r\n    active beach if the department orders the removal.  However, the use of the \r\n    property authorized under this provision, in the determination of the department, \r\n    must not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  S.C.

Condon, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald \r\n  J. Zelenka, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of the Sixteenth \r\n  Judicial Circuit; for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  Petitioner, Theryl Avery Taylor (â€œPetitionerâ€), \r\n  petitioned this Court to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision affirming his \r\n  conviction for murder on grounds that the trial court erred in charging mutual \r\n  combat to the jury.  This Court granted certiorari and issued an opinion reversing \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s murder conviction.  Subsequently, Petitioner filed a Petition for \r\n  Rehearing, arguing that this Court must also reverse his conviction for Possession \r\n  of a Firearm or Knife during Commission of a Violent Crime pursuant to S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490 (2003).  This Court granted the Petition for Rehearing \r\n  and issues the following opinion reversing both of Petitionerâ€™s convictions. \r\n\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nOn December 16, 1998, Petitioner hired \r\n  Robert Murphy (â€œMurphyâ€), fourteen year-old Shane Wallace, and Shaneâ€™s teenaged \r\n  friend Dean, to help him in his tree service business.  After working that day, \r\n  Petitioner and Murphy drove the two young men to the home of Shaneâ€™s mother, \r\n  Angela Wallace, an acquaintance of both Murphy and Petitioner.  When they arrived \r\n  at Angelaâ€™s house, Petitioner and Murphy went inside and joined Angela, Myranda \r\n  Stillinger, and Kevin Carter who had been drinking heavily all day.  Shane, \r\n  Dean, and Shaneâ€™s sister, Chrystal, played outside.\r\nWhile the testimony \r\n  varied widely regarding many of the relevant facts, all witnesses agreed that, \r\n  at some point in the evening, Kevin and Myranda began arguing.  Petitioner testified \r\n  that Kevin forcefully pushed Myranda into a counter.  All parties agreed that \r\n  Petitioner intervened, either physically or verbally, to stop the apparently \r\n  escalating argument between Kevin and Myranda.  Kevin and Petitioner then engaged \r\n  in a violent, physical confrontation; however, the witnesses disagree about \r\n  who started the fight and about its intensity at various points.  \r\nAt trial, Murphy testified \r\n  that the fight began when Petitioner â€œsucker-punchedâ€ Kevin.  Murphy reported, \r\n  â€œ[a]nd thatâ€™s when [Petitioner] said, you know, Iâ€™m not afraid of you, big man.  \r\n  And [Kevin] said, Iâ€™m not afraid of you either.  And thatâ€™s when [Petitioner] \r\n  said, weâ€™re going to hell or jail.  And all of sudden, he just hauled off and \r\n  punched [Kevin] in the head while [Kevin] was sitting down.â€ [1]   \r\nPetitioner, on the other hand, testified \r\n  that Kevin threw the first punch, and that he tried to withdraw from the fight, \r\n  but that Kevin would not release him and continued to beat him.  Other witnesses \r\n  asserted that Kevin, not Petitioner, attempted to quit fighting.  All witnesses \r\n  agree that Angela insisted the two take the fight outside, and that they continued \r\n  their struggle on the porch of the trailer and into the front yard.  \r\nAt some point thereafter, Petitioner drew a buck \r\n  knife from his pocket, and began stabbing Kevin.  The autopsy report disclosed \r\n  that Kevin was stabbed fifteen times and died of a stab wound to the heart.  \r\n  The autopsy reported Kevin was six feet two inches tall and weighed approximately \r\n  270 pounds at the time of his death.  A physical examination of Petitioner a \r\n  few days after the fight revealed Petitioner had undergone abdominal surgery \r\n  in the weeks preceding this incident after a car accident, but indicated no \r\n  new cuts or bruises.  Petitioner was substantially smaller than Kevin.\r\nAt trial, Petitioner admitted he stabbed \r\n  Kevin, but alleged he did so in self-defense.  The trial judge charged the jury \r\n  on self-defense and, over Petitionerâ€™s objection, on mutual combat, as follows:\r\n\r\nWe also have the law in this state regarding what is sometimes referred to as \r\n  mutual combat.  This premise is in the law where two persons are mutually engaged \r\n  in combat and one kills the other.  And at the time of the killing it being \r\n  maliciously done as murder. \r\nIf it be done in the sudden heat of passion upon sufficient \r\n  provocation or without premeditation, it would be manslaughter.\r\nOne who provokes or initiates an assault and not [sic] escape from the liability \r\n  may find in self-defense a defense to a prosecution arising with respect to \r\n  injury or death of their adversary.\r\nAnd where a person voluntarily participates in mutual \r\n  combat for purposes other than protection you cannot justify or excuse the killing \r\n  of the adversary in the course of such conduct on the ground of self-defense, \r\n  regardless of what extremity or even peril he may be introduced to in the process \r\n  of the combat.  Unless in either event before the homicide is committed the \r\n  person withdraws and does in good faith decline from the conflict and either \r\n  by word or by act makes that known to their adversary.\r\nThen if the adversary pursues them the aggressor may upon the belief that they \r\n  are in danger injure or kill the adversary.  Communication by one to an adversary \r\n  or attempt to withdraw may be explicit or verbal by use of words or may be implicit \r\n  by conduct, such as retiring or attempting to retire from the scene and abandoning \r\n  conflict. \r\n\r\nThe jury convicted Petitioner of murder and possession \r\n  of a weapon during commission of a violent crime.  The trial judge sentenced \r\n  Petitioner to thirty-six years for murder and five years, concurrent, for the \r\n  weapons charge.  The Court of Appeals affirmed Petitionerâ€™s convictions.  The \r\n  State v. Therl Avery Taylor, Op. No. 2000-UP-484 (S.C. Ct. App., filed June \r\n  26, 2000).  This Court granted certiorari to review the following issue:\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in delivering a charge on mutual \r\n  combat to the jury, and, if so, was Petitioner prejudiced by the charge?    \r\n\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner argues that \r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s jury charge on mutual \r\n  combat.  We agree.\r\nIn general, the trial judge is required \r\n  to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina, Cohens v. Atkins, \r\n  333 S.C. 345, 509 S.E.2d 286 (Ct. App. 1998), and the law to be charged \r\n  to the jury is determined by the evidence at trial.  State v. Hill, 315 \r\n  S.C. 260, 262, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993).  To warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial.  Ellison v. Parts Distributors, \r\n  Inc., 302 S.C. 299, 395 S.E.2d 740 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nThe doctrine of mutual combat has existed \r\n  in South Carolina since at least 1843, but has fallen out of common use in recent \r\n  years.  The case law does establish that there must be â€œmutual intent and willingness \r\n  to fightâ€ to constitute mutual combat.  State v. Graham, 260 S.C. 449, \r\n  450, 196 S.E.2d 495, 495 (1973).  Mutual intent is â€œmanifested by the acts and \r\n  conduct of the parties and the circumstances attending and leading up to the \r\n  combat.â€  Id.  Whether or not mutual combat exists is significant because \r\n  â€œthe plea of self-defense is not available to one who kills another in mutual \r\n  combat.â€  Id. (citing State v. Jones, 113 S.C. 134, 101 S.E. 647 \r\n  (1919)).  In order to claim self-defense, the defendant â€œmust be without fault \r\n  in bringing on the difficulty.â€  State v. Davis, 282 S.C. 45, 46, 317 \r\n  S.E.2d 452, 453 (1984).  Because mutual combat requires mutual intent and willingness \r\n  to fight, if a defendant is found to have been involved in mutual combat, the \r\n  â€œno faultâ€ element of self-defense cannot be established.\r\nIf the defendant is engaged in mutual combat, self-defense \r\n  is unavailable unless the defendant withdraws from the conflict before the killing \r\n  occurs. [2]   A finding that a defendant was \r\n  engaged in mutual combat does not preclude the jury from convicting the defendant \r\n  of manslaughter as opposed to murder.  â€œWhere two persons mutually engage in \r\n  combat, and one kills another, and at the time of the killing it be maliciously \r\n  done, it is murder; if it be done in sudden heat and passion upon sufficient \r\n  provocation without premeditation or malice, it would be manslaughter.â€  State \r\n  v. Andrews, 73 S.C. 257, 53 S.E.423 (1906).\r\nThe doctrine has most often been applied \r\n  in situations where the defendant and decedent bear a grudge against each other \r\n  before the fight in which one of them is killed occurs.  State v. Porter, \r\n  269 S.C. 618, 239 S.E.2d 641 (1977) (holding mutual combat precluded a plea \r\n  of self-defense where Appellant returned to injured partyâ€™s property at least \r\n  twice with a gun despite prior verbal warnings not to return and accompanying \r\n  gunshots); Graham, 260 S.C. at 451, 196 S.E.2d at 496 (finding mutual \r\n  combat charge proper where appellant and deceased had quarreled prior to the \r\n  killing, each knew that the other was armed with a pistol, and each fired his \r\n  gun at the other); State v. Mathis, 174 S.C. 344, 177 S.E. 318 (1934) \r\n  (finding mutual combat charge proper based on testimony that appellant and deceased \r\n  were on the lookout for each other, that each was armed in anticipation of meeting \r\n  the other, and that each drew and fired his pistol at the other). [3]   \r\nAlthough South Carolina has not explicitly \r\n  required that the fight arise out of a pre-existing dispute, other states have \r\n  made this prerequisite to mutual combat explicit.  Texas and Colorado adhere \r\n  to the rule that an â€œantecedent agreement to fightâ€ must exist for the court \r\n  to charge mutual combat.  Eckhardt v. People, 247 P.2d 673 (Colo. 1952); \r\n  People v. Cuevas, 740 P.2d 25 (Colo. App. 1987); Lujan v. State, 430 \r\n  S.W.2d 513, 514 (Tex. Crim. App. 1968); Carson v. State, 230 S.W. 997 \r\n  (Tex. Crim. App. 1921).  \r\nGeorgia has limited the application of \r\n  mutual combat in another way by holding that mutual combat arises only when \r\n  the parties are armed with deadly weapons, and that mutual combat does not arise \r\n  from â€œa mere fist fight or scuffle.â€  Flowers v. State, 247 S.E.2d 217, \r\n  218 (Ga. App. 1978); Grant v. State, 170 S.E.2d 55, 56 (Ga. App. 1969).  \r\n  In both Flowers and Grant, the defendant admitted to killing the \r\n  decedent, but claimed self-defense.  In both cases, the disputes that ended \r\n  in death began as fist fights, and so the court found the mutual combat charge \r\n  erroneous.  Significantly, the court found that commingling charges on mutual \r\n  combat and justification was â€œipso facto harmfulâ€ because â€œit placed upon the \r\n  defendant a heavier burden than requiredâ€ for self-defense.    Grant, \r\n  170 S.E.2d at 56.  The court in Flowers explained, â€œ[t]o charge on mutual \r\n  combat, when there is no evidence to support it, effectively cancels the justification \r\n  defense.â€  247 S.E.2d at 218. \r\nWe believe the restrictions placed on \r\n  the applicability of mutual combat by the courts in Georgia, Colorado, and Texas \r\n  are warranted.  These limitations are consistent with the South Carolina cases \r\n  in which the mutual combat charges given were deemed to be proper:  Porter, \r\n  Graham, and Mathis.  As mentioned, mutual combat acts as a bar to self-defense \r\n  because it requires mutual agreement to fight on equal terms for purposes other \r\n  than protection.  This is inherently inconsistent with the concept of self-defense, \r\n  and directly conflicts with the â€œno faultâ€ finding necessary to establish self-defense.  \r\n  As such, it is only logical that the evidence of agreement to fight be plain, \r\n  like the evidence of mutual combat present in the Porter, Graham, and \r\n  Mathis cases.  In holding that mutual combat was properly charged in \r\n  Graham, this Court reasoned as follows:  \r\n\r\n[t]here was ill-will between the parties.  They \r\n  had threatened each other and it is inferable that they had armed themselves \r\n  to settle their differences at gun point.  Under these circumstances, the \r\n  apparent willingness of each to engage in an armed encounter with the other, \r\n  sustained an inference that they were engaged in mutual combat at the time of \r\n  the killing, and required that the issue be submitted to the jury for determination.\r\n\r\n260 S.C. at 452, 196 S.E.2d at 496. (emphasis added).\r\nIn this case, the evidence \r\n  of events leading up to and during the fight between Petitioner and Kevin is \r\n  sketchy at best.  The witnesses, with the exception of the child witnesses, \r\n  were extremely intoxicated, and arguably exhibited bias toward the decedent.  \r\n  There is no evidence, and the State does not contend, that there was any pre-existing \r\n  ill-will or dispute between Kevin and the Petitioner, and there is no evidence \r\n  that Kevin was willing to engage in an armed encounter with Petitioner.  \r\n  In their determination of mutual willingness to fight, the South Carolina cases \r\n  discussed emphasize that each party knew the other was armed. Here, there \r\n  is no indication that Kevin knew Petitioner was armed with a knife, and there \r\n  was no pre-existing ill-will between the parties.  Under these circumstances, \r\n  there is insufficient evidence of mutual willingness to fight to submit the \r\n  issue of mutual combat to the jury.\r\nAs noted, to warrant reversal, a jury \r\n  charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial.  In our opinion, the mutual combat \r\n  charge was prejudicial to Petitioner as well as erroneous.  Ellison, \r\n  302 S.C. 299, 395 S.E.2d 740 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nThe mutual combat doctrine is triggered \r\n  when both parties contribute to the resulting fight.  Self-defense, on the other \r\n  hand, is available only when the defendant is without fault in bringing on the \r\n  difficulty.  Davis.  Despite this fundamental difference between the \r\n  doctrines of mutual conflict and self-defense, the Court of Appeals found that \r\n  charging mutual combat to the jury did not destroy Petitionerâ€™s self-defense \r\n  theory because Petitioner still could have proven that he withdrew from \r\n  the fight in good faith.  Graham, 260 S.C. at 451, 196 S.E.2d at 496.   \r\n  This finding, however, fails to recognize that requiring Petitioner to prove \r\n  he withdrew from the fight removes the burden to disprove self-defense from \r\n  the State, and improperly places it on the Petitioner.  \r\nPetitioner admitted to killing Kevin and \r\n  relied entirely on self-defense at trial.  Recently, in State v. Burkhart, \r\n  a majority of this Court found the trial judgeâ€™s failure to properly charge \r\n  the jury on self-defense was prejudicial because self-defense versus murder \r\n  was the sole issue in the case.  350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298 (2002).  Through \r\n  Burkhart and the line of cases preceding it, this Court has placed great \r\n  emphasis on the importance of a defendantâ€™s right to assert self-defense when \r\n  there is â€œany evidenceâ€ to support it, and has taken pains to make sure the \r\n  burden to disprove self-defense remains on the State.  See State v. Addison, \r\n  343 S.C. 290, 540 S.E.2d 449 (2000); State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, \r\n  500 S.E.2d 489 (1998).  \r\nAlthough the court charged self-defense properly \r\n  in Petitionerâ€™s case, that charge was negated by the courtâ€™s unwarranted charge \r\n  on mutual combat.  We find that the courtâ€™s mutual combat charge acted as a \r\n  limitation on the Petitionerâ€™s ability to claim self-defense, and prejudiced \r\n  him by transferring the Stateâ€™s burden to disprove self-defense onto \r\n  the Petitioner, forcing him to prove self-defense in violation of Burkhart, \r\n  Addison, and Wiggins.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE Petitionerâ€™s convictions and REMAND \r\n  for a new trial. [4] \r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate \r\n  opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I agree with the majority that petitioner is entitled \r\n  to a new trial because the evidence did not warrant a charge on the doctrine \r\n  of mutual combat.  I write separately, however, because while I concur in the \r\n  result reached here, and in most of the majorityâ€™s reasoning, I continue to \r\n  believe that we should not place the burden on the State to disprove a claim \r\n  of self-defense.  See State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 265, 565 \r\n  S.E.2d 298, 305 (2002).\r\n BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Murphy neglected to report any of these facts in the signed statement \r\n    he gave to the police on the night Kevin was killed, including his later contention \r\n    that Petitioner had started the fight.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In State v. Graham, the Court quoted 40 C.J.S. Homicide Â§ \r\n    122 for an explanation of the basic principles of mutual combat:  â€œ â€˜Where \r\n    a person voluntarily participates in . . . mutual combat for purposes other \r\n    than protection, he cannot justify or excuse the killing of his adversary \r\n    in the course of such conflict on the ground of self-defense, regardless of \r\n    what extremity or imminent peril he may be reduced to in the progress of the \r\n    combat, unless, before the homicide is committed, he endeavors in good faith \r\n    to decline further conflict, and either by word or act, makes that fact known \r\n    to his adversary, . . .â€™ â€  260 S.C. at 451, 196 S.E.2d at 495-96. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  In the only modern South Carolina case to refer to mutual combat \r\n    in a fist-fight setting, this Court apparently assumed it could apply, but \r\n    held there was no evidence to support it.  Nauful v. Milligan, 258 \r\n    S.C. 139, 187 S.E.2d 511 (1972) (verbal fighting precipitated by injured partyâ€™s \r\n    insult to the defendantâ€™s children, but injured party never made any accompanying \r\n    threat of physical violence and never fought back when defendant became physical).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  We reverse Petitionerâ€™s conviction for Possession of a Firearm or \r\n    Knife during Commission of a Violent Crime in addition to his murder conviction \r\n    because Petitionerâ€™s murder conviction served as the prerequisite violent \r\n    crime for his weapons charge conviction.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490 (2003) \r\n    (stating that the penalties of Â§ 16-23-490 â€œmay not be imposed unless the \r\n    person convicted was at the same time indicted and convicted of a violent \r\n    crimeâ€).  Therefore, without the murder conviction, Petitionerâ€™s conviction \r\n    for violation of Â§ 16-23-490 cannot stand.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25664","title":"Vora v.

Shupe, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: \r\n  Lexington County Medical Center (Hospital) appeals an order of the circuit \r\n  court requiring it to reinstate the privileges of Anant A. Vora, M.D., to practice \r\n  pediatric medicine at its facility.  We reverse.  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn September 1997, Hospitalâ€™s Chief \r\n  of staff, Dr. Givens, advised Dr. Vora that its Medical Executive Committee \r\n  (MEC) had received a  recommendation from the Quality Assessment Committee (QAC) \r\n  to initiate corrective action in regard to Dr. Voraâ€™s clinical privileges.  \r\n  An ad hoc committee was appointed to investigate Dr. Voraâ€™s clinical \r\n  practice and report to the MEC.  In January 1998, the ad hoc committee \r\n  found, after reviewing a number of his cases, that Dr. Vora had 1) a pattern \r\n  of inappropriate hospitalization, stays which could have either been shortened \r\n  or which could have utilized outpatient treatment, 2) use of set protocols inappropriately \r\n  in cases of like diseases, regardless of the degree of impairment, 3) inappropriate \r\n  use of antibiotics and outdated modalities, 4) a pattern of overstating the \r\n  severity of illness, and 5) a missed diagnosis which resulted in unnecessary \r\n  hospitalization and surgical intervention.  Based on these findings, the ad \r\n  hoc Committee recommended Dr. Voraâ€™s clinical privileges be terminated indefinitely, \r\n  and corrective action be taken.  \r\nThe matter was reviewed \r\n  by the MEC, which concluded there had been â€œa continual pattern of clinical \r\n  deficiencies since 1988.â€  Pursuant to Hospitalâ€™s Medical Staff By-Laws, Dr. \r\n  Vora requested and was given a hearing by the Fair Hearing Committee, which \r\n  took place over six separate days with witnesses and evidence.  The Hearing \r\n  Committee found as follows: \r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practitioner utilized \r\n  set protocols inappropriately in the management of all cases involving like \r\n  diseases or illnesses, regardless of the degree of severity of the individual \r\n  patientâ€™s condition or the patientâ€™s response to early therapy.\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practitioner frequently \r\n  demonstrated the inappropriate use of antibiotics and outdated treatment modalities.\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practitioner demonstrated \r\n  a pattern of overstating the severity of illness not confirmed by laboratory \r\n  tests or other objective data in the medical record.\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case number 13, \r\n  the Practitioner demonstrated a departure from generally accepted standards \r\n  of care which created the potential for significant risk to the patient.\r\n  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Practitioner has \r\n  demonstrated unprofessional interaction with colleagues and staff on a recurring \r\n  basis. [1]   \r\n\r\nBased on these findings, the \r\n  Fair Hearing Committee recommended Dr. Voraâ€™s staff privileges be temporarily \r\n  suspended until completion of certain corrective measures.  The MEC upheld the \r\n  findings of the Fair Hearing Committee, and imposed a temporary suspension while \r\n  corrective measures were undertaken, to be accomplished within 18 months.  Dr. \r\n  Vora sought an appellate review of the MECâ€™s findings, which was conducted by \r\n  a committee (the Appellate Review Board) of the Board of Directors of Lexington \r\n  Medical Center on April 19, 1999.  On May 27, 1999, the Appellate Review Committee \r\n  issued its report, recommending the action taken by the MEC be affirmed.  The \r\n  Board of Directors thereafter issued its final decision unanimously adopting \r\n  the Report of the Appellate Committee.  Dr. Vora appealed the final decision \r\n  of the Board to the circuit court, which reversed the Boardâ€™s decision, finding \r\n  certain procedures employed by Hospitalâ€™s various panels, boards and committees \r\n  deprived Dr. Vora of due process; the court ordered Dr. Voraâ€™s privileges be \r\n  reinstated.  Hospital appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1)    Did the circuit court err in ruling Dr. Voraâ€™s due process rights \r\n  had been violated?\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the circuit court have reversed \r\n  on the ground that the disciplinary action taken by the Hospital was not supported \r\n  by the evidence?\r\n\r\n1.  DUE PROCESS\r\nA physician's interest \r\n  in being reappointed to a hospital staff is a property interest which may not \r\n  be denied without compliance with the procedural and substantive due process \r\n  requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Huellmantel v. Greenville Hosp. \r\n  System, 303 S.C. 549, 402 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 1991), citing In \r\n  Re:  Zaman, 285 S.C. 345, 329 S.E.2d 436 (1985).  Procedural due process \r\n  requirements are not technical;  no particular form of procedure is necessary.  \r\n  Id.  The United States Supreme Court has held, however, that at a minimum \r\n  certain elements must be present.  These include (1) adequate notice;  (2) adequate \r\n  opportunity for a hearing;  (3) the right to introduce evidence;  and (4) the \r\n  right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.  We find these criteria were \r\n  amply met in this case.\r\nThe circuit court found \r\n  a violation of Dr. Voraâ€™s due process rights for several reasons.  It found \r\n  a) Hospital had imposed an unreasonable burden of proof on Dr. Vora, b) Dr. \r\n  Vora was denied the right to voir dire members of the Fair Hearing Panel, \r\n  and c) he was denied the right to meaningfully cross-examine one of the Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  witnesses.  We hold these deprivations do not rise to the level of a due process \r\n  violation. [2]   \r\n  a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burden of Proof  \r\n\r\nThe burden of proof set forth in Hospitalâ€™s Fair Hearing Plan states:\r\nWhen a hearing relates to Section \r\n  2.1(a), (e), (h) or (i), [3]  the practitioner who requested \r\n  the hearing shall have the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, \r\n  that the adverse recommendation or action lacks any factual basis, or that such \r\n  basis or the conclusions therefrom are either arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.  \r\n  Otherwise, the body whose adverse recommendation or action occasioned the \r\n  hearing shall [4]  thereafter be responsible for supporting his challenge to the \r\n  adverse recommendation for action by clear and convincing evidence that \r\n  such basis or conclusions drawn therefrom are either arbitrary, unreasonable, \r\n  or capricious.\r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).  The circuit \r\n  court found the burden of proof set forth in the Fair Hearing Plan â€œplainly \r\n  ambiguous, unintelligible, arbitrary, capricious, and therefore violated due \r\n  process requirements of notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.â€  It \r\n  then found it â€œmanifestly clear that [Hospital] has imposed an unreasonable \r\n  burden of proof on [Dr. Vora], such that the decision of the Board of Directors \r\n  must be reversed.â€  Contrary to the circuit courtâ€™s finding, the evidence simply \r\n  does not demonstrate that the Hospital placed an unreasonable burden of proof \r\n  on Dr. Vora.  \r\nThe Appellate Review Committee, in reviewing the MECâ€™s imposition of sanctions \r\n  against Vora, stated that â€œIn all fairness to the Practitioner, this committee \r\n  has reviewed the record before the hearing committee by imposing the same \r\n  standard of proof, i.e., by clear and convincing evidence, upon the MEC, \r\n  even though this is not strictly required by . . . the Fair Hearing Plan.â€  \r\n  (Emphasis supplied).  Given the complete and independent review by the Appellate \r\n  Review Committee, we find any alleged inappropriate burden at earlier stages \r\n  was harmless.  Cf. Ross v. Medical University of South Carolina, \r\n  328 S.C. 51, 492 S.E.2d 62 (1997) (procedural errors in  review process of terminated \r\n  faculty rendered harmless in light of subsequent independent review).  See \r\n  also  Schaper v. City of Huntsville, 813 F.2d 709 (5th Cir.1987) \r\n  (alleged conspiracy at pretermination procedure did not violate due process \r\n  rights where employee had right to appeal termination);  Davis v. Mann, \r\n  721 F.Supp. 796 (S.D.Miss.1988) (where there is an adequate appeal process, \r\n  bias on part of initial decision maker is not denial of procedural due process).  \r\n  The circuit court erred in finding the burden imposed upon Dr. Vora resulted \r\n  in a due process violation. [5]   \r\nb. Voir Dire \r\n  of Panel Members\r\nThe circuit court also \r\n  held Dr. Vora was denied due process by the trial courtâ€™s refusal to ask members \r\n  of the Fair Hearing Panel whether they had been represented by the prosecuting \r\n  attorney.  We do not find this deprived Dr. Vora of due process.  \r\nDr. Vora was advised \r\n  in advance as to the names of the physicians who had been appointed to the Hearing \r\n  Committee.  Dr. Vora objected and had one panel member, Dr. Mubarek, removed \r\n  from the panel. [6]   \r\nAt the hearing, Dr. \r\n  Vora sought to inquire as to whether any panel member had any relationship with \r\n  Hospitalâ€™s attorney, Attorney Nauful.  Although the Hearing Officer would not \r\n  allow Dr. Voraâ€™s counsel to pose this specific question, the officer did ask \r\n  at the outset whether â€œany member of the five member panel know[s] of any reason \r\n  why they would be biased or prejudiced in any way so as to be unable to render \r\n  a fair hearing to the physician in this matter?â€  No member of the panel responded.\r\nThe parties liken the \r\n  situation to voir dire of a jury panel.  As noted by the Court in Thompson \r\n  v. Oâ€™Rourke, 288 S.C. 13, 14, 339 S.E.2d 505, 506 (1986), a party seeking \r\n  a new trial based upon the disqualification of a juror must show: (1) the fact \r\n  of disqualification; (2) the grounds for disqualification were unknown prior \r\n  to verdict; and (3) the moving party was not negligent in failing to learn of \r\n  the disqualification before verdict.  We recognized in Thompson, that \r\n  â€œthere is no absolute rule of disqualification based on a juror's relationship \r\n  to an attorney in the case.â€  288 S.C. at 15, 339 S.E.2d at 506.  \r\nDr. Vora has presented no evidence that any of the panel members had any \r\n  relationship with Hospitalâ€™s attorney, let alone that any possible relationship \r\n  would have disqualified them.  There is simply no evidence in the record any \r\n  of the panel members had any relationship with Hospitalâ€™s attorney, or that, \r\n  even if they did, they were somehow prejudiced against Dr. Vora.  We find the \r\n  trial court erred in finding a due process violation in the hearing officerâ€™s \r\n  refusal to further query the panel members.  See Gray v. Maynard, \r\n  349 S.C. 535, 564 S.E.2d 83 (2002)(recognizing that this Court has repeatedly \r\n  acknowledged that peremptory strikes implicate no constitutional right).\r\nMoreover, under this \r\n  Courtâ€™s opinion in Ross, supra, even if there were a due process \r\n  problem with the panel at the Fair Hearing Panel level, any error was harmless \r\n  in light of the subsequent independent review by the Appellate Review Committee \r\n  and the Board of Directors, the composition of which has not been challenged \r\n  by Dr. Vora.    \r\nc.  Denial of Cross-Examination\r\nAt the circuit court hearing, Dr. Vora asserted he was denied the right \r\n  to effective cross-examination of a witness, Nurse Melinda Cassell, at her deposition.  \r\n  We disagree.  Contrary to the trial courtâ€™s ruling, we do not believe the fairness \r\n  of Dr. Voraâ€™s hearings was undermined by the examination of Nurse Cassell.\r\nCase # 13 involved a two-month old infant brought to the emergency room.  \r\n  Nurses felt the infant needed to be transferred to a pediatric intensive care \r\n  unit, which was not available at Lexington Medical Center; [7]   Dr. Vora did not come to the hospital to see \r\n  the infant for almost 12 hours after being advised of the babyâ€™s condition and \r\n  abnormal lab tests.  When nurses advised the Chief of Pediatrics, Dr. Reynolds, \r\n  of their concerns, Dr. Reynolds ordered Dr. Vora relieved from the patientâ€™s \r\n  care.  Dr. Vora continued ordering lab work for the infant, delaying the infantâ€™s \r\n  transfer to the pediatric ICU at Palmetto Richland Hospital.  \r\nDuring Nurse Cassellâ€™s deposition on June 19, 1998, counsel for Dr. Vora, \r\n  Attorney Henshaw, questioned her as to whether or not she had gone back and \r\n  reviewed the medical records of the incident, to which she replied affirmatively.  \r\n  He then asked her if she had written a note to herself after the incident, to \r\n  which she responded, â€œNo.â€  Henshaw then asked whether at any time after \r\n  the incident she had written a note, to which she responded that she had, but \r\n  did not know where it had gone.  Thereafter, Cassell refused to disclose the \r\n  substance of the notes she had written after reviewing the record or where they \r\n  had gone.  Hospitalâ€™s attorney, Nauful, stated he wanted to put it on the record \r\n  that Nurse Cassell â€œreviewed the chart, made notes in preparation for two \r\n  meetings with me.  She is not using them presently to refresh her recollection; \r\n  sheâ€™s not using them for any other purpose.  I donâ€™t believe youâ€™re entitled \r\n  to them, and Iâ€™m not going to let you ask her any more questions about it.â€  \r\n  (Emphasis supplied).  Attorney Nauful then instructed Cassell not to answer \r\n  any questions about the matter.  However, Nurse Cassell did ultimately reply \r\n  that she had not written any more notes other than the notes she was referring \r\n  to in regard to her meeting with Mr. Nauful.  \r\nSubsequent to the above exchange, the record reflects that there was  \r\n  a recess in order for the witness to take a phone call.  Thereafter, it was \r\n  revealed that Cassell had consulted with her personal attorney during the recess.  \r\n  Dr. Vora asserts that Nurse Cassellâ€™s refusal to testify concerning the substance \r\n  of the notes made in preparation for her meeting with attorney Nauful, and her \r\n  consultation with her attorney during the recess, deprived him of due process.  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nWe recently recognized, \r\n\r\nWhere important decisions turn \r\n  on questions of fact, due process often requires an opportunity to confront \r\n  and cross-examine adverse witnesses.  Brown v. South Carolina State Bd. of \r\n  Educ., 301 S.C. 326, 329, 391 S.E.2d 866, 867 (1990) citing Goldberg \r\n  v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.E.2d 287 (1970); see \r\n  South Carolina Dep't of Social Serv. v. Holden, 319 S.C. 72, 459 S.E.2d \r\n  846 (1995) (right to confrontation applies in civil context).  Confrontation \r\n  includes the right to be physically present during the presentation of testimony.  \r\n  See State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001).  Due process \r\n  is not violated where a party is not given the opportunity to confront witnesses \r\n  so long as there has been a meaningful opportunity to be heard.  \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Social \r\n  Services v. Wilson, 352 S.C. 445, 452, 574 S.E.2d 730, 734 (2002) (emphasis \r\n  supplied).\r\nHere, Dr. Vora was \r\n  allowed to confront and cross examine Cassell and was given a meaningful opportunity \r\n  to be heard.  The fact that he was unable to ascertain the substance of the \r\n  notes she made in preparation for her consultation with Attorney Nauful, or \r\n  the nature of her conversation with her attorney, \r\n  [8]  is simply not such a deprivation as to amount to a due process violation.  \r\n\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD  \r\nAs an additional sustaining ground, Dr. Vora asserts that the Hospitalâ€™s \r\n  suspension of his privileges was not supported by the evidence such that this \r\n  Court should therefore affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order under Iâ€™On v. Town \r\n  of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000)(court can affirm for \r\n  any reason appearing in the record).  We disagree.  \r\nHospital presented the testimony of an independent expert, Dr. Derrick, \r\n  as to the deviations from the standard of care in each of the cases.  Given \r\n  this evidence supporting Hospitalâ€™s decision, we simply cannot say that itâ€™s \r\n  decision to impose corrective actions and clinical suspension of his privileges \r\n  were arbitrary and unreasonable.  Huellmantel, supra, (Substantive \r\n  due process requires only that a public hospital not exclude a physician from \r\n  practice therein by rules or acts which are unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious \r\n  or discriminatory).  Contrary to Dr. Voraâ€™s assertions, we find evidence supporting \r\n  Hospitalâ€™s decision.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAfter a thorough review of the record, we are convinced that Dr. Vora \r\n  was not deprived of due process.  Dr. Voraâ€™s conduct was first assessed by a \r\n  Quality Assurance Committee, which referred the matter to an Ad Hoc Committee \r\n  appointed by Hospitalâ€™s Chief of Staff.  After the Ad Hoc Committee found deviations \r\n  from the standard of care, the matter was reviewed by the Medical Executive \r\n  Committee which concurred in the recommended corrective actions.  Dr. Vora was \r\n  then afforded a Fair Hearing, at which, over six occasions, he was allowed to \r\n  present testimony and examine witnesses.  The Fair Hearing Committee found numerous \r\n  problems and recommended corrective action,  and these findings were reviewed \r\n  and upheld by the Medical Executive Committee.  Thereafter, Dr. Vora was afforded \r\n  a hearing before the Appellate Review Committee, after which that committee \r\n  upheld the action taken by the MEC.  The Appellate Review Committeeâ€™s action \r\n  was reviewed by Hospitalâ€™s Board of Directors, which adopted the findings therein.  \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous â€œprocedural irregularitiesâ€ asserted by Dr. \r\n  Vora, we find he was accorded all the process to which he was entitled, and \r\n  the Hospitalâ€™s actions were not arbitrary or capricious.  Huellmantel v. \r\n  Greenville Hosp. System, supra (court will not review hospital's \r\n  administrative decision if physician has been granted procedural due process \r\n  and hospital has not acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner). \r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s order is reversed, and the \r\n  Hospitalâ€™s decision is reinstated.\r\nREVERSED.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice \r\n  Edward W. Miller, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   The appellate review committee found no evidence \r\n    of unprofessional interaction on a recurring basis.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   Although the circuit court also enumerated several \r\n    â€œprocedural irregularitiesâ€ in the background section of its order, those \r\n    irregularities did not form the basis of its finding of a due process violation.  \r\n    Accordingly, we do not address them here.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]    These sections do not apply to this case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]    The 1998 version of the Fair Hearing Plan inserted \r\n    the following 14 words after shall: â€œhave the initial obligation to present \r\n    evidence in support therefore, but the practitioner shall. . .â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [5]    Although we find no due process violation in \r\n    the instant case, for the benefit of bench and bar, we address the issue of \r\n    the appropriate burden of proof in medical privilege cases.  In Anonymous \r\n    v. State Board of Medical Examiners, 329 S.C. 371, 496 S.E.2d 17 (1998), \r\n    we held the correct standard of proof in  medical disciplinary proceedings \r\n    under the Administrative Procedures Act was not â€œclear and convincingâ€ but, \r\n    rather, â€œa preponderance of the evidence.â€  Although this is not an APA case, \r\n    we nonetheless find this standard appropriate in suspension or revocation \r\n    of medical privileges cases.  As the ARC applied the higher standard upon \r\n    the MEC in this case, there is no need for a remand for application of the \r\n    lesser standard. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]    The Hospitalâ€™s Fair Hearing Plan provides that \r\n    direct competition with the charged party will serve to disqualify committee \r\n    members.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]    Nurse Cassell was \r\n    the nursing supervisor on duty when case # 13 arose.  She testified at her \r\n    deposition she had gotten a phone call from the nurse on duty, Peggy Craven, \r\n    that the infant was â€œsick, lethargic, difficult to arouse and that it was \r\n    in the best interest of the child to be transferred to Richland.â€  Nurse Cassell \r\n    went to see the infant and concurred with Nurse Craven.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]    These matters would, in any event, be protected \r\n    by the attorney/client privilege.  See State v. Love, 275 S.C. \r\n    55, 271 S.E.2d 110 (1980) (attorney-client privilege protects against disclosure \r\n    of confidential communications by client to attorney).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25665","title":"SCDSS v.

Kelly, of Summerville, for Guardian Ad\r\nLitem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE \r\n  TOAL: Robin Headden (â€œMotherâ€) appeals from the family courtâ€™s termination \r\n  of her parental rights to her daughter, (â€œChildâ€). [1]   \r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nThe Child was taken into emergency protective \r\n  custody by law enforcement on June 23, 1996, when she was 8 years old.  The \r\n  police arrived at the Motherâ€™s trailer and observed the Mother intoxicated and \r\n  throwing clothes and other items out of the house through a door and a broken \r\n  window.  Mother testified that she was throwing out her roommateâ€™s belongings \r\n  because her roommate had failed to pay rent or bills for several months, and \r\n  that she broke the window accidentally in the process.  The Mother was also \r\n  accused of destroying furniture with a knife, but she denied cutting the furniture \r\n  and blamed this on her ex-boyfriend.  When the police arrived, the Child returned \r\n  home from a neighborâ€™s house and was taken into protective custody based on \r\n  threat of harm.  Custody of the Child was transferred to Respondent, South Carolina \r\n  Department of Social Services (â€œDSSâ€).\r\nThe family court found probable cause \r\n  existed for the Childâ€™s removal at the 10 day hearing on July 2, 1996, and ordered \r\n  that she remain in DSSâ€™s custody.  The family court held a merits hearing on \r\n  September 18, 1996, and found that the Child was physically neglected as defined \r\n  by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490, ordered the Child remain in DSSâ€™s custody, and \r\n  adopted a treatment plan for the Mother. \r\n  [2]   From June of 1996 through December 1996, the Mother coordinated visitation \r\n  with the Child through DSS.  A Judicial Review hearing was held on December \r\n  19, 1996.  In addition to holding that all previous orders remained in full \r\n  force and effect, the court ordered the Mother to pay child support in the amount \r\n  of $51.50 per month beginning January 1, 1997.  In December, the Mother decided \r\n  to move to Memphis, Tennessee, apparently after receiving a job offer there \r\n  and after speaking with the Childâ€™s DSS case manager at the time, Susan Kellar. [3]   \r\nThe Mother arrived in Memphis on a Greyhound bus \r\n  on Christmas Day 1996, but did not begin working at her intended job until April \r\n  of 1997, apparently due to delays in construction.  From January to April, the \r\n  Mother testified she held several temporary jobs.  The Mother testified that \r\n  she had difficulty locating the appropriate agencies in Tennessee that could \r\n  assist her in completing her treatment plan, and went through a period of heavy \r\n  drug and alcohol use beginning in late June 1997.  She testified that she was \r\n  spending as much as $600 per week on drugs (crack cocaine) in July 1997.  On \r\n  August 12, 1997, the Mother entered Grace House, an in-patient drug and alcohol \r\n  rehabilitation center in Memphis.  The Mother remained at Grace House until \r\n  she successfully completed the program in February 1998.\r\nAlthough the Mother was making child support payments \r\n  through May 1997, she ceased making payments in June 1997 and did not resume \r\n  payments until April 1998.  The Mother claims she believed her parental rights \r\n  were terminated in the Fall of 1997, and regardless that she could not pay support \r\n  while living at Grace House because she was not allowed to work.  She based \r\n  her belief that her parental rights had been terminated on the Order for Permanency \r\n  Planning she received in September 1997 and on a subsequent comment by her attorneyâ€™s \r\n  receptionist that her attorney was no longer involved in the case.  All of this \r\n  occurred while Mother was a patient at Grace House and could not travel to South \r\n  Carolina.  The Mother claims she made numerous calls to DSS that were not returned \r\n  during this time.  However, the DSS case manager assigned to the Child, Romona \r\n  Keitt, testified that the Mother called her from Grace House once in December \r\n  1997. [4]   \r\nMs. Keitt stated that she and the Mother spoke \r\n  about sending Christmas presents to the Child and that the Mother gave her a \r\n  new mailing address on Candlelight Drive in Tennessee.  The Mother did not give \r\n  Ms. Keitt the address at Grace House, but she did tell Ms. Keitt that she was \r\n  in a full-time treatment center.  Ms. Keitt testified that the next call she \r\n  received from the Mother was in September of 1999, 18 months later.  In the \r\n  intervening months, Ms. Keitt testified that she sent certified letters to the \r\n  Mother at Candlelight Drive address the Mother gave her, but that the letters \r\n  were returned to her. [5] \r\nAfter completion of the \r\n  program at Grace House, the Mother moved to Arkansas temporarily for work on \r\n  a construction project and then returned to Memphis.  The Mother made several \r\n  child support payments beginning in April 1998, but ceased payments again in \r\n  July 1998 until October 1999, 16 months later, when she was served with notice \r\n  that DSS was pursuing termination of her parental rights (â€œTPRâ€). \r\nThe Family Court appointed counsel to represent \r\n  Mother in the TPR action upon Motherâ€™s request.  DSS voluntarily non-suited \r\n  its case due to defects in pleadings and service in June 2000.  Before DSS re-filed, \r\n  the Motherâ€™s motion for visitation, to be supervised by the Childâ€™s therapist, \r\n  was granted.  The Childâ€™s therapist, Dr. McClain, refused to participate and \r\n  the Mother was forced to locate another professional to determine whether visitation \r\n  would be in the best interest of the child.  Dr. Geddes at MUSC performed an \r\n  evaluation of the Mother and the Child and recommended that supervised visitation \r\n  be allowed.  DSS refused to allow Dr. Geddes to supervise.  After filing a Rule \r\n  to Show Cause, the Mother was permitted visitation with the Child supervised \r\n  by Dr. McClain. [6] \r\nThe TPR hearing took place on November 28 and 29 \r\n  of 2000.  The family court granted TPR based on willful failure to support, \r\n  willful failure to visit, and because the Child had been in foster care for \r\n  15 of the most recent 22 months, all pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 \r\n  (Supp. 2000).  The Mother raises the following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the Family Court err in finding that clear and convincing evidence supported \r\n  the finding that the Mother willfully failed to visit and support the Child \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) and (4) (Supp. 2000)? \r\nII.      Is TPR justified based solely on a finding \r\n  that a child has been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2000)?\r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\nThe Motherâ€™s parental rights were terminated \r\n  pursuant to three different statutory grounds.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3), \r\n  (4), and (8). [7] \r\nThe South Carolina Code mandates that the TPR statutes \r\n  â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for \r\n  freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating \r\n  the parent-child relationship.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2000); see \r\n  Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000) (overruling prior cases \r\n  calling for strict construction of the TPR statutes).  In addition, â€œ[t]he interests \r\n  of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578.  Grounds for termination of parental rights must \r\n  be proven by clear and convincing evidence.  Santosky v. Kramer, 455 \r\n  U.S. 745, 102 S. Ct 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982); Richland County DSS v. \r\n  Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 496 S.E.2d 864 (1998).  \r\nUpon review, the appellate court may make its own \r\n  finding from the record as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports \r\n  the termination.  South Carolina DSS v. Brown, 317 S.C. 332, 454 S.E.2d \r\n  335 (Ct. App. 1995).  The reviewing court, however, is not required â€œto ignore \r\n  the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their \r\n  testimony.â€  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 \r\n  (1999).  \r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  &nbsp; \r\nThe Mother argues that \r\n  the family court erred in finding that DSS had proven by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence that she willfully failed to visit and support the Child as defined \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) and (4).  We disagree.\r\nA.  \r\n  Failure to Visit\r\nThe family court may order \r\n  TPR upon a finding of one of several statutory grounds and a finding \r\n  that termination would be in the best interest of the child.  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2000).  Section 20-7-1572(3) provides that the family court \r\n  may terminate if it is in the best interest of the child and if \r\n\r\n[t]he child has lived outside \r\n  the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the \r\n  parent has wilfully failed to visit the child.  The Court may attach \r\n  little or no weight to incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the \r\n  parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having custody or by court \r\n  order.  The distance of the childâ€™s placement from the parentâ€™s home must be \r\n  taken into consideration when determining the ability to visit.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) \r\n  (emphasis added).    \r\nIt is undisputed that the \r\n  Child has â€œlived outside the home of either parentâ€ for much longer than six \r\n  months as she has been in DSSâ€™s custody since June 1996. \r\n  [8]   The question before the family court then was whether the Motherâ€™s \r\n  failure to visit the Child between 1996 and 2000 was wilful. \r\nWhether a parentâ€™s failure \r\n  to visit is â€œwilfulâ€ is a question of intent to be determined from the facts \r\n  and circumstances of each individual case.  SCDSS v. Broome, 307 S.C. \r\n  48, 413 S.E.2d 835 (1992).  â€œParental conduct which evinces a settled purpose \r\n  to forego parental duties may be characterized as â€˜wilfulâ€™ because it manifests \r\n  a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium \r\n  from the parent.â€  Broome, 307 S.C. at 53, 413 S.E.2d at 838. The trial \r\n  judge is given wide discretion in making this determination.  Id.\r\nAs discussed, the Child \r\n  in this case was removed from the Motherâ€™s home in June 1996.  The record indicates \r\n  that Mother visited the Child from June until November or December 1996. [9]   On Christmas Day 1996, the Mother \r\n  moved to Memphis, Tennessee without making much, if any, progress on her treatment \r\n  plan.  The Mother lived in Memphis for seven full months before entering Grace \r\n  House.  The record reflects that the Mother sent only one letter, in February \r\n  1997, to the Child during this time.  There is no indication that the Mother \r\n  attempted to call the Child or otherwise stay in touch with her.  The Mother \r\n  did travel back to South Carolina for a hearing in June 1997.  The hearing was \r\n  continued and the Mother claims she was denied visitation when she returned \r\n  for that hearing.\r\nThe Motherâ€™s visitation \r\n  was officially terminated in the Order for Permanency Planning issued following \r\n  a hearing in September 1997, which the Mother was unable to attend because she \r\n  was living at Grace House.  This Order states that Mother had failed to complete \r\n  any of her treatment plan, had moved to Tennessee, and had not returned to visit \r\n  the Child.  When Mother was released from Grace House upon successful \r\n  completion of the program in February 1998, she did not contact DSS or her Child.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the Mother did \r\n  return to South Carolina and sought reinstatement of visitation rights after \r\n  she received the notice of TPR in the Fall of 1999, her action came too late.  \r\n  The family court is not limited to considering the months immediately preceding \r\n  TPR in determining whether a parent has wilfully failed to visit.  See Abercrombie \r\n  v. LaBoon, 290 S.C. 35, 248 S.E.2d 170 (1986).  To the contrary, â€œ[t]he \r\n  family court may consider all relevant conduct by the parent.â€  Id. at \r\n  37, 348 S.E.2d at 171.\r\nAlthough the Mother frames \r\n  her move to Memphis as â€œrequiredâ€ by her job, we find no support for this characterization \r\n  of her decision to move.  She did have a job opportunity in Memphis, but it \r\n  is clear from the Motherâ€™s own testimony that she moved to get away from her \r\n  old friends and family that she perceived to be a negative force in her life.  \r\n  Although the Mother may have had good intentions in moving, she made little \r\n  effort to keep in touch with her daughter once she moved.  The job she moved \r\n  for did not materialize until April, and Mother admits she began using drugs \r\n  in addition to drinking heavily after she moved to Memphis.  \r\nThe family court is required \r\n  to take the distance between mother and child into consideration.  The distance \r\n  between Mother and Child in this case was by the Motherâ€™s own making, and the \r\n  Mother made little to no effort to maintain a relationship with the Child with \r\n  letters or phone calls when physical visits were not possible.  See Leone \r\n  v. Dilullo, 294 S.C. 410, 365 S.E.2d 39 (Ct. App. 1988) (affirming TPR for \r\n  failure to visit when mother lived in Connecticut and children lived in SC despite \r\n  motherâ€™s poor financial circumstances in part because the mother made no effort \r\n  to communicate by mail or phone).  In our opinion, this amounts to â€œa settled \r\n  purpose to forego parental dutiesâ€ under Broome and Leone.  Failure \r\n  to follow a court-ordered treatment plan can result in termination of visitation \r\n  rights, as it did in this case.  As such, although the Mother eventually sought \r\n  and successfully completed treatment, her failure to do so within a reasonable \r\n  time is further evidence of her wilful failure to visit - of her intent to â€œforego \r\n  parental duties.â€ \r\nB.  Failure to Support\r\nPursuant to Â§ 20-7-1572(4), the \r\n  family court may order the termination of parental rights if \r\n\r\nthe child has lived outside of the home of either parent \r\n  for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully \r\n  failed to support the child.  Failure to support means that the parent has failed \r\n  to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care.  A material contribution \r\n  consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or \r\n  contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care \r\n  of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.  The court may consider all relevant \r\n  circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to \r\n  support  the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the \r\n  ability of the parent to provide the support.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2000) (emphasis \r\n  added).  Just as it does in determining wilful failure to visit, the family \r\n  court has wide discretion in determining whether a failure to support is wilful.  \r\n  Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 413 S.E.2d 835.\r\nIn this case, Mother \r\n  made some child support payments after she was initially ordered to pay child \r\n  support beginning January 1, 1997.  Mother stopped making payments in April \r\n  1997.  She entered Grace House in August 1997, and resided there without working \r\n  until February 1998.  When Mother was released from Grace House, she resumed \r\n  support payments until June 1998, after which Mother inexplicably quit making \r\n  any support payments for the next 16 months.  Mother claims that she believed \r\n  her parental rights had been terminated, but this is inconsistent with her temporary \r\n  resumption of payments in February 1998, and with her claims that she tried \r\n  to reach DSS, specifically, Ms. Kellar, during this time.  Further, Mother called \r\n  the Childâ€™s current case manager, Ms. Keitt, in December 1997, and, presumably, \r\n  could have found her number again to check on her Childâ€™s status.\r\nAlthough Mother had \r\n  caught up with her support payments by the time of the TPR hearing, the family \r\n  court is able to look beyond the months immediately preceding the TPR action \r\n  at the Motherâ€™s overall conduct.  Based on the above facts, there was \r\n  clear and convincing evidence to support the family courtâ€™s finding of willful \r\n  failure to support.\r\nAdditionally, the family \r\n  court found that TPR was in the Childâ€™s best interest.  We agree.  As this Court \r\n  noted in Joiner, the purpose of the TPR statute is\r\n\r\nto establish procedures for reasonable \r\n  and compassionate termination of parental rights . . . to protect the health \r\n  and welfare of these children and make them eligible for adoption by persons \r\n  who will provide a suitable home environment and the love and care necessary \r\n  for a happy, healthful, and productive life.\r\n\r\nJoiner, 536 S.C. at 108, \r\n  536 S.E.2d at 375 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560 (Supp. 2000)).   To that \r\n  end, â€œthe interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the \r\n  parental rights conflict.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578.   \r\nIn this case, the Child has now \r\n  been in custody since June 1996, for nearly seven years.  The Child had emotional \r\n  and behavioral problems which caused her placement to be difficult and which \r\n  continue to pose placement challenges for her.  At the time of the hearing in \r\n  November 2000, the Child had lived with the same foster parents since March \r\n  1998.  The Child expressed to her therapist, Dr. McClain, and to the family \r\n  court judge that she wants her motherâ€™s rights to be terminated so she will \r\n  be available for adoption.  Additionally, Dr. McClain believes TPR is in the \r\n  Childâ€™s best interest.  Based on these facts, we find termination is in the \r\n  Childâ€™s best interest. \r\nII.\r\nMother claims that termination of parental \r\n  rights is not justified based solely on a finding that the Child has been in \r\n  foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8).  \r\n  As we have found clear and convincing evidence exists to affirm TPR based on \r\n  willful failure to visit and support, we decline to address this issue.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM \r\n  AS MODIFIED the family courtâ€™s termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights based \r\n  on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) &amp; (4), and decline to address termination \r\n  under section 20-7-1572(8).\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur.  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The Childâ€™s father did not contest the termination \r\n    of his parental rights.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The treatment plan called for the Mother (1) to receive a mental \r\n    health evaluation and to enroll in out-patient counseling, (2) to complete \r\n    a Parent Effectiveness Training program, (3) to participate in anger management \r\n    counseling, (4) to complete a psychological evaluation, (5) to receive an \r\n    alcohol and drug assessment and follow recommendations made in that assessment, \r\n    and, finally, (5) to secure and maintain appropriate housing.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The Mother testified that she was having difficulty holding a good \r\n    job in Berkeley County while trying to complete her treatment plan, and was \r\n    offered a construction job working on a project in Memphis being paid around \r\n    $8.00/hour.  When the Mother left for Memphis, she had not completed any of \r\n    the requirements of her treatment plan, but  Mother claims Ms. Kellar encouraged \r\n    her to move to Memphis. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Ms. Keitt was appointed as the Childâ€™s case manager in October 1997, \r\n    after the Motherâ€™s visitation was terminated for failure to complete her treatment \r\n    plan in September 1997. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  When the Mother called Ms. Keitt in September 1999, Ms. Keitt asked \r\n    her why she had not been in touch since December 1997.  The Mother responded \r\n    that she could not pick up the certified letters from the post office because \r\n    her wallet and I.D. card had been stolen, and that she had tried calling Ms. \r\n    Kellar, the former case manager.  Ms. Keitt testified that any correspondence \r\n    sent to Ms. Kellar would have been forwarded to her as the case manager of \r\n    record since October 1997.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  At the time of the TPR hearing, the Mother had only had one supervised \r\n    visit with the Child, and the Child (then 12 years old) expressed that she \r\n    did not want to see the Mother again.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  DSS claims that the family court based TPR on the Motherâ€™s failure \r\n    to remedy the conditions which caused the removal under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2). \r\n    The Mother refutes that the court made this finding, and we cannot find any \r\n    direct reference to it in the final TPR order.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  The Child had been in DSSâ€™ custody for four and a half years at the \r\n    time of the TPR hearing.  Currently, the Child has been living away from the \r\n    Mother for almost seven years.  She was 8 when she was taken into protective \r\n    custody and will have her 15th birthday on June 20, 2003.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  The Mother testified that Ms. Kellar advised her she could not visit \r\n    her Child any more in November 1996.  However, there is no record of such \r\n    a statement in DSSâ€™s file and no order to that effect in the record. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25666","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of South Carolina \r\n  Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:  We granted \r\n  the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion in State v. Foster, Op. No. 2001-UP-321 (Ct. App. filed Feb. \r\n  6, 2001).  We affirm.\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent Randall Scott Foster was indicted \r\n  for murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.  \r\n  The victim was his wife, Marilyn, who died from a single gunshot wound to her \r\n  head.  At trial, the jury was instructed on self-defense, accident, involuntary \r\n  manslaughter, voluntary manslaughter and murder.  The jury convicted Foster \r\n  of voluntary manslaughter and the weapon charge, and the trial court sentenced \r\n  him to twenty years and five years, concurrent.  In an unpublished decision, \r\n  the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial.  State v. Foster, \r\n  supra.\r\nFoster and Marilyn lived in their Prosperity \r\n  home with Marilynâ€™s three children and Fosterâ€™s daughter.  On Saturday night, \r\n  April 25, 1998, Foster and Marilyn went out drinking and dancing.  They returned \r\n  home sometime after two a.m. on April 26.  Very shortly thereafter, Marilyn \r\n  was fatally shot.\r\nThe testimony at trial as to exactly what transpired \r\n  was conflicting.  Marilynâ€™s son, Steven, and her daughter, Michelle, both testified \r\n  for the State.  Steven said he was sleeping on the couch when he was awakened \r\n  by Foster and Marilyn arguing.  He heard Marilyn say, â€œAre you going to shoot \r\n  me?,â€ Foster say â€œyes,â€ and the gun go off.  On cross&#8209;examination, Steven \r\n  was questioned about a statement he made to police on the day of the shooting \r\n  that he heard Foster ask Marilyn if she was going to shoot him.  Steven responded \r\n  he was in shock and unsure of what he said.  On redirect, the State published \r\n  Stevenâ€™s entire statement.  According to Stevenâ€™s statement, Marilyn got her \r\n  gun, told Foster â€œto get out,â€ and Foster asked if she was going to shoot him.  \r\n  Then, Foster and Marilyn â€œstarted fighting over the gun,â€ and after Michelle \r\n  walked into the room, the gun went off.\r\nMichelle, Marilynâ€™s oldest child at age 14, testified \r\n  that she witnessed the shooting.  Michelle was also awakened by the coupleâ€™s \r\n  argument.  She followed Foster into the bedroom where Marilyn was undressing.  \r\n  According to Michelle, Marilyn was by the dresser and â€œhad the gun out.â€ \r\n  [1]   Foster asked Marilyn if she was going to shoot him and then took the \r\n  gun away from her.  Marilyn asked â€œAre you going to shoot me now?â€  Foster replied \r\n  yes, raised the gun to her head, and shot her.  Michelle testified there was \r\n  no scuffle over the gun. \r\nAccording to Foster, who testified in his own defense, \r\n  he and Marilyn enjoyed a normal evening out, drinking, [2]  dancing, and socializing with friends.  They \r\n  began arguing during the car ride home because Marilyn was angry Foster had \r\n  danced and flirted too much with their friend, Linda.  After entering the house, \r\n  Marilyn told him to get his daughter and leave.  He said no and wanted to go \r\n  to bed.  Marilyn replied, â€œWell, I have something that will make you leaveâ€ \r\n  and pulled the gun out of her drawer.  Foster then said, â€œWhat are you going \r\n  to do, shoot me?â€  Foster went over to Marilyn, grabbed the gun, and they struggled \r\n  over the gun.  Foster testified that he had one hand on the gun and Marilynâ€™s \r\n  hands were on his hand.  He was trying to pull the gun away from her, he pulled \r\n  it up, and the gun went off only inches from her head.  Immediately after shooting \r\n  Marilyn, Foster called 911.\r\nThe police showed up within minutes of the 911 \r\n  call and apprehended Foster without incident.  They bagged his hands to preserve \r\n  any gunshot residue.\r\nVarious aspects of the forensic evidence were discussed \r\n  at trial.  The fingerprints from the gun were analyzed, but the test was inconclusive.  \r\n  Therefore, the SLED investigator could not say who handled the weapon.  The \r\n  gunshot residue tests conducted on Foster and Marilyn, however, revealed that \r\n  both had gunshot residue on their hands.  Marilyn had gunshot residue on the \r\n  back of each of her hands, while Foster had residue on his left \r\n  palm only.  When Foster cross-examined the pathologist, he testified that \r\n  the results of the gunshot residue tests â€œstrongly suggestâ€ that Marilynâ€™s hands \r\n  completely covered Fosterâ€™s.  Moreover, the pathologist could not say who had \r\n  control over the gun when it was discharged.  Foster presented his own forensic \r\n  expert who opined there was most probably a struggle over the weapon and that \r\n  Marilynâ€™s hands were over Fosterâ€™s hand.\r\nAs the only eyewitness, the testimony of Michelle \r\n  was pivotal to the Stateâ€™s murder case.  In its opening statement, the State \r\n  told the jury:  â€œthe crux of the case is what you are going to hear from Michelle.â€  \r\n  On cross&#8209;examination, Fosterâ€™s counsel questioned Michelle about a statement \r\n  she made to police on April 28:\r\n\r\nQ:  Your statement which you gave them is more or less the \r\n  version you have given us today; is that not right?\r\nA:&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.\r\n\r\nCounsel then proceeded on a line of questioning \r\n  regarding Michelleâ€™s prior inconsistent statements to others on the day \r\n  of the killing.  Specifically, Michelle was asked whether she had told some \r\n  family friends on the morning of the incident that she thought it was an accident.  \r\n  Michelle insisted she had simply said she could not believe Foster â€œcould do \r\n  anything like that.â€  On redirect, the State presented Michelle with her police \r\n  statement and she read it to herself.  The State asked whether the statement \r\n  differed from her testimony, and Michelle replied in the negative.\r\nAfter Michelle and two other witnesses testified, \r\n  the State sought to admit into evidence Michelleâ€™s written statement to police. [3]   Foster objected.  Initially, \r\n  the objection was based on relevance.  The State argued, inter alia, \r\n  that Michelleâ€™s statement was admissible as a prior consistent statement.  \r\n  Fosterâ€™s counsel further argued he did not â€œwant to give more credibility to \r\n  her statement than her verbal testimony.â€  The trial court ruled the statement \r\n  was not hearsay and allowed its admission.\r\nDuring Fosterâ€™s defense, \r\n  he presented two witnesses who both stated Michelle had said her motherâ€™s shooting \r\n  was an â€œaccident.â€  Additionally, one of these witnesses testified Michelle \r\n  had said Foster and Marilyn were fighting over the gun, and the other testified \r\n  Michelle had said â€œit wasnâ€™t [Fosterâ€™s] fault.â€\r\nThe jury convicted Foster of voluntary manslaughter \r\n  and the weapon charge.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals found the trial court \r\n  erred in allowing Michelleâ€™s prior consistent statement.  Finding that the error \r\n  was not harmless, the Court of Appeals reversed Fosterâ€™s convictions and remanded \r\n  for a new trial.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;Did the Court of Appeals correctly reverse \r\n  Fosterâ€™s convictions because of the improper admission of Michelleâ€™s prior consistent \r\n  statement?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State maintains that \r\n  Fosterâ€™s cross-examination question to Michelle about her prior consistent statement \r\n  â€œopened the doorâ€ to its admission.  Alternatively, the State contends that \r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in finding the statement inadmissible under Rule \r\n  801(d)(1)(B), SCRE.  We disagree. [4] \r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is within \r\n  the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent \r\n  an abuse of that discretion.  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d \r\n  240 (2001).  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is \r\n  based on an error of law.  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d \r\n  464 (2000).\r\nThe issue in the instant case is governed by South \r\n  Carolinaâ€™s Rules of Evidence, adopted in 1995.  Pursuant to Rule 801, prior \r\n  consistent statements of a witness are not inadmissible hearsay if:\r\n\r\n[1] the declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and \r\n  is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement;\r\n[2] the statement is consistent with the declarantâ€™s testimony;\r\n[3] the statement is offered to rebut an express or implied \r\n  charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or \r\n  motive; and\r\n[4] the statement was made before the alleged fabrication, \r\n  or before the alleged improper influence or motive arose.  \r\n\r\nRule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE; accord Saltz, supra.\r\nIn Saltz, this Court explained that Rule \r\n  801(d)(1)(B) changed the common law in South Carolina where proof of a prior \r\n  consistent statement had been admissible to rehabilitate a witness who had been \r\n  impeached with a prior inconsistent statement.  Saltz, 346 S.C. at 124-25, \r\n  551 S.E.2d at 245-46;  see also State v. Fulton, 333 S.C. \r\n  359, 509 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 1998) (providing extensive discussion regarding \r\n  law on prior consistent statements, both before and after the adoption of the \r\n  SCRE).  In contrast to South Carolinaâ€™s pre-rules common law, Rule 801(d)(1)(B) \r\n  now â€œmakes a prior consistent statement admissible as substantive evidence.â€  \r\n  Fulton, 333 S.C. at 369, 509 S.E.2d at 824 (emphasis added).  Therefore, \r\n  evidence of a prior consistent statement is only permitted when the elements \r\n  of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) are met.  Saltz, 346 S.C. at 124, 551 S.E.2d at \r\n  245.  Put simply, â€œâ€˜a prior consistent statement offered for rehabilitation \r\n  is either admissible under Rule 801(d)(1)(B) or it is not admissible at all.â€™â€  \r\n  Fulton, 333 S.C. at 374, 509 S.E.2d at 826 (citation omitted).  \r\nThe situation here is very similar to the facts of Saltz.  \r\n  In that case, a State witness, Sydney Johnston, testified she had heard the \r\n  defendant say he â€œkilledâ€ the victim.  On cross&#8209;examination, defense counsel \r\n  posed questions to Sydney about whether she had originally stated the defendant \r\n  had said â€œI did itâ€ and he had been saying that sarcastically.  During the testimony \r\n  of another witness, Jan Kopel, the State was permitted to admit testimony from \r\n  Kopel of a prior consistent statement made by Sydney where Sydney stated the \r\n  defendant had said he â€œkilledâ€ the victim.  This Court held that the questioning \r\n  of a witness about a prior inconsistent statement was insufficient to \r\n  invoke Rule 801(d)(1)(B):\r\n\r\nThe plain language of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) only permits evidence \r\n  of a prior consistent statement when the witness has been charged with recent \r\n  fabrication or improper motive or influence.   Although questioning a witness \r\n  about a prior inconsistent statement does call the witnessâ€™s credibility into \r\n  question, that is not the same as charging the witness with â€œrecent fabricationâ€ \r\n  or â€œimproper influence or motive.â€ â€¦ Appellant questioned the accuracy of the \r\n  witnessâ€™s memory; he did not charge her with recent fabrication or improper \r\n  influence or motive. \r\n\r\nSaltz, 346 S.C. at 124, 551 S.E.2d at 245 (emphasis \r\n  in original, citation omitted).\r\nLikewise, in the instant case, Michelleâ€™s statement was \r\n  inadmissible because there was no express or implied charge against Michelle \r\n  of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.  Fosterâ€™s questions did \r\n  not rise to the level of charging fabrication, but instead amounted to calling \r\n  her credibility into question, i.e., simple impeachment. \r\n  [5]   Thus, because the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) were not met in \r\n  the instant case, the written consistent statement was inadmissible hearsay, \r\n  and the trial court erred in allowing the statement.  Id.  This error \r\n  served only to improperly bolster Michelleâ€™s testimony.  See Tome \r\n  v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 157-58 (1995) (discussing federal \r\n  [6]  Rule 801(d)(1)(B) and stating that the purpose of the rule is to rebut \r\n  an alleged fabrication or motive, not to â€œbolster[] the veracity of the story \r\n  told.â€).\r\nWe reject the Stateâ€™s contention that Foster â€œopened the \r\n  doorâ€ to the prior consistent statement.  The State asserts that because Foster \r\n  asked Michelle a single, non-substantive question about her prior consistent \r\n  statement, and then questioned Michelleâ€™s veracity by asking about her prior \r\n  inconsistent statements, the State was allowed to admit the statement in its \r\n  entirety as substantive evidence.  However, this so-called â€œfairnessâ€ argument \r\n  amounts to an argument that may have been proper under pre-SCRE law, but is \r\n  simply not tenable under Rule 801(d)(1)(B).  See Saltz, supra \r\n  (evidence of a prior consistent statement is only permitted when Rule \r\n  801(d)(1)(B) is satisfied); Fulton, supra (same).  \r\nFurthermore, the instant case is distinguishable from other \r\n  cases where we have found that defense counsel contributed to the error by opening \r\n  the door to otherwise arguably impermissible evidence.  See, e.g., \r\n  State v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991); State v. Stroman, \r\n  281 S.C. 508, 316 S.E.2d 395 (1984); State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, \r\n  282 S.E.2d 838 (1981).  â€œ[W]hen a party introduces evidence about a particular \r\n  matter, the other party is entitled to explain it or rebut it, even if the latter \r\n  evidence would have been incompetent or irrelevant had it been offered initially.â€  \r\n  State v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45, 52, 518 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 1999); \r\n  see also State v. Dunlap, Op. No. 25616 (S.C. Sup. Ct. \r\n  filed Apr. 7, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 12 at 35) (finding that evidence \r\n  of prior drug convictions was properly allowed to rebut false impression made \r\n  by counsel in opening statement).  However, counsel here merely asked whether \r\n  Michelle had given police a statement consistent with her testimony on direct \r\n  examination.  Allowing the State to then admit the written statement did not \r\n  rebut or explain this testimony in any way.  Instead, the sole purpose \r\n  the State had for admitting Michelleâ€™s prior consistent statement was \r\n  to rehabilitate its witness and bolster her credibility which was called into \r\n  question by the cross&#8209;examination on her prior inconsistent statements.  \r\n  This is forbidden unless the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) are met.\r\nAccordingly, we find the Court of Appealsâ€™ correctly \r\n  held the trial court erred by admitting the prior consistent statement, and \r\n  thus abused its discretion.  Saltz, supra; McDonald, supra. \r\n\r\nThe State argues that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt because it was merely cumulative.  We disagree.\r\nAs we stated in Saltz:  â€œ[e]rroneously admitted corroboration \r\n  testimony is not harmless merely because it is cumulative.  On the contrary, \r\n  â€˜it is precisely this cumulative effect which enhances the devastating impact \r\n  of improper corroboration.â€™â€  Saltz, 346 S.C. at 124, 551 S.E.2d at 246 \r\n  (citation omitted).\r\nIn its harmless error analysis, the Court of Appeals stated \r\n  the following:\r\n\r\n[Michelleâ€™s] credibility was of paramount importance; her \r\n  testimony that Foster shot her mother at point blank range after he â€œsnatchedâ€ \r\n  the gun away was the crucial evidence offered by the State of an intentional \r\n  shootingâ€¦.  Moreover, far from being overwhelming, the evidence of guilt was \r\n  highly equivocal.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals.  In its opening statement, \r\n  the State acknowledged Michelleâ€™s testimony would be â€œthe cruxâ€ of its case.  \r\n  Indeed, the evidence of an intentional shooting was based almost exclusively \r\n  on Michelleâ€™s testimony, with some partial corroboration by her brother, Steven.  \r\n  The defense showed, however, that both Michelle and Steven had made prior statements \r\n  inconsistent with their trial testimony and corroborative of Fosterâ€™s \r\n  version of the incident.  Additionally, the forensic evidence certainly supported \r\n  Fosterâ€™s account.  Thus, we hold the admission of Michelleâ€™s prior consistent \r\n  statement, which clearly bolstered her crucial trial testimony, could not be \r\n  considered harmless error.  Saltz, supra.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  MOORE, \r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  I agree with the majority that counselâ€™s cross-examination \r\n  of Michelle regarding allegedly inconsistent statements did not rise to the \r\n  level of charging recent fabrication or improper motive, and therefore her prior \r\n  consistent statement was not admissible under Rule 801(d)(1)(B).  State v. \r\n  Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001).  I part company with the majority, \r\n  however, in its rejection of the Stateâ€™s argument that counsel â€œopened the doorâ€ \r\n  to the admission of Michelleâ€™s statement.\r\nIn context, counsel questioned Michelle as follows:\r\n\r\nQ:      What day did you talk with Tammy Shealy and Todd Johnson, do you remember?\r\nA:      Not at all.\r\nQ:      Was it several days later?\r\nA:      I think it was the 28th.\r\nQ:      So that would be Tuesday.\r\nA:      Yeah.\r\nQ:      Your statement which you gave them is more or less the version you have \r\n  given us today; is that not correct?\r\nA:      Yes.\r\nQ:      Michelle, this is quite important.  I have got a question to ask you \r\n  now.  Did you ever give anybody any other statements regarding this incident \r\n  that differ from the version you gave Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Shealy?\r\nA:      No.\r\n\r\nCounsel then questioned Michelle regarding â€œconversations with anybody on Sunday \r\n  morning or Sunday afternoonâ€ wherein she stated her motherâ€™s killing was an \r\n  accident.\r\nIn asking Michelle whether her statement to police was â€œmore or less \r\n  the version you have given us todayâ€ and whether her statement to police differed \r\n  from her earlier conversations, counsel raised the issue of the statementâ€™s \r\n  content.  Since the defense raised the issue of Michelleâ€™s statement to police, \r\n  it was only fair to allow the State to put the statement into evidence so the \r\n  jury could evaluate the statementâ€™s content for itself.  See State \r\n  v. Robinson, 305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991) (one who opens the door \r\n  to evidence cannot complain of its admission).\r\nI disagree that Saltz prohibits the admission of Michelleâ€™s \r\n  statement under an â€œopening the doorâ€ analysis.  As stated in Saltz, \r\n  the precise issue in that case was â€œwhether questioning the witness concerning \r\n  a prior inconsistent statement invokes Rule 801(d)(1)(B).â€  346 S.C. \r\n  at 123, 551 S.E.2d at 245 (emphasis in original).  Saltz holds examination \r\n  regarding inconsistent statements does not amount to a charge of fabrication \r\n  to justify admission of a consistent statement under that rule.  Here, counsel \r\n  directly questioned the witness about the consistent statement itself, an issue \r\n  not before the Court in Saltz.\r\nBecause counsel opened the door to the admission of Michelleâ€™s statement, \r\n  I would reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate Fosterâ€™s conviction.  Accordingly, \r\n  I respectfully dissent.\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  It was undisputed that the gun, a .357 Magnum revolver, belonged \r\n    to Marilyn and that she kept it in her dresser drawer.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  They each drank quite a bit of alcohol that evening.  Between 9 p.m. \r\n    and 2 a.m., Marilyn consumed about six Crown and sevens and a couple of apple \r\n    cider shooters; Foster drank five Crown and sevens, about nine beers, and \r\n    two apple shooters.  The pathologist testified Marilynâ€™s blood alcohol level \r\n    was .199 percent.  At approximately 7 a.m., Fosterâ€™s blood alcohol level was \r\n    .042 percent.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The statement provides, in pertinent part:\r\n  At about 2:30 a.m. I heard \r\n    what sounded like something breaking so I got up to see what was going on.  \r\n    When I got to Mom [Marilyn] and Scottâ€™s [Fosterâ€™s] bedroom, Mom had a revolver \r\n    type pistol pointed at Scott.  Scott said Are you going to shoot me now?, \r\n    and then took the gun from my mom.  Mom asked Scott Are you going to shoot \r\n    me now and Scott said yes and he shot my Mom.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Initially, we note the State also contends this issue was not properly \r\n    preserved for appellate review.  The issue here is, as it was at the trial \r\n    court, the admissibility of Michelleâ€™s prior consistent statement.  Contemporaneous \r\n    with the Stateâ€™s attempt to admit the statement, Foster objected.  As part \r\n    of his objection, he argued that the statement would add to Michelleâ€™s credibility.  \r\n    The danger of erroneously admitting a prior consistent statement is its bolstering \r\n    effect.  Therefore, we find the issue was sufficiently preserved.  E.g., \r\n    State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997) (to be preserved \r\n    for appeal, an issue must be raised to and ruled on by the trial judge); see \r\n    also Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE (ground of objection to the admission of \r\n    evidence may be apparent from the context).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Fosterâ€™s brief cross-examination of Michelle focused primarily on \r\n    her prior inconsistent statements.  This is markedly different from what has \r\n    been deemed sufficient to trigger Rule 801(d)(1)(B)â€™s requirement of â€œan express \r\n    or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper \r\n    influence or motive.â€  See Saltz, 346 S.C. at 124-27; 551 S.E.2d \r\n    at 246-47 (finding that the Stateâ€™s questions of a defense witness regarding \r\n    her coming forward 13 days before trial and her romantic relationship with \r\n    the defendant charged the witness with both fabrication and improper motive); \r\n    State v. Jeffcoat, 350 S.C. 392, 397, 565 S.E.2d 321, 324 (Ct. App. \r\n    2002) (finding that defense counsel raised the issue of improper influence \r\n    by asking the victim whether she â€œpracticedâ€ before testifying and whether \r\n    anyone had told her what to say).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  â€œRule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE is based upon its counterpart under the \r\n    Federal Rules of Evidence.â€  Fulton, 333 S.C. at 370, 509 S.E.2d at \r\n    824; see also Note to Rule 801, SCRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to Rule 402, SCACR, The Chief Justice's Commission on the Profession","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-06-12-01","description":"This Order amends Rule 420 to allow the Chief Justice to appoint more than 2 additional judges to the Chief Justice's Commission on the Profession","date":"2003-06-16","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntitled Document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Supreme Court \r\n  of South Carolina  \r\n\r\n  RE: Amendment to Rule 420, SCACR, \r\n  The Chief Justice's Commission on the Profession.\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\n Pursuant to art.

Knuckles, 348 S.C. \r\n  593, 560 S.E.2d 426 (Ct. App. 2002).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe relevant facts are uncontested.  Harold D. Knuckles (â€œKnucklesâ€) pled guilty \r\n  to a 1998 indictment for driving under the influence, second offense, in violation \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2930.  The Court of Appeals held the indictment insufficient \r\n  to confer subject matter jurisdiction and vacated Knucklesâ€™ conviction. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in ruling the indictment did not confer subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nKnuckles argues the indictment is insufficient because it fails to allege his \r\n  faculties were â€œmaterially and appreciably impairedâ€ by the use of alcohol or \r\n  drugs, as required by the statute.  We disagree.\r\nA circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction where an indictment is insufficient \r\n  to charge an offense.  Hooks v. State, 353 S.C. 48, 577 S.E.2d 211 (2003).  \r\n  An indictment is sufficient if it contains the necessary elements of the offense \r\n  to be charged and apprises the defendant what he must be prepared to meet.  \r\n  Id. Whether an indictment could be more definite or certain is irrelevant.  \r\n  Id.  \r\nKnucklesâ€™ indictment alleges:\r\n\r\nThat Harold D. Knuckles, Sr. did in Cherokee County on or \r\n  about July 17, 1998, drive a vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquors, \r\n  and/or narcotic drugs, barbiturates, paraldehydes[,] drugs and herbs; such not \r\n  being the first offense within a period of ten years including and immediately \r\n  preceding the foregoing date.\r\n\r\nSection 56-5-2930 prohibits the operation of a motor vehicle while under the:\r\n\r\n(1) influence of alcohol to the extent that the personâ€™s faculties \r\n  to drive are materially and appreciably impaired;\r\n(2) influence of any other drug \r\n  or a combination of other drugs or substances which cause impairment to the \r\n  extent that the personâ€™s faculties to drive are materially and appreciably impaired;  \r\n  or\r\n(3) combined influence of alcohol and any other drug or drugs, \r\n  or substances which cause impairment to the extent that the personâ€™s faculties \r\n  to drive are materially and appreciably impaired.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2930 (Supp. 1998). \r\nThe corpus delicti of DUI is defined as (1) driving a vehicle; (2) \r\n  within this state; (3) while under the influence of intoxicating liquors or \r\n  drugs.  Knuckles, 348 S.C. at 600, 560 S.E.2d at 430 (Shuler dissenting); \r\n  see State v. Osborne, 335 S.C. 172, 516 S.E.2d 201 (1999); State \r\n  v. Salisbury, 343 S.C. 520, 524, 541 S.E.2d 247, 248-49 (2001); State \r\n  v. McCombs, 335 S.C. 123, 515 S.E.2d 547 (Ct. App. 1999); Kerr, supra; \r\n  but see State v. Russell, 345 S.C. 128, 134, 546 S.E.2d \r\n  202, 205 (Ct. App. 2001).  \r\nThe term â€œmaterially and appreciably impairedâ€ as it relates to DUI may be \r\n  traced to State v. Kerr, 330 S.C. 132, 498 S.E.2d 212 (Ct.

McIntosh, Chief, Capital &amp; Collateral Litigation Donald \r\n  J. Zelenka, Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen Bullard, Jr., and Assistant \r\n  Attorney General W. Bryan Dukes, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:  In this post-conviction \r\n  relief (PCR) action, petitioner John H. Williamsâ€™ appellate counsel filed a \r\n  Johnson [1]  petition for \r\n  a writ of certiorari.  We denied counselâ€™s request to be relieved and directed \r\n  the parties to address the following question:\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err in directing, pursuant to In re Maxton, \r\n  325 S.C. 3, 478 S.E.2d 679 (1996), the Georgetown County Clerk of Court not \r\n  to accept any further applications for PCR from petitioner unless he pays the \r\n  $70 filing fee generally required for the filing of a summons and complaint?\r\n\r\nWe subsequently granted the petition \r\n  for a writ of certiorari to review this issue, and we now vacate the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  order.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner was indicted for murder.  A jury convicted \r\n  him of voluntary manslaughter in 1985.  He was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment.  \r\n  This Court affirmed his conviction in an unpublished decision.  State v. \r\n  Williams, Op. No. 86-MO-077 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Feb. 27, 1986).\r\nPetitioner filed his PCR application in 1986.  \r\n  The PCR action was dismissed.  He filed a second PCR application in 1989 which \r\n  was dismissed after a hearing.  This Court denied certiorari in 1991.  Petitioner \r\n  filed a third PCR action in 1994, and again relief was denied after a hearing. \r\n   This Court granted certiorari and reversed.  Williams v. State, Op. \r\n  No. 2000-MO-029 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Mar. 13, 2000). [2] \r\nThe instant case arises out of petitionerâ€™s fourth \r\n  PCR application filed in 2000.  The State filed a return and motion to dismiss \r\n  based in part on the ground that the application was successive.  On June 23, \r\n  2000, the trial court issued a conditional order of dismissal.\r\nOn the same day, the trial court issued another \r\n  order (â€œthe Orderâ€).  Citing In re Maxton, 325 S.C. 3, 478 S.E.2d 679 \r\n  (1996), the Order directed the Georgetown County Clerk of Court to not accept \r\n  any further PCR applications from petitioner unless he pays the filing fee generally \r\n  required for a civil action.  In addition, the Order stated that any future \r\n  PCR applications must be accompanied by a notarized affidavit from petitioner \r\n  certifying his good faith belief that the PCR action is â€œnonfrivolous and properâ€ \r\n  for the court to consider.  Finally, the Order warned petitioner that â€œshould \r\n  he continue to file frivolous PCR applications,â€ he could be held in contempt \r\n  or sanctioned, and sanctions â€œinclude but are not limited to the forfeiture \r\n  of all [his] earned work, education and good time credits.â€ \r\n  [3] \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues the trial court erred in placing \r\n  restrictions on his future filings of PCR actions because his past filings do \r\n  not constitute abusive filings.  We agree.\r\nIn the Maxton case, this Court \r\n  ordered Maxton, a prison inmate, to stop filing frivolous pro se petitions \r\n  in the original jurisdiction of the Court.  Maxton had filed 64 pro \r\n  se petitions in a three-year span all of which had been dismissed pursuant \r\n  to Key v. Currie, 305 S.C. 115, 406 S.E.2d 356 (1991).  The Court characterized \r\n  Maxtonâ€™s numerous filings as â€œrepetitive and frivolousâ€ and ordered the following \r\n  remedy for the â€œabusiveâ€ filings:  the Clerk of Court was directed to refuse \r\n  any further petitions from Maxton unless the filing was accompanied by (1) the \r\n  $25 filing fee generally required for motions; and (2) a properly notarized \r\n  affidavit certifying that he in good faith believes the matter raised in the \r\n  petition is nonfrivolous and proper for the Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction.  \r\n  The Court warned Maxton that if he continued to file frivolous petitions, he \r\n  would be sanctioned under Rule 240, SCACR.   Maxton, supra.\r\nThe Court of Appeals faced a similar issue \r\n  in Lakes v. State, 333 S.C. 382, 510 S.E.2d 228 (Ct. App. 1998).  There, \r\n  an inmate at Allendale Correctional Institution filed for a writ of habeas corpus \r\n  and sought to proceed in forma pauperis.  The trial court denied Lakesâ€™ \r\n  request, and he appealed.  Prior to his state habeas corpus action, Lakes had \r\n  made several filings, including one direct appeal, three PCR applications, two \r\n  petitions for a writ of certiorari, a federal habeas corpus petition, and numerous \r\n  other petitions for writs of mandamus, attorney grievances, and proposed orders \r\n  for release.  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals found the trial court erred \r\n  in not allowing Lakes to proceed in forma pauperis.  The Lakes \r\n  court distinguished Maxton and stated â€œthe trial judge failed to make \r\n  factual findings to show the requests rise to the level of repetitive and abusive \r\n  filings as in Maxton or those cases cited in Maxton.â€  Lakes, \r\n  333 S.C. at 382, 510 S.E.2d at 230.\r\nTurning to the instant \r\n  case, the State argues that because the Order included a factual finding that \r\n  petitionerâ€™s filings were abusive, the Lakes decision is distinguishable.  \r\n  Given that the facts upon which the trial court relied in its order are inaccurate, \r\n  we disagree.  The Order stated that petitionerâ€™s second and third PCR applications \r\n  were â€œsummarily dismissed as successive applications.â€  The conditional order, \r\n  however, stated there were evidentiary hearings held on the second and third \r\n  applications.  Therefore, they were not â€œsummarily dismissed.â€  Moreover, this \r\n  Court reversed the denial of petitionerâ€™s third PCR application.  Accordingly, \r\n  we question the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that petitionerâ€™s filings have been \r\n  completely frivolous.\r\nIn addition, we disagree \r\n  that petitionerâ€™s filings were repetitive and numerous.  Clearly, petitionerâ€™s \r\n  four applications for PCR are much fewer than Maxtonâ€™s filings, and even \r\n  significantly fewer than those of Lakes.  Viewing petitionerâ€™s relatively low \r\n  number of filings, we find insufficient factual basis to determine petitioner \r\n  is an abusive litigant.\r\nIn sum, because petitioner \r\n  has filed merely four PCR actions, and has gotten relief in one, his filings \r\n  are neither repetitive, numerous, nor totally frivolous.  This is clearly a \r\n  situation distinguishable from that in Maxton.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial court erred \r\n  in sanctioning petitioner with a Maxton order.  Accordingly, we VACATE \r\n  the Order.\r\nORDER VACATED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE AND PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  \r\n  BURNETT, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Johnson v.

Haile, \r\n  of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan \r\n  McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney \r\n  General Charles H. Richardson, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, \r\n  Jr., all of Columbia, and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:  Terry Ted Lindsey \r\n  was convicted of first degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) and sentenced to \r\n  life imprisonment without parole pursuant to the Two-Strikes Law, S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1) (Supp. 2002).  We affirm his conviction, but reverse and \r\n  remand for resentencing.\r\nFACTS\r\nLindsey was indicted \r\n  for committing first-degree criminal sexual conduct on his seventeen year old \r\n  step-daughter.  According to the Victim, Lindsey was driving her to her cousinâ€™s \r\n  house when he took a detour, locked the car doors, then forced himself on her, \r\n  raping her.  The trial judge submitted the charges of first and third degree \r\n  CSC to the jury.  The jury convicted Lindsey of first-degree CSC.  Based upon \r\n  his 1976 guilty plea to rape, Lindsey was sentenced to life imprisonment without \r\n  parole (LWOP) under the Two-Strikes law.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.  Did the trial court err in \r\n  sentencing Lindsey to life without parole pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(A)(1), \r\n  where the triggering offense of rape is not enumerated as a â€œmost serious offenseâ€ \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1)?\r\n2.  Was there any evidence of \r\n  â€œaggravated force,â€ such that the trial judge properly denied Lindseyâ€™s motion \r\n  for a directed verdict on the charge of first degree CSC?\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMOST SERIOUS OFFENSE  \r\nLindsey contends \r\n  his 1976 rape conviction is not enumerated as a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (C)(1), such that he was improperly sentenced to LWOP.  \r\n  We agree.\r\nUnder Â§ 17-25-45(A), \r\n  a person must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life without the possibility \r\n  of parole if that person has two or more prior convictions for a â€œmost seriousâ€ \r\n  offense.  Subsection (C) defines â€œmost seriousâ€ offenses and includes first \r\n  and second degree CSC, criminal sexual conduct with minors, and assault with \r\n  intent to commit criminal sexual conduct, first and second degree.  However, \r\n  â€œrapeâ€ is not listed as a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense.  The question we must resolve \r\n  is whether Lindseyâ€™s 1976 rape conviction necessarily fell into the category \r\n  of a first or second degree CSC, so as to be considered a â€œmost seriousâ€ offense.  \r\n\r\nIn State v. Washington, \r\n  338 S.C. 392, 526 S.E.2d 709 (2000), we were faced with the issue of whether \r\n  the defendantâ€™s prior convictions for common law burglary and housebreaking \r\n  could be used to enhance his sentence to life without parole, where the prior \r\n  offenses were not listed in section 17-25-45 as &quot;most serious&quot; or \r\n  &quot;serious&quot; offenses.  There, we found Washingtonâ€™s 1982 common law \r\n  burglary offense contained all the elements of first-degree burglary, as enunciated \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(a)(3), such that it was a â€œmost serious offense,â€ \r\n  for which Washington could be sentenced as a recidivist.  Here, then, the question \r\n  is whether Lindseyâ€™s 1976 rape conviction necessarily contains all the \r\n  elements of the â€œmost seriousâ€ CSC offenses specified in Â§ 17-25-45(C)(CSC first-degree, \r\n  CSC second-degree, or criminal sexual conduct with a minor \r\n  [1] ).  We find that it does not.\r\nIn State v. Tuckness, \r\n  257 S.C. 295, 299, 185 S.E.2d 607, 608 (1971), this Court held that â€œravish \r\n  or rape, the words being synonymous, is defined as the carnal knowledge of a \r\n  woman by force and against her consent. . . . In order to constitute \r\n  the crime of rape these must be some degree of penetration of the female genital \r\n  organ by the male genital organ, but any penetration, however slight, is all \r\n  that is necessary.â€  (internal citation omitted).  Notably, rape was not defined \r\n  in Tuckness as including an element of aggravated force.      \r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-3-652(1)(1985), first degree CSC requires  (1) a sexual battery and (2) \r\n  aggravated force or forcible confinement, kidnapping, robbery, extortion, \r\n  burglary, housebreaking, or &quot;any other similar offense or act.&quot;   \r\n  State v. McFadden, 342 S.C. 629, 539 S.E.2d 387 (2000).  Second degree \r\n  CSC requires the use of aggravated coercion to accomplish sexual battery.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-653 (1985).  Third degree CSC (which is not listed as \r\n  a â€œmost serious offenseâ€ in Â§ 17-25-45(C)) occurs where the actor engages in \r\n  sexual battery with the victim and one or more of the following circumstances \r\n  are proven: a) the actor uses force or coercion to accomplish the sexual \r\n  battery in the absence of aggravating circumstances or b) the actor knows \r\n  or has reason to know that the victim is mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, \r\n  or physically helpless and aggravated force or aggravated coercion was not used \r\n  to accomplish sexual battery.\r\nHere, there is no evidence \r\n  in the record concerning Lindseyâ€™s 1976 rape conviction.  The only indication \r\n  concerning that conviction is a form indictment, which gives no details of the \r\n  facts or circumstances concerning the rape.  Accordingly, the 1976 rape may \r\n  have fallen into the category of third degree CSC, involving a sexual battery \r\n  using force or coercion, but without aggravating circumstances.  Since third \r\n  degree CSC is not a â€œmost serious offenseâ€ for which a life sentence may be \r\n  imposed pursuant to Â§ 17-25-45, we find Lindseyâ€™s 1976 rape conviction, absent \r\n  evidence it involved aggravated force or coercion, insufficient to warrant application \r\n  of the recidivist statute.  Accordingly, the LWOP sentence is reversed and the \r\n  matter remanded for resentencing.\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDIRECTED VERDICT/AGGRAVATED \r\n  FORCE  \r\nAt the close of the \r\n  stateâ€™s evidence, Lindsey moved for a directed verdict on the charge of first \r\n  degree CSC, contending there was no evidence of â€œaggravated forceâ€ sufficient \r\n  to submit the charge to the jury.  The trial judge denied the motion.  We affirm.\r\nOn an appeal from the \r\n  trial court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the appellate court \r\n  may only reverse the trial court if there is no evidence to support the trial \r\n  court's ruling.  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).  \r\n  In ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned with the \r\n  existence of evidence, not its weight.  Id.  On appeal from the denial \r\n  of a directed verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light \r\n  most favorable to the State.  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 \r\n  S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999).  If there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial \r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, we must find \r\n  the case was properly submitted to the jury.  State v. Pinckney, 339 \r\n  S.C. 346, 529 S.E.2d 526 (2000). \r\n As noted in Issue 1, \r\n  above, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-652(1)(a), a person is guilty of criminal \r\n  sexual conduct in the first degree â€œif the actor engages in sexual battery with \r\n  the victim and . . . the actor uses aggravated force to accomplish sexual battery.â€ \r\n  [2]   Unlike first degree CSC, third degree CSC requires only that the actor \r\n  engage in a sexual battery with the victim and â€œthe actor uses force or \r\n  coercion to accomplish the sexual battery in the absence of aggravating circumstances.â€  \r\n  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(c), â€œaggravated force means that the actor uses \r\n  physical force or physical violence of a high and aggravated nature to overcome \r\n  the victim or includes the threat of the use of a deadly weapon.â€ \r\n  [3] \r\nIn State v. Green, \r\n  327 S.C. 581, 491 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App. 1997), the Court of Appeals addressed \r\n  the degree of force requisite to a conviction for first degree CSC.  The Court \r\n  of Appeals rejected the stateâ€™s contention that the aggravated force requirement \r\n  for first-degree CSC is satisfied if any of the ABHAN's &quot;circumstances \r\n  of aggravation&quot; are present. \r\n  [4]   It held that â€œunder section 16-3-652(1)(a), a sexual battery constitutes \r\n  first-degree CSC only if it was accomplished through the use of force and \r\n  the force constitutes aggravated force.â€  327 S.C. at 586, 491 S.E.2d at 265 \r\n  (emphasis in original).  The Green court found no evidence Green used \r\n  any force on the victim, such that he should have been granted a directed \r\n  verdict on the charge of first degree CSC.\r\nUnlike Green, \r\n  here there is evidence that after confining his victim in the automobile, Lindsey \r\n  grabbed her hands, got on top of her and was holding her down with his body \r\n  and hands.  The victim testified that he would not get off of her, and that \r\n  she was kicking, pushing, fighting and hitting to get him off of her.  We find \r\n  this evidence sufficient to create a jury issue as to whether Lindsey used aggravated \r\n  force in attacking the victim.  Accord State v. Frazier, 302 S.C. \r\n  500, 397 S.E.2d 93 (1990)(upholding attempted first degree CSC conviction on \r\n  evidence defendant grabbed victim, forced her into the woods and ripped her \r\n  clothes off in an effort to commit a sexual battery); State v. Fulp, \r\n  310 S.C. 278, 423 S.E.2d 149 (Ct.App.1992) (evidence supported a verdict of \r\n  second degree assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct, \r\n  even though the defendant did not verbally threaten the victim, where, after \r\n  pulling her from the balcony railing over which she was trying to escape, the \r\n  defendant grabbed her breasts with both hands and began fumbling with the clothing \r\n  that covered her stomach; thus, the defendant's actions supported an inference \r\n  that he threatened to use high and aggravated force on the victim to commit \r\n  a sexual battery).  Accordingly, we find the charge of first degree CSC was \r\n  properly submitted to the jury.   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the denial \r\n  of Lindseyâ€™s motion for a directed verdict as the evidence presented by the \r\n  state was sufficient to submit the charge of first degree CSC to the jury.  \r\n  However, we find Lindseyâ€™s 1976 rape conviction was improperly used to enhance \r\n  his sentence for the current crime to LWOP.  Accordingly, the matter is remanded \r\n  for resentencing.&nbsp; \r\n AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, \r\n  and REMANDED.\r\nMOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.

However, I write \r\n  separately to illuminate the inconsistency of this result in hopes that the \r\n  General Assembly might remedy it.\r\nAs noted by the majority, the record in this case \r\n  does not include any details of Lindseyâ€™s 1976 rape conviction to instruct us \r\n  in classifying the rape as either first or second degree CSC (enumerated in \r\n  Â§ 17-25-45 as most serious offenses).  In State v. Washington, 338 S.C. \r\n  392, 526 S.E.2d 709 (2000), this Court held that a prior conviction for common \r\n  law burglary constituted a â€œmost serious offenseâ€ because â€œit contained the \r\n  same legal elements as burglary, first degree that section 17-25-45(C)(1) declares \r\n  a â€˜most serious offense.â€™â€  As discussed by the majority, neither first nor \r\n  second degree CSC contain exactly the same legal elements as rape. [5]   Washington, 338 S.C. at 397, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  at 711 (emphasis added).  Under Washington, rape then cannot qualify \r\n  as a most serious offense for purposes of Â§ 17-25-45.  \r\nThe irony of this result is that rape was arguably \r\n  a more severe offense than either first or second degree CSC, both of \r\n  which make a defendant eligible for an LWOP sentence.  Rape required actual \r\n  penetration of the female genital organ by the male genital organ without consent \r\n  and with force; [6]  first and second degree CSC requires only sexual battery \r\n  (which is defined as intercourse or â€œany intrusion, however slight of any \r\n  part of a personâ€™s body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of \r\n  another personâ€™s body,â€) and some degree of force as defined by statute. [7]   First and Second degree CSC \r\n  encompass more conduct than rape, and include penetration by any object.  In \r\n  addition, second degree CSC only requires aggravated coercion - defined as a \r\n  threat to use force - while rape required that actual force be used.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-71; Tuckness.  Because rape was arguably a more serious crime \r\n  than either first or second degree CSC, and certainly more serious than third \r\n  degree CSC, it is only logical that those with prior rape convictions should \r\n  be eligible for LWOP sentences under Â§ 17-25-45.  However, where the terms of \r\n  the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal \r\n  meaning.   City of Columbia v. American Civil Liberties Union of S.C., Inc., \r\n  323 S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996).  \r\nSection 17-25-45 does not name rape as a most serious \r\n  offense, and rape does not contain the same elements as any of the enumerated \r\n  offenses.  Therefore, I agree that Lindseyâ€™s LWOP sentence must be reversed \r\n  under  Washington, but write in hopes that the General Assembly will \r\n  correct the discrepancy this creates in the Two Strikes Law.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]    It is patent that rape does not encompass all \r\n    the elements of CSC with a minor, as there is no requirement the sexual battery \r\n    occur with a minor.  Accord State v. Munn, 292 S.C. 497, 357 \r\n    S.E.2d 461 (1987) (second degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor is not \r\n    a lesser-included offense of second degree criminal sexual conduct because \r\n    it contains the additional requirement the victim be a minor).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]    Under Â§ 16-3-652(1)(b), it is also CSC first \r\n    degree if the victim of the sexual battery is also the victim of forcible \r\n    confinement, kidnapping, robbery, extortion, burglary, housebreaking, or any \r\n    other similar offense or act.  Under the circumstances of this case, the state \r\n    could have relied upon this section to establish first degree CSC, in light \r\n    of the victimâ€™s testimony that she was forcibly confined in the vehicle.  \r\n    However, the state did not rely on this section in the indictment, and the \r\n    language of subsection (b) was not charged to the jury.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]    Aggravated coercion is defined in subsection \r\n    (b) as â€œthe actor threatens to use force or violence of a high and aggravated \r\n    nature to overcome the victim or another person, if the victim reasonably \r\n    believes that the actor has the present ability to carry out the threat, or \r\n    threatens to retaliate in the future by the infliction of physical harm, kidnapping \r\n    or extortion, under circumstances of aggravation, against the victim or any \r\n    other person.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [4]   These circumstances are the infliction of serious \r\n    bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, \r\n    a difference in sexes, the purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, taking \r\n    indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, and resistance to lawful \r\n    authority.  In State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103, n. 4 \r\n    (2002), this Court recognized that ABHAN may occur even without any real use \r\n    of force toward the victim.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  Lindsey was convicted of rape in 1976, and the \r\n    General Assembly amended the Code to provide for different levels of criminal \r\n    sexual conduct in 1977.  Prior to 1977, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-71 (1962) codified \r\n    common law rape.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-71 (1962); State v. Tuckness, \r\n    257 S.C. 295, 185 S.E.2d 607 (1971).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  S.C. Code Ann.

Bruce Littlejohn, and those similarly situated \r\n  against the State of South Carolina and the Department of Revenue (â€œDORâ€) on \r\n  July 10, 2000.  The complaint alleged that plaintiff Littlejohn and other South \r\n  Carolina citizens 85 years of age and older had failed to receive the one percent \r\n  sales tax exemption provided for in S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-36-2620 and 12-36-2630 \r\n  as a result of the action and/or inaction of certain retailers and the State \r\n  and DOR. [1]   The Complaint alleged \r\n  that the State had been unjustly enriched by the illegal tax collections, and \r\n  requested a refund of taxes paid by the plaintiffs. \r\nSubsequently,\r\nthe State and DOR filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on grounds that the\r\ncircuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.  While the motion to dismiss was pending, \r\n  plaintiffs amended their complaint to add several retail establishments as defendants. [2]   The circuit court held a hearing \r\n  to consider the Stateâ€™s motion to dismiss, and took the motion under advisement.  \r\n  While the motion was under advisement, the parties continued discovery, and \r\n  ultimately commenced settlement negotiations.  In September 2001, the parties \r\n  reached a settlement.  \r\nSettlement Agreement\r\nThe settlement agreement specified \r\n  that the State and DOR would refund a total of $7.5 million to the defendant \r\n  retailers and hotels to be held in trust and refunded to those members of the \r\n  plaintiffsâ€™ class that made a claim.  The agreement contained a mathematical \r\n  formula for calculating the refund due to each class member.  The settlement \r\n  agreement left the power to calculate and award attorneysâ€™ fees with the circuit \r\n  court under the following guidelines:\r\n\r\nThe Court shall determine the \r\n  appropriate amount of attorneysâ€™ fees for Plaintiff class counsel.  The Plaintiffs \r\n  recognize that none of the Defendants shall recommend or otherwise take a position \r\n  on the amount of attorneysâ€™ fees and that the amount of such attorneysâ€™ fees \r\n  shall be decided by the Court; provided, however, Defendant State of South Carolina \r\n  may file with the Court a statement that members of the Budget and Control Board \r\n  recommend to the Court that the Plaintiffâ€™s class counsel attorneysâ€™ fees be \r\n  set at an amount that maximizes payment to class members and recommend that \r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees be based on actual refunds paid to the Plaintiff class.  Nothing \r\n  in this agreement prohibits public officials, as individuals or as public officials, \r\n  from discussing the amount of attorneysâ€™ fees awarded by the Court or taking \r\n  a position before the Court about such fees. [3] \r\n\r\nOn September 21, 2001, the circuit \r\n  court gave preliminary approval to the settlement, set a thirty day time period \r\n  for objections, and scheduled a hearing for December 27, 2001, in order to review \r\n  any objections, give final approval of the settlement, and determine attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees.  The Attorney General, appearing for the first time in this action, filed \r\n  objections to the award of attorneysâ€™ fees in the settlement agreement.  None \r\n  of the parties objected to the settlement or to the award of attorneysâ€™ fees.  \r\n  At the December hearing, the Attorney General argued that attorneysâ€™ fees should \r\n  be based on a reasonable hourly rate.\r\nAward of Attorneysâ€™ Fees\r\nThe circuit court gave final \r\n  approval to the settlement agreement in January 2002, and issued an order awarding \r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees in the amount of 28% of the $7.5 million common fund ($2.1 million), \r\n  plus $52,174.22 in costs.  The circuit courtâ€™s order awarding fees includes \r\n  a discussion of the procedural history of the case and of Respondentsâ€™ efforts \r\n  in initiating and settling the case.  In addition, the circuit court used the \r\n  factors for establishing a reasonable fee enumerated in Rule 1.5, Rules of \r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, to determine the appropriate fee.  \r\n  The courtâ€™s order included application of the following factors: (1) the novelty \r\n  and difficulty of the issues, (2) the skills of counsel, (3) the time and labor \r\n  of counsel, (4) the likelihood that acceptance of this case would preclude other \r\n  employment by counsel, (5) the fees customarily charged in similar cases, (6) \r\n  the amount involved and the award obtained, (7) the time and limitations imposed \r\n  by the client, (8) the nature and length of the professional relationship between \r\n  the client and counsel, (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of counsel, \r\n  and (10) whether the fee contemplated was fixed or contingent.  See Jackson \r\n  v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997) (listing the factors the court \r\n  should consider in determining a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee). [4]   After applying the factors to \r\n  the present case, the circuit court found that an award of 28% of the common \r\n  fund, plus costs, was a fair and reasonable attorneysâ€™ fee.  \r\nThe Attorney General filed a \r\n  notice of appeal from the order awarding attorneysâ€™ fees and costs.  This Court \r\n  certified the case for review before the appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.  \r\n  Respondents filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on grounds that the Attorney \r\n  General lacked standing to appeal.  This Court denied the motion to dismiss, \r\n  but did so â€œwithout prejudice to [Respondentsâ€™] right to argue this issue in \r\n  its brief.â€  The following issues are presently before the Court:\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Attorney Generalâ€™s appeal from the circuit courtâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees properly before this Court? \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, was the circuit courtâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees reasonable?\r\n\r\nLaw /Analysis\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorney Generalâ€™s Ability to Appeal \r\n   \r\n\r\nRespondents argue that \r\n  the Attorney Generalâ€™s appeal from the circuit courtâ€™s award of their attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees should be dismissed.  For several reasons, we agree.\r\nIn support of their \r\n  contention, Respondents cite Bailey v. North Carolina, 540 S.E.2d 313 \r\n  (N.C. 2000).  In Bailey, plaintiffs (a consolidated class of state and \r\n  federal retirees) sued North Carolina over the constitutionality of a tax exemption \r\n  cap on retirement benefits.  Id.  After extensive litigation, in which \r\n  the State was represented by the Attorney General, the State reached a settlement \r\n  with the plaintiffs, and the circuit court awarded attorneysâ€™ fees to plaintiffsâ€™ \r\n  counsel.  Id.  Subsequently, the Attorney General appealed from the award \r\n  of fees, alleging that the fees awarded were excessive and against the public \r\n  interest. [5]   Id.  Ultimately, \r\n  the North Carolina Supreme Court dismissed his appeal as improper and also held \r\n  that the Attorney General was precluded from seeking review of attorneysâ€™ fees \r\n  by way of a petition for a writ of certiorari.  Id.  \r\nAlthough the North \r\n  Carolina Supreme Court discussed whether the Attorney General had standing at \r\n  all to assert this appeal, the court chose to base its decision on the Attorney \r\n  Generalâ€™s failure to intervene as required by Rule 24 of the North Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure (â€œNCRCPâ€).  Rule 24, NCRCP, provides the procedure \r\n  for intervention of right and permissive intervention.  To intervene under either \r\n  subsection of Rule 24, NCRCP, the person wishing to intervene â€œshall serve a \r\n  motion to intervene upon all parties affected thereby.â€  The Attorney General \r\n  did not move to intervene.  As such, the court reasoned, \r\n\r\n[a]s a review of the record reveals \r\n  neither an intervention motion on the part of the Attorney General nor an order \r\n  granting such a motion from the trial judge, we are constrained by law to conclude \r\n  that the Attorney General, at least in regard to his asserted role as â€œdefender \r\n  of the public interest,â€ is not a party to this action.\r\n\r\nId. at 155-56.  The court \r\n  then dismissed the appeal as improper because only â€œpartiesâ€ are entitled by \r\n  law to appeal under Rule 3 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure.  \r\n  Id.  â€œA careful reading of Rule 3 reveals that its various subsections \r\n  afford no avenue of appeal to either entities or persons who are nonparties \r\n  to a civil action.  Therefore, as we have already determined the Attorney General \r\n  is not a party to the case sub judice, we can find no grounds on which \r\n  to allow his appeal.â€  Id. at 156.\r\nLikewise, Rule 24 of \r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, (â€œSCRCPâ€), provides for both intervention \r\n  of right and permissive intervention, and requires that a â€œa person desiring \r\n  to intervene shall serve a motion to intervene upon the parties.â€  In addition, \r\n  Rule 201(b), SCACR, provides that only â€œa party aggrieved by an order, \r\n  judgment, or sentence may appeal.â€  (emphasis added).  In the case at hand, \r\n  it is undisputed that the Attorney General was not a party to the action originally, \r\n  and never intervened to become a party.\r\nIn his reply brief, the Attorney \r\n  General avoids discussing the impact of his failure to move for intervention \r\n  pursuant to Rule 24, SCRCP.  In fact, the Attorney General appears to admit \r\n  that he is a nonparty, but argues that his duty to protect the public interest \r\n  enables him to bring this appeal, even as a nonparty.  Like the North Carolina \r\n  Attorney General in the Bailey case, our Attorney General claims statutory \r\n  and common law authority give him the ability to appeal in this case, apparently \r\n  regardless of the Rules of Civil Procedure. [6]   In support of his right to appeal, the Attorney \r\n  General cites South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 1-7-40, which provides that the Attorney \r\n  General\r\n\r\nshall appear for the State in \r\n  the Supreme Court and the court of appeals in the trial and argument of all \r\n  causes, criminal and civil, in which the State is a party or is interested, \r\n  and in these causes in any other court or tribunal when required by the Governor \r\n  or either branch of the General Assembly. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-7-40 (Supp. \r\n  2002).  Because the State and the DOR are parties to this action, the Attorney \r\n  General reasons that he can automatically â€œappearâ€ for the State.  In addition \r\n  to the Code, the Attorney General cites several South Carolina cases in which \r\n  the Attorney Generalâ€™s authority, as the Stateâ€™s chief law officer, to represent \r\n  the State and to protect the publicâ€™s interests has been recognized by this \r\n  Court.  See State ex rel. Condon v. Hodges; State ex rel. Daniel v. Broad \r\n  River Power Co., 157 S.C. 1, 153 S.E. 537 (1929); State ex rel. Wolfe \r\n  v. Sanders, 118 S.C. 498, 110 S.E. 808 (1920). \r\n  [7]   \r\nThis Court has recognized that \r\n  the Attorney General has broad statutory and common law authority in his capacity \r\n  as the chief legal officer of the State to institute actions involving the welfare \r\n  of the State and its citizens, including vindication of wrongs committed collectively \r\n  against the citizens of the State.  See Condon v. Hodges, 349 S.C. 232, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 623 (2002); State v. Beach, 271 S.C. 425, 248 S.E.2d 115 (1978).  \r\n  However, this Court has never held that the Attorney Generalâ€™s authority to \r\n  do so is unlimited or somehow uniquely exempts him from acting in accordance \r\n  with the Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Beach.  The Attorney General \r\n  cites Watson v. Wall, in which the Attorney General intervened in a will \r\n  dispute in order to protect the publicâ€™s interest in the charitable trust at \r\n  issue, in support of his authority to assert the appeal in the present case.  \r\n  299 S.C. 500, 93 S.E.2d 918 (1956).  In Watson, however, the Attorney \r\n  General moved to intervene, and, consequently, was named a party to the action.  \r\n  Id. Further, in Watson, the Attorney General had specific statutory \r\n  support for his intervention under his duty â€œâ€˜to enforce the application of \r\n  funds given or appropriated to public charities.â€™â€  Id. at 515, 93 S.E.2d \r\n  at 925 (quoting S.C. Code Â§Â§ 1-240 (1952)). \r\nIn our opinion, Watson actually \r\n  supports the Respondentsâ€™ contention that the Attorney General is required, \r\n  like everyone else, to formally intervene and become a named party before he \r\n  can file an appeal.  Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal based on the Attorney \r\n  Generalâ€™s failure to move for intervention as required by Rule 24, SCRCP.  Such \r\n  a ruling avoids the necessity of addressing the Attorney Generalâ€™s standing \r\n  to become involved in this action, and makes clear that the Attorney General \r\n  is required to follow the Rules of Civil Procedure when he wishes to become \r\n  involved in a case.  \r\nIn addition, we note that this \r\n  holding serves the public interest in the finality of settlement agreements, \r\n  particularly in settlements with the State.  The settlement agreement in this \r\n  case contains a â€œno appealâ€ provision.  The agreement provides, \r\n\r\n[i]t is expressly acknowledged \r\n  and agreed that the parties and their counsel will not institute, participate \r\n  in, or encourage, any appeal from an order implementing this Agreement, provided, \r\n  however, any party has the right to appeal an order which is substantially different \r\n  from the terms of this Agreement, or which alters the consideration to be given \r\n  by or to any party. \r\n\r\nThe stated purpose of the settlement \r\n  agreement is â€œto settle this conflict by the terms set forth herein such that \r\n  the Agreement forever ends all litigation.â€ The agreement mandates that â€œ[a]ny \r\n  interpretation of language in this Agreement must be made so as to effectuate \r\n  the [stated] purpose.â€\r\n The Attorney General \r\n  uses the statement within the Attorneysâ€™ Fees section of the settlement agreement \r\n  to support his right to appeal.  As discussed, the settlement agreement does \r\n  not prevent public officials â€œfrom discussing the amount of attorneysâ€™ fees \r\n  awarded by the Court or taking a position before the Court about such fees.â€  \r\n  However, it is clear from the settlement agreementâ€™s repeated reference to â€œthe \r\n  Courtâ€ that it is referring to the circuit court.  As such, this provision must \r\n  be construed to give the Attorney General, as a public official, the right to \r\n  take a position on fees before the circuit court only, which the Attorney General \r\n  did at the December 27, 2001, circuit court hearing.  This is the interpretation \r\n  most consistent with the no appeal provision in the agreement, and with the \r\n  agreementâ€™s mandate to interpret language to further the partiesâ€™ stated purpose \r\n  of reaching a final settlement.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAttorneysâ€™ Fees \r\n   \r\nIn light of our decision \r\n  on the preceding issue, it is unnecessary for us to address the reasonableness \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees.  We note, however, that the circuit courtâ€™s order demonstrates \r\n  that the court considered each of the factors set out by this Court in Jackson \r\n  v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 486 S.E.2d 750 (1997), and those factors enumerated \r\n  in Rule 1.5, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR in determining that 28% of the common fund \r\n  was a reasonable fee.\r\nTo prevail on appeal, \r\n  this Court must find that the circuit courtâ€™s findings of fact are not supported \r\n  by â€œany competent evidence.â€  Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., \r\n  310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993) (citing Baron Data Sys., Inc. \r\n  v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296 (1989) (emphasis added).  Although \r\n  Respondents were awarded a very substantial sum ($2.1 million) for their work \r\n  on this case that took 10 months to settle, Respondents achieved a good result \r\n  for the class, including securing the prospective enforcement of the tax exemption, \r\n  and took the risk of not earning any fee at all.   Therefore, we would be inclined \r\n  to find that there is evidence to support the circuit courtâ€™s findings on each \r\n  factor under the â€œany competent evidenceâ€ standard. [8]   \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, \r\n  we DISMISS this appeal. \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, \r\n  JJ., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Section 12-36-2620 provides for a five percent sales and use tax, \r\n    comprised of two components - a four percent tax and a one percent tax.  Section \r\n    12-36-2630 provides for a seven percent tax on accommodations for transients, \r\n    comprised of three components - a four percent tax, a one percent tax, and \r\n    a two percent tax.  Both sections exempt persons 85 years of age and older \r\n    from paying the one percent tax when purchasing tangible personal property \r\n    for his or her own personal use.  The record reflects that Chief Justice Littlejohn \r\n    realized he consistently paid this one percent tax and approached Respondents \r\n    to recover the taxes paid.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2] Plaintiffs filed two \r\n    amended complaints.  The first amended complaint added Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. \r\n    and Hyatt-Regency Hilton Head, Inc., on behalf of retailers and hotels/motels \r\n    similarly situated.  The Second Amended complaint added CVS Pharmacy, Inc., \r\n    KMART Corporation, Eckerd Corporation, Piggly Wiggly Retail Stores, Inc., \r\n    Piggly Wiggly #32, Inc., Piggly Wiggly #75, Inc., Harris Teeter, Inc., and \r\n    Winn-Dixie, Raleigh, Inc.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The term â€œthe Courtâ€ is used to refer to the circuit court throughout \r\n    the settlement agreement.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The factors considered in the circuit courtâ€™s order include all of \r\n    the factors this Court listed in Jackson, although they are arranged \r\n    in a different order and some are stated in slightly different terms.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The North Carolina Supreme Court framed the Attorney Generalâ€™s argument \r\n    as follows:  â€œIn short, the Attorney General argues that the amount awarded \r\n    as fees to Class Counsel is excessive and concludes that since none of the \r\n    prevailing class members have appealed the allocation of such fees, his office \r\n    must carry the mantle - in the public interest.â€  Bailey, 540 S.E.2d \r\n    at 318.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  The Attorney General attempts to distinguish Bailey from the \r\n    present case by arguing that (1) the North Carolina Attorney Generalâ€™s authority \r\n    to act in the public interest is not as broad as the South Carolina Attorney \r\n    Generalâ€™s authority, and (2) North Carolina agreed not to involve itself in \r\n    the determination of attorneysâ€™ fees in its settlement agreement with the \r\n    plaintiffs, and South Carolina did not in this case. The Attorney General \r\n    focuses on language within the settlement agreement that permits public officials \r\n    to take a position on the fees.  As pointed out earlier, however, this statement \r\n    refers to taking a position on fees before the circuit court, which the Attorney \r\n    General was permitted to do in this case.  Supra, fn. 3.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  It is interesting to note that the Attorney General instituted each \r\n    of the above actions, and was a named party in each one.  The Attorney General \r\n    also cites two cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that the \r\n    Attorney General may take an appeal even though he is not a named party to \r\n    a suit.  In re Estate of Tomlinson, 359 N.E.2d 109 (Ill. 1979); Shevin \r\n    v. Kerwin, 279 So.2d 836 (Fl. 1973) (allowing Attorney General to appeal \r\n    from lower court decision holding state statute unconstitutional although \r\n    he was not a party before the lower court).  Although Illinois does seem to \r\n    allow nonparties to appeal if they have an interest in the action that is \r\n    â€œdirect, immediate and substantial,â€ this rule applies to all parties, not \r\n    just the Attorney General.  South Carolina has no comparable tradition of \r\n    allowing nonparties to appeal.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  Rather than focusing on the contingency fee agreement in this case \r\n    as the Attorney General claims the circuit court did, the circuit court spent \r\n    much more energy on the â€œfees customarily charged in similar casesâ€ factor.  \r\n    The analysis under this factor is particularly persuasive to us.  See Paul, \r\n    Johnson, Alston &amp; Graulty, 886 F.2d 268, 272 (9th Cir. \r\n    1989) (finding that fees ordinarily â€œrange from 20 percent to 30 percent of \r\n    the common fund createdâ€). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25671","title":"In the Matter of Former Greenville County Magistrate Michael B.

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nOscar W. Bannister, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand. \r\n  [1]   Respondent has also resigned his position and has agreed never to \r\n  seek nor accept a judicial office in South Carolina without the express written \r\n  permission of the Supreme Court of South Carolina.  We accept the agreement \r\n  and publicly reprimand respondent, the most severe sanction we are able to impose \r\n  in these circumstances.  \r\nRespondent admits in the Agreement for Discipline by Consent that he made use \r\n  of internet facilities, while on duty at the magisterial offices furnished by \r\n  Greenville County, which was contrary to the published directives of Greenville \r\n  County and the South Carolina Judicial Department.  Respondent also admits that, \r\n  in connection with this matter, he submitted information to the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel which he knew or should have known was incorrect or incomplete.\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Code \r\n  of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR: Canon 1 (a judge shall observe high standards \r\n  of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary is preserved); \r\n  Canon 2(A)(a judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety \r\n  by acting at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity \r\n  of the judiciary); and Canon 4(A)(2)(a judge shall conduct all of the judge's \r\n  extra-judicial activities so that they do not demean the judicial office).  \r\n  Respondent has also violated the following provisions of the Rules for Judicial \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(it shall be a ground \r\n  for discipline for a judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule \r\n  7(a)(7)(it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to willfully violate \r\n  a valid court order issued by a court of this state).\r\nWe accept the agreement for a public reprimand because respondent is no longer \r\n  a magistrate and because he has agreed not to hereafter seek nor accept another \r\n  judicial position in South Carolina without first obtaining permission from \r\n  this Court. [2]   As previously \r\n  noted, this is the strongest punishment we can give respondent, given the fact \r\n  that he has already resigned his duties as a magistrate.  See In re \r\n  Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996)(&quot;A public reprimand is \r\n  the most severe sanction that can be imposed when the respondent no longer holds \r\n  judicial office.&quot;)  Accordingly, respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded \r\n  for his conduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent was placed on interim suspension by \r\n    way of order of this Court dated May 6, 2003.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Respondent has agreed that, in the event he does \r\n    seek such permission from this Court, he shall not do so without prior notice \r\n    to Disciplinary Counsel and without allowing Disciplinary Counsel to disclose \r\n    to this Court any information related to this matter and any information relevant \r\n    to the issue of respondent holding judicial office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25672","title":"Moultrie v.

Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nHarry L. DeVoe, Jr., of New Zion, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  Respondent was convicted of first degree criminal \r\n  sexual conduct with a minor (CSCM) and sentenced to eighteen years.  His conviction \r\n  was affirmed on appeal to the Court of Appeals by memorandum decision.  Respondent \r\n  then brought this action for post-conviction relief (PCR) which was granted.  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was charged with CSCM for digitally penetrating \r\n  his six-year-old nieceâ€™s vagina and tearing her vaginal wall just below the \r\n  cervix.  Both CSCM and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) \r\n  were submitted to the jury.  Respondent was convicted of CSCM.  \r\nOn PCR, the judge granted relief for counselâ€™s failure to request a King [1]  charge, which was required at \r\n  the time of trial. [2]   A King charge would have \r\n  instructed the jury to resolve any doubt in favor of the lesser offense.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWas respondent prejudiced by trial counselâ€™s failure to request a King \r\n  charge?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(1) (2003), CSCM is \r\n  a sexual battery on a child less than eleven years old.  A sexual battery is \r\n  any intrusion, however slight, into the victimâ€™s body.  Â§16-3-651(h).  Respondent \r\n  testified, contrary to the victimâ€™s testimony, he did not penetrate her.  He \r\n  claimed her injury occurred when she fell out of a bunk bed while he was asleep \r\n  in another room.  Medical testimony indicated the victimâ€™s internal injury could \r\n  have been caused only by penetration of the vagina and not by an external blow.  \r\n\r\nUnder the evidence presented, respondent was guilty of a sexual battery or \r\n  no battery at all.  In such a case, the defendant is not entitled to a charge \r\n  of ABHAN as a lesser-included offense of CSCM.  State v. Forbes, 296 \r\n  S.C. 344, 372 S.E.2d 591 (1988).  Where there is no evidence to support an instruction \r\n  on the lesser offense, a PCR applicant cannot show prejudice from the failure \r\n  to request a King charge.  Bell v. State, 321 S.C. 238, 467 S.E.2d \r\n  926 (1996); Gilmore v. State, 314 S.C. 453, 445 S.E.2d 454 (1994).  Since \r\n  respondent was not entitled to a charge on ABHAN, there is no prejudice from \r\n  counselâ€™s failure to request a King charge.  Accordingly, PCR \r\n  was improperly granted.  Brown v. State, 340 S.C. 590, 533 S.E.2d 308 \r\n  (2000) (grant of PCR reversed where there no prejudice is shown).\r\nREVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    State v.
