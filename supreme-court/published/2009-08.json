Sessions, 370 S.C. 229, 633 S.E.2d 905 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the court of\r\n  appeals.Â  We reverse and reinstate the defense verdict, for we hold Respondents\r\n  were not prejudiced by the jury charge.\r\nI.\r\nDiana\r\n  Ardis suffered a herniated disk which\r\n  resulted in surgery on February 29, 1996.Â  Ardis sued Dr. Edward L. Sessions in\r\n  negligence for chiropractic malpractice, claiming Sessions caused the herniated\r\n  disk when he performed a spinal manipulation on February 19, 1996.[1]Â \r\n  Sessions denied he performed a manipulation on February 19, and the trial\r\n  centered on who was telling the truth about the February 19 office visit.\r\nArdis\r\n  reported on February 19 to Sessions (and separately to his office assistant)\r\n  â€œthat she had slipped off of a ladder hurting her left low back and leg.â€Â \r\n  Ardis admitted she made the statements about falling off a ladder, but\r\n  purportedly only in jest.Â  â€œAt trial, Sessions testified that instead of a\r\n  manipulation that day, he used a less invasive treatment, which would have been\r\n  insufficient to herniate [Ardisâ€™] disk.â€[2]Â  Ardis, 370 S.C. at 231, 633 S.E.2d at 906.\r\nThe\r\n  jury returned a defense verdict.Â  Ardis appealed, challenging the â€œgood faithâ€\r\n  portion of the jury charge, the refusal to charge the jury as requested, and\r\n  certain evidentiary rulings.Â  A panel majority of the court of appeals reversed\r\n  and remanded based on its view that the â€œgood faithâ€ jury charge was erroneous\r\n  and prejudicial.Â  One member of the appellate panel dissented, noting that\r\n  â€œ[w]hen reviewing a jury instruction for alleged error, the appellate court\r\n  must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues\r\n  presented at trial.â€ Â Ardis, 370 S.C. at 234, 633 S.E.2d at 907 (Beatty,\r\n  J. dissenting).Â  \r\nII.\r\nA.\r\nThe challenged jury charge is as follows:\r\n\r\n  I . . . charge you that a mistake in diagnosis of\r\n    itself will not support a verdict in a malpractice suit.Â  I charge you that a\r\n    physician is not ordinarily liable for making an incorrect diagnosis where it\r\n    is made in good faith and there is reasonable doubt as to the nature of the\r\n    physical conditions involved or as to what should be done in accordance with\r\n    recognized authority in good current practice or where it is made in good faith\r\n    on observation of the patient and based upon physical evidences and symptoms\r\n    which would warrant such diagnosis by a reasonably prudent and informed\r\n    physician.[3]\r\n\r\nThe court of\r\n  appeals agreed with Ardis and found the jury instruction erroneous and\r\n  prejudicial.\r\nWe agree with the court of appeals majority that a â€œgood\r\n  faithâ€ jury charge in a professional malpractice case is improper due to the\r\n  implication that â€œan error in judgment is actionable only if made in bad\r\n  faith.â€Â  McCourt ex rel. McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 306, 457 S.E.2d\r\n  603, 606 (1995).Â  The â€œgood faithâ€ instruction requires a plaintiff in a\r\n  malpractice action to demonstrate not only a departure from the standard of\r\n  care, but additionally that such error was made in bad faith.Â  The â€œgood faithâ€\r\n  instruction impermissibly adds a subjective component contrary to our objective\r\n  professional negligence law. \r\nB.\r\nThe\r\n  â€œgood faithâ€ instruction, while erroneous, did not prejudice Ardis.\r\nWhen an appellate court reviews an alleged error in a jury charge,\r\n  it â€œmust consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence\r\n  and issues presented at trial.Â  If, as a whole, the charges are reasonably free\r\n  from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute\r\n  reversible error.â€Â  Keaton ex rel.\r\n    Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334\r\n  S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999) (citations omitted).Â  This holistic\r\n  approach to jury instructions is linked to the principle of appellate procedure that â€œ[a]n error not shown to be\r\n  prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversal.â€&nbsp; Brown v.\r\n    Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 417, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997); see\r\n      also Cole v. Raut, 378 S.C. 398, 405, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008)\r\n  (reciting the rule that a charge must be erroneous and prejudicial to warrant\r\n  reversal);Â  Ellison v. Simmons, 238 S.C. 364, 372, 120 S.E.2d 209, 213\r\n  (1961) (noting that a jury â€œcharge, even if erroneous, on a matter not in\r\n  issue, is not always considered prejudicialâ€).Â  \r\nThe â€œgood\r\n  faithâ€ jury instruction was limited to liability associated with â€œan incorrect\r\n  diagnosis.â€Â  Ardis, 370 S.C. at 232, 633 S.E.2d at 906.Â  At best, the\r\n  malpractice claim of Ardis only tangentially concerned an incorrect diagnosis.Â \r\n  Because the outcome of the malpractice claim turned on who was telling the\r\n  truth about the February 19 office visit, the trial focused on the conflicting\r\n  testimony and the records of the February 19 visit.\r\nAs\r\n  counsel for Sessions argued to the jury, â€œwe come back to this piece of paper\r\n  [concerning the February 19 office visit] because the case turns on the\r\n  accuracy of this document.â€Â  Sessionsâ€™ counsel further argued in closing that\r\n  â€œthe bottom line issue is[,] did she get a chiropractic adjustment on February\r\n  the 19th, 1996?Â  Because if she didnâ€™t, her whole case is gone.â€[4]Â  \r\nMost\r\n  professional negligence actions involve scrutiny of the professionalâ€™s exercise\r\n  of judgment.Â  This case, however, presents an exception to the typical\r\n  professional malpractice claim in that the outcome of this malpractice claim\r\n  turned on who was telling the truth about the February 19 office visit.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  when the challenged jury charge is viewed\r\n  â€œin light of the evidence and issues presented at trial[,]â€ it becomes apparent that the challenged â€œgood faithâ€ jury\r\n  charge resulted in no prejudice to Ardis.Â  Keaton, 334 S.C. at 497, 514\r\n  S.E.2d at 575. \r\nC.\r\nBecause\r\n  the court of appeals reversed the defense verdict based on the â€œgood faithâ€\r\n  jury charge, the court of appeals did not reach Ardisâ€™ other appellate issues.Â \r\n  We have reviewed the record and find no prejudicial errors in the exclusion of\r\n  evidence or the trial courtâ€™s refusal to give a requested instruction.Â  We\r\n  affirm the trial court pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following\r\n  authorities: Issues II, III, and V:Â  Gamble v. Intâ€™l Paper Realty Corp. of\r\n    S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996) (â€œThe admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court and absent clear abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal.â€); and Â Â Issue\r\n  IV:Â  Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 224, 584 S.E.2d 423, 427 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting that an appellate court must review a challenged jury instruction as\r\n  a whole, and that a trial courtâ€™s failure to charge a â€œproperly requested\r\n  charge is reversible error only where the requesting party can demonstrate\r\n  prejudice from the refusalâ€).Â  \r\nIII.\r\nIn a\r\n  professional negligence action, a â€œgood faithâ€ jury instruction that imposes on\r\n  a plaintiff the additional burden of showing bad faith improperly introduces a\r\n  subjective element to our objective test of liability.Â  Here, the â€œgood faithâ€\r\n  charge was erroneous, but not prejudicial.Â  Nothing in the charge casts doubt\r\n  on the juryâ€™s ability to objectively and fairly determine the truth concerning\r\n  the February 19, 1996 office visit.Â  When\r\n  the â€œgood faithâ€ charge is viewed â€œin light of the evidence and issues\r\n  presented at trial[,]â€ it is apparent\r\n  that the jury charge resulted in no prejudice to Ardis.Â  Keaton, 334\r\n  S.C. at 497, 514 S.E.2d at 575.Â  We therefore reverse the decision of the court\r\n  of appeals and reinstate the defense verdict.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J. and\r\n  Acting Justice BURNETT, concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion\r\n  in which WALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  While I agree with the\r\n  majority that the â€œgood faithâ€ jury instruction was erroneous, I also find that\r\n  the charge was prejudicial and would affirm the Court of Appeals.\r\nIf the jury believed Ardisâ€™s\r\n  assertion that Sessions performed a manipulation under the circumstances she\r\n  described, the jury must still have found that her version of the facts\r\n  demonstrated negligence on the part of Sessions, in order for Ardis to prevail. See Hurd v. Williamsburg Co., 353 S.C. 596, 615, 579 S.E.2d 136,\r\n  146 (Ct. App. 2003), affâ€™d, 363 S.C. 421, 611 S.E.2d 488 (The burden of\r\n  proof in a negligence action is on the plaintiff to establish the negligence of\r\n  the defendant).Â  At trial, Ardis presented evidence to show not only that\r\n  Sessions performed the manipulation, but also that in doing so he breached the\r\n  standard of care.Â  The trial courtâ€™s â€œgood faithâ€ instruction directly\r\n  addresses this aspect of the case and, therefore, prejudiced Ardis.\r\nI disagree with the\r\n  majorityâ€™s reading of Sessionsâ€™s testimony as acknowledging that it would have\r\n  been malpractice to perform a manipulation on February 19 in light of Ardisâ€™s\r\n  reported injury that day.Â  Contrary to the majorityâ€™s reading, the record\r\n  indicates that Sessions believed the issue whether the actions alleged by Ardis\r\n  constituted negligence to be very much in dispute.Â  At the conclusion of his\r\n  case, Sessions moved for a directed verdict, arguing that, even assuming that\r\n  Sessions performed an adjustment, as Ardis claimed:\r\n\r\n  [t]here has been\r\n    absolutely no testimony in this case from [Ardisâ€™s expert] or anyone else that\r\n    if Ms. Ardis presented to Doctor Sessions on February the 19th in the condition\r\n    that she says that she was in, that there was any contraindication for Doctor\r\n    Sessions to give her an ordinary chiropractic adjustment on that day.Â  There is\r\n    absolutely no testimony that there was a deviation from the standard of care by\r\n    Doctor Sessions on February 19 in giving this lady an adjustment.\r\n\r\nWe simply do not know whether\r\n  the jury, in rendering a defense verdict, believed Sessionsâ€™s testimony that no\r\n  manipulation was performed on the day in question or believed Ardisâ€™s testimony\r\n  that a manipulation was performed, but found that to perform a manipulation\r\n  under the circumstances did not constitute malpractice.Â  In my opinion, the use\r\n  of the subjective â€œgood faithâ€ element in the jury instruction imposed an\r\n  unrealistic burden on Ardis in her effort to prove negligence, and the jury may\r\n  have found against Ardis due to her failure to meet such a standard.Â  See McCourt by and through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457 S.E.2d\r\n  603 (1995).Â  I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals.[5]\r\nWALLER,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Ardisâ€™ husband, William David Ardis, filed a loss of consortium claim.\r\n[2] Specifically, Sessions testified that on February 19 Ardis had\r\n  â€œparaspinal spasms.Â  We did some posterior pressure on the sacrum.Â  I diagnosed\r\n  it with a sprain strain and told her to rest and use some ice.â€Â  When Sessions\r\n  was asked if he had adjusted Ardis on February 19 or â€œdo[ne] anything that\r\n  would aggravate her if she had a ruptured disk[,]â€ he answered no.Â  Sessions\r\n  was additionally asked why he did not perform a manipulation of the â€œfull spine\r\n  or the cervical thoracicâ€ on February 19, as he had routinely done on prior\r\n  appointments.Â  Sessions replied, â€œher signs and symptoms did not indicate that\r\n  I should adjust her.â€Â  Those â€œsigns and symptomsâ€ included Ardisâ€™ being â€œbent\r\n  to the right sideâ€ and her claim of falling off a ladder.Â  In light of Ardisâ€™\r\n  reported injury on February 19, we view Sessionsâ€™ testimony as an implicit\r\n  acknowledgement that it would have been inappropriate to perform a full\r\n  manipulation on that day. \r\n[3] The trial court frequently used the term â€œphysician,â€ although this case\r\n  dealt with a claim of chiropractic malpractice.Â  There is no suggestion of\r\n  error in this regard, for legal principles concerning professional malpractice\r\n  claims generally remain constant from one profession to another.\r\n[4] The closing argument by Ardisâ€™ counsel is not in the record on appeal.Â \r\n  The record, nevertheless, leaves no doubt that the case turned on whether\r\n  Sessions performed a manipulation on Ardis on February 19.\r\n[5] In briefs and in oral arguments, both parties also addressed various\r\n  evidentiary issues from the trial court.Â  Because evidentiary holdings of the\r\n  initial trial are not binding on remand, I would find it unnecessary to address\r\n  these points. See Hosford v. Wynn, 26 S.C. 130, 1 S.E. 497, 499\r\n  (1887) (new trial opens anew all questions in the case).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Elizabeth Mason Smith","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2009-07-31-01","description":"This order places Elizabeth Mason Smith on interim suspension.","date":"2009-08-03","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of Elizabeth Mason Smith, Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n Respondent, the Beaufort County Clerk of Court, was indicted for misconduct in office and embezzlement of public funds.

Â Long Island is annexed into the City of Folly Beach. Â K&amp;A\r\n  purchased this property with the expectation that it would construct a\r\n  residential development on Long Island with approximately fifty to sixty home sites. \r\nBecause\r\n  there is no means of vehicular access to Long Island across Folly Creek,\r\n  K&amp;A sought to purchase a .42 acre parcel of property on neighboring Peas Island from Henry and Linda Walker (â€œthe Walker tractâ€). Â This parcel constituted a\r\n  portion of the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach toll road which originated in 1923 and has a\r\n  lengthy procedural history.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to 1923, the Folly Beach Corporation, which owned and developed a significant\r\n  portion of Folly Island, built a private road which:Â  started on James Island,\r\n  crossed Peas Island, bridged Folly Creek to Long Island, crossed Long Island,\r\n  extended from Long Island to Big Oak Island and Little Oak Island, and\r\n  ultimately crossed Folly River and ended on Folly Island. \r\nOn\r\n  March 16, 1923, the General Assembly created the Folly Roadway Company â€œfor the\r\n  purpose of constructing, maintaining, and operating a toll and turnpike road\r\n  from a point on Jamesâ€™ Island, in the County of Charleston, to Folly Island in\r\n  the said county, over the route of the existing road, causeways and bridges now\r\n  connecting said islands, with the right to charge tolls on said route as fixed\r\n  by law, and to erect one or more gates on said route for the collection of the\r\n  same.â€ (â€œ1923 Legislative Actâ€).Â  Act No. 288, 1923 S.C. Acts 557.Â  \r\nSubsequently,\r\n  the Folly Beach Corporation conveyed the existing road to the Folly Roadway\r\n  Company by deed recorded on April 13, 1923. \r\nAfter\r\n  two years of operation, the Folly Roadway Company decided to rebuild the road\r\n  and bridges and straighten the route of the toll road by extending the\r\n  causeway, which connected James Island and Peas Island, all the way to Folly Beach. Â The construction of this new route would eliminate a portion of the original\r\n  toll road which crossed Peas Island, Long Island, and two other marsh islands.\r\nBy\r\n  legislative act, the General Assembly authorized the Folly Roadway Company to\r\n  implement its plan to relocate the toll road.Â  Â Act No. 34, 1926 S.C. Acts\r\n  1441.Â  In order to finance the construction of the â€œnewâ€ Folly Beach Road, the\r\n  Folly Roadway Company issued $380,000 in bonds secured by mortgage of its\r\n  properties, including the property underlying the â€œoldâ€ toll road route, to\r\n  Citizens and Southern Bank of Savannah, Georgia. Â According to the Folly\r\n  Roadway Company, the project resulted in â€œpractically a new road with its\r\n  necessary bridges, causeways . . . connecting said Folly Island with James\r\n  Island, S.C.â€ \r\nOn\r\n  November 28, 1939, Charleston County offered to purchase the toll road.Â  The\r\n  Folly Roadway Company rejected the offer on the ground it refused to sell the\r\n  roadway for less than the amount due on its outstanding bonds.Â  Subsequently, the\r\n  bank securing the bonded indebtedness foreclosed on the Folly Roadway Companyâ€™s\r\n  property.Â  At the foreclosure sale, Charleston County purchased all of the property\r\n  owned by the Folly Roadway Company.Â  \r\nOn April 3, 1943,\r\n  the General Assembly authorized and directed the State Highway Commission\r\n  (n/k/a â€œSCDOTâ€) to purchase from Charleston County the â€œFolly Beach Road in Charleston County, to Free the Said Road of Toll Charges and to Authorize Charleston County to Sell Said Road to the Said Commission.â€Â  Act No. 64, 1943 S.C. Acts 85. \r\nAccording to the SCDOTâ€™s\r\n  records, there was no maintenance performed on the remnants of the â€œoldâ€ route\r\n  to Folly Beach which remained on Peas Island, Long Island, Big Oak Island, and then ran into private property.Â  These records also reflect that no portion\r\n  of the â€œoldâ€ route was ever assigned a number as part of the State Highway System.Â  \r\nNot\r\n  until 2002, did the SCDOT realize that it owned the property at issue.Â  At that\r\n  time, an attorney for the Walkers requested a quitclaim deed from the SCDOT to\r\n  remove a cloud on the title to their property.Â Â  The Walkers, while attempting\r\n  to sell their property, discovered that their house on Peas Island was located on top of a portion of the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road toll route.Â  \r\nBy quitclaim deed\r\n  dated April 3, 2002, the SCDOT conveyed to the Walkers the .42 acre tract of\r\n  land on Peas Island for consideration in the amount of $1.00. \r\nBecause\r\n  K&amp;A believed the â€œchief and most available means of access from Long Island\r\n  to Folly Roadâ€ was a portion of property located across neighboring Peas Island, it sought to purchase the Walker tract and to obtain regulatory approval for a\r\n  bridge connecting Long Island to Peas Island.Â  K&amp;A claimed the purchase of\r\n  the parcel was necessary to ensure a right of way from the residential\r\n  development on Long Island to the mainland.\r\nShortly after\r\n  K&amp;A purchased Long Island, Island Pointe, LLC (â€œIsland Pointeâ€) purchased Peas Island and obtained title insurance on the entire tract which included the Walker tract.[1]Â \r\n  After the City of Folly Beach approved the residential development of Peas Island, Island Pointe proceeded with its development plan. \r\nK&amp;A filed this\r\n  declaratory judgment action against Island Pointe, the SCDOT, and the City of\r\n  Folly Beach. Â In terms of relief, K&amp;A essentially sought for the trial\r\n  court to declare that the Walker tract remained a public right of way.Â  In\r\n  support of this request for relief, K&amp;A claimed the SCDOT did not abandon\r\n  the property and did not properly convey it to the Walkers.\r\nAfter a hearing,\r\n  the master-in-equity ruled against K&amp;A, finding: Â (1) the right of way\r\n  dedicated to the public on the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach toll road was transferred to\r\n  the â€œnewâ€ Folly Beach toll road, (2) the SCDOT properly abandoned the portion\r\n  of its property that once comprised the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach toll road, (3) the\r\n  SCDOT properly disposed of a portion of the property by means of a quitclaim\r\n  deed to the Walkers, and (4) it did not have jurisdiction to declare that a\r\n  public right of way still existed over the â€œoldâ€ route in question given such a\r\n  decision would deprive landowners along this route, who were not joined as\r\n  parties, an opportunity to protect their property interests.Â  The master-in-equity\r\n  denied K&amp;Aâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  \r\nK&amp;A appealed\r\n  the master-in-equityâ€™s decision to the Court of Appeals.Â  Pursuant to Rule\r\n  204(b), SCACR, this Court certified this appeal from the Court of Appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\nI.&nbsp; Should the court\r\n  enforce a deed that purports to convey a fee simple interest from the State to\r\n  a private party if the State did not â€œvigorously attempt to sell the property\r\n  by advertising for competitive bids in local newspapers or by direct\r\n  negotiationsâ€ as required by South Carolina Code Ann.

Â Id. at 38, 336 S.E.2d at 155. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAlthough\r\n  K&amp;A argues its issues in the above-listed sequence, we believe that in the\r\n  interest of clarity and logical progression the issues should be addressed out\r\n  of the â€œbriefedâ€ order.Â  \r\nWe find this appeal\r\n  essentially presents four questions:Â  (1) was the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach toll road\r\n  dedicated to the public; (2) if so, did the construction or relocation of the\r\n  â€œnewâ€ Folly Beach toll road effectively abolish the public easement on the\r\n  â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road; (3) if the public easement on the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach\r\n  toll road remained intact after the relocation, was it abandoned by the SCDOT;\r\n  and (4) if abandoned, did the SCDOT properly convey a portion of this property?[2]\r\nIn\r\n  short answer, we find the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road was dedicated to the public\r\n  and this public easement remained intact after the new road was created and\r\n  until the SCDOT affirmatively abandoned the route of the former toll road.Â  Additionally,\r\n  we hold the SCDOT properly conveyed by quitclaim deed a portion of this\r\n  abandoned property to the Walkers.Â Â Â Â  \r\nI.\r\nAlthough\r\n  K&amp;A agrees with the master-in-equityâ€™s finding that the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach\r\n  toll road was dedicated to the public, it contends the master-in-equity erred\r\n  in finding this was a â€œqualified public easementâ€ that ran with the toll road.Â \r\n  Because the right of way in the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach toll road was properly\r\n  dedicated to the public, K&amp;A claims it remained dedicated to the public\r\n  even after the Folly Roadway Company relocated the road and ceased operation of\r\n  the original toll road.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with K&amp;Aâ€™s contention.Â  For reasons that will be discussed, we find\r\n  the relocation of the â€œnewâ€ Folly Beach toll road did not abolish the public\r\n  right of way that was properly created in the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach toll road.\r\nâ€œThe essence of dedication is that it shall be for the use of the\r\n  public at large.â€ Â Safety Bldg. &amp; Loan Co. v. Lyles, 131 S.C. 542, 544,\r\n  128 S.E. 724, 724 (1925).Â  A dedication â€œmust be made to the use of the public\r\n  exclusively, and not merely to the use of the public in connection with a user\r\n  by the owners in such measure as they may desire.â€ Â Id. at 545, 128 S.E.\r\n  at 724.Â  \r\nApplying\r\n  these principles to the instant case, we find the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach toll road was unequivocally dedicated to the public.Â  Pursuant to the 1923 Legislative\r\n  Act, the General Assembly incorporated the Folly Roadway Company and authorized\r\n  it to operate the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road as a toll road.Â  Upon receiving this\r\n  charter, the Folly Beach Corporation conveyed the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road to the\r\n  Folly Roadway Company.Â  In turn, the Folly Roadway Company began operating the existing\r\n  route as a toll road and effectively dedicated the road to the public.Â  \r\nTwo years later, this Court explicitly recognized the Folly\r\n  Roadway Companyâ€™s dedication of the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road to the public.Â  In State\r\n    v. Olasov, 133 S.C. 139, 130 S.E. 514 (1925), this Court affirmed the\r\n  conviction of Olasov for trespass on the land of another which arose out of\r\n  Olasovâ€™s refusal to pay the toll on the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road.Â  Because Olasov\r\n  had purchased several lots on Folly Beach from the Folly Beach Corporation,\r\n  which included a â€œfree rightâ€ to use the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road, Olasov claimed\r\n  he did not have to pay the toll.Â  In affirming Olasovâ€™s conviction, this Court\r\n  found Olasovâ€™s easement to use the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road was terminated upon\r\n  the sale of the road to the Folly Roadway Company.Â  Id. at 144, 130 S.E.\r\n  515.Â  In a concurring opinion, one justice stated, â€œWhile unquestionably the\r\n  turnpike company has dedicated the highway to the public and the easement is a\r\n  public easement and not private property, the turnpike company still retains\r\n  the fee-simple title to the land.Â  The public has an easement to use the road\r\n  upon the payment of tolls provided for in the act incorporating the turnpike\r\n  company; that is, the public has a qualified easement.â€Â  Id. at 146, 130\r\n  S.E. 516 (Cothran, J., concurring).\r\nFurthermore, there is evidence in the record that the Folly\r\n  Roadway Company believed the toll road was dedicated to the public.Â  In its\r\n  Complaint dated July 22, 1940, in which it challenged Charleston Countyâ€™s condemnation action, the Folly Roadway Company specifically stated that the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach toll road had been dedicated to the public. \r\nII.\r\nBecause\r\n  the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road had been dedicated to the public, K&amp;A asserts the\r\n  master-in-equity erred in determining that the construction of the â€œnewâ€ Folly Beach toll road effectively â€œtransferredâ€ the original public dedication from the\r\n  â€œoldâ€ road to the â€œnewâ€ road. Â \r\nWe find the master-in-equity erred in concluding that\r\n  the public dedication was â€œtransferred by the changing of the route of the\r\n  road.â€ Â Given the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road was established as a highway and\r\n  dedicated to the public, the public right of way continued until it was affirmatively\r\n  abandoned by the SCDOT. Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  mere act of relocating the toll road did not have the effect of abolishing the\r\n  public easement created in the original route.Â  Although the Folly Roadway\r\n  Company may have vacated the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach route, this action did not\r\n  operate to eliminate the public right of way.Â  Thus, the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road remained dedicated to the public despite the relocation.Â  See 39A\r\n  C.J.S. Highways Â§ 128 (Supp. 2008) (â€œWhile the relocation of a highway\r\n  by the public authority may be sufficient to show the abandonment of the old\r\n  highway, such relocation does not automatically effect the abandonment of an\r\n  old easement.â€);Â  39 Am. Jur. 2d Highways, Streets, &amp; Bridges Â§ 148\r\n  (2008) (â€œOnce established, a public highway does not lose its character as a\r\n  public road unless it is either vacated by the authorities in the manner prescribed\r\n  by statute or abandoned.â€); see also A.C. McI., Annotation, What\r\n    Justifies Discontinuance of a Highway?, 68 A.L.R. 794 (1930 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2008) (noting that highways cannot be vacated unless they are useless,\r\n  inconvenient or burdensome and concluding that whether a highway should be\r\n  vacated, or discontinued, is determined primarily by considerations of its\r\n  necessity or public utility).[3]\r\nMoreover, this\r\n  Court has specifically found that once a toll road is dedicated to the public\r\n  the easement is not revoked upon cessation of the toll road operation.Â  Scheper\r\n    v. Clark, 124 S.C. 302, 312, 117 S.E. 599, 602 Â (1923) (â€œâ€˜The weight of\r\n  authority and sound reason concur in holding that, upon termination of the\r\n  franchise, the road [a toll road] remains as before, a public highway, wholly\r\n  freed from the burden of tolls.â€™â€ (quoting Allison v. R.C. Gravel-Road Co.,\r\n  39 S.W. 910, 913 (Mo. 1897))).\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nIn\r\n  view of our conclusion that the relocation of the original toll road did not\r\n  operate to eliminate the public easement, the question becomes whether SCDOT\r\n  properly abandoned the right of way.Â  See Hoogenboom v. City of\r\n    Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, 319 n.7, 433 S.E.2d 875, 884 n.7 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\n  (â€œA right of way created by dedication may be lost by abandonment.â€). \r\nAs we\r\n  interpret the trial order, the master-in-equity equated the term\r\n  â€œdiscontinuanceâ€ with â€œabandonment.â€ Â In his order, the master-in-equity states,\r\n  â€œabandonment or discontinuance of the â€˜oldâ€™ route was effectively accomplished\r\n  in 1926 upon completion of the â€˜newâ€™ road by the Folly Roadway Company pursuant\r\n  to legislative action.â€Â  Based on this belief, the master-in-equity concluded\r\n  â€œthis discontinuance operated as an affirmative abandonment in fact of the old\r\n  roadway.â€ \r\nAlthough\r\n  we agree with the master-in-equityâ€™s determination that the SCDOT abandoned the\r\n  old route, we disagree that the â€œdiscontinuanceâ€ or relocation of the route was\r\n  sufficient to constitute abandonment. Â The terms â€œdiscontinuanceâ€ and\r\n  â€œabandonmentâ€ are not synonymous.Â  See Marrin v. Spearow, 646\r\n  A.2d 254, 257 (Conn. App. Ct. 1994) (â€œâ€˜Discontinuanceâ€™ and â€˜abandonmentâ€™ are not synonymous terms as\r\n  applied to highways. Â A highway may be extinguished by\r\n  direct action through governmental agencies, in which case it is said to be\r\n  discontinued; or by nonuser by the public for a long period of time with the\r\n  intention to abandon, in which case it is said to be abandoned.â€ (citation\r\n  omitted)); Ord v. Fugate, 152 S.E.2d 54, 59 (Va. 1967) (noting that discontinuance\r\n  of public road should not carry the same effect as abandonment and stating\r\n  â€œunder the present statutes the discontinuance of a secondary road means merely\r\n  that it is removed from the state secondary road system. Â Discontinuance of a road\r\n  is a determination only that it no longer serves public convenience warranting\r\n  its maintenance at public expense. Â The effect of discontinuance upon a road is\r\n  not to eliminate it as a public road or to render it unavailable for public\r\n  useâ€); see also Wilson v. Greenville County, 110 S.C. 321,\r\n  325, 96 S.E. 301, 302 (1918) (recognizing that discontinuance of a public\r\n  highway and abandonment are two acts which are â€œseparate and distinct in fact\r\n  and in lawâ€). \r\nThe discontinuance of a\r\n  highway may be evidence of abandonment.Â  However, mere discontinuance is not sufficient\r\n  to prove abandonment.[4]Â \r\n  This conclusion is supported by our case law and our stateâ€™s statutory scheme\r\n  governing the procedure required for abandonment.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  our stateâ€™s case law, for a party to prove abandonment it must present evidence\r\n  beyond the mere relocation of a road.Â  See Wessinger v. Goza, 231\r\n  S.C. 607, 611, 99 S.E.2d 395, 397 (1957) (â€œIt is axiomatic that a public\r\n  highway is not abandoned simply because a new highway is built.â€).Â  Instead, a\r\n  party must â€œshow the abandonment by clear and unequivocable evidence.â€Â  Carolina\r\n    Land Co. v. Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 109, 217 S.E.2d 16, 21 (1975).Â  This Court\r\n  has explained the principles of abandonment as follows:\r\n\r\n\tâ€˜An abandonment occurs where the use for\r\n  which the property is dedicated becomes impossible of execution, or where the\r\n  object of the use for which the property is dedicated wholly fails. Â Any use\r\n  which is not inconsistent with the declared purpose of a dedication will not\r\n  support a charge of abandonment.â€™\r\n\tâ€˜Acts of\r\n  municipality. Â The rights of purchasers under a map and of the general public\r\n  cannot be lost by the unauthorized acts of the governing or controlling\r\n  officials of the municipality, or by their neglect, but only by legal abandonment\r\n  by the public as well as the officials.â€™ 26 C.J.S. Dedication s 63 at\r\n  page 552.\r\n\tâ€˜An easement created by dedication may be abandoned by unequivocal\r\n  acts showing a clear intent to abandon. Â To constitute abandonment, the use for\r\n  which the property is dedicated must become impossible of execution, or the\r\n  object of the use must wholly fail. Â Generally, a mere misuser or nonuser does\r\n  not constitute abandonment of land dedicated to public use.â€™ 23 Am.Jur.(2d) 57,\r\n  Dedication, Sec. 66.\r\n\r\nCity of Myrtle Beach v. Parker, 260 S.C. 475,\r\n  486, 197 S.E.2d 290, 295-96 (1973).\r\nTurning\r\n  to the instant case, we find the SCDOT offered evidence of â€œunequivocal acts\r\n  showing a clear intent to abandonâ€ the public easement.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  not dispositive, the Folly Roadway Company re-routed the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road.Â  After this relocation, the use and maintenance of the old road\r\n  significantly diminished because vehicular travel used the newly-created road.Â \r\n  Notably, after the relocation of the road in 1926, a one-hundred-foot private\r\n  right of way over Big Oak Island was granted to property owners on Long Island\r\n  as a means of access to Long Island from the â€œnewâ€ road.Â  That same year, the\r\n  Folly Roadway Company deeded to H.T. and Alice Ebner a portion of the â€œoldâ€\r\n  route from the end of Little Oak Island to Folly Island, which included the\r\n  bridge over the Folly River.Â  In 1986, the SCDOT also issued by quitclaim deed\r\n  to Harry L. Joye, Jr. and Cecelia Self a portion of the â€œoldâ€ route which\r\n  crossed Big Oak Island.Â  Significantly, the Walkers built their home over a\r\n  portion of the â€œoldâ€ route.Â  If the public right of way still remained on the\r\n  â€œoldâ€ road, then the above easement would have been unnecessary, the SCDOT\r\n  would not have deeded the property to the Ebners, and the Walkers would not have\r\n  been able to construct their home in that particular location.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the SCDOT properly abandoned the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road, which included the Walker tract.Â  Cf. Williams v. Woodward,\r\n  240 S.W.2d 94 (Ky. Ct. App. 1951) (holding that where the State Highway Department abandoned roadway and\r\n  relocated new highway, abutting property owners built fences around roadway and\r\n  otherwise obstructed it, and roadway had not been used to any substantial\r\n  extent by public for some years, the actions of the State Highway Department,\r\n  and of the abutting property owners and non-user by the public, constituted an\r\n  abandonment of the roadway); Hart v.\r\n    Town of Shafter, 810 N.E.2d 489, 491\r\n  (Ill. App. Ct. 2004) (â€œ[A]n\r\n  abandonment will be found only where the public has acquired the legal right to\r\n  another road or where the necessity for another\r\n  road has ceased to exist.â€); see J.E.M.,\r\n  Annotation, Alteration or Relocation of Street or Highway as Abandonment or\r\n    Vacation of Parts Not Included, 158 A.L.R. 543 (1945 &amp; Supp. 2008) (analyzing\r\n  cases and considering question of whether, or under what circumstances, a\r\n  change in a public way will work an abandonment, vacation, or discontinuance of\r\n  the former way to the extent of the change).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  once the public easement on the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road was abandoned, we find it\r\n  could not be essentially â€œrededicated,â€ as contended by K&amp;A, through\r\n  nominal use by two or three Peas Island landowners or the placement of\r\n  utilities during the 1970s or 1980s.Â  Â \r\n\r\nIV.\r\nK&amp;A argues the\r\n  master-in-equity erred in enforcing the conveyance by quitclaim deed from the SCDOT to the Walkers on two grounds.Â  Initially, K&amp;A claims the SCDOT\r\n  failed to comply with the statutory requirements of section 57-5-340 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code.Â  Even if the statutory requirements were satisfied,\r\n  K&amp;A asserts the language of the deed expressly subjected the transferred\r\n  property to existing easements. \r\nA.\r\nAs stated in the\r\n  deed, the SCDOT conveyed the property to the Walkers pursuant to the authority\r\n  established in section 57-5-340 of the South Carolina Code.Â  This section\r\n  provides in relevant part:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe department shall continuously inventory all of its real\r\n  property. Â When, in the judgement [sic] of the department any real estate acquired\r\n  as provided in this chapter is no longer necessary for the proper operation of\r\n  the department or highway systems, the department shall vigorously attempt\r\n    to sell the property by advertising for competitive bids in local newspapers \r\n\tor by direct negotiations, but in every case of the sale or transfer of any real\r\n    estate by the commission or the department, the sale or transfer shall be made\r\n    public by publishing notice of it in the minutes of the next succeeding meeting\r\n    of the commission. Â The commission and the department shall convey by deed,\r\n  signed by the Secretary of the Department of Transportation and the Deputy\r\n  Director of the Division of Finance and Administration, any real estate\r\n  disposed of under this section. Â Any funds derived from the sale of surplus\r\n  property by authority of this section shall be credited to the funding category\r\n  from which funds were drawn to finance the departmentâ€™s acquisition of the\r\n  property. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-340 (2006\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).Â  K&amp;A asserts the deed should not be\r\n  enforced because the SCDOT did not â€œvigorously attempt to sell the property by\r\n  advertising for competitive bids in local newspapers or by direct\r\n  negotiations.â€Â  \r\nK&amp;A\r\n  is correct that the SCDOT did not advertise for competitive bids on the Walker property.Â  However, we find this was not necessary to be in compliance with section\r\n  57-5-340.Â  As evidenced by the correspondence between the Walkersâ€™ attorney and\r\n  the SCDOT, there were â€œdirect negotiationsâ€ between the parties.Â  Because the\r\n  requirements for the SCDOT are written using the disjunctive â€œor,â€ we conclude\r\n  the General Assembly has authorized the SCDOT to sell surplus property either\r\n  through advertisement or direct negotiations.

Â Furthermore, as\r\n  testified to at the hearing before the master-in-equity, the SCDOT published\r\n  notice of the transfer â€œin the minutes of the next succeeding meeting of the\r\n  commission.â€Â  Accordingly, we find the\r\n  SCDOT sale of the Walker tract for consideration of $1.00 was sufficient to\r\n  satisfy the requisite statutory procedure.[5]\r\nB.\r\nEven assuming the\r\n  requirements of section 57-5-340 were satisfied by the means of conveyance,\r\n  K&amp;A contends a provision of the Walker deed identifies the existence of the\r\n  public right of way on Peas Island.Â  The provision relied on by K&amp;A states,\r\n  â€œThis conveyance is being made subject to any and all existing public utility\r\n  rights of user, reservations, easements, rights of way, control of access,\r\n  zoning ordinances and restrictions or protective covenants that may appear on\r\n  record or on the premises, other than those hereby released.â€ \r\nIn construing a deed, â€œthe intention of the grantor must be\r\n  ascertained and effectuated, unless that intention contravenes some well\r\n  settled rule of law or public policy.â€Â  Wayburn v. Smith,\r\n  270 S.C. 38, 41, 239 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1977).Â  â€œIn determining the grantorâ€™s\r\n  intent, the deed must be construed as a whole and effect given to every part if\r\n  it can be done consistently with the law.â€Â  Gardner v. Mozingo,\r\n  293 S.C. 23, 25, 358 S.E.2d 390, 391-92 (1987). Â â€œThe intention of the grantor\r\n  must be found within the four corners of the deed.â€ Id. at 25, 358\r\n  S.E.2d at 392. Â â€œWhen intention is not expressed accurately in the deed\r\n  evidence aliunde may be admitted to supply or explain it.â€Â  Id. Â â€œThe instrument is not thereby varied or contradicted but is explained or\r\n  corrected.â€Â  Id. Â â€œâ€˜A\r\n  grant of an easement is to be construed\r\n  in accordance with the rules applied to deeds and other\r\n  written instruments.â€™â€Â  Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation Dist.\r\n    of Fountain Inn, 348 S.C. 58, 71, 558 S.E.2d 902, 909 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n  (quoting 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 57 (1996)). \r\nApplying these established rules of interpreting deeds, we find\r\n  the property conveyed to the Walkers was not subject to a public easement.Â  As\r\n  previously stated, any public easement on the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road had been\r\n  abandoned by the SCDOT well before the 2002 conveyance.Â  Significantly, the\r\n  SCDOT did not even realize it had an interest in the property until the\r\n  Walkersâ€™ attorney requested a quitclaim deed.Â  Moreover, given the Walkersâ€™\r\n  home was built on top of the .42 acre parcel, it would have been nonsensical\r\n  for the SCDOT to reserve a public right of way over this property.Â  Additionally,\r\n  we believe the terms of the deed referencing a right of way constituted\r\n  â€œboilerplateâ€ language which did not specifically identify any right of way.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  we note the SCDOT issued a similar quitclaim deed to other Peas Island landowners in a 1986 conveyance, thus, indicating the absence of a public easement.Â  \r\nV.\r\nFinally,\r\n  K&amp;A argues the master-in-equity erred in concluding he was without\r\n  jurisdiction to find that a public right of way existed over the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach\r\n  Road given the other potentially-affected landowners were not joined in the\r\n  lawsuit.Â  K&amp;A avers this ruling was erroneous because a ruling that the\r\n  public right of way continues to exist would not disturb the property rights of\r\n  landowners on Big Oak Island or Little Oak Island. \r\nIn view of our\r\n  conclusion that the SCDOT abandoned the public easement on the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road, we need not address this issue.Â  See Hagood\r\n    v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 199, 607 S.E.2d 707, 711 (2005) (stating the\r\n  appellate court need not address additional issues when resolution of prior issue is\r\n  dispositive).\r\nIn any event, we\r\n  find the master-in-equityâ€™s conclusion was erroneous given the proper parties\r\n  were joined in the lawsuit.Â  Because the evidence indisputably established that\r\n  the public easement had been abandoned well before the 2002 conveyance to the\r\n  Walkers, the necessary parties to the lawsuit were only those who had an\r\n  interest in the specific .42 acre parcel.Â  Thus, Island Pointe, who purchased\r\n  the Walker property, as well as the SCDOT and the City of Folly Beach were the\r\n  only indispensable parties.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp. v. Hinson\r\n    Family Holdings, LLC, 361 S.C. 649, 655, 606 S.E.2d 781, 784-85 (2004)\r\n  (stating â€œDOT and the local municipality are the indispensable parties that\r\n  must be joined in an action to abandon a public roadâ€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  agree with the master-in-equityâ€™s ultimate decision to find the SCDOT abandoned\r\n  the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road and properly conveyed a portion of this property to\r\n  the Walkers.Â  However, we modify the master-in-equityâ€™s order regarding the analysis\r\n  of abandonment.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the mere relocation or â€œdiscontinuanceâ€ of the â€œoldâ€ Folly Beach Road did\r\n  not operate to abolish the previously established public right of way and to\r\n  transfer it to the â€œnewâ€ Folly Beach Road.Â  Instead, we conclude the original\r\n  public easement remained intact until the SCDOT affirmatively abandoned the\r\n  property.Â  Additionally, we hold the SCDOT properly conveyed the .42 acre\r\n  parcel at issue by complying with the statutory requirements of section\r\n  57-5-340 and issuing a valid deed to the Walkers.Â  Accordingly, the decision of\r\n  the master-in-equity is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The Walkers sold the .42 acre tract with an\r\n  additional 1.5 acres on Peas Island to Island Pointe for $2,000,000. \r\n[2]Â  We note the Respondents question whether K&amp;A has\r\n  standing to challenge the SCDOTâ€™s conveyance of the Walker tract and, in turn, Island\r\n  Pointeâ€™s ownership of the Walker tract.Â  Because this issue was neither raised\r\n  to nor ruled upon by the master-in-equity, we find it is not preserved for this\r\n  Courtâ€™s review. Â See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship,\r\n  359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (stating an issue cannot be raised for\r\n  the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate&nbsp; review). \r\n[3]Â  Although not expressly stated, section 57-5-120 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code supports this conclusion in that the SCDOT may abandon\r\n  a section of highway which is relocated.Â  This section implies that the SCDOT\r\n  must take additional steps to abandon a road beyond mere relocation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-120 (2006) (â€œThe\r\n  department may abandon as a part of the state highway system any section of\r\n  highway which may be relocated, and every such section so abandoned as a part\r\n  of the state highway system shall revert to the jurisdiction of the respective\r\n  appropriate local authorities involved or be abandoned as a public way. Â But\r\n  the department, in its discretion, may retain in the system any such relocated\r\n  section when it serves as a needed connection to the new section or when it\r\n  serves as a proper part of the state highway system.â€).Â  \r\n[4]Â  We note the existence of an old case which appears\r\n  to equate the term â€œdiscontinuanceâ€ with â€œabandonment.â€Â  However, we find the\r\n  case is distinguishable and the statement constitutes dicta.Â  \r\nIn Keenan v.\r\n  Broad River Power Co., 163 S.C. 133, 161 S.E. 330 (1931), a private\r\n  landowner brought suit to recover damages resulting from the defendantsâ€™\r\n  trespass.Â  Prior to the action, the defendants had acquired an easement over\r\n  the landownerâ€™s property for the operation of their railroad.Â  Because the\r\n  defendants ceased operation of the railway over this property, this Court found\r\n  the â€œdiscontinuanceâ€ operated as an â€œabandonmentâ€ of the right of way which\r\n  could not be revived.Â  Thus, the plaintiff was entitled to compensation for the\r\n  damages incurred by the defendantsâ€™ re-entry upon the property.Â  \r\nKeenan is\r\n  distinguishable from the instant case in that it involved a private right of\r\n  way.Â  Moreover, this Courtâ€™s statement regarding the two terms constituted\r\n  dicta given the â€œDefendants practically admit[ted] that they had abandoned the\r\n  right of wayâ€ even though they used the term discontinued.Â  Id. at 136,\r\n  161 S.E. at 331.Â  Thus, it was unnecessary for this Court to define or analyze\r\n  these two terms.\r\n[5]Â Â  Our decision should in no way be construed as\r\n  providing the SCDOT with â€œunbridledâ€ authority to convey public property to\r\n  private landowners.Â  We believe the facts of this case are unique and will not\r\n  recur on a frequent basis.Â  Moreover, the term â€œdirect negotiationsâ€\r\n  necessarily requires a good faith effort on the part of the SCDOT to procure\r\n  the best deal given the â€œfunds derived\r\n  from the sale of surplus property by authority of this section shall be\r\n  credited to the funding category from which funds were drawn to finance the\r\n  departmentâ€™s acquisition of the property.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-5-340 (2006 &amp; Supp. 2008).Â  In view of this\r\n  statutory provision, it is in the best interest of the SCDOT to receive the\r\n  most favorable financial return on its conveyance of surplus property. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26697","title":"Stalk v.

State, 375\r\n  S.C. 289, 652 S.E.2d 402 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  WeÂ  affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nStalk\r\n  pleaded guilty to twelve charges[1] and received an aggregate sentence of fifty years.Â  He took no direct appeal,\r\n  but filed a PCR application which was granted after an evidentiary hearing, the\r\n  PCR judge finding Stalkâ€™s plea counsel rendered ineffective assistance.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review that order.\r\nA claim of\r\n  ineffective assistance of guilty plea counsel requires the applicant present\r\n  evidence satisfying two prongs: first, evidence that counselâ€™s performance was\r\n  deficient; and second, evidence that the applicant was prejudiced by that\r\n  deficiency.Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985).Â  Plea counsel is\r\n  ineffective within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment only when the applicant\r\n  satisfies both requirements. Â Id.Â  In its opinion, the Court of Appeals\r\n  reversed, finding no evidence that counsel was â€œineffectiveâ€ or any evidence\r\n  that Stalk was prejudiced by counselâ€™s â€œineffectiveness.â€Â  In its analysis, the\r\n  Court of Appeals mislabeled as â€œIneffective Assistance of Counselâ€ the section\r\n  analyzing whether there was evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that\r\n  Stalk had shown plea counselâ€™s â€œdeficient performance.â€Â  We modify the Court of\r\n  Appealsâ€™ opinion to the extent that it confuses the requirement that Stalk must\r\n  show deficient performance, with the ultimate question: whether he has\r\n  demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel entitling him to PCR.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  Court of Appeals misapprehend the prejudice standard in a guilty plea\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel claim?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nStalk maintains\r\n  that, assuming that he has shown counselâ€™s performance to be deficient, in\r\n  order to obtain PCR he need only present testimony that but for that deficient\r\n  performance, he would not have pleaded guilty but would have insisted on going\r\n  to trial.Â  Stalk maintains that the question whether counselâ€™s deficient act(s)\r\n  of omission or commission would have led to evidence which in turn would have\r\n  affected the decision to plead guilty goes to the â€œdeficiency prongâ€ rather\r\n  than to the â€œprejudice prongâ€ of an ineffective assistance claim.Â  He therefore\r\n  argues the Court of Appeals in this case misapplied the ineffective assistance\r\n  of plea counsel test.Â  We find no error in the Court of Appealsâ€™ prejudice\r\n  analysis.\r\n\r\n\tIn Hill, the\r\n  United States Supreme Court explained:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWe\r\n  hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v. Washington test applies\r\n  to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  In\r\n  the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence\r\n  already set forth in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann\r\n    v. Richardson, supra.Â  The second, or â€œprejudice,â€ requirement, on\r\n  the other hand, focuses on whether counselâ€™s constitutionally ineffective\r\n  performance affected the outcome of the plea process.Â  In other words, in order\r\n  to satisfy the â€œprejudiceâ€ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a\r\n  reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, he would not have\r\n  pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\r\n\t\tIn many\r\n  guilty plea cases, the â€œprejudiceâ€ inquiry will closely resemble the inquiry\r\n  engaged in by courts reviewing ineffective-assistance challenges to convictions\r\n  obtained through a trial.Â  For example, where the alleged error of counsel is a\r\n  failure to investigate or discover potentially exculpatory evidence, the\r\n  determination whether the error â€œprejudicedâ€ the defendant by causing him to\r\n  plead guilty rather than go to trial will depend on the likelihood that\r\n  discovery of the evidence would have led counsel to change his recommendation\r\n  as to the plea.Â  This assessment, in turn, will depend in large part on a\r\n  prediction whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of a\r\n  trial.Â  Similarly, where the alleged error of counsel is a failure to advise\r\n  the defendant of a potential affirmative defense to the crime charged, the\r\n  resolution of the â€œprejudiceâ€ inquiry will depend largely on whether the\r\n  affirmative defense likely would have succeeded at trial.Â  See, e.g., \r\n\t\tEvans\r\n    v. Meyer, 742 F.2d 371, 375 (CA7 1984) (â€œIt is inconceivable to usâ€¦that\r\n  [the defendant] would have gone to trial on a defense of intoxication, or that\r\n  if he had done so he either would have been acquitted or, if convicted, would\r\n  nevertheless have been given a shorter sentence than he actually receivedâ€).Â \r\n  As we explained in Strickland v. Washington, supra, these\r\n  predictions of the outcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be made\r\n  objectively, without regard for the â€œidiosyncrasies of the particular decision\r\n  maker.â€Â  Id., 466 U.S., at 695, 104 S.Ct., at 2068.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHill, 474 U.S. at 58-59 (footnote omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals followed Hill when it engaged in a prejudice analysis\r\n  and found no evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that Stalk had met his\r\n  burden.Â  Stalkâ€™s prejudice claim rested on his assertion that his attorney was\r\n  so unprepared that Stalk felt coerced into pleading guilty.Â  We agree with the\r\n  Court of Appeals that to meet his prejudice burden Stalk was required to prove\r\n  more than the fact of counselâ€™s inattentiveness, which is the â€œdeficiency.â€Â \r\n  For example, Stalk needed to present some evidence that had counsel done an investigation\r\n  he would have found a witness or evidence that was helpful to Stalk, that is,\r\n  something that would have affected counselâ€™s advice to Stalk to accept the plea\r\n  bargain offered or that would have caused Stalk to decline to accept it.Â \r\n  Although appellate courts frequently â€œshort-handâ€ the prejudice prong in a\r\n  guilty plea ineffective assistance claim as â€œbut for the deficient performance is\r\n  there a reasonable probability that the defendant would not have pleaded guilty\r\n  but would have insisted on going to trial,â€ Hill makes clear that this\r\n  prejudice prong ordinarily requires more than simply a defendantâ€™s assertion\r\n  that but for counselâ€™s deficient performance he would not have pled but would\r\n  have gone to trial.Â  We find no error in this portion of the Court of Appeals decision.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BEATTY, JJ.,\r\n  concur.Â  KITTREDGE, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Seven counts of second degree burglary, four counts of grand larceny, and one\r\n  count of resisting arrest.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26698","title":"Duncan v.

Â The Galloway brothers appeal the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of their claims against SunTrust\r\n  Bank.Â  We find SunTrust Bank breached a duty owed to Cleo Galloway and reverse.Â  \r\nI.\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nIn June 2003, Frankey Galloway, aging and paraplegic, was admitted into a nursing home while\r\n  being treated for an illness.Â  Frankey had stored in excess of $250,000 cash\r\n  throughout his home.Â  Away from his home, Frankey was concerned for the safety\r\n  of his money and asked his brother Cleo Galloway to collect the money and store\r\n  it in a safe deposit box.Â  Cleo went to Frankeyâ€™s home, found the cash in the\r\n  locations Frankey described, and took it home where he counted it in the\r\n  presence of his wife and daughter.\r\nThe\r\n  precise amount of cash found in Frankeyâ€™s home was $253,843.Â  Frankey confirmed\r\n  to Cleo that the cash found matched his expectation of the stored cash.Â  Cleo\r\n  placed the cash in a safe deposit box at a Wachovia Bank branch in Pickens, South Carolina.Â  \r\nFrankey did not\r\n  approve of the selection of Wachovia Bank and so informed Cleo.Â  Cleo removed\r\n  the cash from the Wachovia safe deposit box.Â  Cleo took the cash to the home of\r\n  Avery, the third Galloway brother, where the two counted it once again.Â  Frankeyâ€™s\r\n  money was taken to SunTrust Bank[2] (the Bank) and placed in two safe deposit boxes.Â  Cleo and Avery were listed on\r\n  the safe deposit box lease agreements as co-lessees and were issued four keys,\r\n  two for each box.\r\nIn\r\n  August 2004, Frankey was released from the nursing home and Cleo and Avery gave\r\n  him the keys to the safe deposit boxes.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  November 24, 2004, Avery died.Â  In accordance with Averyâ€™s will, his stepson\r\n  Sammy Little (Sammy) and stepdaughter Betty Joy Iannazzone (Joy) were appointed\r\n  personal representatives of his estate.Â  Within a week of Averyâ€™s passing,\r\n  Sammy and Joy went to the Bank to ask if Avery had any accounts.Â  Sharon\r\n  Hamilton, a customer service representative, informed them that Avery and Cleo\r\n  were co-lessees of two safe deposit boxes.Â  Hamilton instructed Sammy and Joy that\r\n  if they wanted to access the boxes, they should get the keys from Cleo.\r\nSammy\r\n  made no effort to contact Cleo or otherwise obtain the safe deposit box keys.Â  A\r\n  few days later, Sammy informed Hamilton that the keys could not be located.Â \r\n  Relying on the â€œLost Keysâ€ provision in the lease agreement, Hamilton arranged\r\n  for the boxes to be drilled opened.Â  No notice was given to Cleo.Â  \r\nThe safe deposit\r\n  boxes were drilled open on December 1, 2004.Â  Present on December 1 were\r\n  Hamilton, Sammy and Joy.Â  Hamilton presented Sammy and Joy with the Bankâ€™s\r\n  forms entitled: â€œDrilling Certificate of\r\n  Inventory Affidavitâ€ and â€œInventory of Contents of Safe Deposit Box.â€Â  On the\r\n  drilling certificate form, the â€œlessee signatureâ€ line was left blank.Â  On the\r\n  inventory form, Sammy signed as â€œsurviving co-lessee witnessing the qualified\r\n  person making the inventory of the box.â€ Â Sammy\r\n  and Joy left the Bank with the cash from both boxes and absconded with the\r\n  money.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  February 2005, Frankey and Cleo went to the Bank to withdraw a portion of Frankeyâ€™s\r\n  cash.Â  Only then did Frankey and Cleo learn that the safe deposit boxes were\r\n  closed and that Sammy and Joy had taken the money.\r\nFrankey\r\n  and Cleo filed a complaint alleging claims against Sammy and Joy[3] as well as claims against the Bank.Â  The parties consented to try the case\r\n  before a Special Referee, who entered an order of judgment denying and\r\n  dismissing Frankey and Cleoâ€™s claims against the Bank.Â  Frankey and Cleo appeal\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of their claims.\r\nII.\r\nIssueÂ  \r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  Bank violate a duty to Frankey or Cleo Galloway by releasing the contents to\r\n  Sammy and Joy without notice to Cleo?\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nAn action to construe a contract is an\r\n  action at law.Â  Pruitt v. S.C. Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n,\r\n  343 S.C. 335, 339, 540 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001).Â  In resolving this appeal, we\r\n  must construe the lease agreement[4] between Cleo and Avery and the Bank.Â  Where a contract is unambiguous, the\r\n  matter becomes one of law and the partiesâ€™ intent as clearly set forth in their\r\n  agreement must be given effect. Â See McGill v. Moore, 381 S.C.\r\n  179, 185, 672 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2009) (â€œWhere the contractâ€™s language is clear\r\n  and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contractâ€™s force and\r\n  effect.â€).Â  Conversely, where a contract is ambiguous, the fact finder must\r\n  ascertain the partiesâ€™ intentions from the evidence presented.Â  Charles v.\r\n    B&amp;B Theatres, Inc., 234 S.C. 15, 18, 106 S.E.2d 455, 456 (1959)\r\n  (â€œ[W]hen the written contract is ambiguous in its terms . . . parol and other\r\n  extrinsic evidence will be admitted to determine the intent of the parties.â€).Â \r\n  â€œIn an action at law, tried without a jury, the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact\r\n  will not be disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably\r\n  supports the courtâ€™s findings.â€Â  Stanley v. Atl. Title Ins. Co.,\r\n  377 S.C. 405, 409, 661 S.E.2d 62, 64 (2008).Â  \r\nIV.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nA.\r\nThe\r\n  Bank first argues it breached no duty to Frankey, for Frankey was not a party\r\n  to the safe deposit box lease agreement.Â  We agree and affirm the trial court\r\n  with respect to Frankeyâ€™s claim pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR.\r\nB.\r\nCleo\r\n  asserts the Bank breached a duty owed to him under the lease agreement.Â  The\r\n  Bank counters that the lease agreement grants each co-lessee an absolute right\r\n  of access to the safe deposit box.Â  In this regard, the Bank contends a\r\n  personal representative of a deceased lessee has the right to â€œstand in the\r\n  shoesâ€ of the decedent.Â  The Bankâ€™s position has initial traction based on the\r\n  following general lease provision:\r\n\r\n\tCo-Lessees\r\n\tA\r\n  Box taken in the name of two or more Lessees, as co-Lessees, is under the\r\n  control of each of them as fully as if it stood in each Lesseeâ€™s name alone.Â \r\n  Either co-Lessee may have access alone, may surrender the Box and terminated\r\n  [sic] the Agreement, may appoint attorneys-in-fact to have access and/or\r\n  surrender the Box, and may cancel any such appointment made by either\r\n  co-Lessee.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  lease agreement, however, further provides explicit instructions regarding a\r\n  â€œlost keysâ€ situation:\r\n\r\n\tLost\r\n  Keys\r\n\tIf\r\n  Lessee loses one or both keys to the Box, Lessee shall notify Lessor\r\n  immediately.Â  Lessee shall pay all costs and expenses related to the loss of\r\n  any of the keys to the Box; specifically including, but not limited to, the\r\n  costs incurred in the following:\r\n\ti.&nbsp; If\r\n  Lessee loses one (1) of Lesseeâ€™s keys to the Box, Lessee shall bring the\r\n  remaining key to Lessorâ€™s office or branch where the Box is located so that the\r\n  Box may be opened and the lock changed.\r\n\tii.&nbsp; If\r\n  Lessee loses all of Lesseeâ€™s keys to the Box, the Box must be forcibly broken\r\n  and/or drilled open and the lock changed in the presence of the Lessee for\r\n  which the Lessee is responsible for all fees and charges associated with the\r\n  drilling.\r\n\r\nSignificantly,\r\n  the lease agreement specifies that â€œ[a]ll reference to singular shall also mean\r\n  plural.â€Â  When read in conjunction with the â€œlost keysâ€ section, we find that\r\n  the language of the lease agreement requires that all lessees must be present\r\n  when a box is forcibly opened or drilled.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  reject the suggestion of an ambiguity.Â  In any event, were we to entertain the\r\n  idea of an ambiguity, such ambiguity would have to be construed against the Bank\r\n  which drafted the agreement.Â  Williams v. Teran, Inc., 266 S.C. 55, 60,\r\n  221 S.E.2d 526, 529 (1976) (noting the rule of contract interpretation that an\r\n  ambiguous contract will be construed against the drafting party); Chassereau v. Global Sun Pools, Inc., 373 S.C. 168, 175, 644 S.E.2d 718, 722 (2007) (â€œ[A] court will construe any doubts and ambiguities in an agreement against\r\n  the drafter of the agreement.â€).\r\nMoreover, an ambiguity would allow resort to the Bankâ€™s own forms,\r\n  which are manifestly at odds with the Bankâ€™s position.Â  For example, the form entitled\r\n  â€œInventory of Contents of Safe Deposit Boxâ€ provides a signature block for a\r\n  â€œsurviving co-lessee.â€Â  That signature block expressly provides that the\r\n  signature of the â€œsurviving co-lesseeâ€ is â€œ[o]nly required if surviving co-lessee\r\n  and the qualified person are not the same person.â€ Â The Bank considered Sammy as the â€œqualified person,â€ yet\r\n  Sammy was permitted to sign as the â€œsurviving co-lessee.â€Â  Cleo, as the surviving\r\n  co-lessee, was entitled to notice and the right to be present at the inventory.\r\n  Â \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Bank that a personal representative has a right under law to\r\n  â€œstand in the shoesâ€ of the decedent to claim personal property. SeeÂ  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-3-709; 62-3-711; 62-3-715 (2009).Â  The more targeted question\r\n  is whether the statutory powers granted to a personal representative permit\r\n  greater powers than the decedent had when living.Â  We answer the question no.Â \r\n  Section 62-3-711(a) speaks directly to this in providing that â€œa personal\r\n  representative has the same power over the title to property of the estate that\r\n  an absolute owner would have.â€Â  Accordingly, while a personal representative\r\n  stands in the shoes of the decedent, the personal representativeâ€™s shoes are no\r\n  bigger than the decedentâ€™s.Â  Because Avery (as a co-lessee) could not drill the\r\n  safe deposit boxes without Cleo present, neither could Averyâ€™s personal\r\n  representatives.[5]Â  \r\nLastly, the Bank argues that it is protected by the â€œgood faithâ€\r\n  provision of the probate code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-714 (2009) (â€œA person who in good faith either assists a personal\r\n  representative or deals with him for value is protected as if the personal\r\n  representative properly exercised his power.â€).Â  We disagree.Â  Cleoâ€™s direct claim against the Bank is premised on his\r\n  contract with the Bank, not the propriety of the powers exercised by Averyâ€™s\r\n  personal representatives.Â  Because the\r\n  Bank breached the lease agreement, the statutory good faith protection is not\r\n  available.Â  \r\nV.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Frankey Gallowayâ€™s claim\r\n  against the Bank.Â  We reverse the dismissal of Cleo Gallowayâ€™s claim against\r\n  the Bank and remand to the trial court for a determination of damages.\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.\r\n  Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Frankey Galloway died during the pendency of this appeal and his personal\r\n  representative, Ann G. Duncan, has been substituted.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; At the time, SunTrust was known as Central Carolina Bank (â€œCCBâ€).\r\n[3]&nbsp; Frankey\r\n  and Cleoâ€™s lawsuit against Sammy and Joy sought to impose a constructive trust\r\n  upon them for absconding with the cash.Â  The trial court granted the relief and\r\n  in a companion appeal we affirmed the imposition of a constructive trust.Â  Duncan v. Little (Duncan I), Op. No. 09-MO-040 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 20, 2009).\r\n[4]&nbsp; We note that two safe deposit boxes were leased, but the Bankâ€™s standard\r\n  lease agreement applied to both.Â  Hence our reference to lease agreement in the\r\n  singular. \r\n[5]&nbsp; Had Sammy and Joy presented the safe deposit box\r\n  keys along with proof of their appointment as personal representatives of\r\n  Averyâ€™s estate, the lease agreement would have entitled them to access and\r\n  possession of the contents of the safe deposit boxes. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26699","title":"State v.

Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-25 (2003).Â  Although we affirm as to the first issue, we reverse the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s decision regarding the second issue.Â  Accordingly, we reverse Jonesâ€™s\r\n  convictions and sentences.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 2,\r\n  1996, the victims, John Pipkin and Susan Furman, were found dead in their West Columbia home by Pipkinâ€™s stepson, John Orr.Â  According to the autopsy, the victims\r\n  were killed by blunt trauma to the head, consistent with having been beaten\r\n  with a hammer and a piece of brick.Â  An investigation of the crime scene\r\n  revealed that approximately 700 to 1,000 dollars was taken from the home.Â \r\n  Investigators did not find any physical evidence other than a bloody boot print\r\n  at the scene.\r\nThe Stateâ€™s case\r\n  against Jones was primarily based on the testimony of Jonesâ€™s friend, roommate,\r\n  and self-confessed accomplice, James Brown.Â  According to Brown and other\r\n  witnesses, Jones was angry with Pipkin, his employer at the canteen where he\r\n  worked, because Pipkin had deducted an excessive amount from Jonesâ€™s paycheck\r\n  for snacks and drinks consumed on the job.Â  \r\nBrown\r\n  testified that he and Jones planned the robbery of Pipkin.Â  Brown claimed that\r\n  on the way to Pipkinâ€™s residence, Jones gave him a hammer and picked up a\r\n  brick.Â  At the residence, Jones identified himself to Pipkin, who proceeded to\r\n  open the door.Â  Once inside, Jones hit Furman repeatedly in the head with the\r\n  brick while Brown held her arms.Â  According to Brown, he hit Pipkin once with\r\n  the hammer and then gave the hammer to Jones who apparently bludgeoned Pipkin\r\n  to death.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  Brown confessed to his participation in the crimes and implicated Jones, he led\r\n  investigators to the hammer used in the murder.Â  \r\nAt Jonesâ€™s\r\n  first trial, the State relied on Brownâ€™s testimony and evidence that the\r\n  single, bloody boot print found at the scene was made by â€œsteel toeâ€ boots\r\n  which allegedly belonged to Jones.Â  In support of this theory, the State\r\n  introduced testimony that the â€œbarefoot insole impressionsâ€ left in the â€œsteel\r\n  toeâ€ boots were consistent with the boots having been worn by Jones.\r\nThe\r\n  first trial resulted in the jury convicting Jones of two counts of murder, and\r\n  one count each of first-degree burglary, armed robbery, and criminal\r\n  conspiracy.Â  He received two death sentences for the murders, concurrent\r\n  sentences of thirty years each on the burglary and armed robbery charges, and a\r\n  concurrent five-year sentence for conspiracy.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, this Court unanimously found that four errors in the guilt phase of the\r\n  trial each warranted the reversal of Jonesâ€™s convictions and sentences.Â  State\r\n    v. Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 541 S.E.2d 813 (2001).Â  Â Specifically, this Court\r\n  held:Â  (1) the defense was entitled to cross-examine Brown regarding his past\r\n  dealings with the solicitorâ€™s office; (2) â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence\r\n  was not scientifically reliable; (3) testimony that Jones was the prime suspect\r\n  in the investigation was not admissible; and (4) the trial court could not\r\n  change the reasonable doubt instruction after defense counselâ€™s closing\r\n  argument.\r\nPrior\r\n  to Jonesâ€™s second trial, the State informed the defense that it intended to\r\n  introduce â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence.Â  As a result, defense counsel\r\n  retained as a consultant William Bodziak, a renowned expert on this evidence.Â \r\n  Although the defense did not intend to call Bodziak as a trial witness, the\r\n  State subpoenaed him to testify at trial.Â  The State also retained Robert\r\n  Kennedy, another expert on â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence.Â  Kennedy had\r\n  testified for the State during Jonesâ€™s first trial.\r\nDefense\r\n  counsel filed two pre-trial motions seeking to quash the subpoena of Bodziak\r\n  and suppress the introduction of the â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence.Â \r\n  The trial judge denied both of these motions.\r\nUltimately,\r\n  the jury convicted Jones of two counts of murder, and one count each of first-degree\r\n  burglary, armed robbery, and criminal conspiracy.Â  Jones appeals his\r\n  convictions and his sentences on two grounds.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nJones\r\n  argues the trial judge erred in compelling William Bodziak, a Florida resident\r\n  who was a consultative expert for the defense on â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€\r\n  evidence, to testify for the State.Â  Because the defense did not list Bodziak\r\n  as a trial witness, Jones contends the Stateâ€™s subpoena to call him as a\r\n  witness violated the work-product doctrine, the attorney-client privilege and,\r\n  more importantly, Jonesâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of\r\n  counsel.Â  In support of this contention, Jones points out that the State had\r\n  retained its own expert witness, Robert Kennedy, a leading proponent of\r\n  â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence.Â  \r\nIn contrast, the\r\n  State claims the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in permitting Bodziak\r\n  to testify for the State given:Â  (1) Bodziak only testified during a pre-trial, in camera hearing; (2) Bodziak was not questioned regarding any matters\r\n  protected by the attorney-client privilege or the work-product doctrine; and\r\n  (3) it would be fundamentally unfair to the State for Jones to be allowed to\r\n  challenge the scientific reliability of the â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€\r\n  evidence while simultaneously withholding non-privileged testimony from one of\r\n  two internationally renowned experts whom the State initially contacted about\r\n  retaining. \r\nPrior\r\n  to trial, the judge conducted an in camera hearing on Jonesâ€™s motion to\r\n  quash the Stateâ€™s subpoena of Bodziak. Â Defense counsel informed the trial\r\n  judge that after this Court issued its decision in Jones I, the State indicated\r\n  its intention to introduce â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence during the\r\n  second trial of Jonesâ€™s case.Â  As a result, defense counsel retained Bodziak as\r\n  a consultant on the evidence.Â  Because the State declined to ship the crime scene\r\n  evidence to Bodziak in Florida, defense counsel arranged for Bodziak to review\r\n  the evidence at the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  Upon his arrival at\r\n  the Sheriffâ€™s Department, the State served Bodziak with a subpoena to testify\r\n  for the State at the trial of Jonesâ€™s case.Â  \r\nDefense counsel\r\n  told the judge that Bodziak â€œhas educated us as to what we need to know about this\r\n  field and he has helped us devise a defense strategy to contradict or rebut\r\n  this evidence.â€Â  In view of the defense relationship with Bodziak, defense\r\n  counsel claimed the enforcement of the Stateâ€™s subpoena would violate the\r\n  work-product doctrine, the attorney-client privilege, and Jonesâ€™s Sixth\r\n  Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. Â Counsel explained that\r\n  the Stateâ€™s actions had interfered with the defense working with Bodziak, the\r\n  trial strategy, and the custodial control of Bodziak.Â  Ultimately, defense\r\n  counsel claimed the defense would â€œloseâ€ its expert if Bodziak was permitted to\r\n  testify for the State. \r\nIn\r\n  response, the State prefaced its argument with the fact that there are only\r\n  â€œtwo world class experts in this area in North America, Robert Kennedy, who is\r\n  retired from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Bill Bodziak who is retired\r\n  from the FBI.â€Â  Because Bodziak had published a book entitled Footwear\r\n    Impression Evidence[3] after this Courtâ€™s decision in Jones I, the State claimed it needed to\r\n  call Bodziak as a witness to establish that â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€\r\n  evidence is now scientifically reliable.Â  The State assured the judge that it\r\n  did not intend to question Bodziak regarding any privileged communications with\r\n  the defense.Â  Instead, the State sought to elicit Bodziakâ€™s background,\r\n  qualifications, experience, and his opinion regarding the validity of the\r\n  science. \r\nThe\r\n  State also informed the trial judge that it had contacted Bodziak via e-mail in\r\n  October 2005 about potentially retaining him as an expert witness.Â  In his\r\n  response, Bodziak sent the State his curriculum vitae and a fee schedule.Â  When\r\n  the State contacted Bodziak again, he indicated that he had been retained by\r\n  Jonesâ€™s defense counsel. \r\nAfter\r\n  hearing counselâ€™s arguments, the trial judge denied defense counselâ€™s motion to\r\n  quash the Stateâ€™s subpoena of Bodziak.Â  In so ruling, the trial judge\r\n  characterized the factual situation as â€œuniqueâ€ in that it did not necessarily\r\n  involve the State seeking information that was clearly privileged or fell\r\n  within the work-product doctrine.Â  The judge concluded it was necessary to hear\r\n  testimony regarding the reliability of the â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€\r\n  science.Â  Thus, the judge found it permissible for the State to elicit\r\n  testimony from Bodziak in order to assist the trial court in its â€œgatekeeper\r\n  functionâ€ concerning the admissibility of this evidence. \r\nThe\r\n  judge, however, instructed the State not to question Bodziak regarding any\r\n  communication he may have had with Jones or defense counsel.Â  The judge further\r\n  prohibited the State from inquiring about any conclusions Bodziak may have\r\n  reached in analyzing the crime scene evidence. \r\nAn\r\n  analysis of the trial judgeâ€™s decision requires us to examine the rules and\r\n  theories underlying the disclosure of evidence in criminal trials.Â  Thus, we begin\r\n  with a review of Rule 5 of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure.Â \r\n  Rule 5(b)(1)(B), which governs the reciprocal disclosure of evidence by the\r\n  defendant, provides:\r\n\r\n\tIf the defendant requests disclosure under subdivision\r\n  (a)(1)(C) or (D) of this rule, upon compliance with such request by the\r\n  prosecution, the defendant, on request of the prosecution, shall permit the\r\n  prosecution to inspect and copy any results or reports of physical or mental\r\n  examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with the\r\n  particular case, or copies thereof, within the possession or control of the\r\n  defendant, which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence in chief at the\r\n  trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call\r\n    at trial when the results or reports relate to his testimony.Â  \r\n\r\nRule 5(b)(1)(B), SCRCrimP\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nGiven\r\n  this rule is limited to the defendantâ€™s disclosure of tangible material prepared by a defendantâ€™s agent, we recognize that it is not directly on point.Â \r\n  However, we believe it provides guidance for our decision.Â  Theoretically, this\r\n  rule operates to preclude the Stateâ€™s subpoena of Bodziak in that a defendantâ€™s\r\n  disclosure of evidence is limited to those items prepared by a witness â€œwhom\r\n  the defendant intends to call at trial.â€Â  Because Jonesâ€™s defense counsel did\r\n  not intend to call Bodziak as a witness, the logical extension of this Rule 5\r\n  provision would not authorize the State to subpoena Bodziak, a non-testifying,\r\n  consultative defense agent.Â  Cf. State v. Northcutt, 372\r\n  S.C. 207, 217, 641 S.E.2d 873, 878 (2007) (applying Rule 5(b)(1)(B), SCRCrimP\r\n  and holding the trial judge erred in requiring defendant to direct his expert\r\n  witness to generate written reports for the benefit of the prosecution).\r\nAt\r\n  least one other jurisdiction has adopted this analysis.Â  Commonwealth v.\r\n    Kennedy, 876 A.2d 939 (Pa. 2005).Â  In Kennedy, the Pennsylvania\r\n  Supreme Court addressed the question of â€œwhether a court can compel an expert,\r\n  who was originally hired by a criminal defendantâ€™s attorney in order to prepare\r\n  for the defendantâ€™s trial, to attend and testify at a defendantâ€™s trial, where\r\n  the defendant does not plan on calling the expert at trial or using any\r\n  materials that the expert completed as evidence at trial.â€Â  Id. at 945. Â Â \r\nGuided\r\n  by the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court resolved the issue by\r\n  extending the protections of the work-product doctrine beyond the disclosure of\r\n  tangible materials.Â  Id.Â  The court recognized that the rules generally\r\n  protect work product of agents hired by defense attorneys.Â  However, the court determined\r\n  that the rules did not specifically address whether the work-product doctrine\r\n  bars the prosecution from calling such an agent to testify at trial. Â Id. at 947. Â After discussing the general principles underlying the work-product\r\n  doctrine, the court concluded the same â€œholds true at trial regarding the\r\n  disclosure of the efforts of an agent retained by a criminal defense\r\n  attorney.â€Â  Id. at 948.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned\r\n  that to permit the prosecution to call an agent of the defense as a witness at\r\n  trial would effectively â€œcircumvent the purpose of the work-product doctrineâ€\r\n  and that of the rules of discovery in criminal cases.Â  Id.Â  The court\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tWhile we acknowledge that the protections of the work-product\r\n  doctrine traditionally have attached to the discovery of tangible materials\r\n  prepared in anticipation of trial, we find that when a criminal defense counsel\r\n  hires an agent in order to prepare for trial and does not plan on calling the\r\n  agent as a witness at trial or to utilize materials prepared by the agent as\r\n  evidence at trial, a practical application of the doctrine to trial in criminal\r\n  matters bars the Commonwealth from calling such an agent as a witness on its\r\n  behalf, unless the Commonwealth â€œfirst makes a showing of substantial need of\r\n  that testimony and [an] inability to obtain the substantial equivalent of that\r\n  testimony without undue hardship.â€Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 948 (quoting United States v. Walker, 910\r\n  F. Supp. 861, 864 (N.D. N.Y. 1995)).\r\nWe\r\n  agree with the philosophical underpinnings in Kennedy.Â  However, our\r\n  analysis would not be complete without reviewing cases from other jurisdictions\r\n  which have addressed the specific arguments raised by Jones.\r\nAside\r\n  from the Kennedy court, other jurisdictions which have analyzed this issue\r\n  have done so based on the following four theories:Â  (1) the traditional work-product\r\n  doctrine, (2) the attorney-client privilege, (3) the Fifth Amendment privilege\r\n  against self-incrimination, and (4) the Sixth Amendment right to the effective\r\n  assistance of counsel.Â  People v. Spiezer, 735 N.E.2d 1017, 1020 (Ill. App. Ct. 2000). \r\nWe\r\n  find the first three theories did not operate to preclude the trial judge from\r\n  compelling Bodziak to testify for the State. As previously discussed, the traditional\r\n  work-product doctrine generally protects defense disclosure of tangible\r\n  materials prepared in anticipation of trial by a defense agent.Â  In the instant\r\n  case, the State did not attempt to discover any materials prepared by Bodziak.Â  See Vitauts M. Gulbis, Annotation, Right of Prosecution to Discovery\r\n    of Case-Related Notes, Statements, and Reportsâ€”State Cases, 23 A.L.R.4th\r\n  799 (1983 &amp; Supp. 2008) (analyzing state cases which have determined\r\n  whether and under what circumstances the prosecution may be entitled to\r\n  discovery of notes, statements, or reports in possession of the defense).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  given the State did not attempt to elicit any confidential communications\r\n  between Bodziak and the defense or any inculpatory information from Jones, we\r\n  find the attorney-client privilege and Jonesâ€™s Fifth Amendment right were not violated.Â  See Morris v. State, 477 A.2d 1206, 1210-12 (Md. Ct. Spec. App.\r\n  1984) (holding trial judge, under the special circumstances of the case,\r\n  properly denied defendantâ€™s motion to quash prosecutionâ€™s subpoena of\r\n  defendantâ€™s non-testifying, consultative expert witness on the ground that\r\n  information gained by objective scientific analysis conducted by experts did\r\n  not violate the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine, or the\r\n  defendantâ€™s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination).\r\nIn\r\n  view of this conclusion, we find the only conceivable basis to challenge the\r\n  Stateâ€™s subpoena of Bodziak would be Jonesâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to the\r\n  effective assistance of counsel, the fourth theory.Â  Essentially, Jones is\r\n  claiming that the Stateâ€™s actions prevented defense counsel from effectively\r\n  representing him because the subpoena of Bodziak interfered with counselâ€™s\r\n  trial preparation and strategy.\r\nAt\r\n  least two jurisdictions have found, under similar circumstances to the instant\r\n  case, the prosecution could not compel a defendantâ€™s non-testifying,\r\n  consultative agent to testify on its behalf.Â  See State v.\r\n    Mingo, 392 A.2d 590, 581-87 (N.J. 1978) (finding trial judgeâ€™s decision to\r\n  permit prosecutorial discovery of report of handwriting expert retained by\r\n  defendant and use of expert as witness for the State improperly intruded into\r\n  zone of confidentiality essential to defendantâ€™s right to effective\r\n  representation of counsel but concluding error was harmless); State v. Dunn,\r\n  571 S.E.2d 650, 656-660 (N.C. Ct. App. 2002) (concluding trial judge erred when\r\n  it allowed the State to compel testimony of independent drug testing facilityâ€™s\r\n  employees who defendant did not intend to call as witnesses given this would\r\n  have violated the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance\r\n  of counsel and breached the work-product privilege).Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  we are persuaded by these decisions, we believe their holdings are not dispositive\r\n  in the instant case. Â As recognized in Mingo and Dunn, there is undoubtedly\r\n  a potential for abuse by the prosecution to compel a non-testifying,\r\n  consultative defense agent to testify.Â  If the prosecution is permitted to do\r\n  this, defense counsel may be hampered in preparing a defense in that counsel\r\n  may fear an unfavorable opinion by a defense agent will be utilized by the\r\n  prosecution.Â  Additionally, if the prosecution can â€œpilferâ€ the experts\r\n  retained by the defense, the defense will inevitably be put at a trial\r\n  disadvantage in that it will lose its expert witnesses.Â  Furthermore, because\r\n  defense counsel will be placed in the posture of cross-examining the expert\r\n  witness, we believe counsel may be reticent in pursuing certain lines of\r\n  questioning in the event the responses of the witness may â€œopen the doorâ€ to\r\n  privileged information.\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, however, we find the State did not violate any of the\r\n  above-outlined theories, including Jonesâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to the effective\r\n  assistance of counsel.Â  This case presents the extremely rare factual scenario\r\n  where the Stateâ€™s actions were permissible.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  there were only two available expert witnesses on the â€œbarefoot insole\r\n  impressionâ€ evidence. Â The trial judge recognized this anomaly and properly\r\n  limited the State to only eliciting non-protected information from Bodziak. Â See Mingo, 392 A.2d at 595 n.3 (â€œIn the rare case involving a subject as to\r\n  which the number of qualified experts is few, any danger that the defense might\r\n  deprive the State of expert assistance by â€˜scooping-upâ€™ all the available\r\n  experts in the field . . . can be prevented by appropriate judicial action.â€).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  the State only called Bodziak during an in camera hearing for the\r\n  benefit of the trial judgeâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of the â€œbarefoot\r\n  insole impressionâ€ evidence.Â  Because Bodziak did not testify during the trial,\r\n  the Stateâ€™s decision to call Bodziak as a witness could not have affected the\r\n  juryâ€™s assessment of the evidence, i.e., implicate that the defenseâ€™s\r\n  own expert approved of the Stateâ€™s assertion that this evidence was\r\n  â€œscientifically reliableâ€ and, thus, conclusive as to Jonesâ€™s presence at the\r\n  crime scene.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the Stateâ€™s questioning of Bodziak was confined to general testimony regarding\r\n  his expertise and his opinion regarding the scientific reliability of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Significantly, the State did not question Bodziak concerning the\r\n  specifics of the crime scene evidence.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we hold the trial judgeâ€™s decision denying Jonesâ€™s motion to\r\n  quash the Stateâ€™s subpoena of Bodziak did not constitute reversible error.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  caution, however, that our decision should not be interpreted as establishing a\r\n  general rule permitting the State to compel the testimony of a non-testifying,\r\n  consultative defense agent.Â  Taken to its extreme, we believe such a rule could\r\n  be used by the State as a subversive tactic to circumvent discovery rules. Â In\r\n  view of this potential for abuse, we limit this decision to the specific facts\r\n  of this case and now adopt a rule which we believe will effectively balance the\r\n  rights of the defendant and the interests of the State in future criminal cases.Â  \r\nIf\r\n  the State seeks to compel a defendantâ€™s non-testifying consultative expert to\r\n  testify on its behalf, the State must prove that it has a â€œsubstantial needâ€\r\n  for the expert and that its inability to compel the expert to testify will\r\n  present â€œundue hardship.â€Â  See Walker, 910 F. Supp. at 865\r\n  (concluding that â€œabsent a showing of substantial need and undue hardship,\r\n  the government should be precluded from eliciting testimony from the defensesâ€™\r\n  consultative experts concerning the efforts these experts undertook at the\r\n  request of the defendantsâ€™ attorneys, or the opinions and conclusions these\r\n  experts developed at the behest of defendantsâ€™ attorneys â€˜in the compilation of\r\n  materials in preparation for trialâ€™â€ (emphasis added) (quoting United States\r\n    v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238-39 (1975))).Â  This rule should alleviate any\r\n  concern that either side could potentially â€œscoop upâ€ or contract all available\r\n  experts. Â Faced with that situation, a party could undoubtedly establish both\r\n  prongs of the rule by showing that it could not present its case without the\r\n  assistance of the other partyâ€™s consultative expert.\r\nII.\r\nIn\r\n  light of our decision that the State was permitted to subpoena Bodziak as a\r\n  witness, the question becomes whether the trial judge erred in admitting the\r\n  â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence during the guilt phase of Jonesâ€™s trial.\r\nIn\r\n  his argument, Jones primarily relies on this Courtâ€™s opinion in Jones I.Â \r\n  According to Jones, this Court definitively held that â€œbarefoot insole\r\n  impressionâ€ evidence is not sufficiently reliable under Rule 702[4] of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence and this Courtâ€™s decision in State\r\n    v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999).[5]Â \r\n  Thus, Jones contends the State was precluded from even attempting to introduce this\r\n  evidence.\r\nIn\r\n  the alternative, Jones argues the evidence was inadmissible given the State\r\n  failed to prove any new developments which would deem it scientifically\r\n  reliable during Jonesâ€™s second trial.Â  Additionally, Jones avers the\r\n  prejudicial effect of this evidence outweighed any probative value pursuant to\r\n  Rule 403[6] of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.\r\nIn contrast to\r\n  Jonesâ€™s interpretation of Jones I, the State asserts this Courtâ€™s\r\n  decision did not operate as a bar to the admissibility of â€œbarefoot insole\r\n  impressionâ€ evidence in Jonesâ€™s second trial.Â  Because the State offered\r\n  testimony that research on this evidence had been completed and peer reviewed\r\n  subsequent to Jones I, the State claims it is now scientifically\r\n  reliable and, thus, admissible during Jonesâ€™s second trial.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  State asserts the probative value of this evidence substantially outweighed any\r\n  prejudicial impact. \r\nIn\r\n  analyzing this issue, we must initially define our intended holding in Jones\r\n    I.Â  In Jones I, Justice Pleicones, writing for the unanimous Court,\r\n  found the trial judge erred in permitting expert testimony â€œpurporting to\r\n  demonstrate that â€˜barefoot insole impressionâ€™ testing revealed [Jonesâ€™s] foot\r\n  to be consistent with the impression made by the primary wearer of the â€˜steel\r\n  toeâ€™ boot.â€Â  Jones I, 343 S.C. at 574, 541 S.E.2d at 819.Â  In so\r\n  holding, the Court found â€œthis â€˜scienceâ€™ unreliableâ€ based on an application of\r\n  Rule 702 and Council.Â  Specifically, the Court stated:\r\n\r\n\tWe find the evidence presented here\r\n  insufficient to meet the Jonesâ€™ requirements that: Â (1) the technique be\r\n  published and peer-reviewed; (2) the method has been applied to this type\r\n  evidence; and (3) the method be consistent with recognized scientific laws and proceedings. Â In our\r\n  opinion, it is premature to accept that there exists a science of â€œbarefoot\r\n  insole impressions.â€\r\n\r\nJones I, 343 S.C. at 573, 541 S.E.2d at 819\r\n  (emphasis in original).Â  The Court further found the quality control\r\n  procedures, as required by Jones, were not met to ensure the reliability\r\n  of this type of testing.Â  The Court recognized that neither SLED Agent Derrick,\r\n  who performed the test, nor any other SLED agent, had ever done this type of\r\n  test prior to Jonesâ€™s case.Â  Additionally, the Court noted that â€œAgent Derrick\r\n  admittedly had not conducted the testing in conformity with SLEDâ€™s quality\r\n  control precautions.â€ Id. at 574, 541 S.E.2d at 819.Â  In reaching its\r\n  conclusion, the Court further relied on the fact that there was no written\r\n  protocol in existence when Agent Derrick conducted his testing.Â  Id.\r\nBased on our decision\r\n  in Jones IÂ­Â­ and the lack of any subsequent research developments which\r\n  would validate â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence, we find the trial judge\r\n  erred in denying Jonesâ€™s motion to suppress this evidence.\r\nAlthough\r\n  we stated in Jones I that it was â€œprematureâ€ to accept this type of\r\n  testing, one of the bases for our rejection of this evidence was the fact that\r\n  Agent Derrick failed to conduct his testing in conformity with any established\r\n  written protocol.Â  As will be more thoroughly discussed, Agent Derrick\r\n  testified during Jonesâ€™s second trial that he did not conduct any new or\r\n  additional testing on the evidence since the first trial. Â Thus, the Stateâ€™s\r\n  failure to rectify this problem prior to the second trial operated as a bar to\r\n  its admission.Â  Even if our holding in Jones I did not initially bar the\r\n  State from introducing this evidence, we find the evolution of this evidence\r\n  post-Jones I has not deemed it scientifically reliable. \r\nDuring\r\n  the in camera hearing, the State called William Bodziak as its first\r\n  witness.Â  Bodziak, a retired F.B.I. agent, specialized in footwear and tire\r\n  impression evidence.Â  As part of his job, Bodziak also examined â€œbarefoot\r\n  insole impressionâ€ evidence. Â After his retirement from the F.B.I., Bodziak\r\n  continued to conduct these examinations and provided expert testimony in several\r\n  cases involving this type of evidence.Â  Following preliminary questions\r\n  regarding his background and training, the judge qualified Bodziak as an expert\r\n  in â€œbarefoot impressionâ€ evidence and, more specifically, in â€œbarefoot insole\r\n  impressionâ€ evidence.\r\nBodziak\r\n  testified he teaches a course on footwear impression evidence and requires his\r\n  students to read his book entitled Footwear Impression Evidence, which\r\n  includes a chapter on â€œImpressions of the Foot.â€Â  This chapter references\r\n  research articles that Bodziak relied on, which included those written by\r\n  Robert Kennedy, another expert retained by the State who was employed with the\r\n  Royal Canadian Mounted Police.Â  Bodziak informed the judge that both editions\r\n  of this book, a 1990 edition and a 2000 edition, had been peer reviewed prior\r\n  to and after publication.Â  However, he qualified this statement by saying, â€œIâ€™m\r\n  not aware of anybody thatâ€™s criticized what I have written in the book.Â  Again,\r\n  itâ€™s more of an informative chapter.Â  Thereâ€™s really not any controversy in\r\n  there for somebody to disagree with.â€Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  his testimony, Bodziak explained the methodology for conducting an examination\r\n  of suspected barefoot insole impressions where the person who wore the shoe is\r\n  unknown. Â He admitted that this type of testing is required in only a very\r\n  small percentage of shoe impression evidence.Â  He further acknowledged that\r\n  â€œabsent [some feature] so extreme and unique,â€ the methodology could not\r\n  produce a â€œ100 percent identificationâ€ as in DNA, fingerprint evidence, or even\r\n  â€œoutsoleâ€ evidence. \r\nBodziak\r\n  testified that he was â€œcomfortable with the reliabilityâ€ of his results but\r\n  stressed that with any forensic exam, â€œthere [are] two important components.Â \r\n  One of those is the science and the methodology, and the other is the\r\n  examiner.Â  And if either one of those fails, then you could have incorrect\r\n  conclusions.â€ \r\nIn\r\n  terms of specific changes to the methodology since this Courtâ€™s decision in Jones\r\n    I, Bodziak testified that neither Kennedyâ€™s recent publications nor his research\r\n  had â€œadded to or modifiedâ€ the methodology that Bodziak used in his\r\n  examinations. \r\nAs\r\n  its second witness, the State called Robert Kennedy, a forensic investigator\r\n  employed with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police between 1966 and 2006.Â \r\n  Beginning in 1989, Kennedy conducted research involving â€œbarefoot impressionâ€\r\n  evidence. Â This research involved establishing a database of barefoot\r\n  impressions in order to test the hypothesis that a barefoot impression is\r\n  unique to an individual.Â  According to Kennedy, â€œit was readily obvious that\r\n  the feet (of the one thousand volunteers) were unique enough that we could do a\r\n  comparison if and when we had the opportunity from the suspect.â€ \r\nAs a\r\n  result of this research, in 1994, Kennedy began working full-time conducting\r\n  footwear and barefoot impressions. Â He testified that he completed this\r\n  research in April of 2006.Â  During this time period, Kennedy was elected to\r\n  numerous professional organizations which specialized in forensics involving\r\n  footwear impressions.Â  He also published and presented articles concerning his\r\n  research, which included a 2006 article summarizing the results of his research\r\n  project.Â  According to Kennedy, this article had been accepted for â€œpeer review\r\n  publication.â€ Â After his background was established, the trial judge qualified\r\n  Kennedy as an expert in barefoot impression evidence and insole impression\r\n  evidence.\r\nIn\r\n  terms of the specific trial evidence, Kennedy concluded that â€œthere was support\r\n  to the hypothesis that Jeffrey Jones could have been the wearer of [the boot\r\n  that left the bloody print at the crime scene] or somebody that would have the\r\n  identical foot markings as Jeffrey Jones.â€ Â Although Kennedy re-examined the\r\n  evidence prior to Jonesâ€™s second trial, he conceded he conducted his examination\r\n  using the same methodology he used in 1998. Â He further admitted that since the\r\n  retirement of Bodziak, the F.B.I. no longer tested footwear for â€œbarefoot\r\n  insole impressionâ€ evidence.\r\nThe\r\n  defense called Dr. Donald Edwards, a professor and department chair at the University of South Carolinaâ€™s Department of Statistics. Â During his testimony, Edwards\r\n  indicated there were statistical problems with the â€œcomposition and methods of\r\n  selectionâ€ that were used by Kennedy and his colleagues in conducting their\r\n  research.Â  Specifically, Edwards believed it was a â€œleap of faithâ€ to apply the\r\n  results of a sample taken from Carlton University students to the general\r\n  population.Â  Because the â€œrandom sampleâ€ used in the research was not truly\r\n  representative of the general population, Edwards believed the results of the\r\n  research would not have any application to barefoot insole impression evidence.\r\n  Â Given the study involved barefoot impressions, as opposed to barefoot insole\r\n  impressions, and â€œthe measurements were not made . . . in the same fashion [as\r\n  barefoot insole impressions],â€ Edwards concluded the findings in Kennedyâ€™s\r\n  research article entitled â€œLarge Scale Statistical Analysis of Barefoot\r\n  Impressionsâ€ would be inapplicable to the situation presented in the instant\r\n  case. \r\nAfter\r\n  hearing this testimony and the brief arguments of counsel, the trial judge\r\n  stated that she wanted to hear testimony regarding the specific procedures\r\n  employed by SLED Agent Derrick.Â  \r\nThe State then\r\n  called Agent Derrick as a witness. Â Agent Derrick testified that in 1998 he had\r\n  a discussion with the State regarding Jonesâ€™s case.Â  Based on this discussion,\r\n  Agent Derrick relayed to the State information regarding insole impression\r\n  evidence.Â  He learned of this information after speaking with examiners from\r\n  the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.Â  According to Derrick, he discussed Jonesâ€™s\r\n  case with Kennedy.Â  Derrick testified that he collected and examined the\r\n  evidence in accordance with Kennedyâ€™s instructions. \r\nIn\r\n  terms of his testing procedure, Derrick admitted that the known tennis shoes of\r\n  Jones that he compared with the â€œsteel toeâ€ boots were a size 10.5 whereas the\r\n  boots were a size 9.5.Â  He further acknowledged that he did not get exemplars\r\n  from other residents of the house where the â€œsteel toeâ€ boots were seized\r\n  despite the fact that these people had unlimited access to Jonesâ€™s bedroom, a\r\n  bedroom which self-confessed accomplice Brown formerly occupied, admittedly\r\n  still spent a great deal of time in, and where he left another pair of boots on\r\n  the day of the murders. Â Derrick admitted that this was the first case of its\r\n  type for SLED. Â He also acknowledged that SLED did not a have a protocol for\r\n  this type of examination at the time he conducted the test. \r\nWhen\r\n  asked about any additional testing since Jonesâ€™s first trial, Derrick admitted\r\n  that he had not conducted any additional testing.Â  Instead, he stated that he\r\n  had re-examined the evidence in order to refresh his memory prior to the second\r\n  trial. Â He also acknowledged that SLED no longer performs barefoot insole\r\n  impression comparisons.\r\nAfter\r\n  Derrickâ€™s testimony, the State recalled Kennedy as a witness.Â  Although Kennedy\r\n  testified that Derrick did the testing in accordance with his instructions,\r\n  Kennedy admitted that these instructions were conveyed in a half-hour telephone\r\n  call. \r\nFollowing\r\n  Kennedyâ€™s testimony, the defense called two additional witnesses.Â  SLED Agent\r\n  Joseph Leatherman, a lieutenant with the latent print crime scene section, testified\r\n  that Major Joseph Vaught, the Assistant Director of Forensics for SLED, made a\r\n  written request for him to provide information regarding barefoot insole\r\n  impression examinations conducted at SLED since January 24, 2001.Â  In response\r\n  to this request, Agent Leatherman sent Major Vaught a copy of a 1999 protocol\r\n  developed by Lieutenant Tom Darnell and Agent Derrick. Â Leatherman testified\r\n  that his research revealed that five cases since 1999 had used this protocol\r\n  with the last case in 2001.Â  In terms of training, Leatherman testified there\r\n  was not any internal â€œtraining process for having someone trained to do this\r\n  kind of comparison testâ€ and no one at SLED was currently trained in this area.\r\nMajor\r\n  Vaught, the final witness, conducted a cost/benefit analysis of performing â€œbarefoot\r\n  insole impressionâ€ evidence testing.Â  Based on his research, Vaught concluded\r\n  that if this type of testing were needed then SLED would outsource it.Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  detailed oral ruling, the trial judge denied Jonesâ€™s motion to suppress the\r\n  Stateâ€™s introduction of â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence.Â  Initially, the\r\n  judge recognized that this state has not adopted the standards set forth in Frye\r\n    v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923) or Daubert v. Merrell Dow\r\n      Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).Â  Accordingly, the judge\r\n  analyzed Jonesâ€™s motion to suppress pursuant to Rule 702, Council, and Jones.Â \r\n  Primarily relying on the testimony of Bodziak and Kennedy, the judge found that\r\n  each of the requisite factors was met and, thus, the science of â€œbarefoot\r\n  insole impressionâ€ evidence was reliable.Â  The judge further concluded that the\r\n  probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudicial effect.Â  In reaching\r\n  these conclusions, the judge found that â€œthis testimony will provide the jury\r\n  with the technical analysis of barefoot insole impressions by utilizing\r\n  methodology and comparisons performed on the footwear which is outside of the\r\n  ambit of a layperson or lay-jurors[â€™] common knowledge of this subject or subject\r\n  matter type of analysis.â€Â  The judge further stated that â€œthe subjectivity of\r\n  the analysis would go to the weight of the opinion and not its admissibility.â€ \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Agent Derrick and Kennedy essentially reiterated the testimony they gave\r\n  during the in camera hearing.\r\nBecause our\r\n  research has revealed very few cases analyzing the admissibility of this\r\n  evidence, we do not believe there is a prevailing view or any particular case\r\n  that provides definitive guidance on this issue. \r\nAt\r\n  least three jurisdictions have admitted this evidence. Â Thiel v. State,\r\n  762 P.2d 478, 485 (Alaska Ct. App. 1988) (finding Bodziak could testify as an\r\n  expert in forensic foot morphology that the running shoes worn by the defendant\r\n  matched the impressions left at the robbery scene based on his comparison of\r\n  the insoles of the running shoes and impressions of the defendantâ€™s feet;\r\n  concluding that forensic foot morphology involves â€œno novel scientific theory\r\n  or techniqueâ€ and stating â€œ[a]lthough the comparison of insole wear patterns\r\n  and foot morphology may be a relatively rare field of expertise, the underlying\r\n  technique of physical comparisons is neither novel nor unacceptedâ€), abrogated\r\n    on other grounds by Matthew v. State, 152 P.3d 469 (Alaska Ct. App.\r\n  2007); United States v. Ferri, 778 F.2d 985 (3rd Cir. 1985) (holding\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony from physical\r\n  anthropologist that shoes found at the crime scene belonged to the defendants\r\n  based on a comparison of the insoles of these shoes with the defendantsâ€™ inked\r\n  footprints); cf. Hurrelbrink v. State, 46 S.W.3d 350 (Tex. Crim.\r\n  App. 2001) (applying Daubert and finding trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in admitting testimony of two anthropologists as to footprint\r\n  comparison and analysis of bloody sock footprint found at the crime scene to\r\n  that of defendantâ€™s footprint despite Kennedyâ€™s contrary testimony for the\r\n  defense); see James T. Watson, Annotation, Admissibility of Expert\r\n    Testimony that Item of Clothing or Footgear Belonged To, or Was Worn By,\r\n    Particular Individual, 71 A.L.R.4th 1148 (1989 &amp; Supp. 2008) (analyzing\r\n  cases in which federal and state courts have addressed the admissibility of\r\n  expert testimony for the purpose of establishing that an item of clothing or\r\n  footgear belonged to, or was worn by, a particular person).\r\nTwo\r\n  jurisdictions have rejected this evidence in cases where Kennedy was the\r\n  primary witness for the prosecution.Â  State v. Berry, 546 S.E.2d 145\r\n  (N.C. Ct. App. 2001) (discussing Jones I and finding it was harmless\r\n  error to admit testimony regarding â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence;\r\n  concluding â€œbarefoot impression analysisâ€ as presented by Kennedy was not yet a\r\n  reliable science at the time of defendantâ€™s trial); R. v. Dimitrov, 68\r\n  O.R.3d 641 (Ontario Ct. App. 2003) (referencing Jones I, rejecting â€œbarefoot\r\n  insole impressionâ€ evidence presented by Kennedy, and stating â€œ[i]n light of the\r\n  significant issues as to reliability of the evidence, its lack of logical\r\n  relevance and risk of distortion in the fact-finding process, the trial judge\r\n  erred in principle in admitting Sergeant Kennedyâ€™s evidenceâ€). \r\nCognizant\r\n  of these cases and our limited standard of review,[7] we find the evidence presented in the instant case does not satisfy the\r\n  requisite reliability factors in Jones.Â  As stated in Jones I,\r\n  these reliability factors take into consideration: Â (1) the publications and\r\n  peer reviews of the technique; (2) prior application of the method to the type\r\n  of evidence involved in the case; (3) the quality control procedures used to\r\n  ensure reliability; and (4) the consistency of the method with recognized\r\n  scientific laws and procedures.Â  Jones I, 343 S.C. at 573, 541 S.E.2d at\r\n  819.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the research of Kennedy and Bodziak has been presented and published, this does\r\n  not satisfy the requirement of â€œpeer review.â€Â  Significantly, Bodziakâ€™s own\r\n  book, Footwear Impression Evidence, discounts the technique.Â  In Chapter\r\n  13, Bodziak presents an overview of the types of footwear impression evidence.Â \r\n  In terms of â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence, Bodziak concludes:\r\n\r\n\tThere\r\n  have been many previously reported â€œidentificationsâ€ of a suspect as the wearer\r\n  of a shoe.Â  The consensus among experienced examiners is that identifications\r\n  are rare because the random individual characteristics necessary for an\r\n  identification are rarely encountered.Â  Although, in theory, random individual\r\n  characteristics could exist in a foot and be transferred to the shoe or foot\r\n  impression, those characteristics are normally not present nor are they\r\n  retained with the detail necessary to achieve an identification. Â \r\n\r\nIn view of this conclusion,\r\n  â€œexperienced examiners,â€ i.e., peer reviewers, have not accepted this\r\n  evidence as reliable.Â  Furthermore, Bodziakâ€™s own testimony casts doubt on the\r\n  reliability of this testing procedure wherein he stated it could not produce\r\n  â€œ100 percent identification.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  terms of prior application, the testimony revealed that Jonesâ€™s case was one of\r\n  the first cases where this procedure was utilized by SLED.Â  Significantly, the\r\n  procedure is no longer used by SLED or the F.B.I.\r\nRegarding\r\n  the third factor, this Court in Jones I found there was no established\r\n  protocol or quality control procedure in place for Agent Derrickâ€™s testing of\r\n  the evidence.Â  Agent Derrick admitted that he did not conduct any additional\r\n  testing prior to Jonesâ€™s second trial other than to re-examine the evidence\r\n  prior to his trial testimony.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the consistency of the methodology, Dr. Edwards, a statistician, testified\r\n  that the results from the research conducted by Kennedy and his colleagues were\r\n  a â€œleap of faithâ€ given the random sample used for the research could not be\r\n  applied to the general population.Â  Given the study involved barefoot\r\n  impressions, as opposed to barefoot insole impressions, and â€œthe measurements\r\n  were not made . . . in the same fashion [as barefoot insole impressions],â€\r\n  Edwards concluded the findings in Kennedyâ€™s research would be inapplicable to\r\n  the situation presented in the instant case.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we disagree with the trial judgeâ€™s finding that the probative value of this\r\n  evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect under a Rule 403 balancing test.Â \r\n  Although we agree that â€œbarefoot insole impressionâ€ evidence is outside the\r\n  realm of an average jurorâ€™s knowledge, the potential probative value of the\r\n  evidence is clearly outweighed by the prejudicial impact.Â  As previously\r\n  discussed, we find the evidence is not scientifically reliable.Â  In the absence\r\n  of scientific reliability, the evidence could only operate to provide\r\n  inaccurate and inconclusive information for the jury. \r\nAdmittedly,\r\n  this is a horrific case.Â  However, given the fact that investigators did not\r\n  find any physical evidence at the crime scene other than a bloody boot print, we\r\n  cannot employ a harmless error analysis. Â See State v. Reeves,\r\n  301 S.C. 191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990) (â€œError is harmless when it could not reasonably have\r\n  affected the result of the trial.â€). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision denying Jonesâ€™s motion to quash the Stateâ€™s subpoena of Bodziak.Â \r\n  Under the specific facts of this case, we conclude the Stateâ€™s actions did not\r\n  violate the rights of Jones.Â  However, we reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision\r\n  denying Jonesâ€™s motion to suppress the admission of â€œbarefoot insole\r\n  impressionâ€ evidence.Â  Because the State did not present any evidence in\r\n  Jonesâ€™s second trial to establish that this procedure is now scientifically\r\n  reliable, we hold the evidence should not have been admitted.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  reverse Jonesâ€™s convictions and sentences.[8]\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, KITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore,\r\n  concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that this case must be reversed because the\r\n  trial judge erred in admitting the â€œbarefoot insole impression evidence.â€Â  In\r\n  light of this reversible error, and the fact that this evidence will not be\r\n  admissible at a future trial,[9] I do not join the majorityâ€™s discussion of the Stateâ€™s right to subpoena the\r\n  â€œexpertâ€ originally retained by the appellant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  This Court reversed Jonesâ€™s original convictions and\r\n  sentence of death in State v. Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 541 S.E.2d 813 (2001)\r\n  (Jones I).\r\n[2]Â Â  In Jones I, this Court described this\r\n  evidence as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe central thesis of â€œbarefoot insole\r\n  impressionâ€ evidence is that the primary wearer of footwear, over time, begins\r\n  to leave an impression of the wearerâ€™s foot in the footwearâ€™s insole. Â Inked\r\n  impressions of the suspected wearerâ€™s feet, photos of the suspected wearerâ€™s\r\n  known insoles, and a standing cast of the suspected wearerâ€™s foot are compared\r\n  to the impressions in the boots, both visually and by using calipers to compare\r\n  distances between toes and other features among the various exhibits.Â  \r\n\r\nJones I,\r\n  343 S.C. at 572, 541 S.E.2d at 818.\r\n[3] Â William J. Bodziak, Footwear Impression Evidence (2d ed. 2000).\r\n[4] Rule 702 provides:\r\n\r\n\tIf scientific,\r\n  technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\r\n  understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as\r\n  an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify\r\n  thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\r\n\r\nRule\r\n  702, SCRE. \r\n[5]Â  In Council, this Court clarified the standard\r\n  governing the admissibility of scientific evidence, stating:\r\n\r\n\tIn considering the admissibility of\r\n  scientific evidence under the Jones standard, the Court looks at several\r\n  factors, including: Â (1) the publications and peer review of the technique; (2)\r\n  prior application of the method to the type of evidence involved in the case;\r\n  (3) the quality control procedures used to ensure reliability; and (4) the\r\n  consistency of the method with recognized scientific laws and procedures.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tWhile this Court does not adopt Daubert,\r\n  we find the proper analysis for determining admissibility of scientific\r\n  evidence is now under the SCRE. Â When admitting scientific evidence under Rule\r\n  702, SCRE, the trial judge must find the evidence will assist the trier of\r\n  fact, the expert witness is qualified, and the underlying science is reliable. Â The\r\n  trial judge should apply the Jones factors to determine reliability. Â Further,\r\n  if the evidence is admissible under Rule 702, SCRE, the trial judge should\r\n  determine if its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Â Rule\r\n  403, SCRE. Â Once the evidence is admitted\r\n  under these standards, the jury may give it such weight as it deems\r\n  appropriate.\r\n\r\nCouncil, 335 S.C. at 19-21, 515 S.E.2d at 517-18\r\n  (citing State v.

Weinberg, Jr. and Weinberg\r\n  and Brown, LLP after Petitioners disbursed\r\n  funds in which Moore claimed an interest.Â  The trial court granted Petitionersâ€™\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  The court of appeals affirmed in part, reversed\r\n  in part, and remanded.Â  Moore v. Weinberg, 373 S.C. 209, 644 S.E.2d 740\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007).Â  This Court granted a writ of certiorari to review that\r\ndecision.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent Moore and Clarence Wheeler\r\n  began a business relationship in the 1980s.Â  Over the course of their relationship,\r\n  the two men entered into numerous loan agreements, and in November 1999,\r\n  Wheeler approached Moore seeking to borrow money.Â  Wheeler informed Moore that\r\n  he was currently the plaintiff in a lawsuit which involved the sale of his\r\n  music business and that Petitioner Weinberg was representing him in the matter.Â \r\n  Weinberg had been Wheelerâ€™s attorney for approximately 30 years and had\r\n  represented him in numerous matters, in addition to the music business matter. Â Wheeler\r\n  further informed Moore that $100,000 had been deposited in an escrow account with\r\n  the clerk of court pending the resolution of the litigation and proposed using\r\n  the escrow funds as security for the loan. Â Moore then spoke with Weinberg regarding\r\n  the escrow account and the proposed loan agreement.Â  After Weinberg assured\r\n  Moore that the escrow account did in fact contain $100,000 and was pending upon\r\n  the resolution of the litigation, Moore agreed to loan Wheeler $80,000. Â Wheeler\r\n  executed a note to Moore for $92,000, which included a $12,000 built-in\r\n  premium.Â  Weinberg then prepared an assignment securing the note which provided\r\n  that: \r\n\r\n  Clarence\r\n    Wheeler does by this instrument assign to Joseph Moore so much of any recovery\r\n    that he may make from the debt owed to him by [the music business] and the escrow\r\n    account, which is pending as a result of said litigation, unto Joseph Moore.Â  \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Weinberg\r\n  settled the music business litigation on behalf of Wheeler for $100,000.[1]Â \r\n  After the clerk transferred the funds from the escrow account to Weinberg, Weinberg\r\n  failed to remember that the escrow funds had been assigned to Moore and\r\n  immediately disbursed $72,458 of the funds to Wheeler and retained $25,000 for\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  While Moore was out of town, Wheeler tendered $50,000 to Mooreâ€™s\r\n  son for payment of the debt.[2]Â \r\n  Moore later informed Wheeler the $50,000 payment did not fully satisfy the\r\n  note.Â  Accordingly, they signed a handwritten agreement on the bottom of the\r\n  note, which provided:\r\n\r\n  I, Clarence\r\n    Wheeler, agree that I owe Joseph H. Moore $80,000 since March 17, 2000 and\r\n    agree to pay him 6% interest on the $80,000 balance.Â  Clarence Wheeler paid\r\n    $50,000 on June 19, 2002.\r\n\r\nWheeler failed to pay Moore\r\n  in accordance with the new agreement.Â  \r\nMoore\r\n  filed claims against Weinberg for negligence, conversion, and civil\r\n  conspiracy.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Weinberg\r\n  because Moore and Weinberg did not have a â€œlegal relationshipâ€ and because it\r\n  found that the subsequent handwritten agreement contained on the note\r\n  constituted a novation.Â  The court of appeals held that the trial court erred\r\n  in granting summary judgment on the negligence claim because there was evidence\r\n  that Weinberg owed a duty to Moore.Â  Additionally, the court held the defense\r\n  of novation was not applicable in this tort action because novation is a\r\n  defense sounding in contract.Â  Finally, the court of appeals held the trial\r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment on Mooreâ€™s conversion claim because\r\n  Moore had a valid assignment to a portion of the escrow account and Weinberg\r\n  was on notice of the assignment.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted a writ of certiorari to review the following issue:\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    court of appeals err in holding that an attorney may be liable to a third party\r\n    for disbursing funds to the attorneyâ€™s client where the attorney was aware that\r\n    the funds were assigned to the third party?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and\r\n  it is clear the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Â Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the\r\n  evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence\r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Â Koester\r\n    v. Carolina Rental Ctr., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Negligence\r\nWeinberg\r\n  argues that the court of appeals erred in\r\n  reversing the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on the negligence claim.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIn a negligence action, a plaintiff must show that (1) the\r\n  defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff, (2) the defendant breached the\r\n  duty by a negligent act or omission, (3) the defendantâ€™s breach was the actual\r\n  and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury, and (4) the plaintiff suffered\r\n  an injury or damages.Â  Madison ex rel. Bryant v. Babcock\r\n    Ctr., Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 136, 638 S.E.2d\r\n  650, 656 (2006).Â  \r\nWeinberg\r\n  contends that allowing a cause of action against an attorney under these\r\n  circumstances will intrude upon the attorney/client relationship and greatly\r\n  hinder an attorneyâ€™s ability to represent his client.Â  In our view, Weinbergâ€™s\r\n  argument misses the mark.Â  Weinberg acted as the escrow agent and owed a fiduciary duty to Moore by virtue\r\n  of this role.Â  Therefore, it makes no difference that Weinberg was Wheelerâ€™s\r\n  lawyer and represented him in other matters.Â  Under the facts of\r\n  this case, the duty arises from an attorneyâ€™s role as an escrow agent and is\r\n  independent of an attorneyâ€™s status as a lawyer and distinct from duties that\r\n  arise out of the attorney/client relationship.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we hold that Moore presented evidence that Weinbergâ€™s performance fell below\r\n  the standard of care.Â  In addition to submitting an affidavit from an attorney\r\n  stating that Weinberg breached the standard of care, Weinberg essentially admitted that he was negligent in failing\r\n  to disburse the funds in accordance with the agreement by testifying that he\r\n  simply overlooked the terms of the agreement.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in granting\r\n  Weinbergâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the negligence claim.\r\nII. Conversion\r\nWeinberg argues that the court of appeals erred in\r\n  reversing the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on the conversion claim.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nConversion is defined as the unauthorized assumption and exercise\r\n  of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another\r\n  to the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.Â  SSI Med.\r\n    Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 498, 392 S.E.2d\r\n  789, 792 (1990).Â  Money may be the subject of\r\n  conversion when it is capable of being identified and there may be conversion\r\n  of determinate sums even though the specific coins and bills are not\r\n  identified.Â  Id.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Moore\r\n  alleged in the complaint that he owned an interest in the proceeds from the\r\n  litigation pursuant to the assignment, that Weinberg was aware of his interest\r\n  in the proceeds, and that Weinberg wrongfully disbursed those proceeds.Â \r\n  Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Moore, a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact exists as to the conversion claim, and the court of appeals\r\n  therefore correctly reversed the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision and hold that the\r\n  trial erred in granting Weinbergâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the\r\n  negligence claim and conversion claim.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and Dorothy Mobley Jones,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At the time of the settlement, the escrow account had earned $10,829 in\r\n  interest.Â  The settlement agreement provided that Wheeler would retain\r\n  $100,000, while the defendants would retain the $10,829 earned in interest.\r\n[2] Wheeler testified that he mistakenly believed that he owed $50,000 on the debt.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26700","title":"Sundown Operating v.

Blanchard, III, of Rosen, Rosen and Hagood, of Charleston, Peter F. Asmer,\r\n  Jr., of Cozen Oâ€™Connor, of Charlotte, and Susan C. Rosen, of Rosen Law Firm, of\r\n  Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This\r\n  action for negligence and breach of contract arises out of a fire that burned\r\n  down a restaurant and pub owned by Respondents Sundown Operating Company, Inc.\r\n  (â€œSundownâ€), Sunrise Coin Company, Inc. (â€œSunriseâ€), and High Noon Properties,\r\n  Inc. (â€œHigh Noonâ€) (hereinafter referred to collectively as â€œRespondentsâ€).Â  Respondents\r\n  filed suit against Defendant BFPE International, Inc. (â€œPetitionerâ€) and four\r\n  other defendants (hereinafter referred to collectively as â€œDefendantsâ€).Â  The\r\n  trial court granted a default judgment against Petitioner, and following a\r\n  damages hearing, the master-in-equity awarded damages to Respondents.Â  Both\r\n  parties appealed.Â  The court of appeals affirmed the trial court.Â  Sundown\r\n    Operating Co. v. Intedge Indus., Inc., Op. No. 2007-UP-091 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 23, 2007).Â  We granted in part Petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review that opinion.Â  Â \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nOn September 16,\r\n  1998, Respondentsâ€™ restaurant and pub burned down.Â  On August 24, 2001, Respondents\r\n  filed suit against Defendants, alleging that an electric fryer had\r\n  malfunctioned and ignited a quantity of frying oil.Â  Respondents had a service\r\n  contract with Petitioner to install, maintain, inspect, and service the\r\n  restaurantâ€™s fire extinguishing and suppression systems.Â  Respondents asserted\r\n  claims for negligence and breach of contract against Petitioner, on the grounds\r\n  that Petitioner failed to properly maintain and inspect the fire suppression\r\n  system.Â  \r\nPetitioner is\r\n  incorporated in Maryland and has various business locations in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.Â  At the time of the lawsuit, Petitioner\r\n  did not have a registered agent listed with the South Carolina Secretary of\r\n  State.Â  \r\nOn August 27, 2001,\r\n  Respondents mailed copies of the summons and complaint to Donald R. Leonard,\r\n  who was Petitionerâ€™s registered agent in Maryland and North Carolina at the\r\n  time, at two separate addresses in Myrtle Beach and Rocky Mount, North Carolina.Â  In Myrtle Beach, Petitionerâ€™s manager, Randy Adams, received the package\r\n  and was advised by the mail carrier that he could sign for Leonard, who was\r\n  absent.Â  Adams signed Leonardâ€™s name to the receipt, which was dated and\r\n  returned to Respondents on August 28, 2001.Â  In Rocky Mount, Leonard himself\r\n  signed the return receipt on September 4, 2001.Â  \r\nOn September 5,\r\n  2001, Leonard gave the summons and complaint to the general manager of Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  Clayton, North Carolina office, who then forwarded the papers to Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  vice-president.Â  On or about September 14, 2001, Petitionerâ€™s vice-president\r\n  notified Petitionerâ€™s insurance agent of the lawsuit.Â  On October 1, 2001, the\r\n  vice-president forwarded the summons and complaint to the insurance agent.Â  On\r\n  October 2, 2001, the insurance agent telephoned Respondentsâ€™ counsel to request\r\n  an extension of time to file an answer to the complaint.Â  Respondentsâ€™ counsel\r\n  informed the agent that he had already moved for an entry of default based upon\r\n  the August 28, 2001 service date.Â  On October 2, 2001, the Horry County Clerk\r\n  of Court filed the entry of default.Â  \r\nOn October 18,\r\n  2001, Petitioner filed a motion to set aside default and permit enlargement of\r\n  time.Â  On October 29, 2001, Respondents filed a motion for a default judgment. Â On\r\n  December 10, 2001, Respondents moved for, and the Horry County Clerk of Court\r\n  filed, a second entry of default based upon the September 4, 2001 service\r\n  date.Â  \r\nOn March 18, 2002,\r\n  the trial court conducted a hearing and found that Petitioner had shown good\r\n  cause to set aside the entry of default and permit an enlargement of time to\r\n  file an answer and instructed the company to submit a proposed order.Â  The\r\n  trial court based its ruling in part on the recent court of appeals decision in Pilgrim v. Miller, 2002 WL 44112 (S.C. Ct. App. Jan. 14, 2002) (Pilgrim\r\n    I).Â  The next day, Respondentsâ€™ counsel requested that the trial court\r\n  delay its formal order in light of the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision to rehear Pilgrim\r\n    I.Â  The trial court agreed.Â  On June 17, 2002, the court of appeals\r\n  reversed its original opinion in Pilgrim I.[1]Â  Pilgrim v. Miller, 350 S.C. 637, 567 S.E.2d 527 (Ct. App. 2002) (Pilgrim\r\n    II).Â  \r\nOn July 18, 2002,\r\n  the trial court again heard Petitionerâ€™s motion to set aside the entry of default.Â \r\n  The trial court issued an order finding the August 28, 2001 service date to be\r\n  invalid, but held that Petitioner was not entitled to set aside the entry of default\r\n  with regard to the September 4, 2001 service date.Â  \r\nThe case was then referred\r\n  to the master-in-equity for a hearing to assess damages.Â  The master entered\r\n  judgment in the amount of: $273,336.00 in actual damages to Sunrise;\r\n  $394,848.38 in actual damages to Sundown; and $524,800.70 in actual damages to\r\n  High Noon.Â  The master denied Respondentsâ€™ requests for prejudgment interest.Â  \r\nThe parties filed\r\n  cross-appeals.Â  The court of appeals held that Respondents were properly denied\r\n  prejudgment interest; that both the August 28, 2001 and September 4, 2001\r\n  service dates were valid; and that the trial court did not err in failing to\r\n  set aside the entry of default.Â  Both parties filed petitions for a writ of\r\n  certiorari with this Court.Â  We denied Respondentsâ€™ petition and granted in\r\n  part Petitionerâ€™s petition.Â  Petitioner presents the following question for our\r\n  review:\r\nDid the\r\n  court of appeals err in failing to set aside the entry of default?\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nThe decision whether to set aside an entry of default\r\n  or a default judgment lies solely within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  judge.Â  Harbor Island Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Preferred Island Props., Inc.,\r\n  369 S.C. 540, 544, 633 S.E.2d 497, 499 (2006).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of that\r\n  discretion. Â Mitchell Supply Co., Inc. v. Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160, 162-63,\r\n  375 S.E.2d 321, 322-23 (Ct. App. 1988). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\n  judge issuing the order was controlled by some error of law or when the order,\r\n  based upon factual, as distinguished from legal conclusions, is without\r\n  evidentiary support. Â In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 259, 495\r\n  S.E.2d 454, 459 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner contends\r\n  that it has shown good cause under the minimal standard required by Rule 55(c), SCRCP, and that the trial court and the court of appeals erred in applying a\r\n  heightened standard to conclude that the company was not entitled to set aside\r\n  the entry of default.Â  Although we have some concerns about the lower courtsâ€™ conflation\r\n  of the Rule 60(b) and Rule 55(c) standards, we do not believe Petitioner meets\r\n  even the most minimal showing of good cause, and is therefore not entitled to\r\n  relief from the entry of default.Â Â Â  \r\nI.Â  Differentiating the\r\n  Standards for Relief Under Rule 55(c) and Rule 60(b)\r\nWe must acknowledge at the outset that there has been some recent\r\n  confusion in the case law regarding the application of the standards for relief\r\n  set forth in Rule 55(c) and Rule 60(b).Â  We take this opportunity to reassert\r\n  the basic legal premise that the standard for granting relief under Rule 60(b)\r\n  is more rigorous than under Rule 55(c), and that an entry of default may be set\r\n  aside for reasons that would be insufficient to relieve a party from a default\r\n  judgment.\r\nRule 55(a) provides that when a party fails to respond to a complaint,\r\n  the clerk shall record an entry of default.Â  However, Rule 55(c) permits a\r\n  party to move to set aside the entry of default. Â The standard for granting\r\n  relief from an entry of default under Rule 55(c) is mere â€œgood cause.â€ Â Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  This\r\n  standard requires a party seeking relief from an entry of default under Rule\r\n  55(c) to provide an explanation for the default and give reasons why vacation\r\n  of the default entry would serve the interests of justice.Â  Once a party has\r\n  put forth a satisfactory explanation for the default, the trial court must also\r\n  consider: (1) the timing of the motion for relief; (2) whether\r\n  the defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3) the degree of prejudice to the\r\n  plaintiff if relief is granted. Â Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc.,\r\n  298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 501-02 (Ct. App. 1989). Â The trial court\r\n  need not make specific findings of fact for each factor if there is sufficient\r\n  evidentiary support on the record for the finding of the lack of good cause.Â  Dixon v. Besco Engineering, Inc., 320 S.C. 174, 179, 463 S.E. 2d 636, 639\r\n  (Ct. App. 1995).Â  A motion under Rule 55(c) is addressed to the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court. Â Williams v. Stalnaker, 312 S.C. 373,\r\n  375, 440 S.E.2d 408, 409 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Â \r\nOnce a default judgment has been entered, a party seeking to be\r\n  relieved must do so under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  The standard for granting relief\r\n  from a default judgment under Rule 60(b) is more rigorous than the â€œgood causeâ€\r\n  standard established in Rule 55(c).Â  Ricks v. Weinrauch, 293 S.C. 372,\r\n  374, 360 S.E.2d 535, 536 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Rule 60(b) requires a more\r\n  particularized showing of mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, surprise,\r\n  newly discovered evidence, fraud, misrepresentation, or â€œother misconduct of an\r\n  adverse party.â€Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  The different standards under the two\r\n  rules underscore the clear intent to make it more difficult for a party to\r\n  avoid a default once the court has entered a judgment, which carries greater\r\n  finality, and often occurs later than, a clerkâ€™s entry of default.Â  \r\nIt is often observed, as the court of appeals held in the present case,\r\n  that the criteria for obtaining relief from judgment under Rule 60(b) -\r\n  mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, surprise, newly discovered evidence,\r\n  fraud, misrepresentation - are relevant in determining whether good cause has\r\n  been shown under Rule 55(c), SCRCP. Â See New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Bey Corp.,\r\n  312 S.C. 47, 50, 435 S.E.2d 377, 378-79 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding that, â€œas a\r\n  practical matter,â€ the 60(b) factors are relevant under both rules).Â  However,\r\n  we caution that this language invites trial courts to apply a heightened\r\n  standard to Rule 55(c) motions.Â  The Rule 60(b) factors are indeed relevant to\r\n  a Rule 55(c) analysis, but only insomuch as proof of any one of these factors\r\n  is sufficient to show â€œgood cause.â€Â  No trial court should ever find good cause\r\n  lacking based solely on the absence of a Rule 60(b) factor.Â  \r\nII.Â  The\r\n  Merits of Petitionerâ€™s Appeal\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that the trial judge should have set aside the entry of default because the\r\n  company showed â€œgood causeâ€ by asserting its insurance agent was negligent for\r\n  failing to answer the complaint and because (1) it promptly moved for relief;\r\n  (2) it has a meritorious defense; and (3) Respondents would suffer no prejudice\r\n  if the court set aside the entry of default.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we reject Petitionerâ€™s argument that it should be granted relief from the entry\r\n  of default because it should not be held responsible for the negligence of its\r\n  insurance agent in failing to answer the complaint.Â  This argument is without\r\n  merit, as the law is clear that an attorney or insurance companyâ€™s misconduct\r\n  is imputable to the client.Â  See Williams v. Vanvolkenburg, 312 S.C.\r\n  373, 375, 440 S.E.2d 408, 409 (Ct. App. 1994) (observing that an attorneyâ€™s\r\n  negligence in failing to answer is imputable to the defendant); Roberts v.\r\n    Peterson, 292 S.C. 149, 151, 355 S.E.2d 280, 281 (Ct. App. 1987) (recognizing\r\n  that negligence of an attorney or insurance company is imputable to a\r\n  defaulting litigant).Â  Although the presence of other factors, in the totality\r\n  of the circumstances, may amount to a showing of â€œgood cause,â€ a defendant may\r\n  not be relieved from the entry of default solely because it relied to\r\n  its detriment on a negligent insurance agent.Â  See Ricks, 293 S.C. 372,\r\n  360 S.E.2d 535 (holding that good cause was shown in the totality of\r\n  circumstances involving misplaced reliance on insurance agent).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Petitioner shares the responsibility for the entry of default with\r\n  its insurance agent.Â  Petitioner did not forward the summons and complaint to\r\n  the insurance agent until approximately two weeks after initially notifying the\r\n  agent of the lawsuit and several days after the time to answer expired.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Petitionerâ€™s â€œgood causeâ€ argument is based entirely upon the\r\n  September 4, 2001 service date.Â  Petitioner has put forth no explanation with\r\n  regard to the fate of the summons and complaint served on Randy Adams on August\r\n  28, 2001.Â  As the court of appeals correctly held, this service was proper\r\n  pursuant to Roche v. Young Bros., Inc. of Florence, 318 S.C. 207, 456\r\n  S.E.2d 897 (1995).[2]Â \r\n  Even if we were to assume that Petitioner showed good cause as to why the\r\n  summons and complaint that arrived in Rocky Mount was not answered in a timely\r\n  manner, we must nevertheless affirm the entry of default because Petitioner has\r\n  failed to show good cause as to why the summons and complaint that arrived in Myrtle Beach went unanswered. \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the reasons\r\n  stated herein, we affirm the opinion of the court of appeals.Â  \r\nWALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justices R. Knox McMahon and E.\r\n  C. Burnett, III, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although the Pilgrim II opinion was vacated by this Court on April 25,\r\n  2003, the court of appeals in the instant case observed that the portions\r\n  relied upon by the trial judge are â€œstill good law.â€Â  See Bage v.

Did the trial court err in denying Gilbertâ€™s motion\r\n  for directed verdict?\r\nGilbert\r\n  contends that the evidence does not support classification of Lane as an\r\n  invitee and instead only supports classification as a licensee or trespasser.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Gilbert argues that there is no evidence to show a breach of the\r\n  landownerâ€™s duty to a licensee or trespasser and therefore, Gilbert is entitled\r\n  to a directed verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  motion for directed verdict goes to the entire case and may be granted only\r\n  when the evidence raises no issue for the jury as to liability.â€ Ecclesiastes\r\n    Production Ministries v. Outparcel Assoc., LLC, 374 S.C. 483, 490, 649\r\n  S.E.2d 494, 497 (Ct. App. 2007), citing Carolina Home Builders, Inc.\r\n    v. Armstrong Furnace Co., 259 S.C. 346, 358, 191 S.E.2d 774, 779 (1972).Â  \r\nâ€œUnder\r\n  a premises liability theory, a contractor generally equates to an invitor and\r\n  assumes the same duties that the landowner has, including the duty to warn of\r\n  dangers or defects known to him but unknown to others.â€ Larimore v. Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 448, 531 S.E.2d 535, 540 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nThe\r\n  trial court classified Lane as an â€œinvitee.â€Â  An invitee is a person â€œwho\r\n  enters onto the property of another by express or implied invitation, his entry\r\n  is connected with the ownerâ€™s business or with an activity the owner conducts\r\n  or permits to be conducted on his land, and there is a mutuality of benefit or\r\n  a benefit to the owner.â€ Singleton v. Sherer, 377 S.C. 185, 199, 659\r\n  S.E.2d 196, 204 (Ct. App. 2008), quoting Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C.\r\n  708, 716-17, 541 S.E.2d 857, 862 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nGilbert\r\n  contends that Lane was not an invitee because he had no consent, either express\r\n  or implied, to be in the courtyard and because his presence in the courtyard\r\n  was not to the interest or advantage of Gilbert.Â  We find that there was at\r\n  least implied consent to use the area since it was immediately outside of an\r\n  emergency exit.Â  Moreover, Lane was at least partly benefiting Gilbert by\r\n  attempting to have the switchboard disable the automatic alert to the fire\r\n  department.Â  Lane testified that the fire alarm repeatedly sounded during his\r\n  shift.Â  Each time the alarm sounded, the alarm system automatically notified\r\n  the fire department.Â  By instructing the switchboard to place the system in\r\n  â€œtestâ€ mode, Lane could ensure that the business of both the Hospital and\r\n  Gilbert would not be repeatedly interrupted by the sounding of the alarm,\r\n  unnecessary evacuations, and arrival of fire department personnel.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  even if Lane did not provide a benefit to Gilbert, Gilbert would not be\r\n  entitled to a directed verdict if Lane were classified as a licensee.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  licensee is a person who is privileged to enter upon land by virtue of the\r\n  possessorâ€™s consent.â€ Neil v. Byrum, 288 S.C. 472, 473, 343 S.E.2d 615,\r\n  616 (1986).Â  â€œWhen a licensee enters onto the property of another, the primary\r\n  benefit is to the licensee, not the property owner.â€ Singleton, 377 S.C.\r\n  at 198, 659 S.E.2d at 203.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  landowner owes a licensee a duty to use reasonable care to discover the\r\n  licensee, to conduct activities on the land so as not to harm the licensee, and\r\n  to warn the licensee of any concealed dangerous conditions or activities.â€Â  Singleton,\r\n  377 S.C. at 201, 659 S.E.2d at 204.Â  In our view, the evidence presented at\r\n  trial raised a jury question as to whether or not Gilbert met the duty owed to\r\n  Lane as a licensee.Â  Therefore, even assuming Lane was a licensee, the trial\r\n  judge did not err in denying the motion for a directed verdict.Â  See Ecclesiastes\r\n    Production Ministries, supra.\r\nWe\r\n  find that the trial court properly classified Lane as an invitee.Â  Moreover,\r\n  even assuming Lane is not an invitee, Gilbert would not be entitled to a\r\n  directed verdict.Â  Consequently, the trial judge did not err in denying\r\n  Gilbertâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.\r\nII. Did the trial court\r\n  err in granting a new trial?\r\nGilbert\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in granting Lane a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina, a trial judge may grant a new trial following a jury verdict under the\r\n  Thirteenth Juror Doctrine.Â  The doctrine â€œentitles the judge to sit, in\r\n  essence, as the thirteenth juror when he finds â€˜the evidence does not justify\r\n  the verdict,â€™ and then to grant a new trial based solely â€˜upon the facts.â€™â€ Norton\r\n    v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 350 S.C. 473, 478, 567 S.E.2d 851, 854\r\n  (2002), citing Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 387 S.E.2d 265\r\n  (1990).Â  As the thirteenth juror, the trial judge can hang the jury by refusing\r\n  to agree to the juryâ€™s otherwise unanimous verdict. Id.\r\nUpon\r\n  review, a trial judgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial will be upheld\r\n  unless the order is wholly unsupported by the evidence, or the conclusion\r\n  reached was controlled by an error of law. Norton, 350 S.C. at 478, 567\r\n  S.E.2d at 854.Â  This Courtâ€™s review is limited to consideration of whether\r\n  evidence exists to support the trial courtâ€™s order. Id. at 478-79, 567\r\n  S.E.2d at 854.Â  As long as there is conflicting evidence, this Court has held\r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s grant of a new trial will not be disturbed. Id.\r\nThe\r\n  judge is not required to explain the reasons for his decision. Id.Â  In this case, however, the trial judge provided an explanation in the order\r\n  granting the motion for a new trial.Â  The court noted that Lane presented\r\n  evidence at trial, which was â€œuncontested by the defendant,â€ of actual medical\r\n  costs of $73,754, lost wages from the date of injury up until the time of trial\r\n  of $17,248, and a 21% permanent impairment rating. Â The court also noted that\r\n  the jury heard testimony from two experts opining that Lane suffered a loss of\r\n  personal services to his family equivalent to $19,381, such as household\r\n  chores, and is unable to perform the duties required by his prior job as an\r\n  HVAC mechanic.Â  The court concluded:\r\n\r\n\t[A]fter careful review of all of the facts and\r\n  circumstances of this case and other cases in the state of South Carolina, this\r\n  Court believes that an amount of Seventy Five Thousand and no/100 ($75,000.00)\r\n  Dollars can only be explained on the basis of passion, prejudice or caprice on\r\n  the part of the jury.Â  The juryâ€™s verdict in this case shocks the conscience of\r\n  this Court, as an award of damages, particularly the considerations, or lack\r\n  thereof, of the uncontested damages presented by the Plaintiff, including a\r\n  Twenty-One (21%) percent permanent impairment to health.Â  As such, this Court\r\n  finds that the juryâ€™s verdict in this matter is grossly inadequate in light of\r\n  the evidence presented.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge then granted Laneâ€™s\r\n  motion for a new trial absolute.\r\nA. Did the trial court commit legal error in viewing\r\n  certain damages as â€œunconstested?â€\r\nGilbert\r\n  first argues that it was legal error for the trial judge to base his order on\r\n  the idea that certain damages were â€œuncontested.â€Â  Gilbert contends that it â€œdid\r\n    contest those damages, denying them in its Answer, by not stipulating as to\r\n  damages and by questioning Laneâ€™s claims in cross-examining various witnesses\r\n  about them.â€Â  In Gilbertâ€™s view, the trial courtâ€™s Order implied that Gilbert\r\n  was required to put up witnesses to contest the claim of damages and thereby\r\n  shifted the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  considering a motion for a new trial, the trial judge must look to see if the\r\n  evidence justifies the jury verdict. See Norton, 350 S.C. at 478,\r\n  567 S.E.2d at 854.Â  The court, in making such an inquiry, is perfectly\r\n  justified in noting whether the evidence presented to the jury was or was not\r\n  challenged in front of the jury.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s statement that certain evidence was â€œuncontestedâ€ was not\r\n  factually incorrect, since the evidence in question was not challenged by\r\n  Gilbert at trial, even on cross-examination.Â  Gilbertâ€™s counsel told the jury\r\n  in his opening statement:\r\n\r\n\tWe are not contesting that he was injured.Â  We are not\r\n  going to challenge those areas about his life.Â  He was injured.Â  He has\r\n  undergone a lot of medical treatment.Â  But, there is one part of his damages\r\n  that we are going to talk about.Â  We do take exception to the future los[t]\r\n  wages that you are going to hear.\r\n\r\nAs promised, Gilbert did not challenge the medical\r\n  costs, lost wages prior to trial, or physical impairment rating.Â  Instead,\r\n  Gilbert chose to focus on disputing Laneâ€™s claims for future lost wages, and\r\n  succeeded as the jury awarded $0 for that particular claim.\r\nThe trial court committed no error in noting\r\n  that certain damages were â€œuncontestedâ€ in its order granting a new trial.\r\nB. Is there evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  order?\r\nGilbert\r\n  contends that the trial court erred in granting a new trial because there is no\r\n  evidence to support the order.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn a\r\n  special verdict form, the jury awarded $75,000 in actual damages of which it\r\n  attributed $0 to future diminished earning capacity.Â  Gilbert argues that the\r\n  jury properly declined to award earning capacity since, at the time of trial, Lane\r\n  was employed in a job that paid better than his previous job.Â  Gilbert also\r\n  posits reasons why the jury might choose to reduce the awards for pre-trial\r\n  personal services, pain and suffering, and medical bills.[1]\r\nGilbertâ€™s\r\n  points are not entirely without merit.Â  However, the question before this Court\r\n  on appeal is whether the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a new trial is wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence. See Norton, 350 S.C. at 478, 567\r\n  S.E.2d at 854.Â  In the instant case, Lane presented evidence of $73,754 in\r\n  medical bills and $17,248 in lost wages up to the time of trial, neither of\r\n  which was challenged by Gilbert.Â  Lane also presented evidence that Lane has a\r\n  21% physical impairment, experienced pain and suffering related to the\r\n  accident, and suffered a loss of personal services to his family of $19,381.Â \r\n  We find the trial courtâ€™s decision order granting a new trial is supported by\r\n  the evidence.\r\n\r\nIII. Was Gilbert denied\r\n  its right to a trial by jury?\r\nGilbert\r\n  contends that to grant a new trial after the jury verdict was â€œde facto to\r\n  deny Gilbert its constitutional right to trial by jury.â€Â  In short, Gilbert\r\n  contends that the Thirteenth Juror Doctrine is unconstitutional under the South Carolina constitution.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  Thirteenth Juror Doctrine is a well-established in South Carolina as the\r\n  standard for granting a new trial. See Norton, 350 S.C. 477, 567\r\n  S.E.2d at 854.Â  This Court has reviewed the doctrine on several occasions and\r\n  has refused to abolish it. Id. at 478, 567 S.E.2d at 854.\r\nThe\r\n  right to trial by jury is a fundamental right. See Wright v. Colleton\r\n    County School Dist., 301 S.C. 282, 291, 391 S.E.2d 564, 570 (1990).Â  As\r\n  such, any abridgement of that right is subject to strict scrutiny. See City\r\n    of Beaufort v. Holcombe, 369 S.C. 643, 632 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  To\r\n  meet strict scrutiny, a law or policy must meet a compelling state interest and\r\n  be narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest. See In re Treatment\r\n    and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 140-41, 568 S.E.2d 338, 347 (2002).\r\nThe\r\n  Thirteenth Juror Doctrine does not abridge the right to a trial by jury since\r\n  the effect of a trial judgeâ€™s decision to grant a new trial is to allow another\r\n  jury trial.Â  Therefore, the parties are not deprived of a trial by jury.\r\nWe affirm\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s exercise of power under the Thirteenth Juror Doctrine.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  trial court did not err in declining to grant a directed verdict for Gilbert\r\n  based on Laneâ€™s status for purposes of premises liability.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  trial court did not err in granting a new trial under the Thirteenth Juror\r\n  Doctrine, nor is the doctrine unconstitutional.Â  Therefore, the decision of the\r\n  trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Gilbert contends that the jury may have reduced the amount of damages based on\r\n  medical bills because (1) though the bills were introduced, there was no\r\n  testimony that they had been paid, and (2) the jury could have reasonably\r\n  concluded from Laneâ€™s answer that the summary of medical expenses was correct\r\n  â€œto my knowledgeâ€ that Lane did not know how much he had been billed, or\r\n  actually paid for medical expenses. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26703","title":"State v.

Godfrey, Jr.,\r\n          of Godfrey Law Firm, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE\r\n  BURNETT:Â  Respondent Karl\r\n  Wallace was convicted of criminal sexual conduct with a minor, second degree,\r\n  for the sexual abuse of his stepdaughter (Victim).Â  On appeal, the Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed, holding the admission of evidence that respondent abused\r\n  Victimâ€™s older sister (Sister) was improperly admitted.[1]Â \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nVictim\r\n  testified the abuse began when she was twelve years old.Â  Â When she was in\r\n  seventh grade, respondent would periodically call her into his bedroom and tell\r\n  her to go into the adjoining bathroom and take off her clothes.Â  Victimâ€™s\r\n  mother and Sister worked nights and were not at home when this happened.Â \r\n  Respondent would touch Victimâ€™s breasts and would warn her, â€œDonâ€™t tell anyone\r\n  â€˜cause theyâ€™re not going to believe you anyway.â€Â  This conduct continued during\r\n  the time Victim was in the seventh and eighth grade.Â  \r\nOne\r\n  night when Victim was in ninth grade, respondent told her to sit on his bed.Â  Victimâ€™s\r\n  mother was not home and Sister had moved out of the house.Â  Respondent forced\r\n  Victim back on the bed, pulled off her pants and underwear, forced open her\r\n  legs and â€œpushed his hands up [her] private parts.â€Â  When Victim screamed,\r\n  respondent put a pillow over her face and threatened to hit her if she did not\r\n  stop.Â  Victimâ€™s younger brother came to the door and respondent told Victim to\r\n  go into the bathroom and dress.Â  After the brother left, respondent forced\r\n  Victim back onto the bed and took off her pants again but only looked at her.Â \r\n  He then let her get back up and get dressed, and she left the room.Â  Victim telephoned\r\n  Sister who came to the house but respondent would not let Sister come inside.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  next day, Sister visited Victim at school to find out why Victim had called.Â  Sister\r\n  asked if respondent had â€œmessed with herâ€ and Victim told Sister what\r\n  respondent had done.Â  Sister reported the abuse and a police report was filed.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, after an in camera hearing, the trial judge allowed Sister to testify that\r\n  she was also sexually abused by respondent from the time she was in seventh\r\n  grade until she moved out of the house after graduating high school.Â  Sister\r\n  testified that respondent would rub her back and sometimes put his hands up\r\n  under her shirt and touch her breasts.Â  After a while, he started touching her\r\n  â€œprivate areaâ€ and performing oral sex on her.Â  This would occur sporadically\r\n  in respondentâ€™s bedroom or in Sisterâ€™s bedroom when her mother was not at\r\n  home.Â  Sister testified respondent â€œwould always tell me, you know, at the end,\r\n  you know, â€˜You better not tell anyone. . . . â€˜Theyâ€™re not going to believe\r\n  [you] so donâ€™t tell anyone.â€™â€Â  The trial judge found this evidence admissible under\r\n  Rule 404(b), SCRE, as evidence of common scheme or plan.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did\r\n    the Court of Appeals err in finding Sisterâ€™s testimony inadmissible as evidence\r\n    of common scheme or plan?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRule 404(b)\r\nEvidence\r\n  of other bad acts is not admissible to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt except to\r\n  show motive, identity, existence of a common scheme or plan, absence of mistake\r\n  or accident, or intent.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE; see also State v. Lyle,\r\n  125 S.C. 406, 11 S.E. 803 (1923).[2]Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals found it was error to admit Sisterâ€™s testimony as evidence\r\n  of common scheme or plan because â€œthe trial court did not address any connection\r\n  between the two crimes.â€ Â Rather than viewing the similarity of the two events\r\n  as establishing the required connection, the Court of Appeals found some\r\n  further link was necessary.[3]\r\nThe process of analyzing bad act evidence begins with Rule 401,\r\n  SCRE.[4]Â \r\n  Pursuant to Rule 401, the trial court must determine whether the evidence is\r\n  relevant.Â  Upon determining the evidence is relevant, the trial court must then\r\n  determine whether the bad act evidence fits within an exception of Rule 404(b) as\r\n  interpreted by our jurisprudence. \r\nRule 404(b) allows the admission of evidence of a common scheme or\r\n  plan.Â  Such evidence is relevant because\r\n  proof of one is strong proof of the other.Â  When determining whether evidence is admissible as common scheme\r\n  or plan, the trial court must analyze the similarities and dissimilarities\r\n  between the crime charged and the bad act evidence to determine whether there is a close degree of similarity. Â State v.\r\n    Parker, 315 S.C. 230, 433 S.E.2d 831 (1993).Â  When the similarities\r\n  outweigh the dissimilarities, the bad act evidence is admissible under Rule\r\n  404(b).Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  not a complete list, in this type of case, the trial court should consider the\r\n  following factors when determining whether there is a close degree of\r\n  similarity between the bad act and the crime charged:Â  (1) the age of the\r\n  victims when the abuse occurred; (2) the relationship between the victims and\r\n  the perpetrator; (3) the location where the abuse occurred; (4) the use of\r\n  coercion or threats; and (5) the manner of the occurrence, for example, the\r\n  type of sexual battery.Â  See State v. Hallman, 298 S.C. 172, 379\r\n  S.E.2d 115 (1989) (evidence admissible as common scheme or plan where all\r\n  victims were foster children of similar age and the types of sexual batteries\r\n  were similar); State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 323 S.E.2d 772\r\n  (1984) (evidence admissible as common scheme or plan where both victims were\r\n  defendantâ€™s daughters, were the same age at time of the initial attack, and\r\n  defendant gave same explanation for his actions).Â  We emphasize that these\r\n  factors are set out merely for guidance and that other factors may be relevant\r\n  in weighing the similarities and the dissimilarities between the crime charged\r\n  and the bad act evidence.\r\nA close degree of similarity establishes the required\r\n  connection between the two acts and no further â€œconnectionâ€ must be shown for\r\n  admissibility.[5]Â \r\n  Here, the similarities between the acts include petitionerâ€™s relationship to\r\n  the victims (his stepdaughters), abuse beginning at about the same age, abuse\r\n  occurring in the family home when the mother was absent, and an admonishment\r\n  not to tell because no one would believe it.Â  In sum, there are similarities in\r\n  the class of victim, timing, place, and warning that outweigh any dissimilarity.Â \r\n  We find the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that Sisterâ€™s testimony was\r\n  improperly admitted under Rule 404(b).Â Â  \r\nRedaction\r\nAt the in camera\r\n  hearing, Sister testified that digital penetration and oral sex eventually\r\n  progressed to intercourse.Â  The trial court ruled that in order to avoid unfair\r\n  prejudice to respondent, any testimony regarding intercourse would not be\r\n  allowed when Sister testified before the jury.Â  The Court of Appeals found this\r\n  was error because it made the two acts seem more similar than they actually\r\n  were.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe note that the\r\n  trial court redacted only the last step in a progressive course of abuse.Â \r\n  Sisterâ€™s abuse began with touching of the breasts, digital penetration and oral\r\n  sex, and then progressed to the point of intercourse.Â  The fact that Victimâ€™s\r\n  abuse was interrupted before it could culminate in intercourse does not diminish\r\n  the similarity between the progression the abuse took in each case.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Moreover,\r\n  the trial court may properly redact dissimilar particulars of sexual conduct to\r\n  avoid unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  \r\n\r\nRule 403\r\nOnce bad act evidence is found admissible\r\n  under Rule 404(b), the trial court must then conduct the prejudice analysis\r\n  required by Rule 403, SCRE.[6]Â  The probative value of evidence falling\r\n  within one of the Rule 404(b) exceptions must substantially outweigh the danger\r\n  of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601,\r\n  646 S.E.2d 872 (2007).Â  Here,\r\n  the probative value of Sisterâ€™s testimony as redacted substantially outweighs\r\n  the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  We conclude the trial court properly admitted\r\n  the evidence.Â  The decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., and WALLER, J., concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in result only. PLEICONES,\r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, our cases\r\n  holding that evidence of other acts of sexual misconduct is admissible in a\r\n  trial for criminal sexual conduct with a minor as a â€œcommon scheme or planâ€\r\n  under Rule 404(b), SCRE, have, in effect, created an exception to the ruleâ€™s\r\n  exclusion of propensity evidence.Â  Compare, e.g., Vogel v. State,\r\n  315 Md. 458, 554 A.2d 1231 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  We have repeatedly held in\r\n  non-sexual offense cases that, â€œthe mere presence of similarity only serves to\r\n  enhance the potential for prejudice,â€ State v. Tuffour, 364 S.C. 497,\r\n  613 S.E.2d 814 (Ct. App. 2005) vacated on other grounds 371 S.C. 511,\r\n  641 S.E.2d 24 (2007) internal citations omitted, yet under the\r\n  majorityâ€™s view, similarity is the touchstone of admissibility in child sexual\r\n  offense cases.Â  In my view, if we are to permit the admission of propensity\r\n  evidence in these types of cases, then we should propose a new rule of\r\n  evidence, and encourage public comment.Â  See e.g. Rules 413 and\r\n  414, Fed. R. Evid.; Rule 404(c), Az. R. Evid.Â  In light of the controversy\r\n  engendered by these rules in other jurisdictions,[7] I believe that thorough scrutiny is warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] State v. Wallace, 364 S.C. 130, 611 S.E.2d 332 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n[2]Bad\r\n  act evidence that is not subject to a conviction must be shown by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence and is reviewed under an â€œany evidenceâ€ standard on\r\n  appeal.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001).Â  Here,\r\n  there is no challenge to the proof of the bad act.\r\n[3] In support, the Court of Appeals points to Lyle, supra, in which this Court allowed evidence of a â€œsimilar crimeâ€ that\r\n  occurred on the same date in the same town (Aiken), but disallowed evidence of\r\n  â€œsimilar crimesâ€ that occurred on other dates in other locations (Georgia).Â \r\n  The Lyle court observed that there was no connection to show the Georgia crimes were â€œpractically â€˜a continuous transaction,â€™â€ 125 S.C. at 427, 118 S.E. at\r\n  811, and therefore the evidence was inadmissible.Â  The Court of Appeals read\r\n  this holding in Lyle to mean a similarity in the acts is not enough\r\n  without some further connection.Â  \r\nA\r\n  careful reading of Lyle does not support the Court of Appealsâ€™\r\n  conclusion.Â  The crime charged in Lyle was uttering a forged check.Â  The Lyle court allowed the Aiken bad act evidence not only because it had\r\n  occurred on the same date, but because it had a close degree of similarity to\r\n  the particulars of the crime chargedâ€”the forged checks were issued using the\r\n  same name and the same address.Â  118 S.E. at 807-808.Â  The evidence that was not allowed was evidence of simply uttering other forged checks with no particulars\r\n  in common with the events giving rise to the charge for which the defendant was\r\n  tried.Â  In other words, the commission of acts that fall into the same criminal\r\n  definition is not sufficient.Â  The acts must bear some factual similarity to\r\n  constitute a connection between them.\r\n[4]Rule\r\n  401 provides that relevant\r\n  evidence is â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.â€\r\n[5]The Court of Appeals relied on State v. Tutton,\r\n  354 S.C. 319, 580 S.E.2d 186 (Ct. App. 2003), which appears to require a\r\n  connection beyond a degree of similarity in the details of the crime charged\r\n  and the bad act evidence.Â  We find this interpretation to be an overly\r\n  restrictive view of our case law.Â  Requiring a â€œconnectionâ€ between the crime\r\n  charged and the bad act evidence is simply a requirement that the two be factually\r\n  similar and does not add an additional layer of analysis.\r\n[6]Rule\r\n  403 states:\r\n\r\n  Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its\r\n    probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\r\n    confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue\r\n    delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.Â Â  \r\n\r\n[7] I note that The Advisory Committees on Criminal and Civil Rules, except for the\r\n  Department of Justice representative, the Study Committee, except for the DOJ\r\n  representative, and the Judicial Conference unanimously urged Congress to\r\n  reconsider these Rules.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26704","title":"State v.

Clasby appeals her\r\n  conviction for lewd act upon a child,[1] arguing the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of prior bad acts involving\r\n  the victim for which she was not indicted under the common scheme or plan\r\n  exception to State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923), and Rule\r\n  404(b), SCRE.Â  Pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, this Court certified this appeal\r\n  from the Court of Appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  August 6, 1994, a daughter, B.C., was born to Clasby and Bug Holliday.Â \r\n  Although the couple lived together at the time of B.C.â€™s birth, the couple\r\n  separated approximately a month and a half later.Â  After the separation, Clasby\r\n  had physical custody of B.C. \r\nAccording to\r\n  Holliday, he did not have contact with B.C. until she was four years old given\r\n  he â€œnever could find where [Clasby and B.C.] were staying at.â€Â  Despite this\r\n  reunion, Holliday stated that he did not establish a relationship with B.C.\r\n  until she was six years old because Clasby â€œleft againâ€ with B.C.Â  At that\r\n  time, Holliday was awarded legal custody of B.C. after a family court custody\r\n  proceeding. Even though the family court granted Clasby visitation, Holliday\r\n  testified that Clasby did not exercise this right on a regular basis. \r\nWhen Clasby became\r\n  homeless in November 2003, Holliday permitted her to move in with him but the\r\n  two did not maintain a romantic relationship.Â  One month later, Clasby moved\r\n  out of the home.Â  Clasby did not establish contact with Holliday and B.C. until\r\n  May 2004 when she sought to exercise her visitation rights.Â  While Holliday was\r\n  reluctant to permit Clasby to have visitation, he testified he did so in order\r\n  to be in compliance with the family court order.Â  Shortly thereafter, Holliday\r\n  made the decision to seek a modification of Clasbyâ€™s visitation schedule so\r\n  that he could get â€œsome help from the police if [Clasby] didnâ€™t return [B.C.]â€\r\n  and â€œto keep track of [Clasby] better.â€\r\nAlthough the exact\r\n  date is unclear, B.C. at some point expressed that she no longer wanted to\r\n  visit with Clasby.Â  Because B.C. would not give a reason for this decision,\r\n  Holliday decided to send B.C. to Cynthia Still, a licensed professional\r\n  counselor.Â  Holliday believed that a counselor would help him assess B.C.â€™s\r\n  relationship with Clasby prior to another family court proceeding. \r\nOn June 23, 2004,\r\n  Still began the first of twenty-seven counseling sessions with B.C.Â  During the\r\n  sixth visit, on August 16, 2004, Still noticed that B.C. â€œseemed differentâ€ and\r\n  appeared â€œanxious.â€Â  According to Still, B.C. described â€œsome situations where\r\n  she had been around a lot of talk that involved sexual issues that she was very\r\n  uncomfortable with.â€Â  In the course of an appointment two days later, B.C.\r\n  conveyed to Still that she had been sexually abused.Â Â Â  In turn, Still relayed\r\n  to Holliday her concerns for B.C.â€™s safety.Â Â Â  Â \r\nAfter\r\n  receiving this information, Holliday spoke with B.C. who then revealed her\r\n  claims of sexual abuse. Â Based on this discussion, Holliday met with law\r\n  enforcement regarding B.C.â€™s allegations.Â  B.C. was then interviewed at the\r\n  Pickens County Sheriffâ€™s Office.Â  Following this interview, Clasby was arrested\r\n  for CSC with a minor, first degree.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  September 2005, a Pickens County grand jury indicted Clasby for CSC with a\r\n  minor, first degree and lewd act upon a child for offenses that allegedly\r\n  occurred in June 2004. \r\nAt\r\n  the trial for these offenses in October 2005, the solicitor sought to introduce\r\n  evidence of prior bad acts involving Clasby with the victim that allegedly\r\n  occurred prior to the indicted June 2004 incidents.Â  The solicitor asserted\r\n  that these incidents established â€œan escalating pattern of abuse that\r\n  eventually culminated in criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.â€ Â Clasbyâ€™s\r\n  counsel opposed the introduction of the evidence on the ground it did not fit\r\n  within the Lyle exception of common scheme or plan.Â  Following arguments\r\n  of counsel, the trial judge preliminarily ruled that the evidence could be\r\n  introduced. \r\nAfter\r\n  B.C. began her testimony, the trial judge conducted an in camera hearing\r\n  regarding the alleged prior bad act evidence.Â  B.C. testified that when Clasby\r\n  came to live with her and Holliday, she and Clasby would bathe together. Â B.C.\r\n  testified that she would sit with her back against the bathtub while her mother\r\n  sat with her back to her. Â She further testified that as she was washing her\r\n  motherâ€™s hair, Clasby would â€œput her hair back . . . and touch my private and\r\n  rub it.â€ \r\nB.C.\r\n  testified that on another occasion she was watching a movie with her mother\r\n  with a blanket over them in the living room and her mother â€œrub[bed] her\r\n  privateâ€ inside of her underwear.Â  She further stated that her mother â€œplay[ed]\r\n  with her privateâ€ while the two were sleeping together in her fatherâ€™s bed. \r\nIn\r\n  addition to the incidents that B.C. testified occurred at her fatherâ€™s house,\r\n  B.C. relayed an incident after her mother moved out of Hollidayâ€™s home.Â  Following\r\n  her motherâ€™s departure in the spring of 2004, B.C. testified that she would\r\n  visit her mother at Clasbyâ€™s fatherâ€™s home.Â  B.C. recounted one time when her\r\n  mother â€œrub[bed] her privateâ€ and her mother asked her to â€œsuck her breasts.â€ \r\nAfter\r\n  outlining these prior incidents, the solicitor questioned B.C. regarding the\r\n  June 1, 2004 incidents for which Clasby had been indicted.Â  Although B.C. could\r\n  not remember the exact date, she testified that her mother â€œput her fingerâ€\r\n  inside â€œher privateâ€ while they were lying on the floor in the bedroom of\r\n  Heather Rhoda, Clasbyâ€™s sister.\r\nAt the conclusion\r\n  of B.C.â€™s in camera testimony, the trial judge ruled the prior bad act\r\n  evidence was â€œclear and convincingâ€ and admissible under the â€œcommon scheme or\r\n  planâ€ exception to Lyle. \r\nB.C. gave\r\n  essentially the same testimony before the jury as she did during the in\r\n    camera hearing.Â  When questioned as to why she did not immediately reveal\r\n  the abuse, B.C. claimed that her mother told her she would kill her if she\r\n  told.Â  \r\nDuring her\r\n  testimony, Clasby adamantly denied ever touching B.C. in a â€œsexually\r\n  inappropriate manner.â€Â  Through her testimony, Clasby inferred the sexual abuse\r\n  allegations stemmed from animosity that existed between her and Holliday over\r\n  their custody and visitation arrangement.Â  Specifically, Clasby testified that\r\n  Holliday told her â€œhe would do whatever it took to keep [her] away from [B.C.].â€Â \r\n  In terms of the incidents described by B.C., Clasby explained the alleged\r\n  misconduct would have occurred when B.C. visited her at Clasbyâ€™s fatherâ€™s\r\n  doublewide trailer which was shared by nine other relatives.\r\nHeather Rhoda,\r\n  Clasbyâ€™s sister, testified there was no privacy in the trailer given the number\r\n  of people who resided there.Â  Rhoda claimed that B.C. usually slept with her\r\n  cousin when she visited and was not alone with Clasby.Â  She described Clasby\r\n  and B.C. as having a â€œreally good relationship.â€Â  She further testified that\r\n  she overheard Holliday tell Clasby that â€œhe would do whatever he had to do to\r\n  make sure that [Clasby] would not be able see [B.C.] again.â€ \r\nUltimately, the\r\n  jury convicted Clasby of lewd act upon a child, but acquitted her of CSC with a\r\n  minor, first degree.Â  The trial judge sentenced Clasby to fourteen years\r\n  imprisonment.Â  Clasby appealed her conviction to the Court of Appeals.Â  This\r\n  Court certified this appeal from the Court of Appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nClasby\r\n  argues the trial judge erred in admitting B.C.â€™s testimony in which she\r\n  described four uncharged incidents of sexual misconduct involving Clasby.Â \r\n  Because she was not indicted for these acts, Clasby contends the evidence was\r\n  inadmissible in that it did not rise to the level of common scheme or plan\r\n  evidence under Lyle.Â  Specifically, Clasby asserts the prior bad acts\r\n  were â€œseparate in time and had no connection with the incident from which she\r\n  was chargedâ€ and, thus, served only to show that she had a â€œpropensity for\r\n  child molestation.â€ If the admission of this evidence is found to have been in\r\n  error, Clasby claims its admission did not constitute harmless error.Â  \r\nThe trial judge\r\n  has considerable latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence and his\r\n  decision should not be disturbed absent prejudicial abuse of discretion. Â State\r\n    v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 78, 480 S.E.2d 64, 72 (1997).Â  Â  \r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, the trial judge must initially determine whether the\r\n  proffered evidence is relevant as required under Rule 401 of the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Evidence.Â  Rule 401, SCRE (â€œâ€˜Relevant\r\n  evidenceâ€™ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.â€).\r\nIf the trial judge\r\n  finds the evidence to be relevant, the judge must then determine whether the\r\n  bad act evidence fits within an exception of Rule 404(b).Â  According to Rule\r\n  404(b), evidence of prior crimes or misconduct is inadmissible to prove the\r\n  specific crime charged unless the evidence tends to establish: Â (1) motive; (2)\r\n  intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme or plan\r\n  embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that\r\n  proof of one tends to establish the proof of the other; or (5)\r\n  the identity of the person charged with the present crime. Â Rule 404(b), SCRE\r\n  (â€œEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or\r\n  acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show\r\n  action in conformity therewith. Â It may, however, be admissible to show motive,\r\n  identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, theabsence of mistake or accident, or intent.â€); Lyle, 125\r\n  S.C. at 416, 118 S.E. at 807.\r\nâ€œTo be admissible, the bad act must logically relate to the crime\r\n  with which the defendant has been charged.â€ Â State v. Gaines, 380 S.C.\r\n  23, 29, 667 S.E.2d 728, 731 (2008). Â â€œIf the defendant was not convicted of the\r\n  prior crime, evidence of the prior bad act must be clear and convincing.â€Â  Id.\r\nWhen considering whether there is clear and convincing evidence of\r\n  other bad acts, an appellate court is bound by the trial judgeâ€™s factual\r\n  findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C.\r\n  1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  The determination of a witnessâ€™s credibility\r\n  is left to the trial judge who saw and heard the witness and is therefore in a better position to evaluate his\r\n  or her veracity. Â Id. (analyzing\r\n  prior bad act evidence and finding the appellate court committed error by\r\n  basing its ruling on its own\r\n  view of the witnessâ€™s credibility).Â  If the trial judge concludes there is\r\n  clear and convincing evidence that the defendant committed the uncharged acts, he\r\n  or she must determine whether the prior acts fall within the common scheme or\r\n  plan exception to Lyle.Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œWhere there is a close degree of similarity between the crime\r\n  charged and the prior bad act, both this Court and the Court of Appeals have\r\n  held prior bad acts are admissible to demonstrate a common scheme or plan.â€ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Gaines, 380\r\n  S.C. at 30, 667 S.E.2d at 731.Â  â€œWhen\r\n  determining whether evidence is admissible as common scheme or plan, the trial\r\n  court must analyze the similarities and dissimilarities between the crime\r\n  charged and the bad act evidence to determine whether there is a close degree\r\n  of similarity.â€Â  State v. Wallace, Op. No. 26703 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 17, 2009).Â  â€œWhen the similarities outweigh the dissimilarities, the bad\r\n  act evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b).â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œEven if prior bad act evidence is clear\r\n  and convincing and falls within an exception, it must be excluded if its\r\n  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\r\n  to the defendant.â€Â  Gaines, 380 S.C. at 29, 667 S.E.2d at 731; see Rule 403, SCRE (providing that evidence, although relevant, may be excluded if\r\n  its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\n  prejudice); State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 609, 646 S.E.2d 872, 876\r\n  (2007) (applying probative versus prejudicial test of Rule 403, SCRE, to â€œother\r\n  crimesâ€ evidence).Â  â€œThe determination of the prejudicial effect of the\r\n  evidence must be based on the entire record and the result will generally turn\r\n  on the facts of each case.â€Â  State v. Fletcher, 379 S.C. 17, 24, 664\r\n  S.E.2d 480, 483 (2008). \r\nWe\r\n  find the trial judge properly admitted the proffered evidence of the four\r\n  incidents of uncharged sexual misconduct committed by Clasby on B.C. prior to\r\n  the June 1, 2004 offenses for which she was indicted and tried.Â  The alleged\r\n  prior bad act evidence reveals a close degree of similarity to the facts of the\r\n  indicted charges.\r\nAll\r\n  of Clasbyâ€™s alleged sexual misconduct was directed at the same victim.Â  The\r\n  incidents described by B.C. occurred each time Clasby reunited with B.C. Â In\r\n  November 2003, Clasby moved in with Holliday after becoming homeless.Â  B.C.\r\n  testified that during this month-long stay, the following incidents occurred:Â \r\n  (1) her mother touched her â€œprivateâ€ while the two bathed together; (2) her\r\n  mother â€œrub[bed] her privateâ€ inside of her underwear; and (3) her mother\r\n  â€œplay[ed] with her privateâ€ while the two were sleeping together in her\r\n  fatherâ€™s bed.Â  After another extended absence, Clasby sought to exercise her\r\n  visitation rights with B.C. in May 2004.Â  Â According to B.C., another incident\r\n  occurred in the spring of 2004 where her mother â€œrub[bed] her privateâ€ and\r\n  asked her to â€œsuck her breastsâ€ while they were lying on the floor together.Â \r\n  Each of the incidents established a pattern of escalating abuse which\r\n  ultimately culminated in Clasbyâ€™s digital penetration of B.C.Â  The four prior\r\n  incidents of sexual misconduct by Clasby reveal the same illicit conduct with B.C.\r\n  during periods of visitation prior to the June 1, 2004 indicted offenses.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  a close degree of similarity exists between the crimes charged and the bad act\r\n  evidence, we hold the proffered evidence satisfied the established requirements\r\n  for the admissibility of evidence under the common scheme or plan exception. Â See Wallace (holding that in weighing the similarities and dissimilarities\r\n  between the crime charged and the bad act evidence a trial court should\r\n  consider, among other factors, the location where the abuse occurred, the use\r\n  of coercion or threats, and the manner of the occurrence, for example, the type\r\n  of sexual battery); see also State v. Whitener, 228 S.C. 244, 265,\r\n  89 S.E.2d 701, 711 (1955) (recognizing that the common scheme or plan exception\r\n  â€œis generally applied in cases involving sexual crimes, where evidence of acts\r\n  prior and subsequent to the act charged in the indictment is held admissible as\r\n  tending to show continued illicit intercourse between the same partiesâ€\r\n  (emphasis added)).Â  To the extent Clasby claims the evidence was not â€œclear and\r\n  convincingâ€ on the ground B.C. was not definitive in her testimony regarding\r\n  the time and place of the four incidents, we find any issue regarding B.C.â€™s\r\n  credibility was properly evaluated by the trial judge. \r\nFurthermore, under\r\n  similar circumstances to the instant case, this Court and the Court of Appeals\r\n  have found prior bad act evidence was properly admitted under the common scheme\r\n  or plan exception.Â  See State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 392, 323\r\n  S.E.2d 772, 774 (1984) (concluding that victimâ€™s testimony regarding prior\r\n  attacks by defendant, which were not the subject of an indictment, was properly\r\n  admitted under the common scheme or plan exception in trial for CSC with a\r\n  minor, second degree where testimony showed â€œthe continued illicit intercourse\r\n  forced upon her by [defendant]â€); State v. Kirton, 381 S.C. 7, 36, 671\r\n  S.E.2d 107, 121-22 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding evidence that defendant began\r\n  touching and committing other sexual misconduct with victim when she was six or\r\n  seven years old was admissible to show common scheme or plan during trial for\r\n  the indicted offense of CSC with a minor, second degree on the ground that the\r\n  â€œsix to seven year pattern of escalating abuse of Victim by [defendant was] the\r\n  essence of grooming and continuous illicit activityâ€); State v. Mathis, 359\r\n  S.C. 450, 464, 597 S.E.2d 872, 879 (Ct. App. 2004) (concluding evidence of\r\n  uncharged sexual misconduct committed by the defendant on the victim three\r\n  times prior to the indicted offense of CSC with a minor, second degree was\r\n  admissible where the â€œthree earlier assaults on the victim were all attempted\r\n  in the same manner and under similar circumstancesâ€); State v. Weaverling,\r\n  337 S.C. 460, 471, 523 S.E.2d 787, 792 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding victimâ€™s\r\n  testimony regarding pattern of sexual abuse he suffered by the defendant was\r\n  properly admitted as part of a common scheme or plan exception in trial for CSC\r\n  with a minor and disseminating harmful material to a minor where the\r\n  â€œchallenged testimonial evidence of [defendantâ€™s] prior bad acts show[ed] the\r\n  same illicit conduct with the same victim under similar circumstances over a\r\n  period of several yearsâ€).Â  Accordingly, we find a decision to affirm the\r\n  admission of the prior bad evidence is consistent with our jurisprudence.[2]\r\nFinally, we hold the\r\n  probative value of this evidence substantially outweighed the danger of unfair\r\n  prejudice to Clasby.Â  Given there was no physical evidence to corroborate\r\n  B.C.â€™s testimony regarding the indicted offenses of CSC with a minor, first\r\n  degree and lewd act upon a child, we find her testimony of Clasbyâ€™s sustained\r\n  illicit conduct was extremely probative to establish the charged criminal\r\n  sexual conduct underlying the offense of lewd act upon a child.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find B.C.â€™s testimony regarding the four incidents of\r\n  sexual abuse inflicted by Clasby prior to the indicted offenses constitutes the\r\n  archetypal â€œcommon scheme or planâ€ evidence.Â  Therefore, we affirm Clasbyâ€™s\r\n  conviction and sentence for lewd act upon a child.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  SeeS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-140 (2003) (â€œIt is unlawful for a person\r\n  over the age of fourteen years to wilfully and lewdly commit or attempt a lewd\r\n  or lascivious act upon or with the body, or its parts, of a child under the age\r\n  of sixteen years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the\r\n  lust or passions or sexual desires of the person or of the child.â€).\r\n[2]Â  We, however, note the existence of the decision of\r\n  the Court of Appeals in State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 580 S.E.2d 186\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In Tutton, the defendant was convicted of CSC with a\r\n  minor, second degree and two counts of lewd act upon a child.Â  The charges\r\n  arose out of allegations from two minor victims, who were sisters, that Tutton\r\n  â€œrubbed their buttsâ€ and digitally penetrated one of the victims while they\r\n  were spending the night at Tuttonâ€™s home.Â  Id. at 323, 580 S.E.2d at\r\n  188.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Tutton\r\n  claimed the trial judge erred by admitting evidence of uncharged criminal\r\n  conduct under the common scheme or plan exception.Â  Specifically, Tutton\r\n  challenged the testimony of the victim identified in the CSC with a minor\r\n  charge.Â  This victim testified that Tutton sexually assaulted her four or five\r\n  years prior to the time of the trial.Â  Id. at 324, 580 S.E.2d at 189.Â Â \r\n  The victim claimed while spending the night at Tuttonâ€™s, he forced her to lie\r\n  on her back and take off her underwear.Â  According to the victim, Tutton then\r\n  performed oral sex on her and forced her to perform oral sex on him.Â  Id.Â  The victim further testified that Tutton threatened to tell her parents that\r\n  she was misbehaving if she spoke of the incident.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed Tuttonâ€™s convictions, finding â€œthe similarities in this case\r\n  are insufficient to support the inference that Tutton employed a common scheme\r\n  or plan to commit the assaults alleged in this case.â€Â  Id. at 333, 580\r\n  S.E.2d at 194.Â  Although the Court of Appeals recognized the incidents involved\r\n  the same parties and occurred at Tuttonâ€™s residence, it found the\r\n  dissimilarities were greater than these similarities.Â  Specifically, the Court\r\n  of Appeals noted that unlike the charged incident, Tutton threatened the victim\r\n  after the uncharged incident.Â  Additionally, Tutton did not attempt to assault\r\n  the victimâ€™s sister at the time of the uncharged act with the victim.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals also pointed out that the victims had stayed with Tutton\r\n  without incident on several occasions during the interim between the uncharged\r\n  act and the charged offense. Â Id. at 332-33, 580 S.E.2d at 193.\r\nWe conclude Tutton is distinguishable from the instant case.Â  Initially, we note that its holding\r\n  was called into question by the majority opinion in Wallace on the\r\n  ground the analysis constituted an overly restrictive view of our case law.Â  Tutton is also factually dissimilar from the instant case given the sexual battery in\r\n  the charged offense and the uncharged act was not of the same type.Â  In\r\n  contrast, the type of sexual misconduct of the charged offenses and the\r\n  uncharged offenses were similar in the instant case.Â  Furthermore, unlike the\r\n  single uncharged incident relied on in Tutton, the solicitor in the\r\n  instant case presented B.C.â€™s testimony which detailed four prior incidents\r\n  which occurred over a relatively short period of time. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26692 ","title":"In the Matter of Frank Rogers Ellerbe, III","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26692 ","description":"In this opinion, the Court suspended Frank Rogers Ellerbe, III, from the practice of law for ninety days retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.","date":"2009-08-20","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of Frank Rogers Ellerbe, III, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nRespondent has petitioned the\r\n  Court for rehearing in this matter.Â  We grant the petition, withdraw Opinion\r\n  Number 26692 filed July 27, 2009, and substitute the attached opinion.\r\nIT\r\n  IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/John H.

Â The PCR judge dismissed the\r\n  application without prejudice so that the issues could be properly raised in\r\n  the ALC in accordance with Al-Shabbaz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d\r\n  742 (2000).[3]Â Â \r\n  Major timely filed a petition for a writ of certiorari for this Court to review\r\n  the PCR judgeâ€™s order.\r\nWhile\r\n  awaiting a hearing before the ALC and a decision by this Court, Major filed a\r\n  motion for clarification of his sentence. Â Relying on this Courtâ€™s decision in Tilley\r\n    v. State, 334 S.C. 24, 511 S.E.2d 689 (1999),[4] Major challenged the sequence in which he was to serve his sentences.Â \r\n  Specifically, Major claimed that he had already served the five-year weapons\r\n  charge sentence given he was awarded almost five years of credit for time\r\n  served since his conviction.Â  Thus, in light of Tilley, Major asserted\r\n  that he should only be serving a life sentence which would make him eligible\r\n  for parole. Under the Departmentâ€™s interpretation, Major averred that he would\r\n  never be eligible for parole because he must serve his life term before serving\r\n  the mandatory, five-year sentence.Â  \r\nWithout\r\n  a hearing, the trial judge denied Majorâ€™s motion, explaining the sentence needs\r\n  no clarification.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the circuit court judgeâ€™s decision, Major sought another review by the Department\r\n  of his parole eligibility.Â  The Department issued a â€œfinal decisionâ€ and informed\r\n  Major that he was not eligible for parole.Â  As part of this notification, the\r\n  Department informed Major that he had the right to appeal its decision to the\r\n  ALC.Â  Major moved for rehearing by the Department. \r\nIn the interim, having\r\n  granted Majorâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  dismissal of his PCR application, this Court issued an opinion on December 11,\r\n  2006 in which it affirmed the decision of the PCR judge. Â Major v. State,\r\n  Op. No. 2006-MO-042 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Dec. 11, 2006). Â Citing Al-Shabazz,\r\n  this Court explained that â€œMajor must pursue his requested relief through the\r\n  procedures provided in the Administrative Procedures Act in order to have his\r\n  sentence reordered in accordance with our decision in Tilley v. State,\r\n  334 S.C. 24, 511 S.E.2d 689 (1999) (holding that the consecutive nature of the\r\n  sentence does not mandate that the sentence be served in a specific order\r\n  absent the sentencing courtâ€™s clear articulation that the sentence be served in\r\n  a specific order).â€ \r\nBecause of the\r\n  procedural posture of Majorâ€™s case, the Department delayed its final\r\n  â€œrehearingâ€ of Majorâ€™s challenge to the agencyâ€™s determination of his parole\r\n  eligibility until after this Court issued its decision.Â  On February 16, 2007,\r\n  the Department sent Major a â€œfinal decisionâ€ letter, affirming its prior\r\n  determination that he was ineligible for parole and directing him to file an\r\n  appeal with the ALC. \r\nMajor\r\n  filed his notice of appeal with the ALC. Â In his notice of appeal, Major argued\r\n  that the Department incorrectly interpreted section 16-23-490 to require him to\r\n  complete his life sentence on his murder conviction before beginning his\r\n  five-year sentence on the weapons charge.Â  Because the sentencing judge did not\r\n  make any statement at the time of sentencing that the sentences were to be\r\n  served in a specific order, Major claimed that his sentences should be\r\n  â€œreorderedâ€ to comply with this Courtâ€™s decision in Tilley. \r\nThe\r\n  ALC issued an order reversing the Departmentâ€™s determination that Major was\r\n  ineligible for parole.Â  The ALC prefaced its decision by stating that criminal\r\n  sentences must be interpreted in light of the sentencing judgeâ€™s intent.Â  In\r\n  view of this principle, the ALC concluded that substantial evidence would not\r\n  support the Departmentâ€™s finding â€œthat the sentencing court intended for the\r\n  five-year sentence to commence after [Major] completes his life sentence.â€Â  \r\nUltimately,\r\n  the ALC held that the Department erred in sequencing the sentences such that\r\n  Major would never be eligible for parole.Â  In so holding, the ALC reasoned\r\n  â€œ[t]here is no basis in logic or in the law for the intent to require an\r\n  offender to serve an additional sentence after the completion of a life\r\n  sentence.â€Â  The ALC further stated â€œ[t]he imposition of such a sentence would\r\n  be a meaningless act absent the specific intent to preclude that individual\r\n  from ever becoming eligible for parole.Â  Further, the inference of such [ ] intent\r\n  presumes that the sentencing judge was willing to invade the province of the\r\n  legislature by circumventing its parole eligibility laws.â€Â  \r\nThe Department\r\n  appealed the ALCâ€™s decision to the Court of Appeals.Â  This Court granted the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ request for certification.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Department asserts the ALC erred in reversing its\r\n  determination that Major is not parole eligible.Â  Based on the terms of section\r\n  16-23-490 and the sentence structure imposed by the sentencing judge, the Department\r\n  claims that Major is effectively serving a life sentence without eligibility\r\n  for parole. Â The Department contends the sentencing judgeâ€™s initial order\r\n  indicated a clear intention for Major to serve the five-year mandatory term\r\n  after completion of his life sentence.Â  However, even if the original sentence\r\n  could be construed as ambiguous, the Department avers that the sentencing judge\r\n  clarified any question regarding his intention in the written order denying\r\n  Majorâ€™s motion for sentence clarification.Â  \r\nEssentially,\r\n  the Department claims the sentencing judge definitively ordered that Major was\r\n  to serve the five-year weapons sentence at the conclusion of his life sentence\r\n  for murder thereby denying Major an opportunity for parole.\r\nThe\r\n  decision of the ALC should not be overturned unless it is\r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence or controlled by some error of law. Â S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2008); Olson v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp;\r\n    Envtl. Control, 379 S.C. 57, 63, 663 S.E.2d 497, 500-01 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (â€œ[T]his court can reverse the ALC if the findings are affected by error of\r\n  law, are not supported by substantial evidence, or are characterized by abuse\r\n  of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.â€). Â The ALCâ€™s\r\n  order should be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence in the record. Â Olson,\r\n  379 S.C. at 63, 663 S.E.2d at 501.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  least facially, our decision in Tilley supports a finding that the ALC\r\n  properly reordered the sequence of Majorâ€™s sentences to ensure parole\r\n  eligibility given the sentencing sheets do not clearly articulate a particular\r\n  order for which Majorâ€™s sentences were to be served other than that they were\r\n  to be â€œconsecutive.â€Â  This position is also bolstered by this Courtâ€™s order\r\n  affirming the PCR judgeâ€™s dismissal of Majorâ€™s PCR application, wherein we\r\n  stated â€œMajor must pursue his requested relief through the procedures provided\r\n  in the Administrative Procedures Act in order to have his sentence reordered in\r\n  accordance with our decision in Tilley v. State, 334 S.C. 24, 511 S.E.2d\r\n  689 (1999).â€Â  Major v. State, Op. No. 2006-MO-042 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Dec. 11, 2006). \r\nBecause\r\n  our decision in Tilley left some questions unanswered, we take this\r\n  opportunity to expound on the decision in Tilley and address fundamental issues concerning the\r\n  role of the General Assembly, the authority of a sentencing judge, and the\r\n  discretion of the Department with respect to an inmateâ€™s parole eligibility\r\n  when a defendant is convicted of multiple offenses resulting in consecutive\r\n  sentences.Â  \r\nWe preface our analysis with the general principle that parole is\r\n  a privilege, not a matter of right.Â  State v. Dingle, 376 S.C. 643, 649,\r\n  659 S.E.2d 101, 104 (2008); Sullivan v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 355 S.C.\r\n  437, 443 n.4, 586 S.E.2d 124, 127 n.4 (2003).Â  Parole is a creature of statute\r\n  and is exclusively in the province of the legislative branch of government.Â \r\n  The General Assembly empowers the Department to administer the parole program.Â  \r\nThe General Assembly established this parole privilege and\r\n  identified which criminal offenses are parole-eligible by statute.Â  See Hair\r\n    v. State, 305 S.C. 77, 79, 406 S.E.2d 332, 334 (1991) (discussing parole\r\n  eligibility of certain offenses established by the General Assemblyâ€™s\r\n  enactments); State v. De La Cruz, 302 S.C. 13, 16, 393 S.E.2d 184, 186\r\n  (1990) (noting that the penalty established for a particular crime is purely a\r\n  matter of legislative prerogative, and that â€œ[i]f the legislature so chooses,\r\n  parole may not be made available to those who commit certain offensesâ€). \r\nConfined by these legislative enactments, and the doctrine of separation\r\n  of powers, a sentencing court is not authorized to determine parole eligibility.Â \r\n  Instead, a courtâ€™s final judgment in a criminal case is the pronouncement of\r\n  the sentence which includes the ability to designate whether sentences run\r\n  concurrent or consecutive, subject to statutory restrictions.Â  State v.\r\n    McKay, 300 S.C. 113, 115, 386 S.E.2d 623, 623 (1989); see De La\r\n      Cruz, 302 S.C. at 15, 393 S.E.2d at 186 (â€œJudicial discretion in\r\n  sentencing, in suspending sentences, and in designating that sentences run\r\n  concurrent or consecutive is subject to statutory restriction.â€).Â  \r\nIn effectuating a sentencing courtâ€™s order, the Department has the\r\n  sole authority to look to the statutes to determine whether a defendant is\r\n  eligible for parole separate and apart from the courtâ€™s authority to sentence a\r\n  defendant.Â  See Dingle, 376 S.C. at 649, 659 S.E.2d at 104-05\r\n  (noting that the Department has the sole authority to determine parole\r\n  eligibility separate and apart from the courtâ€™s ability to sentence); Cooper\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Prob., Parole &amp; Pardon Servs., 377 S.C. 489, 496, 661 S.E.2d 106, 110 (2008) (same).Â  \r\nNevertheless, a court may order the Department to structure a\r\n  sentence in such a way as to carry out the intent of the parties with regard to\r\n  parole.Â  Tilley, 334 S.C. at 28-29, 511 S.E.2d at 692 (ordering the Department\r\n  to consider the consecutive, five-year mandatory term for possession of a\r\n  firearm as being served first such that the prisoner would be considered\r\n  eligible for parole as the parties had intended).\r\nOur law, however, is well-established that a sentencing judge does\r\n  not have the authority to determine parole eligibility through sentencing.Â  McKay, 300 S.C. at 115, 386 S.E.2d at 623.Â  A sentencing court only has the ability to order whether a sentence is consecutive or concurrent.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(B) (2003) (providing that a sentencing court may\r\n  make the additional five years consecutive or concurrent). Â Â In other words, a\r\n  sentencing judge has the authority to structure a sentence but this authority\r\n  is specifically limited by the intention of the General Assembly in its\r\n  legislative enactments concerning parole-eligible offenses and an inmateâ€™s\r\n  service of a sentence.Â  The General Assembly has not statutorily authorized the\r\n  courts or the Department to nullify its power to grant parole or determine\r\n  parole-eligible offenses. \r\nThe General Assembly has specifically\r\n  identified certain crimes where the sentence must be consecutive and must be served last in time.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-395(D)\r\n  (Supp. 2008) (providing that the sentence of a person convicted of first-degree\r\n  criminal exploitation of a minor â€œmust run consecutively with and commence\r\n    at the expiration of another sentence being servedâ€) (emphasis added).Â  Clearly,\r\n  the General Assembly does not intend to define consecutive to mean last in\r\n  time.Â  Significantly, the General Assembly has not indicated that a consecutive\r\n  sentence on a weapons charge must be served last.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-23-490(B) (2003).Â  \r\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to the facts of\r\n  the instant case. Â Initially, we note that it is not entirely clear what the\r\n  sentencing judge intended as the sequence for Majorâ€™s sentence given there was\r\n  no clear pronouncement in the sentencing sheets.Â  \r\nHowever, even if the items in this case are construed\r\n  as expressing a clear intent by the sentencing judge for Major to serve his\r\n  murder sentence before the weapons sentence, we find the judge was not authorized to make Majorâ€™s\r\n  normally parole-eligible sentence ineligible for parole.Â  Â An order to this\r\n  effect would essentially create a de facto life without parole sentence\r\n  which would defeat the parole privilege created by the General Assembly for\r\n  Majorâ€™s murder charge.Â  Clearly, this would be a violation of the separation of\r\n  powers doctrine.\r\nMoreover, the Departmentâ€™s construction of\r\n  the sentencing judgeâ€™s intent and interpretation of the law contradicts this Courtâ€™s\r\n  pronouncement and rationale announced in State v. Atkins, 303 S.C. 214,\r\n  399 S.E. 2d 760 (1990). Â In Atkins, this Court said â€œfor purposes of\r\n  parole eligibility, consecutive sentences should be treated as one general\r\n  sentence by aggregating the periods imposed in each sentence.â€Â  Id. at 219, 399 S.E.2d at 763 (citing Mims v. State, 273 S.C. 740, 259 S.E.\r\n  2d 602 (1979)).Â  More importantly, for purposes of this case, the Atkins Court concluded that â€œ[m]ultiple life sentences cannot be aggregated in the\r\n  imposition of prison time.Â  Accordingly, they are to be considered as one\r\n  general sentence, the parole eligibility for which is 20 years.â€[5]Â  Id. Â This Court recognized\r\n  its limitations and refused to invade the province of the General Assembly.\r\nAdopting the reasoning of the Atkinsâ€™\r\n  Court, it follows that if a consecutive life sentence could not nullify parole\r\n  eligibility on a parolable life sentence, then a five-year consecutive sentence\r\n  cannot either.\r\nThe question now becomes what is the\r\n  efficacy of a consecutive sentence?Â  The answer is two fold.Â  First, following\r\n  the guidance of Mims, the time is aggregated and parole eligibility is\r\n  calculated on the aggregated sentence.Â  Secondly, if the consecutive sentence\r\n  is a non- parolable offense then its sentence must be served and credited first\r\n  against the aggregated sentence.Â  This is necessary to give effect to the\r\n  legislative grant of parole eligibility on the parole-eligible offense.[6]\r\nConsidering the above discussion, the\r\n  meaning of â€œconsecutiveâ€ needs further attention.Â  Because this term is not\r\n  defined in our code of laws, we must employ the rules of statutory construction\r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly.Â  See Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 39, 577 S.E.2d 202, 207\r\n  (2003) (â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is\r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€); Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846\r\n  (1992) (stating the words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary\r\n  meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand a\r\n  statuteâ€™s operation); Lee v. Thermal Engâ€™g Corp., 352 S.C. 81, 91-92,\r\n  572 S.E.2d 298, 303 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œWhere a word is not defined in a statute,\r\n  our appellate courts have looked to the usual dictionary meaning to supply its\r\n  meaning.â€).\r\nâ€œConsecutiveâ€ means sentences run\r\n  successively and the service of the sentence cannot run at the same time as the\r\n  other sentences.Â  See Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1367 (7th ed.\r\n  1999) (defining â€œconsecutive sentencesâ€ as â€œ[t]wo or more sentences of jail\r\n  time to be served in sequence.Â  For example, if a defendant receives\r\n  consecutive sentences of 20 years and 5 years, the total amount of jail time is\r\n  25 years. - Also termed cumulative sentences; accumulative sentences.â€); Websterâ€™s Concise Dictionary 150 (2003) (â€œFollowing in uninterrupted\r\n  succession; successive.â€); see generally R.P.D., Annotation, When\r\n    Sentences Imposed by the Same Court Run Concurrently or Consecutively; and\r\n    Definiteness of Direction with Respect Thereto, 70 A.L.R. 1511 (1931 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2008) (outlining cases and discussing question of whether sentences on\r\n  different counts or different offenses were intended to be served concurrently\r\n  or consecutively and whether the sentence or sentences were sufficiently\r\n  definite for the purpose intended).Â  \r\nThus, a notation that a sentence is\r\n  â€œconsecutive,â€ for sentencing purposes, does not necessarily delineate that the\r\n  particular sentence has to run last.Â  It merely indicates that all the\r\n  sentences are to run successively, and not to run at the same time.Â  See Atkins, 303 S.C. at 219, 399 S.E.2d at 763 (noting that â€œfor purposes of parole eligibility, consecutive sentences\r\n  should be treated as one general sentence by aggregating\r\n  the periods imposed in each sentenceâ€).Â  Therefore, despite\r\n  the fact that the weapons sentence was the last one imposed and it was denoted\r\n  as â€œconsecutiveâ€ there was no indication that the weapons sentence was to be\r\n  the last sentence to be served.Â  See Tilley,\r\n  334 S.C. at 28-29, 511 S.E.2d at 692 (ordering the Department to treat the\r\n  consecutive weapons sentence as being served first such that the inmate could\r\n  be considered for parole).\r\nThe General Assembly has specifically\r\n  noted several crimes with limits on parole, and it has not indicated that a\r\n  mandatory weapons conviction will affect parole eligibility.Â  See, e.g.,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 2008) (holding a person convicted of murder\r\n  with aggravating circumstances is not eligible for parole); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-11-330(A) (2003) (providing that a person convicted of committing a robbery\r\n  while armed with a deadly weapon must be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of\r\n  ten years up to a maximum of thirty years, and the person will not be parole\r\n  eligible until he or she has served at least seven years). \r\nBecause there is no indication in section\r\n  16-23-490 that the General Assembly intended the mandatory five-year sentence\r\n  to completely negate any possibility of parole on other parolable offenses, we\r\n  conclude the Departmentâ€™s interpretation of section 16-23-490 was erroneous\r\n  given its decision amounts to a denial of parole eligibility for an offense the\r\n  General Assembly has determined is eligible for parole.[7]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the terms of section 16-23-490 and the\r\n  respective roles of the General Assembly, the sentencing court, and the Department,\r\n  we hold the ALC correctly concluded that the Department erred in its\r\n  determination of Majorâ€™s parole eligibility.Â  We modify the ALCâ€™s order to the\r\n  extent the ALC based its decision solely on the Departmentâ€™s erroneous\r\n  interpretation of the sequence of Majorâ€™s sentences.Â  Accordingly, the decision\r\n  of the ALC is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. Â \r\nWALLER, J., concurs. TOAL, C.J., concurring in a\r\n  separate opinion. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which\r\n  KITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Although\r\n  I concur with the majority opinion, I write separately to address the dissentâ€™s\r\n  interpretation of State v. Atkins, 303 S.C. 214, 399 S.E.2d 760 (1990).Â \r\n  The dissent is correct to observe that we recognized in Atkins the\r\n  logical impossibility of aggregating multiple life sentences.Â  However, the\r\n  dissent errs in failing to extend that logic to the present case.Â  It is just\r\n  as much a logical impossibility to aggregate multiple life sentences as it is\r\n  to aggregate a life sentence with any other sentence.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  lesson from Atkins as applied to the present case is that there is no\r\n  sentence greater than life.Â  Whether aggregated to a five year sentence or a\r\n  second life sentence, the ultimate time served remains the same.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  I believe Atkins controls the inquiry in the present case, and stands\r\n  for the proposition that a life sentence may not be aggregated with another\r\n  sentence so as to affect parole eligibility where statute does not so provide.Â  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the sentence at\r\n  issue here is unambiguous and not subject to interpretation.Â  Where a trial\r\n  judge imposes two sentences, only one of which is denominated â€œconsecutive,â€ it\r\n  of necessity follows the other.Â  Moreover, while I agree that a judicial\r\n  officer is not empowered to determine whether parole will be granted, I\r\n  fundamentally disagree with the suggestion that a judge cannot structure a\r\n  sentence in such a way that the defendant is never eligible to be considered\r\n  for parole.Â  In order to find that the Legislature intended such a result where\r\n  a defendant is convicted of both a violent offense and of using a weapon in the\r\n  commission of that offense, one need look no further than S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-23-490(B) (2003), which specifically authorizes the judge to make the five\r\n  year weapons sentence consecutive.\r\n In interpreting\r\n  sentences, the Department looks to the sentences imposed, not to the statutes.Â \r\n  Moreover, only if there is an ambiguity in the sentences, must the Department\r\n  or the court ascertain the intent of the judge, not, as the majority suggests,\r\n  the intent of the parties.Â  Finally, while certain parole eligibility\r\n  determinations are statutorily committed to the Department,[8] as is the decision whether to grant parole,[9] there is no authority for the statement that a judge violates the separation of\r\n  powers doctrine when he structures a sentence so that an otherwise\r\n  parole-eligible defendant will never receive a hearing before the Board.Â  See cases collected in People v. Montgomery, 669 P.2d 1387 (Colo. 1983) (no separation of powers issue in sentence structuring).\r\nFinally, I read Mims\r\n  v. State, 273 S.C. 740, 259 S.E.2d 602 (1979) to hold that where a\r\n  defendant receives consecutive sentences, they are to be â€œaggregated,â€ i.e.\r\n  added together, in order to determine the date upon which the defendant first\r\n  becomes parole eligible.Â  In State v. Atkins, 303 S.C. 214, 399 S.E.2d\r\n  760 (1990), the Court simply recognized the logical impossibility of\r\n  aggregating multiple life sentences.Â  Here, we are asked to aggregate a life\r\n  sentence and a consecutive five year sentence, a sentence which the General\r\n  Assembly specified could, in the sentencing judgeâ€™s discretion, be made\r\n  consecutive.Â  The result is admittedly harsh,[10] and perhaps not desirable, however, it is not an unlawful sentence.\r\nI would reverse the\r\n  order of the ALC.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Although the code provision in effect at the time\r\n  Major committed the offenses in 1990 has since been amended, we cite to the\r\n  current version of section 16-23-490 given there have been no substantive\r\n  changes that would affect the decision in this case.Â  Act No. 184, 1993 S.C.\r\n  Acts 3292.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  16-23-490 provides for additional punishment for persons possessing a weapon\r\n  during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Persons who are in possession of a\r\n  firearm or knife during the commission of a violent crime, and are convicted of\r\n  the underlying violent crime, must additionally be sentenced to five years in\r\n  prison.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(A) (2003).Â  The five-year sentence is\r\n  mandatory and non-parolable.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(B), (C) (2003).Â  The\r\n  statute further provides that a sentencing court may make the additional five\r\n  years consecutive or concurrent.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(B) (2003).\r\n[2]Â  At the time Major committed the murder, the\r\n  applicable statute provided for parole eligibility after the service of twenty\r\n  years on a sentence of life imprisonment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (1985).\r\n[3]Â  Al-Shabbaz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d\r\n  742 (2000) (holding inmate was entitled to seek judicial review under\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act after Department reached its final decision).\r\n[4]Â  In Tilley, the defendant pled guilty to\r\n  kidnapping, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and possession of a firearm\r\n  during the commission of a violent crime.Â  He was sentenced to life\r\n  imprisonment for kidnapping, eighteen years for first-degree CSC, and five\r\n  years for possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  The\r\n  sentences were to be served consecutively.Â  Tilley, 334 S.C. at 26, 511\r\n  S.E.2d at 690.Â  \r\nTilley filed a PCR\r\n  application after the Department informed him by letter that he was ineligible\r\n  for parole due to the consecutive nature of the sentencing structure.Â  Even\r\n  though, in theory, Tilley was eligible for parole he was essentially ineligible\r\n  because he was required to serve out his life term before serving the mandatory\r\n  five-year term.Â  Id. at 27, 511 S.E.2d at 691.Â  \r\nThe PCR judge granted\r\n  Tilley relief on this issue.Â  Because the sentencing judge did not order that\r\n  Tilleyâ€™s sentences be served in a particular sequence, only that they be served\r\n  consecutively, the PCR judge ordered that Tilleyâ€™s sentences be served in a way\r\n  that corrected the Departmentâ€™s interpretation of his sentence.Â  Id. at 28-29, 511 S.E.2d at 692.\r\nThis Court agreed with the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision to rearrange the order of Tilleyâ€™s sentences, placing the mandatory\r\n  weapons sentence first, then the eighteen-year sentence for CSC, and finally\r\n  the life sentence for kidnapping.Â  The Court reasoned that the order would\r\n  still effectuate the intent of the sentencing court, but the consecutive,\r\n  mandatory five-year sentence on the weapons charge would not affect parole\r\n  eligibility on the other offenses.Â  Id. at 29, 511 S.E.2d at 692.\r\n[5]Â  Atkins, like Major, was charged under the old law.Â \r\n  The old law allowed parole after service of twenty years. Atkins, 303\r\n  S.C. at 219, 399 S.E.2d at 763.\r\n[6]Â  The argument that this approach is\r\n  contrary to prior practice was made in part by the dissent in Atkins to\r\n  no avail.\r\n[7]Â  Interestingly, service of the five-year mandatory,\r\n  no-parole sentence is not always required.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-23-490(B) (2003) (â€œService of the five-year sentence is mandatory unless a\r\n  longer mandatory minimum term of imprisonment is provided by law for the\r\n  violent crime.Â  The court may impose this mandatory five-year sentence to run\r\n  consecutively or concurrently.â€).Â  \r\nMajor received a mandatory-minimum sentence which\r\n  exceeded five years.Â  Thus, he is not necessarily required to serve the\r\n  no-parole, five-year sentence.Â  If he is not required to serve it, then we\r\n  question why it should prevent parole eligibility on an otherwise parolable\r\n  offense.\r\n[8] E.g.,\r\n  whether multiple violent offenses are part of a continuous course of conduct.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 (2003); State v. McKay, 300 S.C. 113, 386\r\n  S.E.2d 623 (1984).\r\n[9] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-30 (2003).\r\n[10] Respondent committed murder in 1990, at which\r\n  time the possible sentences for murder were death, life with twenty year parole\r\n  eligibility, or life with thirty year eligibility where an aggravating\r\n  circumstance is found but a death sentence not imposed.Â  Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp.\r\n  1990).Â  He received a â€œtwenty-yearâ€ life sentence.Â  In the weapons statute, the\r\n  General AssemblyÂ  has specified that the five year weapons sentence â€œdoes not\r\n  applyâ€ in only three situations: where the defendant is sentenced to death or\r\n  to life without the possibility of parole, Â§ 16-23-490(A), or where a mandatory\r\n  minimum sentence in excess of five years is required for the violent offense\r\n  itself.Â  Â§ 16-23-490(B).Â  A person convicted of murder under the current\r\n  statute would not be subject to the five year weapons sentence since the three\r\n  sentencing choices currently are death, life without the possibility of parole,\r\n  or a mandatory minimum thirty year sentence.Â  Â§ 16-3-20(A).Â  Respondent,\r\n  however, is not subject to the â€œmandatory minimumâ€ exemption. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26706","title":"The Vestry v.

Orkin\r\n    Exterminating Company, Inc., 373 S.C. 200, 644 S.E.2d 735 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  We granted Orkinâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the court of\r\n  appealsâ€™ decision.Â Â Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nThe Church of the\r\n  Holy Cross is located in Sumter and listed on the National Historic Register as\r\n  a National Historic Landmark.Â  In 1976, Holy Cross contracted with Orkin to\r\n  annually treat and inspect the church for termites.Â  Holy Cross discovered\r\n  termite damage in 2000 and brought this suit for breach of contract.Â  \r\nA jury trial was\r\n  conducted in August 2005.Â  Per his usual instructions, the trial judge\r\n  instructed the jurors before swearing them in that they should not discuss the\r\n  case among themselves or with any other person, and that they should not\r\n  undertake any investigation into the facts or law not presented to them during the\r\n  course of the trial.Â  At the end of a two-week trial, the jury returned a\r\n  verdict in favor of Orkin.Â  \r\nThree\r\n  days later, the trial judge sent a letter to all parties to inform them of a\r\n  possible case of juror misconduct.Â  The judge explained that he was contacted\r\n  the morning after the trial by alternate juror Sherry Babb.Â  Babb informed him\r\n  that juror Vicki Abrams had allegedly violated his instructions in the\r\n  following instances: (1) early in the trial, Abrams questioned aloud the\r\n  instructions not to talk about the case and made comments to other jurors in\r\n  spite of these instructions; (2) she stated that â€œthe historic peopleâ€ â€œhave\r\n  moneyâ€ and that Holy Cross was trying to get someone else to â€œpay their billsâ€\r\n  when everyone knows that â€œold buildings fall downâ€; (3) she stated that she did\r\n  not know why she had to hear both sides of the case and that she had discussed\r\n  the case with her mother, who confirmed that â€œhistoric peopleâ€ have money and\r\n  should â€œclean up their own messâ€; (4) she said she had talked to a painter who\r\n  told her that termite damage can cause building walls to collapse; (5) she said\r\n  that Holy Cross should tear down the church and bring in a double wide; and (6)\r\n  on the day of deliberation, Abrams told jurors that she had prayed with her minister\r\n  about the case, and that she had driven to Holy Cross over the weekend and that\r\n  it looked fine to her.Â  Babb also informed the judge that the jurors admonished\r\n  Abrams for violating his instructions and that the jurors paid little attention\r\n  to Abramsâ€™ comments.Â  \r\nHoly\r\n  Cross filed a motion for new trial.Â  The trial judge summoned the jurors to\r\n  appear at the courthouse on September 7, 2005, for sworn examinations.Â  The\r\n  trial judge found that Babbâ€™s allegations were â€œin large measure . . .\r\n  corroborated byâ€ the jurorsâ€™ testimony.Â  One jurorâ€™s testimony indicated that\r\n  Abrams had commented that her minister had told her that â€œthe church should\r\n  take care of the church,â€ and that â€œchurches need to stick together.â€Â  However,\r\n  none of the jurors indicated that their final deliberations were affected by\r\n  Abramsâ€™ misconduct.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  November 10, 2005, the judge held a hearing on the issue of whether Abrams\r\n  should be held in contempt of court.Â  Abramsâ€™s court-appointed attorney denied\r\n  that she had committed any premeditated wrongdoing.Â  Nevertheless, the judge\r\n  found Abrams to be in contempt of court.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 22, 2006, the judge issued an order denying Holy Crossâ€™s motion for\r\n  new trial.Â  The judge found that Holy Cross failed to â€œdemonstrate prejudice\r\n  affecting the impartiality of the verdict,â€ and that â€œ[t]he statements and\r\n  actions by Ms. Abrams were not of a kind to impermissibly influence the jury or\r\n  effect the verdict.â€Â  The judge noted that there was nothing Abrams could have\r\n  learned from driving to the church that was not already apparent from\r\n  photographs in evidence.Â  Likewise, the judge found that the statement made by\r\n  the painter was consistent with statements made by Holy Crossâ€™s witnesses and\r\n  therefore did not unduly prejudice Abramsâ€™s deliberation.Â  Finally, the judge\r\n  found that there was no evidence that Abramsâ€™s comments shaped the final\r\n  deliberations or improperly influenced the other jurors, in light of the\r\n  testimony indicating that the jurors admonished Abrams, â€œlaughed offâ€ her\r\n  comments, and generally paid her little attention.Â  The judge concluded that,\r\n  â€œhaving conducted an extensive individual voir dire of each juror and having\r\n  viewed the conduct of the offending juror, this Court has found no indication\r\n  that the juryâ€™s unanimous verdict was compromised, and [Holy Cross] has not\r\n  made the showing of any prejudice by clear and convincing evidence, as required\r\n  by the applicable case law.â€Â  Holy Cross appealed to the court of appeals.\r\nIn a\r\n  split decision, the court of appeals reversed, holding that the trial judge\r\n  erred in focusing his analysis on the eleven other jurors and in failing to\r\n  adequately consider the question of whether Abramsâ€™s own conduct, which\r\n  revealed her to be â€œunconcerned about granting [Holy Cross] the fair and\r\n  impartial trial to which it was entitled,â€ deprived Holy Cross of its right to\r\n  a fair trial.Â  In the opinion of the majority, under the circumstances of this\r\n  case, â€œwhere at least one of [Abramsâ€™ acts of misconduct] was deemed so\r\n  egregious by the trial judge that he punished [her] for criminal contempt, the\r\n  failure of the trial judge to grant a new trial based upon those acts of\r\n  misconduct amounts to an abuse of discretion.â€Â  373 S.C. at 206, 644 S.E.2d at\r\n  739.Â  The dissent concluded that the trial judge conducted the appropriate procedure\r\n  upon being presented with an allegation of misconduct, and did not err in\r\n  denying Holy Crossâ€™s motion for new trial.Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the court of appealsâ€™ decision.Â  The following questions are presented\r\n  for our review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals apply an\r\n  incorrect standard of law regarding jury misconduct? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the court of appeals err in\r\n  finding that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying Holy Crossâ€™s\r\n  motion for new trial?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nThe\r\n  granting or refusing of a motion for a mistrial lies within the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law. Â State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 63, 530 S.E.2d 626, 627-28\r\n  (2000).Â  The trial court is in the\r\n  best position to determine the credibility of the jurors; therefore, this Court\r\n  grants broad deference on this issue. Â State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 12,\r\n  515 S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nOrkin\r\n  alleges that the court of appeals applied an incorrect standard of law\r\n  regarding jury misconduct and erred in finding that the trial judge abused his\r\n  discretion in denying Holy Crossâ€™s motion for new trial.Â  We agree on both counts.Â  \r\nUnder South Carolina law, litigants are guaranteed the\r\n  right to an impartial jury. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1050 (2008) (â€œin\r\n  all civil cases any party shall have the right to demand a panel of twenty\r\n  competent and impartial jurors from which to strike a jury.â€). Â If a potential\r\n  juror has an interest in the lawsuit such that she is â€œnot indifferent in the cause,â€ the juror shall\r\n  be deemed incompetent to serve on the jury. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  14-7-1020 (2008).\r\nMisconduct\r\n  that does not affect the juryâ€™s impartiality will not undermine a verdict. Â Harris, 340 S.C. at 63, 530 S.E.2d at 627. Â In determining whether outside influences have\r\n  affected the jury, relevant factors include: (1) the number of jurors exposed,\r\n  (2) the weight of the evidence properly before the jury, and (3) the likelihood\r\n  that curative measures were effective in reducing the prejudice. Â Id. (citing Kelly, 331\r\n  S.C. at 141-42, 502 S.E.2d at 104). Â The\r\n  trial court has broad discretion in assessing allegations of juror misconduct,\r\n  and should declare a mistrial only when absolutely necessary.Â  Council, 335 S.C. at 12, 515 S.E.2d at 514.Â  Instead, the trial court should exhaust\r\n  other methods to cure possible prejudice before aborting a trial. Â Kelly,\r\n  331 S.C. at 141-42, 502 S.E.2d at 104.Â  In order to receive a mistrial, the\r\n  moving party must show error and resulting prejudice.Â  Id.\r\nI.&nbsp; Standard of Law in Cases of\r\n  Juror Misconduct\r\nOrkin\r\n  first argues that the court of appeals applied the wrong standard of law by\r\n  applying a general standard of â€œfundamental fairnessâ€ rather than the more specific\r\n  standard of actual prejudice.[1]Â \r\n  Although considerations of â€œfundamental fairnessâ€ are relevant to analyses of\r\n  jury misconduct, we agree that the court of appeals failed to grant due\r\n  deference to the trial judgeâ€™s factual finding that Holy Cross did not suffer\r\n  actual prejudice.\r\nThis Court has, in the past, used the language of â€œfundamental\r\n  fairnessâ€ to describe the constitutional implications of juror misconduct.Â  See Shumpert\r\n    v. State, 378\r\n  S.C. 62, 661 S.E.2d 369 (2008) (holding that juror testimony involving internal misconduct â€œmay be\r\n  received only when necessary to ensure fundamental fairnessâ€); State v.\r\n    Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 509 S.E.2d 811 (1999) (holding that premature jury\r\n  deliberations â€œinvolve a matter of fundamental fairness.â€). Â However, not all\r\n  juror misconduct impinges upon the fundamental fairness of a trial:Â  \r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  defeated party is not entitled to a new trial for every act of misconduct by or\r\n  affecting the jury, as such\r\n  misconduct . . . does not ipso facto justify the grant of a new trial; but in order that a new trial may\r\n  be granted on such ground the misconduct of the jury must relate to a material\r\n  matter in dispute and must be such as to indicate an influence of bias or\r\n  prejudice in the minds of the jurors.Â  \r\n\r\nC.J.S. New Trial Â§ 54 (1998).Â  See also State v. Grovenstein,\r\n  335 S.C. 347, 352, 517 S.E.2d 216, 218 (1999) (holding that misconduct does not\r\n  entitle a party to mistrial unless it affects the verdict).\r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals was thus entirely correct to discuss â€œfundamental fairnessâ€ in\r\n  the context of jury misconduct.Â  The court erred, however, by invoking the premise\r\n  of â€œfundamental fairnessâ€ - in the face of the trial judgeâ€™s determination that\r\n  there was no evidence of actual prejudice - to support its conclusion that\r\n  Abramsâ€™ misconduct was â€œso egregiousâ€ as to ipso facto justify the grant\r\n  of a new trial.Â  The majorityâ€™s error is most evident from this passage:\r\n\r\n\tAlthough\r\n  [Abrams] may not have learned anything from her visit to the site that she did\r\n  not already know and her report to the other jurors of her actions may not have\r\n  had any impact on them, [her] attempt to conduct an unsanctioned investigation\r\n  into the facts of this case, when viewed with her other acts and comments,\r\n  shows a juror unconcerned about granting Holy Cross the fair and impartial\r\n  trial to which it was entitled.\r\n\r\n373 S.C. at 207, 644 S.E.2d\r\n  at 737.Â  The dissent correctly observed that the majority placed too much\r\n  emphasis on the nature of Abramsâ€™ undoubtedly improper conduct and neglected\r\n  the determinative question of whether this conduct deprived Holy Cross of a\r\n  fair trial.Â  Id.Â  Indeed, in order to receive a mistrial, Holy Cross\r\n  bore the burden of showing that Abramsâ€™ conduct deprived it of a fair and\r\n  impartial trial, not merely that Abrams was â€œunconcernedâ€ about granting it a\r\n  fair and impartial trial.Â  The trial judge conducted an extensive inquiry and\r\n  concluded that, although improper, Abramsâ€™ misconduct did not actually\r\n  influence the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  To the extent that the majority of the court of\r\n  appeals reversed this determination because Abramsâ€™ lack of â€œconcernâ€ for her\r\n  role as an impartial juror violated â€œfundamental fairness,â€ it was in error.Â  \r\n\r\nII. Abuse of Discretion\r\nOrkin\r\n  next argues that the court of appeals erred in holding that the trial judge abused\r\n  his discretion in finding that Abramsâ€™ conduct deprived Holy Cross of a fair\r\n  and impartial trial.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  noted above, the majorityâ€™s reliance on an improper standard led it to conclude\r\n  that â€œthe failure of the trial judge to grant a new trial based upon [Abramsâ€™]\r\n  acts of misconduct amounts to an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Id.Â  In so\r\n  holding, the majority appeared to be of the opinion that Abramsâ€™ participation\r\n  in the deliberations was ipso facto evidence that her own bias tainted\r\n  the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  Setting aside the legal problems with this conclusion -\r\n  which are addressed above - it indicates that the majority failed to fully\r\n  consider the facts as well.Â  Specifically, the trial judge examined the effect\r\n  of Abramsâ€™s misconduct on the other jurorsâ€™ deliberations as well as her own.Â \r\n  The judgeâ€™s thorough fact-finding inquiry led him to the conclusion that Abrams\r\n  did not expose herself to any evidence not already in the record.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial judge thus found that there was no clear and convincing evidence that any\r\n  of the twelve jurors - including Abrams - were improperly influenced by Abramsâ€™\r\n  misconduct.Â  Bearing in mind the well-settled law that the refusal or grant of\r\n  a mistrial â€œlies within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an\r\n  error of law,â€ we hereby reverse the court of appeals.

Burnett, III and Alison R. Lee, concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent and would affirm the Court\r\n  of Appeals.Â  I agree with the Court of Appeals that it takes only one juror to\r\n  deprive the parties of a fair and impartial trial.Â  While Abrams may not have\r\n  influenced the other jurors, her actions and words are undeniable evidence of a\r\n  juror who blatantly failed to honor her oath or to follow the instructions\r\n  given her by the trial judge. I therefore agree with the majority of Court of\r\n  Appeals and would uphold the grant of a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] â€œThe basic issue here, as we see it, is whether the juror misconduct in\r\n  question affected Holy Crossâ€™ right to fundamental fairness at trial.â€Â  Holy\r\n    Cross, 373 S.C. at 204, 644 S.E.2d at 737.Â  \r\n[2] A review of this Courtâ€™s case law with regard to\r\n  juror misconduct reveals few civil cases and even fewer instances where this\r\n  Court has affirmed the finding that a mistrial was warranted.Â  See Shumpert\r\n    v.

Scarborough, Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nOpinion No.Â  26707\r\nHeard March 5, 2009 - Filed August 24,\r\n  2009Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAndrew\r\n  Epting, Jr., of Charleston, Clayton B. McCullough, and Daniel S. McQueeney,\r\n  Jr., both of Pratt-Thomas &amp; Walker, of Charleston, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tMichael\r\n  A. Molony and Lea B. Kerrison, both of Young, Clement Rivers, of Charleston,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In\r\n  this case, the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) granted\r\n  Respondentâ€™s application for a dock permit, and Petitioner appealed to the\r\n  administrative law court (ALC).Â  The ALC affirmed, and Petitioner appealed to\r\n  OCRMâ€™s Appellate Panel, which reversed the grant of the permit.Â  Respondent\r\n  appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the Appellate Panelâ€™s ruling.Â \r\n  Respondent then appealed the Court of Appeals, which reversed the circuit court\r\n  and held that Respondent was entitled to a dock permit.Â  We granted Petitioner\r\n  a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.Â Â Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn 1997, the McIver\r\n  family conveyed three parcels of land in â€œOld Villageâ€ Mount Pleasant to Neal\r\n  Brothers, Inc., of which Respondent David Neal (â€œNealâ€) is a part owner.Â  The\r\n  bulk of Nealâ€™s property is inland, and connected to Charleston Harbor by a narrow 5 foot wide, 119 foot long strip of property.Â  Neal conducted a survey of\r\n  the three parcels prior to the purchase, and recorded the survey with the\r\n  Charleston County Register of Mesne Conveyances on September 10, 1997.Â \r\n  Sometime thereafter, Neal Brothers transferred title of the property to\r\n  Tompkins and Company, LLC (â€œTompkinsâ€), which is also partly owned by Neal.Â  \r\nIn 1998, Neal first\r\n  applied for a critical area permit to build a dock from the propertyâ€™s five\r\n  feet of â€œwater frontage.â€Â  The OCRM denied the first application on the grounds\r\n  that the lot â€œdoes not meet the minimum lot width standard in order to qualify\r\n  for a single family dock.â€Â  Neal filed and then withdrew an appeal, on the\r\n  understanding that he could reapply for a permit. \r\nIn September 1999,\r\n  an adjacent property owner claimed ownership of the narrow strip that connects\r\n  Nealâ€™s property to the water.Â  The trial court examined both chains of title\r\n  and determined that Neal (through Tompkins) owned the property in fee simple\r\n  absolute.Â  \r\nIn June 2001, Neal\r\n  resubmitted his application for a critical area dock permit.Â  At the time, the\r\n  regulation controlling dock permits provided:\r\nFor lots\r\n  platted and recorded after May 23, 1993, before a dock will be permitted, a lot\r\n  must have 75 feet of water frontage along the marsh edge and at least 75 feet\r\n  of frontage between extended property lines . . . .Â  Lots less than 50 feet\r\n  wide are not eligible for a dock.\r\n23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  30-12(A)(2)(o) (Supp. 2001) (â€œthe regulationâ€).Â  On September 12, 2001, the\r\n  OCRM issued Neal a critical area dock permit, which allowed him to construct a\r\n  4 foot wide, 300 foot long dock from his 5 feet of â€œwater frontage.â€Â \r\n  Petitioner Don Brown (â€œBrownâ€), an adjacent property owner, appealed the\r\n  issuance of the dock permit to the ALC, arguing that the property was not\r\n  platted and recorded until 1997 and therefore did not comply with the\r\n  regulation.Â  The ALC found that â€œ[t]he term â€˜platted and recordedâ€™ assumes the\r\n  platting and recording involves a change in the configuration of the\r\n  property.â€Â  Finding that the 1997 recording of the survey was not the type of platting\r\n  and recording intended to fall within the purview of the regulation, but was\r\n  merely an action necessary to the purchase of land that had existed in the same\r\n  configuration for over fifty years, the ALC upheld the issuance of the permit.Â  \r\nBrown appealed the ALCâ€™s decision to the OCRMâ€™s Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel (â€œthe\r\n  Panelâ€).Â  The Panel issued a brief opinion in which it reversed the issuance of\r\n  the permit on the grounds that the ALC erred in holding that the 1997 recording\r\n  did not constitute a platting and recording for the purposes of the\r\n  regulation.Â  \r\nNeal appealed the\r\n  Panelâ€™s decision to the circuit court, which affirmed the Panel.Â  Neal then\r\n  appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed the circuit court in a split\r\n  decision.Â  David Neal v. Don H. Brown and South Carolina Department of\r\n    Health and Environmental Control, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource\r\n    Management, 374 S.C. 641, 649 S.E.2d 164 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The majority of\r\n  the court found that there was substantial evidence in the record to support\r\n  the ALCâ€™s finding that the regulation did not bar Nealâ€™s dock permit because\r\n  the property had been in the current configuration since 1940 and the 1997\r\n  survey did not amount to having the property â€œplatted and recordedâ€ under the\r\n  regulation.Â  The majority also found that the circuit court erred in making new\r\n  findings of fact on matters not decided by the Panel.Â  Brown petitioned this\r\n  Court for a writ of certiorari, and we granted the writ to answer the following\r\n  question:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  Court of Appeals err in reversing the circuit court and upholding the issuance\r\n  of Respondentâ€™s dock permit?\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn permitting cases, the ALC serves as the finder of\r\n  fact.Â  Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Env. Control, 348\r\n  S.C. 507, 520, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002).Â  The Panel can reverse the ALC if\r\n  the findings are not supported by substantial evidence or are based on an error\r\n  of law.Â  Dorman v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Env.\r\n    Control, 350 S.C. 159, 165, 565 S.E.2d 119, 122 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Judicial\r\n  review of the Panelâ€™s decision is governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)\r\n  (Supp. 2006), which provides:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the\r\n  weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  The court may affirm the decision\r\n  of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.Â  The court may\r\n  reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been\r\n  prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or\r\n  decisions are:\r\n\t(a)&nbsp; in violation of constitutional or statutory\r\n  provisions;\r\n\t(b)&nbsp; in excess of the statutory\r\n  authority of the agency;\r\n\t(c) Â made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n\t(d)&nbsp; affected by other error of law;\r\n\t(e)&nbsp; clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,\r\n  and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n\t(f)&nbsp;&nbsp; arbitrary and capricious or characterized by abuse of\r\n  discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe\r\n  central question in this case is whether Nealâ€™s property was â€œplatted and\r\n  recordedâ€ after May 23, 1993.Â  The Panel and the circuit court held that Nealâ€™s\r\n  1997 survey constituted a â€œplatâ€ under the regulation, and therefore, because\r\n  Nealâ€™s water frontage is less than 75 feet, Neal should not be granted a\r\n  critical area dock permit.Â  The Court of Appeals held that Nealâ€™s 1997 survey\r\n  did not constitute a â€œplat.â€Â  We agree with the former interpretation therefore\r\n  reverse the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find this matter foreclosed by the fact that no single plat of the property in question\r\n  was recorded prior to May 23, 1993.Â  The McIver property initially consisted of\r\n  three distinct parcels, each recorded separately with its own separate deed.Â \r\n  Neal purchased these parcels together in 1997, conducted a â€œsurvey,â€ and\r\n  recorded the property for the first time as a single lot.[1]Â \r\n  These facts alone indicate that this single piece of property was first\r\n  â€œplatted and recordedâ€ after May 23, 1993, and that the regulation precludes\r\n  the granting of a critical area dock permit.Â Â Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the majority of the Court of Appeals relied heavily on OCRM employee Richard\r\n  Chinnisâ€™s testimony before the ALC as to his interpretation of the term\r\n  â€œplat.â€Â  Chinnis drafted the regulation, and testified that the word â€œplatâ€ as\r\n  used in the regulation, was intended to indicate a subdivision of property, not\r\n  the recordation of a survey.Â  Based upon this testimony, the Court of Appeals\r\n  concluded that Nealâ€™s â€œsurveyâ€ did not constitute a â€œplatâ€ that would bring him\r\n  under the scope of the regulation, even though the Panel disagreed with\r\n  Chinnisâ€™s interpretation.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find that the Court of Appeals erred in granting Chinnisâ€™s testimony deference\r\n  over the Panelâ€™s interpretation for two reasons.Â  First, as we have previously\r\n  held, an agencyâ€™s Appellate Panel, not its staff, is typically entitled to\r\n  deference in interpreting agency regulations.Â  S.C. Coastal Conservation\r\n    League v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Env. Control, 363 S.C. 67, 75, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 482, 486 (2005).Â  The majority of the Court of Appeals should have\r\n  deferred to the Panelâ€™s interpretation, rather than Chinnisâ€™s.\r\nSecond,\r\n  the regulatory language is clear and unambiguous, and the Court of Appeals\r\n  erred in interpreting the regulation to permit the issuance of a dock permit.Â \r\n  â€œWhen a statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no\r\n  room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to\r\n  its literal meaning.â€Â  Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 498, 640 S.E.2d\r\n  457, 459 (2007).Â  In our reading, the distinction between a â€œsurveyâ€ and a\r\n  â€œplatâ€ is illusory.Â  The key question is whether a piece of real property was\r\n  mapped and recorded for the first time after the effective date of May 23,\r\n  1993.Â  Chinnisâ€™s testimony indicates that he believed the regulation was\r\n  intended to prevent the owners of newly-subdivided lots from building\r\n  docks on less than seventy-five feet of water frontage.Â  However, this could\r\n  have been easily incorporated into the language of the regulation if this was\r\n  the true intent.Â  We believe the plain language of the regulation indicates\r\n  that it was intended to prevent owners of all newly created lots - whether\r\n  subdivided or amalgamated (as in the present case) - from building docks on\r\n  less than seventy-five feet of water frontage.Â  Notwithstanding Chennisâ€™s\r\n  involvement in the drafting of the regulation, the Panel is entitled to\r\n  deference in interpreting its own regulation, and it found that the regulation\r\n  prevented the granting of a permit in this case.Â  In our view, the plain\r\n  language of the regulation supports this interpretation.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the reasons\r\n  stated herein, we reverse the opinion of the Court of Appeals.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  J., and Acting Justices James E. Moore, Perry M. Buckner and Brooks P.\r\n  Goldsmith, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The current boundary of the property was actually first recorded in 2001, after\r\n  a challenge by an adjacent landowner resulted in some minor changes to the\r\n  configuration of the property.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26708","title":"Turner v.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General\r\n  Prentiss Counts, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  TOAL: In this case, the Court granted\r\n  a writ of certiorari to review the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s denial\r\n  of relief to Petitioner Harold B. Turner.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  1994, Petitioner pled guilty to second degree burglary and was sentenced to\r\n  fifteen years imprisonment, suspended upon time served and five years\r\n  probation.Â  Subsequently, his probation was revoked.Â  Petitioner did not\r\n  directly appeal his probation revocation.Â  Petitioner filed an application for\r\n  PCR alleging probation counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of his\r\n  right to a direct appeal.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, Petitioner testified that after the revocation hearing, he\r\n  asked probation counsel, â€œWhat can we do?â€ and that counsel responded â€œthe\r\n  judge made his ruling,â€ and testified that he would have requested an appeal if\r\n  he had known his rights.Â  Probation counsel testified that there were no\r\n  appealable issues stemming from the probation revocation and that Petitioner\r\n  never inquired about an appeal.Â  The PCR court found that there were no\r\n  non-frivolous grounds for an appeal and that no extraordinary circumstances\r\n  existed and denied Petitioner relief.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari, and Petitioner\r\n  presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  PCR court err in finding probation counsel was not ineffective in failing to\r\n  advise Petitioner of his right to a direct appeal from his probation\r\n  revocation?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe burden of proof is on the applicant in post-conviction\r\n  proceedings to prove the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286\r\n  S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  On certiorari, the PCR courtâ€™s ruling should be upheld if\r\n  it is supported by any evidence of probative value in the record.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119,\r\n  386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).Â  However, this Court will reverse the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  decision when it is controlled by an error of law.Â  Pierce v. State, 338\r\n  S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAs a\r\n  primary matter, we must first address the basis upon which Petitioner claims he\r\n  is entitled to relief.Â  Since Petitioner seeks relief due to ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel, Petitioner bases his PCR application on a violation of\r\n  his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  See Duckson v. State, 355 S.C.\r\n  596, 598, 586 S.E.2d 576, 577 (2003), citing McKnight v. State, 320 S.C. 356, 465 S.E.2d 352 (1995) (observing that an ineffective assistance claim is premised on the violation of an individualâ€™s Sixth\r\n  Amendment right to counsel).Â  However, a probationer does not have a Sixth\r\n  Amendment right to counsel.[1]Â  Rather, the right to counsel\r\n  may arise pursuant to the Due Process Clause under the Fifth and Fourteenth\r\n  Amendments.Â  See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790 (1973).[2]Â  In South Carolina, however, all persons charged with\r\n  probation violations have a right to counsel and must be informed of this right\r\n  pursuant to court rules and case law.Â  Barlet v. State, 288 S.C. 481,\r\n  483, 343 S.E.2d 620, 621 (1986); Rule 602(a), SCACR.\r\nIn Duckson,\r\n  the parolee filed an application for PCR alleging that he received ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel at his parole revocation hearing.Â  In South Carolina, a\r\n  parolee has a statutory right to have counsel present at a parole revocation\r\n  hearing[3] but,\r\n  similar to a probationer, does not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  As Duckson makes clear, neither a parolee nor a probationer has a Sixth\r\n  Amendment right to counsel.Â  Accordingly, this Court held that because the\r\n  parolee could not assert a Sixth Amendment violation and because he did not\r\n  contend his due process rights were violated, the parolee failed to allege the\r\n  parole revocation was unlawful and thus failed to state a claim cognizable in a PCR action.Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  the Duckson analysis instructive to the instant case.Â  Although parole\r\n  revocation and probation revocation are different types of proceedings,[4] to the extent there is a\r\n  constitutional right to counsel in either context, it exists only by virtue of\r\n  the Due Process Clause.Â  See Gagnon,\r\n  411 U.S. 778, 782 n.3 (observing that, despite minor differences between parole\r\n  and probation, the revocation of probation is constitutionally\r\n  indistinguishable from the revocation of parole).Â  Petitioner has only alleged\r\n  a Sixth Amendment violation, namely that probation counsel was ineffective in failing to inform him of his right\r\n  to a direct appeal, and thus, under Duckson, it appears he has failed to\r\n  state a cognizable claim in a PCR action.\r\n\r\nHowever, Duckson is distinguishable from the instant case in an important respect.Â \r\n  Unlike a parolee, we have held that, pursuant to court rule, a probationer has\r\n  a right to counsel.Â  See Barlet and Rule 602(a).Â  A paroleeâ€™s statutory right to have counsel present is not\r\n  comparable to a probationerâ€™s absolute right under state law to appointed\r\n  counsel.Â  We now hold that because\r\n  a probationer has a right to counsel, albeit not a Sixth Amendment right, the\r\n  same analysis for ineffectiveness that applies in other PCR proceedings involving\r\n  claims against counsel should, by analogy, apply in PCR proceedings involving\r\n  claims against probation counsel.Â  In our view, this approach does not elevate\r\n  form over substance by, for example, allowing a probationer to proceed on a due\r\n  process violation but not allowing him to proceed on an ineffective assistance claim\r\n  despite the fact that both claims stem from the failure to be informed of his\r\n  right to appeal.Â  Additionally, this approach eases confusion as well as the\r\n  burden on the lower courts by providing a uniform standard.[5]\r\nTo this end, we must\r\n  determine whether, under our Strickland jurisprudence, probation counsel\r\n  was ineffective for failing to inform Petitioner of his right to appeal the\r\n  revocation of his probation.Â  We hold\r\n  that he was not.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  a trial, counsel must inform a defendant who has been found guilty of a crime of the possibility of an appeal and the\r\n  method for taking an appeal.Â  Frasier v.\r\n    State, 306 S.C. 158, 161, 410 S.E.2d 572, 574 (1991).Â  In a plea\r\n  proceeding, however, there is no requirement that plea\r\n  counsel inform a defendant of the right to a direct appeal absent extraordinary\r\n  circumstances.Â  Weathers v. State, 319\r\n  S.C. 59, 61, 459 S.E.2d 838, 839 (1995); see also Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470 (2000) (holding that counsel\r\n  has a constitutional duty to inform a defendant of his right to appeal a guilty\r\n  plea if there is reason to think that a rational defendant would want to appeal\r\n  or that the defendant demonstrated an interest in appealing).[6]\r\nWe\r\n  hold that probation counsel is not required to inform a probationer of his\r\n  right to an appeal absent extraordinary circumstances.Â  This holding is in\r\n  accord with counselâ€™s duties at a plea hearing.Â  See Weathers,\r\n  319 S.C. at 61, 459 S.E.2d at 839 (holding that, â€œabsent extraordinary\r\n  circumstances, there is no constitutional requirement that a defendant be\r\n  informed of the right to a direct appeal from a guilty plea.â€).Â  In our view, a probationer should not be afforded additional protections\r\n  in a probation revocation hearing, a proceeding that is not a stage of criminal\r\n  prosecution and that occurs after sentencing, which are not constitutionally\r\n  mandated in a guilty plea hearing.Â  In other words, probation counsel is not held\r\n  to a higher performance standard than that imposed upon plea counsel.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the PCR court found probation counselâ€™s testimony more\r\n  credible than Petitionerâ€™s testimony. Â Additionally, there is evidence in the\r\n  record to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that there were no non-frivolous grounds for an appeal and\r\n  that no extraordinary circumstances existed.Â  Accordingly, because Petitioner failed to show extraordinary circumstances, he\r\n  is not entitled to relief.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor these reasons,\r\n  we affirm the PCR courtâ€™s order denying Petitioner relief.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In Huckaby v. State, 305 S.C. 331, 408 S.E.2d 242 (1991), we held that a\r\n  probationer must be informed of his right to counsel and he must make a willing\r\n  and knowing waiver of counsel.Â  We also stated that â€œa\r\n  probationer retains his full Sixth Amendment right to counsel.â€Â  Id. at 335, 408 S.E.2d at 244.Â  Because a probationer does not have a Sixth\r\n  Amendment right to counsel, this statement is incorrect, and any interpretation\r\n  of the opinion asserting that a probationer is afforded the same constitutional\r\n  protections as an accused is erroneous.Â  A South Carolina probationerâ€™s right\r\n  to counsel in a probation revocation hearing is grounded in our case law and\r\n  court rules.Â  A constitutional right to counsel may arise pursuant to\r\n  the Due Process Clause, but cannot arise pursuant to the Sixth Amendment.\r\n[2] In Gagnon v. Scarpelli, the Supreme Court held that whether a probationer has a\r\n  constitutional right to counsel in a revocation hearing should be decided on a\r\n  case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the complexity of alleged\r\n  violations and whether the probationer can meaningfully contest the alleged\r\n  violations.Â  \r\n[3] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-50 (Supp. 2002).\r\n[4] Parole eligibility is a collateral consequence of sentencing and\r\n  is a matter that falls within the province of the Board of Probation, Parole,\r\n  and Pardon Services.Â  Brown\r\n    v. State, 306\r\n  S.C. 381, 382, 412 S.E.2d 399, 400 (1991); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-13 (Supp. 2006).Â  Probation,\r\n  on the other hand, is a matter within the jurisdiction of the trial court and\r\n  is judicially-imposed at the time\r\n  of sentencing.Â  Duckson, 355 S.C. at 598 n. 2, 586 S.E.2d at 578 n. 2; S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-450 (Supp. 2006).Â  \r\n[5] Our holding today does not alter our PCR jurisprudence regarding claims of\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel, nor should it be interpreted as creating\r\n  additional rights to PCR applicants.Â  Indeed, this Court has granted relief\r\n  based on â€œineffective assistanceâ€ of PCR counsel despite the fact that the\r\n  right to PCR counsel arises from Rule 71.1, SCRCP, and not from the\r\n  constitution.Â  See e.g., Washington v. State, 324 S.C. 232, 478 S.E.2d\r\n  833 (1996) (granting PCR where the defendant alleged ineffective assistance of\r\n  PCR counsel due to so many procedural irregularities) and Austin v. State,\r\n  305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395 (1991) (recognizing that the constitutional right\r\n  to counsel does not extend to discretionary appeals on collateral attack, but\r\n  allowing a PCR applicant to receive a belated appeal from the denial of his\r\n  initial PCR application where first PCR counsel failed to file a notice of\r\n  appeal); but see Aice v. State, 305 S.C. 448, 451, 409 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1991) (holding\r\n  that an allegation that prior PCR counsel was ineffective is not per se a sufficient reason allowing for a successive PCR application).Â  \r\n[6] Although decided prior to Flores-Ortega, the Weathers analysis is\r\n  compatible with the Flores-Ortega analysis and remains good law.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26709","title":"Richardson v.

Graham, both of Hudson Law Firm, of Myrtle Beach, for\r\n  Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tWilliam\r\n  Walker, Jr., of Walker &amp; Morgan, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Respondent filed suit against Appellants following the drowning\r\n  death of Respondentâ€™s son.Â  Appellants failed to respond to the complaint and\r\n  an entry of default was entered.Â  The trial court denied Appellantsâ€™ motion to\r\n  lift the entry of default.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nOn June 19, 2004, Dominick Richardson drowned in the\r\n  swimming pool at Harbor Inn, a hotel owned by Jay Patidar located in Georgetown,\r\n  South Carolina.Â  Respondent filed survival and wrongful death actions arising\r\n  out of the drowning.Â  On May 12, 2005, a process server, Bobby Asbill, arrived\r\n  at the Harbor Inn to serve the summons and complaint and asked the employee\r\n  working at the desk, Demetria Cruel, if he could speak with the manager.Â  Cruel\r\n  informed Asbill that Patidar[1] was out of town for several days.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  her deposition, Cruel testified that Asbill told her that he was not coming\r\n  back to the hotel and asked if she would call Patidar.Â  She complied and gave\r\n  the phone to Asbill, but testified that she could not hear their conversation.Â \r\n  Cruel testified that after the phone conversation was finished, Asbill left the\r\n  papers and walked out of the hotel.Â  She later spoke with Patidar and informed\r\n  him that Asbill left the papers.Â  Patidar instructed Cruel to fax the summons\r\n  and complaint to his insurance agent.Â  \r\nAsbill\r\n  testified that when he spoke to Patidar on the phone, he identified himself and\r\n  the reason for his visit.Â  Patidar told him that he could leave the papers with\r\n  Cruel or that he could come back when Patidar was there.Â  Asbill also testified\r\n  that he asked Cruel if Patidar gave her permission to accept the papers and she\r\n  said â€œyes.â€Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  Patidar testified that he told Asbill that he would be back in four or five\r\n  days, but that Asbill told him that he (Asbill) was not coming back.Â  Patidar\r\n  then told Asbill it was up to Asbill whether or not to leave the papers.Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  failed to answer the complaint and an entry of default was entered on June 24,\r\n  2005.Â  Appellants subsequently moved to set aside the entry of default.Â  The trial\r\n  court denied the motion finding that service was effective, thereby conferring\r\n  personal jurisdiction on the court, and that Appellants failed to show good\r\n  cause to set aside the entry of default.Â  This Court certified the appeal\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and Appellants present the following issues for\r\n  review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in ruling that\r\n  service of process was effective and that the court therefore had personal\r\n  jurisdiction over Appellants?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in ruling\r\n  that Appellants failed to show good cause to set aside the entry of default?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\nThe decision whether to set aside an entry of default or a default\r\n  judgment lies solely within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Roberson v. S. Fin. of South Carolina, Inc., 365 S.C. 6, 9, 615 S.E.2d 112,\r\n  114 (2005).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of that\r\n  discretion.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI. Service of Process\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in\r\n  finding service of process was effective.Â  We disagree.\r\nService\r\n  upon a corporation may be made â€œby delivering a copy of the summons and\r\n  complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent\r\n  authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.â€Â  Rule\r\n  4(d)(3), SCRCP.Â  Rule 4 serves at least two purposes: it confers personal\r\n  jurisdiction on the court and assures the defendant of reasonable notice of the\r\n  action.Â  Roche v. Young Bros., Inc. of Florence, 318 S.C. 207, 209, 456\r\n  S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995).Â  Exacting\r\n  compliance with the rules is not required to effect service of process.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nNot every employee of a corporation is an agent of the corporation\r\n  for the purposes of service of process.Â  See Roberson, 365 at\r\n  115, 615 S.E.2d at 11 (holding that a clerical employee was not an agent\r\n  authorized to accept service of process for the corporation).Â  Whether an\r\n  employee may accept service on behalf of a corporation depends on the authority\r\n  the corporation conferred upon the employee.Â  In order to determine whether an\r\n  employee is an authorized agent, the court must look to the circumstances\r\n  surrounding the relationship and find authority which is either express or\r\n  implied from the type of relationship between the defendant and the alleged\r\n  agent.Â  Moore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 523, 473 S.E.2d 64, 67 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996).Â  While actual authority is expressly conferred upon the agent by the\r\n  principal, apparent authority is when the principal knowingly permits the agent\r\n  to exercise authority, or the principal holds the agent out as possessing such\r\n  authority.Â  Roberson, 365 at 115, 615 S.E.2d at 10-11.\r\nIn the instant case, even if Cruel did not have actual authority,\r\n  we find that she had apparent authority to accept service of process.Â  When Asbill initially entered the hotelâ€™s office,\r\n  Cruel was the only employee present, which represented to third parties that\r\n  she was in charge.Â  Asbill testified that Patidar told him that he could leave\r\n  the papers with Cruel or that he could come back.Â  Patidar similarly testified\r\n  that he told Asbill it was up to him whether to leave the papers.Â  Under these\r\n  facts, we find that Patidar knowingly permitted Cruel to exercise authority to\r\n  accept service of process and further find that his manifestations to Asbill\r\n  indicated that Cruel had such authority. \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, we hold that evidence in the record supports the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that Cruel was authorized to accept service.Â  Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 583, 560 S.E.2d 624, 631 (Ct. App. 2001) (recognizing that the findings of the circuit court on factual issues arising\r\n  on a motion to quash service of process for lack of jurisdiction are binding on\r\n  the appellate court unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by\r\n  error of law).\r\n\r\nII.Â  Rule\r\n  55(c)\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  that the trial court erred in\r\n  ruling that they failed to show good cause to set aside the entry of default.Â \r\n  Specifically, Appellants claim that the insurance companyâ€™s failure to respond was\r\n  inadvertent and constitutes good cause to justify setting aside the entry of\r\n  default.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe standard for granting relief from an entry of default is good cause under Rule 55(c), SCRCP,\r\n  while the standard is more rigorous for granting relief from a default judgment\r\n  under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  Sundown Operating Co., Inc. v. Intedge Indus.,\r\n    Inc., Op. No. 26700(S.C. Sup. Ct. Filed August 17, 2009).Â  In deciding\r\n  whether good cause exists, the trial court should consider the following\r\n  factors: (1) the timing of the defendantâ€™s motion for relief, (2) whether the\r\n  defendant has a meritorious defense, and (3) the degree of prejudice to the\r\n  plaintiff if relief is granted.Â  Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., 298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 502 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  The\r\n  decision whether to set aside an\r\n  entry of default or a default judgment\r\n  lies solely within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion. Harbor\r\n    Island Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Preferred Island Prop., Inc., 369 S.C. 540, 544,\r\n  633 S.E.2d 497, 499 (2006).\r\nAs a\r\n  primary matter, Appellants argue that the trial court erred in ruling on the\r\n  merits of this issue because they did not have the opportunity to be heard and present\r\n  evidence of good cause.Â  We disagree.Â  In\r\n  their written motion to set aside the entry of default filed prior to the\r\n  hearing, Appellants maintained that the entry of default was void because service\r\n  of process was defective.Â  Additionally, Appellants requested that, if the trial\r\n  court denied relief based on this ground, the trial court â€œschedule a\r\n  subsequent hearing based upon the ground of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or\r\n  excusable neglectâ€[2] because the insurance companies were still investigating the matter and they\r\n  would â€œshortly have full information to support such a Motion.â€Â  At the hearing,\r\n  Respondentâ€™s counsel told the trial court that Appellants were moving to set\r\n  aside the entry of default based on improper service and good cause and argued\r\n  the merits of the good cause issue.Â  Specifically, Respondentâ€™s counsel argued\r\n  that there was nothing in the record from the insurance company explaining why\r\n  it failed to answer the complaint and that, even if the failure to respond was\r\n  due to negligent oversight, this did not constitute good cause.Â  In rebuttal, Appellantsâ€™\r\n  counsel argued that although the discovery process concerning the insurance companyâ€™s\r\n  failure to respond had not been completed, â€œwe just really donâ€™t think we need\r\n  to go that far.â€Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the trial court issued its order ruling that Appellants failed to show good\r\n  cause, Appellants filed a motion to reconsider arguing that the trial court\r\n  failed to consider the second part of the motion and never notified Appellants\r\n  that it was denying their request for bifurcation.Â  Additionally, Appellants\r\n  attached affidavits from the insurance agent and the insurance company\r\n  explaining why the insurance company never responded to the complaint.Â  The\r\n  trial court denied the motion for reconsideration.\r\nIn\r\n  our view, bifurcation of this motion was not necessary, much less appropriate.Â \r\n  Both â€œhalvesâ€ of the motion went to the same issue, namely whether the trial\r\n  court should set aside the entry of default, and Appellants had the opportunity\r\n  to present evidence of improper service and good cause at the hearing.[3]Â  In any event, we find that Appellants failed to reserve their\r\n  right to revisit this issue.Â  Appellants failed to move for bifurcation at the\r\n  hearing, and even assuming that they requested bifurcation in the written\r\n  motion filed prior to the hearing, Appellants did not seek a specific ruling on\r\n  bifurcation from the trial court at the hearing.Â  Furthermore, if the insurance\r\n  company was in fact still investigating the incident, Appellants failed to seek\r\n  a continuance in order to complete discovery on this issue.[4]Â  In our view, Appellants were given a full and fair opportunity\r\n  to be heard on this matter, and furthermore, Appellants had an opportunity to explain\r\n  to the trial court why they needed more time to develop the record as to this\r\n  issue.Â  \r\nNonetheless,\r\n  even considering the affidavits, Appellantsâ€™ argument fails on the merits.[5]Â  The insurance\r\n  agentâ€™s affidavit indicates that he received a copy of the incident report, the\r\n  police report, and inspection reports from the Department of Heath and\r\n  Environmental Control (DHEC) from Patidar shortly after the drowning occurred\r\n  and that he mailed these documents to the insurance company.[6]Â \r\n  He also stated that after the complaint was filed, he began receiving\r\n  correspondence from Respondentâ€™s counsel addressed to him as well as another\r\n  attorney.Â  The insurance agent assumed the other attorney was defense counsel\r\n  hired by the insurance company when in fact the attorney was another attorney\r\n  for the plaintiff.Â  The insurance agent stated he was not aware that the\r\n  summons and complaint that Patidar forwarded to him were not also forwarded to\r\n  the insurance company.Â  An affidavit from the insurance company indicates that\r\n  it never received the incident report from the insurance agent and the\r\n  insurance companyâ€™s internal process of contacting the adjusting company was\r\n  therefore never triggered.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold that even assuming that the\r\n  insurance company was at fault for not answering the complaint, Appellants\r\n  failed to show good cause.Â  Negligence of an insurance company is imputed to a\r\n  defaulting litigant and cannot constitute good cause to relieve Appellants from\r\n  the entry of default.Â  See Roberts v. Peterson, 292 S.C. 149, 355 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App.\r\n  1987) (observing that the â€œcourts\r\n  of this state have consistently held that the negligence of an attorney or\r\n  insurance company is imputable to a defaulting litigantâ€) and Williams v. Vanvolkenburg, 312 S.C. 373, 440 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994) (imputing an attorneyâ€™s negligence to a defaulting litigant).Â \r\n  Moreover, the Wham factors do not weigh in favor of lifting the entry of\r\n  default.Â  Appellants filed the motion to set aside over two months after the\r\n  entry of default, and Appellants have not asserted a meritorious defense or\r\n  argued that Respondent will not be prejudiced if the entry of default is\r\n  lifted.Â  \r\nÂ Accordingly,\r\n  we hold that Appellants have not established good cause to justify lifting the\r\n  entry of default.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we\r\n  affirm the trial courtâ€™s order refusing to set aside the entry of default.Â  \r\nWALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Patidar is the registered agent for Harbor Inn.Â  \r\n[2] Appellants appear to have confused the Rule 55(c) â€œgood causeâ€ standard with\r\n  the more rigorous Rule 60(b) â€œexcusable neglectâ€ standard in the motion to set\r\n  aside the entry of default.Â  See Sundown, Op. No. 26700 (S.C. Sup. Ct.\r\n  Filed August 17, 2009) (explaining and comparing the applicable standards in a\r\n  Rule 55(c) motion and a Rule 60(b) motion).\r\n[3] Appellantsâ€™ counsel submitted a letter to the trial court the day after the\r\n  hearing â€œregarding the issue of â€˜good causeâ€™â€ and including case law supporting\r\n  their position. \r\n[4] We note that although Appellantsâ€™ counsel claimed the insurance company was\r\n  still investigating the matter, he was able to submit the affidavits from the\r\n  insurance company shortly after the hearing.Â  \r\n[5] In their brief, Appellants request that this Court â€œconsider [the affidavits]\r\n  and rule upon the â€˜good causeâ€™ issue.â€\r\n[6] The insurance agent stated that he sells insurance policies and places coverage\r\n  for his clients, but he has no role in the litigation process and once he reports\r\n  a claim, the matter is transferred to the insurance company.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"The Friends of McLeod, Inc. v.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Donald J.

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79\r\n  (1986).Â  The court of appeals affirmed the trial court, and Petitioners filed a\r\n  writ of certiorari asking this Court to review and reverse the court of appeals\r\n  decision.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nPetitioners\r\n  Jason, Maceo, and Jonais Edwards, all brothers, were tried jointly for the\r\n  murders of Joe Woods and Jimmy Robinson in January 2006.Â  During jury\r\n  selection, the trial court was not able to impanel an entire twelve member jury\r\n  because it ran out of venire persons during the selection process.Â  During the\r\n  selection process, Petitioners had used sixteen of a possible twenty preemptory\r\n  strikes to strike nine Caucasian and seven African American potential jurors.Â  The\r\n  State made a Batson motion on the grounds that Petitionerâ€™s strikes were\r\n  racially motivated, and the trial court heard the motion, despite the fact that\r\n  a full jury was not yet impaneled.Â  The trial court granted the Stateâ€™s Batson motion, holding that jurors 19, 50, and 131 were struck on racially cognizable\r\n  grounds.Â  The trial court quashed the first jury, and a new jury was\r\n  selected.Â Â  Jurors 50 and 131 were selected for the second jury, and the case\r\n  proceeded to trial.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Petitioners Jason and Maceo Edwards guilty of murder and found\r\n  Petitioner Jonais Edwards guilty of accessory after the fact of murder.Â \r\n  Petitioners appealed their convictions and sentences, and the court of appeals\r\n  affirmed.Â  State v. Edwards, 374 S.C. 543, 649 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  This Court granted Petitionersâ€™ petition for a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the following question:\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  trial court err in quashing the first jury panel based upon a violation of Batson\r\n    v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986)?\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of review\r\nIn criminal cases, this Court will review errors of\r\n  law only.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220\r\n  (2006).Â  This Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they\r\n  are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527\r\n  S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).Â  On\r\n  review, this Court is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion. Â State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 200, 391 S.E.2d 244, 247\r\n  (1990).Â  This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling is supported by any\r\n  evidence.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioners assert\r\n  that the court of appeals erred in upholding the trial courtâ€™s decision to\r\n  grant the Stateâ€™s Batson motion.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\n  United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venire person on the\r\n  basis of race or gender. Â State v.\r\n    Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 211, 499 S.E.2d 209, 211 (1998). Â When one party strikes a\r\n  member of a cognizable racial group or gender, the trial court must hold a Batson hearing if the opposing party requests one. Â See State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 629-30, 515 S.E.2d 88, 90-91 (1999)\r\n  (explaining the proper procedure for a Batson hearing). Â The proponent of the\r\n  strike must offer a race or gender neutral explanation. Â Id. Â The opponent must show the race or gender neutral explanation was mere\r\n  pretext, which is generally established by showing the party did not strike a\r\n  similarly situated member of another race or gender. Â Id.Â  Under\r\n  some circumstances, the explanation given by the proponent may be so\r\n  fundamentally implausible the trial judge may determine the explanation was\r\n  mere pretext, even without a showing of disparate treatment. Â Id.\r\nWhether a Batson violation has occurred must be determined\r\n  by examining the totality of the facts and circumstances in the record. Â Riddle v. State, 314 S.C. 1, 14, 443 S.E.2d 557, 565 (1994). Â The opponent of the strike carries the\r\n  ultimate burden of persuading the trial court that the challenged party\r\n  exercised strikes in a discriminatory manner. Â State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996). Â Appellate courts give the trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  finding great deference on appeal and review the trial judgeâ€™s ruling with a\r\n  clearly erroneous standard. Â State v.\r\n    Dyar, 317 S.C. 77, 79, 452 S.E.2d 603, 604 (1994).\r\nThe trial judgeâ€™s findings of purposeful discrimination rest\r\n  largely on his evaluation of demeanor and credibility. Â Sumpter v. State, 312 S.C. 221, 224, 439 S.E.2d\r\n  842, 844 (1994). Â Often the demeanor of the challenged attorney will be the best and only evidence of discrimination, and\r\n  an â€œevaluation of the [attorneyâ€™s] mind lies peculiarly within a trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  province.â€ Â Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 365 (1991). Â Furthermore, a strike must\r\n  be examined in light of the circumstances under which it is exercised,\r\n  including an examination of the explanations offered for other strikes. Â State v. Oglesby, 298 S.C. 279, 280, 379 S.E.2d\r\n  891, 892 (1989).\r\nIf a\r\n  trial court improperly grants the Stateâ€™s Batson motion, but none of the\r\n  disputed jurors serve on the jury, any error in improperly quashing the jury is\r\n  harmless because a defendant is not entitled to the jury of her choice.Â  State\r\n    v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 114, 631 S.E.2d 244, 248 (2006).Â  However, if\r\n  one of the disputed jurors is seated on the jury, then the erroneous Batson ruling has tainted the jury and prejudice is presumed in such cases â€œbecause\r\n  there is no way to determine with any degree of certainty whether a defendantâ€™s\r\n  right to a fair trial by an impartial jury was abridged.â€Â  Id. at 114,\r\n  631 S.E.2d at 248.Â  The proper remedy in such cases is the granting of a new\r\n  trial.Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  challenged jurors 50 and 131 during the first jury selection.[1]Â \r\n  Following the trial courtâ€™s quashing of the first jury, Petitioners were not\r\n  allowed to strike these jurors from the second jury and jurors 50 and 131 were\r\n  impaneled for Petitionersâ€™ trial.Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  initially challenged juror 50 on the grounds that he was a newspaper editor and\r\n  might have knowledge of or have written a story about the case.Â  Petitioners\r\n  challenged juror 131 on the grounds that she worked for the Department of Motor\r\n  Vehicles (DMV) and interacted with law enforcement on a regular basis.Â  \r\nThe State argued in\r\n  its Batson motion that both explanations were pretext for racial\r\n  prejudice on the grounds that there was no evidence that juror 50 ever wrote an\r\n  article about the case and that striking all DMV employees was so broad as to be\r\n  evidence of pretext.Â  The trial court ruled that the explanations given for\r\n  jurors 50 and 131 were not racially neutral, but the court did not specifically\r\n  articulate its reasoning.Â  The court of appeals upheld the trial court, finding\r\n  that â€œthe record contains sufficient justification to conclude there was no\r\n  abuse of discretion.â€Â Â Â  \r\nWe find that the\r\n  explanations given for jurors 50 and 131 were race neutral and that the trial\r\n  court committed clear error in granting the Stateâ€™s Batson motion.Â  Employment\r\n  is a well-understood and recognized consideration in the exercise of peremptory\r\n  challenges.Â  State v. Williams, 379 S.C. 399, 402-03, 665 S.E.2d 228,\r\n  230 (Ct. App. 2008); State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 65, 512 S.E.2d 500, 504\r\n  (1999) (holding place of employment is a race-neutral reason for a strike); State\r\n    v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 125, 470 S.E.2d 366, 372 (1996) (finding type of\r\n  employment is a race-neutral reason for a strike).Â  Petitionersâ€™ stated\r\n  concerns that juror 50 was a journalist and juror 131 was a state employee who\r\n  interacted regularly with law enforcement are race neutral reasons to strike.Â \r\n  The State bore the burden of demonstrating that these proffered explanations\r\n  were pretext for racial discrimination.Â  We find no evidence that the State met\r\n  this burden and the trial court clearly erred in finding otherwise.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the forgoing\r\n  reasons, we reverse the opinion of the court of appeals and remand for a new trial.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although Petitionersâ€™ strike of juror 19 was also found to be discriminatory,\r\n  Petitioners have not raised that issue in this appeal.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26712","title":"Metts v.

Kerr, of Buist, Moore, Smythe &amp; McGee, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  We granted certiorari to review the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Metts v. Mims, 370 S.C. 529, 635 S.E.2d 640\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006). Â The Court of Appeals in Metts affirmed an order\r\n  granting summary judgment to respondents (Newspapers), and therefore did not\r\n  address the cross-appeals from the contempt order.Â  We affirm petitionerâ€™s\r\n  issues related to the discovery order, reverse the summary judgment decision,\r\n  and remand back to the Court of Appeals for resolution of Newspapersâ€™ appeal\r\n  regarding the contempt order.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner Robert William Metts is the Deputy County Supervisor of Berkeley County.Â  On July 30, 2003, Newspapers each published a front-page article with the\r\n  headline:Â  â€œIt was helpful, but was it legal?â€Â  The article discussed a\r\n  controversial work policy instituted by County Supervisor Jim Rozier which\r\n  allowed county employees to work on private property in competition with\r\n  private businesses.Â  In the story, defendant Judy Mims[1] was quoted as saying that county employees had been seen performing yard work\r\n  on petitionerâ€™s private property.[2]Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  sued Newspapers claiming that the statements in the article were defamatory\r\n  because they suggested he was improperly benefiting from the services of county\r\n  employees.Â  According to petitioner, he had yard work performed by private\r\n  companies and never utilized county employees.Â  Petitioner further contended\r\n  that defendant Mims fabricated the story because she had a â€œlongstanding vendettaâ€\r\n  against petitionerâ€™s supervisor, Rozier, who is an elected official.\r\nDuring\r\n  the discovery phase of the lawsuit, petitioner sought to obtain Newspapersâ€™\r\n  financial information for use in the punitive damages portion of trial.Â  When Newspapers\r\n  declined to provide the information, petitioner obtained an order compelling\r\n  its production.Â  Newspapers subsequently sought a contempt order to permit them\r\n  to immediately appeal the discovery order.Â  See, e.g., Tucker\r\n    v. Honda of South Carolina Mfg., 354 S.C. 574, 577, 582 S.E.2d 405,\r\n  406-07&nbsp;(2003) (â€œan order compelling discovery may be appealed only after\r\n  the trial court holds a party in contemptâ€).Â  The trial\r\n  court issued the contempt order, but declined to impose any sanctions. Â Both\r\n  petitioner and Newspapers filed appeals from the contempt order.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the contempt order was issued, the trial court heard Newspapersâ€™ summary\r\n  judgment motion.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of\r\n  Newspapers finding that petitioner failed to meet his burden of producing clear\r\n  and convincing evidence that Newspapers acted with constitutional actual\r\n  malice.Â  See Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002)\r\n  (libel plaintiff who is a public figure must produce clear and convincing\r\n  evidence of actual malice in order to withstand defendantâ€™s summary judgment\r\n  motion).\r\nPetitioner\r\n  timely appealed from the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment.Â  The\r\n  appeals from the trial courtâ€™s orders were consolidated for review.Â  The Court\r\n  of Appeals affirmed the summary judgment order and further held that this\r\n  affirmance mooted the cross-appeals from the contempt order.Â  Metts, supra.Â \r\n  We granted petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in holding that the \r\n\t\t\ttrial court had the authority to rule on Newspapersâ€™ summary \r\n\t\t\tjudgment motion?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in declining to \r\n\t\t\taddress the merits of petitionerâ€™s appeal from the contempt order?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the grant \r\n\t\t\tof summary judgment?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the summary judgment\r\n  motion because he had filed an appeal from the contempt order before the\r\n  order granting summary judgment was filed. Â Resolution of this argument requires\r\n  a review of the following timeline of events:\r\n\r\n\tAugust\r\n  25, 2004:Â  Judge Jefferson issues discovery\r\n  order compelling Newspapers to provide the fÂ­Â­Â­Â­inancial information sought by petitioner.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tDecember\r\n  22, 2004: Newspapers move for summary\r\n  judgment.Â  \r\n\tMarch\r\n  8, 2005:Â  Judge Dennis hears contempt\r\n  action filed by petitioner when Newspapers decline to comply with Judge\r\n  Jeffersonâ€™s August 2004 discovery order.\r\n\tMarch\r\n  8, 2005:Â  Unsigned Form 4\r\n  order is filed, finding Newspapers in contempt and holding summary judgment\r\n  motion in abeyance.Â  The form also states:Â  â€œFormal order to follow.â€\r\n\tApril\r\n  7, 2005: The Berkeley Count Clerk of Court\r\n  asks the parties to disregard/destroy the unsigned Form 4 order dated March 8,\r\n  2005.Â  This memorandum indicates the request is â€œa follow-up to previous\r\n  conversations.â€Â  \r\n\tApril\r\n  28, 2005:Â  Judge Dennis issues order\r\n  on March contempt hearing, finding Newspapers in contempt, but imposing no\r\n  sanctions.Â  The trial court also states that Newspapersâ€™ summary judgment\r\n  motion should be rescheduled for hearing but stays trial pending that hearing.Â \r\n  This order was filed at 4:56 p.m. on April 29, 2005.\r\n\tApril\r\n  29, 2005:Â  Judge Young hears Newspapersâ€™\r\n  summary judgment motion.\r\n\tMay\r\n  27/June 2, 2005:Â  Newspapers and petitioner\r\n  appeal Judge Dennisâ€™s order holding Newspapers in contempt but refusing to\r\n  impose any sanctions.\r\n\tJune\r\n  20, 2005:Â  Judge Young issues an order\r\n  granting Newspapers summary judgment.Â  \r\n\r\nAccording\r\n  to petitioner, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the summary\r\n  judgment motion because he had appealed Judge Dennisâ€™s contempt order on June\r\n  2, 2005, before Judge Youngâ€™s order granting summary judgment was filed on June\r\n  20, 2005.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note that petitioner couches this argument as one involving the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Generally speaking, subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to\r\n  which the proceedings in question belong.Â  E.g. Dove v. Gold Kist,\r\n    Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 442 S.E.2d 598 (1994).Â  Circuit courts have\r\n  jurisdiction over general tort cases, such as the instant defamation case. Â See Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 422, 567 S.E.2d 231,\r\n  234&nbsp;(2002).Â  Accordingly, petitionerâ€™s â€œsubject matterâ€ jurisdiction claim\r\n  is inapposite.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  also cites Rule 205, SCACR, in support of his argument.Â  Pursuant to Rule 205,\r\n  the service of a notice of appeal gives the appellate court exclusive jurisdiction over the appeal.Â  Nonetheless, this rule also provides that a\r\n  trial court may proceed â€œwith matters not affected by the appeal.â€Â  Here, the\r\n  contempt order resulted from Newspapersâ€™ refusal to comply with a discovery\r\n  order compelling it to provide financial data relevant to petitionerâ€™s punitive\r\n  damages claim.Â  Newspapersâ€™ motion for summary judgment, however, was on the\r\n  merits of petitionerâ€™s libel claim.Â  We find the summary judgment matter was\r\n  unaffected by the appeal of the contempt order.Â  Cf. Grosshuesch v.\r\n    Cramer, 377 S.C. 12, 31 n.7, 659 S.E.2d 112, 122 n.7&nbsp;(2008) (where the\r\n  Court noted that the trial court properly ruled on a second discovery matter\r\n  involving a deposition after the parties had filed appeals from the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s first order because the first order dealt with the subject of initial\r\n  discovery responses).Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling on the constitutional actual\r\n  malice issue was clearly unrelated to the discovery dispute involving the\r\n  Newspapersâ€™ financial data.Â  Thus, the trial court properly proceeded on the\r\n  summary judgment motion, despite the pending appeal on the contempt order. Â Rule\r\n  205, SCACR.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  further contends that because Judge Dennis orally held the summary judgment\r\n  motion in abeyance, and this was memorialized in the unsigned Form 4 order\r\n  filed in March 2005, Judge Young was unauthorized to hold the summary judgment\r\n  hearing on April 29, 2005.Â  We disagree.Â  The Form 4 order was not signed by\r\n  the judge and it specifically indicated a formal order would follow.Â \r\n  Therefore, this form order was not in any way final.Â  See Culbertson\r\n    v. Clemens, 322 S.C. 20, 23, 471 S.E.2d 163, 164 (1996) (a decree leaving\r\n  some further act to be done by the court is not final); see also Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd, 350 S.C.\r\n  596, 605, 567 S.E.2d 514, 518 (Ct. App. 2002) (a form\r\n  order is a final order only if the circuit court indicates that nothing else\r\n  remains to be done after it is signed).Â Â Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  petitioner asserts that, as a matter of public policy, a party which has been\r\n  held in contempt should not be heard by the court until the contempt has been\r\n  resolved.Â  We find this argument is unpreserved for appellate review.Â  Although\r\n  petitioner raised this argument at the summary judgment hearing, it was not\r\n  addressed in the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  Petitioner then failed to include this\r\n  issue in his motion for reconsideration.Â  Accordingly, the argument is procedurally\r\n  barred, and the Court of Appeals properly did not address it. Â E.g., Elam\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (â€œA\r\n  party must file [a Rule 59(e)] motion when an issue or argument has been\r\n  raised, but not ruled on, in order to preserve it for appellate review.â€)\r\n  (emphasis in original).\r\nII.\r\nPetitioner maintains\r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in failing to address his argument that Judge Dennis\r\n  improperly declined to impose sanctions on Newspapers for its contempt.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals, having upheld the grant of summary judgment, declined to\r\n  address the merits of the contempt cross-appeals citing Jarrell v. Petoseed\r\n    Co., 331 S.C. 207, 209-10, 500 S.E.2d 793, 794 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œCivil\r\n  contempt proceedings designed to coerce compliance generally terminate along\r\n  with the termination of the main action.â€).Â  Regardless, where a party chooses\r\n  to be held in contempt in order to immediately appeal a discovery order, it is\r\n  within the discretion of the trial court to forego sanctions. Â E.g., Lindsay\r\n    v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 338, 491 S.E.2d 583, 588&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (â€œEven\r\n  though a party is found to have violated a court order, the question of whether\r\n  or not to impose sanctions remains a matter for the courtâ€™s discretion.â€).Â \r\n  Clearly, under the circumstances of the instant case, it was within Judge\r\n  Dennisâ€™s discretion to not impose contempt sanctions on Newspapers.\r\nIII.\r\nFinally, petitioner\r\n  argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s order granting\r\n  summary judgment for Newspapers.Â  Because we find there is an issue of fact\r\n  regarding actual malice, we agree with petitioner that the Court of Appeals\r\n  erred by upholding summary judgment.\r\nA motion for summary judgment shall be granted â€œif the\r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â For summary judgment purposes, a court must\r\n  view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Â E.g., George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874&nbsp;(2001).Â \r\n  Because it is â€œa drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked\r\n  so that no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed\r\n  factual issues.â€Â  Baughman v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101,\r\n  112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543&nbsp;(1991) (citation and internal quotation marks\r\n  omitted).\r\nIn\r\n  addition to the common law elements of defamation, a public figure has the\r\n  constitutional burden of proving that the defendant published the alleged\r\n  defamatory material with â€œactual malice.â€Â  Anderson\r\n    v. Augusta Chronicle, 365 S.C. 589, 594-595, 619 S.E.2d 428, 431&nbsp;(2005)\r\n  (citing New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 269 (1964)). Â To establish\r\n  â€œactual malice,â€ the plaintiff must show the defendant published the defamatory\r\n  material with the knowledge it was false or with reckless disregard of whether\r\n  or not it was false.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. at 451,\r\n  548 S.E.2d at 874 (citing New York Times, supra).\r\nâ€œ[T]he\r\n  reckless conduct contemplated by the New York Times standard is not\r\n  measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would\r\n  have investigated before publishing.â€Â  Id. at 456, 548 S.E.2d at 876.Â  Instead, the actual\r\n  malice standard â€œis a subjective one - there must be sufficient evidence to\r\n  permit the conclusion that the defendant actually had a â€˜high degree of\r\n  awareness of ... probable falsity.â€™â€Â  Harte-Hanks Comm., Inc. v. Connaughton,\r\n  491 U.S. 657, 688 (1989) (citation omitted).Â  Reckless disregard â€œmay be found\r\n  where there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the\r\n  accuracy of his reports.â€Â  St. Amant v. Thompson,&nbsp;390 U.S. 727, 732 (1968).Â  Moreover, while the failure to investigate without more will not\r\n  support a finding of actual malice, â€œthe purposeful avoidance of the truth is\r\n  in a different category.â€Â  Harte-Hanks Comm., Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. at 692.Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that the following evidence creates a genuine issue of fact regarding\r\n  actual malice:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n\t\t\tBefore publishing the story, the reporter obtained \r\n\t\t\tfrom Berkeley County a list of people who had received the services \r\n\t\t\tfrom county employees pursuant to the controversial policy; \r\n\t\t\tpetitionerâ€™s name was not on that list.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tThe reporter had time to change the story, but she \r\n\t\t\tdid not.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe reporter did not attempt to contact petitioner \r\n\t\t\tfor comment or verification.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4.\r\n\t\t\tThe reporter did not ask Mims who had told Mims \r\n\t\t\tthey observed county employees doing yard work at petitionerâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tproperty.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5.\r\n\t\t\tThe reporter was aware that Mims and petitionerâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tboss, Rozier, had an adversarial relationship with one\r\n  another.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHere,\r\n  viewing the record in a light most favorable to petitioner, there was\r\n  sufficient clear and convincing evidence to create an issue of fact on the\r\n  question of actual malice.Â  The reporter obtained information from Councilwoman\r\n  Mims, who was known to be a political nemesis of petitionerâ€™s supervisor.Â \r\n  Moreover, the information from Mims was directly contradicted by the list the\r\n  reporter received because petitionerâ€™s name was not on the list of those\r\n  getting yard services from county employees.Â  This is direct evidence that\r\n  called into question the accuracy of Mimsâ€™ statements.Â  Therefore, the reporter\r\n  arguably had reason to doubt Mimsâ€™ veracity.Â  St. Amant v. Thompson,&nbsp;supra (when there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the\r\n  accuracy of her reports, reckless disregard may be found); see also Stevens\r\n    v. Sun Publâ€™g Co., 270 S.C. 65, 72, 240 S.E.2d 812, 815&nbsp;(1978) (where\r\n  the Court found that actual malice can be established when reporters â€œprint\r\n  articles on the basis of an admittedly unreliable source, without further\r\n  verificationâ€).Â  Looking at the totality of the evidence,\r\n  a jury could infer reckless conduct sufficient to meet the New York Times standard of actual malice.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold summary judgment was improper.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the\r\n  Court of Appeals on the issue of summary judgment is reversed, but on all other\r\n  issues raised by petitioner, the Court of Appeals opinion is affirmed.Â  Because\r\n  Newspapersâ€™ original appeal from the contempt order is no longer moot, we\r\n  remand the matter back to the Court of Appeals.\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in part and\r\n  dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.Â  I agree with\r\n  the majority that the circuit court had jurisdiction to rule on the summary\r\n  judgment motion.Â  I disagree, however, with the decision to reverse the Court\r\n  of Appealsâ€™ decision which affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary\r\n  judgment to Newspapers.\r\nI find no evidence\r\n  of actual malice here. Â Actual malice is not satisfied by a showing of ill\r\n  will, nor is the recklessness of a libel defendantâ€™s conduct â€œmeasured by\r\n  whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would have\r\n  investigated before publishing.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 548\r\n  S.E.2d 868 (Â­2001) citing St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968).Â  Petitioner was required to, but did not, produce evidence that the Newspapers\r\n  â€œentertained serious doubts as to the truth ofâ€ councilwoman Mims statement.Â  See St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. at 731.Â  Only where the plaintiff can\r\n  show â€œan extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting\r\n  ordinarily adhered to by reasonable publishersâ€ can a public figure plaintiff\r\n  withstand a motion for summary judgment on the issue of actual malice.Â  Anderson  v. Augusta Chronicle, supra.Â  In my view, petitioner did\r\n  not meet this burden here.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  actual malice standard is premised on our â€˜profound national commitment to the\r\n  principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and\r\n  wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes\r\n  unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.â€™â€ George v.\r\n    Fabri, 345 S.C. at 456-457, 548 S.E.2d at 876, citing New York Times v.\r\n      Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964).Â  Here, Newspapers published information\r\n  about a county official, information given to them by another county official.Â \r\n  That petitionerâ€™s name was not on a list provided by a different county\r\n  official is not evidence that publishing the story was â€œan extreme departure\r\n  from investigative standardsâ€ nor was there any evidence that Newspapers in\r\n  fact harbored serious doubts about councilwoman Mimsâ€™ story.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  reporterâ€™s knowledge of the political enmity between councilwoman Mims and\r\n  petitioner, combined with her failure to further investigate Mimsâ€™ statement\r\n  before publishing it, is â€œpatently insufficientâ€ to prove actual malice.Â  Elder\r\n    v. Gaffney Ledger, 341 S.C. 108, 533 S.E.2d 899 (2000).Â Â  Finally, the gist\r\n  of the allegedly defamatory story, that county employees were seen performing\r\n  yard work on petitionerâ€™s property, is not particularly inflammatory given that\r\n  the county had in place a policy permitting this practice.\r\nI would affirm the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mims, who was a county councilwoman at the time, is now deceased.\r\n[2] After the story was published, Mims called the reporter and denied having made\r\n  the statement attributed to her about petitioner; one of the Newspapers printed\r\n  a correction.Â  Petitioner alleges, however, that while the correction included\r\n  his own denial of what was reported, it essentially reiterated the\r\n  objectionable statement from Mims.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26713","title":"Hill v.

Chaplin Spencer, Jr., both of Spencer &amp; Spencer, of Rock Hill,\r\n  for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A\r\n  group of York County landowners challenge the power of the York County Natural\r\n  Gas Authority to condemn land to construct a natural gas transmission\r\n  pipeline.Â  The landowners appeal from the trial courtâ€™s determination that the York\r\n  County Natural Gas Authority has the statutory authority to condemn their\r\n  property and construct the pipeline.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  July 2006, the York County Natural Gas Authority commenced proceedings to\r\n  condemn real property in York County for the purpose of constructing a natural\r\n  gas transmission pipeline.Â  Eleven of the affected property owners (Landowners)\r\n  answered the notice of condemnation by filing a complaint in August 2006\r\n  challenging the authority of the York County Natural Gas Authority to condemn\r\n  their real property.Â  The case went to trial under various causes of action,\r\n  and the trial court found that the York County Natural Gas Authority had the\r\n  authority to condemn Landownersâ€™ property.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\tLandowners\r\n  appeal, raising two issues for review: \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1) \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;â€œThe evidence and statutory interpretation do \r\n\t\t\tnot support the [trial] courtâ€™s findings that Blacksburg is a new \r\n\t\t\tsource and thus, that Respondent did not exceed its authority under \r\n\t\t\tthe Enabling Act.â€ \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2) \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;â€œThe trial court erred in finding that the \r\n\t\t\tNotices of Condemnation based on incorrect statutory authority can \r\n\t\t\tbe amended.â€ \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe York\r\n  County Natural Gas Authority (Authority) is a special purpose district and\r\n  corporate entity created by Act No. 959 of 1954.Â  In 1957, by Act No. 694, section\r\n  1 of the original Act was amended to read as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIt shall\r\n  be the function of the authority to purchase, lease, acquire, build, construct,\r\n  maintain and operate natural gas distribution systems within the service area\r\n  hereinafter defined and such transmission lines as may be necessary to\r\n  transport natural gas to the distribution systems from the transmission lines\r\n  to be constructed by [South] Carolina Pipeline Company or other sources from\r\n    which natural gas may now or hereafter become available . . . .\r\n\r\nAct No. 694, 1957 S.C. Acts\r\n  1427 (emphasis added).Â  By Act No. 193, which became effective on June 12,\r\n  1995, the Act was amended in several respects, including expansion of the\r\n  Authorityâ€™s service area beyond York County.Â  Section 1 of the Act was amended\r\n  to read as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIt is\r\n  the function of the authority to purchase, lease, acquire, build, construct,\r\n  maintain, and operate natural gas distribution systems within the service area\r\n  defined in this act and such transmission lines as may be necessary to\r\n  transport natural gas to the distribution systems from the transmission lines\r\n  owned by South Carolina Pipeline Company or other sources from which natural\r\n    gas may become available after the effective date of this act.Â Â  \r\n\r\nAct No. 193, 1995 S.C. Acts 1569\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the outcome of this case turns on the meaning of the statutory term â€œother\r\n  sources,â€ we need not delve extensively into the detailed factual history prior\r\n  to the 1995 Act, including the Authorityâ€™s once exclusive reliance on the South\r\n  Carolina Pipeline Company (SCPC) and the reasons that prompted a change in that\r\n  relationship.Â  We simply note the Authority joined with its sister special\r\n  purpose districts in Lancaster and Chester counties to form a joint agency\r\n  called Patriots Energy Group (PEG) pursuant to the Joint Agency Act.[1]Â \r\n  The goal of PEG was to â€œenable these natural gas special purpose districts to\r\n  jointly undertake the acquisition and construction of natural gas facilities.â€Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the authority provided in the Joint Agency Act, PEG issued bonds to cover its\r\n  acquisition and construction costs.Â  One of PEGâ€™s construction projects was to\r\n  integrate its transmission system with the Town of Blacksburgâ€™s natural gas\r\n  system.Â  Blacksburg is in Cherokee County.Â  Blacksburg is connected to the Transcontinental\r\n  Pipeline Corporationâ€™s interstate pipeline (the Transco pipeline).[2]Â \r\n  Thus, linking in with Blacksburgâ€™s natural gas system would allow the Authority\r\n  (and its sister authorities, all under the umbrella of PEG) to connect to the\r\n  Transco pipeline.Â  \r\nPursuant to this\r\n  plan PEG and Blacksburg entered into a capacity sharing agreement.Â  The agreement\r\n  included upgrading five miles of Blacksburgâ€™s system from Blacksburg, eastward\r\n  to the Town of Kings Creek.Â  This upgrade, which has been completed, involved\r\n  replacing the existing 6-inch distribution line with an 8-inch high-pressure steel\r\n  transmission pipeline. \r\nIn\r\n  order to link up with the pipeline at Kings Creek, the Authority began\r\n  condemnation proceedings (the proceedings being challenged in this lawsuit) to\r\n  acquire rights-of-way to lay down 42.2 miles of 12-inch steel transmission\r\n  pipeline.Â  The transmission pipeline will run from Kings Creek, eastward across\r\n  York and Chester Counties.Â  \r\nLandowners challenge the Authorityâ€™s power of eminent domain,\r\n  contending the connection to the Blacksburg natural gas system and the Transco\r\n  pipeline is not statutorily authorized.Â  Specifically, Landowners rely on that\r\n  part of Act 193 that restricts the Authority to â€œother sources from which\r\n  natural gas may become available after the effective date of this act.â€Â  The\r\n  Act became law on June 12, 1995.Â  Because the Transco pipeline existed prior to\r\n  June 1995, Landowners contend the Authority lacks statutory authorization to\r\n  connect to the Transco pipeline and thus may not condemn their property.\r\nThe trial court\r\n  did not read â€œother sourcesâ€ so narrowly.Â  The trial court noted that, â€œ[t]he\r\n  Act references the pre-1995 sources as â€˜the transmission lines owned by South\r\n  Carolina Pipeline Company.â€™Â  The source is not the South Carolina Pipeline\r\n  Company, but rather its transmission lines.â€Â Â  \r\nIn discerning legislative intent, â€œ[a]ll rules of statutory\r\n  construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if\r\n  it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be\r\n  construed in light of the intended purpose of the statute.â€Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002).Â  â€œ[W]ords in a\r\n  statute must be construed in context.Â  . . .Â  [T]he meaning of particular terms\r\n  in a statute may be ascertained by reference to words associated with them in\r\n  the statute.â€Â  S. Mut. Church Ins. Co. v. S.C. Windstorm &amp; Hail\r\n    Underwriting Assâ€™n, 306 S.C. 339, 342, 412 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1991) (internal\r\n  citations omitted).Â  â€œThe language must also be read in a sense which\r\n  harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.â€Â  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846\r\n  (1992).Â  \r\nBeginning with the\r\n  premise that a source means transmission lines, the trial court went on to note\r\n  that prior to the upgrade of the 5-mile pipeline from Blacksburg to Kings\r\n  Creek, the 5-mile pipeline was a distribution line.Â  After the upgrade, the\r\n  pipeline became a transmission line.Â  The trial court noted â€œ[t]he evidence\r\n  demonstrates that the Town of Blacksburg was not an available source for\r\n  transportation capacity to [the Authority] prior to June 12, 1995.Â  After the\r\n  1995 Act, the Town of Blacksburg upgraded and expanded its system.â€ Â Therefore,\r\n  the trial court found â€œ[t]he upgrade of the existing distribution line to a\r\n  high pressure transmission line provides the Town of Blacksburg with the\r\n  capacity to transport gas to [the Authorityâ€™s] system.Â  Accordingly, the Town\r\n  of Blacksburg became an available source within the meaning of the 1995 Act\r\n  upon completion of the upgraded line.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Authority takes no issue with the temporal limitation imposed by Act 193.Â  The\r\n  Authority responds that â€œBlacksburgâ€™s system was not capable of providing PEG\r\n  or [the Authority] with transportation services prior to 1995.Â  The\r\n  construction upgrades from a distribution line did not even occur until 2004 or\r\n  2005.â€Â  \r\nWhen construing Act 193 in its entirety, we are persuaded the\r\n  result reached by the circuit court is the correct one.Â  We believe the\r\n  Legislature did not intend â€œother sourcesâ€ in the restrictive manner urged by\r\n  Landowners.Â  We first recognize the Legislature stated that â€œ[i]t is the intent\r\n  of this legislation to provide a means of ensuring that reasonably priced natural\r\n  gas service is available to all citizens who desire the service within the\r\n  service area of the authority.â€Â  Act No. 193 at 1574.Â  We next recognize, as\r\n  did the trial court, the phrase immediately preceding â€œother sourcesâ€ grants to\r\n  the Authority the power to construct and operate â€œnatural gas distribution\r\n  systems . . . from the transmission lines owned by South Carolina\r\n  Pipeline Company.â€ Â Act No. 193 at 1569 (emphasis added).Â  We construe â€œother\r\n  sourcesâ€ as referring to transmission lines, consistent with the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  interpretation.\r\nThe\r\n  balance of Act 193 supports this interpretation.Â  For example, section 2\r\n  provides the following: \r\n\r\n\tThe service area of the authority includes all of York\r\n  County and each municipality within the county, all the Town of Smyrna to\r\n  include that portion of the town which is within the boundaries of Cherokee\r\n  County, and that portion of Cherokee County beginning at the intersection of\r\n  the Broad River, the York County line, and the Cherokee County lines; extending\r\n  in a northwesterly direction along the center line of the Broad River to the\r\n  center of the Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corporationâ€™s [Transcoâ€™s]\r\n  right-of-way; thence in a northeasterly direction along the center line of the\r\n  Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corporationâ€™s right-of-way to its intersection\r\n  with the North Carolina state line; thence east along the common boundary of\r\n  North Carolina and Cherokee County to the York County line.Â  \r\n\r\nAct No. 193 at 1569-70.\r\n\r\n\tThe Act further\r\n  provides:\r\n\tThose\r\n  areas in Cherokee County, which may now or in the future be served by the Blacksburg municipal system, must be excluded from the [A]uthorityâ€™s distribution system,\r\n\tbut\r\n    may be served by its transmission system.\r\n\t(B) The Town of Blacksburg owns and operates a gas\r\n  system which is capable of providing gas service to the portion of the service\r\n  area of the [A]uthority in Cherokee County except for the portion located in\r\n  the Town of Smyrna.Â  The town is responsible for the distribution of gas to end\r\n  users located in such service area and may supply this gas service either\r\n  through its transmission lines and distribution lines or by connecting its\r\n    distribution lines to the transmission lines of the [A]uthority upon the\r\n  payment of a reasonable tap fee and a reasonable transportation charge to the [A]uthority\r\n  for the use of its transmission lines.\r\n\r\nAct No. 193 at 1570 (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nThe Authority and Blacksburg have acted in accordance with this statutory authorization.Â  \r\nThe interpretation advanced by the Landowners would create\r\n  an irreconcilable conflict in the Act.Â  Consequently, we construe the term\r\n  â€œother sourcesâ€ in a manner that reconciles and harmonizes the language with\r\n  other provisions of the Act.Â  See Hitachi\r\n    Data, 309 S.C. at 178, 420 S.E.2d at\r\n  846 (â€œThe language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its\r\n  subject matter and accords with its general purpose.â€); see also S. Mut.\r\n    Church Ins., 306 S.C. at 342, 412 S.E.2d at 379 (noting that the â€œCourt may\r\n  not, in order to give [e]ffect to particular words, virtually destroy the\r\n  meaning of the entire context; that is, give the particular words a\r\n  significance which would be clearly repugnant to the statute, looked at as a\r\n  whole, and destructive of its obvious intentâ€).Â  This result further gives efficacy to the Joint Agency Act.Â  Because Blacksburgâ€™s system was not capable of providing PEG (or the Authority) with\r\n  transportation services prior to June 1995, the post-June 1995 addition of the\r\n  transmission pipeline from Blacksburg to Kings Creek made the Blacksburg system\r\n  an available source under the Act.Â  In view of the statutory authorization, the\r\n  Authority is empowered to condemn the subject properties.Â  \r\nII.\r\nLandownersâ€™\r\n  final challenge concerns the trial courtâ€™s failure to dismiss the condemnation\r\n  proceedings based on the incorrect statutory authority referenced in the\r\n  original condemnation notices.Â  The trial court ruled that the Authorityâ€™s â€œfailure\r\n  to cite the proper statutory authority in the Notice of Condemnation may be\r\n  appropriately redressed by an amendment to the notice.â€Â  We observe that no\r\n  party was prejudiced by the reference to the incorrect statutory reference, for\r\n  all parties were well aware of the central dispute concerning legislative\r\n  intent in Act 193.Â  Moreover, Landowners concede that under Act 193 the\r\n  Authority has the power to condemn property. Â We affirm the trial court\r\n  pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons\r\n  stated, the judgment of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E.

As to Husbandâ€™s appeal, we affirm pursuant to\r\n  Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married on November 29, 1973 and separated on October\r\n  26, 2003.[1]Â \r\n  On October 31, 2003, Wife filed a complaint in family court seeking legal\r\n  separation and alimony (â€œthe 2003 Actionâ€).Â  Husband filed an answer and\r\n  counterclaim in the 2003 Action.Â  \r\nMediation for the 2003 Action was conducted in September 2004, and\r\n  a number of issues were settled.Â  In the written mediation agreement, the\r\n  parties each reserved â€œthe right to seek alimony from the other until such time\r\n  as [Wife] is fully employed with benefits,[2] at which time this reservation will terminate.â€Â  \r\nA few months later, the parties signed a written agreement (â€œthe\r\n  Agreementâ€) which had been prepared by Husbandâ€™s lawyer and stated the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n\tBoth parties agree that they will not seek a divorce on the\r\n  grounds of adultery; they will proceed with divorce on the grounds of living\r\n  separate and apart in excess of one year.Â  The parties also agree that\r\n    neither party will use adultery as a bar to alimony.\r\n\tFurther, both parties agree to be equally responsible for college\r\n  tuition and costs for their son.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).Â  The Agreement referenced the case number associated with the 2003\r\n  Action.Â  Husband signed this document on December 29, 2004, and Wife signed on\r\n  January 7, 2005.Â  Â Â Â  \r\nAlso on January 7, 2005, Wife filed a divorce complaint (â€œthe 2005\r\n  Actionâ€).[3]Â \r\n  The 2005 Action sought a divorce based on continuous separation for one year.Â \r\n  Wife requested alimony, both pendente lite and permanently, as well as\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Husband promptly filed an answer and counterclaim, also\r\n  requesting a divorce based on continuous separation for one year.Â  The family\r\n  court issued a temporary order awarding Wife spousal support in the amount of\r\n  $1,236.00 per month, which represented one third of Husbandâ€™s gross pay at the\r\n  time.Â  \r\nOver one year later, however, Husband filed a motion to amend his\r\n  answer.Â  Husbandâ€™s amended answer and counterclaim requested a divorce on the\r\n  ground of adultery and also alleged that Wife was in a relationship â€œtantamount\r\n  to marriage.â€Â  Husband claimed Wife should be denied alimony.Â  The family court\r\n  granted his motion to amend.Â  \r\nIn March 2007, the family court held a final hearing.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, the parties admitted the mediation agreement from the 2003 Action,\r\n  stating that all issues had been resolved except for alimony and attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees with respect to the 2005 Action.[4]Â \r\n  The family court approved the mediation agreement, and it was incorporated into\r\n  the final order.Â  \r\nWife testified that she no longer works as a nurse due to her\r\n  depression.[5]Â \r\n  Her treating psychiatrist testified by deposition that Wife has major\r\n  depression, an anxiety disorder, and bipolar disorder.Â  In his opinion, Wife is\r\n  medically unable to work.Â  In February 2007, Wife applied for Social Security\r\n  disability benefits.Â  According to her financial declaration, her only income\r\n  is the temporary alimony from Husband.Â  Husband testified that he has worked\r\n  for the railroad for 34 years.Â  According to his financial declaration, he\r\n  earns $3,600.00 per month.Â  \r\nRegarding the Agreement, Husband testified that he directed his\r\n  attorney to prepare it.Â  Husband further explained as follows:\r\n\r\n\tMe and [Wife] talked, and we were supposed to get a divorce like\r\n  adults.Â  I didnâ€™t want my children embarrassed by us going by adultery, knowing\r\n  that their mama had adultery - committed adultery and I had adultery.Â  And I\r\n  thought we was just going to get [the divorce] on the conclusion that weâ€™ll\r\n  both go our separate ways.Â  I didnâ€™t know I was signing a paper for her to be\r\n  with a man.Â  I didnâ€™t know I was giving her a license to cheat.\r\n\r\nHusband\r\n  acknowledged he was about to move in with his girlfriend when he signed the\r\n  document.Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to Wife, Husband asked her to sign the Agreement because â€œhe wanted to move in\r\n  with his girlfriend, [and] he didnâ€™t want me to seek the divorce on the grounds\r\n  of adultery.Â  And because I had no problem with him doing that, I didnâ€™t mind\r\n  signing the paper.â€Â  Wife maintained she did not commit adultery prior to\r\n  signing the paper, and would not have had sex with anyone but for the\r\n  Agreement.\r\nHusband attempted to establish that Wife was continuously living with\r\n  her boyfriend, Calvin Moss.[6]Â \r\n  Wife and Moss met in May 2004 and became intimate in February 2005.Â  In\r\n  exchange for helping Wife maintain her three trailer properties and repair her\r\n  cars, Moss lives in one of Wifeâ€™s trailers without paying rent.Â  Both Moss and\r\n  Wife admitted that although they had lived together at times, they never\r\n  cohabited for more than two through four weeks at a time.Â  Moss testified they\r\n  do not have any financial arrangements together.Â  Both Moss and Wife testified\r\n  that their relationship is not exclusive and they date other people.Â  In\r\n  addition, the partiesâ€™ 27-year-old son (â€œSonâ€) testified he had not witnessed\r\n  his mother and Moss cohabiting for 90 continuous days.Â  \r\nHusband raised questions about Wifeâ€™s decrease in utilities usage,\r\n  such as water and gas, and introduced copies of the utilities bills to suggest\r\n  that Wife was not actually living at the trailer she said she was.Â  Wife, Son,\r\n  and Moss testified that she turned off the utilities and used kerosene lamps in\r\n  an attempt to save money.\r\nThe family court issued a written order barring Wife from\r\n  receiving alimony because Husband established by clear and convincing evidence\r\n  that Wife and Moss had been in an adulterous relationship since early 2005.Â \r\n  Regarding Wifeâ€™s argument that the Agreement estopped Husband from requesting\r\n  alimony be denied, the family court found the Agreement was an unenforceable\r\n  contract and in contravention of public policy.Â  The family court specifically\r\n  declined to rule on the statutory issue of whether Wife and Moss resided\r\n  together for a period of 90 days or more.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-130(B) (Supp. 2008).Â  Finally, the family court ruled that the parties\r\n  shall pay their own legal fees.Â  \r\n\r\nWife\r\n  and Husband both appeal from the family courtâ€™s order.\r\nISSUES\r\nWifeâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in finding Wife was barred \r\n\t\t\tfrom receiving alimony when the parties agreed in writing that \r\n\t\t\tneither would use adultery as a bar to alimony?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in failing to award Wife \r\n\t\t\tattorneyâ€™s fees?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHusbandâ€™s\r\n  Appeal\r\n\r\n\tDid the family court err in failing to terminate Wifeâ€™s right to\r\n  alimony based on continuous cohabitation with her boyfriend?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court\r\n  has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence.Â  E.g., Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76,\r\n  82, 650 S.E.2d 465, 469&nbsp;(2007).Â  However, this broad scope of review does\r\n  not require this Court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Wooten\r\n    v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102&nbsp;(2005).\r\nâ€œQuestions\r\n  concerning alimony rest within the sound discretion of the family court judge\r\n  whose conclusion will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of\r\n  discretion.â€Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96,\r\n  97&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is\r\n  controlled by some error of law or is based on findings of fact that are\r\n  without evidentiary support.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Effect of the Agreement\r\nBased\r\n  on the doctrines of waiver and estoppel, Wife argues the Agreement should have\r\n  been enforced to prevent Husband from asserting the bar on alimony based on\r\n  adultery.Â  We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina statutory law provides that no alimony may be awarded to a spouse who commits\r\n  adultery before either: (1) the formal signing of a written property or marital\r\n  settlement agreement, or (2) the entry of a permanent order of separate\r\n  maintenance and support or of a permanent order approving a property or marital\r\n  settlement agreement between the parties.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(A).\r\nâ€œWaiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or\r\n  relinquishment of a known right.â€Â  Parker v. Parker, 313 S.C. 482, 487,\r\n  443 S.E.2d 388, 391&nbsp;(1994).Â  Stated differently, waiver requires a party\r\n  to have known of a right and known he was abandoning that right.Â  Strickland,&nbsp;375\r\n  S.C. at 85, 650 S.E.2d at 471.Â  â€œEquitable estoppel occurs where a party is\r\n  denied the right to plead or prove an otherwise important fact because of\r\n  something which he has done or failed to do.â€Â  Parker, 313 S.C. at 487,\r\n  443 S.E.2d 391.Â  This Court has recognized that â€œthe distinction between waiver and\r\n  estoppel is close, and sometimes the doctrines merge into each other with\r\n  almost imperceptible gradations.â€Â  Id. (citation omitted); Strickland, supra.\r\nWe\r\n  find the Agreement here constitutes a waiver of the right to use adultery as a bar\r\n  to alimony.Â  Clearly, Husband knew of this right as it was his lawyer who drew\r\n  up the Agreement.Â  Therefore, Husband intentionally abandoned this right.Â  Strickland,&nbsp;supra.Â  Moreover, Husband actively sought Wifeâ€™s signature on\r\n  the Agreement because he was about to move in with his girlfriend.Â  Thus, the\r\n  trial court erred in not finding Husband was equitably estopped from using\r\n  Wifeâ€™s subsequent adultery as a bar to alimony. Â See Parker, supra.\r\nHusband argues that the Agreement contravenes public policy, and\r\n  therefore, the family court correctly did not enforce the Agreement.Â  See Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50,\r\n  54 n.2, 426 S.E.2d 760, 762 n.2&nbsp;(1993) (â€œThe general rule is that courts\r\n  will not enforce a contract which is violative of public policy, statutory law,\r\n  or provisions of the Constitution.â€).Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  our opinion, the Agreement was a mutual promise to not sue for divorce based on\r\n  adultery, and to not raise adultery as a bar to alimony.Â  In other words, the\r\n  Agreement was not against public policy, it simply was a valid waiver.Â  Hence,\r\n  it must be enforced.Â  See Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. at 501,\r\n  602 S.E.2d at 98 (the family court â€œmust enforce an unambiguous contract\r\n  according to its terms regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent\r\n  unreasonableness, or the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefullyâ€) (internal\r\n  quote marks and citation omitted); cf. Maxwell v. Maxwell, 375\r\n  S.C. 182, 650 S.E.2d 680 (Ct. App. 2007) (upholding a written non-modifiable\r\n  separation agreement which included alimony to the wife as well as a promise\r\n  not to bring a divorce action based on adultery, even though the husband later\r\n  discovered the wife had committed adultery before the agreementâ€™s execution); Croom\r\n    v. Croom, 305 S.C. 158, 406 S.E.2d 381 (Ct. App. 1991) (upholding\r\n  court-approved written settlement of the parties which included alimony to the\r\n  wife and an agreement to not bring divorce action based on adultery despite the\r\n  wifeâ€™s subsequent cohabitation with her paramour).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we reverse the family courtâ€™s ruling that the Agreement was unenforceable and\r\n  remand the matter for a determination of the proper type and amount of alimony\r\n  for Wife.Â  See Â§ 20-3-130(C) (enumerating factors to be considered when\r\n  making an alimony award).\r\n\r\n2.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife argues the family court erred by not awarding her\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nAn\r\n  award of attorneyâ€™s fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court\r\n  and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  E.g., Patel\r\n    v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  In determining\r\n  whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider each partyâ€™s\r\n  ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained by counsel,\r\n  the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the\r\n  partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77,\r\n  415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).\r\nGiven\r\n  our disposition on Wifeâ€™s first issue, the family court should reconsider\r\n  Wifeâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees on remand.Â  See Semken v. Semken,\r\n  379 S.C. 71, 664 S.E.2d 493&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008) (where the family courtâ€™s decision to terminate the husbandâ€™s \r\nalimony obligation was reversed, the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees was remanded for reconsideration).\r\nHusbandâ€™s Appeal\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred by not finding Wife was barred from receiving\r\n  alimony based on her continuous cohabitation with her boyfriend. Â We affirm\r\n  pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  Strickland\r\n    v. Strickland, 375 S.C. at 89, 650 S.E.2d at 472 (in order to bar alimony\r\n  based on â€œcontinued cohabitation,â€ it must be established that the supported\r\n  spouse lives â€œunder the same roof as the person with whom they are romantically\r\n  involved for at least ninety consecutive daysâ€); Semken v. Semken, 379\r\n  S.C. at 77, 664 S.E.2d at 497&nbsp; (section 20-3-130 â€œrequires the spouse and\r\n  the paramour to actually â€˜live under the same roofâ€™ for ninety consecutive\r\n  days, rather then merely claim the same residence for that time periodâ€).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons discussed above, we reverse the family courtâ€™s finding that Wife is\r\n  barred from receiving alimony and remand to the family court for:Â  (1) a\r\n  determination of the appropriate alimony award; and (2) reconsideration of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  request for attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties have one son who was over 18 and\r\n  attending college at the time the parties separated.\r\n[2] Wife received her associateâ€™s degree in nursing in\r\n  1987 and became a licensed registered nurse in 1988.Â  From that time until\r\n  2001, she worked full time as a nurse at Greenville Memorial hospital.Â  Wife\r\n  stopped working due to depression. She briefly returned\r\n  to nursing in 2004, but left the job after a few months when she had a\r\n  breakdown and was hospitalized for depression.Â  \r\n[3] The 2003 Action had been\r\n  administratively dismissed.\r\n[4] In the mediation agreement, Husband agreed to pay Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees of $3,000.\r\n[5] See fn. 2, supra. \r\n[6] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(B) (Supp. 2008)\r\n  (which provides that alimony terminates upon â€œthe remarriage or continued\r\n  cohabitation of the supported spouseâ€).Â  This section also provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tFor\r\n  purposes of this subsection and unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the\r\n  parties, â€œcontinued cohabitationâ€ means the supported spouse resides with\r\n  another person in a romantic relationship for a period of ninety or more\r\n  consecutive days. Â The court may determine that a continued cohabitation exists\r\n  if there is evidence that the supported spouse resides with another person in a\r\n  romantic relationship for periods of less than ninety days and the two\r\n  periodically separate in order to circumvent the ninety-day requirement. \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
