Yarborough, of Columbia, pro se.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  This attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter arises out of Respondentâ€™s conviction of obstruction of justice.Â \r\n  Following a hearing, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission)\r\n  recommended that Respondent be retroactively disbarred.Â  The Office for\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) objects to the Commissionâ€™s recommendation and argues\r\n  that the Court should disbar Respondent Ernest Yarborough effective from the\r\n  date of the Courtâ€™s opinion.Â  We agree with the Commission and retroactively\r\n  disbar Respondent from the date of his interim suspension.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\nIn 1996, Respondent\r\n  was indicted for common law obstruction of justice and offering a witness money\r\n  with the intent to influence testimony in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  8-13-705 (Supp. 1998) in connection with his representation of a defendant who\r\n  was charged with burglary.[1]Â \r\n  The State presented evidence that Respondent offered the accuser money to drop\r\n  the charges against the defendant and that he sent an investigator to pressure\r\n  the accuser to drop the charges.Â  The jury found Respondent guilty of\r\n  obstruction of justice, but acquitted him on the statutory violation.Â  \r\nOn April 3, 1997,\r\n  following the conviction, this Court placed Respondent on interim suspension\r\n  pursuant to Rule 17(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Respondent exhausted his\r\n  appeals from the conviction on August 15, 2006, and on December 8, 2006, ODC\r\n  filed formal charges against him.Â  Respondent failed to file an answer and was\r\n  held in default.Â  Subsequently, a hearing was held before the Commission to\r\n  determine the appropriate sanction.Â  The Commission recommended that Respondent\r\n  be disbarred retroactively from the date of his interim suspension.\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nODC\r\n  argues that due to the gravity of the conviction and Respondentâ€™s disciplinary\r\n  history, the Commission erred in recommending retroactive disbarment.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nObstruction\r\n  of justice is classified as a â€œserious crimeâ€ under the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement.Â  See Rule 2(aa), RLDE, Rule 417, SCACR\r\n  (providing that any crime that â€œreflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty,\r\n  trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyerâ€ or that â€œinvolves interference with the\r\n  administration of justiceâ€ constitutes a serious offense).Â  By his conduct,\r\n  Respondent has violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR, Rules 8.4(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) (providing that it is professional\r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to violate or attempt to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the\r\n  lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer, commit a criminal act\r\n  involving moral turpitude, engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,\r\n  deceit or misrepresentation, or engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice).Â  \r\nRespondentâ€™s\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rules 7(a)(1), (4),\r\n  (5), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, (providing that it is grounds for discipline for a\r\n  lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, be convicted of a crime of\r\n  moral turpitude or a serious crime, or engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the legal profession into disrepute or\r\n  conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find that disbarment is an appropriate sanction under these circumstances.Â \r\n  However, we believe that Respondentâ€™s disbarment\r\n  should be made retroactive from the date of his interim suspension.Â \r\n  Considering the fact that Respondent has been on interim suspension for over\r\n  ten years and also considering Respondentâ€™s prior disciplinary history, in our view, imposing a sanction of retroactive disbarment serves\r\n  to adequately protect the public.Â  See In re\r\n    Hoffmeyer, 376 S.C. 221, 339, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 376, 380 (2008) (recognizing that the purpose of disciplinary\r\n  proceedings is to protect the public and the integrity of the legal system).Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, we retroactively disbar Respondent to the date of his\r\n  interim suspension. Within\r\n  fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the\r\n  Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The defendant was charged with burglary after police\r\n  allegedly found him armed and hiding in his ex-girlfriendâ€™s bedroom closet.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26559","title":"Drury Development v.

Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-27-10, et seq. (2002) (â€œthe Actâ€).Â  We answer the first question\r\n  â€œno,â€ and therefore do not reach the second.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nPlaintiff\r\n  Drury Development Corporation (â€œPlaintiffâ€) entered into a risk-sharing\r\n  agreement with Foundation Insurance Company (â€œFoundationâ€).Â  The agreement\r\n  conditioned the partiesâ€™ obligation to pay on whether or not the loss was\r\n  â€œfavorableâ€ to Plaintiff at the end of the agreementâ€™s term.Â  Plaintiff alleges\r\n  that Foundation owed it $86,023.00 under the agreement when the agreementâ€™s\r\n  term ended on April 20, 2005.\r\nSoon\r\n  after conclusion of the agreementâ€™s term, Foundation entered rehabilitation\r\n  without having paid the alleged obligation.Â  Rehabilitation was unsuccessful,\r\n  and Foundation was declared insolvent and liquidated under the supervision of\r\n  the South Carolina Department of Insurance (â€œDOIâ€) in accordance with the terms\r\n  of the Act.Â  During liquidation, the liquidator for the DOI determined that\r\n  Foundationâ€™s assets should be distributed in satisfaction of a single secured\r\n  creditorâ€™s claims.Â  The liquidator did not recognize any other general\r\n  creditors, and Plaintiff did not present its creditor claim to the liquidator.\r\nOn\r\n  April 28, 2006, Plaintiff filed this action in state court.Â  The case was\r\n  timely removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.Â \r\n  Plaintiff asserts claims against Foundation, its corporate parent Tarheel Group\r\n  (â€œTarheelâ€), Tarheel subsidiary Tarheel Insurance Management Company (â€œTIMCOâ€),\r\n  and Tarheel shareholders Steven Mariano and Lucia Tomkins (together\r\n  â€œDefendantsâ€) for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement of contract,\r\n  negligence, conversion, and unjust enrichment.Â  Plaintiff seeks to pierce the\r\n  corporate veil in order to hold Tarheel, TIMCO, Mariano, and Tomkins liable for\r\n  Foundationâ€™s alleged obligation.\r\nDefendants\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12 (b)(6), FRCP, based on the theory\r\n  that Plaintiff may not allege an alter ego claim without first obtaining a\r\n  judgment against Foundation.Â  On November 21, 2007, the Honorable Joseph F.\r\n  Anderson, Jr., United States District Judge for the District of South Carolina,\r\n  determined that Defendantsâ€™ motion to dismiss raised unresolved questions of South Carolina law and certified the following questions to this Court:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1)&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;Is a judgment against the corporation a \r\n\t\t\tprerequisite to an alter ego claim?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2) \r\n\t\t\tIf yes to (1), then is a plaintiff precluded from \r\n\t\t\tbringing an alter ego claim against shareholders and officers of a \r\n\t\t\tcorporation if it fails to either obtain a judgment against the \r\n\t\t\tcorporation prior to its liquidation, or present its claim to the \r\n\t\t\tliquidator as a creditor of the corporation subject to liquidation \r\n\t\t\tpursuant to the Act?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn answering a\r\n  certified question raising a novel question of law, this Court is free to\r\n  decide the question based on its assessment of which answer and reasoning would\r\n  best comport with the law and public policies of the state as well as the\r\n  Courtâ€™s sense of law, justice, and right.Â  Peagler v. USAA Ins. Co., 368\r\n  S.C. 153, 157, 268 S.E.2d 475, 477 (2006).Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe first\r\n  certified question asks whether a judgment against a corporation is a\r\n  prerequisite to an alter ego claim under South Carolina law.[1]Â \r\n  We answer â€œno.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  general, equitable principles govern the veil-piercing remedy, and â€œ[i]t is\r\n  settled authority that the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is not to be\r\n  applied without substantial reflection.â€Â  Sturkie v. Sifly, 280 S.C.\r\n  453, 457, 313 S.E.2d 316, 318 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œIf any general rule can be\r\n  laid down, it is that a corporation will be looked upon as a legal entity until\r\n  sufficient reason to the contrary appears; but when the notion of legal entity\r\n  is used to protect fraud, justify wrong, or defeat public policy, the law will\r\n  regard the corporation as an association of persons.â€Â  Id.Â  The party\r\n  seeking to pierce the corporate veil has the burden of proving that the\r\n  doctrine should be applied.Â  Id.\r\nIn Sturkie,\r\n  the court of appeals adopted a two prong test for piercing the corporate veil.Â \r\n  The first prong analyzes the shareholderâ€™s relationship to the corporation by\r\n  evaluating eight factors.Â  The second prong requires the plaintiff to\r\n  demonstrate that â€œfundamental unfairnessâ€ would result from recognition of the\r\n  corporate entity.Â  â€œThe essence of the fairness test is simply that an\r\n  individual businessman cannot be allowed to hide from the normal consequences\r\n  of carefree entrepreneuring by doing so through a corporate shell.â€Â  Dumas\r\n    v. Infosafe Corp., 320 S.C. 188, 192-193, 463 S.E.2d 641, 644 (Ct. App.\r\n  1995).\r\nDefendants\r\n  contend that a veil-piercing action is dependent upon first obtaining a\r\n  judgment against the corporation.Â  We disagree.Â  In applying South Carolinaâ€™s\r\n  veil-piercing doctrine, as all forms of equitable relief, â€œthe equities of both\r\n  sides are to be considered, and each case must be decided on its own particular\r\n  facts.â€Â  Carroll v. Page, 264 S.C. 345, 349, 215 S.E.2d 203, 205,\r\n  (1975).Â  South Carolina courts have long observed that equity looks beneath\r\n  rigid rules of law to seek substantial justice, and it is well-settled that\r\n  equity will not require the doing of a futile task.Â  See State ex rel. Daniel v. Strong, 185 S.C. 27, 192 S.E. 671, 680 (1937) (â€œEquity\r\n  owes its birth to the desire to look beneath the rigid rules of the law - to\r\n  seek substantial justice.â€); see also Elliot v. Dew, 264 S.C. 40,\r\n  212 S.E.2d 421 (1975) (â€œEquity will not require the doing of a futile taskâ€), Earle v. Webb, 182 S.C. 175, 188 S.E. 798, 802 (1936) (â€œa court of equity\r\n  does not invite litigation.â€).Â  \r\nWere\r\n  we to adopt the rule urged by Defendants, creditors seeking to pierce the\r\n  corporate veil of an insolvent or unresponsive corporate defendant would be\r\n  required to file a pro forma action against the corporation before\r\n  seeking to pierce the corporate veil in a subsequent action. While it is\r\n  undoubtedly true that the corporate veil is often pierced post-judgment, it is\r\n  also true that South Carolina courts frequently consider these issues in one\r\n  bifurcated action.Â  See, e.g., Carolina Marine Handling v. Lasch et al.,\r\n  363 S.C. 169, 176, 609 S.E.2d 548, 553 n.6 (recognizing that â€œan attempt to\r\n  pierce the corporate veil often occurs post-judgment . . . .â€); see also Mid-South Mgmt. Co. Inc. v. Sherwood Dev. Corp., 374 S.C. 588, 649\r\n  S.E.2d 135 (Ct. App. 2007) (in which the trial court allowed claims against a\r\n  corporation and its parent companies to proceed to a bifurcated trial on issues\r\n  of corporate liability and veil-piercing theories); Hunting v. Elders,\r\n  359 S.C. 217, 597 S.E.2d 803 (Ct. App. 2004) (in which the trial court allowed\r\n  claims against a corporation and its shareholder to proceed to a bifurcated\r\n  trial on issues of corporate liability and veil-piercing).Â  In our view, a\r\n  trial court need not dismiss an alleged alter ego defendant from a case on the\r\n  grounds that the issue of corporate liability has not yet been resolved.Â  See Chase Manhattan Bank v. 264 Water St. Assoc., 174 A.D.2d 504, 505 (N.Y.\r\n  App. Div. 1991) (holding that it is not necessary â€œthat an unsatisfied judgment\r\n  first be obtained to pierce the corporate veil.â€). Â We therefore decline to\r\n  adopt a rule which would require South Carolinaâ€™s trial courts to resolve in\r\n  two separate actions what they now ably determine in one.[2]Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nMuch\r\n  of the authority relied upon by Defendants suggests that Defendants have\r\n  erroneously conflated the concept of a claim with that of a judgment.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Hardy v. Brock, 826 So.2d 71, 75-76 (Miss. 2002) (holding that â€œ[a]\r\n  claim against the corporation is a prerequisite for alter ego liability being\r\n  placed on one shareholder.â€); Radaszewski v. Telecom Corp., 981 F.2d 305\r\n  (8th Cir. 1992) (upholding dismissal of shareholder defendant because plaintiff\r\n  failed to state a claim for shareholder liability); 1 William Meade Fletcher et al., Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of\r\n  Private Corporations Â§ 41.10 (per. ed., rev. vol. 2006) (explaining that\r\n  an attempt to pierce the corporate veil is not itself a cause of action but\r\n  rather a means of imposing liability on an underlying cause of action).Â  Indeed,\r\n  South Carolina law is clear that plaintiffs attempting to pierce the\r\n  corporate veil must state a claim against the corporate entity in order to\r\n  proceed on a veil piercing theory.Â  See Sturkie, 280 S.C. at 459, 313\r\n  S.E.2d at 319 (adopting rule requiring plaintiffs to prove knowledge of a\r\n  â€œclaimâ€ in order to prove fundamental unfairness and thereby pierce the corporate\r\n  veil).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that so long as the plaintiff has pled facts sufficient to survive a\r\n  motion to dismiss as to the corporate liability claims and the alter ego claim,\r\n  the trial court should move forward to determination of both matters.Â  In so\r\n  holding, we observe that our disposition as to the first certified question\r\n  should not be construed to undermine the legislatureâ€™s determination that â€œno\r\n  action at law or equity may be brought against the insurer or liquidatorâ€ once\r\n  an order of liquidation has been issued.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-27-430(a).Â \r\n  Rather, we set forth the general rule that a judgment against a corporation is\r\n  not a prerequisite to an alter ego claim.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we answer â€œnoâ€ to the first certified question, and\r\n  therefore do not reach the second certified question.Â  \r\nCERTIFIED\r\n  QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although often used interchangeably, the terms â€œalter\r\n  egoâ€ and â€œpiercing the corporate veilâ€ are\r\n  not one and the same.Â  Whereas â€œalter egoâ€ describes a theory of procedural\r\n  relief, â€œpiercing the corporate veilâ€ refers to the relief itself.Â  See 1 William Meade Fletcher et al.,\r\n  Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations Â§ 41.10 (per.\r\n  ed., rev. vol. 2006).Â  In other words, â€œ[t]he alter ego doctrine is merely a\r\n  means of piercing the corporate veil.â€Â  18 C.J.S. Corporations Â§ 23\r\n  (2008).Â  \r\n[2] Although we adopt a more limited holding, we note\r\n  that at least one other court has gone so far as to hold that a judgment\r\n  against an unresponsive corporate defendant must be set aside in a subsequent\r\n  action to pierce the corporate veil if the shareholder defendant was not a\r\n  party to the determination of corporate liability.Â  In Minton et al. v.\r\n    Cavaney, 364 P.2d 473 (1961), the California Supreme Court held that a\r\n  shareholder defendant had the opportunity to relitigate the legitimacy of the\r\n  underlying corporate obligation.Â  Writing for the majority, Justice Traynor\r\n  wrote that because the defendant was not a party to the action against the\r\n  corporation, the defendant â€œcannot be held liable for debts of [the\r\n  corporation] without an opportunity to relitigate these issues.â€Â  Id. at 476.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26560","title":"Skinner v.

Eddy, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â Â Â Â Â  This\r\n  appeal concerns the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit court in an appeal\r\n  from the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Appellant Westinghouse Electric\r\n  Corporation filed its appeal in the circuit court on August 2, 2006 and served\r\n  its notice of appeal on the commission on October 16, 2006.Â  Because service on\r\n  the commission was not accomplished within thirty days of the filing of the\r\n  appeal, the circuit court determined that it lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  The circuit court dismissed the appeal.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nI.\r\nRespondent\r\n  Thomas Skinner filed this workersâ€™ compensation claim on June 7, 2004, for pulmonary\r\n  problems and related injuries allegedly caused by inhalation of asbestos dust\r\n  and toxic fumes while employed with Westinghouse.Â  A single commissioner\r\n  awarded the claimant a lump sum of $119,159.66 and the full amount of\r\n  causally-related medical bills, past and future.Â  Westinghouse appealed to the\r\n  commission.Â  The commission affirmed the order and award of the single commissioner\r\n  on July 18, 2006.\r\nWestinghouse filed\r\n  a notice of appeal with the circuit court on August 2, 2006.Â  Westinghouse did\r\n  not serve the commission until October 16, 2006, more than thirty days after\r\n  the filing of the appeal in circuit court.Â  The circuit court held the service\r\n  on the commission was untimely and stripped the circuit court of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to hear the appeal.Â  The circuit court dismissed the appeal.\r\nII.\r\nWe\r\n  agree with Westinghouse that the dismissal of its appeal was in error.\r\nWe\r\n  note initially that any perceived error did not impact the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction.Â  â€œSubject matter jurisdiction is â€˜the power to\r\n  hear and determine cases of the general class\r\n  to which the proceedings in question belong.â€™â€Â  Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc.,\r\n  314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (quoting Bank of Babylon v.\r\n    Quirk, 472 A.2d 21, 22 (Conn. 1984)).Â  In Great Games, Inc. v. South\r\n      Carolina Department of Revenue, 339 S.C. 79, 83 n.5, 529 S.E.2d 6, 8 n.5\r\n  (2000), this Court observed that â€œ[t]he failure of a party to comply with the\r\n  procedural requirements for perfecting an appeal may deprive the court of\r\n  â€˜appellateâ€™ jurisdiction over the case, but it does not affect the courtâ€™s\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction.â€Â  See also State v. Brown,\r\n  358 S.C. 382, 387, 596 S.E.2d 39, 41 (2004).Â  As this case deals with the failure\r\n  to serve the notice of appeal on the commission within thirty days and the\r\n  circuit court heard this case in its appellate capacity, the circuit court\r\n  erred in ruling it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court relied substantially on Rule 74, SCRCP, in determining that it\r\n  lacked jurisdiction.Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provide no\r\n  guidance in determining the jurisdiction of the circuit court.Â  Rule 82(a),\r\n  SCRCP, states â€œ[t]hese [civil procedure] rules shall not be construed to extend\r\n  or limit the jurisdiction of any court of this State . . . .â€Â  Therefore, the thirty-day time period referenced in Rule\r\n  74 may not be construed as jurisdictional.[2]Â  See also Rule 75, SCRCP, Notes.Â  Our jurisprudence\r\n  confirms that jurisdictional appealability issues are governed by statute, and not\r\n  by the rules of civil procedure. Â N.C. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan\r\n    Assâ€™n v. Twin States Dev. Corp., 289 S.C. 480, 481, 347 S.E.2d 97, 97 (1986)\r\n  (rejecting an attempt to invoke a rule of civil procedure as a basis of the\r\n  right to appeal and holding, â€œ[t]he right of appeal arises from and is\r\n  controlled by statutory lawâ€).Â  See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§14-3-330 (Supp.\r\n  2007) (primary statute addressing appellate jurisdiction).\r\nWe\r\n  now turn to the applicable statutes to determine if Westinghouseâ€™s service on\r\n  the commission more than thirty days following the filing of the appeal\r\n  divested the circuit court of appellate jurisdiction.\r\nUnder\r\n  the Administrative Procedures Act, section 1-23-380(A)(1) of the South Carolina Code (2005) fails to supply a clear deadline to serve an agency when it\r\n  states:[3]\r\n\r\n\tProceedings\r\n  for review are instituted by filing a petition in the circuit court within\r\n  thirty days after the final decision of the agency or, if a rehearing is\r\n  requested, within thirty days after the final decision thereon.Â  Copies of the\r\n  petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the commission\r\n  must be served with a copy of the appeal petition, but the statute, from a\r\n  jurisdictional standpoint, does not mandate such service within thirty days.[4] Â The reference to serving the agency is not associated with the filing deadline\r\n  with the court.[5]Â  Cf. Canal Ins. Co. v. Caldwell, 338 S.C. 1, 5-6, 524 S.E.2d 416, 418\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999) (holding failure to file the notice of appeal with the court\r\n  within thirty days deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction).\r\nNext, we look to\r\n  section 42-17-60 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2006).Â  Section\r\n  42-17-60 applies to workersâ€™ compensation cases and states, â€œeither\r\n  party to the dispute, within thirty days from the date of the award or\r\n  within thirty days after receipt of notice to be sent by registered mail of the\r\n  award, but not thereafter, may appeal from the decision of the commission to\r\n  the court of common pleas . . . .â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Again, the deadline for\r\n  filing the notice of appeal with the circuit court is provided, but no mention\r\n  of a deadline to serve the agency is given.\r\nFor the benefit of\r\n  the bench and bar, we note that the same result would not be reached under the\r\n  current law.Â  Under the current law, the thirty-day deadline\r\n  applies to service on an agency and proof of such service is required when a\r\n  party files the notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals.Â  The current\r\n  version of section 1-23-380(A)(1), which became effective on July 1, 2006,\r\n  states:\r\n\r\n\tProceedings\r\n  for review are instituted by serving and filing notice of appeal as provided \r\n\tin\r\n    the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules within thirty days after the final\r\n  decision of the agency or, if a rehearing is requested, within thirty days\r\n  after the decision is rendered. Â Copies of the notice of appeal must be served\r\n  upon the agency, the Administrative Law Court, and all parties of record.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nSection\r\n  1-23-380(A)(1) thus references the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\n  Rules.Â  The key jurisdictional provision of the appellate court rules is found\r\n  in Rule 203, SCACR, which became effective on May 3, 2007. Â Rule 203, as it now reads, provides a jurisdictional\r\n  requirement to serve the agency within thirty days.Â  Rule 203(b)(6), SCACR,\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n\tWhen a statute allows\r\n  a decision of the administrative law court or agency (administrative tribunal)\r\n  to be appealed directly to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, the\r\n    notice of appeal shall be served on the agency, the administrative law\r\n  court (if it has been involved in the case) and all parties of record within\r\n    thirty (30) days after receipt of the decision.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Rule 203(d)(2)(B),\r\n  provides in part that â€œ[t]he notice of appeal shall be filed with the clerk of\r\n  the appellate court within the time required to serve the notice of appeal\r\n  under Rule 203(b)(6) . . . accompanied by . . . [p]roof of service showing the\r\n  notice has been served on the agency.â€ Â See also Rule 234(b), SCACR,\r\n  (â€œThe time prescribed by these Rules for performing any act except the time for\r\n  serving the notice of appeal under Rules 203 and 207 may be extended or\r\n  shortened by the appellate court.â€).\r\nIII.\r\nA review of the\r\n  applicable law in 2006 yields the conclusion the thirty-day deadline only\r\n  existed for service on the appellate court and not on the agency.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the circuit court erred in holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  as a result of Westinghouseâ€™s failure to serve the commission within thirty days\r\n  of the filing of the appeal.Â  We reverse and remand to the circuit court for\r\n  consideration of Westinghouseâ€™s appeal.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  Significantly, this appeal is not governed by current law.Â  This case predated\r\n  Act 111, 2007 S.C. Acts 111, which requires appeals from the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Commission to go directly to the Court of Appeals if the injury\r\n  occurred on or after July 1, 2007.Â  The claimant brought this claim on June 7,\r\n  2004.\r\n[2]Â  Rule 74 refers to controlling statutorily imposed time periodsâ€”â€œthe\r\n  notice of intention to appeal shall be filed with the . . . administrative\r\n  agency . . . within the time provided by the statute, or by this rule when no\r\n  time is fixed by the statute.â€Â  The nonjurisdictional default time period\r\n  imposed by Rule 74 is thirty days.\r\n[3]Â  In 2006 the General Assembly passed Act No. 387,\r\n  2006 S.C. Acts 387, which altered the procedure for appealing the decision of\r\n  state agencies; however, the General Assembly addressed Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  law subsequently in Act No. 111, 2007 S.C. Acts 111.Â  Act 111 comprehensively\r\n  reformed Workersâ€™ Compensation law in 2007.Â  By order of this Court, the\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation reform applied to injuries on or after July 1, 2007.Â  Pee\r\n    Dee Regâ€™l Transp. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 375 S.C. 60, 62, 650 S.E.2d\r\n  464, 465 (2007).Â  Therefore, the law of this case predated the appellate\r\n  procedural changes to Workersâ€™ Compensation law.\r\n[4]Â \r\n  At the circuit court hearing, the able circuit judge appeared to concur in the\r\n  lack of a statutory jurisdictional mandate: â€œWell, my first reaction is that\r\n  the statute does not set a time frame for serving the agency, but the rule [74]\r\n  appears to.â€\r\n[5]Â \r\n  We recognize that prejudice may result from a delay in the serving of the\r\n  agency, but no prejudice is alleged here.Â  Respondentâ€™s final brief alludes\r\n  only generally to the potential for prejudice.Â  We, therefore, do not address\r\n  the relationship between a nonjurisdictional procedural defect and resulting\r\n  prejudice.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26561","title":"In the Matter of Janis B.

Â Respondent represents that, prior to the closing, she\r\n  reviewed each and every document in the closing package.Â  \r\nRespondent represents that, at the\r\n  closing, she advised Clients that she was neither representing Clients nor\r\n  Countrywide.Â  Respondent further explained to Clients that she did not examine\r\n  the title to the property, that she did not prepare any of the closing documents,\r\n  that she would not be supervising the disbursement of funds or the recording of\r\n  documents, and that Clients could request the services of an attorney of their\r\n  choice at their own expense to review the documents and/or attend the closing.Â \r\n  After making these oral disclosures to Clients, respondent presented a document\r\n  entitled â€œHold Harmless Agreementâ€ to Clients.Â  Clients executed the document. Â Prior\r\n  to the closing, Clients had no notice that the execution of the Hold Harmless\r\n  Agreement would be a condition to proceeding with the closing and Clients did\r\n  not consult with independent legal counsel.Â  Respondent now recognizes that she\r\n  was the closing attorney for the transaction involving Clients and she owed\r\n  certain duties and responsibilities to Clients, in spite of the Hold Harmless\r\n  Agreement executed by Clients.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nAt the closing, respondent ensured the\r\n  necessary documents were properly executed per Countrywideâ€™s instructions.Â  Afterwards,\r\n  respondent shipped the closing documents by FedEx to NREIS.Â  Respondent\r\n  represents that she was subsequently notified by NREIS that the mortgage had\r\n  been recorded in the appropriate office in Beaufort County, however, respondent\r\n  did not take any affirmative action to verify this assertion by NREIS nor did\r\n  she ensure that the recording of the mortgage had been supervised by a licensed\r\n  South Carolina attorney.Â  Respondent further represents that she was\r\n  subsequently notified by NREIS that the disbursements set forth in the HUD-1A\r\n  Settlement Statement had been made in accordance with the Settlement Statement,\r\n  however she did not take any affirmative action to verify this assertion by\r\n  NREIS nor did she ensure that the disbursement of funds had been supervised by\r\n  a licensed South Carolina attorney.Â  Respondent admits that she received\r\n  payment for her services from NREIS.Â  The HUD-1A Settlement Statement lists\r\n  NREIS as the Settlement Agent and reflects a charge of $400.00 to NREIS for\r\n  settlement or closing fee.Â Â  \r\nThe closing took place in Clientsâ€™ home\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  According to the HUD-1A Settlement Statement, however, the\r\n  place of settlement was Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Â  \r\nThere is no evidence that anyone in\r\n  Clientsâ€™ closing suffered any harm as a result of respondentâ€™s conduct.Â \r\n  However, respondent acknowledges she may not have provided Clients with\r\n  competent representation.Â  She agrees her actions constitute misconduct under\r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.Â Â  Respondent represents\r\n  that, in the future, she will make every effort not to handle matters without\r\n  first making herself familiar with the applicable guidelines and law.\r\nRespondent has been forthright and\r\n  cooperative throughout this investigation.Â  Respondent has no prior\r\n  disciplinary history.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that,\r\n  by her misconduct, she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.8(h) (lawyer shall not make an\r\n  agreement prospectively limiting the lawyerâ€™s liability to a client for\r\n  malpractice unless the client is independently represented in making the\r\n  agreement); Rule 5.5(a) (lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in\r\n  violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction or\r\n  assist another in doing so); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for\r\n  lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent acknowledges that\r\n  her misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for her misconduct.Â  Within\r\n  thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall pay costs of\r\n  $535.98 to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.Â Â  Â \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26562","title":"In the Matter of Donald Neils Sorenson","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26562","description":"This is a lawyer disciplinary opinion in which the Court imposed a public reprimand.","date":"2008-11-10","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of Donald Neils\r\n      Sorenson, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26562\r\nSubmitted October 9, 2008 - Filed November 10, 2008Â  \r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and C.

Evans, Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPetitioner was placed on interim\r\n  suspension in 1996, after he pled guilty to one count of felony driving under\r\n  the influence (DUI) causing death.Â  In re Evans, 323 S.C. 469, 476\r\n  S.E.2d 915 (1996).Â  Later that year, petitioner was disbarred.Â  In re Evans,\r\n  325 S.C. 23, 478 S.E.2d 686 (1996).Â  The disbarment was based on petitionerâ€™s\r\n  conviction as well as use of drugs and making a false statement to an insurer\r\n  regarding the fatal accident.\r\nOn September 10, 2007,\r\n  petitioner filed a Petition for Readmission to the Practice of Law.Â  The Office\r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed a return in opposition to the petition in\r\n  which it maintained the petition should be denied based solely on the\r\n  seriousness of the prior misconduct.Â  \r\nA hearing was held before\r\n  the Committee on Character and Fitness on January 18, 2008.Â  On June 20, 2008,\r\n  the Committee issued a Report and Recommendation recommending the petition be\r\n  denied because petitioner failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  he meets the requirements of Rule 33(f), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, for\r\n  reinstatement.\r\nSpecifically, the\r\n  Committee found the petition should be denied on the basis of the seriousness\r\n  of the prior misconduct.Â  The Committee noted this is the first time the Court\r\n  has been asked to consider reinstating a disbarred attorney in a matter where\r\n  the underlying misconduct that led to disbarment included the death of a third\r\n  party as a result of an accident caused by drunken driving.[1]Â  The Committee acknowledged there is\r\n  precedent in the State of Ohio for reinstatement of an attorney who caused a\r\n  fatal automobile accident and pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter, driving\r\n  while intoxicated, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, and operating a motor\r\n  vehicle without reasonable control, see Office of Disciplinary\r\n    Counsel v. Michaels, 553 N.E.2d 597 (Ohio 1990), but found that case\r\n  unpersuasive because the totality of misconduct therein was not as egregious as\r\n  the misconduct in the case at hand.[2]\r\nODC did not object to the\r\n  report.Â  However, petitioner filed objections to the report.Â  A hearing was\r\n  held before this Court on October 8, 2008.\r\nThe following was\r\n  established at the hearings before the Committee and this Court.Â  Petitioner served approximately 7 Â½\r\n  years in prison, during which he completed a drug and alcohol program.Â  At the\r\n  time of the hearing before the Committee, petitioner had been out of prison for\r\n  four years.Â  Petitioner has completed his probation and paid the fine that was\r\n  imposed.Â  He passed the bar examination and has completed Bridge the Gap.Â \r\n  Since being released from prison, he has been working in his sisterâ€™s\r\n  restaurant in Charleston and doing construction work.Â  Petitioner states that\r\n  if he is readmitted he will practice primarily civil law.Â  Grady Query,\r\n  Esquire, has agreed to allow petitioner to share space within his office.\r\nWith regard to\r\n  rehabilitation, petitioner has been extremely active in Alcoholics Anonymous\r\n  (AA), with regular attendance at, participation in, and leading of AA meetings\r\n  at the Charleston Center, a public alcohol and drug treatment center.Â  He is\r\n  also participating in a monitoring program with the South Carolina Barâ€™s Lawyers\r\n  Helping Lawyers, and has fully complied with its reporting requirements.Â  \r\nPetitioner is monitored\r\n  by his AA sponsor, as well as Robert Turnbull of Lawyers Helping Lawyers.[3]Â  Both men fully support petitionerâ€™s\r\n  reinstatement.Â  Petitionerâ€™s AA sponsor states petitioner is doing the things\r\n  he needs to stay sober and he is optimistic petitioner will be able to abstain\r\n  from the use of drugs and alcohol in the future.Â  Mr. Turnbull states he feels\r\n  confident, given the\r\n  safeguards that can be put into place through Lawyers Helping Lawyers, that if\r\n  petitioner is readmitted, he will be a better lawyer than he was before his\r\n  suspension and disbarment.\r\nPetitioner himself maintains he is\r\n  committed to a life without drugs and alcohol.Â  He asserts he has the ability to be\r\n  a good and productive citizen and to be a good lawyer, this time freed of his\r\n  dependence on drugs and alcohol.Â  He states his recovery has allowed him to institute many new,\r\n  healthy habits, which have led to a more â€œhealthy, productive, positive, spiritual\r\n  lifestyle.â€Â  Petitioner asserts he is a different person from the person he was\r\n  prior to the commission of the misconduct and that he is a much better person\r\n  today.Â  He assured this Court that there is no possibility of his prior misconduct\r\n  occurring again.\r\nFinally, and most importantly,\r\n  petitioner acknowledged the seriousness of his misconduct and the fact that drug\r\n  and alcohol addiction was an underlying component.Â  He further acknowledged his\r\n  misconduct resulted in an innocent victim losing her life.Â  He expressed deep regret\r\n  and sorrow for the victimâ€™s loss of her life, and at the hearing before the\r\n  Committee he stated the accident and the consequences of it to the victim and\r\n  her family are with him every day.Â  Petitioner stated there are no words to\r\n  describe the remorse he feels, and although he wishes he could change what\r\n  occurred, he understands there is nothing he can do except learn from the past\r\n  and try to be a better person.Â  We note in this regard that the victimâ€™s\r\n  mother, who petitioner corresponded with while in prison, informed the local\r\n  media \r\n\r\nthat she does not oppose petitionerâ€™s reinstatement and has\r\n  expressed to petitioner her desire that he return to the practice of law.\r\nA lawyer who has been disbarred shall\r\n  be reinstated to the practice of law only upon order of the Court.Â  Rule 33(a),\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  A petition for reinstatement shall not be filed earlier\r\n  than five years from the date of entry of the order of disbarment.Â  Id.\r\nA lawyer may be reinstated or\r\n  readmitted only if the lawyer meets each of the following criteria:\r\n\r\n\t(1) The lawyer has fully complied with the terms and\r\n  conditions of all prior disciplinary orders.\r\n\t(2) The lawyer has not engaged nor attempted to engage in the unauthorized practice\r\n  of law during the period of suspension or disbarment.\r\n\t(3) If the lawyer was suffering under a physical or mental infirmity at the time of\r\n  suspension or disbarment, including alcohol or other drug abuse, the infirmity\r\n  has been removed. Where alcohol or other drug abuse was a causative factor in\r\n  the lawyerâ€™s misconduct, the lawyer shall not be reinstated unless:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(A) the lawyer has pursued appropriate rehabilitative treatment;\r\n\t\t(B) the lawyer has abstained from the use of alcohol or other drugs for at least 1\r\n  year or the period of suspension, whichever is shorter; and\r\n\t\t(C) the lawyer is likely to continue to abstain from alcohol or other drugs.\r\n\t\r\n\t(4) The lawyer recognizes the wrongfulness and seriousness of the misconduct for\r\n  which the lawyer was suspended or disbarred.\r\n\t(5) The lawyer has not engaged in any other professional misconduct since\r\n  suspension or disbarment.\r\n\t(6) Notwithstanding the conduct for which the lawyer was disciplined, the\r\n  lawyer has the requisite honesty and integrity to practice law.\r\n\t(7) The lawyer has kept informed about recent developments in the law and\r\n  is competent to practice.\r\n\t(8) If disbarred or indefinitely suspended, the lawyer has successfully completed\r\n  the examinations and training required by Rule 402(c)(5), (6) and (8), SCACR. Â The\r\n  lawyer may take the examinations and begin this training no earlier than 9\r\n  months prior to the earliest date on which the lawyer may apply for\r\n  reinstatement. Â The lawyer shall attach proof of completion of these\r\n  examinations and training to the petition for reinstatement.\r\n\t(9) If suspended for a definite period of 9 months or more, the lawyer has, during\r\n  the period of suspension, completed and reported continuing legal education and\r\n  legal ethics/professional responsibility credits equal to those required of\r\n  active members of the South Carolina Bar and is currently in good standing with\r\n  the Commission on Continuing Legal Education and Specialization. Â The lawyer\r\n  shall attach to the petition for reinstatement a statement from the Commission\r\n  on Continuing Legal Education and Specialization confirming compliance with\r\n  this requirement.(10) If suspended or disbarred for conduct resulting in a criminal conviction\r\n  and sentence, the lawyer has successfully completed all conditions of the\r\n  sentence, including, but not limited to, any period of probation or parole.\r\n\t(11) The lawyer has paid necessary expenses and compensation approved by the Supreme\r\n  Court to the attorney appointed pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, to protect the\r\n  interests of the lawyer's clients for necessary expenses, or to the Lawyersâ€™ Fund\r\n  for Client Protection if the Fund has paid the appointed attorney under Rule\r\n  31(f), RLDE.\r\n\r\nRule 33(f), RLDE.Â  The lawyer has the burden of demonstrating\r\n  by clear and convincing evidence that the lawyer has met each of the criteria\r\n  in Rule 33(f).Â  Rule 33(g), RLDE.Â  The decision to grant or deny reinstatement\r\n  rests in the discretion of the Court.Â  Rule 33(h), RLDE.Â  In making this\r\n  determination, the seriousness of the prior misconduct is considered and the\r\n  petition for reinstatement may be denied based solely on the seriousness of the\r\n  prior misconduct.Â  Id.\r\nWe find petitioner has clearly complied\r\n  with Rule 33(f)(1), (2), (5), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11).Â  With regard to\r\n  Rule 33(f)(3), we find, based on the testimony presented before the Committee\r\n  and this Court that petitioner has pursued appropriate rehabilitative treatment\r\n  and has abstained from the use of alcohol or other drugs for at least one year,\r\n  and that he is likely to continue to abstain from alcohol or other drugs.Â  We\r\n  also find petitioner recognizes the wrongfulness and seriousness of the\r\n  misconduct and has the requisite honesty and integrity to practice law.Â  Rule\r\n  33(f)(4) and (6), RLDE.Â  \r\nHaving found petitioner meets the\r\n  criteria set forth in Rule 33(f), we must consider the seriousness of the\r\n  misconduct.Â  See Rule 33(h), RLDE.Â  The seriousness of the misconduct\r\n  committed by petitioner cannot be overstated.Â  An innocent victim lost her life\r\n  as a result of petitionerâ€™s behavior.Â  Indeed, we have never been asked to\r\n  reinstate someone to the practice of law in this State whose misconduct rose to\r\n  the level of that committed by petitioner, or more specifically, resulted in\r\n  someoneâ€™s death.Â  Petitionerâ€™s actions following the incident which resulted in\r\n  the victimâ€™s death also cause us, as they did the Committee, great concern.\r\nWhile we appreciate the Committeeâ€™s\r\n  reluctance to recommend petitionerâ€™s reinstatement in light of the seriousness\r\n  of his misconduct, especially given the lack of precedent for such action, we\r\n  find, after consideration of the totality of the circumstances in this case,\r\n  most importantly petitionerâ€™s actions in turning his life around since his\r\n  incarceration, that the seriousness of petitionerâ€™s misconduct should not\r\n  preclude his reinstatement.Â  Petitioner has taken considerable steps toward\r\n  addressing the underlying addictions that led to his misconduct and to\r\n  bettering himself as a lawyer and a person.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAccordingly, we hereby\r\n  reinstate petitioner to the practice of law in this state subject to the\r\n  following conditions, which must be met for the next two years:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;Petitioner shall continue with the \r\n\t\t\ttwelve-step program administered by AA or Narcotics Anonymous (NA), \r\n\t\t\tincluding attending five AA or NA meetings per week, for a minimum \r\n\t\t\tperiod of two years.&nbsp; Petitioner shall at all times during the \r\n\t\t\ttwo year period have a sponsor to guide him through the program.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tPetitionerâ€™s sponsor shall, for a period of two years, file \r\n\t\t\tquarterly reports with ODC setting forth petitionerâ€™s\r\n  progress in the twelve-step program and verifying petitionerâ€™s attendance at\r\n  the required meetings.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tPetitioner shall enter into a two year monitoring \r\n\t\t\tcontract with Lawyers Helping Lawyers, a copy of which shall be \r\n\t\t\tsubmitted to ODC.[4]Â \r\n  The terms of the contract shall be determined by J. Robert Turnbull, Jr., Director\r\n  of Lawyers Helping Lawyers, but shall include a requirement that petitioner\r\n  abstain from the use of alcohol and illegal drugs, that he submit to periodic\r\n  and unannounced drug and alcohol testing at intervals to be determined by Mr.\r\n  Turnbull, and that he have weekly contact and monthly face-to-face contact with\r\n  his monitor.The\r\n  monitor shall file quarterly reports concerning petitionerâ€™s progress with Lawyers\r\n  Helping Lawyers and ODC.Â  If petitioner violates the terms of the contract in\r\n  any material way, Lawyers Helping Lawyers shall notify ODC.Â  At the conclusion\r\n  of the contract period, Lawyers Helping Lawyers shall file a report with ODC\r\n  verifying that petitioner has successfully completed the terms of the contract.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tLawyers Helping Lawyers and ODC shall\r\n  notify the Court if petitionerâ€™s sponsor or monitor fails to submit the\r\n  required quarterly reports or if the reports indicate a lack of satisfactory\r\n  progress by petitioner.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.

(SCI) and SCE&amp;G are affiliated corporations.Â  SCI is\r\n  in the business of constructing communications towers (cell-phone towers) to\r\n  lease to wireless telecommunications companies.Â  SCE&amp;G leased a portion of\r\n  its Edisto Island tract to SCI for the purpose of constructing a cell-phone\r\n  tower.Â  Because the then existing zoning did not permit cell-phone towers, SCE&amp;G\r\n  sought rezoning to a classification that would permit a cell-phone tower.Â  The\r\n  property was rezoned pursuant to proper procedures.Â  ATC South, Inc. (ATC) challenged the rezoning by\r\n  filing a declaratory judgment action in circuit court.Â  ATC and SCI are\r\n  competitors in the cell-phone tower business.Â  ATC owns a tract of land (with a\r\n  cell-phone tower) approximately one mile from SCE&amp;Gâ€™s property.Â  Pursuant\r\n  to cross-summary judgment motions, the circuit court dismissed the case,\r\n  finding that ATCâ€™s status as a mere competitor did not confer standing to\r\n  challenge the rezoning by the Charleston County Council.Â  We agree and affirm.[1]\r\nI.\r\nSCI and SCE&amp;G (hereinafter\r\n  collectively â€œSCE&amp;Gâ€) submitted an application to Charleston County Council\r\n  to rezone property it owned from Agricultural-Residential (AGR) to Planned\r\n  Development for utilities (PD) in order to expand the existing electrical\r\n  substation and to build a cell-phone tower.Â  The AGR zoning did not allow cell-phone\r\n  towers, but the requested PD zoning would permit cell-phone towers.\r\nThe\r\n  County Planning Commission ultimately recommended approval of the rezoning\r\n  application to the County Council.Â  Following public hearings and the\r\n  appropriate number of â€œreadings,â€ County Council unanimously approved the\r\n  rezoning request.\r\nATC\r\n  appeals from its unsuccessful challenge in circuit court, contending the\r\n  rezoning of SCE&amp;Gâ€™s property was improper.Â  We are obligated before\r\n  reaching the merits of the rezoning question to determine whether ATC has\r\n  standing to press its complaint.Â  We conclude ATC does not have standing and\r\n  that ends our inquiry.\r\nII.\r\nStanding\r\n  may be acquired: (1) by statute; (2) through the rubric of â€œconstitutional\r\n  standing;â€ or (3) under the â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Statutory Standing\r\nSection\r\n  6-29-760(C) (2004) of the South Carolina Code provides â€œ[a]n owner of adjoining land or his representative has standing to\r\n  bring an action contesting the ordinance or amendment; however, this subsection\r\n  does not create any new substantive right in any party.â€Â  Because\r\n  ATC is a nonadjoining landowner, it may not assert statutory standing.Â  ATC so\r\n  concedes. Â Cf. St. Andrews Public Serv. Dist. v. City Council of Charleston,\r\n  349 S.C. 602, 605, 564 S.E.2d 647, 648 (2002) (overruling precedent and holding\r\n  that a non-statutory party lacks standing to challenge a â€œvoidâ€ annexation of\r\nproperty).\r\n\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitutional Standing\r\nThe\r\n  principle of standing under the United States Constitution is â€œan essential and\r\n  unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.â€Â  Lujan\r\n    v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).Â  The Supreme Court has\r\n  provided a three-part test to establish standing:\r\n\r\n\tFirst,\r\n  the plaintiff must have suffered an â€œinjury in factâ€-an invasion of a legally\r\n  protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) â€œactual or imminent, not â€˜conjecturalâ€™ or\r\n  â€˜hypothetical,â€™ â€ Â Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury\r\n  and the conduct complained of-the injury has to be â€œfairly . . . trace[able] to\r\n  the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the\r\n  independent action of some third party not before the court.â€Â Third, it must be\r\n  â€œlikely,â€ as opposed to merely â€œspeculative,â€ that the injury will be\r\n  â€œredressed by a favorable decision.â€\r\n\r\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61 (internal citations omitted).Â  See\r\n  also DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 342 (2006).\r\nWe\r\n  need go no further than the initial requirement of a concrete and\r\n  particularized injury.Â  â€œ[A] private person may not invoke the judicial power\r\n  to determine the validity of executive or legislative action unless he has\r\n  sustained, or is in immediate danger of sustaining, prejudice therefrom.â€Â  Evins\r\n    v.

Coleman, 285 S.C. 472,\r\n    330 S.E.2d 298 (1985)).Â  ATCâ€™s only concrete and particularized\r\n  injury is that of a competitor of SCE&amp;G in the cell-phone tower business.Â \r\n  The thrust of ATCâ€™s argument in the circuit court centered on its status as a\r\n  cell-phone tower competitor with SCE&amp;G.Â  As ATCâ€™s answers to\r\n  interrogatories reflect:\r\n\r\n\tThe harm\r\n  to [ATC], already inherent, is magnified by the fact that it is [a]\r\n    competitor of Defendants [SCE&amp;G] in the field of supply of\r\n  communications tower facilities.Â  Any favored treatment by a regulatory/zoning\r\n  authority to one competitor, in this case Defendants [SCE&amp;G], harms other\r\n  competitors by lessening the favored competitorâ€™s costs of doing business.Â  In\r\n  other words, one competitor is freed from regulatory restraints, and this\r\n  action inevitably harms other competitors.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThis\r\n  Court rejected a competitorâ€™s assertion that standing exists when alleged\r\n  damages flow from increased or perceived unfair competition.Â  Connor\r\n    Holdings, LLC v.

Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488 (1923).Â  We reject ATCâ€™s claim of taxpayer standing under constitutional\r\n  standing principles.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; The â€œPublic Importanceâ€\r\n  Exception\r\nThis\r\n  Court has long recognized the â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception to the general\r\n  standing requirements.Â  â€œ[S]tanding is not inflexible and standing may be\r\n  conferred upon a party when an issue is of such public importance as to require\r\n  its resolution for future guidance.â€Â  Davis v. Richland County\r\n    Council, 372 S.C. 497, 500, 642 S.E.2d 740, 741 (2007) (citation omitted); see\r\n      also Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 531, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75\r\n  (1999) (holding standing existed to challenge an alleged ultra vires act\r\n  of issuing tax-exempt hospital bonds because the act affected profound public\r\n  interests: public health and public welfare).Â  In cases which fall within the\r\n  ambit of important public interest, standing will be conferred â€œwithout\r\n  requiring the plaintiff to show he has an interest greater than other potential\r\n  plaintiffs.â€ Â Davis, 372 S.C. at 500, 642 S.E.2d at 741 (citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nWhether\r\n  an issue of public importance exists necessitates a cautious balancing of the competing\r\n  interests presented, as this Court explained:\r\n\r\n\tAn\r\n  appropriate balance between the competing policy concerns underlying the issue\r\n  of standing must be realized. Â Citizens must be afforded access to the judicial\r\n  process to address alleged injustices. Â On the other hand, standing cannot be\r\n  granted to every individual who has a grievance against a public official. Â Otherwise,\r\n  public officials would be subject to numerous lawsuits at the expense of both\r\n  judicial economy and the freedom from frivolous lawsuits.\r\n\r\nSloan v. Sanford, 357 S.C. 431, 434, 593 S.E.2d 470, 472 (2004).\r\nThe\r\n  key to the public importance analysis is whether a resolution is needed for\r\n  future guidance. Â It is this concept of â€œfuture guidanceâ€ that gives meaning to\r\n  an issue which transcends a purely private matter and rises to the level of\r\n  public importance. Â Baird, 333 S.C. at 531, 511 S.E.2d at 75 (â€œ[A] court\r\n  may confer standing upon a party when an issue is of such public importance as\r\n  to require its resolution for future guidance.â€) (citations omitted); Sloan\r\n    v. Sanford, 357 S.C. at 434, 593 S.E.2d at 472 (â€œ[U]nder certain\r\n  circumstances, standing may be conferred upon a party when an issue is of such\r\n  public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.â€) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Yet the very nature of the public importance exception to general\r\n  standing requirements resists a formulaic approach, as each case must turn on\r\n  â€œthe competing policy concernsâ€ as we expressed in Sloan v. Sanford.[2]\r\nTurning\r\n  to the case at hand, ATC claims that the matter of zoning is important to the\r\n  public.Â  Of course zoning is a matter of public importance, but the same may be\r\n  said of most legislative and executive actions.Â  For a court to relax general\r\n  standing rules, the matter of importance must, in the context of the case, be\r\n  inextricably connected to the public need for court resolution for future\r\n  guidance.Â  There is nothing public about ATCâ€™s concern with a competing\r\n  cell-phone tower.Â  Here, a local government followed proper procedure and\r\n  rezoned a single piece of property for a narrow purpose and the only complaint\r\n  comes from a nonadjoining landowner which just happens to be a competitor.Â \r\n  ATCâ€™s efforts to cloak its zoning challenge as a matter of â€œpublic importanceâ€\r\n  for the purpose of acquiring standing finds no traction in this record.\r\nIII.\r\nATC presents to the\r\n  Court as a disgruntled competitor, nothing more.Â  Because ATCâ€™s challenge to\r\n  the rezoning of SCE&amp;Gâ€™s property by the Charleston County Council does not\r\n  implicate a matter of public importance requiring court resolution for future\r\n  guidance, ATCâ€™s complaint is dismissed for lack of standing.Â  The judgment of\r\n  the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â This appeal is before us pursuant to Rule 204 (b) certification.\r\n[2]Â  For examples where this Court has conferred standing\r\n  under the public importance exception, see Sloan v.

Carter, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent\r\n  Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Karen\r\n  C. Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In\r\n  this case, we granted certiorari to review the post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\n  courtâ€™s denial of Petitioner Marcus D. Robinsonâ€™s request for relief.Â \r\n  Petitioner argues that the PCR court erred in ruling that he was not prejudiced\r\n  by plea counselâ€™s failure to challenge the use of a prior uncounseled\r\n  magistrate courtâ€™s conviction to enhance the sentence on his present\r\n  conviction.Â  We find that the prior uncounseled conviction was improperly used\r\n  to enhance Petitionerâ€™s sentence and remand the case for resentencing.\r\nFacts\r\nOn September 16,\r\n  2003, Petitioner was indicted on one count of trafficking crack cocaine.Â  At\r\n  the plea hearing, the State and the plea judge noted that Petitioner had a prior\r\n  conviction for possession of marijuana from 2000.Â  The plea judge informed\r\n  Petitioner that, consistent with a second offense, the minimum sentence he could\r\n  receive would be seven years and the maximum would be thirty years.Â  Plea counsel\r\n  did not object to the trafficking offense being treated as a second offense and\r\n  Petitioner was sentenced to twenty years. \r\nPetitioner filed an\r\n  application for PCR, alleging that his guilty plea was involuntary and\r\n  unknowing and that plea counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge the use\r\n  of the prior conviction as a sentence enhancer.Â  Specifically, Petitioner\r\n  testified that he pled guilty without an attorney in magistrate court to\r\n  marijuana possession in 2000 and was sentenced to public service.Â  Petitioner\r\n  was subsequently arrested and served jail time after failing to complete the\r\n  public service.Â  Petitioner testified that he believed he was pleading guilty\r\n  to trafficking, first offense, rather than trafficking, second offense.Â \r\n  However, Petitioner testified that he wanted to plead guilty. \r\nThe\r\n  PCR court denied relief and found that, although plea counsel should have\r\n  challenged the use of the 2000 uncounseled conviction, the use of that\r\n  conviction did not prejudice Petitioner because he was sentenced to twenty\r\n  years, less than the maximum sentence for a first offense.Â  \r\n\r\n\tPetitioner appealed\r\n  and raises the following issue for review:\r\n\tDid the\r\n  PCR court err in ruling that Petitioner was not prejudiced by plea counselâ€™s\r\n  error in failing to challenge the use of his prior uncounseled magistrate\r\n  courtâ€™s conviction to enhance sentencing on the present conviction?\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nThe\r\n  burden of proof is on the applicant in post-conviction proceedings to prove the\r\n  allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 442,\r\n  334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  The PCR\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling should be upheld if it is supported by any evidence of probative\r\n  value in the record.Â  Cherry\r\n    v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119,\r\n  386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues the PCR court erred in denying relief on the grounds that Petitioner\r\n  failed to show prejudice because he was sentenced within the range of available\r\n  sentences for a first offense of trafficking.Â  We agree. \r\nA\r\n  defendantâ€™s prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction may only be used to\r\n  enhance his sentence for a subsequent conviction if the defendant was not\r\n  actually imprisoned as a result of the prior conviction.Â  Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 749 (1994); Glaze v. State, 366 S.C. 271, 274-5, 621 S.E.2d\r\n  655, 657 (2005).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold that plea counsel was deficient in failing to challenge the prior\r\n  conviction.Â  Petitioner did not have counsel at the magistrate hearing and\r\n  although he was originally sentenced to public service only, he subsequently\r\n  served time in jail as a result of the conviction.Â  Therefore, this prior\r\n  conviction could not be used for enhancement purposes.Â  Moreover, the PCR court\r\n  erred in its prejudice analysis by finding that Petitioner suffered no\r\n  prejudice because his sentence was less than the maximum for a first offense of trafficking. Â See Thompson v.\r\n  State, 340 S.C. 112, 116, 531 S.E.2d 294, 297 (2000) (holding that whether\r\n  a defendant is sentenced within the sentencing range is irrelevant in showing\r\n  the absence of prejudice).\r\nAlthough the plea judge erroneously used Petitionerâ€™s prior conviction\r\n  as an enhancer, in our view, the proper relief in this case is for Petitioner\r\n  to be resentenced.Â  Petitioner failed to show that his plea was involuntary.Â \r\n  At the PCR hearing, Petitioner specifically testified that he had always wanted\r\n  to plead guilty and that he did not want to go to trial.Â  See Thompson, 340 S.C. at 116, 531\r\n  S.E.2d at 297 Â (recognizing\r\n  that a defendant may only attack the voluntary nature of a plea by showing that\r\n  but for plea counselâ€™s error, he would not have pled guilty but would have\r\n  insisted on going to trial).Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the United States Supreme Court and this Court have remanded for resentencing\r\n  in cases similar to the instant case.Â  For example, in United States v.\r\n    Tucker, 404 U.S. 443 (1972), the United States Supreme Court concluded that\r\n  a defendant should be resentenced where the trial judge considered the\r\n  defendantâ€™s prior unconstitutional convictions in determining the sentence.Â \r\n  Because the sentence was not determined based on the â€œinformed discretion of a\r\n  trial judge, but . . . upon misinformation of constitutional magnitude,â€ the court\r\n  remanded the case for resentencing.Â  Id. at 447.Â  This Court addressed a\r\n  similar issue in State v. Rich, 269 S.C. 701, 239 S.E.2d 731 (1977),\r\n  where there was evidence that the trial judge had considered the defendantâ€™s\r\n  prior convictions in sentencing, although the rap sheet he examined did not\r\n  contain the dispositions of each charge.Â  Id. at 702, 239 S.E.2d at\r\n  732.Â  The Court remanded the case for resentencing to avoid the possibility of\r\n  a sentence enhanced on the basis of unconstitutional prior convictions.Â  Id. at 705, 239 S.E.2d at 733.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we find that the use of Petitionerâ€™s prior uncounseled conviction in enhancing\r\n  his sentence was unconstitutional and therefore we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  order denying relief and instruct the PCR court to remand the case for\r\n  resentencing. Â See Roscoe v. State, 345 S.C. 16, 22, 546 S.E.2d 417, 420\r\n  (2001) (affirming the PCR courtâ€™s order of remand for resentencing where the\r\n  defendant was sentenced in excess of the maximum penalty).\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the PCR court erred in\r\n  denying relief.\r\nREVERSED. \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26565","title":"Bennett v.

WRP Enterprises, Inc., 368 S.C. 549, 630\r\n  S.E.2d 44 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Petitioner Philadelphia Insurance\r\n  Company argues the Court of Appeals erroneously held that Philadelphia Insurance\r\n  Company was responsible for a supplemental policy referenced in a contract\r\n  between Bierdie Williams and WRP Enterprises, and Thrifty Car Rental.Â  We agree\r\n  and reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nCindy\r\n  Garnett was injured in a wreck involving Bierdie Williams, who was driving a\r\n  car Williams rented in Georgia from WRP Enterprises and Thrifty Car Rental\r\n  (hereinafter collectively â€œThriftyâ€).Â  When renting the car Williams purchased an additional million dollar insurance policy, which Thrifty admitted it was\r\n  not authorized to sell.Â  Garnett brought a declaratory judgment action against\r\n  Thrifty and Philadelphia Insurance Company to determine what coverage the\r\n  renter, Williams, had at the time of the accident.\r\nThrifty\r\n  had contracted with Philadelphia for insurance on the vehicles it rented.Â  This\r\n  contract contained two levels of liability: (1) the minimum coverage that provided\r\n  $15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident; and (2) a higher rate of coverage that\r\n  provided $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident.Â  The circuit court\r\n  granted Thriftyâ€™s motion for summary judgment and held that Philadelphia was\r\n  contractually obligated to provide the $100,000/$300,000 coverage.Â  The Court\r\n  of Appeals affirmed.Â  Philadelphia petitioned for certiorari, which this Court\r\n  granted.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPreliminarily we note that this dispute does not\r\n  concern whether Williams is entitled to the higher coverage, for Thrifty conceded\r\n  up to $1,000,000 worth of coverage is available to Williams, and hence\r\n  Garnett.Â  The dispute before us is limited to determining whether Thrifty may\r\n  invoke its policy with Philadelphia to make Philadelphia the responsible insurer\r\n  for $100,000 to $300,000 of the $1,000,000 policy. Â We also note that the\r\n  unchallenged findings in the underlying proceedings render Georgia law as controlling. Â See Dreher v. Dreher, 370 S.C. 75, 78 n.1, 634\r\n  S.E.2d 646, 647 n.1 (2006) (holding an unchallenged ruling becomes law of the\r\n  case).Â  Therefore, the application of Georgia law is the law of the case.\r\nWe must examine the\r\n  contracts between Williams and Thrifty and Philadelphia and Thrifty to\r\n  determine if Philadelphiaâ€™s higher rate of coverage was triggered. Â For the\r\n  reasons set forth below, we conclude that the unambiguous terms of the\r\n  respective policies precludes application of the Philadelphia policy.\r\nâ€œAs\r\n  is true with all contracts, unambiguous terms in an insurance policy require no\r\n  construction, and their\r\n  plain meaning will be given full effect, regardless of whether they might be of\r\n  benefit to the insurer, or be of detriment to an insured.â€Â  Payne v. Twiggs County Sc h. Dist., 496 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. 1998).Â  â€œWhile an ambiguous\r\n  insurance contract will be liberally construed in favor of the insured, one\r\n  which when construed reasonably and in its entirety, unambiguously and lawfully\r\n  limits the insurerâ€™s liability, cannot be expanded beyond what is fairly within\r\n  its plain terms.â€ Â Hawkins Iron &amp; Metal Co., Inc. v. Continental Ins.\r\n    Co., 196 S.E.2d 903, 904 (Ga. Ct. App. 1973); see also Ga. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 13-2-2 (Supp. 2007) (outlining Georgiaâ€™s contract interpretation rules).\r\nThe\r\n  contract between Thrifty and Philadelphia (hereinafter Philadelphia contract) delineated\r\n  two separate coverage rates in the policyâ€™s schedule of coverages located in\r\n  the Dual Interest Endorsement:\r\n\r\n\tWhen the\r\n  Insuredâ€™s rental contract provides the renter with minimum state\r\n    financial responsibility limits, the following limits of liability are\r\n  applicable to this policy:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tBodily Injury Liability\r\n\t\t\t\t$15,000.00 each person\r\n\t\t\t\t$30,000.00 each accident\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tProperty Damage Liability\r\n\t\t\t\t$10,000.00 each accident\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhen the rental contract provided the renter with limits in excess of the minimum\r\n  state financial responsibility laws, the following limits of liability are\r\n  applicable to this policy:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tBodily Injury Liability\r\n\t\t\t\t$100,000.00 each person\r\n\t\t\t\t$300,000.00 each accident\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tProperty Damage Liability\r\n\t\t\t\t$50,000.00 each accident\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).[1]Â \r\n  Accordingly, coverage pursuant to the Philadelphia contract exists only when\r\n  the rental contract provided the coverage.Â  We must turn to the contract\r\n  between Thrifty and Williams (hereinafter the rental contract) to determine if\r\n  â€œthe rental contract provided the renter with limits in excess of the minimum\r\n  state financial responsibility laws.â€\r\nThe rental\r\n  contract allowed the renter to purchase an optional, additional insurance\r\n  policy.Â  Section 10(A)2 of the rental contract provided the option to purchase a\r\n  separate, supplemental liability insurance policy:\r\n\r\n\tSLI\r\n  [supplemental liability insurance] provides Me with a separate policy providing excess coverage against such claims for the difference between the\r\n  Primary Protection and a maximum combined single limit of $1,000,000 (U.S.) per occurrence for bodily injury, including death and property damage, for other than\r\n  the Car while the Car is on rent to Me.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Williams purchased this additional policy; thereby, Williams paid an additional premium to\r\n  Thrifty to purchase the supplemental coverage through a separate policy.\r\nBoth\r\n  these contracts, the rental contract and the Philadelphia contract, are\r\n  unambiguous.Â  Smith v. Standard Oil Co., 180 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ga. 1971)\r\n  (â€œ[The] parol evidence rule [states] that a valid written contract, which is\r\n  complete, and the terms of which are not ambiguous, can not be contradicted,\r\n  added to, altered, or varied by parol agreements.â€). Â We hold, through a plain\r\n  reading of these contracts in concert with each other, Philadelphiaâ€™s higher\r\n  policy limits of $100,000/$300,000 are inapplicable to this case.Â  For Philadelphiaâ€™s higher policy limits to be triggered, the rental contract itself must provide\r\n  the excess coverage.Â  Here, the rental contract makes no such provision.Â  Williams obtains excess coverage only through a separate, additional contract.Â  In giving\r\n  meaning to the clear terms of these contracts, we are not persuaded by the\r\n  argument that the rental agreement â€œwas the mechanism by which Thrifty became\r\n  obligated to provide additional coverage.â€ Â Garnett v. WRP Enterprises, Inc.,\r\n  368 S.C. 549, 556, 630 S.E.2d 44, 47 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nWe find no merit in\r\n  Thriftyâ€™s contention that an exclusive focus on the Philadelphia contract (to\r\n  the exclusion of the rental contract) is appropriate and yields a different\r\n  result.Â  We must examine the terms of the Philadelphia contract to ascertain what\r\n  Thrifty and Philadelphia agreed to.Â  Thrifty and Philadelphia agreed in\r\n  unmistakable terms that Philadelphiaâ€™s coverage was applicable only when the\r\n  rental contract provided the coverage.Â  Thus, the coverage question before us\r\n  requires that we examine the Philadelphia contract and the rental\r\n  contract.Â  Because the rental contract provides that Williams purchased the\r\n  excess coverage through a separate policy outside the rental contract,\r\n  the excess limits are not provided by the Philadelphia contract.\r\nConclusion\r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in affirming the grant of\r\n  summary judgment finding the Philadelphia contract provided the excess coverage\r\n  to Williams.Â  Reviewing these unambiguous contracts in concert with each other,\r\n  we hold Philadelphiaâ€™s higher coverage rate of $100,000/$300,000 was not\r\n  implicated.Â  Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals and the trial\r\n  court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Admittedly, Philadelphia referenced an affidavit in support of its contention\r\n  that the $100,000/$300,000 policy limits were intended to apply to corporate\r\n  rentals only; however, this affidavit is properly excluded by the parol\r\n  evidence rule and this Court need not consider this information.Â  See Ga. Code Ann. Â§ 13-2-2(1) (â€œParol evidence is\r\n  inadmissible to add to, take from, or vary a written contract.â€).Â  This\r\n  is of no moment, for Thrifty concedes that it was not authorized to issue the\r\n  higher policy coverage to the renter Williams.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26567","title":"McMillan v.

S.C. Depâ€™t of Agric., 364 S.C. 60, 611 S.E.2d 323 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Petitioner South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA), the Fundâ€™s\r\n  administrator, contends the Fund is not liable to respondents.Â  We agree and\r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondents,\r\n  cotton farmers, brokered their cotton to Sea Island Trading Company (Sea Island).Â  Their cotton was stored in the Hampton County Warehouse (HCW).Â  Both HCW and Sea Island were owned by David Prosser.Â \r\n  Respondents testified that they received a 52Â¢/lb advance from Sea Island on\r\n  the cotton Sea Island was to broker for them.Â  Pursuant to their brokerage\r\n  agreements, they were to tell Sea Island when to sell the cotton, and depending\r\n  on the price obtained on the sale date, Sea Island would either pay them\r\n  additional money, or if the cotton sold for less than 52Â¢/lb, then they would\r\n  owe Sea Island money.\r\nAt some point Sea Island sold respondentsâ€™ cotton, apparently without their consent.Â  While the cotton\r\n  remained stored at HCW, and before respondents had received any additional\r\n  funds from Sea Island, Sea Island, HCW, and Prosser filed bankruptcy.Â  After\r\n  the bankruptcies, respondents sought to recover from the Fund.Â  SCDA denied the\r\n  claim, and respondents brought this circuit court action against SCDA.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether\r\n  respondents are entitled to a recovery from the Fund?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nRespondents have\r\n  conceded that the Court of Appeals went too far in relying upon Prosserâ€™s role\r\n  as a principal in both Sea Island and HCW to hold that the warehouse and the\r\n  brokerage are â€œessentially the same entity.â€Â  Moreover, they now agree that\r\n  they cannot rely on that part of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-22-200 (Supp. 2007), which\r\n  requires an affidavit under certain circumstances not present here.Â  At oral\r\n  argument, respondents admitted that they are not relying on any misconduct on\r\n  the part of HCW, but rather on the fact the cotton they farmed[2] was located in HCW when the warehouse declared bankruptcy.Â  In so doing, they\r\n  rely on S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-22-15, which provides:\r\n\r\n\tFor\r\n  purposes of this chapter, â€œlossâ€ means any monetary loss over and beyond the\r\n  amount protected by a warehousemanâ€™s bond sustained as a result of storing a\r\n  commodity in a state-licensed warehouse including, but not limited to, any\r\n  monetary loss over and beyond the amount protected by a warehousemanâ€™s bond\r\n  sustained as a result of the warehousemanâ€™s bankruptcy, embezzlement, or fraud.\r\n\r\nHere, respondents\r\n  did not suffer â€œany monetary lossâ€¦as a result of storing a commodity in [HCW],â€\r\n  nor did they sustain any monetary loss â€œas a result of [HCWâ€™s] bankruptcyâ€¦.â€Â \r\n  Respondentsâ€™ loss was the result of Sea Islandâ€™s wrongful disposition of the\r\n  cotton they had produced, and its inability to pay them additional sums as a\r\n  result of its bankruptcy.Â  Respondents did not suffer a warehouse loss within\r\n  the meaning of Â§ 39-22-15, and therefore were not entitled to receive money\r\n  from the Fund under Â§ 39-22-150 (Supp. 2007).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the\r\n  Court of Appeals upholding the special refereeâ€™s order awarding respondents a\r\n  recovery from the Fund and attorneys fees is\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice Lee S. Alford, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Court of Appeals reversed that part of the special refereeâ€™s order awarding\r\n  respondents prejudgment interest, and respondents did not challenge that ruling\r\n  by way of a petition for writ of certiorari.\r\n[2] It is apparent from this record that Sea Island sold the vast majority of the\r\n  cotton to other brokers before its bankruptcy.Â  Although respondents contest Sea Islandâ€™s right to sell the cotton, they have not alleged that the buyers were not bona\r\n  fide purchasers for value.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of William Gary White, III","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2008-11-17-01","description":"","date":"2008-11-24","type":"order","text":"\r\n  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of William Gary White, III, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nRespondent was suspended\r\n  on May 12, 2008, for a period of six months.Â  He has now filed an affidavit\r\n  requesting reinstatement pursuant to Rule 32, of the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement contained in Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\nThe request is granted\r\n  and he is hereby reinstated to the practice of law in this state.\r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      JEAN H.
