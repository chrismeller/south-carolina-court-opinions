Shupe, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER:Â  Appellant, William H.\r\n  Gaines, was convicted of three counts of criminal solicitation of a minor, in\r\n  violation of a recently enacted statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-342 (Supp.\r\n  2006).Â  He appeals contending, a) evidence of prior chat room conversations was\r\n  improperly admitted; b) he was entitled to an entrapment instruction; and c) he\r\n  was entitled to a directed verdict.Â  We disagree and affirm the convictions.\r\nFACTS\r\nGaines,\r\n  using the computer alias of HMMRTHEGRT8, engaged in internet communications on\r\n  AOL chat rooms with a person he believed to be a twelve year old girl in Philadelphia , PA.Â  The girl used the screen name â€œLilAshleyPA.â€Â  The online chats occurred\r\n  in an America Online (AOL) chat room between February and June 2004 during\r\n  which time Gaines encouraged LilAshleyPA to travel to Greenville, South Carolina to see him.Â  Gaines repeatedly made detailed sexual references as to how he\r\n  wanted to spend time with LilAshleyPA when she arrived in South Carolina and\r\n  proposed to rent a hotel room where she could stay with him.Â Â  He also offered\r\n  to buy LilAshleyPA clothing and lingerie and requested that she send him nude\r\n  photos of herself.Â  He emphasized that LilAshleyPA needed to keep their plans a\r\n  secret because â€œguys my age arenâ€™t allowed to date girls your age.â€\r\nUnbeknownst\r\n  to Gaines, LilAshleyPA was actually Lisa Carroll, an undercover detective with\r\n  the Pennsylvania Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.Â  Detective\r\n  Carroll obtained a court order to obtain information on Gainesâ€™s identification\r\n  and upon discovering Gaines lived in South Carolina, Detective Carroll referred\r\n  the matter to South Carolina authorities.\r\nThereafter,\r\n  South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) agents set up an AOL internet\r\n  account using the screen name â€œAllyinsc13.â€Â  In October 2004, Allyinsc13\r\n  contacted HMMRTHEGRT8 online by saying â€œhey.â€Â  Gaines responded and the two\r\n  began to chat.Â  After discovering that Allyinsc13 was a thirteen-year-old\r\n  living in Columbia and disclosing that he was twenty-eight years old, Gaines\r\n  inquired into the possibility of their meeting up for the purpose of engaging\r\n  in various forms of sexual intercourse.Â  Allyinsc13 indicated that she was\r\n  interested in HMMRTHEGRT8â€™s visiting her in Columbia, and in their subsequent\r\n  chats, Gaines proposed renting a hotel room and theorized the details of their\r\n  first sexual encounter.Â  He also offered to buy Allyinsc13 jeans and lingerie\r\n  and requested she send him a photo.Â  Gaines reminded Allyinsc13 that she needed\r\n  to keep their relationship a secret because â€œguys my age arenâ€™t supposed to\r\n  date girls under 18.â€Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on Gainesâ€™s chats with Allyinsc13, which continued until the end of January\r\n  2005, SLED agents procured an order to obtain HMMRTHEGRT8â€™s records from AOL.Â \r\n  SLED agents confirmed that the online chats originated from the home that\r\n  Gaines shared with his parents in Travelerâ€™s Rest and obtained a search warrant\r\n  under which they confiscated Gainesâ€™s computer.Â  Gaines subsequently provided\r\n  oral and written statements admitting that he used the screen name HMMRTHEGRT8\r\n  andÂ  that he communicated with girls on the Internet using that name, but\r\n  claimed he was â€œjust talkingâ€ with them.\r\nGaines was indicted\r\n  on three counts of criminal solicitation of a minor in violation of S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-15-342 for online chats with Allyinsc13 on October 25, 2004, November\r\n  30, 2004, and January 27, 2005.Â  A jury convicted Gaines on all three counts.Â \r\n  He was sentenced to concurrent ten-year terms, suspended to four years\r\n  incarceration with five years probation on each count.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â Â Â Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.Â  Did the\r\n    trial court properly admit Gainesâ€™ chat room conversations with LilAshleyPA?\r\n  2.Â  Did\r\n    the trial court err in refusing a jury charge on the law of entrapment?\r\n  3.Â  Did\r\n    the trial court err in denying Gainesâ€™ motion for a directed verdict?\r\n\r\n1.Â  CHATS WITH LILASHLEY PA\r\nGaines contends the internet chats he had with\r\n  LilAshleyPA between February and July 2004 were improperly admitted at trial.Â \r\n  We disagree.[1]Â \r\n  We find the chats were proper admitted.Â  \r\nInitially, Gaines contends\r\n  that since S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-342 (Supp. 2006) did not become effective until\r\n  April 26, 2004,[2] and most of his chats with LilAshleyPA occurred prior to that date, the earlier\r\n  chats should not have been admitted inasmuch as they were not criminal behavior.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  The fact that the offense of criminal solicitation of a minor did\r\n  not become a crime in South Carolina until April 24, 2004 is not dispositive.Â  The\r\n  chats with LilAshleyPA were at all times illegal under Pennsylvania law.Â  See 18 Pa. C.S.A. Â§ 6318 (unlawful contact with a minor if intentional contact with\r\n  minor for purposes of engaging in sexual activity).Â  Further, Gaines was not indicted for the chats with LilAshleyPA.Â Â  Accordingly, we find no merit to this\r\n  contention.\r\nFurther, although\r\n  many of the chats Gaines had with LilAshleyPA occurred prior to April 24, 2004,\r\n  there were also chats in June 2004, in which he reiterated both his desire to\r\n  make love to LilAshleyPA before she turned 13, and his desire to fly her to SC\r\n  to be with her.Â  Accordingly, the earlier chats were cumulative.Â  State v.\r\n  Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 512 S.E.2d 795 (1999) (to qualify for reversal on\r\n  ground of cumulative effect of trial errors, defendant must demonstrate errors\r\n  adversely affected right to fair trial); State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370,\r\n  453 S.E.2d 890(1995) (error in admission of evidence is harmless where it is\r\n  cumulative to other evidence which was properly admitted).\r\nIn any event,\r\n  evidence of the chats with LilAshleyPA were properly admitted by the trial\r\n  court pursuant to Rule 404(b), SCACR, because they were relevant to demonstrate\r\n  a common scheme or plan, intent, and/or the absence of mistake.Â  \r\nEvidence of other\r\n  crimes, wrongs, or acts is generally not admissible to prove the defendantâ€™s\r\n  guilt for the crime charged.Â  Such evidence is, however, admissible to show motive,\r\n  identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or\r\n  accident, or intent.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE; State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 262 (2006); State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).\r\n  To be admissible, the bad act must logically relate to the crime with which the\r\n  defendant has been charged.Â  If the defendant was not convicted of the prior\r\n  crime, evidence of the prior bad act must be clear and convincing.Â  Id.; State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135-36, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682-83 (2000). Even\r\n  if prior bad act evidence is clear and convincing and falls within an\r\n  exception, it must be excluded if its probative value is substantially\r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  Rules 403,\r\n  404(b), SCRE; State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 646 S.E.2d 872 (2007); State\r\n  v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001).\r\nWhere there is a\r\n  close degree of similarity between the crime charged and the prior bad act,\r\n  both this Court and the Court of Appeals have held prior bad acts are\r\n  admissible to demonstrate a common scheme or plan.Â  See State v.\r\n  Hallman, 298 S.C. 172, 175, 379 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1989) (evidence of prior\r\n  bad acts bears such close similarity to the offense charged in this case that\r\n  its probative value clearly outweighs its prejudicial effect); State v.\r\n  McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 392, 323 S.E.2d 772, 774 (1984) (such evidence is\r\n  inadmissible unless the close similarity of the charged offense and the\r\n  previous act enhances the probative value of the evidence so as to overrule the\r\n  prejudicial effect); State v. Patrick, 318 S.C. 352, 356 457 S.E.2d 632,\r\n  635 (Ct.App.1995) (sufficient similarities between the Georgia case and present\r\n  case to apply the Lyle common scheme or plan exception); State v.\r\n  Blanton, 316 S.C. 31, 32, 446 S.E.2d 438, 439 (Ct.App.1994) (prior acts\r\n  were sufficiently similar to the charged offense to be admissible); State v.\r\n  Wingo, 304 S.C. 173, 176, 403 S.E.2d 322, 324 (Ct.App.1991) (prior bad acts\r\n  tended to show common plan or scheme when the experiences of each victim\r\n  paralleled that of the other victims).Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the facts presented here, it is clear the prior chats with LilAshleyPA were\r\n  properly admitted.Â  In both cases, HMMRTHEGRT8 engaged in AOL chat room\r\n  conversations with young females whom he believed to be twelve and thirteen\r\n  years old.Â  He told both girls he was twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old\r\n  and explained that it was illegal for him to date them.Â  He proposed to both\r\n  the idea of taking them to a motel room and also expressed his desire for each\r\n  to come and live with him.Â  He sought confirmation from both girls that they\r\n  had not been intimate with anyone before, requested that each send him photos\r\n  of themselves, offered to buy them clothing and lingerie, and suggested similar\r\n  sexual acts for the girls to perform.Â  Accordingly, we find the chats with\r\n  LilAshleyPA were properly admitted.\r\n2.Â  ENTRAPMENT\r\nGaines next asserts he was entitled to a jury\r\n  instruction on the defense of entrapment.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nThe law to be\r\n  charged to the jury is determined by the evidence presented at trial.Â  State\r\n  v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647 S.E.2d 144 (2007) cert. deniedÂ  2008\r\n  WL 1699517 (U.S. Sup. Ct. April 14, 2008); State v. Knoten, 347 S.C.\r\n  296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).Â  To warrant reversal, a trial courtâ€™s\r\n  refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial\r\n  to the defendant.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298\r\n  (2002).Â  \r\nâ€œThe affirmative\r\n  defense of entrapment is available where there is the conception and planning\r\n  of an offense by an officer, and his procurement of its commission by one who\r\n  would not have perpetrated it except for trickery, persuasion, or fraud of the\r\n  officer.â€Â  State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 607 S.E.2d 93 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (citation omitted).Â  The defense of entrapment is not available to a defendant\r\n  who is predisposed to commit a crime independent of governmental inducement and\r\n  influence.Â  Thus, the entrapment defense consists of two elements: (1)\r\n  government inducement, and (2) lack of predisposition.Â Â  Id. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The\r\n  fact that a government official merely affords opportunities or facilities for\r\n  the commission of the offense does not constitute entrapment.Â  State v.\r\n  Johnson, 295 S.C. 215, 367 S.E.2d 700 (1988), citing Sherman v.\r\n  United States, 356 U.S. 369 (1958).Â  \r\n The mere fact that\r\n  Gainesâ€™ initial contact with Allyinsc13 was instigated by a SLED agent\r\n  contacting him and stating, â€œheyâ€ does not entitle him to an entrapment\r\n  instruction.Â  The initial contact merely afforded Gaines the opportunity to\r\n  solicit sex.Â Â  Gaines was in no way induced to commit the crime of criminal\r\n  solicitation of a minor.Â  Accord State v. Cooper, 302 S.C. 184,\r\n  186, 394 S.E.2d 717, 718 (Ct. App.1990) (defendant was not entitled to a jury\r\n  instruction on entrapment where she engaged in the illegal activity because of\r\n  her own preexisting readiness to do so and not because of incessant demands\r\n  made upon her by an undercover agent).Â  Gainesâ€™ request to charge was properly\r\n  denied.Â  \r\n3.Â  DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nGaines lastly asserts\r\n  he was entitled to a directed verdict as there was no evidence of any â€œovert\r\n  actâ€ on his part in an attempt to actually engage in the sexual acts.Â Â  We\r\n  disagree; we find no such act required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-342.\r\n When ruling on a\r\n  motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence\r\n  or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight. State v. Weston, 367 S.C.\r\n  279, 625 S.E.2d 641 (2006); State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d\r\n  475 (2004).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is\r\n  concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight. Â A\r\n  defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the state fails to produce\r\n  evidence of the offense charged.Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed\r\n  verdict, the Court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the\r\n  light most favorable to the state.Â  If there is any direct evidence or any\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused, the Court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Id.Â  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-15-342(A) provides:\r\n\r\n  (A)\r\n    A person eighteen years of age or older commits the offense of criminal\r\n    solicitation of a minor if he knowingly contacts or communicates with, or\r\n      attempts to contact or communicate with, a person who is under the age of\r\n      eighteen, or a person reasonably believed to be under the age of eighteen, for\r\n        the purpose of or with the intent of persuading, inducing, enticing, or\r\n        coercing the person to engage or participate in a sexual activity as\r\n    defined in Section 16-15-375(5) or a violent crime as defined in Section\r\n    16-1-60, or with the intent to perform a sexual activity in the presence of the\r\n    person under the age of eighteen, or person reasonably believed to be under the\r\n    age of eighteen.Â  (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nGaines contends\r\n  this Court should construe the statute to require some â€œovert actâ€ in\r\n  furtherance of the criminal solicitation, such as travel to a destination,\r\n  arrival with condoms, booking of hotel rooms, etc.Â Â  The plain language of the\r\n  statute imposes no such requirements.Â  \r\nIn interpreting\r\n  statutes, we look to the plain meaning of the statute and the intent of the\r\n  Legislature.Â  State v. Dingle, ___S.C.___, 659 S.E.2d 101(2008).Â  All\r\n  rules of statutory construction are subservient to the maxim that legislative\r\n  intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used.Â  State\r\n  v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 647 S.E.2d 144 (2007).Â  A statuteâ€™s language must\r\n  be construed in light of the intended purpose of the statute. Whenever\r\n  possible, legislative intent should be found in the plain language of the\r\n  statute itself.Â  Where the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and\r\n  conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are\r\n  not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.Â  Id. Â \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-15-342(A) requires that a person over the age of eighteen knowingly\r\n  communicate with a person believed to be under the age of eighteen for the\r\n  purpose of or with the intent of persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing\r\n  the person to engage or participate in a sexual activity.Â Â  It is patent that\r\n  Gaines communicated with Allyinsc13 with the intent of enticing her to\r\n  participate in sexual activity.Â Â  Nothing more is required by the statute.\r\nGaines bases his\r\n  â€œovert actâ€ contention on cases from other jurisdictions.Â Â  The cases cited by\r\n  Gaines are simply inapposite and involve statutes which are dissimilar to the South Carolina statute.Â  We find S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-342 requires no overt act in\r\n  furtherance of the criminal solicitation such that the trial court properly\r\n  denied Gainesâ€™ motion for a directed verdict.\r\n\r\nGainesâ€™\r\n  convictions are affirmed.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY, J., and Acting Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â Â  I agree that the evidence of appellantâ€™s\r\n  communications with LilAshley PA were admissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â Â \r\n  Having concluded the Pennsylvania evidence was admissible under 404(b), the\r\n  next issue is whether the prejudicial impact of this evidence outweighs its\r\n  probative value.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  While this is a close question, appellant\r\n  cannot demonstrate reversible error.Â  Even if the LilAshley PA evidence were\r\n  not admissible in the Stateâ€™s case-in-chief, once appellant interposed the\r\n  defense of entrapment his earlier efforts to entice a young girl to come to South Carolina would have been admissible to prove appellantâ€™s prior disposition to commit\r\n  the offense.Â  Accordingly, I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm\r\n  appellantâ€™s convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Gainesâ€™ First Amendment objection was not ruled\r\n  upon by the trial court, such that we need not address it.Â  We note, however,\r\n  that the First Amendment does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to\r\n  establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent.Â  See United States v. Curtin, 489 F.3d 935 (9th Cir. 2006).Â Â  Gainesâ€™\r\n  reliance on Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 542 U.S. 656\r\n  (2004) is misplaced; Ashcroft involved an overbreadth challenge to the\r\n  Child Online Protection Act.\r\n[2]Â  Section 16-15-342 was added by 2004 Act No. 208,\r\n  Â§ 4, effective April 26, 2004.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26553","title":"Armstrong-Pierce v.

Walker, Jr., of Conway, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAmanda A. Bailey and Jessica A. Stokes, of McNair Law Firm, of\r\n  Myrtle Beach; and David James Canty, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIUM:Â  Irene Armstrong\r\n  and Retha Pierce were candidates for mayor of Atlantic Beach.Â  Pierce was\r\n  certified the winner by a one vote margin.Â  Armstrong filed a protest of the\r\n  election, and the Atlantic Beach Municipal Election Commission ordered a new\r\n  election.Â  Both Armstrong and Pierce appealed the Commissionâ€™s decision, and\r\n  the appeals were consolidated before the circuit court.Â  In affirming the\r\n  decision of the Commission, the circuit court modified the decision to require a de novo election, with the filing period for candidates to be reopened.Â  \r\nPierce\r\n  has appealed the order of the circuit court.Â  We affirm the decision of the\r\n  circuit court upholding the Commissionâ€™s decision to order a new election.Â \r\n  However, we reverse the decision of the circuit court requiring a de novo election be held.\r\nThe\r\n  record supports the finding that four voters were denied the right to vote\r\n  despite the fact they met the residency requirement of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-6-610(3) (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  Because Pierce won the election by one vote, this renders the result of the\r\n  election doubtful and requires a new election.Â  Gecy v.\r\n    Bagwell, 372 S.C. 237, 642 S.E.2d 569\r\n  (2007); Taylor v. Town of Atlantic Beach Election Commâ€™n, 363 S.C. 8, 609 S.E.2d 500 (2005).Â  Therefore, the\r\n  circuit court judge properly affirmed the decision ordering a new election.\r\nHowever,\r\n  the circuit court judge improperly considered allegations of fraud as well as\r\n  media reports of criminal charges not presented to the Commission in the\r\n  election protest.Â  Taylor v.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Deputy\r\n          Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Robert W. Dibble, Jr., of McNair Law Firm, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this attorney disciplinary proceeding, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct filed\r\n  formal charges against Respondent under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, with regard to four matters.Â  Respondent entered\r\n  into stipulations of fact on these initial matters.Â  At the disciplinary hearing,\r\n  the record was kept open pending the resolution of two new matters, and the Commission\r\n  ultimately filed additional charges for the new matters.Â  By consent order, the\r\n  parties agreed the new allegations could be decided on the pleadings.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  a subpanel of the Commission issued a report recommending that Respondent be\r\n  suspended indefinitely from the practice of law, that he be required to pay the\r\n  costs incurred in this disciplinary proceeding, and that an attorney be\r\n  appointed to represent his clientsâ€™ interests.Â  The full panel adopted the\r\n  findings of the subpanel.Â  Respondent seeks review, challenging two of the\r\n  panelâ€™s findings and arguing the sanction imposed is too harsh.Â  We conclude Respondent\r\n  shall receive a definite suspension of two years and shall be responsible for\r\n  the payment of costs.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent faced formal disciplinary\r\n  charges in connection with the following six matters:\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent\r\n  was hired to help a separating couple obtain a custody arrangement with\r\n  relatives that would allow their child to stay within his current school\r\n  district until the end of the school year.Â  Respondent later represented the\r\n  husband in his separation and his divorce.Â  A custody dispute subsequently\r\n  arose when the relatives wanted to retain custody of the coupleâ€™s child and a\r\n  consent order was improperly filed granting full custody to the relatives.Â  Respondent\r\n  admittedly did not review the clocked copy of the consent order regarding\r\n  custody and did not advise the parties regarding a conflict of interest. Â Further,\r\n  he failed to timely respond to the complaint in this matter or to respond to\r\n  the notice of full investigation.Â  The subpanel concluded Respondent had\r\n  violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct contained in Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.7 (Conflicts of\r\n  Interest); and Rule 8.1 (Disciplinary Matters). \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent admits that he failed to respond to the initial inquiry\r\n  from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC), the Treacy[1] letter, and the notice of full\r\n  investigation in this matter.Â  No other allegations of misconduct remain.Â  The\r\n  subpanel concluded Respondent violated Rule 8.1 (Disciplinary Matters) of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent\r\n  stipulated to the following facts.Â  Respondent represented a client in a civil\r\n  matter that was originally filed by another attorney.Â  Respondent failed to act\r\n  with diligence in obtaining an order of substitution.Â  Once substituted, he\r\n  entered into a verbal agreement with opposing counsel that he would not respond\r\n  to discovery requests until a motion for partial summary judgment was resolved,\r\n  but he did not confirm this in writing or advise his client of the alleged\r\n  agreement. Â Respondent also failed to file a reply to the motion for partial\r\n  summary judgment, although he attended the hearing.Â  After partial summary\r\n  judgment was granted against the client, the client asked Respondent to file an\r\n  appeal.Â  Respondent told the client that she should find another attorney for\r\n  the appeal because he did not handle appellate work and his fee arrangement\r\n  limited the scope of his representation.Â  The client told Respondent that she\r\n  did not think she could get another attorney.Â  The client later filed a pro se notice of appeal with the South Carolina Court of Appeals while\r\n  Respondent was hospitalized.Â  Respondent filed a motion to be relieved as\r\n  counsel in which he stated the client had â€œproceeded on her own without the\r\n  advice or knowledge of counsel.â€Â  He also had the client sign a release stating\r\n  she had no complaint about him, although the client had a grievance pending\r\n  against him at the time.Â  Respondent later moved to be relieved from the\r\n  remainder of the circuit court case that had not been disposed of by partial\r\n  summary judgment and he did not respond to the clientâ€™s inquiries about the\r\n  case or to the clientâ€™s request for a refund of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  did not respond to the initial inquiry in this matter from ODC, the Treacy letter, or the notice of full investigation.Â  The subpanel found Respondent had violated the following\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of Representation); Rule 1.3\r\n  (Diligence); Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.8(h) (Prohibited Transactions);\r\n  Rule 3.3 (Candor to the Tribunal); Rule 8.1 (Disciplinary Matters); Rule 8.4(d)\r\n  (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (Conduct\r\n  Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice). \r\nWith\r\n  regard to Rules 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, the subpanel noted Respondent admitted\r\n  he failed to diligently pursue portions of the clientâ€™s case and to adequately\r\n  communicate with her, and he admitted he failed to comply with requests for\r\n  information from ODC.Â  The subpanel found Respondent violated Rule 1.8(h) when\r\n  he presented the client a document containing language absolving him of\r\n  liability for his representation and asked her to sign it without independent\r\n  representation.Â  With regard to Rule 3.3, the subpanel stated, â€œ[W]e find it\r\n  likely that Respondent mischaracterized the grounds for his motion to be\r\n  relieved in [the clientâ€™s] appeal as her conduct in proceeding â€˜on her own\r\n  without the advice or knowledge of counselâ€™ when[] she was likely proceeding on\r\n  Respondentâ€™s advice and with his knowledge.â€Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent represented a client in a divorce matter in which\r\n  opposing counsel served Respondent with a counterclaim and a subpoena for\r\n  medical records.Â  At the disciplinary hearing, Respondent stated he had or\r\n  assumed he had responded to the counterclaim and the subpoena.Â  The documents\r\n  were not in the client file and Respondent left the hearing agreeing to locate\r\n  the documents and send them to ODC.Â  \r\nA reply and two letters addressed to opposing counsel were\r\n  subsequently faxed to ODC by Respondentâ€™s secretary.Â  The three documents were\r\n  not signed by Respondent.Â  ODC challenged the authenticity of the documents.Â \r\n  Respondent admitted the documents were fabricated and backdated, but stated he\r\n  believed his secretary might have fabricated the documents as an act of\r\n  revenge.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing the evidence, including the fact that Respondent had admitted the\r\n  documents sent to ODC were fabricated, the subpanel concluded that regardless\r\n  of whether the documents were personally fabricated by Respondent or someone\r\n  else, the documents came from Respondentâ€™s office on his letterhead and he was\r\n  responsible for their submission to ODC.Â  The subpanel explained:Â  â€œWe may be\r\n  unable to determine that ODC has proved Respondent fabricated the documents,\r\n  however, the totality of the evidence presented makes it difficult for us to\r\n  free the Respondent from any responsibility.â€\r\nThe\r\n  subpanel stated Respondent had admitted that his conduct did not comply with\r\n  his ethical obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR, citing Rule 5.3 (Responsibilities Regarding Non-Lawyer Assistants) and\r\n  Rule 8.1 (Disciplinary Matters).Â  The subpanel further found that, based on\r\n  Respondentâ€™s level of involvement in the fabrication of documents sent to ODC,\r\n  he had violated Rule 8.4(d) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation)\r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice).\r\nMatter V\r\nA client hired Respondent to represent him in a domestic matter and\r\n  to assert a malpractice action against a prior attorney who had handled the\r\n  case.Â  Respondent obtained a favorable outcome for the client in the domestic\r\n  matter, but he admitted that he failed to competently and diligently pursue the\r\n  malpractice claim and that he should have moved to withdraw from the\r\n  malpractice case.Â  Respondent conceded that, among other things, he failed to\r\n  respond to discovery requests, to a motion to compel discovery, and to requests\r\n  from the court regarding the status of the case.Â  He also failed to respond to\r\n  a motion for summary judgment and to attend a hearing on the motion, to advise\r\n  the client that summary judgment had been granted, and to file an appeal.Â Â  \r\nThe subpanel found that Respondent had admitted in his answer sufficient\r\n  facts to support the conclusion that he had violated the following Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule\r\n  1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.5\r\n  (Fees); Rule 3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions); Rule 3.2 (Expediting\r\n  Litigation); Rule 3.4(c) (Disobedience of Obligation under the Rules); and Rule\r\n  3.4(d) (Failure to Comply with Discovery Requests).\r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent admitted that he settled a clientâ€™s claims without\r\n  withholding or paying the costs and fees owed under a lien to a prior attorney who\r\n  handled the matter, despite receiving notice of the lien from the prior\r\n  attorney and a copy of the clientâ€™s signed acknowledgement of the obligation.Â  The subpanel concluded Respondent violated Rule 1.15\r\n  (Safekeeping Property) of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nAfter\r\n  establishing the rules that had been violated by Respondent, the subpanel\r\n  considered both mitigating and aggravating circumstances before determining the\r\n  appropriate sanction to recommend for Respondent.Â  \r\nIn mitigation, the\r\n  subpanel considered the testimony of Respondentâ€™s two character witnesses, a\r\n  bailiff at his local courthouse and a detective with a local police\r\n  department.Â  Both witnesses testified that, in their opinions, Respondent was\r\n  an honest, law-abiding citizen.Â  \r\nIn aggravation, the\r\n  subpanel considered three factors:Â  (1) the egregiousness of some of the rule\r\n  violations, (2) the apparent pattern of other rules violations, and (3)\r\n  Respondentâ€™s disciplinary history.\r\nFirst,\r\n  the subpanel found Respondentâ€™s misconduct involved some of the most serious\r\n  violations a lawyer can commit, including allowing the fabrication of\r\n  documents, making false and misleading statements, and failing to cooperate in\r\n  a disciplinary investigation.Â  Second, the subpanel found Respondent appears to\r\n  have a pattern of committing some of the more routine violations, such as\r\n  failing to adequately communicate with clients, to diligently pursue his\r\n  clientsâ€™ interests, and to provide competent representation.Â  Third,\r\n  Respondentâ€™s disciplinary history was considered the most significant factor.Â \r\n  The subpanel noted that in 2000 he was given a letter of caution with a finding\r\n  of minor misconduct and in 2001 he received an admonition.Â  In both of the\r\n  prior instances Respondent failed to cooperate in the disciplinary\r\n  investigations.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  considering the foregoing, the subpanel recommended that (1)&nbsp;Respondent be\r\n  indefinitely suspended from the practice of law, (2)&nbsp;Respondent be ordered\r\n  to pay the costs of this proceeding, and (3) an attorney be appointed to\r\n  protect the interests of Respondentâ€™s clients.Â  The full panel adopted the\r\n  findings of the subpanel.\r\nLAW\r\nIn\r\n  his brief, Respondent challenges two of the findings and the recommendation of\r\n  an indefinite suspension.\r\nâ€œThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline\r\n  is given rests entirely with this Court.â€Â  In re Tullis, 375 S.C. 190,\r\n  191, 652 S.E.2d 395, 395&nbsp;(2007).Â  The Court â€œhas the sole authority . . .\r\n  to decide the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the record.â€Â  In\r\n    re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  â€œThe Court is not\r\n  bound by the panelâ€™s recommendation and may make its own findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law.â€Â  In re Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661 S.E.2d 102,\r\n  106&nbsp;(2008).Â  A disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence.Â  In re Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677,\r\n  682 (2006); see also Rule 8 of Rule 413, SCACR (â€œCharges of misconduct or\r\n  incapacity shall be established by clear and convincing evidence, and the\r\n  burden of proof of the charges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.â€).\r\nI.Â  Mischaracterization\r\n  in Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.\r\nRespondent\r\n  first argues the panel erred in finding\r\n  he violated Rule 3.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, in\r\n  Matter III by mischaracterizing the basis for his request to be relieved as\r\n  counsel.Â  In the motion he filed with the South Carolina Court of Appeals, Respondent\r\n  stated the client had â€œproceeded on her own without the advice or knowledge of\r\n  counsel.â€Â  Respondent asserts the panel found the statement was true and the\r\n  report on its face demonstrates that ODC failed to establish this violation by\r\n  clear and convincing evidence.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe subpanel\r\n  noted that the client in Matter III had filed a pro se notice of\r\n  appeal during Respondentâ€™s hospitalization and that â€œRespondent did not know\r\n  [the client] had done this and did not advise her about it at the time because\r\n  of his medical condition.â€Â  The subpanel found Respondentâ€™s statement in his\r\n  motion was truthful:Â  â€œWe note that the statement in the motion to be relieved\r\n  as counsel was true.Â  [The client] did, in fact, proceed to actually file the\r\n  appeal without the advice or knowledge of the Respondent.Â  He was in the\r\n  hospital incommunicado at the time.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  subpanel further found, however, that Respondent did advise his client about an\r\n  appeal at some point, even if he did not do so at the time the client actually\r\n  filed a notice of appeal.Â  The subpanel noted:Â  â€œIn fact, [the client] had\r\n  received advice from Respondent that she could appeal, but that he would not be\r\n  able to represent her on appeal.â€Â  The subpanel concluded, and the panel\r\n  agreed, that Respondent had, therefore, violated Rule 3.3 (Candor to the\r\n  Tribunal):Â  â€œWith regard to Rule 3.3, we find it likely that Respondent\r\n  mischaracterized the grounds for his motion to be relieved in [the clientâ€™s]\r\n  appeal as her conduct in proceeding â€˜on her own without the advice or knowledge\r\n  of counselâ€™ when[] she was likely proceeding on Respondentâ€™s advice and with\r\n  his knowledge.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  subpanelâ€™s finding that Respondent â€œlikelyâ€ mischaracterized the ground for his\r\n  motion to be relieved does not meet the clear and convincing standard of\r\n  proof.Â  This is especially true in light of the fact that the subpanel found\r\n  Respondentâ€™s statement that he did not know about the clientâ€™s decision to\r\n  proceed with a pro se appeal was, in fact, true.Â  The subpanel\r\n  implied that Respondentâ€™s statement was a mischaracterization because he spoke\r\n  to the client about an appeal at some point, although not necessarily when she\r\n  decided to proceed pro se.Â  We conclude Respondentâ€™s statement\r\n  simply advised the tribunal that he had no involvement in the clientâ€™s filing\r\n  of a pro se appeal and that there is no sanctionable conduct in\r\n  this instance. \r\nII.Â \r\n  Submission of Falsified Documents to ODC.\r\nRespondent\r\n  next argues the panel erred in finding he\r\n  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct in Matter IV by being involved in\r\n  the submission of fabricated documents to ODC.Â  Respondent asserts (a) ODC\r\n  failed to prove he fabricated the documents; (b)&nbsp;there was insufficient\r\n  proof that he submitted the false documents to ODC; (c) the testimony of his secretary\r\n  was not credible; and (d) the panel applied the wrong standard of proof in\r\n  finding he violated Rules 8.4(d) and (e) of Rule 407, SCACR.\r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing the testimony, we find there is clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  Respondent allowed the submission of falsified documents to ODC.Â  Respondentâ€™s secretary\r\n  testified in detail about the circumstances surrounding the faxing of the backdated\r\n  documents to ODC.Â  She stated Respondent sent her to the courthouse to retrieve\r\n  the clientâ€™s file, and when she returned Respondent told her the documents in\r\n  question had â€œmagicallyâ€ appeared.Â  Respondent asked her to sign the letters\r\n  and fax them to ODC, which she did.Â  Respondent then shredded the originals.Â \r\n  In contrast, Respondent testified that he did not produce the documents and had\r\n  no knowledge of them before they were sent to ODC as he did not review them.Â \r\n  He stated his secretary might have fabricated the documents as a means of\r\n  revenge against him.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  contends the panel applied the wrong burden of proof because, in the report\r\n  prepared by the subpanel, it is stated:Â  â€œWe may be unable to determine that\r\n  ODC has proved Respondent fabricated the documents, however, the totality of\r\n  the evidence makes it difficult for us to free the Respondent from any\r\n  responsibility.â€Â  Respondent asserts this shows a mere preponderance of the\r\n  evidence standard was applied rather than a clear and convincing evidence\r\n  standard.Â  We disagree.Â  The subpanel (and panel) found Respondent was involved\r\n  in the submission of the admittedly falsified documents, regardless of whether\r\n  Respondent personally prepared them.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  conclusion is supported by the following evidence relied upon by the subpanel,\r\n  which noted (1) the format of the falsified letters does not match the format\r\n  typically used by Respondentâ€™s secretary, such as the signature line and the\r\n  initials indicating who prepared the letter; (2) the properties on the\r\n  electronic version of the documents indicate they were prepared at a time when\r\n  the secretaryâ€™s cell phone records show she was not in the office; (3)\r\n  Respondentâ€™s disciplinary history reveals a pattern of attempting to place\r\n  blame on his staff for his own conduct; and (4)&nbsp;Respondent testified\r\n  falsely regarding a number of inconsequential issues, only to retract his testimony\r\n  when ODC pointed out his contrary statements in his prior appearances.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find there is clear and convincing evidence indicating Respondent\r\n  was involved in the submission of falsified documents to ODC, which is\r\n  sanctionable conduct.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Appropriate\r\n  Sanction.\r\nRespondent lastly asserts the panelâ€™s recommended sanction of an indefinite suspension from the practice\r\n  of law is too harsh in light of his violations and his admission of certain\r\n  facts in these matters.Â  We adopt the findings of the panel as to the\r\n  determination of misconduct in each of the above matters except as to Matter\r\n  III.Â  As for Matter III, we find there does not exist clear and convincing\r\n  evidence that Respondent mischaracterized the basis for his motion to be\r\n  relieved as counsel and thus make no finding of misconduct in that regard.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the remaining violations and the mitigating and aggravating factors,\r\n  particularly Respondentâ€™s initial failure to cooperate in this proceeding, we find an appropriate sanction is a definite\r\n  suspension from the practice of law for two years.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of\r\n  the date of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of\r\n  this Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR (regarding the duties of an attorney\r\n  following disbarment or suspension).Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date of\r\n  this opinion, Respondent shall pay the costs incurred by ODC and the Commission\r\n  in the investigation of these matters.Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â In re Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240\r\n  (1982).Â  A Treacy letter â€œpoint[s] out that the failure to respond to\r\n  ODC constitutes sanctionable conduct.â€Â  In re Cabaniss, 369 S.C. 216,\r\n  217, 632 S.E.2d 280, 281 (2006).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26552","title":"Denmark Municipal Court  Judge Myron V.

Bogle, Jr., Senior Assistant Attorney\r\n          General, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        The Honorable Myron V. Anderson, of Denmark, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In\r\n  this judicial disciplinary matter, the Commission on\r\n  Judicial Conduct Panel (the Panel), recommended that respondent, Myron\r\n  V. Anderson, be removed from office.Â  We agree\r\n  respondent committed judicial misconduct, but we impose a public reprimand\r\n  which is the most severe sanction we currently are able to impose under\r\n  the circumstances.[1]Â \r\n  After a period of ninety (90) days from the date of this opinion, the Town of Denmark may reappoint respondent to the position of municipal court judge.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed formal charges in January 2006 against\r\n  respondent.[2]Â \r\n  Respondent wrote a letter in February 2006 acknowledging receipt of the formal\r\n  charges.Â  In this letter, respondent contended he had not committed misconduct\r\n  and requested a hearing.Â  Respondent, however, failed to attend the hearing\r\n  held on September 17, 2007.Â  The Panel thereafter issued its report and\r\n  recommended that respondent be removed from office and be required to pay the\r\n  costs of the proceedings.\r\nThe following facts are taken from a stipulation of facts between\r\n  respondent and Disciplinary Counsel wherein respondent admitted certain\r\n  allegations regarding two separate matters.Â  \r\nMotorist Matter\r\nOn August 19, 2004, respondent was about to enter Highway 321 from\r\n  his driveway when he noticed a pick-up truck traveling toward Denmark at what he thought was a high rate of speed.Â  Respondent estimated the truckâ€™s speed to be\r\n  100 miles per hour.Â  Once he entered the highway himself, respondent observed\r\n  the truck attempting to pass slower vehicles, almost causing some oncoming cars\r\n  to veer off the road.Â  \r\nGregory Brown was driving the truck.Â  Brown eventually stopped at\r\n  a red light in Denmark.Â  Respondent pulled up on the left side of the truck,\r\n  looked at Brown, and shook his head in a disapproving manner.Â  Brown rolled\r\n  down the window and asked what respondent was looking at, to which respondent\r\n  replied, â€œIâ€™m looking at you,â€ and made a comment about Brownâ€™s driving.Â  Brown\r\n  responded that he did not care what respondent thought, to which respondent replied:Â \r\n  â€œYou might ought to care, you might run into me at some point.â€Â  When Brown\r\n  asked why, respondent said that he was the municipal judge for Denmark.\r\nThe light changed, and as the truck pulled forward, respondent\r\n  turned right, across the traffic lane and pulled in behind the truck to an\r\n  adjacent parking lot.Â  According to respondent, he pulled off the road in order\r\n  to retrieve his cell phone, which had slid off the passenger seat, so he could\r\n  call police.\r\nAs respondent exited his vehicle, he noticed the truck coming\r\n  backward toward him.Â  Respondent assumed the truck was trying to run over him,\r\n  reported that it narrowly missed him and would have hit him had he not jumped\r\n  out of the way.Â  According to Brown, however, he did not know who respondent\r\n  was or what he was doing, and he drove backwards to keep respondent in front of\r\n  him in order to see what respondent was doing. \r\nAfter additional verbal exchange between respondent and Brown,\r\n  respondent entered his vehicle, drove through a red light, and proceeded to the\r\n  Denmark police department where respondent reported that someone had tried to\r\n  run over him.Â  An officer accompanied respondent back to the scene, and a\r\n  bystander reported that the truck had gone toward Barnwell.Â  The bystander gave\r\n  them Brownâ€™s license plate number.Â  Respondent then went to the local\r\n  magistrateâ€™s office and began the process of taking out a warrant against Brown\r\n  for the offense of threatening a public official.\r\nBrown was stopped by police a short while later in Barnwell.Â  A Denmark police officer brought Brown back to the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s office where respondent was seeking a warrant.\r\nThe\r\n  presiding magistrate examined the applicable statute and determined that a\r\n  warrant for the offense of threatening a public official should not be issued\r\n  and suggested that perhaps another charge would be more appropriate.Â  After\r\n  some discussion, the officer issued a reckless driving ticket to Brown.Â  The\r\n  magistrate set bond, and Brown was transported back to his truck.Â  Brown\r\n  subsequently mailed in a $200 bond, which was forfeited; he was convicted for\r\n  reckless driving.\r\nRespondent\r\n  asserted to Disciplinary Counsel that his intention was to dissuade Brown from\r\n  further dangerous driving that he believed was an imminent threat to other\r\n  motorists.Â  Respondent acknowledges that reference to his judicial office was\r\n  not appropriate.\r\nForeclosure Matter\r\nThis\r\n  matter relates to a foreclosure action on respondentâ€™s marital home which was\r\n  titled solely in the name of his wife.\r\nOn\r\n  October 6, 2004, a lis pendens and mortgage foreclosure action were\r\n  filed concerning the marital home.Â  An Order and Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale were filed on February 17, 2005, and the home was scheduled to be sold at public\r\n  auction on March 7, 2005.Â  However, the sale was delayed nearly a year by three\r\n  bankruptcy filings, each of which was dismissed.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  home was eventually auctioned on February 6, 2006.Â  The successful bidder was\r\n  the plaintiff in the foreclosure action, which then assigned its rights to the\r\n  Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA).Â  On February 15, 2006, the\r\n  property was deeded to FNMA, and the next day, the Referee issued an â€œOrder for\r\n  Writ of Assistance and Writ of Assistanceâ€ directing the occupants to vacate\r\n  the property on or before March 20, 2006.\r\nBy\r\n  letter dated February 15, 2006, respondent represented to counsel for the\r\n  plaintiff that respondent had purchased the subject property on February 3,\r\n  2006.Â  The letter further stated that a deed was signed and recorded on that\r\n  date at the Bamberg County courthouse.Â  Respondent requested that plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  counsel file a motion to vacate the sale.Â  Counsel gave four extensions of time\r\n  for the occupants to vacate the property, extending the date until May 19,\r\n  2006.\r\nWhen the broker\r\n  arrived at 9:00 a.m. on May 19, 2006, to take possession of the property,\r\n  respondent was present and produced a document titled â€œMotion to Dismiss Order\r\n  of Writ of Assistance and Writ of Assistance;â€ respondent told the broker it had\r\n  been filed that morning.Â  For this motion, respondent used the same docket\r\n  number as the foreclosure action, but styled the caption to show himself as the\r\n  plaintiff, the original plaintiff as defendant, and FNMA as an additional\r\n  defendant.Â  Respondent, however, had never been a named party to the foreclosure\r\n  action and he did not serve any of the parties with the motion.Â  Moreover, he\r\n  made representations in the motion that were factually incorrect, including\r\n  that he was the record owner of the property.Â  Respondentâ€™s actions delayed the\r\n  eviction which ultimately occurred on May 22, 2006.\r\nRespondent told\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel that he researched the Internet for advice on foreclosure\r\n  actions and this research gave him the idea that his wife should deed the\r\n  property to him.Â  Respondent believed the transfer of title was effective\r\n  because it had been accepted at the courthouse and he subsequently was shown as\r\n  the property owner on tax records.Â  Respondent thought his actions were\r\n  legitimate methods to resolve the foreclosure and he had intended to procure\r\n  the financing necessary to avoid foreclosure.\r\nLAW\r\nRespondentâ€™s\r\n  failure to appear at the hearing before the Panel results in the factual\r\n  allegations being deemed admitted by respondent.Â  Rule 24, the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement (RJDE), Rule 502, SCACR.\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following Canons of\r\n  the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR: Canon 1 (judge shall uphold\r\n  integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate\r\n  in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall\r\n  personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of\r\n  the judiciary will be preserved); Canon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and\r\n  the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect\r\n  and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes\r\n  public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2B\r\n  (judge shall not allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence\r\n  the judges judicial conduct or judgment); Canon\r\n  4 (a judge shall conduct extra-judicial activities so as to minimize the risk\r\n  of conflict with judicial obligations); Canon 4(A)(1) (aÂ  judge shall conduct extra-judicial activities so\r\n  that they do not cast reasonable doubt on the judgeâ€™s capacity to act\r\n  impartially as a judge); Canon 4(A)(2) (a judge shall conduct extra-judicial\r\n  activities so that they do not demean the judicial office).\r\nBy violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent has also violated\r\n  Rule 7(a)(1), RJDE.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find respondentâ€™s\r\n  misconduct warrants a public reprimand which, as previously noted, is the harshest\r\n  punishment we can give respondent due to his recent resignation. Â See In re Gravely, supra.\r\n  Â This sanction is imposed with the limitation that respondent may not hold\r\n  judicial office for ninety (90) days from the date of this opinion.Â  At the end of this 90-day term, the City of Denmark is at liberty to reappoint respondent as\r\n  municipal court judge. \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND. \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY, and KITTREDGE,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] After oral argument in this case, respondent\r\n  submitted his resignation to the Town of Denmark, effective September 30,\r\n  2008.Â  Because the Town accepted respondentâ€™s resignation, a public reprimand\r\n  is the most severe sanction available.Â  See, e.g., In the\r\n  Matter of Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924&nbsp;(1996) (â€œA public\r\n  reprimand is the most severe sanction that can be imposed when the respondent\r\n  no longer holds judicial office.â€).\r\n[2] Respondent has served as\r\n  the Municipal Judge for the Town of Denmark in Bamberg County since 2003.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26554","title":"Federal Financial Company v.

Scarborough, Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26554\r\nSeptember 17, 2008 - Filed October 13,\r\n  2008Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        David\r\n          K. Haller, of Haller Law Firm, of Charleston, and Lawrence E. Richter, Jr., of\r\n          The Richter Law Firm, of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellants.\r\n        Merrill\r\n          Anthony Cox, of Cox Law Firm, of Goose Creek, for Appellants.\r\n        Timothy\r\n          A. Domin, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Respondent brought this\r\n  declaratory judgment action to determine the validity of its mortgage, and the\r\n  priority of its mortgage and one given by appellant Daniels on property owned\r\n  by appellant Hartley.[1]Â \r\n  Hartley and Daniels appeal a masterâ€™s order finding respondentâ€™s mortgage is\r\n  valid, and has priority over Danielâ€™s mortgage.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  held a mortgage on property owned by Hartley.Â  The property was sold at a tax\r\n  sale to the Forfeited Land Commission (Commission) [2] in 1999.Â  Both respondent and Hartley denied receiving notice of the sale[3] and in June 2000 they agreed to modify certain of the mortgageâ€™s terms.Â  While\r\n  respondent was given timely notice of the expiration of the redemption period\r\n  in August 2000, neither it nor Hartley redeemed the property within a year\r\n  after the sale as permitted by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90 (Supp. 2007).Â  After\r\n  the year passed, the Charleston County Delinquent tax collector deeded the\r\n  property to the Commission in December 2000.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-51-130 (Supp. 2007).Â  Hartley continued to make payments on the mortgage\r\n  through August 2001.Â  She purchased the property from the Commission in\r\n  February 2002 and in July 2003 executed a note and mortgage in favor of\r\n  Daniels.Â  Respondent brought this declaratory judgment action in 2005.\r\nPursuant\r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-160:\r\n\r\n  In all\r\n    cases of tax sale the deed of conveyance, whether executed to a private person,\r\n    a corporation, or a forfeited land commission, is prima facie evidence of a\r\n    good title in the holder, that all proceedings have been regular and that all\r\n    legal requirements have been complied with.Â  An action for the recovery of land\r\n    sold pursuant to this chapter or for the recovery of the possession must not be\r\n    maintained unless brought within two years from the date of the sale as\r\n    provided in Section 12-51-90(C).\r\n\r\nThe two year limitation in\r\n  this statute is the period in which an owner who lost title to the property\r\n  through a tax sale may bring an action to recover that property.Â  Corbin v.\r\n    Carlin, 366 S.C. 187, 620 S.E.2d 745 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Once two years have\r\n  passed after the sale, the sale is not a cloud on the propertyâ€™s title.Â  Wilson v. Moseley, 327 S.C. 144, 488 S.E.2d 862 (1997).\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Whether\r\n    the master-in-equity erred in holding that respondent holds a valid first\r\n    mortgage on the property?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  master characterized Hartleyâ€™s reacquisition of the property from the\r\n  Commission not as a â€œpurchase,â€ but as a â€œredemption.â€Â  By characterizing\r\n  Hartley as a â€œredeemerâ€ rather than a â€œpurchaser,â€ the master concluded the\r\n  respondentâ€™s mortgage was not cancelled but retained its status as the first\r\n  lien on the property. Â The master also held â€œassuming Hartley or her\r\n  representative appeared and was the successful bidder at the delinquent tax\r\n  sale, in South Carolina â€˜a mortgagor cannot, by his negligence or fraud, suffer\r\n  the mortgaged lands to be sold for taxes and then, by purchase at tax saleâ€¦acquire\r\n  a title which he may set up to defeat the mortgageeâ€™s lienâ€¦.â€™â€ citing Interstate\r\n    Bldg. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Waters, 50 S.C. 459, 468 27 S.E. 948, 951\r\n  (1897).\r\nWe address the\r\n  masterâ€™s reasoning in reverse order.Â  First, the master hypothesized that had\r\n  Hartley bid at the tax sale as part of a negligent or fraudulent scheme to\r\n  defeat respondentâ€™s mortgage, then respondentâ€™s mortgage would still be valid.Â \r\n  In point of fact, however, neither Hartley nor her representative appeared at the\r\n  tax sale: the property was sold to the Commission.Â  Moreover, there is no\r\n  evidentiary support in the record for the proposition that Hartley was a\r\n  participant in any fraud to have the land sold at a tax sale, let the\r\n  redemption period run, and then repurchase the property from the Commission in\r\n  order to remove respondentâ€™s mortgage.Â  In fact she continued to make payments\r\n  to respondent for 22 months after the tax sale, lending credibility to her\r\n  testimony that she was unaware of the sale and subsequent tax deed.Â  The\r\n  masterâ€™s findings and conclusions are premised on the hypothesis that Hartley purchased\r\n  the property at the tax sale, and the suggestion that she was engaged in a\r\n  â€œdeliberate schemeâ€¦to defeat [respondentâ€™s] lien.â€ Â Neither the hypothesis nor the\r\n  masterâ€™s suggestion is supported by any evidence in the record.\r\nThe master also\r\n  found Hartley redeemed the property rather than purchased it from the Commission.Â \r\n  This is erroneous.Â  The statutory redemption period ran from October 4, 1999 to\r\n  October 5, 2000.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-90.Â  After the redemption\r\n  period passed, the property was deeded to the Commission, and under Â§\r\n  12-51-160, that deed was prima facie evidence of good title.Â  Moreover,\r\n  Hartley purchased the property from the Commission at the price it set; she did\r\n  not redeem the property â€œby paying to the person officially charged with the\r\n  collection of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties, and costsâ€¦ [plus\r\n  statutory] interestâ€¦,â€ the procedure when property is redeemed following a tax\r\n  sale.Â  Â§ 12-51-90.\r\nImplicit\r\n  in the masterâ€™s order is a suggestion that the Commission breached its\r\n  statutory duty to sell property, which it owns by virtue of a tax deed, when\r\n  the sale and its terms â€œappear to be in the best interest of the countyâ€¦.â€ Â§\r\n  12-59-40.Â  There is no claim, much less any evidence, that the Commission, which\r\n  is not a party to this suit, did anything improper in selling the\r\n  property back to Hartley.Â  Moreover, the evidence does not support the masterâ€™s\r\n  finding that Hartley â€œmade arrangements with the â€˜RMC manâ€™ to pay the\r\n  delinquent taxes.â€Â  Rather, Hartley testified that while she went to the â€œRMC\r\n  manâ€ to see if she could pay the delinquent taxes, she learned she must instead\r\n  purchase the property from the Commission. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the\r\n  masterâ€™s order which characterized Hartleyâ€™s reacquisition of the property as a\r\n  redemption rather than a sale and consequently concluded that respondentâ€™s\r\n  mortgage was valid.[4]Â \r\n  We hold that the tax sale extinguished respondentâ€™s mortgage, and that\r\n  Hartleyâ€™s purchase of the property from the Commission did not resurrect it.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Danielâ€™s mortgage is the first lien on the property.Â  The order\r\n  under appeal is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] For simplicityâ€™s sake we refer to Carol Hartley and the other Hartley\r\nappellants as Hartley in this opinion.\r\n[2]Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-59-10 et seq. (2000).Â  Each county has a Commission which\r\n  exists to bid on real property otherwise unsold at a tax sale (Â§ 12-51-55), and\r\n  to hold title to that property as an asset of the county and then sell or\r\n  dispose of the property on such terms and conditions as appear to be in the\r\n  countyâ€™s best interest.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-59-10, -20 and -40\r\n(2000).\r\n[3] The saleâ€™s validity is not at issue here.\r\n[4] Respondent raises an additional argument on appeal to sustain the masterâ€™s\r\n  order.Â  Exercising our discretion, we decline to consider this contention.Â  E.g., Gecy v. Bagwell, 372 S.C. 237, 642 S.E.2d 569 (2007).Â  Even if we were\r\n  to consider this claim on the merits, it would not result in an affirmation of\r\nthe appealed order.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Heather Anne Glover","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2008-10-01-01","description":"This is an order placing a lawyer on interim suspension.","date":"2008-10-13","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn the Matter of Heather Anne Glover,Respondent.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel has filed a petition asking this Court to place respondent on interim suspension pursuant to Rule 17(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and seeking the appointment of an attorney to protect respondent&rsquo;s clients&rsquo; interests pursuant to Rule 31, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\n IT IS ORDERED that respondent&rsquo;s license to practice law in this state is suspended until further order of the Court.\r\n IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Thomas E.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tKimla\r\n  C. Johnson, of Clinton, Maryland, pro se.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an attorney discipline case involving misconduct\r\n  in three matters.Â  The Commission on Lawyer Conduct Panel (Panel) unanimously recommended\r\n  the following sanctions: (1) indefinite suspension; (2) respondent be required\r\n  to pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings; and (3) respondent make\r\n  restitution to the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection (Fund) and to victims in\r\n  the amounts set forth herein.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) appeals and argues that the facts and\r\n  similar case law call for a harsher sanction.Â  For the reasons stated below, we\r\n  are not persuaded that we should deviate from the Panelâ€™s recommendation.Â \r\n  Therefore, we impose the recommended sanctions. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nThis\r\n  proceeding involves three separate matters.Â  An investigative panel authorized\r\n  formal charges, which were then filed in April 2007.Â  A hearing was held before\r\n  the Panel in October 2007 and the report of the Panel was published in April\r\n  2008.\r\nRespondent\r\n  moved to South Carolina in 1990 and began practicing law in this state.Â \r\n  Following the birth of her second child, respondent began practicing law with\r\n  her husband.Â  Her husband (Husband) was placed on interim suspension in August\r\n  1999 and a number of Husbandâ€™s clients elected for respondent to take over\r\n  their cases.\r\nMatter A\r\nClient\r\n  A hired Husband to represent him in connection with an automobile collision\r\n  that occurred in March 1999.Â  Respondent took over representation of Client A\r\n  when Husband was placed on interim suspension.Â  In January 2000, respondent\r\n  accepted a settlement offer on behalf of Client A in the amount of $40,000.00.Â \r\n  Respondent did not disburse the proceeds of $26,667.67[1] to or on behalf of Client A, but\r\n  instead used the funds for her own benefit and for the benefit of her law\r\n  firm.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  claimed that Client A agreed to loan the funds to her and Husband.Â  However,\r\n  respondent failed to produce any documentation proving the existence of the\r\n  loan and the Panel found respondentâ€™s testimony in this regard lacking in\r\n  credibility.Â  The findings of the Panel are entitled to great weight, particularly\r\n  when the inferences drawn from the testimony in the record depend largely on\r\n  the credibility of witnesses. In re Yarborough, 327 S.C. 161, 165, 488\r\n  S.E.2d 871, 873 (1997).Â  Respondent stated to ODC that her financial records\r\n  were destroyed, but testified at the hearing that this was not true.\r\nODC\r\n  presented evidence that respondent allowed Husband to communicate with Client A\r\n  regarding settlement negotiations, and that respondent communicated with\r\n  Husband about demand figures.\r\nMatter B\r\nIn\r\n  November 1999, Client B hired respondent to represent her on a contingency\r\n  basis in connection with claims arising out of an automobile collision.Â \r\n  Respondent received settlement proceeds of $10,000.00 but did not place the\r\n  proceeds in her client trust account.Â  Respondent and Client B signed a\r\n  settlement disbursement statement which provided that respondent would receive\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and pay Client Bâ€™s medical providers from the proceeds.Â  The\r\n  remainder of the proceeds were to be paid to Client B.Â  Respondent paid some of\r\n  Client Bâ€™s medical bills and disbursed additional proceeds to Client B, yet $1,925.67\r\n  of the settlement funds designated to pay medical providers was neither paid to\r\n  providers nor disbursed to Client B.[2]Â  \r\nMatter C\r\nIn\r\n  1999, Client C hired respondent to represent her in an employment\r\n  discrimination matter on a contingency basis.Â  Respondentâ€™s fee arrangement was\r\n  one-third of the recovery to increase to forty percent in the event that a\r\n  lawsuit was filed.Â  Disciplinary Counsel produced documents showing that in\r\n  June 2000, respondent settled Client Câ€™s claim for $122,020.76.Â  Respondent did\r\n  not disburse the funds to Client C and instead misappropriated at least\r\n  $75,822.18.[3]Â  \r\nClient\r\n  C testified that she communicated primarily with Husband about the settlement.Â \r\n  For a number of years, Client C contacted Husband numerous times to inquire\r\n  about her settlement and, in response, he sent small amounts of cash to Client\r\n  C by way of Western Union.Â  ODC presented documents showing that between\r\n  September 2001 and December 2006, Client C received approximately $5,525.00 by\r\n  wire from Husband.Â  \r\nPANEL FINDINGS\r\nWith\r\n  regard to all matters, the Panel found by clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  Johnson violated several South Carolina Appellate Court Rules (SCACR); Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407 SCACR; and Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement (RLDE), Rule 413 SCACR.Â  The Panel found violations of Rule 417,\r\n  SCACR, failure to maintain appropriate financial records, and the following RPC:\r\n  (1) Rule 1.4, failing to reasonably communicate with client; (2) Rule 1.8,\r\n  entering into a business transaction with a client without documentation; (3)\r\n  Rule 1.15, commingling of lawyer and client funds; (4) Rule 5.5, assisting in\r\n  the unauthorized practice of law; (5) Rule 8.1, false statement in connection\r\n  with a disciplinary matter; (6) Rule 8.4(b), committing a criminal act that\r\n  reflects adversely on a lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a\r\n  lawyer; (7) Rule 8.4(d), engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit, and\r\n  misrepresentation; and (8) Rule 8.4(e), engaging in conduct prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThis\r\n  Court has the ultimate authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in\r\n  which the discipline is given rests entirely with this Court. In re Long,\r\n  346 S.C. 110, 112, 551 S.E.2d 586, 587 (2001).Â  This Court may make its own\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law, and is not bound by the Panelâ€™s\r\n  recommendation. In re Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 371, 520 S.E.2d 804, 806-07\r\n  (1999).Â  An attorney disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence. Id.\r\nAs\r\n  to Matter A, we do not agree with two of\r\n  the Panelâ€™s findings.Â  First, though the Panel found that respondent did not\r\n  loan funds to Client A, the Panel cited a breach of Rule 1.8(a), entering into\r\n  a business transaction with a client without proper documentation.Â  If no loan\r\n  existed, then respondent cannot have violated this rule.Â  Second, we find that\r\n  ODC failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent assisted\r\n  with the unauthorized practice of law.Â  The Panel notes that respondent\r\n  communicated with Husband regarding demand figures after the date of his\r\n  interim suspension.Â  As Husband was the original attorney in the matter,\r\n  respondentâ€™s communication with Husband concerning the status of the case does\r\n  not constitute assisting with the unauthorized practice of law. \r\nWith\r\n  regard to Matter C, we find that ODC failed to prove by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence that respondent assisted with the unauthorized practice of law.Â  ODC\r\n  alleged and the Panel found only that Husband communicated with Client C\r\n  regarding her case and sent funds by way of Western Union.Â  While such actions\r\n  may constitute the unauthorized practice of law by Husband, no evidence was\r\n  presented to show that respondent assisted Husband in his actions. \r\nIn\r\n  mitigation of the remaining violations, we note that respondentâ€™s mother died\r\n  tragically and unexpectedly in 1999 as respondent was administering CPR.Â \r\n  Respondent testified that her motherâ€™s death caused her to feel great grief and\r\n  guilt, which persisted well after the event and contributed to her\r\n  decision-making.Â  Also in 1999, shortly after the death of her mother, Husband\r\n  was placed on interim suspension from the practice of law. Â Respondent found\r\n  herself solely responsible for their law practice and responsible for having to\r\n  provide for her two special needs children.Â  Respondent testified that the\r\n  period of time in which the two events occurred constituted a very traumatic\r\n  time in her life.Â  Her misconduct occurred close in time to these events.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  unanimous findings and conclusions of the Panel are entitled to much respect\r\n  and consideration. Larkin, supra, at 371, 520 S.E.2d at 806. Â Based\r\n  on the facts and mitigating factors, we are not persuaded that a harsher\r\n  sanction is warranted in this case.Â  We therefore adopt the Panelâ€™s\r\n  recommendation and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  \r\nWith\r\n  regard to restitution, we agree with the Panel that Client A is entitled to\r\n  restitution in the amount of $26,667.67 and Client B is entitled to restitution\r\n  in the amount of $1,925.67.Â  However, we note that the Panelâ€™s recommendation\r\n  as to Client C does not comport with the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection\r\n  Rules of Procedure. [4]Â \r\n  Section IV of the Rules of Procedure states that before a client may be\r\n  reimbursed by the Fund, the client must sign a subrogation agreement.Â  The\r\n  Rules also set forth the following procedure if the client later recovers from\r\n  the offending attorney: â€œAny amounts recovered . . . by the client, in excess\r\n  of the amount to which the Fund is subrogated . . . shall be paid to or\r\n  retained by the client as the case may be.â€ Id.Â  We therefore order\r\n  respondent to make restitution to all injured parties, including clients and\r\n  the Fund.Â  We emphasize that Client C shall not receive funds from respondent\r\n  in restitution until the Fund is fully reimbursed for the $40,000.00 already\r\n  paid to Client C from the Fund.Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel shall implement\r\n  a plan for restitution and payment of costs within thirty days of this opinion.\r\nIn\r\n  summary, respondent must meet the following requirements before she may be\r\n  re-admitted to the practice of law: (1) satisfy Rule 33(f), RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR; (2) pay costs of the disciplinary proceedings in accordance with the\r\n  plan to be set forth by ODC; and (3) make restitution in accordance with the\r\n  plan to be set forth by ODC.\r\nRespondent\r\n  shall file, within fifteen days of this opinion, an affidavit with the Clerk of\r\n  Court stating that she has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR and shall\r\n  also surrender her Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk\r\n  of Court. \r\nINDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Client Aâ€™s net proceeds after attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n[2] The Panel arrived at this figure by subtracting the\r\n  following amounts from the $10,000 settlement proceeds: an attorneyâ€™s fee in\r\n  the amount of $3,333.33, a payment by respondent to one of the providers in the\r\n  amount of $2,357.00, and payments to Client B in the amounts of $1,900.00 and\r\n  $484.00.\r\n[3] The Panel arrived at this figure by subtracting from\r\n  the proceeds of approximately $122,000 a one-third contingency fee and the\r\n  total amount of funds sent by way of Western Union by Husband to Client C in\r\n  response to her inquiries about the settlement.Â  \r\n[4] Client C has already received $40,000.00 from the\r\n  Fund, the maximum available to an individual.Â  In an effort to fully compensate\r\n  Client C, the Panel ordered respondent to repay $40,000.00 to the Fund and to\r\n  pay an additional $35,822.18 to Client C.Â  While we appreciate the Panelâ€™s\r\n  intent, where a client has received money from the Fund, the Fund must be\r\n  repaid before the client can receive any additional restitution from the\r\n  attorney.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and C. Tex Davis, Jr., Senior\r\n          Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary\r\n          Counsel.\r\n        Jason B. Buffkin, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â \r\n  In contemplation of filing a Petition for Reinstatement, respondent discovered\r\n  a scrivenerâ€™s error in the Courtâ€™s original opinion in this matter.Â  The Court\r\n  reissues its opinion as follows. Â Â \r\nIn this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement,\r\n  respondent admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction set\r\n  forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE.Â  Respondent\r\n  requests that if a suspension is imposed, it be made retroactive to the date of\r\n  her interim suspension. Â See In the Matter of Farlow, 369 S.C. 48,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 75 (2006).Â  We\r\n  accept the agreement and find a two year suspension from the practice of law is\r\n  the appropriate sanction.Â  The\r\n  suspension shall not be made retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim\r\n  suspension.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â \r\n  Respondent pled guilty to one count of accommodation distribution of marijuana\r\n  without remuneration, in violation of 21 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 841(b)(1)(D) and 841(b)(4),\r\n  and one count of possession of methylenedioxymethamphetamine hydrochloride,\r\n  also known as â€œecstasy,â€ in violation of 21 U.S.C. Â§ 844(a).Â  Respondent was\r\n  sentenced to six monthsâ€™ imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently.[1]Â  It was also ordered that, upon\r\n  release, respondent be under supervision for one year, six months of which must\r\n  include participation in the home confinement program with electronic\r\n  monitoring.\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by her misconduct, she has\r\n  violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\r\n  407, SCACR:Â  Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage\r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and Rule\r\n  8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is\r\n  prejudicial to the administration of justice).Â  Respondent also admits her misconduct\r\n  constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for\r\n  discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule\r\n  7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct\r\n  tending to pollute the administration of justice, to bring the courts or legal\r\n  profession into disrepute, or demonstrate an unfitness to practice law) of the\r\nRules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept\r\n  the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the\r\n  practice of law in this state for two years.Â  The suspension shall not be made retroactive to the date of\r\n  respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within\r\n  fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30 of\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender her Certificate of Admission to the\r\n  Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  In addition, as set forth in the\r\n  agreement, respondent shall, within thirty (30) days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, pay $861.88 for costs incurred in the investigation and prosecution of\r\n  this matter by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and the Commission on Lawyer\r\n  Conduct.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At the sentencing hearing, it was also determined\r\n  respondent had given perjured testimony in the trial of another individual.Â \r\n  The acts that gave rise to both the criminal charges against respondent and the\r\n  finding of perjury occurred prior to respondentâ€™s admission to the practice of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26556","title":"In the Matter of Blaine T.

(RDE Rule II(G)) (â€œIf an attorney admitted to practice before\r\n  [the USDC] is disbarred or suspended by the Supreme Court of South Carolina,\r\n  [the USDC] shall immediately order the identical disciplinary actionsâ€¦.â€).Â  On\r\n  September 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court suspended respondent as a consequence\r\n  of his suspension before the USDC.Â  See Local Rule 83.IX.02 (â€œPursuant\r\n  to Bankruptcy Rule 9029m the Bankruptcy Judges of this District are hereby\r\n  authorized to make such rules of practice and procedure as they may deem\r\n  appropriate; provided, however, that in promulgating the rules governing the\r\n  admission or eligibility to practice in the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy\r\n  Judges shall require District Court admission â€¦.â€). \r\nIn the meantime, in connection with\r\n  actions filed by Gary and Dana Henderson and James and Kathryn Henson, the\r\n  Bankruptcy Court had issued an order requiring respondent to appear to explain\r\n  his failure to provide competent and diligent representation to the Hendersons\r\n  and the Hensons, to show cause why his fees should not be disgorged, and to\r\n  show cause why further sanctions should not be imposed including, but not\r\n  limited to, suspension from practice before the Bankruptcy Court and/or\r\n  disgorgement of fees in other cases.Â  See Bankruptcy Court order dated\r\n  August 25, 2006.Â  \r\nRespondent appeared before the Bankruptcy\r\n  Court onÂ  August 31, 2006 hearing.Â  By order dated September 5, 2006, the Bankruptcy\r\n  Court found respondent had failed to file documents by the required deadlines\r\n  which resulted in the dismissal of the Hendersonsâ€™ and Hensonsâ€™ bankruptcy\r\n  petitions and ordered respondent to disgorge his attorneyâ€™s fees within five\r\n  (5) days.Â  The judge continued the Rule to Show Cause hearing to consider other\r\n  sanctions until September 21, 2006.Â  \r\nRespondent did not appear at the Rule to\r\n  Show Cause hearing.Â  On October 4, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order\r\n  again requiring respondent to disgorge the balance of fees received from the\r\n  Hendersons and Hensons within ten (10) days.[1]Â \r\n  In particular, the court noted:Â  \r\n\r\n  [i]nasmuch as [respondent] is\r\n    presently suspended from practice before this [Bankruptcy] Court, as a\r\n    consequence of the [August 29, 2006 USDC] suspension, the [Bankruptcy] Court\r\n    need not take further immediate action regarding his ability to currently\r\n    practice in this [Bankruptcy] Court, except that [respondentâ€™s] suspension\r\n      from practice before this [Bankruptcy] Court shall continue, regardless of\r\n      reinstatement by the [USDC], until further order of this [Bankruptcy] Courtâ€¦Reinstatement\r\n    to practice before this [Bankruptcy] Court may be conditioned upon his\r\n    compliance with orders of this [Bankruptcy] Court and such other conditions as\r\n    this [Bankruptcy] Court may impose. \r\n\r\n(Underline added).Â  \r\nThe Bankruptcy Court\r\n  continued the first Rule to Show Cause hearing and issued a second Rule to Show\r\n  Cause order directing respondent to appear on October 19, 2006 â€œto show cause\r\n  why further sanctions should not be imposed or limits placed on his ability to\r\n  gain reinstatement to practice before this [Bankruptcy] Court based upon his\r\n  representation of [the Hendersons and Hensons] in these cases and in all\r\n    other cases filed in this [Bankruptcy] Court in which he failed to file\r\n    documents on behalf of his clients.â€Â Â Â  \r\n(Underline added).Â  \r\nRespondent appeared for the show cause\r\n  hearings on October 19, 2006.Â  The Bankruptcy Courtâ€™s October 24, 2006 order\r\n  provides:Â  \r\n\r\n  [t]he [Bankruptcy] Court orders\r\n    that [respondent] shall be suspended from practice before this [Bankruptcy] Court,\r\n    notwithstanding any intervening reinstatement by other courts within this\r\n    District, until such time as [respondent] brings a motion for reinstatement to\r\n    practiceâ€¦.The motion for reinstatement shall be heard by the undersigned as\r\n    Chief Bankruptcy Judge for this District who may place conditions and\r\n    limitations on [respondentâ€™s] ability to be reinstated to practice before this [Bankruptcy]\r\n    Court, including, but not limited to [respondent] complying with the orders\r\n    of this [Bankruptcy] Court disgorging his attorneyâ€™s fees to his clients,\r\n    [respondent] demonstrating that he is able to provide competent and diligent\r\n    representation to clients, and [respondent] attending continuing legal\r\n    education classes in the area of ethics and bankruptcy.[2] \r\n\r\n(Underline added).Â  \r\nThe Bankruptcy Court\r\n  amended its October 4, 2006 order to reflect the additional conditions\r\n  regarding respondentâ€™s suspension before the court.Â  It dissolved the two Rules\r\n  to Show Cause, but stated the orders concerning disgorgement of fees remained\r\n  in effect.Â  \r\nOn June 9, 2008, ODC filed a certified\r\n  copy of the Bankruptcy Courtâ€™s January 4, 2007 Supplemental Order in In re\r\n    Storay.Â  In that order, the Bankruptcy Court discussed respondentâ€™s failure\r\n  to pursue thirty (30) bankruptcy petitions, the resulting dismissal of\r\n  twenty-four (24) of the cases, respondentâ€™s concession that he had no funds to\r\n  repay the twenty-four (24) clientsâ€™ retainers, and his agreement that he should\r\n  be required to repay the twenty-four (24) clients, with interest, before\r\n  reinstatement by the Bankruptcy Court.Â  The Bankruptcy Courtâ€™s order provides: \r\n\r\n  It is therefore ordered that [respondent]\r\n    shall repay to the debtors in the 24 cases which were dismissed as a result of\r\n    his failure to file schedules and statements all of the fees, including filing\r\n    fees, paid to him by the debtors in those cases.Â  [Respondent] shall also pay\r\n    interest on those fees from October 16, 2005, until the date of repayment at\r\n    the rate of eight and one-half percent per annum.Â  In the event that\r\n    [respondent] seeks reinstatement to practice before this [Bankruptcy] Court, he\r\n    shall first be required to produce satisfactory proof of payment of the fees\r\n    ordered to be repaid herein.Â  [Respondent] shall also provide twenty-day (20)\r\n    written, advance notice to the debtors in the 24 dismissed cases of any\r\n    application seeking reinstatement to practice before this [Bankruptcy] Court so that the debtors may have the opportunity to be heard on the merits of the\r\n    application.Â  This Order supplements the terms in conditions regarding\r\n    [respondentâ€™s] ability to gain reinstatement to practice before this [Bankruptcy]\r\n    Court as set forth in In re Henderson, C/A/ No. 05-14925-W, slip or. (Bankr.\r\n    D.S.C. Oct. 24, 2006).[3]Â Â  \r\n\r\nBankruptcy Court Supplemental Order dated January 4, 2007.Â  \r\nPursuant to Rule 29(b), RLDE, the Clerk\r\n  provided the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and respondent with thirty\r\n  (30) days in which to inform the Court of any reason why the imposition of\r\n  identical discipline was not warranted.Â  ODC filed a response stating the\r\n  Bankruptcy Courtâ€™s suspension was equivalent to a definite suspension of up to\r\n  two years under Rule 7(b), RLDE, and, further, that it had no information to\r\n  indicate that the issuance of the same discipline by the Court would not be\r\n  warranted. Â Respondent filed a response stating that Rule 29 is inapplicable\r\n  because reciprocal discipline only applies when discipline has been issued by a\r\n  court physically located outside of South Carolina. \r\nLAW\r\nRule 29(a), RLDE, provides that â€œ[u]pon\r\n  notification from any source that a lawyer within the jurisdiction of the\r\n  Commission [on Lawyer Conduct] has been disciplined â€¦in another jurisdiction,\r\n  disciplinary counsel shall obtain a certified copy of the disciplinary order\r\n  and file it with â€¦the Supreme Court.â€Â  After receipt of the certified order\r\n  â€œdemonstrating that a lawyer admitted to practice in this state has been\r\n  disciplinedâ€¦in another jurisdiction,â€ the Court is required to issue a notice\r\n  to the lawyer and ODC seeking a response concerning whether identical\r\n  discipline is warranted.Â  Rule 29(b), RLDE.\r\nRule 29(d), RLDE, further provides that,\r\n  after the expiration of the time for a response, the Court shall impose\r\n  identical discipline unless the attorney or ODC demonstrate or the Court finds\r\n  that â€œit clearly appears upon the face of the record from which the discipline\r\n  is predicatedâ€ that the identical discipline is improper for one of several\r\n  stated reasons including:Â  1) the procedure was so lacking in notice or\r\n  opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process; 2)\r\n  infirmity of proof of the misconduct; 3) imposition of the same discipline by\r\n  the Court would result in grave injustice; 4) the established misconduct\r\n  warrants substantially different discipline in this state; and 5) the reason\r\n  for the original transfer to incapacity inactive status no longer exists.Â Â Â  \r\nRule 29, RLDE, authorizes this Court to\r\n  impose reciprocal discipline on a lawyer who was disciplined â€œin another\r\n  jurisdiction.â€Â  Contrary to respondentâ€™s assertion, Rule 29 does not require\r\n  that the other jurisdiction be located outside the borders of this State in\r\n  order for its provisions to apply.Â  Moreover, on at least one occasion, the\r\n  Court has imposed reciprocal discipline on a lawyer who was sanctioned by the\r\n  same Bankruptcy Court which disciplined respondent in the instant matter.Â  In\r\n    the Matter of Hood, 367 S.C. 29, 625 S.E.2d 210 (2006).Â  \r\nIn summary, the Bankruptcy Courtâ€™s orders:Â \r\n  1) directed that respondent remain suspended, regardless of his reinstatement\r\n  by the USDC and 2) ordered him to repay all of the fees, including filing fees,\r\n  (plus interest) paid by the twenty-four (24) bankruptcy clients.Â  See October 24, 2006 Bankruptcy Court order and January 4, 2007 Bankruptcy Court\r\n  order.Â  The orders further required that, if respondent seeks reinstatement, he\r\n  must 1) provide proof of restitution to the twenty-four (24) clients, 2)\r\n  provide twenty (20) days advance notice of his application to seek\r\n  reinstatement, and 3) appear before the Chief Bankruptcy Judge.Â  See October 24, 2006 and January 4, 2007 Bankruptcy Court orders.Â Â Â  \r\nWe find that the sanction imposed by the\r\n  Bankruptcy Court is most similar to a two (2) year definite suspension with the\r\n  requirement of repayment of unearned attorneyâ€™s fees or costs under the RLDE.Â  See Rules 7(b) (sanctions) and 33 RLDE (provisions regarding reinstatement\r\n  following definite suspension from nine months to two years). Â Further, we find\r\n  that the same sanction is proper as reciprocal\r\n  discipline in this matter. Â See generally In the Matter of\r\n    Drayton, 359 S.C. 138, 597 S.E.2d 791 (2004) (indefinite suspension\r\n  appropriate where lawyer failed to refund unearned fee to bankruptcy client,\r\n  failed to timely withdraw from representation of clients in bankruptcy court,\r\n  and committed other misconduct); In the Matter of Gaines, 348 S.C. 208,\r\n  559 S.E.2d 577 (2002) (Court noted two year suspension would be appropriate for\r\n  lawyerâ€™s lack of diligence in client matters and submission of improper\r\n  documents to courts, among other misconduct, but disbarred lawyer due to his previous\r\n  disciplinary history); In the Matter of Strait, 343 S.C. 312, 540 S.E.2d\r\n  460 (2000) (six month and one day suspension appropriate for lawyerâ€™s failure\r\n  to diligently represent two domestic clients and failure to submit paperwork\r\n  for bankruptcy client, resulting in dismissal of case, among other misconduct); In the Matter of Jones, 340 S.C. 388, 532 S.E.2d 281 (2000) (thirty day\r\n  suspension appropriate where lawyer failed to enter responsive pleading\r\n  resulting in default judgment and committed other misconduct).Â  Accordingly, we hereby suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for two\r\n  (2) years, retroactive to August 16, 2006, the date of his interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Edwards, supra.Â  In addition, respondent shall\r\n  repay the twenty-four bankruptcy clients as ordered by the Bankruptcy Courtâ€™s\r\n  orders.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file\r\n  an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\nand KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Respondent had repaid a portion of the fees to the\r\nHenderson and Hensons. \r\n[2] The order specifies that respondent agreed to\r\nthe terms of the order.Â  \r\n[3]Â  The August 25, 2006, September 5, 2006, October\r\n  4, 2006, October 24, 2006, and January 1, 2007 Bankruptcy Court orders were\r\nissued by John E.

Graham, of Graham Law Firm, of Florence, for Petitioner.\r\n        C.\r\n          Anthony Harris, Jr., of Harris McLeod &amp; Ruffner, of Cheraw, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this case, the trial court denied Petitionerâ€™s Batson motion finding that Respondentâ€™s counselâ€™s exercise of a\r\n  peremptory strike based on a jurorâ€™s display of dreadlocks was not racially\r\n  motivated.Â  The court of appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision and this\r\n  Court granted certiorari.Â  We reverse the\r\n  decision of the court of appeals upholding the denial of Petitionerâ€™s Batson motion and remand the case for a new trial.Â  Â  Â \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner Lakhefia McCrea brought suit seeking\r\n  compensation for bodily injuries and vehicular damage sustained in an\r\n  automobile accident in which Respondent Jafer\r\n  Gheraibeh was the at-fault driver.Â  Following\r\n  Respondentâ€™s strike of three of six potential African-American jurors during\r\n  jury selection, Petitioner moved for a hearing pursuant to Batson v.\r\n    Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), arguing that Respondentâ€™s strikes of the\r\n  African-American jurors were racially motivated and therefore impermissible.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the Batson hearing, the trial court asked Respondent his reason for\r\n  striking a particular African-American juror.Â  Respondentâ€™s counsel explained:\r\n\r\n  Your Honor, I had some uneasiness about [this particular juror].Â \r\n    He was - I of course have to look at jurors in light of how I think theyâ€™re\r\n    going to judge my client as well.Â  I had some uneasiness about him.Â  I donâ€™t\r\n    know if Your Honor recalls or not.Â  He has - heâ€™s about the only member of the\r\n    jury I see out there with very long dreadlocks.Â  That gave me some concern in\r\n    light of how he may react toward my client.Â  It was - as Your Honor knows,\r\n    sometimes in selecting a juror thereâ€™s a sense or - or in deciding whether or\r\n    not to strike someone thereâ€™s necessarily a sense of a feel about a juror and -\r\n    and that gave me some pause . . . was his appearance including - including the\r\n    dreadlocks.\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  hearing counselâ€™s explanation for striking the other two African-American\r\n  jurors, Petitioner indicated that her main concern was the strike of the juror\r\n  with dreadlocks.[1]Â \r\n  Specifically, Petitioner argued that Respondentâ€™s counselâ€™s â€œuneasinessâ€ over the\r\n  display of dreadlocks was not a sufficient basis to exercise a discretionary strike,\r\n  and that when considered along with Respondentâ€™s strike of two other\r\n  African-American jurors, counselâ€™s â€œuneasinessâ€ over the jurorâ€™s dreadlocks amounted\r\n  to pretext.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial judge explained that in ruling on Petitionerâ€™s Batson motion, he\r\n  had to evaluate the credibility of the attorneys.Â  Stating that he knew both of\r\n  the attorneys and was aware of their reputations in the community, the trial\r\n  judge concluded that while some attorneys he knew might be inclined to exercise\r\n  a racially-motivated jury strike, he did not believe that Respondentâ€™s attorney\r\n  would engage in such conduct.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of Petitioner for $5,985 in\r\n  personal injury damages and $5,000 in property damages.Â  The trial court denied\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new\r\n  trial absolute, and a new trial nisi additur, and entered judgment on Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  behalf for $6,887.25 after reducing the verdict amount by $4,097.75 for the\r\n  amount Respondent had previously paid.Â  \r\nPetitioner appealed on multiple grounds and the court of appeals\r\n  affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  McCrea v. Gheraibeh, Op. No.\r\n  2006-UP-072 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 2, 2006).Â  Regarding the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  denial of Petitionerâ€™s Batson motion, the court of appeals held that counselâ€™s\r\n  concern regarding the jurorâ€™s appearance and his dreadlocks was a\r\n  racially-neutral explanation for the strike.Â  Id.Â  The court further reasoned\r\n  that the decision to wear an alternative hairstyle is not specific to any race,\r\n  and therefore, no discriminatory intent was inherent in counselâ€™s explanation.Â  Id.\r\nThis Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the court\r\n  of appeals and Petitioner raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Â Did the court of appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s\r\n    denial of Petitionerâ€™s Batson motion?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that the trial court erred in denying her Batson motion because Respondentâ€™s\r\n  peremptory strike of a juror for wearing dreadlocks was racially motivated.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\n The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venire\r\n  person on the basis of race or gender.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604,\r\n  615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001).Â  Following the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s\r\n  decision in Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995), this Court clarified\r\n  the three-step method for executing a Batson hearing in State v.\r\n    Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996).Â  Under the method articulated\r\n  in Adams, a trial court must hold a Batson hearing when\r\n  members of a cognizable racial group or gender are struck and the opposing\r\n  party requests a hearing.Â  322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372.Â  At the hearing,\r\n  the proponent of the strike must offer a facially race-neutral explanation for\r\n  the strike.Â  Then, in a final step, the burden shifts to the party challenging\r\n  the strike to show that the explanation is mere pretext.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  modifying this Courtâ€™s previous brand of Batson analysis, Adams emphasized the lack of any requirement for counsel to present a\r\n  reasonably specific, legitimate explanation for making the strike in the second\r\n  step of the analysis.Â  Id. at 123, 470 S.E.2d at 371.Â  Rather,\r\n  following the lead of Purkett, this Court declared that the second step\r\n  of a Batson inquiry only required that counselâ€™s explanation be\r\n  race-neutral in order to ensure that the burden of showing purposeful\r\n  discrimination remains at all times on the opponent of the strike.Â  Id. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  we recognize the importance of properly allocating the burden of proof in a Batson inquiry, in our view, counselâ€™s explanation that he struck the particular\r\n  juror based simply on counselâ€™s â€œuneasinessâ€ over the jurorâ€™s dreadlocks was\r\n  not a race-neutral reason for exercising a peremptory strike.Â  Regardless of\r\n  their gradual infiltration into mainstream American society, dreadlocks retain\r\n  their roots as a religious and social symbol of historically black cultures.[2]Â \r\n  For this reason, we hold that counselâ€™s explanation that the jurorâ€™s dreadlocks\r\n  caused him â€œuneasinessâ€ was insufficient to satisfy the race-neutral\r\n  requirement in the second step of the trial courtâ€™s Batson analysis.Â  See\r\n    also Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 56, 495 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1998) (holding\r\n  that basing a peremptory strike on a characterization of the juror as a\r\n  â€œredneckâ€ is facially discriminatory in violation of Batson).Â  \r\nBy\r\n  proceeding with a pretext inquiry under Batson without first eliciting a\r\n  race-neutral reason for the strike from Respondentâ€™s counsel, and ultimately\r\n  dismissing Petitionerâ€™s Batson motion based solely on the reputation of\r\n  counsel making the strike, we find that the trial court bypassed an evidentiary\r\n  requirement that goes to the very heart of a Batson inquiry.[3]Â \r\nFor this reason, we hold that the trial court erred in denying Petitionerâ€™s Batson motion. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals\r\n  affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of Petitionerâ€™s Batson motion and\r\n  remand the case for a new trial.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBEATTY,\r\n  J., and Acting Justice J. Michelle Childs, concur. MOORE, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  MOORE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I would affirm the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling that petitioner failed to meet her burden of showing that trial\r\n  counselâ€™s reason for striking the juror was pretextual.\r\nThe Equal\r\n  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the\r\n  striking of a venire person on the basis of race or gender.Â  State v. Evins,\r\n  373 S.C. 404, 645 S.E.2d 904 (2001), cert. denied, 128 S.Ct. 662\r\n  (2007).Â  The proper procedure for a Batson hearing is set forth in Evins,\r\n  at 415, 645 S.E.2d at 909.Â  After a party objects to a jury strike, the\r\n  proponent of the strike must offer a facially race-neutral explanation.Â  Id.Â  Once the proponent states a reason that is race-neutral, the burden is on the\r\n  party challenging the strike to show the explanation is mere pretext, either by\r\n  showing similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury or\r\n  that the reason given for the strike is so fundamentally implausible as to\r\n  constitute mere pretext despite a lack of disparate treatment.Â  Id.Â  The burden of persuading the court that a Batson violation has occurred\r\n  remains at all times on the opponent of the strike.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWhether a Batson violation has occurred must be determined by examining the totality of the\r\n  facts and circumstances in the record.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604,\r\n  615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 977 (2001).Â \r\n  Typically, the decisive question is whether the attorneyâ€™s race-neutral\r\n  explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed.Â  Evins, at\r\n  415-416, 645 S.E.2d at 909.Â  There is seldom much evidence in the record\r\n  bearing on the issue, and the trial courtâ€™s findings regarding purposeful\r\n  discrimination necessarily will rest largely on the evaluation of demeanor and\r\n  credibility of counsel.Â  Id.Â  Often the demeanor of the challenged\r\n  attorney will be the best and only evidence of discrimination, and evaluation\r\n  of the attorneyâ€™s mind lies peculiarly within a trial judgeâ€™s province.Â  Shuler,\r\n  at 615, 545 S.E.2d at 810 (citing Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991).Â  Therefore, those findings are given great deference and will not be set\r\n  aside unless clearly erroneous.Â  Evins, at 416, 645 S.E.2d at 910.Â  \r\nIn my opinion, the\r\n  court of appeals correctly found that respondentâ€™s reason for striking the\r\n  juror was race-neutral pursuant to Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765\r\n  (1995).Â  In Purkett, the United States Supreme Court found that a\r\n  prosecutorâ€™s explanation for striking an African-American juror was\r\n  race-neutral where the prosecutor explained that he struck the juror because he\r\n  had â€œlong, unkempt hair, a mustache, and a beard.â€Â  The prosecutor had further\r\n  explained that he did not â€œlike the way [the juror] looked,â€ and that the\r\n  mustache and beard looked suspicious to him.Â  Thus, the United States Supreme\r\n  Court approved the challenge of a prospective African-American juror solely on\r\n  the basis of his appearance.Â  The United States Supreme Court noted that the\r\n  growing of long, unkempt hair is not peculiar to any race.Â  Id. at 769.Â \r\n  Â \r\nFurthermore, I\r\n  believe that the court of appeals properly noted that the decision to wear an\r\n  alternative hairstyle is not specific to any race.Â  See Hastings v. Cambra, 2000 WL 307473 (N.D. Calif. 2000) (finding that striking a\r\n  proposed African-American juror because he had dreadlocks is a reasonable and\r\n  race-neutral reason for the strike); State v. Bolton, 49 P.3d 468 (Kan. 2002) (upholding the trial courtâ€™s decision finding no purposeful discrimination for\r\n  striking a prospective African-American juror who wore hair braids).Â  Just as\r\n  the United States Supreme Court similarly noted in Purkett, the decision\r\n  to wear oneâ€™s hair in the dreadlocks hairstyle is not peculiar to any race.Â  In\r\n  other cultures and more often in the past, the hairstyle has been worn as a\r\n  religious choice by, for example, Hindus and Rastafarians, and is unrelated to\r\n  race.Â  In recent years, the wearing of the dreadlocks hairstyle has been\r\n  practiced by both African-Americans and Caucasians, but more often by\r\n  African-Americans.Â  I would find that the choice to wear dreadlocks is a choice\r\n  to wear an alternative hairstyle and is not limited to one particular race and\r\n  that the trial judge therefore appropriately determined respondentâ€™s reason for\r\n  striking the juror was race-neutral.Â  See Purkett at 769 (a\r\n  legitimate reason for exercising a challenge is not a reason that makes sense\r\n  but a reason that does not deny equal protection).Â  \r\nIn the instant\r\n  case, after finding the reason for the strike was race-neutral, the trial judge\r\n  then properly proceeded to determine whether petitioner could meet the burden\r\n  of showing the explanation was actually mere pretext.Â  Petitioner argued that\r\n  having dreadlocks and making respondentâ€™s attorney uneasy was not a sufficient\r\n  basis for a discretionary strike.Â  The judge found that, based on his\r\n  evaluation of respondentâ€™s attorneyâ€™s reputation and credibility, petitioner\r\n  had not met her burden of showing pretext.Â  In my view, petitionerâ€™s cursory\r\n  argument, without more, does not meet her burden of showing that the reason\r\n  given for the strike was so fundamentally implausible as to constitute mere\r\n  pretext, and thus, because the trial courtâ€™s finding is not clearly erroneous,\r\n  it may not be set aside.Â  See Evins, at 416, 645 S.E.2d at 909\r\n  (demeanor of the challenged attorney will be the best and only evidence of\r\n  discrimination, and the evaluation of the attorneyâ€™s mind lies peculiarly\r\n  within a trial judgeâ€™s provide; therefore, this finding is given great\r\n  deference and will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous); Shuler,\r\n  at 615, 545 S.E.2d at 810 (same).Â  \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, I would affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision upholding the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondentâ€™s counsel explained that the two additional\r\n  prospective African-American jurors were struck on the respective bases of (1) being\r\n  retired, and (2) having a criminal domestic violence charge, although the juror\r\nwas later found not guilty.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2] For this reason, we would distinguish Purkett, which determined that the exercise of a peremptory strike because a jurorâ€™s\r\n  â€œlong, unkempt hairâ€ looked â€œsuspiciousâ€ was constitutionally permissible.Â \r\n  While we agree that the growing of long, unkempt hair is not associated with\r\n  any race, we find that counselâ€™s specific reference to the jurorâ€™s hair as\r\n  â€œdreadlocksâ€ in conjunction with an otherwise vague explanation for the strike,\r\n  carries with it an inherently discriminatory intent.Â  See Purkett, 514\r\n  U.S. at 768 (deeming an explanation for a strike race-neutral â€œ[u]nless a\r\n  discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutorâ€™s explanationâ€).Â Â Â  Â Â \r\n[3] In this same way, we believe that the dissentâ€™s analysis improperly focuses on\r\n  the issue of pretext in the third step of Batson when the real issue, in\r\n  our view, is Respondentâ€™s counselâ€™s failure to first meet the requirement of\r\nrace-neutrality in the second step of Batson.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
